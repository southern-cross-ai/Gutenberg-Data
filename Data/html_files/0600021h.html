    <h1>
      <a name="c01" id="c01">CHAPTER I</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Autumn winds had long waved the grass in the vast upland
      valley and the breath of the north had tinged the
      meandering lines of trees along the river bottoms. Gold and
      purple, and a flame of fire, shone brightly in the morning
      sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Birds and beasts of that wild open northland felt stir in
      them the instinct to move toward the south. The honk of
      wild geese floated down upon the solitudes and swift flocks
      of these heralds of winter sped by, sharply outlined
      against the blue sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      High upon the western rampart of that valley perched an
      eagle, watching from his lonely crag. His telescopic eye
      ranged afar. Beneath him on the endless slope and boundless
      floor of the valley, moved a black mass, creeping with
      snail-like slowness toward the south. It seemed as long as
      the valley and as wide. It reached to the dim purple
      distances and disappeared there. The densest part covered
      the center of the valley, from which ran wide straggling
      arms, like rivers narrowing toward their sources in the
      hills. Patches of gray grass, dotted with gold, shone here
      and there against the black background. Always the dark
      moving streams and blots seemed encroaching upon these
      patches of grass. They spread over them and covered them.
      Then other open spaces appeared at different points. How
      slow the change! Yet there was a definite movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This black mass was alive. The eagle was gazing down upon
      leagues and leagues of buffalo. Acres of buffalo, miles of
      buffalo, millions of buffalo! The shaggy, irregular, ragged
      herd had no end. It dominated slopes, and bottomlands, and
      the hazy reaches beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vision of the eagle was an organ for self-preservation,
      not capable of appreciating the beauty and sublimity of the
      earth and its myriads of wild creatures. Yet with piercing
      eye the eagle watched from his lonely crag. Boundless void,
      with its moving coverlet of black, the wide space of sky
      keen with its cool wind--valley of leagues, with its living
      heritage of a million years! Wild, primitive, grand was the
      scene. It was eloquent of the past. The future stretched
      away like the dim, strange, unknown purple distances, with
      an intimation of tragedy. But the hour was one of natural
      fruition, wild life in the open, with the sun like an eye
      of the Creator, shining over the land. Peace, silence,
      solitude attended the eagle in his vigil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet a brooding sadness, like an invisible mantle, lay over
      the valley. Was it the dreamy, drowsy spell of autumn? Was
      it the pervading spirit of a dying season, reluctant to
      face the rigor of snow and ice? The fact was that autumn
      lingered, and nature brooded over some mystery, some
      problem, some blunder. Life was sweet, strong--scented on
      the wind, but there was death lurking somewhere, perhaps in
      the purple shadow of distance to the southward. The morning
      was bright, golden, glorious, yet it did not wait, and
      night was coming. So there was more than the melancholy
      languor of autumn in the still air. A mighty Being seemed
      breathing there, invisible and infinite, all-encompassing.
      It kept its secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the eagle plunged like a thunderbolt from his crag
      and shot down and down, at last to spread his closed wings,
      and sail slowly and majestically round and round, over an
      open grassy patch encircled by buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this spot, well toward the center and front of the vast
      herd, appeared about to be enacted a battle between a
      monarch and his latest rival for supremacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The huge leader, shaggy, brown, ragged, was not a creature
      of beauty, but he was magnificent. He had twice the bulk of
      an ox, and stood as high as a horse. His massive head, with
      the long shaggy hair matted with burrs, was held low,
      muzzle almost to the ground, showing the big curved short
      horns widely separated. Eyes of dark fire blazed from
      beneath the shaggy locks. His great back slowly arched and
      his short tufted tail rose stiffly erect. A hoarse rumble
      issued from the cavern of his chest--a roar at the brazen
      effrontery of this young bull that dared to face him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many and many had been the battles of this old monarch. For
      years he had reigned, so many that he had forgotten the
      instinct of his youth, when he, like the rival before him,
      had bearded the king of the buffaloes. He had to fight
      again, in obedience to that law which respected only the
      survival of the fittest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bull that had challenged the king to battle was also
      magnificent. He too lowered his huge head, and with short
      prodigious strokes he pawed tufts of grass and heaps of
      earth up into the air. His color was a glossy seal brown
      and he did not have the ragged, worn appearance of the
      monarch. His shaggy hair hung thick and woolly from head
      and shoulders and knees. Great rippling muscles swelled on
      his flanks as he pawed and moved round his enemy. He meant
      to attack. He shone resplendent. He seemed the epitome of
      animal vigor and spirit. The bawl with which he answered
      the roar of the monarch rang clear and hard, like a blast.
      He possessed something that the old warrior had lost. He
      had beauty and youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surrounding buffalo did not appear concerned over this
      impending battle. They were aware of it, for they would
      raise their shaggy heads from the grass and gaze a moment
      at the king and his jealous aspirant. Then they would
      return to their feeding. It was noticeable, however, that
      the circle did not narrow; if anything, it gradually
      widened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king did not wait for his foe to begin the struggle. He
      charged. His dash was incredibly fast for so heavy a beast
      and his momentum tremendous. Square against the lowered
      head of the young bull he struck. The shock sent forth a
      sodden crash. The bull staggered under the impact. His
      whole bulk shook. Then he was lifted, head up, forefeet off
      the ground, higher, and with grinding clash of horns he was
      hurled heavily upon his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the great force of that charge the old monarch went
      to his knees, and the advantage which might have been his
      was lost. He heaved in his rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nimbly the young bull rolled over and bounded to his feet,
      unhurt. Nature had by this time developed him to a perfect
      resisting force. His front was all bone, covered by matted
      hair. Swifter than a horse, as quick as a cat, he launched
      his bulk at his antagonist, and hit him with a shock no
      less terrific than the one that had opened the battle. But
      the old warrior received it as if he had been a great oak
      rooted in the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with heads pounding and horns grinding, these beasts,
      relentless as nature itself, settled down to the wonderful
      and incredible battle of buffalo bulls. Bent and bowed,
      always head to head, they performed prodigious feats of
      ramming and butting, and endeavoring to give each other a
      fatal thrust with horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      But under that heavy mat of wool was skin over an inch
      thick and tougher than hardened leather. These bulls were
      made to fight. They had extraordinary lung capacity and
      very large nostrils. Their endurance was as remarkable as
      their physical structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a cloud of dust they plowed up the prairie, driving the
      grazing buffalo back and forth, and covering acres of
      ground in their struggle. The crash of heads and rattle of
      horns gradually diminished in vigor of sound, indicating
      that the speed and strength of the rivals were wearing
      down. Not so their ferocity and courage! It was a battle to
      death or complete vanquishment. In time the dust cloud blew
      away on the wind, and then the bulls could be seen in
      action less strenuous but still savage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old monarch was near the end of his last battle. His
      race was run. Torn and dirt-covered and bloody, he backed
      before the onslaughts of his foe. His lungs, like great
      bellows, sent out gasps that were as well utterances of
      defeat. He could not withstand the relentless young bull.
      Age must go down. He was pushed to his knees and almost
      bowled over. Recovering, he wearily fronted that huge
      battering black head, and then was shoved to his haunches.
      Again, narrowly, he escaped the following lunge. That was
      the moment of defeat. He was beaten. The instinct for life
      took the place of the instinct for supremacy. Backward,
      step by step, he went, always facing the bellowing young
      conqueror. There came intervals when he was free of that
      lowered battering head; and during the last of these he
      sheered away among the stragglers of the herd, leaving the
      field to the victor. The old monarch had retired to the
      ranks and there was a new leader of the herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eagle soared back to his lonely perch, there to clutch
      the crag with his talons and sweep the valley with crystal
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out to the front of the black mass of buffalo a whirlwind
      twisted up a column of dust. Funnel-shaped it rose, yellow
      and spreading, into the air, while it raced across the
      valley. That, or something as natural, stirred a movement
      in the fore-ranks of buffalo. All at once the leaders broke
      into a run, heading south. The movement, and the growing
      pound of their hoofs, ran through the herd as swiftly as a
      current. Then, magically and wondrously, the whole immense
      mass moved as if one spirit, one mind, dominated it. The
      throbbing pound of hoofs suddenly increased to a roar. Dust
      began to rise and blow back, like low clouds of yellow
      smoke, over the acres, and then the miles of bobbing black
      backs. The vast herd seemed to become a sea in swift and
      accelerating action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon a rising pall of dust shrouded the thousands of
      buffalo, running under what seemed an obscure curtain. The
      volume of sound had swelled from rhythmic pound and beat to
      a mighty and appalling roar. Only the battlements of the
      upper air, assailed in storm by the ripping of lightning,
      could send back such thunder as now rose from the shaking
      earth. But this was one long continuous roll. The movement
      of buffalo in unison resembled a tidal wave and the sound
      was that of an avalanche. The ground trembled under the
      thundering herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eagle perched motionless on his crag, indifferent to
      the rolling chaos beneath him. The valley-wide cloud of
      dust floated low down. Time passed. Halfway to the zenith
      rose the sun. Then gradually the tremor of the earth and
      the roar of hoofs diminished, rolled, and died away. The
      herd had passed. On his lofty perch the eagle slept, and
      the valley cleared of dust and movement. Solitude,
      loneliness, and silence reigned at the solemn noontide.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was spring of an era many years after the lone eagle had
      watched the buffalo herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      An upland prairie country rolled and waved down from
      snow-capped Rocky Mountains to spread out into the immense
      eastern void. Over the bleached white grass had come a
      faint tinge of green. The warm sun had begun its renewal of
      the covering of the earth. A flock of wild geese, late on
      their annual pilgrimage, winged swift flight toward the
      northland. On the ridges elk grazed, and down in the
      hollows, where murmuring streams rushed, clouded with the
      blue color of melted snow, deer nibbled at the new tender
      shoots of grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below the uplands, where the plain began, herds of buffalo
      dotted the patches and streaked the monotony of the gray
      vastness. Leagues and leagues it spread, always darker for
      the increase of buffalo, until all was a dense black that
      merged into the haze of distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A river wended its curving way out across the plains, and
      in a wooded bend an Indian encampment showed its white
      tepees, and red blankets, and columns of blue smoke lazily
      rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hidden in the brush along the river half-naked red men lay
      in wait for the buffalo to come down to drink. These
      hunters did not need to sally forth for their game. They
      had only to wait and choose the meat and the hide that best
      served them for their simple needs. They did not kill more
      than they could use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the river bank, far as eye could see, the shaggy
      monsters trooped down to drink. Bulls and cows and calves
      came in endless procession. In some places, where the bank
      was steep, the thirsty buffalo behind pushed the row ahead
      into the water, whence rose a splashing <i>mêlée.</i> The
      tawny calves, still too young to shed their coats and turn
      the seal brown of their mothers, bawled lustily as they
      were shoved into the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the encampment of the Indians, where trees and brush
      lined the shore, the buffalo were more wary. They liked the
      open. But stragglers came along, and the choicest of these
      fell prey to the deadly arrows of the red men. A shaggy
      young bull, sleek and brown, superb in his approaching
      maturity, passed within range of the chieftain of that
      hunting clan. He rose from his covert, a lean, dark Indian,
      tall and powerful of build, with intense face and piercing
      eyes turned toward his quarry. He bent a bow few Indians
      could have drawn. He bent it till the flint head of the
      arrow touched his left hand. Then he released the arrow.
      Like a glint of light it flashed and, striking the bull
      behind the shoulder, buried half its length there. The
      animal grunted. He made no violent movements. He walked
      back as he had come, only more and more slowly. The chief
      followed him out to the edge of the timber. There other
      buffalo coming in saw both Indian and wounded bull, but
      they only swerved aside. The bull halted, and heaving
      heavily, he plunged to his knees, and then rolled over on
      his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the hunters came the squaws, with their crude flint
      and bone implements, to skin the buffalo and cut up the
      meat and pack it to the encampment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the chief repaired to rest on his buffalo hide under
      a tree, and to think the thoughts and dream the dreams of
      the warrior. Beyond the white-peaked mountain range lived
      enemies of his, red men of a hated tribe. Other than
      remembrance of them he had no concern. His red gods could
      not tell him of the future. The paleface, who was to drive
      him and his people into the fastnesses of the arid hills,
      was unknown and undreamed of. Into his lofty serene mind no
      thought flashed of a vanishing of the buffalo while yet his
      descendants lived. The buffalo were as many as the sands of
      the river bottoms. They had always been; they would always
      be. The buffalo existed to furnish food, raiment, shelter
      for the red man.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the chief rested in his camp, watching beaver at work on
      the river bank, as tame as were the buffalo. Like these
      animals, he and his tribe were happy and self-sufficient.
      Only infrequent battles with other tribes marred the
      serenity of their lives. Always the endless herds were to
      be found, to the south or the north. This chief worshiped
      the sun, loved his people and the wild, lonely land he
      believed was his; and if there was in his tribe a brave who
      was liar or coward or thief, or a squaw who broke the law,
      death was his or her portion.

      A straggling band of white men wearily rode and tramped
      across the great plains centuries before that wonderful
      level prairie was to be divided into the Western states of
      America.
    </p>
    <p>
      These white travelers were the Spanish explorers under the
      command of the intrepid Coronado. It was a large band. Many
      of them rode horses--Arabian horses of the purest breed,
      from which the Western mustang was descended. But most of
      them walked, wearing queer apparel and armor not suitable
      to such arduous travel. They carried strange weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardy, indomitable, and enduring, this first band of white
      men to penetrate the great plains and the deserts of the
      South and West, recorded for history something of their
      marvelous adventures and terrible experiences and strange
      sights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many hundreds of leagues they traveled, according to their
      historian, Castaneda, over tremendous plains and reaches of
      sand, stark and level, and so barren of trees and stones
      that they erected heaps of the ox dung they found, so that
      they could be guided back by the way they had come. They
      lost horses and men.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way across these great plains of grass and sand the
      Spaniards encountered herds of crooked-back oxen, as many
      as there were sheep in Spain. But they saw no people with
      the crooked-back cattle. These weary and lost travelers,
      almost starved, found in the oxen succor they so grievously
      needed. Meat gave them strength and courage to go on
      through obstacles none save crusaders could have overcome.
      Sometimes in this strange country it rained great showers
      of hailstones as big as oranges; and these storms caused
      many tears and injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Castaneda wrote:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      These oxen are the bigness and color of our bulls. . . .
      They have a great bunch of hair on their fore shoulders,
      and more on their fore part than their hinder part, and it
      is like wool. They have a horse-mane upon their backbone,
      and much hair, and very long from their knees downward.
      They have great tufts of hair hanging down their foreheads,
      and it seemeth they have beards because of the great store
      of hair hanging down at their chins and throats. The males
      have very large tails, and a great knob or flock at the
      end, so that in some respects they resemble the lion, and
      in some others the camel. They push with their horns; they
      run; they overtake and kill a horse when they are in their
      rage and anger. The horses fled from them, either because
      of their deformed shape, or else because they had never
      before seen them. Finally it is a foul and fierce beast of
      countenance and form of body.

    <p>
      All during Tom Doan's boyhood, before and through the
      stirring years of the Rebellion, he had been slowly
      yielding to the call that had made so many young men
      adventurers and pioneers in the Southwest.
    </p>
    <p>
      His home had not been a happy one, but as long as his
      mother lived and his sisters remained unmarried he had
      stayed there, getting what education there was available at
      the little Kansas village school, and working hard on the
      farm. When Kansas refused to secede to the South at the
      beginning of the Rebellion, Tom's father, who was a rebel,
      joined Quantrill's notorious band of guerillas. Tom's
      sisters were in sympathy with the South. But Tom and his
      mother held open leaning toward the North. It was a divided
      family. Eventually the girls married and left home. Tom's
      mother did not long survive her husband, who was shot on
      one of Quantrill's raids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom outlived the sadness and bitterness of his youth, but
      they left their mark upon him. His loyalty to his mother
      had alone kept him from the wildness of the time, and their
      poverty had made hard work imperative. After the war he
      drifted from place to place, always farther and farther
      toward the unsettled country. He had pioneer blood in him,
      and in his mind he had settled the future. He meant to be a
      rancher, a tiller of the soil, a stockman and a breeder of
      horses, for these things he loved. Yet always there was in
      him the urge to see the frontier, to be in the thick of
      wild life while he was hunting and exploring for that
      wonderful land which would content him. Thus Tom Doan had
      in him a perfect blending of the dual spirit that burned in
      the hearts of thousands of men, and which eventually opened
      up the West to civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not, however, until the autumn of 1874 did he surrender to
      the call. The summer of that year had been a momentous one
      in the Southwest. Even in years of stress this one stood
      out as remarkable, and the tales drifting up from the
      frontier had thrilled Tom's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      A horde of buffalo-hunters, lured by the wild life and the
      development of a commercial market for buffalo hides, had
      braved the Indians in their haunts and started after the
      last great herds. This had resulted in an Indian war. The
      Cheyennes, Kiowas, Arapahoes, and the Comanches had gone on
      the war-path. A thousand warriors of these tribes had made
      the memorable siege of a small band of buffalo-hunters and
      their soldier escort, and after repeated and persistent
      charges had been repulsed. The tale of this battle was
      singularly thrilling to Tom Doan. Particularly had the
      hunting of buffalo appealed to him. Not that he had ever
      hunted a buffalo, for in fact he had never seen one. But
      stories told him as a boy had fixed themselves in his mind,
      never to be effaced.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Early spring found Tom Doan arriving at the outfitting post
      from which an army of buffalo-hunters were preparing to
      leave for the long haul to the south.
    </p>
    <p>
      The atmosphere of this frontier fort and freighting station
      was new to Tom, and affected him deeply. The stir of
      youthful love of wild tales was here revived. At a step,
      almost, he had found himself on the threshold of the
      frontier. Huge freighting wagons, some with six horses
      attached, and loaded with piles and bales of green buffalo
      hides, lumbered in from the level prairie land. The wide
      main street of the town presented a continual procession of
      men and women, mostly in rough garb of travel, and all
      intent on the mysterious something that seemed to be in the
      air. There was a plentiful sprinkling of soldiers, and
      pale-faced, frock-coated gamblers, and many stylishly
      dressed women who had a too friendly look, Tom thought.
      There were places of amusement, saloons and dance halls,
      that Tom found a peep into sufficient. Dust lay inches deep
      in the street, and the horses passing along continually
      raised clouds of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The camp on the outskirts of this town soon drew Tom. Here,
      ranged all around, it appeared, were the outfits of the
      buffalo-hunters, getting ready to travel south. Tom meant
      to cast his lot with one of them, but the tales he had
      heard about the character of some of these outfits made him
      decide to be careful. According to rumor some of them were
      as bad as the Comanches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first man Tom accosted was a tall, rugged, bronzed
      Westerner, with a stubby red beard on his lean face. He was
      encamped under a cottonwood, just bursting into green, and
      on the moment was busy jacking up the hind wheel of his
      huge canvas-covered wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll give you a lift," offered Tom, and with one heave he
      raised the rear end of the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal!" ejaculated the Westerner, as he rapidly worked up
      his jack to meet the discrepancy occasioned by Tom's lift.
      "Reckon you're husky, stranger. Much obliged."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom helped him complete the job of greasing the wagon
      wheels and then asked him if he were a buffalo-hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am thet," he replied. "An' what're you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've come to join one of the outfits. Are there really
      good wages to be made?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, you are new heahaboots," returned the other,
      grinning. "My early fall hunt netted me five hundred
      dollars. Late fall then I made four hundred. An' this
      winter I hunted down on the Brazos, cleanin' up six hundred
      an' eighty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was amazed and excited over this specific information,
      direct from the hunting grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that's wonderful!" he replied. "A fellow can make
      enough to buy and stock a ranch. Did you have a helper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore--my two boys, an' I paid them wages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much?" inquired Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty-five a month. Are you lookin' fer a job?" rejoined
      the Westerner, with an appreciative glance at Tom's broad
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but not for such wages as that. I'd like to go in for
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the way to do, if you can buy your own outfit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon inquiry Tom found that outfits were high, and with his
      small savings he could hardly hope to purchase even an
      interest in one. It would be necessary for him to hire out
      to the best advantage, and save his earnings toward buying
      horses, wagon, and equipment for himself. Nevertheless,
      opportunity seemed indeed knocking at his door. The rewards
      of buffalo-hunting, as set forth by the Westerner, were
      great enough to fire the blood of any young man. Tom
      experienced a sudden lift of his heart; a new and strong
      tide surged through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the road Tom came to a small grove of
      cottonwoods, just beyond the edge of the town; and here he
      caught the gleam of more canvas-covered vehicles. He found
      three outfits camped there, apart from one another, and the
      largest one was composed of several wagons. A camp fire was
      burning. The smell of wood smoke assailed Tom's nostrils
      with more than pleasurable sense. It brought pictures of
      wild places and camp by lonely streams. A sturdy woman was
      bending over a washtub. Tom caught a glimpse of a girl's
      rather comely face peering out of the front of a wagon. Two
      young men were engaged at shoeing a horse. Under a
      cottonwood two men sat on a roll of bedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Tom entered the grove one of the men rose to a lofty
      stature and showed himself to be built in proportion. He
      appeared past middle age, but was well preserved and
      possessed a bearded, jovial face, with frank blue eyes that
      fastened curiously upon Tom. The other man had remarkable
      features--sharp, hard, stern, set like a rock. Down his
      lean brown cheeks ran deep furrows and his eyes seemed
      narrowed inside wrinkled folds. They were gray eyes, light
      and singularly piercing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had an impression that this was a real plainsman. The
      giant seemed a man of tremendous force. Quick to form his
      likes or dislikes, Tom lost no time here in declaring
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name's Tom Doan," he said. "I want a job with a
      buffalo-hunter's outfit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to meet you. I'm Clark Hudnall, an' this is my
      friend, Jude Pilchuck," replied the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon both men shook hands with Tom and showed the
      interest common to the time and place. Hudnall's glance was
      a frank consideration of Tom's stalwart form and beardless
      face. Pilchuck's was a keen scrutiny associated with
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doan. Was your father Bill Doan, who rode with Quantrill?"
      he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--he was," returned Tom, somewhat disconcerted by this
      unexpected query.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew your father. You favor him, only you're lighter
      complexioned. He was a hard rider and a hard shooter. . . .
      You were a boy when he got--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was fifteen," said Tom, as the other hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you on your dad's side?" asked Hudnall, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I was for the North," returned Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, them days were tough," sighed Hudnall, as if
      he remembered trials of his own. Then he quickened with
      interest. "We need a man an' I like your looks. Have you
      any hankerin' for red liquor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever hunt buffalo?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you shoot well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was always a good shot. Have hunted deer and small game
      a good deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your idea--throwin' in with a hide-hunter's
      outfit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom hesitated a moment over that query, and then frankly
      told the truth about his rather complicated longings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudnall laughed, and was impressed to the point of placing
      a kind hand on Tom's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young man, I'm glad you told me that," he said. "Back of
      my own reason for riskin' so much in this hide-huntin' is
      my need to make money quick, an' I've got to have a ranch.
      So we're two of a kind. You're welcome to cast in your lot
      with us. Shake on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tom felt the mighty grip of a calloused hand that had
      known the plow and the ax. Pilchuck likewise offered to
      shake hands with Tom, and expressed himself no less
      forcibly than Hudnall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon it's a good deal on both sides," he said. "The
      right kind of men are scarce. I know this buffalo-huntin'.
      It's a hard game. An' if skinnin' hides isn't tougher than
      diggin' coal, then I was a meathunter on the U. P. an' the
      Santa Fe for nothin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudnall called the two younger men from their task of
      shoeing the horse. Both appeared under thirty, stocky
      fellows, but there the resemblance ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Burn, shake hands with Tom Doan," said Hudnall, heartily.
      "An' you, too, Stronghurl. . . . Doan is goin' to throw in
      with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both men greeted Tom with the cordial good will and
      curiosity natural to an event of importance to them. It was
      evident that Burn, from his resemblance to Hudnall, was a
      son. Stronghurl had as remarkable a physiognomy as his
      name, and somehow they fitted each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Burn, you'll take Doan with your wagon," said Hudnall.
      "That fills our outfit, an' we'll be pullin' to-morrow for
      the Panhandle. . . . Hey, you women folks," he called
      toward the wagons, "come out an' meet my new man."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stout woman left off washing at the tub and came
      forward, wiping her red hands on her apron. She had a
      serious face that lighted with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wife, this is Tom Doan," went on Hudnall, and next in
      order he presented Tom to Burn's wife, whom Tom recognized
      as the young woman he had seen in the wagon. Last to emerge
      was a girl of eighteen or thereabouts, sister of Burn and
      manifestly Hudnall's pride. She was of large frame,
      pleasant faced, and she had roguish eyes that took instant
      stock of Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus almost before he could realize his good fortune, Tom
      found himself settled with people of his own kind, whom he
      liked on sight. Moreover, Hudnall had the same pioneer urge
      which possessed Tom; and the fact that Pilchuck, an old
      buffalo-hunter, was to accompany them down into Texas, just
      about made the deal perfect. To be sure, Tom had not
      mentioned wages or shares, but he felt that he could safely
      trust Hudnall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's your pack?" inquired Burn. "An' what have you got
      in the way of outfit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I left it at the station," replied Tom. "Not much of an
      outfit. A bag of clothes and a valise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nary horse or gun. Have you any money?" went on Burn, with
      cheerful interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got two hundred dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Soon as we get this horse shod I'll go uptown with
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, son," spoke up Hudnall, "I reckon Tom had better let
      Pilchuck buy gun an' horse an' what else he needs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" ejaculated Mrs. Hudnall. "If I know men you'll all
      have a say about horses an' guns."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Doan, wouldn't you like me to help you pick out that
      horse?" inquired Burn's sister, mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes," replied Tom, joining in the laugh. "I'd like
      you all to help--so long as I get one I can ride."
    </p>
    <p>
      The women returned to their tasks while Hudnall went off
      with Pilchuck toward the town. Left to his own devices, Tom
      presently joined Burn and Stronghurl, who were not having
      any easy job shoeing the horse. It was a spirited animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doan, would you mind fetchin' that bay horse back?" asked
      Burn, presently pointing toward the other side of the
      grove, where several canvas-covered wagons gleamed among
      the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom picked up a halter and strode away under the trees, at
      once pleasantly preoccupied with thought of the most
      satisfying nature. He came up with the bay horse, which he
      found eating out of a girl's hand. Tom saw and heard other
      people close by, but he did not notice them particularly.
      Intent on the horse, he did not take a second glance at the
      girl, until she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've caught your horse twice to-day," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much obliged. But he's not mine," replied Tom, and as he
      put the halter over the neck of the animal he looked at the
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes met his. They were large, black as midnight, and
      they gazed up from a face almost as dark as an Indian's.
      Her hair was brown and appeared to have a sheen or light
      upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom's glance became what hers was--steady, almost a stare
      without consciousness, a look of depth and gravity for
      which neither was responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tom withdrew his glance and attended to knotting the
      halter. Yet he could see her still. She was of medium
      height, neither robust nor heavy, yet giving an impression
      of unusual strength and suppleness for a girl. She was
      young. Her dress of homespun material looked the worse for
      wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a pretty horse," she said, patting the sleek nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he is. I hope the horse I've got to buy will be like
      him," replied Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you a buffalo-killer, too?" she inquired, in quicker
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milly," called a gruff voice, "you're not a hoss thief and
      you're not makin' up with strangers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom turned hastily to see a big man looming across the camp
      fire. He wore a leather apron and carried a hammer in his
      brawny hand. It was impossible that this blond giant could
      be the girl's father. Even in that moment of surprise and
      annoyance Tom felt glad of this conviction. The man's face
      bore a thin yellow beard that could not hide its coarseness
      and brutality. He had bright, hard blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me," said Tom, stiffly. "I had to come after Mr.
      Hudnall's horse." Then turning to the girl, he thanked her.
      This time her eyes were cast down. Tom abruptly started
      off, leading the animal.

    <p>
      It did not occur to him that there was anything significant
      about the incident, except a little irritation at the
      coarse speech and appearance of the blond man.
      Nevertheless, that part of it slipped from his mind, and
      the vague, somehow pleasurable impression of the girl
      persisted until the serious and thrilling business of
      choosing horse and gun precluded all else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that Hudnall and his men left off work, and
      Pilchuck insisted on being the arbiter of these selections,
      attested to the prime importance with which they regarded
      the matter. Hudnall argued with Pilchuck that he knew the
      merits of horses as well as the latter knew guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they journeyed into town, up the dusty motley-crowded
      street, rubbing elbows with Indians, soldiers, hunters,
      scouts, teamsters, men who bore the stamp of evil life upon
      their lean faces, and women with the eyes of hawks.
      Pilchuck knew almost everybody, it seemed. He pointed out
      many border celebrities to Tom's keen interest. One was
      Colonel Jones, a noted plainsman, who in the near future
      was to earn the sobriquet "Buffalo Jones," not like his
      contemporary, Buffalo Bill, for destroying buffalo, but for
      preserving calves to form the nucleus of a herd. Another,
      and the most striking figure of a man Tom had ever seen,
      was Wild Bill, perhaps the most noted of all frontiersmen.
      He was a superb giant of a man, picturesquely clad,
      straight as an Indian, with a handsome face, still,
      intense, wonderful in its expression of the wild spirit
      that had made him great. Tom thought he had never before
      seen such penetrating, alert eyes. Pilchuck mentioned
      casually that not long since, Wild Bill had fought and
      killed twelve men in a dugout cabin on the plains. Bill got
      shot and cut to pieces, but recovered. Tom was far from
      being a tenderfoot, yet he gaped at these strange, heroic
      men, and thrilled to his depths. Seeing them face to face
      stimulated and liberated something deep in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supply store where Pilchuck conducted Tom and the
      others was full of purchasers, and except for absence of
      liquors in bottles it resembled a border barroom. It
      smelled of tobacco in bulk; and Tom saw shelves and stacks
      of plug tobacco in such enormous quantity that he marveled
      to Hudnall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Golly! man, we gotta have chaw tobacco," replied that
      worthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A counter littered with a formidable array of guns and
      knives appeared to be Pilchuck's objective point.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We want a big fifty," he said to the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's only one left an' it ain't new," replied this
      individual, as he picked up a heavy gun. It was a
      fifty-caliber Sharps rifle. Pilchuck examined it and then
      handed it over to Tom. "I've seen better big fifties, but
      it'll do for a while. . . . Next you want a belt an' all
      the cartridges you can lug, an' both rippin' an' skinnin'
      knives."
    </p>
    <p>
      When these purchases were made Tom had indeed about all he
      could carry. Hudnall then ordered the supplies needed for
      his outfit, and when that was accomplished Pilchuck led
      them down the street to the outskirts of town, where there
      was a corral full of dusty, vicious, kicking horses. It
      took an hour for Pilchuck and Hudnall to agree on a horse
      that Tom could ride. Having been a farm hand all his days,
      Tom was a good horseman, but he was not a bronco-buster.
      Finally the selection was made of horse, saddle, bridle,
      blanket, and spurs. When this purchase was paid for Tom
      laughed at the little money he had left.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things come high, an' they ain't worth it," complained
      Pilchuck. "But we haven't any choice. That's a good
      horse--young enough, strong, easy gait, but he never saw a
      buffalo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of that?" asked Tom, with a little check to his
      elation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothin'. Only the first buffalo he sees will decide a
      lot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom regarded this rather ambiguous remark with considerable
      misgiving and made a mental note of it, so he would not
      forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      What with their purchases, and Tom's baggage, which they
      got at the station, the party had about all they could take
      back to camp. The afternoon then was a busy one for all
      concerned. Tom donned rough garb and heavy boots, suitable
      to life in the open. The change was not made without
      perception of an indefinable shifting in his spirit. He was
      about to face the perils of the frontier, and serious and
      thoughtful as he endeavored to make himself, he could not
      repress an eager, wild response. He tried out his horse,
      which he named Dusty, because at that time nothing but a
      bath could have removed the dust from him. Dusty gave a
      creditable performance and won the approval of all save
      Pilchuck. Hudnall, and his daughter Sally, particularly
      liked the horse. Tom saw that he could sell or trade at his
      discretion, and so for the time was well pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the afternoon he spent helping Burn Hudnall
      arrange and pack the big wagon that was to transport their
      precious outfit, and later, out on the plains, haul the
      hides they expected to get.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was tellin' father I'd like to pick up a boy somewhere,"
      said Burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?" inquired Tom. "We can take care of this
      outfit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, for the present. But when we get out among the
      buffalo we'll need some one to drive the wagon an' keep
      camp while we chase an' kill an' skin buffalo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. Then the idea will be a main camp kept by your
      father, and the rest of us in pairs with wagons and outfits
      will range all over?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon that's Pilchuck's idea. From what I can gather
      there'll be a lot of hustlin' an' movin' when we strike the
      herds of buffalo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think it'd be a chase with no time for camp,"
      said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon so. Anyways we're bound to know soon," replied
      Burn, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sunset Tom heard the cheery call of the women folk to
      supper; and he was not far behind Burn in getting to the
      table, which was a canvas spread on the ground. They all
      appeared hungry. Hudnall loaded his tin plate, filled his
      cup, and then repaired to the wagon, and set his supper
      upon the seat. He was too big to squat on the ground,
      cross-legged and Indian fashion, but his stature enabled
      him to stand and eat from the wagon seat. Pilchuck, too,
      had his peculiar habit. He set his plate down, and knelt on
      one knee to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all excited, except Pilchuck, and though this in
      no wise distracted from a satisfying of hunger, it lent a
      sparkle and jollity to the occasion. Tom was not alone in
      having cut away from the humdrum of settled communities and
      in cherishing dreams of untrammeled country and future home
      and prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper he again walked into the town, purposely going
      alone. He did not pry into his reason. This third visit to
      the main street did not satisfy his vague longing, whatever
      it was, and he retraced his steps campward.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the end of the street passers-by became
      scarce, and for that reason more noticeable. But Tom did
      not pay attention to any one until he heard a girl's voice.
      It came from behind him and had a note of annoyance, even
      anger. A man's reply, too low and husky for coherence, made
      Tom turn quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young woman carrying a heavy parcel was approaching, a
      step or two in advance of a man. It required only a glance
      to see that she was trying to get away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom strode to meet her, and recognized the girl with whom
      he had exchanged words at the camp adjoining Hudnall's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that fellow bothering you?" demanded Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He insulted me," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom broke into swift strides toward the offender.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, you!" he called, forcibly. But the man hurried away,
      at a pace that would have necessitated running to catch
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind. Let him go," said the girl, with a little
      laugh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This town is full of ruffians. You should not have come in
      alone," was Tom's reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. It's happened before. I wasn't afraid--but I'm
      glad you came along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That package looks heavy. Let me carry it," offered Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, I can manage very well," she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he took it away from her, and in so doing touched her
      hand. The effect on Tom was sudden and profound. For the
      moment it destroyed his naturalness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I--it is heavy--for a girl," he said, awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm very strong," she rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then their eyes met again, as they had when Tom had reached
      for the horse and looked at her. Only this time it seemed
      vastly different. She looked away, across the open toward
      the grove where fires gleamed in the gathering twilight.
      Then she moved. Tom fell into step beside her. He wanted to
      talk, but seemed unable to think of anything to say. This
      meeting was not an ordinary incident. He could not
      understand himself. He wanted to ask her about who she was,
      where she was going, what relation she bore to the rude man
      who had called her Milly. Yet not a word could he utter. He
      could have spoken surely, if he had not been concentrating
      on the vagueness and uncertainty of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they had quite reached the edge of the grove she
      stopped and confronted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," she said, softly. "I'll carry it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. We're still a long distance from your camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--that's why," she returned, haltingly. "You must not
      go with me. . . . He--my step-father, you heard him. I--I
      can't tell you more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom did not yield up the parcel with very good grace. "I
      may never see you again!" he burst out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, but as she relieved him of the package
      she looked up, straight and clear into his face. Her eyes
      held him. In them he read the same thought he had just
      exclaimed aloud. Then she bade him good night, and turning
      away, vanished in the gloom of the grove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until she was gone did Tom awake to a realization that
      this chance meeting, apparently so natural on her part and
      kindly on his, just an incident of travel, two strangers
      exchanging a few civilities, was the most significant and
      appealing and thought-provoking experience of his life. Why
      had he not detained her, just a moment, to ask for the
      privilege of seeing her again? Still, he could see her
      to-morrow. That last look of her big black eyes--what did
      it mean? His mind revolved many useless questions. He found
      a seat at the edge of the grove and there he pondered.
      Night came, dark and cool. The stars shone. Behind him
      sounded the crackle of camp fires and the voices of men and
      the munch of horses at their grain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange thing had happened to him, but what was it? A
      girl's eyes, a few words, a touch of hands! Had they been
      the cause of this sudden melancholy one moment and
      inexplicable exaltation the next, and his curiosity about
      her, and this delving into himself? But he did not call it
      silly or foolish. Tom was twenty-four years old, yet this
      condition of mind was new. Perhaps the thrill, the
      excitement of the prospects ahead, had communicated
      themselves to an otherwise ordinary incident. The thought,
      however, he ridiculed. Every moment of his musing tended
      toward consciousness of a strange, dreamy sweetness
      inspired by this girl.

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When Tom roused next morning to Burn Hudnall's cheery call
      he found that he had slept later than usual for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rolled out of his bed of blankets under the wagon, and
      pulling on his boots and washing his face and hands, was
      ready for breakfast and the eventful day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had just risen above the eastern horizon. West and
      southwest the rolling prairie-land shone green and gold
      under the bright morning light. Near at hand horses and
      cattle grazed. Far down the clearly defined road
      canvas-covered wagons gleamed white. Some of the
      buffalo-hunters were already on their way. Tom stood a
      moment, watching and thinking, as he drew a deep full
      breath of the fresh crisp air, feeling that whatever lay in
      store for him beyond the purple horizon--adventure,
      hardship, fortune--he was keen to face it.
    </p>
    <p>
      While at breakfast Tom suddenly remembered his meeting with
      the girl, Milly. In the broad light of day he did not feel
      quite the same as in the gloaming of last night. Yet a
      sweetness stole pervadingly upon him. Glancing through the
      grove toward the camp where the first meeting with her had
      taken place, he missed the white wagons. That end of the
      grove was empty. The wagons were gone--and with them the
      girl. Tom experienced a blankness of thought, then a sense
      of loss and a twinge of regret. After this moment he
      thoughtfully went on eating his breakfast. Nothing was to
      come of the meeting. Still, her people were
      buffalo-hunters, too, and somewhere down in that wild
      country he might see her again. What a forlorn hope! Yet by
      cherishing it he reconciled himself to the fact that she
      was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast his curiosity led him to walk over to where
      her camp had been; and he trailed the wagon tracks out into
      the road, seeing that they headed toward the southwest. His
      grain of comfort gathered strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our neighbors pulled out early," he remarked, halting
      where Pilchuck and Hudnall were packing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Long before sunup," replied Hudnall. "Did you hear them,
      Jude?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh! They'd waked the dead," growled Pilchuck. "Reckon
      Randall Jett had his reason for pullin' out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jett? Let's see. He was the man with the yellow beard.
      Come to think of it, he wasn't very civil."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard some talk about Jett uptown," went on Pilchuck.
      "'Pears I've met him somewheres, but it's slipped my mind.
      He's one of the hide-hunters that's got a doubt hangin' on
      him. Just doubt, it's only fair to say. Nobody knows
      anythin'. Jett has come out of the Panhandle twice with
      thousands of hides. He's made money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's interestin'," replied Hudnall. "He's just
      been married. My wife had some talk yesterday with a woman
      who must have been Mrs. Jett. She was from Missouri an' had
      a grown daughter. Married a few weeks, she said. My wife
      got a hunch this woman an' daughter weren't keen about the
      hide-huntin' business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, when you get down on the Staked Plains, you'll
      appreciate Mrs. Jett's feelings," remarked Pilchuck, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom listened to this talk, much interested, recording it in
      memory. Then he asked if all the buffalo-hunters followed
      the same line of travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon they do," replied Pilchuck. "There's only one good
      road for a couple of hundred miles. Then the hunters make
      their own roads."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do they scatter all over the plains?" went on Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, naturally they hang round the buffalo. But that herd
      is most as big as the Staked Plains."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had no knowledge of this particular part of Texas, but
      he did not fail to get a conception of magnitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When do we pull out?" he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soon as we hitch up."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In less than an hour the Hudnall outfit, with three good
      wagons drawn by strong teams, were on the move. The women
      rode with the drivers. Tom had the job of keeping the
      saddle horses in line. They did not want to head out into
      the wilderness, and on the start were contrary. After a few
      miles, however, they settled down to a trot and kept to the
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the gleam of the town, and groves of trees, and
      columns of smoke, disappeared behind a rolling ridge, and
      all around appeared endless gray-green plain, bisected by a
      white road. No other wagons were in sight. Tom found the
      gait of his horse qualified to make long rides endurable.
      The lonely land was much to his liking. Jack-rabbits and
      birds were remarkable for their scarcity. The plain
      appeared endlessly undulating, a lonesome expanse, mostly
      gray, stretching away on all sides. The soil was good. Some
      day these wide lands would respond to cultivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hudnall outfit traveled steadily until about four
      o'clock in the afternoon, making about twenty-five miles. A
      halt was called in a grove of elm trees that had long
      appealed to Tom's eye. It amused him to see the amiable
      contention between Pilchuck and Hudnall. The former, like
      all guides and scouts long used to outdoor life, wanted to
      camp at the first available spot where others had camped.
      But Hudnall sought a fresh and untrammeled place, driving
      some distance off the road to a clean glade under spreading
      elms just beginning to green. A shallow creek ran under the
      high bank. Birds and rabbits were plentiful here, and cat
      and coyote tracks showed on the muddy shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was work for everybody and something of confusion.
      Further experience in making camp was essential before
      things could be done smoothly and expeditiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I laid out jobs for everybody. Now rustle," was Hudnall's
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The teams were unhitched and turned loose to drink and
      graze. Harness and collars were hung upon the front wheels.
      Tom scouted for firewood, which appeared plentiful, and the
      ring of his ax resounded through the glade. Hudnall and his
      son lifted the cook stove and mess box from a wagon, then
      the cooking utensils and tableware. A level spot was
      cleaned off, a fire started on the ground and also in the
      stove, then the meal preparations were turned over to the
      women. Hudnall erected a tent for himself and his wife.
      Sally's bed was made in the wagon. Pilchuck helped
      Stronghurl pitch a tent beside their wagon, but he spread
      his own bed, consisting of blankets on a tarpaulin, outside
      under the trees. Burn Hudnall put up a tent for himself and
      his wife, and Tom unrolled his bed under Burn's wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sunset they ate supper. The gold and pink of western sky
      appeared to send a reflection upon the winding stream of
      water. Everybody was hungry, and even Pilchuck seemed to
      feel something good in the hour and the place. If there had
      been any misgivings on the part of the women, they had now
      vanished. The talk was jolly and hopeful. Sally Hudnall
      made eyes at Tom, and then, seeing her advances were
      apparently unobserved, she tried the same upon Stronghurl.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper Tom chopped and carried wood for the camp fire
      that night and for next morning. This done, he strolled
      along the creek toward the grazing horses. Fresh green
      grass grew abundantly on the banks and insured reasonably
      against the horses' straying that night. Tom decided not to
      hobble Dusty.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hundred yards from camp the creek circled through a
      grove of larger elms and eddied in a deep pool. Here on a
      log Tom lingered and indulged in rest and musings. His
      thoughts seemed to flow and eddy like the stream, without
      any apparent reason. But when thought of the girl, Milly,
      recurred, it abided with him. Here in the solitude of this
      grove he seemed to remember more vividly, and after
      reviewing gravely all the details concerning her it seemed
      to him not improbable that she was unhappy and
      unfortunately situated. "I--I can't tell you more," she had
      said, hurriedly, in a tone he now realized held shame and
      fear. Tom meditated over that, and at the end of an hour,
      when dusk was creeping under the trees, he threw off the
      spell and retraced his steps toward camp. There was little
      chance of his ever seeing her again. With resignation to
      that, and the vague sadness attending it, he put her out of
      his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon a camp fire blazed through the dusk, and seen from
      afar, with the black shadows of men crossing its
      brightness, it made a telling picture. Tom joined the
      circle sitting and standing round it. The air had grown
      cold, making the warmth most agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That 'tarnal smoke follows me everywhere I turn," said
      Sally Hudnall, as she moved to a seat beside Stronghurl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elm wood ain't so good to burn," observed Pilchuck.
      "Neither is cottonwood. Smoke smells an' makes your eyes
      smart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary has a likin' for hickory," said Hudnall. "Golly! I'll
      bet I'll never again have apple pie baked over a hickory
      fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless you go back to Illinois," added his wife, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which'll never be, Mary," he replied, with finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      His words, tinged with a suggestion of failure back there
      in Illinois, checked conversation for a moment. They all
      had places dear to look back upon. Pioneers had to
      sacrifice much. Tom gazed at the circle of quiet faces with
      more realization and kindness. Buffalo-hunting was but to
      be an incident. It had dominated his thought. In the
      background of his mind, in the future, had been the idea of
      a ranch. With these people home and farm were paramount.
      Tom wondered if they were not starting out upon an
      ill-advised enterprise. Not to think of its peril!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Day by day the Hudnall outfit traveled over the prairie,
      sometimes west, and then south, yet in the main always
      southwest. They made from fifteen to twenty-five miles a
      day, according to condition of the road and favorable
      places to camp. Now and then they passed a freighting
      outfit of several wagons, heavily loaded with buffalo
      hides. The days passed into weeks, until Tom lost track of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down here on the great plains spring had surely come. All
      was green and beautiful. The monotony of the country had
      been broken up by streams winding away between wooded
      banks, yet the rolling level seemed to hold generally,
      viewed from afar. On clear mornings a gray heave of higher
      ground appeared to the south. What farther north had been
      an openness and sameness of country now assumed proportions
      vast and striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      One sunset, when halt was made for camp in an arroyo,
      Pilchuck waived his usual work and rode off up a slope.
      Reaching the summit, he dismounted and, elevating a short
      telescope, he looked long to the southward. Later, when he
      returned to the camp, all eyes fixed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See anythin'?" queried Hudnall, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom felt a thrill merely from the look of the scout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buffalo!" announced Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence. The women responded more
      quickly to this good news. Hudnall seemed slow and thick.
      Burn Hudnall threw down a billet of wood he had held in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buffalo!" he echoed, and the quick look of gladness he
      flashed upon his father proved how much he had been
      responsible for this trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many?" demanded Hudnall, with a long stride toward the
      scout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon I couldn't say, offhand," replied Pilchuck. "Herd
      is another day's ride south."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally Hudnall interrupted her father as he was about to
      speak again: "Oh, I'm crazy to see a herd of buffalo. Are
      there lots of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tolerable many," replied Pilchuck, with a look of
      professional pride. "Reckon this herd is about fifteen
      miles long an' three or four deep!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Hudnall let out a stentorian roar, and that was a
      signal for equally sincere if not so exuberant a rejoicing
      from the others.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Next day's travel was the longest Tom had ever endured. The
      ground was dusty, the sun hot, the miles interminable, and
      there appeared ahead only the gray-green stretch of plain,
      leading the eyes with false hopes. But at last, toward
      sunset, a fringe of winding foliage marked the course of a
      stream. It seemed a goal. Beyond that water the great herd
      of buffalo must be grazing. An hour more of weary travel
      over uneven prairie--for Pilchuck had turned off the road
      early that morning--brought the outfit down into a coulee,
      the wildest and most attractive camp site that had yet
      fallen to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom made short work of his camp duties that evening, and
      soon was climbing the highest ridge. He climbed fast in his
      eagerness. Abruptly, then, he reached the top and looking
      westward, suddenly became transfixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was setting in a golden flare that enveloped the
      wide plain below. Half a mile from where he stood was an
      immense herd of huge woolly beasts, wild and strange to his
      sight, yet unmistakably buffalo. Tom experienced the most
      tingling thrill of his life. What a wonderful spectacle! It
      was not at all what he had pictured from tales he had
      heard. This scene was beautiful; and the huge straggling
      bulls seemed the grandest of big game beasts. Thousands of
      buffalo! Tom reveled in his opportunity and made the most
      of it. He saw that the herd circled away out of sight
      beyond the other end of the ridge upon which he stood. Long
      he gazed, and felt that he would never forget his first
      sight of a buffalo herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon his return to camp he found that he was not the only
      one late for supper. Hudnall had been out with Pilchuck.
      Burn was on the moment coming in with his wife and sister,
      who were talking excitedly about what they had seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many did you see?" asked Hudnall, of Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I've no idea--all of five thousand--and I couldn't see
      the end of the herd," replied Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We saw ten thousand, an' that on the other side of the
      ridge from you," added Hudnall, tensely. His big eyes were
      alight and he seemed to look afar. Tom sensed that Hudnall
      had not responded to the wildness and beauty of the
      spectacle. He saw thousands of hides to sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon I heard shootin' down the river a couple of miles,"
      said Pilchuck. "There's another outfit on the trail. We'll
      be lucky if we don't run into a dozen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this the main herd you spoke of?" inquired Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. This is only a little bunch," returned Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hudnall broke up the colloquy. "Are you all daffy
      about buffalo? Supper's gettin' cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary, you'll be fryin' buffalo steak for me to-morrow
      night," rejoined her husband, gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper Hudnall called the men aside for the purpose
      of consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pilchuck an' me are pardners on this deal," he said.
      "We'll pay thirty cents a hide. That means skinnin',
      haulin' the hide to camp, an' peggin' it out. No difference
      who kills the buffalo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's more than you'll get paid by most outfits," added
      Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stronghurl and Burn agreed on that figure; and as for Tom
      he frankly admitted he thought thirty cents a hide was big
      pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh! Wait till you skin your first buffalo," said the
      scout, grinning. "You'll swear thirty dollars too little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my part of this deal is settled. I furnish supplies
      an' pay for hides," said Hudnall. "Jude here will boss the
      hunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much bossin'," said that individual. "We're a little
      farther south than I've hunted. I rode through here with
      some soldiers last fall, an' know the country. This bunch
      of buffalo is hangin' along the river. Reckon there's
      buffalo for miles. They'll hang around here, unless too
      many outfits get chasin' them. A good way to hunt is to
      catch them comin' to drink. Aim to hit behind the shoulder,
      an' shoot till he drops. Sometimes it takes two or three
      bullets, an' sometimes five on the old bulls. When you hunt
      out in the open you've got to ride like hell, chase them,
      an' keep shootin' till your cartridges are all gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's easy, an' ought to be heaps of fun," said Burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon so. An' don't forget it's dangerous. Keep out of
      their reach. The real hard work comes in skinnin' an'
      peggin' out. Before you get good enough at that to make
      three dollars a day, you'll be sick of the job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three dollars!" echoed Burn, in scorn. "I expect to make
      five times that much."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had much the same aspiration, but he did not voice it.
      Pilchuck looked amused and mysterious enough to restrain
      undue enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Finally--an' this is a hunch you want to take serious,"
      went on Pilchuck, lowering his voice so the women could not
      hear. "We might run on to Indians."
    </p>
    <p>
      That sobered all the listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last summer was bad an' fall was worse," he continued. "I
      don't know now how conditions are or what the Indians are
      doin.' Reckon somebody, hunters or soldiers, will happen
      along an' tell us. My belief is there'll be some tough
      fights this year. But, of course, the redskins can't be
      everywhere, an' these buffalo are thick an' range far. We
      may be lucky an' never see a Comanche. But we'll have to
      keep our eyes peeled all the time an' mustn't get far
      apart. If we see or hear of Indians, we'll move camp an'
      stand guard at night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jude, that's stranger talk than you've used yet,"
      responded Hudnall, in surprise and concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon so. I'm not worryin.' I'm just tellin' you.
      There'll be a heap of hunters in here this summer. An' like
      as not the soldiers will see what women there are safe to
      the fort or some well-protected freightin' post."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom thought of the dark-eyed girl, Milly. Almost he had
      forgotten. How long ago that meeting seemed! Where was she
      now? He convinced himself that Pilchuck's assurance of the
      protection of soldiers applied to all the women who might
      be with the hunting bands.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more was said about Indians. Interest reverted strongly
      to the proposed hunt to begin on the morrow. Tom fell in
      with the spirit of the hour and stayed up late round the
      camp fire, listening to the talk and joining in. Once their
      animated discussion was silenced by a mournful howl from
      the ridge-top where Tom had climbed to see the buffalo. It
      was a strange sound, deep and prolonged, like the bay of a
      hound on a deer scent, only infinitely wilder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" asked somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wolf," replied Pilchuck. "Not a coyote, mind you, but a
      real old king of the plains. There's a lot of wolves hang
      with the buffalo."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry was not repeated then, but later, as Tom composed
      himself in his warm blankets, it pealed out again,
      wonderfully breaking the stillness. How hungry and full of
      loneliness! It made Tom shiver. It seemed a herald of
      wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was the first to arise next morning, and this time it
      was the ring of his ax and the crash of wood thrown into
      the camp-fire circle that roused the others. When
      Stronghurl sallied forth to find the horses, daylight had
      broken clear; and by the time breakfast was ready the sun
      was up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck, returning from the ridge-top, reported that
      buffalo were in sight, all along the river, as far as he
      could see. They were a goodly distance out on the plain and
      were not yet working in for a drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take my turn hangin' round camp," said Hudnall,
      plainly with an effort! "There's a lot to do, an' some one
      must see after the women folks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It'd be a good idea for you to climb the ridge every two
      hours or so an' take a look," replied Pilchuck, casually.
      But his glance at Hudnall was not casual. "I'll leave my
      telescope for you. Don't miss anythin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      The men saddled their horses and donned the heavy cartridge
      belts. They also carried extra cartridges in their pockets.
      Tom felt weighted down as if by a thousand pounds. He had
      neglected to buy a saddle sheath for his gun, and therefore
      would have to carry it in his hand--an awkward task while
      riding.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode behind Pilchuck down the river, and forded it at
      a shallow sand-barred place, over which the horses had to
      go at brisk gait to avoid miring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How're we ever goin' to get the wagons across?" queried
      Burn Hudnall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon we've no choice," replied Pilchuck. "The hides have
      to be hauled to camp. You see the actual chasin' an'
      killin' of buffalo doesn't take much time. Then the real
      work begins. We'll have all the rest of the day--an' night,
      to skin, haul to camp, an' peg out."
    </p>
    <p>
      This side of the river bank was more wooded and less
      precipitous than the other. Buffalo tracks were as thick as
      cattle tracks round a water-hole. The riders halted at the
      top of the slope where the level plain began. Out on the
      grassy expanse, perhaps a mile or more, extended a shaggy
      dark line like a wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon there's your buffalo," said the scout. "Now we'll
      scatter an' wait under cover for an hour or so. Hide in the
      brush or behind a bank, anywhere till some come close. Then
      burn powder! An' don't quit the buffalo you shoot at till
      he's down. When they run off, chase them, an' shoot from
      your horses. The chase won't last long, for the buffalo
      will run away from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck stationed Tom at this point, and rode on down the
      edge of the plain with the other men. They passed out of
      sight. In that direction Tom could not see far, owing to
      rising ground. To the southwest, however, the herd extended
      until it was impossible to distinguish between vague black
      streaks of buffalo and dim distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pilchuck said this was only a little bunch!" soliloquized
      Tom, as he scanned the plain-wide band of beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dismounting, he held his horse and stood at the edge of the
      timber, watching and listening. It was a wonderfully
      satisfying moment. He tried to be calm, but that was
      impossible. He recognized what had always been deep in
      him--the love of adventure and freedom--the passion to seek
      these in unknown places. Here, then, he stood at his post
      above the bank of a timber-bordered river in the Panhandle
      of Texas with a herd of buffalo in sight. He saw coyotes,
      too, and a larger beast, gray in color, that he was sure
      was a wolf. Hawks and buzzards sailed against the blue sky.
      Down through the trees, near the river, he espied a flock
      of wild turkeys. Then, in connection with all he saw, and
      the keenness of the morning which he felt, he remembered
      the scout's caution about Indians. Tom thought that he
      ought to be worried, even frightened, but he was neither.
      This moment was the most mysteriously full and satisfying
      of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite his point the buffalo did not approach more
      closely; he observed, however, that to the eastward they
      appeared to be encroaching upon the river brakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly then he was thrilled by gun-shots. Boom! Boom! . .
      . Boom-boom! His comrades had opened the hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What'll I do now?" he mused, gazing down the river, then
      out toward the herd. It presented no change that he could
      distinguish. "I was told to stay here. But with shooting
      begun, I don't think any buffalo will come now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after that a gun roared out much closer, indeed, just
      over the rise of plain below Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a big fifty!" he ejaculated, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far beyond, perhaps two miles distant, sounded a report of
      a Sharps, low but clear on the still morning air. Another
      and another! Tom began to tingle with anticipation. Most
      likely his comrades would chase the buffalo his way. Next
      he heard a shot apparently between the one that had sounded
      close and the one far away. So all three of his fellow
      hunters had gotten into action. Tom grew restive. Peering
      out at the herd, he discovered it was moving. A low trample
      of many hoofs assailed his ears. Dust partially obscured
      the buffalo. They appeared to be running back into the gray
      expanse. Suddenly Tom became aware of heavy and continuous
      booming of guns--close, medium, and far-away reports
      mingling. As he listened it dawned on him that all the
      reports were diminishing in sound. His comrades were
      chasing the buffalo and getting farther away. After a while
      he heard no more. Also the dust-shrouded buffalo opposite
      his position had disappeared. His disappointment was keen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a horseman appeared on the crest of the ridge
      that had hidden the chase from him. The white horse was
      Pilchuck's. Tom saw the rider wave his hat, and taking the
      action as a signal he mounted and rode at a gallop to the
      ridge, striking its summit some few hundred yards to the
      right. Here he had unobstructed view. Wide gray-green
      barren rolling plain, hazy with dust! The herd of buffalo
      was not in sight. Tom rode on to meet Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tough luck for you," said the scout. "They were workin' in
      to the river below here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you kill any?" queried Tom, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I downed twenty-one," replied Pilchuck. "An' as I was
      ridin' back I met Stronghurl. He was cussin' because he'd
      only got five. An' Burn burned a lot of powder. But so far
      as I could see he got only one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" ejaculated Tom. "Why, he was sure of dozens."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon he knows more now," returned Pilchuck. "You ride
      down there an' see how many you can skin. I'll go back to
      camp, hitch up a wagon, an' try to come back across the
      river."
    </p>
    <p>
      The scout rode away, and Tom, turning his horse eastward,
      took to a trot down the immense gradual slope. After
      searching the plain he espied a horse grazing, and then a
      dark shaggy mound which manifestly was a slain buffalo. Tom
      spurred his horse, rapidly covering the distance between.
      Soon he saw Burn at work skinning the buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good for you!" shouted Tom, as he galloped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helluva job--this skinnin'!" yelled Burn, flashing a red
      and sweaty face toward Tom. "Hey! Look out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But his warning came too late. Tom's horse snorted
      furiously, as if expelling a new and hateful scent, and,
      rearing high, he came down and plunged so violently that
      Tom flew one way and his gun another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom landed hard and rooted his face in the grass. The shock
      stunned him for a second. Then he sat up and found himself
      unhurt. The surprise, the complete victory of the horse,
      and the humiliation of being made to root the ground like a
      pig stirred Tom to some heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hope you ain't hurt?" sailed Burn, anxiously, rising from
      his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but I'm mad," replied Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Burn fell back and rolled over in the grass,
      roaring with mirth. Tom paid no attention to his comrade.
      Dusty had run off a hundred or more paces, and was now
      walking, head to one side, dragging his bridle. Tom yelled
      to stop him. Dusty kept on. Whereupon Tom broke into a run
      and caught him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a fine horse," panted Tom, as he mounted. "Now
      you'll--go back--and rub your nose--on that buffalo."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dusty appeared placable enough, and trotted back readily
      until once again close to the buffalo. Tom spurred him on
      and called forcibly to him. Dusty grew excited as he came
      nearer. Still he did not show any ugliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't hurry him," remonstrated Burn. "He's just scared."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tom, not yet cooled in temper, meant that Dusty should
      go right up to the buffalo. This he forced the horse to do.
      Then suddenly Dusty flashed down his head and seemed to
      propel himself with incredible violence high into the air.
      He came down on stiff legs. The shock was so severe that
      Tom shot out of the saddle. He came down back of the
      cantle. Desperately he clung to the pommel, and as Dusty
      pitched high again, his hold broke and he spun round like a
      top on the rump of the horse and slid off. Dusty ceased his
      pitching and backed away from the dead buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Tom's feelings were hurt. Burn Hudnall's "Haw! haw!
      haw!" rolled out in great volume. Tom sat where he had been
      dumped, and gazing at the horse, he gradually induced a
      state of mind bordering upon appreciation of how Dusty must
      have felt. Presently Burn got up, and catching Dusty, led
      him slowly and gently, talking soothingly the while, nearer
      to the buffalo, and held him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's all right now," said Burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom rose and went back to the horse and patted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bucked me off, didn't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, if I were you I'd get off an' lead him up to the dead
      buffalo till he gets over his scare," suggested Burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will," replied Tom, and then he gazed down at the shaggy
      carcass on the ground. "Phew! the size of him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looks big as a woolly elephant, doesn't he? Big bull,"
      Pilchuck said. "He's the only one I got, an' sure he took a
      lot of shootin'. You see the buffalo was runnin' an' I
      couldn't seem to hit one of them. Finally I plunked this
      bull. An' he kept on runnin' till I filled him full of
      lead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are those Pilchuck got?" queried Tom, anxious to go
      to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First one's lyin' about a quarter--there, to the left a
      little. You go tackle skinnin' him. It's an old bull like
      this. An' if you get his skin off to-day I'll eat it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've skinned lots of cattle--steers and bulls," replied
      Tom. "It wasn't hard work. Why should this be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man, they're buffalo, an' their skin's an inch thick,
      tougher than sole leather--an' stick! Why it's riveted on
      an' clinched."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must be some knack about the job, then," rejoined Tom,
      mounting Dusty. "Say, I nearly forgot my gun. Hand it up,
      will you? . . . Burn, I'll bet you I skin ten buffalo
      before dark and peg them out, as Pilchuck called it, before
      I go to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take you up," said Burn, with a grim laugh. "I just
      wish I had time to watch you. It'd be a circus. But I'll be
      ridin' by you presently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. I'm off to win that bet," replied Tom, in
      cheery determination, and touching Dusty with the spurs he
      rode rapidly toward the next fallen buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>
      <a name="c04" id="c04">CHAPTER IV</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Dusty evinced less fear of the second prostrate buffalo,
      which was even a larger bull than the huge tough old animal
      Burn was engaged in skinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Tom did not take any needless risks with Dusty.
      Riding to within fifty feet of the dead beast, he
      dismounted, led the nervous horse closer, and round and
      round, and finally up to it. Dusty behaved very well,
      considering his first performance; left to himself,
      however, he edged away to a considerable distance and began
      to graze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom lost no time in getting to work. He laid his gun near
      at hand, and divesting himself of his coat he took ripping
      and skinning knives from his belt. Determination was strong
      in him. He anticipated an arduous and perplexing job, yet
      felt fully capable of accomplishing it and winning his bet
      with Burn. This buffalo was a monster; he was old and the
      burrs and matted hair appeared a foot deep at his
      forequarters; he was almost black.
    </p>
    <p>
      First Tom attempted to turn the beast over into a more
      favorable position for skinning. He found, however, that he
      could scarcely budge the enormous bulk. That was a
      surprise. There appeared nothing to do but go to work as
      best he could, and wait for help to move the animal.
      Forthwith he grasped his ripping knife and proceeded to try
      following instructions given him. It took three attempts to
      get the knife under the skin and when he essayed to rip he
      found that a good deal of strength was required. He had
      calculated that he must expend considerable energy to make
      any speed, until practice had rendered him proficient. The
      considerable energy grew into the utmost he could put
      forth. After the ripping came the skinning, and in very
      short time he appreciated all Burn had said. "Helluva job
      is right!" Tom commented, remembering his comrade's words.
      But he did not spare himself, and by tremendous exertions
      he had the buffalo skinned before Burn finished his. Tom
      could not vouch for the merit of the job, but the skin was
      off. He could vouch, however, for his breathlessness and
      the hot sweat that bathed his body. Plowing corn or
      pitching wheat, jobs he had imagined were hard work, paled
      into insignificance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say--wonder what pegging out the hide--will be like," he
      panted, as he sheathed his knives and picked up his gun.
      Mounting Dusty he rode eastward, scanning the plain for the
      next dead buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he espied it, and galloping thither he found it
      to be another bull, smaller and younger than the others,
      and he set to work with renewed zeal. He would have to work
      like a beaver to win that bet. It took violence to make a
      quick job of this one. That done, Tom rode on to the third.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was laboring here Burn rode by and paid him a
      hearty compliment, which acted upon Tom like a spur. He
      could not put forth any greater zeal; indeed, he would do
      wonders if he kept to the pace he had set himself. But as
      he progressed he learned. This advantage, however, was
      offset by the gradual dulling of his knives. He had
      forgotten to bring his steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He toiled from one dead buffalo to another. The breeze died
      away, the sun climbed high and blazed down upon the plain.
      His greatest need was water to drink. Hour by hour his
      thirst augmented. His shirt was so wet with perspiration
      that he could have wrung it out. The heat did not bother
      him so much. Gradually his clothes became covered with a
      lather of sweat, blood, grease, and dust. This, and the
      growing pangs in his body, especially hands and forearms,
      occasioned him extreme annoyance. He did not note the
      passing of time. Only now and then did he scan the plain
      for sign of his comrades. Indians he had completely
      forgotten. Burn and Stronghurl were to be seen at
      intervals, and Pilchuck, driving the wagon, was with them.
      Once from a high knoll Tom thought he espied another wagon
      miles down the river, but he could not be sure. He did,
      however, make out a dim black blur to the southward, and
      this he decided was the buffalo herd, ranging back toward
      the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this strenuous time there were incidents of much
      interest, if he could only have given them due attention.
      Buzzards swooped down over him, closer and closer, till he
      felt the wind of their wings. A lean gray wolf came within
      range of his gun, but Tom had no time for shooting. He
      toiled on and the hours flew.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, late in the afternoon, he tore off the hide that
      assured him of winning the wager, he was exultant. He was
      now two miles from the wagon, which he made out was
      approaching. Only one more buffalo did he find, and this he
      skinned by the time Pilchuck drove up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, if you ain't a Kansas cyclone!" ejaculated the scout,
      with undisguised admiration. "Seventeen skinned your first
      day! Doan, I never seen the beat of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had a bet with Burn," replied Torn, wiping his hot face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you can keep that lick up, young man, you'll make a
      stake out of this hide-huntin'," returned Pilchuck,
      seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait till I learn how!" exclaimed Tom, fired by the praise
      and the hopes thus engendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon I'll cut the hump off this young bull," remarked
      the scout, as he climbed out of the seat. "Buffalo steak
      for supper, hey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could eat hoofs. And I'm spitting cotton," said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forgot a canteen. Son, you mustn't forget
      <i>anythin'</i> in this game," admonished Pilchuck. "Rustle
      back to camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was interested, however, to learn how Pilchuck would
      cut the desirable hump from the carcass. Long had Tom heard
      of the savory steaks from the buffalo. The scout thrust his
      big knife in near the joining of the loin, ripped forward
      along the lower side as far as the ribs ran; then performed
      a like operation on the upper side. That done, he cut the
      ends loose and carved out a strip over three feet long and
      so thick it was heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon we can rustle back to camp now," he said, throwing
      the meat on the pile of hides in the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that the herd coming back?" queried Tom, pointing from
      his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. They'll be in to-night yet to drink. We'll find them
      here to-morrow mornin'. Did you hear the big fifties of the
      other hunters?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean others besides our outfit? No, I didn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a couple of outfits down the river. But that's
      lucky for us. Probably will be hunters all along here soon.
      Reckon there's safety in numbers an' sure the buffalo are
      plenty enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom rode back to camp facing a sunset that emblazoned the
      western ramparts in gold and purple. The horizon line was
      far distant and lifted high, a long level upland, at that
      moment singularly wild and beautiful. Tom wondered if it
      could be the eastern extension of the great Staked Plains
      he had heard mentioned so often. Weary as he was from his
      extraordinary exertions, he yet had spirit left to look and
      feel and think. The future seemed like that gold-rimmed
      horizon line.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached camp before dusk, there to receive the plaudits
      of his comrades and also the women folks. Burn was generous
      in his eulogy, but he created consternation in Tom's breast
      by concluding, "Wait till you try peggin' out a hide!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw! I forgot there was more. I've not won that bet yet,"
      he rejoined, dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After attending to his horse Tom had just about enough
      energy left to drink copiously and stretch out with a groan
      under a tree. Never before in his life had he throbbed and
      ached and burned so exceedingly. An hour's rest
      considerably relieved him. Then supper, which he attacked
      somewhat as if he were a hungry wolf, was an event to be
      remembered. If all his comrades had not been equally as
      ravenous he would have been ashamed. Pilchuck got much
      satisfaction out of the rapid disappearance of many buffalo
      steaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meat's no good when so fresh," he averred. "After bein'
      hung up a few days an' set, we call it, an' fried in
      tallow, it beats beef all hollow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before darkness set in Tom saw Pilchuck peg out a hide.
      First the scout laid the hide flat and proceeded to cut
      little holes in it all around the edge. Next with ax and
      knife he sharpened sticks nearly a foot long. Three of
      these he drove through the neck of the hide and deep enough
      into the ground to hold well. Then he proceeded to the tail
      end and stretched the skin. Tom could well see that skill
      was required here. Pilchuck held the skin stretched, and at
      the same time drove one peg, then another, at this end.
      Following that, he began to stretch and peg the side,
      eventually working all around. The whole operation did not
      take long and did not appear difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom essayed it with a vim that made up for misgivings. Like
      the skinning, it was vastly more difficult than it looked.
      Cutting the holes and making the pegs was easy; however,
      when it came to stretching the hide and holding it and
      pegging it all by himself, he found it a most deceiving and
      irksome task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally Hudnall offered to help Tom, but he declined with
      thanks, explaining that he had a wager to win. The girl
      hovered round Tom and curiously watched him, much to his
      annoyance. He saw that she was laughing at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's so funny?" he queried, nettled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look like a boy tryin' to play mumbly-peg an'
      leap-frog at once," she replied with a giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had to laugh a good-natured acknowledgment to that; and
      then he deftly turned the tables on her by making a dry,
      casual remark about Stronghurl. The girl blushed and let
      him alone to ponder over the intricacies of this hide
      pegging. No contortionist ever performed more marvels of
      stretching his body than Tom achieved. Likewise, no man
      ever so valiantly stifled back speech that would have been
      unseemly, to say the least, in the hearing of women. His
      efforts, however, were crowned with the reward of
      persistence. By midnight he had the job done, and utterly
      spent he crawled into his bed, where at once his eyes
      seemed to glue shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he readily answered Pilchuck's call, but his
      body was incapable of a like alacrity. He crawled out of
      his blankets as if he were crippled. A gradual working of
      his muscles, however, loosened the stiffness and warmed the
      cold soreness to the extent that he believed he could begin
      the day with some semblance of service.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was again, in Pilchuck's terse terms, every man for
      himself. Tom welcomed this for two reasons, first that he
      could go easy, and secondly that he wanted to revel in and
      prolong his first real encounter with the buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudnall changed Tom's plans somewhat by relegating him to
      watch camp that day, while he went out with the other men.
      He modified this order, however, by saying that if any
      buffalo came near camp Tom might go after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast was over at sunrise. Pilchuck brought out his
      heavy ammunition box, with which each hunter was provided,
      and told Tom he could help a little and learn while he
      helped. His belt contained more than thirty empty shells
      that were to be reloaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon I ought to have done this last night," he explained
      to Hundall, who was impatient to be off. "You fellows go on
      down the river. I'll catch up with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The three hunters rode off eagerly, and Pilchuck got out
      his tools for reloading. Tom quickly learned the use of
      bullet-mold, swedge, lubricator, primer, extractor, tamper,
      and patch-paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon I'm all set now," affirmed the scout. "You put
      these tools away for me. An' keep a good lookout. I'm not
      worryin', but I'd like to know if there's Indians huntin'
      this herd. Take a look from the ridge with my glass, an'
      there'll be buffalo on the other side of the river to-day,
      you can keep in sight of camp an' get a shot."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that Pilchuck mounted his horse and trotted away
      through the timber. Tom leisurely set about the few tasks
      at hand. It pleased him when he was able to avoid Sally's
      watching eyes. She seemed to regard him with something of
      disapproval. When the camp chores were finished Tom took
      the telescope and climbed to the ridge-top. Apparently more
      buffalo were in sight than on the previous day and about in
      the same latitude. Tom swept the circle of surrounding
      country, gray-green rolling plain, the low ridges, the
      winding river depression, with its fringe of trees. Some
      miles down the river rose a column of smoke, marking, no
      doubt, another camp. Far away to the south and west loomed
      the strange upheaval of land. Clearly defined by the
      telescope, it appeared to be an escarpment of horizon-wide
      dimensions, gray and barren, seamed by canyons, standing in
      wild and rugged prominence above the plains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until late in the morning did Tom's watchful gaze espy
      buffalo approaching camp. Then he was thrilled to see a
      number of what appeared to be bulls grazing riverward
      opposite the camp. Hurrying down from the eminence whence
      he had made this observation, he got his gun and
      cartridges, and crossing the river he proceeded up the
      thickly wooded slope some distance to the west of his first
      stand of yesterday. It looked to him as if the bulls might
      work down into a coulee which opened into the river
      depression. He was quite a little time reaching the point
      desired--the edge of woodland and brink of the ravine--and
      when he peered from under the last trees he was moved with
      such an overwhelming excitement that he dropped to his
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out on the open plain, not a hundred yards distant, grazed
      nine buffalo bulls, the leader of which appeared larger
      than the largest he had skinned the day before. They had
      not scented Tom and were grazing toward him, somewhat to
      the right, manifestly headed for the coulee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trembling and panting, Tom watched with strained sight. He
      forgot he held a "big fifty" in his hands, and in the
      riotous sensation of that moment he did not remember until
      from far down the river came a dull boom--boom of guns. It
      amazed him to see that the buffalo bulls paid no attention
      to the shooting. He made up his mind then to take his time
      and await a favorable opportunity to down the leader. They
      were approaching so slowly that he had ample time to
      control the trembling of his muscles, though it was
      impossible to compose himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of the bulls piled over the little bank into the
      coulee, and while they were passing within fifty yards of
      Tom the others leisurely began the descent, the huge bull
      nodding along in the rear. The near ones passed into the
      timber, getting farther away from Tom. He had difficulty in
      restraining his eagerness. Then one bull began to crash in
      the brush. He made as much noise as an elephant. Tom
      watched with an intense interest only second to the
      hot-pressed lust to kill. This bull was crashing against
      thick brush, and it soon became plain to Tom that the beast
      was scratching his shaggy hide, tearing out the matts of
      burrs and the shedding hair. It came away in great tufts,
      hanging on the sharp broken ends of the brush. This old
      bull knew what he was about when he charged that thicket of
      hackberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Tom was electrified by a puff which assuredly came
      from the nostrils of a buffalo close to him. He turned
      cautiously. Behind and below him, closer than fifty yards,
      the other bulls were passing into the timber. He plainly
      heard the grinding of their teeth. They were monsters.
      Instinctively Tom searched for a tree to climb or a place
      to run to after he fired. What if they should charge his
      way? He would scarcely have time to reload, and even if he
      had, of what avail would that be?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the monarch wagged his enormous head in line with
      Tom's magnifying vision. What a wide short face! His eyes
      stood out so that he could see in front or behind. His
      shaggy beard was dragging. Tom could see only the tips of
      the horns in all that woolly mass. Puff! came the sound of
      expelled breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom felt he hated to kill that glorious and terrifying
      beast, yet he was powerless to resist the tight palpitating
      feverish dominance of his blood. Resting the heavy rifle on
      a branch, he aimed behind the great shaggy shoulder, and
      with strained muscles and bated breath he fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a cannon the old Sharps roared. Crashings of brush,
      thudding of heavy hoofs, sounded to the right of the cloud
      of smoke. The other bulls were running. Tom caught glimpses
      of broad brown backs cleaving the brush down the river
      slope. With shaking hands he reloaded. Peering under the
      drifting smoke, he searched fearfully for the bull he had
      fired at, at first seeing only the thick-grassed swelling
      slope of the coulee. Then farther down he espied a huge
      brown object lying inert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wildness of the boy in Tom conquered all else. Leaping
      up, he broke out of the woods, yelling like an Indian, and
      charged down the gentle slope, exultant and proud, yet not
      quite frenzied enough to forget possible peril. From that
      quarter, however, he was safe. The monarch was heaving his
      last breath.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck rode in at noon that day, in time to see Tom
      stretch the hide of his first buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You got one, hey?" he called, eying the great shaggy hide
      with appreciation. "Your first buffalo! Wal, it's a darned
      fine one. They don't come any bigger than that fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had to tell the story of his exploit, and was somewhat
      discomfited by the scout's remark that he should have
      killed several of the bulls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't you back early?" queried Tom, as Pilchuck
      dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run out of cartridges," he said, laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So quick!" exclaimed Tom, staring. "You must have seen a
      lot of buffalo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon they <i>was</i> thick this mornin'," returned the
      scout, dryly. "I got plumb surrounded once an' had to shoot
      my way out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! . . . How many did you down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty-one. I think when we count up tonight we'll have a
      good day. Burn is doin' better than yesterday. . . . Wal, I
      want a bite to eat an' a drink. It's warm ridin' in the
      dust. Then I'll hitch up the wagon an' drive down for the
      hides. Come to think of it, though, I've a job to do
      before. You can help me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Later Pilchuck hailed Tom to fetch an ax and come on. Tom
      followed the scout down into the thickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cut four strong poles about ten feet long an' pack them to
      camp," said Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom did as he was bidden, to find that the scout had
      returned ahead of him, carrying four short poles with forks
      at one end. He proceeded to pound these into the ground
      with the forks uppermost, and then he laid across them the
      poles Tom had brought, making a square framework. "We'll
      stretch a hide inside the poles, loose so it'll sag down,
      an' there we'll salt our buffalo humps."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck then brought in a team of horses and hitched it to
      the big wagon. "Wal, son," he said to Tom, "I ain't
      hankerin' after skinnin' hides. But I may as well start.
      We're goin' to kill more buffalo than we'll have time to
      skin."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove out of camp down the slope into the shallow water.
      The horses plunged in at a trot, splashing high. Pilchuck
      lashed out with the long whip and yelled lustily. Any
      slowing up there meant wheels stuck in the sand. Horses,
      driver, and wagon were drenched. From the other side
      Pilchuck looked back. "Fine on a day like this," he
      shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after he had gone Tom heard one of the horses up
      the river neigh several times. This induced him to
      reconnoiter, with the result that he espied a wagon coming
      along the edge of the timber. It appeared to be an open
      wagon, with one man in the driver's seat. Another,
      following on horseback, was leading two extra horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More hide-hunters," Tom decided as he headed toward them.
      "Now I wonder what's expected of me in a case like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the driver espied Tom come into the open, rifle in
      hand, he halted the horses abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dunn outfit--hide-hunters," he announced, with something
      of alarmed alacrity, as if his identity and business had
      been questioned. He appeared to be a short, broad man, and
      what little of his face was visible was bright red. He had
      bushy whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm Tom Doan, of Hudnall's outfit," replied Tom. "We're
      camped just below."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clark Hudnall! By all that's lucky!" exclaimed the man. "I
      know Hudnall. We talked some last fall of going in
      together. That was at Independence. But he wasn't ready and
      I come ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom offered his hand, and at this juncture the horseman
      that had been behind the wagon rode forward abreast of the
      driver. He was a fat young man with a most jocund
      expression on his round face. His apparel was striking in
      its inappropriateness to the rough life of the plains. His
      old slouch hat was too small for his large head, and there
      was a tuft of tow-colored hair sticking out of a hole in
      the crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ory, shake hands with Tom Doan, of Hudnall's outfit," said
      Dunn. "My nephew, Ory Tacks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much obliged to meet you, Mister Doan," replied Tacks,
      with great aplomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Howdy! Same to you," greeted Tom, in slow, good humor, as
      he studied the face of this newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dunn interrupted his scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Hudnall in camp?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. He's out hunting buffalo. I'm sure you're welcome to
      stop at our camp till he comes in. That'll be around
      sundown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. I'm needing sight and sound of some one I know,"
      replied Dunn, significantly. "Lead the way, Doan. These
      horses of mine are thirsty."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the travelers arrived at Hudnall's camp, Tom helped
      them unhitch in a favorable camping spot, and unpack the
      necessary camp duffle. Once during this work Ory Tacks
      halted so suddenly that he dropped a pack on his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ouch!" he cried, lifting his foot to rub it with his hand
      while he kept his gaze toward Tom's camp. It was an
      enraptured and amazed gaze. "Do I see a beautiful young
      lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus questioned, Tom wheeled to see Sally Hudnall's face
      framed in the white-walled door of Hudnall's prairie wagon.
      It was rather too far to judge accurately, but he inclined
      to the impression that Sally was already making eyes at Ory
      Tacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! There!" ejaculated Tom, hard put to it to keep his
      face serious. "It's a young lady, all right--Miss Sally
      Hudnall. But I can't see that she--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uncle Jack, there's a girl in this camp," interrupted Ory,
      in tones of awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got three women," said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's a surprise to us," returned Dunn. "I had no
      idea Hudnall would fetch his women folks down here into the
      buffalo country. I wonder if he . . . Tom, is there a
      buffalo-hunter with you, a man who knows the frontier?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Jude Pilchuck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he stand for the women coming?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess he had no choice," rejoined Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! How long have you been on the river?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seen any other outfits?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. But Pilchuck said there were a couple down the river."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awhuh," said Dunn, running a stubby, powerful hand through
      his beard. He seemed concerned. "You see, Doan, we've been
      in the buffalo country since last fall. And we've sure had
      it rough. Poor luck on our fall hunt. That was over on the
      Brazos. Kiowa Indians on the rampage. Our winter hunt we
      made on the line of Indian Territory. We didn't know it was
      against the law to kill buffalo in the Territory. The
      officers took our hides. Then we'd got our spring hunt
      started fine--west of here forty miles or so. Had five
      hundred hides. And they were stolen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say!" exclaimed Tom, astonished. "Who'd be so
      low down as to steal hides?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who?" snorted Dunn, with fire in his small eyes. "We don't
      know. The soldiers don't know. They <i>say</i> the thieves
      are Indians. But I'm one who believes they are white."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom immediately grasped the serious nature of this
      information. The difficulties and dangers of hide-hunting
      began to assume large proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you must tell Hudnall and Pilchuck all about this,"
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Sally called out sweetly, "Tom--oh, Tom--wouldn't
      your visitors like a bite to eat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon they would, miss, thanks to you," shouted Dunn,
      answering for himself. As for Ory Tacks, he appeared
      overcome, either by the immediate prospect of food, or by
      going into the presence of the beautiful young lady. Tom
      noted that he at once dropped his task of helping Dunn and
      bent eager energies to the improvement of his personal
      appearance. Dunn and Tom had seated themselves before Ory
      joined them, but when he did come he was manifestly bent on
      making a great impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Hudnall--my nephew, Ory Tacks," announced Dunn, with
      quaint formality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the name?" queried Sally, incredulously, as if she
      had not heard aright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Orville Tacks--at your service, Miss Hudnall," replied the
      young man, elaborately. "I am much obliged to meet you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally took him in with keen, doubtful gaze, and evidently,
      when she could convince herself that he was not making fun
      at her expense, gravitated to a perception of easy
      conquest. Tom saw that this was a paramount issue with
      Sally. Probably later she might awake to a humorous
      appreciation of this young gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom soon left the newcomers to their camp tasks, and went
      about his own, which for the most part consisted of an
      alert watchfulness. Early in the afternoon the distant
      boom-boom of the big buffalo guns ceased to break the
      drowsy silence. The hours wore away. When, at time of
      sunset, Tom returned from his last survey of the plains, it
      was to find Hudnall and his hunter comrades in camp.
      Pilchuck was on the way back with a load of fifty-six
      hides. Just as twilight fell he called from the opposite
      bank that he would need help at the steep place. All hands
      pulled and hauled the wagon over the obstacle; and hard
      upon that incident came Mrs. Hudnall's cheery call to
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom watched and listened with more than his usual
      attentiveness. Hudnall was radiant. This day's work had
      been good. For a man of his tremendous strength and
      endurance the extreme of toil was no hindrance. He was like
      one that had found a gold mine. Burn Hudnall reflected his
      father's spirit. Pilchuck ate in silence, not affected by
      their undisguised elation. Stronghurl would have been dense
      indeed, in the face of Sally's overtures, not to sense a
      rival in Ory Tacks. This individual almost ate out of
      Sally's hand. Dunn presented a rather gloomy front.
      Manifestly he had not yet told Hudnall of his misfortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper it took the men two hours of labor to peg out
      the hides. All the available space in the grove was
      blanketed with buffalo skins, with narrow lanes between.
      Before this work was accomplished the women had gone to
      bed. At the camp fire which Tom replenished, Dunn recounted
      to Hudnall and Pilchuck the same news he had told Tom,
      except that he omitted comment on the presence of the
      women.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Tom's surprise, Hudnall took Dunn's story lightly. He
      did not appear to grasp any serious menace, and he
      dismissed Dunn's loss with brief words: "Hard luck! But you
      can make it up soon. Throw in with me. The more the
      merrier, an' the stronger we'll be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How about your supplies?" queried Dunn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plenty for two months. An' we'll be freightin' out hides
      before that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Clark, I'll throw in with your outfit huntin'
      for myself, of course, an' payin' my share," replied Dunn,
      slowly, as if the matter was weighty. "But I hope you don't
      mind my talkin' out straight about your women."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you can talk straight about anyone or anythin' to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want to send your women back or take them to Fort
      Elliott," returned Dunn, brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dunn, I won't do anythin' of the kind," retorted Hudnall,
      bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the soldiers will do it for you, if they happen to
      come along," said Dunn, just as bluntly. "It's your own
      business. I'm not trying to interfere in your affairs. But
      women don't belong on such a huntin' trip as this summer
      will see. My idea, talking straight, is that Mr. Pilchuck
      here should have warned you and made you leave the women
      back in the settlement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, I gave Hudnall a hunch all right, but he wouldn't
      listen," declared the scout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't give me any such damn thing," shouted Hudnall
      angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a hot argument that in Tom's opinion ended in
      the conviction that Pilchuck had not told all he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if that's what, I reckon it doesn't make any
      difference to me," said Hudnall, finally. "I wanted wife
      an' Sally with me. An' if I was comin' at all they were
      comin' too. We're huntin' buffalo, yes, for a while--as
      long as there's money in it. But what we're huntin' most is
      a farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Hudnall, listen," responded Dunn, curtly. "I'm not
      tryin' to boss your outfit. After this I'll have no more to
      say. . . . I've been six months at this hide-huntin' an' I
      know what I'm talkin' about. The great massed herd of
      buffalo is south of here, on the Red River, along under the
      rim of the Staked Plain. You think this herd here is big.
      Say, this is a straggler bunch. There's a thousand times as
      many buffalo down on the Red. . . . There's where the most
      of the hide-hunters are and there the Comanches and Kiowas
      are on the war-path. I've met hunters who claim this main
      herd will reach here this spring, along in May. But I say
      that great herd will never again get this far north. If you
      want hide-huntin' for big money, then you've got to pull
      stakes for the Red River."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By thunder! we'll pull then," boomed Hudnall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon we've got some good huntin' here, as long as this
      bunch hangs around the water," interposed Pilchuck. "We've
      got it 'most all to ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's sense," said Dunn, conclusively. "I'll be glad to
      stay. But when we do pull for the Staked Plain country you
      want to look for some wild times. There'll be hell along
      the Red River this summer."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In the swiftly flying days that succeeded Dunn's joining
      Hudnall's outfit Tom developed rapidly into a hunter and
      skinner of buffalo. He was never an expert shot with the
      heavy Sharps, but he made up in horsemanship and daring
      what he lacked as a marksman. If a man had nerve he did not
      need to be skillful with the rifle. It was as a skinner,
      however, that Tom excelled all of Hudnall's men. Tom had
      been a wonderful husker of corn; he had been something of a
      blacksmith. His hands were large and powerful, and these
      qualifications, combined with deftness, bade fair to make
      him a record skinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hudnall outfit followed the other outfits, which they
      never caught up with, south along the stream in the rear of
      this herd of buffalo. Neither Dunn nor Pilchuck knew for
      certain that the stream flowed into the Red River, but as
      the days grew into weeks they inclined more and more to
      that opinion. If it was so, luck was merely with them.
      Slowly the herd gave way, running, when hunted, some miles
      to the south, and next day always grazing east to the
      river. The morning came, however, when the herd did not
      appear. Pilchuck rode thirty miles south without success.
      He was of the opinion, and Dunn agreed with him, that the
      buffalo had at last made for the Red River. So that night
      plan was made to abandon hunting for the present and to
      travel south in search of the main herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom took stock of his achievements, and was exceedingly
      amazed and exultant. How quickly it seemed that small
      figures augmented to larger ones!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hunted, in all, twenty-four days. Three hundred and
      sixty buffalo had fallen to his credit. But that was not
      all. It was the skinning which he was paid for, and he had
      skinned four hundred and eighty-two buffalo--an average of
      twenty a day. Hudnall owed him then one hundred forty-four
      dollars and sixty cents. Tom had cheerfully and gratefully
      worked on a farm for twenty dollars a month. This piling up
      of money was incredible. He was dazzled. Suppose he hunted
      and skinned buffalo for a whole year! The prospect quite
      overwhelmed him. Moreover, the camp life, the open
      wilderness, the hard riding and the thrill of the
      chase--these had worked on him insensibly, until before he
      realized it he was changed.

      <a name="c05" id="c05">CHAPTER V</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There was just daylight enough to discern objects when
      Milly Fayre peeped out of the wagon, hoping against hope
      that she would be able to wave a farewell to the young man,
      Tom Doan. She knew his name and the names of all the
      Hudnall party. For some reason her stepfather was immensely
      curious about other outfits, yet avoided all possible
      contact with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no one in Hudnall's camp appeared to be stirring. The
      obscurity of the gray dawn soon swallowed the grove of
      trees and the prairie schooners. Milly lay back in her bed
      in the bottom of the wagon and closed her eyes. Sleep would
      not come again. The rattle of wagon trappings, the roll of
      the crunching wheels, and the trotting clip-clop of hoofs
      not only prevented slumber, but also assured her that the
      dreaded journey down into the prairie had begun in reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      This journey had only one pleasing prospect--and that was a
      hope, forlorn at best, of somewhere again seeing the tall,
      handsome stranger who had spoken so kindly to her and gazed
      at her with such thoughtful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that she hoped for anything beyond just seeing him! She
      would be grateful for that. Her stepfather would not permit
      any friendships, let alone acquaintances, with
      buffalo-hunters. Five weeks with this stepfather had taught
      her much, and she feared him. Last night his insulting
      speech before Tom Doan had created in Milly the nucleus of
      a revolt. She dared to imagine a time might come, in
      another year when she became of age, that would give her
      freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting with Tom Doan last night had occasioned, all in
      twelve hours, a change in Milly Fayre. His look had haunted
      her, and even in the kindly darkness it had power to bring
      the blood to her face. Then his words so full of fear and
      reproach--"I may never see you again!"--they had awakened
      Milly's heart. No matter what had inspired them! Yet she
      could harbor no doubt of this fine-spoken, clear-eyed young
      man. He was earnest. He meant that not to see her again
      would cause him regret. What would it mean to her--never to
      see him again? She could not tell. But seeing him once had
      lightened her burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in Milly Fayre there was born a dream. Hard work on a
      farm had been her portion--hard work in addition to the
      long journey to and from school. She did not remember her
      father, who had been one of the missing in the war. It had
      been a tragedy, when she was sixteen, for her mother to
      marry Randall Jett, and then live only a few months. Milly
      had no relatives. Boys and men had tormented her with their
      advances, and their importunities, like the life she had
      been forced to lead, had not brought any brightness. Relief
      indeed had been hers during those months when her
      stepfather had been absent hunting buffalo. But in March he
      had returned with another wife, a woman hard featured and
      coarse and unreasonably jealous of Milly. He had sold the
      little Missouri farm and brought his wife and Milly south,
      inflamed by his prospects of gaining riches in the buffalo
      fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the start Milly had dreaded that journey. But she
      could not resist. She was in Randall Jett's charge.
      Besides, she had nowhere to go; she knew nothing except the
      work that fell to the lot of a daughter of the farm. She
      had been apathetic, given to broodings and a growing
      tendency toward morbidness. All the days of that traveling
      southward had been alike, until there came the one on which
      her kindness to a horse had brought her face to face with
      Tom Doan. What was it that had made him different? Had the
      meeting been only last night?
    </p>
    <p>
      The wagon rolled on down the uneven road, and the sudden
      lighting of the canvas indicated that the sun had risen.
      Milly heard the rattling of the harness on the horses. One
      of the wagons, that one driven by Jett, was close behind.

    <p>
      Movement and sound of travel became more bearable as Milly
      pondered over the difference one day had wrought. It was
      better that she was going on the road of the hide-hunters,
      for Tom Doan was one of them. Every thought augmented
      something vague and deep that baffled her. One moment she
      would dream of yesterday--that incident of casual meeting,
      suddenly to become one of strangely locked eyes--how all
      day she had watched Hudnall's camp for sight of the tall
      young man--how she had listened to Jett's gossip with his
      men about the other outfits--how thrilled she had been when
      she had met Tom Doan again. It had not been altogether fear
      of her stepfather that had made her run off from this
      outspoken, keen-eyed young man. She had been suddenly beset
      by unfamiliar emotions. The touch of his hands--his
      look--his speech! Milly felt again the uplift of her heart,
      the swell of breast, the tingling race of blood, the swift,
      vague, fearful thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment Milly would try to drive away the sweet
      insidious musing, to ponder over her presence there in this
      rattling wagon, and what might be in store for her. There
      had been a break in the complexity of her situation.
      Something, a new spirit, seemed stirring in her. If she was
      glad of anything it was for the hours in which she could
      think. This canvas-topped wagon was her house of one room,
      and when she was inside, with the openings laced, she felt
      the solitude her soul needed. For one thing, Jett never
      objected to her seeking the privacy of her abode; and she
      now, with her new-born intuition, sensed that it was
      because he did not like to see the men watching her. Yet he
      watched her himself with his big hard blue eyes. Tom Doan's
      eyes had not been like that. She could think of them and
      imagine them, so kindly piercing and appealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This drifting from conjectures and broodings into a vague
      sort of enchanting reverie was a novel experience for
      Milly. She resisted a while, then yielded to it. Happiness
      abided therein. She must cultivate such easy means of
      forgetting the actual.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Milly's wagon lumbered on over the uneven road, and just
      when she imagined she could no longer stand the jolting and
      confinement, it halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard Jett's gruff voice, the scrape of the brakes on
      the wagon behind, and then the unsnapping of harness
      buckles and the clinking thud of heavy cooking-ware thrown
      to the ground. Milly opened the canvas slit at the back of
      her wagon, and taking up the bag that contained her mirror,
      brush and comb, soap, towel, and other necessities, she
      spread the flaps of the door and stepped down to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halt had been made at the edge of a clump of trees in a dry
      arroyo. It was hot, and Milly decided she would put on her
      sunbonnet as soon as she had washed her face and combed her
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mawin', girl," drawled a lazy voice. It came from the man,
      Catlee, who had driven her wagon. He was a swarthy fellow
      of perhaps forty years, rugged of build, garbed as a
      teamster, with a lined face that seemed a record of violent
      life. Yet Milly had not instinctively shrunk from him as
      from the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Mr. Catlee," she responded. "Can I get some
      water?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore, miss. I'll hev it for you in a jiffy," he
      volunteered, and stepping up on the hub of a front wheel he
      rummaged under the seat, to fetch forth a basin. This he
      held under a keg that was wired to the side of the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dry camp, Catlee," spoke up a gruff voice from behind. "Go
      easy on the water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, boss, easy it is," he replied, as he twisted a
      peg out of the keg. He winked at Milly and deliberately let
      the water pour out until the basin was full. This he set on
      a box in the shade of the wagon. "Thar you are, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly thanked him and proceeded leisurely about her
      ablutions. She knew there was a sharp eye upon her every
      move and was ready for the gruff voice when it called out:
      "Rustle, you Milly. Help here, an' never mind your good
      looks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly minded them so little that she scarcely looked at
      herself in the mirror; and when Jett reminded her of them,
      which he was always doing, she wished that she was ugly.
      Presently, donning the sunbonnet, which served the double
      duty of shading her eyes from the hot glare and hiding her
      face, she turned to help at the camp-fire tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jett, Milly's stepmother, was on her knees before a
      panful of flour and water, which she was mixing into
      biscuit dough. The sun did not bother her, apparently, for
      she was bareheaded. She was a handsome woman, still young,
      dark, full faced, with regular features and an expression
      of sullenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett strode around the place, from wagon to fire, his hands
      quick and strong to perform two things at once. His eyes,
      too, with their hard blue light, roved everywhere. They
      were eyes of suspicion. This man was looking for untoward
      reactions in the people around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody worked speedily, not with the good will of a camp
      party that was wholesome and happy, bent on an enterprise
      hopeful, even if dangerous, but as if dominated by a
      driving spirit. Very soon the meal was ready, and the men
      extended pan and cup for their portion, which was served by
      Mrs. Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eat, girl," called Jett, peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly was hungry enough, albeit she had been slow and,
      receiving her food and drink, she sat down upon a sack of
      grain. While she ate she watched from under the wide rim of
      her sun-bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did she imagine a subtle change had come over these men,
      now that the journey toward the wild buffalo country had
      begun? Follonsbee had been with Jett before and evidently
      had the leader's confidence, as was evinced by the many
      whispered consultations Milly had observed. He was a tall,
      spare man, with evil face, red from liquor and exposure,
      and eyes that Milly had never looked into twice. Pruitt had
      lately joined the little caravan. Small of stature, though
      hardy, and with a sallow face remarkable in that its
      pointed chin was out of line with the bulging forehead, he
      presented an even more repulsive appearance than
      Follonsbee. He was a rebel and lost no opportunity to let
      that fact be known.
    </p>
    <p>
      These men were buffalo-hunters, obsessed with the idea of
      large sums of money to be made from the sale of hides. From
      what little Milly had been able to learn, all the men
      except Catlee were to share equally in the proceeds of the
      hunt. Milly had several times heard argument to that
      effect--argument always discontinued when she came within
      hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly had become curious about her stepfather and his men.
      This interest of hers dated back no farther than yesterday,
      when her meeting with Tom Doan, and a few words exchanged
      with the pleasant Mrs. Hudnall, and her eager watching of
      the Hudnall camp, had showed her plainly that Jett's was a
      different kind of outfit. No good humor, no kindliness, no
      gay words or pleasant laughs, no evidence of wholesome
      anticipation! Jett had never been a man she could care for,
      yet up to the last few weeks he had been endurable. The
      force of him had changed with the advent of these other men
      and the journey into unsettled country. In him Milly now
      began to sense something sinister.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not speak often. The business of eating and the
      hurry maintained by Jett were not altogether cause for this
      taciturnity. Catlee was the only one who occasionally made
      a casual remark, and then no one appeared to hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rustle along, you-all," ordered Jett, gruffly, as he rose
      from his meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you aim to camp at Wade's Crossin' tonight?" queried
      Follonsbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. We'll water an' get wood there, an' go on," returned
      Jett, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other men made no comment, and presently they rose, to
      set about their tasks. The horses were hitched up while
      munching their grain out of the nose bags. Milly wiped the
      plates and utensils that Mrs. Jett hurriedly and silently
      washed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, I--I wish we were not going on this hunt,"
      ventured Milly, at last, for no other reason than that she
      could not stand the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not your mother," replied the woman, tersely. "Call me
      Jane, if the name Mrs. Jett makes you jealous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jealous? Why should I be jealous of that name?" asked
      Milly, in slow surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're no more related to Jett than I am," said Mrs. Jett,
      pondering darkly. She seemed a thick-minded person. "For my
      part, I don't like the hunt, either. I told Jett so, an' he
      said, 'Like it or lump it, you're goin'.' I reckon you'd
      better keep your mouth shut."
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly did not need such admonition, so far as her
      stepfather was concerned. But from that moment she decided
      to keep both eyes and ears open. Jett's domineering way
      might be responsible for the discontent of his wife and the
      taciturnity of his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all was in readiness to resume the journey Milly asked
      Jett if she could ride on the seat with the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon not," answered Jett, as he clambered to his own
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my back gets tired. I can't lie down all the time,"
      remonstrated Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane, you ride with Catlee an' let Milly come with me,"
      said Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like hob!" sneered his wife, with a sudden malignant flash
      of eyes that was a revelation to Milly. "Wouldn't you like
      that fine now, Rand Jett?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shut up!" returned Jett, in mingled anger and
      discomfiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're mighty afraid some man will look at that girl," she
      went on, regardless of his gathering frown. "How's she ever
      goin' to get a husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett glared at her and ground his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I see," continued Mrs. Jett, without lowering her
      strident voice. "She <i>ain't</i> goin' to get a husband if
      <i>you</i> can help it. I've had that hunch before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you shut up?" shouted Jett, furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon the woman lifted herself to the seat beside him.
      Jett started his team out toward the road. As Pruitt and
      Follonsbee had driven ahead in their wagon, Milly was left
      alone with Catlee, who seemed to be both amused and
      sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Climb up heah, miss," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly hesitated, and then suddenly the new turn of her mind
      obstructed her old habit of obedience and she nimbly
      stepped to a seat beside the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon it'll be warmer out heah in the sun, but there's a
      breeze an' you can see around," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's much nicer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Catlee plied his long lash, cracking it over the horses
      without touching them, and they moved off in easy trot. The
      road lay downhill, and ahead the gray prairie rolled in
      undulating vast stretches to the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are we going to Indian Territory?" Milly asked the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss, we're in the Territory now," he replied. "I don't
      know when, but in a few days we'll cross the line into the
      Panhandle of Texas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that where the buffalo are?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ain't shore aboot that. I heard Jett say the big herd
      would be comin' north an' likely run into the hunters
      somewheres near Red River."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will all the hunters go to the same place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore they will, an' that'll be where the buffalo are."
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly did not analyze the vague hope that mounted in her
      breast. She felt surprised to find she wanted to talk, to
      learn things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this strange country to you?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore is, miss. I never was west of the Missouri till this
      trip. Reckon it's goin' to be hard. I met some hunters last
      night. They was celebratin' their arrival in town, an' I
      couldn't take too great stock in their talk. But shore they
      said it was bad down heah where we're goin'. I'm afraid it
      ain't no place for a girl like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid so, too," said Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jett ain't your real father?" queried Catlee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's my stepfather," replied Milly, and then in a few
      words she told Catlee about herself, from the time her
      mother had married Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, that accounts," rejoined Catlee, in tones
      unmistakably kind. But he did not vouchsafe to explain what
      he meant. Indeed, her simple story seemed to have silenced
      him. Yet more than before she felt his sympathy. It struck
      her singularly that he had stopped talking because he might
      have committed himself to some word against her stepfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter Milly kept the conversation from personalities,
      and during the afternoon ride she talked at intervals and
      then watched the dim horizon receding always with its
      beckoning mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunset time found Jett's caravan descending a long gradual
      slope ending in a timbered strip that marked the course of
      a stream. Catlee pointed out two camps to Milly. White
      wagons stood out against the woodland; fires were
      twinkling; smoke was rising. The place appeared pleasant
      and sheltered. Jett drove across the stream, unhitched the
      horses, and he and Follonsbee watered them and filled the
      kegs while Pruitt and Catlee gathered firewood, which was
      tied on behind the wagons.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the campers below the crossing came out in the open
      to halloo at Jett, more in friendly salutation than
      otherwise. Jett did not reply. He lost no time hooking up
      traces and harness and getting under way. He led on until
      nearly dark and halted at a low place where grass appeared
      abundant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't my stepfather camp back there with the other
      outfits?" queried Milly, as Catlee halted his team.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore he's not sociable, an' he's bent on travelin' as far
      every day as possible," replied the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Milly was busily engaged helping Mrs. Jett round the
      camp fire, darkness settled. Coyotes were yelping. A night
      wind rose and, sweeping down into the shallow coulee, it
      sent the white sparks flying. The morose mood of the
      travelers persisted. After supper was over and the tasks
      were finished Milly climbed to the seat of her wagon and
      sat there. It was out of earshot of the camp fire. Jett's
      wagon had been drawn up close beside the one she occupied.
      Heretofore camp had always been pitched in a sheltered
      place, in a grove or under the lea of a wooded hill. This
      site was out on the open prairie. The wind swept around and
      under the wagon, and it needed only a little more force to
      make it moan. But few stars lightened the cloudy sky.
      Lonesome, dismal, and forbidding, this prairie land
      increased Milly's apprehensions. She tried not to think of
      the future. Always before she had been dully resigned to a
      gray prospect. But now a consciousness grew that she could
      not go on forever like this, even if her situation did not
      grow worse. Of that, she had no doubt. Someone had told her
      that when she was eighteen years old she would be free to
      look out for herself. Yet even so, what could she do? She
      worked as hard for the Jetts as she would have to work for
      anyone else. Perhaps eventually she might get a place with
      a nice family like the Hudnalls. Suddenly the thought of
      Tom Doan flashed into her mind, and then of marriage. Her
      face burned. She hid it, fearful that even under cover of
      night someone might see her and read her thoughts. No use
      to try to repudiate them! She yearned for the companionship
      of women who would be kind to her, for a home, and for
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts became torture for Milly, but only so long
      as she strove against them. She had awakened. She could not
      be deprived of her feelings and hopes. Thus her habitual
      morbid brooding came to have a rival for the possession of
      her mind. When she went to bed that night she felt not only
      the insidious inception of a revolt, but also a realization
      that strength was coming from somewhere, as if with the
      magic of these new thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Days passed--days that dragged on with the interminable
      riding over the widening prairie--with the monotony of camp
      tasks, and the relief of oblivion in sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly always saw the sun rise and set, and these were the
      only incidents of the day in which she found pleasure. She
      had exhausted Catlee's fund of stories and his limited
      knowledge of the frontier. He was the only one in the
      outfit that she could or would talk to. Follonsbee was
      manifestly a woman-hater. Pruitt had twice approached her,
      agreeably enough, yet offensive through his appearance; and
      she had cut his overtures short. Mrs. Jett's hawk eyes
      never failed to take note of any movement on her husband's
      part in Milly's direction, which notice finally had the
      effect of making Jett surlily aloof. Yet there was that in
      his look which made Milly shrink. As days and miles passed
      behind, Jett manifestly grew away from the character that
      had seemed to be his when Milly's mother married him. Here
      in this environment harshness and violence, and a subtle
      menace, appeared natural in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a day went by now that Jett did not overtake and pass
      an outfit of two or more wagons bound for the hunting
      fields. These he passed on the road or avoided at camping
      grounds. When, however, he met a freighter going out with
      buffalo hides, he always had spare time to halt and talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett pushed on. His teams were young and powerful, and he
      carried grain to feed them, thus keeping up their strength
      while pushing them to the limit. The gray rolling expanse
      of Indian Territory changed to the greener, more undulating
      and ridged vastness of the Panhandle of Texas. Where ten
      days before it had been unusual to cross one stream in a
      day's travel, now they crossed several. All of these,
      however, were but shallow creeks or washes. The trees along
      these stream bottoms were green and beautiful, lending
      contrast to the waving level of the plains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly conceived the idea that under happy circumstances she
      would have found a new joy and freedom in riding down into
      this wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon, earlier than usual, Jett turned for good off
      the road, and following a tree-bordered stream for a couple
      of miles, pitched camp in a thick grove, where his wagons
      and tents could not readily be seen. Evidently this was not
      to be the usual one-night stand. If it were possible for
      Jett to be leisurely, he was so on this occasion. After
      helping unpack the wagons he gave orders to his men, and
      then saddling one of the horses he rode away under the
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dusk when he returned. Supper had been timed for his
      arrival. About him at this moment there was an expansion,
      an excitement, combined with bluff egotism. Milly
      anticipated what he announced in his big voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bunch of buffalo waterin' along here. We've run into the
      stragglers. It'll do to hang at this camp an' hunt while we
      wait to see if the big herd runs north."
    </p>
    <p>
      The announcement did not create any particular interest in
      his comrades. No one shared Jett's strong suppressed
      feeling. After supper he superintended the loading of
      shells and sharpening of knives, and the overlooking of the
      heavy rifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old needle gun for me!" he exclaimed. "Most hunters
      favor the big fifty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, the fifty's got it all over any other guns fer
      shootin' buffs at close range," responded Follonsbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We might have to shoot some other critters at long
      range--redskins, for instance," commented the leader,
      sardonically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett's superabundant vitality and force could not be
      repressed on this occasion. Apparently the end of the long
      journey had been cause for elation and anticipation, and
      also for an indulgence in drink. Milly had known before
      that Jett was addicted to the bottle. Under its influence,
      however, he appeared less harsh and hard. It tempered the
      iron quality in him. Likewise it roused his latent
      sentimental proclivities. Milly had more than once
      experienced some difficulty in avoiding them. She felt,
      however, that she need not worry any more on this score,
      while Mrs. Jett's jealous eyes commanded the scene. Still,
      Mrs. Jett could not be everlastingly at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turned out that Milly's fear was justified, for not long
      after this very idea presented itself, Jett took advantage
      of his wife being in the wagon, or somewhere not visible,
      to approach Milly as she sat in the door of the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milly, I'm goin' to be rich," he said in low hoarse tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes? That'll be--good," she replied, bending back a little
      from his heated face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, let's get rid of the old woman," he whispered. His
      eyes gleamed in the flickering firelight, with what seemed
      devilish humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who--what?" stammered Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know. The wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Jett! Get rid of her. . . . I--I don't understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, you're thicker 'n usual," he continued, with a laugh.
      "Think it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night," faltered Milly, and hurriedly slipped into
      her wagon and tried with trembling fingers to lace up the
      flaps of the door. Her head whirled. Was Jett merely drunk?
      Pondering over this incident, she was trying to convince
      herself that Jett meant no more than ill humor toward his
      wife, when she heard him speak a name that made her heart
      leap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hudnall, yes, I told you," he said, distinctly. "His
      outfit is somewhere in this neck of the woods. I saw his
      wheel tracks an' horse tracks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, how do you know they're Hudnall's outfit?" queried
      Follonsbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh! It's my business to know tracks," replied Jett,
      significantly. "There's two outfits camped below us. I saw
      horses an' smoke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rand, if I was runnin' this outfit I wouldn't hunt buffalo
      anywhere's near Hudnall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' why not?" demanded Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, you needn't jump down my throat. I jest have an idee.
      Hudnall's pardner, Pilchuck, is a plainsman, an'--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh! I don't care what the hell Pilchuck is," retorted
      Jett, gruffly ending the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

      <a name="c06" id="c06">CHAPTER VI</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Jett had chosen this secluded camp site, as he had all the
      others on the way down into the buffalo country, to render
      his whereabouts less liable to discovery. Anyone hunting
      for camps along the river would have found him, but the
      outfits traveling casually by would not have been aware of
      his proximity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he had everybody up at dawn, and never had his
      dominating force been so manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Catlee, your job is horses," he said, curtly. "Keep them
      on this side of the river. The road's on the other side.
      You'll find the best grass along this strip of timber. Some
      time to-day I'll ride in an' help you hitch up to haul
      hides."
    </p>
    <p>
      To his wife he gave a more significant order.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane, I don't want any fire burnin' except when I'm in
      camp with the men. You an' Milly keep your eyes open, an'
      if you see Indians or anybody, slip off in the brush an'
      hide."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he rode off, accompanied by Follonsbee and
      Pruitt. Manifestly the hunt was on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly, despite apprehension at the possibility of Indians,
      was glad to see the buffalo-hunters ride away. From what
      she had heard, this hide-hunting was an exceedingly
      strenuous business, consuming all of the daylight hours and
      half of the night. She had accepted her stepmother's sulky
      aloofness, finding relief also in that. The work given her
      to do she performed speedily and thoroughly. Then with a
      book and her sewing she slipped away from camp into the
      dense growth of underbrush.
    </p>
    <p>
      By taking time she threaded a way without undue
      difficulties, and finally came out upon a beautiful
      grass-covered and flower-dotted bank above the stream. The
      place delighted her. The camp was within call, yet might
      have been miles away; the brush leaned over the fragrant
      shady nook, and above spread the giant elms; the stream
      widened here at a turn and formed a pool, the only one she
      had seen on the ride. A wide strip of sand ran along the
      opposite slope. On that side the wood appeared open, and
      led gently up to the plain. Milly could see the bright sky
      line barred by black trunks of trees. The road ran along
      the edge of the timber, and if any travelers passed she
      could see them. What would she do if she recognized the
      Hudnall outfit? The very thought made her tremble. Perhaps
      such hope dominated her watching there. For the rest, she
      could have hours alone, to think and dream, or to sew and
      read, and all the time she could see everything opposite
      her without being seen herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not take long for her to discover that this place
      had much to distract her from meditation or work. Suddenly
      it awoke in her a feeling that she did not know she
      possessed. Solitude she had always yearned for, but beauty
      and nature, the sweetness of sylvan scene and melody of
      birds, as now revealed to her, had not heretofore been part
      of her experience. They seemed strangely harmonious with
      the vague and growing emotion in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly did not read or sew. Wild canaries and song-sparrows
      and swamp blackbirds were singing all around her. A low
      melodious hum of many bees came from the flowering brush
      above. Somewhere under the bank water was softly rippling.
      A kingfisher flew swiftly downstream, glinting in the
      sunlight. At the bend of the stream, on a jutting sandbar,
      stood a heron, motionless and absorbed, gazing down into
      the water. The warm fragrant air seemed to float drowsily
      toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peace and music of this scene were abruptly dispelled
      by crashing, thudding sound's from the slope opposite.
      Milly gazed across. Shaggy dark forms were passing from the
      open plain down into the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!--buffalo!" cried Milly, at once delighted and
      frightened. Her heart beat high. Gathering up her book and
      sewing, she was about to answer to the instinct to run when
      it occurred to her that she was on a steep bank high above
      the stream, out of danger. She decided to stand her ground.
      Sinking low behind a fringe of grass and flowers, she
      peeped over it, with bated breath and wide eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everywhere along the sky line of the wooded slope she saw
      the dark forms, not in a thick troop, but straggling in
      twos and threes. Lower down the foremost buffalo appeared,
      scattering dead leaves and raising the dust. A hundred
      yards below Milly the first buffalo came out of the woods
      upon the sand and crossed it to drink. Then gradually the
      line of bobbing brown humps emerged from the trees and grew
      closer and closer to Milly until she began to fear they
      would come right opposite to her. What wild, shaggy,
      ox-like beasts! If she had been fearful at first, she now
      grew frightened. Yet the wonder and majesty of these
      buffalo were not lost upon her. On they crashed out of the
      woods! She heard the splashing of the water. Like cattle at
      a long trough they lined up to the stream and bent huge
      woolly black heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If any come close--I'm going to run!" whispered Milly to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not appear, however, that she would have to resort
      to flight. The line of buffalo halted some fifty yards
      below her position. Thus she managed to avert utter panic,
      and as the moments passed her fears began to subside.
      Suddenly they were altogether dispelled. A number of
      buffalo broke ranks and turned again to the woods, leaving
      open spaces where tawny little buffalo calves could be
      seen. Milly experienced a feeling of utmost pleasure. All
      her life on the farm she had loved the little calves. These
      were larger, very wild looking, fuzzy and woolly, light in
      color, and did not appear, like the calves she had seen,
      weak and wabbly in their legs. These young animals were
      strong and nimble. Some left their mothers' sides and
      frisked along the sand a little way, in an unmistakable
      playfulness, yet unlike any play Milly had ever seen. They
      lifted themselves off their front feet and gave their heads
      a turning, butting movement, quite agile, and nothing if
      not aggressive. Then they fled back to their mothers. Only
      a few of these calves drank from the stream, and they did
      not appear thirsty, as did the matured buffalo. Gradually
      the ranks thinned, and then the last of the grown buffalo
      turned to the slope. The calves, though loath to leave that
      enchanting spot, did not tarry long behind. The herd
      leisurely trooped up the slope and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Milly it did not seem possible that she had actually
      seen buffalo close at hand. The reality was strikingly
      different from the impression she had gathered. Huge
      beasts, yet not ugly or mean! They seemed as tame as
      cattle. Certainly if unmolested they would never harm
      anyone. Suddenly the bang of heavy guns rang from far over
      the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jett and his hunters!" she exclaimed, in quick
      comprehension. "They are killing the buffalo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until that moment had the actual killing of
      buffalo--the meaning of it--crossed Milly's mind.
      Bang--bang--bang came the shots. They made her shrink.
      Those splendid beasts were being killed for their hides.
      Somehow it seemed base. What would become of the little
      calves? There dawned in Milly's mind an aversion for this
      hide-hunting. If the meat was to be used, even given to the
      hungry people of the world, then the slaughter might be
      condoned. But just to sell the hides!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom Doan is a hide-hunter, too," she soliloquized. "Oh,
      I'm sorry! . . . he looked so nice and kind. I guess I--I
      don't care much about him."
    </p>
    <p>
      What a man's vocation happened to be was really a serious
      matter to a woman. Milly recalled that one of the troubles
      between her mother and Jett had been his hatred of farm
      labor. Manifestly this hunting buffalo was to his liking,
      and perhaps he did not call it work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the incident of the buffalo coming down to drink had
      upset Milly's short period of revel in the sylvan place.
      Even when the muddy water cleared out of the stream, and
      the dust clouds disappeared from the woods, and the melody
      of birds and bees was renewed Milly did not recover the
      happy trend of feeling. Realization of the fact that Tom
      Doan was a hide-hunter had spoiled everything. Milly tried
      to read, and failing that she took up her sewing, which
      occupation had the virtue of being both necessity and
      pastime. For an hour or more the bang-bang of guns upon the
      plain above disturbed her. These reports appeared to get
      farther and farther away, until she could not hear them any
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after this, when she was returning to the dreamy
      mood, she heard a crashing of brush opposite and below her.
      Listening and peering in this direction, where the wood was
      thicker, she waited expectantly for buffalo to appear. The
      sound came at regular intervals. It made Milly nervous to
      become aware that these crashings were approaching a point
      directly opposite her. A growth of willows bordered the
      bank here, preventing her from seeing what might be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she heard heavy puffs--the breaths of a large beast.
      They sounded almost like the mingled panting and coughing
      of an animal strangling, or unable to breathe right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another crash very close sent cold chills over Milly. But
      she had more courage than on the first occasion. She saw
      the willows shake, and then spread wide to emit an enormous
      black head and hump of a buffalo. Milly seemed to freeze
      there where she crouched. This buffalo looked wild and
      terrible. He was heaving. A bloody froth was dripping from
      his extended tongue. His great head rolled from side to
      side. As he moved again, with a forward lurch, Milly saw
      that he was crippled. The left front leg hung broken, and
      flopped as he plunged to the water. On his left shoulder
      there was a bloody splotch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly could not remove her eyes from the poor brute. She
      saw him and all about him with a distinctness she could
      never forget. She heard the husky gurgle of water as he
      drank thirstily. Below him the slow current of the stream
      was tinged red. For what appeared a long time he drank.
      Then he raised his great head. The surroundings held no
      menace for him. He seemed dazed and lost. Milly saw the
      rolling eyes as he lurched and turned. He was dying. In
      horror Milly watched him stagger into the willows and
      slowly crash out of sight. After that she listened until
      she could no longer hear the crackling of brush and twigs.
      Then Milly relaxed and sank back into her former seat. Her
      horror passed with a strong shuddering sensation, leaving
      in her a sickening aversion to this murderous buffalo
      hunting.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The sun mounted high and the heat of the May day quieted
      the birds. The bees, however, kept up their drowsy hum. No
      more buffalo disturbed Milly's spasmodic periods of sewing
      and reading and the long spells of dreaming. Hours passed.
      Milly heard no horses or men, and not until the afternoon
      waned towards its close did she start back to camp. To
      retrace her steps was not an easy matter, but at last she
      wound her way through the brush to the open space. Camp was
      deserted, so far as any one stirring about was concerned.
      Milly missed one of the wagons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time later, while she was busy making her own cramped
      quarters more livable, she heard the voices of men, the
      thud of hoofs, and the creak of wheels. With these sounds
      the familiar oppression returned to her breast. Jett would
      soon be there, surly and hungry. Milly swiftly concluded
      her task and hurried down out of her wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the men came trooping into camp on foot, begrimed
      with dust and sweat and manifestly weary. Catlee was
      carrying a heavy burden of four guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett looked into his tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come out, you lazy jade," he called, roughly, evidently to
      his wife. "A buffalo wolf has nothin' on me for hunger."
      Then he espied Milly, who was in the act of lighting a
      fire. "Good! You'd make a wife, Milly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haw! Haw!" laughed Follonsbee, sardonically, as he threw
      down hat, gloves, vest, and spread his grimy hands. "No
      water! Gimme a bucket. If I had a wife there'd be water in
      camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh! You hawk-faced Yankee--there ain't no woman on earth
      who'd fetch water for you," taunted Pruitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, if Hank thinks he can teach Jane to fetch an' carry
      he's welcome to her," responded Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bluff and hearty badinage, full of contention as it
      was, marked a change in the demeanor of Jett and his men.
      Catlee, however, took no part in it. He was connected with
      Jett's outfit, but did not belong there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jett then appeared among them, and her advent,
      probably because of Jett's remark, occasioned
      ill-suppressed mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard what you said, Rand Jett," she retorted, glaring
      at him. "You can't make me welcome to any man, much less a
      hide thief like Hank Follonsbee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shut your face," returned Jett, in an entirely different
      tone. "You know your job. Rustle to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      That ended the approach to humor. When Follonsbee fetched
      the water they all washed and splashed with great gusto.
      This pleasant task finished, they showed plainly what
      little leisure was now possible to them, for they got their
      kits and began reloading shells and sharpening knives.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Catlee, you clean the guns," ordered Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus busily engaged they talked of the day's hunt--of
      the half hour of shooting that was fun and the eight hours
      of skinning that was labor--of the hide-stretching still to
      do before sleep could be thought of. Milly listened with
      keen ears in the hope they might drop some word of the
      Hudnall outfit, but she spent her attention in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Mrs. Jett called, "Come to supper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or you'll throw it out, huh?" queried Jett, rising with
      alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      They ate hurriedly and prodigiously, in silence, and each
      man reached for what he wanted without asking. Jett was the
      first to finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fill up, you hawgs," he said to his comrades; "we've work
      to do.--Jane, you an' Milly clean up--then go to bed. We'll
      be just outside the grove, stretchin' hides."
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly lay awake a long while that night, yet did not hear
      the men return. Next day they had breakfast before sunrise
      and were off with a rush. Milly spent quiet hours on the
      shady bank, where the sweetness and music were undisturbed.
      Another day passed in which she saw nothing of the men
      except at the morning and evening meal hours. Jett and his
      helpers were settling into the strenuous routine of
      hide-hunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth day they broke camp and traveled twenty miles
      down the same side of the river, to halt in the only clump
      of trees Milly had noted for hours. Next morning Jett's men
      were again hunting buffalo. That night they did not return
      until long after dark. Milly had gone to bed, but she heard
      their gruff, weary voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day was again one of breaking camp and
      traveling south. Milly observed that the country changed,
      while yet it seemed the same; and she concluded that it was
      the vastness and wildness which grew. Next morning she
      heard shooting up until noon. She was so grateful to be
      left alone that the hours seemed to fly. There was always a
      place where she could hide near camp, and Jett seldom
      forgot to mention this. As they journeyed farther south his
      vigilance as well as his excitement increased day by day.
      From the camp-fire talk Milly gathered that both the number
      of buffalo and of hunters were augmenting. Yet Jett
      appeared to have established the rule of traveling one day
      and hunting the next. As he progressed the work grew more
      arduous. There was no road over this endless plain, and the
      level stretches were cut up, sometimes necessitating the
      unloading and reloading of the wagons. May warmed to June.
      The plain was now one wide rolling expanse of green, waving
      gently to every breeze; the stream courses were marked by a
      line of deeper green, trees now in full foliage. Herds of
      buffalo began to show to the east of this stream Jett was
      following. His hunting, however, he did on the west side,
      where Milly understood the buffalo ranged in larger
      numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Jett traveled two days southward and then crossed
      the stream to its west bank. Following it down on that
      side, he was halted by a large river.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, boys, here's the Red, an' it's our stampin' ground
      this summer," he rolled out, sonorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a camp he chose a spot hard to reach, as well as hard
      to espy from above. A forest of timber and brush bordered
      both sides of this Red River, and once down in it neither
      river nor plain could be seen. Jett spent the remainder of
      that day making permanent camp. Follonsbee, whom he had
      sent on a reconnoitering ride up the river, returned about
      sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe I saw fifty square miles of buffalo," he
      announced, impressively, sitting in his saddle and gazing
      down at the leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh! I took that for granted," replied Jett. "How far did
      you go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon about five miles up an' climbed a big bluff above
      the river. Could see for miles. An' shore that sight
      stumped me. Why, Rand, I couldn't see the end of buffalo,
      an' I was usin' the telescope, too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's more to the point--how many outfits could you
      spot?" demanded Jett, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, I spotted enough, an' some to spare," drawled the
      other. "West of the bluff I seen camp smokes all along the
      river, as far as I could see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any camps close?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only two between ours an' the bluff," replied Follonsbee.
      "Then there's one on the point across the creek. Reckon
      outfits are strung down the river, too. Buffalo
      everywhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahuh! It's the main herd. Now, I wonder will they run
      north."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon so. But if they do they'll turn back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You figger on their bein' blocked by the gang of
      hide-hunters behind us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prezactly. We couldn't be in a better stand. This big herd
      is massed in a triangle. River on the south; Staked Plain
      on the west, an' on the third side thousands of hunters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. It's seems that way. Mighty big bit of country, but
      it <i>is</i> a trap."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do the Indians come in your calculatin'?" queried
      Follonsbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nowhere. If they get mean the buffalo-hunters will band
      together an' do what the soldiers couldn't do--chase the
      damned redskins up in their Staked Plain an' kill them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, it looks like a hell of a summer, huh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon so, all around. It means the end of the buffalo,
      an' that means peace with the Indians, whether they fight
      or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rand, this is the huntin' ground of Comanches, Cheyennes,
      Kiowas, an' Arapahoes. The land an' the buffalo are
      theirs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Theirs--hell!" exploded Jett, in contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore I know your sentiments," returned Follonsbee, rather
      shortly. "Like most of these hide-hunters, you say wipe the
      redskins off the earth. To me it looks like a dirty trick.
      I'd rather steal from a white man than an Indian. . . . But
      I'm givin' you my idee for what it's worth. We'll have to
      fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett appeared for the moment in a brown study, while he
      paced up and down, swinging a short rope he had in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the Indians are on the war-path, as we hear, won't they
      wait till this bunch of hunters has a big store of hides on
      hand--before startin' that fight?" he queried, shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon they would," admitted Follonsbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' when they do come raidin', we're goin' to get the
      hunch in plenty of time, aren't we?" went on Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shore have a fine stand. With hunters east an' west of
      us, an' millions of buffalo out there, we can't hardly be
      surprised."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, then, what's eatin' you?" growled Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothin.' I was just gettin' things clear. We're agreed on
      the main points. Now one more. The sooner we make a big
      stake, the better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett nodded a significant acquiescence to that query, and
      then went about his tasks. Follonsbee, dismounting, took
      the saddle off his horse. Soon after that Mrs. Jett called
      them to supper.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      At this camp Milly lost her wagon as an abode, a
      circumstance, on the moment, much to her displeasure. The
      wagon, being high off the ground, and with its box sides,
      had afforded more of protection, if not comfort. Jett had
      removed hoops and canvas bodily and had established them as
      a tent, a little distance from the main camp. Milly
      pondered apprehensively over this removal by some rods from
      the rest of the tents. Perhaps Mrs. Jett had inspired this
      innovation, and if so Milly felt that she would welcome it.
      But she had doubts of every move made by the leader of the
      outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon entering the improvised tent Milly found that she
      could not stand erect, but in all other particulars it was
      an improvement. She could lace both doors tightly,
      something impossible when the tent was on the wagon. She
      unrolled her bed and made it up. Then she unpacked and
      unfolded her clothes and hung them conveniently at the
      back. Her bag, with its jumbled assortment of things she
      had thought so poor, now, in the light of this wild travel,
      assumed proportions little short of precious. She could
      have been worse off--something which before had never
      crossed her mind. Without soap, linen and muslin, a sewing
      kit, mirror, a few books, and many other like articles, she
      would have found this camp life in the wilderness something
      formidable to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she went outside again daylight was still strong and
      the afterglow of sunset was spreading in beautiful
      effulgence over the western sky. Milly gazed about her. It
      appeared that a jungle lay between camp and the river. Jett
      and his men were in earnest and whispered council, with
      guns and tools and ammunition for the moment forgotten.
      Mrs. Jett sat a forlorn and sullen figure in front of her
      tent. Milly needed and wanted exercise. She began to walk
      around the camp. No one paid any heed to her. Indeed, since
      reaching the buffalo fields, she had become a negligible
      attraction, for which she was devoutly thankful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summer had indeed come to this northern part of Texas. The
      air was drowsy and warm. She found a few belated flowers
      blossoming in a shaded place. A spring bubbled from under a
      bank, and as she passed it frogs plumped into the water.
      She heard the mournful cooing of turtledoves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly found a trail that evidently made short cut of the
      distance up to the plain, and she followed it, not without
      misgivings. Jett, however, did not call her, and emboldened
      by this she ventured on. The slope was gradual and covered
      by heavy timber. Her heart began to beat and her breath to
      come and go quickly. She felt her stagnant blood enliven to
      the call made upon it. She saw a flare of gold and rose sky
      beyond the black tree trunks. It was not so very far from
      camp--this first level of the plain. She wanted to see the
      great herd of buffalo. Thus engrossed, she went on to the
      edge of the timber, and halted there to gaze outward. A
      wonderful green plain stretched away to the west, rising
      gradually. It was barren of animals. The rich colors of the
      afterglow were fading. Was that a level purple-gray bank of
      cloud along the horizon or a range of upland hills?
    </p>
    <p>
      A clip-clop of trotting horse made her start sharply.
      Wheeling, she espied a rider close upon her. He had come
      from round a corner of the wooded slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly took backward steps, meaning to slip out of sight.
      But the rider had seen her. Coming on so quickly, while she
      was slow in moving, he rode right upon her, and uttering an
      exclamation of surprise, he leaped from the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sight of him down on the ground where Milly could see him
      better gave her a galvanizing shock. Was this tall young
      man the image of her dreams? She stared. He took a step
      forward, his ruddy face lighting. He seemed strange
      somehow, yet she knew him. His eyes pierced her, and she
      suddenly shook with a sure recognition of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milly!" he cried, incredulously. His tone held the same
      wonderful thing that was in his look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--it is you!" burst out Milly, all at once beside
      herself. She ran straight to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milly! Say--what luck!--I'd given up ever seeing you
      again," he said, trying to hold her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom--Doan!" she ejaculated in realization, She felt the
      hot blood flame in her face. Shamed and frightened, yet
      tingling with a joy nothing could check, she backed
      falteringly away. His glad eyes held her gaze, though she
      strove to avert it. Had he changed? His face was thinner,
      darker, a red bronze where it had been clear tan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure it's Tom Doan," he replied in delight. "So you
      remembered me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remembered--you?" faltered Milly. "I--I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud halloo from the wooded slope below interrupted her.
      It was Jett's voice, calling her back to camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Jett," she whispered, hurriedly. "He must not see
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go back. You've time. He's far off," replied Doan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes--I must go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen--just a second," he whispered, following her,
      taking her hand. He seemed intense. "Hudnall's camp is only
      a few miles up the river. I'm with him, you know. Meet me
      here to-night when the moon comes up. That'll be early."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here--at night?" murmured Milly, tremulously. The idea was
      startling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. At moonrise. Promise!" he entreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be afraid. I'll be waiting for you--right here. . .
      . Go back to camp now. Don't give yourself away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he shot her a bright, intent look and strode
      noiselessly away, leading his horse into the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly wheeled to run down into the woods, almost coming to
      disaster in her excitement. It was farther to camp than she
      thought and some parts of the trail necessitated care in
      the gathering twilight. Jett did not appear to be coming
      after her. In a few moments she recovered from her
      breathless headlong precipitation. The flicker of a camp
      fire shone through the woods, and that would have guided
      her had she lost the plain trail. Thoughts and emotions
      relative to the meeting with Tom Doan were held in
      abeyance. She must hurry back to camp and allay Jett's
      suspicions or fears concerning her. Dusk had fallen when
      she reached camp, which she approached leisurely. She saw
      Jett and all his outfit grouped round the camp fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where've you been?" he asked, gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Walking under the trees," she replied, easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't you answer me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I have to yell because you do?" she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haw! Haw! Haw!" roared Follonsbee, and he gave Pruitt a
      dig in the ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal," continued Jett, evidently satisfied, "when it gets
      dark that's your bedtime. Jane can set up all night if she
      likes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I've no need of sleep, eh?" demanded the woman,
      sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you're a handsome jade," responded Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly found in the situation a development of her own
      resourcefulness. She did not want this hour after supper to
      appear different from any other; so she stood a moment back
      of the circle of light, watching the camp fire, and then
      going to where the water pail stood she took a drink.
      Leisurely then she moved away to her tent. How fortunate
      now that it stood apart from the others!
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly crawled inside to flop down on her bed. For a moment
      the self-restraint under which she had been taut lingered
      by reason of its very intensity. Then suddenly it broke. In
      the darkness of her tent she was safe. Thought of Jett and
      his outfit flashed into oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--what has happened? What have I done? What am I going
      to do?" she whispered to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all rushed back, strong and sweet and bewildering. She
      had to fight feeling in order to think. Some incredibly
      good instinct had prompted her to stray away from camp. Tom
      Doan! She had met him. In all that wide vast wilderness the
      one and only person she had met was the one she yearned
      for. She had spoken to him; she had promised to meet him
      later when the moon rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tremendous as was the import of these facts, it did not
      seem all. What had happened? With mounting pulse she forced
      herself to recall everything, from the moment she had heard
      the horse. How she strung out the sensations of that
      meeting! Had she felt them all then? No--some of them, the
      deeper ones, were an augmenting of those which had been
      thoughtless. Could she ever gather into one comprehensive
      actuality the wildness of amaze, joy, and hope that had
      constituted her recognition of Tom Doan? What had gone on
      in her mind all these endless days? Futile to try to
      understand why! She had almost run straight into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I--I had no time to think!" she whispered, with her
      burning face buried in the blankets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night and darkness and silence and loneliness could not
      help Milly now. She was in the throes of bursting love.
      Unawares it had stolen insidiously into all her waking and
      perhaps sleeping hours--and then, in an unguarded moment,
      when chance threw Tom Doan again into her presence, it had
      brazenly surprised her into betrayal. She knew now. And she
      lay there suffering, thrilling, miserable, and rapturous by
      turns. It was a trying hour. But it passed and there
      followed another mood, one wanting only proof, assurance of
      her wild dream, to border on exquisite happiness. She
      forgot herself and thought of Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw him as clearly as if she had been gazing at him in
      the light of the sun. Older, thinner, graver, harder his
      face came back to her. There were lines he had not had, and
      a short fuzzy beard, as fair as his hair. There had been
      about him the same breath of the open plain and the buffalo
      and gunpowder and sweating brown that characterized Jett
      and his men. This could account for the hardness, perhaps
      for every change in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only his eyes and the tone of his voice had seemed the
      same. And in recalling them there flooded over her a
      consciousness of the joy he had expressed at meeting her
      again. He had been as happy as she. It was impossible to
      doubt that. Without thought of himself or of what he was
      doing he had answered as naturally to the meeting as she
      had. Friendlessness, loneliness always had engendered a
      terrible need for love; and this raw life in the
      buffalo-fields, in the company of hard men and a woman who
      hated her, had but added a yearning for protection. Milly
      could understand; she could excuse herself. Yet that did
      not help much. It was all so sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed in her new-born emotions, Milly had no cognizance
      of the passing of the hours. But when the gloom inside of
      her tent lightened and the canvas showed shadows of leaves
      moving and waving, she realized that the moon had risen.
      Trembling all over, she listened. The camp was silent. When
      had the men gone to bed? Only the murmur of insects and
      soft rustle of wind kept the silence from being dead. She
      peeped out. Low down through the trees a silvery radiance
      told of a rising moon. As Milly watched, with a growing
      palpitation in her breast, a white disk appeared and almost
      imperceptibly moved upward, until half the great beautiful
      moon sailed into her sight, crossed by black branches of
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's time to go," she whispered, and felt a cold thrill.
      She realized her danger, yet had no fear. If discovered in
      the act of meeting a lover she would surely be severely
      beaten, perhaps killed. But nothing could have kept Milly
      from keeping that tryst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cautiously she crawled out on hands and knees, and then
      away from the tent, keeping in the shadow. A log on the
      camp fire flickered brightly. She saw the pale gleam of the
      tents and her keen ear caught heavy breathing of one of the
      tired sleepers. At length she rose to her feet and, moving
      away silently, she lost sight of all round the camp except
      the fire. Then she circled in the direction of the trail
      that led up the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her nervous dread of being caught passed away, leaving only
      excitement. She did not know where to look for the trail,
      except that it started somewhere at the base of the slope
      behind the camp. She would find it. How big and black the
      elms! Shadows lay thick. Only here and there showed the
      blanched patches of moonlight. A stealthy step, a rustling,
      halted her and gave a different tingle to her pulse. Some
      soft-footed animal stole away into the obscurity. Relieved,
      she moved slowly to and fro, peering in the grass at her
      feet, searching for the trail. She remembered that it had
      led down to the spring and not to Jett's camp. As the
      spring lay east she worked that way. At last she stepped
      into the trail and then her heart throbbed faster. He would
      be waiting. What should she say?
    </p>
    <p>
      As she climbed with swift steps the shadows under the trees
      grew less dense. Then she faced a long aisle where her own
      shadow preceded her. Beyond that she passed into thicker
      timber where it was dark, and she had to go slowly to hold
      to the trail. An incautious step resulted in the sharp
      cracking of a twig. It startled her. How lonely and wild
      the woods!
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly reached level ground, and there not far was the end
      of the trees, now standing out clear and black against a
      wide moonlit plain. She glided faster, drawn in spite of
      herself, hurrying to meet him. Vague were her conjectures:
      sweet were her fears. She ran the last few yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she entered the zone of moonlight and stood expectantly,
      peering everywhere, she felt the terrible importance of
      that moment. He was her only friend. Where was he? Had she
      come too early? If he had not . . . Then a tall dark form
      glided out into the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milly!" came the low, eager voice. He hurried to her, drew
      her back into the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly's strained eagerness and the intensity of purpose
      that had brought her there suddenly succumbed to weakness.
      His presence, his voice, his touch changed her
      incomprehensibly. In desperation she tried to cling to her
      resolve not to be like she had been at that first meeting
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you'd never come," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I--late?" she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no matter, now you're here," he replied, and took her
      into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--you mustn't," she entreated pushing back from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what's wrong?" he queried, in sudden concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a silence fraught with exquisite torture for Milly she
      stood there, quivering against him. He put a hand under her
      chin and forced her head up, so that he could see her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Girl, look at me," he ordered, and it was certain that he
      shook her a little. "Don't you know what I mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly felt that she must drop then. Almost the last of her
      strength and courage had vanished. Yet she was impelled to
      look up at him, and even in the shadow of the trees she saw
      the fire in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could I know--when you've never told--me?" she
      whispered, haltingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you--that's what," he flung at her. "Do you have to
      be told in words?"
    </p>
    <p>
      How imperative that was he could never have understood. It
      quite robbed her of will. She swayed to him with her head
      on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milly, did I take you in the wrong way?" he asked, bending
      over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How--did you take--me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you must care for me." Fear and anxiety vied with a
      happy masterfulness in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do <i>you</i> have to be told in words?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he answered, low, and bent to her lips. "But tell me
      both ways."
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly might have yielded to his importunity had his ardor
      left her any force. But she could only lean against him and
      cling to him with weak hands, in happiness that was pain.
      For a while then he held her in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your name?" he asked, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mildred Fayre," she found voice to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How old are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seventeen--nearly eighteen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ever love any other man before me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, then you do?" he queried, bending to kiss her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know that I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you be my wife?" he flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very day I am of age--if you want me so soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Want you!--I've wanted you so badly I've been sick,
      miserable. It was not so terrible at first. It grew on me.
      But I loved you from the moment I said I might never see
      you again. Do you remember?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Tom Doan, I remember as well as you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you do? Well, when did you love me? I'm curious. It's
      too good to be true. Tell me when."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since the instant I looked over that horse to see you
      standing there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milly!" He was incredulous, and as if to make sure of his
      good fortune he fell to caressing her.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Later then, sitting against one of the trees, with his arm
      round her waist, Milly told him the story of her life. She
      did not dwell long on the poverty and hard work of her
      childhood, nor the vanishing hopes and ideals of her school
      days, nor the last sordid months that had been so hard to
      endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You poor girl! Well, we must have been made for each
      other," he replied, and briefly told his own story. Life
      had been hard work for him, too, full of loss, and
      lightened by little happiness. Evidently it hurt him to
      confess that his father had been a guerilla under
      Quantrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always was a farmer," he concluded. "I dreamed of a fine
      ranch, all my own. And I'm going to have it. Milly, I'm
      making big money in this buffalo-hide business. I'll be
      rich. I'll have you, too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly shared his rapture and did not have the heart to
      speak of her disapproval of his killing buffalo, nor of her
      fear of Jett. She embraced joy for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night hours wore on and the moon soared high in the
      heavens, full, silvery white, flooding the plain with
      light. Out there coyotes were yelping their sharp wild
      notes. From the river bottom came the deep bay of a wolf.
      An owl hooted dismally. All of this wildness and beauty
      seemed part of Milly's changed and uplifted life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, you must go back to your camp," said Doan at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--must I? I may never see you again!" she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plague me with my own words, will you?" he retorted, and
      his kisses silenced her. "Will you meet me here to-morrow
      night, soon as your folks are asleep?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come then. It grows late. Lead the way, down, for I'm
      going as far as I dare with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Within sight of the pale gleam of the tents he bade her
      good-by and silently stole back into the shadow of the
      slope. Milly as stealthily reached her tent and slipped
      into it, full of heart and wide awake, to lie in her bed,
      realizing that in gratefulness for the changed world and
      the happiness she would now never relinquish, she must go
      back to the prayers of her childhood.
    </p>

    <h1>
      <a name="c07" id="c07">CHAPTER VII</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      At dawn the singing of wild canaries awakened Milly Fayre.
      There must have been a flock of them that had alighted on
      the elm tree which sheltered her tent. She listened,
      finding in the sweet treble notes an augury for her future.
      How good to awaken to such music and thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud hoarse yawn from the direction of camp proclaimed
      the rising of one of the men. Soon after that a sharp ring
      of Jett's ax drove away the canaries. Rays of rosy light
      penetrated the slit of Milly's tent, final proof that
      another day had come. Milly felt a boundless swell of life
      within her. Never before had any day dawned like this one!
      She lingered in her bed long after the crackling of the
      camp fire and the metallic clinking of Dutch oven and
      skillet attested to the task of breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey, Milly, you're gettin' worse than the old lady!"
      called out Jett, in voice for once without gruffness. "Are
      you dead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm very much alive," replied Milly, almost in glee at the
      double meaning of her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pile out, then," added Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly did not hurry so much as usual; a subtle courage had
      stirred in her; she felt inspired to outwit Jett. Yet she
      meant to pretend submission to his rule. Her hope was
      strong that the arduous toil of hunting and skinning
      buffalo would continue to leave Jett little time in camp,
      and none to molest her with evil intentions. He was too
      obsessed to make money to spare time for drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, the bombardin' has begun," Follonsbee was heard to
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some early birds that's new to buffalo huntin'," replied
      Jett. "My experience is you get only so much shootin' in a
      day. I reckon, though, with the stragglin' bunches of this
      big herd rompin' to an' fro, we'll hear shootin' all day
      long."
    </p>
    <p>
      The men were gone when Milly presented herself at the camp
      fire. She ate so little that Mrs. Jett noted the absence of
      her usual appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sick?" she asked, with something of solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I just don't feel hungry," replied Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got a high color. Looks like a fever," said the
      woman, her bright bold eyes studying Milly's face. "Better
      let me mix you a dose of paregoric."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, no. I'm all right," returned Milly. But despite
      her calm assurance she was intensely annoyed to feel an
      added heat in her flushed cheeks. It might not be so easy
      to fool this woman. Milly divined, however, that it was not
      beyond the bounds of possibility for Mrs. Jett to be
      sympathetic regarding Tom Doan. Still, Milly dare not trust
      such impulsive premonition. She performed her accustomed
      tasks more expeditiously and even better than usual, then
      repaired to her tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that the interminable hours faced her. How many till
      moonrise! They seemed everlasting and insupportable. She
      could neither read nor sew; all she could do was to sit
      with idle hands, thinking. At length, however, she
      discovered that this very thinking, such as it had come to
      be, was happiness itself. She had only the short morning
      and evening tasks now, and all the hours to wait here in
      this permanent camp for the stolen meetings with Tom Doan.
      Hours that would become days and weeks, even months, all to
      wait for him! She embraced the fact. Loneliness was no
      longer fearful. She had a wonderful secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was still and warm, not so hot as on other
      days, by reason of a cloudily hazed sky. The birds had gone
      away, and there was not a sound close at hand. But from the
      plain above and from across the stream that flowed into the
      Red River, and from all around it seemed, when she
      concentrated her attention, there came the detonations of
      guns. None were close by, and most appeared very distant.
      They had no regularity, yet there were but few intervals of
      perfect silence. On the other hand, sometimes a traveling
      volley of reports would begin away in the distance and
      apparently come closer and then gradually withdraw to die
      away. A few shots together appeared a rare occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At every shot perhaps some poor buffalo falls--dead--or
      dying like that great crippled bull I saw. Augh!" exclaimed
      Milly, in revulsion at the thought. "I'd hate to have Tom
      Doan grow rich from murdering buffalo. . . . But he said he
      did not kill many--that he was a skinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then her ears seemed to fill with a low murmur or faint
      roar, like the rumble of distant thunder. At first she
      thought a storm was brewing out toward the Staked Plain,
      but the thunder was too steady and continuous. In surprise,
      she strained her hearing. Long low roar! What could it be?
      She had heard about the rumble of an earthquake and for a
      moment felt fear of the mysterious and unknown force under
      the earth. But this was a moving sound that came on the
      still summer air. It could be made only by buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The thundering herd!" exclaimed Milly in awe. "That's what
      Jett called it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened until the roar very slowly receded and
      diminished and rolled away into silence. Still the shooting
      continued, and this puzzled Milly because it was reasonable
      to suppose that if the hunters were pursuing the herd the
      sound of their guns would likewise die away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly wandered round the camp, exploring places in the
      woods, and several times resisted a desire to go up the
      trail to the edge of the plain. Finally she yielded to it,
      halting under cover of the last trees, gazing out over the
      green expanse. It was barren as ever. The banging of guns
      appeared just as far away, just as difficult to locate.
      Milly wished she could climb high somewhere so that she
      might see over the surrounding country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near by stood a tree of a kind she did not know. It had
      branches low down and rose under one of the tall elms.
      Milly decided she would be much less likely to be seen up
      in a tree; besides, she could have her desire gratified. To
      this end she climbed the smaller tree, and from it into the
      elm, working to a high fork not easily attained. Then she
      gazed about her, and was so amazed and bewildered by the
      panorama that she had to exert her will to attend to any
      particular point of the compass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Westward the green prairie rose in a grand fan-shaped slope
      of many leagues, ending in the horizon-wide upheaval of
      bold gray naked earth which the hunters called the Staked
      Plain. It was as level-topped as a table, wild, remote,
      austere, somehow menacing, like an unscalable wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of that vast stretch of green plain there
      were miles and miles of black patches, extending north and
      south as far as eye could see. Though they seemed
      motionless at that distance Milly recognized them as
      buffalo. Surely they could not be parts of the herd whence
      came the low, thundering roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far to the left, along the shining green-bordered river,
      there appeared a belt of moving buffalo, moving to the
      southwest, and disappearing in what seemed a pall of dust.
      By turning her ear to that direction and holding her breath
      Milly again caught the low roar, now very faint. Much
      banging of guns came from that quarter. Out on the plain
      from this belt were small herds of buffalo, hundreds of
      them, dotting the green, and some were in motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Milly espied thin threads of black moving across the
      river. Buffalo swimming to the southern bank! These were
      several miles away, yet she saw them distinctly, and line
      after line they extended, like slender bridges, across the
      river until they, too, vanished in the curtain of dust.
      South of the river the boundless plain showed irregular
      ragged areas of black, and meandering threads, leading into
      the haze of distance. Eastward Milly gazed over a green
      river-bottom jungle, thick and impenetrable, to the level
      prairie blackened with buffalo. Here were straggling lines
      moving down toward the river. Altogether, then, the
      surrounding scene was one of immense openness, infinite
      waving green prairie crossed by widely separated streams,
      and made majestic by the domination of buffalo--everywhere
      buffalo, countless almost as the grasses of the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pity they must die!" murmured Milly. For in the
      banging of the guns she heard the death knell of this
      multiplicity of beasts. She had seen the same in the hard,
      greedy, strong faces of Jett, and buffalo-hunters like him.
      Nature with its perfect balance and adjustment of the wild
      beasts was nothing to Jett. He would kill every buffalo on
      the plains for the most he could get, if it were only a
      bottle of rum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly pondered over vague ideas in her developing mind. God
      might have made the buffalo to furnish the Indians and
      white men with meat and fur, but surely not through the
      sordidness of a few to perish from the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above Milly, in the blue sky, and westward till her sight
      failed, were huge black birds, buzzards, sailing high and
      low, soaring round and round, till the upper air seemed
      filled with them. Buzzards! Birds of prey they
      were--carrion-eaters, vultures that were enticed from their
      natural habits, from the need for which nature created
      them, to fall foul on this carnage left by the hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these uncanny birds of prey swooped down over
      Milly, and several alighted in a tree not far distant.
      Solemn, repulsive, they inspired in Milly a fear of the
      thing called nature. Were they necessary?
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not long remain up there in her perch, and she
      discovered that descent was not so easy as climbing.
      Nevertheless she got by the worst of it without mishap, and
      then she breathed easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thud of hoofs below caused her to stop abruptly.
      Horsemen were somewhere close at hand. Owing to the thick
      foliage she could not see what or where they were. Circling
      the trunk of the tree with her arm she leaned against it,
      making sure of her balance. She was still thirty feet from
      the ground, adequately hidden by bushy leaves, unless some
      one looked upward from directly beneath her. It was natural
      to suppose these riders were buffalo-hunters. Presently she
      espied them, indistinctly through the network of branches.
      They were riding from the north, evidently having come
      along the stream. To Milly's consternation they halted
      their horses almost directly under her. Then she made out
      that they were soldiers. She need have no fear of them, yet
      she did not like the idea of being discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain," spoke up one, "there's a good spring down this
      trail. I'd like a drink of fresh cold water.--Here, one of
      you men take some canteens down and fill them. The trail
      leads to the spring."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the half dozen soldiers dismounted, and collecting
      several canteens from his companions he lounged off out of
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ellsworth, you know this Red River country?" spoke up
      another soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon I do, though not very well down this far," came the
      reply. "This is God's country compared to the Staked Plain.
      I know that well enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I figure we're on a wild-goose chase," said another,
      evidently an officer. He had dismounted to fling himself
      under one of the trees. He removed his sombrero to reveal a
      fine, strong, weather-beaten face, with mustache slightly
      gray. "We can never persuade these hide-hunters to go to
      the fort on account of Indian raids."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon not. But we can persuade them to send their women
      to a place of safety. Some of the fools have their women
      folk. For my part, I'd like to see these hunters band
      together against the Indians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, they're a hard lot and Lord only knows how many
      there are of them. They'll do what we soldiers never could
      do--whip that combination of redskin tribes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better not say that in the colonel's hearing," said the
      officer, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't mind. Reckon I've hinted as much. I'm serving
      on scout duty, you know. But one thing's sure, these
      hide-hunters have started a bloody mess. And it's a good
      thing. This section of Texas is rich land. It's the
      stamping-ground of the Indians. They'll never give it up
      till the buffalo are gone. Then they'll make peace. As it
      is now they are red-headed as hell. They'll ambush and
      raid--then run back up into that devil's place, the Staked
      Plains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll bet you we get a taste of it before this summer
      ends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like as not. If so, you'll remember the campaign," said
      the other, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the soldier returned with the canteens, which
      manifestly were most welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a camp below, sir," said the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buffalo outfit, of course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Three wagons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ask whose outfit it is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one about camp, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer got to his feet, and wiping his heated face, he
      stepped to his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ellsworth, we've passed a good many camps of hide-hunters,
      all out in the open or along the edge of the timber. What
      do you make of an outfit camped way down out of sight.
      That's a hard pull for loaded wagons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hunters have notions, same as other men," replied the
      scout. "Maybe this fellow wants as much protection as
      possible from storm and dust. Maybe he'd rather get out of
      the beaten track."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Colonel's orders were to find trace of hide thieves," said
      the officer, thoughtfully. "That stumps me. They're
      hundreds of these outfits, all traveling, killing, skinning
      together. How on earth are we going to pick out thieves
      among them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't, Captain," returned the scout, decidedly.
      "That'll be for the hunters themselves to find. As I said,
      they're a hard lot and jumbled one. Outlaws, ex-soldiers,
      adventurers, desperadoes, tenderfeet, plainsmen, and
      pioneers looking for new ground, and farmers out on a hunt
      to make money. I reckon most of them are honest men. This
      hide-hunting is something like the gold rush of '49 and
      '51, of course on a small scale. Last summer and fall there
      were hide thieves operating all through the Panhandle. A
      few of them got caught, too, and swung for it. This summer
      they'll have richer picking and easier. For with the Indian
      raids to use as cover for their tracks how can they be
      apprehended, unless caught in the act?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, man, you mean these robbers waylay an outfit, kill
      them, steal the hides, burn the camp, and drive off to let
      the dirty work be blamed on Indians?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon that's exactly what I do mean," replied Ellsworth.
      "It's my belief a good many black deeds laid to the Indians
      are done by white men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you tell the colonel that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and he scouted the idea. He hates Indians. Got a
      bullet in him somewhere. I reckon he'd rather have bad
      white men on the plains than good Indians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" ejaculated the officer, and mounting his horse he
      led the soldiers west along the edge of the timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly waited a good while before she ventured to descend
      from her perch; and when she reached the ground she ran
      down into the woods, slowing to a walk when within sight of
      camp. She repaired to her tent, there to lie down and rest
      and think. She had something to ponder over. That
      conversation of the scout and officer had flashed grave
      conjectures into her mind. Could her stepfather be one of
      the hide thieves? She grew cold and frightened with the
      thought; ashamed of herself, too; but the suspicion would
      not readily down. Jett had some queer things against him,
      that might, to be sure, relate only to his unsociable
      disposition, and the fact, which he had mentioned, that he
      did not want men to see her. Milly recalled his excuse on
      this occasion, and in the light of the soldiers'
      conversation it did not ring quite true. Unless Jett had a
      personal jealous reason for not wanting men to see her!
      Once she had feared that. Of late it had seemed an
      exaggeration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fearful as was the thought, she preferred it to be that
      which made him avoid other camps and outfits, than that he
      be a hide thief and worse. But her woman's instinct had
      always prompted her to move away from Jett. She was
      beginning to understand it. She owed him obedience, because
      he was her stepfather and was providing her with a living.
      Nothing she owed, however, or tried to instil into her
      vacillating mind, quite did away with that insidious
      suspicion. There was something wrong about Jett. She
      settled that question for good. In the future she would
      listen and watch, and spy if chance offered, and use her
      wits to find out whether or not she was doing her
      stepfather an injustice.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The moon took an unconscionably long time to rise that
      night, Milly thought. But at last she saw the brightening
      over the river, and soon after, the round gold rim slide up
      into the tree foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her task of safely leaving camp this evening was rendered
      more hazardous by the fact that Jett and his men were near
      the camp, engaged in laborious work of stretching and
      pegging hides. They had built a large fire in a wide
      cleared space to the left of the camp. Milly could both see
      and hear them--the dark moving forms crossing to and fro
      before the blaze, and the deep voices. As she stole away
      under the trees she heard the high beat of her heart and
      felt the cold prickle of her skin; yet in the very peril of
      the moment--for Jett surely would do her harm if he caught
      her--there was an elation at her daring and her revolt
      against his rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halfway up the trail she met her lover, who was slowly
      coming down. To his eager whispered "Milly" she responded
      with an eager "Tom," as she returned his kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom led her to a grassy spot at the foot of a tree which
      was in shadow. They sat there for a while, hand in hand, as
      lovers who were happy and unafraid of the future, yet who
      were not so obsessed by their dream that they forgot
      everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't stay long," said Tom, presently. "I've two hours
      pegging out to do to-night. Let's plan to meet here at this
      spot every third night, say a half hour after dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," whispered Milly. "I always go to my tent at
      dark. Sometimes, though, it might be risky to slip out at a
      certain time. If I'm not here you wait at least an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they planned their meetings and tried to foresee and
      forestall all possible risks, and from that drifted to talk
      about the future. Despite Tom's practical thought for her
      and tenderness of the moment, Milly sensed a worry on his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, what's troubling you?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, do you care anything for this stepfather of
      yours?" he queried, in quick reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jett? I hate him. . . . Perhaps I ought to be ashamed. He
      feeds me, clothes me, though I feel I earn that. Why do you
      ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if you cared for him I'd keep my mouth shut," said
      Tom. "But as you hate him what I say can't hurt you. . . .
      Milly, Jett has a bad name among the buffalo outfits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not surprised. Tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've often heard hints made regarding the kind of outfits
      that keep to themselves. On the way south some freighter
      who had passed Jett ahead of us gave Pilchuck a hunch to
      steer clear of him. He gave no reason, and when I asked
      Pilchuck why we should steer clear of such an outfit he
      just laughed at me. Well, to-day Pilchuck found Jett
      skinning a buffalo that had been killed by a big-fifty
      bullet. Pilchuck knew it because he killed the buffalo and
      he remembered. Jett claimed he had shot the buffalo.
      Pilchuck told him that he was using a needle gun, and no
      needle bullet ever made a hole in a buffalo such as the big
      fifty. Jett didn't care what Pilchuck said and went on
      skinning. At that Pilchuck left, rather than fight for one
      hide. But he was mad clear through. He told Hudnall that
      hunters who had been in the Panhandle last summer gave Jett
      a bad name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For that sort of thing?" inquired Milly, as Tom paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so. Pilchuck made no definite charges. But it
      was easy to see he thinks Jett is no good. These plainsmen
      are slow to accuse any one of things they can't prove.
      Pilchuck ended up by saying to Hudnall: 'Some hunter will
      mistake Jett for a buffalo one of these days!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some one will shoot him!" exclaimed Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what Pilchuck meant," rejoined Tom, seriously. "It
      worries me, Milly dear. I don't care a hang what happens to
      Jett. But you're in his charge. If he <i>is</i> a bad man
      he might do you harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's danger of that, Tom, I've got to confess,"
      whispered Milly. "I'm afraid of Jett, but I was more so
      than I am now. He's so set on this hide-hunting that he
      never thinks of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some one will find out about you and me, or he'll catch
      us. Then what?" muttered Tom, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be terrible. We've got to keep any one from
      knowing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't you come to Hudnall's camp to live? I know he'd
      take you in. And his wife and daughter would be good to
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly pondered this idea with grave concern. It appealed
      powerfully to her, yet seemed unwise at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, I could come. I'd love to. But it surely would mean
      trouble. He could take me back, as I'm not of age. Then
      he'd beat me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'd kill him!" returned Tom, with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He might kill you," whispered Milly. "Then where would
      <i>I</i> be? I'd die of a broken heart. No, let's wait a
      while. As long as he's so set on this hunting I have little
      to fear. Besides, the women out here with these
      buffalo-hunters are going to be sent to the fort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where'd you hear that?" demanded Tom, in amaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly told him of the impulse that had resulted in her
      climbing the tree, and how the soldiers had halted beneath
      her, and the conversation that had taken place. She told it
      briefly, remembering especially the gist and substance of
      what the officer and scout had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! That's news. I wonder how Hudnall will take it. I
      mustn't give way where I heard it, eh, little girl. It'd be
      a fine thing, Milly. I hope the soldiers take all you women
      to the fort quick. I wouldn't get to see you, but I could
      endure that, knowing you were safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like it, too, and, Tom, if I am taken I'll stay there
      until I'm eighteen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your birthday is to be our wedding day," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it?" she whispered, shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you say so? Are you going back on it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His anxiety and reproach were sweet to her, yet she could
      not wholly surrender her new-found power or always give in
      to her tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I say so? Tom, would you quit murdering these poor
      buffalo for me, if I begged you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" he ejaculated, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you give up this hide-hunting business for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give it up? Why, of course I would!" he responded. "But
      you don't mean that you will ask it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom dear--I might."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, you child," he expostulated, "the buffalo are doomed.
      I may as well get rich as other men. I'm making big money.
      Milly, by winter time--next year surely, I can buy a ranch,
      build a house, stock a farm--for you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It sounds silly of me, Tom. But you don't understand me.
      Let's not talk of it any more now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. Only tell me you'll never go back on me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you only knew how I need you--and love you--you'd not
      ask that."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Milly, upon her stealthy approach to camp, observed that
      the men had finished their tasks and were congregated about
      the fire, eating and drinking. The hour must have been
      late. Milly sank noiselessly down in her tracks and
      crouched there, frightened, and for the moment unable to
      fight off a sense of disaster. She could do nothing but
      remain there until they went to bed. What if Jett should
      walk out there! He and his comrades, however, did not
      manifest any activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--not yet. We'll wait till that Huggins outfit has more
      hides," declared Jett, in a low voice of finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, boss," rejoined Follonsbee, "but my hunch is
      the sooner the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, to hell with buffalo hides," yawned Pruitt. "I'm aboot
      daid. Heah it's midnight an' you'll have us out at sunup.
      Jett, shore I'm sore, both body an' feelin'. If I knowed
      you was goin' to work us like this heah I'd never throwed
      in with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, man, the harder we work the more hides, an' the less
      danger--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk so loud," interrupted Follonsbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shore ain't me shoutin'," replied Pruitt, sullenly. "If
      I wanted to shout I'd do it. What's eatin' me is that I
      want to quit this outfit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett shook a brawny fist in Pruitt's face, that showed red
      in the camp-fire light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You swore you'd stick, an' you took money in advance, now
      didn't you?" demanded Jett in a fierce whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon I did. I'm square, an' don't you overlook that,"
      retorted Pruitt. "It's you who's not square. You
      misrepresented things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahuh! Maybe I was a little overkeen in talkin'," admitted
      Jett. "But not about what money there is in this deal. I
      know. You'll get yours. Don't let me hear you talk quit any
      more or I'll know you're yellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer Pruitt violently threw a chip or stick into the
      fire, to send the sparks flying, and then rising, with one
      resentful red flash of face at Jett, he turned and
      swaggered away towards his tent, without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bad business," said Follonsbee, shaking his head
      pessimistically. "You've no way with men, Rand. You'd get
      more out of them if you'd be easy an' patient, an' argue
      them into your opinions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon so, but I can't stand much more from that damned
      rebel," growled Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's harder to handle than Catlee," went on Jett. "He's
      beginnin' to see a hell of a risk in your way of
      hide-huntin'. Catlee ain't wise yet. He's as much a
      tenderfoot as Huggins or a lot more of these jay-hawkers
      who're crazy to get rich off the buffalo. I was afraid of
      these two fellars, an' I said so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had to have men. We'd lost a week waitin'," complained
      Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but it'd have been better to wait longer, till you
      got the right men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too late now. I'll make the best of it an' try to hold my
      temper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Let's turn in," replied Follonsbee, and rose to go
      toward the tents. Jett spread the fire and followed him.
      Soon the camp appeared dark and deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly crouched there under the big elm until she was sure
      Jett had crawled into his bed, and then swiftly and
      noiselessly she covered the ground to her own tent. In the
      interest of this colloquy among the men she had forgotten
      her fright. That, in her opinion, had been strange talk for
      honest hunters. Yet she could only surmise. While she was
      revolving in her mind the eventful disclosures of the day
      sleep overtook her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Days passed. They flew by, it seemed to Milly. The idle
      hours that fell to her lot were yet not many nor long
      enough for these ravenous hide-hunters. She watched in the
      daytime and listened at night, yet the certainty of what
      she feared did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her meetings with Tom Doan continued regularly as the third
      nights rolled round, without hitch or mishap; and in them
      Milly seemed to grow into the fullness of a woman's
      feeling. They talked of their love, of their marriage, and
      their plans for a home. There was little else to talk about
      except the buffalo, and the status of Jett and his men.
      Milly always suffered a pang when Tom, forgetting her love
      of all animals, raved about how many buffalo he had killed
      and skinned. Once she got blood on her hand from one of his
      boots, which she had inadvertently touched, and she was so
      sick and disgusted over it that she spoke sharply. Almost
      they quarreled. As for the truth concerning Jett, all
      Milly's observation and Tom's inquiry could not satisfy
      them as to what was the actual truth.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      More days went fleeting by, ushering in hot July, more
      hide-hunters along the river brakes, and, what seemed
      incredible, more buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're massin' up an' makin' ready for a hell of a
      stampede one of these days," declared Jett, in his booming
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night Milly was awakened by an unusual sound. Horses
      were snorting and stamping in camp. She peeped out. A wagon
      with two teams hitched to it stood just beyond the waning
      camp fire. Jett's burley form held the driver's seat;
      Follonsbee, rifle in hand, was in the act of climbing
      beside him; Pruitt stood on the ground, evidently intent on
      Jett's low, earnest voice. Milly could not distinguish what
      was being said. Jett drove away into the gloom of the
      woods. Where could he be going at this hour of the night?
      Milly could only conclude that he was driving out for
      another load of hides. Perhaps Jett had made trips before,
      unknown to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day disclosed the odd fact that Jett had not returned.
      Pruitt and Catlee evidently pursued the hunting as
      heretofore, and did not commit themselves to any words in
      Milly's presence. Sunset and supper time found Jett still
      absent. On the following morning, however, Milly learned
      that he had returned in the night and was asleep in his
      tent. She repaired to her own quarters and remained there
      till noon, when she saw him ride away. That afternoon Milly
      wandered around, as usual, with apparently no object in
      view, and eventually approached the glade where Jett kept
      his hides. She hated to go near it because of the
      unpleasant odor, the innumerable flies, and the sickening
      evidence of slaughtered buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glade had been cleared farther on the side toward the
      stream, and everywhere were buffalo hides, hundreds and
      hundreds of them, some pegged out to dry, others in piles
      shaded by cut branches. Milly, because of her former
      reluctance to visit this place, had no record in her mind
      of quantity of hides, so she could not tell whether or not
      there had been a sudden and suspicious addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after that Jett loaded two wagons with hides, and
      with Catlee driving one of them they set off for a
      freighting station. They were gone five days, during which
      Milly had the most peaceful time since she had left the
      settlements. Twice she was with Tom, and they made the best
      of their opportunity. Mrs. Jett during this period was
      almost amiable. Follonsbee and Pruitt worked about as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jett returned, his presence, or something connected
      with it, seemed to spur his men to renewed efforts. Early
      and late they were toiling at this game. Tom Doan had told
      her that the great drive of buffalo was on. Milly, however,
      had not needed this information. She could see and hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      No daylight hour was without its trampling thunder!
      Somewhere on one side of the river or other a part of the
      great herd was always in motion. Dust blew thick over the
      sky, sometimes obscuring the sun. And an unfavorable
      breeze, which fortunately occurred but seldom, brought a
      stench that Milly could not endure. By day the guns banged
      east, north, south, west, as if a battle were raging.
      Crippled buffalo limped by the camp, with red tongues
      hanging out, making for the brakes of the river, to hide
      and die. By night the howl of coyotes was sleep-preventing
      and the long-drawn deep, wild bay of wolves filled Milly
      with a haunting fear.
    </p>

      <a name="c08" id="c08">CHAPTER VIII</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      One day in July a band of soldiers rode into Hudnall's
      camp. The officer in charge got off his horse and appeared
      to be a lithe, erect man of forty, with a stern bronzed
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's the owner of this outfit?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudnall strode forward. "I am. Clark Hudnall's my name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to meet you," replied the officer. "I'm Captain
      Singleton of the Fourth Cavalry, stationed at Fort Elliott.
      This is my scout, Ellsworth. We've been detailed to escort
      buffalo-hunters to the fort or one of the freighting posts.
      The Indians are raiding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't want to go to the fort," protested Hudnall,
      obstinately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll stay here at your own risk," warned Singleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We never expected anything else," returned Hudnall,
      bluntly. "If you want to know, you're the first soldiers
      we've seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you women with you?" inquired the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. My wife an' daughter an' my son's wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you know any better than to fetch women out here in
      this Indian country?" went on Singleton, severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We heard bad rumors, sir, but didn't believe them, an' I
      may say we've had no trouble so far."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've been lucky. Did you know Huggins?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't say I do--by name," rejoined Hudnall, reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huggins had the outfit several miles below here. One
      helper at least with him, maybe more. Their camp was
      raided, burned--hides stolen. No trace of Huggins or his
      helper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indians?" queried Hudnall, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely. We've found no trace of Huggins or his man.
      They might have escaped to some other outfit or to a
      freighting post. But that's doubtful. West of here twenty
      miles or more a band of Comanches attacked some hunters,
      and were driven off. Unless you buffalo men camp together
      some of you are going to be killed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll fight," declared Hudnall, determinedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you must take your women to a place of safety,"
      insisted the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudnall called his wife and daughter. They came forward
      from their quarters, accompanied by Burn Hudnall's wife.
      Evidently they had heard something of the conversation;
      fear was manifest in their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ladies, pray do not be frightened," said the officer,
      courteously. "There's no need for that right now. We're
      here to escort you to a place where you will be safe while
      your men folks are hunting. It is <i>not</i> safe for you
      here. Any day Indians might ride down on you when you are
      alone in camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite Singleton's courtesy and assurance, the women were
      alarmed, and gathering round Hudnall they began to talk
      excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain, you an' your men make yourselves at home while we
      talk this over," said Hudnall. Pilchuck and Tom Doan, just
      in from skinning buffalo, stood near during this
      conversation. Tom welcomed sight of soldiers, and he
      intended to inform Captain Singleton of the two women in
      Jett's camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, Ellsworth," said Pilchuck to the soldier scout, "if
      this Huggins outfit was killed by Indians they'd not have
      disappeared. Comanches don't bother to bury or hide white
      men they've killed." Ellsworth leaned close to Pilchuck.
      "Reckon it doesn't look like redskin work to me, either."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck swore under his breath, and was evidently about to
      enter into earnest consultation with the soldier scout when
      Hudnall called him and Tom. They held a brief council. It
      was decided that Stronghurl and Pilchuck, with the addition
      of the outfit, Dunn and Tacks, would remain in camp, while
      Hudnall, Burn Hudnall, and Tom, accompanied by the women,
      would go with the soldiers. Hudnall did not consider it
      needful to send them all the way to Fort Elliott; the
      nearest freighting post, Sprague's, some three days'
      journey, would be safe and far enough. Hudnall intended to
      take advantage of this opportunity to freight out his
      buffalo hides, of which he had a large number.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon it may work out best, after all," he averred,
      brightening. "I'll run no risk losing the hides, an' then
      we'll soon be in need of supplies, 'specially cartridges."
    </p>
    <p>
      How dense he seemed to the imperative side of the
      issue--safety for the women! But he was not a frontiersman.
      He was brave, though foolhardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll pack an' leave early to-morrow," he informed
      Singleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll catch up with you, perhaps before you get to the
      military road," said the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that road, an' with Pilchuck stayin' here I
      might lose my way," returned Hudnall, in perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The military road runs from Fort Elliott to Fort Dodge.
      You'll strike it about eighteen miles northwest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon you can't miss it," added Pilchuck. "An' there's
      water aplenty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudnall invited Captain Singleton and his soldiers to have
      supper, which invitation was accepted, much to Tom Doan's
      satisfaction. He wanted to think over what was best to say
      to Captain Singleton about the Jett outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was indeed bustle and rush around the Hudnall camp
      that afternoon, part of which work was the preparation of a
      hearty supper. It was cooked and eaten long before sunset.
      Afterward Tom found occasion to approach the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain, may I have a--a word with you--about something
      very important?" he inquired frankly, despite a certain
      embarrassment he could not help.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, young man. What can I do for you?" he replied,
      with keen gray eyes on Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they withdrew a little, Tom lost his hesitation and
      briefly told who he was, what he was doing in Hudnall's
      outfit, and thus quickly reached the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain, please let what I tell you be confidential," he
      went on, earnestly. "It's about a girl with the Jett
      outfit. She's Jett's stepdaughter. They're camped below the
      bluff at the mouth of White Creek, several miles down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jett outfit," mused the officer. "I've heard that name. I
      know where his camp is--down in the woods. Hidden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Well, I--I'm in love with this girl, Milly
      Fayre--engaged to her. We expect to be married when she's
      eighteen. And I'm afraid for her--afraid of Jett more than
      the Indians. So is Milly. He'll not like this idea of
      sending his women to the fort or anywhere away from him.
      You see, he's got a wife, too, no relation to Milly--and he
      has them do the camp work. He's a hog for this
      hide-hunting. Then there are two hard nuts with him,
      Follonsbee and Pruitt. It's not an outfit like ours,
      Captain, or most any along the river. I can't honestly
      bring anything bad against Jett, unless it's that he's a
      brute and is after Milly. I know that. She won't admit it,
      but I can feel how she feels. She ought to be taken to the
      fort or wherever our women go--and please, Captain, don't
      fail to bring her. If you ask her you'll find out quick
      that she knows what's best for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose you ride down there with us," suggested Singleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to, but I'd better not," replied Tom. "Jett knows
      nothing of me yet. Milly thinks it best he doesn't know
      until she's free. He might harm her. And if he ever lays a
      hand on her I'll kill him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What'd you say your name is?" inquired the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom Doan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Tom, I'm for you and Milly. Here's my hand on
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you'll fetch her along?" queried Tom, trying to
      content himself, as he gripped the hand of this fine and
      soldierly man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she's still there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw her last night--we've been meeting secretly. She's
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you will see her to-morrow again, for we'll catch you
      on the road," replied the officer, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can never thank you enough," returned Tom, with
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed with a thankful heart that he saw Singleton
      and his soldiers, leading their pack-horses, ride off down
      the river. After that Tom worked as never before, and not
      only got all his work done, but considerable of the
      others'. The Hudnall outfit went to bed late and got up
      early. By the time the July sun was blazing over the
      prairie the three heavily laden wagons were moving toward
      the northwest. Tom had the biggest load of hides in his
      wagon. The women rode on the drivers' seats with Hudnall
      and his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The route lay along the swell of the slope as it gently
      dipped to the river, then up on the level prairie and
      northwest toward the far escarpment of the Staked Plain, a
      sharp gray landmark on the horizon. Tom followed fairly
      good wagon tracks until they all appeared to converge in
      one well-trodden road. Here for hours good time was made.
      Tom did not mind the heat or the flies or the dust. Over
      and over again he had counted the earnings Hudnall owed
      him, and the sum staggered him. Hundreds of dollars! But
      splendid as that was, it shrank into insignificance at the
      good fortune of having Milly safely away from Jett and the
      Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudnall made a noon stop at a shady crossing of a little
      stream. Here the horses were watered and fed and the
      travelers partook of a light meal. When the journey was
      resumed Tom could no longer resist the desire to look back
      along the road in the hope that he might see the soldiers
      coming. Really he did not expect them before camp that
      night, yet he was unable to keep from looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through this morning's travel they had skirted the
      ragged edge of the buffalo herd. Long, however, had they
      passed out of hearing of the guns of the hunters. Then
      early in the afternoon they ran into a large herd coming
      from the north. It was not a grazing herd, nor could it be
      called a stampeding herd; but the movement was steady and
      rapid. Hudnall drove way off the road to try to get round
      the leaders; this move, however, resulted in the three
      wagons being caught and hemmed in, with a stream of buffalo
      passing on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom believed it was a rather ticklish situation. The herd
      did not appear to be more than a mile wide, but the end
      toward the north was not in sight. The wagons were halted
      to wait until the herd had passed. The buffalo split round
      the wagons, probably fifty yards on each side, and they
      loped along lumberingly, not in any sense frightened. They
      raised dust enough to make the halt very uncomfortable, and
      noise enough to make it necessary to shout in order to be
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom's dissatisfaction had to do solely with the fact that
      Hudnall had gotten far enough off the road to miss the
      soldiers, if they came up presently. Hudnall, however, did
      not mind the halt, the discomfort, the loss of time, or the
      probable risk, should the buffalo become frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Tom's utter amaze, Hudnall presently took up his gun,
      and picking out bulls running somewhat away from the massed
      herd, he dropped four in as many shots. On that side the
      herd swerved away, the inside ranks pressing closer toward
      the middle, but they did not stampede. Then Burn Hudnall,
      not to be outdone by his father, dropped three buffalo on
      his side. The shooting served only to widen the oval that
      encompassed the wagons. Then the intrepid and indefatigable
      hunters proceeded to skin the slain beasts, regardless of
      the trampling mass passing so closely by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom, contrary to his usual disposition, did not offer to
      help; and when Hudnall yelled something unintelligible he
      waved his hand at the herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      It required two hours for this herd to pass the wagons, and
      another hour for the Hudnalls to complete skinning the
      seven they had shot. The women complained of the hot sun
      and the flies and the enforced wait. Tom spent a good deal
      of that last hour standing on top of the huge pile of hides
      in his wagon, scanning the horizon in the direction of the
      Red River camps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey, Tom, you might have helped along," said Hudnall, as
      he threw the wet hides up on his wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might have been run down, yourself," retorted Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, I think Tom's scared of the Indians the soldier
      talked about," remarked Sally Hudnall, a little
      maliciously. She had never quite forgiven Tom for being
      impervious to her charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom afraid? Nope, I can't savvy that," replied her father,
      in his hearty way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he's looking back all the time," said Sally, with
      conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tone, more than the content of her words, brought to
      Tom's mind a thought that when the soldiers did come along
      with Milly, there might result an embarrassing situation.
      What was he to say in explanation of his acquaintance with
      Milly? A moment's reflection convinced him that no
      explanation was necessary, nor need the Hudnalls know just
      yet of his engagement to her. Still, Milly had not been
      consulted; she would be overjoyed to see him and to meet
      the Hudnalls; and she was young, impulsive. How would she
      act? Tom told himself that he did not care the least what
      she said or did, but all the same an unusual situation for
      him seemed impending.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Hudnall led off toward the road, Tom allowed Burn to
      fall into second place, leaving him to take up the rear,
      and from this position he could look back to his
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon they were in the road again, and late in the afternoon
      turned into the military road Captain Singleton had
      indicated. Here the horses could travel, mostly at a trot.
      Tom had craned his neck sidewise so many times looking
      backward that he had put a crick in it, all to no avail.
      The soldiers did not put in an appearance. Tom began to
      worry. Suppose Jett had gotten wind of their coming and had
      moved camp! Might not the Comanches have raided Jett the
      same as Huggins! Tom had rather a bad hour along the
      military road.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sunset the Hudnall wagons began to draw near a richly
      green depression of the prairie, where a stream wound its
      way. And when Hudnall, now far in the lead, turned off the
      road, Tom was suddenly compelled to pay some attention to
      the foreground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horses were grazing in the grass; tents shone white against
      the background of green trees; a camp fire sparkled, and
      round it stood men. Soldiers! Tom's heart gave a leap.
      Captain Singleton had forged ahead, probably during the
      delay caused by the buffalo herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom urged his team to a trot and soon caught up with Burn
      Hudnall, who turned off the main road towards the camp. Tom
      followed closely, to be annoyed by the fact that Burn's
      wagon obstructed his view. Once or twice Tom caught a
      glimpse of the tents and the fire; yet, peer keenly as he
      could, he did not discern any women. His heart sank. If
      Milly was there she would be out watching the wagons drive
      up. Tom passed from joy to sadness. Yet hope would not
      wholly die. He kept looking, and all the time, up to the
      very halt, Burn's wagon prevented him from seeing
      everything. Therein lay his one hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey, Burn, don't you an' Tom drive smelly hides right in
      camp," yelled Hudnall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus admonished Tom wheeled his team away from the camp.
      Burn turned also, thus still obstructing Tom's vision. But
      there had to be an end to it some time. The next time Tom
      looked up, after he had halted the team, he was probably
      fifty yards from the camp fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw soldiers in dusty blue, Hudnall's stalwart form, all
      three of the Hudnall women, and then a girl in gray waving
      an excited hand at him. Tom stared. But the gray dress
      could not disguise the form it covered. Milly! He
      recognized her before he saw her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      With surging emotions Tom leaped off the wagon and strode
      forward. In the acute moment, not knowing what to expect,
      trying to stifle his extraordinary agitation, Tom dropped
      his head until he came to the half circle of people before
      him. Their faces seemed a blur, yet intent, curious on him.
      Milly stepped into clear sight toward him. She was pale.
      Her eyes shone large and dark as night. A wonderful smile
      transfigured her. Tom felt the need of an effort almost
      beyond him--to greet Milly without betraying their secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Milly was not going to keep any secrets. He felt that,
      saw it, and consternation routed his already weakened
      control.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Tom!" she cried, radiantly, and ran straight into his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only this was terrible, because she forgot everybody except
      him, and he could not forget them. She almost kissed him
      before he had wit enough to kiss her first. With that kiss
      his locked boyish emotions merged into one great gladness.
      Realizing Milly, he stepped beside her and, placing his arm
      round her, moved to face that broadly smiling, amazed
      circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Hudnall, this is my--my girl, Milly Fayre," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom Doan! For the land's sake!" ejaculated the kindly
      woman. "Your girl! . . . Well, Milly Fayre, I'm right happy
      to make your acquaintance."
    </p>
    <p>
      She warmly kissed Milly and then introduced her to Sally
      and Mrs. Burn Hudnall. That appeared to be sufficient
      introduction for all present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudnall was the most astonished of men, and certainly
      delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, Milly, I reckon Tom Doan's boss is sure glad to meet
      you," he said, and shook her hand with a quaint formality.
      "Would you mind tellin' me where this scallywag ever found
      such a pretty girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He found me--out here," replied Milly, shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" cried Sally Hudnall. "Now I know why Tom used to slip
      away from camp almost every night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' leave off peggin' buffalo hides till the gray
      mornin'," swiftly added Hudnall. "I always wondered about
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid the laughter and banter of these good people Tom stood
      his ground as long as possible; then, seeing that in their
      kindly way they had taken Milly to their hearts, he left
      her with them and hurried to unhitch the team he had
      driven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burn Hudnall followed him. "You buffalo-skinnin' son of a
      gun!" he exclaimed, in awe and admiration. "She's a hummer!
      By gosh! you're lucky! Did you see Sally's face? Say, Tom,
      she was half sweet on you. An' now we know why you've been
      so shy of women."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon returning to camp, Tom met Captain Singleton, who had
      a smile and a cordial handshake for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, lad, I fetched her, but it was no easy job," he
      said. "She's a sweet and pretty girl. You're to be
      congratulated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was Jett hard to manage?" queried Tom intensely
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, at first, I had trouble with him. Rough sort of man!
      Finally he agreed to let her come to the freighting post
      until the Indian scare quieted down. He wouldn't let his
      wife come and she didn't want to. She struck me as being
      almost as able to take care of herself as any man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" exclaimed Tom, blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lad, don't worry," replied the officer, understanding
      Tom's sudden check of enthusiasm and warmth. "This Indian
      scare will last. It'll grow from scare to panic. Not until
      the buffalo are gone will the Indians quit the warpath.
      Maybe not till they're dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second day following, about noon, the Hudnall
      outfit, with their escort, arrived at Sprague's Post, which
      was situated on a beautiful creek some miles below Fort
      Elliott. Here the soldiers left the party and went on their
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sprague was one of the mushroom frontier posts that had
      sprung up overnight. It consisted mainly of a huge
      one-story structure built of logs, that served as sutler's
      store, as well as protection against possible Indian
      attacks. The short street was lined with cabins, tents, and
      shacks; and adjacent to the store were acres and acres of
      buffalo hides piled high. There were a dance hall, several
      saloons, a hotel and restaurant, all in the full blast.
      Buffalo outfits, coming and going, freighters doing the
      same, in considerable number, accounted for the activity of
      this post. The sutler's store, which was owned by Sprague,
      was a general supply center for the whole northern section
      of Texas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudnall engaged quarters for the women folk, including
      Milly, that seemed luxurious after their camping
      experience. Sally Hudnall was to share her room, which had
      board floor and frame, roofed by canvas, with Milly; and
      the other Hudnall women had two rooms adjoining, one of
      which would serve as a kitchen. Hudnall had only to buy
      stove, utensils, supplies and fuel, to establish his wife
      and companions to their satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom could hardly have hoped for any more, and felt that he
      would be always indebted to the Hudnalls. Fortune had
      indeed favored him by throwing his lot in with theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudnall sold his hides to Sprague, getting three dollars
      each for the best robe cowhides, two dollars and a half for
      the bulls, and one dollar and seventy-five cents for the
      rest. His profits were large, as he frankly admitted, and
      he told Tom he thought it only fair to pay more for
      skinning. As for Tom, the roll of bills given to him for
      his earnings was such that it made him speechless. At the
      store he bought himself much-needed clothing and footgear,
      and a new rifle, with abundance of cartridges. Nor did he
      forget to leave some money with Mrs. Hudnall, for Milly's
      use, after he had gone. But he did not tell Milly of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom," said Hudnall, seriously, when they had turned the
      horses loose in the fine grama grass outside of town, "I
      never saw the beat of this place right here for a ranch.
      Did you? Look at that soil!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom certainly had not. It was rich prairie land, rolling
      away to the horizon, and crossed by several winding
      green-lined streams.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gee! I'd like to shove a plow into that," added Hudnall,
      picking up the turf. "Some day, Tom, all this will be in
      wheat or corn, or pasture for stock. Take my hunch, boy, we
      haven't seen its beat. We'll run up a cabin, at the end of
      this hunt, an' winter here. Then by another spring we can
      tell."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom found Sprague's Post the most interesting place that he
      had ever visited, and considerably much too wild, even in
      daytime. Dance hall and gambling hell, however, had only
      momentary attraction for him. Sprague's store was the
      magnet that drew him. Here he learned a great deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The buffalo south of the Brazos and Pease Rivers had at
      last turned north and would soon fall in with the great
      herd along the Red River. This meant that practically all
      the buffalo in the Southwest would concentrate between the
      Red River and the Staked Plain--an innumerable, tremendous
      mass. The Comanches were reported to be south of this herd,
      traveling toward the Red; and the Kiowas were up on the
      Staked Plain, chasing buffalo east; Cheyennes and
      Arapahoes, whose hunting ground had always been north of
      this latitude, were traveling south, owing to the fact that
      the annual migration of buffalo had failed this year.
      Failed because of the white hunters! An Indian war was
      inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom heard that Indian Territory was now being guarded by
      United States marshals; Kansas had passed laws forbidding
      the killing of buffalo; Colorado had done likewise. This
      summer would see all the buffalo hunters congregated in
      Texas. That meant the failure of the great herds to return
      north into Indian Territory, Kansas, and Colorado. The
      famous hunting grounds along the Platte and Republican
      Rivers would be barren. It seemed a melancholy thing, even
      to Tom, who had been so eager to earn his share of the
      profits. It was a serious matter for the state legislatures
      to pass laws such as this. No doubt Texas would do the
      same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom reasoned out this conclusion before he learned that at
      this very time the Texas Legislature was meeting to
      consider a bill to protect buffalo in their state. So far
      it had been held up by remarks credited to Gen. Phil
      Sheridan, who was then stationed at San Antonio, in command
      of the military department of the Southwest. Sprague gave
      Tom a newspaper to read, and spoke forcibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sheridan went to Austin an' shore set up thet meetin'.
      Told the Senators an' Representatives they were a lot of
      sentimental old women. They'd make a blunder to protect the
      buffalo! He said the hunters ought to have money sent them,
      instead of discouragement. They ought to have medals with a
      dead buffalo on one side an' a dead Injun on the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was strongly stirred by the remarks credited to General
      Sheridan, and he took the news-paper to the Hudnalls and
      read the passage:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "These buffalo-hunters have done more in the last year to
      settle the Indian trouble than the entire regular army has
      done in thirty years. They are destroying the Indians'
      commissary. Send them powder and lead! . . . Let them kill,
      skin, and sell until the buffalo are exterminated. Then the
      prairie can be covered with speckled cattle!"
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "Great!" boomed Hudnall, slapping his big hand down. "But
      darn it--tough on the Indians!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was confronted then with a strange thought; he, like
      Hudnall, felt pity for the Indians, yet none for the
      buffalo. There was something wrong in that. Later, when he
      told Milly about what he had heard, and especially
      Hudnall's expression of sympathy, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, it's because of the money. You men can't see right.
      Would you steal money from the Indians?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, certainly not!" declared Tom, with uplift of head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are stealing their food," she went on, seriously.
      "Their meat--out of their mouths. Not because you're
      hungry, but to get rich. Oh, Tom, it's wrong!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom felt troubled for the first time. He could not laugh
      this off and he did not have any argument prepared to
      defend his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom Doan," she added, very sweetly and gravely, "I'll have
      something to say to you--about killing buffalo--when you
      come to me on my eighteenth birthday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom could only kiss her for that speech, subtle, yet
      wonderful with its portent as to her surrender to him; but
      he knew then, and carried away with him next morning, the
      conviction that Milly would not marry him unless he
      promised to give up buffalo-hunting.
    </p>
    <p>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      As Tom drove his team after the Hudnalls, southward along
      the well-beaten military road, he carried also with him a
      thought of his parting from Milly--and something about her
      words or looks was like the one bitter drop in his sweet
      cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early as had been the hour, Milly with the Hudnall women
      had arisen to prepare breakfast and see their men folk off.
      Hudnall and Burn were having their troubles breaking away
      from wives, daughter, and sister, so they had no time to
      note the poignancy of Milly's farewell to Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the last she had come close to Tom, fastening her
      trembling hands to his hunting coat. She looked up into his
      eyes, suddenly wonderful, strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, you are all I have in the world," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, dear, I'm all yours," he had replied, tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not stay away long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll come back the very first chance," Tom had promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should not leave me--at all," she had whispered then,
      very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why Milly, you're safe here now," he expostulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll never be safe until--until Jett has no right over
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he will not come for you. Captain Singleton and
      Sprague say the Indian scare has just begun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom--I'll never be safe--until <i>you</i> take me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearest . . ." he had entreated, and then Hudnall boomed
      out, "Come on, break away, you young folks." And there had
      been only time for a last embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly's last look haunted Tom. How big, black, tragic her
      eyes! How beautiful, too--and their expression was owing to
      love of him. His heart swelled until it pained. Was it
      right to leave her? He could have found work at Sprague's.
      A remorse began to stir in him. If he had only not been so
      poor--if he had not been compelled to hunt buffalo! He
      realized that he was returning to the buffalo fields no
      longer free, bearing the weight of a great
      responsibility,--a lonely girl's happiness, perhaps her
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer morning was warm, colorful, fragrant with soft
      breeze off the prairie, full of melody of birds, and bright
      with the rising sun. But Tom did not respond as usual. The
      morning passed, and the hot afternoon was far spent before
      he could persuade and argue himself into something of his
      old mood. Common sense helped him. The chances of his
      returning to find Milly safe and well were very much
      greater than otherwise; yet he could not forget the last
      few moments they had been together, when under stress of
      fear and sorrow she had betrayed Jett's real status and her
      own fatalism. All that day Milly was in his thoughts, and
      afterward, when he lay in his bed, with the dark-blue,
      star-studded sky open to his sleepless gaze.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It took Hudnall only two days and a half, hauling light
      wagons, to return to the Red River camp. Conditions were
      identically the same as before the trip. Pilchuck and his
      three helpers had killed and skinned three hundred and
      twenty five buffalo during Hudnall's absence. The chief of
      the outfit was delighted; and late in the afternoon as it
      was, he wanted to go right at the slaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take it easy," growled Pilchuck. "We want some fresh grub
      an' some news."
    </p>
    <p>
      Manifestly, Pilchuck and his associates had not fared well
      since the departure of the women folk. "Dam the pesky
      redskins, anyhow," he complained to Hudnall. "Who's goin'
      to cook?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll take our turn," replied Hudnall, cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lot of fine cooks we got in this outfit," he growled.
      "Wal, there's one consolation, anyway--reckon we won't have
      to eat much longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' why not?" demanded Hudnall, in surprise. "I fetched
      back a wagon load of grub."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, we're goin' to be scalped by Comanches directly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bosh!" boomed Hudnall, half in anger. "You plainsmen make
      me sick. You're worse than the soldiers. All this rant
      about Indian raids! We've been out over two months an'
      haven't seen a single Indian, tame or wild."
    </p>
    <p>
      The scout gazed steadfastly at Hudnall, and the narrow
      slits of his eyes emitted a gray-blue flash, cold as light
      on steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's men like you who can't savvy the West, an' won't
      listen, that get scalped by Indians," he said, with a ring
      in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudnall fumed a moment, but his good nature prevailed and
      he soon laughed away the effect of Pilchuck's hard speech.
      Dread he seemed to lack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Tom followed the others of the Hudnall outfit
      out to the chase, which they returned to with redoubled
      energy and a fiercer determination. Concrete rewards in
      shape of gold and greenbacks paid to them by Hudnall were
      the spurs to renewed effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom started that day badly. Just as he came within range of
      the first buffalo and aimed at it he thought of Milly's
      reproachful dark eyes and he wavered so that he crippled
      the beast. It escaped into the herd. Tom was furious with
      himself for wounding a buffalo that could only limp away to
      die a lingering death. After that he put squeamishness out
      of his mind and settled down into the deadly and dangerous
      business of hide-hunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was one of ceaseless and strenuous labors,
      extending long after dark. Bed was a priceless boon; memory
      had little opportunity; sleep was something swift and
      irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus was ushered in the second phase of Tom Doan's
      buffalo-hunting.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The vast herd of buffalo, reported by Pilchuck to be
      several miles wide and more miles in length than any
      conservative scout would risk estimating, never got farther
      north than the vicinity of the Red River.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually it was driven west along the river to the North
      Fork, which it crossed, and then, harassed by the hunters
      behind and flanked on the west by the barren rise of the
      Staked Plain, it turned south, grazing and traveling
      steadily, to make the wide and beautiful Pease River divide
      in ten days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here began a fearful carnage. Hudnall's outfit fell in with
      the thick of the buffalo-hunters, many of whom had been a
      year at the game. They were established in name and
      manifestly proud of that fact. "Raffert's, Bill Stark's,
      Nebraska Pete's, Black and Starwell, Bickerdyke's, Uncle
      Joe Horde, Old Man Spaun, Jack and Jim Blaise," and many
      other names became household words in the Hudnall camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom kept eyes and ears open for news of the Jett outfit,
      but so far had not been successful in learning its
      whereabouts. There were hundreds of gangs strung along the
      rivers for many miles, and by far not all of the buffalo
      were in the great massed herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a tributary of the Pease it was decided by Pilchuck and
      Hudnall to make permanent camp until fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want four thousand hides by November," boomed Hudnall,
      rubbing his huge hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Easy. I'll show you how to kill a hundred to-morrow in
      three hours," replied Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we'll freight back to Sprague's?" queried Tom,
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus each man voiced the thing most in his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day Pilchuck outdid his boast in the estimated time,
      killing one hundred and eighteen buffalo--a remarkable
      feat. But he had a fast, perfectly trained horse; he was
      daring and skillful; he rode his quarry down and made one
      shot do the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day by day Tom Doan killed fewer buffalo. He did not notice
      the fact until it was called to his attention. Then, going
      over his little book of record, which he kept faithfully,
      he was amazed and chagrined to discover that such was the
      case. He endeavored to right the falling off, only to grow
      worse. He wavered, he flinched, he shot poorly, thus
      crippling many buffalo. It made him sick. The cause was
      Milly. She dominated his thoughts. The truth was that Milly
      had awakened him to the cruelty and greed of this business
      and his conscience prevented him from being a good hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudnall solved the knotty problem for Tom, very much to his
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, you've lost your nerve, as Pilchuck says," said the
      chief. "But you're the best skinner he ever saw. You're
      wastin' time chasin' an' shootin' buffalo. We're killin'
      about as many as we can skin, an' we could kill more.
      Pilchuck can, anyhow. Now you follow us an' skin buffalo
      only. We'll pay you thirty five cents a hide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bet I take you up," declared Tom, gladly. "I didn't
      know I'd lost my nerve, but I hate the killing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, it's begun to wear on me, to be honest," sighed
      Hudnall. "I'd rather push a plow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Next moment he was asking Tom to make accurate estimate of
      the stock of ammunition on hand. Tom did his best at this
      calculation and reported: three hundred forty six pounds of
      St. Louis shot-toner lead in twenty-five pound bars; about
      five thousand primers; five cans of Dupont powder,
      twenty-five pounds to a can; and three cans of six pounds
      each.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jude, how long will that last us?" inquired Hudnall of
      Pilchuck, who had heard Tom's report.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, let's see. I reckon August, September,
      October--unless we have to fight Indians," replied the
      scout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho! Ho! There you go again," derided Hudnall. "This Injun
      talk is a joke."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this skinning job Tom soon found himself in better
      spirits, and worked so effectively that he won golden
      praise from his employers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shucks! What a scalper of redskins that boy would make!"
      declared Pilchuck. "He can keep a knife sharp as a razor
      an' cut with it like a nigger."
    </p>
    <p>
      If Tom had been able to get some leisure he would have
      found much enjoyment in the permanent camp. It was situated
      on a beautifully wooded bench above the wild brakes of a
      tributary to the larger river near by, and game abounded
      there. Down in the brakes were bear, panther, wildcats in
      numbers too plentiful for wandering around without a gun.
      The wide belts of timber appeared to be full of wild turkey
      and deer. Antelope, tame as cattle, grazed on the prairie;
      and in the wake of the buffalo slunk hordes of howling
      coyotes. Bands of big gray wolves, bold and savage, took
      their toll of the buffalo calves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The diet of buffalo steak was varied by venison and
      antelope meat, and once with wild turkey. This last trial
      of a changed menu resulted disastrously for Tom. It
      happened to be his turn as cook and he had killed several
      wild turkeys that day. Their flesh was exceedingly bitter,
      owing to a berry they lived on, which was abundant in the
      brakes. Pilchuck, who suffered with indigestion, made
      sarcastic remarks about Tom's cooking, and the other men
      were vociferous in their disapproval. Unfortunately Tom had
      not cooked any other meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, you're a valuable member, but your cookin' is worse
      than your shootin'," remarked Hudnall, finally. "We'll
      relieve you of your turn an' you can put that much time to
      somethin' else. . . . No offense, my lad. You just can't
      cook. An' we can't starve to death out here. Reckon when
      you come to ranchin' you'll be lucky to have that pretty
      black-eyed Milly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucky!" exploded Burn Hudnall, who it was hinted suffered
      a little from being henpecked. "Say, he <i>is</i> an' he
      doesn't savvy it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, we're all pretty lucky, if you let me get in a word,"
      said the scout, dryly. "Here we've been days in hostile
      country, yet haven't been molested."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you go again!" protested Hudnall, who had become
      wearied of Indian talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, am I scout for this outfit or just plain plugger of
      buffs?" queried Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're scout, an' pardner, an' everything of course,"
      replied Hudnall. "Your scoutin' for buffalo couldn't be
      beat, but your scoutin' for redskins, if you do any, hasn't
      worried me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, Hudnall, I don't tell you everythin'," rejoined
      Pilchuck. "Yesterday, ten miles below on the river, I met a
      bunch of Kiowas, braves, squaws, kids, with ponies packed
      an' travois draggin'. They didn't look sociable. To-day I
      saw a band of Comanches tearin' across the prairie or I'm a
      born liar! I know how Comanches ride."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jude, are you tryin' to scare me into huntin' closer to
      camp?" asked Hudnall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not tryin' or arguin'," responded the scout. "I'm just
      tellin' you. My advice to all of you is to confine your
      huntin' to a radius of five or six miles. Then there'd
      always be hunters in sight of each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jude, you an' Burn an' I killed one hundred ninety-eight
      buffalo yesterday on ground no bigger than a fifty-acre
      farm. But it was far off from camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. Most hunters like to kill near camp, naturally,
      for it saves work, but not when they can kill twice as many
      in the same time farther out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll kill mine an' skin them an' haul them in," replied
      the leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, wal," said Pilchuck, resignedly, "reckon advice is
      wasted on you."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Tom, in his new job, worked out an innovation much to
      Hudnall's liking. He followed the hunters with team and
      wagon, and through this hit by accident upon a method of
      skinning that greatly facilitated the work. Taking a forked
      stick, Tom fastened it to the middle of the hind axletree,
      allowing the other sharpened end to drag. Tying a rope to
      the same axle and the other end to the front leg of a dead
      buffalo, Tom would skin the upper side down. Next he would
      lead the horses forward a little, moving the beast. The
      stick served the purpose of holding the wagon from slipping
      back. Then he would skin down the center of the sides, and
      stop to have the team pull the carcass over. Thus by
      utilizing horse power he learned to remove a hide in half
      the time it had taken him formerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often the hunters would kill a number far exceeding Tom's
      ability to haul to camp. But with their help all the hides
      were removed generally the same day the buffalo were slain.
      If Tom could not haul all back to camp, he spread them fur
      side up, to collect the next day. Tom particularly disliked
      to skin a buffalo that had been killed the day before;
      because the bloating that inevitably occurred always made
      the hide come off with exceeding difficulty. Like all
      expert skinners, Tom took pride in skinning without cutting
      holes in a hide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom often likened the open ground back of camp on the
      prairie side to a colossal checkerboard, owing to the many
      hides always pegged out in regular squares. Five days from
      the pegging process these hides would be turned fur side up
      for a day, and turned again every day until dry. They had
      to be poisoned to keep the hide bugs from ruining them. As
      the hides dried they were laid one over the other, making
      as huge piles as could be handled. To tie these bundles
      strips of wet buffalo hide were run through the peg-holes
      of the bottom and top hides, and pulled very tight. All
      bull hides were made into one bundle, so marked; and the
      others sorted according to sex, age, and quality. Taken as
      a whole, this hunting of buffalo for their hides, according
      to the opinion of all hunters, was the hardest work in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      One morning a couple of drivers, belonging to Black and
      Starwell's outfit, halted their teams at Hudnall's camp,
      and spread a rumor that greatly interested the leader. They
      were freighting out thirteen hundred hides to Sprague's.
      The rumor had come a few days before, from hunters
      traveling south, to the effect that Rath and Wright of
      Dodge City was going to send freighters out to buy hides
      right at the camps. This would afford the hunters immense
      advantage and profit. The firm was going to pay regular
      prices and do the hauling.
    </p>
    <p>
      These loquacious drivers had more news calculated to
      interest Hudnall. It was a report that the Kansas City
      firm, Loganstein &amp; Co., one of the largest buyers of
      hides in the market, were sending their hides to Europe,
      mostly to England, where it had been discovered that army
      accouterments made of leather were much better and cheaper
      when made of buffalo hide. This would result in a rise in
      prices, soon expected, on the buffalo hides.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this excited Hudnall. He paced the camp-fire space in
      thought. Ordinarily he arrived at decisions without
      vacillation, but this one evidently had him bothered.
      Presently it came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll stay in camp an' work," he said, as if answering a
      query. "Tom, you an' Stronghurl shall haul all the hides we
      have to Sprague's. You can see our women folks an' bring
      back the straight of this news. Let's rustle, so you can go
      with Starwell's freighters."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The journey to Sprague's Post was an endless drive of eight
      long, hot glaring days; yet because each day, each hour,
      each minute, each dragging step of weary horses bore Tom
      closer to Milly, he endured them joyfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making twenty-five miles the last day, Tom and his
      companions from the Pease River reached Sprague's late at
      night, and camped in the outskirts of the settlements,
      where showed tents and wagons of new outfits. Early next
      morning Tom and Stronghurl were besieged by prospective
      buffalo-hunters, intensely eager to hear news from the
      buffalo fields. Invariably the first query was, were the
      buffalo really herded by the millions along the Red, Pease,
      and Brazos Rivers? Secondly, were the Indians on the
      warpath? Tom answered these questions put to him in the
      affirmative; and did his best with the volley of other
      interrogations, many of them by tenderfoot hunters. He
      remembered when he had been just as ignorant and raw as
      they were now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, what with bringing in the horses, breakfast, and
      satisfying these ambitious newcomers, Tom was held back
      from rushing to see Milly. Stronghurl said he would see the
      Hudnalls later. At last, however, Tom got away, and he had
      only to hurry down the almost deserted street of the post
      to realize that the hour was still early. He was not
      conscious of anything save a wonderfully warm and blissful
      sense of Milly's nearness--that in a moment or so he would
      see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom's hand trembled as he knocked on the canvas door of the
      Hudnall quarters. He heard voices. The door opened, to
      disclose Mrs. Hudnall, wary-faced and expectant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the land's sake!" she cried, her expression changing
      like magic. "Girls, it's Tom back from the huntin' fields."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bet, and sure glad," replied Tom, and could hardly
      refrain from kissing Mrs. Hudnall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come right in," she said, overjoyed, dragging him into the
      kitchen. "Never mind Sally's looks. She just got up. . . .
      Tom, I know from your face all's well with my husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure. He's fine--working hard and making money hand over
      fist. Sent you this letter. Stronghurl came, too. He'll see
      you later."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally Hudnall and Mrs. Burn Hudnall welcomed Tom in no less
      joyful manner; and the letters he delivered were received
      with acclamations of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom looked with eager gaze at the door through which Sally
      had come, expecting to see Milly. But she did not appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Milly?" he asked, not anxiously, but just in happy
      eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His query shocked the Hudnall women into what seemed sudden
      recollection of something untoward. It stopped Tom's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milly! Why, Tom--she's gone!" said Mrs, Hudnall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone!" he echoed, dazedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yesterday. Surely you met her on the road south?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Road south? . . . No, no," cried Tom, in distress. "Jett!
      Did he take her away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. He came night before last, but we didn't know until
      mornin'," continued Miss Hudnall, hurriedly. "Had his wife
      an' two men with him. Jett sold thirty-four hundred buffalo
      hides an' had been drinkin'. . . . He--well, he frightened
      <i>me,</i> an' poor Milly. I was never so sorry for any one
      in my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I was afraid he'd come!" burst out Tom, in torture.
      "Milly said I shouldn't leave her. . . . Oh, why, why
      didn't I listen to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange you didn't meet Jett," replied Mrs. Hudnall. "He
      left with three wagons yesterday afternoon. They went
      straight down the military road. We watched them. Milly
      waved her scarf for a long time. . . . She looked so cute
      an' sweet in her boy's clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boy's clothes?" ejaculated Tom, miserably. "What do you
      mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jett came here in the mornin'," went on Mrs. Hudnall. "He
      was soberin' up an' sure looked mean. He asked for Milly
      an' told her that she was to get ready to leave with him in
      the afternoon. His wife wasn't with him, but we met her
      later in Sprague's store. She struck us as a fit pardner
      for Jett. Well, Milly was heart-broken at first, an'
      scared. We could see that. She didn't want to go, but said
      she'd have to. He could take her by force. She didn't say
      much. First she wrote you a letter, which I have for you,
      an' then she packed her clothes. When Jett came about three
      o'clock he fetched boy's pants, shirt, coat, an' hat for
      Milly. Said on account of Indians scarin' the soldiers the
      military department were orderin' women out of the buffalo
      fields. Jett was disguisin' his women in men's clothes.
      Milly had to have her beautiful hair cut. Sally cut it.
      Well, Milly dressed in that boy's suit an' went with Jett.
      She was brave. We all knew she might come to harm, outside
      of Indians. An' we felt worse when Sprague told us last
      night that this Mrs. Jett had been the wife of an outlaw
      named Hardin, killed last summer at Fort Dodge. That's
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens! it's enough!" declared Tom, harshly, divided
      by fear for Milly and fury at himself. "What can I do? . .
      . I might catch up with Jett. But then what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I'd do--hurry after her," advised Mrs.
      Hudnall. "Somehow you might get her away from Jett. Tell my
      husband. He'll do somethin'. . . . Tom, here's Milly's
      letter. I hope it tells you how she loves you. For you're
      all the world to that child. She was cryin' when she gave
      it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Tom, huskily, taking the letter and
      starting to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come back before you leave," added Mrs. Hudnall. "We'll
      want to send letters an' things with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' say, Tom," called Sally from the doorway, "you tell
      Dave Stronghurl if he doesn't run here to me pronto it 'll
      be all day with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll send him," returned Tom, and hurried back to camp,
      where he delivered Sally's message to Dave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, I've all the time there is," drawled Dave, with an
      assured smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! We'll be leaving just as quick as I can sell these
      hides for Hudnall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, I'll be goshed! What's the rush, Tom! . . . Say, you
      look sick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sick. I'm afraid I'm ruined," replied Tom, hurriedly,
      and told Dave his trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      His comrade swore roundly, and paced a moment,
      thoughtfully. "Tom, mebbe it ain't so bad as it looks. But
      it's bad enough. I'd hate to see that girl fall into the
      hands of the Indians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indians? Dave, it's Jett I'm afraid of. He's bad and he
      means bad. . . . I--I think I'll have to kill him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, quite right an' proper, if he's what you say. An'
      I'll back you. Let's see. We'd better rustle. You tend to
      sellin' the hides an' what else Hudnall wanted. An' I'll
      tend to Sally."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that Stronghurl paid some elaborate though brief
      attention to his personal appearance, then strode off
      toward the post. Left alone, Tom hurriedly tore open
      Milly's letter. It was written in ink on good paper, and
      the handwriting was neat and clear. Tom thrilled at his
      first sight of Milly's writing.

      Sprague's Post     <br>
      <i>July 19.     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR TOM:
    </p>
    <p>
      It is my prayer you get this letter soon--surely some day.
      Jett has come for me. I must go. There isn't anything else
      I can do. But if you or Mr. Hudnall were here I'd refuse to
      go and let Jett do his worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      He'll surely take me back to the buffalo camps, and where
      they are you will be somewhere. I know you will find me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm scared now and my heart's broken. But I'll get over
      that and do my best to fool Jett--to get away from him--to
      save myself. I've bought a little gun which I can hide, and
      if I have to use it to keep him from harming me--<i>I will
      do it.</i> I love you. You're all I have in this world. God
      surely will protect me.
    </p>
    <p>
      So don't feel too badly and don't lose hope. Don't ever
      give up looking for me. Whenever you pass a camp you
      haven't seen before, look for a red scarf tied somewhere in
      sight. It'll be mine.
    </p>
    <p align="right">
      MILLY.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Tom sat there with clenched hands and surging heart. The
      letter at once uplifted him and plunged him into the
      depths. He writhed with remorse that he had ever left her
      alone. The succeeding moments were the most bitter of his
      life. Then another perusal of Milly's letter roused his
      courage. He must be true to the brave spirit that called to
      him; and he must hope for the best and never give up
      seeking her, though he realized how forlorn it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom sold Hudnall's hides at a higher figure than Hudnall
      had received for his first batch. Sprague not only
      corroborated the rumors that had been the cause of Hudnall
      sending Tom out, but also added something from his own
      judgment. The peak of prices for hides had not been
      reached. He offered so much himself that Tom wondered
      whether or not Hudnall would sell at all to the buyers from
      Dodge City. Tom gathered that there was now great rivalry
      among the several firms buying hides, a circumstance of
      profit to the hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll give you another hunch," said Sprague. "After the
      hides, the bones of the carcasses will fetch big money. I
      just heard thet a twenty-mile pile of buffalo bones along
      the Santa Fe railroad sold for ten dollars a ton. For
      fertilizer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say!" exclaimed Tom, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What'll Hudnall think of that? But, Sprague, it isn't
      possible to haul bones from the Red River country in
      quantity enough to pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon that seems far fetched, I'll admit. But you can
      never tell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now about the Indian scare," went on Tom, anxiously.
      "What's your honest opinion? Is it serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doan, listen," replied Sprague, impressively. "Believe
      what the scouts an' plainsmen say. They know. The whole
      half of Texas is bein' run over by a lot of
      farmers--hide-hunters for the time bein'. They don't know
      the West. An' some of them will be killed. That's the least
      we can expect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then--these hide thieves. What do you know about them?"
      inquired Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much. Thet's not my business. I'm buyin' hides from
      anybody an' everybody. I can't afford to be suspicious of
      hunters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you know the little girl, Milly Fayre, who was staying
      with Mrs. Hudnall?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore did, an' I took to her pronto. Mrs. Hudnall told me
      aboot Jett bein' her stepfather, an' was packin' her off
      with him, togged out as a boy. I sold Jett the boy's
      clothes, but didn't know then what he wanted them for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's engaged to marry me. She hates Jett and is afraid of
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So thet's the story!" ejaculated the sharp-featured
      Westerner, with quick gesture of comprehension. "Doan, I
      ain't sayin' much, but this deal looks bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looks terrible to me. Is Jett just a--a rough
      customer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doan, what he may be doesn't matter, I reckon," returned
      Sprague, in a low voice. "But take this hunch from me.
      Follow Jett an' get your girl out of his clutches--if you
      have to kill him. Savvy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had seen the same dancing light gleam, sharp as fiery
      sparks, in the eyes of Pilchuck, that now shot from
      Sprague's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--I savvy," replied Tom, swallowing hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later he was driving his team at a brisk trot south
      on the military road, and Stronghurl was hard put to it to
      keep up with him.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c10" id="c10">CHAPTER X</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Rising early and driving late, Tom Doan, with Stronghurl
      keeping in sight, traveled southward over the prairie
      toward the buffalo fields. He made it a point always to
      reach at night the camp of outfits that had been ahead of
      him. Thus every day was a dragging one of anxious hope to
      catch up with Jett, and every sunset was a time fraught
      with keen, throbbing excitement. Always, however, his
      search among the outfits ended in bitter disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A remarkable thing about this journey was that every outfit
      he passed on the way put on more speed and tried to keep
      him and Stronghurl in sight. Tom considered it just as well
      that they did so, for they were fast penetrating into the
      Indian country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on the ninth morning of that long journey Tom and
      Stronghurl forded the Pease River, at a dangerous crossing,
      and entered the zone of slaughter. No live buffalo were in
      sight, but the carcasses left by the advancing hunters
      polluted the summer air and made of the prairie a hideous
      shambles. They passed thousands and thousands of bone piles
      and rotten carcasses; and as they advanced the bone piles
      became fewer and the solid carcasses more. Coyotes in
      droves, like wild dogs, fought along the road, regardless
      of the wagons. Indeed, many of them were so gorged that
      they could not run. And as for buzzards, they were as thick
      as crows in a Kansas cornfield in October, likewise gorged
      to repletion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wake of the hide-hunters was something to sicken the
      heart of the stoutest man and bring him face to face with
      an awful sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom verified another thing that had long troubled him and
      of which he had heard hunters speak. For every single
      buffalo that was killed and skinned there was one which had
      been crippled and had escaped to die, so that if ever found
      its hide would be useless. In every ravine or coulee or
      wash off the main line of travel Tom knew, by investigation
      of those near where he and Stronghurl camped or halted at
      noon, there lay dead and unskinned buffalo. If he saw a
      hundred, how many thousands must there be? It was a
      staggering arraignment to confront the hide-hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward noon of that day herds of live buffalo came in
      sight, and thereafter grew and widened and showed movement.
      Tom eventually overhauled a single wagon drawn by four
      horses, and drew up beside it, asking the usual query.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whoa, thar!" called the stout old driver to his team.
      "Jett? No, I ain't heard that name, Hev you, Sam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion likewise could not remember such a name as
      Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've met up with lots of outfits an' never heerd nary
      name a-tall," added the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tom asked if they had seen an outfit of three large
      wagons, three men, a woman, and a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Big outfit--wal, I reckon. Was the boss a yaller-bearded
      man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's Jett," replied Tom, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Passed us this mawnin' back a ways. I recollect sure,
      'cause the boy looked at us an' waved a red kerchief. He
      had big black eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milly!" breathed Tom, to himself. "Thank you, men. That's
      the outfit I'm after."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove on, urging the tired horses, and he was deaf to
      the queries his informants called after him upon their own
      account. Hope and resolve augmented in Tom as he traveled
      onward. Jett was hurrying back to the main camps, and he
      would not be hard to locate, if Tom did not catch up with
      him on the road. Milly's letter lay in the breast pocket of
      Tom's flannel shirt, and every now and then he would press
      his hand there, as if to answer Milly's appeal. He drove so
      persistently and rapidly that he drew far ahead of
      Stronghurl and the string of outfits which followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles farther, with straggling herds on each side, and then
      the boom-boom-boom of heavy guns! From the last ridge above
      the river he saw a pall of dust away to the west. Here
      there was action. But it must have been miles away. The
      river meandered across the prairie, a wide strip of dark
      green cottonwood and elm. In an hour Tom reached it. Not
      yet had he come in sight of a three-wagon outfit. With keen
      eyes he searched the dusty road to make sure that no wheel
      tracks swerved off without his notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after this time he drew near the zones of camps,
      and presently passed the first one, new since he had come
      by that way about two weeks before. It was now August.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom's misery had diminished to a great extent, and he could
      contain himself with the assurance that Milly would be
      somewhere along this tributary of the Pease River.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boom-boom-boom boomed the big fifties, not louder than at
      first, yet more numerous and on both sides of the river.
      Tom rolled by camp after camp, some familiar to him, most
      of them new. But no red scarf adorned any tent or wagon to
      gladden his eye. Miles he drove along the river, passing
      many more camps, with like result. The hunters were
      returning from the chase; a gradual cessation in gun-fire
      marked Tom's approach to Hudnall's outfit. It was now
      impossible to see all the camps; some were too far from the
      road; others down in the widening brakes of the river.
      There were wagon tracks that turned off the main road to
      cross the river. Tom found no sign of Jett's outfit; yet,
      though much disappointed, it did not discourage him. Jett
      would be among the hunters after this main herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before sunset he drove into Hudnall's camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it ain't Tom!" yelled Burn, who was the first to see
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hudnall was the first to get to Tom, and almost
      embraced him, so glad and amazed was he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back so soon? Gosh! you must have come hummin'!" he rolled
      out, heartily. "Say, we've had great huntin'. Hard, but
      just like diggin' gold. What'd you get for my hides?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fifty cents more on every hide," replied Tom, producing an
      enormous wad of bills. "Maybe I'm not glad to get rid of
      that! And here're letters. There are newspapers, magazines,
      and other stuff in a basket under the seat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's my women folks?" asked Hudnall, fingering the
      greenbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just fine. You couldn't hope for better. But my--but Milly
      was gone," answered Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milly? Who's she? Aw yes, your girl. I'd forgotten. . . .
      Say, Doan, you're thin, you look used up. Trip wear you
      out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudnall was all kindliness and solicitude now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Worry. I'll tell you presently. . . . Dave is
      somewhere along behind, heading a whole caravan of new
      hide-hunters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The more the merrier. There's room an' we don't see any
      slackin' up of buffalo," said Hudnall. "Pilchuck got two
      hundred an' eighty-six day before yesterday. That's his top
      notch. But he says he'll beat it. Tom, I forgot to tell you
      we'll pay you for drivin' out the hides. Five dollars a
      day, if that's all right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much obliged," replied Tom, wearily, as he sank down to
      rest. "Guess I'm fagged, too. You see, I tried to catch up
      with Jett. He left Sprague's a day ahead of me with Milly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hell you say!" ejaculated Hudnall, suddenly losing all
      his animation. "We've heard bad rumors about that Jett
      outfit. You must take Milly away from them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't get track of Jett until to-day," went on Tom. "He
      was just ahead of me, though I couldn't see his wagons. He
      hit the river along about midafternoon and he's somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, we'll find him, an' don't you worry. These camps are
      no place for women folks. I've come to seein' that, Tom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's happened since I left?" queried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Son, if I believed all I heard I'd be pullin' stakes for
      Sprague's," declared Hudnall. "Reckon some of it's true,
      though. All I seen for myself was some Kiowas that got
      killed at the forks of the river above. They raided a camp,
      an' was crossin' the river when some hunters on the other
      side piled them up, horses an' all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe I expected to hear worse," replied Tom, soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wash up an' take a rest," advised Hudnall. "I'll look
      after the horses. Reckon we'd better hold off supper a
      little. Pilchuck's always late these days. He likes the
      evenin' hunt an' I don't see any sign of Stronghurl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dave was in sight when I struck the river," said Tom.
      "Then I slowed up. So he can't be far behind, unless he
      broke down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, after a bath and shave and the donning of clean
      clothes, Tom felt somewhat relieved in body. His mind,
      however, was busy, pondering, clouded; and so it must
      continue until he had found Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck rode in after sunset, a dust-covered,
      powder-begrimed figure, ragged, worn, proven, everything
      about him attesting to the excessive endeavor that made him
      a great hunter. His jaded horse was scarcely recognizable;
      froth and sweat and dust had accumulated in a caked lather,
      yellow and hard as sun-baked mud, over front and hind
      quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Howdy, Doan!" was his greeting to Tom, with the offer of a
      horny, grimy hand. "As a freighter you're A number one.
      Reckon you look sorta washed out--an' washed up, too. Shore
      you're spick an' span. I'll go fall in the crick, myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you have a good day?" asked Tom, after returning his
      greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh! Not much. I dropped fourteen bulls early, then got
      jammed in a herd an' had to quit shootin'. Wasn't no
      stampede or mebbe my story would never have been told. But
      the pesky bunch took me more'n twenty miles along
      Soapberry, an' when I did get clear of them I run plumb
      into some mean-lookin' Kiowas. They was between me an'
      camp. I had to head off west a little. They rode along for
      a couple of miles, keepin' on the wrong side for me, an'
      then seein' I was sure alone, they took after me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The scout abruptly ended his narrative there, and went
      about his tasks. Tom, strange to realize, took the incident
      with a degree of calmness that seemed to him to be an
      acceptance of times grown heroic and perilous.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later Dave Stronghurl drove into camp with weary
      team, and tired himself, yet unusually loquacious and
      robustly merry for him. Tom could tell that Dave had
      something on his mind, and awaited results with interest.
      Hudnall greeted Dave in the same cordial way as he had Tom,
      asked the same questions, made the same statements about
      the hide-hunting and news of camp. And he also took charge
      of Dave's team.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get any line on Milly?" asked Dave, as he peeled off his
      shirt. "By gum! you shore rustled across the prairie
      to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was glad to acquaint his comrade with the trace he had
      obtained of Jett's outfit. Dave vented his satisfaction in
      forceful, though profane, speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was performing his ablutions Dunn and Ory Tacks
      drove in with the day's total of hides, eighty-six, not a
      good showing. Dunn threw the folded hides out on the open
      ground some rods from camp, while Tacks unhitched the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudnall, swift and capable round the camp fire as
      elsewhere, had a steaming supper soon ready, to which the
      six men sat down hungry as wolves and as talkative as full
      mouths would permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ory Tacks had now been some weeks in the buffalo fields.
      Not in the least had it changed him, except that he did not
      appear to be quite so fat. Toil and danger had no power to
      transform his expression of infantile glee with life and
      himself. He wore the old slouch hat jauntily and, as
      always, a tuft of tow-colored hair stuck out through a hole
      in its crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ory plied Tom with queries about Sprague, obviously leading
      up to something, but Tom, being both hungry and thoughtful,
      did not give him much satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forthwith Ory, between bites, turned his interest to
      Stronghurl, with the difference that now he was more than
      eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Strongthrow," he began, as usual getting Dave's name
      wrong, "did you see my--our--the young lady at Sprague?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, she was gone with Jett, I'm shore sorry to say,"
      replied Dave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Sally gone!" ejaculated Ory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naw, I meant Tom's girl, Milly Fayre," replied Dave,
      rather shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you saw Miss Sally?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you a letter for me from her?" inquired Ory, with
      astonishing naïveté.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" gaped Dave, almost dropping a large bite of biscuit
      from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a letter for me from Sally," said Ory, now
      affirmatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boy, do you reckon me a pony-express rider, carryin' the
      mail?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you see much of her?" inquired Ory, with scrupulous
      politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nope. Not a great deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long were you with her? I'm asking, because if you saw
      her for even a little she'd have given you a message for
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only saw her about thirty minutes, an' then, 'cause Tom
      was shore rarin' to leave, Sally an' me was busy gettin'
      married," replied Dave, with vast assumed imperturbability.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had the effect to crush poor Ory into bewildered
      silence; he sank down quite staggered. Tom wanted to laugh,
      yet had not quite the meanness to let it out. Hudnall
      looked up, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dave, that's no way to tease Ory," he reproved, severely.
      "Ory's got as much right to shine up to Sally as you. Now
      if she sent him a letter you fork it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dave got red in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She didn't send none," he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure?" added Hudnall, suspiciously. "I ain't
      placin' too much confidence in you, Dave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it 'pears. But I'm not lyin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. An' after this don't make any fool remarks
      about marryin' Sally, just to tease Ory. It ain't good
      taste."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boss, I wasn't teasin' him or talkin' like Ory's hair
      sticks through his hat," returned Dave, deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" shouted Hudnall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me an' Sally was married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You was married!" roared Hudnall, in amaze and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. There was a travelin' parson at Sprague, an'
      Sally an' me thought it a good chance to marry. So we did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without askin' leave of me--of her dad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wasn't around. Sally was willin'--an' we thought we
      could tell you afterward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ask her mother? She was around."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nope. I wanted to, but Sally said her mother didn't think
      I was much of a match."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you just run off with my kid an' married her?" roared
      Hudnall, beside himself with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kid! Sally's a grown woman. See here, Hudnall, I didn't
      reckon you'd be tickled, but I shore thought you'd have
      some sense. Sally an' me would have married, when this
      huntin's over. I wanted some one to take care of my money,
      an' keep it, case I get killed out here. So what's wrong
      about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You big Swede!" thundered Hudnall. "You didn't ask
      <i>me.</i> That's what. An' I'm a mind to pound the
      stuffin's out of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stronghurl was not profoundly moved by this threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you feel that way, come on," he replied, coolly. He was
      a thick, imperturbable sort of fellow, and possibly, Tom
      thought, he might be a Swede.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck was shaking with silent mirth; Ory Tacks was
      reveling in revenge; Burn Hudnall sat divided between
      consternation and glee; old man Dunn looked on, very much
      amazed; and as for Tom, he felt that it looked mightily
      like a fight, yet he could not convince himself it would go
      that far.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, huh?" echoed Hudnall, boomingly, as he rose to
      his lofty height. He was twice the size of Stronghurl. He
      could have broken the smaller, though sturdy, bridegroom in
      short order. Slowly Stronghurl rose, at last seriously
      concerned, but resigned and forceful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon you can lick me, Hudnall," he said, "an' if it's
      goin' to make you feel better let's get it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer Hudnall seemed to change, to expand, and
      throwing back his shaggy head he let out a stentorian roar
      of laughter. That eased the situation. Pilchuck also broke
      out, and the others, except Dave, joined him to the extent
      of their mirth. Hudnall was the last to recover, following
      which he shoved a brawny hand at Stronghurl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dave, I was mad, natural-like, but you takin' me serious
      about fightin' over Sally was funny. Why, bless your heart,
      I'm glad for Sally an' you, even if you didn't ask me, an'
      I wish you prosperity an' long life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stronghurl's armor of density was not proof against this
      big-hearted and totally unexpected acceptance and approval,
      and he showed in his sudden embarrassment and halting
      response that he was deeply moved. Nor did he take the
      congratulations of the rest of the outfit as calmly as
      might have been supposed he would, from his announcement of
      the marriage. Ory Tacks showed to advantage in his sincere
      and manly overture of friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      What with this incident, and the news of Sprague to be told
      to Hudnall and Pilchuck, and their recital of the hunting
      conditions to Tom and Dave, the outfit did not soon get the
      day's hides pegged down, or to their much-needed beds.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Hudnall made the suggestion that each and all
      of the outfit would ride out of their way to look over new
      camps and to inquire of hunters as to the whereabouts of
      Randall Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, we can't stop work altogether, but we can all spare
      some time," he said. "An' I'll drive the wagon out an'
      back, so you'll have time to ride along the river. It's my
      idea we'll find Milly pronto."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what?" queried Tom, thrilling deeply with this good
      man's assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, you can leave that to me," interposed Pilchuck,
      dryly. Tom was quick to sense something in the scout's mind
      which had not been spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that day and the next and the following passed fleetly
      by without any trace of Jett's outfit. Ten miles up and
      down the river, on the west bank, had been covered by some
      one of Hudnall's outfit. No three-wagon camp had been
      located.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore Jett must be across the river," averred Pilchuck.
      "There's outfits strung along, an' enough buffalo for
      <i>him."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "What'll I do?" queried Tom, appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, son, you can't work an' do the job right," replied
      the scout. "I'd take a couple of days off. Ride down the
      river twenty miles or so, then cross an' come back on the
      other side. If that don't fetch results ride up the river,
      cross an' come back. Ask about Indians, too, an' keep your
      eyes peeled."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom's saddle horse, Dusty, had been ridden by Burn Hudnall
      and Pilchuck also during Tom's absence, and had developed
      into a fleet, tireless steed only second to Pilchuck's best
      buffalo chaser. Next morning Tom set off, mounted on Dusty.
      Well armed, with a small store of food, a canteen of water,
      and a field-glass, he turned resolute face to the task
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than two hours he had passed the ten-mile limit of
      his search so far, and had entered unfamiliar country where
      camps were many, and buffalo apparently as thick as bees
      round a hive. But very few of the camps had an occupant; at
      that hour all the men of each outfit were engaged up on the
      prairie, as the incessant boom of guns proved. How Tom's
      eyes strained and ached to catch a glimpse of the red scarf
      Milly said she would put up wherever she was! What bitter
      disappointment when he espied a blanket or anything holding
      a touch of red!
    </p>
    <p>
      From each camp Tom would ride up the prairie slope to a
      level and out toward the black-fringed, dust-mantled moving
      medium that was buffalo. Thus he came upon hunters,
      skinners, teamsters, all of whom gave him less cordial
      greeting than he had received from hide-hunters before he
      went north. It took some moments for Tom to make his
      sincerity felt. These men were rushed for time, and a
      feeling of aloofness from strangers had manifestly passed
      south from camp to camp. Not one of them could or would
      give him any clue to Jett's outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Air you lookin' fer hide thieves?" queried one old
      grizzled hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I'm looking for a girl who has been brought down here
      by a man named Jett."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry. Never heard of him. But if you was lookin' fer hide
      thieves I'd be damn interested," replied the hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" asked Tom, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I had eleven hundred hides stole from my camp," he
      replied, "an' ain't never heerd of them since, let alone
      seein' hide or hair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too bad. Is there much of this dirty work going on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How 'n 'll can we tell thet?" retorted the man. "Thar's
      forty square miles of buffler, millin' an' movin', too.
      Nobody can keep track of any one. It's all mad rush. But
      some dirty sneaks air gittin' rich on other men's work."
    </p>
    <p>
      Very few men Tom encountered, however, had any words to
      spare; and before that day was over he decided not to
      interrogate any more. It went against his grain to be
      regarded with hard, cold, suspicious eyes. There was no
      recourse for him but to search till he met Jett or found
      his camp. That struck him as far from a hopeless task, yet
      his longing and dread were poignant. He went on until he
      had passed the zone of camps and had drawn out of hearing
      of the boom-boom-boom of the big fifties. Not by many
      miles, though, had he come to the end of the buffalo herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the middle of the afternoon, too late for Tom to
      reach camp that day. He crossed the stream, now a clear
      shallow sandy-bottomed little watercourse, running swiftly.
      He was probably not many leagues from its source up in the
      bluffs of the Staked Plain, stark bald-faced heave of
      country, frowning down on the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom took the precaution to sweep the open stretches in
      front with his field-glass. All that he saw there were
      buffalo, near and far, everywhere, dots and strings and
      bands, just straggling remnants of the immense herd back
      over the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good trail, with horse tracks in it, followed the course
      of the water east, and led along the edge of the timber and
      sometimes through open groves. But Tom did not come to a
      road or see a camp or man or horse. The prairie was a
      beautiful grassy level, growing brown from the hot sun.
      Bands of antelope grazed within range of his gun, as tame
      as cattle; deer trotted ahead of him through the timber;
      wild turkeys by the hundreds looked up at his approach and
      made no effort to run. He saw bear and panther tracks in
      the dust of the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunset overtook Tom and still he rode on. Before dark,
      however, he espied a thick clump of timber in which he
      decided to spend the night. Finding a suitable place well
      down from the trail, he unsaddled Dusty and led him to the
      stream to drink, then picketed him with a long lasso on a
      grass plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twilight stole down into the grove while Tom ate some of
      the meat and bread he had taken the precaution to bring. No
      fire was necessary, as the air was close and sultry;
      besides, it might have attracted attention. He spread his
      saddle blankets for a bed, placed his saddle for a pillow,
      and with weapons at his side he lay down to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first night he had been alone on the Texas
      prairies. It was novel, strange, somehow exhilarating, and
      yet disturbing. His anxiety to find Milly had led him far
      from the hunters' camps, into wild country, where he must
      run considerable risk. His state of mind, therefore,
      rendered him doubly susceptible to all around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dusk mantled the river brakes. The night insects had begun
      their incessant song, low, monotonous, plaintive. And frogs
      joined in with their sweet, mellow, melodious trill. In
      spite of these sounds silence seemed to reign. Solitude was
      omnipresent there. Tom found it hard to realize that the
      extermination of America's most numerous and magnificent
      game beast was in frenzied operation along this river; that
      bands of Indians were on the warpath, and hide-robbers
      foraging secretly. Here the night and place were lonely,
      sad, provocative of such thoughts as had never before
      disturbed Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by his attention was attracted at intervals by soft
      padded steps somewhere near, and the cracking of twigs down
      in the brakes, and the squealing of raccoons. Once a wild
      cry startled him, so nearly like a woman's scream was it,
      and he recognized it as the rare cry of a panther. He had
      heard hunters at the camps tell of it. Gradually his
      nervousness wore away. These creatures of the wilderness
      would not harm him; he had only to fear those beings made
      in his own image.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night, the stars, the insects, the stealthy denizens of
      the brush, the soft, drowsy, sultry summer darkness with
      its dim flare of sheet lightning along the horizon, the
      loneliness and freedom of the open country--these worked on
      Tom's mind and from them he gathered a subtle confidence
      that there was something stronger than evil in men. Milly
      would not be lost to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Tom slept. He was awakened by the scratching and
      clucking of wild turkeys, so close that he could have
      tossed his hat among them. The sun was red in the east. He
      had slept late. To eat his meager breakfast, water and
      saddle his horse, fill his canteen, were but the work of a
      few moments, and then he was on his way again, alert,
      cautious, not to be misled by his ardor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom traveled ten miles farther east before his ears again
      throbbed to the boom of the big buffalo guns. Scattered
      herds grazed out on the prairie, but appeared unmolested by
      hunters. The shooting came from across the river. Five
      miles farther on, however, Tom reached the zone of camps on
      that side, and heard the boom of guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between that point and the river bluffs, which he
      recognized as landmarks near Hudnall's present location, he
      found and rode through seven camps of buffalo-hunters.
      Wagons, tents, reloading kits, mess boxes, bales of hides,
      squares and squares of hides pegged out--these were in no
      wise different from the particulars of the camps opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tom did not find what he sought. He crossed the river
      and rode towards Hudnall's with a heavy heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon was far spent, still it was too early for Tom
      not to be surprised to see his comrades in camp. There
      appeared to be other hunters--a group, talking earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom urged his tired horse to a trot, then a lope. Something
      was wrong at Hudnall's. He felt it. There came a cold
      tightening round his heart. Reaching camp, Tom flung
      himself out of the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ory Tacks, the nearest to Tom, as he advanced toward the
      men, was crying. Dunn sat near him, apparently dazed. Burn
      Hudnall's head was buried in his arms. Stronghurl and
      Pilchuck were in conversation with a group of seven or
      eight men, among whom Tom recognized hunters from adjoining
      camps. It was significant to behold these men all carrying
      their rifles. More significant was Pilchuck's face, hard,
      cold, forbidding, with his thin lips set in tight line and
      his eyes almost narrowed shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's--happened?" burst out Tom, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burn Hudnall raised a face Tom could never forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father was murdered by Indians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my God--no!" cried Tom, in distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. . . . I saw him killed--an' I just got away--by the
      skin of my teeth," replied Burn, in a dreadful voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How? When? Where?" panted Tom, shocked to his depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was father's carelessness. Oh, if he had only listened
      to Pilchuck. . . . Mebbe two hours ago. I was west of here
      four or five miles when I saw a band of Indians. They were
      ridin' towards us. I was skinnin' a bull an' was concealed
      behind the carcass. Father was off a quarter of a mile,
      ridin' round a small bunch of buffalo, shootin' fast, an'
      blind to anythin' else but buffalo. I yelled my lungs out.
      No use! He couldn't hear. I got to my horse an' was
      thinkin' of runnin' over to save father, when I saw I was
      too late. . . . The Indians rode like the wind. They ran
      down on father. I saw puffs of smoke an' heard shots.
      Father fell off his horse. Then the Indians circled round
      him, shootin', yellin', ridin' like naked painted devils. .
      . . Presently they quit racin', an' rode into a bunch,
      round where he lay. Some of them dismounted. Others rode
      toward the wagon an' team. These Indians saw me an' started
      for me. I tell you I had to ride, an' they chased me almost
      into camp. . . . Tom, I know what it is to hear the whistle
      of bullets!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's out there--on the prairie--dead?" gasped Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certain as death," replied Burn, solemnly. "Who's to tell
      mother an' Sally?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--but we must go out there--to see--to find out--."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pilchuck's taken charge, Tom," replied the other. "He says
      the Indians were Comanches an' in pretty strong force.
      We're to wait till morning, get a bunch of men together,
      an' then go out to bury father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was stunned. The catastrophe as persistently portended
      by Pilchuck and corroborated by Sprague had at last fallen.
      Splendid, fine, kindly Hudnall was dead at the hands of
      revengeful savages. It was terrible. To be warned of such a
      thing was nothing, but the fact itself stood out in
      appalling vividness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's rustle supper while it's daylight," said Pilchuck,
      coming over. "We don't want a camp fire to-night. Reckon
      there's hardly any danger of attack, but we want to stand
      guard an' not take any chances."
    </p>
    <p>
      Camp tasks had to go on just the same, and Tom helped Dunn
      and Ory Tacks. The other hunters turned to leave with an
      understanding that they were to stand guard at their camps,
      and return in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Starwell, we'll plan to-morrow after we bury Hudnall,"
      said the scout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One only plan," replied the other, a lean, dark, forceful
      looking Westerner whom Tom felt he would not care to cross.
      "We buff-hunters must band together an' trail them
      Comanches."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon you're right, Star," returned Pilchuck, grimly.
      "But there's no rush. Them redskins have done more'n kill
      Hudnall, I'll bet you. They've been raidin'. An' they'll
      strike for the Staked Plain. That means we've got to
      organize. If there's a hell of a place in the world it's
      shore the Staked Plain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper without the cheerful presence of Hudnall would have
      been a loss, but the fact that he lay dead, murdered,
      surely mutilated, out there on the prairie, was monstrous
      to Tom. He could not eat. He wandered about camp, slowly
      realizing something beyond the horror of the calamity, a
      gradual growth from shock to stern purpose. No need to ask
      Pilchuck what was in his mind! The plainsman loomed now in
      Tom's sight big and strong, implacable and infallible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom stood guard with Stronghurl during the earlier watches
      of the night; and the long-drawn mournful howl of the
      prairie wolf had in it a new significance. This wild West
      was beginning to show its teeth.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Morning came, and Pilchuck had the men stirring early. When
      Tom walked out to the camp fire dawn was brightening, and
      there was a low roll of thunder from the eastward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're in for a thunderstorm," he said to the scout, who
      was cooking breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Storm, mebbe, but not thunder-an'-lightnin' storm,"
      replied Pilchuck. "That sound you hear is new to you. It's
      a stampede of buffalo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so? . . . Say, how like thunder!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yep, we plainsmen call it the thunderin' herd. But this
      isn't the main herd on the rampage. Somethin', most likely
      Indians, has scared the buffalo across the river. They've
      been runnin' south for an hour. More buffalo over there
      than I had an idee of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I saw miles of scattered herds as I rode up the
      river," said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I smell smoke, too, an' fact is, Doan, I don't like things
      a damn bit. If the main herd stampedes--holy Moses! I want
      to be on top of the Staked Plain. Reckon, though, that's
      just where we'll be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're going after the Comanches?" inquired Tom,
      seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, I reckon. It's got to be done if we're to hunt
      buffalo in peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      Burn Hudnall presented himself at the camp fire, his face
      haggard with grief; but he was now composed. He sat at
      breakfast as usual, and later did his share of the tasks.
      Not long afterward Starwell and his men rode into camp,
      heavily armed and formidable in appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jude, what you make of that stampede across the river?" he
      asked, after greetings were exchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, I ain't makin' much, but I don't like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We heerd shootin' yesterday at daylight down along the
      river from our camp," returned Starwell. "Small-bore guns,
      an' I don't calkilate hunters was shootin' rabbits for
      breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahuh! Wal, after we come back from buryin' Hudnall we'll
      take stock of what's goin' on," said Pilchuck. "By that
      time camp will be full of hunters, I reckon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hardy rode twenty miles an' more down the river, gettin'
      back late last night. He said there'd be every outfit
      represented here this mornin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. We kept the horses picketed last night, an' we'll be
      saddled in a jiffy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Burn Hudnall led that band of mounted men up on the prairie
      and southwest toward the scene of yesterday's tragedy. The
      morning was hot; whirlwinds of dust were rising, like
      columns of yellow smoke; the prairie looked lonesome and
      vast; far out toward the Staked Plain showed a dim ragged
      line of buffalo. Across the river the prairie was obscured
      in low covering of dust, like rising clouds. The thunder of
      hoofs had died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Doan, riding with these silent, somber men, felt a
      strong beat of his pulse that was at variance with the
      oppression of his mind. He was to be in the thick of wild
      events.
    </p>
    <p>
      In perhaps half an hour the trotting horses drew within
      sight of black dots on the prairie, and toward these Burn
      Hudnall headed. They were dead and unskinned buffalo.
      Presently Burn halted alongside the first carcass, that of
      a bull, half skinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's where I was, when the Indians came in sight over
      that ridge," said Burn, huskily. "Father must be lyin' over
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed toward where a number of black woolly dead
      buffalo lay scattered over the green plain, and rode toward
      them. Presently Pilchuck took the lead. His keen eye no
      doubt had espied the corpse of Hudnall, for as he passed
      Burn he said, "Reckon it'd be more sense for you not to
      look at him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Burn did not reply, but rode on as before. Pilchuck drew
      ahead and Starwell joined him. The riders scattered
      somewhat, some trotting forward, and others walking their
      horses. Then the leaders dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somebody hold Burn back," shouted Pilchuck, his bronze
      face flashing in the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though several of the riders, and lastly Tom,
      endeavored to restrain Burn, he was not to be stopped. Not
      the last was he to view his father's remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon it's Comanche work," declared Pilchuck, in a voice
      that cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudnall's giant body lay, half nude, in grotesque and
      terrible suggestiveness. He had been shot many times, as
      was attested to by bullet holes in his torn and limp limbs.
      His scalp had been literally torn off, his face gashed, and
      his abdomen ripped open. From the last wound projected
      buffalo grass which had been rammed into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the hunters gazed in silence down upon the ghastly
      spectacle. Then from Burn Hudnall burst an awful cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take him away, somebody," ordered Pilchuck. Then after
      several of the hunters had led the stricken son aside the
      scout added: "Tough on a tenderfoot! But he would look.
      Reckon it'd be good for all newcomers to see such a sight.
      . . . Now, men, I'll keep watch for Comanches while you
      bury poor Hudnall. Rustle, for it wouldn't surprise me to
      see a bunch of the devils come ridin' over that ridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      With pick and shovel a deep grave was soon dug, and
      Hudnall's body, wrapped in a blanket, was lowered into it.
      Then the earth was filled in and stamped down hard. Thus
      the body of the careless, cheerful, kindly Hudnall was
      consigned to an unmarked grave on the windy prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck found the tracks of the wagon, and the trail of
      the Comanches heading straight for the Staked Plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, Star, that's as we reckoned," declared the scout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore is," replied Starwell. "They stole wagon, hosses,
      gun, hides--everythin' Hudnall had out here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon we'll hear more about this bunch before the day's
      over. Must have been fifty Indians an' they have a habit of
      ridin' fast and raidin' more'n one place at a time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jude, my idee is they'd not have taken the wagon if they
      meant to make another raid," said Starwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon you're right. Wal, we'll rustle back to camp."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      More than thirty hunters, representatives of the outfits
      within reaching distance of Hudnall's, were assembled at
      camp when the riders returned from their sad mission. All
      appeared eager to learn the news, and many of them had
      tidings to impart.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old white-haired hunter declared vigorously: "By Gord!
      we air goin' to give the buffalo a rest an' the Injuns a
      chase!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That indeed seemed the prevailing sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men, before we talk of organizin' let's get a line on
      what's been goin' on," said Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon the hunters grouped themselves in the shade of
      the cottonwoods, like Indians in Council. The scout told
      briefly the circumstances surrounding the murder of
      Hudnall, and said he would leave his deductions for later.
      Then he questioned the visiting hunters in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rathbone's camp, thirty miles west, on a creek running down
      out of the Staked Plain, had been burned by Comanches,
      wagons and horses stolen, and the men driven off, just
      escaping with their lives. That had happened day before
      yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      The camp of two hunters, names not known, had been set upon
      by Indians, presumably the same band, on the main branch of
      the Pease. The hunters were out after buffalo. They found
      wagons, hides, tents, camp destroyed; only ammunition and
      harness being stolen. These hunters had made their way to
      the main camps.
    </p>
    <p>
      An informant from down the river told that some riders,
      presumably Indians, had fired the prairie grass in
      different widely separated places, stampeding several herds
      of buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the representatives from the camps up the river had
      nothing particularly important to impart, except noticeable
      discontent in the main herd of buffalo, and Starwell's
      repetition of the facts relating to the shots he and his
      camp-mates had heard yesterday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon a lanky man, unknown to Pilchuck's group, spoke
      up:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can tell aboot thet. My name's Roberts. I belong to Sol
      White's outfit across the river. We're from Waco, an' one
      of the few outfits from the South. This mawnin' there was a
      stampede on our side, an' I was sent across to scout
      around. I crossed the river aboot two miles above heah.
      Shore didn't know the river an' picked out a bad place. An'
      I run plumb on to a camp thet was so hid I didn't see it.
      But I smelled smoke an' soon found where tents, wagons, an'
      hides had been burnin'. There was two daid men, scalped,
      lyin' stripped, with sticks poked into their stomachs--so I
      hurried up this way to find somebody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men, I want a look at that camp," declared Pilchuck,
      rising. "Some of you stay here an' some come along. Star,
      I'd like you with me. Roberts, you lead an' we'll follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom elected to remain in camp with those who stayed behind;
      he felt that he had seen enough diabolical work of the
      Comanches. Burn Hudnall likewise shunned going. Ory Tacks,
      however, took advantage of the opportunity, and rode off
      with Pilchuck. Tom tried to find tasks to keep his mind off
      the tragic end of Hudnall and the impending pursuit of the
      Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck and his attendants were gone so long that the
      visiting hunters left for their own camps, saying they
      would ride over next day. Worry and uncertainty were
      fastening upon those men who were not seasoned Westerners.
      They had their own camps and buffalo hides to consider. But
      so far as Tom could ascertain there was not a dissenting
      voice against the necessity for banding together to protect
      themselves from Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      About mid-afternoon the scout and newcomer from across the
      river returned alone. Pilchuck was wet and muddy from
      contact with the river bank; and his mood, if it had
      undergone any change, was colder and grimmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doan, reckon I'm a blunt man, so get your nerve," he said,
      with his slits of piercing eyes on Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What--do you mean?" queried Tom, feeling a sudden sinking
      sensation of dread. Bewildered, uncertain, he could not fix
      his mind on any effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This camp Roberts took me to was Jett's. But I think Jett
      got away with your girl," announced Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground seemed to fail of solidity under Tom; his legs
      lost their strength, and he sat down on a log.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't look like that," ordered Pilchuck, sharply. "I told
      you the girl got away. Starwell thought the Indians made
      off with her. But I reckon he's wrong there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jett! Milly?" was all Tom could gasp out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pull yourself together. It's a man's game we're up
      against. You're no tenderfoot any more," added Pilchuck,
      with a tone of sympathy. "Look here. You said somethin'
      about your girl tyin' her red scarf up to give you a hunch
      where she was. Do you recognize this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He produced a red scarf, soiled and blackened.
    </p>
    <p>
      With hands Tom could not hold steady to save his life he
      took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milly's," he said, very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckoned so myself. Wal, we didn't need this proof to
      savvy Jett's camp. I'd seen his outfit. These dead men
      Roberts happened on belonged to Jett's outfit. I recognized
      the little sandy-haired teamster. An' the other was
      Follonsbee. Got his name from Sprague."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tom found voice poignantly to beg Pilchuck to tell him
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore it's a mess," replied the scout, as he sat down and
      wiped his sweaty face. "Look at them boots. I damn near
      drowned myself. Wal, Jett had his camp in a place no
      Indians or buffalo-hunters would ever have happened on,
      unless they did same as Roberts. Crossed the river there.
      Accident! . . . Doan, this fellow Jett is a hide thief an'
      he had bad men in his outfit. His camp was destroyed by
      Comanches all right, the same bunch that killed Hudnall.
      But I figure Jett escaped in a light wagon, before the
      Indians arrived. Follonsbee an' the other man were killed
      <i>before</i> the Indians got there. They were shot with a
      needle gun. An' I'm willin' to bet no Comanches have needle
      guns. All the same they was scalped an' mutilated, with
      sticks in their bellies. Starwell agreed with me that these
      men were killed the day or night before the Indians raided
      the camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had Jett--gotten away--then?" breathlessly asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore he had. I seen the light wheel tracks an' Milly's
      little footprints in the sand, just where she'd stepped up
      on the wagon. I followed the wheel tracks far enough to see
      they went northeast, away from the river, an' also aimin'
      to pass east of these buffalo camps. Jett had a heavy load,
      as the wheel tracks cut deep. He also had saddle horses
      tied behind the wagon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where'd you find Milly's scarf?" asked Tom, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was tied to the back hoop of a wagon cover. Some of the
      canvas had been burned. There was other things, too, a
      towel an' apron, just as if they'd been hung up after
      usin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is Milly's!" exclaimed Tom, and he seemed to freeze
      with the dreadful significance it portended.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much for that. Shore the rest ain't easy to figure,"
      went on Pilchuck. "I hate to tell you this part, Doan,
      because--wal, it <i>is</i> worryin' . . . I found trail
      where a bleedin' body, mebbe more'n one, had been dragged
      down the bank an' slid off into the river. That's how I
      come to get in such a mess. The water was deep there an'
      had a current, too. If we had hooks an' a boat we could
      drag the river, but as we haven't we can only wait. After
      some days corpses float up. I incline to the idee that
      whoever killed Follonsbee an' the other man is accountable
      for the bloody trail leadin' to the river. But I can't be
      shore. Starwell thinks different from me on some points.
      Reckon his opinion is worth considerin'. In my own mind I'm
      shore of two things--there was a fight, mebbe murder, an'
      <i>somebody</i> rode away with the girl. Then the Comanches
      came along, destroyed the camp, an' scalped the men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' say, scout," spoke up Roberts, "you're, shore
      forgettin' one important fact. The Indians left there
      trailin' the wagon tracks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahuh, I forgot that," replied the scout, averting his gaze
      from Tom's. "Jett had a good start. Now if he kept
      travelin' all night--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it looks as if he had no knowledge of the Indians
      comin'," interrupted Tom, intensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore. All the same, Jett was gettin' away from somethin'.
      He'd rustle far before campin'," continued the scout,
      doggedly bent on hoping for the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not lost on Tom nor the gloomy cast of Pilchuck's
      lean face. Tom could not feel anything save black despair.
      Either Jett had the girl or the Indians had her--and the
      horror seemed that one was as terrible as the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom sought his tent, there to plunge down and surrender to
      panic and misery.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning the hunters round their early camp fires were
      interested to hear a low thunder of running buffalo. It
      floated across the river from the south and steadily grew
      louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That darned herd comin' back," said Pilchuck, uneasily. "I
      don't like it. Shore they're liable to cross the river an'
      stampede the main herd."
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later a hunter from below rode in to say that
      buffalo by the thousands were fording the river five miles
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck threw up his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckoned so. Wal, we've got to make the best of it. What
      with raidin' Comanches an' stampedin' buffalo we're done
      for this summer--as far as any big haul of hides is
      concerned."
    </p>
    <p>
      Men new to the hunting fields did not see the signs of the
      times as Pilchuck and the other scouts read them; and they
      were about equally divided for and against an active
      campaign against the Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good many hunters along the Pease continued their
      hide-hunting, indifferent to the appeal and warning of
      those who knew what had to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulty lay in getting word to the outfits scattered
      all over northern Texas. For when the buffalo-hunters
      organized to make war upon the marauders, that meant a
      general uprising and banding together of Comanches, Kiowas,
      Arapahoes, and Cheyennes. Also there were Apaches on the
      Staked Plain, and they, too, according to reports, were in
      uneasy mood. Therefore buffalo-hunters not affiliated with
      the war movement, or camping in isolated places unknown to
      the organizers, stood in great peril of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Investigation brought out the fact that a great number of
      hunters from eastern Texas were on the range, not in any
      way connected with the experienced and time-hardened band
      camped on the trail of the main herd. Effort was made to
      get word to these eastern hunters that a general conference
      was to be held at Double Fork on a given date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over three hundred hunters attended this conference,
      including all the scouts, plainsmen, and well-known
      frontier characters known to be in the buffalo country.
      Buffalo Jones, already famous as a plainsman, and later
      known as the preserver of the buffalo, was there, as strong
      in his opinion that the Indian should be whipped as he was
      in his conviction that the slaughter of buffalo was a
      national blunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Jones's contention that the value and number of
      American buffalo were unknown to the world--that the
      millions that had ranged the Great Plains from Manitoba to
      the Rio Grande were so common as to be no more appreciated
      than prairie-dogs. Their utilitarian value was not
      understood, and now it was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indians knew the value of the buffalo, and if they did
      not drive the white hunter from the range, the beasts were
      doomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only the buffalo-hunters can open up the Southwest to the
      farmer and cattleman," averred Jones. "The U. S. army can't
      do it. . . . But what a pity the buffalo must go! Nature
      never constructed a more perfect animal."
    </p>
    <p>
      The buffalo, according to Jones, was an evolution of the
      Great Plains, and singularly fitted to survive and flourish
      on its vast and varied environment. He estimated the number
      as ten million. The blizzard of Montana or the torrid
      sirocco of the Staked Plain was no hindrance to the travel
      of the buffalo. His great, shaggy, matted head had been
      constructed to face the icy blasts of winter, the
      sandstorms and hot gales of the summer. A buffalo always
      faced danger, whatever it might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different men addressed the council, and none were more
      impressive than Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men, I've lived my life on the plains. I've fought Indians
      all down the line from Montana. I've seen for a long time
      that we buffalo-hunters have got to fight these Southern
      tribes or quit huntin'. If we don't kill off the buffalo
      there'll never be any settlin' of northern Texas. We've got
      to <i>kill</i> the Comanches, an' lick the Kiowas,
      Cheyennes, an' Arapahoes. I reckon we'll have to deal with
      Apaches, too. . . . Now the Indians are scattered all over,
      same as the buffalo-hunters. We can't organize one
      expedition. There ought to be several big outfits of men,
      well equipped, strikin' at these Indians already on the
      warpath. . . . We hunters along the Pease River divide will
      answer for that section. There's a bunch of Comanches been
      raidin', an' are now hidin' up in the Staked Plain. Outfits
      ought to take care of the Brazos River district an' also
      the Red River. . . . Now there's one more point I want to
      drive home. Camps an' outfits should be moved close
      together in these several districts that expect to send out
      fightin' men. An' an equal or even strong force should be
      left behind to protect these camp posts. Last, I shore hope
      the tenderfoot hunters will have sense enough to collect at
      these posts, even if they won't fight the Indians. For
      there's goin' to be hell. This will be a fight for the
      buffalo--the Indians fightin' to <i>save</i> the buffalo
      an' the white men fightin' to <i>kill</i> the buffalo.
      It'll be a buffalo war, an' I reckon right hereabouts,
      halfway between the Brazos an' Fort Elliott, will see the
      hottest of it. I just want every man of you who may be on
      the fence about fightin', an' mebbe doubtin' my words, to
      go out an' look at the <i>acres an' acres</i> of buffalo
      hides, an' then ask himself if the Indians are goin' to
      stand that."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The old scout turned the tide in favor of general arming
      against the tribes on all points of the range. Then
      Pilchuck, with his contingent from the Pease River, left
      for their own camps, four days' travel, determined to take
      the field at once against the Comanches.
    </p>
    <p>
      They visited every camp on the way south and solicited
      volunteers, arriving at Pease River with twenty-seven men
      ready to follow Pilchuck to the end. One of these was a
      friendly Osage Indian scout called Bear Claws by the men;
      another a Mexican who had been a scout in the United States
      army service and was reported to know every trail and water
      hole in the wild Staked Plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pilchuck, elated by his success in stirring up the
      hunters to the north, was fated to meet with a check down
      on the Pease River. Seventy-five of the hundred hunters who
      had agreed to take part in the campaign backed out, to
      Pilchuck's disgust. Many of these had gone back to hunting
      buffalo, blind to their danger or their utter selfishness.
      Naturally this not only held up Pilchuck's plan to start
      soon on the campaign, but also engendered bad blood.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The site of Hudnall's camp was now the rendezvous of from
      twenty to thirty outfits, most of which had failed the
      scout. At a last conference of hunters there Pilchuck,
      failing to persuade half of these men to fall in line,
      finally delivered a stinging rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, all I got to say is you're hangin' behind to make
      money while some of us have got to go out an' fight to
      protect you."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these reluctants was a young man named Cosgrove, a
      hard-drinking loud-mouthed fellow with whom Tom Doan had
      clashed before, on the same issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had been a faithful and tireless follower of Pilchuck,
      as much from loyalty to the cause as from desire for
      revenge on the Comanches, whom he was now convinced had
      either killed or carried off Milly Fayre. No authentic clew
      of Jett's escape or death had been found, but vague rumors
      of this and that, and more destroyed camps toward the
      north, especially a one-night-stand camp with a single
      wagon and but few horses, had at last stricken Tom's last
      remnant of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, Tom's state of mind was not conducive to
      tolerance, especially of such greed and selfishness as was
      manifested by some of the hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cosgrove was louder than usual in voicing his opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, to hell with the Indians," he said. "I'm a-goin' to
      keep on huntin' buffalo. It's nothin' to me who goes off on
      wild-goose chases."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cosgrove, you won't be missed, that's sure," retorted Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What d'ye mean?" demanded the other, his red, bloated face
      taking on an ugly look. He swaggered over to Tom. There was
      a crowd present, some thoughtful, many indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean we don't want such fellows as you," replied Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' why not? Didn't Pilchuck just ask me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure. He's asked a couple of hundred men, and lots of them
      are like you--<i>afraid to go!"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" shouted Cosgrove, hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll be better off without cowards like you," returned
      Tom, deliberately standing up, strung for any move.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a liar!" flashed Cosgrove, advancing threateningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom knocked him down. Then, as Cosgrove, cursing with rage,
      scrambled to his knees and drew his gun, the crowd
      scattered away on each side. All save Pilchuck, who knocked
      the half-leveled gun out of Cosgrove's hand and kicked it
      far aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hyar!" yelled the scout, sternly. "You might get hurt,
      throwin' a gun that way. I'm advisin' you to cool down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He needn't, far as I'm concerned," spoke up Tom,
      ringingly. "Let him have his gun."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck wheeled to see Tom standing stiff, gun in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You young rooster!" ejaculated Pilchuck, in surprise and
      disapproval. "Put that gun up an' rustle back to camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus had Tom Doan at last answered to the wildness of the
      buffalo range.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Worse, however, grew out of that incident, though it did
      not affect Tom Doan in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Pilchuck's lieutenants was a Texan known on the
      range as Spades Harkaway, a man to be feared in a quarrel.
      He had been present when Tom had knocked down young
      Cosgrove, and later he had taken exception to the talk of a
      man named Hurd, who was in the same outfit with Cosgrove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rumor of a fight reached Hudnall's camp that night, but not
      until next day were the facts known. Hurd had denounced
      Pilchuck's campaign, which had brought sharp reply from
      Harkaway. Bystanders came between the men at the moment,
      but later the two met again in Starwell's camp. Hurd had
      been imbibing red liquor and Harkaway had no intention of
      avoiding trouble. Again the question of Pilchuck's Indian
      campaign was raised by Hurd and coarsely derided. To this
      Harkaway had answered, first with a flaming arraignment of
      those hunters who meant to let Pilchuck's company stand the
      brunt of the fighting, and secondly with short, cutting
      contempt for Hurd. Then the latter, as the story came, had
      shot at Harkaway from behind other men. There followed a
      bad mess, in which the Texan killed Hurd and crippled one
      of his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      These fights traveling along the shortened lines of camp,
      brought the question to a heated pitch and split the
      hunters in that district. The majority, however, turned out
      to be on the side of the Hurd and Cosgrove type. Pilchuck
      had over fifty men to take on his campaign, and about the
      same number to remain behind to protect camps and hides.
      These men were to continue to hunt buffalo, but only on
      limited parts of the range near the camps, and always under
      the eyes of scouts patrolling the prairie, with keen eyes
      on the lookout to prevent surprise. Over twenty outfits,
      numbering nearly seventy-five men, who had not the nerve to
      fight Indians or to remain on the range, left that district
      for Fort Elliott and Sprague's Post, to remain until the
      Indian trouble was ended.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>
      <a name="c12" id="c12">CHAPTER XII</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck's band contained fifty-two men, most of whom
      owned, or had borrowed Creedmoor Sharps 45-caliber rifles
      for this expedition. These guns were more reliable and of
      longer range than the big fifties. Each man took at least
      two hundred loaded cartridges. Besides that, reloading
      tools and extra ammunition were included in the supplies.
      Four wagon loads of food and camp equipment, grain for
      horses, and medical necessities, were taken in charge of
      the best drivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This force was divided into three companies--one of twenty
      men under Pilchuck, and two, of sixteen men each, under old
      buffalo-hunters. This was to facilitate camping operations
      and to be in readiness to split into three fighting groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Doan was in Pilchuck's company, along with Stronghurl,
      Burn Hudnall, Ory Tacks, Starwell, Spades Harkaway, the
      Indian called Bear Claws, Roberts, and others whom Tom
      knew. There were at least eight or ten hunters, long used
      to the range, and grim, laconic men who would have made any
      fighting force formidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck, Bear Claws, Starwell, and Tom formed an advance
      guard, riding two miles ahead of the cavalcade. Both the
      scout and Starwell had powerful field-glasses. The rear
      guard consisted of three picked men under Harkaway. The
      route lay straight for the Staked Plain and was covered at
      the rate of fifteen miles a day. At night a strong guard
      was maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth day the expedition reached the eastern wall
      of the Staked Plain, a stark, ragged, looming escarpment,
      notched at long distances by canyons, and extending north
      and south out of sight. This bold upheaval of rock and
      earth now gave at close hand an inkling of the wild and
      inhospitable nature of the Staked Plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tracks of Hudnall's wagon led into a deep-mouthed
      canyon down whose rugged bottom poured a clear stream of
      water. Grass was abundant. Groves of cottonwood trees
      filled the level benches. Game of all kinds abounded in
      these fastnesses and fled before the approach of the
      hunters. Before noon of that day a small herd of buffalo,
      surprised in an open grassy park, stampeded up the canyon,
      completely obliterating the wagon tracks Pilchuck was
      following, and all other signs of the Comanches.
    </p>
    <p>
      This flight of the buffalo, on the other hand, helped to
      make a way where it was possible to get the four wagons of
      supplies up on the Staked Plain. Many horses and strong
      hands made short work of this labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Doan gazed in fascination at the wild, strange expanse
      before him, the Staked Plain, which though notorious of
      reputation, was so little known. He had expected to find it
      a gray level plain of sand. Sand there was, assuredly, but
      many other things at the same time, as appeared manifest in
      the sand dunes and bluffs and the ragged irregular brakes,
      and patches of grass, and wide areas of brush. In Tom's
      opinion, hunting Indians up there was indeed the wild-goose
      chase which the expedition had been stigmatized by many of
      the hunters who had remained behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the Mexican scout led straight to the spot
      where there had recently been a large encampment of
      Comanches. They had been gone for days, no doubt having
      gotten wind of the campaign against them. The tracks of
      Hudnall's wagon were found again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was now late in the day, camp was pitched here, with
      the three forces of hunters close together. By dark, supper
      was finished, the horses were picketed and herded, guards
      were on duty, and Pilchuck was in council with his two
      scouts and the more experienced of his men. It was decided
      to hold that camp for the next day, and send out
      detachments with the scouts to try and locate the
      Comanches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Round the camp fire that night Tom made the further
      acquaintance of Spades Harkaway, and found him an unique
      character, reticent as to himself, but not unwilling to
      talk about Texas, the buffalo, and the Indians. He had
      twice crossed the Staked Plain from its western boundary,
      the Pecos River, to the headwaters of the Brazos on the
      east.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thet name Llano Estacado means Staked Plain," said the
      Texan. "It comes from the early days when the Spanish Trail
      from Santa Fe to San Antone was marked by <i>'palos,'</i>
      or stakes. There was only two trails across in them days
      an' I reckon no more now. Only the Indians know this plain
      well an' they only run in heah to hide awhile. Water an'
      grass are plentiful in some parts, an' then there's
      stretches of seventy miles dry an' bare as a bone. Reckon
      aboot some of the wildest an' roughest holes in Texas are
      up heah, as shore you-all will find oot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harkaway claimed the Llano Estacado was shaped like a ham,
      with a north-to-south trend, about four hundred miles long,
      and more than half as much wide. It was a tableland,
      resembling more the Russian steppes than the other upland
      districts known in the West. Its height above the prairie
      was perhaps a thousand feet. Some of its most pronounced
      characteristics, that had helped to make its ill fame, were
      enumerated and described by the Texan as tremendous
      obstacles to overcome on an expedition like Pilchuck's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar's bare patches too big to see across," he specified,
      "an' others growed over with mesquite so thick thet ridin'
      it is impossible. Thar's narrow deep canyons thet can only
      be crossed in places miles apart. Then I've seen, myself,
      canyons thet opened out wide an' full of jumbles of broken
      cliff, where no man could go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Higher up on the Staked Plain there were levels of a
      hundred miles in length, like a gravel floor, treeless,
      grassless, waterless, where the wind swept all before it.
      There were zones where ponds of water lay at times, a few
      of them permanent, sulphurous, or salty, and at dry seasons
      unfit to drink for man or beast. Near the southern end of
      this strange steppe was a belt of glistening white sand
      dunes, many miles wide, impassable for a horse, and
      extremely perilous for a man. Not, however, from lack of
      water! For here the singular nature of the Staked Plain was
      more than unusually marked. Permanent ponds lined by reeds
      and rushes existed in the very region of sand dunes. Along
      the whole eastern escarpment of the Staked Plain, for three
      hundred miles, the bold rock rim was cut and furrowed by
      the streams that had their sources in this mysterious
      upland.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Late next day the Mexican scout returned with the
      information that he had found the main encampment of the
      Comanches. He had been on a reconnoiter alone. Bear Claws
      and Pilchuck, who had essayed to follow the tracks of
      Hudnall's wagon, had actually lost all sign of them. For
      miles they had trailed the marks of the iron-shod wheels
      over an area of hard-packed gravel, only to lose them
      further on in tough, short, springy grass that after the
      recent rain left no trace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Indian says he can find the wagon tracks by making a
      wide circle to get off the grass," Pilchuck informed
      Starwell, "but that might take days. Besides, the Indians
      sent the wagon off their main trail. Reckon they expected
      pursuit. Anyway, we'll not risk it."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pilchuck made this decision he did not yet know that
      the Mexican had located the Comanches. Upon consulting with
      him the information came out that a large band of Indians
      had been encamped in a canyon, and undoubtedly their
      lookouts had seen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was verified next day, after a hard ride. An Indian
      band, large enough to have hundreds of horses, had hastily
      abandoned the encampment in the canyon and had climbed up
      on the plain, there to scatter in all directions. Plain
      trails were left in several cases, but these Bear Claws
      would not pay any attention to. The Mexican sided with him.
      They concentrated on dimmer trails over harder ground to
      follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after dark when Pilchuck and his men got back to
      camp, hungry and weary from a long day in the saddle. Next
      morning camp was moved ten miles to the west, to a secluded
      spot within easy striking distance of the place where Bear
      Claws had left off trailing the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day the Osage Indian lost track of the Comanches for
      the reason that the trail, always dim, finally vanished
      altogether. Three days more of searching the fastnesses
      within riding distance of this camp availed nothing. Camp
      had to be moved again, this time, at the Indian's
      suggestion, across the baffling stretch of plain to a wild
      and forbidding chaos of ruined cliffs, from which center
      many shallow canyons wandered for some leagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon we've got to rely on our field-glasses to see them
      before they see us," said Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sun rose high enough next morning to burn out the
      shadows Pilchuck stood with his scouts and some of his men
      on the crest of the rocky wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore that's a hole!" he ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far and wide heaved the broken billows of gray rock, like
      an immense ragged sea, barren, monotonous, from which the
      heat veils rose in curtains. Here and there a tufted cedar
      raised its dwarfed head, but for the most part there was no
      green to break the stark nudity. Naked eyes of white men
      could only see the appalling beauty of the place and enable
      the mind to grasp the deceiving nature of its distance,
      size and color. Pilchuck took a long survey with his
      field-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon all them meanderin' gorges head in one big canyon
      way down there," he said, handing the glass to Starwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I agree with you, an' I'm gamblin' the Comanches are
      there," replied Starwell, in turn handing the glass to the
      man nearest him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had a good look at that magnified jumble of rocks and
      clefts, and the wonder of its wildness awed and thrilled
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing next to Tom was Bear Claws, the Osage Indian, and
      so motionless, so striking was he as he gazed with dark,
      piercing eyes across the void, that Tom marveled at him and
      felt the imminence of some startling fact. Pilchuck
      observed this, also, for as he stood behind the Indian he
      watched him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bear Claws was over six feet tall, lithe, lean, erect, with
      something of the look of an eagle about him. His bronze,
      impassive face bore traces of vermilion paint. Around his
      neck was the bear-claw necklace from which the hunters had
      nicknamed him. In the back of his scalp-lock, a twisted
      knot of hair, he had stuck the tail feathers of a prairie
      bird. Bright bracelets of steel shone on his wrists. He was
      naked to his beaded and quilled breech-clout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me," he grunted, reaching for Pilchuck's field-glass,
      without taking his fixed gaze from what held him. With both
      hands then he put the glass to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ugh!" he exclaimed, instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a moment of excitement and suspense for the watching
      men. Pilchuck restrained Starwell's impatience. Tom felt a
      cold ripple run over his body, and then as the Indian said,
      "Comanches!" that ripple seemed suddenly to be strung with
      fire. He thought of Milly Fayre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bear Claws held the glass immovable, with stiff hand, while
      he stepped from behind it, and drew Pilchuck to the exact
      spot where he had stood. His long-reaching arm seemed
      grotesque while his body moved guardedly. He was
      endeavoring to keep the glass leveled at the exact spot
      that had held him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck fastened hard down on the glass, that wavered
      slightly and then gradually became still. To the watching
      men he evidently was an eternity. But at last he spoke: "By
      thunder! he's right. I can just make out . . . Indians on
      trail--goin' down--head of that canyon all these rock draws
      run into. . . . Starwell, take a look. . . . Hold there,
      over that first splinter of cliff, in a line with the high
      red bluff--an' search at its base."
    </p>
    <p>
      Other glasses were now in use and more than one of the
      hunters caught a glimpse of the Comanches before they
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      A council was held right there. The distance was
      approximately ten miles, yet incredibly the Osage Indian
      had seen something to make him take the field-glass and
      verify his wonderful keenness of vision. The Mexican scout
      knew the topography of the rough rock waste and guaranteed
      to place Pilchuck's force within striking distance of the
      Comanches by dawn next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the hunters retraced their steps from that high
      point and returned to camp. Pilchuck took the scouts to
      search for a well-hidden pocket or head of a box canyon
      where wagons and horses not needed could be concealed to
      advantage and protected by a small number of men. This was
      found, very fortunately, in the direction of the Indian
      encampment, and several miles closer. The move was made
      expeditiously before dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon this is pretty good," said Pilchuck, with
      satisfaction. "We're far enough away to be missed by any
      scout they send out to circle their camp. That's an old
      Indian trick--to ride a circle round a hidin' place, thus
      crossin' any trail of men sneakin' close. It hardly seems
      possible we can surprise a bunch of Staked Plain Comanches,
      but the chance shore looks good."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkest hour before dawn forty grim men rode out of
      camp behind the Mexican and Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Doan rode next to Bear Claws, the fifth of that
      cavalcade, and following him came Spades Harkaway. No one
      spoke. The hoofs of the horses gave forth only dull, sodden
      sounds, inaudible at little distance. There was an opaque
      misshapen moon, orange in color, hanging low over the
      uneven plain. The morning star, white, luminous, like a
      marvelous beacon, stood high above the blanching velvet of
      the eastern sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      They traveled at walk or trot, according to the nature of
      the ground, until the moon went down and all the stars had
      paled, except the great one in the east. This, too, soon
      grew wan. The gray of dawn was at hand. Dismounting in the
      lee of a low ledge, where brush grew thick and the horses
      could be tied, Pilchuck left two men on guard and led the
      others on foot behind the noiseless Mexican.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than a quarter of a mile the Mexican whispered
      something and slipped to his hands' and knees. Pilchuck and
      his followers, two and three abreast, kept close to his
      heels. The fact that the Mexican crept on very slowly and
      made absolutely no sound had the effect of constraining
      those behind him to proceed as stealthily. This wrought
      upon the nerves of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Doan had never experienced such suspense. Just ahead of
      him lay the unknown ground never seen by him or any of his
      white comrades, and it held, no one knew how close, a peril
      soon to be encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dawn was growing lighter and rows of rocks ahead could
      be distinguished. The ground began to slope. Beyond what
      seemed a gray space, probably a canyon, rose a dim vague
      bulk, uneven and woolly. Soon it showed to be canyon slope
      with brush on the rim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom, finding that he often rustled the weeds or scraped on
      the hard ground, devoted himself to using his eyes as well
      as muscles to help him crawl silently. Thus it was that he
      did not look up until Pilchuck's low "Hist!" halted
      everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tom saw with starting eyes a deep bend in a wonderful
      gully where on a green level of some acres in extent were a
      large number of Indian tepees. A stream wound through the
      middle of this oval and its low rush and gurgle were the
      only sounds to accentuate the quiet of the morning.
      Hundreds of Indian ponies were grazing, standing, or lying
      down all over this meadow-like level. Not an Indian
      appeared in sight. But as the light was still gray and dim
      there could not be any certainty as to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck raised himself to peer over a rock, and he studied
      the lay of the encampment, the narrow gateways of canyon
      above and below, and the approaches from the slope on his
      side. Then he slipped back to face the line of crouching
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By holdin' high we're in range right here," he whispered,
      tensely. "Starwell, take ten men an' crawl back a little,
      then round an' down to a point even with where this canyon
      narrows below. Harkaway, you take ten men an' go above, an'
      slip down same way. Go slow. Don't make noise. Don't stand
      up. We can then see each other's positions an' command all
      but the far side of this canyon. That's a big camp--there's
      two hundred Indians, more if they have their families. An'
      I reckon they have. Now Indians always fight harder under
      such conditions. We're in for a hell of a fight. But don't
      intentionally shoot squaws an' kids. That's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      With only the slightest rustle and scrape, and deep intake
      of breath, the two detachments under Starwell and Harkaway
      crept back among the stones out of sight. Then absolute
      silence once more reigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck's men lay flat, some of them, more favorably
      located than others, peering from behind stones. No one
      spoke. They all waited. Meanwhile the gray dawn broadened
      to daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ugh!" grunted Bear Claws, deep in his throat. His sinewy
      hand gripped Tom's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom raised his head a couple of inches and he espied a tall
      Indian standing before a tepee, facing the east, where
      faint streaks of pink and rose heralded the sunrise. Tom
      felt a violent start jerk over his whole body. It was a hot
      burst of blood. This very Comanche might have been one of
      the murderers of Hudnall or, just as much a possibility,
      one of the despoilers of Jett's camp, from which Milly
      Fayre had disappeared. That terrible loss seemed to Tom far
      back in the past, lengthened, changed by suffering. It was
      nothing less than hate with which Tom watched that
      statuesque Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently another Indian brave appeared, and another, then
      several squaws, and in a comparatively short time the camp
      became active. Columns of blue smoke arose lazily on the
      still air. The ponies began to move about.
    </p>
    <p>
      What an endless period it seemed to Tom before Harkaway and
      Starwell got into their positions! Tom wondered if Pilchuck
      would wait much longer. His blood beat thick at his
      temples; his throat was dry; and a dimness of eye bothered
      him every few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ugh!" exclaimed Bear Claws, and this time he touched
      Pilchuck, directing him toward a certain point in the
      encampment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that juncture there pealed out a singularly penetrating
      yell, most startling in its suddenness and nerve-racking
      with its terrible long-drawn and sustained wildness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comanche war-cry!" hissed Pilchuck. "Some buck has
      glimpsed our men below. Wait! We want the shootin' to begin
      below an' above. Then mebbe the Indians will run this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had the scout ceased his rapid whisper when a
      Sharps rifle awoke the sleeping echoes. It came from
      Starwell's detachment below.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant the Indian camp became a scene of wild rush
      and shrill cry, above which pealed sharp quick shouts--the
      voice of authority. A heavy volley from Starwell's men was
      signal for Harkaway's to open up. The puffs of white smoke
      over the stone betrayed the whereabouts of both
      detachments. A rattle of Winchesters from the camp told how
      speedily many of the Indians had gotten into action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite Pilchuck's orders, some of his men began to fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, if you can't wait. But shoot high," he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty Creedmoors thundered in unison from that rocky
      slope. It seemed to Tom then that hell had indeed broken
      loose. He had aimed and shot at a running brave. What
      strange fierceness he felt! His hands shook to spoil his
      aim and his face streamed with cold sweat. All the men were
      loading and firing, and he was in the midst of a cracking
      din. Yet above it all rose a weird piercing sound--the
      war-cry of the Comanches. Tom thought, as he shuddered
      under it, that he understood now why hunters had talked of
      this most hideous and infamous of all Indian yells.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments the first blending roar of guns and yells
      broke, and there intervened a less consistent din.
      Pandemonium reigned down in that encampment, yet there must
      have been many crafty Indians. Already the front line of
      tepees was in flames, sending up streaks of smoke, behind
      which the women and children were dimly seen running for
      the opposite slope. A number of frightened mustangs were
      racing with flying manes and tails, up and down the canyon,
      but the majority appeared to be under control of the
      Indians and coralled at the widest point. Soon many braves,
      women and children, dragging packs and horses, were seen
      through or round the smoke on the opposite slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Comanche braves below then lived up to their reputation
      as the most daring and wonderful horsemen of the plains. To
      draw the fire of the hunters numbers of them, half naked
      demons, yelling, with rifles in hands, rode their mustangs
      bareback, with magnificent affront and tremendous speed,
      straight at the gateway of the canyon. They ran a gauntlet
      of leaden hail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom saw braves pitch headlong to the earth. He saw mustangs
      plunge and throw their riders far. And he also saw Indians
      ride fleet as the storm-winds under the volleys from the
      slope, to escape down the canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had one bunch of rider braves attempted this than
      another drove their mustangs pell-mell at the openings.
      They favored the lower gate, beneath Starwell's detachment,
      being quick to catch some little advantage there. The
      foremost of four Indians, a lean wild brave, magnificently
      mounted, made such a wonderful target with his defiance and
      horsemanship that he drew practically all the fire. He rode
      to his death, but his three companions flashed through the
      gateway in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold men! Hold!" yelled Pilchuck, suddenly at this
      juncture. "Load up an' wait. We're in for a charge or a
      trick."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Doan drew a deep breath, as if he were stifling. His
      sweaty powder-begrimed hands fumbled at the hot breech of
      his Creedmoor. How many times had he fired? He did not
      know, nor could he tell whether or not he had shot an
      Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following with sharp gaze where the scout pointed, Tom saw
      through smoke and heat the little puffs of white, all along
      behind the burning front line of tepees. There were many
      braves lying flat, behind stones, trees, camp duffle,
      everything that would hide a man. Bullets whistled over
      Tom's head and spanged from the rocks on each side of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Watch that bunch of horses!" called Pilchuck, warningly.
      "There's fifty if there's one. Reckon we've bit off more'n
      we can chew."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dimly through the now thinning smoke Tom could see the
      bunch of riders designated by Pilchuck. They were planning
      some audacious break like that of the braves who had
      sacrificed themselves to help their families to escape.
      This would be different, manifestly, for all the women and
      children, and the young braves with them, had disappeared
      over the far slope. It was war now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jude, they're too smart to charge us," said a grizzled old
      hunter. "I'll swear thet bunch is aimin' to make a break to
      git by an' above us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, if they do we'll be in a hell of a pickle," replied
      the scout. "I'll ask Bear Claws what he makes of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Osage readily replied, "No weyno," which Tom
      interpreted as being anything but good for the hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mexican urged Pilchuck to work back to higher ground,
      but the scout grimly shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly with remarkable swiftness the compact bunch of
      Indian horsemen disintegrated, and seemed to spill both to
      right and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the hell!" muttered Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      One line of Comanche riders swerved below the camp, the
      other above, and they rode strung out in single file, going
      in opposite directions. Starwell and Harkaway reserved
      their fire, expecting some trick. When halfway to each gate
      the leader of each string wheeled at right angles to head
      straight for the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God! they're goin' between us!" ejaculated Pilchuck.
      "Men, we've shore got to stick now an' fight for our
      lives."

    <p>
      At two hundred yards these incomparable riders were as hard
      to hit with bullets as birds on the wing. Starwell's
      detachment began to shoot and Harkaway's followed suit.
      Their guns were drowned in the dreadful war-cry of the
      Comanches. It seemed wilder, more piercing now, closer, a
      united sound, filling the ears, horrid yet not discordant,
      full of death, but for all that a magnificent blending of
      human voices. It was the cry of a wild tribe for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It lifted Tom's hair stiff on his head. He watched with
      staring eyes. How those mustangs leaped! They crossed the
      open level below, the danger zone of leaden hail, without a
      break in their speeding line. When they reached the base of
      the slope they were perked to their haunches, and in a
      flash each one was riderless. The Comanches had taken to
      the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahuh! I reckoned so," growled Pilchuck. "Pretty slick, if
      I do say it. Men, we've got crawlin' snakes to deal with
      now. You shore have to look sharp."
    </p>
    <p>
      This sudden maneuver had the same effect upon the Starwell
      and Harkaway detachments as it had on Pilchuck's. It almost
      turned the tables on the white men. How grave it was
      perhaps only the experienced plainsmen realized. They all
      reserved their fire, manifestly directing attention to his
      new and hidden peril. The Comanches left in camp, a
      considerable number, redoubled their shots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men, reckon it ain't time yet to say every one for
      himself," declared Pilchuck. "But we've shore got to crawl
      up to the level. Spread out, an' crawl flat on your
      bellies, an' keep rocks behind you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus began a retreat, fraught with great risk. Bullets from
      the Winchesters spanged off the rocks, puffing white powder
      dust into the air. And these bullets came from the rear.
      The Comanches on each side had vanished like lizards into
      the maze of bowlders. But every hunter realized these
      Indians were creeping, crawling, worming their way to
      places of advantage, keeping out of sight with the cunning
      natural to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom essayed to keep up with Bear Claws, but this was
      impossible by crawling. The Osage wriggled like a snake.
      Pilchuck, too, covered ground remarkably for a large man.
      Others crawled fast or slowly, according to their
      abilities. Thus the detachment, which had heretofore kept
      together, gradually disintegrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a short two hundred yards from the top of this
      slope to the position the hunters had abandoned. Crawling
      back seemed interminable and insurmountable to Tom. Yet he
      saw how imperative it was to get there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one was close behind Tom, crawling laboriously,
      panting heavily. It was Ory Tacks. As he was fat and round,
      the exertion was almost beyond his endurance and the risks
      were great. Tom had himself to think of, yet he wondered if
      he should not help Ory. Roberts crawled a little to Tom's
      left. He too was slow. An old white-haired buffalo-hunter
      named Calkins had taken Pilchuck's place on Tom's right.
      The others were above, fast wriggling out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bullet zipped off a stone close to Tom and sang into the
      air. It had come from another direction. Another bullet,
      striking in front of him, scattered dust and gravel in his
      face. Then bullets hissed low down, just over the rocks.
      The Comanches were not yet above the hunters. Calkins
      called low for those back of him to hurry, that the word
      had been passed back from Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was crawling as flat as a flounder, dragging a heavy
      gun. He could not make faster time. He was burning with
      sweat, yet cold as ice, and the crack of Winchesters had
      the discordance of a nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doan," called Roberts, sharply. "The fellow behind you's
      been hit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom peered around. Ory Tacks lay with face down. His fat
      body was quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ory! Ory! Are you hit?" flashed Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should smile," he groaned, lifting a pale face. His old
      slouch hat was still in place and a tuft of tow-colored
      hair stuck out through a hole. "Never mind--me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roberts, come help me," called Tom, and began to back down
      toward Ory. Roberts did likewise, and they both reached the
      young man about the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much obliged to see you," said Ory, gratefully, as they
      took hold of his arms, one on each side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to that moment Tom had been mostly stultified by emotion
      utterly new to him. It had been close to panic, for he had
      found himself hard put to it to keep from leaping up to
      run. But something in connection with Ory's misfortune
      strung Tom suddenly and acutely to another mood. Grim
      realization and anger drove away his fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drag him; he cain't help himself," panted Roberts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then began what Tom felt to be the most heart-breaking
      labor imaginable. They had to crawl and drag the wounded
      Ory up hill. Tom locked his left arm under Ory's, and
      dragging his rifle in his right hand he jerked and hunched
      himself along. Bullets now began to whistle and patter from
      the other side, signifying that the Comanches to the right
      had located the crawling hunters. Suddenly above Tom boomed
      a heavy Creedmoor--then two booms followed in succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!--It was--aboot time," panted Roberts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom felt the coldness leave his marrow for good. It was
      fight now. Pilchuck, Bear Claws, the Mexican, and some of
      the old plainsmen had reached the top of the slope and had
      opened on the Comanches. This spurred him, if not to
      greater effort, which was impossible, at least to dogged
      and unquenchable endurance. Roberts whistled through his
      nose; his lean face was bathed with sweat. Ory Tacks
      struggled bravely to help himself along, though it was
      plain his agony was tremendous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slope grew less steep and more thickly strewn with
      large rocks. Tom heard no more bullets whiz up from
      direction of the encampment. They came from both sides, and
      the reports of Winchesters, sharp and rattling above the
      Creedmoors, covered a wide half circle. Farther away the
      guns of the Starwell and Harkaway forces rang out steadily,
      if not often. It had become a hot battle and the men were
      no longer shooting at puffs of white smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a moment too soon did Tom and Roberts drag Tacks over
      the top of the slope into a zone of large bowlders from
      behind which Pilchuck and his men were fighting. For almost
      at the last instant Tom heard a dull spat of lead striking
      flesh. Roberts' left arm, on which he was hunching himself
      along, crumpled under him, and he dropped flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They--busted--me," he declared, huskily, then let go of
      Tacks, and floundered behind a rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom by superhuman exertion dragged Ory farther on, behind a
      long low ledge, from which a hunter was shooting. Then Tom
      collapsed. But as he sank flat he heard the boy's grateful,
      "Much obliged, Tom." For a few moments then Tom was deaf
      and blind to the battle. There was a bursting riot within
      his breast, an overtaxed heart fluttering to recover. It
      seemed long that he lay prostrate, utterly unable to lift
      face or hand. But gradually that passed. Pilchuck crawled
      close, smelling of sweat, dust, and powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, are you hurt?" he queried, shaking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--only--all in," whispered Tom, huskily, between pants.
      "We had to--drag Ory--up here. He's hit; so's Roberts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take a look at them," said the scout. "We're shore in
      better position here. Reckon we can hold the red devils
      off. Lucky Starwell an' Harkaway are behind them, on both
      sides. We're in for a siege. . . . Bullets flyin' from east
      an' west. Peep out mighty careful an' look for an Indian.
      Don't shoot at smoke."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom crawled a little to the left and cautiously took up a
      position where he could peer from behind the long flat
      rock. He could see nothing move. An uneven field of
      bowlders, large and small, stretched away, with narrow
      aisles of gray grass and ground between. The firing had
      diminished greatly. Both sides were conserving ammunition.
      Not for several moments did Tom espy a puff of white smoke,
      and that came from a heavy Creedmoor, four hundred yards or
      more away, from a point above where Starwell's men had
      guarded the gateway of the canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile as he watched for something to shoot at he could
      hear Pilchuck working over the wounded men, and ascertained
      that Roberts had been shot through the arm, not, however,
      to break the bones, and Ory Tacks had a broken hip. Tom
      realized the gravity of such a wound, out there in the
      wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd be much obliged for a drink of water," was all Tom
      heard Ory say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck crawled away and did not return. Ory Tacks and
      Roberts lay at the base of the low ledge, out of range of
      bullets for the present. But they lay in the sun and
      already the sun was hot. The scout had chosen a small oval
      space irregularly surrounded by bowlders and outcroppings
      of rough ledges. By twisting his head Tom could espy eight
      or ten of Pilchuck's force, some facing east behind their
      fortifications, others west. Tom heard both profanity and
      loquacious humor. The Mexican and the Osage were not in
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tom peeped out from behind his own covert. This time
      his quick eye caught a glimpse of something moving, like a
      rabbit slipping into brush. Above that place then slid out
      a red streak and a thin blue-white cloud of smoke. Sputt! A
      bullet hit the corner of his rock and whined away. Tom
      dodged back, suddenly aghast, and hot with anger. A
      sharp-eyed Indian had seen him. Tom wormed his way around
      back of the long rock to the other end. Behind the next
      rock lay the old white-haired hunter, bare-headed, with
      sweat and tobacco stains upon his grizzled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take it easy an' slow," he advised Tom, complacently.
      "Comanches can't stand a long fight. They're riders, an'
      all we need is patience. On the ground we can lick hell out
      of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old plainsman's nonchalance was incredible, yet vastly
      helpful to Tom. He put a hard curb on his impetuosity, and
      forced himself to wait and think carefully of every action
      before he undertook it. Therefore he found a position where
      he could command a certain limited field of rocks without
      risk to himself. It was like peeping through a knot hole
      too small for any enemy to see at a distance. From this
      vantage point Tom caught fleeting glimpses and flashes of
      color, gray and bronze, once a speck of red. But these
      vanished before he could bring his rifle into play.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you see suthin' move shoot quick as lightnin'," said
      the old plainsman. "It might be a gopher or a cottontail,
      but take no chances. It's likely to be a two-legged
      varmint."
    </p>
    <p>
      Intense concentration, and a spirit evolving from the hour,
      enabled Tom to make considerable progress toward the
      plainsman's idea of fighting Comanches. Tom fired again and
      again, at the flit of a bird across a narrow space, at the
      flash of gun, a gleam of a feather. But he could never see
      whether or not he hit an Indian. Strange to note, however,
      was the fact that these fleeting movements of something
      were never repeated in the same place. Concentration
      brought to Tom the certainty that he was seeing a faint
      glimpse now and then of these elusive Comanches. This, with
      the crack of Winchesters and hum of bullets, in time bred
      in him some semblance of the spirit of the old plainsman.
      It was indeed a fight. He had his part to perform. Life was
      here, and an inch away sped death. Grim, terrible, but
      exalting, and strangely memorable of a vague past! Tom Doan
      realized the inheritance he had in common with men, white
      or red.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours passed swiftly for the fighters. Another wounded
      man joined Roberts and Ory Tacks, and the ordeal must have
      been frightful for them. Tom forgot them; so did all the
      defenders of that position. The glaring sun poured down its
      heat. Stones and guns were so hot they burned. No breeze
      stirred. And the fight went on, favorable for the
      buffalo-hunters because of their fortifications,
      unfavorable in regard to time. They were all parching for
      thirst. By chance or blunder the canteens had been left on
      the saddles and water had come to be almost as precious as
      powder. The old plainsman cursed the Staked Plain. Tom's
      mouth appeared full of cotton paste. He had kept pebbles in
      his mouth till he was sick of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noon went by. Afternoon came. The sun, hotter than ever,
      began to slope to the west. And the fight went on,
      narrowing down as to distance, intensifying as to spirit,
      magnifying peril to both sides. The Creedmoors from the
      Starwell and Harkaway forces kept up the bulk of the
      shooting. They were directing most of their fire down into
      the encampment, no doubt to keep the Comanches there from
      joining their comrades on the slope. Mustangs showed on the
      farther points, and evidently had strayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Pilchuck came crawling on hands and knees,
      without his rifle or coat. A bloody patch showed on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, reckon I got punctured a little," he said. "It ain't
      bad, but it's bleedin' like hell. Tear my shirt sleeve off
      an' tie it round under my arm over my shoulder tight."
    </p>
    <p>
      An ugly bullet hole showed angrily in the upper part of the
      scout's shoulder, apparently just through the flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Notice that bullet come from behind," said Pilchuck.
      "There shore was a mean redskin on your side. He hit two of
      us before I plugged him. There--good. . . . Now how's the
      rest of your hospital?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. Afraid I forgot," replied Tom, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, I'll see."
    </p>
    <p>
      He crawled over to the wounded man and spoke. Tom heard
      Roberts answer, but Ory Tacks was silent. That disturbed
      Tom. Then the scout came back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roberts 's sufferin' some, but he's O. K. The young
      fellar, though, is dyin', I'm afraid. Shot in the groin.
      Mebbe--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pilchuck! . . . Ory didn't seem bad hurt--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, he is, an' if we don't get some water he'll go,"
      declared the scout, emphatically. "Fact is, we're all bad
      off for water. It's shore hot. What a dumbhead I was to
      forget the canteens!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go after them," returned Tom, like a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not a bad idee," said Pilchuck, after a moment's
      reflection. "Reckon it'd be no riskier than stayin' here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Direct me. Where'd you leave the horses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The scout faced south, at right angles with the cross-fire
      from the Comanches, and presently extended his long arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See that low bluff--not far--the last one reachin' down
      into this basin. It's behind there. You can't miss it.
      Lucky the rocks from here on are thick as cabbages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can make it," declared Tom, doggedly. "But to get back!
      That stumps me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Easy. You've got to go slow, pickin' the best cover. Just
      lay a line of little stones as you crawl along. Reckon the
      Comanches are all on these two sides of us, but there
      <i>might</i> be some tryin' to surround us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything more?" queried Tom, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scout apparently had no thought of the tremendousness
      of this enterprise to Tom. It was as if he had naturally
      expected of Tom what he would do himself if he had not been
      partially incapacitated. Tom realized he had never in his
      life received such a compliment. It swelled his heart. He
      felt light, hard, tense, vibrating to a strange excitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, I can't think of anythin'," replied the scout.
      "Comin' back be slower'n molasses, an' get the drift of the
      fight. We're holdin' these redskins off. But I reckon
      Starwell an' Harkaway have been doin' more. If I don't miss
      my guess they've spilled blood down in the canyon.
      Comanches are great on horseback, but they can't stick out
      a fight like this. If they rush us we're goners. If they
      don't they'll quit before sunset."
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>
      <a name="c13" id="c13">CHAPTER XIII</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Milly Fayre rode out of Sprague's Post on the front of a
      freighter's wagon, sitting between Jett and his wife. The
      rest of Jett's outfit followed close behind, Follonsbee and
      Pruitt in the second wagon, and Catlee driving the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      For as long as Milly could see the Hudnalls she waved her
      red scarf in farewell. Then when her friends passed out of
      sight Milly turned slowly to face the boundless prairie,
      barren of life, suddenly fearful in its meaning, and she
      sank down, stricken in heart. What she had dreaded was now
      an actuality. The courage that had inspired her when she
      wrote the letter to Tom Doan, leaving it with Mrs. Hudnall,
      was a courage inspired by love, not by hope. So it seemed
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milly, you ain't actin' much like a boy, spite them boy's
      clothes," said Jett, with attempt at levity. "Pile over in
      the back of the wagon an' lay down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kindness from Jett was astounding, and was gratefully
      received by Milly. Doing as she was bidden, she found a
      comfortable place on the unrolled packs of bedding, with
      her head in a shade of the wagon seat. It developed then
      that Jett's apparent kindness had been only a ruse to get
      her away so he could converse with his wife in low, earnest
      tones. Milly might have heard all or part of that
      conversation, but she was not interested and did not
      listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dejectedly she lay there while the steady trot of the
      horses carried her back toward the distant buffalo range.
      To be torn from her kind and loving friends at the post and
      drawn back into the raw hard life led by her stepfather was
      a bitter and sickening blow. Her sufferings were acute; and
      as she had become used to hope and happiness she was now
      ill fitted to cope with misery and dread. She did not think
      of the future or plan to meet it; she lived in the present
      and felt the encroaching of an old morbid and fatalistic
      mood, long a stranger to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours passed, and Jett's deep, low voice appeared never
      to rest or cease. He did not make a noon stop, as was
      customary among the buffalo-hunters. And he drove until
      sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forty miles, bedam!" he said, with satisfaction, as he
      threw the reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Milly would have it so or not, she dropped at once
      back into the old camp life, with its tasks. How well she
      remembered! The smoke of the camp fire made her eyes smart
      and brought tingling as well as hateful memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other wagons drove up rather late, and once more Milly
      found herself under the hawk eyes of Follonsbee and the
      half-veiled hidden look of the crooked-faced Pruitt. Her
      masculine garb, emphasizing her shapely slenderness,
      manifestly drew the gaze of these men. They seemed
      fascinated by it, as if they both had discovered something.
      Neither of them spoke to her. Catlee, however, gave her a
      kindly nod. He seemed more plodding in mind than she
      remembered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the old associations returned to her, and
      presently her fleeting happiness with the Hudnalls had the
      remoteness and unreality of a dream and she was again
      Jett's stepdaughter, quick to start at his harsh voice. Was
      that harshness the same? She seemed to have a vague
      impression of a difference in his voice, in him, in all of
      his outfit, in the atmosphere around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stopping place had been chosen at one of the stream
      crossings where hundreds of buffalo-hunters had camped that
      year, a fact Jett growled about, complaining of the lack of
      grass and wood. Water was plentiful, and it was cold, a
      welcome circumstance to the travelers. Jett had an
      inordinate thirst, probably owing to his addiction to rum
      at Sprague's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fetch some more drinkin' water," he ordered Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the pail and went down the bank under the big,
      rustling, green cottonwoods. Catlee was at the stream,
      watering the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I seen you comin', an' I says who's that boy?" he said,
      with a grin. "I forgot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forgot, too," she replied, dubiously. "I don't like
      these--these pants. But I've made a discovery, Catlee. I'm
      more comfortable round camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't wonder. You used to drag your skirts round. . . .
      Gimme your bucket. I'll fill it where the water's clear."
    </p>
    <p>
      He waded in beyond where the horses were drinking and
      dipped the pail. "Nothin' like good cold water after a
      day's hot ride."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jett drank nearly all I got before and sent me for more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's burnin' up inside with red liquor," returned Catlee,
      bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly did not have any reply to make to that, but she
      thanked Catlee, and taking the pail she poured out a little
      water, so she would not spill it as she walked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milly, I'm sorry you had to come back with Jett," said
      Catlee.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, turning to look at him, surprised at his tone.
      His bronze face lacked the heat, the dissolute shades
      common to Jett and the other men. Milly remembered then
      that Catlee in her opinion had not seemed like the rest of
      Jett's outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry? Why?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know Sprague. He's from Missouri. He told me about you,
      an' your friend Tom Doan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sprague told you--about--about Tom!" faltered Milly,
      suddenly blushing. "Why, who told him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Hudnall, he said. Sprague took interest in you, it
      'pears. An' his wife is thick with the Hudnall women.
      Anyway, he was sorry Jett took you away--an' so'm I."
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly's confusion and pain at the mention of Tom did not
      quite render her blind to this man's sympathy. She forced
      away the wave of emotion. Her mind quickened to the
      actuality of her being once more in Jett's power and that
      she had only her wits and courage to rely upon. This
      hard-faced, apparently dull and somber man might befriend
      her. Milly suddenly conceived the inspiration to win him to
      her cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So am I sorry, Catlee," she said sadly, and her quick
      tears were genuine. Indeed, they had started to flow at
      mention of Tom's name. "I--I'm engaged to Tom Doan. . . . I
      was--so--so happy. And I'd never had--any happy times
      before. . . . Now I've been dragged away. Jett's my
      stepfather. I'm not of age. I had to come. . . . And I'm
      terribly afraid of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon," rejoined Catlee, darkly, "you've reason to be.
      He an' the woman quarreled at Sprague's. He wanted to leave
      her behind. For that matter, the four of them drank a good
      deal, an' fought over the hide money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For pity's sake, be my friend!" appealed Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stared at her, as if uncomprehending, yet somehow
      stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Catlee," she said, seeing her advantage and stepping back
      to lay a hand softly on his arm, "did you ever have a
      sister or a sweetheart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon not or I'd been another kind of man," he
      returned, with something of pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you're not bad," she went on, swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me not bad! Child, you're crazy! I never was anythin'
      else. An' now I'm a hide thief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's true, then? Jett is a hide thief. I knew
      something was terribly wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Girl, don't you tell Jett I said that," replied Catlee,
      almost harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I won't. I promise. You can trust me," she returned,
      hurriedly. "And I could trust you. I don't think you're
      really bad. Jett has led you into this. He's bad. I hate
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Jett's bad all right, an' he means bad by you. I
      reckon I thought you knowed an' didn't care."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Care! If he harms me I'll kill him and myself," she
      whispered, passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man seemed to be confronted with something new in his
      experience, and it was dissipating a dull apathy to all
      that concerned others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that's how a good girl feels!" he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. And I ask you--beg you to be a man--a friend--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There comes Pruitt," interrupted Catlee, turning to his
      horses. "Don't let him or any of them see you talkin' to
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly bent over the heavy bucket and, avoiding the dust
      raised by Pruitt with his horses, she hurried back to camp.
      Her return manifestly checked hard words between Jett and
      his wife. Milly took up her tasks where they had been
      interrupted, but with this difference, that she had become
      alive to the situation among these hide thieves. Jett's
      status had been defined, and the woman was no doubt
      culpable with him. Catlee's blunt corroboration of Milly's
      fears had awakened her spirit; and the possibility of
      winning this hardened man to help her in her extremity had
      inspired courage and resolve. All in a flash, then, it
      seemed she was the girl who had written that brave letter
      to Tom Doan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper was cooked and eaten. The men, except Catlee, were
      not hungry as usual, and appeared to be wearing off the
      effects of hard drinking. They spoke but seldom, and then
      only to ask for something out of reach on the spread
      canvas. Darkness settled down while Milly dried the pans
      and cups. Catlee came up with a huge armload of wood, which
      he dropped with a crash, a little too near Pruitt to suit
      his irascible mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, you Missouri hay seed, can't you see my feet?" he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could if I'd looked. They're big enough," retorted
      Catlee. "I ain't wonderin' you have such a care of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ain't you? Shore I'd like to know why?" queried Pruitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon what little brains you've got are in them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You damn Yank!" ejaculated the little rebel, as amazed as
      enraged. "I've shot men for less'n thet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon you have," rejoined Catlee with slow, cool sarcasm.
      "But in the back! . . . An' I'm lookin' at you."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not the slightest doubt of Catlee's emergence
      from the character of a stolid dull teamster into something
      incalculably otherwise. Jett rolled out his loud, harsh
      laughter. It amused him, this revolt of the stupid farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise it showed his subtle change. Was there reason for
      him to invite antagonism among his men? Assuredly there was
      strong antagonism toward him. Follonsbee gazed in genuine
      amaze at Catlee, and slowly nodded his lean buzzard-like
      head, as if he had before in his life seen queer things in
      men. As for the fiery little rebel, he was instantly
      transformed, in his attitude toward Catlee, from a man who
      had felt a raw irritation, to one who hated and who
      doubted. However Follonsbee read the erstwhile Missouri
      farmer, Pruitt got only so far as a cold and waking doubt.
      Enmity was thus established and it seemed to be Pruitt's
      natural mental attitude, and to suit Catlee better than
      friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly heard and saw this byplay from the shadow beyond the
      camp-fire circle. If that were Catlee's answer to her
      appeal, it was a change, sudden and bewildering. The thrill
      she sustained was more like a shudder. In that moment she
      sensed a far-reaching influence, a something which had to
      do with future events. Catlee stalked off into the gloom of
      the cottonwood, where he had made his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rand, are you sure thet feller is what you said he was--a
      Missouri farm hand, tired of workin' for nothin'?" demanded
      Follonsbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hank, I ain't sure of anythin' an' I don't give a whoop,"
      replied the leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thet's natural, for you," said the other, with sarcasm.
      "You don't know the West as I know it. Catlee struck me
      queer. . . . When he called Pruitt, so cool-like, I had
      come to mind men of the Cole Younger stripe. If so--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, it's nothin'," cut in Pruitt. "Jett spoke my
      sentiments aboot our Yankee pard. It r'ils me to think of
      him gettin' a share of our hide money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett coughed, an unusual thing for him to do. "Who said
      Catlee got a share?" he queried, gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Follonsbee lifted his lean head to peer at the leader.
      Pruitt, who was sitting back to a stump, his distorted face
      gleaming red in the camp-fire light, moved slowly forward
      to gaze in turn. Both men were silent; both of them
      questioned with their whole bodies. But Jett had no answer.
      He calmly lit his pipe and flipped the match into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore, now I tax myself, I cain't remember thet anybody
      said Catlee got a share," replied Pruitt, with
      deliberation. "But I thought he did. An' I know Hank
      thought so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd have gambled on it," said Follonsbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Catlee gets wages, that's all," asserted the leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahuh! . . . An' who gets <i>his</i> share of the hide
      money?" demanded Pruitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," rejoined Jett, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jett, I'm tellin' you that's in line with your holdin' out
      money for supplies at Sprague," said Follonsbee, earnestly.
      "You was to furnish outfit, grub, everythin', an' share
      even with all of us, includin' your woman. You got your
      share, an' her share, an' now Catlee's share."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm willin' to argue it with you, but not on an equal
      divvy basis."
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed a long silence. The men smoked. The fire
      burned down, so that their faces were but pale gleams.
      Milly sought her bed, which she had made in the wagon. Jett
      had sacrificed tents to make room for equal weight of
      buffalo hides. He had unrolled his blankets under the
      wagon, where the sullen woman had repaired soon after dark.
      Milly took off her boy's shoes and folded the coat for a
      pillow, then slipping under the blankets she stretched out,
      glad for the relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      How different, lying out under the open starry sky! She
      liked it. The immense blue dome was alight, mysterious,
      beautiful, comforting. Milly said her short prayer,
      childish and loyal, somehow more than ever helpful on this
      eventful night. Often, before she had met the Hudnalls and
      Tom Doan, she had omitted that little prayer, but never
      since she had learned from them the meaning of friendship
      and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was warm; the leaves of the cottonwoods near by
      rustled softly in the breeze; insects were chirping and a
      night bird was uttering plaintive notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett, Follonsbee, and Pruitt remained around the camp fire,
      quarreling in low voices; and that sound was the last Milly
      heard as slumber claimed her.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Milly's eyes opened to the bright light of day, and
      pale-blue sky seemed canopied over her. Not the canvas roof
      of her tent! Where was she? The smell of cottonwood smoke
      brought her with surging shock to realization. Then Jett's
      harsh voice, that had always made her shrink with fear,
      sent a creeping fire along her veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay a moment longer, calling to the spirit that had
      awakened last night; and it augmented while she seemed to
      grow strangely older. She would endure; she would fight;
      she would think. So that when she presented herself at the
      camp fire she was outwardly a quiet, obedient, impassive
      girl, inwardly a cunning, daring woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not half a dozen words were spoken around the breakfast
      canvas. Jett rushed the tasks. Sunrise shone on the three
      wagons moving south at a brisk trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly had asked Catlee to fix her a comfortable place in
      the back of Jett's wagon. He had done so, adding of his own
      accord an improvised sun shade of canvas. She had watched
      him from the wagon seat, hoping he would speak to her or
      look at her in a way that would confirm her hopes. But the
      teamster was silent and kept his head lowered.
      Nevertheless, Milly did not regard his taciturnity as
      unfavorable to her. There had been about Catlee, last night
      when he had muttered: "So that's how a good girl feels," a
      something which spoke to Milly's intuition. She could not
      prove anything. But she felt. This man would befriend her.
      A subtle unconscious influence was working on his mind. It
      was her presence, her plight, her appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly thought of a thousand plans to escape, to get word to
      Doan, to acquaint buffalo-hunters with the fact of her
      being practically a prisoner, to betray that Jett was a
      hide thief. Nothing definitely clear and satisfactory
      occurred to her. But the fact of her new knowledge of Jett
      stood out tremendously. It was an infallible weapon to
      employ, if the right opportunity presented. But a futile
      attempt at that would result fatally for her. Jett would
      most surely kill her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Milly as she revolved in mind plan after plan
      that the wisest thing to do would be to play submissive
      slave to Jett until he reached the end of the drive south;
      and there to persuade Catlee to take her at once to
      Hudnall's camp, where she would betray Jett. If Catlee
      would not help her, then she must go alone, or, failing
      that, wait for Tom Doan to find her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the morning was far advanced Jett gave wide berth to
      an oncoming outfit. Milly was not aware of this until the
      unusual jolting caused her to rise to her knees and look
      out. Jett had driven off the main road, taking a low place,
      where other drivers had made short cuts. Four freight
      wagons, heavily laden with hides, were passing at some
      distance to the right. The foremost team of horses was
      white--Milly thought she recognized it as Hudnall's. Her
      heart rushed to her lips. But she had seen many white
      teams, and all of them had affected her that way. If she
      leaped out and ran to find she was mistaken, she would lose
      every chance she had. Besides, as she gazed, she imagined
      she was wrong. So with a deep sigh she dropped back to her
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours passed quickly. Milly pondered until she was
      weary, then fell asleep, and did not awaken until another
      camp was reached. And the first words she heard were Jett's
      speaking to Follonsbee as he drove up abreast the leader,
      "Wasn't that Hudnall's outfit we passed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "First two teams was," replied Follonsbee. "That young
      skinner of Hudnall's was leadin', an' that ugly-face cuss
      was drivin' the second team. I didn't know the other
      outfits."
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly had to bite her lips to repress a scream. Jett was
      clamboring down from the seat above. The woman, grumbling
      under her breath, threw out the canvas bags of utensils,
      that clinked on the ground. Milly hid her face as Mrs. Jett
      descended from the seat. Then, for a moment, she shook like
      a leaf with the violence of her emotions. So near Tom! Not
      to see his face! It was heartrending. She lay prostrate,
      with her mind in a whirl. Of the many thoughts one
      returned--that Tom would reach Sprague's Post next day and
      get her letter. That thought had strength to impart. He
      would lose no time following, perhaps would catch up with
      Jett before he got to the Pease River, and if not then,
      soon afterward. This thought sustained her in a trying
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weakness passed, leaving her somewhat thick witted, so
      that as she climbed out of the wagon she nearly fell, and
      later her clumsiness at her assigned camp tasks fetched a
      reprimand from Mrs. Jett. Soon the men were back from
      attending to the horses, and this evening they were hungry.
      Meeting outcoming freighters with buffalo hides had for the
      moment turned the minds of Jett and his two lieutenants
      from their differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many hides in them outfits?" queried Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It weren't a big haul," replied Follonsbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore was big enough to make us turn off the road," said
      Pruitt, meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett glared at him. Then Catlee drawled: "Funny they didn't
      see us. But we went down on our side some. That first
      driver was Hudnall's man, Tom Doan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahuh! Well, suppose it was?" returned Jett, nonplussed at
      this remark from the habitually unobserving Catlee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothin'. I just recognized him," replied Catlee, casually,
      as he lowered his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he raised them, a moment later, to look across the
      canvas supper cloth at Milly, she saw them as never before,
      sharp as a dagger, with a single bright gleam. He wanted
      her to know that he had seen Tom Doan. Milly dropped her
      own gaze and she spilled a little of her coffee. She dared
      not trust her flashing interpretation of this man's glance.
      It seemed like a gleam of lightning from what had hitherto
      been dead ashes. Thereafter he paid no attention to her,
      nor to any of the others; and upon finishing the meal and
      finishing his chore of cutting firewood, he vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett and his two disgruntled men took up their quarrel and
      spent a long, noisy, angry hour round the camp fire.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The next day came and passed, with no difference for Milly
      except that Catlee now avoided her, never seemed to notice
      her; and that she hung out her red scarf, with a hopeful
      thrill in its significance. Then one by one the days rolled
      by, under the wheels of the wagons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven days, and then the straggling lost bands of buffalo!
      The hot, drowsy summer air was tainted; the gently waving
      prairie bore heaps of bones; skulking coyotes sneaked back
      from the road. A thousand times Milly Fayre looked back
      down the endless road she had traveled. No wagon came in
      sight!
    </p>
    <p>
      Noon of the ninth day brought Jett within sight of the
      prairie-wide herd of buffalo. He halted to point it out to
      his sullen, unseeing men; and later he reined in again,
      this time to turn his ear to the hot stinking wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha! Listen," he called back to Follonsbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly heard the boom-boom-boom-boom of guns, near and far,
      incessant and potent. Strangely, for once she was glad to
      hear them!
    </p>
    <p>
      All that hot midday she reclined on the improvised seat in
      her wagon, holding her scarf to her nostrils and looking
      out occasionally at the sordid ugliness of abandoned camp
      sites. The buffalo-hunters had moved on up the river, that
      now showed its wandering line of green timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly took a last backward gaze down the prairie road just
      as Jett turned off to go into the woods. Far away Milly saw
      a dot on the horizon--a white and black dot. Maybe it was
      Tom Doan's horses and wagon! He could not be far behind. It
      was as well now, perhaps, that he had not caught up with
      Jett. The buffalo range had been reached; and it could not
      be long before her situation was changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett drove off the prairie, into the timber, along a
      well-defined shady road where many camps had been pitched,
      and then down into the brakes. Brutal and fearless driver
      that he was, he urged his horses right through the tangled
      undergrowth, that bent with the onslaught of the wagon, to
      spring back erect after it had passed. Follonsbee came
      crashing next. Jett drove down into the bottom lands, thick
      and hot and aromatic with its jungle of foliage. He must
      have had either wonderful judgment as to where it was
      possible for horses to go, or an uncanny luck. For he
      penetrated the heavily wooded brakes clear to a deep
      shining river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly would not allow herself to be unduly distressed
      because Jett meant to hide his camp, for she knew that any
      one hunting wagon tracks and camps would surely not miss
      his. In a way Milly was glad of the shade, the murmur of
      the river, the songs of birds, the absence of the stench. A
      camp on the edge of the prairie, with the rotten carcasses
      of buffalo close at hand, the dust and heat, the flies and
      bugs, would be well-nigh unendurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett halted his team in a shady glade of cottonwoods just
      back from the river and Milly then discovered that this was
      the scene of Jett's previous encampment. His tents and
      fireplace, boxes and bales, evidently had not been molested
      during his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turn horses loose an' unload the wagons," he ordered his
      men. "I'll take a look for my saddle horses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No fear of hosses leavin' grass an' water," rejoined
      Follonsbee. "But there might be hoss thieves on the range."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haw! Haw!" laughed Pruitt, in his mean way. "Shore you
      know these heah buff-hunters are all honest men."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett strode off into the green brakes. The men unloaded the
      wagons and set the boxes and bags of supplies under a
      cottonwood. Mrs. Jett opened a tent near the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss," said Catlee, "the canvas wagon cover you had before
      got ripped to pieces. There ain't any tent for you till
      that one's mended."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't I stay in the wagon?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't see why not. We'll hardly be movin' or haulin' very
      soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the afternoon when the rays of the sun began
      to lose heat. Milly was sorely in need of a little freedom
      of limbs. She had been cramped and inactive so long. So she
      walked to and fro under the trees. This camp was the most
      secluded Jett had ever chosen--far from the prairie, down
      in the brakes at the edge of the river, hidden by trees
      from the opposite densely foliaged bank. If it had not
      hinted of a sinister meaning and was not indeed a prison
      for Milly she could have reveled in it. If she had to spend
      much time there she would be grateful for its quiet,
      cleanliness, and beauty. She strolled along the green bank
      until Mrs. Jett curtly called her to help get supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the time it was ready Jett returned, with muddy boots
      and clothes covered with burrs and bits of brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Found all the horses except the bay mare," he announced.
      "An' to-morrow we can go back to work. I'm aimin' at hard
      work, men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh! I'd like to know what you call all we've done,"
      returned Follonsbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, Jett, there shore won't be <i>any</i> work aboot heah
      till you settle up," added Pruitt, crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett's huge frame jerked with the shock of surprise and
      fury he must have felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that's it?" he queried, thickly. "Waited till you got
      way down here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shore did, boss," returned Pruitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In sullen silence then Jett began and finished his supper.
      Plain it was he had received a hard, unexpected blow, that
      he seemed scarcely prepared to cope with. He had no further
      words with his men, but he drew his wife aside; and they
      were in earnest conversation when Milly fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day brought forward a situation Milly had not
      calculated upon. Jett had no intercourse whatever with his
      men, and saddling his horse rode off alone. The woman
      sulked. Follonsbee and Pruitt, manifestly satisfied with
      their stand, played cards interminably, now and then
      halting to talk in low tones over something vital to them.
      Catlee rigged himself a crude fishing tackle and repaired
      to the river bank, where he found a shady seat within sight
      of the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly was left to herself. Her first act, after the tasks
      of the morning were ended, was to hang up her red scarf in
      a conspicuous place. Then she had nothing to do but kill
      time. With the men in camp, this was not easy. Apparently
      she had liberty. No orders had been given her, but perhaps
      this was owing to the timid meekness she had pretended. She
      might have wandered away into the brakes or have trailed
      the wagon tracks up to the prairie. But she could not
      decide that this was best. For the present she could only
      wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the boom of guns floated in on the summer air from
      all sides, increasing for a while, until along the upriver
      prairie there was almost continuous detonation. Every boom,
      perhaps, meant the heart or lungs of a noble animal torn to
      shreds for the sake of his hide. As Milly settled down
      again to the actual presence of this slaughter she accepted
      the fact with melancholy resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of her strolling round the camp Milly
      gravitated toward Catlee, where he sat contentedly smoking
      his pipe and fishing. She watched him, trying to make up
      her mind to approach him on the subject nearest her heart.
      But she knew the men and Mrs. Jett could see her and that
      any such action might arouse suspicion. Therefore she
      desisted. Once Catlee turned, apparently casually, and his
      gray gaze took her in and the camp. Then he winked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That droll action established anew Milly's faith in an
      understanding between her and this man. She had no
      assurance that he would help her, but there was a secret
      between them. Milly felt more than she could prove. The
      incident made the long day supportable.

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Jett's outfit fell into idleness for more days than Milly
      could remember. She waited for time to pass, and no one
      would have suspected her longing. When Jett returned to
      camp from one of his lonely rides Milly would hear his
      horse breaking the brush along the trail, and she could
      never repress a wild throb of hope. It might be Tom! But it
      was always Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Jett returned in great perturbation, apparently
      exhausted. His horse was jaded. Follonsbee and Pruitt were
      curious, to no end, for Jett did not vouchsafe any
      explanation. Whatever had happened, however, brought about
      a change in him and his habits. He stayed in camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business of hide-hunting had been abandoned; not
      improbably in Jett's mind for a temporary period, until his
      men weakened. But they did not weaken; they grew stronger.
      More days of this enforced idleness crystallized a growing
      influence--they would never again follow the extraordinary
      labors of hunting and skinning buffalo. Whatever had been
      Jett's unity of outfit was destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly heard the woman tell Jett this, and the ensuing scene
      had been violent. It marked, further, the revealment of
      Mrs. Jett's long-hidden hand in the game. She was the
      mainspring of Jett's calculated mechanism, and when the
      other men realized it, it precipitated something darkly
      somber into the situation. Follonsbee and Pruitt had
      manifestly been playing a hand they felt sure would win.
      Jett could no longer hunt hides, or steal them, either,
      without his men. All of these lonely rides of his had been
      taken to find other accomplices, whom Follonsbee and Pruitt
      knew could not be obtained there on the buffalo range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly heard the bitter quarrel which ensued, between Jett
      and his wife and the two lieutenants. Catlee was always
      there, listening, watching, but took no part in any of
      their talks or quarrels. He was outside. They did not count
      him at all. Yet he should have been counted immeasurably,
      Milly concluded. Like herself, Catlee was an intense,
      though silent, participator in this drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      The content of that quarrel was simple. Jett had weakened
      to the extent of wanting to settle in part with his men.
      Follonsbee and Pruitt were not willing to take what he
      offered, and the woman, most tenacious and calculating of
      all of them, refused to allow Jett to relinquish any share
      of their profits.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a deadlock, and the argument put aside for the
      present. Follonsbee and Pruitt walked away from camp; Jett
      and his wife repaired to their tent where they conversed
      heatedly; Catlee and Milly cooked the supper. Milly did not
      know when the absent men returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day the atmosphere of Jett's outfit had undergone
      further change. The leader was a worried and tormented man,
      beset by a woman with will of steel and heart of hate; and
      he saw opposed to him Westerners whose reaction now seemed
      formidable and deadly. That had roused an immovable
      stubbornness in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly saw the disintegration of this group, and what she
      could not divine herself she gathered from study of Catlee.
      Indeed, he was the most remarkable of the outfit--he whom
      the others never considered at all. Not that Milly could
      understand her impressions! If she tried to analyze
      Catlee's effect upon her it only led to doubt. As for Jett
      and his men, they were a divided outfit, wearing toward
      dissolution, answering to the wildness of the time and
      place. The evil that they had done hovered over them, about
      to enact retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly began to dread the issue, though the breaking up of
      this outfit augured well for her. Then any day Tom Doan,
      with Hudnall and his men, might ride into Jett's camp. That
      meant deliverance for her, in one way or another. If Jett
      refused to let her go she had but to betray him. Milly held
      her courage all through this long ordeal, yet she felt more
      and more the looming of a shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the close of that afternoon the tension relaxed.
      Follonsbee and Pruitt sauntered off with their heads
      together; Jett fell asleep under a cottonwood and his
      sullen wife slouched into her tent; Catlee sat on a log by
      the river bank, not fishing or smoking, but deep in
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly, answering the long-resisted impulse, slipped to his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Catlee, I must tell you," she whispered. "This--all this
      I've gone through has got on my nerves. I've waited and
      hoped and prayed for Tom Doan. . . . He doesn't come. He
      has missed this road. I might have stood it longer, but
      this fight between the Jetts and his men wears on me. I'm
      scared. Something awful will happen. I can't stand it. . .
      . I know you're my friend--oh, I know it! . . . But you
      must help me. Tell me what you think. Tell me what to do.
      It's all so wild--so strange. . . . That awful woman! She
      eyes me so--as if she guessed what the men are not thinking
      of <i>now,</i> but would be soon. . . . Catlee, you're
      no--no--you're not like these people. But whatever you
      were--or are--remember your mother and save me
      before--before--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly's voice failed her. Liberating her fears and hopes
      had spent her force in expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lass, have you said all you want to?" queried Catlee, in
      tense undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--yes--I could only repeat," faltered Milly, but she
      held out trembling hands to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man's face underwent a change not on the surface. It
      seemed light, agitation, transpiring beneath a mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't go out of my sight!" he said, with ringing sharpness
      that made her gasp. Then he turned away, imperturbable as
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Milly had seen or heard something terrible. She backed
      away from Catlee, sensing this was what he wanted her to
      do. Yet not out of his sight! What had he meant by that? It
      signified a crisis nearer than even her fears had presaged,
      and infinitely worse. All the time he had known what was to
      happen and all this time he had been her friend. This was
      what had been on his mind as he watched and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to the wagon that was her abode, she climbed to
      the seat and sank there, with wide eyes and beating heart.
      She could see Catlee sitting like a statue, staring into
      the river. Mrs. Jett came out of her tent, with slow,
      dragging step, and a face drawn, pale, malignant. Her eyes
      were beady, the corners of her hard mouth curved down.
      Heavy, slovenly, she moved to awaken Jett with a kick of
      foot no less gentle than her mien.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come out of it, you loafer," she said. "My mind's made up.
      We'll break camp at daylight to-morrow. . . . As you ain't
      got nerve to kill these men, you can have it out with them
      to-night. But I'm keepin' the money an' we're goin'
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahuh!" ejaculated Jett, with a husky finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The habit of camp tasks was strong in her, as in all of her
      companions. Methodically she bestirred herself round the
      boxes of supplies. Catlee fetched firewood as if he had
      been ordered to do so. Follonsbee and Pruitt returned to
      squat under a cottonwood, with faces like ghouls. Jett went
      into his tent, and when he came out he was wiping his
      yellow beard. He coughed huskily, as always when drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once Milly made no move to help. No one called her. It
      was as if she had not been there. Each member of that
      outfit was clamped by his or her own thoughts. Supper was
      prepared and eaten in a silence of unnatural calm. Lull
      before the storm!
    </p>
    <p>
      Catlee brought Milly something to eat, which he tendered
      without speaking. Milly looked down into his eyes, and it
      seemed to her that she had been mistaken in the kindly
      nature of the man. As he turned away she noticed a gun in
      his belt. It was unusual for buffalo-hunters to go armed in
      such manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper Mrs. Jett left her husband to do her chores,
      and slouched toward her tent with a significant, "I'm
      packin' an' I want to get done before dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly saw Follonsbee motion for Pruitt and Catlee to draw
      aside. When they had gone, in separate directions,
      Follonsbee approached Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rand, it's the last deal an' the cards are runnin' bad,"
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahuh!" ejaculated the giant, without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your woman has stacked the deck on us," went on
      Follonsbee, without rancor. "We ain't blamin' you
      altogether for this mess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hank, I'm talked out," replied Jett, heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've been drinkin' too much," went on the other, in
      conciliatory tones, "but you're sober now an' I'm goin' to
      try once more. Will you listen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ain't deaf."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd be better off if you was. . . . Now, Rand, here's
      the straight of it, right off the shoulder. You've done us
      dirt. But square up an' all will be as before. We've got
      another chance here for a big haul--four thousand hides if
      there's one, an' easy. Use your sense. It's only this
      greedy woman who's changed you. Beat some sense into her or
      chuck her in the river. It's man to man now. An' I'm
      tellin' you, Pruitt is a dirty little rebel rattlesnake.
      He'll sting. I'm puttin' it to you honest an' level-headed.
      If this goes on another day it'll be too late. We're
      riskin' a lot here. The hunters will find out we're not
      killin' buffalo. We ought to load up an' <i>move."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're goin' to-morrow," replied Jett, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's my outfit an' I'm movin'. If you an' Pruitt want to
      stay here I'll divide supplies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're most obligin'," returned Follonsbee, sarcastically.
      "But I reckon if you divide anythin' it'll be money,
      outfit, an' all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's where the hitch comes in," snarled Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you plumb off your head, man?" queried the other, in
      weary amaze. "You just can't do anythin' else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haw! Haw!" guffawed Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      Follonsbee dropped his lean vulture face and paced to and
      fro, his hands locked behind his back. Suddenly he shouted
      for Pruitt. The little rebel came on the run.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Andy, I've talked fair to Jett, an' it ain't no use," said
      Follonsbee. "He an' the woman are breakin' camp to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Early mawnin', hey?" queried Pruitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, an' he's offered to let us stay here with half the
      supplies. I told him if he divided anythin' it'd be money,
      outfit, an' all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, what'd he say then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That here was just where the hitch come in. I told him he
      couldn't do anythin' else but divide, an' then he haw-hawed
      in my face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say. Wal, he ain't very perlite, is he? . . .
      Hank, I'm through talkin' nice to Jett. If I talk any more
      I'll shore have somethin' hard to say. Give him till
      mawnin' to think it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pruitt's sulky temper was not in evidence during this short
      interview. Milly could not see his face, but his tone and
      the poise of his head were unlike him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you fellars have a drink with me?" asked Jett, in
      grim disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked off without replying. Milly peered round.
      Catlee leaned against a tree close by, within earshot, and
      the look he cast at Jett was illuminating. Jett was new to
      the frontier, though he had answered quickly to its evil
      influence. But otherwise he had not developed. The man's
      quick decline from honest living had been the easiest way
      to satisfy a naturally greedy soul. Drink, the rough life
      of the open, had paved the way. His taking to this frontier
      woman was perhaps the worst step. And now the sordid nature
      of him lowered him beneath these thieves, who had probably
      put the evil chances in his way. But Jett did not
      understand Western men, much less desperadoes such as
      Follonsbee and Pruitt manifestly were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness settled down over the camp and the river. The
      crickets and frogs were less in evidence with their
      chirping and trilling. The camp fire had died out, and soon
      the dim light in Jett's tent was extinguished. The lonely
      night seemed to envelop Milly and strike terror to her
      soul. What was the portent of the wild mourn of the wolves?
      Yet there came a mounting intuitive, irresistible
      hope--to-morow she might be free. Somewhere within a few
      miles Tom Doan lay asleep, perhaps dreaming of her, as she
      was thinking of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly heard Catlee's stealthy tread. He had moved his bed
      near her wagon, and his presence there was significant of
      his unobtrusive guardianship. It relieved her distraught
      nerves, and soon after that her eyelids wearily closed.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Milly awoke with a start. The stars above were wan in a
      paling sky; a camp fire crackled with newly burning sticks;
      the odor of wood smoke permeated the air. The wagon in
      which she lay was shaking. Then she heard the pound of
      hoofs, the clink and rattle of harness, a low husky voice
      she recognized. Jett was hitching up.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a catch in her breath and a gush of blood along her
      veins Milly raised herself out of her bed and peered over
      the side of the wagon. The dark, heavy form of Mrs. Jett
      could be discerned in the flickering light of fire;
      contrary to her usual phlegmatic action, she was moving
      with a celerity that spoke eloquently of the nature of that
      departure. Apparently none of the others were stirring.
      Milly moved to the other side of the wagon and peered down,
      just making out Catlee's bed under the cottonwood. A dark
      form appeared against the dim background. Milly saw it
      move, and presently satisfied herself that Catlee was
      sitting on his bed, pulling on his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett's huge figure loomed up, passing the wagon. Milly
      dropped down, so she would not be seen. He spoke in the
      low, husky voice to the woman. She did not reply. Presently
      Milly heard again the soft thud of hoofs, coming closer, to
      cease just back of her wagon. Next she heard the creak and
      flop of leather. Jett was saddling the fast horses he used
      in hunting. Again Milly cautiously raised her head. She saw
      Jett in quick, sharp, decisive, yet nervous action. He
      haltered both horses to the back of the wagon, and slipped
      nose bags over their heads. The horses began to munch the
      oats in the bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment more Jett approached the wagon and lifted
      something over the footboard, just as Milly sank back into
      her bed. His quick heavy breathing denoted a laboring under
      excitement. She smelled rum on him. He disappeared, and
      soon returned to deposit another pack in the back of the
      wagon. This action he repeated several times. Next Milly
      heard him fumbling with the wire that held the water keg to
      the wagon. He tipped the keg, and the slap and gurgle of
      water told of the quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Half full," he muttered to himself. "That'll do for
      to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      His heavy footsteps moved away, and then came sound of his
      hoarse whisper to the woman. She replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon they'll show up. We'll not get away so easy, if I
      know men in this country. You'd better keep a rifle in your
      hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boh!" burst out Jett, in disgusted doubt of her, himself
      and the whole situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eat an' drink now, pronto," she said. "We won't stop to
      wash an' take these things. I packed some."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boil of the coffee pot could be heard, and then a hot
      sizzle as the water boiled over into the fire. Some one
      removed it. Again Milly peeped out the wagon side. Dawn was
      at hand. All was gray, shadowy, obscure beyond the trees,
      but near at hand it was light enough to see. Jett and the
      woman were eating. His rifle leaned against the mess box.
      They ate hurriedly, in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a low rumble like thunder broke the stillness of
      the morning. Deep, distant, weird, it denoted a
      thunderstorm to Milly. Yet how long and strangely it held
      on!
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett lifted his big head like a listening deer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stampede, by gosh! First one this summer. Lucky it's
      across the river."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stampede!" echoed the woman, slowly. "Hum! . . . Are there
      lots of buffalo across here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'd make a tolerable herd if they got bunched. I ain't
      in love with the idee. They might start the big herd on
      this side. We're aimin' to cross the prairie to the Red
      River. An' even if we had two days' start, a runnin' herd
      would catch us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't agree with you, Jett," remarked the woman.
      "Anyway, we're goin', buffalo or no buffalo."
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly listened to the low, distant rumble. What a strange
      sound! Did it not come from far away? Did she imagine it
      almost imperceptibly swelled in volume? She strained to
      hear. It lessened, died away, began again, and though ever
      so faint, it filled her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imperceptibly the gray dawn had yielded to daylight. The
      Jetts had about finished their meal. Whatever was going to
      happen must befall soon. Milly strove to control her
      fearful curiosity. Her heart beat high. This issue mattered
      mightily to her. Peeping over the far side of her wagon,
      she saw Catlee sitting on his bed, watching the Jetts from
      his angle. He saw Milly. Under the brim of his sombrero his
      eyes appeared to be black holes. He motioned Milly to keep
      down out of sight. Instinctively she obeyed, sinking back
      to her bed; and then, irresistibly impelled, she moved to
      the other side, farther up under the low wagon seat, and
      peeped out from under it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that juncture Pruitt and Follonsbee strode from
      somewhere to confront the Jetts. Milly would have shrunk
      back had she not been as if chained. The little rebel
      struck terror to her heart. Follonsbee resembled, as
      always, a bird of prey, but now about to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jett, you ain't bravin' it out?" asked Pruitt, cool and
      laconic. "Shore you ain't aimin' to leave heah without a
      divvy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm leavin' two wagons, six hosses, an' most of the
      outfit," replied Jett, gruffly. He stared at Pruitt.
      Something was seeking an entrance into his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're lucky to get that," snapped the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to her, Hank," said Pruitt, turning to Follonsbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm listenin', an' I don't have to hear no more. She
      stacked this deal," replied Pruitt's comrade, stridently.
      Only the timbre of his voice showed his passion; he was as
      slow and easy as Pruitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Talk to me," shouted Jett, beginning to give way to the
      stress of a situation beyond him. "Let my wife--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wife? Aw, hell," interposed Pruitt, contemptuously. "This
      Hardin woman ain't your wife any more'n she's mine. . . .
      Jett, you're yellow, an' you're shore talkin' to men who
      ain't yellow, whatever else they are."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jett cursed low and deep fumed in his effort to confront
      these men on an equality. But it was not in him. Fiercely
      he questioned the woman, "Did you tell them we wasn't
      married--yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon I did. It was when you was silly over this
      black-eyed step-daughter of yours," she replied suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuredly Jett would have struck her down but for the
      unforgetable proximity of Pruitt and Follonsbee. The latter
      laughed coarsely. Pruitt took a stride forward. His manner
      was careless, casual, but the set of muscles, the action of
      him, indicated something different.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jett, did <i>you</i> tell your woman you wanted to get rid
      of her--so's you could have your black-eyed wench?"
      demanded the little rebel, with all his insolent meanness.
      "You shore told us--an' you wasn't so orful drunk."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman seemed to tower and her face grew black.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't," yelled Jett.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wordlessly the woman turned to question these accusers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jett's a lyin' yellow skunk," declared Pruitt. "He shore
      meant to give the girl your place. 'Cause he wouldn't give
      her to me or Hank heah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's true," corroborated Follonsbee. "It's Jett an' not us
      who's lyin'. Why, I wouldn't lie to save both your dirty
      lives."
    </p>
    <p>
      That convinced the woman, and she turned on Jett with
      incoherent fury. He tried to yell a break into her tirade;
      and not till he had seized her in brutal hands, to shake
      her as if she had been a rat, did she stop. Then, after a
      pause, in which she glared at him with the hate of a jade,
      she panted: "I'll put--that little hussy's eyes out. . . .
      An' Rand Jett--<i>you'll</i> never--get a dollar of this
      hide money!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shut up or I'll mash your jaw!" he shouted, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haw! Haw!" laughed Follonsbee, in glee that seemed only in
      his tones. He did not move hand or foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jett, I'm shore hopin' we can leave you to this sweet
      lady," cut in Pruitt, "for you deserve it. But I'm feared
      your bull-headedness will aboot force our deal. . . . Once
      more an' last time, damn you--will you divvy hide-money,
      outfit, an' supplies, as you agreed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naw, I won't," declared Jett, fiercely. He looked a driven
      man; and strangely his gaze of hate was for the woman and
      not the man who menaced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we'll take it all!" flashed Pruitt, ringingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In violent shock Jett wheeled to face Pruitt, at last with
      comprehension. What he saw turned his skin white back of
      his yellow beard. His large, hard, bright blue eyes
      suddenly fixed in wild stare on Pruitt. And he began to
      shake. Suddenly he dove for his rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly's gaze had been riveted on Jett. Dimly she had seen
      Pruitt, but not to note look or action. Her fascinated
      spell broke to a horror of what was coming. Swiftly she
      dropped down to cover and wrapped her head in the blankets
      of her bed. Tightly she pulled them over ears and eyes, and
      twisted and rolled. And deep concussions seemed to beat at
      her brain. The wagon lurched. The blackness that enveloped
      her was not all from the blankets. Her senses seemed
      whirling dizzily. Then heart, pulse, thought returned to
      degree of discrimination.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened. There was no sound she could discern while
      under the folds of blankets. She was suffocating. She threw
      them off. Then, fearfully she lay there. All was still. No
      sound! A low thunder of stampeding buffalo floated across
      the river. Milly listened for voices. The camp appeared
      deserted. Had these men run off into the brakes? Sullen,
      sousing splashes in the river under the bank transfixed her
      into blank, icy horror. Something was ended. She could only
      wait, lying there in a tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she heard a soft step close to the wagon. Then
      Catlee's hat and face appeared over the side. He looked
      down at her with eyes the like of which Milly had never
      seen in a human.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lass, it's half over, but the worst's to come," he
      whispered, and with dark, gray gleaming gaze on her,
      bright, almost smiling, he dropped down out of her sight.
      He had not seen her desperation. He had not appealed to her
      to bear up under this tragedy. His look, his whisper, had
      made of her a comrade, brave to stand the outcome. Likewise
      they were a warning for herself to interpret, a suggestion
      of his imminent part in this terrible affair. They strung
      Milly's nerves to high tension. What might her part be?
      Compared with this experience, the West had dealt to women
      fatality and catastrophe which dwarfed hers. Life was
      sweet, never more so than at that moment, when memory of
      Tom Doan flashed back to her. She felt the grim and somber
      presence of death; she felt the imminence of further
      developments, sinister, harrowing, revolving more around
      her. Must she surrender to her emotions? Milly bit and
      choked them back. She needed all the strength, will, nerve
      possible to a woman; and in her extremity, with a racked
      heart, and unseeing eyes on the cottonwoods above, she
      propelled her spirit with the thought of Tom Doan, to
      endure or achieve anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low voices diverted the current of her mind. Some persons,
      at least two, were returning from the river bank. Milly sat
      up, to look over the wagon-side. Follonsbee and Pruitt were
      entering the camp clearing. Neither Jett nor the woman was
      to be seen. Milly suffered no shock, she had not expected
      to see them. Pruitt was wet and muddy to his hips.
    </p>
    <p>
      ". . . Shore may as well stay heah an' hunt hides, same as
      the other outfits," he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm ag'in' stayin'," replied Follonsbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, we won't argue aboot it. Shore I ain't carin' much
      one way or other," responded Pruitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the camp fire, the burned-out sticks of which
      Pruitt kicked with a wet boot. Follonsbee held his hands
      over the heat, though they could not have been chilled. The
      morning was warm. Milly saw his hands quivering very
      slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore we ought to have got that job off our hands long
      ago," said Pruitt. "Wal, Hank, heah's my idee. Let's pull
      out, ford the river below, an' strike for the Brazos.
      There's buffalo, an' this main herd won't be long comin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suits me good," responded the other, in relief. "Now let's
      have everythin' clear. We've shared the hide money Jett's
      woman had. How about the rest of the outfit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Same way, share an' share alike."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahuh. The deal's made. Shake on it," said Follonsbee,
      extending his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pruitt met it halfway with his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hank, we stuck together for aboot two years, an' I reckon
      we're a good team."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How about the girl?" suddenly demanded Follonsbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their backs were turned to Milly, who heard this query with
      the sharp ears of expectation. She was fortified by her own
      resolve and the still hidden presence of Catlee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, if I didn't forgit aboot our black-eyed wench!"
      ejaculated Pruitt, slapping his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toss you for her--or cut the cards?" asked Follonsbee,
      with his sleek, narrow, beak-like head lowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you won't. Yo're shore too lucky. . . . We'll share
      the girl same as the rest of the outfit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. It'll be a two-man outfit, half of everythin'
      for each--even the girl. Then we can't squabble. . . . But
      say, we forgot Catlee. Where the hell's he been?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon he was scared. Mebbe he's runnin' yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nope. I tell you, Andy, your hate of Yanks has got you
      figgerin' this Catlee wrong," protested Follonsbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That farm hand!" retorted Pruitt, with infinite disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farm hand nothin'," replied the other bluntly. "I don't
      know <i>what</i> he is, but he's got me figgerin'. We'd
      better give him a hoss an' pack an' turn him loose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pruitt pondered this suggestion for a moment and then
      somberly shook his head. That idea did not appeal to him,
      while at the same time it manifestly introduced another and
      uncertain element into the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly heard quick, rustling footsteps behind her. Catlee
      appeared round the wagon, with a gun leveled low in his
      right hand. Follonsbee saw him first and let out a startled
      exclamation. Pruitt jerked up. Then he froze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Howdy, men!" was Catlee's greeting, in voice these
      companions evidently had never heard him use before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Follonsbee uttered a gasp of amazed conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Andy! I <i>told</i> you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pruitt scarcely moved a muscle, unless in the flicker of an
      eyelash. He did not change expression. He hissed out,
      "Who'n hell are you <i>now?"</i> That was his swift
      acceptance of Follonsbee's reiterated hints.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Small matter," replied Catlee, as with weapon quiveringly
      extended he sheered round squarely in front of Pruitt, "but
      if it'd please you to be acquainted with me at this late
      day--you can bow to Sam Davis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahuh! Late pard of the Youngers," retorted Follonsbee,
      going white in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon I'm used to hard company," whipped out Catlee,
      stingingly, "but never yet took to sharin' innocent little
      girls!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pruitt suffered no suggestion of Follonsbee's weakening to
      the power of a name, whatever it was. The leveled weapon,
      covering him and his comrade, was the great factor in his
      reaction. Not for the slightest fraction of a second did he
      take his dancing, furious gaze from Catlee. The uselessness
      of more words seemed marked in his almost imperceptible
      gathering of muscular force. All the power of sight and
      mind was transfixed on Catlee's eyes, to read there the
      intent that preceded action. He chose an instant, probably
      the one in which Catlee decided, and like a flash drew his
      gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it left his hip and snapped, Catlee's gun crashed. The
      force of the bullet knocked Pruitt flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hur-ry Hank!" he yelled, in fierce, wild tone of terrible
      realization, and flinging the empty weapon he had forgotten
      to load he lurched like a crippled panther to get his hands
      on Jett's rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly saw only the intrepid Pruitt, but she heard Catlee's
      second shot and the sodden thud of Follonsbee falling. He
      made no outcry. Pruitt's actions were almost too swift to
      follow--so swift that Catlee missed him, as with spasmodic
      dive he grasped and carried Jett's rifle over the mess box.
      Up he sprang, grotesque, misshapen, yet wonderfully agile,
      to discharge the heavy rifle even as he received Catlee's
      fire square in his chest. Staggering backward, he dropped
      the weapon, his arms spread, and he seemed falling step by
      step. An awful blankness blotted out the ferocity of his
      crooked face. Step by step, he fell backward over the bank
      into the river. A sounding splash followed his
      disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly's set gaze wavered. A silence intervened. Her lungs
      seemed to expand. The appalling fixidity of her attention
      broke with a shock and she looked for Catlee. He lay on the
      ground beside the camp fire. His hand twitched--released
      the smoking gun. Milly leaped out of the wagon and ran to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knelt. His hat was off, his face vague, changing. The
      gray storm of his eyes seemed fading.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--oh--Catlee!" cried Milly, poignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good luck," he whispered. His lips set, his eyelids
      fluttered--all his body quivered to a relaxation. He had
      been shot through the breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God! how awful! . . . He's dead! They're all dead. I'm
      left--alone. It's over. . . . Brave Catlee! Oh, he saved
      me! . . . But what can I do? I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly's outburst was silenced by the shrill neigh of one of
      the horses hitched to the wagon. It was a neigh that
      heralded sight or scent of another horse. Wild and sharp
      then pealed out a whistling answer from across the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly bounded erect to peer out under the cottonwoods,
      thrilling with joy. But her joy sustained a bewildering
      check, and it died when steadier glance revealed mounted
      Indians riding down into the river. For one moment Milly
      stared, biting her fingers in her horror; then the spirit
      born of these trying hours ran through her like a white
      flame, and climbing to the seat of the wagon she whipped up
      the reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her instinct was to escape. She had no time to think of a
      better way. And the horses, restive, not wholly recovered
      from fright, needed no urging. They broke into trot,
      dragging the saddled animals behind the wagon. Out of the
      clearing, into the brakes they crashed, and were hard to
      hold. Road there was none, but a wide lane of crushed weeds
      and brush marked where Jett had driven the wagon in, and
      later had ridden to and fro on horseback. The team followed
      it and they tore through the bending clumps of brush that
      hung over it and bumped over logs. Branches of trees struck
      Milly as she passed, blinding her for a moment. When she
      could see clearly again the horses were no longer in the
      lane through the brush. They had swerved to one side or the
      other, she did not know which. But she kept her sense of
      direction: to the right was down river, and to the left was
      the prairie, the main herd of buffalo, and the camps of the
      hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      She must get out into the open quickly. If the Indians had
      not heard her drive away there would be a little time
      before they would strike out on her trail through the
      brakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I forgot," she cried. "They heard the horse neigh."
      And with a sinking of her daring spirit she let the horses
      have free rein. They quickened their gait, but showed no
      sign of bolting. They wanted to get out of that jungle, and
      they broke a path through thickets, over rotten logs, and
      under matted hanging vines. Milly had all she could do to
      keep from being torn from her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      They got by the worst of the brakes and Milly saw light
      ahead low down through the trees, but it seemed to be in
      the wrong direction. She should turn more to the left. Her
      efforts to head the iron-jawed team in that direction were
      unavailing. They kept to a straight course, out into the
      light. But this open had deceived Milly, and probably the
      horses also. It was a wide bare strip of sand where a
      tributary of the Pease flowed in wet season. Here the
      horses slowed to a dragging walk, yet soon crossed the sand
      to enter the brakes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here in the shade and dust, and the <i>mêlée</i> of
      threshing branches round her face, Milly lost all sense of
      the right direction. She realized her peril, yet did not
      despair. Something had always happened; it would happen to
      save her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a crashing of brush in front of her stopped her
      heart. She almost fell back into the wagon. A huge brown
      buffalo bull tore ahead of her, passing to the left. Milly
      recovered. Then again she heard crashing ahead of her, to
      one side, and more at a distance. There were buffalo in the
      brakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the swish of brush and rattle of wagon and pound of
      hoofs she began to hear a low, rumbling thunder, apparently
      to the fore and her right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They said stampede!" she cried fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her horses heard it and were excited, or else the scent and
      proximity of stray buffalo had been the cause of their
      faster, less regular gait. Milly essayed again to swerve
      them to the left, but in vain. And indeed that left side
      grew more and more impractical, owing to obstructions which
      shunted the horses in an opposite direction. Quite
      unexpectedly then they burst out of the brakes into open
      prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly was as amazed as frightened. The plain was so dusty
      she could not see a mile, and strings of buffalo were
      disappearing into a yellow broken pall. They appeared to be
      loping in their easy, lumbering way. The thunder was louder
      now, though still a strange low roar, and it came out of
      the dust curtain which obscured the prairie. The horses,
      snorting, not liking dust or buffalo, loped for a mile,
      then slowed to a walk and halted. Milly tried to get her
      bearings. The whole horizon to fore and right was streaky
      with dust and moving buffalo. From behind her the line of
      river timber extended on her right to fade in the obscurity
      of dust. This established her position. She had crossed the
      brakes of the tributary and was now headed east. The
      buffalo were then coming out of the south and they were
      crossing the Pease. Milly realized that she was far out of
      her proper course and must make a wide turn to the left,
      cross the dry stream-bed, and then go up the river to the
      camps of the hide-hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she missed something. The two saddle horses! They
      had broken off in the rough ride. Milly looked back at the
      dark, ragged line of the timber from where she had come.
      The air was clearer that way. Movement and flash attracted
      her gaze. She saw animals run out into the open. Wild,
      lean, colored ponies with riders! They stretched out in
      swift motion, graceful, wild, incomparably a contrast to
      the horses of white hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly realized she was being pursued by Indians.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>
      <a name="c15" id="c15">CHAPTER XV</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Milly screamed at the horses and swung the lash, beating
      them into a gallop. The lightly loaded wagon lurched and
      bounced over the hummocky prairie, throwing her off the
      seat and from side to side. A heavy strain on the reins
      threatened to tear her arms from their sockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this physical action that averted a panic-stricken
      flight. The horses broke from gallop into run, and they
      caught up with scattered groups and lines of buffalo. Milly
      was in the throes of the keenest terror that had yet beset
      her, but she did not quite lose her reason. There were a
      few moments fraught with heart-numbing, blood-curdling
      sensations; which on the other hand were counteracted by
      the violence of the race over the prairie, straight for the
      straggling strings of the buffalo herd. The horses plunged,
      hurtling the wagon along; the wind, now tainted with dust
      and scent of buffalo, rushed into Milly's face and waved
      her hair; the tremendous drag on the reins, at first
      scarcely perceptible, in her great excitement, began to
      hurt hands, wrists, arms, shoulders in a degree that
      compelled attention. But the race itself, the flight, the
      breakneck pace across the prairie, with stampeding buffalo
      before and Comanche Indians behind--it was too great, too
      magnificent, too terrible to prostrate this girl. Opposed
      to all the fears possible to a girl was the thing roused in
      her by love, by example of a thief who had died to save
      her, by the marvel of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly gazed back over her shoulder. The Comanches had
      gained. They were not half a mile away, riding now in wide
      formation, naked, gaudy, lean, feathered, swift and wild as
      a gale of wind in the tall prairie grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better death among the buffalo!" cried Milly, and she
      turned to wrap both reins round her left wrist, to lash out
      with the whip, and to scream: <i>"Run! Run! Run!"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Buffalo loped ahead of her, to each side and behind, in
      straggling groups and lines, all headed in the same
      direction as the vague denser bunches to the right. Here
      the dust pall moved like broken clouds, showing light and
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became aware of increasing fullness in her ears. The
      low rumble had changed to a clattering trample, yet there
      seemed more. The sound grew; it came closer; it swelled to
      a roar; and presently she located it in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned. With startled gaze she saw a long, bobbing,
      black, ragged mass pouring like a woolly flood out over the
      prairie. A sea of buffalo! They were moving at a lope,
      ponderously, regularly, and the scalloped head of that
      immense herd crossed the line between Milly and the
      Comanches. It swept on. It dammed and blocked the way.
      Milly saw the vermillion paint on the naked bodies and
      faces of these savages as they wheeled their lean horses to
      race along with the buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then thin whorls of rising dust obscured them from Milly's
      sight. A half mile of black bobbing humps moved between her
      and the Comanches. She uttered a wild cry that was joy,
      wonder, reverence, and acceptance of the thing she had
      trusted. Thicker grew the dust mantle; wider the herd;
      greater the volume of sound! The Comanches might now have
      been a thousand miles away, for all the harm they could do
      her. As they vanished in the obscurity of dust so also did
      they fade from Milly's mind!
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly drove a plunging maddened team of horses in the midst
      of buffalo as far as the eye could see. Her intelligence
      told her that she was now in greater peril of death than at
      any time heretofore, yet, though her hair rose stiff and
      her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth, she could not
      feel the same as when Pruitt had parceled her, share and
      share with Follonsbee, or when those lean wild-riding
      Comanches had been swooping down on her. Strangely, though
      there was natural terror in the moment, she did not seem
      afraid of the buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thick massed herd was on her left, and appeared to have
      but few open patches; to the fore and all on the other side
      there were as many gray spaces of prairie showing as black
      loping blotches of buffalo. Her horses were running while
      the buffalo were loping, thus she kept gaining on groups
      near her and passing them. Always they sheered away, some
      of the bulls kicking out with wonderful quickness. But in
      the main they gave space to the swifter horses and the
      lumbering wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dust rose in sheets now thin, now thick, and obscured
      everything beyond a quarter of a mile distant. Milly was
      surrounded, hemmed in, carried onward by a pondering moving
      medium. The trampling roar of hoofs was deafening, but it
      was not now like thunder. It was too close. It did not
      swell or rumble or roll. It roared.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand tufted tails switched out of that mass, and ten
      times that many shaggy humps bobbed in sight. What queer
      sensation this action gave Milly--queer above all the other
      sensations! It struck her as ludicrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The larger, denser mass on the left had loped up at
      somewhat faster gait than those groups Milly had first
      encountered. It forged ahead for a time, then gradually
      absorbed all the buffalo, until they were moving in unison.
      Slowly they appeared to pack together, to obliterate the
      open spaces, and to close in on the horses. This was what
      Milly feared most.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses took their bits between their teeth and ran
      headlong. Milly had to slack the reins or be pulled out of
      the seat. They plunged into the rear of the moving buffalo,
      to make no impression otherwise than to split the phalanx
      for a few rods and be kicked from all sides. Here the
      horses reared, plunged, and sent out above the steady roar
      a piercing scream of terror. Milly had never before heard
      the scream of a horse. She could do nothing but cling to
      the loose reins and the wagon seat, and gaze with distended
      eyes. One of the white horses, Jett's favorite, plunged to
      his knees. The instant was one when Milly seemed to be
      clamped by paralysis. The other white horse plunged on,
      dragging his mate to his feet and into the race again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the space around horses and wagons closed in, narrowed
      to an oval with only a few yards clear to the fore and on
      each side. Behind, the huge, lowered, shaggy heads almost
      bobbed against the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time of supreme suspense had come to Milly. She had
      heard buffalo would run over and crush any obstruction in
      their path. She seemed about to become the victim of such a
      blind juggernaut. Her horses had been compelled to slacken
      their gait to accommodate that of the buffalo. They could
      neither forge ahead, nor swerve to one side or other, nor
      stop. They were blocked, hemmed in, and pushed. And their
      terror was extreme. They plunged in unison and singly; they
      screamed and bit at the kicking buffalo. It was a miracle
      that leg or harness or wheel was not broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      A violent jolt nearly unseated Milly. The wagon had been
      struck from behind. Fearfully she looked back. A
      stupid-faced old bull, with shaggy head as large as a
      barrel, was wagging along almost under the end of the
      wagon-bed. He had bumped into it. Then the space on the
      left closed in until buffalo were right alongside the
      wheels. Milly wrung her hands. It would happen now. A wheel
      would be broken, the wagon overturned, and she . . . A big
      black bull rubbed his rump against the hind wheel. The iron
      tire revolving fast scraped hard on his hide. Quick as a
      flash the bull lowered head and elevated rear, kicking out
      viciously. One of his legs went between the spokes. A crack
      rang out above the trample of hoofs. The bull went down,
      and the wagon lifted and all but upset. Milly could not cry
      out. She clung to the seat with all her strength. Then
      began a terrific commotion. The horses plunged as the drag
      on the wagon held them back. Buffalo began to pile high
      over the one that had fallen, and a wave of action seemed
      to permeate all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those rushing forward pounded against the hind wheels, and
      split round them until the pressure became so great that
      they seemed to lift the wagon and carry it along, forcing
      the horses ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly could not shut her eyes. They were fascinated by this
      heaving mass. The continuous roar, the endless motion
      toward certain catastrophe, were driving her mad. Then this
      bump and scrape and lurch, this frightful proximity of the
      encroaching buffalo, this pell-mell pandemonium behind, was
      too much for her. The strength of hands and will left her.
      The wagon tilted, turned sidewise, and stopped with a
      shock. An appalling sound seemed to take the place of
      motion. The buffalo behind began to lift their great heads,
      to pile high over those in front, to crowd in terrific
      straining wave of black, hideous and irresistible, like an
      oncoming tide. Heads and horns and hair, tufted tails, a
      dense, rounded, moving, tussling sea of buffalo bore down
      on the wagon. The sound was now a thundering roar. Dust
      hung low. The air was suffocating. Milly's nose and lungs
      seemed to close. She fell backward over the seat and
      fainted.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When she opened her eyes it was as if she had come out of a
      nightmare. She lay on her back. She gazed upward to sky
      thinly filmed over by dust clouds. Had she slept?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she understood the meaning of motion and the
      sensation of filled ears. The wagon was moving steadily,
      she could not tell how fast, and from all sides rose a low,
      clattering roar of hoofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it must be--something happened--the horses went
      on--the wagon did not upset!" she cried, and her voice was
      indistinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she feared to rise and look out. She listened and felt.
      There was a vast difference. The wagon moved on steadily,
      smoothly, without lurch or bump; the sound of hoofs filled
      the air, yet not loudly or with such a cutting trample. She
      reasoned out that the pace had slowed much. Where was she?
      How long had she lain unconscious? What would be the end of
      this awful race?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing happened. She found her breathing easier and her
      nostrils less stopped by dust and odor of buffalo. Her
      mouth was parched with thirst. There was a slow, torrid
      beat of her pulse. Her skin appeared moist and hot. Then
      she saw the sun, quite high, a strange magenta hue, seen
      through the thin dust clouds. It had been just after
      daylight when she escaped from Jett's camp. Ah! she
      remembered Catlee!--Sam Davis, one of Younger's clan! . . .
      Hours had passed and she was still surrounded by buffalo.
      The end had not come then; it had been averted, but it was
      inevitable. What she had passed through! Life was cruel.
      Hers had been an unhappy fate. Suddenly she thought of Tom
      Doan, and life, courage, hope surged with the magic of
      love. Something had happened to save her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly sat up. She saw gray prairie--and then, some fifty
      yards distant, the brown shaggy bodies of buffalo, in lazy
      lope. The wagon was keeping the same slow speed. Milly
      staggered up to lean against the seat and peer ahead.
      Wonderful to see--Jett's white team was contentedly
      trotting along, some rods in the rear of straggling
      buffalo. She could scarcely believe what she saw. The
      horses were no longer frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side wider space intervened before buffalo
      covered the gray prairie. She could see a long way--miles,
      it seemed--and there were as many black streaks of buffalo
      as gray strips of grass. To the fore Milly beheld the same
      scene, only greater in extent. Buffalo showed as far as
      sight could penetrate, but they were no longer massed or
      moving fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not a stampede," Milly told herself in sudden
      realization. "It never was. . . . They're just traveling.
      They don't mind the wagon--the horses--not any more. . . .
      Oh, I shall get out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The knotted reins hung over the brake, where she had left
      them. Milly climbed to the driver's seat and took them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses responded to her control, not in accelerated
      trot, but by a lifting of ears and throwing of heads. They
      were glad to be under guidance again. They trotted on as if
      no buffalo were near. It amazed Milly, this change. But she
      could tell by the sweat and froth and cakes of dust on them
      that they had traveled far and long before coming to this
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly did not drive the horses, though she held the reins
      taut enough for them to feel she was there; she sat stiff
      in the seat, calling to them, watching and thrilling,
      nervously and fearfully suspicious of the moving inclosure
      which carried her onward a prisoner. Time passed swiftly.
      The sun burned down on her. And the hour came when the
      buffalo lumbered to a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were no different from cattle now, Milly thought. Then
      the dust clouds floated away and she could see over the
      backs of buffalo on all sides, out to the boundless
      prairie. The blue sky overhead seemed to have a welcome for
      her. The horses slowed down. Gradually the form of the open
      space surrounding the wagon widened, changed its shape as
      buffalo in groups wandered out from the herd. Little light
      tawny calves appeared to run playfully into the open. They
      did not play as if they were tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly watched them with a birth of love in her heart for
      them, and a gratitude to the whole herd for its service to
      her. No doubt now that she was saved! Nearly a whole day
      had passed since the Indians had seen her disappear, and
      leagues of prairie had been covered. The direction she was
      being taken was north, and that she knew to be favorable to
      her. Sooner or later these buffalo would split or pass by
      her; then she would have another problem to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how interminably they traveled on! No doubt the annual
      instinct to migrate northward had been the cause of this
      movement. If they had stampeded across the Pease, which had
      not seemed to her the case, they had at once calmed to a
      gait the hunters called their regular ranging mode of
      travel. Her peril at one time had been great, but if this
      herd had caught her in a stampede she would have been lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stragglers that from time to time came near her paid no
      attention to horses or wagon. They were as tame as cows.
      They puffed along, wagging their big heads, apparently
      asleep as they traveled. The open lanes and aisles and
      patches changed shape, closed to reopen, yet on the whole
      there was a gradual widening. The herd was spreading. Milly
      could see the ragged rear a couple of miles back, where it
      marked its dark line against the gray prairie. Westward the
      mass was thick and wide; it was thin and straggly on the
      east. Northward the black creeping tide of backs extended
      to the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly rode on, escorted by a million beasts of the plain,
      and they came to mean more to her than she could
      understand. They were alive, vigorous, self-sufficient; and
      they were doomed by the hide-hunters. She could not think
      of anything save the great, shaggy, stolid old bulls, and
      the sleeker smaller cows, and the tawny romping calves. So
      wonderful an adventure, so vast a number of hoofed
      creatures, so strangely trooping up out of the dusty river
      brakes to envelop her, so different when she and they and
      the horses had become accustomed to one another--these
      ideas were the gist of her thoughts. It was a strange,
      unreal concentration on buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon waned. The sun sank low in the west and
      turned gold. A time came when Milly saw with amaze that the
      front leagues of buffalo had disappeared over the horizon,
      now close at hand. They had come to edge of slope on river
      brake. What would this mean to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      When the wagon reached the line where the woolly backs had
      gone down out of sight Milly saw a slope, covered with
      spreading buffalo, that ended in a winding green belt of
      trees. In places shone the glancing brightness of water.
      Beyond, on a level immense plain, miles and miles of
      buffalo were moving like myriads of ants. They were
      spreading on all sides, and those in the lead had stopped
      to graze. The immensity of the scene, its beauty and life
      and tragedy, would remain in Milly's memory all her days.
      She saw the whole herd, and it was a spectacle to uplift
      her heart. While the horses walked on with the buffalo
      streaming down that slope Milly gazed in rapt attention.
      How endless the gray level prairie below! She understood
      why the buffalo loved it, how it had nourished them, what a
      wild lonely home it was. Faint threads of other rivers
      crossed the gray; and the green hue was welcome contrast to
      the monotony. Duskily red the sun was setting, and it cast
      its glow over the plain and buffalo, stronger every moment.
      In the distance purple mantled the horizon. Far to the
      northwest a faint dark ruggedness of land or cloud seemed
      limned against the sunset-flushed sky. Was that land? If so
      it was the Llano Estacado.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly's horses reached the belt of trees, and entered a
      grove through and round which the buffalo were traveling.
      She felt the breaking of the inclosure of beasts that had
      so long encompassed her. It brought a change of thoughts.
      She was free to let the remainder of the herd pass. Driving
      down, behind a thick clump of cottonwoods she turned into a
      green pocket, and halted. Wearily the horses stood,
      heaving, untempted by the grass. On each side of Milly
      streams and strings and groups of buffalo passed to go down
      into the river, from which a loud continuous splashing
      rose. She waited, watching on one side, then the other. The
      solid masses had gone by; the ranks behind thinned as they
      came on; and at last straggling groups with many calves
      brought up the rear. These hurried on, rustling the bush,
      on to splash into the shallow ford. Then the violence of
      agitated water ceased; the low trample of hoofs ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence! It was not real. For a whole day Milly's ears had
      been filled and harassed by a continuous trample, at first
      a roar, then a clatter, then a slow beat, beat, beat of
      hoofs, but always a trample. She could not get used to
      silence. She felt lost. A rush of sensations seemed
      impending. But only a dreamy stillness pervaded the river
      bottom, a hot, drowsy, thick air, empty of life. The
      unnaturally silent moment flung at her the loneliness and
      wildness of the place. Alone! She was lost on the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what shall I do now?" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was everything to do--to care for the horses, and for
      herself, so to preserve strength; to choose a direction,
      and to travel on and on, until she found a road that would
      lead her to some camp or post. Suddenly she sank down in a
      heap. The thought of the enormous problem crushed her for a
      moment. She was in the throes of a reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I mustn't <i>think,"</i> she whispered, fiercely. "I
      must <i>do!"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      And she clambered out of the wagon. The grove sloped down
      to the green bench where she had waited for the buffalo to
      pass. Grass was abundant. The horses would not stray. She
      moved to unhitch them, and had begun when it occurred to
      her that she would have to hitch them up again. To this end
      she studied every buckle and strap. Many a time she had
      helped round horses on the farm. The intricacies of harness
      were not an entire mystery to her. Then she had watched
      Jett and Catlee hitch up this team. Still, she studied
      everything carefully. Then she unbuttoned the traces and
      removed the harness. The horses rolled in a dusty place
      which the buffalo had trampled barren, and they rose dirty
      and yellow to shake a cloud from their backs. Then with
      snorts they trotted down to the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly was reminded of her own burning thirst, and she ran
      down to the water's edge, where, unmindful of its muddy
      color, she threw herself flat and drank until she could
      hold no more. "Never knew--water--could taste so good," she
      panted. Returning to the wagon, she climbed up in it to
      examine its contents. She found a bag of oats for the
      horses, a box containing utensils for cooking, another full
      of food supplies, a bale of blankets, and lastly an ax and
      shovel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Robinson Crusoe had no more," said Milly to herself, and
      then stood aghast at her levity. Was she not lost on the
      prairie? Might not Indians ride down upon her? Milly
      considered the probabilities. "God has answered my prayer,"
      she concluded, gravely, and dismissed fears for the time
      being.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the box of utensils she found matches, which were next
      to food in importance, and thus encouraged she lifted out
      what she needed. Among the articles of food were a loaf of
      bread and a bag of biscuits. Suddenly her mouth became
      flooded with saliva and she had to bite into a biscuit.
      There were also cooked meat and both jerked venison and
      buffalo. Salt and pepper, sugar, coffee, dried apples she
      found, and then did not explore the box to the uttermost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll not starve, anyway," murmured Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next she gathered dry bits of bark and wood, of which there
      was abundance, and essayed to start a fire. Success crowned
      her efforts, though she burned her fingers. Then, taking up
      the pail, she descended the bank to the river and filled it
      with water, which was now clarifying in the slow current.
      Returning, she poured some into the coffee pot and put that
      in the edge of the fire. Next, while waiting for the water
      to boil she cut strips of the cooked buffalo meat and
      heated them in a pan. She had misgivings about what her
      cooking might be. Nevertheless, she sat down presently and
      ate as heartily as ever before in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twilight had fallen when she looked up from the last task.
      The west was rose with an afterglow of sunset. All at once,
      now that action had to be suspended, she was confronted
      with reality. The emotion of reality!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm lost--alone--helpless!" she exclaimed. "It's
      growing dark. I was always afraid of the dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she shivered there through a long moment of feeling.
      She would be compelled to think now. She could not force
      sleep. How impossible to fall asleep! Panthers, bears,
      wildcats, wolves lived in these river brakes. She felt in
      her coat for the little derringer. It was gone. She had no
      weapons save the ax, and she could not wield that
      effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she did not at once seek the apparent security of her
      bed in the wagon. She walked about, though close by. She
      peered into the gathering shadows. She listened. The
      silence had been relieved by crickets and frogs. Slowly the
      black night mantled the river bottom and the trains of
      stars twinkled in the blue dome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of the horses, as they grazed near, brought
      something of comfort, if not relief. She remembered a dog
      she had loved. Rover--if she only had him now! Then she
      climbed into the wagon, and without removing even her boots
      she crawled into the blankets. They had been disarranged in
      the rough ride. She needed them more to hide under than for
      warmth. The soft night seemed drowsily lulling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her body cried out with its aches and pains and weariness,
      with the deep internal riot round her heart, with throb of
      brain. Not all at once could she lie still. But gradually
      began a slow sinking, as if she were settling down, down,
      and all at once she lay like a log. It was too warm under
      the blanket, yet when she threw it back and saw the white
      stars, so strange, watchful, she grew more aware of her
      plight and covered her face again. At length her body
      relaxed to the point where it was no longer dominating with
      its muscular sensations. Then her mind grew
      active--reverted to the terrible tragedy of Jett's outfit.
      Catlee! . . . All the time he had watched over her. He had
      killed for her--and died for her. A man who confessed he
      had never been anything else than bad! Something great
      loomed in Milly's simple mind. Could Jett have had any good
      in him? . . . She prayed for their souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had left her alone, and she must find her
      way--whither? And into that dark gulf of mind flashed the
      thought and the vision of Tom Doan. Milly began to weep. It
      was too terrible, the remembrance of him, and his love and
      kisses, of his offer of marriage and his plan for their
      home. Terrible to dwell upon when she was lost in the
      prairie. She might never see him again! But she must try
      with all her power to find her way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--will try--for him!" she sobbed, and remembered her
      prayers. Then grief and worry succumbed to exhaustion; she
      drifted into slumber.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The singing of birds awakened Milly. The sun had risen; the
      green leaves were fluttering with a silken rustle. It took
      a moment for realization of her situation to rush into
      thought. Yet the darkness of mind, the old reluctance to
      return to consciousness, was absent this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she got to her knees, and knelt there, stretching her
      bruised and cramped muscles, she looked over the wagon to
      see the white horses grazing near under the cottonwoods.
      Sleek gray deer were grazing with them, as tame as cattle.
      A rabbit crossed the aisle of green. The morning held a
      strange bright beauty and peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly brushed out her tangled short curls. Her face was
      burned from the wind and sun of yesterday's ride. Then she
      climbed out of the wagon, ready for the day. She did not
      have to dress, and she thought bathing her face might make
      the sunburn worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      First she put a quart of oats in each nose bag, and carried
      them out to the horses. She did not need to go far. Both
      horses saw her and came, to meet her; and slipping the
      nosebags in place, she led them to the wagon and haltered
      them. Breakfast did not take long to prepare and eat. Then
      she cleaned the utensils, packed them away in the box,
      shook out her blankets, and rolled them. This left the task
      which worried her--that of hitching up.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she came to undertake it she found that she
      remembered where every part of the harness belonged. To
      lift the heavy wagon tongue and hold it while she snapped
      the hooks into rings required all her strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!" she muttered, with something of pride and wonder.
      "Now what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the wagon all right? She walked round it, as she had
      seen Jett do. One spoke had been broken out of the left
      hind wheel; other than that she could not see any damage.
      Jett had greased the wagon wheels the day before his
      intended departure. Nothing more to do but start! Milly was
      almost overcome at the thought. It seemed incredible that
      she would dare to drive across the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't stay here. I'd be as badly off as on the move,"
      she burst out, desperately. "Oh, I must go! But
      where--how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrung her hands and fought her fears. A terrible
      problem confronted her. Yet was it as perilous as when she
      was practically a prisoner in Jett's outfit. Again she
      remembered that her prayers had been answered. Suppose she
      was only a timid weak girl? Could she not make herself do
      what any boy might do? Once and for all she drove herself
      passionately into a spirit of daring and faith. She
      resolved to feel these, even though she had to endure
      agonies of dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she plumped to her knees before a little bare spot of
      sand, and gazing down at it she thought with all her might.
      Not for nothing had she been keen to observe men in camp,
      when they talked about roads, trails, places. Jett had been
      poor at direction and location, but Follonsbee had the
      whole buffalo country in his mind. Milly had seen him draw
      maps in the dirt. To this end she took up a stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The west is there," she said, thoughtfully. "I saw the sun
      set. Then the north is there. Northwest is my direction. It
      was ten days' travel from Pease River to Sprague's Post. .
      . . Here's the Pease."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she drew a line in the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yesterday I came thirty miles--maybe forty, almost due
      north, to this stream. Then I'm here." She made a dot in
      the sand, and another line representing this stream. "I
      don't dare try to find my way back to the buffalo camps. I
      might meet the Indians. I must not follow this stream west.
      I must cross it and head northwest. I must cross every
      stream I meet. When I reach one too deep to ford I must
      follow along it till I find a place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly's reasoning was the result of her experience with the
      Jett outfit. It took no particular degree of intelligence
      to calculate about where she was on the prairie and what to
      do to get out. The great task was to accomplish what her
      judgment dictated. She had traveled enough over the
      untrodden prairie to have some faint conception of the
      enormity of what faced her. Thought of meeting with
      buffalo-hunters persistently flaunted hopes. They
      encouraged her, but she could not trust to them. This Texas
      prairie covered a vast space, and in it she was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all!" she said, blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment of decision had come. Milly drew a deep breath
      and flung wide her arms, with hands clenching. How she
      hated to leave the apparent protection of these friendly
      cottonwoods! Then, with a great throb in her breast, she
      turned to mount the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not reluctant indeed were the horses. They had grazed and
      drunk their fill and they knew their noses were pointed
      homeward, away from the buffalo fields. Milly had all she
      could do to hold them. She drove out of the grove, to the
      right where the buffalo had worn a wide trodden belt down
      to the stream. The last fifty yards were quite downhill.
      Milly reined in to scrutinize her first obstacle of the
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thousands of buffalo had forded the stream here. Far as she
      could see, the banks on both sides were trodden fresh and
      dark with tracks. At this point the stream was perhaps
      three feet deep and forty wide; nothing for strong and
      nimble buffalo to ford. But these buffalo had not been
      hampered with a wagon. Still, the crossing was not
      especially bad. Jett would not have given it a second
      glance. He would have plunged across. The sandy bottom
      would assuredly be hard packed. Milly had only to start
      right, not too carefully, and to keep the horses going.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw on the brake and called to the horses. "Get up!
      Whity! Specks! . . . Easy now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They trotted down the slope--faster--faster, Milly leaned
      back on the reins. Her face blanched. Her teeth clenched.
      It was fearful, yet it roused defiance. She could drive
      them. They were eager, unafraid. The wagon propelled them.
      Plunge! the water crashed and splashed high. And the wagon
      bounced after them, to souse into the stream, over the
      front wheels. Milly was deluged. For an instant she could
      not see for water in her eyes, for the flying spray. But
      she called to the horses. They took the stream at a trot.
      It was no deeper than their knees, and they sent sheets of
      muddy water ahead of them. The opposite bank was low, easy
      for them; and Milly, before she realized it, pulled up on
      the level open prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Easy, and I got a bath!" she cried, exultantly. "Oh, Whity
      and Specks, I love you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She searched for her scarf to wipe her wet face and hair.
      But it, too, like her little gun, was gone. She had lost
      it. No! She recalled that she had left it tied on the hoop
      of the wagon cover in Jett's camp. The memory startled her.
      Suppose Tom Doan should at last find Jett's camp and see
      her red scarf. But that misery for him could never be. The
      Indians would have made blackened embers of that camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly took her direction from the sun and drove out upon
      the prairie. It was a gray, beautiful plain, luxuriant with
      ripened grass, sloping very gently to the north. Far to the
      eastward she espied the black horizon--wide line of
      buffalo. They had grazed down the stream. In the bright
      sunlight the whole panorama was splendid and stirring to
      Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses started at a trot, and in the thick grass slowed
      to a steady brisk walk. The wagon was light, the ground
      level; and this powerful team had no serious task ahead of
      them, if they were only guided aright. Milly was excited,
      thrilled, and yet troubled. The adventure was tremendous,
      but the responsibility too great except for moments of
      defiance or exaltation. She could not all the time remain
      keyed up with a spirit that was unquenchable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several miles of travel brought her to the summit of the
      gradual slope of valley, and here, as on the side from
      which she had come, she obtained commanding view of the
      surrounding country. It was grand, but she had eyes only
      for the northwest. Across the leagues of billowy prairie,
      so gray and monotonous and lonely, there stood a purple
      escarpment, remote and calling. It was the Llano Estacado.
      Milly recognized it, and seemed for an instant to forget
      the sense of being lost. But it was far away, and the
      northern end disappeared in purple haze. On the other hand
      it was a landmark ever present from high points, and
      somewhere between it and her present position ran the road
      of the buffalo-hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her left meandered the green line of trees, like a
      fringed ribbon on the soft gray of prairie, and it headed
      toward the Staked Pain, where she knew all these Texas
      streams had their source.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could reach the road to-day or to-morrow, if I drove
      straight west," soliloquized Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sore temptation, but her good sense forbade her to
      take such added risk. The Comanches were between her and
      the buffalo camps. She must aim diagonally across the
      prairie, toward the extreme northwest corner of the
      escarpment, and perhaps four or five days she would strike
      the road. Then she would know the camping grounds, and
      would surely fall in with oncoming hunters or outgoing
      freighters. To find water at night, and to cross such
      streams as she met--these were her present problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, as she drove on, thinking only of this
      incredible journey, she could not help seeing and being
      momentarily thrilled by the wild creatures of the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleek gray, white-rumped antelope scarcely bothered to trot
      out of her path, and with long ears erect they watched her
      pass. Wild? These beautiful prairie deer were not wild.
      Milly believed she could in time have had them eating out
      of her hand, like she had the squirrels and birds at the
      Pease River camp. It was men who made animals wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ranged the wide gray expanse for sight of buffalo.
      There were none. She saw a band of coyotes sneaking round
      the antelope. Farther on she espied a gaunt wolf, almost
      white, watching her from a ridge-top. Rabbits were always
      scurrying from before the horses, and prairie birds flitted
      out of the grass. Once Milly saw a red hawk poised in
      midair, fluttering its wings with marvelous rapidity, and
      then it shot down like a streak, to strike the grass and
      rise with a tiny animal in its talons. Always beauty and
      life present, and with them, cruelty--death!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Milly drove from early morning until an hour before sunset,
      when she reached the only water of the day. It was a pond
      in a sandy stream-bed. There were fringes of hackaberry
      brush along the banks, but no sheltering trees. Farther
      west some six or eight miles she thought she espied the
      green of timber, but that was far away and off her line of
      direction. She must take what afforded; and to this end she
      unhitched, turned the horses loose, and made the simple
      preparations for her own wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whity and Specks, as she had christened the horses, after
      drinking at the pond returned to linger near the wagon.
      They manifested extraordinary interest in Milly and even
      got in her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter with you white-faced beggars?" she
      asked. "It's oats you want, yes? Well, I'm not going to let
      you eat all the oats right away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she was not proof against their nosing round her. Long
      had she been gentle and kind to these horses--the more so
      because of Jett's brutality. They knew her well, and now
      that she was master they began to prove the devotion of
      dumb brutes. Milly gave them sparingly of the oats, and
      petted them, and talked the more because solitude had begun
      to impinge upon her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sunset hour found her tired after the long day's
      drive. With change of action, followed by food and drink
      she needed, there came a rally of spirits. Darkness soon
      hid the lonely, limitless expanse from Milly's gaze, and
      then it seemed the night was lonelier. Only a faint murmur
      of insects! She would have welcomed a mourn of wolf, or
      even a cry of panther. A slight breeze fanned the red
      embers of the meager fire. She went to bed afraid of the
      silence, the night, afraid of sleep, yet she could not keep
      her eyes open or stay the drowsy fading away of senses.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Milly was up early, and on the way before
      sunrise. She started well. But at the end of the first hour
      she ran into rough prairie, hindering travel. The luxuriant
      prairie grass failed and the gray earth carried only a
      scanty covering. The horses plowed up dust that rose and
      blew back upon her; the sun grew hot and glaring; and there
      was a wide area of shallow washes, ditches, gullies, like
      the depressions of a washboard. Having plodded miles into
      this zone, she could not turn back, unless absolutely
      balked, so she applied herself to careful driving, and kept
      on, true as possible to the distant purple landmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong horses, used to a heavy hand, could not
      altogether be controlled by Milly, and they plunged into
      many places without her sanction. What with holding the
      reins as best she could, and constant heed to brake and
      distance, and worry lest she would damage a wheel, she was
      in grievous straits most of that day. It passed swiftly,
      swallowed up in miles of hard going, and left no time for
      scanning the prairie or fearful imaginings. It was work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward evening she drew out of this zone and came presently
      to good grass once more, and just at dusk hauled up to a
      timber belt that bordered water. The thirsty horses stamped
      to get down to it. Milly labored to unhitch them, and when
      the task was done she sank to the ground to rest. But she
      was driven to secure firewood while there was light enough.
      She felt too tired to eat, yet she knew she must eat, or
      else fail altogether of strength. The long hanging to the
      reins was what had exhausted Milly. Her hands hurt, her
      arms ached, her shoulders sagged. Driving that iron-mouthed
      team was a man's job. Milly was no weakling, but her weight
      and muscular force were inadequate to the demand of such
      driving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper, bed, night, sleep--they all passed swiftly, and
      again the sun rose. Milly could not find a place to ford
      the stream. It was not a depth of water that prevented, but
      high banks unsafe to attempt. For miles she drove along it,
      glad of the green foliage and singing birds and wild
      creatures, and especially glad that its course for most of
      the morning ran a little west of north. When, however, it
      made an abrupt turn to the west, she knew she must cross.
      She essayed the best ford she could find, made it safely,
      wet, shaken, frightened, and nearly pulled apart. On that
      far side she rested in the shade, and wept while she ate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When about to start again she remembered that the men had
      never passed a stream or pond without watering the horses.
      Whereupon she took the bucket and went down to fill it.
      Four trips were necessary to satisfy the thirst of Whity
      and Specks. She had done well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had two dry camps between Sprague's and the Pease," she
      said, and thought she must not forget that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon drive began favorably. The sun was somewhat
      hazed over, reducing the heat; a level prairie afforded
      smooth travel; the horses had settled down into steady
      stolid work. The miles came slowly, but surely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly's courage had not failed, but she was beset by
      physical ills, and the attendant moods, fancies, thoughts
      that could not everlastingly be overcome. She grew to hate
      the boundless prairie-land, so barren of life, of any color
      but gray, of things that might mitigate the deceit of
      distance. Nothing save gray level and purple haze! It wore
      on her, ever flinging at her the attributes of the prairie
      openness, a windy vastness, empty of sound, movement, the
      abode of solitude, the abode of loneliness. Lonely, lonely
      land! She was as much lost as ever. There was no road, no
      river, no camp, no mountain, only the dim upflung false
      Llano Estacado, unattainable as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while Milly succumbed to her ills and her woes the
      horses plodded on. They knew what they had to accomplish,
      and were equal to it. They crowded the hours and miles
      behind them, and bore Milly to another watercourse, a wide
      glade-bordered enlargement of a stream, where ducks and
      cranes and kingfishers gave life to the melancholy scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she performed her tasks the lake changed from blue to
      gold, and at last mirrored the rose of sunset sky. Then
      dusk fell sadly, and night came, dark, lonely, pierced by
      the penetrating trill of frogs and the dismal cry of a
      water fowl. They kept Milly awake and she could not shake
      the encroachment of morbid thoughts. Where was she? What
      would become of her? The vast gloomy prairie encompassed
      her, held her a prisoner, threatened her with madness. She
      had feared Indians, rivers, accidents, but now only the
      insupportable loneliness. Would she not die of it and be
      eaten by buzzards? The stars that had been so beautiful,
      watching, helpful, now seemed pitiless, remote, aloof, with
      their pale eyes on her, a girl lost on the endless prairie.
      What was beyond those stars? Not a soul, no kindly great
      spirit to guide her out of this wilderness? Milly prayed
      once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dragged herself from bed next day, long after sunrise,
      and had spirit to begin the ordeal, if her flesh was weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whity and Specks waited in camp for their oats. Milly
      scorned herself for dreading they would run away, leaving
      her utterly alone. She fed them and caressed them, and
      talked as if they were human. "You belong to me," she said.
      "I was Jett's stepdaughter. He's gone. And you're mine. . .
      . If you ever get me out of this--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not think she would ever get out now, unless
      Providence remembered her again. She had no hunger. A fever
      consumed her and she drank copiously of water. Hitching up
      was a dragging job. The heavy wagon tongue nearly broke her
      back. At last she was in the driver's seat. Whity and
      Sparks started of their own accord, splashed across the
      shallow lake, and pulled up on the gray flat expanse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly was either ill or almost spent, she did not know
      which. She had power to sit up, hold the reins, guide the
      horses toward that futile illusive landmark days away on
      the horizon, but she could not control her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wandering roll of prairie-land mocked her with its
      shining gray distances, its illusive endlessness, its veils
      of heat. The hot sun rose, glared down, slanted to the
      west, and waned. She found no water that sunset. The horses
      had no drink. Milly mixed their oats with water from the
      keg. Hunger exceeded all her sensations, even the pains;
      and tenaciously she clung to her one idea of effort, to
      keep trying, to follow judgment she had made at the outset.
      She ate, and crawled into her wagon-bed, no longer afraid
      of night and loneliness. So tired--so tired she wanted to
      die!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sun awakened her and the will to go on survived.
      The faithful horses waited, whinnying at her approach.
      Mechanically she worked, yet was aware of clumsiness and
      pain; that she must water them that day. The prairie smoked
      with heat. It beckoned, flaunted, slanted to the hot steely
      sky. She closed her eyes and slept with the reins in her
      hands; she awakened to jolt of wagon and crunching of
      stone. Thunder rumbled out of the sky and clouds obscured
      the sun. She drove into a storm, black, windy, with driving
      sheets of cool rain and white zigzag ropes of lightning,
      crashing thunder, long roll across the heavens. She was
      drenched to the skin and strangely refreshed. That fiery
      band round her head had snapped and gone. The horses
      splashed into a buffalo-wallow and drank of the fresh rain
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away the storm rolled, purple clouds and pall of drifting
      gray and sheets of flame. The north showed blue again, and
      presently the sun shone. The horses steamed, the prairie
      smoked. Milly's clothes dried as the gray miles passed
      behind the tireless team.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day's journey ended at a river, and as if her troubles
      need be multiplied, it was unfordable at that point. Milly
      camped. And the morning found her slower, stiffer, yet
      stern to go on. This river, too--could it have been the
      Louisiana Red?--had a northwest trend. All day she followed
      it, often in the shade of trees. No tracks, no trails, no
      old camps--the region was like a luxuriant barren land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning she found a disused buffalo ford. The tracks
      were old. They stirred her sluggish blood, her submerged
      hopes. She gained a little therefrom. If only she could
      drop the reins and rest her hands, her arms! But the
      faithful horses had to be guided. Would she ever come to a
      road? Was this whole world devoid of the manifestations of
      travel? Miles and miles, as gray, as monotonous as a dead
      sea!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she drove into a zone of buffalo carcasses, and was
      startled into wonder, hope, wild thought. Where was she?
      Fifty--maybe a hundred miles east of the Staked Plain, and
      still lost! These carcasses were black and dried; they had
      no odor; they were ghastly heaps of bones and hides. She
      drove ten miles across this belt of death and decay; and no
      sign of horse or wagon cheered her aching sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly lost track of hours, days, time. Sunset, a camp by
      water, black night with hateful stars, the false dawn, day
      with its gray leagues and blistering sun, the white horses
      forever moving on and on and on, night, blackness, light
      once more, and horrible weary pangs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"What's this?"</i> cried Milly, and wide flew her eyes.
      She was lying back in the wagon, where she had fallen from
      faintness. She remembered. It had been early morning. But
      now the sun was high. The wagon creaked, swayed, moved on
      to strange accompaniment--<i>clip-clop, clip-clop,
      clip-clop.</i> The horses were trotting on hard road. Was
      she dreaming? She closed her eyes the better to listen.
      Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop! This was no lying trick of
      her jaded ears, worn out from silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--thank Heaven!" panted Milly. "It's a road--a road!"
      And she struggled to rise. Gray endless prairie, as always,
      but split to the horizon by a white hard road! She
      staggered to the seat. But driving was not necessary. The
      reins were looped round the brake. Whity and Specks needed
      no guidance now, no urging, no help. They were on the
      homeward stretch. With steady clip-clop they trotted,
      clicking off the miles. Whity was lame and Specks had a
      clanging shoe, but these were small matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly sank down overwhelmed with joy. On the Fort Elliott
      road! The Llano Estacado showed no longer the deceiving
      purple of distance. It showed gray and drab, shadowy
      clefts, rock wall and canyons. She forced herself to eat
      and drink, though the dried meat and bread were hard to
      swallow. She must brace up. Many were the buffalo-hunters
      who traveled this road. Surely before the hour was gone she
      would see a white wagon on the horizon. Milly lifted her
      head to gaze backward, toward the south, and then forward
      toward the north. The prairie was still a lonely land. Yet
      how different!
    </p>
    <p>
      She rested, she thought, she gazed the hours away; and
      something came back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afternoon waned and sunset came; and with the fading of
      rosy and golden light the horses snorted their scent of
      water. Milly was stronger. Hope had wonderfully revived
      her. And she called to the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another horizon line reached! It was the crest of one of
      the prairie slopes. Long had it been unattainable, hiding
      while it beckoned onward. A green-mantled stream crossed
      just below. Milly's aching and exhausted heart throbbed to
      sudden recognition. She had camped here. She knew those
      cottonwoods. And strong sweet wine of renewed life fired
      her veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whity and Specks remembered. This was the cold sweet water
      from the uplands, well loved by the buffalo. They snorted
      and lifted dusty, shaggy hoofs, to plod on and stop. Milly
      looked down on the green bank where Catlee had voiced his
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Another sunset, one of gold and red out of purple clouds,
      burned over the prairie-land. The sloping shadows crept
      along the distant valleys; the grassy undulating expanse
      shone with dusky fire. And a winding river, like a bright
      thread, lost itself in the far dim reaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly Fayre drove Whity and Specks across the cattle-dotted
      pasture which flanked the river banks outside of Sprague's
      Post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horses mingled with the cattle. Between the road and the
      cottonwoods camps sent up their curling columns of blue
      smoke. Tents gleamed rosily in the sunset glow. Dogs ran
      out to herald the coming of another team. Curious
      buffalo-hunters, on the way south, dropped out to halt
      Milly. Natives of the Post strolled across from the store
      to question the traveler from the buffalo fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Howdy, sonny!" greeted a white-haired old Westerner, with
      keen blue eyes flashing over weary horses, and wagon with
      its single occupant. "All by yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied Milly, amazed to hear her husky voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men crowded closer, kindly, interested, beginning to
      wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whar you from?" queried the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pease River," replied Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, say now, sonny, you're--" Then he checked his query
      and came closer, to lay a hand on the smoking horse nearest
      to him. The rugged faces, some bronzed, some with the
      paleness that was not long of the prairie, were lifted to
      Milly. They seemed beautiful, so full of life, kindness,
      interrogation. They dimmed in Milly's sight, through her
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Pease River," she replied, hurriedly and low. "My
      outfit fought--killed one another. . . . Comanches swam the
      river. . . . I drove Whity and Specks through the brakes. .
      . . The Indians chased us. . . . We ran into stampeded
      buffalo. . . . Driven all day--surrounded--dust and roar. .
      . . Oh, it was terrible! . . . But they slowed up--they
      carried us all day--forty miles. . . . Since then I've
      camped and driven--camped and driven, days, days, days, I
      don't--know--how--many!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence ensued after Milly's long poignant speech. Then
      the old Westerner scratched his beard in perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sonny, air you jest foolin' us or jest out of your haid?
      You shore look fagged out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's--gospel--truth," panted Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My boy," began the kindly interrogator, with graver voice,
      and again his keen gaze swept over grimy horses and
      travel-worn wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boy!" exclaimed Milly, as spiritedly as her huskiness
      would permit. "I'm no boy! . . . I'm a girl--Milly Fayre."
    </p>
    <p>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Tom raised himself as high as he dared and studied what he
      could see of the field in the direction of the bluff. A man
      might trust himself boldly to that jumble of rocks.
      Accordingly he crawled on hands and knees to the end of
      this stone-like corral, and there, stretching on his left
      side, with left hand extended and right dragging his rifle,
      he crawled as swiftly and noiselessly as possible. He
      peered only ahead of him. There was no use to look at the
      aisles between the rocks at the right and left, because he
      had to pass these openings, and looking was not going to
      help him. Trusting to luck and daring he went on, somehow
      conscious of a grim exultance in the moment. Fear had left
      him. At the outset he had a few thoughts of himself--that
      he could only die once, and if he had to do so now it would
      be for his comrades. Milly Fayre's dark haunting eyes
      crossed his memory, a stabbing, regretful pain; and for her
      he would have embraced any peril. Some way these Comanches
      had been the cause of Milly's flight, if they had not
      caught her. To them he owed loss of her. And he wanted to
      kill some of them. But all he asked was luck and strength
      enough to get back with the water. After those few flashing
      thoughts all his senses were fixed on the physical task
      ahead of him. He had to go swiftly and noiselessly, without
      rest. His efforts were supreme, sustained. Coming back he
      would adhere to Pilchuck's advice, but on the way out he
      could not take it, except in the matter of laying a line of
      small stones as he progressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first ten or a dozen rods were behind him there
      came an easing of a terrible strain. His comrades behind
      him were shooting now something like a volley, which action
      he knew was Pilchuck's way of diverting possible discovery
      from him. The Indians were shooting more, too; and he began
      to draw considerably away from the cross-fire. He heard no
      more bullets whiz over his head. As it was impossible to
      crawl in a straight line, owing to rocks impeding his
      progress, he deviated from the course set by Pilchuck. This
      entailed a necessity of lifting himself every few moments
      so that he could peep over the rocks to keep the direction
      of the bluff. These wary brief actions were fraught with
      suspense. They exposed him perilously, but were absolutely
      imperative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bolder he grew. He was going to succeed in this venture.
      The sustained exertion threatened collapse, yet he still
      had strength to go on. A few more rods might safely earn
      rest! The burning sun beat down pitilessly. Tom's tongue
      hung out, dripping a white froth. His heart expanded as if
      trying to burst bands of steel. Despite the sternest
      passion of will he could not help the low gasping intake of
      air or the panting expulsion. A listening Indian within
      fifty yards could have heard him. But he kept on. His wet
      hand and wrist gathered a grimy covering of dust. His rifle
      grew slippery from sweat from his other hand. Rocks
      obstructing his advance, the narrow defiles he had to
      squeeze through, the hard sharp edges tearing his shirt,
      the smell of the hot earth, the glaring sun--all seemed
      obstacles that put the fact of Indians in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Tom lost his direction. He was coming to a zone more
      open, and surely not far from the bluff that was his
      objective point. Usually he had chosen a high and large
      stone from which to peep. At this juncture not one of such
      size was available. Low down along the side of a flat stone
      he peered out. All he could see was a rather wide space,
      not thickly studded with rocks. But from that angle the
      bluff was not in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost spent from his long crawl, with both muscle and will
      about played out, he raised himself to locate the bluff.
      Not on the right side! Dropping down, he crawled the few
      feet to the left end of this rock, and kneeling sidewise he
      raised himself again to look over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something like a sharp puff of wind whipped by. He heard a
      hiss. Then he felt a shock, solid, terrific, followed by a
      tearing burning pain across his back. Almost the same
      instant came the bursting crack of a rifle. Swift as light
      Tom's sight took in the open ahead. A half-naked Indian,
      red skinned, snake-like, stood with smoking rifle, a wild
      and savage expectation on his dark face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom fell flat behind the rock, all the power of his mind in
      supreme and flashing conflict against the stunning
      surprise. It galvanized him. One second he gripped his
      rifle hard, cocked it, while his muscles gathered and
      strung for a mighty effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom leaped up and shot in the same action. It seemed he did
      not see the Indian clearly until after the discharge of the
      rifle. The Indian's gun was leveled. But it flew aside,
      strangely, as if propelled. And on the same instant there
      was a metallic crack. Tom's bullet had struck the breach of
      the Indian's gun and had glanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian gasped and staggered. He seemed to push his gun
      away from him. It fell to the ground. Blood gushed from his
      mouth. He had been mortally wounded. His dark face was
      terrible to look upon. He was swaying, yet he snatched out
      a knife and made at Tom. A black flame of hate burned from
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second Tom stood transfixed. The Indian came lurching
      with the knife. Then Tom jumped just in time to avoid its
      sweep. Horror gave place to fury. He had no time to reload,
      so he whirled his rifle, making a club of it. But he missed
      the Indian, and such was the force of the blow he had aimed
      that he nearly lost his balance. As it was he righted
      himself to find the Indian lunging down with the knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a flash Tom's left hand caught the descending wrist
      and gripped it. Then he tried to swing the rifle with his
      right. But the Indian intercepted the blow and held the
      rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus on the moment both were rendered helpless to force the
      issue. They held each other grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--weyno!" gasped the Indian, thickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comanche! You're--no good--yourself!" panted Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a deadlock. Tom exerted himself to the utmost to
      hold that quivering blade back from his body. He saw the
      advantage was on his side. Blood poured from a wound in the
      Indian's throat. The nearness of it, the terrible nature of
      the moment, the unabatable ferocity and courage of his red
      adversary were almost too much for Tom. He all but sank
      under the strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a sudden shuddering convulsion on the part of the
      Indian, a last supreme effort. It was so great that it
      broke Tom's hold. But even as the Indian wrenched free his
      strength failed. The corded strung muscles suddenly
      relaxed. His working, fiercely malignant visage as suddenly
      set somberly. He dropped the knife. He swayed and fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom bent over him. The Indian gazed upward, conscious. Then
      the hate in his dark eyes gave way to a blankness. He was
      dead. Tom stared, slowly realizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment more he was alive to the situation. He had
      conquered here. But he was not yet out of danger. Still, if
      any Indians had seen this encounter they would have shot
      him before this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crouching down, Tom peered round until he had again located
      his objective point. Then he ran as fast as his spent
      strength permitted and soon reached the red bluff. But he
      did not locate the hiding place of the horses until Jake
      Devine saw him and called. Tom staggered round the bluff
      and into the pocket where the horses were concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Devine came rattling down from a ledge where evidently he
      had been watching. Then Al Thorndyke, the other guard,
      appeared from the opposite quarter. They ran to Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, you're all bloody!" declared Jake, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, I seen thet fight," added Thorndyke, sharply. "But I
      couldn't shoot fer fear of hittin' you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm hit--I don't know--how bad," panted Tom. "But it
      can't--be very bad. . . . Hurry, boys. I came after water.
      Tie me up. I've got to rustle back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll shore go with you," said Devine.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tore Tom's shirt off. It was wringing wet and as red
      as a flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon you sweat a heap," put in Thorndyke, encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom winced as one of them ran a finger in the wound on his
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothin' bad. Long deep cut," said Devine. "Fetch water,
      Al."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men washed Tom's wound and bandaged it tightly with
      a scarf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got to take some canteens back," declared Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go. You stay with Al," replied Devine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, I ain't a-goin' to stay. I've got to git in thet
      fight," asserted Thorndyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to the shootin'," exclaimed Devine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom heard a rattling volley of Creedmoors, punctuated by
      the sharper, lighter cracking of Winchesters. It was
      certainly an exciting sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I wasn't told to fetch you," protested Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thet don't make no difference. What's the use of us hidin'
      here? If the Comanches found us we couldn't hold the
      horses. We'd just be goners. Out there we can git in the
      fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Devine's logic was unanswerable. So Tom made no further
      objection. The three men took two canteens each, and their
      rifles, and hurried forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom led the way. It was easy walking, but when he reached
      the point where he thought it needful to stoop, the hard
      work commenced. The heavy canteens swung round and hung
      from his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the spot where he had fought the Comanche, and
      here he crouched down. Devine and Thorndyke came up with
      him. The Indian lay stark--his eyes wide open--his hands
      spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fellars, I'll fetch thet Indian's gun an' belt," said
      Devine, practically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom wondered how Devine could pack these in addition to the
      load he already carried. But the stocky little man appeared
      equal to the occasion. Soon Tom lay flat to crawl like a
      snake. It was well that he had laid a trail. Tom kept the
      lead, ten feet in front of Thorndyke, who was a like
      distance ahead of Devine. Tom had to stop every little
      while to rest. His lungs appeared to stand the test, but
      his muscles were weak. Still he knew he could make the
      distance. The long drink of water he had taken had revived
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever Tom halted to rest he would listen to the
      shooting. His followers would creep up to him and make some
      comment. They were eager to join the fray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, I reckon you're tuckered out," whispered Thorndyke,
      on the last of these occasions. "But do your damndest. For
      we're shore needed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus admonished, Tom did not rest again, though he crawled
      less violently, trying to husband what strength he had
      left. The return had not been so exciting, and for that
      reason was harder work. It was different. Nothing but
      bullets could have stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had crawled close to where Pilchuck and his men were
      shooting, and therefore within the zone of the Indians'
      fire, when a bullet kicked up the dust in front of Tom. He
      hesitated. Then a bullet clipped the crown of his hat. This
      spurred him to a spasmodic scrambling forward to cover
      behind a bowlder. From there Tom squirmed round to look
      back. Jake Devine was kneeling with leveled rifle, which on
      the instant belched fire and smoke. Jake dropped down and
      crawled forward. His face was black and his eyes blazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thet redskin is feed fer lizards," he said, grimly. "Go
      on, Tom."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom recalled the fact that Devine was a frontiersman, used
      to fighting Indians. So he crawled on, inspired by a sense
      of such companionship. Bullets now began to sing and hum
      overhead, and to spang from the rocks. Jake prodded Tom's
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, you're slower'n molasses," said Jake, "Reckon you
      don't mind this sort of thing. But, by golly! I'm scared.
      An' Al is hangin' on to my boots."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes Jake would give Tom a shove, rooting his face in
      the dust. "Crawl, you belly-whopper!" he whispered, gayly.
      And then he would call back to Thorndyke. "Come on, Al.
      Dy'e you want to git plugged all to yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Tom and his comrades reached the smoky place that
      marked Pilchuck's position.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ain't hankerin' fer this part of the job," said Devine.
      "Suppose they take us fer redskins."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pilchuck was too wise a leader to allow blunders of
      that nature. He was on the lookout, and his grimy, sweaty,
      stern face relaxed at sight of Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore was good work, Tom," he said. "It's next door to
      hell here. Hurry to Ory an' Roberts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom hurried to where the young man lay, under a sunshade
      Roberts had rigged up with his shirt and a stick. Roberts
      gave Tom a husky greeting. Manifestly his voice was almost
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ory's face was pale and clammy. When Tom lifted his head he
      opened his eyes and tried to speak. But he could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ory, here's water," said Tom, and held a canteen to the
      boy's pale lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never until that moment had Tom appreciated the
      preciousness of water. He watched Ory drink, and had his
      reward in the wan smile of gratitude. "Much obliged, Tom,"
      whispered Ory, and lay back with a strange look. Then he
      shut his eyes and appeared to relax. Tom did not like the
      uneasy impression he received on the moment, but in the
      excitement he did not think any more about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roberts handed the canteen to the other wounded fellow and
      watched him drink. Then he slaked his own thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say!" he ejaculated, with a deep breath. "Thet shore was
      all I needed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The white-headed old plainsman crawled over for his share.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Son, them canteens will lick Nigger Horse," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! Are we fighting that chief?" queried Tom, in amaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Accordin' to Pilchuck we're doin' jest that," responded
      the plainsman, cheerfully. "Old Nigger an' a thousand of
      his redskins, more or less."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tom crawled to the vantage point behind the rock he
      had used before, and gave himself up to this phase of the
      fight. It did not take longer than a moment to realize what
      Pilchuck had meant. There was scarcely a second without its
      boom of Creedmoor or crack of Winchester. A little cloud of
      white smoke hung above every bowlder. Tom exercised the
      utmost vigilance in the matter of exposing himself to the
      Indians' fire. He was almost spent, and suffering
      excruciating pain from his wound. How infernally hot the
      sun burned down! His rifle and the stones were as fire to
      his hands. But as he began to peer out for an Indian to
      shoot at, and worked back into the fight, he forgot his
      pangs, and then what had seemed the intolerable conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom grew intensely absorbed in his own little part in this
      battle. With the smell of gunpowder and smoke clogging his
      nostrils, with the thunder of the Creedmoors behind him,
      with the circling rattle of the Winchesters out there in
      the hot haze of the sun, he gave them but vague attention.
      He applied himself to an intent watchfulness, and a swift
      aim and shot at every moving thing in the direction he
      covered. It grew to be a grim duel between him and Indians
      he knew saw him. Like him they had to expose themselves
      somewhat to get in a shot. But as it was imperative to be
      swift their aim was necessarily erring. Nevertheless,
      bullets spat the dust from Tom's rock, sometimes within a
      few inches of his head. What a tingling sense of justice
      and deadly wrath these roused in Tom! It made the fight
      even. He welcomed these bullets, because they justified his
      own. He caught glimpses of shiny rifle barrels, of black
      sleek heads, of flashes of brown; and toward these,
      whenever possible, he directed his aim. Whether or not he
      ever hit his mark he could not tell. But he believed his
      bullets were making it hot for several Comanches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the pitch of the fight augmented, until it was
      raging with a reckless fury on part of the Comanches, and a
      desperate resistance on that of the besieged. Sooner or
      later Tom was forced to realize in his own reactions the
      fact that the fighting and the peril had increased to an
      alarming extent. A stinging bullet crease in his shoulder
      was the first awakening shock he sustained. He had answered
      to the Indians' growing recklessness. He had been exposing
      himself more and redoubling his fire. He had missed Indians
      slipping stealthily from bowlder to bowlder--opportunities
      that only intense excitement and haste had made him fail to
      grasp. Then, when he crouched back, forced to cover, aghast
      at this second wound, he became fully aware of the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Comanches had pressed closer and closer, now better
      concealed by the pall of smoke that overhung the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold your fire! Look out for a charge!" yelled Pilchuck in
      stentorian voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The booming of Creedmoors ceased, and that permitted a
      clearer distinguishing of the Indians' fire. Their
      Winchesters were rattling in a continuous volley, and a
      hail of lead whistled over and into the bowlder corral.
      Manifestly the Indians had massed on the west side, between
      Starwell's position and Pilchuck's. This occasioned the
      leader to draw up his men in line with Tom's fortification.
      Closer and hotter grew the Indians' fire. Through the blue
      haze of smoke and heat Tom saw dim swiftly moving shapes,
      like phantoms. They were Comanches, gliding from covert to
      covert, and leaping from bowlder to bowlder. Tom's heart
      seemed to choke him. If the Indians were in strong enough
      force they would effect a massacre of Pilchuck's men.
      Suddenly, as Tom dwelt fearfully on such contingency, the
      firing abruptly ceased. A silence fraught with suspense
      ensued, strange after the heavy shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a trick. Look sharp!" Pilchuck warned his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, seein' this fight's ag'in' the exterminatin' of the
      buffalo, I reckon old Nigger Horse will do or die," said
      Jake Devine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you'd ask me I'd say these hoss-ridin' redskins was up
      to their last dodge on foot," averred the old white-headed
      plainsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out it's not <i>our</i> last dodge," replied
      Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he spoken when the Indians opened up with a
      heavy volley at alarmingly close range. Pilchuck shouted an
      order that was not intelligible in the cracking of
      firearms. But only its content was needed. The big buffalo
      guns answered with a roar. In another moment the firing
      became so fast and furious that it blended as a continuous
      thundering in Tom's ears. He saw the rush of the Indians,
      incredibly swift and vague through the smoke, and he worked
      his rifle so hard that it grew hot. Above the roar of guns
      he heard the strange ear-splitting yell of the Comanches.
      Almost at the same instant smoke veiled the scene, more to
      the advantage of the white men than the red. The Creedmoors
      thundered as continuously as before, and the volume of
      sound must have been damning to the desperate courage of
      the Comanches. Perhaps they had not counted on so strong a
      force and resistance. Their war-cry pealed to a shrill
      pitch and ceased; and following that the rattling volleys
      fell off. Then Pilchuck ordered his men to stop shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom saw the old white-haired plainsman stand up and survey
      the smoke-hazed slope. Then he dropped down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fellars, they're draggin' off their dead an' crippled," he
      said. "They're licked, an' we ought to chase them clear to
      their hosses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right," replied Pilchuck, grimly. "But wait till we're
      sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom could not see anything of the retreat, if such it was.
      The smoke mantle was lifting above the bowlders. With the
      sudden release of strain the men reacted according to their
      individual natures. Those new to such fighting were silent,
      as was Tom, and lay flat. Jake Devine was loquacious in his
      complaints that he had not downed any Comanches. The old
      plainsman urged Pilchuck to chase the Indians. Then when
      the receding fire of the enemy ceased altogether Tom heard
      yells close at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Harkaway," said the scout, eagerly, and he called
      out a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Harkaway and his men came stooping and crawling to
      join Pilchuck. They were panting from exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boss--they're--workin' down," he said, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mebbe it's a trick," replied the wary scout. "I'll sneak
      out an' take a look."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom drew back from his position and eased his cramped
      limbs. His shirt was wet with blood. Examination showed his
      second bullet wound to be a slight one, but exceedingly
      annoying. He got Devine to tie it up, running a scarf under
      his arm and over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, a couple more scratches will make an old residenter
      out of you, Tom," he said, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was about to make some fitting reply when Pilchuck
      returned in haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men, it's goin' to be our day," he said, his gray eyes
      alight with piercing intensity. "If we rout old Nigger
      Horse it'll be the first victory for the whites in this
      buffalo war. Us hunters will have done what the soldiers
      couldn't do. . . . Harkaway, you stay here with two of your
      men to guard these cripples. All the rest of you grab extra
      cartridges an' follow me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was not the last to get his hands into that cartridge
      bag, nor to fall in line after the scout. Once out of the
      zone of smoke, he was thrilled to see Indians disappearing
      over the edge of the slope. There was a good deal of
      shooting below, and the unmistakable booming reports told
      of Creedmoors in action. From the sound Tom judged Starwell
      had changed his position. But this could not be ascertained
      for sure until the brow of the slope was reached. Pilchuck
      advanced cautiously, gradually growing bolder as ambush
      appeared less probable, and the time came when he broke
      into a run.
    </p>
    <p>
      "String out, an' come fast," he called back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom fell in behind Jake Devine, and keeping some paces back
      he attended to the difficulty of running over the rough
      ground. Thus it was he did not look up until he reached the
      edge of the slope. Here he found Pilchuck and some of the
      men in a group, gazing, talking, and gesticulating all at
      once. Tom's breast was heaving from the hard run. He was
      hot and wet. But it was certain that a reviving thrill ran
      over him. The Comanches were in retreat. There was no doubt
      of that. It was still an orderly retreat, with a line of
      warriors guarding the rear. Tom saw Indians dragging and
      carrying their wounded and dead; others were gathering in
      the horses; and the mass was centered in the middle of the
      encampment, where there were signs of great haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one Pilchuck's arriving men added to the group on
      the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Starwell has the idea," declared Pilchuck. "See. He's
      moved this way an' down. He can still cover that gate an'
      also reach the camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jude, we shore hev our chance now," spoke up the old
      white-haired plainsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon," replied the scout. "Now listen, men. When I
      give the word we'll charge down this hill. Each an' every
      one of you yell like the devil, run a dozen jumps, drop
      down on your knee an' shoot. Then load, get up, an' do the
      same over again. Head for that pile of rocks this side of
      Starwell's position."
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence followed the scout's trenchant speech. Then ensued
      a tightening of belts, a clinking of cartridges, a rasping
      of the mechanism of the Creedmoors. Tom was all ready,
      quivering for the word, yet glad of a few moments' rest.
      Pilchuck and the old plainsman stood close together, keen
      eyes on the Indian encampment. The sun was low over the
      escarpment to the west and it was losing its heat. The
      canyon seemed full of golden lights and blue haze, through
      which flashed and gleamed moving objects, horses, Indians,
      collapsing tepees, a colorful and exciting scene. The rear
      guard of Indians backed slowly to the center of the
      encampment. Their horses were being brought in readiness.
      Tom could not help but see the execution of a shrewd Indian
      brain. Still, there were signs of a possible panic. Already
      the Comanches had suffered in this fight, as was manifested
      by the number of those incapacitated, and which had to be
      packed off. Already the far slope of the canyon was covered
      by ponies dragging travois.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden breaking up of the rear guard, as these Indians
      leaped for their horses, was a signal for Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charge, men!" he yelled, harshly, and plunged down the
      slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hi, fellars," shouted Jake Devine, "old Nigger Horse is my
      meat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment Pilchuck's men were spread out on the jump,
      yelling like fiends and brandishing their weapons. Tom was
      well to the fore, close behind Devine and Pilchuck. Their
      heavy boots sent the loose stones flying and rattling down
      the hill. White puffs of smoke showed suddenly down in the
      encampment and were followed by the rattle of Winchesters.
      Presently Pilchuck plunged to a halt and, kneeling, leveled
      his Creedmoor. His action was swiftly followed by his men.
      His Creedmoor boomed; that of Devine and the plainsman
      next, and then the others thundered in unison. It was a
      long range-shot and Tom aimed generally at the commotion in
      the encampment. Pandemonium broke loose down there. All
      order seemed to vanish in a rushing <i>mêlée.</i> Pilchuck
      leaped up with a hoarse command, which his men answered in
      wild exulting whoops. And they plunged again down the
      slope, faster, rendered reckless by the success of their
      boldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom felt himself a part of that charging line of furious
      buffalo-hunters, and had imbibed the courage of the mass.
      Like the others, he had calculated on the Indians charging
      back to meet them, thus precipitating a pitched battle. But
      this was not the case. The Indians began returning the fire
      from all parts of the canyon. It was a hasty action,
      however, and did not appear formidable. They were now bent
      on escape. That gave irresistible momentum to the charge of
      Pilchuck's force. Starwell and his men, seeing the Indians
      routed, left their covert and likewise plunged down, firing
      and yelling as never before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom, following the example of the men before him, ran and
      knelt and fired four times in rapid succession on the way
      down to the level floor of the canyon. By this time all the
      Indians were mounted and the mass of them abandoned the
      idea of a slow climb up the opposite slope. They broke for
      the canyon gate. This meant they had to lessen the long
      range between them and Pilchuck's force, a fact that did
      not daunt them. Their lean, racy mustangs were quickly in a
      running stride, and each rider was presenting a rifle
      toward the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "HOLD HERE, MEN!" bawled Pilchuck, stridently. "If they
      charge us take to the rocks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom no longer heard the bang of any individual gun, not
      even his own. And he was loading and firing as fast as
      possible. A roar filled his ears, and the ground seemed to
      shake with the furious trample of the mustangs racing by.
      How long and low they stretched out--how lean and wild
      their riders! What matchless horsemen these Comanches! Even
      in the hot grip of that fighting moment Tom thrilled at the
      magnificent defiance of these Indians, courting death by
      that ride, to save their burdened comrades climbing the
      slope. Some of them met that death. Tom saw riders throw up
      their arms and pitch headlong to the ground. Mustangs
      leaped high, in convulsive action, and plunged down to roll
      over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom seemed aware of the thinning of Pilchuck's ranks. And
      when the order came to run down the canyon to prevent a
      possible massacre of Starwell and men, who had impetuously
      advanced too far, some were left behind. From that moment
      Tom lost clear perception of the progress of the fight. The
      blood rage that obsessed the frontiersmen was communicated
      to him. He plunged with the others; he felt their nearness;
      he heard their hoarse yells and the boom of their guns; but
      he seemed to be fighting alone for the sake of the fight
      itself. The last of that mounted band of Comanches swooped
      across toward Starwell's men, driving them to the rocks.
      Pilchuck's force, charging down the level, came abreast of
      them, and there in the open a terrible, brief, and decisive
      battle ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Comanches had not halted in the face of the booming
      Creedmoors there would have been an end to Pilchuck's
      buffalo-hunters. They would have been run down. But the
      Indians were not equal to victory at such cost. They shot
      as they had ridden, furiously, without direct attention. As
      for the white men, fury made them only the more efficient.
      They advanced, yelling, cursing, shooting and loading as
      men possessed of devils. The smoke and din seemed to
      envelop Tom. His gun scorched his hands and powder burned
      his face. When he reloaded he seemed to reel and fumble
      over his breech-lock. The compact mass of Indians
      disintegrated to strings and streams, vague, not so close,
      lean wild savage figures hard to aim at. Then something
      struck Tom and the vagueness became obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Tom returned to consciousness he felt a dull pain, and
      a thickness of mind that did not permit him to establish a
      clear conception of his whereabouts or what had happened.
      He was being carried; voices of men fell upon his ears;
      daylight seemed fading into a red duskiness. A blankness
      intervened, then again he dizzily awoke. He was lying on
      his back and a dark bluff rose above him. Then he became
      aware of cold water being dashed in his face, and a
      familiar voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom's not bad hurt," said Jake Devine. "Thet last bullet
      bounded off'n his skull. He shore is a hard-headed fellar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw! I reckon I'm glad," replied Pilchuck. "Looked to me
      like he'd gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nope. He'll come round tip-top. . . . I'm a son-of-a-gun
      if he ain't come to right now! Hey, Tom!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm all right, thanks," said Tom, weakly. "How'd we make
      out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Devine began an eloquent account of how they had
      stood off Nigger Horse and two hundred braves, had whipped
      them, and finally routed them completely with a
      considerable loss. But Devine omitted to mention what
      Pilchuck's force had suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though feeling considerable pain and much weakness through
      loss of blood, Tom was able to eat a little, after which
      effort he fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daylight brought clear consciousness to him, and one glance
      round at his lame and bandaged comrades gave an inkling of
      what the victory over Nigger Horse had cost. Not a man had
      escaped at least one wound! Burn Hudnall had escaped
      serious injury. Tom missed familiar faces. But he did not
      make inquiries then. He submitted to a painful treatment of
      his wounds. Then he was glad enough to lie quietly with
      closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later that morning he had strength enough to mount his
      horse and ride with the slow procession back to the
      permanent camp. He made it, but prayed he would have no
      more such ordeals. The shady, cool camp with its running
      water was a most soothing relief. One by one the injured
      were made comfortable. It was then Tom learned that seven
      of Pilchuck's force had been killed in the fight. Ory Tacks
      had been the first to succumb. Thus Tom had verification of
      his fears. Poor, brave, cheerful Ory! These heroic men
      would find graves on the spot where they had helped to
      break forever the backbone of the Comanches' hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck visited with the injured men that day. His
      sternness had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boys," he said, "I never expected any of us to get out of
      that fight alive. When those yellin' devils charged us I
      thought the game was up. We did well, but we were mighty
      lucky. It's sad about our comrades. But some of us had to
      go an' we were all ready. Now the great good truth is that
      this victory will rouse the buffalo-hunters. I'll go after
      more men. We'll shore chase the Comanches an' Kiowas off
      the Staked Plain, an' that will leave us free to hunt
      buffalo. What's more important, it will make Texas safe for
      settlers. So you can all feel proud, as I do. The
      buffalo-hunters will go down in history as havin' made
      Texas habitable."

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In 1876 more than two hundred thousand buffalo hides were
      shipped east over the Santa Fe Railroad, and hundreds of
      thousands in addition went north from Fort Worth, Texas.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this great number of hides that reached eastern and
      foreign markets there were at least twice the number of
      hides sacrificed on the range. Old buffalo-hunters
      generally agreed on the causes for this lamentable fact.
      Inexperienced hunters did not learn to poison the hides,
      which were soon destroyed by hide bugs. Then as many
      buffalo were crippled as killed outright and skinned, and
      these wounded ones stole away to die in coulees or the
      brakes of the rivers. Lastly, a large percentage of buffalo
      were chased by hunters into the quagmires and quicksands
      along the numerous streams, there to perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      1877 saw the last of the raids by Comanches and Kiowas, a
      condition brought round solely by the long campaign of
      united bands of buffalo-hunters, who chased and fought
      these Indians all over the Staked Plain. But this campaign
      was really a part of the destruction of the buffalo, and
      that destruction broke forever the strength of these
      hard-riding Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the winter and spring of that year the number of
      hide-hunting outfits doubled and trebled and quadrupled;
      and from the Red River to the Brazos, over that immense
      tract of Texas prairie, every river, stream, pond,
      water-hole and spring, everywhere buffalo could drink, was
      ambushed by hunters with heavy guns. The poor animals that
      were not shot down had to keep on traveling until the time
      came when a terrible parching thirst made them mad. Then,
      when in their wanderings to find some place to drink, they
      scented water, they would stampede, and in their madness to
      assuage an insupportable thirst, would plunge over one
      another in great waves, crushing to death those underneath.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Doan, during the year and a half of the Indian raids,
      fought through three campaigns against Comanches, Kiowas,
      and Llano Estacado Apaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck's first organizing of buffalo-hunters into a unit
      to fight Comanches drove the wedge that split the Indians;
      and likewise it inspired and roused the hide-hunters from
      the Territory line to the Rio Grande. Thus there was a war
      on the several tribes, as well as continued slaughter of
      the buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring of 1877, when, according to the scouts, the
      backbone of the Southwest raiding tribes had been broken,
      Tom Doan bade good-by to Burn Hudnall, his friend and
      comrade for so long. Dave Stronghurl had months before gone
      back to Sprague's Post to join his wife, and Burn, now that
      the campaign had ended, wanted to see his wife and people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon I'm even with the Comanches," he said, grimly.
      That was his only reference to his father's murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Burn, we've seen wild life," mused Tom, sadly. "I'm
      glad I helped rout the Comanches. They've been robbed, I
      suppose, and I can't blame them. But they sure made a man's
      blood boil for a fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What'll you do, Tom?" queried Burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doan dropped his head. "It'd hurt too much to go back to
      Sprague's Post--just yet. You see, Burn, I can't forget
      Milly. Of course she's dead long ago. But then, sometimes I
      see her in dreams, and she seems alive. I'd like to learn
      the truth of her fate. Some day I might. Pilchuck and I are
      going south to the Brazos. The last great hunt is on
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm goin' to settle on a ranch at Sprague's," said Burn.
      "Father always said that would be center of a fine cattle
      an' farmin' district some day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I remember. It used to be my dream, too. But I'm
      changed. This roving life, I guess. The open range for me
      yet a while! Some day I'll come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, you've money saved," returned Burn, thoughtfully.
      "You could buy an' stock a ranch. Isn't it risky carryin'
      round all your money? There's worse than bad Comanches now
      in the huntin' field."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've thought of that," said Tom. "It does seem risky. So
      I'll ask you to take most of my money and bank it for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a good idea. But see here, old man, suppose you don't
      come back? You know, we've seen things happen to strong an'
      capable men down here. Think how lucky we've been!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've thought of that, too," said Tom, with gravity. "If I
      don't show up inside of five years invest the money for
      your children. Money's not much to me any more. . . . But
      I'm likely to come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      This conversation took place at Wheaton's camp, on the
      headwaters of the Red River, in April. A great exodus of
      freighters was taking place that day. It was interesting
      for Tom to note the development of the hide hauling. The
      wagons were large and had racks and booms, so that when
      loaded they resembled hay wagons, except in color. Two
      hundred buffalo hides to a wagon, and six yokes of oxen to
      a team and twenty-five teams to a train! Swiftly indeed
      were the buffalo disappearing from the plains. Burn Hudnall
      rode north with one of these immense freighting outfits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom and Pilchuck made preparations for an extended hunt in
      the Brazos River country, whence emanated rumors somewhat
      similar to the gold rumors of '49.
    </p>
    <p>
      While choosing and arranging an outfit they were visited by
      a brawny little man with a most remarkable visage. It was
      scarred with records of both the sublime and the
      ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm after wantin' to throw in with you," he announced to
      Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scout, used to judging men in a glance, evidently saw
      service and character in this fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, we need a man, that's shore. But he must be
      experienced," returned the scout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nary tenderfoot, scout, not no more," he grinned. "I've
      killed an' skinned over four thousands buffs. An' I'm a
      blacksmith an' a cook."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, I reckon you're a whole outfit in yourself," rejoined
      Pilchuck, with his rare broad smile. "How do you want to
      throw in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Share expense of outfit, work, an' profit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothin' could be no more fair. I reckon we'll be right
      glad to have you. What's your handle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wrong-Wheel Jones," replied the applicant, as if he
      expected that cognomen to be recognized.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the hell! I've met Buffalo Jones, an' Dirty-Face
      Jones an' Spike Jones, but I never heard of you. . . .
      Wrong-Wheel Jones! Where'd you ever get that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was stuck on me my first hunt when I was sorta
      tenderfooty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, tell me an' my pard here, Tom Doan," continued the
      scout, good-humoredly. "Tom, shake with Wrong-Wheel Jones."
    </p>
    <p>
      After quaintly acknowledging the introduction Jones said:
      "Fust trip I busted a right hind wheel of my wagon. Along
      comes half a dozen outfits, but none had an extra wheel.
      Blake, the leader, told me he'd passed a wagon like mine,
      broke down on the Cimarron. 'Peared it had some good
      wheels. So I harnessed my hosses, rode one an' led t'other.
      I found the wagon, but the <i>left hind wheel</i> was the
      only one not busted. So I rode back to camp. Blake asked me
      why I didn't fetch a wheel back, an' I says: 'What'd I want
      with <i>two</i> left hind wheels? I got one. It's the right
      one thet's busted. Thet left hind wheel back thar on thet
      wagon would do fust rate, but it's on the wrong side.' An'
      Blake an' his outfit roared till they near died. When he
      could talk ag'in he says: 'You darned fool. Thet left hind
      wheel turned round would make your right hind wheel.' An'
      after a while I seen he was right. They called me
      Wrong-Wheel Jones an' the name's stuck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By gosh! it ought to!" laughed Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In company with another outfit belonging to a newcomer
      named Hazelton, with a son of fifteen and two other boys
      not much older, Pilchuck headed for the Brazos River.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an uneventful journey, somewhat off the beaten track,
      they reached one of the many tributaries of the Brazos,
      where they ran into some straggling small herds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll make two-day stops till we reach the main herd,"
      said Pilchuck. "I've a hankerin' for my huntin' alone.
      Reckon hide-hunters are thick as bees down on the Brazos.
      Let's keep out of the stink an' musketeers as long as we
      can."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went into camp, the two outfits not far apart, within
      hailing distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps the most beautiful location for a camp Tom
      had seen in all his traveling over western Texas. Pilchuck
      said the main herd, with its horde of hide-hunters, had
      passed miles east of this point. As a consequence the air
      was sweet, the water unpolluted, and grass and wood
      abundant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brakes of the tributary consisted of groves of pecan trees
      and cottonwoods, where cold springs abounded, and the deep
      pools contained fish. As spring had just come in that
      latitude, there were color of flowers, and fragrance in the
      air, and a myriad of birds lingering on their way north.
      Like the wooded sections of the Red River and the Pease
      River Divide had been, so was this, Brazos district. Deer,
      antelope, turkey, with their carnivorous attendants,
      panthers, wildcats, and wolves, had not yet been molested
      by white hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the Indian campaigns had hardened Tom Doan, for he
      returned to the slaughter of buffalo. He had been so long
      out of the hunting game that he had forgotten many of the
      details, and especially the sentiment that had once moved
      him. Then this wild life in the open had become a habit; it
      clung to a man. Moreover, Tom had an aching and
      ever-present discontent which only action could subdue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a liking to Cherry Hazleton. The boy was a
      strapping youngster, freckle faced and red headed, and like
      all healthy youths of the Middle West during the 'seventies
      he was a worshiper of the frontiersman and Indian fighter.
      He and his young comrades, brothers named Dan and Joe
      Newman, spent what little leisure time they had hanging
      round Pilchuck and Tom, hungry for stories as dogs for
      bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days at this camp did not suffice Pilchuck. Buffalo
      were not excessively numerous, but they were scattered into
      small bands under leadership of old bulls; and for these
      reasons offered the conditions best suited to experienced
      hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third day Tom took Cherry Hazleton hunting with him,
      allowing him to carry canteen and extra cartridges while
      getting valuable experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buffalo in small numbers were in sight everywhere, but as
      this country was rolling and cut up, unlike the Pease
      prairie, it was not possible to locate all the herds that
      might be within reaching distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In several hours of riding and stalking Tom had not found a
      position favorable to any extended success, though he had
      downed some buffalo, and young Hazleton, after missing a
      number, had finally killed his first, a fine bull. The boy
      was wild with excitement, and this brought back to Tom his
      early experience, now seemingly so long in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now on a creek that ran through a wide stretch of
      plain, down to the tributary, and no more than two miles
      from camp. A large herd of buffalo trooped out of the west,
      coming fast under a cloud of dust. They poured down into
      the creek and literally blocked it, crazy to drink. Tom had
      here a marked instance of the thirst-driven madness now
      common to the buffalo. This herd, numbering many hundreds,
      slaked their thirst, and then trooped into a wide flat in
      the creek bottom, where trees stood here and there.
      Manifestly they had drunk too deeply, if they had not
      foundered, for most of them lay down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll cross the creek and sneak close on them," said Tom.
      "Bring all the cartridges. We might get a stand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" whispered Cherry, excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's what a buffalo-hunter calls a place and time where a
      big number bunches and can be kept from running off. I
      never had a stand myself. But I've an idea what one's
      like."
    </p>
    <p>
      They crept on behind trees and brush, down into the wide
      shallow flat, until they were no farther than a hundred
      yards from the resting herd. From the way Cherry panted Tom
      knew he was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is sort of skittish," whispered Tom, "but if they run
      our way we can climb a tree."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not--scared. It's--just--great," rejoined the lad, in
      a tone that hardly verified his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Crawl slow now, and easy," said Tom. "A little
      farther--then we'll bombard them."
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Tom led the youngster yards closer, to a wonderful
      position behind an uprooted cottonwood, from which they
      could not be seen. Thrilling indeed was it even for Tom,
      who had stalked Comanches in this way. Most of the buffalo
      were down, and those standing were stupid with drowsiness.
      The heat, and a long parching thirst, then an overcharged
      stomach, had rendered them loggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom turned his head to whisper instruction to the lad.
      Cherry's face was pale and the freckles stood out
      prominently. He was trembling with wild eagerness, fear and
      delight combined. Tom thought it no wonder. Again he
      smelled the raw scent of buffalo. They made a magnificent
      sight, an assorted herd of all kinds and ages, from the
      clean, glossy, newly shedded old bulls down to the red
      calves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take the bull on your right--farthest out," whispered Tom.
      "And I'll tend to this old stager on my left."
    </p>
    <p>
      The big guns boomed. Tom's bull went to his knees and,
      grunting loud, fell over; Cherry's bull wagged his head as
      if a bee had stung him. Part of the buffalo lying down got
      up. The old bull, evidently a leader, started off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knock him," whispered Tom, quickly. "They'll follow him."
      Tom fired almost simultaneously with Cherry, and one or
      both of them scored a dead shot. The buffalo that had
      started to follow the bull turned back into the herd, and
      this seemed to dominate all of them. Most of those standing
      pressed closer in. Others began to walk stolidly off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shoot the outsiders," said Tom, quickly. And in three
      seconds he had stopped as many buffalo. Cherry's gun
      boomed, but apparently without execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Pilchuck rushed up behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By golly! you've got a stand!" he ejaculated, in excited
      tones for him. "Never seen a better in my life. Now, here,
      you boys let me do the shootin'. It's tough on you, but if
      this stand is handled right we'll make a killin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck stuck his forked rest-stick in the ground, and
      knelt behind it, just to the right of Tom and Cherry. This
      elevated him somewhat above the log, and certainly not
      hidden from the buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Case like this a fellow wants to shoot straight," said the
      scout. "A crippled buff means a bolt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Choosing the bull the farthest outside of the herd,
      Pilchuck aimed with deliberation, and fired. The animal
      fell. Then he treated the next in the same manner. He was
      far from hurried, and that explained his deadly precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mustn't let your gun get too hot," he said.
      "Over-expansion from heat makes a bullet go crooked."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck picked out buffalo slowly walking away and downed
      them. The herd kept massed, uneasy in some quarters, but
      for the most part not disturbed by the shooting. Few of
      those lying down rose to their feet. When the scout had
      accounted for at least two dozen buffalo he handed his gun
      to Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cool it off an' wipe it out," he directed, and taking
      Tom's gun returned to his deliberate work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom threw down the breech-block and poured water through
      the barrel, once, and then presently again. Taking up
      Pilchuck's ramrod Tom ran a greasy patch of cloth through
      the barrel. It was cooling rapidly and would soon be safe
      to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the imperturbable scout was knocking buffalo down
      as if they had been tenpins. On the side toward him there
      was soon a corral of dead buffalo. He never missed; only
      seldom was it necessary to take two shots to an animal.
      After shooting ten or twelve he returned Tom's gun and took
      up his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Best stand I ever saw," he said. "Queer how buffalo act
      sometimes. They're not stupid. They know somethin' is
      wrong. But you see I keep knockin' down the one that leads
      off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buffalo walked over to dead ones, and sniffed at them, and
      hooked them with such violence that the contact could be
      heard. An old bull put something apparently like anger into
      his actions. Why did not his comrade, or perhaps his mate,
      get up and come? Some of them looked anxiously round,
      waiting. Now and then another would walk out of the crowd,
      and that was fatal for him. Boom! And the heavy bullet
      would thud solidly; the buffalo would sag or jerk, and then
      sink down, shot through the heart. Pilchuck was a machine
      for the collecting of buffalo hides. There were hundreds of
      hunters like him on the range. Boom! Boom! Boom! boomed out
      the big fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after more than an hour of this incredible
      stolidity to the boom of gun and the fall of their numbers,
      the resting buffalo got up, and they all moved round
      uneasily, uncertainly. Then Pilchuck missed dead center of
      a quartering shot at a bull that led out. The bullet made
      the beast frantic, and with a kind of low bellow it bounded
      away. The mass broke, and a stream of shaggy brown poured
      off the flat and up the gentle slope. In a moment all the
      herd was in motion. The industrious Pilchuck dropped four
      more while they were crowding behind, following off the
      flat. A heavy trampling roar filled the air; dust,
      switching tufted tails, woolly bobbing backs, covered the
      slope. And in a few moments they were gone. Silence settled
      down. The blue smoke drifted away. A gasp of dying buffalo
      could be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon I never beat this stand," said the scout, wiping
      his wet, black hands. "If I only hadn't crippled that
      bull."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gosh! It was murder--wusser'n butcherin' cows!" ejaculated
      the boy Cherry. Drops of sweat stood out on his pale face,
      as marked as the freckles. He looked sick. Long before that
      hour had ended his boyish sense of exciting adventure had
      been outraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lad, it ain't always that easy," remarked Pilchuck. "An'
      don't let this make you think huntin' buffalo isn't
      dangerous. Now we'll make a count."
    </p>
    <p>
      One hundred and twenty-six buffalo lay dead in space less
      than three acres; and most of them were bulls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yep, it's my record," declared the scout, with
      satisfaction. "But I come back fresh to it, an' shore that
      was a grand stand. Boys, we've got skinnin' for the rest of
      to-day an' all of to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The two outfits gradually hunted down the tributary towards
      its confluence with the Brazos. As the number of buffalo
      increased they encountered other hunters; and when May
      arrived they were on the outskirts of the great herd and a
      swarm of camps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hide thieves were numbered among these outfits, and this
      necessitated the consolidation of camps and the need for
      one or more men to be left on guard. Thus Tom and Cherry
      often had a day in camp, most welcome change, though tasks
      were endless. Their place was at a point where the old
      Spanish Trail from the Staked Plain crossed the Brazos; and
      therefore was in line of constant travel. Hunters and
      freighters, tenderfeet and old timers, soldiers and
      Indians, passed that camp, and seldom came a day when no
      traveler stopped for an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cherry liked these days more than those out on the range.
      He was being broken in to Pilchuck's strenuous method and
      the process was no longer enticing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once it happened that Cherry and Dan Newman were left
      together. Tom had ridden off to take up his skinning, in
      which he had soon regained all his old-time skill, but he
      did not forget to admonish the boys to keep out of
      mischief. Wrong-Wheel Jones, who had been recovering from
      one of his infrequent intemperate spells, had also been
      left behind. When Tom returned he found Jones in a state of
      high dudgeon, raving what he would do to those infernal
      boys. It was plain that Wrong-Wheel had very recently come
      out of the river, which at this point ran under a bank
      close to camp. Tom decided the old fellow had fallen in,
      but as the boys were not to be found, a later conclusion
      heaped upon their heads something of suspicion. At last Tom
      persuaded him to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, it was this way," began Wrong-Wheel, with the air of
      a much-injured man. "Since I lost them two hundred
      hides--an' I know darn well some thief got them--I been
      drinkin' considerable. Jest got to taperin' off lately, an'
      wasn't seein' so many queer things. . . . Wal, to-day I
      went to sleep thar in the shade on the bank. Suthin' woke
      me, an' when I opened my eyes I seed an orful sight. I was
      scared turrible, an' I jest backed off the bank an' fell in
      the river. Damn near drowned! Reckon when I got out I was
      good an' sober. . . . An', say, what d'ye spose them boys
      done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrong-Wheel squinted at Tom and squirted a brown stream of
      tobacco into the camp fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't any idea," replied Tom, with difficulty
      preserving a straight face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal," went on Jones, "you know thet big panther Pilchuck
      shot yestiddy. Them boys hed skinned it, shot-pouched it,
      as we say, an' they hed stuffed it with grass, an' put
      sticks in fer legs, an' marbles fer eyes. An' I'm a
      son-of-a-gun if they didn't stand the dummy right in front
      of me, so when I woke I seed it fust, an' I jest nat'rally
      went off my head."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Another day an old acquaintance of Tom's rode in and halted
      on his way to Fort Worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roberts!" exclaimed Tom, in glad surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just come from Fort Sill," said Roberts, evincing equal
      pleasure. "An' I have shore some news for you. Do you
      remember old Nigger Horse, the chief of that band of
      Comanches we fought--when I had this heah arm broke?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not likely to forget," replied Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, the Comanches that are left are slowly comin' in to
      Fort Sill an' goin' on the reservation. An' from some of
      them we got facts aboot things we never was shore on. The
      soldiers lately had a long runnin' fight with old Nigger
      Horse. Some sergeant killed the old chief an' his squaw,
      an' that shore was a good job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nigger was a bad Comanche," agreed Tom. "Did you ever hear
      any more about Hudnall's gun?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore. We heerd all aboot it, an' from several bucks who
      were in our fight where I had my arm broke, an' other
      fights afterwards. . . . I reckon you remember Hudnall had
      a fine gun, one shore calculated to make redskins want it.
      An' possession of that rifle was bad medicine to every
      consarned Indian who got it. Nigger Horse's son had it
      first. He was the brave who led that ride down the canyon
      to draw our fire. He shore had spunk. Wal, I reckon he was
      full of lead. Then an Injun named Five Plumes got it.
      'Pears we killed him. After that every red-skin who took
      Hudnall's rifle an' cartridges got his everlastin'. Finally
      they quit usin' it, thinkin' it was bad medicine. Now the
      fact is, those Comanches who used Hudnall's gun got
      reckless because they had it, an' laid themselves open to
      our fire. But they thought it had a spell of the devil."
    </p>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The middle of July found Tom Doan and Pilchuck far down on
      the Brazos, in the thick of the slaughter. Thirty miles of
      buffalo-hunters drove the last great herd day by day toward
      extermination.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the weather had been uncomfortable in midsummer on the
      Pease River Divide, here it was worse than hot. Moreover,
      up there in earlier days the hunting had been comparatively
      easy. Here it was incessant toil. The buffalo had to be
      chased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prairie was open, hot, dusty, and vast. Always the
      buffalo headed to the wind; they would drink and graze, and
      go on, noses to the breeze. If the wind changed overnight,
      in the morning they would be found turned round, traveling
      toward it. All day they grazed against it. They relied on
      their scent more than on sight or hearing; and in that open
      country the wind brought them warning of their foes. But
      for the great number of hide-hunters these buffalo might
      have escaped any extended slaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outfits were strung along the Brazos for many miles;
      and as the buffalo had to drink they were never far from
      water. Thus a number of hunters would get to them every
      day, kill many on the chase, and drive them on to the next
      aggregation of slayers.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Doan had been in hard action for over two months; and
      he and Pilchuck and Jones had killed thirty-nine hundred
      and twenty buffalo, losing only a small percentage of
      skins. Their aim was to last out the summer and fall if
      endurance could be great enough. They had no freighting to
      do now; they sold their hides in bales on the range.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days grew to be nightmares. As the buffalo were driven
      up the river, then back down, and up again, the killing was
      accomplished for weeks in comparatively small area. It got
      to be so that Tom could not ride many rods without
      encountering either a pile of bones, or rotten carcass, or
      one just beginning to decompose, or a freshly skinned one
      torn over the night before by the packs of thousand of
      coyotes that followed the herd. Some days hundreds of newly
      skinned buffalo shone red along with the blackened
      carcasses over a stretch of miles. Buzzards were as thick
      as bees. And the stench was unbearable. The prairie became
      a gruesome, ghastly shambles; and the camps were almost
      untenable because of flies and bugs, ticks and mosquitoes.
      These hunters stuck to a job that in a worthy cause would
      have been heroic. As it was they descended to butchers, and
      each and all of them sank inevitably. Boom! Boom! Boom! All
      day long the detonation filled the hot air. No camp was out
      of hearing of the guns. Wagons lumbered along the dusty
      roads. All the outfits labored day and night to increase
      their store of hides, riding, chasing, shooting, skinning,
      hauling, and pegging, as if their very lives depended upon
      incessant labor. It was a time of carnage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long had Tom Doan felt the encroachment of a mood he had at
      one time striven against--a morbid estimate of self, a
      consciousness that this carnage would debase him utterly if
      he did not soon abandon it. Once there had been a wonderful
      reason for him to give up the hunting. Milly Fayre!
      Sometimes still her dark eyes haunted him. If she had not
      been lost he would long ago have quit this bloody game. The
      wound in his heart did not heal. Love of Milly abided, and
      that alone saved him from the utter debasement of hard life
      at a hard time.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning when he drove out on the dust-hazed, stinking
      prairie he found a little red buffalo calf standing beside
      its mother, that Tom had shot and skinned the day before.
      This was no new sight to Tom. Nevertheless, in the present
      case there seemed a difference. These calves left
      motherless by the slaughter had always wandered over the
      prairie, lost, bewildered; this one, however, had
      recognized its mother and would not leave her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go along! Get back to the herd!" yelled Tom, shocked
      despite his callousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calf scarcely noticed him. It smelled of its
      hide-stripped mother, and manifestly was hungry. Presently
      it left off trying to awaken this strange horribly red and
      inert body, and stood with hanging head, dejected,
      resigned, a poor miserable little beast. Tom could not
      drive it away; and after loading the hide on the wagon he
      returned twice to try to make it run off. Finally he was
      compelled to kill it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This incident boded ill for Tom. It fixed his mind on this
      thing he was doing and left him no peace. Thousands and
      thousands of beautiful little buffalo calves were rendered
      motherless by the hide-hunters. That was to Tom the
      unforgivable brutality. Calves just born, just able to
      suck, and from that to yearlings, were left to starve, to
      die of thirst, to wander until they dropped or were torn to
      shreds by wolves. No wonder this little calf showed in its
      sad resignation the doom of the species!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      August came. The great herd massed. The mating season had
      come, and both bulls and cows, slaves to the marvelous
      instinct that had evolved them, grew slower, less wary,
      heedless now to the scent of man on the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of this mating time it was necessary to be
      within a mile or less to hear the strange <i>roo roo
      roo</i>--<i>ooo.</i> This sound was the bellow of a bull.
      Gradually day by day the sound increased in volume and
      range. It could be heard several miles, and gradually
      farther as more and more bulls bellowed in unison. ROO ROO
      ROO--OOO!--It began to be incessant, heard above the boom!
      boom! boom! of guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time came when it increased tremendously and lasted day
      and night. Tom Doan's camp was then ten miles from the
      herd. At that distance the bellow was as loud as distant
      thunder. ROO ROO ROO--OOO! It kept Tom awake. It filled his
      ears. If he did fall asleep it gave him a nightmare. When
      he awoke he heard again the long mournful roar. At length
      it wore upon him so deeply that in the darkness and
      solitude of night he conceived the idea he was listening to
      the voice of a great species, bellowing out for
      life--life--life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This wild deep <i>Roo</i>--<i>ooo</i> was the knell of the
      buffalo. What a strange sound, vastly different from
      anything human, yet somehow poignant, tragic, terrible!
      Nature had called to the great herd; and that last million
      of buffalo bellowed out their acceptance of the decree. But
      in Tom's morbid mind he attributed vastly more to this
      strange thunder, which was not the trampling thunder of
      their hoofs. In the dead of night when the guns were silent
      he could not shake the spell. It came to him then how
      terribly wrong, obsessed, evil were these hide-hunters. God
      and nature had placed the wonderful beasts on earth for a
      purpose, the least of which might have been to furnish meat
      and robe for men in a measure of reason. But here all the
      meat was left to rot, and half the hides; and the remaining
      half went to satisfy a false demand, and to make rich a
      number of hunters, vastly degraded by the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Roo</i>--<i>ooo</i>--<i>ooo!</i> Tom heard in that the
      meaning of a futile demand of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Doan and Pilchuck reined their horses on the crest of a
      league-sloping ridge and surveyed the buffalo range.
    </p>
    <p>
      To their surprise the endless black line of buffalo was not
      in sight. They had moved north in the night. At this early
      morning hour the hunters were just riding out to begin
      their day's work. No guns were booming, and it appeared
      that Tom and the scout had that part of the range to
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, we spent yesterday peggin' hides in camp, an' didn't
      think to ask Jones if the buffalo had moved," remarked
      Pilchuck, reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wind has changed. It's now from the north," said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore is. An' the buffs will be grazin' back pronto. That
      is, if they <i>are</i> grazin'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any reason to doubt it?" asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, the breedin' season's just about ended. An' that with
      this muggy, stormy, electric-charged mornin' might cause a
      move. Never in my huntin' days have I seen such a restless
      queer herd of buffalo as this one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No wonder!" exclaimed Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, it ain't, an' that's a fact. . . . Do I see hosses
      yonder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom swept the prairie with his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Hunters riding out. I see more beyond. They're all
      going downriver."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to think of it, I didn't hear much shootin'
      yesterday. Did you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a great deal. And that was early morning and far
      away," replied Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buffs an' hunters have worked north. Let's see. The river
      makes a bend about ten miles from here, an' runs east. I'd
      be willin' to bet the herd hasn't turned that bend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because they'll <i>never</i> go north again. For two
      months the trend has been south, day by day. Some days a
      wind like yesterday would switch them, but on the whole
      they're workin' south. This ain't natural for midsummer.
      They ought to be headed north. 'Course the mob of hunters
      are drivin' them south."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how about to-day?" inquired Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, I'm shore figgerin'. Reckon I can't explain, but I
      feel all them outfits ridin' north will have their work for
      nothin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will we do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not carin' a lot. Reckon I've sickened on this job,
      an' I shore know that, when I stay a day in camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had before noted this tendency in the scout. It was
      common to all those hunters who had been long in the field.
      He did not voice his own sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been wantin' to ride west an' see what that next ford
      is goin' to be like," said the scout, presently. "We'll be
      breakin' camp an' movin' south soon. An' the other side of
      the river is where we want to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Tom experienced a reluctance to a
      continuation of the old mode of traveling south. Why not
      turn north once more? The thought was a surprise. There was
      no reason to start north, unless in answer to the revulsion
      of hide-hunting. This surely would be his last buffalo
      hunt. But he did not think it just to his partners to quit
      while they wanted to keep on. His reflection then was that
      Pilchuck was wearing out, both in strength and in greed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode west, aiming to reach the river some four or five
      miles farther on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cloudy, sultry summer morning, with storm in the
      air. The prairie was not here a beautiful prospect. Tom
      seemed to gaze over it rather than at it. Westward the
      undulating gray rise of ground stretched interminably to a
      horizon bare of landmarks. Far in the east rays of sunlight
      streamed down between sullen, angry, copper and purple-hued
      clouds. The north threatened. It was black all along the
      horizon. Still, oppressive, sultry, the air seemed charged.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time Pilchuck turned in his saddle to gaze
      backward along the empty range, and then up at the
      cloudbank. It appeared to Tom as if the scout were looking
      and listening for something.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What 're you expecting?" queried Tom, yielding to
      curiosity. "A thunderstorm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, I'll be darned if I know," ejaculated Pilchuck.
      "Shore I wasn't thinkin' about a storm. Wasn't thinkin' at
      all! Must be just habit with me. . . . But now you tax me,
      I reckon I'm oneasy about that herd."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck led west farther than he had calculated, and
      struck the river at a wonderful place where the prairie
      took a sudden dip for miles, sheering steeply to the
      shallow water. Here was the buffalo ford, used by the herds
      in their annual migrations. Trees were absent, and brush
      and grass had not the luxuriance common to most stretches
      of river bank. From prairie rim to margin of river sloped a
      long steep bank, even and smooth; and at one point the wide
      approach to the ford was split and dominated by a rocky
      eminence, the only high point in sight along the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place seemed dismal and lonely to Tom, as he sat on his
      horse while Pilchuck forded the river. Contrary to most
      river scenes, this one was lifeless. Not a bird or animal
      or a fish or turtle in sight! Loneliness and solitude had
      their abode in this trodden road of the buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the scout returned and rode up to Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, I wouldn't care to get a team stuck in that sand," he
      remarked. "It shore ain't packed none. . . . Lend me your
      glass."
    </p>
    <p>
      The scout swept a half circle of the horizon, and finally
      came to a halt westward, at a point on the prairie some
      distance from the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See some small bunches of buffalo," he said. "Let's ride
      up on them, make our kill, skin what we get, an' pick them
      up with the wagon on our way south to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're the boss," replied Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, I wish some one was bossin' me," returned Pilchuck,
      enigmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      They trotted off over the gray prairie, and after traveling
      a couple of miles, could see the buffalo plainly. Meanwhile
      a slight breeze began to blow from the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be darned!" ejaculated Pilchuck, with annoyance.
      "Wind's turned again. If it blows stronger we'll not slip
      up on this bunch."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another mile brought increase of wind, and the wary
      buffalo, catching the scent of the killers, loped away over
      the prairie. Pilchuck watched them in disgust. "Run, you
      old dunder-heads! Run clear across the Rio Grande! . . .
      Tom, I reckon we're all spoiled by the past easy huntin'.
      It'll never be easy again. An' somehow I'm glad. Let's work
      back."
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned about to face the breeze, now quite strong,
      cooler, with a heavy scent of rotting buffalo carcasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faugh!" exclaimed the scout. "I'd rather have nose an'
      eyes full of Cottonwood smoke."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom's quick ear caught a very low rumble of thunder. He
      turned his head. The sound had ceased. It had come on a
      stronger puff of wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What'd you hear?" inquired the scout, whose eye never
      missed anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thunder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wal, it does look stormy. But I never trust thunder in
      this country," replied the scout, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He halted his horse; and Tom did likewise. They gazed at
      the north. Dull, leaden mushrooming clouds were moving
      toward them, not rapidly, but steadily, in heavy changing
      forms. They merged into a purple-black mass down which
      streaked thin zigzag ropes of lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Storm all right," observed Pilchuck. "Listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment in which nothing was heard save the heaving
      of horses, the rattle of bridle, and creak of leather, the
      scout dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get off, Tom, an' walk away from the horses. . . . Listen
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Tom again heard the low dull rumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore. That's genuine thunder, an' it means rain for this
      stinkin' dusty hot range. . . . Listen some more, Tom."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men stood apart, Pilchuck favoring his right ear,
      Tom his left; and they remained motionless. Several times
      the mutter of thunder, distinct now to Tom, caused the
      scout to nod his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckon that's not what I'm expectin'," he said, gloomily.
      "An' we've no time to stand here all day. . . . Listen
      hard, Tom. You're younger than me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom's sluggish blood quickened a little. He had been two
      years with this old plainsman, during which there had been
      numberless instances of his sagacity and vision, and
      remarkable evidences of experience. Pilchuck was worrying
      about that herd of buffalo. Thereupon Tom bent lower, held
      his breath, and strained his ear with all intensity
      possible. Again he heard the muttering long rumble--then
      the beat of his heart, the stir of his hair over his
      temple--the sweep of wind. Thunder again! That was all; and
      he abandoned the strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing but storm," he told Pilchuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon my ears are old, an' my imagination makes me
      think I hear things," returned the scout. "But a moment ago
      . . . Try again. I want to be <i>shore."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus incited, Tom lent himself to as sensitive and profound
      listening as was possible for him. This time he seemed to
      hear the thunder as before, somewhat louder; and under it
      another, fainter sound, an infinitely low roar that did not
      die out, that went on and on, deadened by another mutter of
      thunder, and then, when this was gone, beginning again,
      low, strange, unceasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he straightened up and told Pilchuck what he had
      heard. How sharply and intelligently the scout's gray eyes
      flashed! He made no reply, except to raise one of his
      brawny hands. Leaving it extended, he froze in the attitude
      of an Indian listening. Tom again lent his ear to the
      strengthening breeze. Thunder--then long low menacing
      roar--thunder again--and roar! He made his own deductions
      and, lifting his head, waited for the scout to speak. Long
      did Pilchuck maintain that tense posture. He was a slow,
      deliberate man on occasions. Sometimes he would act with
      the most incredible speed. Here he must have been studying
      the volume, direction, distance of this thrilling sound,
      and not its cause. Suddenly his big brown hand clenched and
      shot down to crack into the palm of the other. He wheeled
      to Tom, with gray lightning in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stampede! . . . The whole herd!" he ejaculated. "I've been
      expectin' it for days."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he gazed across the northern horizon of the prairie
      round to a point due east.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You notice we can see only four or five miles," he said.
      "The prairie rises slow for about that distance, then dips.
      That'd deaden sound as well as hide any movin' thing. We
      can't be shore that herd is far away. . . . Funny how we
      run into things. Reckon we'd better ride!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They mounted, and were off at a gallop that gave place to a
      run. Tom had lost his fleet, faithful Dusty, and was now
      riding a horse strong and sound and fairly fast, but no
      match for Pilchuck's hunter. So Tom fell behind gradually.
      He did not goad the horse, though he appreciated Pilchuck's
      brief hint of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scout rode east, quartering toward the river, and
      passed a couple of miles out from where he and Tom had
      stopped at the ford. Tom gradually fell behind until he was
      fully a quarter of a mile in the rear. As long as he could
      keep Pilchuck in sight he did not have any anxiety about
      the separation. The horse could run, and he was
      sure-footed. Tom believed he would acquit himself well even
      in a grueling race with the buffalo. It seemed strange to
      be running away from an unseen danger. While riding he
      could not hear anything save the rhythmic beat of hoofs and
      rush of wind. He observed that the direction Pilchuck had
      chosen was just a point east of the center of the black
      storm cloud. Far to its right showed the dim fringe of
      river timber. There was a wide distance between the end of
      that cloud and the river, most of which was gently sloping
      prairie. He had a keen eagerness to know what could be seen
      beyond the long ridge-top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next time he gazed at Pilchuck he was amazed to see him
      pulling his horse to a halt. Tom rode on with eyes now
      intent. The scout reined in and leaped out of the saddle.
      He ran a few paces from the horse, and stopped to lie flat
      on the ground. Tom realized that Pilchuck was listening
      with ear close to the earth. The action startled Tom. Not
      improbably this situation was growing serious. Pilchuck lay
      a moment, then got up and stood like a statue. Then he
      abruptly broke his rigid posture and leaped astride. But
      instead of riding off he waited there, face to the north.
      Tom rapidly overhauled him and pulled his mount to a stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jude, what's wrong?" he called, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ain't shore, but I'm damned scared," replied the scout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? I can't see or hear anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "See that yellow dust way to the right of the black sky.
      Look! It's movin'!--I'm afraid if we go farther this way
      we'll get headed off an' run into the river. We could
      cross, but it'd take time, an' when we got over we might
      have to run south. That'd never do. We've got to go east or
      west."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jude, I hear a roar," said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore. So do I. But it was the movin' dust that stopped
      me. . . . Keep still now an' let me figger. If I've any
      prairie cunnin' left we're in a hell of a fix. We've got to
      do what's right--an' quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore Tom attended to sight of the low, rounded, yellow
      cloud of dust. It did move, apparently slowly, and spread
      to the right. Against the background of purple sky it held
      something ominous. Tom watched it rise gradually to the
      left, though in this direction it did not spread along the
      prairie so rapidly. The ground sloped that way, and the
      ridge-top stretched higher than the level to the east,
      where the dust now rolled plainly. The roar was a dull
      distant rumble, steady and ear-filling though not at all
      loud. It was a deceiving sound, and might be closer than it
      seemed or farther away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly it became loud. It startled Tom. He turned to see
      what Pilchuck made of that. The scout sat his fidgety
      horse, with his head extended, his long neck craned
      forward. Suddenly he jerked back as if struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Doan, look!"</i> he shouted, in a tone Tom had never
      heard. His voice seemed to merge into a rolling rumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom wheeled. Along the whole of the prairie horizon had
      appeared a black bobbing line of buffalo. Above them rose
      the yellow dust, and beyond that spread the storm-cloud of
      purple. The ragged front of the herd appeared to creep over
      the ridge-top, like a horizon-wide tide, low, flat, black.
      Toward the west the level gray horizon was being blotted
      out with exceeding swiftness, as the herd came in sight. It
      spread like a black smoke, flying low. To the east the
      whole space before noted by Tom had been clouded with black
      and yellow. The front line of the herd, then, did not
      appear to be straight across: it was curving from the
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      One moment Tom gazed, rapt, thrilling, then his blood
      gushed hot. The great herd was at last on the stampede. Not
      five miles distant, running downhill!
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God! we're in a trap!" yelled Pilchuck, hoarsely.
      "We've only one chance. Follow me an' ride!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spurred and wheeled his horse and, goading him into a
      run, headed for the river ford. Tom spurred after him,
      finding now that his horse, frightened by the roar, could
      keep up with Pilchuck's. They ran straight away from the
      eastern front of the herd, that was curving in and
      quartering away from the western front. Tom had ridden fast
      before, but Pilchuck's start bade fair to lead him into the
      swiftest race of his experience on the range. He was aware
      of drawing away somewhat from the roar in the rear; on his
      right, however, the sound augmented. Tom gazed around. His
      eyes, blurred from the rush of wind, showed a league-wide
      band of black, sliding down the prairie slope, widening,
      spreading. He did not look behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck's fleet horse began to draw ahead. The old scout
      was riding as he had never ridden away from Comanches. Tom
      remembered what fear these old plainsmen had of the buffalo
      stampede. It was the terror of the plains, more appalling
      than the prairie fire. Comanches could be fought; fires
      could be outridden or back-fired, but the stampede of
      buffalo was a rolling sea of swift insane beasts. With spur
      and fist and voice Tom urged his horse to its utmost, and
      kept the distance between him and Pilchuck from widening
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both horses now were on a headlong run strained to the
      breaking point. The wind hissed by Tom's ears, swayed him
      back in his saddle. On both sides the gray prairie slid by,
      indistinct, a blurred expanse, over which he seemed to
      sail. He could not see the river depression, but before
      long he made out the rocky eminence that marked the site of
      the ford. Pilchuck's intention now was plain. At first Tom
      had imagined the scout meant to try to cross the river
      ahead of the herd; now, however, he was making for the high
      point of rock. This realization unclamped Tom's cold doubt.
      If the horses did not fall they could make that place of
      safety. Pilchuck was fifty feet ahead, and not only was he
      driving the horse at breakneck speed, but he was guiding
      him over what appeared to be the smoother ground. Tom
      caught the slight variations in the course and the
      swervings aside; and he had only to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they flew. The gray mound of rock seemed close, the
      prairie flashing by, yet how slowly the distance lessened.
      Tom saw Pilchuck turn. His brown face gleamed. He waved his
      hand. A beckoning and an encouragement! Peril was not over,
      but safety was in sight. Then the scout leaned back,
      pulling the horse to his haunches, on which he slid to a
      stop. Over Pilchuck's head Tom saw the pale brightness of
      water. The river! Behind Tom rolled a rumbling thunder,
      strange to hear with his ears full of rushing wind, He
      dared not look back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The straining horse broke his stride, caught it again,
      stretched on, and plunged to the bare rise of rocky ground.
      Tom hauled with all his strength on the bridle. He checked
      the maddened animal, but could not stop him. Pilchuck stood
      ten feet above the bank. He had dismounted. Both hands were
      uplifted in gesture of awe. Tom leaped off just as his
      horse slowed before the first rocky bench. Dragging him up,
      Tom climbed to Pilchuck, who seemed to yell at him. But Tom
      heard no voice. The rocky eminence was about half an acre
      in extent, and high enough above the bank to split the
      herd. Tom dropped the bridle and whirled in fear and
      wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first thought when he saw the ragged, sweeping tide of
      beasts, still a third of a mile distant, was that he would
      have had time to spare. The herd had not been so close as
      his imagination had pictured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck dragged at Tom, pulling him higher on the rock.
      The scout put his mouth close to Tom's ear and manifestly
      yelled. But Tom heard no voice; felt only a soundless, hot
      breath. His ears were distending with a terrific thunder.
      His eyes were protruding at an awful spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he saw that sweep of buffalo with a marvelous
      distinctness, with the swift leap of emotion which
      magnified all his senses. Across the level front of his
      vision spread a ragged, shaggy black wall of heads, humps,
      hoofs, coming at the speed of buffalo on the stampede. On a
      hard run! The sea of bobbing backs beyond disappeared in a
      yellow pall of dust curled aloft and hung low, and kept
      almost the speed of the front rank. Above the moving mantle
      of dust, farther back, showed the gray pall of storm.
      Lightning flashed in vivid white streaks. But there was no
      thunder from above. The thunder rolled low, along the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spellbound Tom gazed. He was riveted to the rock. If he had
      not been he would have fled, up, back, away from that
      oncoming mass. But he could only gaze, in a profound
      consciousness of something great and terrifying. These
      buffalo might not split round the higher ground; those in
      line might run over the rock. What an end for hide-hunters!
      Killed, crushed, trampled to jelly, trampled to dust under
      the hoofs of the great herd! It would be just retribution.
      Tom felt the awful truth of that in his lifting heart. It
      was mete. The murderous hide-hunters, money-grubbers,
      deserved no pity. He could not feel any for himself. How
      furiously angry that curling surf of woolly heads and shiny
      horns and gleaming hoofs! On! On! On! The thundering herd!
      How magnificent and appalling!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his ears ceased to function. He could no longer
      hear. The sense had been outdone. There was no sound. But
      he saw yet the mighty onsweep, majestic, irresistible, an
      army of maddened beasts on the stampede, shaking the earth.
      The rock under his feet began to tremble. It was no longer
      stable. He felt the queer vibrations, and the sensation
      added to his terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transfixed, Tom awaited the insupportable moment for the
      rolling front ranks to reach the rock, either to roll over
      it like a tidal wave, or split round it. The moment was an
      age. Pilchuck was holding to him. Tom was holding to
      Pilchuck. The solid earth seemed about to cave in under
      them. Shaggy black heads bobbing swiftly, gleam of horns,
      and flash of wild eyes, hoofs, hoofs, hoofs sweeping out,
      out, out--and the awful moment was at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shaggy flood split round the rock and two streams of
      rounded woolly backs, close-pressed as water, swift as a
      mill-race, poured over the bank toward the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck dragged Tom away from the back position to the
      front of the rock. As if by supernatural magic the scene
      was changed. Below, far on each side, the mass of buffalo
      spilled over the embankment to plunge into the river. Up
      and down the water line spread white splashes; and over and
      into them leaped the second ranks of buffalo, too close to
      miss the first. Then what had momentarily been ranks on the
      slope closed up into solid mass of black. Bulge and
      heave--great sheets of muddy water--a terrible writhing
      massing forward along that irregular front! Then the tide
      of buffalo swept on, over, once more a flat, level
      multitude of heads and humps, irrepressible as an
      avalanche. They crossed the river on the run; the stampede
      had been only momentarily retarded. Downriver, below the
      ford, far as eye could see, stretched lines of buffalo
      swimming, swiftly, like an endless flock of enormous geese.
      Upriver stretched the same, as far as eye could see. The
      slope of the prairie to the water was one solid mass of
      buffalo, moving as one beast, impelled by motive as wild as
      the action. Above swept the dust, blowing as a storm wind
      from the prairie, and, curling like a yellow curtain of
      smoke, it followed the buffalo across the river up the long
      slope, and out upon the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom and Pilchuck were on that level between the moving dust
      above and the moving buffalo below. All view back toward
      the prairie whence the herd rolled was soon obliterated.
      Likewise the front ranks of the great mass disappeared on
      the opposite side, under this accompanying mantle. But the
      river, for a while, lay clear to their gaze, miles up and
      miles down, and all visible space of water and ground was
      covered with buffalo. Buffalo more numerous than a band of
      ants on the march!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom sank down, overcome by the spectacle, by the continuous
      trembling of the earth under him, by the strangulation
      which threatened, by the terrible pressure on his
      ear-drums.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly night seemed to intervene. A gale swooped the dust
      away across the river; and in place of yellow curling
      curtain of dust there came a slanting gray pall of rain. It
      blackened as the light grew less. Blazing streaks of
      lightning played through the gray gloom. But if there was
      thunder above, it could not be heard in the thunder below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck drew Tom under a narrow shelf of rock, where, half
      protected from the deluge, they crouched in the
      semi-darkness. What seemed hours passed. Yet there was no
      end to the passing of the great herd. The rain ceased, the
      sky lightened and cleared, and clearer grew the black
      mantling of prairie and river. All was buffalo, except the
      sky. Then the sun broke out of the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom's stunned senses rallied enough for him to appreciate
      the grandeur and beauty suddenly given the scene by a
      glorious sheen of gold and purple, streaming down from the
      rifts between the clouds. The dust was gone. The thousands
      of shining black backs moved on and on, rapidly,
      ponderously, swallowed up by the haze of the disappearing
      storm. And still the buffalo came over the prairie,
      obscuring the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last the time came when the mass showed breaks in
      the ranks, and then, in the rear line, more ragged than had
      been the fore. Tom's hearing seemed gradually to be
      restored. That, he realized, was only the diminishing of
      the vast volume of sound to the point where it was no
      longer deafening. It was a blood-deadening thunder that
      gradually lessened as the end of the herd rolled on from
      the prairie, down over the bank, and across the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thundering herd swept on out of sight. And the thunder
      became a roar, the roar a rumble, and the rumble died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilchuck rose to his lofty height and peered across the
      river, into the gray haze and purple distance that had
      swallowed up the buffalo. He seemed to be a man who had
      lived through something terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The last herd!" he said, with pathos. "They've crossed the
      Brazos an' they'll never come back. . . . The storm of rain
      was like the storm of lead that'll follow them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom also got dizzily to his feet and faced the south. What
      he felt about the last herd could not be spoken. He had
      been spared a death he felt he deserved; and he had seen a
      mighty spectacle, incalculable in its spiritual effect. All
      in vain was the grand stampede of that thundering herd. It
      must drink, it must graze--and behind would troop the
      ruthless hunters of hides. But Tom had seen and felt its
      overpowering vitality, its tremendous life, its spirit.
      Never would he kill another buffalo! And a great sadness
      pervaded his mind. As he stood there, trying to form in
      words something to say to Pilchuck, a huge old buffalo
      bull, one of the many that had been mired in the sand,
      floundered and wallowed free, and waddled to the opposite
      shore. Stupidly he gazed about him, forlorn, alone, lost, a
      symbol of the herd that had gone on without him. Then he
      headed south out into the melancholy gray of the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jude, I'm--going--north!" exclaimed Tom, haltingly, full
      of words that would not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shake!" replied the old scout, quick as a flash, as he
      extended his brawny hand.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c19" id="c19">CHAPTER XIX</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      From the crest of the long prairie slope, beginning to
      color brown and gold in the September sun, Tom Doan gazed
      down at the place that had been Sprague's Post. It had
      grown so as to be almost unrecognizable. Ranches dotted the
      beautiful sweep of fertile land. Near at hand, the river
      wound away, hidden in green foliage, and far out on the
      plain it glistened in the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the keen pang in Tom's heart, and the morbid
      reluctance to return that had abided with him, strangely he
      found he was glad. The wildness of the buffalo range,
      loneliness and silence and solitude, and the loss that he
      felt was irreparable--these had dwarfed his former
      kindliness and hopefulness, and his old ambition to know
      the joy of his own home and ranch. But might there not be
      some compensation?
    </p>
    <p>
      The long wagon train of hides and camp outfits lumbered
      across the prairie to enter the outskirts of the Post and
      haul up on the green square between the town and the river.
      Huts and cabins had taken the place of tents. Still there
      were new wagons and outfits belonging to hunters bound for
      the buffalo range. Tom wanted to cry out about the pains
      and blunders they were so cheerfully and ignorantly
      traveling to meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big wagon trains such as this one were always encountered
      at the Post. News traveled ahead of such large caravans;
      and there was a crowd on the green. There were half a dozen
      wagons ahead of the one Tom drove, and the last of these
      was Pilchuck's. The lean old scout was at once surrounded
      by hunters eager to learn news of the buffalo range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom saw Burn Hudnall and Dave Stronghurl before they saw
      him. How well they looked--fuller of face and not so
      bronzed as when they had ridden the open range! Eager and
      excited also they appeared to Tom. They would be glad to
      see him. If only he could avoid meeting their women folk!
      Then Burn espied him and made at him. Tom dropped the
      knotted reins over the brake with a movement of finality,
      and stepped down out of the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Howdy, boys! It's sure good to see you," he said,
      heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      They grasped him with hands almost rough, so forceful were
      they; and both greeted him at once in a kind of suppressed
      joy, incoherent and noisy, all the more welcoming for that.
      Then they hung on to him, one at each side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, have you boys taken to drink?" retorted Tom, to
      conceal how their warmth affected him. "I haven't just come
      back to life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, I--we--all of us was afraid you'd never come," burst
      out Burn. "You look fine. Thin, mebbe, an' hard. . . . My
      Gawd! I'm glad!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom--I've got a baby--a boy!" beamed Dave, his strong smug
      face alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say! Dave, shake on that. . . . I'm sure glad.
      How time flies! It doesn't seem so long--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got other news, but the best of it'll keep till we
      get to the ranch," interrupted Burn. "Tom, I've got that
      five hundred acres father liked so well. Remember? You can
      buy next to me, along the river. Dave has thrown in with
      Sprague. The town's boomin'! We've a bank, a church, and a
      school. An' wait till you see the teacher! She's--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rambled on, like a boy, to be silenced by Dave's look.
      Then Dave began, and being more practical he soon got out
      Tom's bag and gun and roll of blankets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're comin' with us this hyar very minnit," he
      concluded, as Tom tried to make excuses. "Burn, grab some
      of his outfit. Reckon this team an' wagon belongs to
      Pilchuck?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it does," replied Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along then, you buffalo-chasin', Comanche-ridin'
      Llaner Estacador," went on Dave. "We've orders to fetch you
      home before these hyar town girls set eyes on you."
    </p>
    <p>
      They dragged Tom and his belongings out of the crowd,
      pushed him up into a spring-wagon, and while Burn piled his
      baggage in the back, Dave climbed up beside him and started
      a team of spirited horses out along the river road.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the welcome accorded Tom by Burn and Dave had touched
      him, that given by their women folk reached deeply to his
      heart. They were all at the front of Burn's fine ranch
      house. Burn's wife was weeping, it seemed for joy; and
      Sally Hudnall gave Tom a resounding kiss, to his
      consternation. Mrs. Hudnall, whose motherly face showed the
      ravages of grief, greeted him in a way that made Tom
      ashamed of how he had forgotten these good people. She took
      possession of him and led him indoors, ahead of the others.
      They had all seemed strange, hurried, suppressing
      something. They were not as Tom remembered. Alas! had he
      grown away from wholesome simplicity? They wanted to
      welcome him to their home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hudnall shut the door. Tom had a sense that the room
      was large, lighted by windows at each end. Clearing his
      throat, he turned to speak. But Mrs. Hudnall's working
      face, her tear-wet eyes, made him dumb. There was something
      wrong here.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, you're changed," she began, hurriedly. "No boy any
      more! I can see how it hurts you to come back to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, because of--of Milly," he replied, simply. "But you
      mustn't think I'm not glad to see you all. I am. You're my
      good friends. I'm ashamed I never appreciated you as I
      should have. But that hard life out there--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't," she interrupted, huskily. "You know how it hurt
      me. . . . But, Tom, never mind the past. Think of the
      present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My heart's buried in that past. It seems so long ago. So
      short a time to remember! I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you ever think Milly might not have been lost?" she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I thought that--till hope died," replied Tom, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My boy--we heard she wasn't killed--or captured--or
      anything," said Mrs. Hudnall, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heard she wasn't? My God! That would only torture me,"
      replied Tom, poignantly. He felt himself shaking. What did
      these people mean? His mind seemed to encounter that query
      as a wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, we <i>know</i> she wasn't," flashed the woman, with
      all the ecstasy in face and voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He staggered back suddenly, released from bewilderment. He
      realized now. That had been the secret of their excitement,
      their strangeness. His consciousness grasped the truth.
      Milly Fayre was not dead. For an instant his eyes closed
      and his physical and spiritual being seemed to unite in a
      tremendous resistance against the shock of rapture. He must
      not lose his senses. He must not miss one word or look of
      this good woman who had given him back love and life. But
      he was mute. A strong quiver ran over him from head to
      foot. Then heart and pulse leaped in exquisite pain and
      maddening thrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milly is here," said Mrs. Hudnall. "We tried again and
      again to send you word, but always missed you. Milly has
      lived here--ever since she escaped from Jett--and the
      Indians. She has grown. She's taught the school. She is
      well--happy. She has waited for you--she loves you dearly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Voice was wrenched from Tom. "I see truth in your face," he
      whispered, huskily. "But I can't believe. . . . Let me
      <i>see</i> her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hudnall pushed back the door and went out. Some one
      slipped in. A girl--a woman, white of face, with parted
      lips and great, radiant black eyes! Could this be Milly
      Fayre?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Oh</i>--<i>Tom!"</i> she burst out, in broken voice,
      deep and low. She took a forward step, with hands extended,
      then swayed back against the door. "Don't you--know me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd lost all hope," whispered Tom, as if to himself. "It's
      too sudden. I can't believe . . . You ghost! You white
      thing with eyes I loved!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's your Milly, alive--alive!" she cried, and ran to
      envelop him.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Later they stood by the open window watching the sun set
      gold over the dim dark line of the Llana Estacado. She had
      told her story. Tom could only marvel at it, as at her, so
      changed, so wonderful, yet sweet and simple as of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall never go back to the buffalo range," she said,
      in what seemed both command and appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Milly," he replied, and told her the story of the
      stampede of the thundering herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how wonderful and terrible!" she replied, "I loved the
      buffalo."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hudnall called gayly to them from the door.
      "Tom--Milly, you can't live on love. Supper is ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're not hungry," replied Milly, dreamily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we are," added Tom, forcefully. "We'll come. . . .
      Milly, I'm starved. You know what camp grub is. A year and
      a half on hump steak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait. I was only teasing," she whispered, as with downcast
      eyes, like midnight under their lashes, she leaned a little
      closer to him. "Do you remember my--my birthday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never knew it," he replied, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say. Well, I did get back at the right time.
      Let's see, you're eighteen years old."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you forget! I am nineteen. You lost me for over a
      year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Milly, I <i>never</i> forgot what was to have been on
      your eighteenth birthday, though I never knew the date."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was to have been?" she asked, shyly, with a slow
      blush mantling her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were to marry me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, did I promise that?" she questioned, in pretended
      wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, <i>that</i> was for my eighteenth birthday. You
      never hunted me--you hunted only buffalo. You might have
      had me. . . . But now you shall wait till--till I'm
      twenty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Milly, I hunted for you all through summer, fall, winter.
      And my heart broke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--but I can only marry you on a birthday," she replied,
      shaken by his words, and looked up at him with dusky,
      eloquent eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, I'm so happy to find you alive--to see you grown
      into a beautiful woman--to know you love me--that I could
      wait for ten birthdays," he said, earnestly. "But why make
      me wait? I've had a lonely hard life out there in the
      buffalo fields. It has taken something from me that only
      you can make up for. I must go back to my dream of a
      ranch--a home, cattle, horses, tilling the soil. Have you
      forgotten how we planned when we met in secret under the
      cottonwoods? Those moonlight nights!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I never forgot anything," she whispered, her head
      going down on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--since to-morrow is your nineteenth birthday, and
      I've lost you for an endless hateful year--marry me
      to-morrow. Will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
