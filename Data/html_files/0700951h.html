  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01">CHAPTER ONE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was no house in Siangtan quite like Joe Bray's. For
  the matter of that, Joe was unique even in China, to which so many unusual
  personalities have drifted since the days of Marco Polo.</p>

  <p>The house was of stone and had been designed by one Pinto Huello, a
  drunken Portuguese architect, who had left Portugal in circumstances
  discreditable to himself, and had drifted via Canton and Wuchau to this
  immense and untidy town.</p>

  <p>The general theory is that Pinto drew his plans after a night of delirium
  in a paradise of smoke, and had amended them in remorse. The change of plans
  came when the building was half erected, so that the portion of 'Northward'
  which had so strong a resemblance to the porcelain tower, stood for Pinto in
  his unregenerate mood, and all that had any likeness to a riverside go-down
  fairly represented the erratic Portuguese in the period of reaction.</p>

  <p>Joe was big and many-chinned, a mountain of a man who loved China and gin
  and his long daydreams. He dreamt of wonderful things, mostly impracticable.
  It was his joy and delight to feel that from this forgotten corner of the
  world he could pull levers and turn switches that would produce the most
  profound changes in the lot of mankind.</p>

  <p>A lethargic Haroun al-Raschid, he would have walked in disguise amidst the
  poor, showering gold upon the deserving. Only he could never find the right
  kind of poor.</p>

  <p>China is a land greatly conducive to dreaming. From where he sat he could
  glimpse the crowded waters of the Siang-kiang. In the light of the setting
  sun a streak of purple oil that appeared and disappeared behind the rambling
  skyline of Siangtan. The rhomboid sails of the sampans that go down to the
  big lake were bronze and golden in the last red rays, and from this distance
  the buzzing life of this vast hive of a city was neither apparent nor
  audible; nor, for the matter of that, smellable.</p>

  <p>Not that old Joe Bray objected to the scent which is China's. He knew this
  vast land from Manchuria to Kwang-si&mdash;from Shan-tung to the Kiao-Kio
  valley where the queer Mongolian folk talk pidgin French. And China was the
  greater part of the world to him. The sin and the stink of it were the
  normalities of life. He thought Chinese, would have lived Chinese but for
  that inexorable partner of his. He had tramped the provinces on foot, fought
  his way out of more forbidden towns than any man of his years, had been
  stripped for death in the Yamen of that infamous Fu-chi-ling, sometime
  governor of Su-kiang, and had been carried in honour in a mandarin's
  palanquin to the very court of the Daughter of Heaven.</p>

  <p>It was all one to Joe Bray, English by birth, American by barefaced claim
  when America found most favour, for he was a millionaire and more. His house
  on the little hill where the river turns was a palace. Coal had helped, and
  copper, and the trading-posts of the syndicate that went up as far as the
  Amur goldfields had added to the immense reserves which had accumulated with
  such marvellous rapidity in the past ten years.</p>

  <p>Joe could sit and dream, but rarely had his dreams materialized so
  faithfully as the vision which lolled in a deep deck-chair. Fing-Su was tall
  for a Chinaman and good-looking by European standards. But for the
  characteristic slant of his black eyes there was nothing that was typically
  Chinese about him. He had the petulant mouth and the straight, thin nose of
  his French mother, the jet-black hair and peculiar pallor of old Shan Hu,
  that crafty old merchant and adventurer, his father. He wore now a thick
  padded silk coat and shapeless trousers that ran into his shoes. His hands
  were respectfully hidden in the loose sleeves of his coat, and when he
  brought one to daylight to flick the ash from his cigarette, he returned it
  mechanically, instinctively, to its hiding-place.</p>

  <p>Joe Bray signed and sipped at his potion.</p>

  <p>"You got everything right, Fing-Su. A country that's got no head has got
  no feet&mdash;it can't move&mdash;it's just gotter stand still and go bad!
  That's China. There's been some big fellers here&mdash;the Mings
  and&mdash;and old man Hart and Li Hung."</p>

  <p>He sighed again, his knowledge of ancient China and her dynasties was
  nothing at all.</p>

  <p>"Money's nothing unless you use it right. Look at me, Fing-Su! Neither
  chick nor child, an' worth millions&mdash;millions! My line as they say, is
  finished&mdash;almost."</p>

  <p>He rubbed his nose irritably.</p>

  <p>"Almost," he repeated, with an air of caution. "If Certain People do what
  I want 'em to do it won't be&mdash;but will Certain People do it? That's the
  question."</p>

  <p>Fing-Su surveyed him with his fathomless eyes.</p>

  <p>"One would have imagined that you had but to express a wish for that wish
  to be fulfilled."</p>

  <p>The young Chinaman spoke with that queerly exaggerated drawl which is
  peculiar to the University of Oxford. Nothing gave Joe Bray greater pleasure
  than to hear his protégé's voice; the culture in it, the pedantry of each
  constructed sentence, the unconscious air of superiority of tone and manner,
  were music to the ears of the dreamer.</p>

  <p>Fing-Su was indeed a graduate of Oxford University and a Bachelor of Arts,
  and Joe had performed this miracle.</p>

  <p>"You're an educated man, Fing, and I'm a poor old roughneck without
  hist'ry, geography or anything. Books don't interest me and never did. The
  Bible&mdash;especially Revelation&mdash;that's a book and a half."</p>

  <p>He swallowed the remainder of the colourless liquor in his glass and
  exhaled a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"There's one thing, son&mdash;them shares I gave you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A long and awkward pause. The chair creaked as the big man moved
  uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"It appears from somethin' He said that I oughtn't to have done it. See
  what I mean? They're no value&mdash;it was one of His ideas that they was
  ever got out. Not worth a cent 's far as money goes."</p>

  <p>"Does He know that I have them?" asked Fing-Su.</p>

  <p>Like Joe, he never referred to Clifford Lynne by name, but gave the
  necessary pronoun a significant value.</p>

  <p>"No, He <i>doesn't</i>." said Joe emphatically. "That's the trouble. But
  he talked about 'em the other night. Said that I mustn't part with one
  &mdash;not one!"</p>

  <p>"My revered and honoured father had nine," said Fing-Su, in his silkiest
  tone, "and now I have twenty-four."</p>

  <p>Joe rubbed his unshaven chin. He was in a fret of apprehension.</p>

  <p>"I give 'em to you&mdash;you've been a good boy, Fing-Su... Latin an'
  philos'phy an' everything. I'm crazy about education an' naturally I wanted
  to do somep'n' for you. Great stuff, education." He hesitated, pulling at his
  lower lip. "I'm not the kind of man who gives a thing and takes it back
  again. But you know what he is, Fing-Su."</p>

  <p>"He hates me," said Fing-Su dispassionately. "Yesterday he called me a
  yellow snake."</p>

  <p>"<i>Did</i> he?" asked Joe dismally.</p>

  <p>His tone conveyed his utter helplessness to rectify a distressing state of
  affairs.</p>

  <p>"I'll get round him sooner or later," he said, with a wan effort to appear
  confident. "I'm artful, Fing-Su&mdash;got ideas back of my mind that nobody
  knows. I gotta scheme now..."</p>

  <p>He chuckled at a secret thought, but instantly became sober again.</p>

  <p>"... about these shares. I'll give you a couple of thousand for 'em
  &mdash;sterling. Not worth a cent! But I'll give you a couple of
  thousand."</p>

  <p>The Chinaman moved slightly in his chair and presently raised his black
  eyes to his patron.</p>

  <p>"Mr Bray, of what use is money to me?" he asked, almost humbly. "My
  revered and honoured father left me rich. I am a poor Chinaman with few
  necessities."</p>

  <p>Fing-Su threw away his burnt-out cigarette and rolled another with
  extraordinary dexterity. Almost before paper and tobacco were in his hands
  they had become a smoking white cylinder.</p>

  <p>"In Shanghai and Canton they say that the Yun Nan Company has more money
  than the Government has ever seen," he said slowly. "They say that the Lolo
  people found gold in Liao-Lio valley&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We found it," said Joe complacently. "These Lolo couldn't find anything
  except excuses to burn down Chinese temples."</p>

  <p>"But you have the money," insisted Fing-Su. "Idle money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not idle&mdash;gettin' four 'n' half per cent on it," murmured Joe.</p>

  <p>Fing-Su smiled.</p>

  <p>"Four and a half per cent! And you could get a hundred! Up in Shan-si
  there is a billion dollars worth of coal&mdash;a million times a billion! You
  can't work it, I know&mdash;there is no strong man sitting in the Forbidden
  City to say 'Do this' and it is done. And if there was, he would have no
  army. There is an investment for your reserves; a strong man."</p>

  <p>"I dessay."</p>

  <p>Joe Bray looked round fearfully. He hated Chinese politics&mdash;and He
  hated them worse.</p>

  <p>"Fing-Su," he said awkwardly, "that long-faced American consul was up here
  to tiffin yesterday. He got quite het up about your Joyful Hands &mdash;said
  there was too many 'parlours' in the country anyway. An' the central
  government's been makin' inquiries. Ho Sing was here last week askin' when
  you reckoned you would be goin' back to London."</p>

  <p>The Chinaman's thin lips curled in a smile.</p>

  <p>"They give too great an importance to my little club," he said. "It is
  purely social&mdash;we have no politics. Mr Bray, don't you think that it
  would be a good idea if Yun Nan reserves were used&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Nothin' doin'!" Joe shook his head violently. "I can't touch 'em anyway.
  Now about them shares, Fing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They are at my bankers in Shanghai&mdash;they shall be returned," said
  Fing-Su. "I wish our friend liked me. For him I have nothing but respect and
  admiration. Yellow Snake! That was unkind!"</p>

  <p>His palanquin was waiting to carry him back to his house and Joe Bray
  watched the trotting coolies until a turn of the hill road hid them from
  view.</p>

  <p>At Fing-Su's little house three men were waiting, squatting on their
  haunches before the door. He dismissed his bearers and beckoned the men into
  the dark mat-covered room which served him as a study.</p>

  <p>"Two hours after sunset, Clifford Lynne" (he gave him his Chinese name)
  "comes into the city by the Gate of Beneficent Rice. Kill him and every paper
  that he carries bring to me."</p>

  <p>Clifford came to the minute, but through the Mandarin Gate, and the
  watchers missed him. They reported to their master, but he already knew of
  Clifford's return and the way by which he came.</p>

  <p>"You will have many opportunities," said Fing-Su, Bachelor of Arts. "And
  perhaps it is well that this thing did not happen whilst I was in the city.
  Tomorrow I go back to England, and I will bring back Power!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02">CHAPTER TWO</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was exactly six months after Fing-Su left for Europe,
  that the partners of Narth Brothers sat behind locked doors in their
  boardroom in London, facing an unusual situation. Stephen Narth sat at the
  head of the table; his big, heavy, white face with its perpetual frown
  indicated that he was more than usually troubled.</p>

  <p>Major Gregory Spedwell, yellow and cadaverous, sat on his right. Major
  Spedwell with his black, curly hair and his cigarette-stained fingers, had a
  history that was not entirely military.</p>

  <p>Facing him was Ferdinand Leggat, a wholesome John Bull figure, with his
  healthy-looking face and his side-whiskers, though in truth the wholesomeness
  of his appearance was not borne out by his general character, for 'John Bull
  Leggat' had endured many vicissitudes which were not wholly creditable to
  himself&mdash;before he came to the anchor of comparatively respectable
  harbourage of Narth Brothers Ltd.</p>

  <p>There had been a time when the name of Narth was one with which one could
  conjure in the City of London. Thomas Ammot Narth, the father of the present
  head of the firm, had conducted a very excellent, though limited, business on
  the Stock Exchange, and had for his clients some of the noblest houses in
  England.</p>

  <p>His son had inherited his business acumen without his discrimination, and
  in consequence, whilst he had increased the business of the firm in volume,
  he had accepted clients of a character which did not find favour with the
  older supporters of his firm, and when he found himself in court, as he did
  on one or two occasions, disputing the accuracy of clients' instructions, the
  older supporters of his house had fallen away, and he was left with a clerk
  and speculator which offered him the opportunities rather of sporadic coups
  than the steadiness of income which is the sure foundation of prosperity.</p>

  <p>He had eked out the bad times by the flotation of numerous companies. Some
  of these had been mildly successful, but the majority had pursued an
  inevitable and exciting course which landed them eventually before that
  official whose unhappy duty it is to arrange the winding up of companies.</p>

  <p>It was in the course of these adventures that Stephen Narth had met Mr
  Leggat, a Galician oil speculator, who also conducted a theatrical agency and
  a moneylending business, and was generally to be found on the ground floor of
  jerry-built flotations.</p>

  <p>The business which had brought the three members of the firm at nine
  o'clock in the morning to their cold and uninviting offices at Minchester
  House had nothing whatever to do with the ordinary business of the firm. Mr
  Leggat said as much, being somewhat oracular in his methods.</p>

  <p>"Let us have the matter fair and square," he said. "This business of ours
  is as near to bankruptcy as makes no difference. I say bankruptcy, and for
  the time being we will let the matter stay right there. What may be revealed
  at the bankruptcy proceedings doesn't affect Spedwell and doesn't affect me.
  I haven't speculated with the company's money&mdash;neither has
  Spedwell."</p>

  <p>"You knew&mdash;" began Narth hotly.</p>

  <p>"I knew nothing." Mr Leggat waved him to silence. "The auditors tell us
  that the sum of fifty thousand pounds is unaccounted for. Somebody has been
  gambling on 'Change&mdash;not me; not Spedwell."</p>

  <p>"It was on your advice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Again Mr Leggat held up his hand.</p>

  <p>"This isn't the moment for recrimination. We're short fifty thousand, more
  or less. Where and how are we going to raise the money?"</p>

  <p>His eyes met Spedwell's, and for an instant of time that saturnine man
  showed evidence of approval and amusement.</p>

  <p>"It is all very well for you fellows to talk," growled Narth, wiping his
  moist face with a silk handkerchief. "You were all in the oil
  speculation&mdash;both of you!"</p>

  <p>Mr Leggat smiled and shrugged his broad shoulders, but made no
  comment.</p>

  <p>"Fifty thousand pounds is a lot of money." Spedwell spoke for the first
  time.</p>

  <p>"An awful lot," agreed his friend, and waited for Mr Narth to speak.</p>

  <p>"We didn't come here today to discuss what we already know," said Narth
  impatiently, "but to find a remedy. How are we going to face the music? That
  is the question."</p>

  <p>"And simply answered, I think," said Mr Leggat, almost jovially. "I for
  one have no desire to face again&mdash;when I say 'again' let me correct
  myself and say for the first time&mdash;the miseries of Wormwood Scrubbs. We
  have&mdash;I should say you have&mdash;got to raise the money. There remains
  only one possibility," said Mr Leggat slowly, and all the time he was
  speaking his keen eyes did not leave Stephen Narth's face. "You are the
  nephew or cousin of Mr Joseph Bray, and, as all the world knows, Mr Joseph
  Bray is rich beyond the dreams of avarice. He is reputedly the wealthiest man
  in China, and I understand&mdash;correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that you and
  your family are in receipt of a yearly stipend&mdash;pension&mdash;from this
  gentleman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Two thousand a year," broke in Narth loudly. "That has nothing whatever
  to do with this business!"</p>

  <p>Mr Leggat glanced at the Major and smiled.</p>

  <p>"The man who allows you two thousand a year must be approachable on one
  side or another. To Joseph Bray fifty thousand pounds is that!" He snapped
  his finger. "My dear Narth, this is the situation. In four months' time,
  possibly sooner, you will stand your trial at the Old Bailey, unless you can
  secure the money to lock up the bloodhounds who will soon be on your
  trail."</p>

  <p>"On all our trails," said Narth sullenly. "I'm not going alone
  &mdash;understand that! And you can get out of your head the idea that I can
  persuade old Joe Bray to send me a cent more. He is as hard as nails and his
  manager is harder. You don't suppose that I haven't tried him before, do you?
  I tell you he is impossible."</p>

  <p>Mr Leggat looked at Major Spedwell again, and they both sighed and rose as
  though some signal, invisible to Narth, had been given.</p>

  <p>"We will meet the day after tomorrow," said Leggat, "and you had better
  work the cable to China, because the only alternative to Mr Joseph Bray may
  be even more unpleasant than penal servitude."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded Narth, rage in his smouldering eyes.</p>

  <p>"I mean," said Mr Leggat, as he lit a cigar with great deliberation, "the
  assistance of the gentleman named Mr Grahame St Clay."</p>

  <p>"And who the devil is Grahame St Clay?" asked the astonished Narth.</p>

  <p>Mr Leggat smiled cryptically.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03">CHAPTER THREE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Stephen Narth ordinarily left his office in Old Broad Street
  at four o'clock, at which hour his limousine was waiting to carry him to his
  beautiful house at Sunningdale. But this evening he lingered on, not because
  he had any especial business to transact, or because he needed the time to
  brood over his unfortunate position, but because the China mail was due by
  the five o'clock post, and he expected the monthly draft to which Leggat had
  made reference.</p>

  <p>Joseph Bray was his second cousin, and in the days when the Narths were
  princes of commerce and the Brays the poorest of poor relations (they called
  themselves Bray-Narth, but old Joseph had dropped the hyphenated style, being
  a man of little education), the great family was scarcely cognisant of Joe
  Bray's movements. Until, ten years before, Mr Narth had received a letter
  from his cousin saying that he was anxious to get in touch with his only
  relative, they were unaware that such a man as Joseph existed, and Mr Stephen
  Narth's first inclination, as he read the ill-spelt, illiterate letter, was
  to tear it up and throw it into the wastepaper basket, for he had sufficient
  troubles of his own without being called upon to shoulder the burden of
  distant relatives. It was only at the tag-end of the letter that he
  discovered his correspondent was that Bray whose name was famous in the Stock
  Exchanges of the world&mdash;the veritable Bray, of Yun Nan Concession.
  Thereafter, Joseph assumed a new importance.</p>

  <p>They had never met. He had seen a photograph of the old man, grim and grey
  and hard, and it was probably this picture which had inhibited those appeals
  for further help which he so glibly claimed to have sent.</p>

  <p>Perkins, his clerk, came in with a letter soon after five.</p>

  <p>"Miss Joan came this afternoon, sir, whilst you were at the board
  meeting."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" replied Stephen Narth indifferently.</p>

  <p>Here was a Bray that represented a responsibility, one of the two members
  of the cadet family he had known about until old Joseph's letter came. She
  was a distant cousin, had been brought up in his home and had received the
  good but inexpensive education to which poor relations are entitled. Her
  position in his household he would have found it difficult to define. Joan
  was very useful. She could take charge of the house when the girls were away.
  She could keep accounts and could replace a housekeeper or, for the matter of
  that, a housemaid. Though she was a little younger than Letty, and very much
  younger than Mabel, she could serve to chaperone either.</p>

  <p>Sometimes she joined the theatre parties that the girls organized, and
  occasionally she went to a dance when an extra partner was wanted. But
  usually Joan Bray remained in the background. There were times when it was
  inconvenient even that she should join one of his select little dinner
  parties, and then Joan had her meal in her big attic room, and, if the truth
  be told, was more than a little relieved.</p>

  <p>"What did she want?" asked Mr Narth as he cut open the flap of the only
  letter that counted.</p>

  <p>"She wanted to know if there was anything to take back to Sunningdale. She
  came up to do some shopping with Miss Letty," said his old clerk, and then:
  "She asked me if any of the young ladies had telephoned about the
  Chinamen."</p>

  <p>"Chinamen?"</p>

  <p>Perkins explained. There had appeared that morning in the grounds of Sunni
  Lodge two yellow men, "not wearing much clothing either." Letty had seen them
  lying in the long grass near the farm meadow&mdash;two powerful-looking men,
  who at the sight of her had leapt up and had fled to the little plantation
  which divided Lord Knowesley's estate from the less pretentious domain of Mr
  Narth.</p>

  <p>"Miss Letty was a little frightened," said Perkins.</p>

  <p>Miss Letty, who lived on the raw edge of hysteria, would be frightened,
  undoubtedly.</p>

  <p>"Miss Joan thought the men belonged to a circus which passed through
  Sunningdale this morning," said Perkins.</p>

  <p>Mr Narth saw little in the incident, and beyond making a mental note to
  bring the matter to the notice of the local police, dismissed from his mind
  all thought of Chinamen.</p>

  <p>Slowly he tore open the flap of the envelope. The cheque was there, but
  also, as he had realized when he handled the package, a letter of unusual
  length. Joe Bray was not in the habit of sending long epistles. As a rule, a
  sheet of paper bearing the inscription 'With Comps.' was all that accompanied
  the draft.</p>

  <p>He folded the purple-coloured draft and put it into his pocket, and then
  began to read the letter, wondering why this relative of his had grown
  suddenly so communicative. It was written in his own crabbed hand and every
  fourth word was mis-spelt.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Mr Narth (Joe never addressed him in any other way). I
  dare say you will wonder why I have written to you such a long letter. Well,
  dear Mr Narth, I must tell you that I have had a bad stroke, and am only
  getting better very slowly. The doctor says he can't be sure how long I've
  got to live, so I thought I would fix up the future and make a will, which I
  have now done, through Mr Albert Van Rys, the lawyer. Dear Mr Narth, I must
  tell you that I have got a great admiration for your family, as you well
  know, and I have been long thinking how I should help your family, and this
  is what I have done. My manager, Clifford Lynne, who has been with me since a
  boy and was my partner when I found this reef, is a good young fellow
  (Clifford Lynne, I mean), so I have decided he should marry into my family
  and keep the name going. I know you have several girls in your house, two
  daughters and a cousin, and I want Clifford to marry one of these, which he
  has agreed to do. He is on his way over now and should be with you any day.
  My will is as follows: I leave you two thirds of my share in the mine,
  one-third to Clifford, on condition that one of these girls marries him. If
  these girls refuse, all the money goes to Clifford. The marriage is to occur
  before the thirty-first of December of this year. Dear Mr Narth, if this is
  not agreeable to you, you will get nothing on my death.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours sincerely, Jos. Bray.</p><br>

  <p>Stephen Narth read the letter open-mouthed, his mind in a whirl. Salvation
  had come from the most unexpected quarter. He rang a bell to summon the clerk
  and gave him a few hasty instructions, and, not waiting for the lift, ran
  down the stairs and boarded his car. All the way to Sunningdale he turned
  over in his mind the letter and its strange proposal.</p>

  <p>Mabel, of course! She was the eldest. Or Letty&mdash;the money was as good
  as in his pocket...</p>

  <p>As the car went up the drive between bushes of flowering rhododendrons he
  was almost gay, and he sprang out with a smile so radiant that the watchful
  Mabel, who saw him from the lawn, realized that something unusual had
  happened and came running to meet him, as Letty appeared at the big front
  door. They were handsome girls, a little plumper than he could wish, and the
  elder inclined to take a sour view of life which was occasionally
  uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"... <i>Did</i> you hear about those horrid Chinamen?" Mabel fired the
  question as he stepped from the car. "Poor Letty nearly had a fit!"</p>

  <p>Ordinarily he would have snapped her to silence, for he was a man who was
  irritated by the trivialities of life, and the irruption of a yellow
  trespasser or two was not a matter to interest him. But now he could afford
  to smile indulgently and could make a joke of his daughter's alarming
  experience.</p>

  <p>"My dear, there was nothing to be afraid of&mdash;yes, Perkins told me all
  about it. The poor fellows were probably as much scared as Letty! Come into
  the library; I have something rather important to tell you."</p>

  <p>He took them into the handsomely appointed room, shut the door and told
  his astonishing news, which, to his consternation, was received silently.
  Mabel took out her perennial cigarette, flicked the ash on the carpet and
  looked across at her sister, and then:</p>

  <p>"It's all very fine for you, father, but where do we come in?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Where do you come in?" said her parent in astonishment. "Isn't it clear
  where you come in? This fellow gets a third of the fortune&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But how much of the third do we get?" asked Letty, the younger. "And
  besides, who is this manager? With all that money, father, we ought to do
  better than a mine manager."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence here which Mabel broke.</p>

  <p>"We shall have to depend on you for the settlement, anyway," she said.
  "This old gentleman seems to think it quite good enough for any girl if her
  husband is rich. But it wouldn't be good enough for me."</p>

  <p>Stephen Narth turned suddenly cold. He had never dreamt that opposition
  would come from this quarter.</p>

  <p>"But don't you see, girls, that unless one of you marries this fellow we
  get nothing? Of course I would do the right thing by you&mdash;I'd make a
  handsome settlement."</p>

  <p>"How much is he leaving?" asked the practical Mabel. "That's the crux of
  the whole question. I tell you frankly I'm not going to buy a pig in a poke;
  and besides, what is to be our social position? We'd probably have to go back
  to China and live in some horrible shanty."</p>

  <p>She sat on the edge of the library table, clasping her crossed knee, and
  in this attitude she reminded Stephen Narth of a barmaid he had known in his
  early youth. There was something coarse about Mabel which was not softened by
  the abbreviation of her skirts or by the beauty of her shingled head.</p>

  <p>"I've had enough scrimping and saving," she went on, "and I tell you
  honestly, that so far as marriage with an unknown man is concerned, you can
  count me out."</p>

  <p>"And me," said Letty firmly. "It is quite right what Mabel says, there is
  no position at all for this wretched man's wife."</p>

  <p>"I dare say he would do the right thing," said Stephen Narth feebly. He
  was entirely dominated by these two daughters of his.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Mabel leapt to her feet and stepped down to the floor, her eyes
  shining.</p>

  <p>"I've got it&mdash;Cinderella!"</p>

  <p>"Cinderella?" He frowned.</p>

  <p>"Joan, of course, you great booby! Read the letter again."</p>

  <p>They listened breathlessly, and when he came near to the end, Letty
  squeaked her delight.</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;Joan!" she said. "There's no reason why Joan shouldn't
  marry. It would be an excellent thing for her&mdash;her prospects are
  practically nil, and she'd be an awful bore, father, if you were very rich.
  Goodness knows what we could do with her."</p>

  <p>"Joan!" He fondled his chin thoughtfully. Somehow he had never considered
  Joan as a factor. For the fourth time he read the letter word by word. The
  girls were right. Joan fulfilled all Joe Bray's requirements. She was a
  member of the family. Her mother had been a Narth. Before he had put the
  letter down, Letty had pressed the bell on the table and the butler came
  in.</p>

  <p>"Tell Miss Bray to come here, Palmer," she said, and three minutes later a
  girl walked into the library&mdash;the sacrifice which the House of Narth
  designed to propitiate the gods of fortune.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04">CHAPTER FOUR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Joan Bray was twenty-one, but looked younger. She was
  slim&mdash;Letty was in the habit of describing her as 'painfully thin',
  without good reason. The Narths were full-faced, full-chinned people,
  fair-headed and a trifle lethargic. Joan was supple of body and vital. Every
  movement of her was definite, intentional. In repose she had the poise of an
  aristocrat. ("She always knows where to put her hands," admitted Letty
  reluctantly.) In movement she had the lithe ease of one whom movement was a
  joy. Ten years of snubbing, of tacit suppression, of being put away and out
  of sight when she was not required, had neither broken her spirit nor crushed
  her confidence.</p>

  <p>She stood now, a half-smile in the grey eyes that laughed very readily,
  looking from one to the other, realizing that something had happened which
  was out of the ordinary. Her colour had a delicacy that the bold beauty of
  her cousins could not eclipse, nor yet set off, for she was as a picture that
  needed no lighting or contrasts to reveal its wonders.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr Narth." She had always called him by the formal title.
  "I've finished the quarter's accounts, and they are terrific!"</p>

  <p>At any other time Stephen would have writhed at the news, but the sense of
  coming fortune made the question of a hundred pounds, more or less, a matter
  of supreme indifference.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Joan," he said, and wonderingly she pulled up a chair and sat
  sideways upon it, resting one arm on the back.</p>

  <p>"Will you read this letter?" He passed it across to Letty who handed it to
  the girl.</p>

  <p>She read in silence, and when she had finished, smiled.</p>

  <p>"That's awfully good news. I'm very glad," she said, and looked
  quizzically from one girl to the other. "And who is the lovely bride to
  be?"</p>

  <p>Her unconquerable cheerfulness was an offence in the eyes of Mabel at the
  best of times. Now the cool assumption that one or other of them was to
  efface herself in the obscurity of a Chinese town, brought the red to her
  full neck.</p>

  <p>"Don't be stupid, Joan," she said sharply. "This is a very serious
  question&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear"&mdash;Stephen saw the need for tact&mdash;"Clifford Lynne is a
  very good fellow&mdash;one of the best," he said enthusiastically, though he
  had no more knowledge of Clifford Lynne's character, appearance or general
  disposition than he had of any labourer his car had passed that afternoon.
  "This is one of the greatest chances that has ever&mdash;er&mdash;come our
  way. As a matter of fact," he said very carefully, "this is not the only
  letter I have had from dear old Joseph. There was another
  which&mdash;urn&mdash;put his view more clearly."</p>

  <p>She looked as though she expected him to pass this mysterious letter to
  her, but he did not, for the simple reason that it had no existence except in
  his imagination.</p>

  <p>"The truth is, my dear, Joseph wishes you to marry this man."</p>

  <p>The girl rose slowly to her feet, her thinly pencilled eyebrows gathered
  in a frown of amazement.</p>

  <p>"He wishes me to marry him?" she repeated. "But I don't know the man."</p>

  <p>"Neither do we," said Letty calmly. "It isn't a question of knowing.
  Anyway, how do you know any fellow you are going to marry? You see a man for
  a few minutes every day and you haven't the slightest idea what his nature
  is. It is only when you are married that his real self comes out."</p>

  <p>She was not making matters any easier for Mr Narth, and with a nod he
  silenced her.</p>

  <p>"Joan," he said, "I have been very good to you&mdash;I've given you a
  home, and I've done something more than that, as you well know."</p>

  <p>He looked at the girls and signalled them out of the room. When the door
  had closed on Letty:</p>

  <p>"Joan, I am going to be very frank with you," he said.</p>

  <p>It was not the first time he had been frank, and she could guess what was
  coming. She once had a brother, a wild, irresponsible youth, who had been
  employed by Narth Brothers, and had left hurriedly, carrying with him the
  cash contents of the safe&mdash;a few hundreds of pounds. He had expiated the
  crime with his life&mdash;for he was found on a Kentish road dead by the
  wreckage of the car in which he was making his way to a Channel port. And
  there was an invalid mother of Joan Bray's whose last years of life had been
  supported on Mr Narth's bounty. ("We can't let her go to the workhouse,
  father," Mabel had said; "if it gets into the newspapers there will be an
  awful scandal"&mdash;Mabel was Mabel even at the tender age of sixteen.)</p>

  <p>"It is not for me to remind you of what I have done for your family,"
  began Stephen&mdash;and proceeded to remind her. "I have given you a home and
  a social life which ordinarily would not have been yours. You have now a
  chance of repaying me for my generosity; I particularly wish that you marry
  this man."</p>

  <p>She licked her dry lips, but did not raise her eyes from the carpet on
  which they were fixed.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear me?"</p>

  <p>She nodded and rose slowly.</p>

  <p>"You really want me to marry him?"</p>

  <p>"I want you to be a rich woman," he said emphatically. "I am not asking
  you to make any sacrifice. I am putting in your way an opportunity that nine
  girls out of ten would jump at."</p>

  <p>There was a tap at the door: it was the butler and he bore on a silver
  salver a brown envelope. Mr Narth took the telegram, opened it, read, and
  gasped.</p>

  <p>"He's dead," he said in a hushed voice. "Old Joe Bray!"</p>

  <p>Swiftly he made a mental calculation. It was the first day of June. If he
  could get her married within a month he could stave off the ruin that
  threatened Narth Brothers. Their eyes met: hers calm, steady, questioning,
  his speculative and remorseless.</p>

  <p>"You will marry him?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose so," she said quietly, and his sigh of relief brought the
  first twinge of bitterness that her heart had known.</p>

  <p>"You are a very sensible girl, and you'll not regret it," he said eagerly,
  as he came round and took her cold hands in his. "I can assure you,
  Joan&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He turned his head at the knock. It was the butler.</p>

  <p>"There is a gentleman to see you, sir."</p>

  <p>He got so far, when the visitor pushed past him and walked into the room.
  He was a tall man, dressed in a stained, ill-fitting suit of rough homespun.
  His shoes were of undressed leather and apparently home-made. He was
  collarless. A soft shirt, opened at the throat, a battered hat in his hand
  almost completed the picture. But it was at his face that the girl was
  gazing.</p>

  <p>Joan could only stare in amazement, for never had she seen his like
  before. His hair was long and brown and wavy. He wore a long, straggly beard
  that came down to his breast.</p>

  <p>"Who the devil&mdash;" began the astonished Mr Stephen Narth.</p>

  <p>"My name is Clifford Lynne," said the apparition. "I understand I've got
  to marry somebody. Who is it?"</p>

  <p>They stared at the uncouth man, and then Letty, who had followed him in,
  began to laugh hysterically.</p>

  <p>"Mr Lynne&mdash;" stammered Stephen Narth.</p>

  <p>Before the man could reply, came a dramatic interruption. There was a
  whispered colloquy between the butler and somebody in the hall outside.
  Looking past them, Mr Narth saw a maid holding a square box.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>The butler reached out of the door and came back with the box in his
  hands. It was a new box with a sliding lid, about a foot square.</p>

  <p>"Mr Lynne?" he said awkwardly, like one who found himself in a situation
  which he did not fit.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>The bearded man spun round. All his movements, Joan noted unconsciously,
  had a certain abruptness.</p>

  <p>"For me?"</p>

  <p>He put the box on the table and frowned at it. Painted neatly on the top
  in red letters were the words:</p>

  <p>CLIFFORD LYNNE, ESQ. (to await arrival)</p>

  <p>As his hand went out to slip back the lid, a cold shiver ran down the
  girl's spine. She had an unaccountable premonition of some terrible danger,
  she knew not what.</p>

  <p>"What the devil is this?" demanded the amazing stranger.</p>

  <p>The lid was off; there was nothing to be seen but a mass of fleecy
  cottonwool... but it was moving in weird undulations.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly from the white fleece poked up a spade-shaped head and two
  black bead-like eyes that glittered malignantly.</p>

  <p>In a fraction of a second the head was followed by a long, sinuous body
  that swayed for a moment, then, whipping back, darted the ugly head
  forward.</p>

  <p>The snake had misjudged the distance&mdash;and missed! It lay across the
  table, its head dangling, the tail still concealed in the cottonwool. Only
  for an infinitesimal space of time it sprawled thus.</p>

  <p>Whilst the terrified company stood paralysed to silence by the horror of
  it, the black thing slid greasily to the floor. Up went the head again,
  swayed for a while and then again was flung back to strike...</p>

  <p>The explosion deafened them&mdash;through a haze of blue smoke Joan saw
  the headless thing coil and uncoil in death agony...</p>

  <p>"Hell's bells!" said Mr Clifford Lynne in wonder. "Who threw that
  brick?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05">CHAPTER FIVE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"A Chinaman brought it, sir," stammered the butler.</p>

  <p>"Chinaman!"</p>

  <p>The servant pointed feebly through the French window that led to the lawn.
  For a second he stood, this ludicrous figure with his ragged beard and his
  fantastically ill-fitting clothes, and then with a leap he was through the
  open window and flying across the strip of grass like the wind. In two
  seconds he had vanished over the high hazel hedge&mdash;this he took in his
  stride in some miraculous fashion.</p>

  <p>With his disappearance the spell was broken. Joan found a half-fainting
  girl on her hands, sobbing and laughing, hands clenched and feet inclined to
  tap the carpet in a way that was neither modern nor pretty. Under the table
  wriggled the dying snake&mdash;the room was hazy with smoke that smelt
  pungently.</p>

  <p>At the sound of the shot, Mabel came running in. She saw the snake on the
  floor, stared from her sister to Joan, from Joan to her white-faced
  father.</p>

  <p>"That horrible man&mdash;he tried to kill Letty!" She was shrill in her
  misdirected fury.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>When Stephen Narth snarled that way there was an end to hysteria. He
  became the dominant giver of household laws.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, all of you&mdash;damn you!... none of you has the sense of Joan.
  Get up!"</p>

  <p>Letty rose untidily, staggered, her eyes pleading for sympathy.</p>

  <p>"It was a snake." He stared down at the writhing thing with ludicrous
  solemnity. "Ugh! Throw that beast out of the room&mdash;use the tongs. Did he
  shoot it, Joan? I didn't see him use a pistol."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Nor I&mdash;I just heard the shot and that was all."</p>

  <p>Mr Narth pointed to the snake; the butler, tongs in hand, was snapping the
  ends tremblingly.</p>

  <p>"He said 'Hell's bells,'" nodded Joan gravely.</p>

  <p>The girls looked at their father.</p>

  <p>"Who was he&mdash;a tramp, daddy?" asked Letty.</p>

  <p>Mr Narth shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Clifford Lynne," he said, and they gasped in unison. That scarecrow!
  Letty's proper indignation overcame her more feminine emotions.</p>

  <p>"That...! Was he the man you wanted me... us...?"</p>

  <p>He glanced significantly at Joan. She was at the open window, her eyes
  shaded by a white hand from the glare of the afternoon sun. At the moment the
  butler was staggering to the lawn, a rope-like object gripped at the end of
  the tongs, Clifford Lynne came over the hedge, one leg after another in a
  flying leap, his absurd whiskers flowing all ways. He stopped at the sight of
  the snake.</p>

  <p>"Yellow head!" he said thoughtfully. "Yellow head&mdash;what a lad!"</p>

  <p>Letty dropped her voice as the queer man came leisurely into the room, his
  hands thrust into his pockets.</p>

  <p>"Has anybody seen a Chink about here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Letty and Mabel spoke together, though he was addressing the one person in
  the ornate library who was neither obviously palpitating or patently
  fearful.</p>

  <p>"Chinamen&mdash;two?" he said thoughtfully. "I thought so! Moses!"</p>

  <p>He walked to the window and stared out. Then he came back to the table,
  lifted the cottonwool gingerly from the box, layer by layer.</p>

  <p>"Only one, by gum! But what a perfect houndski!"</p>

  <p>He peered out into the sunlit garden.</p>

  <p>"Thought they'd use a knife. These fellows can throw a knife wonderfully.
  One of 'em killed a foreman of mine a year ago from a distance of a hundred
  and twenty yards."</p>

  <p>He was addressing Joan, and his voice was friendly and conversational.</p>

  <p>"Did you catch him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The bearded man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Got him on the law and order side of the mountains and hanged him. A nice
  fellow in many ways," he mused, "but temperamental. There is only one way to
  deal with a temperamental coolie, and that is to hang him."</p>

  <p>He was looking at Letty now, and she regarded his views on temperament as
  ill-timed, if not actually insulting. He saw her rosebud lips curl up in a
  smile, but did not feel uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"You?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She started.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I&mdash;I mean, what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>She knew very well what he meant. Clifford Lynne could broadcast thought,
  and in the tenseness of the moment her receptivity was particularly good.</p>

  <p>"I've got to marry somebody."</p>

  <p>He glanced now at Mabel Narth, darkly red, her baby blue eyes malignant
  with the contempt she felt.</p>

  <p>"Neither my sister nor I is the lucky girl," she said with a certain
  malicious sweetness. "You ought to know Joan... " She glanced round at Mr
  Narth. "Father!"</p>

  <p>Awkwardly enough he introduced the girl.</p>

  <p>"Oh!"</p>

  <p>Just "Oh!" It might have meant disappointment or relief or just
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I am here. Ready for the&mdash;" He hesitated for a word. Joan
  could have sworn that the word he almost used was "sacrifice," but he changed
  it to "occasion."</p>

  <p>"Old Joe Bray is dead," said the stranger. "I suppose you know that? Poor
  old lunatic! It would have been better for a lot of people if he had died six
  months ago. A dear old soul, a great old sportsman, but slightly mad."</p>

  <p>Again he addressed Joan. She could observe him now, for he was emerging
  from the blinding flash of his dramatic arrival. Close upon six feet in
  height, even his nondescript clothing could not disguise a fine physique. The
  face was tanned a deep mahogany. His straggling beard was as brown as his
  long hair and his rather shaggy eyebrows. This bearded man was
  alive&mdash;every inch of him. That was her first impression&mdash;his
  immense vitality. She glanced down at his shapeless shoes; they were
  home-made, she guessed, and whilst one was fastened with a thin piece of
  hide, the other lace was of string, and unravelled string at that.</p>

  <p>It was a moment for Mr Narth to assert his authority. Natural
  circumstances made him the most important person in the room. He was not only
  the head of the house, but he was the principal beneficiary under the will.
  And this man was old Joe Bray's manager, one to be ordered rather than
  persuaded; the merest employee&mdash;Mr Narth's employee in prospect, for if
  he was inheriting old Joe's wealth, he also inherited the indubitable
  authority which wealth carries with it.</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;Mr&mdash;um&mdash;Lynne, I think this discussion of my poor
  cousin's&mdash;state of mind is not quite proper, and I cannot allow you to
  asperse his&mdash;um&mdash;revered memory without protest."</p>

  <p>The stranger was looking at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're Narth, are you&mdash;I've heard about you! You're the
  gentleman who speculates with other people's money!"</p>

  <p>Stephen Narth went red and white. He was for the moment speechless. The
  crudeness of the statement was paralysing. Had Mr Narth been wise, he would
  have arrested all further comment, either by walking from the room or by a
  direct and tremendous rebuke.</p>

  <p>"These things get about," said Lynne, stroking his beard. "You can't turn
  the light off a business like yours."</p>

  <p>Stephen Narth got back his voice.</p>

  <p>"I am not prepared to discuss such wanton slanders," he said. There was
  murder in his eyes if Clifford Lynne had ever seen murder. "For the moment it
  is necessary to tell you that as the sole beneficiary under Mr Bray's will
  and&mdash;er&mdash;proprietor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In prospect," murmured Lynne, when he paused. "You feel that I ought to
  keep in my place? I am almost inclined to agree. Do you want me?"</p>

  <p>He stared at Joan, his expression blank, almost fatuous. She had an odd
  inclination to laugh.</p>

  <p>"Because," he went on, "if you want me I'm here and ready. The Lord knows
  I don't want to force my attentions upon any shrinking maiden, but there's
  the position. Joe said, 'Will you give me your word?' and I said 'Yes.'"</p>

  <p>He was still staring at her thoughtfully. Did he expect an answer, she
  wondered. Apparently not, for he went on:</p>

  <p>"This complicates matters&mdash;I had no idea we should annoy the Joyful
  Hands&mdash;but I've been and gone and done it!"</p>

  <p>Mr Narth thought that it was a moment when he might without loss of
  dignity edge himself into the conversation on nearly equal terms.</p>

  <p>"The Joyful Hands, I think you said&mdash;who on earth are the Joyful
  Hands?"</p>

  <p>The stranger did not seem to resent the intrusion, and Stephen Narth had
  the queer sensation that the admonishment directed to him a few seconds
  before was in the nature of a statement of fact made without any real
  disapproval or malice. Clifford Lynne knew but did not condemn.</p>

  <p>"I have taken the Lodge&mdash;the Slaters' Cottage, don't they call it?"
  said Clifford in his strangely abrupt way. "A weird hole, but suitable for
  me. I'm afraid I've made rather a mess of your carpet."</p>

  <p>He looked down gloomily at the evidence of tragedy.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, snakes have no right to be on carpets," he said in a tone of
  relief, as though he had found an unexpected excuse for the disorder he had
  created.</p>

  <p>Mr Narth's face fell.</p>

  <p>"You're staying here, are you?" he asked, and it was on the tip of his
  tongue to suggest that the stranger, in all his future visits, should come
  into the house by the servants' entrance. But something inhibited this
  discourteous expression. A man who could treat grand larceny as a matter of
  indifference, who carried on his person lethal weapons which he could draw,
  use and replace so quickly that no mortal eye could see his hand's movement,
  was not to be insulted with impunity. Instead:</p>

  <p>"The Slaters' Cottage isn't a very nice place for you," he said. "It is
  little better than a ruin. I had it offered to me the other day for a hundred
  and twenty pounds and refused it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You missed a bargain," said Cliff Lynne calmly. "It has a Tudor fireplace
  worth twice that amount."</p>

  <p>He was looking absently at the girl as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't be surprised if I settled down in the Slaters' Cottage," he
  was musing aloud. "There's a lovely scullery, where one's wife could do one's
  washing, and three perfectly good rooms&mdash;once the rat-holes are stopped
  up. Personally, I have no objection to rats."</p>

  <p>"And I am rather fond of them," said Joan coolly, for she was quick to see
  the challenge and as quick to take it up.</p>

  <p>For a second the faintest ghost of a smile showed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I'm staying here. And don't be scared of losing your reputation,
  because I shan't call very often." He pursed his lips. "Chink! And of course
  the heathen saw me come in, and delivered the goods instanter! Daren't do it
  before, or you'd have heard the wriggler lashing out inside the box. Or he'd
  have died&mdash;there were no holes in the lid. I'll have to put the Dumb
  Friends' League on to these fellows!"</p>

  <p>Mr Narth cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"Do you suggest that that reptile was sent to you&mdash;maliciously?"</p>

  <p>Clifford Lynne turned his amused eyes upon the questioner.</p>

  <p>"A live, poisonous snake is not my idea of a birthday present," he said
  gently. "And I hate Yellow Heads&mdash;they hurt!" He slapped his thigh with
  sudden energy and laughed. "Why, of course! Yellow snake! Fancy my forgetting
  that!"</p>

  <p>Again his eyes sought the girl's.</p>

  <p>"You're getting a pretty careless husband... I didn't get your name...
  Joan, is it? I thought all the Joans were married, but perhaps I'm thinking
  of the Dorothys! You're about twenty-one, aren't you? All the Joans are about
  twenty-one, all the Patricias are seventeen, and most of the Mary Anns are
  drawing their Old Age Pensions."</p>

  <p>"And all the Cliffords are on the stage," she retorted, and this time he
  laughed. It was a soft, musical gurgle of sound, so unlike his forbidding
  appearance that it seemed to be a new and a different man breaking through
  the outward sham and disguise of him.</p>

  <p>"You made that up on the spur of the moment!" he said, lifting an
  admonitory finger. "But I deserved it."</p>

  <p>He dived into the pockets of his nondescript coat, brought out a large
  gunmetal watch and consulted it.</p>

  <p>"Not going!" he said disgustedly and, shaking, held it to his ear. "What's
  the time?"</p>

  <p>"Six," said Mr Narth, recovering his voice.</p>

  <p>"I knew it couldn't be half past twelve," said the visitor, calmly
  adjusting the hands. "I'll be getting back. I'm renting a place in London for
  the moment, but I'll be down tomorrow or the day after. Church of
  England?"</p>

  <p>Joan, to whom this question was fired, nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm a bit that way myself," admitted Mr Lynne, "but with leaning towards
  incense and good music. But I admire Baptists&mdash;how they keep good on
  varnish and harmoniums beats me! So long, Dorothy!"</p>

  <p>"You mean Agnes," said Joan, and her eyes gleamed again.</p>

  <p>She held out a hand and felt her own enfolded in a strong grip. Apparently
  he deemed no other member of the family worthy of such a salute, and with a
  bright nod, which embraced them all, he walked briskly to the door and into
  the hall. Mr Narth thought he had gone, and was about to speak when the
  bearded man reappeared.</p>

  <p>"Anybody know a man called Grahame St Clay?" he asked.</p>

  <p>In a flash Mr Narth remembered the conversation of the morning.</p>

  <p>"I know a Mr St Clay. I don't exactly know him, but one of my directors is
  a friend of his," he said.</p>

  <p>Clifford Lynne's eyebrows rose.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" he said calmly. "You've never met him?"</p>

  <p>Mr Narth shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You might tell me tomorrow night what you think of him."</p>

  <p>"But I'm not seeing him," said Mr Narth.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, you are," said Clifford softly, and again that hint of mischief
  shone in his clear blue eyes. "Oh, indeed you are! St Clay! Who canonized
  Yellow mud?"</p>

  <p>In another second he had gone, slamming the front door behind him. He was
  a man of violent habits, as Mr Narth subsequently insisted.</p>

  <p>"Thank God, I'm not marrying him!" said Mabel, and Letty, hardly yet
  recovered from her swoon, murmured agreement.</p>

  <p>Joan said nothing. She was more than a little bewildered, very interested,
  but not in the slightest degree frightened.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06">CHAPTER SIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At the end of the drive, drawn up on the verge by the
  roadside, was Mr Clifford Lynne's car. 'Car' is perhaps a dignified
  description of a machine that he had purchased a few days previously for £35.
  He had left the engine running because it was his experience that failure to
  take this precaution might mean half an hour's work in starting. With a
  rattle and a clank, a groaning and a squeaking, he brought the machine to the
  road, drove noisily for a hundred yards, then turned along a wagon track that
  ran into the pines.</p>

  <p>The end of the path brought him to the grey stone Slaters' Cottage. Every
  window was broken; the pathetic little portico which a pretentious owner of
  the '60's had added sagged dismally in the centre; a dozen slates were
  missing from the roof&mdash;this one-storied cottage was a picture of
  desolation and neglect.</p>

  <p>A group of three men stood before the door, and his arrival had evidently
  interrupted a unanimous decision, which the first of the men voiced as
  Clifford sprang from the quivering machine.</p>

  <p>"You'll never be able to do anything with this place, sir," said the man,
  evidently, from the pocket-rule that protruded from his hip pocket, engaged
  in the building trade. "The floors are rotten, the house wants a new roof,
  and you'll need a new water and drainage system."</p>

  <p>Without a word Lynne strode past them into the building. It consisted of
  two rooms, one to the left and one to the right of the passageway he had
  entered. At the end of the hall was a tiny kitchen with a rusted stove, and
  from this led a scullery. Looking through the broken windows at the back, he
  could see a weatherworn shed which in point of repair was the superior of the
  cottage.</p>

  <p>The floorboards creaked and cracked under his weight. In one place they
  had rotted and a great hole appeared. The ancient paper hung in dismal,
  colourless shrouds from the walls, and the ceilings were almost
  indistinguishable under festoons of cobwebs.</p>

  <p>He rejoined the group before the door and filled his pipe deliberately
  from a long canvas sack which he hauled from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Are you a builder or a poet?" he asked the man with the foot-rule.</p>

  <p>The builder grinned.</p>

  <p>"I'm a pretty good builder," he said, "but I'm not a magician, and to get
  this house in order in a week you want three Aladdin's lamps."</p>

  <p>Clifford put his pipe in his mouth and lit it deliberately.</p>

  <p>"Cutting out the possibility of engaging the slave of the lamp, how many
  men would it require to carry out the repairs?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't a question of men, it's a question of money," said the builder.
  "I could certainly get everything done in a week, but it would cost you the
  greater part of a thousand pounds, and the cottage isn't worth that."</p>

  <p>Clifford sent a cloud of smoke into the air and watched it dissolve.</p>

  <p>"Put on a gang of two hundred men," he said; "work them in eight-hour
  shifts day and night. Have them started this evening tearing up the floors.
  Get all the trolleys you need, all the material you need, and have it
  specially delivered. I want oak floors, a bathroom, electric light laid on, a
  hot-water system, steel shutters to the windows, this wagon-track made into a
  good road, a swimming-pool behind the house, and that's about all, I
  think."</p>

  <p>"In seven days?" gasped the builder.</p>

  <p>"In six preferably," said Lynne. "You can either take it on or I'll find a
  man who will do it."</p>

  <p>"But, Mr Lynne, for the money it will cost you you could get one of the
  best houses in Sunningdale&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This is my ideal home," said Clifford Lynne, "and it's got to be
  snakeproof!"</p>

  <p>He looked round his little estate. The fence that marked the boundaries of
  the grounds was invisible behind the screen of the trees.</p>

  <p>"All these firs had better be cut down," he said. "I want a clear line of
  fire."</p>

  <p>"Line of what?" almost squeaked the builder.</p>

  <p>"And the steel shutters must have loopholes&mdash;I forgot to tell you
  that. Give me that book."</p>

  <p>He almost snatched the builder's notebook from his hand and began to
  sketch.</p>

  <p>"That shape, and those dimensions," he said, handing the book back. "Are
  you taking on this job?"</p>

  <p>"I'll take it on," said the builder. "I can promise you that the house
  will be fit for occupation in a week, but it's going to cost you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know what it will cost me if this house is not ready," interrupted
  Clifford Lynne.</p>

  <p>He put his hand in his pocket, took out a fat notebook and, opening it,
  extracted ten bills, each for a hundred pounds.</p>

  <p>"I'm not asking you for a contract, because I'm a business man." (He was
  given to that kind of paradox.) "This is Wednesday; the furniture will arrive
  on Tuesday next. Have fires lit in every room and keep them going. I may or
  may not see you for a week, but here is my telephone number. By the way, open
  a trench to the main road. I want a 'phone in here, and the wire must run
  underground&mdash;and deep at that. Snakes dig!"</p>

  <p>Without another word he stepped into the car and sent it bumping and
  swaying along the rough road, and presently was lost to view.</p>

  <p>"This is where I start not sleeping," said the builder, and he was very
  nearly right.</p>

  <p>It was raining the next morning, a gentle drizzle that looked like
  continuing for the whole of the day, according to Mr Narth's chauffeur, who
  took a melancholy interest in the vagaries of the English climate.</p>

  <p>It was Mr Stephen Narth's boast that he never noticed what the weather was
  like. But there was something in the gloomy skies and dismal landscapes that
  so accorded with his own mental condition that the weather obtruded itself
  upon him, and added something to his depression.</p>

  <p>And yet, he told himself a dozen times between Sunningdale and his office,
  there was no reason in the world why he should be depressed. It was true that
  the apparition that had dawned upon him was hardly conducive to cheer. But he
  had found a way of fulfilling the conditions of old Bray's will, and Joan's
  readiness to comply with his wishes was really a matter for
  congratulation.</p>

  <p>Clifford Lynne was an irritation and an eyesore. He was also the fly in
  the ointment. (The illustrations were Mr Narth's own.) Curiously enough, the
  advent of the poisonous snake in his drawing-room did not greatly perturb
  Stephen Narth. It was unusual, a little startling, but since he knew nothing
  of the deadly nature of yellow heads, and could not see anything particularly
  significant in the mysterious arrival of the box, he followed his practice of
  dismissing from his mind the problem he could not elucidate. It was all the
  easier because it was somebody else's problem.</p>

  <p>The incident, so far as he was concerned, had importance only because his
  drawing-room carpet had to be taken up and sent to the cleaners for
  repair&mdash;there were two neatly punctured holes which had to be filled.
  Clifford Lynne was theatrical. It was a favourite description of Mr Narth's
  invariably applied to all phenomena of life that produced an emotional
  reaction. When all was said and done&mdash;and this thought cheered him
  considerably&mdash;Joe Bray's fortune was within his grasp. The clouds that
  had obscured his horizon the day before were dissipated, and all that was
  necessary for him to do was to hurry on the wedding and secure the large
  fortune which was to be his as soon as the conditions were satisfied.</p>

  <p>He was almost happy as he went through the private door of his office, and
  could turn a genial face upon the two men who were awaiting him. Major
  Spedwell sprawled across one end of the table, a cigar clenched between his
  teeth, while Mr Leggat was standing by the window, his hands clasped behind
  him, staring out into the driving rain.</p>

  <p>"Hallo, you fellows!" said Narth jovially. "You look as cheerful as mutes
  at a funeral."</p>

  <p>Leggat turned round.</p>

  <p>"What are you happy about, anyway?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Stephen Narth had not made up his mind whether he should take his
  colleagues completely into his confidence. With the money that was coming
  from the Bray estate he could afford to drop his questionable acquaintances,
  and wipe out, as only money can wipe out, the delinquencies of his past,
  starting fresh with a clean slate and a fat and comfortable balance at the
  bank.</p>

  <p>"Joe Bray is dead," he blurted, "and he's left me the greater part of his
  money."</p>

  <p>In his exhilaration he was trapped into this incautious declaration, and
  cursed himself for his stupidity before the words were out of his mouth.</p>

  <p>If Stephen had expected the news to create a sensation, he was
  disappointed.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" said Leggat sarcastically. "And when does the money come
  into your hands?"</p>

  <p>"In a month or two," said the other airily.</p>

  <p>"A month or two is a month or two late," said Major Spedwell, his dark
  face creased in an unpleasant smile. "I've seen the auditors this morning,
  and it is imperative that the fifty thousand pounds should be found by
  tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"In fact," broke in Leggat, "we're up against it, Narth. We've got to
  raise that money in the next twenty-four hours. Of course, if there are no
  'ifs' and 'buts' about the legacy, you'd be able to borrow the money on the
  strength of it. Is there a contingency in the will?"</p>

  <p>Narth frowned at this; what did the man know? But the other met his eyes
  unflinchingly.</p>

  <p>"There is a contingency," admitted Narth, "but that has practically been
  overcome."</p>

  <p>Leggat shook his head.</p>

  <p>"'Practically' doesn't cut any ice," he said. "Is the will such that you
  could tomorrow borrow fifty thousand pounds upon it?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Narth shortly. "In point of fact, I don't know the value of the
  estate. And there is a contingency&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" said Spedwell. "That's the position, and it's a pretty bad
  position! You couldn't raise a fiver on a will with a contingency that had
  not been satisfied, and on an estate the exact value of which you do not
  know. I'll bet you haven't even a copy of the will."</p>

  <p>Stephen Narth's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"You're talking by the book, Major," he said. "Somebody has been telling
  you a great deal more than I know."</p>

  <p>Major Spedwell shifted uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"Somebody's told me nothing," he said loudly. "The only thing that
  interests Leggat and me is whether you can raise that fifty thousand pounds
  and, knowing that you can't, we've saved you a whole lot of trouble by asking
  our friend St Clay to come along and see you."</p>

  <p>"Your friend St Clay? The man you mentioned yesterday?"</p>

  <p>And then there flashed into the memory of Stephen Narth the recollection
  of Clifford Lynne's prophecy, "You are seeing him tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Grahame St Clay, eh? Has he got money to burn?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Spedwell nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's got money to burn, and he's willing to burn it; and if you take
  my tip, Narth, you will be the furnace!"</p>

  <p>"But I don't know him. Where do I meet him?"</p>

  <p>Spedwell walked to the door that led to the general office.</p>

  <p>"He's been waiting outside till we had a word with you."</p>

  <p>Stephen Narth looked at him in bewilderment. A man with fifty thousand
  pounds to lend, waiting for the opportunity of making the loan!</p>

  <p>"Here?" he said incredulously.</p>

  <p>Major Spedwell opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Meet Mr Grahame St Clay," he said, and there walked into the office an
  immaculately dressed gentleman.</p>

  <p>Even Narth stared at him open-mouthed, for Grahame St Clay was beyond all
  question a Chinaman!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07">CHAPTER SEVEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"This is Mr Grahame St Clay," Spedwell introduced the
  visitor again, and mechanically Stephen Narth put out his hand.</p>

  <p>Until that moment all Chinamen were alike to Stephen Narth, but somehow,
  as he looked into the brown eyes, he distinguished in this man a difference
  that he could not exactly define. The eyes were set wide apart; the nose,
  thin and long, and the thin lips, differed from those features he was used to
  associating with men of the Mongolian type. Perhaps it was the full chin
  which gave Grahame St Clay his distinction. Certainly when he spoke he was
  like no Chinaman that Stephen Narth had ever seen or heard.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr Narth? I am delighted to meet you. In fact, I have sought many
  opportunities of making your acquaintance."</p>

  <p>It was the voice of an educated man, with just that slight drawl and
  exaggerated pronunciation which is peculiar to one trained in a public school
  and finished at one of the great universities.</p>

  <p>"May I sit down?"</p>

  <p>Narth nodded mutely, and the newcomer laid a handsome portfolio on the
  table before him.</p>

  <p>"You are a little dazed to discover that I am a Chinaman?" Mr St Clay
  laughed softly. "'Yellow Peril' is the term which is usually employed, is it
  not? I would object to being called a peril, for I am the most unoffending
  man that ever came from China," he said good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he was opening the portfolio, and took out a flat-covered
  pad, tied with red ribbon. Very carefully he slipped the bow, took off the
  top layer of cardboard and revealed to the eyes of Stephen Narth a thick pad
  of banknotes. From where he stood he saw they were thousand-pound notes.</p>

  <p>"Fifty, I think, is the amount you require?" said Mr St Clay presently,
  and with the dexterity of a bank cashier he counted the requisite number,
  placed the little bundle on one side, carefully retied the pad, and slipped
  it back into the leather case. "We are all friends here, I think." Mr St Clay
  beamed from one of Stephen Narth's partners to the other. "I can speak
  without restraint?"</p>

  <p>Narth nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very well." He folded the fifty notes and, to the surprise of the senior
  partner, put the money into his waistcoat pocket. "There is naturally a
  condition attaching to this loan," he said. "Even I, poor, untutored Chinaman
  though I be, am not so utterly lost to the practice of commerce that I could
  loan this large sum of money unconditionally. Frankly, Mr Narth, it is
  required of you that you should become one of us.".</p>

  <p>"One of you?" said Stephen Narth slowly. "I don't quite get you."</p>

  <p>It was Spedwell who supplied the information.</p>

  <p>"Mr St Clay is running a big organization in this country. It's a sort
  of&mdash;" He paused awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"Secret society," suggested Mr St Clay pleasantly. "That sounds very
  mysterious and terrifying, does it not? But really there's nothing to it! I
  have a certain mission in life, and I require the help of intelligent men on
  whom I can rely. We Chinamen have rather the qualities of children. We love
  pomp and mystery. We are, in fact, the true exotics of the world. Mostly we
  like to play at things, and the Joyful Hands is frankly my invention. Our
  object is to uplift the Chinese people, to bring as it were light into dark
  places." He paused, and added: "And all that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>Stephen Narth smiled.</p>

  <p>"It seems quite a praiseworthy object," he said. "I shall be delighted to
  join you."</p>

  <p>The brown eyes had an hypnotic quality. They transfixed him in that
  second, and he had the terrifying sensation that he had momentarily
  surrendered his will to a dominating but beneficent power. That was the
  strange thing about the Chinaman: he created of himself an atmosphere of
  beneficence.</p>

  <p>"That is well," he said simply, took the wad of notes from his pocket and
  placed them gently on the table. "No, no, I do not require a
  receipt&mdash;between gentlemen that is unnecessary. You are not a graduate
  of Oxford? It is a pity. I prefer dealing with men who have that bond with
  me, but it is sufficient that you are a gentleman."</p>

  <p>He rose abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I think that is all," he said. "In three days you will hear from me, and
  I must ask you to hold yourself free to keep any appointment which may be
  made for you at any hour of the day or night in the course of the next week.
  I hope that is not too irksome a condition?"</p>

  <p>His eyes were smiling as he put the question.</p>

  <p>"No, indeed," said Stephen, and gathered up his money with a shaking hand
  (for the life of him he could not trace the cause of his agitation). "I must
  say, Mr St Clay, I'm very grateful to you. You have got me out of a very
  embarrassing situation. How embarrassing, you cannot know."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I know everything," said the other quietly.</p>

  <p>And then Stephen remembered.</p>

  <p>"Why did he call you the Yellow Snake?"</p>

  <p>The Chinaman was staring at him with round, unwinking eyes, and, thinking
  that he had not heard, Stephen repeated the question.</p>

  <p>"Mr Clifford Lynne called me that," said St Clay slowly.</p>

  <p>Only for a second did the inscrutable face of the man show that the shaft
  unconsciously directed had got home.</p>

  <p>"Yellow Snake... how vulgar! How like Clifford Lynne!"</p>

  <p>He recovered himself instantly, and with a deep laugh, both pleasant and
  musical, he gathered up his portfolio.</p>

  <p>"You will hear from me&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"One moment, Mr St Clay," said Narth. "You spoke about the object of your
  league. What is that object?"</p>

  <p>The native looked at him thoughtfully for a second, and then:</p>

  <p>"The dominion of the world," he said simply, and with a nod he turned and
  was gone.</p>

  <p>In this way came Grahame St Clay, Bachelor of Arts, into the life of
  Stephen Narth, and henceforth his fate was to be bound by hooks of steel to
  the will of one who was first to dominate and then to crush him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08">CHAPTER EIGHT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Joan Bray was an early riser from necessity. Her position in
  the Narth household had been reached by a series of drifts&mdash;mainly in
  the direction of the servants' hall. Mr Narth did not employ a housekeeper:
  it was an unnecessary expense in view of the fact that Joan was available;
  and gradually she had accumulated all the responsibilities of an upper
  servant, without any of the emoluments. She was, in fact, a liaison officer
  between the pantry and the parlour. It was she who had to arrange the monthly
  settlements with tradesmen, and confront the raging protests of a man who
  regarded household expenses as an unnecessary waste of money.</p>

  <p>So fully occupied was her day that she had formed the habit of rising at
  six and taking an hour in the open before the household was awake. The rain
  of the previous day had left the ground wet and the air cold, but it was such
  a morning as invited the feet of youth, for the sky was blue, save where it
  was flecked by a lacing of white cloud.</p>

  <p>This morning she had a special objective. The tremendous happening at
  Slaters' Cottage was the talk of Sunningdale. From her window on the previous
  evening she had seen the loaded trolleys disappearing into the wood, and the
  night had provided a strange and fascinating spectacle. She lived near enough
  to the Slaters' Cottage to hear the sound of hammer and pick, and she had
  seen the trees silhouetted against the blinding radiance of the naphtha
  lamps.</p>

  <p>Mr Narth had also been an uncomfortable witness of this extraordinary
  activity, and had made a journey late at night to the Slaters' Cottage, there
  to discover the extent of Clifford Lynne's folly. So far, Joan had learnt of
  these doings at third hand. The early morning offered an opportunity for a
  more intimate investigation, and she diverged from the road to satisfy her
  curiosity. She could not go far; a gang of men were tearing up the path.
  Three laden lorries were parked unevenly before the cottage, which was alive
  with men, and reminded her of a troubled ant-hill. The local builder, whom
  she knew, came up with a smile.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of this, Miss Joan&mdash;a thousand pounds worth of
  repair work on a hundred pound cottage!"</p>

  <p>She could only look and wonder. In the night, the roof had been stripped
  of slates and supporting beams, so that only the bare shell of the cottage
  remained.</p>

  <p>"We got the floors out and the pipes laid by four o'clock," said the
  builder proudly. "I've hired every labourer within twenty miles."</p>

  <p>"But why on earth is Mr Lynne doing all this?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You know him, Miss?" asked the man, in surprise, and she went red. It was
  impossible to explain that the Slaters' Cottage was to be her home (as she
  believed) and that his eccentric employer was her future husband.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know him," she said awkwardly. "He is&mdash;a friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"Oh!"</p>

  <p>Evidently this statement checked a certain frankness on the part of Mr
  Carter. Joan could almost guess what he would have said.</p>

  <p>She was smiling as she came back to the road. This freakish and feverish
  rebuilding of Slaters' Cottage was exactly the thing she would have expected
  from Clifford Lynne. Why she should, she did not know. Only it seemed as
  though he had been especially revealed to her; that she alone of the family
  understood him.</p>

  <p>She heard a clatter of hoofs behind her, and moved to the side of the
  road.</p>

  <p>"<i>Bon jour</i>&mdash;which I understand is French!"</p>

  <p>She turned, startled. It was the man who at that moment was in her
  thoughts. He was riding a shaggy old pony, sleepy-eyed, almost as dishevelled
  as himself.</p>

  <p>"What an awful trouble you must have had to find a horse that matched
  you!" she said. "I've seen your car&mdash;that was a perfect fit!"</p>

  <p>Clifford Lynne's eyes puckered as though he was laughing, but no sound
  came; yet she could have sworn he was shaking with laughter.</p>

  <p>"You're very rude," he said, as he slipped from the pony's back, "and
  offensive! But don't let us start quarrelling before we are married. And
  where did you see the car?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer this.</p>

  <p>"Why are you rebuilding this awful old cottage?" she asked. "Mr Carter
  said it will cost you thousands."</p>

  <p>He looked at her for a little while without speaking, fingering his
  beard.</p>

  <p>"I thought I would," he said absently. "I'm kind of eccentric. Living in a
  hot climate for so long may have affected my brain. I've known lots of
  fellows go like that! It's rather romantic, too," he mused. "I thought I'd
  get some climbing roses and honeysuckle, and perhaps run a cabbage patch and
  chickens&mdash;are you fond of chickens?" he asked innocently. "Black
  Dorkings or White Wyandottes, or vice versa? Or ducks perhaps?"</p>

  <p>They had reached the end of the road, the shaggy pony following
  obediently.</p>

  <p>"Old Mr Bray was rather set on your marrying one of our family, wasn't
  he?" she asked, so unexpectedly that for the moment he was taken aback.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," he said.</p>

  <p>"And you were awfully fond of Mr Bray?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think so. You see, we lived together for so long, and he was a
  likeable old devil. And he nursed me through cholera, and if it hadn't been
  for him I should have pegged out&mdash;which is Spanish for died. I certainly
  liked him."</p>

  <p>"You liked him so much," she challenged, "that when he asked you to come
  to England and marry one of his relations, you promised&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not immediately," he pleaded. "I made no promise for an awful long time.
  To tell you the truth, I thought he was mad."</p>

  <p>"But you did promise," she insisted. "And shall I tell you something else
  you promised?"</p>

  <p>He was silent.</p>

  <p>"You told poor Mr Bray you would say nothing that would make the girl
  reject you and spoil his plans!"</p>

  <p>Only for a moment was the bearded man embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"Clairvoyance was never a favourite science with me," he said. "It's too
  near witchcraft. I knew an old woman up in Kung-chang-fu who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't try to turn the subject, Mr Lynne. You promised Mr Bray that when
  his relations produced a girl of the family for you to marry, you would say
  nothing which would make her change her mind, that you would in fact express
  no unwillingness to marry."</p>

  <p>He fondled his invisible chin.</p>

  <p>"Well, maybe you're right," he confessed. "But I've said nothing," he
  added quickly. "Have I told you that I'm not a marrying man, and loathe the
  idea of matrimony? Have I told you how poor old Joe has blighted my young
  life? Have I gone on my knees and begged you to refuse me? Own up, Joan
  Bray!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head; the smile that was in her eyes was now twitching at
  her lips.</p>

  <p>"You've said nothing, but you've made yourself look a scarecrow."</p>

  <p>"And fearfully repulsive?" he asked hopefully.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not quite. I'm going to marry you; I suppose you know that?"</p>

  <p>The gloom in his face was such that she could have smacked him.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to marry you, of course," she said tartly, "but there
  are&mdash;there are reasons."</p>

  <p>"Old Narth has forced you into it," he said accusingly.</p>

  <p>"Just as old Mr Bray forced you into it," she replied at once. "It is a
  queer position, and it would be tragic if it wasn't laughable. I don't know
  what's going to happen, but there's one thing I wish you to do."</p>

  <p>"What is that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Go to a barber's and have that ridiculous beard shaved," she said. "I
  want to see what you look like."</p>

  <p>He sighed wearily.</p>

  <p>"In that case I'm booked," he said. "Once you see my face you will never,
  never give me up. I was the best-looking man in China."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations," he said simply, and she dissolved into laughter, and
  was still laughing when she came up the drive and met Mr Narth's suspicious
  frown.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09">CHAPTER NINE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"What is amusing you?" asked Stephen, who at the moment had
  good reason for being anything but amused.</p>

  <p>"I've just been talking to my&mdash;fiancé," she said, and Stephen's face
  cleared.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the wild man!" he said.</p>

  <p>He had a letter in his hand. The morning post came early at
  Sunningdale.</p>

  <p>"Joan, I want you to come to the City today&mdash;to lunch."</p>

  <p>This was a surprising invitation. As a rule when she went to the City she
  lunched alone.</p>

  <p>"A little bit of a lunch in the office," he said awkwardly. "And I want
  you to meet a friend of mine&mdash;er&mdash;a rather brilliant fellow, an
  Oxford graduate and all that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>His manner rather than his words puzzled her. He was so obviously ill at
  ease that she could only wonder at the cause of his embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Is Letty coming?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No, no," he said quickly. "Only you and I and my&mdash;um&mdash;friend. I
  suppose you've none of those stupid prejudices
  against&mdash;er&mdash;foreigners?"</p>

  <p>"Foreigners? Why, no&mdash;you mean he isn't European?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr Narth, and coughed. "He is Asiatic; in point of fact, he's
  a Chinaman. But he's an awfully important person in his own country, my dear,
  a mandarin or a governor or something, and a perfect gentleman. I wouldn't
  ask you to meet anybody I shouldn't care to meet myself."</p>

  <p>"Why, of course, Mr Narth, if you wish me to..."</p>

  <p>"His name is Grahame St Clay. He has large commercial interests both in
  this country and abroad."</p>

  <p>Grahame St Clay?</p>

  <p>Where she had heard that name before, she could not for the moment recall.
  She asked a question as to the hour and went into the house, wondering for
  what especial reason she had been chosen as Mr Narth's luncheon guest and why
  he was so anxious for her to meet his new acquaintance. She had never heard
  the name before until&mdash;</p>

  <p>Try as she did, she could not remember when it had been mentioned.</p>

  <p>Mr Narth, somewhat relieved, went back to the library and read the letter
  again. This was the first consequence of his loan, and already he was
  regretting a transaction which gave a Chinaman the right of addressing him as
  'My dear Narth.' There were only a dozen lines of neat writing:</p>

  <p>Since I met you today, I have heard that your niece, Miss Joan Bray has
  become engaged to Clifford Lynne, whom I know slightly. I should very much
  like to meet this young lady. Won't you either bring her to lunch at the
  Albemarle, or, if it is more convenient to you, to the City? Perhaps you
  would fix your own time and place. Please arrange this and telephone me as
  soon as you get to your office.</p>

  <p>The letter had been expressed and posted in London the night before, and
  the tone of assurance which St Clay had adopted was particularly irritating
  to a man of Narth's susceptibilities. To do full justice to his character, it
  may be said in truth that he had no very strong objection to Joan meeting the
  man. Where Joan was concerned he took a broad view. Had it been Letty or
  Mabel, he might have felt differently&mdash;but it was Joan.</p>

  <p>But, being strangely minded, he was by no means anxious to be seen in
  public lunching with an Oriental, and for that reason had decided that the
  meal should be in the boardroom, where he had given many little repasts to
  his business associates.</p>

  <p>When he reached his office that morning he found Major Spedwell waiting
  for him, and that military gentleman was less saturnine than usual.</p>

  <p>"I've just seen St Clay," he said. "Have you fixed that luncheon for him?
  He's rather keen on it."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Narth.</p>

  <p>Spedwell shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"God knows. He's a queer bird, St Clay. He's as generous as a prince
  &mdash;don't forget that, Narth. You'll find him a very useful man."</p>

  <p>"What is he in?" asked Narth.</p>

  <p>"Business, you mean? He's in all sorts of things. He's got a big factory
  at Peckham, but he has other means as well. You're in luck, Narth; he's taken
  a liking to you."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" grunted the other; he was by no means enthusiastic.</p>

  <p>Spedwell was looking at him with a queer, dry smile on his unprepossessing
  face.</p>

  <p>"You've led a quiet sort of life, haven't you, Narth? I mean the kind of
  life that the average City man has. You've never gone in for adventure or
  bloodshed, or things of that sort?"</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, no!" said Stephen Narth, staring at him. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"I only asked," said the other indifferently. "Only&mdash;you can't expect
  to be a gentle crook all the days of your life."</p>

  <p>"'Crook' isn't a word I like, Spedwell," said Stephen sharply.</p>

  <p>"I didn't suppose it was," said the other with cool indifference. "I'm
  merely pointing out the impossibility of getting away with&mdash;everything
  by sitting down in an easy chair and thinking out new ramps. There's no sense
  in getting up in the air about it, Narth. We're men of the world, and we
  understand that Narth Brothers has been a sham and a fraud for the past ten
  years. The gentle crook either drifts gently into a fortune or into
  jail&mdash;and you've made no fortune, and never will."</p>

  <p>Stephen Narth faced him squarely.</p>

  <p>"What's the idea of all this stuff?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>The Major was fingering his little moustache thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I'm only warning you, that's all," he said, "that there comes a point to
  every grafter when he's got to try something else, even if he only tries it
  once. Do you mind me speaking plainly?"</p>

  <p>"You're not exactly wrapping up your words now," said Narth sarcastically.
  "You've called me a grafter and a crook! If you've anything plainer, let's
  have it!"</p>

  <p>The Major pulled up a chair on the opposite side of the writing-table and
  sat down, folding his arms on the table.</p>

  <p>"St Clay's going to try you out," he said, "and if you play up to him
  there's a million in it!"</p>

  <p>Narth looked at him straightly.</p>

  <p>"A million pounds is an easy phrase, but a lot of money," he said.</p>

  <p>"More than a million," said Spedwell decisively. "This is the biggest
  thing you've ever been in, my friend."</p>

  <p>Narth was irritated. A million&mdash;even a nebulous million &mdash;was a
  terrific sum, but was he not the heir to Joe Bray's fortune?</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I'm so anxious," he said. "Joe Bray was not exactly a
  pauper."</p>

  <p>For a second a little smile played on the saturnine face of the other.</p>

  <p>"How much do you think you're going to get out of that estate?" he asked,
  and then, hastily: "Well, maybe you'll get a packet&mdash;but you'll make
  more out of St Clay if you play your cards right."</p>

  <p>He left Stephen Narth a little uneasy, more than a little bewildered. For
  the first time since he had received the news of Joe Bray he began to wonder
  whether he was justified in his jubilation. Yet Joe had been a rich man, the
  owner of important concessions, a financier of governments, if all that the
  City said was true&mdash;the old fellow must have been enormously rich. It
  was a pleasant thought.</p>

  <p>At a quarter to one Grahame St Clay arrived, a perfectly groomed man about
  town in his grey morning suit and shining silk hat. Narth had time now to
  take a closer observation of him. He was just a little overdressed, the
  diamond pin in his cravat just a little too large. He affected a heavy
  perfume, and when he took out his silk handkerchief the office became
  unbearable to a man who was used to a more wholesome atmosphere.</p>

  <p>"You got my letter?" It was the tone of an employer speaking to a
  servant.</p>

  <p>Mr Narth writhed. There was something patently offensive in the man's
  attitude. He glanced at the desk where Narth was sitting, coolly read the
  letter that he had been writing, and without invitation pulled up a chair and
  sat down.</p>

  <p>"That girl is coming, is she?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Bray is lunching with us, yes," said Narth, a little stiffly, and
  something in his voice must have warned St Clay, for he laughed.</p>

  <p>"My dear man, you are suspicious of me! Come, come, this will never do! So
  early in our acquaintance too! You see, Narth, in my own country I am quite
  an important person, and I have acquired the habits of the overlord! You must
  make allowances."</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. Perkins, the clerk, came in and looked
  mutely at Stephen.</p>

  <p>"Who is it&mdash;Miss Bray?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Perkins. "Shall I tell her to wait&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>"Ask her to come in."</p>

  <p>For the first time in his life it struck Stephen Narth that Joan was a
  very pretty girl. Certainly she had never looked quite so lovely as she did
  that morning, a slim figure in a blue tailor-made suit and a little red hat
  that seemed as if it must have been specially designed to emphasize the milk
  and rose of her complexion and give to her blue eyes a new depth.</p>

  <p>The effect she produced on the Chinaman was remarkable. He stood with his
  lips apart, staring at her until he saw the red come to her face. Then:</p>

  <p>"This is Mr St Clay," said Narth.</p>

  <p>Her hand was out to take the big paw extended, when the door leading to
  the office was flung open and a young man came in. He was a very well-dressed
  young man; that was the first impression Joan Bray had of the
  newcomer&mdash;a peculiarly feminine instinct that Sackville Street had made
  his clothes. He was young, but he was not a boy; there was a touch of grey at
  his temples, tiny lines about his eyes. In the folds of a toga he would have
  been a tribune of old Rome, with his handsome eagle face and his imperious
  mien.</p>

  <p>He stood in the doorway looking from St Clay to Narth&mdash;not once did
  he look at the girl. For a moment Narth was dumbfounded at this unexpected
  irruption upon his privacy.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked. "You've made a mistake, haven't you? This is
  a private office&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No mistake at all," said the stranger, and, hearing his voice, the girl
  turned and looked at him in amazement. "All the mistakes are on your side,
  Narth, and you never made a bigger mistake than when you had the audacity to
  ask my future wife to sit at the same table as this damned murdering Chink!
  Fing-Su!"</p>

  <p>Mr St Clay, BA, covered his hands mechanically.</p>

  <p>"Excellency!" he said in the Mandarin tongue.</p>

  <p>Joan uttered a gasp of amazement. The best-looking man in China had not
  exaggerated his attraction&mdash;for the stranger in the doorway was Clifford
  Lynne!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER TEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Fing-Su's embarrassment was only of the shortest duration.
  The folded arms came apart, the shrinking figure gained a new and sudden
  poise, and Grahame St Clay was his European self again. Into the dark eyes
  came a malignant fire which made him of a sudden a figure of terror. Only for
  the fraction of a second did the beast in him raise his head. The light died;
  he was his old pedantic self.</p>

  <p>"This intrusion is perfectly unwarrantable," he said in a queer, staccato
  tone which in any other circumstances would have been ludicrous.</p>

  <p>Clifford Lynne's eyes were on the white table with its silver, glass and
  flowers, and then they slowly strayed to the girl, and he smiled. And this
  strange man had the most beautiful smile the girl had ever seen.</p>

  <p>"If you can endure me through a meal," he said, "I should like to be your
  host."</p>

  <p>Joan nodded.</p>

  <p>She was frightened in a breathless, pleasant way, but immensely
  interested. She would not have been human had she been otherwise. These two
  men were enemies, bitter and remorseless, and now she understood, as clearly
  as though the story had been told to her, the significance of the snake which
  had wriggled from the box in the drawing-room at Sunningdale. St Clay had
  sent it. This suave Chinaman whom Clifford Lynne had called Fing-Su! And as
  this realization came to her, she turned pale, and moved unconsciously nearer
  to the intruder.</p>

  <p>"Mr Narth!"</p>

  <p>Fing-Su was speaking with difficulty. The rage in him was boiling up
  through the veneer which the university had given him, and his voice was
  tremulous, almost tearful.</p>

  <p>"You have invited me&mdash;to lunch with this lady. You are not to allow
  this&mdash;" Here he choked.</p>

  <p>Stephen Narth felt it was a moment when he might at least attempt to
  assert his personality.</p>

  <p>"Joan, you will stay here," he commanded.</p>

  <p>That was easy enough to say. What tone he must adopt to the man in the
  doorway was another and more difficult matter. If the odd-looking apparition
  of Sunningdale had been difficult to deal with, this cool and debonair
  man-about-town was much more of a problem.</p>

  <p>"Um&mdash;Mr Lynne&mdash;" he began, mildly enough. "This is extremely
  awkward. I have asked Joan to lunch with our friend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your friend," said Lynne quickly, "not mine! It might occur to you,
  Narth, that I should wish to be consulted before you issue invitations to my
  future wife, and ask her to lunch with a man who regards assassination as a
  remedy for most difficulties that come his way!"</p>

  <p>He beckoned Joan to him with a slight jerk of his head, and meekly she
  went to him. Mr Narth had not even the courage to be angry.</p>

  <p>Lynne stood aside for a moment to let the girl pass into the outer office,
  then he turned.</p>

  <p>"Three of you people are playing with fire, and one of you is playing with
  hell," he said slowly. "Spedwell, you were once an officer in the British
  Army, and presumably you have the atrophied qualities of a gentleman
  somewhere in your composition. I am not going to appeal to that tattered
  remnant, but to your sense of self-preservation. There's a gallows ahead of
  you, my man&mdash;fifty seconds' walk from the condemned cell to eternal
  damnation!"</p>

  <p>He ignored Narth, but his long finger stretched out, pointing to the
  Chinaman.</p>

  <p>"Fing-Su," he said, "for the third time I warn you! The Joyous Hands will
  need a new chief, and that fine factory of yours will go up in smoke, and you
  with it!"</p>

  <p>Turning, he walked out and slammed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>The girl was waiting in the corridor outside the office. She was
  bewildered, excited, and running through the web of her emotions was a thread
  of faith in this strange man who had come so unexpectedly and so violently
  into her life. She turned as he closed the door and responded to his
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Let's go to the Ritz," he said brusquely. "I am a very hungry man; I've
  been up since four."</p>

  <p>He said no word as they went down in the lift to the ground floor, and not
  until the taxi he called was threading its way through the tangle of traffic
  at the Mansion House did she speak.</p>

  <p>"Who is Fing-Su?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He started as though she had aroused him from a reverie.</p>

  <p>"Fing-Su?" he said carelessly. "Oh, he's just a Chink; the son of an old
  Chinese go-getter who wasn't a bad fellow. The old man was
  missionary-educated, and that, of course, spoilt him. No, I'm not knocking
  missionaries; they cannot perform miracles. It takes nine generations to make
  a black man think white, but ten thousand years couldn't change a Chinaman's
  mentality!"</p>

  <p>"He talks like an educated man," she said wonderingly.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"He's a Bachelor of Arts of Oxford. Old Joe Bray sent him there." He
  smiled at her gasp of astonishment. "Joe did some queer, good-hearted, silly
  things," he said, "and sending Fing-Su to Oxford was one of them."</p>

  <p>She could never remember exactly what happened at luncheon. She had a dim
  recollection that he talked most of the time, and only towards the end of the
  meal had she an opportunity of expressing her fears as to Mr Narth's
  attitude.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about him. He's got his troubles, and they're pretty bad
  ones," he said grimly.</p>

  <p>But there was one matter upon which she must speak. He had ordered a car
  to be waiting, and insisted upon seeing her home to Sunningdale, and this
  gave her her opportunity.</p>

  <p>"Mr Lynne&mdash;" She hesitated. "This absurd marriage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No more absurd than other marriages," he said coolly, "and really not so
  absurd as it seemed when my whiskers were in full bloom. Do you want to get
  out of it?"</p>

  <p>Joan was pardonably annoyed at the hopefulness in his tone.</p>

  <p>"Of course I don't want to get out of it!" she said. "I've promised."</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The colour came to her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Why did you agree so readily? That rattles me rather," he said. "You're
  not the kind of girl to take the first man who came along. You're quite
  different from the stout and sentimental Mabel and the highly-strung Letty.
  What pull has Narth?"</p>

  <p>The question silenced her.</p>

  <p>"He has a pull, hasn't he? He said to you: 'You've got to marry this queer
  bird or else I'll'&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, but he was insistent, and his keen grey eyes searched
  her face.</p>

  <p>"I was ready to marry anything when I came along. But I didn't
  expect&mdash;you!"</p>

  <p>"Why were you ready to accept anything?" she challenged, and a faint smile
  showed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"That's fair," he admitted; "and now I'll tell you. I loved old Joe; he
  saved my life twice. He was the dearest, most fantastical old romance-hound
  that ever lived, and was mad keen that I should marry one of his family. I
  didn't know this until he told me he was dying&mdash;I didn't believe him,
  but that crazy Dutch doctor from Canton confirmed the diagnosis. Joe said
  that he'd die happy if I'd carry on the line, as he called it, though God
  knows he has no particular representative of the line worth carrying
  on&mdash;with the exception of you," he added hastily.</p>

  <p>"And you promised?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"And I wasn't drunk when I promised! I've a horrible feeling that I'm
  sentimental too. He died in Canton&mdash;that's where the cable came from.
  How like Joe to die in Canton!" he said bitterly. "He couldn't even die
  normally on the Siang-kiang!"</p>

  <p>She was shocked by his callousness.</p>

  <p>"Then what do you expect me to do, now that I know you are only marrying
  me to keep a promise?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You can't take advantage of my frankness and sneak out," he said a little
  gruffly. "I saw old Joe's will after I'd arrived in England, when it was too
  late to alter it. Your marriage before the end of the year makes a million
  pounds' difference to Narth."</p>

  <p>"As much as that?" she asked, in amazement.</p>

  <p>For some reason he was astonished.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were going to say 'Is that all?' It is really worth more
  than a million&mdash;or will be in time. The company is enormously rich."</p>

  <p>There followed a period when both were too immersed in their own thoughts
  to speak, and then:</p>

  <p>"You managed&mdash;things for him, didn't you, Mr Lynne?"</p>

  <p>"My best friends call me Cliff," he said, "but if you find that
  embarrassing you may call me Clifford. Yes, I managed things."</p>

  <p>He offered no further information, and the silence thereafter grew so
  oppressive that she was glad when the car stopped before the door of Sunni
  Lodge. Letty, who was on the lawn playing croquet, came across, mallet in
  hand, with uplifted eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were lunching in town, Joan?" she asked disapprovingly.
  "Really, it's awfully awkward. We've got the Vaseys coming this afternoon,
  and I know you don't like them."</p>

  <p>And then she saw for the first time the good-looking stranger and lowered
  her eyes and faltered, for Letty's modesty and confusion in the presence of
  Man were notoriously part of her charm.</p>

  <p>Joan made no attempt to introduce her companion. She said goodbye to her
  escort and watched the car glide down the drive.</p>

  <p>"Really, Joan," said Letty petulantly, "you've got the manners of a pig!
  Why on earth didn't you introduce him?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't think you wanted an introduction; you've been so awfully
  unpleasant about him since he was here last," said Joan, not without a little
  malice.</p>

  <p>"But he's never been here before!" protested the girl. "And it's perfectly
  horrible of you to say that I've said anything unpleasant about anybody. Who
  is he?"</p>

  <p>"Clifford Lynne," said Joan, and added: "My fiancé!"</p>

  <p>She left Letty open-mouthed and dumbfounded, and went up to her room. The
  rest of the afternoon she spent in some apprehension as to what Mr Narth
  would say on his return. When eventually he did come&mdash;it was just before
  dinner&mdash;he was surprisingly affable, even paternal, but she detected in
  his manner a nervousness that she had never noticed before, and wondered
  whether the cause was Clifford Lynne or the sinister Chinaman of whom she had
  such bad dreams that night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER ELEVEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr Clifford Lynne had rented a small furnished house in one
  of those streets in Mayfair which had the advantage, from his point of view,
  of a back entrance. There was a small garage behind the house, which opened
  on to a long and very tidy mews made up of other garages, each capped by a
  tiny flat, wherein the chauffeurs attached to his respectable neighbours had
  their dwelling.</p>

  <p>Something was puzzling Clifford Lynne&mdash;and it was not Fing-Su, or
  Joan or Mr Narth. A doubt in his mind had blossomed into a suspicion, and was
  in a fair way to being a conviction.</p>

  <p>All that afternoon he spent reading the China newspapers which had arrived
  by the mail that day. Just before seven o'clock he saw a paragraph in the
  <i>North China Herald</i> which brought him to his feet with an oath. It was
  too late to make inquiries, for, simultaneous with his discovery, the visitor
  was announced.</p>

  <p>Mr Ferdinand Leggat, that amiable and affable man, had arrived via the
  garage in a closed cab, and had been admitted by Lynne's chauffeur through
  the back door; there was excellent reason for this secrecy.</p>

  <p>As he entered the little dining-room he half turned as though to shut the
  door behind him, but the butler who followed made this unnecessary. On Mr
  Leggat's face there was something that was not exactly fear, and yet might
  not be diagnosed as comfort. He was unhappy.</p>

  <p>"I wish you could have made it a little later, Mr Lynne," he said, as his
  host motioned him to a seat.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing as innocent as daylight," said Clifford quietly.
  "Besides, nobody suspects a taxi. You hailed it, I suppose, in the orthodox
  way? You mumbled a few instructions to the driver and he brought you here. If
  it had been a long, grey limousine that had picked you up in some dark
  street, you might have been under suspicion."</p>

  <p>"These cabmen talk," said the other, fiddling with his knife and fork.</p>

  <p>"Not this cabman; he is my own chauffeur, whom I have had for eight years.
  You'll find all you want to eat and drink on the sideboard&mdash;help
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"Isn't your servant coming in?" asked the other nervously.</p>

  <p>"If he was, I shouldn't ask you to help yourself," said Clifford. "I want
  a little talk with you before you go&mdash;that is why I asked you to come so
  early. What happened today?"</p>

  <p>He went to the buffet, helped himself to a small piece of chicken and
  salad, and brought it back to the table.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>Mr Leggat had evidently no appetite, for he carried back to the table a
  whisky bottle and a large siphon.</p>

  <p>"St Clay is furious. You want to be careful of that fellow, Lynne; he's a
  dangerous man."</p>

  <p>Clifford Lynne smiled.</p>

  <p>"Have I brought you all the way from your South Kensington home to learn
  that?" he said sardonically. "Of course he's dangerous! What happened?"'</p>

  <p>"I don't exactly know. I saw Spedwell for a few minutes, and he told me
  that St Clay&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Call him Fing-Su&mdash;that St Clay stuff gives me a headache."</p>

  <p>"He said that Fing-Su raised hell at first, and then insisted that Narth
  should treat the matter as a joke. If I were you, I'd watch that girl of
  yours."</p>

  <p>Clifford raised his eyes to the other.</p>

  <p>"You mean Miss Bray&mdash;I'd rather you said 'Miss Bray.' 'That girl of
  yours' sounds just a little disrespectful," he said coldly. "Do you
  mind?"</p>

  <p>Leggat forced a smile.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you were so darned particular," he grunted.</p>

  <p>"I am&mdash;a little," said the other. "Yes, Fing-Su is dangerous; I've no
  doubt about that. I wonder if you realize how deadly he is?"</p>

  <p>"I?" asked Leggat, in surprise. "Why?"</p>

  <p>The other looked at him strangely.</p>

  <p>"I gather that you have joined his precious Joyful Hands and that you've
  taken some sort of mumbo-jumbo oath?"</p>

  <p>Leggat moved uneasily in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that! Well, I don't take much notice of that sort of thing," he said
  awkwardly. "Secret societies are all very well in their way, but they're a
  game&mdash;playing at mystery and all that sort of thing. Besides, Fing-Su
  has a fine business in London; he wouldn't try any monkey tricks. Why, he
  told me that in a year's time he will have almost the whole of the South
  China trade in his hands, and they say he has trading stations up as far as
  the Tibetan frontier! The man must be making thousands a year profit! That
  secret society of his is a trading dodge. Spedwell told me that there are
  lodges in almost every big town in China. Naturally that's good for business.
  He has made himself a small god amongst the natives. Look at the offices he
  is building at Tower Hill, and the factory out at Peckham."</p>

  <p>"The factory at Peckham I intend looking at tonight," said Lynne, and the
  man's face fell.</p>

  <p>"What's the sense of that?" he asked. "The place is swarming with Chinks.
  He's got over two hundred and fifty working there. The Peckham people made a
  fuss about it when there were only fifty. That's why he lodges them inside
  the factory. You couldn't get into the works for love or money."</p>

  <p>Clifford Lynne smiled.</p>

  <p>"I shall try neither," he said. "All I want from you is the pass-key to
  the lodge gates."</p>

  <p>The big man went deathly white, and the hand that went to his lips
  trembled.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that?" he asked in a hoarse whisper. "Good God, man, you
  wouldn't go&mdash;I couldn't take you&mdash;isn't there another way? Couldn't
  you tell the police or the Foreign Office?"</p>

  <p>"The police and the Foreign Office would give me the merry ha-ha," said
  Lynne. "I want to see for myself just what is happening inside the boundary
  wall of those three acres. I want to see just what Mr Grahame St Clay is
  doing with his warehouses and his ships and motor-barges; but mostly, I am
  anxious to see the Hall of the White Goat."</p>

  <p>Leggat was trembling like a jelly. He opened his mouth to speak but no
  words came. At last:</p>

  <p>"There's death there!" he blurted, and the steely eyes met his.</p>

  <p>"For you, perhaps&mdash;but not for me!" said Clifford Lynne.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">CHAPTER TWELVE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The activities of the Chinese Trading Federation would have
  excited no unusual interest had it not been for the labour trouble
  originating in the employment of yellow stevedores. It was known to be a
  company financed by wealthy Chinese, and it was not thought remarkable that
  the promoters of this trading concern should prefer to employ men of their
  own race; and when the labour difficulty was adjusted and the workers
  employed by the Federation were accepted as trade unionists, the mutterings
  against 'Chinese labour' died down, to be revived by the protests of the
  local inhabitants when a particularly unpleasant outrage was committed in the
  vicinity of the factory. It was the only one of its kind, happily, for the
  Federation had taken the drastic step of providing lodgings for its workmen
  within the factory itself. There was accommodation enough, since the grounds
  held many buildings of solid concrete. It had been one of the innumerable war
  factories that had sprung up during the war and which the Armistice had left
  tenantless, and the Federation had acquired the premises for a fraction of
  their cost.</p>

  <p>The factory stood on the banks of the sluggish Surrey Canal, and had its
  own small dock and quay, where interminable strings of barges were unloaded
  and re-loaded from week to week. Only the barges were manned by white labour;
  the ships that carried the merchandise of the Federation to the African shore
  were both officered and manned by Chinamen.</p>

  <p>The so-called Yellow Fleet consisted of four ships, purchased at the very
  ebb tide of shipping prosperity. The Federation obviously did a very good
  trade in rice, silk and the thousand and one products of the East. These were
  usually discharged at the Pool of London itself, and disposed of in the
  ordinary markets, the vessels reloading from lighters which came out from the
  Surrey Canal, bearing those exports for which the Federation found the
  readiest sale.</p>

  <p>Rain was falling when Clifford Lynne's taxicab turned out of the Old Kent
  Road and passed swiftly towards Peckham. Short of the deserted Canal Bridge,
  the taxi stopped and Lynne descended. He gave a few words of instruction in a
  low voice to the driver, and went down to the canal bank. Save for the
  hooting of a distant steamer on its way down river, no sound broke the
  silence as he walked swiftly along the narrow bank by the waterside. Once he
  passed a barge moored to the bank, and heard the muffled voices of the
  bargeman and his wife in altercation.</p>

  <p>After ten minutes' walk he slackened his pace. Ahead of him to the left
  were the dark buildings of the Federation factory. He passed the main gates;
  the little wicket door was open, and squatting before it was a gigantic
  coolie, as he saw in the glow of the cigar the man was smoking. The custodian
  bade him a guttural "Goodnight," and he answered the salute.</p>

  <p>The canal twisted in its course a little beyond the gate, and in a few
  seconds he was out of sight of the gatekeeper. Presently the wall turned at
  right angles, and he followed a narrow, unlighted passage-way which ran by
  its side. The rain had developed into a steady downpour and pattered upon the
  mackintosh dismally. From his pocket he had taken a small electric torch, and
  this helped him to avoid the succession of deep muddy holes which occurred at
  intervals in the unsavoury pathway, which was evidently not used to any
  extent.</p>

  <p>Presently he found what he was looking for&mdash;a small door, deeply
  recessed into the wall. He stood for a few minutes listening, then, inserting
  the key, turned it, opened the door gently and passed in.</p>

  <p>So far as he could see, to his left was the square outline of the main
  factory against the sky; to his right a squat concrete shed, so low that the
  roof was on a level with his eyes. During the war this place had been used as
  a bomb-filling factory, and evidently the shed had been the explosives
  store.</p>

  <p>He felt his way forward gingerly, avoiding the use of light. From
  somewhere in the dark grounds came deep crooning chorus of song. The men's
  quarters, he thought, as he located the sound.</p>

  <p>A fairly broad flight of stone steps led down to the door of the shed,
  which was below the level of the ground. Again he stopped and listened, put
  in his key and gently turned it in the lock. Flashing his lamp inside for a
  second, he saw the second flight of steps that led deeper into the earth.
  Here were two doors, but, unlike any other he had passed, these were gaily
  ornamented with finely carved figures, each painted in bright and vivid
  colours. Even if he had not been an expert in such matters, he would have
  recognized the art of China.</p>

  <p>It took him some time to find the keyhole, but at last one of the doors
  was opened. As it swung open, there came to his nostrils the heavy odor of
  incense, and a faint, acrid smell that he knew all too well. Despite his
  courage, his heart beat a little faster.</p>

  <p>Closing the door carefully behind him, he sent the light of his torch
  along the wall, and after a second or two it rested upon a small switchboard.
  Without hesitation he pulled down a switch. Instantly two great glittering
  electroliers that were supported on columns of solid bronze gleamed into
  light.</p>

  <p>The room was low-roofed, long and narrow; the concrete walls, which had
  served when this chamber had been the repository of high explosives, were
  entirely covered with long panels of scarlet silk on which were embroidered
  texts from the words of The Sage, and these hangings alternated with
  half-pillars that seemed to be of hammered gold. The stone floor had been
  overlaid with brightly coloured tiles, and round three sides of the room ran
  a broad strip of dark-blue carpet. But this he did not see for the moment.
  His attention was concentrated upon the long marble altar at the far end of
  the room. Behind this, on a stone pedestal, was the singular emblem of the
  secret society&mdash;two golden hands clasped together in friendship. They
  crossed a red lacquered post which was covered with inscriptions in gold.</p>

  <p>He stood reading these for a while. These writings were also of admirable
  intent&mdash;exhortations to virtue and filial piety predominated. Beneath
  the hands was a golden chair on a small scarlet-covered dais. And then he
  saw, on the altar-top, as he came nearer, a flicker of light that shot out
  from the edge of the alter, and with a gasp he saw that its rim was set with
  diamonds!</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll go to blazes!" he said in astonishment, and reached out his
  hand to touch the dazzling gems.</p>

  <p>At that moment all the lights in the room went out, and he spun round,
  jerking a revolver from his hip pocket as he turned.</p>

  <p>"Shah!" grunted a deep voice, and something whizzed past his cheek.</p>

  <p>He heard the clang of the knife as it struck the wall, and dropped flat on
  the ground. Again a knife whizzed past, and then he fired twice towards the
  door. He heard a sob of pain and then, instantly, the sound ceased as though
  powerful hands had closed the sufferer's mouth.</p>

  <p>The silence was complete. Not by so much as the shuffle of bare feet did
  his attackers betray their presence.</p>

  <p>Clifford rolled over and sat up. In a trice he had pulled off his shoes
  and, knotting the laces together, slung them about his neck, an old schoolboy
  trick that recalled paddling in a forbidden pond. Rising noiselessly, he felt
  his way along the carpet, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.</p>

  <p>'Click!'</p>

  <p>It was the touch of steel against the tessellated floor&mdash;they were
  searching for him with their swords. How many?</p>

  <p>Less than a dozen, he guessed, by the fact that they had not turned on the
  lights. A bigger force would have risked his revolver. After a while, the
  chair line turned to the left. He was moving now to the door and there was
  greater need for caution.</p>

  <p>He stopped and listened. Somebody was breathing deeply just in front of
  him: the guard on the door. There came to him an inspiration. The Chinaman
  has a peculiar whisper&mdash;a low hiss of sound no louder than the sighing
  of a night wind.</p>

  <p>"Go to the Hands&mdash;all of you!" he breathed. He spoke in the dialect
  of Yun Nan, and he was rewarded. The breathing ceased and he moved stealthily
  toward the door, stopping at every other step to listen.</p>

  <p>The carpet line ended abruptly: his fingers touched the silken curtains
  and then bare wall. In another instant he had passed through the open door
  and was mounting the stairs. Above him, clearly outlined against the night
  sky, he saw a figure standing at the outer entrance, bent as in a listening
  attitude.</p>

  <p>Clifford stopped to draw breath, and then with two strides he was up the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>"Move and you die!" he hissed, and pushed the muzzle of his gun into the
  padded coat.</p>

  <p>The man flinched back, but recovered himself instantly. Clifford heard the
  laugh and knew it.</p>

  <p>"Do not shoot, Mr Lynne! <i>Sic itur ad astra</i>! But I prefer another
  road to immortality!"</p>

  <p>In the light of his torch Clifford saw the sentinel. He wore a long coat
  that fell almost to his heels, and on his head was the round cap of his
  kind.</p>

  <p>It was Grahame St Clay, BA!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Clifford Heard the patter of bare feet on the stairs and
  whipped round, his pistol raised.</p>

  <p>"Call off your dogs, Fing-Su!" he said.</p>

  <p>The other hesitated for a second, and then hissed something in a fierce
  undertone. The rustling ceased but, looking down into the opening, Clifford
  Lynne saw the dull gleam of a naked sword and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Now, friend," he said, and gripping the arm of Fing-Su, he led him
  towards the door in the wall.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr Lynne"&mdash;the Chinaman's voice was reproachful &mdash;"if
  you wish to see our little lodge room, why on earth didn't you write me a
  note? I should have been glad to have shown you round the premises. As it
  was, these poor fellows naturally imagined that a burglar had broken
  in&mdash;there is quite a lot of valuable property in the Hall of the Hands,
  as you may have observed. Really, I should never have forgiven myself if
  anything had happened to you."</p>

  <p>The white man did not reply; all his senses were alert; his eyes roamed
  from left to right, for he knew that these grounds were full of armed men.
  Once let Fing-Su get away from him, and his life would be worth very
  little.</p>

  <p>Apparently Fing-Su was thinking along the same lines.</p>

  <p>"I never realized you were a nervous man before, Lynne," he said.</p>

  <p>"Mr Lynne," said the other significantly, and his prisoner swallowed
  something in the darkness.</p>

  <p>As they were walking towards the door in the wall, Clifford had taken out
  his flashlamp. The ground sloped gently towards the exit, and now for the
  first time he pushed the button controlling the light, with no other thought
  than to guide himself. The rays focused the door for a second, then wandered
  to the right. Here, built against the wall, was a long roof, about six feet
  from the ground, and in that second he saw what he thought, at first, was a
  line of wagons, in the shelter of the slate-covered shed that apparently ran
  the length of the wall. Just a glimpse he had of that vista of dark grey
  wheels, and then the lamp was struck from his hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said Fing-Su apologetically. "Please don't be alarmed; it was
  quite an accident."</p>

  <p>He stooped and picked up the lamp.</p>

  <p>"I would rather you didn't show a light here," he said. "In fact, I don't
  want my people to know that an intruder has witnessed the Hall of Mystery.
  They are, as you know, Mr Lynne, an excitable, foreigner-hating folk, and,
  what is more to the point, I am anxious to get you away from this place
  without injury, and your light gives them, shall I say, a target?"</p>

  <p>To this Clifford Lynne did not reply.</p>

  <p>They had reached the gate. Fing-Su stepped ahead, unlocked and threw it
  wide open, and Lynne stepped out backwards, his pistol arm stiff.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you a word of warning," he said; "it may be useful to you.
  You've got more money than a Chinaman should have. Go back to your country;
  use your wealth to cultivate the land, and get that Emperor bug out of your
  mind."</p>

  <p>He heard a quiet, confident laugh, and knew that his seed had fallen upon
  a very stony place indeed. As the gate closed softly on him, and the key was
  turned, he walked swiftly towards the canal bank, throwing his light ahead.
  The bank was deserted, and he turned back the way he had come, alert,
  expectant, never doubting that, if it suited Mr 'Grahame St Clay's' purpose,
  he would have to fight his way to safety. He was still in his stockinged
  feet, and as he paused a dozen yards from the big gate of the factory, he
  heard the faint squeak of a hinge. The gate was opening.</p>

  <p>He knelt down and looked back along the bank, and saw a procession of
  stealthy figures moving out from the passageway. That he was in deadly peril
  he did not doubt. Without the slightest hesitation he slipped his pistol back
  into his pocket and, sitting on the timbered edge of the canal, he dropped
  into the water. Very silently, making no splash, he struck out for the
  opposite bank and for a barge that was moored by the side of a wharf. The
  water was foul and greasy, but that was a minor discomfort compared with what
  awaited him if he fell into the hands of the Federation.</p>

  <p>Presently he reached and caught hold of a chain, and in silence drew
  himself to the grimy deck of a coal barge. A few steps brought him to the
  wharf. A dog growled savagely somewhere in the darkness; from the opposite
  bank he heard a twitter of excited comment. They had missed him, and had
  guessed which way he had gone.</p>

  <p>Picking his way across the littered wharf, he came at last to a high
  wooden gate, surmounted by a rusty spike, as he discovered when he tried to
  climb. Searching the gateway, he found the wicket, turned the handle, and, to
  his relief, the door yielded.</p>

  <p>The danger was not yet past, he realized, as he ran through a labyrinth of
  narrow lanes and reached an untidy road, dimly lighted by street lamps. As he
  reached the road he saw the dim light of a car at the far end, and dropped
  behind a timber baulk. The machine was moving slowly, and somebody by the
  side of the driver was sending the rays of a powerful hand-lamp left and
  right. He heard the sibilant whisper that he knew so well and waited, his
  dripping pistol in his hand; but the car passed and, rising cautiously, he
  ran back the way he had come, reached the Canal Bridge without mishap and,
  most welcome sight of all, two policemen walking together. One flashed his
  lamp upon him as he passed.</p>

  <p>"Hallo, guv'nor, been in the water?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I fell in," said Clifford, and did not stop to offer any further
  explanation.</p>

  <p>At the end of the Glengall Road he found his taxi waiting, and half an
  hour later he was enjoying the luxury of a hot bath.</p>

  <p>He had much to think about that night, principally about that long line of
  wheeled vehicles he had seen in the shelter of the shed; for he had
  recognized them as battery upon battery of quick-firing guns, and he wondered
  what plans Mr Fing-Su had for their employment.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr Stephen Narth was not as a rule the most pleasant person
  at the breakfast table. In ordinary times Joan Bray rather dreaded that early
  meal, when the bacon was generally too salt, and the coffee too strong, and
  when Mr Narth was wont to recite the extraordinary expense of running his
  house.</p>

  <p>Since the interrupted luncheon party Stephen Narth's manner had undergone
  a remarkable change, and he was never so pleasant to the girl as he was on
  the seventh morning after the arrival of the queer man from China.</p>

  <p>"They tell me that your friend has got his house finished and furnished,"
  he said, almost jovially. "I suppose we shall be putting up the banns for
  you, Joan? Where would you like to be married?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him aghast.</p>

  <p>She had not associated the repairs to the Slaters' Cottage with her own
  matrimonial adventure. In truth, she had not seen Clifford Lynne since that
  afternoon he brought her back from London. Joan had the uncomfortable feeling
  that she had been rather left in the air; she was suffering a little from the
  reaction of Clifford Lynne's violent proposal. The period of calm which had
  followed his eruption into her life was in the nature of an anti-climax; she
  remembered once a great politician who had come to the town where she had
  spent her childhood, and who had been welcomed with bands and banners; just
  as he was about to commence his speech expressing his thanks for the welcome,
  a fire had broken out in an adjacent street, and his audience had melted
  away, leaving him forlorn and wholly unimportant compared with the
  conflagration which had suddenly gripped the fickle interest of his admirers.
  She could sympathize with him.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen Mr Lynne," she said. "And as to marriage. I'm not so sure
  that he was serious."</p>

  <p>Mr Narth's manner changed.</p>

  <p>"Not serious? Rubbish!" he exploded. "Of course he's serious! The whole
  thing is arranged. I must talk to him and fix a date. You shall be married at
  Sunningdale Church, and Letty and Mabel shall be your bridesmaids. In fact, I
  think you girls had better go up to town and see about your clothes. It had
  better be a quiet wedding, with as few guests as possible. You never know
  what this fellow will do; he's such a wild harum-scarum that is likely as not
  he will come with an escort of niggers! You had a chat with him, didn't you,
  when you came back from the&mdash;er&mdash;office?"</p>

  <p>This was the first allusion he had made for some days to the lunch.</p>

  <p>"Didn't he tell you what was his salary?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"Really, father," said Mabel, spreading butter on her toast, "isn't his
  salary a matter rather dependent on you? Of course we shall have to keep him
  on: it would be a dirty trick to let Joan marry him and then throw him out;
  but I really think he should be spoken to&mdash;his manner is most
  disrespectful."</p>

  <p>"And his language is appalling," said Letty. "Do you remember, father,
  what he said?"</p>

  <p>"'Hell's bells,'" mused Mr Narth. "It is a new expression to me. I should
  imagine that he had a contract with poor Joe Bray, so the question of his
  salary may not arise for some time. Joe was a very generous man and he is
  certain to have given this fellow enough to live on, so you need have no
  qualms on the subject, my dear."</p>

  <p>"I haven't," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"Why he has repaired the Slaters' Cottage so extravagantly, I don't know,"
  Stephen continued. "He surely doesn't expect that I shall allow him to stay
  here! A manager's place is&mdash;er&mdash;near the business he manages. Of
  course, I don't mind giving him a few months' leave&mdash;that is usual, I
  believe&mdash;but he will find it difficult to sell the cottage for anything
  like the cost of the repairs."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch, rubbed his mouth vigorously with his serviette
  and got up from the table, and with his departure to town events at Sunni
  Lodge looked as though they would settle down to normal. But he had not been
  gone more than two hours when his car came up the drive and the chauffeur
  brought in a note to Joan, who was deep in her household accounts.
  Wonderingly she opened the letter.</p>

  <p>Dear Joan,&mdash;Can you come up straight away? I want to see you. I shall
  be at Peking House.</p>

  <p>"Where is Peking House, Jones?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>The man looked at her oddly.</p>

  <p>"It's near the Tower, miss," he said, "not a quarter of a mile from Mr
  Narth's office."</p>

  <p>Letty and her sister were in the village, and, putting on her hat, the
  girl entered the waiting car. At the far end of Eastcheap, and within sight
  of that grim old pile that William the Conqueror had built upon Saxon
  foundations, was a new and handsome stone-fronted building that differed from
  its neighbours in that it towered six stories above the tallest. A broad
  flight of marble steps led up to the handsome portico and the marble-lined
  hall. But its real difference, to the girl, was the character and nationality
  of its occupants. A stalwart Chinese janitor in a perfectly-fitting uniform
  ushered her into a lift that was worked by another Chinaman, and as the lift
  ascended she saw that the marble corridors were alive with little yellow men
  hurrying from room to room. When she got out of the lift she saw, through a
  door, a large room where, behind serried lines of desks, sat row upon row of
  spectacled young Chinamen busy with ink, brush and paper.</p>

  <p>"Queer, isn't it?" The Cockney clerk who had been her companion in the
  lift grinned as they stepped out. "It's the only place in the City of London
  run entirely by Chinks! Peking Enterprise Corporation&mdash;heard of it?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I haven't," confessed the girl with a smile.</p>

  <p>"There isn't a white clerk in the building," said the young man
  disgustedly; "and the girl typists&mdash;my God! you ought to see some of
  their faces!"</p>

  <p>The lift man was waiting impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Come along, miss," he said, almost peremptorily, she thought, and
  followed him down the corridor to the end, where he opened a door marked
  'Private.' A yellow-faced girl rose from her typist's chair.</p>

  <p>"You Mrs Bray?" she asked, with the awkwardness of one who was not versed
  in the language she was speaking, and, when Joan nodded, the girl opened a
  second door. "You go in," she said, in the same tone of command that Joan had
  noticed in the liftman.</p>

  <p>The first impression the girl had as she entered the room was that she had
  strayed by mistake into a musical comedy palace. The luxury of marble and
  satin, of cut glass and mossy carpet, the evidence of vulgar wealth in gilded
  furniture and silken tapestry, struck her dumb. The high ceiling was crossed
  with scarlet rafters on which golden Chinese characters had been superimposed
  in relief. The variety of colours almost blinded her; the only tasteful thing
  in the room was a great stained-glass window facing her. Beneath this, at a
  table which seemed to have been carved from solid ebony, sat Fing-Su, who
  rose as she appeared and came mincingly across the room to greet her.</p>

  <p>"Your uncle will be here in a few moments, my dear Miss Bray," he said.
  "Pray be seated."</p>

  <p>He pushed forward something that was not quite as big as a settee, yet was
  more imposing than the average throne.</p>

  <p>"I feel rather like the Queen of Sheba on a visit to Solomon," she said,
  amusement for the moment quietening her unease.</p>

  <p>He bowed low. Evidently he took this as a compliment.</p>

  <p>"You are indeed more beautiful than the Queen of Sheba, and more worthy of
  Sehlomon, the son of David. Had I the wealth of Sennacherib, the King of
  Ashkelon, I would give you the spoils of Azur and Bethdacon."</p>

  <p>She was taken aback by the extravagance of his speech.</p>

  <p>"Mr Narth is coming?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He looked at her, biting his thin lower lip thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"No, he is not coming," he said. "The truth is, Miss Bray, that he thought
  it advisable that I should see you in reference to our friend Lynne. The last
  time we met, if you will remember, there was rather an awkward scene, not of
  my seeking. Mr Lynne has conceived an unkindly sentiment for me which is
  largely due to my race. I will not say 'unfortunate race,'" he went on,
  "because I do not regard ours as in any way inferior to yours. We are human;
  we have been for thousands of years on a higher intellectual level. And Mr
  Lynne has no reason to dislike us. My revered father"&mdash;he made an almost
  imperceptible genuflexion &mdash;"did much to found the fortune of the Yun
  Nan Syndicate&mdash;indeed, but for his help the concessions would never have
  been secured and certainly never worked."</p>

  <p>She was not prepared to listen to the story of the Yun Nan Concession and
  its beginnings. She was in truth in a state bordering upon fear, and she rose
  from her voluminous chair.</p>

  <p>"I hardly know Mr Lynne well enough to discuss him&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"And yet you are going to marry him?"</p>

  <p>The flush which came to her cheeks was rather of annoyance than
  embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"That is a matter which concerns me entirely, Mr Fing," she said, and he
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Fing-Su? Well, I prefer that name. St Clay is cumbersome and a little
  stupid."</p>

  <p>He was regarding her absently.</p>

  <p>"You are a clever girl. There is intelligence in your face; you are
  sensitive to impressions; you have indeed all the qualities which I desire in
  an assistant&mdash;and I have many assistants, yellow and white."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand you," she said.</p>

  <p>"Let me put it clearly to you. I have a reason for wishing the
  friendship&mdash;at least the non-antagonism&mdash;of Clifford Lynne. You are
  in a position to help me very considerably. Do you know anything about the
  Stock Exchange, Miss Bray?"</p>

  <p>"The Stock Exchange?" she said in astonishment. "No, I know very
  little."</p>

  <p>"You know this much&mdash;that there is a company called the Yun Nan
  Concessions?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes; Mr Narth was telling me yesterday morning that the shares stood at
  two and three-quarters."</p>

  <p>"The ordinary shares," he corrected gently. "You have never seen the
  founders' shares in the market."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I should recognize them if I saw them," she said frankly.
  "The Stock Exchange is a mystery to me."</p>

  <p>"Yet there are forty-nine founders' shares." He spoke with great
  deliberation. "And I wish to buy one!"</p>

  <p>She stared at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"One?" she repeated.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Just one. They have no market quotation. Originally they were worth one
  pound. Today for that one share I am prepared to pay a million!"</p>

  <p>She could only shake her head helplessly.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't help you&mdash;unless," as a thought struck her, "you
  would be able to buy one from Mr Narth."</p>

  <p>He was amused.</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady, Joseph Bray has left no founders' shares to Mr Narth;
  he has left ordinary shares. The only person from whom such a share is
  purchasable is your fiancé, Clifford Lynne. Get me that certificate and I
  will give you a million pounds! You shall have no reason to marry a man who
  has been forced upon you by your stupid relations. A million pounds! Think of
  that, Miss Bray&mdash;an enormous fortune which will make you as free as the
  air and independent of Narth and Lynne! Think this matter over! I would not
  like you to make a decision at this moment. And please remember that in doing
  this you would be pleasing my dearest friend and patron, now, alas!
  dead."</p>

  <p>He walked to the door and opened it with a flourish. Evidently the
  interview was at an end.</p>

  <p>"You will think of this? And will you be good enough to regard all I have
  said in this room as confidential? And please remember that, the day you hand
  me that share certificate, I will give you a cheque on the Bank of England
  for a million pounds. I will ask no questions&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her steady eyes met his.</p>

  <p>"There will be no questions to ask," she said quietly, "for I shall never
  bring the share. If it is worth a million to you, it is surely worth a
  million to Mr Lynne."</p>

  <p>He smiled his inscrutable smile.</p>

  <p>"The cheque will be ready for you. This may mean a great deal for you.
  Miss Bray," he said.</p>

  <p>Joan hastened to her relative's office, and with every turn of the car
  wheels her anger grew.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr Stephen Narth was obviously uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"I hope you didn't mind, Joan?" he said, as he faced the indignant girl.
  "The truth is, I am rather under an obligation to the fellow, and he was so
  keen on seeing you about this business that I simply had to get the thing
  over. Why he wants to buy a founders' share in the company, heaven only
  knows. They're not worth a penny."</p>

  <p>She was staggered by this intelligence.</p>

  <p>"Not worth a penny&mdash;?" she began.</p>

  <p>"Not worth a penny," said Narth. "Well, perhaps that is an exaggeration.
  They're entitled to a nominal dividend of 2½ per cent, which means that
  they're worth about eight shillings per share. They've never been on the
  market and never will be. I don't believe old Joe had many, either. But I'll
  make sure."</p>

  <p>He rang a bell, and to the patient Perkins:</p>

  <p>"Get me the Articles of Association of the Yun Nan Concessions
  Corporation," he said.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes the clerk came back with a thick, blue-covered volume,
  which he laid on the desk. Mr Narth turned the dusty sheets and stopped at
  the first page with an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"That's queer! I didn't know Lynne was a director." He frowned. "A sort of
  nominee, I expect," he said, as he turned page after page.</p>

  <p>Five minutes' silence, broken only by the rustle of the leaves, and
  then:</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm damned!" gasped Mr Narth. "Listen to this: 'The policy of the
  Company and the direction of its reserves shall be determined by a Board of
  Administration which shall be nominated by ballot. At the ballot only holders
  of the aforesaid founders' shares shall vote. Notwithstanding anything
  contained in these articles which may be construed otherwise, the Board of
  Directors shall be the nominees of such a majority&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>He looked up, startled.</p>

  <p>"That means that the ordinary shareholders have no voice at all in the
  management of the company," he said, "and that of forty-nine shares issued,
  Fing-Su has twenty-four&mdash;phew!"</p>

  <p>He looked at the girl open-eyed.</p>

  <p>"Somebody told me today that the Yun Nan Company had a reserve of eight
  millions!" he said. "Got it out of coal and a gold-field and the money they
  had sent them after the Russian revolution..."</p>

  <p>He was a little incoherent.</p>

  <p>"And the majority are held by Clifford Lynne," he said slowly, and for the
  first time he became conscious of the ruthless struggle that was in progress
  for the control of this great reserve.</p>

  <p>His hand went up to his trembling lips.</p>

  <p>"I wish to God I was out of it!" he said huskily, and something of his
  fear was communicated to the girl.</p>

  <p>Driving back to Sunningdale, Mr Narth's car, in which she was travelling,
  overtook a very ordinary-looking taxicab, and it was only by accident that
  she glanced at its occupant. It was Clifford Lynne, and at his signal she
  stopped the car.</p>

  <p>He got out of the cab, walked to the car and, without even asking
  permission, he opened the door of the car and stepped in.</p>

  <p>"I'll travel with you as far as the end of my street," he said. "The fact
  is, my cab is rather uncomfortably loaded with grub! I'm taking possession of
  my new domain."</p>

  <p>He was looking at her keenly.</p>

  <p>"You have been to town. I won't presume to anticipate the rights of a
  loving husband and ask you why you are traveling in this splendour, but I
  presume that you have been visiting friend Narth?" And then, quickly: "You
  didn't see Fing-Su, did you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw him," she said. "I had an interview with him this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"The devil you did!"</p>

  <p>If he was angry he did not betray his emotions.</p>

  <p>"And what did that naïve and ingenious child of nature say to you?" he
  asked banteringly. "I'll bet it was something pretty crude! There never was a
  Europeanized Chinaman who did not go through life under the delusion that he
  was a diplomat!"</p>

  <p>Should she tell him? She had given no promise, and only had Fing-Su's
  request that the character of the interview should be secret.</p>

  <p>He saw her hesitation, and with uncanny shrewdness leapt straight at the
  truth.</p>

  <p>"He didn't want to buy a founders' share of the YNC, did he?"</p>

  <p>And, when she went red, he slapped his knee and laughed long and
  riotously.</p>

  <p>"Poor old Machiavelli!" he said at last drying his eyes. "I never dreamt
  he would be satisfied with his tenth!"</p>

  <p>"His tenth?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes; Fing-Su owns a tenth of our property. That is news to you? Joe Bray
  held another tenth."</p>

  <p>"But who has the remainder?" she asked in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Your future lord, but I doubt master," he said. "Our Chinese friend is
  more than a millionaire, but isn't satisfied. In a moment of temporary
  aberration Joe parted with a block of founders' shares to Fing-Su's father,
  and on top of that he handed most of the remainder to Fing-Su himself!
  Honestly, I don't believe Joe was ever sane; and the maddest thing he ever
  did&mdash;" Here he checked himself. "Maybe he didn't do that... but I have
  my suspicions, and I shall know for certain tonight."</p>

  <p>She did not ask him what those suspicions were and he went on:</p>

  <p>"There was no real company until I joined forces with Joe. He'd just
  scraped a little coal out of the land for which Fing-Su's sainted parent got
  the concession. But the silly old gentleman had made an agreement that his
  Chinese helper should have a tenth share of the profits. I didn't know this
  until I'd added a large tract of coal land to the property, and after that
  the legal difficulties of kicking out Fing-Su's papa were such that it wasn't
  worth while fighting. What I did, however, was to refloat the company with a
  larger capital&mdash;does this bore you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I only dimly understand," she said, "but I want to, badly!"</p>

  <p>Again his quick, half-suspicious scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"It was then that I put in the clause about the founders' shares to
  prevent dear old Joe from doing anything more altruistic. Your revered
  relative was not the most intelligent of men, though the truest heart that
  ever beat, and founders' shares meant nothing to him when he discovered there
  was no profit attached to them. Of the forty-nine shares issued, Fing-Su's
  father took nine (Joe was stout on this point), and Joe and I took twenty
  each."</p>

  <p>"What do the reserves mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>For a second he looked at her, suspicion in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"We have a large reserve," he said at last, "but a great deal of it really
  doesn't belong to us. You see, we had a very big business in
  Manchuria&mdash;we were bankers there amongst other things, and when the
  revolution came along, enormous sums were deposited with us and transferred
  to Shanghai. Many of the depositors, poor souls, are dead, and these include
  some of the biggest. In the present state of chaos it is impossible to trace
  their relatives. Their money is known as Reserve B: that is the reserve which
  Fing-Su is after!"</p>

  <p>He saw that she was puzzled, and went on:</p>

  <p>"It was not until a few months ago that I learnt that Joe had given away
  more than half his founders' shares to this sleek young scoundrel Fing-Su. He
  would have given him the lot, only five of the certificates &mdash;each share
  is separated&mdash;he couldn't find. Thank God I got them and had them
  transferred to me. Whilst I have the predominant holding, Fing-Su can do
  nothing with the reserves. Once he has that share, not all the courts of
  China can stop his playing the devil with other people's money. Oh, Joe!
  You've got a lot to answer for!"</p>

  <p>This time she reproached him.</p>

  <p>"Mr Lynne&mdash;Clifford, you want me to call you?&mdash;how can you say
  such unpleasant things about a man who was your friend and is now dead?"</p>

  <p>He did not reply immediately, and when he did it was to ignore the
  question.</p>

  <p>"This world is a pretty good place to live in," he said, "and I hate the
  thought of leaving it&mdash;but one of these days I'm going to kill
  Fing-Su!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Joan Bray had a large attic which had come to be the most
  comfortable room in the house. It was not intended to be such when this
  retreat was given to her; but Joan was popular with the servants at Sunni
  Lodge, and in some mysterious way odd and cosy pieces of furniture had found
  their way to the room under the roof with its big windows and outlook. It had
  a special value to her now, for from this vantage she could see the square
  chimney of the Slaters' Cottage, and this gave her an indefinable sense of
  communion with the strange man who had come over her horizon.</p>

  <p>The girls were out when she arrived, and she went up to her attic
  apartment, locked the door and sat down on the ancient sofa and, with her
  head between her hands, tried to straighten out the confusion in her mind.
  That Clifford Lynne had been no salaried servant of her relative, she had
  suspected from the first. He was a rich man, richer even than Joe Bray
  &mdash;what effect would that have had upon Stephen Narth's attitude had he
  known from the first? Suppose, instead of the apparition with the wild beard
  and the untidy clothes, there had appeared at Sunni Lodge that fateful
  afternoon this good-looking, well-dressed man, not in his role of manager,
  but as co-partner of Joe Bray? She had no doubt at all as to what would have
  been the result.</p>

  <p>Somehow&mdash;she could not exactly tell why&mdash;the knowledge of
  Clifford's wealth depressed her. For what appeared now to be a very
  inadequate reason, she had steeled her soul to an appalling marriage with an
  unknown man, and had grown used to the prospect of her sacrifice. She shook
  her head. She was cheating herself: it had never really seemed a sacrifice.
  The stranger had interested her from the first; was an individuality so far
  outside the range of her experience that his very novelty had overcome all
  her natural qualms.</p>

  <p>Joan was beginning to see life from a new angle, to realize the tremendous
  difference this marriage would make, and Letty (or was it Mabel?) had been
  right. What did a girl know about the lover into whose hands she placed her
  future? Already she knew, and was more akin to, the nature of Clifford Lynne
  than had been half a dozen brides she could recall to the real character of
  the men they had wed.</p>

  <p>Walking to the window, she stood looking at that visible portion of the
  Slaters' Cottage which showed through the trees. Smoke was coming from the
  chimney now, and she remembered the cab full of provisions and wondered if
  Clifford Lynne was as efficient as a cook as he seemed in other
  directions.</p>

  <p>Woodmen were engaged in felling the trees about the cottage. Even as she
  looked she saw a high fir topple over slowly and heard the crash of its
  branches as it struck the ground. By tomorrow the cottage would be almost
  completely visible, she thought, and turned at that moment as a tap came upon
  the door.</p>

  <p>"It's Letty," said a shrill voice, and, when she hastened to turn the key:
  "Why on earth do you lock yourself in, Joan?"</p>

  <p>Letty had only made two visits to the room, and now she looked around with
  an air of surprise.</p>

  <p>"Why, you're very comfortable here!" she said, and, had Joan been
  uncharitable, she would have read into the surprise a note of disappointment.
  "Father has been on the telephone; he won't be home tonight. He wants us to
  go up to dinner with him&mdash;you don't mind being left alone?"</p>

  <p>It was an unusual question, considering that it was addressed to one who
  had spent many an evening alone and was glad of the privilege.</p>

  <p>"We may be late because we're going on to a dance at the Savoy after the
  theatre."</p>

  <p>She was turning to go, with another glance round the room, when she
  remembered something.</p>

  <p>"I've seen that man Lynne, Joan. He's awfully good looking! Why on earth
  did he come here in that ridiculous get-up?"</p>

  <p>Here was the inevitable grievance which Joan had anticipated. Minds were
  evidently working along parallel lines at Sunni Lodge.</p>

  <p>"Not that it would have made any difference to me," said Letty, with a
  lift of her chin. "A girl can't live on good looks."</p>

  <p>There was an imp of mischief in Joan Bray's composition, and she was,
  moreover, intensely curious to know what would be the effect upon the girls
  if she passed on her information.</p>

  <p>"Clifford Lynne is not a poor man: he is very rich," she said. "Mr Bray
  only held a one-tenth interest in the company. Clifford Lynne has a
  four-fifths holding."</p>

  <p>Letty's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"Who told you that?" she asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"Clifford Lynne. And I know he was speaking the truth."</p>

  <p>Letty opened her mouth to say something, changed her mind, and, slamming
  the door behind her, went downstairs. In five minutes the girl heard voices
  outside the door, and without knocking Mabel came in, followed by her
  sister.</p>

  <p>"What is this that Letty tells me about Lynne?" she asked almost
  querulously. "It is rather curious that we haven't heard about it
  before?"</p>

  <p>Joan was amused; she could have laughed aloud, but she managed to keep a
  straight face.</p>

  <p>"You mean about Mr Lynne's wealth? He's a very rich man&mdash;that is all
  I know."</p>

  <p>"Does Father know too?" asked Mabel, struggling to suppress her
  unreasonable anger.</p>

  <p>Joan shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I should imagine he doesn't."</p>

  <p>The two sisters looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"Of course, this alters everything," said Mabel emphatically. "In the
  first place, nobody wanted to marry a scarecrow, and in the second place, it
  was ridiculous to expect either of us girls to tie ourselves for life to a
  poverty-stricken servant, as it were, of uncle's."</p>

  <p>"Preposterous!" agreed Letty.</p>

  <p>"It was obviously Mr Bray's idea that he should marry one of us girls,"
  said Mabel. "I don't suppose he'd ever heard of your existence, Joan."</p>

  <p>"I'm pretty sure he hadn't," answered Joan, and Mabel smiled, as she
  seated herself in the most comfortable chair in the room.</p>

  <p>"Then we've got to be just sensible about this," she said, in her most
  amiable tone. "If what you say is true&mdash;and of course I don't think for
  one moment that you've made it up&mdash;dear Uncle Joe's wishes should
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fulfilled," suggested Letty, when Mabel paused for a word.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's it&mdash;fulfilled. It is a little awkward for you, but
  practically you don't know the man, and I'm sure the idea of this marriage
  has worried you a great deal. As I was saying to Letty, if there is any
  sacrifice to be made, it is up to us to make it. We don't want to use you, so
  to speak, as a catspaw, but at the same time I feel that we haven't quite
  played the game with you, Joan. I told father only this morning that I had my
  doubts about the marriage, and that we ought to think the matter over more
  before we allowed you perhaps to let yourself in for a perfectly horrible
  life with a man you don't know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you don't know him quite so well," Joan was compelled to say.</p>

  <p>"Still, we've larger experience of men," said Mabel, gravely reproachful.
  "And don't think for one moment, Joan, that the question of his wealth makes
  the slightest difference to us. Papa is rich enough to give me a good time
  whether I marry Clifford Lynne or not."</p>

  <p>"Whether either of us marries Clifford Lynne or not," corrected Letty with
  some asperity, "and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. Letty, who was nearest, opened it. It was
  the butler.</p>

  <p>"There's a gentleman called to see Miss Joan&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>Letty took the card from his hand.</p>

  <p>"Clifford Lynne," she said breathlessly, and Joan laughed.</p>

  <p>"Here is an excellent opportunity of settling the matter, Mabel," she
  said, not without malice. "After all, he ought to be consulted!"</p>

  <p>Letty went red and white.</p>

  <p>"Don't you dare!" she exclaimed breathlessly. "I will never forgive you,
  Joan, if you repeat one word!"</p>

  <p>But the girl was already half way down the first flight of stairs.</p>

  <p>Joan went alone to the drawing-room, oblivious to the whispered
  injunctions which followed her down. She had an almost overpowering
  inclination to laugh, and there flashed to her mind a homely parallel; only,
  if she were Cinderella, neither Letty nor the plump Mabel could by any
  stretch of imagination be described as the ugly sisters.</p>

  <p>She found him standing at a window looking out over the lawn, and he
  turned quickly at the sound of the opening door. In his abrupt way and
  without preamble he asked:</p>

  <p>"Could I see you tonight?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;yes," she said. And then, remembering: "I shall be alone. The
  girls are going to town."</p>

  <p>He scratched his chin at this.</p>

  <p>"Are they?" He frowned. "But that doesn't make a great deal of difference.
  I want to see you at the cottage. Would you come if I called for you?"</p>

  <p>The proprieties were never a strong point with Joan; she was so sure of
  herself, so satisfied with the correctness of her own code, that other
  people's opinion of her did not matter. But his suggestion did not accord
  with her own theory of behaviour.</p>

  <p>"Is that necessary?" she asked. "I will come if you wish me to, for I know
  you would not invite me unless you had a special reason."</p>

  <p>"I have a very special reason," he insisted. "I want you to meet somebody.
  At least I think I do."</p>

  <p>He ran his fingers through his hair irritably.</p>

  <p>"A friend of mine&mdash;and not so much of a friend either."</p>

  <p>She was astonished at his agitation and could only wonder I what was the
  extraordinary cause.</p>

  <p>"I'll call for you about ten," he said. "And, Joan, I've been thinking
  matters over and I'm rather worried."</p>

  <p>Instinctively she knew that the cause of his trouble was herself.</p>

  <p>"Have you changed your mind?" she bantered.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"About marrying you? No. I've never dared let myself see how this fool
  adventure would end. If I hadn't been doped with a drugging sense of
  duty&mdash;however, that has nothing to do with the case. We shall have to
  consider the position from a new angle tonight. I'd gone so far and suffered
  so much&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Suffered?"</p>

  <p>He nodded vigorously.</p>

  <p>"By a provision of nature," he said soberly, "you are spared the misery of
  growing a long and golden beard. It wasn't so bad when I was miles from
  everywhere in my little house in Siangtan, and on the voyage home; it was
  when I came into contact with civilization&mdash;can you imagine what it is
  to dress for dinner and to discover that when you fastened your collar you
  had imprisoned a large and painful hank of hair?... However, that's done
  with, and now"&mdash;he paused awkwardly &mdash;"I'm not sorry."</p>

  <p>"About growing a beard?" she asked innocently.</p>

  <p>He looked her straight in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"You know jolly well I don't mean anything about the beard, and that I'm
  talking of you. I wish I had time to study you. You've probably got a fearful
  temper&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Vile," she admitted mendaciously.</p>

  <p>"And possibly you're vain and empty-headed," he went on with great
  calmness. "All pretty girls are vain and empty-headed; that is one of the
  lessons I learnt at the knee of the maiden aunt who brought me up. But in
  spite of these drawbacks I kind of like you. That's queer, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It would be queer if you didn't," she said, adopting his attitude, and he
  laughed. "Have you committed your murder?"</p>

  <p>He started.</p>

  <p>"Murder? Oh, you mean Fing-Su? No, I fear that tonight I shall be too
  busy. I'm certainly going to kill Fing-Su," he said, and though his tone was
  matter-of-fact, she shivered, for he conveyed to her the impression of a man
  in very great earnest. "I've got to kill him. But tonight?" He shook his
  head. "A lot of things have got to happen before then. When can you marry
  me?"</p>

  <p>He was serious enough, and at the direct question she felt herself going
  red.</p>

  <p>"Is that necessary?" she asked, a little desperately, for now, brought
  face to face with the logical consequence of her undertaking, she had a
  moment of panic. There was something very definite about his question, and
  that gave her a certain fearful twinge of happiness. But it was also too
  businesslike, too free from the atmosphere of tenderness which conventionally
  surrounds such a proposal, and she was just a little bit annoyed with him. It
  brought the proposition back to its original commercial setting, extinguished
  the faint glitter of romance, a sickly flame at best, which the past few days
  had brought to life.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you will suit your own convenience," she said coldly. "You
  realize, of course, Mr Lynne, that I do not love you, any more than you love
  me?"</p>

  <p>"That goes without saying," he said brusquely. "But I will tell you
  something: I've never been in love; I've had my dreams and my ideals, as
  every man and every woman has, and you are the nearest approach to the
  mystery woman of my dreams that I shall ever hope to meet. When I tell you I
  like you, I mean it. I'm not in that ecstatic state of mind when I am
  prepared to kiss the ground on which you walk, but that is a form of delirium
  which may come later."</p>

  <p>All the time he was speaking there was that kind and friendly smile in his
  eyes which made it impossible for her to arouse her resentment to any high
  pitch. She was exasperated with him, and yet could admire his honesty, and
  had no piqued inclination to offer the obvious retort that her heart was at
  least as free as his.</p>

  <p>"Today is Monday," he said. "We will be married on Friday by special
  licence. Friday will be an unlucky day&mdash;for somebody."</p>

  <p>"You really mean Friday?" she asked, with a pang of dismay.</p>

  <p>"It's rather sudden, I know; but then, things are moving more quickly than
  I anticipated," he said.</p>

  <p>He took up his hat from the table where he had placed it when he came
  in.</p>

  <p>"I shall call for you at ten. Do you mind?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"And you're not afraid?" he bantered, and hurriedly added: "There's really
  no reason for fear&mdash;not yet."</p>

  <p>"Tell me when I must begin fearing you," she said, as she walked with him
  to the door.</p>

  <p>"You need never fear me," he said quietly. "I was thinking of somebody
  else."</p>

  <p>"Fing-Su?"</p>

  <p>He looked round at her quickly.</p>

  <p>"A thought-reader too, are you?" He put his hand about her arm and
  squeezed it gently. It was a very friendly, brotherly gesture, and it left
  her, for some reason, very near to tears.</p>

  <p>The two girls, who appeared from nowhere as the door closed on Clifford,
  followed her back to the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"You didn't tell him anything, did you?" asked Mabel rapidly. "You
  wouldn't do anything so mean and underhand as that, Joan?"</p>

  <p>Joan looked at her in surprise.</p>

  <p>"What were we talking about?" she asked, and she was honest in her
  bewilderment, for she had forgotten the conversation in her room.</p>

  <p>"Letty had an awful feeling you'd tell him what we'd been discussing, but
  I said, 'Letty, Joan would never, never do anything so despicable.'"</p>

  <p>"About your marrying him?" asked Joan, suddenly understanding. "Oh, no, I
  had forgotten that&mdash;we were so busy fixing the date&mdash;Mr Lynne and I
  are to be married on Friday."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Mabel.</p>

  <p>Her profanity was pardonable, for in a moment of great self-sacrifice she
  had decided to be Mrs Clifford Lynne.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The sisters went to town at six o'clock, and Joan from her
  window was heartily glad to see the limousine pass out of sight along the
  Egham road. She ate her dinner in solitude and waited impatiently for the
  coming of Clifford Lynne. She was a little baffled by his attitude. The
  marriage was still in the category of business arrangement; with the
  exception of that half-caress he had shown neither tenderness nor that
  sentimental regard for her charms which is to be expected even in the most
  self-possessed of men; and yet there was little that was austere or cold in
  his composition, she was sure. None the less, between them was a barrier
  which must be broken down, a gulf which only mutual affection could bridge.
  For one brief moment the prospect of this cold-blooded marriage terrified
  her.</p>

  <p>She was standing before the half-open front door of the house when she
  heard his quick step on the gravel, and, assuring herself that she had the
  key in her bag, she closed the door gently behind her and went to meet
  him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she found herself in a circle of light.</p>

  <p>"Sorry!" said Clifford's voice. "I was pretty certain it was you, but I
  had to take one peep."</p>

  <p>"Who else might it be?" she asked as she fell in by his side.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," was the unsatisfactory reply.</p>

  <p>Her arm slipped into his in the most natural way.</p>

  <p>"I am by nature cautious and even suspicious, and there's something about
  the English countryside that is more sinister than the bad lands of Honan
  would be to a traveller with a camel-load of 'Mex' dollars! You see, there,
  you know where you are&mdash;you are either at peace or at war with your
  neighbours; but in England you may be at war all the time and never know it.
  Do you mind walking in the middle of the road&mdash;that doesn't scare you,
  does it?" he asked quickly, and she laughed.</p>

  <p>"I've an infinite faith in the police," she said demurely.</p>

  <p>She heard him chuckle.</p>

  <p>"The police? Yes, they're quite all right in most cases, especially when
  they are dealing with known criminals, and the printed categories of crime.
  But Fing-Su isn't a known criminal; he's a highly respectable person. How he
  has escaped the OBE I can't understand. We turn right here."</p>

  <p>There was no need for him to tell her that, for her eyes, accustomed to
  the darkness, saw the dark opening that led to the Slaters' Cottage. What had
  once been a rough wagon track was now a smoothly gravelled road. A few yards
  down the drive she saw the tall column of a light standard.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we're putting in all modern improvements," he said when she called
  his attention to this innovation. "Only the evil love the dark. I, who am of
  a virtuous disposition, use this thousand-candle-power arc to advertise my
  rectitude!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he stopped, and she perforce must halt too.</p>

  <p>"I said the other day that Narth had a pull with you, and you didn't deny
  it," he said. "I discovered the pull a few days ago. Your brother was
  accidentally killed whilst leaving the country with money taken from Narth's
  office."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"That was it, eh?"</p>

  <p>She heard his sigh of relief. What else could he have imagined? she
  wondered.</p>

  <p>"I get it now," he went on as they resumed their walk. "It was that 'after
  all I've done for you' stuff? Otherwise, I should have been completely
  rejected. I'm glad."</p>

  <p>He said this so simply and sincerely that she felt the colour coming to
  her face.</p>

  <p>"Has your friend arrived?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered shortly: "he came an hour ago, the&mdash;" He smothered
  an imprecation.</p>

  <p>"One would think&mdash;" she began, when suddenly he gripped her arm.</p>

  <p>"Don't speak," he whispered.</p>

  <p>Joan saw that he was looking back the way they had come, his head bent in
  a listening attitude, and her heart began to thump painfully. Then, without
  warning, he led her to the side of the road and to the cover of a great fir
  tree and pushed her behind it.</p>

  <p>"Stay there," he said in the same low tone.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately he disappeared, making his way noiselessly over a
  carpet of pine needles from tree to tree. She stared back after him; all she
  could see was the pale evening sky behind a belt of tall firs, and the sky's
  reflection of a puddle which had gathered at the side of the drive. She was
  not usually nervous, but now she felt her knees trembling under her, and her
  breath came shallowly. After a while she saw him emerge from the gloom near
  at hand.</p>

  <p>"It was nothing," he said, but she noticed that he still kept his voice
  down. "I thought I heard somebody following us. I'll have these trees down
  tomorrow; they make too good cover&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Something came past them with the sound of a hissing whip. There was a
  thud, and silence. He said something in a strange language, and then he
  stepped back and, reaching up, pulled something from the trunk of a fir.</p>

  <p>"A throwing knife," he whispered. "I tell you, these Yun Nan murderers are
  wonderful shots, and the devils can see in the dark! Where's the nearest
  policeman?"</p>

  <p>In spite of herself she was shivering.</p>

  <p>"The patrol won't be near here for another hour," she faltered. "Did
  somebody throw a knife?"</p>

  <p>"Not for another hour, eh?" he said, almost brightly. "Providence is on my
  side!"</p>

  <p>He took a thing from his pocket&mdash;in the half light it looked to be a
  fat silver cylinder; she saw he was fitting it to the end of a long, black
  pistol.</p>

  <p>"Mustn't alarm the neighbours," he said, and slipping from her side, again
  vanished into the darkness.</p>

  <p>She waited, her heart in her mouth, and suddenly:</p>

  <p>'<i>Plop!</i>'</p>

  <p>The squawk that followed came from somewhere surprisingly near. She heard
  on the gravel drive a patter of feet that grew fainter and fainter. When it
  had ceased, Clifford rejoined her, and he was unfixing the silver box.</p>

  <p>"Got him, but not seriously," he said. "I'm glad I didn't kill him. I
  should either have had to bury him in the wood and risk a scandal, or take
  him before a magistrate and make a newspaper sensation."</p>

  <p>"Did you shoot him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I shot him all right," he said carelessly. "I think he was
  alone."</p>

  <p>Again he took her by the arm and led her along the drive, and they walked
  swiftly towards the Slaters' Cottage. There was no sign of life: the
  shuttered windows were dead, and even the sound of the muffled explosion had
  not roused the interest or curiosity of Clifford Lynne's guest.</p>

  <p>He waited for almost a minute on the step of the cottage, listening.</p>

  <p>"I think there was only one man," he said with a little sigh of relief,
  "and probably a watcher, who reckoned he'd improve the shining hour by a
  little target practice. You're not frightened?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am," she said; "I'm horribly frightened!"</p>

  <p>"So am I," he said. "I hate myself for taking this risk with you, but I
  had no idea there was any danger&mdash;yet."</p>

  <p>He put a key in the lock and opened the door. They were in a narrow
  passageway, from which, she saw as he switched on the light, two doors led
  left and right.</p>

  <p>"Here we are." He walked before her, turned the handle of the left-hand
  door and threw it open.</p>

  <p>The room was newly and well furnished. Two large bulkhead lights fixed to
  the ceiling threw a diffused light through opalescent globes upon the
  apartment and its contents.</p>

  <p>Sitting before the wood fire was a big man. She judged him to be sixty,
  and he was curiously attired. He wore, over a pair of neatly creased
  trousers, a huge red dressing-gown, behind which a stiff shirt shone whitely.
  He had on neither collar nor tie, and an immaculate morning coat hung over
  the back of a chair. As the door opened he looked up, took out the short clay
  pipe he had been smoking, and stared soberly at the visitor.</p>

  <p>"Meet Miss Joan Bray," said Lynne curtly.</p>

  <p>The big stranger got heavily to his feet, and the girl noticed that on his
  many-chinned face was the cowed look of a schoolboy detected in an unlawful
  act.</p>

  <p>"Now, Joan," said Lynne grimly, "I want you to know a relative of yours.
  Let me introduce you to the late Joe Bray, who was dead in China and is alive
  in England!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Joan could only stare, speechless, at her relative. Joe
  Bray! If she had indeed seen a ghost she could not have been more
  staggered.</p>

  <p>He turned a sheepish face to Clifford.</p>

  <p>"Have a heart, Cliff!" he pleaded feebly. "Have a heart!"</p>

  <p>"I have a heart and I have a head too, and that's where I've the
  advantage, you foolish old conspirator!"</p>

  <p>Joe blinked from Clifford to the girl.</p>

  <p>"It's like this&mdash;" he began loudly.</p>

  <p>"Sit down." Clifford pointed to the chair. "I've had your version six
  times; I don't think I can stand it again. Joan," he said, "this is the
  veritable Joseph Bray, of the Yun Nan Concession. Any mourning which you may
  have ordered for him you can cancel."</p>

  <p>"It's like this&mdash;" began Joe again.</p>

  <p>"It isn't a bit like that," interrupted Lynne.</p>

  <p>There was a twinkle in his eye which she had seen once before.</p>

  <p>"This Joe Bray is romantic." He pointed an accusing finger at the humbled
  man. "He has just brains enough to dream. And one of his crazy dreams was
  that I should marry into his family. And in order to drive me to this
  desperate step he invented a fake story about his being on the point of
  death. To support which&mdash;he has confessed this now&mdash;he procured the
  assistance of a doping, boozing doctor from Canton, who would certify a man
  insane for the price of a double whisky."</p>

  <p>"It's like this&mdash;" attempted Joe, louder still.</p>

  <p>"The moment he got me out of the way," continued the other remorselessly,
  "he sneaked down to Canton with his pal the doctor and followed me home on
  the next boat, leaving instructions that the death wire was to be sent as
  soon as he reached England."</p>

  <p>Here Joe asserted himself violently.</p>

  <p>"You never would have married nobody if I hadn't done it!" he roared.
  "You've got a hard heart, Cliff! Dying wishes don't mean no more to you than
  a beer-stain on a policeman's boot. I had to die! I thought I'd come along to
  the wedding and give you all a surprise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're indecent, Joe," said Clifford gravely. "You're the kind of man who
  can't stay put."</p>

  <p>He turned to Joan, his lips twitching.</p>

  <p>"I had my suspicions when I saw no reference to his death in the English
  newspapers," he said. "Joe isn't particularly important in relation to the
  rest of the world, but he has a pretty big name in China, and the least I
  expected was a couple of lines of regret from our special correspondent in
  Canton. And then when I saw in the <i>North China Herald</i> an announcement
  that Mr Joe Bray had booked a suite on the <i>Kara Maru</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In the name of Miller," murmured Joe.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what name you used, but one of the reporters saw your
  baggage going aboard and recognized you on the street, so the camouflage
  wasn't as blinding as you thought."</p>

  <p>Joe sighed. From time to time his eyes had been straying towards the girl,
  in a furtive, shamefaced way, but now he had the resolution to look at her
  straightly.</p>

  <p>"I must say"&mdash;he waggled his huge head ecstatically&mdash;"I must
  say, Cliff, that you've got the pick of the bunch! She's rather like my
  sister Eliza, who's dead and gone now twenty-eight years. On the other hand,
  she's got my brother George's nose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're not going to sidetrack me with your personalities," said Clifford.
  "You're a wicked old man!"</p>

  <p>"Artful," murmured Joe, "not wicked. It's like this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped, evidently expecting an interruption, and, when it did not
  come, was at some loss to proceed.</p>

  <p>"I've had a lot of disappointments in my life, young lady," he began
  oracularly. "Take Fing-Su! What I've done for that boy nobody knows except me
  and him. And when Cliff told me what sort of a feller he was, you could have
  knocked me down with a feather! I've been kind and generous to that pup, I
  admit it..."</p>

  <p>As he rambled on, the girl's brain grew more active. Joe Bray alive, meant
  the end of all Stephen Narth's plans&mdash;how would it affect her, she
  wondered. She recognized with a feeling of dismay that the reason for the
  marriage had disappeared, and was painfully startled to discover that there
  was any cause for unhappiness in this development.</p>

  <p>Her eyes met Clifford Lynne's and fell; for it was as though in that brief
  glance he had read her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"... When I realized what I'd done I said to him, 'Cliff, I'm sorry.' Did
  I or did I not, Cliff? I said, 'If I'd known what I know now, I'd never have
  parted with them shares.' Did I or did I not, Cliff? To think that that
  dog&mdash;I might even call him worse if you wasn't here, young
  lady&mdash;should get these silly and wicked ideas into his head!"</p>

  <p>Joan was beginning to understand now. "A romance-hound," Clifford had
  called the old man, and she saw now the ponderous diplomacy which had
  produced this present condition of affairs. Joe had invented his own death in
  order to ensure the alliance of the man he loved with a member of his family,
  and it was a little pathetic to think that even 'the family' was largely a
  figment of his imagination. He had known Stephen Narth as a name and had been
  his almoner. He must have heard of Stephen's daughters, but of Joan's
  existence it was fairly certain he had been completely ignorant.</p>

  <p>"Does Mr Narth know you're&mdash;" She hesitated to say 'alive' and
  substituted "back in England?"</p>

  <p>Joe shook his head, and it was Clifford who answered.</p>

  <p>"No, Narth mustn't know. I'm keeping Joe down here for a day or two until
  things develop. And most of all, Joan, Fing-Su mustn't know. That credulous
  native has accepted the news of Joe's death without question. For the moment
  he is concentrating his efforts upon securing the one founders' share which
  will give him control of the company."</p>

  <p>"Would it actually give him that control?" she asked, in surprise.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"It sounds absurd but it is a fact," he said gravely. "If Fing-Su could
  get that share, he would be able to kick me out, take complete control of the
  company, and although, of course, he would be liable at law to deal fairly
  with the ordinary shareholders, in fact he could divert a sum of ten million
  pounds to his own purpose."</p>

  <p>She shook her head helplessly.</p>

  <p>"But surely it is impossible for him to buy that extra share&mdash;isn't
  it, Clifford?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is only one method by which Fing-Su could get control," he said
  slowly, "and I'm hoping that he doesn't realize what that is."</p>

  <p>He offered no further explanation. Soon after, he disappeared into the
  kitchen to brew coffee, and the girl was left alone with the big man
  &mdash;an experience which promised considerable embarrassment, for Joe got
  up and closed the door carefully behind his partner.</p>

  <p>"How do you like him?" he asked in a hoarse whisper as he settled himself
  again in his chair.</p>

  <p>It was an awkward question to answer.</p>

  <p>"He's very nice," she said&mdash;ineffectively, she thought.</p>

  <p>"Ye-es." Joe Bray scratched his chin. "He's a good scout, Cliff. A bit
  hard on other people, but a good fellow." He beamed at her. "So you're one of
  us&mdash;that's fine! You're the kind of girl I'd have picked. What's the
  others like?"</p>

  <p>She was spared the embarrassment of an answer, for he continued:</p>

  <p>"Yes, Cliff's hard! A little drop of gin never did nobody any harm, you
  take it from me, miss. It's good for the kidneys, for one thing. But Cliff's
  pussyfoot&mdash;well, not exactly pussyfoot, you understand, but he doesn't
  like seeing bottles around."</p>

  <p>She gathered that such a sight was not altogether objectionable to Joe
  Bray.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm glad he picked you&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>"To be exact, Mr Bray, I picked him," she said, half laughing, and he
  opened his pale eyes wider.</p>

  <p>"Did you? Did you? Well, he's not a bad fellow. Too quick with his gun,
  but that's youth, always wanting to be killin' somethin'. You'll have a lot
  of children, I've no doubt, miss?"</p>

  <p>At this moment came a very welcome Clifford Lynne, carrying a brand-new
  silver tray laden with brand-new silver coffee-pot and cups. He put the tray
  upon the table, and he had hardly taken his hand away when there was a faint
  click. The sound was so close upon the noise made by the setting tray that
  Joan scarcely noticed it. She saw Cliff look towards the shuttered windows
  and put up his finger, signalling silence.</p>

  <p>"What's that, Cliff?" The old man looked up quickly with a startled
  expression.</p>

  <p>Clifford drew back the curtain, and for the first time the girl saw the
  steel-shuttered windows, each of which had as ornament a long oval boss.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk!" he whispered, and reaching out his hand switched off the
  light.</p>

  <p>The room was now in complete darkness, but suddenly she saw, in the place
  where one of the bosses had been, a narrow opening, as Clifford Lynne took
  the cover from the loophole.</p>

  <p>The moon had risen, and through the slit he could survey the bare space
  before the house. Nobody was in sight, and with his eyes glued to the
  loophole he waited. Presently his patience was rewarded. A dark figure was
  moving in the cover of the trees and making a circuit towards the house.
  Presently he saw another, and then a third, and even as he looked a head rose
  within a few inches of him. Evidently the man had been crouching under the
  window. In the light of the moon the watcher saw the round, almost shaven
  head, the broad nose and high cheekbones of a Chinese coolie. In one hand he
  carried a small package fastened by string to his wrist; the other held a
  sickle-shaped hook.</p>

  <p>He reached up with this, caught the iron guttering and, with an
  extraordinary exhibition of strength which at other times would have excited
  Lynne's admiration, drew himself up to the roof. Clifford waited till the
  dangling feet had disappeared from view, and passed silently to the rear of
  the cottage and out into the open. As he did so, he saw a glint of steel in
  the moonlight that shone upon the belt of firs. Here, the tree-fellers had
  been busy all day, and the stumps of pines showed whitely in the moonlight.
  But the trees still grew thickly some fifty yards from the cottage.</p>

  <p>The cottage was surrounded; nevertheless, he did not hesitate, but,
  keeping in the cover of the outhouse, he reached a point where the roof line
  was visible. He had hardly reached his post when he saw a head come up over
  the roof-tree and presently, clear in the moonlight he saw the Chinaman
  walking swiftly towards the square-shaped chimney.</p>

  <p>He had again fitted his silencer to the nozzle of his pistol.</p>

  <p><i>Plop!</i></p>

  <p>The man on the roof staggered, swayed a little, and then came slipping and
  sliding down the close-set slates and fell with a groan almost at his feet.
  He heard a twitter of excitement from the concealed watchers in the trees;
  saw somebody come running out of cover, and fired. Instantly there was a
  scamper to safety. Clifford Lynne's prowess as a shot was no secret to these
  men.</p>

  <p>Still he waited, expecting an attack to develop. And then, from the far
  end of the drive, he heard the splutter of a motor-lorry being started, the
  grind of gears and the whine of the machine as it moved off. It was the
  shrill jabber of some belated passenger who had jumped aboard as the trolley
  was moving which satisfied Clifford that the attackers had been called off,
  and he turned his attention to the motionless figure that lay on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>Going inside, he called Joe, and the two men carried the wounded man into
  the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"Fing-Su brought them down in a motor-lorry," he said. (He afterwards
  discovered that the vehicle was a motor-bus which was used at the Peckham
  factory to convey workers into the country.)</p>

  <p>"Is he dead?" asked Joe.</p>

  <p>Clifford shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No; the bullet hit him just above the knee, that is the only injury," he
  said as he wrapped a towel about the wound. "The fall from the roof knocked
  him out. O man!" he called in the dialect as the coolie opened his eyes and
  began to glare from one to the other.</p>

  <p>"I am killed!" gasped the man, his face puckering fearfully as he
  recognized Lynne.</p>

  <p>"Who brought you here?"</p>

  <p>"None! I came of my own wish," said the native, and Clifford grinned
  unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Soon," he said, "I will take you into the wood and I will light a little
  fire on your face and you will talk, my friend. But for a while you will stay
  here with Shi-su-ling."</p>

  <p>He gave the native name of the helpless Joe Bray, and it was not a
  particularly flattering one.</p>

  <p>Going back to the girl, he expected to find her in a state of agitation
  and was agreeably disappointed. But she knew that something was wrong and
  guessed that that something was a natural sequel to the knife-throwing
  incident earlier in the evening.</p>

  <p>"Yes," nodded Cliff, "it was a Chinaman who wanted to get even with me. I
  think I'd better cut out the coffee and take you home. They have gone now,"
  he added incautiously.</p>

  <p>"They? How many were there?" she asked.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to be gained by deceiving her. Rather, he thought, she
  had better know the full extent of the peril.</p>

  <p>"Probably more than a dozen were in the attack, and what they expected to
  get I don't know."</p>

  <p>"You," she said significantly, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>"I rather fancy I was the booty," he said. "The important fact is that
  they are gone and there is nothing more to fear."</p>

  <p>He was examining her face, and she had the sensation that he was making a
  final appraisement of her character.</p>

  <p>"But first I will say something that is certain to alarm you," he said.
  "There is nothing to be gained by beating about the bush. Fing-Su will stop
  at nothing, as I know. If he gets the idea into his thick head that I am fond
  of you&mdash;as I am&mdash;he may shift his attentions to you. Does that
  frighten you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Probably because I'm deficient in imagination," she said, "but I'm not
  frightened."</p>

  <p>He opened a steel cupboard in one corner of the sitting-room and took out
  a round black object, the size of a large plum.</p>

  <p>"I want you to keep to your house and not go out after dark," he said.
  "Also, I wish you to put this ball somewhere in your bedroom where you can
  reach it easily. If there is trouble of any kind, throw it out of the
  window&mdash;it isn't very heavy."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"Is it a bomb?"</p>

  <p>"In the ordinary sense, no. It would do you a bit of damage if it burst
  close to you, and I'm not suggesting you should keep it under your pillow. In
  the daytime lock it away in a drawer; at night keep it where it can be
  reached. You're scared," he accused.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not," she protested indignantly. "But you'll admit you are doing
  your best to frighten me!"</p>

  <p>He patted her on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Will anything happen tonight?" she asked, as she took the object in her
  hand and put it very carefully into her bag.</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. Fing-Su is neither a quick nor a thorough worker."</p>

  <p>She looked round for Joe Bray as he escorted her to the door.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to say goodnight&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Joe is busy," he said. "You'll see enough of the old devil&mdash;too
  much. Don't forget this, though: Joe doesn't know the meaning of fear. He's a
  moral coward and he's foolish, but I've seen him tackle five hundred howling
  fanatics with a broken rifle and a clasp-knife."</p>

  <p>They walked swiftly down the drive, Clifford sweeping the gravel with his
  hand-lamp, and presently saw the heavy tracks of the motor-lorry that led to
  the road and turned in the direction of London. When they were within sight
  of Sunni Lodge he stopped.</p>

  <p>"Just show me the room where you sleep. Is it visible from here?"</p>

  <p>She pointed.</p>

  <p>"On the top floor, eh?" he said, relieved. "What is the next room
  &mdash;the one with the white curtains?"</p>

  <p>"That's the kitchen-maid's room," she explained. "At least, it is the room
  where the kitchen-maid sleeps when we have one. At present we're two servants
  short at the Lodge."</p>

  <p>He made a swift survey of the house and was less satisfied. It was easy,
  he saw, to reach even the top floor, for Sunni Lodge was one of those queer
  dwellings which artistic architects love to design. There was a small stone
  balcony here, a turret there, and crowning danger of all, a long iron
  rain-pipe that ran from roof to ground.</p>

  <p>He waited until the door was closed and went hurriedly back to the
  cottage. Joe was sitting in the kitchen smoking his pipe and exchanging
  bitter words in Chinese with the wounded man.</p>

  <p>"You won't get this bird to talk," said Joe disgustedly, "but I know him,
  his name's Ku-t'chan. He used to be a worker in the Fu-Weng store. I
  recognized him at once. It's a curious thing about me, Cliff," he said
  complacently, "that I never forget a face. I've got a memory like one of them
  cash registers you see in stores. The minute I see this feller, I said 'I
  know you, my lad; you're Ku-t'chan,' and he didn't deny it. It's no good
  questioning him, Cliff, he's as mum as a dead fish."</p>

  <p>"You can go back to your book, Joe," said Clifford curtly and shut the
  kitchen door upon his partner, taking his place in the chair.</p>

  <p>"Now, Ku-t'chan, or whatever your name is, speak and speak quickly,
  because in four hours there will be light," he said. "And it is not good that
  anyone should see me burying a Chinaman in the wood. And buried you will
  be."</p>

  <p>"Master," said the frightened man, "why should you kill me?"</p>

  <p>"Because," said Clifford carefully, "if I let you live and you tell the
  magistrate that I laid fire on you, it would put me to shame."</p>

  <p>In a quarter of an hour Ku-t'chan told all he knew, which was not a great
  deal, but was more than enough for Clifford Lynne's peace of mind.</p>

  <p>He made the man comfortable for the night, well assured that after his
  betrayal he would not attempt to escape, and went in to Joe. The fat man
  looked up as he entered.</p>

  <p>"Going out?" he asked, aggrieved. "What's the idea, Cliff? I got a lot to
  talk about."</p>

  <p>"Keep your eye on that man. It is unlikely that he'll give you any
  trouble," said Clifford rapidly. "I don't know when I'll be back, but
  probably before daylight. You know how to turn that couch into a bed if you
  want to sleep?"</p>

  <p>"The point is&mdash;" began the justly incensed Joe.</p>

  <p>Before he could deliver his point, Clifford Lynne was gone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">CHAPTER NINETEEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Stephen Narth and the girls would not be back before three.
  The first inclination Joan had was to await their return before going to bed,
  but she realized that, whatever romance the night held, whatever bizarre
  adventures might come to her between Sunni Lodge and the Slaters' Cottage,
  and however tremendous the revelations of the night had been, she was
  responsible for the smooth running of Stephen Narth's household, and although
  she did not expect to sleep, she went upstairs to bed.</p>

  <p>There were three servants sleeping at the back of the house. The butler
  had part of the suite over the garage which was intended for the chauffeur,
  and was practically cut off from the house. Although he was middle-aged and
  lethargic, she was glad to know that he was on hand, for in spite of her
  protestations she was a little fearful.</p>

  <p>She left the light in the hall, and for once did not extinguish the lamp
  on either of the landings. Her window curtains were drawn, her bed made
  ready, and she was suddenly and desperately tired; yet she sat for half an
  hour on the bed without undressing, until she rose, impatient with herself,
  and began slowly to disrobe. She turned out the light and for half an hour
  lay vainly endeavouring to subdue her thoughts to a level which made sleep
  possible. The house was full of strange noises. It seemed to her imagination
  that she could hear an excited whispering of voices on the landing above.
  Once a floorboard creaked and she sat up in a fright.</p>

  <p>It was then that she remembered the black, plum-shaped ball that Clifford
  had given her, and, rising, she turned on the light and, taking it from her
  bag, put it on the table by the side of her bed. The knowledge that somewhere
  at hand was that strong, quiet man, brought ease to her mind, and presently
  she found herself sinking into the languor of sleep...</p>

  <p>There was somebody in the next room; she found herself sitting up in bed
  with this conviction, her face damp with fear. There it was again &mdash;the
  soft swish of a body brushing against the thin wall, and a faint grinding
  sound as though the intruder had moved a table. She knew the table; it was
  near the bed, a little rickety, bamboo-covered piece of furniture which, with
  a cheap wardrobe and a lumpy bed, constituted the furniture of the servant's
  room.</p>

  <p>Stealing out of bed, she turned on the light and tiptoed to the door,
  listening. There was no sound; it must have been the disordered fancies of a
  dream.</p>

  <p>There was only one possible thing for her to do. She must satisfy herself
  that the room was empty. Turning the key, she pulled open the door and shrank
  back with a scream.</p>

  <p>Standing square in the doorway was a big, uncouth shape, bare to the
  waist, his huge arms dangling. She stared for a second into the black slant
  eyes, and then with a scream reeled back. Before she could understand what
  had happened, he had leapt at her, one brawny arm encircling her, the other
  covering her mouth. Struggling frantically she saw over his shoulder another
  and yet a third man appear. And then, too late, she remembered the bomb. It
  was impossible to wrench herself free from that steel grip that held her. One
  of the men whipped off a blanket from the bed, spread it roughly on the
  floor; the man who held her muttered something, and the third of the Chinamen
  wound a thick silk handkerchief round and round her mouth. And then the arm
  about her suddenly relaxed.</p>

  <p>She was staring up at the evil face, and saw his mouth open in a queer,
  hideous grimace, and huge hands wave, as though to shut out some horrible
  vision. She turned her head in the direction he was staring.</p>

  <p>Clifford Lynne was standing in the doorway, hands on hips, and each hand
  held death.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20">CHAPTER TWENTY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It seemed to Joan Bray that she had slipped out of the world
  in fear, and was returning painfully oppressed with a great apprehension. She
  was in bed, she discovered... Then it was all a terrible dream. But the light
  was still burning, and a man was standing at the foot of her bed, surveying
  her gravely. She raised herself on her elbow, her head swimming, and frowned
  at him.</p>

  <p>"Good morning," said Clifford Lynne lightly. "Your terpsichorean relations
  are slow travellers."</p>

  <p>The faint glow of dawn whitened the windows, she saw as she turned. Her
  face was wet; a glass half filled with water stood on the table by the
  bed.</p>

  <p>"Mr Lynne!" She was trying to think. "Where&mdash;where&mdash;?" She
  stared round the room.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I woke you up, didn't I?" he asked, ignoring the question.
  "I'm a clumsy burglar, though it was the easiest thing in the world to get
  into the room next door. Did you hear me?"</p>

  <p>She nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"It was you, then?" she asked jerkily.</p>

  <p>He was biting his lower lip thoughtfully, still looking at her.</p>

  <p>"I'm hopelessly compromised, I trust you realize that?" he said. "I've
  climbed into your house in the dead of night, I've put you to bed, and here
  are you and I, in the grey dawn! I shudder to think of what Stephen will say
  or the stoutish Mabel will imagine. As for Letty"&mdash;he shrugged his
  shoulders&mdash;"I cannot hope she will extend her well-known charity to
  me."</p>

  <p>She struggled up into a sitting position, her throbbing head between her
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Do you always make a jest of everything?" she asked, and shuddered as the
  memory of the night crowded in upon her. "Where are those awful men?"</p>

  <p>"They're not quite so awful as they look," he said. "Anyway, they've gone.
  They went out of the window, and none of them is seriously hurt &mdash;I am
  glad to say. I already have a sick and stupid coolie on my hands, and I have
  no desire to turn the Slaters' Cottage into a convalescent home for the
  criminal classes of China."</p>

  <p>He drooped his head, listening; his sharp ears had detected the distant
  whine of a motor-car.</p>

  <p>"That sounds like Stephen and the two graces," he said.</p>

  <p>At this she looked up.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" she asked, in consternation. "You mustn't stay
  here."</p>

  <p>He chuckled softly.</p>

  <p>"How like a woman in this crisis to study the proprieties!"</p>

  <p>And then most unexpectedly he walked up to her and, laying his hand upon
  her throbbing head, rumpled her hair.</p>

  <p>"Watch me time my effort," he said, and in an instant was gone.</p>

  <p>She could hear the car now, and, getting out of bed, walked to the window,
  the curtain of which had been pulled aside. Two bright headlamps came into
  view; they turned into the drive. As they did so, she heard the thud of the
  front door close and saw Clifford Lynne dart across the drive to the cover of
  a clump of rhododendrons. Almost before he was out of sight, the car was at
  the door and Stephen Narth had alighted.</p>

  <p>From where she stood she could see the little group: Stephen, his white
  dress-shirt shining palely, the two girls in their over-rich evening wraps.
  She could not see his face, but there was something in his attitude which
  struck the girl as curious; a certain nervous hesitancy in his movements. He
  did not seem anxious to go into the house. He walked twice round the car,
  spoke to the chauffeur, and not until she heard the girls' feet on the stairs
  did he reluctantly enter the hall.</p>

  <p>Letty and Mabel slept on the floor below. She heard Letty's shrill voice
  raised in anger and the deeper tone of her elder sister. And then Mr Narth
  came into the conversation.</p>

  <p>"... of course she's all right," said Letty, in high-pitched tones. "Don't
  be ridiculous, father."</p>

  <p>Joan walked across the room and opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't she be all right?" demanded Mabel. "Stuff and nonsense,
  father! You'll only wake her up... how ridiculous!"</p>

  <p>Stephen's heavy feet were on the stairs and Joan closed the door
  wonderingly. Presently there was a knock at the door, and she opened it.</p>

  <p>"Hallo!" said Narth huskily. "All right?"</p>

  <p>His face was ghastly white, his lower lip was tremulous, and he had pushed
  his hands into his pockets that she should not see them shaking.</p>

  <p>"Everything all right?" he croaked again.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr Narth," she said.</p>

  <p>"Nothing wrong, eh?" He thrust his head forward in a strange, bird-like
  gesture, peering at her. "Everything all right, Joan?"</p>

  <p>His voice was so thick, his manner so strange, that she could only imagine
  he had been drinking. Yet there was no other evidence of indulgence.</p>

  <p>"Nobody disturbed you? That's good... girls woke you up, I suppose?
  Goodnight, Joan."</p>

  <p>He stumbled unsteadily down the stairs and she closed the door,
  wondering.</p>

  <p>She had further cause for wonder when she came down to a solitary
  breakfast later in the morning, and learnt for the first time that the butler
  had been out at dinner on the previous night. Mr Narth had telephoned him,
  asking him to bring a book to town. Why Mr Narth should want a book, when the
  evening had been fully occupied in the chaperonage of his daughters, only he
  could have explained, and then to nobody's satisfaction.</p>

  <p>He came down to breakfast at eleven, a yellow, nervous, irritable man, who
  looked as if he had not slept.</p>

  <p>"Girls not up, eh?" He had a quick, staccato method of talking on such
  occasions as these, and usually he rounded off a bad night with an exhibition
  of bad temper; but although she quite expected a display of irritation, he
  was singularly inoffensive.</p>

  <p>"We shall have to get you married, Joan," he said, as he sat down with a
  grimace before an unappealing breakfast. "That man Clifford is probably a
  good fellow. It's rather awkward, finding that he's the senior partner, and
  I'm glad I didn't say the things I was tempted to say when we met&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am getting married on Friday," said Joan quietly, and he gaped up at
  her with a frightened expression.</p>

  <p>"On Friday?" he squeaked. "Impossible&mdash;impossible! It's &mdash;it's
  indelicate! Why, you don't know the man!"</p>

  <p>He sprang up from his chair in a weak rage.</p>

  <p>"I will not have it! The thing must be done as I wish! Does Mabel
  know?"</p>

  <p>It was surprising that Mabel had not told him, thought Joan. She learnt
  afterwards that Mr Narth's elder daughter was reserving this tit-bit for the
  privacy of a family council.</p>

  <p>"Decency, decency!" quavered Mr Narth, so unlike his usual self that the
  girl could only look at him. "There's a lot to happen before&mdash;before
  you're married. You owe me something, Joan. You haven't forgotten your
  brother&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have not given me much chance of forgetting, Mr Narth," she said,
  with rising anger. "It was because of all you did for my brother that I
  agreed to marry Mr Lynne at all. Clifford Lynne wishes the marriage to take
  place on Friday&mdash;and I have agreed."</p>

  <p>"Have I nothing to do with this?" he stormed. "Am I not to be
  consulted?"</p>

  <p>"Consult him by all means," said the girl coldly.</p>

  <p>"Wait, wait!" he called after her as she was leaving the room. "Don't let
  us lose our tempers, Joan. I have an especial eason for asking you to
  postpone this marriage till a later date&mdash; What is it?" he snapped
  irritably at the newly-returned butler who appeared in the doorway, still in
  his street attire.</p>

  <p>"Will you see Mr Lynne?" asked the man.</p>

  <p>"Does he want to see me?" Stephen demanded. "You're sure he doesn't mean
  Miss Joan?"</p>

  <p>"He particularly asked for you, sir."</p>

  <p>Narth's trembling hand went up to his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Put him in the library," he said ungraciously, and steeled himself to an
  interview which instinct told him would be unpleasant; and in this case
  instinct did not lie, for Clifford had come to ask a few very uncomfortable
  questions.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">He was pacing the library floor when Mr Narth went in ("as
  though it were his own," complained Stephen bitterly to his daughter) and
  turned abruptly to face the senior partner of Narth brothers.</p>

  <p>"Shut that door, will you?"</p>

  <p>It was a command rather than a request, and it was strange how instantly
  Stephen obeyed.</p>

  <p>"You came back here at four o'clock this morning," he began. "You had
  supper at Giro's, which closed at one. What did you and your daughters do
  between one and four?"</p>

  <p>Narth could not believe his ears.</p>

  <p>"May I ask&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Ask nothing. If you were going to ask me what authority I have for
  putting these questions to you, you can save yourself the trouble," said
  Clifford briefly. "I want to know what you were doing between one and
  four."</p>

  <p>"And I absolutely refuse to satisfy your curiosity," said the other
  angrily. "Things have come to a pretty pass when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"At three o'clock this morning," the man from China broke in brusquely,
  "an attempt was made to carry off Joan Bray from this house. That is news to
  you?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded dumbly.</p>

  <p>"You think the attempt has not been made, but you expected it. I was in
  the bushes listening to you when you were talking to the chauffeur. You asked
  him to come into the house after he had put the car away; you told him you
  were nervous, that there had been burglaries in the neighbourhood recently.
  You were astonished to find that Joan Bray was in her room and unharmed."</p>

  <p>White to the lips, Stephen Narth was incapable of replying.</p>

  <p>"You had to fill in the hours between one and four; how did you do it?"
  The keen eyes were searching his very soul. "You wouldn't have gone to
  Fing-Su's place, and rightly, because you would not wish your daughters to be
  brought into contact with this man. Shall I tell you what you did?"</p>

  <p>Narth made no answer.</p>

  <p>"You sneaked out whilst the dance was on and locked the gears of your car.
  You made that an excuse to take your girls to one of those queer all-night
  clubs in Fitzroy Square. And then, providentially, at the right moment you
  discovered the key in your pocket."</p>

  <p>Now Mr Narth found his voice.</p>

  <p>"You're a bit of a detective, Lynne," he answered. "And, strangely enough,
  you're right, except that I did not lock the gears. My chauffeur did that and
  lost the key. I happened to discover a duplicate in my pocket."</p>

  <p>"You didn't want to get back until the dirty work was finished, eh?"
  Clifford's eyes were glowing like live fires. "You swine!" He spoke the word
  in a voice that was little above a whisper. "I'm going to tell you something,
  Narth. If any harm comes to that girl whilst she is in your house and under
  your care, you'll never live to enjoy the competence which Joe Bray is
  supposed to have left you. I'm going to kill your friend &mdash;he knows
  that, doesn't he? If he doesn't, just tell him so from me! There's an old
  saying that one may as well be hanged for a sheep as for a goat. I don't know
  which of the two you are. Listen carefully, Narth &mdash;it isn't an angry
  man talking to you&mdash;threats of killing come pretty glibly to people who
  couldn't see a rooster's neck wrung without fainting. But I've killed men,
  yellow and white, and I'm not going to shiver when I send you down to hell.
  Get that into your mind and let it walk around! Joan won't be with you very
  long, but during that time she's got to be safe."</p>

  <p>And now Stephen Narth found his voice.</p>

  <p>"It's a lie, a lie!" he screamed. "Why didn't Joan tell me? I knew nothing
  about it! Do you think I would allow Fing-Su to take her away&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I didn't say it was Singili," said the other quickly. "How did you
  know?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Chinamen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I didn't even say Chinamen. You've convicted yourself, Mr Stephen Narth!
  I've warned you before, and I'm warning you again. Fing-Su has bought you for
  fifty thousand pounds, but you could twist out of that, because you're
  naturally a twister. But he's going to hold you in a tighter bond than
  monetary obligation. He nearly did it last night. He'll do it before the
  week's out&mdash;how or where or when, I do not know." He paused. "That's all
  I have to say to you," he said, and strode past the paralysed man into the
  hall.</p>

  <p>He was walking down the drive when he heard Stephen's voice calling him,
  and, turning, he saw the white-faced man gesticulating wildly, in a mad
  abandonment of rage. He was pouring forth a torrent of wild, incoherent
  abuse:</p>

  <p>"... you won't marry Joan... do you hear that? I don't care a damn if all
  Joe Bray's fortune goes to you! I'll see her dead first..."</p>

  <p>Clifford let him rave on, and when from sheer exhaustion he stopped:</p>

  <p>"Then you <i>did</i> see Fing-Su last night? What offer did he make to
  you?"</p>

  <p>Stephen glowered at him, and then, as though he feared that his secret
  thoughts could be read by those piercing eyes, he turned and ran back to the
  house like a man possessed.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"There's going to be trouble, Joe, and as you've caused most
  of it I hope you'll get your share."</p>

  <p>Joe Bray, dozing before an unnecessary fire, for the day was warm, his
  hands clasped before his stomach, woke with a start.</p>

  <p>"Eh?... I wish you wouldn't pop in and out like a&mdash;a&mdash;what d'you
  call 'em, Cliff. What did you say?"</p>

  <p>"'Trouble' was the word," said the other laconically. "Your spoon-fed
  Chink plus your disreputable relation have a Plan."</p>

  <p>Joe grunted, selected a cigar from the box on the table and gnawed off the
  end savagely.</p>

  <p>"Wish I'd never come to this bloomin' country," he said plaintively. "Wish
  I'd never left Siangtan. You're a good fellow, Cliff, but too
  vi'lent&mdash;much too vi'lent. I wish Fing-Su had been a sensible boy. Well
  educated and everything, Cliff... it does seem a pity, don't it? Here's me,
  with just enough education to read and write, rich as Creasers in a manner of
  speaking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Cliff's nose wrinkled.</p>

  <p>"Croesus would have spent your income on cigarettes," he said
  contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"In a manner of speaking&mdash;did I say that or didn't I?" demanded Joe
  reproachfully. "Here's me as rich as Creasers and white, and there's him, a
  poor suffering Chink, who can speak Latin and Algebra and French and all them
  foreign languages as easily as I speak Mandarin!"</p>

  <p>He sighed and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Life's comic," he said vaguely.</p>

  <p>Clifford was changing his shoes and growled:</p>

  <p>"If you were the only man I'd ever met in the world I should say life was
  comic. As it is, it's darned serious, and a lot of people whose only job in
  life is to keep living are going to find it pretty hard to hold down their
  sinecure. Have you seen the papers?"</p>

  <p>Joe nodded and reached out lazily for a heap of newspapers that lay on a
  table at his elbow.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was reading about the murder of those missionaries up in Honan.
  But there's always trouble in Honan. Too many soldiers loafin' around hungry.
  If there wasn't soldiers there wouldn't be any brigands."</p>

  <p>"That's the ninth missionary murder in a month," said Clifford tersely;
  "and the soldiers in Honan are the best disciplined in China &mdash;which
  isn't saying much, I admit. But the soldiers were in this and had banners
  inscribed 'We welcome the Son of Heaven,' which means that there is a new
  pretender to the throne."</p>

  <p>Joe shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I never did hold with Chinamen being trusted with rifles," he said. "It
  demoralizes 'em, Cliff. You don't think we shall have any trouble on the
  Concession, do you?" he asked anxiously. "Because, if you do, I ought to be
  getting back."</p>

  <p>"You'll stay here," said Cliff ominously. "I don't think we shall have
  trouble in that part of China&mdash;we are paying the Governor too much for
  him to risk. But there are seventeen separate points in open rebellion in
  China." He opened a drawer, took out a map and unfolded it, and Joe saw that
  the chart was covered with little red crosses. "They call it 'unrest' in the
  newspapers," said Clifford quietly. "They give as the reason the failure of
  the rice crops and an earthquake hundreds of miles from any centre of
  trouble!"</p>

  <p>Old Joe struggled up to an erect position.</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?" he asked, looking at the other through narrowed lids.
  "First time I knew you took any interest in Chinese wars. You talk as if you
  knew all the risin's. What's the big idea? They can't effect us?"</p>

  <p>Lynne folded the map.</p>

  <p>"A big change of government would affect everything," he said. "Honan
  doesn't worry me, because it is a brigands' province; but there has been
  trouble in Yun Nan, and when Yun Nan starts hooting the trouble is far
  advanced. Somebody is working hard for a new dynasty&mdash;and all the flags
  are decorated with the symbol of the Joyful Hands."</p>

  <p>Old Joe's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"But that is a little affair," he said jerkily; "just a little fool
  society&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Eight provinces are strong for the Hands," interrupted Clifford. "And
  Fing-Su has a headquarters in each. He has double-crossed us from the
  start&mdash;using the money he has taken from the concessions to finance a
  trading company in opposition to us."</p>

  <p>"He never has!" Joe's voice was hollow with amazement.</p>

  <p>"Go up to the Tower and take a peek at Peking House&mdash;the London
  office of the trading company, and the Emperor Fing-Su's general
  headquarters!"</p>

  <p>Old Joe Bray could only shake his head.</p>

  <p>"Emperor... um! Same as Napoleon... gosh!"</p>

  <p>Lynne allowed that idea to soak.</p>

  <p>"In three months' time he will be wanting money&mdash;big money. At
  present he is financing divers generals, but he cannot go on indefinitely.
  His scheme is to form a national army under Spedwell, who knows China, and
  when he has done that and established himself on the throne, it will be easy
  to deal with the three big generals who are in his pay at the moment. How
  this Emperor bug got into his brain, heaven knows!"</p>

  <p>Mr Bray stirred uneasily; something in his attitude arrested his partner's
  attention.</p>

  <p>"It was you! Oh, you wicked old man!" he breathed, in wonder.</p>

  <p>"I certainly gave him ideas," admitted Joe, who was thoroughly
  uncomfortable. "I sort of made up yarns to stimmerlate his ambition
  &mdash;that's the word, ain't it? I've got a wonderful imagination, Cliff.
  I'd have written novels if I could have only spelt."</p>

  <p>"And I suppose," said Clifford, "you drew a picture of what China would be
  like under one head?"</p>

  <p>"Something like that." Joe Bray dared not meet his partner's eyes. "But it
  was to stimmerlate his ambition, if you understand, Cliff. Just sort of push
  him on."</p>

  <p>Clifford was laughing softly, and he very seldom laughed. "Maybe he didn't
  want any 'stimmerlating'," he said. "Fing-Su is the one in a million that is
  bound to turn up at odd intervals through the ages. Napoleon was one, Rhodes
  was one, Lincoln was one&mdash;there aren't such a lot of 'em."</p>

  <p>"What about George Washington?" asked Mr Bray, only too anxious to switch
  the conversation into historical channels.</p>

  <p>"Whoever is responsible, the mischief is done." Cliff looked at his watch.
  "Did you ever go bird's-nesting, Joe?"</p>

  <p>"As a boy," said Joe complacently, "there was few that could beat me."</p>

  <p>"We'll go along tonight and inspect a floating nest of the domestic
  yellowbill," said Cliff.</p>

     id="ch22">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr Narth went up to town by train, his car for the moment
  being in the grip of one of those mysterious ailments to which cars are
  addicted. On the station platform he bought a newspaper, though he was not
  attracted thereto by a contents bill: 'Joyful Hands' Behind Chinese Trouble.
  What the 'Joyful Hands' meant Mr Narth did not trouble to think. The name
  seemed a little incongruous.</p>

  <p>He was quite ignorant on the subject of China, except that fabulous sums
  had been made in that country by one who had conveniently died and passed on
  his fortune to Mr Narth.</p>

  <p>It was his pride and boast that he was a business man, which meant that he
  was proud of his ignorance on all subjects apart from his business. Outside
  interests he had none; he played a passable game of golf &mdash;it was that
  accomplishment which had lured him to Sunningdale &mdash;he was an
  indifferent devotee of bridge, and his adventurous period of life was
  represented by the indiscreet maintenance of a Bloomsbury flat in the late
  'nineties.</p>

  <p>Frankly, he was dishonest; he admitted as much to himself. He had a
  passionate desire for easy money, and when he had inherited his father's
  business it had seemed that he was in a fair way to the realization of his
  ideals. He had then discovered that money only flowed into even the
  oldest-established businesses if the passages and chutes were kept clear of
  rubbish. You had either to butter them with advertising, or polish them with
  that homely commodity which is known as elbow-grease. If you were content to
  sit in an office chair and wait for money, it had an uncomfortable knack of
  losing its way and dropping into the coffers of your competitors. He had so
  far acquainted himself with the incidence of commercial machinery that he had
  found many short cuts to wealth. The discovery that most of these enticing
  by-ways led into all sorts of morasses and muddy footholes came later.
  Greatest of all his misfortunes, as it proved, he was, in spite of his
  frequent stringencies, on the best of terms with the heads of great financial
  houses, for his judgment, apart from his own operations, was wellnigh
  faultless.</p>

  <p>From Waterloo Station he drove to the hotel where he usually stayed when
  he was in town, and the hotel valet took charge of his dress suit in
  preparation for the ceremony of the following night. Fing-Su had rather
  amused him by his insistence upon his matter of costume.</p>

  <p>"A tail coat and a white tie, the grand habit," he said. "The initiation
  will interest you&mdash;it combines some of the more modern ceremonies with
  one as ancient as life."</p>

  <p>He ordered tea to be sent to his room, and it had hardly been served
  before Major Spedwell appeared. He greeted his new associate with the
  question:</p>

  <p>"What happened last night?"</p>

  <p>Stephen Narth shook his head with a show of irritation.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It was a monstrous scheme of Fing-Su's. I&mdash;I nearly
  chucked the whole thing."</p>

  <p>"Did you?" The Major sank into the only armchair in the room. "Well, I
  shouldn't take that too seriously if I were you. No harm was intended to the
  girl. Fing-Su was very considerate; she was being taken to a place where she
  would have had white women to look after her, everything that heart could
  desire."</p>

  <p>"Then why on earth&mdash;?" began Narth.</p>

  <p>Spedwell made a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"He has a reason. He wanted to put a lever under Mr Clifford Lynne."</p>

  <p>He got up from his chair, walked to the fireplace and knocked off the ash
  of his cigar.</p>

  <p>"There's money for you in this, Narth," he said, "and only one thing
  required of you&mdash;and that's loyalty. Fing-Su thinks you're a man who
  will be very useful to him." He looked at the other oddly. "You might even
  take Leggat's place," he said.</p>

  <p>Stephen Narth looked up quickly.</p>

  <p>"Leggat? I thought he was a great friend of yours."</p>

  <p>"He is and he isn't," said Spedwell carefully. "Fing-Su thinks
  &mdash;well, there have been leakages. Things had got out, and unfortunately
  got into the wrong quarters." And then, abruptly: "Lynne is in town. I
  suppose you know that?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not interested in his movements," said Mr Narth with some
  acerbity.</p>

  <p>"I thought you might be," said the other carelessly.</p>

  <p>He could have added that he himself was more interested in Clifford
  Lynne's plans than that erratic man could be possibly aware. And there was a
  reason for his interest: Fing-Su had found a new plan&mdash;one so
  ingeniously arranged that only one man could save Joan Bray, and that was the
  quick-shooting man from Siangtan.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Clifford came to his Mayfair dwelling in time for a hasty
  lunch, and he came alone. He had left strict injunctions with Joe Bray to
  keep himself hidden, a very necessary precaution, for Joe was essentially an
  open-air man who chafed at confinement. His first act on arrival was to call
  a Mayfair number.</p>

  <p>"Mr Leggat is not in," was the reply, and Clifford cursed the affable
  traitor who had promised to be available from one o'clock onwards.</p>

  <p>He had further reason for annoyance when at two o'clock Mr Leggat called
  openly at the house. Ferdinand Leggat was a lover of good things, but as a
  rule he reserved his conviviality for the hours which followed dinner. Cliff
  took one glance at the man as he swaggered into the dining-room and rightly
  interpreted the red face and the fatuous smile.</p>

  <p>"You're a madman, Leggat," he said quietly, as he walked to the door and
  closed it. "Why do you come here in daylight?"</p>

  <p>Leggat had reached the point of exhilaration when he alone stood out
  clearly from a blurred world.</p>

  <p>"Because I prefer daylight," he said a little thickly. "Why should I, a
  man of my qualities, sneak around in the dark? That for Fing-Su and all his
  myrmidons!" He snapped his finger contemptuously and broke into a guffaw of
  laughters but Clifford Lynne was not amused.</p>

  <p>"You're a fool," he said again. "I asked you to be on hand so that I might
  telephone you. Don't underrate Fing-Su, my friend."</p>

  <p>"Bah!" said the other as he walked, uninvited, to the buffet and helped
  himself liberally from the tantalus. "There was never a giddy Oriental who
  could scare me! You seem to forget that I've lived in China, Lynne. And as to
  the secret society&mdash;" He threw back his head and laughed again. "My dear
  old man," he said as he walked unsteadily back to the table, a large
  tumblerful of amber liquor in his hand, "if there is a fool here, it's you!
  I've given you enough information to hang Fing-Su. You're a rich man, you can
  afford to hand the thing over to the police, and sit down comfortably and
  await developments."</p>

  <p>Clifford did not explain that he had already been in touch with the
  Colonial and Foreign Offices, and had been met with a polite sceptism which
  had at once irritated and silenced him. The Foreign Office knew that the
  Peckham factory stored field guns. They had been bought in the open market,
  he was blandly told, and there was no mystery about them at all. They could
  not be exported without a licence, and there was no reason in the world why a
  Chinese trading company should not have the same privileges as a white. To
  all this and more he had listened with growing impatience.</p>

  <p>"I'm through with Fing-Su," said Leggat. "He is not only a Chink but a
  mean Chink. And after all I've done for him! Did you arrange for the
  <i>Umgeni</i> to be searched, as I suggested?"</p>

  <p>Clifford nodded. He had succeeded so far that he had induced the Port of
  London Authority to take action, and the <i>Umgeni</i> had been searched
  systematically, her cargo had been hauled from the hold and broached, but
  nothing had been found save the conventional articles of commerce, cases of
  spades, reapers, cooking pots and the usual stock of the trader.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Leggat was surprised. "I know they've been loading her for
  weeks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She sails tonight," said Clifford, "and not even Fing-Su can unload her
  cargo and replace it."</p>

  <p>His guest gulped down the contents of the tumbler and exhaled a deep
  breath.</p>

  <p>"I'm through with him," he repeated. "I thought he was the original duck
  that laid golden eggs <i>ad infinitum</i>."</p>

  <p>"In other words, you've exploited him as far as you can, eh?" asked
  Clifford, with a faint smile. "And now you're ready to sell the carcass! What
  part is Spedwell playing?"</p>

  <p>Leggat shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I never liked Spedwell very much," he said. "These military Johnnies get
  my goat. He's Fing-Su's chief of staff&mdash;spends all his time with maps
  and plans and drill-books. He and Fing-Su have just finished writing a
  Chinese manual."</p>

  <p>"A rifle manual?" asked Clifford quickly.</p>

  <p>"Something like that," said the other with a shrug.</p>

  <p>Clifford raised his hand in warning as there came a gentle knock at the
  door and his servant entered.</p>

  <p>"I forgot to tell you, sir," he said, "the Post Office workmen came this
  morning to fix your telephone."</p>

  <p>"Fix&mdash;what do you mean, fix?" asked Lynne, a frown gathering on his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"They said there had been some complaints about the instrument &mdash;the
  exchange couldn't hear you very distinctly."</p>

  <p>Lynne was silent and thoughtful for a second.</p>

  <p>"Were you here whilst the repairs were being done?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sir," smiled the man. "They had a Post Office card of authority,
  but I'm too old a bird to take a risk&mdash;I was with them all the time
  whilst they fixed the amplifier."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Clifford blankly. And then: "Where did they put this
  'amplifier'?"</p>

  <p>One wall of the dining-room was hidden by a large bookshelf, and it was
  beneath this that the telephone flex ran. The butler stooped and pointed: in
  the shallow space beneath the last shelf was a black wooden box about ten
  inches long and four inches in height. In its face were two round apertures,
  and attached to these was a thin wire which ran up the end wall and vanished
  through a newly-drilled hole in the window-sill.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Leggat, suddenly sobered.</p>

  <p>"A microphone," replied Clifford curtly. "Somebody's been listening to
  every word of our conversation!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Clifford Lynne opened the window and looked out. The wire
  had been roughly tacked along the wall which divided his from the next
  courtyard, and vanished over the roof of the garage into the mews.</p>

  <p>"All right, Simmons," he said, and without a word went from the room and
  out through the mews into the garage. For a time he could not see the fine
  wire, but after a search he discovered it running along the wall, and he
  traced its course almost to the end of the mews, where it turned up through
  the open window of what was obviously a chauffeur's flat.</p>

  <p>One glance at the window told him that the apartment was not in regular
  occupation. The panes were grimy; one was broken; and he remembered that
  farther along the street in which he lived was an empty house; the garage was
  evidently an appendage to this.</p>

  <p>There was a gate which led to the car store and a small door obviously
  giving to the upstairs flat, and this was ajar. Without hesitation he pushed
  it open and mounted the steep, untidy stairs to the apartments above. There
  were two rooms, empty save for the debris which the last occupant had left
  behind him. The back room was used as a sleeping apartment; an old iron
  bedstead, innocent of bedding, remained. He turned into the front room, and
  here he found what he had expected: a replica of the small black box beneath
  the bookshelf, and a telephone, which was, he discovered, in working order
  when he called exchange.</p>

  <p>The room had no occupant, and for a very good reason. The man who had been
  listening-in through this microphone, and who had been transmitting the
  conversation he had overheard to Fing-Su, had had ample warning. He had, in
  fact, left the mews almost at the identical moment that Clifford had come
  into it.</p>

  <p>"A dark, military-looking man with a bad-tempered face." A chauffeur who
  had seen him was responsible for a description which identified Major
  Spedwell.</p>

  <p>Clifford Lynne went back to his dining-room and found a greatly troubled
  Leggat splashing whisky into a glass with an unsteady hand.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble? What is it all about?" asked the stout man
  fearfully.</p>

  <p>Although it seemed to be a waste of time attempting to make this boaster
  realize his peril, Lynne told him what he had discovered.</p>

  <p>"And you need to be very careful, Leggat!" he said. "If Fing-Su knows you
  have betrayed him I wouldn't give a string of native beads for your life. The
  only chance is that the listener failed to recognize your voice."</p>

  <p>It was not until later that he discovered who was the eavesdropper, and
  then it was clear that the chance of Major Spedwell being ignorant of
  Leggat's identity was a very remote one.</p>

  <p>"Fing-Su&mdash;bah!"</p>

  <p>There was, however, a note of uneasiness in the deep laughter of Ferdinand
  Leggat. He had been in unpleasant situations and had been threatened before,
  facing frenzied shareholders who had clamoured for his blood. Yet&mdash;the
  Chinaman was different somehow.</p>

  <p>"My dear good fellow, you're theatrical! Let Fing-Su start something,
  that's all!"</p>

  <p>"When are you seeing him again?" asked Lynne.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow night," was the reply. "There is a meeting of the Lodge
  &mdash;damn' tomfoolery, I call it! But I suppose one ought to turn up, if it
  is' only to humour the silly devil!"</p>

  <p>Lynne was regarding him with unusual gravity. He, of all men, understood
  the mentality of the Chinaman, and could see all the potentialities for
  mischief that vast wealth had given to him.</p>

  <p>"If you take my advice, Leggat, you'll be among the missing tomorrow
  night," he said. "Get out of England until I've broken up this gang. Take a
  trip to Canada; there's a boat leaving tomorrow, and if you hurry you can get
  your ticket and passport fixed."</p>

  <p>Leggat set down his glass on the table with a bang.</p>

  <p>"<i>J'y suis, j'y reste</i>" he said valiantly. "There never was a coolie
  that could run me out of England, and don't you forget it, Lynne! I can
  handle this bird...!"</p>

  <p>Clifford Lynne listened without listening, his mind too occupied with the
  possible consequences which would follow his discovery of the spy-wire to pay
  much attention to the boastings of his companion. With a final warning he
  dismissed Leggat, sending him back through the garage by his private taxi. It
  was then that he went out into the mews, to make a few inquiries, and,
  discovering that the listener was undoubtedly Major Spedwell, he made an
  effort to get in touch with Leggat, but without success.</p>

  <p>The man's danger was a very real one; how far would Fing-Su go? A long
  way, to judge by what had already happened. He drew entirely different
  conclusions from those which Leggat had drawn from the Joyful Hands. The
  Lodge meetings might, from the European standpoint, be ridiculous, but they
  had a deadly significance too.</p>

  <p>That afternoon Clifford interviewed a high authority at Scotland Yard, and
  he went to that most austere of public departments with a letter of
  introduction from the Foreign Secretary. The interview had been a longer one
  than he had anticipated, but its first result was to relieve him of his
  greatest worry. He drove straight from the Yard to Sunningdale, and if he had
  any perturbation at all it was on account of Mr Ferdinand Leggat. The cottage
  door was locked and he found Joe curled up on the sofa asleep, and Mr Bray
  awoke in a spirit of revolt. When Joe Bray began to protest in advance
  against the folly of shutting himself up like a prisoner, Clifford had a
  shrewd idea that he was justifying in advance a departure from the strict
  letter of his instructions.</p>

  <p>"It's bad for me health and it gets on me mind," said Joe loudly, keeping
  a guilty eye fixed upon the partner of whom he stood in no little awe.</p>

  <p>"You've been out!" accused Clifford.</p>

  <p>There was really not much harm done if he had been. Nobody in Sunningdale
  knew Joe and, with the exception of Fing-Su, it was doubtful if there was a
  person in England who would recognize him.</p>

  <p>"I went out to pick a few flowers," explained Joe. "There is something
  about flowers, Cliff, that brings a lump into my throat. You can sniff!
  You're naturally hard. But to see all them bluebells&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's too late for bluebells; you probably mean dandelions," said Cliff
  coldly, "or more likely turnips!"</p>

  <p>"Bluebells," insisted Mr Bray with a vigorous nodding of his head. "And
  nestling under, as it were, the trees. And, Cliff"&mdash;he coughed &mdash;"I
  met the dandiest young lady you've ever seen!"</p>

  <p>Clifford looked at him aghast. Mr Joseph Bray was blushing violently. Was
  this the iron-souled prospector, the man who had won through from poverty to
  affluence by a grim disregard of most of the laws that govern Chinese lands
  and customs? He could only wonder and remain speechless.</p>

  <p>"There's no reason why I shouldn't have met her," said Joe defiantly. "I'm
  not old&mdash;not much more than fifty." He flung the challenge at Cliff's
  head, but it was not taken up. "There's a lot of people that don't believe I
  am fifty."</p>

  <p>"You're a hundred in sin and ten in wisdom," said Clifford, smiling
  good-humouredly. "Who was she, Joe?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. A well-made, nice-looking girl. A bit redheaded, but that
  shows spirit. What a girl!" He waggled his head ecstatically.</p>

  <p>"Well-made&mdash;do you mean fat?" asked Clifford brutally.</p>

  <p>"Well-made," evaded the other, "and young. She couldn't be more than
  twenty-five. And a wonderful complexion, Cliff. Roses!"</p>

  <p>"Rather red?" asked his unromantic companion, and chuckled. "Did you ask
  her her name?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't!" Joe Bray was on his mettle. "It is not good manners askin'
  people their name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you had, she would have answered 'Mabel Narth.'"</p>

  <p>The older man's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"Mabel Narth?" he asked in a hollow whisper. "What, my own niece!"</p>

  <p>"She is no more your niece than I am your uncle," said Clifford. "The
  tables of consanguinity do not apply. She's your twenty-third cousin nineteen
  times removed. She is such a distant cousin that you'll find it difficult to
  see her relationship through an ordinary telescope. But, Joe, at your time of
  life!"</p>

  <p>"Fifty," murmured Joe. "Men of my age are more steady than you young
  ones."</p>

  <p>"I presume you did not tell her who you were?"</p>

  <p>"No; I merely hinted that I'd got a bit of stuff put by!"</p>

  <p>"That you were rich, in fact? Did her eyes light up?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded Joe, on the defensive.</p>

  <p>"You're a queer devil," said Clifford. "How is that coolie boy?"</p>

  <p>"Almost well. He has been praying all day to be let out, but I didn't want
  to let him go before you came."</p>

  <p>"He can skip tonight&mdash;he makes me feel homesick for a bamboo rod and
  the floor of the Yamen! I suppose you know his job was to stifle us? This
  morning I found the bag of sulphur he was trying to put down the
  chimney."</p>

  <p>Clifford strolled out to the locked scullery to interview the crestfallen
  warrior. He did not look very warlike as he sat there with an old blanket
  round his shoulders. Lynne examined his wound and in a few words dismissed
  him, and to his surprise the man showed every evidence of relief.</p>

  <p>"Let me go before the sun goes down," he begged, "for I am a stranger in
  this country, and it is hard for such a man as I to find my way to the great
  town."</p>

  <p>Something in his manner aroused Clifford's suspicion, and he remembered
  Joe's words.</p>

  <p>"Man, you are anxious to leave my house," he said. "Tell me why."</p>

  <p>The man dropped his eyes sullenly.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid."</p>

  <p>Still the native did not look up.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid of death&mdash;tonight!"</p>

  <p>This time his shaft got home, and the Chinaman jerked up his head,
  blinking at his interrogator with frightened eyes.</p>

  <p>"They say of you that you are a devil and read the hearts of men. Now what
  you say"&mdash;there was a certain desperation in his tone &mdash;"is very
  true, for I fear death if I stay in this house tonight."</p>

  <p>Clifford whistled softly.</p>

  <p>"At what hour would you die, man?"</p>

  <p>"At the second hour after moonrise," replied the coolie without
  hesitation, and Clifford nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think you can go," he said, and gave him directions as to how he could
  travel to London.</p>

  <p>Returning to Joe, he repeated the gist of the conversation.</p>

  <p>"The grand attack comes tonight. Now what are we to do? 'Phone into
  Aldershot for half a battalion, cover ourselves with ignominy, notify the
  local police and be responsible for the death of these respectable,
  middle-aged men; or shall we stand the racket ourselves and have a nice,
  quiet fight?"</p>

  <p>The humour of it overcame him, and he sat down laughing silently, his face
  red, tears in his eyes, and when Clifford Lynne laughed that way there was
  trouble coming for somebody.</p>

  <p>The Slaters' Cottage and Sunni Lodge were a mile out of Sunningdale and
  remarkably isolated, though they were a few hundred yards from the Portsmouth
  Road, which was never wholly deserted. Mr Narth's nearest neighbour was the
  Earl of Knowesly, who, however, was only in residence for a little over a
  month in the year, for he was a northerner who loved Lancashire and was
  happiest amongst his own people.</p>

  <p>Beyond the Slaters' Cottage in the other direction was the undeveloped
  property of a land company which was exploiting a new golf course and a
  residential estate.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea they're going to take a leaf out of my book, Joe. It will
  be a fight with silencers if Spedwell is in command, and I know now that he
  is the chief of military staff."</p>

  <p>The evening had turned close and oppressive, and the sun set behind
  towering masses of cloud. Clifford Lynne employed the last hours of light in
  paying a visit to Sunni Lodge. He did not go to the house; in the
  circumstances he thought that Stephen Narth would not be particularly anxious
  to see him. Instead, he made an unauthorized circuit of the pleasure ground,
  having caught a glimpse of the girl walking at the far end of the tennis
  lawn.</p>

  <p>Briefly he told her the arrangements he had made for her protection.</p>

  <p>"The crisis will be over in a week, I think. I have mildly interested the
  Foreign Office, and thank heaven I have got Scotland Yard thoroughly worked
  up!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head helplessly.</p>

  <p>"I only understand dimly what is the cause of all this trouble," she said.
  "It is about the share which Fing-Su wants, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Why is that so very important? Mr Narth tried to explain but I am as
  dense as ever."</p>

  <p>They were pacing through a thin belt of pines that fringed the western
  boundary of Mr Narth's little demesne, and were free from the possibility of
  observation from the house. In a few words he told her of the forty-nine
  shares.</p>

  <p>"I had always realized the possibility of Joe's doing something eccentric
  with his money, and the founders' shares, as we call them &mdash;though in
  reality it would be better to call them the management shares&mdash;were
  issued to keep the control of the business, whatever happened. The original
  plan was that I was to have twenty-five and Joe was to take twenty-four, and
  an agreement was drawn up by which it was mutually agreed that the survivor
  should inherit the shares of the other partner. I had to go to Peking on
  business; whilst I was there I got a wire from Joe asking if I minded the old
  man Fing-Su having a few shares. Unfortunately, before I left Siantan I had
  given Joe a general power of attorney, and I returned to discover that this
  wicked old man had not only given the chief nine, but he had divided the
  other forty equally."</p>

  <p>She nodded, at last understanding.</p>

  <p>"But surely, Mr&mdash;Clifford, that trouble is over? You have the
  majority of the shares and you need not sell or give away the one which makes
  all the difference?"</p>

  <p>Clifford smiled wryly.</p>

  <p>"Joe, with the greatest ingenuity, maintained the clause which provided
  that if either of us died his shares should go to the survivor," he said
  significantly. "Fing-Su has a double chance. He may induce me, by methods
  which I have anticipated, to part with the share which gives him control of
  the company; or he may&mdash;" He did not conclude the sentence.</p>

  <p>"He may bring about your death," she said simply, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>"He has reached the point now," he went on, "where he cannot succeed,
  because, if I were to be killed this night, Fing-Su would be automatically
  arrested tomorrow. But, clever as he is, he is a Chinaman and reasons like a
  Chinaman. That is why he will fall down. He has great visions toned with a
  sense of infallibility&mdash;he cannot imagine failure."</p>

  <p>They paced in silence for fully a minute, and then she asked:</p>

  <p>"If he managed to get me... in his power&mdash;that sounds awfully
  melodramatic, doesn't it?&mdash;what difference would that
  make&mdash;really?"</p>

  <p>"I should pay," he said quietly, "and he knows I should pay."</p>

  <p>She felt the blood come into her cheeks and tried to appear
  unconcerned.</p>

  <p>"You are under no obligation to me, Mr Lynne," she said, in a low voice.
  "I had already decided to tell you... now that Mr Bray is alive... that I do
  not wish to marry you. I promised Mr Narth because&mdash;well, it was
  necessary for him that I should be married."</p>

  <p>It required a great effort for her to say this, a greater effort than she
  had ever dreamt. The discovery struck her with a sense of dismay. To rehearse
  such a speech in the privacy of her room was an easy matter, but now as she
  spoke, it was as if every word cut away from her the newly built foundations
  of life. She looked up at him; he was searching her face.</p>

  <p>"And there is no need&mdash;for you to marry, either."</p>

  <p>She shook her head in anticipation of his answer.</p>

  <p>"'To carry on the line'&mdash;no," he said, and her heart sank. "To
  satisfy the curious mind of Joseph Bray, Esquire&mdash;no! Not one of the
  arguments remains which brought me on this mad trip to England and turned me
  from a decent member of society into a bearded hobo! You're right there. But
  there is yet a very excellent reason why I should marry you."</p>

  <p>He put his arm round her gently, and drew her towards him, and yet he did
  not kiss her. His grave eyes were looking into hers, and she read the words
  he did not say, the thought he did not utter, and found she was trembling
  from head to foot. A deep rumble of thunder came from the distance and that
  broke the spell. With a sigh he stepped back, dropped his hands on her
  shoulders and held her at arms' length.</p>

  <p>"There will be a marriage in this family on Friday," he said briefly, and
  only then did he stoop and kiss her.</p>

  <p>The first ghostly gleam of lightning paled the pine tops as he came
  whistling down the drive to the Slaters' Cottage.</p>

  <p>"A night of storm, Joseph?" he said cheerfully, as he came into the
  sitting-room. "Have you turned loose the hired assassin?"</p>

  <p>Joe hastily concealed the paper he had been writing.</p>

  <p>"Making a new will?"</p>

  <p>Mr Bray coughed, and a horrible suspicion came to his partner; a suspicion
  that amounted to a certainty.</p>

  <p>Once, many years before, Joe, with great humming and hawing, had confessed
  a gentle weakness and had even offered for his criticism an exercise-book
  stained with his fancy.</p>

  <p>"You're not writing poetry, are you, Joe?" he asked in a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not," said Joe loudly. "Gosh! That was a good one!"</p>

  <p>The crash of thunder overhead set the little cottage shivering, and even
  as he spoke the blue flicker of lightning hit the woods.</p>

  <p>"The very heavens are aflame," said Joe poetically.</p>

  <p>"It is your turn to fry the sausages," retorted his more practical friend,
  and they adjourned to the little kitchen together to prepare the evening
  meal.</p>

  <p>The storm lasted an hour, but it was evident that what they had
  experienced was merely the forerunner. By nine o'clock it was black as a
  winter night, and every horizon was lit with distant lightning. Clifford had
  fastened the shutters, and four sporting rifles were at hand on the sofa.</p>

  <p>"Reminds me of one of them storms you get up there on the lake," said Joe,
  "and the worst I was ever in was up in Harbin in '86&mdash;before any of you
  birds had poked your nose outside the reservations."</p>

  <p>He looked at the writing table where he had been engaged in his literary
  labours and sighed heavily.</p>

  <p>"As far as I can make out, she is a third cousin," said Joe. "Her father's
  sister married my aunt's son."</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you talking about?" asked Clifford in
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Her," said Mr Bray briefly.</p>

  <p>It was evident that Mabel had made a very deep impression upon this
  susceptible heart.</p>

  <p>"I hope this storm won't frighten her&mdash;girls get scared with
  storms..."</p>

  <p>"For my part, I would rather have it tonight than tomorrow," said Clifford
  as he made for the kitchen. "If we are to be drowned, I would rather be
  drowned by moonlight!"</p>

  <p>Joe Bray came after him to the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"What's this stuff about getting drowned?" he asked nervously. "Where are
  we going?"</p>

  <p>"Down to the sea in a ship," said Clifford as he speared a sausage from
  the pantry slab.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Miss Mabel Narth was not the kind of girl to be frightened
  by a thunderstorm. Whilst her more sensitive sister cowered in the
  coal-cellar, Mabel knitted furiously in the drawing-room, confiding to her
  companion the curious adventure of the morning.</p>

  <p>"Some people would say he was old, but I would call him a fine figure of a
  man, and he is enormously rich, my dear."</p>

  <p>Mabel professed to be twenty-five. She was plump, and not especially
  popular with the bright young men who danced with her, played tennis with
  her, sometimes dined with her, but studiously refrained from asking her the
  all-important question. In her life she had had two proposals: one from an
  impossible young gentleman to whom she had been introduced at a dance, and
  who subsequently proved to be an actor who played very small parts in very
  important West End musical comedies, and the other from a business associate
  of her father's who was still in mourning for his second wife when he made a
  timid bid for a third.</p>

  <p>"I like men who have sown their wild oats, Joan," said Mabel firmly,
  blinking rapidly as a vivid flash of lightning momentarily blinded her. "Will
  you pull the curtains, my dear?"</p>

  <p>Joan had never known her so affable, and was curious to discover the
  identity of the stranger who had made so deep an impression.</p>

  <p>"Young men you can never trust; they're so thoughtless. But a mature
  man... and fearfully rich! He told me he tried to buy up Lord Knowesley's
  estate. He is negotiating for a house in Park Lane, and he has three Rolls
  cars, my dear&mdash;just think of it, three!"</p>

  <p>"But who is he Mabel?"</p>

  <p>Here Mabel was at a loss, for in her maidenly modesty she had not pried
  too closely into the identity of her pleasant acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"He is living somewhere in the neighbourhood. I think he must have rented
  a house at Sunningdale."</p>

  <p>"How old is he?"</p>

  <p>Mabel considered.</p>

  <p>"About fifty," she said, unconsciously giving support to Mr Bray's
  miscalculation. "Bless this storm!" She did not mean 'bless'! "Do, please,
  run down into the cellar, Joan, and see if that foolish child is all
  right."</p>

  <p>Joan found the 'foolish child' sitting in a basket chair with a newspaper
  over her head, and Letty refused either to be sensible or to change her
  habitation.</p>

  <p>When she got back to the drawing-room Mabel greeted her with a staggering
  question.</p>

  <p>"Has that awful boy of yours got a visitor?"</p>

  <p>For a second Joan did not understand her. She had never thought of
  Clifford Lynne in these terms.</p>

  <p>"'Boy'? You mean Mr Lynne?"</p>

  <p>And then she gasped. Mabel had been talking about Joe Bray! She was too
  startled to laugh, and could only look open-mouthed at the plump girl.
  Happily, the eldest daughter of Stephen Narth, intent on her knitting, did
  not observe the sensation she had caused.</p>

  <p>"I wondered, because he walked off in the direction of the Slaters'
  Cottage. It struck me afterwards that it was quite possible he was staying
  with this Lynne man, who is rich, I suppose, and must have a lot of rich
  friends."</p>

  <p>Joan did not venture an answer. She could not tell the girl who was her
  newly-discovered interest without betraying Clifford, but she wondered what
  would be Mabel's attitude if she knew the truth.</p>

  <p>It was nearly ten o'clock and Mr Narth had not yet returned from town,
  when they heard a gentle tap at the door. The storm had subsided, though the
  thunder was still growling, and Joan went out, to find a rain-spotted
  envelope in the wire letter-box. It was addressed to 'Miss Mabel,' and she
  carried her find back to the girl. Mabel seized the letter, tore open the
  envelope and extracted a large and considerably blotted sheet of paper. She
  read and her eyes sparkled.</p>

  <p>"Poetry, Joan!" she said breathlessly.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"How strange is life! We come and go,<br>
  And the nicest people we do not know,<br>
  Until they dorn like the beautiful sun,<br>
  An experience which comes to everyone.<br>
  Even to a man of fifty-one."</p><br>

  <p>There was no signature. Mabel's eyes were gleaming.</p>

  <p>"How perfectly terribly romantic!" she exclaimed. "He must have dropped it
  in the letterbox with his own hand."</p>

  <p>She sprang up from her chair, went into the hall and opened the door. It
  was very dark, but she thought she saw a figure moving down the drive. The
  rain had ceased. Should she run after him? Would it be a ladylike action, she
  wondered? Would it not indeed come within the category of 'chasing,'
  literally and figuratively? The excuse was ready made for an excursion down
  the drive, for at this hour Joan usually went out with the
  letters&mdash;there was a postal box just outside the gate.</p>

  <p>Hesitating no more, she walked quickly down the path, her heart beating
  pleasurably. Turning the elbow of the little road, she stopped. Nobody was in
  sight; she must have been mistaken.</p>

  <p>And then there came to her an eerie sensation of fear that made her flesh
  go cold. She turned to run, and had taken two steps when a fusty blanket was
  suddenly thrown over her head, a big hand stifled her screams, and she
  fainted...</p>

  <p>Joan waited in the drawing-room until the slamming of the door brought her
  into the hall. The wind had blown the door close, and she opened it wide and
  peered out into the storm.</p>

  <p>Two successive flashes of lightning showed her that the drive was
  empty.</p>

  <p>"Mabel!"</p>

  <p>She called the girl at the top of her voice, but no answer came.</p>

  <p>Joan's heart sank.</p>

  <p>She ran back to the drawing-room and rang the bell for the butler; he was
  a slow-moving man, and as she waited patiently for his coming she remembered
  the black 'plum' that Clifford had given to her. It was a weapon of some
  kind, and she flew up the stairs and was back by the time the servant had
  arrived.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mabel gone out? She'll come back, miss."</p>

  <p>He glanced nervously at the open door. The lightning came in fluttering
  spasms.</p>

  <p>"No, miss, I'm sorry&mdash;I don't like lightning."</p>

  <p>"Come with me," commanded the girl, and ran out of the house; but she went
  alone. The butler went as far as the front door, and felt that he was not
  called upon by the laws which govern butlers to go any farther.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Lynne was sitting in the doorway of the cottage, a rifle
  across his knees, when Joe came back, the rays of his lamp advertising his
  presence long before he himself was in sight.</p>

  <p>"Where the dickens have you been?" asked Clifford in astonishment. "I
  thought you were asleep!"</p>

  <p>"Just went for a stroll," said Joe airily. "I slipped out at the back
  door... there's nobody about."</p>

  <p>"Well, you can slip in at the front door," said Clifford severely. "In all
  probability the wood is full of Chinese cutthroats."</p>

  <p>"Ridic'lous!" murmured Joe as he passed.</p>

  <p>"It may be ridic'lous," Clifford called over his shoulder, "but anything
  more ridiculous than you lying in a Sunningdale wood with your aged throat
  cut, I can't imagine."</p>

  <p>"Fifty-one!" exploded Joe from the passage. "Everybody knows that!"</p>

  <p>It was not a moment when Clifford Lynne felt he could debate the question
  of Mr Bray's age with any great profit. In the course of the evening he had
  made several excursions into the wood and had found nothing of a suspicious
  character. The cottage could be approached from the south by way of a new
  road that had been cut through the estate company's property, and to guard
  against surprise from this direction he had suspended, on a blackened string,
  a number of little bells that he had bought in London that day, though the
  never-ending grumble and crack of the thunder made it extremely doubtful
  whether this warning would reach him. The lightning played vividly in the sky
  as he sat on the doorstep, alert and waiting. Once Joe began to sing, and he
  silenced him with an angry growl.</p>

  <p>Eleven o'clock was striking when he heard a firm step on the gravel,
  coming from the direction of the road, and stood up,</p>

  <p>There was nothing furtive in the stranger's approach. He walked boldly
  down the centre of the road, and Clifford heard the tap of a stick. Whoever
  the newcomer was, he needed no light to show him the way, and after a while
  the watcher saw his shape distinctly. He turned from the road and came
  straight to the cottage, and now Lynne challenged him.</p>

  <p>"Have no fear. I am alone!"</p>

  <p>It was Fing-Su.</p>

  <p>"Stand where you are!" said Clifford harshly, "And since when have I been
  afraid of Chinese traders?"</p>

  <p>The newcomer had halted and Clifford heard him laugh. He smelt something,
  a penetrating aroma, pungent but not unpleasant.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," said Fing-Su politely. "I put that rather awkwardly, I am
  afraid. What I meant to convey was that I had called for a friendly talk. I
  understand that some of my hot-headed young men, quite without my knowledge,
  paid you a little attention last night. I have chastized them. Nobody knows
  better than you, Mr Lynne, that they are the veriest children. They thought I
  had been insulted&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" It was Joe Bray's voice, speaking from the living-room.</p>

  <p>Clifford turned savagely and silenced him. Had Fing-Su heard? And if he
  had, did he recognize the voice? Apparently he did not.</p>

  <p>"You have a friend staying with you? I think that is wise," he said in the
  same courteous tone. "As I was remarking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen! I'm not going to waste my time with that monkey stuff. Fing-Su,
  you're getting to the end of your rope."</p>

  <p>"It is a long rope," said Fing-Su, "and it covers a wide area. You are a
  fool, Lynne, not to throw in your lot with me. In five years I shall be the
  most powerful man in China."</p>

  <p>"You'll conquer China, will you?" asked the other sardonically. "And
  Europe, too, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Fing-Su. "You have no vision, my friend. Do you not see
  that with our preponderant man-strength all the wars of the future will be
  decided by our race? A professional yellow army will decide the fate of
  Europe. A great mercenary army&mdash;think of it, Lynne&mdash;to be bargained
  for and sold to the highest bidder. An army that sits everlastingly on the
  threshold of Europe!"</p>

  <p>"What do you want now?" asked Clifford brusquely.</p>

  <p>Fing-Su had a trick of conveying reproach by his very intonation, and now
  he replied in a hurt tone:</p>

  <p>"Is it necessary that we should be enemies, Mr Lynne? I have no feeling
  against you. All I wish is to buy from you at a reasonable price a founders'
  share in the company&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>The coolness of the request momentarily struck Clifford dumb. It aroused
  in him also a sudden feeling of apprehension. Fing-Su would not dare advance
  such an iniquitous request unless he had the wherewithal to bargain.</p>

  <p>"And what do you propose giving me in exchange?" he asked slowly, and
  heard the quick intake of the other's breath.</p>

  <p>"A thing very precious to you, Mr Lynne." He spoke deliberately. "You have
  a friend in your house and evidently he can hear, and I am not prepared to
  make a statement before a witness. Will you come a little way up the road
  with me?"</p>

  <p>"Walk ahead," said Clifford curtly, and, turning, Fing-Su went before
  him.</p>

  <p>Within a few yards of the main road the Chinaman stopped and turned.</p>

  <p>"There is a lady&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>Lynne's hand shot out and gripped him by his coat. Something hard pressed
  against the Chinaman's waistcoat.</p>

  <p>"You've got Joan Bray, have you?" demanded Cliff through his teeth.
  "You've got her! Is that what you're trying to say?"</p>

  <p>"There is no need for heroics&mdash;" began Fing-Su.</p>

  <p>"Tell me where she is."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry you take this view," said Fing-Su, regret in his voice, "and
  as you threaten me I have no course to follow but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He took off his hat as though to cool his heated head and looked into its
  interior.</p>

  <p>Suddenly from its crown, with a fierce hiss, came a thick spray of liquid
  that drenched Clifford's face.</p>

  <p>Pure ammonia, stifling, blinding...!</p>

  <p>In his agony his pistol fell with a clatter to the ground, and the
  Chinaman, with a quick thrust of his head, sent him sprawling. Kneeling by
  his side, Fing-Su thrust his hand into the inside of Clifford's waistcoat. He
  felt a crackle&mdash;a paper was sewn there.</p>

  <p>And then came a diversion; the sound of footsteps, flying down the
  road&mdash;a woman, he saw, with his keen eyes that could penetrate the
  blackest gloom of night. Instinct saved Joan Bray. As she turned into the
  lane she stopped suddenly, conscious of the huddled figure on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>At the sound of her voice Fing-Su leapt to his feet with a squeal of
  rage.</p>

  <p>"Miss Bray!"</p>

  <p>She recognized him, and for a moment was petrified with fright, then, as
  he leapt at her, she raised her hand in the desperation of terror and flung
  the thing she had been carrying. The black ball dropped short of Fing-Su, but
  fell on the ground at his feet.</p>

  <p>There was a dull explosion, and instantly the road, the wood, the very
  Slaters' Cottage, were illuminated by the light of the magnesium bomb. In a
  panic the Chinaman turned and plunged into the wood and a second later was
  lost to sight. On and on he ran blindly, until he came to a low hedge which
  separated him from the road. Near at hand a motor-car was drawn up by the
  side of the road, its lights dimmed. He stopped only long enough to lift out
  a stout and swooning girl and bundle her on to the roadside, and then the car
  sped furiously towards Egham.</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour later a search party went out to look for Mabel
  Narth, and it was Joe Bray who had the fortune to find her. And to comfort
  her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Fing-Su sat cross-legged on a divan in his over-furnished
  and over-scented office. The hour was four, and the roofs and steeples of
  East London showed black against the dawn.</p>

  <p>At such an hour do the great men of China grant their audiences, and
  Fing-Su, in his flowered silk robe, his silken trousers and white felt boots,
  wore upon his head the insignia of a rank to which he had no title.</p>

  <p>Between his lips was a long, thick-stemmed pipe with a microscopic bowl,
  but it was tobacco that he was smoking.</p>

  <p>A heavy-eyed little Chinese girl-woman sat on her heels in a corner of the
  room, watching him and ready to replenish the pipe or tea cup which stood at
  his elbow. Squatting at his feet was an unhealthy-looking Chinaman in
  European dress, his big derby hat deposited on the floor by his side.</p>

  <p>Fing-Su lifted the handleless tea cup from the low table by his side and
  drank noisily.</p>

  <p>"Of all men in this evil country I have sought out you, Li Fu," he said,
  setting down the cup. "I shall pay you well and there will be a great cumskaw
  in addition. Your name has been spoken to me because of your boldness and
  because you know this town so much better than I, who have spent all my years
  at college."</p>

  <p>He used the phrase which literally means 'Forest of Pencils.'</p>

  <p>If Li Fu felt any uneasiness, the inscrutable, pock-marked face did not
  show it.</p>

  <p>"There is a law in this country which is very hard on foreigners," he
  said. "By such a law I may be taken and put upon a ship and sent to China.
  Already I have spent three months in a prison where no man can speak to
  another. And, Fing-Su, in China I am a dead man, as you know, for Tuchun of
  Lanchow has sworn to hang my head in a basket over the gate of the city."</p>

  <p>Fing-Su smoked delicately, drawing at the tasteless tobacco and sending
  forth big blue rings of smoke to the scarlet-raftered ceiling.</p>

  <p>"All China is not Lanchow," he said, "and there will be changes. Who knows
  that you may not be Tuchun yourself some day? My friends will be well
  rewarded. There will be 'squeeze' for you, not 'cash' or copper or mex
  dollar, but gold. I know a place where there is a statue made of gold..."</p>

  <p>He spoke of Urga, that Mongolian Mecca, where shrines are of solid gold
  and there is a great golden figure of Buddha, and in the cellars of the
  living Buddha a treasure beyond computation.</p>

  <p>Li Fu listened apparently unmoved, his mind vacillating between the
  ungilded gates of Pentonville Prison and the reward he was offered. He was
  not a poor man as Chinamen went, but his compatriot had offered him an
  immediate fortune.</p>

  <p>"You have the felicity of owning a white wife," Fing-Su went on in his
  thin voice. "It would be a simple matter and none would know."</p>

  <p>Li Fu looked up.</p>

  <p>"Why do you come to me? For I am not a member of your tong. And you have
  hundreds of men who are like slaves to you!"</p>

  <p>Fing-Su tapped the ashes from his pipe, declined with a gesture its
  replenishment, and sat back in the silken cushions behind him.</p>

  <p>"The Sage has said, 'The slave must be ordered and the master will be
  served,'" he quoted. "I cannot stand behind each man and say 'Do this.' If I
  said, 'Li Fu has offended me, let him die,' you would be dead, because it is
  easy to take life. But in this other man I require wisdom and cunning or
  nothing will save my face."</p>

  <p>Li Fu considered the matter, twiddling his thumbs, his nimble mind busy.
  This was something more profitable than the smuggling of cocaine, his staple
  industry, a quicker way to fortune than the rake-off of coppers from a
  forbidden game of fantan. His wife, who was not exactly white but white
  enough, was very competent to play the part which his employer had assigned,
  had indeed already rented the premises which he had intended should mask a
  more nefarious trade than millinery.</p>

  <p>Fing-Su knew of that projected showroom in Fitzroy Square; he knew of Li
  Fu's connection, for the secrets of the little Chinese underworld came to him
  in the shape of gossip.</p>

  <p>"You will pay first," said Li Fu, and there followed a gentle but
  conventional wrangle, for no two Chinamen have ever struck a bargain on the
  first price offered.</p>

  <p>At the end Li Fu was dismissed.</p>

  <p>The man who entered from the little ante-room was not unused to being kept
  waiting by his employer, but the interview had lasted longer than he
  expected, and Major Spedwell was tired and not in the best of tempers.</p>

  <p>"Well, have you settled things?" he asked shortly.</p>

  <p>Fing-Su surveyed him through half-closed eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes; it was inevitable," he said.</p>

  <p>"You think you will get the girl without fuss? I don't." Spedwell sank
  down into a chair and lit a cigar. "You're monkeying with a big thing, and
  I'm not so sure that even now we're going to get through the next twelve
  hours without trouble," he said. "Lynne has pulled in Scotland
  Yard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Scotland Yard!" murmured the other with a derisive smile.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to grin about," snapped Spedwell. "These birds, when they
  move at all, move quickly. I've been shadowed all day."</p>

  <p>Fing-Su sat up suddenly.</p>

  <p>"You?"</p>

  <p>Spedwell nodded.</p>

  <p>"I thought that would interest you. And I'll tell you something else. Miss
  Bray is pretty certain to be shadowed. Leggat has spilt more than we
  know&mdash;what are you going to do about him?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>Fing-Su shrugged his silken shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Let him slide," he said indifferently.</p>

  <p>Spedwell chewed at the cigar, his eyes upon the whitening windows.</p>

  <p>"The Yard are up and doing," he said significantly. "That fellow Lynne
  captured&mdash;do you think he talked?"</p>

  <p>"Possibly." Impatience and weariness were in Fing-Su's voice. "At any
  rate, I have decided to deal with him in the manner you know. This country
  stifles me!" He rose and began walking up and down the room. "So many things
  would be simple&mdash;in China! Lynne&mdash;where would he be? A headless
  body carried out and left in the Gobi Desert&mdash;or, wearing a soldier's
  uniform, in some old moat. This woman interests me."</p>

  <p>He stopped and pulled at his thin lip.</p>

  <p>"Miss Bray?"</p>

  <p>"Yes... She is pretty, I suppose? Yes, pretty." He nodded. "I should like
  to see her in the dress of our women. And that would be terrible for Lynne.
  To know that somewhere in China&mdash;in an inaccessible place, with my
  armies between him and her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Spedwell rose slowly to his, feet, an ugly look on his face.</p>

  <p>"You can cut that little dream out of your repertoire, Fing-Su," he said
  coldly. "No harm must come to that girl&mdash;not that kind of harm."</p>

  <p>Fing-Su was smiling.</p>

  <p>"My dear Spedwell, how amusing! What queer values you English-speaking
  folk place on your women that you would jeopardize an immense fortune&mdash;I
  was joking. She is nothing to me. I would surrender all the women in the
  world rather than lose your help and friendship."</p>

  <p>But Spedwell's uneasiness was not so readily dispelled. He knew just when
  and why his services would be dispensed with, for the hour was near at hand
  when Fing-Su would make a clean cut of many of those trammelling influences
  which surrounded and hampered him. And, knowing, he was prepared.</p>

  <p>"How are things shaping in China?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The hour is near," said the Chinaman in a low voice. "The two armies have
  come to an agreement. Wei-pa-fu will move down from Harbin, Chi-sa-lo has
  concentrated within striking distance of Peking. It is purely a question of
  money. The guns have been landed&mdash;but I need not have sent them. Shells
  and equipment is all that Wei-pa-fu requires. If I could get control of the
  concession reserve it would be easy. But the generals want their
  'squeeze'&mdash;four millions would make me Emperor of China."</p>

  <p>Spedwell stroked his little black moustache thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"And how much would keep you Emperor?" he asked, but Fing-Su was
  unconcerned.</p>

  <p>"Once there, I shall be difficult to move," he said. "The granting of
  concessions to the Powers will identify them with my reign..."</p>

  <p>Spedwell listened and wondered at the calm confidence of this merchant's
  son who planned to buy a place on the throne which the Mings and the Manchus
  had won by their valour. And all the time he was speaking the world grew
  lighter and the grim outlines of the Conqueror's Tower, wherein so much
  ambition had died, rose into shape with the broadening of the day.</p>

  "And Mr Joseph says that no harm was intended me&mdash;these wretched people
  mistook me for Joan."</p>

  <p>"'Joseph'&mdash;is he Jewish?" asked Letty, curiosity overcoming
  alarm.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't look it," was the non-committal reply.</p>

  <p>It happened that Clifford did not see the girl either on her rescue or
  during the following morning. Only too well he knew that Mabel had been
  mistaken for her distant cousin, and he grew more and more uneasy. His first
  call on his arrival in town was at Scotland Yard, and here he received the
  gratifying intelligence that a number of officers had been detailed to watch
  Sunni Lodge.</p>

  <p>"You'll be wanting somebody to look after you!" said the officer with a
  smile when Clifford told him of the ammonia attack. "That ammonia spray in
  the hat is an old trick, by the way."</p>

  <p>Clifford nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm not proud of myself," he said.</p>

  <p>"As far as Miss Bray is concerned," said the superintendent, "I have
  already sent a man to Sunningdale with orders to follow her wherever she
  goes. He has just 'phoned me to say that the Narths' car is out of order and
  he will have no difficulty in keeping her under observation."</p>

  <p>"Thank the Lord for that!" said Cliff fervently, and went back to his
  house to arrange the details of the search he was making that night.</p>

  <p>At five o'clock that afternoon he telephoned through to the Slaters'
  Cottage. Joe Bray's voice answered him.</p>

  <p>"I've just been having a talk on the 'phone with Joan," said Joe. "Mark
  this, that girl's got brains! I asked her how old she thought I was, and what
  do you think she said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me," begged Clifford. "I'd hate to think she was insincere.
  Now listen: you're to be here at eleven o'clock. You'll have a visit from two
  or three men round about nine. They are Scotland Yard detectives and their
  job is to keep an eye on Sunni Lodge. As soon as they arrive, you
  skip&mdash;you understand?"</p>

  <p>"She said to me," continued Joe, a tremor of sentiment in his voice,
  "'Mabel seems to like you'&mdash;those were her very words&mdash;'she seems
  to like you.'"</p>

  <p>"She'll have no rival," said Clifford unpleasantly. "Did you hear what I
  said, you crazy old hen?"</p>

  <p>"I heard you," said Joe quite unruffled. "Listen, Cliff: she said
  &mdash;Joan, I mean&mdash;'I've never known Mabel to be so interested in
  anybody&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"At eleven o'clock," persisted Clifford.</p>

  <p>"At all times&mdash;that's what Joan said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And don't call up Joan Bray any more. One of the servants, or Narth, or,
  worse still, one of the daughters may discover who you are," said Clifford,
  "and then it will be a case of 'Goodbye, Mabel.'"</p>

  <p>"I'm not likely to call her up: she's gone to town. And listen, Cliff, she
  said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Gone to town?"</p>

  <p>The news startled the younger man, but before he could question his
  partner, Bray went on:</p>

  <p>"She's gone up to buy some dresses. That Narth ain't so bad, Cliff. Told
  her she could spend up to the limit. He's not a bad scout, old Stephen."</p>

  <p>Clifford hung up the receiver thoughtfully. Generosity and Stephen Narth
  were such complete strangers that his suspicions were aroused.</p>

  <p>When Joan Bray was ushered into her relative's private office she also was
  a little doubtful as to what condition might be attached to Stephen's
  largess. It was natural in her that she should wish to go to this strange
  husband that had been chosen for her with some material equipment. Even the
  beggar maid would not come empty-handed to Cophetua, but would spend her days
  gathering a poor and decent wardrobe to replace her rags. And Joan was
  singularly deficient in the matter of clothing. Mr Narth was not an
  extravagant man, and she had subsisted for three years on two evening frocks.
  A fine character should be superior to the mundane considerations of
  clothing, but when a fine mind has as its host a shapely body, it may be
  excused the lapse of a desire for suitable covering.</p>

  <p>Mr Stephen Narth was sitting at his desk with his head in his long hands,
  and he looked up with a start and stared at her as she entered the room. In a
  week an extraordinary change had come over him, she thought. He had grown
  haggard, nervous, ready to start at the slightest sound. He was a man who at
  the best of times was easily irritated, but now, as the click of the door
  announced her presence, she thought he had some difficulty in suppressing an
  exclamation of fear.</p>

  <p>"Oh! You! It is you, is it, Joan?" he said breathlessly. "Sit down, won't
  you?"</p>

  <p>He unlocked a drawer of his desk after two attempts&mdash;his hand shook
  so that he could not fit the key&mdash;and took out a black cash-box.</p>

  <p>"We've got to do this thing in style, Joan." His voice was shrill; the man
  was on edge, she saw. "Must get you married in the way old Joe would like,
  eh? You didn't tell the girls what I wanted you for?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"That's right. They would have wanted to come up and buy things as well,
  and I can't afford it."</p>

  <p>From the box he took a pad of notes and, without counting, laid them
  before her.</p>

  <p>"Get everything you want, my dear&mdash;nothing but the best. There's only
  one favour I would like to ask you." He stared out of the window, not meeting
  her eyes. "You know, Joan, I have interests in&mdash;queer sorts of ventures.
  I finance this and that and the other in a little way, and I have more
  fingers in more pies than people imagine." He passed his hand nervously
  across his chin, his eyes still on the window, and she wondered what was
  coming next. "I've put a whole lot of money into a dressmaking
  business&mdash;Madame Ferroni, 704, Fitzroy Square." His voice had grown
  suddenly husky. "It's not a very pretentious place; in fact, it's a suite on
  the third floor; but I'd like you to buy some of your gowns from Madame."</p>

  <p>"Why, surely, Mr Narth," she said, a little amused.</p>

  <p>"Go there first," said Stephen, still looking past her. "If she hasn't got
  what you want you needn't buy it. I've half promised I'd send you there, and
  it will be good for me too, though the business is a flourishing one."</p>

  <p>He wrote the address on a card and pushed it across the table to her.</p>

  <p>"Don't think because it's a poor-looking place that she hasn't got the
  dresses you want," he continued. "And Joan, I'm rather fussy about little
  things. Don't keep cabs waiting, my dear; they eat up money, and dressmakers
  keep you a long time. Always pay off the cabman when you go into a
  dressmaker's, Joan; you can generally get another without any trouble. No,
  no, don't count the money, it doesn't matter. If you want more you must ask
  and I will let you have it. Goodbye."</p>

  <p>His face was as white as death, his eyes held an apprehension which almost
  terrified her. She took the cold, clammy hand and shook it, but he stopped
  her thanks brusquely.</p>

  <p>"Go to Madame Ferroni's first, won't you? I promised her you would."</p>

  <p>The door closed on her and he gave her time to get out of the building,
  and then he walked to the door and locked it. As he did so, the second door
  which led to the boardroom opened slowly and Fing-Su came in. Stephen Narth
  turned, a glare of hate in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well, I've done it," he jerked. "If any harm comes to that girl,
  Fing-Su&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Fing-Su smiled broadly and flicked a speck of invisible dust from his
  well-fitting morning coat.</p>

  <p>"No harm will come to her, my dear man," he said in his soft, suave way.
  "It is merely a move in the great game. A tactical point gained, that the
  strategical plan may be brought to complete success."</p>

  <p>Narth was fingering the telephone.</p>

  <p>"I've a good mind to stop her," he said huskily. "I could call Lynne and
  he would get there first."</p>

  <p>Fing-Su smiled again, and his eye did not leave the telephone and the
  nervous hand that played with the receiver.</p>

  <p>"That would be a catastrophe for you, Mr Narth," he said. "You owe us
  fifty thousand pounds which you can never repay."</p>

  <p>"Never repay?" snarled the other. "You seem to forget that I'm the heir of
  Joe Bray."</p>

  <p>The Chinaman showed his white teeth in a humorous grin.</p>

  <p>"An heirship is not of very much value until the testator dies," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"But Joe Bray is dead!" gasped the other.</p>

  <p>"Joe Bray," said Fing-Su coolly, as he tapped a cigarette upon a golden
  box he had taken from his waistcoat pocket, "is very much alive. In fact, I
  heard him with my own ears last night!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch29"
     id="ch29">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">With no other thought save one of perplexity at Stephen
  Narth's changed appearance, Joan went forth on a mission which would have
  been dear to any woman but was especially pleasing to her in the
  circumstances. She counted the money as she sat in the taxi: there was
  £320&mdash;an enormous sum to one who had never owned more than ten pounds in
  her life.</p>

  <p>Madame Ferroni's address she had given to the driver, and for the next ten
  minutes she was interested in the skill with which he threaded his way
  through the traffic, worked round the blocks at every busy street crossing,
  till he reached the comparative freedom of the Euston Road.</p>

  <p>Fitzroy Square has a peculiar character of its own; its proximity to the
  West End trading centres has saved it from the indignity which has befallen
  so many of the obscure squares of London and has converted fine old Queen
  Anne houses into tenements. It boasted a restaurant of some reputation, a
  dancing club or two, and numerous business offices.</p>

  <p>The doorpost of No. 704 was almost entirely covered with brass plates
  announcing the variegated professions and trades which were carried on behind
  its open doorway. Painted at the top were the words: "Madame Ferroni,
  Modiste, 3rd floor back." The paint, she noticed, was still wet.</p>

  <p>She had dismissed the cabman to satisfy the frugal views of her relation,
  and mounting the stairs she came at last, a little out of breath but elated
  with the exhilarating character of her visit, to a door on which, also newly
  painted, was the dressmaker's name. She knocked, and was immediately
  admitted. The woman who opened the door to her was dark-faced and forbidding.
  She was dressed in black, and this emphasized her sallow complexion. Hers was
  a complexion distinct from the normal darkness of European races; there were
  faint, livid shadows under her eyes; her lips were thick, her nose a little
  squat. She was unquestionably a half caste. The slant eyes, the yellow tinge
  to her skin, marked her unmistakably to a student of ethnology&mdash;but Joan
  was not such a student.</p>

  <p>This would not have alarmed the girl but for the fact that the room into
  which she was ushered was almost empty and the door that closed upon her was
  immediately locked. There was an inner door of baize, and this also the woman
  fastened.</p>

  <p>Joan looked round a room bare except for a big wardrobe, a settee and a
  tea table which had been laid, and the kettle on which was steaming. Of
  dresses there was none, unless they were in the wardrobe, which, she saw, was
  a fixture.</p>

  <p>"Please do not be alarmed, Miss Bray," said the sallow woman, with an
  effort at amiability which made her plain face even more unprepossessing. "I
  do not keep my dresses here; this is where I interview my clients."</p>

  <p>"Why did you fasten the door?" asked the girl, and although she summoned
  her reserves of courage to her aid, she felt the colour leaving her face.</p>

  <p>Madame Ferroni cringed double in her anxiety to preserve the confidence of
  her visitor.</p>

  <p>"I do not wish to be interrupted while I have a very important client,
  Miss Bray," she said. "You see, miss, your uncle, Mr Narth, put all his money
  into this business and I wish to please him. It is natural! I have the
  dresses at my shop in Savoy Street, and we will go there at once and you
  shall choose what you wish. But first I wanted to have a little talk with
  you&mdash;to obtain ideas of your requirements."</p>

  <p>She spoke with a certain precision, almost as though she were reciting
  passages which she had committed to memory.</p>

  <p>"You must join me in a cup of tea," she went on. "This tea habit is one
  which I have acquired since I came to this country."</p>

  <p>Joan was not especially interested in habits, except the habit of locked
  doors that remained fastened.</p>

  <p>"Madame Ferroni&mdash;I am afraid I cannot stay now. I will come back
  later."</p>

  <p>Joan pulled open the green baize, but the key had been taken from the lock
  of the outer door.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, if you wish," Madame Ferroni had a trick of shrugging one
  shoulder. "But you realize that if I do not please you I may lose my
  job?"</p>

  <p>She had the awkwardness of a foreigner making tea, and now poured forth
  the strong dark-brown liquid, treated it over-generously with milk, and
  handed the cup to the girl. She had need of stimulant, but would have
  welcomed a glass of water, for her mouth had gone dry with fear, and she
  found an increasing difficulty in speaking.</p>

  <p>One thought was at the back of her mind&mdash;she must not let the woman
  know she was afraid, or that she suspected there was anything unusual in this
  method of receiving a possible client. She stirred the tea and drank eagerly,
  as Madame took the key from the table and, walking slowly to the door,
  slipped it in the lock and turned it. She turned it twice, once to open and
  once to close it again, but of this fact Joan was unaware.</p>

  <p>"Now I will put on my hat and we will go," said Madame Ferroni,
  accompanying her words by lifting down a huge black hat from a peg on the
  wall. "I do not like Fitzroy Square; it is so dull. And as I told Mr Narth,
  clients will not climb three flights of stairs to try on pretty
  dresses..."</p>

  <p>The cup dropped from Joan's fingers and smashed to splinters. With the
  litheness of a tiger, Madame leapt suddenly across the room and, catching the
  dazed girl as she swayed, lowered her gently to the floor.</p>

  <p>As she did so there came a thunderous knock at the outer door, and Madame
  Ferroni's face went green.</p>

  <p>"Anybody here?"</p>

  <p>There was authority in the tone, and the woman stood trembling, her hand
  on the key.</p>

  <p>Again came the summons.</p>

  <p>"Open the door; I can see the key on the inside," said the voice.</p>

  <p>Turning swiftly, Madame opened the wall-wardrobe and lifted out the loose
  bottom. There were eight inches of space between the floor of the room and
  the baseboard of the cupboard, and, lifting the limp figure of Joan, she laid
  her in the dusty cavity. Replacing the loose bottom, she closed and locked
  the wardrobe, took the girl's tea cup and saucer, and, pushing open the
  window, flung them out into the little backyard. A swift glance round, and,
  walking to the door, she turned the key and flung it open.</p>

  <p>A man was standing on the landing. Madame's knowledge of the police was
  more than academical, and that this was a Scotland Yard man she knew. She had
  a tawny husband who had been snatched from her by such a man as this. She
  half recognized the caller but did not remember his name.</p>

  <p>"Hallo!" he asked. "Where is Miss Bray?"</p>

  <p>"Miss&mdash;?" The woman frowned as though she had not heard the name
  aright.</p>

  <p>"Miss Bray. She came in here five minutes ago."</p>

  <p>Madame Ferroni smiled and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You are mistaken," she said. "Nobody has been here but me."</p>

  <p>The detective walked into the room and looked around. He saw the table and
  the solitary cup.</p>

  <p>"What is in that cupboard?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;would you like to see it?" asked Madame sarcastically, and
  added: "May I ask who you are?"</p>

  <p>"I am Detective-Sergeant Long of Scotland Yard," said the other. "You know
  who I am&mdash;I raided your house two years ago and pinched your Chinese
  husband for peddling dope. Open that cupboard."</p>

  <p>With her one-shouldered shrug 'Madame Ferroni' threw open the doors. The
  floorboard was in place; not for an instant did it occur to the detective to
  wonder what occupied the space between that and the floor.</p>

  <p>"Has she been and gone?" he asked. "Is that what you're telling me?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know of whom you speak."</p>

  <p>From his pocket he took a small card, bearing the address written in
  Stephen Narth's hand&mdash;he had followed the taxi to Fitzroy Square, had
  intercepted the driver and taken the card from him.</p>

  <p>"You call yourself Madame Ferroni now, don't you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. And then came an inspiration.</p>

  <p>"There is another Madame Ferroni, on the top floor," she said. "It is very
  awkward having two names similar in the same building. That is why I am not
  staying."</p>

  <p>The detective looked at her sharply and hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I'll try the next floor," he said. "You wait here. If I find nothing
  upstairs, you'll go a little walk with me."</p>

  <p>She closed the door behind him. There was a small house telephone in a
  corner of the room. She lifted this, pushed the button and began speaking in
  a low, earnest tone. In the meantime the detective had reached the head of
  the stairs. He saw only one room, that immediately facing him, and he rapped
  at the door.</p>

  <p>A man's shrill voice said "Come in," and, unsuspecting, he pushed open the
  door and walked into the apartment.</p>

  <p>The thick derby hat he was wearing saved his life, for the heavy club that
  came down on his head would have killed him. He staggered under the blow;
  somebody hit him sideways with a bottle, and he went down to the floor like a
  log.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch30"
     id="ch30">CHAPTER THIRTY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Joan Bray came to consciousness with a sensation that
  something was hammering at regular and too frequent intervals on the crown of
  her head, and with every blow she winced. It was a long time before she
  realized that she was alone, and that the hammering came from within...</p>

  <p>There was a sort of earthenware sink in a corner of the room. No windows,
  but a skylight in the roof, through which she saw the dull light of a rainy
  day. Mostly she concentrated her mind upon the sink and the tarnished brass
  tap, from which ran a steady trickle of water.</p>

  <p>Dragging herself to her feet, she swayed and could hardly have maintained
  her balance but for the support of the wall; and now, with great labour and
  with her head throbbing at every step she took, she reached the tap, turned
  it and, first cupping her hands to catch the stream, she slaked her appalling
  thirst. Then she did what most women would have hesitated to do&mdash;she put
  her head under the cold stream, thankful that, in a moment of modernism, she
  had allowed herself to be shingled. Wringing the water from her hair, she
  stood upright. The pains in her head had diminished, and her immediate and
  prosaic requirement was a towel. She found one hanging on a roller, clean and
  new, and had a dim idea that it must have been put there specially for her
  use. By the time she had roughly dried herself, her mind was nearer
  normality. This room had been got ready specially for her. Near the old
  camp-bed on which she had been lying was a stool, on which was balanced a
  covered tray, a coffee-pot and a roll.</p>

  <p>What time was it? She looked at the watch on her wrist; the hands pointed
  to half-past four. It had been three o'clock when she went into Madame
  Ferroni's fateful room. In an hour and a half she had moved to
  &mdash;where?</p>

  <p>She sat down on the bed and tried to create, from her confused thoughts,
  some clear conspectus of her situation. There was a piece of soiled green
  sacking beneath the bed. From where she sat she could see three
  letters&mdash;'Maj... ' She pulled out the sacking. Major Spedwell, S &amp; M
  Poona, was the faded inscription. Who was Major Spedwell? she wondered. She
  had met him somewhere... Of course, he was the third man present at the
  projected luncheon which Clifford Lynne had so rudely interrupted. Was she
  still in Fitzroy Square? And if she was not, how had they got her... wherever
  she was? The skylight was of frosted glass, but she could see the rain
  running down in little streams and could hear the sough of the wind
  outside.</p>

  <p>She had no illusions whatever as to into whose charge she had fallen, for
  she could associate the dark face of Madame Ferroni with the coloured man
  whose startled face she had seen in the light of the magnesium flare. She was
  somewhere under the vigilant eye of Fing-Su! She winced at the thought. And
  Stephen Narth had sent her to this dreadful place... That recollection hurt
  her; for although she did not like Stephen, she had never in her most
  uncharitable moments conceived him capable of such infamy.</p>

  <p>She got up quickly as the door opened, and instantly recognized the man
  who came in and closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"You are Major Spedwell?" she said, and it was surprising how hoarse her
  voice was.</p>

  <p>He was taken aback for the moment.</p>

  <p>"I am Major Spedwell, yes," he said. "You have a good memory, young
  lady."</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"In a safe place. And you needn't be scared; no harm is coming to you. I
  have been guilty of a good many things"&mdash;he hesitated &mdash;"from
  manslaughter to forgery, but I haven't got so far down in the mud that I'd
  allow Fing-Su to hurt you. You're here as a hostage."</p>

  <p>"To what?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"To fortune." His quick smile held no humour in it. "You know all about
  it, young lady&mdash;Fing-Su wants a certain share from Clifford Lynne. I
  think he has already discussed the matter with you. You see, that share
  certificate is rather an important matter to us."</p>

  <p>"And you think that Mr Lynne will give it to you in exchange for
  &mdash;me?"</p>

  <p>"That's about the size of it," said Spedwell, with a curious glance at the
  girl's wet hair. "We're doing a little banditti work: you're held for
  ransom."</p>

  <p>Her lips curled.</p>

  <p>"Your friend has evidently a very high opinion of Mr Lynne's chivalry,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"Or his love," was Spedwell's quiet reply. "Fing-Su thinks that Clifford
  Lynne is crazy about you, and will part without a squeal."</p>

  <p>"Then I'm happy to think that Fing-Su will have a shock," she said. "Mr
  Lynne and I do not love each other; and as to marriage, there is no longer
  any need for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>On the point of betraying the return of Joe Bray, she stopped herself.</p>

  <p>"No need for the marriage now that old Joe's alive, eh? Oh, yes, I know,"
  he said. He had a smile that came and went with incredible rapidity. "In
  fact, we all know. But Clifford Lynne is fond of you; I agree with
  Fing-Su."</p>

  <p>It was useless to pursue this topic. She asked where she was.</p>

  <p>"In Peckham. I don't see why you shouldn't know. If you managed to away
  from here any policeman would tell you. This is one of the change rooms that
  the girl explosive workers used in the war. It isn't very cosy, but it is the
  best we could do," he said. "Believe me, Miss Bray, there is nothing to fear.
  I'm the only person with a key to this building, and you are as safe as
  though you were in your own room at Sunni Lodge."</p>

  <p>"You're not going to leave me here, Major?" She purposely used the title,
  but he was not made uncomfortable by this s reminder of a more honourable
  past. Rather, he divined her intention.</p>

  <p>"I hope you're going to be sensible, young lady," he said.. "If you are
  going to appeal to my manhood and all that sort of stuff, and the fact that
  I've held the King's commission, you can save yourself the effort. My skin is
  pretty thick&mdash;I was kicked out of the Army for forgery, and I've got to
  the point where I can't be ashamed of myself."</p>

  <p>"That is a long way, Major," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Rather a long way," he admitted. "The only thing I can promise you is
  that no harm will come to you&mdash;while I am alive," he added, and somehow
  she believed him.</p>

  <p>He closed the door, locked it, and went out at the back of the building to
  where his car was waiting. Fing-Su was in his office on Tower Hill when
  Spedwell arrived, an impatient, worried man, for so far he had not heard that
  the girl had been safely conveyed to the factory, a somewhat difficult
  undertaking in broad daylight.</p>

  <p>"Yes, she's there all right," said Spedwell moodily, and took a cigar from
  an open box on the table, bit off the end and lit it. "How long do you expect
  to keep her?"</p>

  <p>Fing-Su spread out his long, thin palms.</p>

  <p>"How long will Mr Clifford Lynne keep me waiting?" he asked. And then:
  "How is the detective?"</p>

  <p>"Nearly dead," was the laconic reply. "But I think he'll recover. There
  was nearly a hanging for you and me in that alone, Fing-Su."</p>

  <p>The Chinaman's face had gone grey.</p>

  <p>"Dead?" he said huskily. "I told them to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You told them to knock him out. They pretty well knocked him out of
  life," said the other in his brief, direct way. "A detective-sergeant isn't a
  very important person, but killing him would be one of those little errors
  which upset big enterprises. There will be hell to pay as soon as this man is
  reported missing, because they will naturally turn to you and to me for
  information."</p>

  <p>"What was he doing?" demanded the other.</p>

  <p>"Shadowing Miss Bray&mdash;as I warned you. The only thing we could do is
  to put him on the ship. Unfortunately we dare not move him. Perhaps we could
  take him later&mdash;you could hold him in one of your towns until the affair
  blew over."</p>

  <p>He picked up a paperweight from the table and his attention seemed to be
  concentrated upon the many-sided crystal.</p>

  <p>"You'll have no other passengers, will you?"</p>

  <p>"I may go," said the other carelessly. "And of course you will go
  also."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you waiting for Clifford Lynne's share?"</p>

  <p>Fing-Su shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That will be in the hands of my agent tomorrow," he said confidently.
  "Naturally I shall not appear in the transaction. If am on the high seas they
  cannot connect me."</p>

  <p>Major Spedwell laughed harshly.</p>

  <p>"Won't Miss Bray connect you? Won't Stephen Narth?"</p>

  <p>Fing-Su shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not after tonight," he said in a low voice, and the dark-faced man bit
  his lip thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"After tonight?" What would be his own status&mdash;after tonight? He knew
  the man he was dealing with. Fing-Su was a good paymaster, but that was where
  his virtues ended. And he had had several unintentional hints that he had
  ceased to find favour in the eyes of his employer &mdash;certain intonations
  of voice, a look he had intercepted between Fing-Su and his yellow
  assistants. Major Spedwell was a shrewd, discerning man, keenly sensitive to
  atmosphere.</p>

  <p>"And Leggat?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Leggat can go to the devil; I am finished with him. I always knew the man
  was untrustworthy. We have taken a lot of trouble to prove the obvious."</p>

  <p>"Are you asking him to attend Lodge tonight?" demanded Spedwell.</p>

  <p>"No," was the short reply.</p>

  <p>Then, as if he realized that his brusqueness might arouse the other's
  suspicion:</p>

  <p>"Leggat is no longer useful; he is a drunkard, and therefore dangerous.
  You, my dear Major, are indispensable. I do not know what I should do without
  you. Have you finished your little land mine?"</p>

  <p>He was trying to be pleasant, and the Major was not deceived.</p>

  <p>"Ah! what a conception!" said Fing-Su, rolling his dark eyes in a
  transport of admiration. "You are a genius! I could not dispense with such a
  lieutenant."</p>

  <p>Spedwell knew well enough that there was nothing especially ingenious
  about his land mine&mdash;which was a time-bomb on a large scale and
  detonated when one acid ate through a leaden partition and mingled with
  another. It was an instrument of warfare familiar enough to military
  engineers. But Fing-Su's flattery set his mind working.</p>

  <p>Major Spedwell had a little flat in Bloomsbury. He was by education an
  engineer, by choice an artillerist. But none of his attainments approached
  his natural gift of instinct. His mind was waving red flags; he knew that a
  tremendous change in his fortunes was imminent, and he was satisfied that
  that change was for the worse.</p>

  <p>In the few hours he had at his disposal before he must dress and meet
  Stephen Narth he took a pencil and paper and systematically and thoroughly
  set down all the possibilities, and sought for a remedy. And there was
  gradually evolved in his kinky mind something which, if not a remedy, was an
  escape for one person at least; possibly&mdash;here he naturally included
  himself&mdash;for two.</p>

  <p>He burnt the paper in the grate, went into the little room that he used as
  a workshop, and for an hour laboured at top speed. At half past six he
  carried out to the street an oblong box and a heavy kitbag, put them tenderly
  in the car well and drove to Ratcliffe Highway. Threading the narrow lanes
  that lead to the river, he came to the water's edge and was fortunate to find
  a boatman, who, for a consideration, rowed him out to one of two black
  steamers lying at anchor in the Pool. A Chinaman with an inscrutable face
  hailed him from the gangway, and would have carried the bag on board for him,
  only the Major declined.</p>

  <p>The ship carried a black captain and purser, the latter a good-humoured
  man whose life Spedwell had once saved. It was a lucky day for many people
  when the Major had stood between Fing-Su's wrath and this Negro officer, for
  the Kroo folk have a peculiar loyalty of their own. He sent for the purser as
  soon as he reached the deck.</p>

  <p>"You needn't tell Fing-Su I've been aboard," he said. "I've got something
  I want to take out with me to the coast."</p>

  <p>"Are you coming too, Major?" asked the purser.</p>

  <p>"I may come; I don't know. The point is, I don't want anybody to know I've
  got these things on board."</p>

  <p>The purser took him to a large cabin on the well deck.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been using this for passenger accommodation?" asked the
  Major with a frown.</p>

  <p>"Never used it before," said the man, "but Fing-Su has given orders that
  it has to be got ready for a passenger."</p>

  <p>"Not for him&mdash;he has the captain's cabin. Who is going this
  trip?"</p>

  <p>But here the purser could not help him. He could, however, indicate a
  place of storage for the thing which Spedwell carried. It was a small black
  chest with two hasps and padlocks, and very carefully the visitor deposited
  his treasure on the deck.</p>

  <p>"I'll go along and get the padlocks for you, Major," said the officer, and
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>This absence was very necessary to Major Spedwell, for he had certain
  delicate adjustments to make before the purser returned with the locks and
  keys. The little box had to be packed about with square brown cakes, which he
  took from his bag. He found some difficulty in fitting them in the space, but
  he had finished his work and had closed down the lid before the black officer
  returned with the locks in his hand.</p>

  <p>Spedwell straightened himself up and dusted his knees.</p>

  <p>"Now listen, Haki&mdash;who works your wireless?"</p>

  <p>"Either me or one of my Chink boys. I've got the instrument in my cabin.
  Why?"</p>

  <p>Spedwell handed him the key of the chest.</p>

  <p>"Put that in your pocket and never let it leave you. If you get a radio
  from me which says 'All well,' take the stuff out of the box and chuck it
  overboard. You'll probably get the message before you leave the Channel.
  You'll remember?"</p>

  <p>Haki nodded, his eyes round with wonder.</p>

  <p>"I don't get the idea," he said, "but I'll do what you tell me, Major. Are
  you smuggling something?"</p>

  <p>But Spedwell had no further information to give. He did not tell the man
  that in certain eventualities another radio would reach him; there was time
  enough when the crisis arose.</p>

  <p>"But suppose you make this trip with us?" persisted the Negro.</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Spedwell, with a twisted smile, "I'll be able to
  whisper the message in your ear&mdash;if I'm travelling alive!"</p>

  <p class="first">Joe Bray arrived in Clarges Street shortly after ten, for
  rainclouds had hastened the hour of darkness and had made possible an earlier
  move from Sunningdale. He was charged with suppressed excitement, for the
  night promised an adventure, and adventure was the breath of old Joe Bray's
  nostrils.</p>

  <p>"Great idea of yours, Cliff, coming in the back way through the garage so
  that nobody could see me," he said.</p>

  <p>"I could have saved you the trouble," said Clifford. "Fing-Su knows you're
  alive."</p>

  <p>Joe Bray's face fell. The news robbed him of half his mystery.</p>

  <p>"I have a man in Narth's office, a fellow named Perkins," explained
  Clifford. "It took me more time than money to suborn him, because he's one of
  the loyal kind. Did the detectives arrive?"</p>

  <p>Joe nodded.</p>

  <p>"A bit disappointing they was, Cliff," he complained; "just ordinary
  people like you and me. You'd never think they was detectives."</p>

  <p>"That seems an asset," said Clifford, and after a moment's thought: "Did
  you get into touch with Joan?"</p>

  <p>Old Joe shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You told me not to," he said virtuously.</p>

  <p>"You don't even know whether she's come back?" He sighed. "I'm not very
  much worried about her, because Scotland Yard has put a man to shadow her.
  He'll probably report later."</p>

  <p>"How did you get Scotland Yard into this, Cliff?" asked the big man
  curiously. "And if they're in, why don't they pinch Fing-Su?"</p>

  <p>"Because they haven't sufficient evidence to pinch anybody," said Clifford
  shortly.</p>

  <p>He was beginning to feel the strain of this battle with the invisible
  forces of the Chinaman.</p>

  <p>"You'll be able to satisfy your curiosity about Scotland Yard. It's quite
  an unromantic place. Superintendent Willing is calling tonight and is going
  with us down-river. Can you swim, Joe?"</p>

  <p>"Anything that's manly I can do," said Joe emphatically. "Get out of your
  head, Cliff, that I'm a back number. There's I nothing that ever walked in
  trousers that could get me hollering for mother. A man of fifty is in the
  prime of life, as I've often said."</p>

  <p>Superintendent Willing arrived soon after&mdash;a thin, cadaverous man
  with a mordant sense of humour and a low opinion of humanity. In some
  respects he was nearer to the typical idea of Joe Bray's imagination than the
  three men he had met earlier in the evening, for the superintendent spoke
  little and conveyed an impression of infallibility.</p>

  <p>"You know we searched the <i>Umgeni</i> this morning? She's due out
  tonight."</p>

  <p>Clifford nodded.</p>

  <p>"There was nothing in the shape of contraband. Perhaps they're going to
  send it by the <i>Umveli</i>&mdash;that's the sister ship. They're lying side
  by side in the Pool. But she's not due to sail for a month, and she goes to
  Newcastle first. Have you seen anything of my man, Long &mdash;the fellow I
  put to trail Miss Bray?" And when Clifford shook his head: "I thought he
  might have reported to you. He's probably gone back to Sunningdale with her.
  Now, Mr Lynne, what is the business end of this Chink's operations?"</p>

  <p>"Fing-Su? So far as I can gather, his idea is to create a new dynasty in
  China! Before he can bring that into being he would in the ordinary course of
  events have to fight the various mercenary generals who have sliced up the
  country between them, but I rather imagine he has found the easier way. Every
  general in China has his price&mdash;always remember that the Chinese have no
  patriotism; are unconscious of any sentiment for the soil that produced them.
  Their politics are immediate and local. Most of them aren't aware that
  Mongolia has become a Russian province. The generals are bandits on the grand
  scale, and battles are decided by the timely desertions of armies. Strategy
  in China means getting the best price for treachery and keeping your plans
  dark until the last minute."</p>

  <p>"And Narth&mdash;he's rather a puzzle to me," said Willing. "I can't see
  what value he can be to Fing-Su and his crowd. The man is no genius, and
  certainly no fighter."</p>

  <p>"Narth is very useful; make no mistake about that. Although he is
  practically bankrupt, he knows the City intimately&mdash;by which I mean that
  when it comes to a question of negotiating dollars against lives, there won't
  be a better man in the City of London than Stephen Narth. He is personally
  acquainted with the great financial groups; he has the very knowledge which
  Fing-Su lacks. If Fing-Su succeeds there will be some valuable concessions to
  be had&mdash;Narth is to be the broker! At present he is a doubtful
  proposition, and Fing knows it. The money he has borrowed from our Chinese
  friend doesn't give Fing-Su the grip on him that he imagines. Stephen has got
  to be clamped to the Joyful Hands with bonds of steel. Perhaps the
  mumbory-jumbory of the initiation service might hold him&mdash;but I doubt
  it."</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"It's time we made a move," he said. "I have arranged for an electric
  launch to meet us at Wapping. Have you a gun?"</p>

  <p>"Don't want it," said the superintendent cheerfully. "I've a walking-cane
  that's got a kick in it and makes no noise. But I think the evening is going
  to be wasted. I've searched the <i>Umgeni</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to look at the <i>Umgeni</i>," interrupted Cliff grimly.
  "Her sister ship's lying alongside&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But she doesn't sail for a month."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," said Cliff, "she sails tonight."</p>

  <p>The superintendent laughed.</p>

  <p>"You know very little about ships," he said. "She'll be held up at the
  mouth of the river and her papers searched, and unless they are in order
  she'll not leave the Thames River."</p>

  <p>"They will be in order," said Clifford cryptically.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch32"
     id="ch32">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</a></h2>

  <p class="first">To the artist the Pool of London has a peculiar beauty of
  its own. Here lie the great ocean-going steamers, and along this watery
  highway passes the traffic of half a world. It is a place of soft tones, on a
  fine evening; a nocturne of greys and blues and russet reds. It is a
  veritable pool of romance even in the drab days of winter, when the stained
  hulls and the grime-coated funnels come slowly out of sunny seas to rest on
  these mud-coloured waters.</p>

  <p>On a dark and rainy summer evening, with an unaccountable northerner to
  chill the bones of those adventurers who set forth upon the surface of the
  river, the Pool has little attraction. Clifford found his big electric launch
  waiting at the greasy flight of stairs, and slipping under the stern of a
  Norwegian timber ship, he steered to the middle of the river. A police skiff
  came out of the darkness, challenged them and was satisfied, and followed in
  their wake. The tide was running in and was favourable to their enterprise,
  for they could afford to go half-speed.</p>

  <p>Clifford's scheme was to find a hiding-place on board the ship, and if
  they were undetected to go down-river with the ship to Gravesend, where the
  ship would be held up to take on a pilot and for the examination of papers,
  before being allowed to proceed on her voyage. If they were discovered,
  Willing had the necessary authority to account for their presence and to
  conduct an eleventh-hour search for forbidden exports.</p>

  <p>There were ships to left and right of them, some silent and dark, save for
  their riding lamps, others ablaze with lights and noisy with the rattle and
  whine of donkey engines as they unloaded into lighters with the aid of great
  branch lamps swung over the side. A belated pleasure craft passed them, a
  glittering palace of a thing, from which came the strains of a wheezy
  band.</p>

  <p>The four men who occupied the launch wore oilskins and sou'westers, and
  the need for this protection was emphasized before they had reached the
  middle of the river, for the drizzle became a downpour.</p>

  <p>"Give me China, where the sun is always shining!" murmured Joe Bray,
  squatting on the floorboards, but nobody answered him.</p>

  <p>After a quarter of an hour Superintendent Willing said in a low voice:</p>

  <p>"There are the boats, right ahead on the Surrey side."</p>

  <p>The <i>Umgeni</i> and the <i>Umveli</i> were, as he had said, sister
  ships, and were more twin-like than most sister ships are. Their black hulls
  and funnels were familiar objects to the riverside loafer; they had the same
  curiously advanced navigation bridge, the same long superstructure running
  forward. Both had a single mast, and both sported a gilt and unnecessary
  figurehead of Neptune.</p>

  <p>There was no need to ask which was the <i>Umgeni</i>. Her decks were
  brilliantly illuminated, and as they came in sight of her a fussy little tug
  was drawing away three empty lighters from her side. A little more than a
  ship's length from her the Umveli swung at her moorings, a dark and lifeless
  shape.</p>

  <p>"You didn't search the <i>Umveli?</i>"</p>

  <p>"No, it hardly seemed necessary. She's only been in the river a little
  more than a week, and she's been unloading all that time."</p>

  <p>"By night," was Clifford's significant comment. "The ship which apears to
  be unloading by night might very easily be loading by night."</p>

  <p>The brilliance of the <i>Umgeni</i> illuminated the starboard side of her
  sister ship, and Lynne set the nose of the launch towards the shore, setting
  a course that would bring him in the shadow of the vessel.</p>

  <p>"Rather low down in the water for an empty ship, isn't she?" he asked, and
  the superintendent agreed.</p>

  <p>"She's going round to Newcastle in ballast to undergo repairs," he said.
  "At least, that is my information."</p>

  <p>There was little chance of confusing the two vessels. The word
  <i>Umgeni</i> in letters a yard long sprawled over the hull of that busy
  craft in great raised characters. As they came upon the dark side of the
  Umveli, Lynne looked up. They were passing under the stern, and he saw
  something which interested him.</p>

  <p>"Look at that," he whispered, pointing.</p>

  <p>The letters 'vel' had been removed from the stern of the ship.</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?"</p>

  <p>"They are changing names, that's all," said Clifford laconically. "In two
  hours the <i>Umveli</i> will go down the Thames with the <i>Umgeni</i>'s
  papers, and in the morning the <i>Umgeni</i>, newly christened, will steam
  out to sea ostensibly on its way to Newcastle." They were moving silently,
  and the dark-covered launch would not be visible to ordinary eyes;
  nevertheless, when they came abreast of the companion ladder a screeching
  voice hailed them.</p>

  <p>"What boat that?"</p>

  <p>"Passing," shouted Lynne gruffly.</p>

  <p>He focused a pair of night-glasses on the ship and presently he saw
  another look-out standing on the forecastle; and, more important, three
  shadowy shapes were on the bridge and smoke was coming up from the
  funnel.</p>

  <p>"They keep a pretty good watch for an empty ship," he said, expecting to
  be hailed again by the man on the forecastle, but evidently this watcher was
  not so vigilant as his fellow. Clifford saw him turn and walk slowly towards
  the ladder that led to the well of the deck, and instantly sent the launch
  about so that it came under the clipper bow.</p>

  <p>Reaching up, he caught hold of the chains with a rubber-covered boathook
  and steadied the launch, and in another instant had drawn himself up hand
  over hand till his arm encircled the bowsprit. As he peeped cautiously along
  the forecastle he heard somebody in a far-away voice call a name, and the
  forecastle watcher descended out of sight. In an instant he conveyed the
  intelligence, and first Willing and then Joe Bray, who displayed remarkable
  agility, followed him through the deserted ship. After seeing them safely on
  board, the launch drew off in accordance with instructions.</p>

  <p>"We'll get down into the well," whispered Lynne, and, hurrying ahead, he
  ran down the ladder, expecting every moment to be challenged.</p>

  <p>But the well was deserted. From an open doorway in the forecastle he heard
  the sound of a mouth-organ being played, whilst from ahead of him came the
  clop-clop of a hammer against wedges where the hatch was being finally
  closed. A narrow alleyway led from the well beneath the main deck, and if the
  party could reach this without attracting the attention of the men on the
  bridge, there was a possibility of finding a hiding-place.</p>

  <p>Keeping in the shadow of the bulwarks, Cliff Lynne crept along, Joe in his
  wake, and they reached the alleyway without incident. Here a hiding-place was
  revealed. Immediately under the bridge (and exactly two decks lower) was a
  large cabin which, to judge from the scratches and discolorations on the
  bulkhead, had been used for carrying cargo. Two dimly burning bulkhead lights
  showed that the place had been converted to carry passengers. There was a
  table, two or three chairs, a package bearing the label of a well-known
  bookseller, and on the floor, a brand-new carpet, its creases rising in
  rectangular ridges.</p>

  <p>Though the room ran the width of the ship it was not more than six feet in
  depth. In the after steel wall were two narrow bulkhead doors; one was
  padlocked and bolted, but the other stood ajar, and, pushing it open,
  Clifford stepped in, turning on his pocket-lamp.</p>

  <p>It was a tiny cupboard of a place, without windows, air being admitted
  through a deck ventilator, he guessed, for the atmosphere was pure and there
  was a gentle current of air. In a corner was a small brass bedstead, which
  had been clamped to the deck; in the farther corner was a recessed wash-place
  with a newly-fixed shower-bath and an earthenware basin. This and an
  incongruously ornate wardrobe, much too big for so small an apartment,
  completed the furniture.</p>

  <p>Hearing the sound of feet on the deck outside, Clifford beckoned his two
  companions into the small room. Through a crack in the door he saw a Chinese
  sailor enter and look round. Presently he went back to the door and shouted
  something, and another sailor joined him and they talked together in a
  dialect with which neither Joe Bray nor Clifford was acquainted. They were
  obviously Southern Chinese, and whatever was the subject of their discourse
  amused them for they punctuated their speech with raucous squeaks of
  laughter.</p>

  <p>And then, to Clifford's horror, before he could realize what was
  happening, one of the men put out his hand, gripped the door of the cubby
  house and slammed it tight. Clifford heard the grind of the bolt slipping
  into its place, and the slam of the outer door. They were trapped!</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch33"
     id="ch33">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It had been for Mr Stephen Narth a day of unrelieved misery.
  What remained of a conscience largely atrophied by self-interest was
  surprisingly sensitive to the knowledge of the evil he had done to an
  innocent girl. Again and again he had repeated Fing-Su's assurance that no
  harm would come to her, and again and again his reason rejected this futile
  act of self-deception. And then, on top of the other causes for misery, the
  news had come like a thunderbolt that Joe Bray was alive and that the
  treasure his fingers were reaching to touch was phantom gold!</p>

  <p>Joe Bray was alive!</p>

  <p>He had perpetrated an elaborate jest upon his heir. The easy way out was
  no longer a way at all, easy or difficult. His one surviving hope was vested
  in the integrity of Fing-Su.</p>

  <p>Stephen Narth was too intelligent a man to believe that the native would
  keep any promise he had ever made. And yet £50,000 was at stake. Would even
  the most fantastic of Chinamen lose his hold upon that enormous sum, as
  undoubtedly he would if Stephen Narth decided to break loose from his
  association. Bankruptcy? What was bankruptcy but an unpleasant incident which
  might come to any man, and had come to many better and more highly placed
  than Stephen Narth? And with bankruptcy the ambitious Chinaman might whistle
  for his money.</p>

  <p>This was the only comforting thought that the afternoon brought to him.
  The prospect of his initiation only filled him with a mild nausea that he
  should lower himself to the level of this 'mountebank Chink.'</p>

  <p>He was a member of two societies which might be described as 'secret', and
  his general knowledge of such matters was broad enough to acquaint him with
  most of the formula of initiation. He looked forward to the evening as a
  tiresome and uncomfortable waste of time. A journey to South London would
  have been a wretched experience at any hour or season, but the prospect of
  making his visit in the middle of the night, and of spending two hours, as he
  supposed, in the company of Chinese coolies, revolted him.</p>

  <p>Spedwell dined with him at his hotel, and did his best to gloss over the
  coming ordeal. This thin-faced man with his shifty dark eyes was glib enough,
  but he could not wholly assuage the sensation of disgust which the thought of
  the ceremony aroused in Stephen Narth's mind. His was not a delicate gorge by
  any means, but he had behind him an ancestry with high traditions; and the
  more he thought of his position, when he allowed himself to think at all, the
  more he hated the thought of the work of that day and the night which was to
  follow.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to be squeamish about," said Spedwell at last, as he lit
  a long black cheroot. "If anybody has a kick, it's me. You seem to forget,
  Narth, that I have commanded native infantry, and Indian infantry at that.
  Men of caste and refinement, men with European standards. You don't imagine
  that I like associating with the refuse of Asia, do you?"</p>

  <p>"You're different," snapped Stephen. "You're a soldier of fortune and you
  can adapt yourself to circumstances. What have they done with Joan?" he asked
  fretfully.</p>

  <p>"She's all right; she's being well taken care of. You needn't worry about
  her," said Spedwell easily. "I wouldn't allow anything to happen to the girl,
  you can be sure."</p>

  <p>They were dining in Stephen's private suite, and the hour that followed
  passed all too quickly for the troubled man. It was near midnight when they
  went out into Piccadilly together. Spedwell's car was waiting and reluctantly
  Stephen entered. All the way to South London he was plying the other with
  questions. What was Fing-Su's plan? Why were they anxious to enlist him? What
  would he be expected to do?...</p>

  <p>Spedwell answered him with great patience, but was obviously relieved when
  the car turned into a side thoroughfare near the canal bridge in the Old Kent
  Road.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," he said, and they got down.</p>

  <p>They had to walk for five minutes before they came to the narrow opening
  of a lane which ran by the side of a high brick wall. The only light they had
  came from a street lamp planted squarely in the entrance of the lane. The
  lamp served the double purpose of preventing the ingress of wheeled traffic
  and forming an inadequate illumination for the long and muddy thoroughfare.
  The rain was pelting down, and Stephen Narth pulled up the collar of his coat
  with a grunt.</p>

  <p>"What is this place?" he asked querulously.</p>

  <p>"Our factory&mdash;at least, our warehouse," replied Spedwell.</p>

  <p>He stopped before a door and, stooping, inserted a key and opened it.</p>

  <p>Narth was full of trivial complaints.</p>

  <p>"Was it necessary I should come in evening dress?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Very necessary," said the other. "Let me take your arm."</p>

  <p>So far as the initiate could see by the light which came from his
  conductor's lamp, he was being taken to a small shed built against the wall.
  It proved to be a bare apartment equipped with two old Windsor chairs.</p>

  <p>"It's dry, at any rate," said Spedwell as he switched on the light. "I
  shall have to leave you here; I must go along and tell Fing-Su you've
  come."</p>

  <p>Left alone, Narth occupied himself by pacing up and down the tiny chamber.
  He wondered if Leggat would be there, and whether the initiation would prove
  too grotesque for him to go through with. Presently he heard the key in the
  lock and Spedwell came in.</p>

  <p>"You can leave your coat here," he said. "There's only a little distance
  to walk."</p>

  <p>Mr Narth had arrayed himself, according to instructions, in a long-tailed
  evening coat and white tie, and now, at Spedwell's request, he took from his
  pocket a pair of white kid gloves and pulled them on.</p>

  <p>"Now!" said Spedwell, put out the light and led the way from the hut.</p>

  <p>They were on a gravelled path which ended with a flight of stairs which
  seemed to lead down into the ground. At the top of these stood two statuesque
  figures, and as they came near one challenged in a tongue which was
  unfamiliar to the novitiate.</p>

  <p>Spedwell lowered his voice and hissed something. With the other's hand on
  his arm, Narth descended the stairs and came to a second door, and again was
  challenged in the same language. Again Spedwell answered, and somebody rapped
  on a door. It was opened cautiously, there was a whispered interrogation, and
  then Spedwell's hand gripped the other's arm and he was led into a long,
  fantastically decorated hall. Was it imagination on his part, or did
  Spedwell's hand tremble?</p>

  <p>He stood looking down a long vista, and for a second he was inclined to
  laugh hysterically. Squatting on either side of this oblong apartment were
  line after line of Chinamen, and each man was in a shabby, ill-fitting
  evening dress. The white shirts were the veriest shams; he saw the end of one
  shirt-front sticking out, and round its edge he saw the curve of a brown
  body. On each shirt-front were two blazing stones. He had no need to be
  associated with the theatrical profession to realize that they were
  'property' diamonds. Solemnly, awfully, they stared at him, these quaint
  apparitions in their shoddy social livery.</p>

  <p>He gazed open-mouthed from one side to the other. They all wore white
  bows, comically tied. Each man had white cotton gloves which rested on his
  knees. He had seen something like it before... that was the first impression
  Stephen Narth received. And then he recalled... a coloured minstrel troupe
  sitting solemnly in exactly that attitude... white gloves on knees. Only
  these men were yellow.</p>

  <p>In four great blue vases joss-sticks were burning. The room was blue with
  their fumes.</p>

  <p>And now he let his eyes stray along the centre aisle to the white altar,
  and, behind it, enthroned, Fing-Su himself. Over his evening dress &mdash;and
  no doubt his diamonds were real&mdash;he wore a robe of red silk. On his head
  was an immense gold crown which sparkled with precious stones. One
  white-gloved hand held a golden rod, the other a glittering orb that flashed
  in the light of the shaded candelabra. Suddenly his voice broke the
  silence:</p>

  <p>"Who is this who comes to speak with the Joyful Hands?"</p>

  <p>Narth became conscious of the golden hands suspended above Fing-Su's head,
  but before he could take them in, Spedwell replied:</p>

  <p>"O Son of Heaven, live for ever! This is one, thy meanest slave, who comes
  to worship at thy throne!"</p>

  <p>Instantly at these words, as though they were watching some invisible
  choirmaster who led their chorus, the yellow men chanted something in
  chorus.</p>

  <p>They stopped as abruptly as they had begun.</p>

  <p>"Let him come near," said Fing-Su.</p>

  <p>Spedwell had disappeared; probably he was behind him. Narth did not dare
  turn his head to look. Two of these slovenly fellows in evening dress
  conducted him slowly along the hall. In a dim way he realized that the man on
  his right was wearing a pair of trousers that were three inches too short for
  him. But there was nothing comical in this. He was too oppressed with a sense
  of terror, a premonition of a horror yet unimagined, to find food for
  laughter in any of the incongruities which met his eyes on either side.</p>

  <p>And then he saw the altar with its glittering edge, and the shrouded
  figure of a man lying upon it, covered by a white sheet. He looked at it
  numbly; saw a great red heart pinned to the sheet... He was trying hard to
  think sanely, his wide-staring eyes fixed upon the shape and the red heart...
  On the hem of the shroud was a sprawling Chinese character in scarlet.</p>

  <p>"It's symbolical... only a wax figure," hissed a voice in his ear.</p>

  <p>So Spedwell was there. He received an accession of courage from this
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Say after me"&mdash;Fing-Su's deep, solemn voice filled the room with
  sounds&mdash;"I will be faithful to the Joyful Hands..."</p>

  <p>Like a man in a dream, Narth repeated the words.</p>

  <p>"I will strike to the heart all its enemies."</p>

  <p>He repeated the words. Where was Leggat? He expected to find Leggat here.
  His eyes roved round the visible arc, but there was no sign of that stout,
  jovial man.</p>

  <p>"By this sign"&mdash;Fing-Su was speaking&mdash;"do I give proof of my
  loyalty, my faith and my brotherhood..."</p>

  <p>Somebody slipped a thing into his hand. It was a long, straight knife,
  razor-keen.</p>

  <p>"Hold it above the figure," said a voice in his ear, and mechanically
  Stephen Narth obeyed as he repeated, without realizing what the words meant,
  the oath that the man on the dais prescribed.</p>

  <p>"So let all the enemies of the Emperor die!" said Fing-Su.</p>

  <p>"Strike at the heart!" whispered Spedwell's voice, and with all his
  strength Stephen Narth struck down.</p>

  <p>Something yielded under the knife; he felt a quiver. And then the white
  sheet went suddenly red. With a scream he clawed at the cloth where the head
  was and drew it back...</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" he shrieked.</p>

  <p>He was looking into the dead face of Ferdinand Leggat!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch34"
     id="ch34">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">He had killed Leggat! With his hands he, who would not have
  slain a rabbit, had struck this man to his death! The red on the cloth was
  widening; his hands were dabbled with the horrible fluid, and he turned with
  an insane yell to grapple with the devil who had whispered the words in his
  ear.</p>

  <p>Spedwell, his face distorted with horror, put out his hand to save
  himself, but the bloody hands gripped his throat and flung him down. And then
  something struck Narth and he tumbled over, first to his knees and then upon
  the tessellated pavement, a demented, screaming madman...</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The serried ranks of yellow men sat watching without
  movement, their shoddy diamonds glittering in their shirt-fronts, their white
  hands on their knees.</p>

  <p>An hour later Major Spedwell came into the apartment which was reserved
  for Fing-Su on his infrequent visits to the factory, and the Chinaman looked
  up over his book and flicked the ash of his cigarette into a silver tray.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked. "How is our squeamish friend?"</p>

  <p>Spedwell shook his head. He himself looked ten years older. His linen
  still bore the impress of a red hand.</p>

  <p>"Mad," he said laconically. "I think he's lost his reason."</p>

  <p>Fing-Su leaned back in his padded chair with a tut-tut of impatience.</p>

  <p>"That I did not bargain for," he said, in tones of gentle annoyance. "Who
  would have imagined that a full-grown man could have made such an exhibition
  of himself? Why, the fellow is a rank coward and outsider!"</p>

  <p>Spedwell did not reply. Perhaps he was wondering whether there would come
  a day when, for motives of expediency, he might himself lie drugged upon the
  marble altar whilst some initiate thrust down the fatal knife.</p>

  <p>"The idea was ingenious and should have had a better ending," said
  Fing-Su. "Leggat was a coward and a traitor, and deserved his death. Possibly
  our friend Narth will take a different view when he recovers, and realizes
  that he has so committed himself."</p>

  <p>Spedwell was eyeing him steadily.</p>

  <p>"You told me that the sacrifice was to be a Yun Nan man&mdash;the fellow
  who fell into the hands of Lynne. I hated the idea, but like a brute I
  agreed. God! When I saw Leggat's face!"</p>

  <p>He wiped his streaming brow; his breath came more quickly.</p>

  <p>Fing-Su said nothing, but waited.</p>

  <p>"How did you get Leggat?" asked Spedwell at last.</p>

  <p>"He just came. We gave him a drink&mdash;he knew nothing," said Fing-Su
  casually. "He had betrayed us&mdash;you know that. He's dead and there's an
  end of him. As to Narth, his life is in our hands."</p>

  <p>Spedwell, who had dropped into a chair, looked up.</p>

  <p>"He will have to be really mad to believe that," he said. "As I told you
  before, Fing-Su, our lives are in his hands, not his in ours."</p>

  <p>Fing-Su carefully scooped out the end of his cigarette, inserted another
  in the ebony holder and lit it before he answered.</p>

  <p>"Where have you put him?"</p>

  <p>"In the stone hut. He won't shout any more; I've given him a shot of
  morphia. There's only one thing to do, Fing-Su, and that is to get this man
  out of the country as quickly as you can. The <i>Umveli</i> leaves tonight;
  put him on board&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With the girl?"</p>

  <p>Spedwell's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, 'with the girl'?" he asked. "You're keeping her in
  London until Cliff Lynne gives you the share you want."</p>

  <p>The Chinaman puffed thoughtfully, his low forehead creased in thought.</p>

  <p>"That was the original idea," he admitted. "But so many things have
  happened in the past few hours... I am inclined to change my plans. We could
  get her to the Chinese coast and up one of the rivers without attracting any
  attention." He sent a cloud of smoke to the ceiling and watched it dissolve.
  "She's rather delicious," he said.</p>

  <p>Major Spedwell rose, walked deliberately to the table and stood, his palms
  resting on its surface.</p>

  <p>"She'll stay in England, Fing-Su," he said, slowly and emphatically, and
  for a second their eyes met, and then the Chinaman smiled.</p>

  <p>"My dear Major Spedwell," he said, "there can only be one master in any
  such organization as this, and that master, I beg to emphasize, is myself. If
  it is my wish that she should stay in England, she stays; if I desire that
  she should go to the coast, she goes, Is that understood?"</p>

  <p>So quickly did Spedwell's hand move, that Fing-Su saw nothing but a blur
  of moving pink. In that fraction of a second something had appeared in
  Spedwell's hand. It lay flat on the table, its black muzzle pointing to
  Fing-Su's white waistcoat.</p>

  <p>"She stays," said Spedwell tensely.</p>

  <p>The Chinaman's face was creased and puckered for a moment with a fear
  which the white man had never seen before. Presently he recovered himself and
  forced a smile.</p>

  <p>"As you wish, she may stay. There is nothing to be gained by quarrelling,"
  he said. "Where is she now? In the factory? Go and get her."</p>

  <p>Spedwell stared at this unexpected request.</p>

  <p>"I though you didn't want her to know you had a hand in this," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"It is a matter of indifference to me," said the other. "Go bring her,
  please."</p>

  <p>Spedwell had reached the door when he heard the soft swish of a drawer
  opening, and turned in a flash. A bullet seared his face and splintered the
  panel of the door. As his gun jerked up, he saw Fing-Su drop to the floor.
  For a second he hesitated, then, turning, fled into the big room from which
  the private office of 'the Emperor' led.</p>

  <p>It was a storehouse, piled high with bales of goods, with three narrow
  alleyways leading to the big doors at the end. He had only one chance. At the
  far end of the warehouse was the fuse-board which protected the lights in
  this wing of the factory. As, in response to the sound of shooting, the end
  door burst open, and a crowd of coolies flocked into the warehouse, he raised
  his automatic and fired twice. There was a splinter of marble and glass, and
  all the lights in the place went out.</p>

  <p>Leaping up, he pulled himself to the top of a bale and ran lightly along,
  springing from bale to packing-case, until he came within a few feet of the
  open door, around which a few undecided coolies were grouped. With one leap
  he was amongst them, his pistol blazing. They had not recovered from their
  astonishment when he had dived through them, sped across the dark yard and
  reached the top of the wall by way of the shed that Clifford Lynne had seen
  the night he made his unauthorized visit. Before his pursuers could reach
  him, he had dropped over the wall into the muddy alley and was flying for his
  life along the canal bank.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch35"
     id="ch35">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"There's another door here," said Willing suddenly.</p>

  <p>He was examining the wall of the inner cabin with the aid of his lamp. He
  pointed to an oblong aperture which apparently was fastened on the other
  side.</p>

  <p>"It is pretty useless to us," said Clifford Lynne after a brief
  inspection. "We shall have to wait until somebody comes in to make the bed.
  If what I believe is correct, the <i>Umveli</i> will be dropping down the
  river in an hour or two. I noticed just now that all the lights are out on
  the other ship. Just about now they will be ringing the changes."</p>

  <p>"What are they waiting for?" grumbled Joe. "Always thought they wanted a
  high tide to float out, and she's running high now. And with this rain, it is
  dark enough to hide a Dreadnought!"</p>

  <p>In the door behind which they were imprisoned were a number of small
  air-holes, and this gave Lynne an opportunity of observing the bigger room.
  The men had left the bulkhead lights burning, and dimly through the small
  porthole which faced him he could get a view of a blurred light moving and
  disappearing on the well deck. From beneath their feet there came the hum and
  whirr of the dynamo, and whilst they were listening they heard a dull roar
  from over the ship's side.</p>

  <p>"She's got a full head of steam," said Willing. "This looks as if your
  theory may be right, Lynne, and we are going to see something!"</p>

  <p>There were other evidences of activity. Above their heads they heard an
  insistent patter of feet, and a wailing chorus while a boat was hauled up and
  swung inboard.</p>

  <p>It was a quarter to three when they heard the clank of the anchor capstan,
  and almost immediately a well-known voice came to Lynne. The door of the
  outer cabin was flung open, and Fing-Su, in a long, fur-lined overcoat,
  stalked majestically into the apartment.</p>

  <p>"Here is your room, my young lady, and here you will stay. If you make a
  noise or give me any trouble or scream, I will find you a better furnished
  cabin!"</p>

  <p>It required all Clifford Lynne's presence of mind to check the cry that
  came to his lips, for there had followed Fing-Su into the cabin, a pale-faced
  girl. She was hatless, drenched with the rain, yet her little chin was held
  up and there was no fear in her eyes. He groaned in his soul as he recognized
  Joan Bray.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch36"
     id="ch36">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">She had been awakened from an uneasy sleep by the smashing
  in of her door, and had submitted, with a resolution, and a calm which were
  inexplicable to the watching Fing-Su, to be carried to the waiting car. The
  night was favourable to such a move; the streets were deserted, and nobody
  saw, in the two closed cars that moved swiftly towards Rotherhithe, anything
  of an unusual nature. It was not till she alighted on a deserted wharf,
  before she walked down the rickety stairs to the waiting boat, that she
  observed she had a companion in misfortune&mdash;somebody whose head was
  enveloped in a blanket, through which moans and whimperings were audible. She
  could never recall that journey from the shore to the ship. She had a vague
  recollection that somebody had carried her up a steep ladder and had
  deposited her on a wet and slippery deck, from which she rose with an effort.
  And then, through the rain, she had seen Fing-Su's peering face, and found
  herself pushed through the door of a poorly furnished cabin.</p>

  <p>The Chinaman went to the door and called a name which she thought sounded
  like 'Mammy!' and presently a fat Chinese woman came waddling in, wiping her
  hands upon a soiled apron.</p>

  <p>"This is your bedroom, young miss," said Fing-Su.</p>

  <p>He spun over the handle and the door moved slightly.</p>

  <p>"Attend, Amah!" He addressed the woman in the Honan dialect. "You will
  stay by this girl, and you will not let her out of your sight. If she screams
  you are to stop her, and if you don't-&mdash;" He raised the walking-stick he
  carried threateningly, and the old woman shrank back.</p>

  <p>The ship was moving now; the roar of its siren broke into the night. The
  girl standing by the table, heard the tinkle of the telegraph and the sudden
  <i>throb throb</i> of a slowly revolving propeller. It was a nightmare; it
  could not be real. Yet it was true; she was on a ship moving down Thames
  River towards the sea and&mdash;she shivered.</p>

  <p>What lay at the end of this voyage?</p>

  <p>And then she recalled the Major's words, and knew that he had kept faith.
  The fact that they had had to break down the door proved that he had no hand
  in this outrage. Where was he? she wondered, and then it flashed upon her
  that this whimpering thing, with its head hidden in a blanket, might be he.
  Only for a second did the thought remain; somehow she could not imagine that
  hard-faced man whimpering or snivelling for mercy.</p>

  <p>"You stay here, missie"&mdash;it was the fat Amah, still quaking with the
  terror which Fing-Su had inspired, and she spoke in lisping English&mdash;"I
  go make your bed."</p>

  <p>She opened the door wider and stepped inside, and Joan thought she heard a
  strange shuffling of feet, but took no notice of it until:</p>

  <p>"Can you put out the light?"</p>

  <p>She nearly swooned. It was Clifford Lynne's voice!</p>

  <p>It took her a minute before she could locate the switch which controlled
  the light but after a while she found it near the edge of the door, and for a
  long time she could not control her trembling fingers sufficiently to turn
  the little knob. The moment the lights were extinguished somebody came
  swiftly to her side, a strong arm went round her shoulders, and she found
  herself sobbing hysterically on his breast. There was a long deep silence,
  broken only by her weeping, and then, anxiously:</p>

  <p>"I'm her only relation, Cliff," said Joe Bray's voice. "It's natural an'
  proper for a young gel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" hissed Lynne, and the humour of this exchange between one who
  was anxious to take Clifford's place as comforter was almost too much for the
  girl.</p>

  <p>There came the sound of tapping on the portlight.</p>

  <p>"Why have you put the light out?" demanded Fing-Su's voice.</p>

  <p>"The young woman is undressing," said Cliff, speaking in the dialect and
  giving a fair imitation of the stout woman from Honan.</p>

  <p>He heard the man's grumbling voice:</p>

  <p>"Why didn't she undress in the bedroom?" But evidently Fing-Su was
  satisfied, and he moved off.</p>

  <p>Through the window Clifford could see that the ship was in the middle of
  the river heading downstream and going at half speed. He was puzzled as to
  why Fing-Su had left the girl here, in so exposed a part of the vessel, which
  was certain to be boarded at Gravesend not only by representatives of the
  Port of London, but by the pilot who was to take her out to sea. Moreover, it
  would be growing light in an hour, and that would make the danger of
  discovery all the more pressing. He heard men working outside, and after a
  while one of the portlights was obscured, and he guessed that they were
  piling deck cargo round the door.</p>

  <p>Their position was a precarious one, as the superintendent pointed
  out.</p>

  <p>"We should have held up Fing-Su when he opened the door," he said, but
  Clifford shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That sounds simple, but somehow I don't think that he will come into the
  cabin until the ship is well out to sea," he said seriously. "We're going to
  have trouble. Is there any chance of forcing the door?"</p>

  <p>Willing tried the door and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It would be easy to smash the portlights," he suggested.</p>

  <p>Clifford smiled in spite of himself.</p>

  <p>"But even you couldn't get through the portlights, superintendent!" he
  said dryly.</p>

  <p>"We could draw attention&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Two unarmed officials would be of very little use to us. Before they
  could bring help, even supposing Fing-Su let them off, we should be dead. No,
  the only thing to do is to wait. Sooner or later they must open the door, and
  the moment we get Fing-Su in this cabin there will be no more
  trouble&mdash;except for Fing-Su!"</p>

  <p>Dawn was breaking, but they saw little of the blessed light of day, for
  bale after bale had been piled up before the deckhouse until its portholes
  were completely darkened. It so interfered with the ventilation that the air
  grew foul and breathing was difficult, a possibility which Fing-Su had
  probably overlooked, and they were compelled to retreat to the inner room,
  where the air was fresh, and here they sat as hour followed hour, listening.
  They heard the ship's engines stop, and the <i>Umveli</i> remained stationary
  for the greater part of an hour; then, with a sinking of heart, they heard
  again the <i>throb throb</i> of engines, and presently the ship began to roll
  slightly as it came to sea.</p>

  <p>Evidently the bales had been placed before the portholes and door for the
  purpose which Clifford had guessed, for hardly had they struck the open sea
  when daylight appeared, and through the ventilators placed on a level with
  the floor came a current of sweet air.</p>

  <p>Food must be brought in soon, and they waited for the door to open. The
  old Amah had given up weeping and bemoaning her fate, and squatted now, a
  sullen, fatalistic figure, in one corner of the tiny cabin. The passage of
  time did not reconcile her to captivity. Her teeth continued to chatter, and
  it was she who brought about the undoing of their plan. Clifford Lynne learnt
  afterwards that the cook whose duty it was to bring the breakfast was her
  son, and it was fear for his life that made her utter a piercing scream when
  the key came into the lock. Before they could restrain her she had rushed out
  of the cabin, uttering yell after yell. Old Joe Bray darted after her, caught
  her round her ample waist, and covered her face with his hands. But it was
  too late: someone was glaring round the porthole. It was Fing-Su, and Cliff
  saw that he in turn had been recognized. He pulled his gun and fired twice.
  The glass of the porthole was shattered to splinters.</p>

  <p>"That's done it!" said the detective with a growl.</p>

  <p>They heard a shrill whistle blow, and, glancing sideways through one of
  the portholes, Clifford saw armed coolies swarming out of the forecastle,
  buckling their revolver belts as they came. As he looked, he leapt back in
  time. A shot went through the second of the portholes, and a splinter of
  glass cut his cheek. The third port went the same way, and almost immediately
  three rifle barrels were thrust through. They dropped to cover under the
  protecting steel wall of the deckhouse, and as the guns exploded Cliff
  gripped the barrel nearest to him and jerked it inside. With his free hand he
  grabbed the girl and drew her to him.</p>

  <p>"Lie very quiet," he said. "You'll be perfectly safe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At this moment the door was flung wide, and with a scream the old Amah
  fled through, to everybody's relief. A second later a black object appeared
  at the edge of the doorway, and even as Clifford Lynne pulled the trigger he
  realized that it was only a mophead.</p>

  <p>"Steady your arm, Cliff," warned Joe Bray. He had a gun in each hand, but
  as yet he had not wasted a shot. "They're drawing our fire. We've got no
  other ammunition than what's in the gun, have we?"</p>

  <p>Clifford shook his head. Outside they could hear Fing-Su jabbering orders,
  and a lower but more authoritative voice which, Clifford guessed, was that of
  the captain of the ship&mdash;another Negro, Clifford was to learn, and the
  only other member of the ship's company beside the purser who was not
  Chinese.</p>

  <p>The rifles were suddenly withdrawn from the broken portholes and they
  heard something being dragged along the deck, and the alleyway door was
  slammed tight.</p>

  <p>"Get in the inner room," shouted Willing, and pushing the girl before him,
  Clifford reached sanctuary as the brass nozzle of a great hose was thrust
  through one of the broken portholes.</p>

  <p>Instantly the room hissed with the furious rush of water, and Clifford
  made a hasty reconnaissance. There was no outlet to the water; the
  ventilators would hardly drain off a gallon a minute. A second nozzle had
  appeared and the water was already ankle-deep. Soon it swelled over the ledge
  of the inner door; and by this time two more hoses were at work.</p>

  <p>Clifford made a rough calculation and grinned. Long before the water
  reached the level of the portholes something would happen. He remembered
  enough of his school mathematics to know that the factor of metacentric
  height would come into operation.</p>

  <p>Higher and higher the water came. Some little escaped through the
  ventilators and the crevices between door and doorway, but the inrush was so
  heavy and continuous that it was only a question of time now before Fing-Su
  had the fright of his life.</p>

  <p>"Lynne!" It was Fing-Su who was shouting. "Throw out your arms and you'll
  be treated fairly. I'll put you all ashore."</p>

  <p>Clifford Lynne did not answer. He wanted one glimpse of that face, only
  for the fraction of a second. Suddenly, caught in the trough of a sea, the
  <i>Umveli</i> gave a great lurch to starboard and the water splashed and
  gurgled up to the neck of Joe Bray, who was standing by the starboard
  bulkhead. For a long time the vessel lay over on her side and only very
  slowly righted herself. The moving weight of sixty tons of water was making
  itself felt.</p>

  <p>They heard excited voices outside, and one by one the hoses were pulled
  back and the flow of water ceased. There came a hammering at the door; under
  the weight of the water it burst open with a report like a gun, and the water
  poured out in a solid stream.</p>

  <p>"Too much weight on deck has made her unwieldy," said Lynne under his
  breath. "The skipper's scared of it&mdash;I thought this would happen!"</p>

  <p>Presumably his view was accurate, for the hoses did not come back. Again
  Fing-Su's voice:</p>

  <p>"Let Mr Bray come out; I'll talk with him," he said. "But he must come
  without arms."</p>

  <p>There was a brief consultation, and Joe surrendered his pistols to his
  partner and stepped out upon that wet deck.</p>

  <p>Fing-Su was standing in the cover of a big bale of Manchester goods, a
  revolver in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Put your gun down, you five-cash Chink!" snarled Joe. "And stop theatre
  playin' for once in your life, you poor heathen!"</p>

  <p>Fing-Su slipped the pistol into the holster at his side.</p>

  <p>"Mr Bray," he began, "there is no need for recriminations&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cut out all that college talk, you dam' coolie thief!" said the old man.
  "Put this ship about and save your skinny neck from the rope!"</p>

  <p>Fing-Su smiled.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, that is impossible," he said. "We have dropped the pilot,
  figuratively and literally&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quit talking like a Rhodes scholar!" roared Joe, and suddenly broke into
  voluble Chinese, which is a language peculiarly designed for one who desires
  to be offensive. Fing-Su listened unmoved to the torrent of abuse, and, when
  Joe had talked himself out of breath:</p>

  <p>"We are wasting time, Mr Bray. Persuade your friends to give up their
  weapons, and no harm shall come to them. Otherwise, I can starve you out. I
  have no desire to hurt Joan&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Miss Bray," snapped Joe, his face crimson with fury. Chinese came
  naturally to Joe, who had lived most of his life in the country, and the
  coolies grouped around Fing-Su who understood the language shuddered as they
  listened. But he might have been passing the most delicate compliments for
  all the notice the Chinaman took.</p>

  <p>He was wearing semi-nautical attire: white duck trousers, a blue reefer
  coat with innumerable gold rings about the cuffs, and a large officer's cap
  around which ran a broad band of gold braid.</p>

  <p>"You are a very foolish and vulgar man," he said calmly. "But it is not
  for me to reproach you with your lack of breeding. Go back to your friends
  and deliver my messages."</p>

  <p>For a second it looked as though Joe Bray had a personal message of his
  own to deliver with his great shoulder-of-mutton fist, but Fing-Su's revolver
  covered him, and with a final flow of vituperation he made his way back to
  his companions in distress.</p>

  <p>"He's got a dozen armed men with him," he reported, "and he's going to
  starve us out. Cliff, when I think of how easy I could have smothered that
  kid when he was a baby, I almost give up talkin' to myself!"</p>

  <p>"Is Fing-Su in charge of the ship?"</p>

  <p>"There's a captain," said Joe. "A coon&mdash;he's got up like the Darktown
  Band, with gold lace an' everything. But he's nobody. The big noise is
  Fing-Su."</p>

  <p>"Mr Bray, who was the man that was brought to the ship at the same time as
  I?" asked Joan, and they learnt for the first time that there was yet another
  prisoner on the <i>Umveli</i>.</p>

  <p>Clifford agreed that it was hardly likely to be Spedwell. He had his own
  suspicions, but as it happened they were wrong, for Ferdinand Leggat lay in a
  deep pit that had been dug under the factory wall by lantern light.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch37"
     id="ch37">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Whilst they held a council of war, Fing-Su went up to his
  cabin, and on his instructions they brought the pitiable wreck of a man from
  the dark hold where he had been stowed. Stephen Narth, in the ruined finery
  of the night before, collarless, grimy of face, unshaven, might well have
  passed unrecognized by his nearest friend. A shuddering night had had its
  effect upon him. But he was sane enough, though, as the Chinaman saw, on the
  verge of a breakdown.</p>

  <p>"Why did you bring me on this ship?" he asked hollowly. "That's not
  playing the game, Fing-Su. Where is that swine Spedwell?"</p>

  <p>Fing-Su would have given a lot to have been able to answer.</p>

  <p>Spedwell had escaped, but self-interest would keep him silent. He had
  always hated Spedwell, with his air of mastership and his superior smile;
  hated him worse than the drunken Leggat. Spedwell had been a useful teacher;
  from him the Chinaman had imbibed certain vital knowledge. He was a very
  receptive man, gifted by nature with a rapid acquisition of learning; though
  in his collegiate days he had not touched military studies, he had learnt
  much from Spedwell in the year of their acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"I haven't the slightest idea where he is," he said, "and I shall never
  forgive him for the death of poor Leggat."</p>

  <p>Narth stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Then it was his idea?"</p>

  <p>"Entirely," said Fing-Su gravely. He was a glib and plausible liar, and
  Narth was in a state of mind when he was prepared to accept any version of
  the horror that exculpated himself.</p>

  <p>In a few sentences Fing-Su gave an account of the initiation which brought
  a moderate comfort to the conscience-stricken man. And then the Chinaman
  broke his important news.</p>

  <p>"Here? On board? Joan?" gasped Narth. "But how did she come here? And what
  is Lynne doing on board this ship?"</p>

  <p>"That is what I want to know," said Fing-Su rapidly. "Go down and talk to
  them. Point out the folly of resistance; promise them on my word that no harm
  shall come to them, and that I will give them the best accommodation on the
  ship and land them at Bordeaux, if they will agree to give me no further
  trouble."</p>

  <p>He elaborated this message at length, and five minutes later Clifford
  Lynne, from his observation post, saw a dilapidated figure stagger into the
  cabin and recognized him. So this was the moaning stranger! What had happened
  to Leggat? he wondered.</p>

  <p>He listened in silence to Stephen's proposal, then shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'd sooner take my chance with a life-sized shark," he said. "Go back to
  Fing-Su and tell him that he'll neither drown us out nor starve us out, and
  that the day we touch land, and I am free, he will be a prisoner waiting his
  trial for murder."</p>

  <p>"What's the use of quarrelling with him?" wailed Narth.</p>

  <p>His nerve had gone. Never a strong man, he was a pitiable snadow of the
  man Clifford had known.</p>

  <p>"Is Leggat on board?" asked Clifford, as he remembered.</p>

  <p>Narth shook his hanging head and began to whisper something that only the
  South African's keen ears caught.</p>

  <p>"Dead?" he said incredulously. "Did Fing-Su kill him?"</p>

  <p>But before he had ended the question, Stephen Narth had run out of the
  room like a man demented.</p>

  <p>Their position was a perilous one. Already the land was slipping out of
  view, and unless a miracle interposed there was no alternative between
  starvation and surrender&mdash;and what surrender would mean to Joan Bray,
  Clifford could guess.</p>

  <p>Immediately after Stephen Narth's departure the door to the alleyway had
  been closed and locked and, at Willing's suggestion, the heavy deadlights
  which covered the portholes were dropped and screwed into their places. This
  deprived them of a view of the forepart of the ship and curtailed the air
  supply, but the cabin was bearable, especially now they had got rid of the
  yellow Amah.</p>

  <p>At this moment of supreme danger Clifford could only wonder at the calm
  and serenity of the girl. She was, it seemed, the most cheerful of the party,
  and although the pangs of hunger were beginning to make themselves felt, she
  neither complained nor, by so much as a look or gesture, added to the
  unhappiness of the party.</p>

  <p>The prospect of any prolonged stay in this confined space was an appalling
  one. Then he thought of the girl. Happily they would not be short of fresh
  water, for that in the little shower which had been fixed in the
  washing-place was fresh, if a little brackish. Clifford tried the inner
  bulkhead door, but it was unyielding.</p>

  <p>"It probably leads to the officers' quarters," said Willing.</p>

  <p>Joe Bray looked at the door thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"We can't get out, but they can get in," he said. "We'd better put up a
  barricade, or they'll be taking us in the rear, Cliff. When I think of that
  poor girl&mdash;" he said, and choked.</p>

  <p>"Which poor girl?" asked Clifford.</p>

  <p>For the moment he had forgotten the existence of Mabel.</p>

  <p>They left Joan to the occupation of her little bedroom, and gathered about
  the table in the larger cabin. The search they had made for food had produced
  not so much as a ship's biscuit, though Willing had thought that a large
  black box in the girl's sleeping-room might contain emergency rations. Their
  efforts to open or move the chest, however, were unavailing.</p>

  <p>Then Joe had discovered in his coat pocket a cake of chocolate, and half
  of this had gone to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Usually," said Joe plaintively, "I've half a dozen cakes, because
  naturally I've a sweet tooth. What I'd like now is a boiled fowl with
  dumplings&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for goodness' sake, shut up!" growled Willing.</p>

  <p>They tried to play games to pass the time, but this effort at cheerfulness
  was a dismal failure.</p>

  <p>Six o'clock&mdash;seven o'clock came and went. The girl had been sleeping
  when Clifford looked in. He had closed the door so that their voices should
  not disturb her. Suddenly it was pulled open and Joan appeared in the doorway
  with a startled expression on her white face.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Clifford, springing towards her.</p>

  <p>She lowered her voice.</p>

  <p>"Somebody is tapping on that door," she said. She pointed to the bulkhead
  door, and Lynne kept close and listened.</p>

  <p>Tap, tap, tap!</p>

  <p>It was repeated again. Then he heard the soft grind of a bolt being drawn,
  and waited, pistol in hand.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," whispered a voice. "Don't shout or they'll hear
  you."</p>

  <p>The door opened another inch, and then wide enough to show a black face
  surmounted by the soiled cap of one of the ship's officers.</p>

  <p>"I'm Haki, the purser," he whispered, and his hand came round holding a
  small canvas bag. "If Fing-Su knows this I'm finished," he added urgently,
  and immediately closed the door and pushed home the bolt.</p>

  <p>In that brief moment of time Clifford saw that the detective's theory had
  been an accurate one. He looked down a dirty alleyway from which doors
  opened, and he had a glimpse of an untidy cabin that opened from the passage.
  Carrying the bag to the outer cabin, he shook out its contents: a dozen
  rolls, nearly new, a large chunk of cheese, and a piece of salted beef fell
  on the table. Clifford broke a roll suspiciously and examined it under the
  light.</p>

  <p>"We've got to take the risk," he said. "I'll eat some first, and in half
  an hour, if nothing happens to me, we'll have a dinner that will beat the
  Ritz."</p>

  <p>He cut a slice of the meat, tasted the cheese and the bread, and felt a
  brute as he saw the famished eyes of his companions fixed on him. The half
  hour passed, and then he brought the girl from the cabin and with their
  penknives they carved a meal for her.</p>

  <p>"We've one friend on board, anyway," grunted Willing. "What nationality
  was that chap?"</p>

  <p>Clifford had spent two years of his youth on the African coast.</p>

  <p>"Kroo. They're not bad fellows, though they're constitutional thieves," he
  said.</p>

  <p>They put aside a portion of the meal for the morning, and at his earnest
  solicitation Joan lay down again and fell into a troubled sleep. She did not
  hear the stealthy tap at the bulkhead, but Clifford, seated near the
  half-closed door of her cabin, detected the signal and crept in without
  waking her. Again the door opened.</p>

  <p>"Everybody on the ship's drunk," said the black-faced officer, in a
  matter-of-fact tone, as though he were describing a very ordinary part of the
  ship's routine. "The skipper's scared of them finding this door. They may try
  to rush you later; you've got to be prepared for that. If they don't, I'll be
  here at six bells, and you be ready to skip, mister."</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?" asked Clifford.</p>

  <p>The man looked back down the alleyway before he answered.</p>

  <p>"Gun-running's nothing, but murder's big trouble," he said. "The skipper
  thinks so too."</p>

  <p>"Who has been murdered?"</p>

  <p>The man did not reply at once, but closed the door hurriedly, and it was
  nearly half an hour before he returned.</p>

  <p>"I heard the officer of the watch coming down," he said, in the same
  conversational tone. "These Chinks often do that&mdash;leave the bridge in
  the middle of the Channel, eh? He's the limit! It seems to me about time we
  quit this business. It was that mad fellow that was killed. He came aboard
  with the young lady last night."</p>

  <p>"Narth?" whispered Clifford in horror.</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Sure. He got fresh with Fing-Su, and the Chink handed him one with a
  bottle. They chucked him overboard just after I brought you your eats."</p>

  <p>He looked round again and then gave them a piece of vital information.</p>

  <p>"The skipper and two of the hands are getting the lifeboat down round
  about six bells," he whispered. "You'll have to slide down a rope for it. Can
  the young lady make it?"</p>

  <p>"She'll make it all right," said Clifford and the door closed.</p>

  <p>What was happening, he could guess. Ever since that mad dream of empire
  had come to Fing-Su he had had the advantage of expert advice. Leggat in his
  way was clever; Spedwell in his own particular line was brilliant; both were
  cautious men, for whose judgment the Chinese millionaire had respect. But now
  Fing-Su had no master but his own whims; his judgment was governed only by
  his muddled philosophy.</p>

  <p>The hours of waiting seemed interminable. They sat around in the little
  cabin, not daring to speak for fear they should miss the signal, or be caught
  by the 'rush' which the purser had predicted. So slowly did the hands of his
  watch move that Clifford once or twice thought it had stopped.</p>

  <p>Three o'clock passed; the clang of the timing bell came faintly through
  the protected portholes, and then there was a tap at the door and it was
  swung open on its hinge. The purser, in heavy sea-boots, a revolver belt
  about his waist, was waiting, and he beckoned them. Clifford followed,
  holding the girl's hand in his, Joe Bray bringing up the rear, a gun in each
  hand and a partiality for violence in his heart.</p>

  <p>They had to pass a lighted galley, and their guide put his finger on his
  lips to enjoin quietness. Joan had a glimpse of the broad back of the Chinese
  cook stooping over a steaming pot, and came safely and unobserved to the
  after well deck.</p>

  <p>Two steel doors in the ship's side had been opened. Over the edge of the
  deck was a taut rope, and looking down, Clifford saw that the rope was
  attached to a large whale-boat in which three muffled men were sitting. He
  turned to the girl, his lips to her ear.</p>

  <p>"Will you dare go down that rope hand over hand?"</p>

  <p>As the purser passed a slender line about the girl's waist and knotted it,
  he said in a low voice:</p>

  <p>"Don't waste time... I had a radio in the night." He did not explain what
  this had to do with the escape, but addressed the girl. "You'll have to go
  down hand-over-hand miss," he whispered, and she nodded, and whilst they held
  the safety line she slid slowly down the rough rope that cut and scorched her
  fingers.</p>

  <p>The whale-boat held to the ship's side seemed to be racing along at an
  incredible speed, though it was going no faster than the steamer. Somebody
  reached up and caught her unceremoniously by the waist and dragged her into
  the boat. Joe Bray followed, and justified his claim to youth by the agility
  with which he went down hand-over-hand in the dark. The purser was the last
  to leave the ship, and scrambled over the bow of the whale-boat with
  incredible ease.</p>

  <p>"Stand by!" said a thick voice.</p>

  <p>The purser groped in the bottom of the boat, found an axe, and with one
  blow severed the rope. In an instant they were in the maelstrom of the ship's
  wake, rocking and tossing from side to side, and only by the narrowest margin
  did they avoid capsizing, for the iron side of the <i>Umveli</i> grazed the
  rudder-post. And then, as the whale-boat rocked free, they heard a yell, a
  light flashed from the bridge; clear above the gurgle of the water and the
  thud of the retreating screw they heard a whistle blow, and the <i>Umveli</i>
  swung round in a circle.</p>

  <p>"They've seen us," said Clifford between his teeth.</p>

  <p>The purser, grinning with fear, glared back at the circling vessel and
  grunted. Turning, he ran to the middle of the boat and assisted one of the
  black sailors to step the mast. The Negro captain, a grotesque figure in his
  gold-bound cap and gaudy badges of rank, was pulling desperately at the sail.
  A fresh north-easter was blowing, and in another second the whale-boat lay
  over and was running into the wind. But what hope had they of escaping from a
  fifteen-knots steamer?</p>

  <p>A thunderous blast from the ship's siren directed their attention to their
  monstrous pursuer. From the bridge came the flicker of a signal lamp, and the
  captain spelt it out.</p>

  <p>"Yeller nigger!" was his only comment; he, for his part, was the blackest
  man that Clifford had ever met.</p>

  <p>The whale-boat tacked about. Obviously he was more hopeful than one of the
  watchers. Clifford sank down on his knees by the side of the girl, who lay
  covered with a tarpaulin in the bottom of the boat.</p>

  <p>"Not scared, are you, honey?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She looked up with a smile, and that was all the answer he needed.</p>

  <p>The captain's English was the English of the coast, but it was both
  expressive and illuminating.</p>

  <p>"Elephant no catchum flea," he said. "Big ship she no catchum little boat!
  S'pose they lower dem cutter onetimes dem cutter she no catchum
  sail-boat."</p>

  <p>"There is danger enough, captain."</p>

  <p>The broad-faced man shook his head in assent.</p>

  <p>"Presently they done bring them ha-ha guns," he said, "but by and by we
  see anudder ship."</p>

  <p>That was their hope. They were still in the English Channel, which is the
  main street of Northern Europe. Here the traffic is usually thick. But for
  the moment there was no sign of smoke or sail.</p>

  <p>Clifford turned to the purser.</p>

  <p>"Whether we escape or not, I owe you something, my friend," he said, and
  Haki smiled broadly.</p>

  <p>"We ought to have got away before," he said, "but the captain was scared.
  But the radio made him skip!"</p>

  <p>"The radio?"</p>

  <p>The purser put his hand in his pocket and took out a soiled scrap of
  paper.</p>

  <p>"I got this last night," he said, and Clifford read the scribbled words
  with difficulty:</p>

  <p>Get away from ship before seven o'clock. Take with you anybody who value
  lives. If Miss Bray aboard take her with you. Admiralty sending destroyer
  Sunbright to overhaul you. Soldier.</p>

  <p>"That's the Major&mdash;we called him 'Soldier,'" explained the purser.
  "But the Sunbright mightn't catch us&mdash;and if they did, Fing-Su wouldn't
  leave anybody alive who could tell on him."</p>

  <p>Clifford had been puzzled as to what the captain meant by 'ha-ha gun,' but
  very soon came an unpleasant explanation.</p>

  <p><i>Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!</i></p>

  <p>They had brought a maxim-gun into action. The bullets threw up a cloud of
  spray a little ahead of them, and the skipper pushed over the helm and went
  about on another tack. They were less than five hundred yards from the ship's
  side, Cliff realized, which meant that it would be a comparatively simple
  matter, once the light grew stronger&mdash;and it was improving every
  second&mdash;to riddle the boat with shots. Fing-Su would leave no trace of
  the men in whose hands was his very life.</p>

  <p><i>Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!</i></p>

  <p>This time the aim was high; the bullets smacked through the canvas of the
  sail. One sent a splinter of wood flying from the mast.</p>

  <p>"Keep down!" yelled the purser, waving frantically.</p>

  <p>For the third time since they escaped he looked at his big silver
  watch.</p>

  <p>The <i>Umveli</i> had increased speed and was now running abreast and
  bearing in upon them. Again the Negro captain tacked and came round in a
  circle, running back on his own course. Individual marksmen were now firing,
  and the bullets were coming uncomfortably close. And above the 'click-clock'
  of rifles came the boom of a heavier weapon.</p>

  <p>"Seven-pounder," said Joe Bray laconically, and even as he spoke something
  smacked against the mast.</p>

  <p>There was a crackling and tearing sound, and mast and sail went limply
  over the side.</p>

  <p>"Now we're finished, I think," said the purser, and with great sang-froid
  took his revolver from the holster at his waist and turned the cylinder.</p>

  <p>They were lowering boats now from the <i>Umveli</i>. Three, one after the
  other, struck the water. She had reduced speed and was going astern. But the
  captain was by no means beaten. With the aid of one of his sailors he had
  flung mast and sail overboard, and in another instant the oars rattled into
  rowlocks.</p>

  <p>"All mans pull!" he roared, and Clifford obeyed the injunction.</p>

  <p>But the whale-boat was big and cumbersome compared with the light cutters
  that were pursuing them.</p>

  <p>"We want a miracle," said Cliff, and as he spoke the miracle happened.</p>

  <p>Two boats were already pushing off from the ship; the third was filling
  with sailors, when from the lower deck came a brilliant flame and the
  deafening crash of an explosion; it was followed almost instantly by a second
  and louder explosion.</p>

  <p>For a second there was silence, and then a pandemonium of whistles
  sounded. The two boats which had already pulled off turned and headed for the
  ship. Smoke poured along the decks so dense that it obscured a view of her
  funnel in the early morning light.</p>

  <p>"She blow up what for?" asked the black skipper huskily, and then: "Pull,
  you mans!"</p>

  <p>And the oars rose and fell. Then, of a sudden:</p>

  <p>"She's sinking," gasped Joe Bray, and he spoke the truth.</p>

  <p>Half a hundredweight of the most powerful explosive, which the ingenious
  Major Spedwell had timed to explode twenty-four hours after the ship had
  sailed, had not only blown a hole through the deck, but had ignited the
  munitions stored in the hold. The Umveli lay over on her side like something
  grown suddenly weary. Dense masses of smoke poured out of the exposed
  hatches; they saw the gleam of flames, and then a wild scramble for the
  boats. In their amazement they rested on their oars, watching the strange
  sight, until the purser's voice uttered a warning.</p>

  <p>"We'd better get as far away from the ship as we can," he cried.</p>

  <p>A few seconds after he spoke there was a third explosion, and the
  <i>Umveli</i> broke in half and went jaggedly out of sight in a wild
  confusion of foaming waters.</p>

  <p>There were four boats afloat, and they were heading in their
  direction.</p>

  <p>"Row!" yelled the skipper, and again they gripped the oars.</p>

  <p>But their effort was not to be sustained. Turning his head, Clifford Lynne
  saw a black billow of smoke on the right side of the horizon, and could just
  distinguish in the dawn light a long grey shape...</p>

  <p>They reached His Britannic Majesty's destroyer <i>Sunbright</i>
  twenty-five minutes before the remnant of a fear-maddened crew came to the
  destroyer's side, throwing their rifles in the water, offering everything for
  safety.</p>

  <p>Fing-Su was not amongst the party, and when Clifford interviewed one of
  the shivering officers he learnt of the Emperor's fate in a few pungent
  words.</p>

  <p>"Fing-Su... I saw his head... and his body... a little piece here, a
  little piece there."</p>

  <p class="first">Eight months later, Mr Joe Bray brought a bride to his
  quaint house on the hills above Siangtan. In the marriage register he had
  been described as 'Joseph Henry Bray, bachelor.'</p>

  <p>"And I might tell you," said Clifford ominously, "that men have got penal
  servitude in this country for making false statements on their marriage
  certificates."</p>

  <p>To his orphaned bride Joe suggested a cause for Clifford Lynne's
  implacable hostility.</p>

  <p>"Me being so young makes him look old," he suggested; and Mabel was in
  complete agreement, for she had spent that particular morning in the Rue de
  la Paix and had gathered to herself many wonderful possessions that only a
  millionaire can bestow upon his wife.</p>

  <p>"The difference," said Joe complacently, as he drew through a straw the
  luscious drink with which a waiter (privately instructed) had provided
  him&mdash;"the difference between our marriage and his is this, Mabel: ours
  is a love match, and his is, so to speak&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He would never have married Joan but you told him to," said Mabel
  scornfully. "I hope Joan will be happy. I have my doubts, but I hope she will
  be."</p>

  <p>Mabel went to Siangtan, and had a reception from the European inhabitants
  of that noble town that was due to one who bore a family relationship with
  the Concession. And, curiously enough, she liked Siangtan, for it is better
  to be a great person in a small place than a nobody in Sunningdale.</p>

  <p>One day there came to them a letter from Joan which suggested that the
  unhappiness of marriage was an experience to be indefinitely postponed. Mabel
  read the letter and sniffed, not uncharitably.</p>

  <p>"'Carrying on the line'? What does she mean by that?" she asked, having
  her suspicions.</p>

  <p>Joe coughed and explained.</p>

  <p>"That was my idea too," he said modestly.</p>
