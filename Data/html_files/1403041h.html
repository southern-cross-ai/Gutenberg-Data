<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>Impressions of that immense country generally referred to as the
Inland vary markedly with each visit. I have had four trips into
the centre of it and have gathered just about enough knowledge to
show me the folly of being dogmatic. Its very size makes judgment
hazardous. A cattle-station there may be greater than a European
country; one in the north-west contains nine and a quarter million
acres. I came one day to a more southern station the area of which
was several thousand square miles. "Where are your men?" I asked.
"Down the paddock," returned the manager. "Whereabouts?" I
continued. "About seventy miles away!" was the staggering reply.
Another man, the lessee himself this time, told me that his front
gate was, in a direct line, eighty miles from his front door.</p>

<p>In those vast spaces the observer, if he is not altogether
egoist, feels himself reduced to the insignificance of an ant.
Kipling has said that an admiral knows a midshipman much as the
Almighty knows a black beetle. Stand on one of those seemingly
boundless gibber plains, the horizon of the whole circle as
unbroken as if you were far out on the ocean, stand there if you
wish to know your own proportion in the scale of the visible
world.</p>

<p>England and Wales together contain less than 60,000 square
miles, France has 213,000, all Germany is no more than 184,000; our
Northern Territory alone has 523,000 square miles. In area the
closest match for Australia, as a whole, are the United States of
America with their 3,027,000 square miles to the Commonwealth's
2,975,000.</p>

<p>Who then is going to say he knows all Australia sufficiently
well to write with authority about its scenery, its life, its past,
its future? Certainly not the visitor from abroad, the typical
tourist who remarks, "Paris? Yes, we did Paris. We spent ten hours
in Paris!"</p>

<p>So, despite my six months' residence in the Inland and the
travelling I have done there, I claim no more for these notes than
that they are first-hand impressions by one who has moved much
about his native land, loving it more the more he sees of it,
hoping that some day this "last Sea-thing dredged by Sailor Time
from Space" will solve all its problems, not the least being the
effective settlement of the great spaces of Central Australia.</p>

<h2><a name="c1" id="c1"></a>CHAPTER I. FIRST IMPRESSIONS</h2>

<p>My first Inland trip was made in 1929, my latest (I will not say
last) in 1934. Between those I managed to squeeze in a shorter
journey, as far as Marree, in 1930, and another, the longest of
all, in 1933. I have seen the land resting in the arms of a five
years' drought and I have seen it working overtime in production
after satisfactory rains. To take the experiences of a single visit
as typical of Central Australian conditions is to accept a solitary
brick as a picture of the house it was taken from. Read the
accounts by the early explorers: where one found a sandy or stony
desert and lost his cattle through want of feed, the next lost his
beasts in amazing growths of herbage. The term "desert" has been
too freely applied to much of this country. No place is a desert
(in the generally accepted meaning of that word) which will produce
a plentiful vegetation after rain, and a great deal of the Inland,
given moisture, is amazingly prolific.</p>

<p>In 1929 Professor Porteus and I saw what a practically rainless
five years could do. The sight was a dreadful one. It was, as I
remarked at the time, as though Life had taken one look at the
place and gone away again. Porteus, fresh from the lushness of
Hawaii, thought it would be well if rain never fell here again, for
then no one would be tempted to stay in such a spot. We counted
eighty-four dead cattle on the margin of a small depression which
had once contained water. Each carcass was complete save that
hollow sockets represented the eyes&mdash;it was a desiccated hide
containing a skeleton.</p>

<p>The crow, ever hungry, ever crying his woes aloud, seemed to
proclaim himself the only creature to survive. "What that pfella
crow eat?" I inquired of an Arunta native. "Eatem bone!" came the
response.</p>

<p>But even in those appalling conditions the white settlers hung
to their holdings, their diet mostly hope. Apart from the fact, the
all-important fact, that rain will assuredly come again and with it
probably prosperity, apart from this and the even more pregnant
matter that to desert the holding may be to abandon every penny of
one's capital, there is frequently a genuine affection (that is not
too strong a term) for this stern land, an affection the basis of
which is difficult indeed to define. Those limitless plains, the
changing mirage for ever playing on their edges, the scarlet
sand-hills against the powdered blue of the great mountains, the
thousand-mile rivers of sand, the clarity of the air, the amazing
sense of space&mdash;these produce that strange fascination which
many a visitor, no less than the permanent resident, has felt and
must continue to feel. Professor Gregory, in his <i>Dead Heart of
Australia,</i> confesses to knowing it: a winter never passes but I
personally am restless under the urge to return.</p>

<p>On that 1929 trip I summarized my first impressions as I gazed
at the scene. We stood on the bank of a dry river. "The last time
we had rain enough to see it run," said the local man, "was in
1921. I dug a tank then. It's still empty!"</p>

<p>Seven years of drought!</p>

<p>I looked round at the loose red sand which rose and fell in
billowy ridges, like waves, until it merged into the skyline. I
noted the few stunted ashen-grey bushes which punctuated these
blank pages where seemingly no living thing had written a single
other character, and I marvelled that man had ever bothered to come
to so obvious a desert.</p>

<i>Red-Gums in Bed of the Todd River, Alice Springs</i>
</p>

<p>"Does anything ever grow here?" I asked. The question was purely
rhetorical, but it brought a reply. "Grow here!" It was a younger
man who spoke. "Grow here!" He waxed suddenly enthusiastic. "I've
seen it in a good year with herbage that high" (he hit his thigh).
"Beautiful! You'd have wanted to get down and have a feed of it
yourself!"</p>

<p>And those extremes seem fairly to represent the so-called "dead
heart."</p>

<p>It had been raining at Quorn, that sturdy little town where the
Central Australian railway leaves the east-west line, but from
there on to Oodnadatta the land was a waste. For hundreds of miles
the plains lay bare as a sandy beach at low tide, or at best
stippled with dust-coloured spinifex or its like. It was then that
my professorial friend from abroad remarked that men should not be
encouraged to try to settle here at all.</p>

<p>The outlook certainly justified the thought. But this country is
such a mass of contradictions that one can understand a man, once
in it, being reluctant to leave. The gambling element, so strong in
most of us, comes into play. At the moment of writing, despite the
fact that feed had disappeared altogether from such a huge stretch
of country, fat cattle were being entrained at Alice Springs,
itself as dry as a bone, and certain graziers were doing well out
of the prices the animals were bringing. Their good fortune lay in
the fact that a smart fall of rain had occurred some sixty odd
miles east of "the Alice" and their properties were lucky enough to
share it.</p>

<p>Outside that area the tale was one of ruin and despair, of herds
destroyed, of living made almost impossible. The loss in cattle
must have been enormous. The Finke River Mission had 3000 head at
the beginning of the drought; at the end it had a dwindling 200. On
a small flat near one of the rare springs lay numbers of carcasses.
Queer, ghastly things they were, which had once been cattle. A
moistureless air had mummified them.</p>

<p>On the Rudner Plain, out towards the Glen Helen Gorge, a grim
humorist had lifted a horse and leaned it against a tree, where it
stood like a figure from an Australian Dance of Death. Its grinning
head was twisted round as if it watched you; but there were no eyes
in the sockets which stared so fixedly across the sandy wastes.</p>

<p>The crows must have fed full earlier in the drought; now they
looked as ravenous as the rest of the living things in this
rainless region, including man.</p>

<p>"Hangry!" said a naked Luritja, passing his hand across his
stomach. He meant hungry. It was his one English word.</p>

<p>They tell you tales here of how the herbage grows when the rain
comes, of how the Finke rose in 1924 and all but swept away the
Hermannsburg Mission buildings, of the natives waxing fat on euro
and wallaby and rabbit (the rabbit has come as far as this); and
you watch the shifting sands where no wild thing moves, you gaze at
the depression which is the dry bed of the river, and you wonder if
it can be true.</p>

<p>Bright day succeeds bright day, the nights are fresh, the dawns
as lovely as one could wish, the sunsets a rich yellowing of the
cloudless horizon. Every morning the south-east wind goes about its
business of making sand ridges, the Hermannsberg glows red in the
sun; there is no suggestion that rain has ever fallen in this
wilderness.</p>

<p>And, to complete the picture, across the Missionary Plain comes,
slow pacing, a train of forty camels with tinkling bells and
Mahomet Ali leading the way.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c2" id="c2"></a>CHAPTER II &mdash; OLD MAN RIVER</h2>

<p>But the long-delayed rain must come at last and Old Man River be
alive again. I caught myself singing at the thought of it:</p>

<p class="poem">Ol' Man River,<br>
That of man River,<br>
He must know somethin',<br>
But don't say nothin',<br>
He just keeps rollin',<br>
He keeps on rollin'<br>
Along!</p>

<p>Yes! the Finke is running! And what does that mean to most of
the seven million (or so) inhabitants of the continent it runs in?
Nothing at all, for Australians generally do not know that such a
river exists.</p>

<p>Yet it is the largest watercourse in Central Australia and its
behaviour is of vital interest to those white people who have
settled near it, to say nothing of many native tribes. The Arunta
nation called it Larapinta, meaning "flowing water," and Baldwin
Spencer suggested that a fitting name for Central Australia would
be Larapinta Land.</p>

<p>J. J. Waldron, who did a great deal of exploratory work in that
region, estimates the length of the Finke as at least a thousand
miles, but states that the whole of its course has never been
followed. Surely no more extraordinary stream exists. The geologist
may know the reason, but to the layman it is hard to understand why
a river should run at a chain of mountains instead of from it. The
Finke is like the Irishman of legend&mdash;wherever it sees a head
it hits it! Rising to the north of the Macdonnell Ranges, that
great east to west barrier, the Finke accepts the challenge, hurls
itself at the most formidable parts and eventually emerges on the
south side through gorges of great beauty which it has cut in
passing.</p>

<p>Then it wanders off into the wilderness and, as an aviator
reported recently, "when last seen it was heading for Lake
Eyre."</p>

<p>When I first stood in the bed of the Finke at Hermannsburg it
held everything a river should have, except water. No Sahara was
ever drier than this wide, irregular depression paved with sand and
stones. On the high banks and on scattered ridges grew some fine
red-gums. Flood-marks showed here and there, but not a drop of
moisture&mdash;the last rain had fallen years before! The nearest
water was five miles away at the Korporilya Spring. It doubtless
supplied the few small birds which twittered in the trees, and the
crows which cawed perpetually about the mission station.</p>

<p>"You eatem crow?" I asked one of the Arunta tribe. "<i>Aua,</i>"
he replied, signifying that he did, when he could catch them. They
looked anything but edible; I felt like the American who said he
could eat crow but he "didn't hanker arter it."</p>

<p>It was from the bed of the Finke, where I was watching the
ceremonial dances of a group of naked Luritjas, that I was suddenly
transported to childhood days in a Victorian country town. Through
the monotonous chant of the old men, and the clack of the sticks
and stones with which they were beating time, came breaking in the
liquid "tip-tip-top-of-the-wattle" of a Crested Bell-bird's
song.</p>

<p>At the famous Glen Helen Gorge, too, the magic carpet of memory
operated once more at the call of a bird. The Finke has formed a
deep brackish pool there by the foot of tall cliffs&mdash;so deep
that even a five years' drought could not exhaust it. A bunch of
reeds grows at the edge and, as we paused, a Reed Warbler gave
voice, at our very feet, to that wild, compelling song of his, all
rapture, that may be heard any spring by the Henley lawn on the
Yarra near Melbourne.</p>

<p>A third bird-note was also a home voice in strange surroundings.
That wonder-spot of the Centre, Palm Valley, is, we are told, a
reminder that once upon a time climatic conditions were very
different in the heart of Australia from what we know to-day.
Exploring its delightful groves and luxuriating in its pools of
fresh water under tropical growths we saw the flutter of a wing and
next moment came the melody of Harmonica, the grey thrush of our
Victorian bush, or a very close relative.</p>

<p>To reach that valley we followed the Finke in its cutting
through the James Range and later, on camels, travelled down its
bed for a good many miles. Save in the Valley, nowhere was there
water; but in the long windings between the hills were numberless
places suitable, it would seem, for embankments to conserve
supplies of the precious liquid when rain actually came and the
river was a river in something more than name. Water conservation
is surely the cure for most of the serious troubles of the
Centre.</p>

<p>Our camels paced solemnly along, making us marvel at the
toughness of their lips and tongues as they snatched mouthfuls of
thorny bushes, and slowly the panorama unfolded of sand and stones
under high cliffs weathered into the quaintest shapes. Here was
mulga, there a hillside of spinifex with good samples of eucalypts,
their size suggesting that somewhere below the arid surface lay
nourishment to their liking. At the entrances to gullies between
Palm Valley and the Glen of Palms were occasional sentinels or
groups of <i>Livistona Mariae,</i> the palm peculiar to these
regions, and the smaller Zamia palm frequently hung from rocky
crevices. A few fig-trees made a change of green at a crossing.</p>

<p>Occasionally a bird would call or be seen. Commonly it was the
Mudlark, but now and then it was a parrot, hard to identify, a
Willy Wagtail (the "titchi-ritchi-ritchi-ra" of the natives) with
all the impudence of his southern relatives, or a hawk. Once we
flushed a pair of quail, but bird life was not plentiful and of
euro or kangaroo or wallaby we saw little trace. The noticeable
tracks were those of the large goanna called by the natives
<i>pirinti</i>. At a spring we saw the backbone of one of these
reptiles&mdash;all that had been left by the blackfellow who had
eaten him.</p>

<p>By the Lartna-tree near the Willy Wagtail Spring we passed a
night that I shall long remember. A lengthy search for water had
ended happily at this pool. The camels, hobbled, had been turned
loose to pick up what they could; the little fire of Terence, an
Arunta man, glowed in the young dusk; behind us stood, in solemn
grandeur, grotesque peaks and turrets, their crests warm-red in the
last of the sunset; before us rose a hillside which changed from
grey to gold as the moon climbed up and flooded the heavens with
soft light. The earth was warm and dry, the air crisp and cool; the
tinkling camel-bells made a lullaby; we slept till the dawn came up
even more beautiful than the night.</p>

<p>But the rain has come, and where our camels made their broad
tracks on the windblown drift the welcome waters are racing, while
along the banks the green herbage is rushing astonishingly to its
full stature. The cattleman is rejoicing, despite his depleted
herds, for here is his means of living restored to him, and the
blackfellow will no longer know hunger with the immediate
reappearance (miraculous beyond belief) of fish and frogs and other
vanished game. Moreover he may now defy the dreaded scurvy which
took such a toll one year owing to the absence of vegetable
foods.</p>

<p>Old Man River don't say nothin' but he certainly does know
somethin'. When the Finke moves he works miracles.</p>

<h2><a name="c3" id="c3"></a>CHAPTER III &mdash; THE TRAIN AND THE
ALICE</h2>

<p>When Professor Porteus and I made our first trip we used the
railway as far as Alice Springs, roughly a thousand miles north of
Adelaide, before hiring a motor-truck to take us some ninety miles
west. That meant a South Australian train as far as Quorn, a
comfortable little town sitting at the foot of the Flinders Range,
and there changing into a Commonwealth train, which completed the
journey in another two days and three nights of continuous going.
Our fellow passengers were an education in this new world of the
Inland. A brown-faced constable of police was returning from a
vacation spent at the distant seaside&mdash;we learnt that his
"beat" covered many hundreds of miles and that a single case might
keep him away from headquarters and in the field for two or three
months at a time a couple of prospectors had been to the city to
float a silver-lead proposition&mdash;the only trouble being that
the mine was 300 miles from the nearest water; a Catholic priest
was taking this 2000 mile route to Darwin&mdash;the "top end" as
Darwin is always named in the Centre; several doggers dropped off
at lonely stations to resume their pursuit of the dingo&mdash;7s.
6d. apiece is paid for scalps; late one night we delivered a sleepy
schoolboy to his parents&mdash;the lad had come some 900 miles to
be at home for the holidays; cattlemen talked of droughts and good
seasons, opal gougers of the luck of that calling, mica miners
spoke of the getting of their curious mineral and the difficulties
of its carriage from the Jervois Range, and elsewhere, to the
railhead&mdash;it was truly a new world we had entered.</p>

<p>We passed through Marree (Hergott Springs), still largely the
home of the camel, we reached the Lake Eyre basin, that vast
depression which is lower than sea-level, then we started to climb
towards the blue Macdonnell Ranges, standing, an east-west barrier
300 miles long, right across the fairway. Heavitree Gap, cut by the
Todd River, lets the traffic through, and two miles to the north of
the Gap is Alice Springs. The Alice is only a few miles from the
Tropic of Capricorn but the snug little township, cuddled by the
hills about it, is some 2000 feet above sea-level, so knows frosts
as well as a tropical sun. I have seen the water frozen there in
May and I recall the experience of one of my friends who, camping
in that neighbourhood, put his false teeth in his quart-pot for the
night and found them in the morning grinning at him through a
couple of inches of ice.</p>

<i>The Finke In Flood Near Hermannsburg</i>
</p>

<p>I fell in love with the Macdonnells. The best season in which to
see them is winter. Here is a note written on the spot in that
season (May 1934), a note which does all too little justice to
their rare charm:</p>

<p class="newspaper">For early morning beauty I am prepared to
uphold the claim of the Macdonnell Ranges against the rest of the
world. It is true that I have not seen the rest of the world, but I
feel in this matter much as the old physician did about the
strawberry: "Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but
doubtless He never did." Looking up from my writing for another
view before the splendour fades, my first impression becomes
conviction that surely nothing better than this has been
created.<br>
<br>
We are camped on a flat between the public well and the railway
line. Behind us, to the north, lies the township of Alice Springs,
capital of Central Australia, about half a mile away. Roosters are
crowing there, and a drift of white smoke from the first of the
breakfast fires is spreading slowly down the valley of the Todd,
scarcely moving, and keeping very low. Fine white-stemmed gums in
the middle distance add greatly to the value of the picture.<br>
<br>
But it is to the south that we turn with assured expectation, for
we have been here now five days, and no morning yet has
disappointed us. Some two miles away is the great wall of rock
pierced by the gateway known as Heavitree Gap, and ending, from
this aspect, with the abrupt peak of Mount Gillen. It is Gillen who
first sees the sun. The flat is still in shadow, there is no hint
of colour at our level, when Gillen suddenly flushes
pink&mdash;like the Sultan's turret he has been caught in a "noose
of light." Rapidly the glow extends. Between looking down and
looking up, the crest of the range has reddened from end to end and
the pure tone is flowing downwards to the base. Now the whole line
of the mountain is rose-pink, shining as if lighted from
within.<br>
<br>
Not a breath of air is stirring. The trees stand as if asleep. In
keeping with the peace of the scene a Jackeroo Bird, the mellowest
singer of them all, pipes a few perfect flute calls, and a near-by
magpie croons quietly as if for his own private ear.<br>
<br>
A crow strikes an unexpected note of humour. Crows are everywhere
about the outskirts of the town, white-eyed, well groomed, always
hungry. A capable musician should compose the Song of the Crow: it
is astonishing the variety of notes the bird has. This one is
apparently attempting a rendering of "Hark, Hark the Lark!" He gets
as far as "Ar-cark-ca-cark," but wisely stops at that. My sympathy
goes out to a bird with such ambitions and such a voice!<br>
<br>
One of the taller trees has caught the light and all at once our
shadows lie stretched on the ground before us&mdash;the sun is
here! From far away comes the noisy gossip of a large flock of
Galahs. Louder it grows until they are passing right above us,
heading, every morning, towards the Gap. When they fly high their
wings fairly twinkle and they flutter like pink petals against the
blue. Almost invariably a few drop lower to examine us and, as they
settle, the dead bough they have chosen seems suddenly to have
flowered. With much arching of crests and <i>sotto voce</i> remarks
they stay for awhile, then, as one bird, they depart. We thought
Galahs could not fly without shrieking, but sometimes an alarm call
is sounded, the babel is hushed instantly, and the flock swoops low
between the trees, travelling fast and silently for some
distance.<br>
<br>
Bird life is fairly plentiful, though this has been a dry season in
the Centre. Black Cockatoos flap heavily along, creaking like rusty
gates, a Whistling Eagle calls not unmusically, and sails by on
steady wing, the Crested Bell-bird, most ventriloquial of singers,
defies you to say whether he is near or far, those handsome
creatures the Ulbujas, better known as the Port Lincoln Parrots,
display their sleek dark heads and golden collars as they feed in
the higher branches, Babblers make strange cat-calls, hopping
distractedly about as they do so, trim Soldier-birds come
fearlessly for scraps, and Red-eared Finches wheeze in their funny
asthmatic way, often alighting within a few feet of us.<br>
<br>
A soft tinkling comes from the rear. We turn to see a luminous
cloud against the eastern light, the dust raised by the sharp
hooves of the town herd of goats. Very picturesque they
arelong-horned and long-bearded Billys, sedate matrons, frolicsome
kids&mdash;of every age and every colour. Marching placidly with
them are a few sheep and, moving them on as they would pause to
snatch a mouthful here and there, are two aboriginal women, walking
with the ease and grace of carriage for which these people are
famous. They call to their charges and to their three dogs in
rapid, soft Arunta, and the herd passes, in a golden haze, to feed
somewhere to the west and return at sundown.</p>

<i>A Glimpse of Palm Valley</i>
</p>

<p class="newspaper">The Alice is awake. Domestic sounds come from
the dwellings to remind us of the homes we have left a thousand
miles away. To close the eyes for a moment is to forget that the
city is no longer with us; to open them is to see a team of camels
stalking solemnly past.<br>
<br>
But the range&mdash;the range is the thing! You turn to find that
the warm glory has gone; a new tone has taken its place. The whole
long line of hill has come forward a step; every detail of rock and
tree is now so plain in the clear air that you doubt the knowledge
that they are so far away. Presently the colour will change again
and towards the end of what, to Alice Springs, is a typical winter
day, bright and sunny, the bold escarpments will take on a faint
powdered blue which grows deeper and richer until they are no
longer a definite mountain chain, but merely a sombre line at which
the stars cease.<br>
<br>
Only one thing is more beautiful than the fading light of evening:
it is the miracle of the morning.</p>

<h2><a name="c4" id="c4"></a>CHAPTER IV &mdash; TRANSPORT
PROBLEMS</h2>

<p>Good as the travelling is on the homely and friendly
Commonwealth train, where the officials treat you as a long-lost
brother, yet the best way to make intimate contact with the Inland
is by motor-car. With it you may stop where you like and as long as
you like and, best of all, you may see the folk of the solitary
stations in their home surroundings and are afforded opportunity
really to know a people who are surely the most hospitable in the
world. Naturally you halt your car at each one of these outposts.
Until that first unfortunate gold rush to The Granites drew a host
of undisciplined people along the tracks&mdash;people who thought
it proper to shoot at every creature that moved and whose general
behaviour was, to put it mildly, boisterous&mdash;until the
back-country people had that experience they welcomed all who
passed. To-day the memory of the sorry invasion is dying and again
the traveller is esteemed. I have called at a house intending to
stay an hour and have found myself still there at the end of the
next day. The people are kindness itself and there are often
evidences of culture which one does not expect to see so far
removed from towns. Good pictures on the walls, nice china and
glassware, a library that would be notable in any city
home&mdash;these are no unusual objects where difficulties of
carriage alone would seem to forbid the possibility of their
presence.</p>

<p>But the train is by far the easier way, if only because it
provides meals and beds and no difficulties. In the car you must
carry extra water, extra petrol and much food and be prepared to
sleep in the open. Rivers whose dry beds are full of sand and
stones, and sandy ridges rising one behind the other in quick
succession, are obstacles which compel respect and occasionally
beat the car completely. The country is so big, too. Very few
people, including the native-born Australians, seem to realize its
size and that in it one may easily be hundreds of miles away from
the next human being.</p>

<p>Most Australians, of course, live on the edge; they know little
or nothing of the interior. It is so vast that the quoted figures
are difficult to grasp. To say that twenty-five Englands could be
dropped into the Commonwealth without occupying all the room is
impressive enough, perhaps, as is the equally true statement that
Australia is of almost the same area as the United States. But
those assertions evoke only a mild wonder. They produce much the
same effect as is gained by saying, what is also true, that there
are cattle-and sheep-stations which contain 10,000 square miles of
country, or that on one of these stations 160,000 sheep are
shorn.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Mrs Aeneas Gunn records in that
splendid book <i>We of the Never Never</i> that as her station home
on the Elsey was first sighted by her "we had left our front gate
forty-five miles behind us." The word "gate" is used
metaphorically. One may travel many hundreds of miles over leased
or freehold country without encountering a fence. To the passer-by
there are two prime mysteries&mdash;how the proprietors know their
boundaries, and how the stock on adjoining runs are kept separate.
There is a key, to each of these conundrums, and every bushman
possesses it.</p>

<p>A motorist who departs from the beaten track in the Inland does
so with a certain amount of risk. In a journey of 4000 miles, which
embraced some unusual places, we calculated that eighty per cent,
at least, of the going might be classed as good. But in the
remaining twenty per cent were some bad patches. A breakdown fifty
or a hundred miles from the nearest house may be very serious. One
can easily understand why some routes are labelled on the maps
"Two-car tracks." Safety first would be one way of translating
that; elaborated, it means that two cars would probably get through
where one might stick.</p>

<p>A car driven by a Sydney woman, whose sole companion was her
daughter, came to a full stop at the Arthur River in the Jervois
Range. Nothing would make it go. A lonelier spot could hardly have
been chosen. The girl, with great courage, set out on a walk of
thirty miles to the nearest house, accompanied only by a dog.
Strangely, in that unpeopled place, she met a man. He was a
blackfellow, an aboriginal who&mdash;we were told on passing
through&mdash;had escaped from an island prison in another State
and had wandered thus far inland. Whatever had been his
misdemeanour it could not have been of a very harmful character,
for he took the girl in charge and proved a veritable good
Samaritan. She arrived at her destination and a car was sent out
which retrieved the other.</p>

<p>The owner was lucky. The Arthur River is notoriously difficult
to cross. There is a double channel and, as we saw it then, it was
waterless and deep in sand. A steep descent, a smart dash across a
short channel, an equally steep pull out, and we found ourselves on
a narrow neck overlooking the next and much wider river bottom. It
was most discouragingly strewn with discarded coco-nut matting and
narrow strips of wire-netting, the relics of struggles by other
cars to traverse this slough of despond. Moreover, to depress us
further, a serviceable double-seater car stood melancholy,
deserted, about two-thirds of the way across. We tried to take the
sand in a rush, using some of the old netting at the first of it,
but within a few more yards the wheels were whizzing round without
progress. Our two cars held eight people; with seven pushing and
one at the wheel, we made the other bank. Then we repeated the
operation&mdash;no easy one&mdash;with the second vehicle.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="pic7" id="pic7"></a><img alt="" src=

<br>
<i>Section of the Macdonnell Ranges, Near Alice Springs</i>
</p>

<p>Our most serious trouble was the breaking of an axle. That would
be the end in most cases, but our driver had come prepared with
spares. Moreover, he was an expert mechanic. Thoughtfully&mdash;or
so we said&mdash;he had contrived that the smash should occur at
the end of the day. We camped and he went to work, with assistance
from others. By ten o'clock next morning we were on the road again.
Forlorn indeed is the picture of a car, its fires extinct, its
owners departed, standing on a wide gibber plain or in a belt of
river sand or "bull-dust." We were to see several such derelicts,
and each evoked speculation. Occasionally we were able to learn
something of the history of the breakdown. For instance, the Ford
that waited dustily on the side of a western Queensland track had
been used in an attempt to convey a group to a dance at the distant
township, but had acquired incurable tyre trouble. How the would-be
revellers fared we could not discover, but we were told at the
township that a rescue party was going out to recover the car "some
day."</p>

<p>Irrecoverable was a weary-looking trailer from which most of the
detachable parts had been taken. It was a depressing sight.
Curiosity about it could not be satisfied. Nor was there any hint
of the cause of the fire which had destroyed a large motor-car at a
spot even more remote from human habitation. Whatever the cause, no
one could suspect deliberate intent when the immediate penalty must
be a desperately long tramp over dry plains before food and shelter
could be reached. Perhaps the most likely vehicle to be rescued
ultimately was a two-ton truck which had incautiously run into the
overflow of a bore and become bogged. It appeared to be in
excellent condition.</p>

<p>These casualties recalled that East and West sometimes meet in
Central Australia. There are occasions when the camel, so early
man's beast of burden, may be seen yoked to a motor-car, almost the
latest of human devices in travel. Australia presses most forms of
carriage into the service of His Majesty's mails. A line of
cattle-stations on a certain inland river still greets a monthly
mail borne on the backs of camels, which travel some 400 miles on
each journey. Other parts rejoice in an air service. But the
motor-truck and the motor-car are perhaps now the most used means
of transport, replacing many a slow-moving camel team, which could
cover no more than about thirty miles a day. That is all to the
good, but the camel, which nothing short of flood can stop, has his
revenge when that worst enemy of the internal combustion engine,
the shifting desert sand, decides that the car shall not prevail
for once. Then it is that the mailman is lucky if he can obtain the
help of one or more of the ungainly beasts to haul him and his
helpless car across the dry creek or over the sandy ridge.</p>

<p>On another car trip, this time with my friend S. R. Mitchell,
well-known as a geologist, and a young friend of his named Ray
Golland, we drove from Melbourne to Broken Hill and so to Marree.
Some of the minor incidents of that journey have fixed themselves
firmly in my memory.</p>

<p>We had come through the Flinders Range to find ourselves at
Parachilna, a station on that great railway line which begins in
Adelaide and ends under the shadow of the Macdonnell Ranges at
Alice Springs. Swinging round, we headed for Marree, for there I
had to catch train back to the greener south, while my two
companions took the Birdsville track for Mulka. There had been no
rain for many months. Sand alternated with gibber; vegetation was
represented by occasional starved-looking trees. Coming as we had
by dry back-country tracks where settlement was far to seek, we
carried supplies of water against emergency, so the fact that the
creek we reached at nightfall had no sign of moisture did not deter
us from camping. We spread our sleeping-bags in its very bed. Above
us was the bridge supporting the railway. It supported more than
that; every space between the sleeper ends held a nest, some with
eggs, some with young ones, while the parent birds flew twittering
about protesting at our presence. With the falling of the night
peace came again to the little colony, and our camp-fire seemed the
only living thing in that immense area of earth and sky.</p>

<br>
<i>Heavitree Gap and Railway (Todd River), Alice Springs</i>
</p>

<p>The quiet was remarkable. Only when the city man reaches such
solitudes does he realize that his customary life is spent amid
ceaseless noise. The wounds of sound were healed by silence; we
found ourselves instinctively speaking in low tones, adjusting
ourselves to the surroundings. But from far and far away, scarce
heard, there rose a murmur, so low as to suggest rumour rather than
reality. We sat expectant, but it died away. Again it came, this
time as a singing, a faint, faint singing in the rails overhead. "A
train!" said someone. Content as we had been, here was an event,
and we hurried out to see it. The railway there is as straight as a
spear for more miles than the eye can follow. For long the noise
gathered and grew before anything was visible, then a little eye
opened and grew greater till it shone as a mighty headlight
blinding us to what was behind it. With a roar the train passed by,
and the rails fell gradually quieter till at last even the faint
whispers ceased. We wondered what the nesting birds had thought of
it! Doubtless they had grown accustomed to this recurring wonder.
No sound came from their homes as we made our beds and settled to
sleep.</p>

<p>Morning saw the miracle repeated which for us had never staled
in these wide spaces of the interior. This time it was more
impressive than ever. Stars were still showing as we woke, but the
east was even then full of the promise of the dawn. A low haze made
the surface of the earth a nebulous thing, a mystery; above it hung
a small clear pool of light, the harbinger of the sun. But he was
far below the horizon as yet, and we were to see, before he
appeared, the preparations made for his advent. The green of
emeralds and the glory of cloth of gold were spread before him, the
colours so pure and fresh as to be the eternal despair of any, even
the greatest, of our artists. Then royally he came, and at once,
fully and wholly, the day was with us. Under that searching light
the mists vanished and the land stood once more revealed as a
desert. But that it is no true desert has been told by many, and we
also were to be given proof that this sandy waste is a potential
garden. Twenty-four hours after we left, the rain came; a fortnight
to the day my companions returned to the same camping spot. The
creek had subsided, the bed was as dry as before, but in the
blackened ring which marked where our fire had been stood a plant,
eighteen inches high, in full flower. Nature has to hurry here if
the species is to be perpetuated.</p>

<p>By midday, after a pause to extract from a tyre what was surely
the only headless bolt lying on the track in the whole 2000 miles
between Adelaide and Darwin, we saw Marree on the plain, and drew
up to a civilized meal, a meal eaten at a table. There is little of
the typically Australian in one side of Marree, for that portion is
altogether Afghan. Camel-breeding and the carriage of goods by
camel were for very many years the two industries of this township,
once known as Hergott Springs. It is said that in its best days,
before the motor-truck spoilt the carrying business, there were
some 1500 camels about the place, and that a good beast was worth
more than 100. Now they are, if not exactly a drug in the market,
at least very easily obtainable. Indeed, they are running
wild&mdash;"wild as rabbits," said the half-caste with whom I
travelled on the homeward trip. He added that the authorities had
found the strays such a nuisance that they had recently rounded up
eighty of the big animals in a corner and shot the lot! In the main
street of Marree I stood and gave a soured blessing to my friends
as they turned the car on to the Birdsville track, hastening to
overtake the mailman on his fortnightly trip. At a certain point he
was usually assisted by camels to cross some bull-dust, and they
hoped to share the assistance. They were too late, but they managed
the crossing unaided.</p>

<p>I watched till their dust died down, then turned to the
comfortable two-story hotel for dinner and bed. "At one stride came
the dark," said Coleridge of the tropics, and twilight was very
short here. By nine o'clock I was ready for sleep; the homeward
train left very early next morning. I approached the landlord,
"I'll do your room," said he, grasping what looked like a spray
pump with a tin canister attached, and preceding me up the stairs.
My bedroom, I noticed, had fine-mesh netting on the windows.
Closing the door, mine host proceeded to spray, methodically and
thoroughly, the walls and ceiling till the air was full of the
highly volatile substance used. "There!" said he. "You'll have no
mosquitoes now!" He was right. When he called me in the pitch black
of earliest morning I had slept undisturbed, though this had been
described to me in Melbourne as the worst place in the world for
mosquitoes. Across rails and tripping wires I stumbled, burdened by
a suitcase and a swag loaded with aboriginal implements, till the
station loomed up, a still darker patch in the general blackness.
Slowly, very slowly, the official world awoke. But there was still
no glimmer of daybreak when the train rattled out of the yard.
There was also no light in the carriage, so for many miles my two
neighbours were no more to me than voices.</p>

<p>The gloom in which we sat gave us perfect conditions under which
to watch the coming of the day. A thinning of the shadow on the
eastern edge of the world was the first sign. An horizon became
indicated. We grew aware of dark shapes of trees or little hills.
The light extended upward, and the lower stars, brilliant till now,
began to fade. Colour crept in, the faintest of pale ambers, so
delicate as to be barely visible. It spread and deepened, and the
sky above was, quite suddenly, a clear blue-green. The changing was
so subtle that one knew it only in result and never by seeing the
actual movement. Now the land was wholly in view, but with every
harshness removed, a certain unreality, a soft greyness, wrapped
tree and rock and level space. Even as we dwelt upon it, that, too,
changed, and there was the sun, smiling upon a new earth. His
coming seemed instantaneous; one moment he was out of sight, the
next full-risen. It was then I knew what Kipling's soldier meant
when he said: "the dawn comes up like thunder." What did the day
matter after that? The south-easterly blew, the sand came filtering
in to rob us of comfort, two passengers passed a convivial bottle
round, each in turn drinking from its neck till some of the company
were merrier than wise&mdash;these things were the ordinary
incidents of daylight. We had seen the dawn!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c5" id="c5"></a>CHAPTER V &mdash; OPAL</h2>

<p>No matter the mood in which you approach the amazing vastness of
Central Australia you will not be human if that mood is not
dominated by expectancy. After my four long trips I am still
unsatisfied, still eager, still prepared for wonders.</p>

<p>The wonders do not always arrive: but what of that? Carlyle was
not so much disturbed by the actual crowing of the cocks as by the
waiting for them to crow. Anticipation and retrospect provide many
of the keenest of our emotions. Always on the wide plains, their
edges lost in the lakes of mirage, one <i>knows</i> that strange
things are imminent, and even in their absence there is but little
disillusionment; the sense of being is so keen that it carries over
as reality.</p>

<p>But the natural wonders are truly many, wonders intruding
themselves unexpectedly into an ordinary journey, and wonders to be
deliberately sought out. This great island-continent was cut off
from the rest of the world ages ago; the primeval creatures remain
unchanged by intrusion and interminglings, remain at a stage in
evolution long past and lost in every other land. Australia has
been called a museum of living fossils and assuredly her most
distinctive native creatures give colour to the term. The platypus,
for instance, Nature's most freakish production, has the bill of a
duck, lays a soft-shelled egg like a reptile's, has fur like a cat
and suckles its young. One understands the state of mind of the new
settler from overseas who described his first platypus as
possessing a beak like a bird and "feathers like a 'possum."</p>

<p>You are unlikely to see this shy and mainly nocturnal animal on
a trip to Central Australia; but kangaroos and wallabies, emus and
bustards (known as wild turkeys), cockatoos and gaily feathered
parrots in screeching flocks will be common sights, and at night
the dingo, the native dog whose origin troubles the scientist so
much, may perhaps be heard in high-pitched ululations, now near,
now far, giving character to the lonely plains or the mulga forest.
A characteristic of the dingo is that it does not bark.</p>

<p>It is a long road to the Inland from where the cities, and
indeed most of Australia's population, are distributed along the
coastline.</p>

<p>Varied as that long coastline is, it has nothing quite in
keeping with the astonishing gaps and chasms which break the line
of the Macdonnells and which are attracting more and more attention
from tourists. With Alice Springs as a base, several of these great
fissures may readily be visited&mdash;Standley Chasm is perhaps the
most remarkable of them all. On our first visit, Professor Porteus
and I found that this water-worn crevasse was still unnamed. We
acted as godparents and called it Standley after the Mrs Standley
who had been in charge of the half-caste home at the Jay River and
had been the first white woman, we were told, to venture up this
wild gorge. The naming was duly accepted by the authorities.</p>

<p>On the Inland way has been passed, but far out of sight over the
western horizon, one of the greatest single stones in the
world&mdash;Ayers Rock. It is a pebble lying all alone on the floor
of a sandy desert, a pebble one and three-fifths of a mile long,
seven-eighths of a mile wide and 1100 feet high. On the western
side, too, are the Henbury Craters, deep holes created by a fall of
meteorites in the far-off times before the white man came to those
solitudes.</p>

<p>To visit places such as these needs special conveyance. Some may
be reached by car, but to others the only way is by camel. The
motor-car has done much to cut down distance in the Centre as
elsewhere, and it was by car that we approached one of the
strangest of settlements, a village of troglodytes which the
aborigines have named Coober Pedy, "Coober" being, their word for
"white fellow," and "Pedy" for "a hole in the ground." The
map-makers call it the Stuart Range Opal Fields. The blackfellow
title is the more descriptive, for here every one lives in a
dug-out.</p>

<p>This was my second visit. I had been unfavourably impressed on
the first occasion; this time I was accompanied by two artists, an
oil painter and a water-colourist, who had also been there before
and who assured me that I would live to repent my first judgment.
They were right.</p>

<p>From our own little State of Victoria, down in the south-east
corner, we had come to Coober Pedy by way of Port Augusta, a brisk
town at the head of Spencer Gulf in the neighbouring State of South
Australia. Here the east-west railway line begins in earnest its
1500 mile journey to Perth, the most westerly of the Australian
capitals. One section of this line, by the way, crosses the
Nullarbor Plains, a perfectly straight and perfectly level stretch
for 300 miles. We followed this iron route for some 200 miles, then
turned north, through cattle-station after cattle-station
("ranches" in America) whose unfenced boundaries cause the
traveller to wonder what keeps the herds from mixing and how an
owner identifies his beasts. Perhaps there is an explanation in the
cryptic remark of a cattleman to whom I put that problem. "Well,"
said he, "it is not considered polite to visit your neighbour when
he is mustering and branding!"</p>

<p>A seemingly limitless gibber plain gave us warning, with our
local knowledge, that we were on the final stage of this portion of
our journey. It is idle to look for the hills of the "Stuart
Range;" you will find that this plain is the upper level and that
the opal field lies in a valley carved out of the plateau. You go
down to Coober Pedy, not up. It was dark when we reached the edge
of the declivity on this latest occasion, but we knew the way and
down we plunged, past the mouths of silent dug-outs in which never
a light showed, past the one and only store, equally dark, round
the dim bulk of a hill to the right, its curved summit outlined by
the stars, and so to a fiat near the tank which the Government has
provided as a water-supply.</p>

<p>But what was this! A row of lights shone, low down, a few
hundred yards away, and there was a murmur of soft voices. Now
Coober Pedy goes to bed with the fowls, so this was truly
remarkable. The riddle was soon solved. Silently as a shadow falls,
a man stepped out of the darkness into the circle of our firelight.
He was an aboriginal: the tribe which at one time owned this as a
hunting ground was on a "walkabout" and was revisiting its old
haunts. For the next few days we were to see much of these poor
dispossessed people, recipients now of the white man's bounty,
beggars where formerly they were lords of the countryside.</p>

<p>Coober Pedy has no trees. That is one reason why there are no
houses. Even firewood does not exist, unless the roots and tiny
shrubs used by the aborigines may be so classed. We had carried
wood many miles on the back of our car and had included every old
discarded rubber tyre we could find along the track. Tyres produce
a cheerful blaze. The month was May, beginning our Austral winter,
and the nights were sharp with frost.</p>

<p>So we woke next morning to a tonic atmosphere, an air cold, dry
and invigorating. Despite the dear skies there was no dew. Never
have I changed an opinion so swiftly, or with such good cause, as
when I looked round. The sun was just beginning to show behind the
eastern bank; the valley was filled with a level light which
transformed the torn earth until it appeared to have "suffered a
sea change, into something new and strange." Every shade of soft
pastel tone was represented in the dumps marking the shallow
workings&mdash;pale mauves and pinks and creams and the faintest of
blues and yellows, each taking its share of the light and returning
it beautified tenfold. The grey-green hills sat all about "like
giants at a hunting, chin upon hand," a worthy setting to a lovely
scene.</p>

<p>There and then I recanted. I learnt, in a flash, why Stevenson
could write of his Scottish moor:</p>

<p class="poem">Yet shall your ragged moor receive<br>
The incomparable pomp of eve<br>
And the cold glories of the dawn...</p>

<p>See Coober Pedy at dawn or at sunset if you would know the vivid
charm of a strange place. The merciless light of midday reveals
only too clearly the general bareness, the absence of vegetation,
the scars and wounds inflicted by man in his endless search for
wealth.</p>

<br>
<i>Alice Springs and the Wall of the Macdonnell Ranges</i>
</p>

<p>To our camp-fire at night came some of the old men who had
drifted about many countries of the world in their more vigorous
days and had now come to anchor in this harbour of hope&mdash;for
to-day, if We may believe them, the place produces more hope than
it does payable opal. We learnt much as they talked. Originally
cattlemen found opal here as an outcrop. They worked it quietly,
selling where they were little known and so keeping the field to
themselves for a lucky period. When others followed their tracks
the guide to the wealth below was still outcrop; later it was to be
the "floater"&mdash;a piece of opal, commonly bleached to the
whiteness of milk, lying loose upon the surface. Obviously these
easily-moved fragments could not be altogether reliable guides, but
they were better than to-day's complete absence of signs. "Now it
is all stabbing in the dark," said one of our old gouger friends.
"All guesswork; and you're either on it or off it&mdash;there's no
in-between."</p>

<p>Anywhere you try in this 600 square miles of field might be
good; every inhabitant assured us that there is still much virgin
ground to test, and finds are still to be made. From a shallow hole
one man had recently taken 200 worth of opal; on the other hand
two men, working as partners, had sunk shafts aggregating 1700 feet
and had put in 163 feet of drives, and for all that work, occupying
many months, their return had been not more than 20. Opal, like
gold, is sold by the ounce; but, unlike gold, there is a very wide
range of values. "You might get threepence an ounce or you might
get 50"&mdash;and we were not left in doubt that the
highest-priced stuff is rarely found. It must have fire and clarity
and pattern.</p>

<p>The deepest shaft in Coober Pedy is about sixty feet. The deeper
it is found the more likely the opal is to crack and lose beauty as
it comes to the light. Old Hungarian Joe, his tongue armed with the
slang of the world, waved his pipe excitedly from the far side of
the fire, as he told tales of the mines of his native country.
There they sank hundreds of feet for the opal and took years to
bring it to the surface, acclimatizing it, as it were, by resting
it at various upward stages. Otherwise it would bleach and crack on
exposure to the sun. With such generally shallow workings at Coober
Pedy a man could work alone, and customarily did so, but
occasionally there was a partnership. Sometimes a man would haul
for another for the privilege of "lousing the dump," an inelegant
but extremely expressive way of saying that he is allowed to take
away any of the opal which has been unintentionally thrown out with
the "potch" and worthless earth.</p>

<p>"Potch," by the way, suggests opal in the course of
formation&mdash;"unripe opal," as someone called it. It is often
charged with fire and shot with lovely blues and greens, but these
do not gleam in shadow as true opal does.</p>

<p>The opal here is not the rarer "black" variety, which Americans
purchase so readily when they visit Australia. That is obtained
mainly from a smaller field, Lightning Ridge, in New South Wales.
The buyers come from the capital cities, sit in the dug-outs and
appraise the worth of the stuff offered, giving, of course, very
little of the price at which they will eventually sell in their
shops. I have seen a bespectacled elderly buyer bent over a table
in his cave, gems spread before him, a pair of scales dimly seen at
his side, the whole suggesting the old-world picture of The
Miser.</p>

<p>Our friends told us that good finds are seldom made&mdash;but
the buyers continue to visit! There are more discoveries, perhaps,
than are confessed in a place where so many of the inhabitants are
in receipt of aid from the Government in the form of "sustenance"
or the old-age pension, aid liable to be withdrawn should there be
any other source of income.</p>

<br>
<i>Crossing a Dry Lake-bed</i>
</p>

<p>Sea-shells are a curious product of this inland village. The
nearest coastline to-day is some four hundred miles away, but the
gouger's pick crashes into rich evidence that once this was ocean
bed. A "sea change" indeed&mdash;no more arid scene could be
imagined, but under that usually drought-stricken surface lie
beaches once restless with the waves of ocean. How long ago? Who
knows? The transformation of the shells into opal suggests periods
which to man are vast indeed, but which to Nature are as yesterday.
Farther inland, about the east side of Lake Eyre, are deposits of
bones, all that remains of that giant herbivorous beast the
diprotodon, long extinct, which once roamed in forests where now
vegetation is unknown. And in the dry centre of the continent,
surrounded by a wilderness which has none but desert plants, is a
glen of palms; palms found nowhere else in the world, the final
vestige of a tropical period.</p>

<p>Change, change, and ever change, but Nature, whose motto is
<i>Ohne hast, ohne rast,</i> does her work so quietly that we think
she sleeps, or that the end of change has come because Man has
arrived.</p>

<p>To-day there are not more than forty persons on this field where
formerly there were hundreds. The depression caught the gem trade
early and it has not thoroughly recovered. Most of the people are
elderly&mdash;"it is too costly to move away" we were often told. A
few women remain and perhaps half a dozen children, their education
carried on by the government system of correspondence tuition. The
mother of a family of three has succeeded in establishing a
community library&mdash;reading matter is more precious here than
opal&mdash;and keeps it supplied by contact with Adelaide and
Melbourne.</p>

<p>It is rash to fall ill. The nearest doctor and the nearest
hospital are 400 bad bush miles away. At the time of my latest
visit there was no telegraph or wireless; if a man became sick he
had to rely upon the resources of the community medicine-chest and
the layman knowledge of his mates. I ricked my back and was taken
to the medicine dug-out in search for plasters. I had not seen the
place before. "What are those boards?" I asked, indicating a neat
pile. "They are for coffins," was the reply. In the absence of a
magistrate or other law official the burial takes place first; the
certificate of death comes later. The little cemetery holds half a
dozen graves.</p>

<p>When times were better a meeting was called to secure erection
of a hospital. Sufficient money was obtained to get the necessary
dressed timber from the far-away city; it duly arrived, but no more
money was forthcoming and enthusiasm had died. Gradually that
timber melted away&mdash;most of it to line dwellings or prop up
drives in the mines. To-day there is no trace of it above
ground.</p>

<p>Looking up from our camp on the flat we see cuttings in the
hillsides and know them to be homes. A drive straight-in leads to a
room hollowed out of the earth, a curious soft pigmented earth
which hardens by exposure to the air, so the ceiling requires no
supports. Wood, as already said, is scarce: when a shelf or a couch
or a seat is needed the wall is cut away down to the required
height, leaving the piece of earthern furniture projecting. Light,
the fierce white daylight of Coober Pedy, comes in from the
doorway; a protected airway opening through the hilltop, or
hillside, gives ventilation. As I wandered across a hill one day I
saw a can standing on end. I walked over and looked into it, to be
rewarded with a puff of smoke in my face. I was gazing down a
cave-dweller's chimney!</p>

<p>The one official is the postmaster. He is also the
representative of the Commonwealth Savings Bank. His duties consist
in the main of selling stamps, making up the weekly mail and
handing out the postal articles when the mail coach concludes its
long journey on Saturday night or Sunday morning. His uniform
appears to be composed of a sleeveless sweater and a pair of
trousers. Obliging, cheerful, he is at your service whenever you
can catch him, but that is when he is not away sharing the general
occupation of the inhabitants. Like all the people of the back
country these Coober Pedy folk are the soul of hospitality and the
postmaster is no exception. His post office and bank are a dug-out,
which, however, boasts a padlocked gate at its entrance. Thus, and
by formal notices posted outside, does it proclaim itself a
government institution.</p>

<p>It is said that a second reason for the dug-out as a residence
is that the flies do not venture into its shadowed coolness. The
old query, "Where do the flies go in winter?" is answered here. I
have known plagues of the small house-fly in many places, but
nowhere to equal what we found in Coober Pedy. From the first warm
ray of sunshine in the early morning to well into the evening dusk
they buzzed and crawled and bit. No mere waving of hands would
disturb them from your face; you must literally pick them from your
eyes. I had to write articles for a Melbourne newspaper; it was
impossible in the open till I had placed a large gossamer veil over
my head and tucked the ends well into the neck of my shirt all
round. That left only my hands bare and I could work.</p>

<p>One of our party wrote a song about the flies of Coober Pedy. As
it was produced while the insects were at their busiest it cannot
appear in print. A line stated, cryptically, "There's not a single
fly in Coober Pedy." The refrain explained that why there was not a
<i>single</i> fly was because each and every one of them was
married&mdash;and had a large family. The torment ceases, or at
least is modified, they told us, with the advent of the severer
frosts.</p>

<p>We had grown accustomed, as we had travelled over the seemingly
endless plains, to the constant mirage on the horizon; constant yet
ever-changing as we approached it. Sheets of placid water, with
tree-clad edges, with bays and promontories and islands, with every
sign of permanence, would dissolve into thin air, only to reappear
in an altered form farther on. Lake Cadabirrawirracanna, a dry
depression to the east of Coober Pedy, we named the Mother of
Mirages, for every morning she presented us with a fresh deception.
The most imposing was a sea on which floated two great battleships,
the one stern on, the other presenting a side view. Even as we
watched, these monsters wavered and passed, the sea rolled up as if
the Resurrection trump had blown, and only the sandy waste
remained&mdash;a stage from which the scenery had been completely
withdrawn.</p>

<p>But the old men are sitting at the camp-fire this fine night and
we listen to their tales. The oldest, Joe the Squeaker, is thin and
dark, active despite his seventy years, perpetually smoking or
waving his pipe to emphasize his points. His accent is markedly
foreign; his speech is larded with strange oaths gathered in three
continents and enriched by accretions gained in mining and cattle
camps all over Australia. "By crabbie!" he will explode, and leave
us in doubt as to what slang word he is parodying. As he warms to a
subj ect his eyes light up, he rises and tramps restlessly about
and his speech comes in a torrent of mixed slang hard to
understand. He had struck it rich on a couple of occasions but had
got no farther from Coober Pedy than a township where a hostelry
was happy to welcome a digger with a pocketful of high-grade opal.
"A feller was dere mit one of dose aerplanes," he remembered. Then,
with vigour: "Had a few whiskies and I vent up. T'ought it would be
a horrible feelin', but Lord! I vas too shick, too bletty full! You
don't kit your aunt any more mit dem t'ings! One foot on de ole
terry firma is goot enough for me&mdash;and de other not too bletty
high!" It was on that bout that he found himself one night so
shickered that he lost his way and slept where he lay down. "I yoke
der nex' mornin' and a death adder he lie alongside me! By crabbie;
he vake me up!"</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="pic11" id="pic11"></a><img alt="" src=
"1403041h-images/WideHorizons11.jpg"><br>
<br>
<i>Post Office and Commonwealth Savings Bank at Coober Pedy</i>
</p>

<p>So he came back to the field again&mdash;"only one store, only
one butcher, only one everyt'ing!" as he summed it up. He spoke of
a digger as having wasted his all on "slow horses" and added: "He's
had more breakfas' times than what he's had breakfasts."</p>

<p>Joe's mate, sitting quietly on the other side of the cheerful
blaze, is as reserved as Joe is boisterous. We are to learn that he
has a passion for statistics and for accuracy of statement. He
reads everything, but prefers serious books. He tells us the
latitude and longitude of Coober Pedy, its distance from various
better-populated parts, its height above sea level, its rainfall
and its extremes of temperature; he branches off to recall the
length of Australia's longest water-pipe line, mentions the year of
its construction and the name of its engineer; he corrects,
courteously but firmly, certain long-cherished beliefs of
ours&mdash;his memory seems inexhaustible and infallible.</p>

<p>He, too, has travelled much. He has been completely round
Australia by sea, and once he walked the 900 thirsty miles from
Darwin to Alice Springs. With humour he spoke of his own early
follies, with tolerance of those of others. Once in hospital in
Darwin, just conscious after a severe bout of fever, he heard the
doctor remark: "Well, God and I often have a struggle for a man:
I've beaten Him this time!"</p>

<p>And so the talk drifts on. The discarded motor tyres we had
retrieved along the track, and now burnt to save our firewood, have
become circles of white ash, the full moon is high above us, and
the soft chatter of our aboriginal neighbours has long since died
away, but the flood of reminiscence has not spent itself. We warm
our guests with coffee, and reluctantly we watch them go their
several ways, each following his tiny path between the dumps to his
lonely cave.</p>

<p>Steadily the dug-outs are emptying at Coober Pedy and the little
graveyard is becoming fuller. At its present rate of decline this
quaint settlement will soon be no longer a local habitation but
only a name, a memory on the tongue of the present generation and a
mere tale for posterity.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c6" id="c6"></a>CHAPTER VI &mdash; MICA</h2>

<p>It is said that few Australians take to the sea, that the call
which drew our forefathers round the watery world has but little
appeal for us. That may be so, but the implication that the spirit
of adventure has died in our generation is wholly false. Travel
into the remote heart of this immense continent and you will find
that our division of the "legion that never was listed" has merely
turned its face landwise and is as busy as ever in its pursuit of
the unknown.</p>

<p>Mining, of course, is one of its most notable manifestations.
Opal attracts many; gold still more. The wilderness is being
earnestly combed for gold and numberless "shows" will be bested in
country so remote from settlement that the prospector literally
takes his life in his hands in going there. The horse and the
camel, particularly the camel, serve him well, and if he finds a
payable field, the motor-truck will soon mark a track across the
gibber and over the sandhills.</p>

<p>It was by such a track that we went to the mica mines in the
Jervois Range, north-east of Alice Springs and not far from the
western edge of Queensland. The visit was part of a long excursion
which, at a respectful distance, circled Lake Eyre. These mines
have long been worked, but the way is still far from being the
easiest in the world to follow. The drivers, coming in with their
loads to the railhead, are constantly seeking better
river-crossings, safer or easier or shorter routes, and at times
there is a confusion of pads to choose from, not all of them
usable. It was easy enough while we were running along the great
overland telegraph line, ant-hills punctuating the plain on either
hand, but presently it was a course from well to well, from station
to station, on sandy or red-soil plains or acres of white quartz
pebbles. The season was good and occasionally the Mitchell grass
rose about us six feet high. The Tropic of Capricorn was crossed
and, contrary to all expectation, we were glad that night to wear
overcoats as we sat about the campfire and gladder still to roll
rugs about us as we curled up in the sleeping-bags.</p>

<p>Wonderful nights of stars they were, but cold, for the tableland
is some 2000 feet above sea-level.</p>

<p>Finches swarmed at every well, each waterhole had its pair of
Whistling Eagles, and the Kite, that friendly Autolycus of the
back-blocks, hovered over all the station yards. The Galah seemed
to be ever with us and so was his friend the Corella. One morning,
waking at "piccaninny daylight," I smiled to recall Louis Esson's
excellent definition of the bush day as "magpie to mopoke," for
those two birds were calling together. They had overlapped; it was
dark enough for one, and light enough for the other.</p>

<p>Occasionally a "turkey" (the Australian bustard) would stop
eating grasshoppers to give us a haughty glance, both suspicious
and disdainful; the Native Companion and the emu gazed with more
curiosity than fear; and kangaroos seemed to regard the car as a
pacing machine, for they would race parallel, or just in front, for
miles.</p>

<p>Scraps of mica had become common along the track, sparkling at
us as we passed, and presently there showed, well ahead, the
collection of tents marking the Mica King Mine. It is the centre of
what is surely the most remarkable landscape in the world.
Everywhere were thousands of bright eyes watching us, myriads of
heliographs flashed and winked and flashed again, the whole
countryside was brilliant with quivering lights. Countless shining
points were in the dust at our feet, on the floor of the valley
stretching before us, and scattered along the opposing hillside; as
the wind blew they trembled and shivered until the earth seemed
alive.</p>

<p>Mica is obtained in "books," the layers (or leaves) of which are
as thin as paper. It fractures easily; the camp was surrounded by
the remains of broken and discarded sheets. Just as with paper,
these fragments shook in every breeze and their glass-like surfaces
threw back the sun in dazzling fashion. The Cock-eyed Bobs or Willy
Willies (the Burramugga or Rooba-roobara of the aborigines) roar
down the valley, flatten the tents, and pick up the loose mica to
give a remarkable exhibition as the stuff is whirled sparkling into
the heavens. "Jewelled in every hole," quoted someone. We were told
that for hours after the passing of a whirlwind the flimsy sheets
keep dropping slowly back to earth. Often the kites, ever watchful,
dive at these floating scraps as possible food. "The finest thing
we have about the place. They clean up all the scraps, bread, meat,
anything," was the comment of the camp on the kites.</p>

<i>Restoration of a Diprotodon Skeleton</i>
</p>

<p>An open cut shows the original workings. From it goes down a
slanting shaft which swallows greedily the blood-woods and other
trees used to timber the drives. Two sturdy citizens, appropriately
clad&mdash;that is with as few garments as need be&mdash;were
handling the windlass, lowering the timber and raising the ore.
From the crest of the ridge where they worked, the view stretched
to infinity save on the western side where the main body of the
Jervois Range formed the horizon.</p>

<p>We found this camp of the Mica King a home away from home. All
but two of its denizens were from Melbourne. It was an instructive
sight to see our public school lads, as several of them were,
adapting themselves completely to such novel and difficult
conditions.</p>

<p>Seated in a group apart, a tiny fire smouldering in the centre,
were about a dozen blackfellows. Each was armed with a knife with
which he cut flaws and imperfections from the sheets of mica. (All
the waste mica, by the way, is destined eventually to be ground up
into face powder. Looking at the wilderness about us, so far
removed from any of the graces of civilization, it was hard to
picture it in connexion with the dainty toilet-tables and daintier
cheeks of Beauty.) These natives declared themselves, so far as one
could understand their pidgin, to be of the "Louera" tribe,
seemingly a division of the Arunta. Bearded, grave, their lithe
legs doubled under them, they discoursed seriously as they did
their job. They were just as willing as white people to knock off
work to be photographed.</p>

<p>A baby kangaroo, still shaky on its little legs and bleating
much like a very young lamb, was the well-protected pet of the
camp, and a perfectly naked black boy, of about five years of age,
a model of symmetry, seemed to share its popularity. The aboriginal
mother of this small youth was camped in a dug-out half way up the
hillside. We visited her in time to witness the family ablutions.
The tableau presented could have passed for the advertisement of a
well-known brand of soap. The boy stood by, a picture of shining
cleanliness, while his sister, a few years older, knelt over a
basin, her head and neck a mass of lather, the victim of a furious
assault by the mother, who rubbed and scrubbed with vigour. Like
all children in such case she protested as noisily as she dared,
but the generous masses of the soap prevented any effective outcry.
We were told that these youngsters were scrubbed regularly and at
very frequent intervals.</p>

<p>Reluctantly we left this place of many interests (the camp's
second name is surely Hospitality!) and turned our cars to the
Queensland road. The Jervois Range, full of scenery which assuredly
will someday attract the tourist, lay before us and then the long
stock-route facing homewards.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c7" id="c7"></a>CHAPTER VII &mdash; HENRIETTA AND THE
ARTISTS</h2>

<p>Allow me to interpolate a chapter of sidelights on a journey
made with two artist friends, they in search of landscapes, I on
the track of fresh material for articles as well as fresh study of
the aboriginal. They had no occasion for haste, and I was in the
happy position of the retired man whose office cares were over, so
we made progress in a proper way, that is, leisurely. We took about
a month to reach Alice Springs, a journey commonly accomplished in
a few days. With rich humour they assured me that they had hurried
on my account! My retort was that I would advise any one desiring a
foretaste of Eternity to go on a long trip with artists.</p>

<p>It was a delightful three months that I spent in their company
and I left them with reluctance when I was recalled to Melbourne to
organize the Art Exhibition for the Victorian Centenary Council.
They were then busy, a couple of miles from Hermannsburg, putting
the Krichauff Range and the Macdonnells on to canvas and surrounded
by a horde of young aborigines from the Finke River Mission
Station.</p>

<p>We had many adventures, the most startling one occurring when we
had been barely a week in the field.</p>

<p>It was a lovely day. Young Winter was trying what he could do as
a maker of charming weather, and his experiment had turned out a
success. Sun and clouds combined to cast attractive patterns on the
landscape, and a mild dash of rain brightened everything. Even
Henrietta, our caravan, was affected. She fairly purred along the
road and, for once, required no driving.</p>

<p>We were in South Australia, bound for the still distant
Macdonnell Ranges. At our right was a railway line with which we
were running a parallel course. Soft green hills drooped down to us
on either hand, magpies warbled, a great flight of Galahs rose for
a few minutes from their feeding and floated like a rosy cloud a
few feet above the ground&mdash;never was there a more peaceful
scene.</p>

<p>The two artists, as they sat beside me, broke into snatches of
song, and my thoughts ran back home. There, in that far-away suburb
of Melbourne, my son and I would often turn on the wireless before
breakfast to enjoy a laugh at the "crooners." Some of their songs
had evidently revenged themselves by lingering in my consciousness,
for now I found myself, without at first realizing the fact,
singing:</p>

<p class="poem">La-a-azy Bones, lyin' in the shade,<br>
<p>How do you expect to get your corn-meal made?</p>

<p>But, while I had the tune, I found that I could not recall any
more of the words. That made it suddenly desirable. I appealed to
the others, but they declared they had never heard of the song.
"Well, it goes like this" said I&mdash;and the next moment
Henrietta rose up like a startled horse, took a desperate dive with
two wheels in the air and crashed over on her side.</p>

<p>People often speculate on their possible behaviour in times of
stress. I was in a car once when a pair of bolting horses hit it
from the rear and threw us all into a Sydney shop. Two plate-glass
windows went with us. We landed right-side uppermost and still in
the car. Our five passengers included two ladies and a small boy.
There should, of course, have been screams, or at least loud
exclamations. On the contrary there was dead silence for some
seconds, silence during which I perused a label on the back of a
sofa (we had landed in a furniture shop): "This handsome couch,
reduced to 59s. 6d." A quiet voice from one of the ladies broke the
spell: "I think we had better get out," it said.</p>

<p>In this new predicament was much the same apparent calm at
first. Perhaps we were really too astonished to express our state
of mind. As we tilted I recall saying to the driver, in tones of
remonstrance, "Oh, Ja-ack!" but that was all, till the artist below
me suggested that we had better get clear of the car for fear the
petrol caught alight. That woke us up! The car was really a truck
with a caravan perched on it. The one seat held the three of us.
When the crash occurred Rex was underneath, I lay on top of him and
Jack clung to the wheel, his heels dangling just over my head.
Those heels twinkled out of sight at the word "alight," I scrambled
after them and there we were, gazing at what seemed an immovable
ruin. We found we had overturned on a railway crossing. Had we
arranged it we could not have placed the car more exactly in the
middle of the line.</p>

<p>The oil painter looked up the line and down the line, then
without any warning he went mad&mdash;or so it seemed! He ran at
Jack, snatched from his head a scarlet beret which sat jauntily and
artistically there, and without a word set off at a run along the
permanent way. We watched him in amazement. He appeared to be
heading back for far-distant Victoria; only when his pace began to
slacken did we grasp his idea. He was out to stop a possible train
by holding up the red cap!</p>

<p>Back he came, as he realized that for all we knew the train
might come the other way. No pushing or lifting had any effect on
the caravan&mdash;the whole affair weighed some two tons&mdash;so
we started to unload it. The worst of having a caravan instead of
an ordinary car is its capacity for holding things. The trip was to
last six months, during most of which we would be well away from
civilization, so six months' stores, clothes, books, food,
canvases, painting material, pots and pans, bedding, stools, motor
spares, guns, rifles, cameras and numberless other articles
necessary for such a lengthy excursion had to be taken out and
piled on the roadside. The pile grew to astonishing
heights&mdash;surely no caravan ever held it all! As we ran to and
fro we noted with relief the strange fact that very little had been
broken. Certainly a case of apples strewed the highway, and odds
and ends of parcels, mysterious parcels some of them, had been
spilt out in the dust. At last all was clear&mdash;but no, a brown
paper bag still remained in the fairway. It looked to be empty and
I raised my foot to kick it to the side. A good thing I
didn't&mdash;it contained a set of false teeth!</p>

<p>Help came out of the blue. A truck stopped and the owner
produced a fine new rope, a railway trolley arrived with a gang of
willing men&mdash;in quick time Henrietta was again on her feet.
Then we learnt that a train was overdue&mdash;delayed down the line
somewhere!</p>

<i>The Brolga (Native Companion)</i>
</p>

<p>Thankfully we attended to Henrietta's bruises and abrasions and
repacked her innumerable goods. But, thinking back over the
adventurous days which were to follow, I cannot recall that any one
of us ever again attempted to sing "La-a-azy Bones."</p>

<p>Later on we were to find that there was more damage than
appeared on the surface. The steering gear went mad and at times
the car would charge off the track, despite all efforts to control
her, and burst wildly into the scrub. Sturdy mulga trees were
occasionally smashed flat and we lived disturbed lives for a few
days until we could effect repairs at a friendly cattle-station
where there was not only an anvil but a kit of blacksmith's
tools.</p>

<p>In one of the pauses I wrote a sketch which, by the way, to
reach a Melbourne newspaper, had a ninety-mile journey on
camel-back to a siding before it caught the fortnightly southbound
train. I called it "Time to Stand and Stare," quoting W. H.
Davies's</p>

<p class="poem">What is this life if, full of care,<br>
We find no time to stand and stare!</p>

<p class="newspaper">At last I am actually able to live up to a
poet's ideal: I have time to stand and stare. Indeed, I have
improved upon his injunction: I am sitting to do my gazing. But
mind, this staring business may have its disadvantages.<br>
<br>
It's all very well to have the time! What if you also have, as I
have at the moment of writing, a thousand hungry flies, persistent
as a canvasser, voracious as a shark, swarming into your eyes,
crawling into your ears, refusing to be frightened from your
hands&mdash;even the most ardent of poets would find his "stare"
somewhat disturbed.<br>
<br>
My seat is a petrol tin in the dry bed of the Coralella River (I
think that is the way it is spelt; it is the sandy depression next
that other sandy depression, the Hamilton River), so I am not far
from the southern boundary of the Northern Territory. In this month
of May the nights are cool&mdash;the temperature was 37 degrees
Fahrenheit this morning before the sun rose&mdash;but the sun is
distinctly warm. To-day may be classed as hot.<br>
<br>
My two artist friends, Messrs Battarbee and Gardner, are not
painting, though the huge white gums which adorn the river bed and
so miraculously withstand the recurring droughts must tempt them
sorely. They are engaged in one of those mysterious operations,
which, it appears, most caravans call for from time to time in such
rough country. Gadgets of various kinds are strewn about, and the
water-colourist should certainly change his medium, he is so oily.
He has discovered that Henrietta's steering gear is out of order
(Henrietta is our car's Christian name; she is Henrietta Ford in
full), and he has contrived to get most of the black grease of the
inside works on to his hands and arms.<br>
<br>
"Treat 'em rough!" he says, and bangs with a hammer. Possibly he
has in mind the old saw:</p>

<p class="poem">"A woman, a spaniel, and a walnut tree&mdash;<br>
The more you beat them the better they be!"</p>

<p class="newspaper">We have been on the road almost a month. "Time
to stand and stare" indeed! We left old man Hurry behind when we
left Melbourne, and he has not caught up to us since. We stop when
we like, where we like, and as long as we like, and so far we have
had a united mind about such matters. That mind has been to stop
often and stay long.<br>
<br>
Coober Pedy, for instance. An hour there satisfies the tourist
passing, as we are, on his way to Alice Springs, because the
tourist lives up to a time schedule.<br>
<br>
We arrived one evening after dark; it was three days before we
left. Happy days, each one of them. The clustering dumps on the
grey-green hillsides are opal-tinted when the sun is low: Nature
has used soft pastels to adorn this barren valley. Here the artists
had spent weeks two years before, and our days were passed in
visiting the friends they had made and listening to tales of that
most fascinating of all the gems (it is surely the most
varied)&mdash;the opal. And at night the old men gathered at our
camp-fire and talked till the moon rose to light them on the narrow
paths between the shafts to the dug-outs they call home.<br>
<br>
Just now a loaded car has passed. It stopped long enough to
disclose an M.H.R. visiting his constituency. His district is some
600 miles long, and presumably is wide in proportion. He has no
time to stand and stare; even as I write he is no more than a cloud
of dust in the distance.<br>
<br>
Every day has been fine. Henrietta never hurries, but even at that
we slow her down at the edge of a gibber rise that we may miss
nothing at all of "the vision splendid of the sunlit plains
extended," which has moved not only poets like Paterson, but
scientists like Gregory to admiration. The gibber itself, stones of
every size and colour, is full of interest, but it is the sandy
track which we watch the most, for on it are the records of every
creature that has walked, crawled, or hopped across it. A camel's
plate-like pad comes in, and we speculate upon his coming and
going; a snake has had a dust-bath there; a kangaroo's tail made
those depressions while he idled here; those broad arrows were
impressed by an emu's foot&mdash;we wonder if the dingo, whose
deeply indented toe-marks show that he was in a hurry, was after
that emu.<br>
<br>
But night is best in these solitudes. The camp-fire lights up the
whispering mulgas that stand round; the air scarcely moves; the
galaxy sparkles with, fittingly enough, the great constellation of
the emu defined&mdash;an outstanding figure as he thrusts his head
into the cross and sweeps his dark body to the horizon.<br>
<br>
That is the time to stare; you watch the myriad lights till sleep
dims your eyes&mdash;and lo! it is morning again.</p>

<p>Yes, the night time is often the best time in these solitudes. A
camp on a quiet evening by a waterhole is always enjoyable after a
day of travel. We would boil the billy and cook a meal, then would
come the inevitable yarn as we stretched out on our "naps" by the
fire till sleep drove us under the blankets.</p>

<p>The fire is the very heart of such a camp. Outside the circle of
its radiance is the wilderness; within is home. Just occasionally
was there trouble in picking a suitable spot when that must be in
the mulga or out on a plain. Water we carried on the car; wood
might be the missing requisite. We came close to being fireless one
night. Temperamental Henrietta had been doing well that day, she
was in one of her best moods. She almost sang as she tackled the
long stony rise from the saltpans at Wirrappa in South Australia to
the tableland, and my two artist friends once more broke into
carefree ballads that reflected her change of heart. Steadily we
rose. Looking back we saw a bunch of houses making mushroom-like
dots on the vast floor of the valley; the only sign of human
occupation in the whole wide view.</p>

<p>Behind the houses rose a line of hills with a gap through which
shone a false sea, an ocean of mirage, and on the right was a
veritable island, a blue cone, perfect in contour, standing in the
middle of a great dry lake of salt that glistened like snow.</p>

<p>Tradition has it that this "island" cannot be reached. Detail in
support is the tale of the teamster who set out for the spot with
camels, and he and the camels have not been seen since! Another
bushman said he would walk to it; he walked all day and got no
nearer!</p>

<p>Turning from this beautiful deceiver we faced an immense gibber
plain. Over it the track ran, a narrow twisting track which snaked
away and was lost to sight almost at once in the innumerable stones
strewn everywhere about. "Gibber" (the "g" as in "give") means
stone: never was a plain better named than this one. During the
next 600 miles of our journey we were to cross many more of these
plains, differing from each other only in the colour of the stones
or in their sizes.</p>

<p>Someone suggested that this was probably the place to which good
mathematicians go when they die, their enjoyable job being to
calculate the number of stones of each colour. Judging by what we
saw, this should easily occupy Eternity.</p>

<p>Should the contract exceed the period allotted, classification
by size, shape and material could be added to it. Greater diversity
could not be imagined. Miles of purple stones, miles of red, of
black, white, grey, yellow, cream and mauve, and often, towering
above them, astonishing flat-topped "residuals"&mdash;rocky hills
which someday will descend, as their fellows did before them, to
the gibber stage. Gazing at the scene one thought of the
Scriptural: "Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and
hill shall be brought low."</p>

<p>But we had come to this first plain late in the afternoon.
Although the days were warm we knew, camping as we had been from
night to night, that the evenings could be cold. Where was the wood
for that very necessary thing&mdash;our fire? Treeless, and bare of
all vegetation save a little stunted saltbush, the prospect ahead
was not promising. That prospect was wide indeed. We had not yet
advanced so far north as to have left all fences behind and we were
to learn that the paddock we had just entered was one hundred
square miles in extent. "There's only one tree in it," said our
informant. "It's in a corner, and it has a bird's nest in it." Our
natural wonder was where the other birds of that countryside found
nesting places!</p>

<p>A kangaroo sat solitary on the stones, looking very large where
all was so flat. As a missionary remarked at Alice Springs: "An
empty beer-bottle on those plains amounts to a change of scenery!"
We left the marsupial to his meditations and hurried on.</p>

<p>Some sandy stretches gave us hope, but the sun was still up and
we did not stop. Immediately came another flat world, this time
seemingly limitless. Out on its immensity we witnessed the
phenomenon of a perfectly level horizon the whole way round.
Nothing at all, whether tree, shrub, rock or hill, broke its
evenness. The setting sun was cut sharply across by the straight
line, seemed to hesitate a moment, then plunged out of sight.</p>

<p>Instantly came the dark, just as with the Ancient Mariner. We
pushed Henrietta as much as we dared, we leaned forward and peered
earnestly at every extra-dark object, we saw trees where there were
none, and other familiar objects suffered a night change further to
deceive us. "Timber at last!" called someone and pointed to where
the horizon ahead hid the stars. Yes, something broke the dim
skyline, but when we came to it the something was no more than a
single small bush which looked large in the general flatness. It
was distinguished on the principle that amongst the blind the
one-eyed is king.</p>

<p>We grew hungrier and silent. Still Henrietta rattled along,
still the darkness swallowed the world, the air grew
chillier&mdash;hang it! we <i>must</i> camp even if there were
nothing better than roots to burn. "There's an old dry lake about
here somewhere," said the driver. "Woa! Henrietta!" and we stopped
and clambered down. We found we were on the far edge of the gibber,
sand was replacing stone&mdash;"we'll push on a bit" was the
verdict. So away we went once more, hungrier than ever, ready to
camp at the first excuse. It came almost at once in the shape of a
patch of mulga.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later there was that peace which comes of a good
camp-fire, a good meal, and a good cup of tea; while all about us
was that wonderful silence which dwells in our spacious solitudes,
a silence in which you can hear your heart beat. (Nature, by the
way, made a mistake with that gibber. Instead of spreading those
broken stones over the Inland she should have dumped them in our
suburbs for the municipalities to make roads with. They are wasted
where they are.)</p>

<p>But there were other nights, not quite so peaceful.</p>

<p>It is said that a city never sleeps. That is much truer of the
bush. As the dark puts an end to the activities of the day
creatures, another great army stirs and comes from its hiding
places to keep going, without perceptible break, that merry game of
Life and Death in which we are all engaged.</p>

<p>Doubtless there are nocturnal animals in Australia of which man
knows nothing&mdash;little secret things, voiceless, furtive in
their habits, never exercising save in the comparative safety of
darkness. But there are many others which advertise themselves by
voice or deed, and from some of these, harmless as they generally
are, the traveller in lonely places may, if only for a moment, know
a thrill as great as if he heard a lion roar. Walking at midnight,
in Victoria, tired and half asleep, I have leaped round with gun
upraised because a curlew has suddenly uttered its bloodcurdling
wail beside me. I have stopped dead, too, at the frightened scream
of an unseen koala. The time and the place produce the effect quite
as much as does the noise itself.</p>

<p>In these trips to Central Australia, it was usually the
unexpected which made us really interested in the night cries.</p>

<p>The dingoes contributed the most exciting item. We had heard
them, solo and chorus, many times as we camped in their hunting
grounds, and occasionally they had come pretty close.</p>

<p>Now there is a certain romance about the distant calls of a
pack, but when you are wakened by the yell of a very large wild dog
and find him standing but a few yards from your bed, that is much
too near to suggest poetry. Rather it suggests the urgent need for
a gun. So it was at a camp in the Ellery Creek Gorge. We were
sleeping by the fire one moment, the next we were sitting upright
with this appalling shriek ringing in our ears. The moon was at the
full; in the clear light stood the dingo, less than fifty feet
away, regarding us with smouldering eyes. He raised his head and
howled again; the echoes took it up and two more dogs broke into
despairing howls on the other side of us. The next moment with a
whoof! (the nearest approach to a bark which I have heard from a
wild dog) he had gone like a shadow.</p>

<p>The tracks in the morning showed that three dogs, one a
particularly fine specimen, had passed through the camp, between
the fire where we lay and the car in which the third member of the
party slept.</p>

<p>The Central Australian gorges have a greater variety and volume
of wild life than would be suspected by one who merely travels
along them and notes their rocky sides and sandy beds. To stay in
them for a week is to discover an interesting day population, and
to realize that there is an even more interesting body of nocturnal
animals. Game tracks were everywhere in that Ellery Creek Gorge,
all ending in the one rock pool where water was still to be had. In
that small pool, by the way, were some fair-sized fish, wily
veterans who refused to take any bait, however enticing, and who
just as definitely declined to visit the shallows where they might
be speared, native fashion. Their younger relatives, however, were
more obliging and during a ten days sojourn in the gorge, but
largely owing to certain pools in the near-by Finke, we had that
most unlikely thing in such a dry country, five meals of fresh
fish. After one rod had landed sixty-one perch, yellow-belly and
bream, the successful fisherman suggested the formation of an
Inland Fish Supply Company!</p>

<p>The Fish Hawk was constantly with us, uttering that whistling
call or his, which is at once challenging and mournful. He is a
lordly bird on the wing, but, for his dignity's sake he should
never descend to earth. It is then that you discover that he wears
feather trousers of the Oxford type, too wide for elegance. He
walks, too, as if they chafed him.</p>

<br>
<i>Pool in the Finke at Henbury Station</i>
</p>

<p>He and the crow (a white-eyed, sad-voiced creature who is
possibly of the short-billed variety) were the only diurnal birds
of prey that we observed at this camp, but strange screeches in the
dark indicated that several varieties of owl were operating in the
neighbourhood. High cliffs, with caves and crevices innumerable,
formed the walls of the gorge and afforded homes for many
creatures, including the bats which did such remarkable aerial
gymnastics every evening between us and the western sky.</p>

<p>Parrots are not usually regarded as birds of the darkness, but
we were in a countryside where one, at least, of the family is
credited with nocturnal habits. He is known indeed as the Night
Parrot (<i>Geopsittacus occidentalis</i>) and, naturally enough, he
is one of the rarest of Australian birds. His home is said to be in
the porcupine grass; there was abundance of the prickly tussocks
about the crest of the rises.</p>

<p>On two occasions, late at night, we heard bird-calls which we
could not associate with any night-bird known to us, and which very
definitely suggested the cry of a parrot.</p>

<p>Since a certain expedition a few years ago, the Night Parrot has
interested the bushmen, and they are watching for it. Aborigines
are also taking a hand in the pursuit of this elusive bird. An
observant station owner, who has a fine aviary at his homestead,
pointed out the large eyes of the Bourke Parrots and said that
these parrots assuredly fly by night. He had camped at waterholes
and noted that the Bourkes always came to drink after darkness had
set in. They would arrive in a flock, and with them, quite often,
would be a single bird, or perhaps a couple, with a different beat
of wing. They could not be seen, of course&mdash;it was only his
keen ears, trained to recognize every bush sound, that could
distinguish something strange. This happened repeatedly. The Night
Parrot is so commonly alone, on the rare occasions when he is seen,
that the bushmen have named him the Solitaire, so it is quite
possible that the individual bird which joins the Bourkes in their
evening drink is Geopsittacus.</p>

<p>Another native of the Inland, commonly called the Elegant
Parrot, is also largely nocturnal of habit. A pair kept in an
aviary had to be removed because they flew about the cage so much
after dark that the other birds could not rest.</p>

<p>None of these parrots were definitely visitors to our Ellery
camp. To lie quiet there was to find the valley gradually wakening
to a stealthy life, a life which seemed to be all adventure. The
stones in the creek would be stirred, not to a rattling, but to a
sibilant sound as the feet of rabbits and other small animals
touched them lightly; a kangaroo would introduce a new note as he
dragged himself gently over the sand with tail depressed (we would
see his pad next day); a crash of rocks would betray where a euro
had made a bad landing as he scaled the craggy hillside, or there
would come the thump! thump! of one of the tribe racing across the
flat. Titchi-ritchi-ritchi-ra, the wagtail, might raise a sleepy
song, and the mewing of a cat, the tame cat gone wild to become the
most destructive of prowlers, might add to these bush surroundings
an unexpected touch of the city. The whole place, between the great
red residuals, would be filled with gentle whispering noise until,
faint and far and almost musical, or near and menacing, would sound
the agonized cry of the hunting pack, and for a few moments all
would be still.</p>

<p>Often the dingoes were the first to announce the dusk.
Frequently they closed the night's proceedings. Their day ended
with the coming of the dawn and, wailing always as though life held
nothing for them but misery, they passed to their lairs.</p>

<p>For reasons not wholly unconnected with Henrietta and her
grievances we camped for five days at the public well on the flat
between Alice Springs and her guarding Macdonnells. A paternal and
well-meaning government had caused the well to be dug, lined with
boards, and equipped with a windlass, a rope and bucket. It was
built, as the boys say, "for keeps." The iron handles of the
windlass were long enough to take two men apiece, the metal rope
would have held a team of bullocks, the bucket suggested a young
tank. Fortunately the bucket leaked, or none but a strong man could
have raised it unaided. As it was, the well was a great public
convenience in a dry and thirsty land.</p>

<p>Teamsters used it for their horses or donkeys, the occasional
motorist pulled in to refresh his radiator, an Afghan filled the
trough for his string of camels, but its most regular users were
the "travellers"&mdash;the swagmen (or "bagmen" as they are called
in some of the back-country places), the unemployed moving from
place to place looking for work, and that large army of men who are
constantly "padding the hoof" in a purposeless sort of way about
Australia.</p>

<p>A rough fence stood round the place. Within this enclosure they
camped. Most of them stayed only a day or two before moving on,
birds of passage with definite objectives such as this or that
goldfield, or men to whom one place was just as good as another,
merely tramping along to satisfy a craving for change.</p>

<p>One remained constant. We came to know him as the Philosopher.
"Been here a year" he told us, and by long residence considered
himself the guardian of the place, enforcing decency from the more
casual lodgers and counting himself paid in the study their many
types afforded. He was keen to know where each had come from, what
he had been, and where he was going, and very dexterously he set
about his inquiries, varying them to suit the temperaments of his
victims. In better circumstances he would have been a
psycho-analyst: his analyses were shrewd pieces of work, and he
drew conclusions possible only to one who had had wide experience
of the vagaries of his fellowmen.</p>

<p>"Paddy's gone!" he announced one evening, settling himself
comfortably on his heels at our fire. "I found out he was in one of
them crack Dragoon regiments in the old country, and he says he was
one of the Prince's escort when he was in South Africa. Funny go to
be here humping bluey after all that! You didn't see that chap who
come in last night I suppose? Neatest fellow I ever see. Clean! Why
he carried a scrubbing brush and he scrubbed himself when he got up
this morning! Had a little bag for his knife and fork! Do you know
he had 70 on him!" (Now, how had he found that out!) "He's off
too; says he's going through on foot to the 'top end,' but he'll
soon be looking for a lift I reckon..."</p>

<p>Here he was interrupted. The young, frank-faced cyclist whose
wheel-tracks we had followed for a good many hundred miles, and who
had been resting here for a day or two, had come across to say
good-bye. He, also, was heading north, hoping, when the thousand
miles to Darwin were behind him, to come down the western coast,
and so return to his native town of Perth. He had started out from
the Western Australian capital with less than ten shillings, had
secured a job here and there, and as to the rest he spoke highly
(as indeed everyone must) of the hospitality of most of the station
holders whose homesteads had been on his route. He was leaving now,
he said, with some tucker and sevenpence. "Time I got another job,"
was his cheerful comment. "It's a great life!" and he was away with
a laugh to commence his long and lonely ride.</p>

<p>The Philosopher gazed after him thoughtfully. "Aye, it's well to
be young! By the way, did you see the cove staying up at the pub?
He looks as if he'd come out of one of them moving pictures of
exploring in Africa. But we get some funny blokes here, I can tell
you, since the railway's through. Jest a few weeks ago quite a
young feller was parading the town and he was something to look at.
He had shorts on his legs and wore a khaki shirt, and a big sun
helmet, and round his waist was a belt with dozens of cartridges
and two large revolvers. Someone asked him what it was all for, and
he said he had been told the natives were very savage and dangerous
about here, and he was going on to a part where very few white men
had been before. I dunno who had been pulling his leg. The place he
named has been running cattle for fifty year, and all the natives
he'll ever see there are working on the run." He stopped to
laugh.</p>

<p>"Talking of natives," he went on, "I've seen some queer things
in this country. I was goin' across from Blank to Blank" (he named
two back-country stations) "and I come on a camp of wild blacks.
There was a devil of a row going on. The old king was dying and he
was stretched out there with all the men beating sticks together
round about him, and dapping their hands and singing, and an old
gin was feeding him with grubs&mdash;jest like a bird!...He got
better!...You know, those niggers can do some things that no white
man can get the hang of. And they're born <i>old</i> too&mdash;I
walked into a camp out back three hours after a gin had had a baby.
The kid was lying in a wurley in one of them wooden pitchis and by
the Lord, when I come in, it smiled at me! Yes, it smiled at me,
only three hours old!...me hair stood up!</p>

<p>"They got a way of letting one another know what's going on, and
they won't tell how they do it. Not they! I dunno that they know
themselves how they do it. It's a sort of wireless of their own...I
was at a place 350 miles from Oodnadatta and one of the gins come
in and said to the boss 'big pfella wheelbarrow leavem Oodnadatta,
come along this way,' and, sure enough, a big truck duly arrived at
the station and it left Oodnadatta when the woman said it did. That
was when motor-trucks were hardly known up here.</p>

<p>"They're rummy beggars, all right. And they can be pretty decent
too...Had to leave a mate of mine in a blacks' camp once when he
fell sick, and an old woman looked after him wonderful. Some of
them are as tough as hell. Did So-and-So (he named a well-known
landowner) ever tell you about the gin who poisoned herself? She
found ten poison baits, strychnine they were, in a tin and melted
them down for the fat. Of course she drunk it, and, when the boss
was fetched, the only sign of life was a bit of a twitch in her
limbs now and again. He forced some charcoal and stuff down her
throat and, you believe me, she not only got better but she's put
on weight ever since. She's quite a plump nigger now!</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was an overdose. They say strychnine won't kill you
if you take enough of it. Anyway it won't kill niggers or donkeys.
The policeman at Blank made a damper one day and put it out on the
fence to cool and a feller's donkey reached over and et it. 'I'll
settle that donk,' said the cop, and he made another damper and put
it in the same place. He come over to me next day: 'Is it possible
to poison donkeys?' says he, 'because that feller there has been
walking about for twenty-four hours with half a bottle of

<h2><a name="c8" id="c8"></a>CHAPTER VIII &mdash; FAR BACK</h2>

<p>Eight of us, in two Ford cars, formed the party which, in 1933,
travelled by way of Port Augusta and Coober Pedy to Hermannsburg
and Alice Springs, then north and northeast to the mica mines in
the Jervois Range, into western Queensland, down the Birdsville
track (to the east of Lake Eyre) on to Marree, through the Flinders
Range to Broken Hill and so back to Victoria. Our leader was A. S.
Kenyon, then one of the Commissioners of the Victorian State Rivers
and Water Supply, and the rest of the party consisted of Jack
Shoebridge (who was also an officer of the State Rivers), H. P.
McColl, A. H. Mattingley and my brother Charles Croll (members of
the Field Naturalists' Club), Chris. Bailey (of the Melbourne
Walking Club), Ron. Neal (of the literary staff of the <i>Age</i>
newspaper), and myself, on furlough from the Victorian Education
Department. It was too long a trip to describe in detail, so I
shall mention only a few of the unusual incidents.</p>

<p>Like the jolly swagman of the well-known song we camped one
evening by a billabong under the shade of a coolabah-tree. From
another coolabah, rather more distant, hung our aerial, for part of
the car's equipment was a four-valve wireless set to give us dinner
music and the news of home as we sat by the camp-fire. In these
days, with the ends of the earth speaking together as near
neighbours, there may be nothing remarkable in hearing the
conversations and music of a mere thousand miles away, but our
situation made for wonder. We were in the very heart of that
immense region, Central Australia, surrounded by endless miles in
which the only trace of settlement was the occasional lonely
cattle-station. "What is your acreage?" a townsman inquired of one
of these cattlemen. The man looked blank&mdash;"acreage?" he
queried. Then he smiled and added: "We have 5000 square miles!" It
is a land without fences. "Where are your boundaries?" was asked at
another station. The reply was: "Fifty-four miles over there"
(pointing east) "and forty-six that way" (pointing west). One
hundred miles across the run&mdash;no wonder men get lost in what
are called the home paddocks!</p>

<p>The air was mellow, neither hot nor cold, the stars were clear,
no wind blew to disturb the harmony of the night. Brolgas had been
calling at sundown and Galahs had created the usual disturbance as
they settled in their roosting places; but now the only native
sound was the very distant moaning of a Boobook Owl. Everything was
perfect for reception, and the voice of an announcer in a far
distant city came to us with startling clearness. Music followed
and we listened, charmed as much by the ideal conditions as by the
playing or the singing. The thoughts of most of us, I fancy, were
back at home, and no one noticed for a time that three strangers
had arrived in the camp.</p>

<p>Two were white men, the third an elderly aboriginal. All seemed
fascinated by the wireless.</p>

<i>A Claypan Near Oodnadatta</i>
</p>

<p>In the course of our journey that day we had come to two
stations, the second just at the end of the afternoon. At the
latter we had been most hospitably received, given some very
welcome fresh bread and directed to this waterhole. The house stood
about a quarter of a mile away and on the quiet air our music had
readily reached it. These were the advance guards; presently we
were to learn that the rest of the family waited in the shadows for
an invitation to come closer and share the concert. Fourteen of
them there were&mdash;men, women and children, and, incredible as
it may sound, not one of them had heard wireless before.</p>

<p>We turned on the headlights, spread a tarpaulin as a dress
circle and called on Melbourne and Sydney and Adelaide and even
distant Hobart to entertain our guests. Nobly they responded and
poured out to the enraptured audience a medley of speeches and
songs and instrumental music. The efforts of a boys' club seemed
most popular. A mouth-organ competition excited particular
interest, while the two leaders of the club would have been
flattered could they have known the reception their jokes were
given.</p>

<p>Swinging to another station a musical play was caught. This had
originally been produced by the B.B.C. in London. How remote the
artificiality of its life seemed in this setting! One wondered
incidentally what pictures the scenes in theatres and in French
cafs conjured up in the minds of some of our auditors. Old Binghi,
the blackfellow, crouching well back in the darkness, appeared to
be the most absorbed of all. The play was a success with its bush
listeners. They obviously relished the bright dialogue and the
catchy airs; probably the refrain of "Pray don't mention it, it's
been no trouble at all," which kept recurring through the piece, is
part of the common speech of that station to-day.</p>

<p>But time went on and still our guests stayed. We enjoyed their
presence but were dead weary after a heavy day. Our cook rose to
the occasion. He would give them a hint. After sundry incantations
at the fire he returned with a large billy of coffee and proceeded
to serve it with some biscuits. We had only eight mugs, but somehow
they went round. "Folk always go soon after supper," the cook
confided to me. But these did not. The babies went off to sleep and
the elders settled themselves again, refreshed and ready for still
more wireless. Our driver, whose set it was, wanted to go to bed
but did not like to leave it to others to turn off. The hour was
getting late. "It's pretty rough," he growled, "with such a tough
day before us to-morrow." But at that moment, mockingly, came the
last words of the play: "Pray don't mention it, it's been no
trouble at all!" and the party broke up with many protestations of
goodwill.</p>

<p>Earlier in the month we had listened while Mr Lyons, as Prime
Minister, told us (and incidentally others) of his budget
proposals. We were then in some mulga on the edge of a gibber plain
north of Coober Pedy, and about 900 miles in a direct line from
Melbourne. Australia has been labelled a land of contrasts: the
Members of Parliament sat in their comfortable chamber on padded
seats to hear the tale of the Commonwealth's recovery&mdash;we
heard it equally well sitting on swags, or petrol cases, with the
darkness like a wall beyond the circle of the firelight, and the
bush peering in as if to see what sort of creatures men are.</p>

<p>But our wireless was to meet its Waterloo. It became so popular
that we lost it. We had crossed into western Queensland and stopped
for the night at a station which could be counted large even in
that country of wide spaces. Its area is 10,000 square miles and at
one time, before the seven years' drought, it boasted 40,000 head
of cattle. When the drought broke, by the way, the head station,
standing as it does just above the river, became an island. The men
working outback could not get within five miles of their
headquarters so a boat was placed on the top of a car, carried over
the near sandhills and launched on the far side to convey
provisions to them. Truly a land of contrasts&mdash;drought and
flood!</p>

<p>A dozen men, homely, hospitable, gathered about the wireless.
Even a meal would scarcely draw them from it. None had been heard
on the station before. It was in particularly good form that night.
Long before the voices ceased I had turned in. Half asleep I was
aware that many wireless stations were being tried and dimly I
could see that the set was being closely examined.</p>

<p>"Where's the wireless?" someone asked next morning as we were
packing. "Sold it!" was the reply. The demand had been too
insistent to refuse. We missed it, but we felt that, like the
satisfactory boy scout, we had done at least one good deed in our
travels.</p>

<p>It was in that same region that we were privileged to see a
sight which was extraordinary indeed.</p>

<p>The tale of the Passenger Pigeon of North America is well known.
Its countless numbers and its astonishing disappearance form one of
the wonders of ornithology. The birds were slaughtered for food,
and often wantonly because killing was so easy. In one year fifteen
millions of their carcasses were exported. To-day not one Passenger
Pigeon is known to be alive though substantial rewards have been
offered for the production of a single pair.</p>

<p>It was with some thought of this tragedy that we watched the
passing of a huge flight of our charming little "love birds," the
Budgerigahs. They, too, were in thousands. While they retain their
present popularity as cage-birds they cannot become extinct (though
the tendency is to breed as far away as possible from the original
colours) but the reflection would come that the wholesale and
persistent trapping which goes on may possibly lead to complete
destruction in their native haunts.</p>

<p>We had camped for the night at a waterhole in the Jervois Range,
some couple of hundred miles north-east of Alice Springs, so not
far from the western border of Queensland. As we breakfasted, two
aborigines came across from a patch of scrub and stood with an
expectant look at the food. One was truly a fine specimen of
manhood, well built, good-looking by any standard, his countenance
attractive, his eye clear and intelligent. He answered to the name
of Jack. The other man, an older full blood, said his name was Pred
(most aborigines find the F sound difficult). We had been speaking
for a few minutes when a curious noise overhead made us all look
up.</p>

<p>I had never before seen such a sight. At first glance the air
seemed full of Budgerigahs. They were ten or twenty deep and they
came in a long procession which stretched back farther than the eye
could carry. Sometimes twenty feet up, sometimes just out of arm's
length, they swept on above us in a green cloud which seemed
endless. The crisp beat of multitudes of tiny wings produced a
sound like the dry rustling of a swarm of locusts; through it ran a
faint lisping&mdash;the voices of the birds. Unlike most parrots
they did not scream as they flew, but merely whispered softly.</p>

<p>How mate kept by mate in these hurrying thousands and where they
were all to find nesting hollows were conundrums quite beyond our
guessing.</p>

<p>Evidently they knew of this waterhole and had headed to it for
the morning drink. But we were a disturbing factor and they broke
their ordered companies and wheeled about the creekside in groups
which changed colour each time they presented a fresh angle to the
light. Only when we began to move away did they, squadron by
squadron, light at the water-edge to quench their thirst. The long
lines of dainty heads dipped to the water and rose, dipped and
rose; other lines took their places to repeat the performance; both
ground and air were alive with the charming creatures.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jack had been busy. Sentiment is all very well when
the stomach is full; we had breakfasted but he had not. Moreover
there was a lubra over in the wurley who had to be fed. Here was
tucker. He hurled a boomerang through the thick masses and we saw a
miracle: the ranks opened out and not a bird was hit! He repeated
the shot, with the same result. Then one of our party threw a
gibber; once more the birds, incredible as it may sound, dodged the
missile. Desperate, the blackfellow picked up a big stick and put
all the power of his strong arm into a throw fair in the face of an
oncoming swarm. This time there was a crash and five birds
fell&mdash;Jack had his breakfast at his feet.</p>

<p>We were to see more of these birds as we went on our way, for
they, like ourselves, were travelling south. I have wondered if we
reached the Riverina before the main body; certain it is we saw
detachments from time to time. One big flight was resting at the
Cockroach Waterhole. Just before coming to its very muddy
depression, by the way, we had almost run over a <i>printi</i> (the
giant lizard of these parts) about seven feet long.</p>

<p>Standing in the shallows, looking more like a carved image than
anything living, was a handsome white spoonbill. She may have been
fishing, but her stillness suggested rather that she was lost in
admiration of her own reflection. Crows called their dismal
messages to each other and flew aimlessly about while swiftly, but
steadily (as become creatures on business bent), a pair of falcons
patrolled the creek bed. A belt of low timber on the far side gave
shelter to an amazing number of finches and Budgerigahs. As a
falcon passed on his sentry-go they came out in a dense cloud
behind him and settled at the river's brim to snatch a hasty
mouthful. It was the old game of tip and run: they were no sooner
down than they were up and making for safety.</p>

<p>Always was the group a mixed one of parrots and finches, and the
falcons appeared to love both equally. Every time the big birds
passed they swooped to catch one of the flock, and every time they
missed. The small things seemed to enjoy the hurried flight to the
water, the hasty mouthful, the swift return to the timber, dodging
this way and that to avoid the savage claws.</p>

<p>These remarkable flights of the Shell Parrots (as the
Budgerigahs are commonly called) came, seemingly, from the far
north, where droughts are but little known. Other birds, more
local, had apparently suffered badly from the dry spell which
gripped for so many years the heart of the continent. The varieties
were still present but their numbers had thinned.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to note companies of the Brolga (the Native
Companion) feeding on the plains, even if the groups were small.
Few people, fortunately, regard the Brolga as game, but
occasionally this handsome bird is shot to eat. The cook, a
stalwart humorist who ruled at a back-country station, gave us some
hints regarding the cooking of a Native Companion should we be
forced to try one for a meal. "Put a big stone in the pot with it,"
said he. "When the stone is tender, so is the brolga!" As the
laughter subsided he added: "There's another way. Stuff the brolga
with a duck. When the duck is ready you can throw the brolga
away!"</p>

<h2><a name="c9" id="c9"></a>CHAPTER IX &mdash; THE
AMELIORATOR</h2>

<p>"Dat mission, he is de best t'ing ever come to dis country,"
said old Hungarian Joe as we sat on petrol cases round a camp-fire
one night in Central Australia. He rose and marched up and down,
sawing the air excitedly with the hand that held his pipe.</p>

<p>"An' I'm Roman Cat'lic!" he added, with an emphasis that
disposed of all argument.</p>

<p>We were motoring northward. Our car broke down in the Macdonnell
Ranges when we were within cooee of Alice Springs. Largely (I'm
afraid) as a compliment to the clergyman who had proved himself a
healer of cars as well as of souls, we attended church on Sunday
night. It was the only Protestant church building, by the way, in
all the vast territory between Marree in South Australia and Darwin
in the Northern Territory. There we heard our friend the Methodist
minister pay public tribute to the work of another denomination. He
spoke of "that great and good man John Flynn, whose services the
Inland can never repay."</p>

<p>And I was to hear still another sect join in the chorus of
praise. It was at Hermannsburg, where the Lutherans conduct the
long-established Finke River Mission. The conviction was there
confided to me that, lacking the efforts of the Presbyterian Church
in the form of its Inland Mission, the heart of our continent would
never really be fit for white people.</p>

<p>It was the Australian Inland Mission, the A.I.M. of John Flynn's
dream, of which all these people spoke so cordially. It has known
no distinction of creed and, like the similar mission conducted by
the Methodists, which walks along many parallel lines with the
A.I.M., it will go to the aid of any white man, without question,
no matter where he may be in the lonely depths of that huge
territory.</p>

<p>Everybody knows now of the Flying Doctor, but does everybody
realize that until the A.I.M. came into existence there were
citizens living hundreds of miles from any medical aid, and that
some still do so? It is to aid people so situated that a larger
organization, known as the Australian Aerial Medical Services, has
come into being. It is hoped that this national organization, which
has sprung out of the A.I.M., will become Australia-wide and be
supported accordingly.</p>

<br>
<i>The "Mantle of Safety"</i>
</p>

<p>How would you like it, O Citizen of Melbourne, if you had to set
out and ride to Sydney for a doctor when your wife fell ill or your
mate broke his leg? But these back-country six hundred miles would
not be on the sort of highway you get between capitals. Another few
thousands out of our city riches and we make those people safe, for
all, then, may have the ingenious sending-and-receiving wireless
sets invented by the A.I.M. and may have also the inestimable boon
of a medical service which uses the most expeditious form of
transport yet devised by man&mdash;the aeroplane. Although Victoria
has no "back-blocks" to be served by this scheme, it was here that
the scheme originated and this State has ever given liberally in
its support.</p>

<p>Lonely beyond belief are some of those outposts. The homestead
of a station 5000 square miles in extent cannot well have near
neighbours. But the A.A.M.S. is mending even that. Sitting
pedalling at her wireless set, very much as if she were at her
sewing-machine, the housewife, so cut off from the world, may
gossip ("over the back fence," as Dr Vickers put it) to the
housewife next door, perhaps 200 miles away!</p>

<p>The comfort of that possibility! To exchange thoughts and ideas
is the commonplace of our city existence&mdash;what must this
possibility mean to folk who seldom see a stranger!</p>

<p>Another valuable aspect is also apparent. The relative safety
created by this organization, and its power to destroy loneliness,
have made the Inland more attractive to the white woman. That means
not only increased settlement but a general improvement in health
and morals. It follows that such a scandal as the half-caste
problem must be reduced by this, although, in my pessimistic view,
it can never be wholly wiped out.</p>

<p>If there is a service in this world to which we Australians
should subscribe, it is the A.A.M.S., for it exists solely to help
our own people and incidentally to make our land fully
habitable.</p>

<h2><a name="c10" id="c10"></a>CHAPTER X &mdash; FACT, MYTH,
LEGEND, GOSSIP</h2>

<p>Gathering together loose ends of memory, how many interesting
items, otherwise unrecorded, present themselves. Scraps they are
mostly, things noted at a casual glance because peculiar to this
wild region, or perhaps more seriously because they proved
themselves matters of some importance. The general result is a kind
of mental moving picture, a "talkie" at that. On the inward screen
I see, for instance, a naked aboriginal whose dignity and grace of
carriage would distinguish him in any company in the world; the
skyline of a rugged range of high hills with unbelievably fantastic
weathering; a burst of crimson which is a sandhill so vivid in
colour that, seeing it suddenly in reality I exclaimed "A bush
fire!", and so on and so on. And I hear again the talk of this and
that&mdash;tall tales told by the grave-faced bushmen with never a
twinkle to betray their humour; grim stories of drought and fear
and death; the expression of beliefs scientifically based or merely
the children of credulity; shrewd observations on life as a whole;
and, binding all as with a loosely-woven thread, gossip that one
has gathered at friendly firesides or in casual camps during many
tours.</p>

<p>Much of that gossip, of course, it would be unfair to repeat,
but it helps, more than anything else, to give life to the
picture.</p>

<p>A famous jurist once asked, jestingly or in sad earnest: "What
is truth?" Perhaps nowhere is that more difficult to define than in
this red heart of Australia. A prodigal, but seemingly grudging,
Nature practises disguises until one learns to be slow indeed in
answering even such a customarily plain question as&mdash;is this
life or death? He was a competent observer who pronounced judgment,
after several years' experience, that here is a desert, a land
where no rain falls and no grass grows. But he was equally
competent who, the very next year, reported a smiling garden where
the other man's desolation had been. Desert, said one; a land of
plenty, said the other.</p>

<p>I have told elsewhere of a seed germinating and producing a
plant eighteen inches high in exactly fourteen days. Moreover the
plant was in flower. That seed, seemingly dead, had blown about in
the shifting sand for perhaps years. Somehow we are not so
astonished at tenacity of life in vegetation, but what of the
molluscs <i>(Bithinia australis)</i> gathered by Sir Baldwin
Spencer from the bed of a dried-up waterhole&mdash;just to quote a
well-authenticated case of animal survival after extreme
desiccation. He records that he placed the tiny creatures in a tin
matchbox and forgot about them till he opened the box fifteen
months later in his Melbourne laboratory. They were still
alive!</p>

<p>The claypans in which such animals live are features of every
plain. They are usually shallow depressions which hold water for
only a short period after rain and may continue dry for years on
end. Their parched surfaces will then be covered with curled-up
flakes of thin clay and fissures open to the depth of a foot and
over. Nothing more utterly barren could be imagined, but beneath
that arid crust live creatures, endowed like the <i>Bithinia</i>
just mentioned, which, dead though they appear, will know
resurrection when the rain transforms the pan into a pool. The
Burrowing or Water-holding Frog is not the least remarkable of
these aestivating animals. When the pools begin to dry it fills
itself with water and burrows deep. The mud closes firmly round it
and there, in a chamber just its own size, it sleeps away the
period of drought.</p>

<p>The natives, with their almost incredible skill in discerning
signs, have little difficulty in discovering the hiding places, and
in times of drought they will dig out the frogs and drink the
liquid the provident creatures had intended for their own use.
Spencer tested the water and found it perfectly pure and fresh.</p>

<p>Those pools, transient as they are, are rich with life almost as
soon as rain comes. Birds, such as duck, water-hens, teal and
plover appear from the unknown, frogs croak, water-beetles and
other "small deer" dart about. Nardoo and similar plants give
brightness to the water and its edges and hasten to their appointed
task of continuing the species&mdash;no transformation scene ever
presented a more startling change.</p>

<p>The ability of the aboriginal to find water does not always
serve him. My two artist companions, Messrs Battarbee and Gardner,
on an earlier trip to the interior, found a native in the last
stages of exhaustion. It was near the dry bed of a river, and the
man, almost dying of thirst, had dug numbers of holes in the sand
in his search of water. There has been much discussion regarding
the capacity of a blackfellow for food and drink&mdash;this big,
able-bodied man drank, straight on end, four dishfuls of water, in
all a measured two gallons! Prolonged droughts have accustomed
these people to "perishes." Little wonder they gorge deep when
plenty comes their way.</p>

<p>Because the country is naturally arid (apparently it is becoming
increasingly so) the note commonly struck is that of desolation,
yet, as I have stressed, beauty is always there, beauty of a kind
which betrays itself somewhat shyly till you have been blooded to
its wild charm. Then it holds you, whatever your station. Dr
Madigan is the latest scientist to confess in print its powerful
attraction. Long before him Gregory, in <i>The Dead Heart of
Australia,</i> spoke of the glamour of the</p>

<p class="quote">...wide plain, the low horizon and the magnificent
expanse of sky, giving a sense of joyful freedom. Watching the
desert at sunrise, and the soft, rich colours in their rapid play
on plain and sky, I felt thrilled again by the weird fascination of
it all and impatient to follow over the table-topped hills into the
haze-filled basin beyond.</p>

<p>Baldwin Spencer, too, possibly the most capable all-round member
of any trans-Australian expedition, a scientist who was also
artist, paused many times in his scientific recordings to picture
the scene in terms of praise. Observing a sunset across a gibber
plain he wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">Away to the east the land rises to flat-topped
terraced ranges. In the foreground are white-blue salt-bushes with
pale light blue patches of herbage and still lighter tufts of grass
amongst them, standing out in strong contrast to the purple-brown
gibbers. Dark lines of mulga mark the creek-bed, and streak away to
the hills which stand out sharply against a cold steel-blue sky
which melts into salmon pink and this into dark ultramarine. In the
west is a rich after-glow; against it the stony plains and hills
look dark purple with the Mulga branches standing out sharp and
thin.</p>

<p>Strange that so few painters have attempted to capture these
scenes; those who had done so could be numbered on the fingers of
one hand.</p>

<p>There is a flavour of romance (rather spoilt by greed of gain)
about some of the Inland birds. Most evasive and desirable of them
all is the Night Parrot, already referred to. Both science and
commerce covet it; it has been sought by ornithologists especially
sent out for its capture and it has been eagerly watched for in
recent years by doggers and cattlemen and aborigines. Rumour has
raised its value, until I have heard it quoted in the Inland as
500 for a single bird! Seldom seen at any time, mainly because of
its nocturnal habits, and never flying, like most parrots, in
flocks, it has seemingly vanished altogether. Its custom of nesting
low in the porcupine grass and going abroad at night has possibly
made it an easy prey to that scourge of our bush, the tame cat gone
wild.</p>

<p>It was in 1923 that perhaps the most determined attempt was made
to secure specimens of this elusive bird. Commissioned by the
well-known collector, H. L. White, of Belltrees, New South Wales,
F. L. Whitlock set out for the Centre, eventually making his
headquarters for some time at the Finke River Mission Station,
Hermannsburg. From there he worked thoroughly the likely places.
The natives told him that they knew Tnokkapaltara, as they called
the Night Parrot, but that it was scarce and seldom seen. It was
occasionally flushed from the porcupine grass, under which it
tunnelled, and was so poor a flier in daylight that it could
readily be run down. The sequel to this effort was both tragic and
comic: the scientist saw not so much as a feather of the desired
bird but (this was discovered all too late) the native children one
day caught, cooked and ate a specimen while he was still at the
station.</p>

<p>More recent endeavours have met with the same want of success.
Travelling through the parrot's old haunts one still finds the man
who knows somebody who once saw it, but, somehow, that actual
observer himself is never met.</p>

<p>Extinction has possibly claimed Tnokkapaltara. That other, one
time extremely rare, parrot, the Princess Alexandra, has been
luckier. Discovered by Waterhouse when with the McDouall Stuart
Expedition in 1863, it disappeared completely until Keartland,
ornithologist with the Horn Expedition, captured some specimens at
Glen Helen in the Macdonnell Ranges in 1894. Gould named this
slender, long-tailed, soft-coloured creature <i>Polytelis
alexandrae;</i> the natives knew it as Inilturung. Not until 1905
was it again recorded, this time as far south as Oodnadatta. By
that time the feeling was strong that it too had vanished for ever,
but it is now being bred in captivity, so should be safe for
posterity. It was one of my most pleasant experiences when I
entered the aviary at Tieyon, a station on the "back track" to
Alice Springs, and two Princess Alexandras flew to me, one resting
on my shoulder and gently nibbling an ear, the other perching on my
wrist to eat a nut from my fingers.</p>

<p>Twenty pounds sterling had been offered (unavailingly) for that
delightful pair. Taken as babies from the nest they had been reared
without difficulty on wheat made fine by passing through a
mincer&mdash;"the easiest of all the parrots to rear," said the
proud owner, Mrs Smith.</p>

<p>In the same cage were five Bourke Parrots, just as tame as the
Alexandras, so friendly indeed that they jostled one another for
footholds on my hat. The background held a row of those general
favourites, the Budgerigahs, forming a living (and loving) frieze,
and at my feet crawled a Mountain Devil <i>(Moloch horridus)</i>,
surely the most libellously named of all innocent creatures.</p>

<p>That happened to be a good season, so we were given opportunity
to see what recent rain could do to country which, on a previous
occasion, might well have been called desert. "Everything looking
wonderfully well," says my diary and, in parenthesis, follows the
entry: "Huge scorpion dived down hole on track this
afternoon"&mdash;an item of some interest to one who, like myself,
slept close to the ground each night. The flats before Erldunda
were a field of white everlastings, a gay mantle of parakelia
purpled the slopes, the crests of the sandhills were hidden beneath
a white-flowered shrub, and on the saddle, where the track crossed,
the beautiful blue of Brunonia shone against its background of red
sand.</p>

<p>It was on that trip, by the way, that I plotted to perform what
may strike the average reader as an act of prime impudence; I took
a couple of boomerangs with me to teach the natives how to throw
them! The intention was not, however, quite as rash as it sounds,
the point being that these were "return" boomerangs (weapons that
return to the thrower) and the Arunta people know only the hunting,
or war, boomerang, which is more in the nature of a bent throwing
stick and does not come back. I looked forward to some interesting
displays as the blacks grasped the idea, and particularly was I
curious to see how soon it would be before they improved upon my
own efforts. Unfortunately I damaged my back in a motor smash on
the outward journey and during the whole period of the excursion,
lasting some three months, I was unable to make a throw. In the
circumstances, as I could not demonstrate, I did not show the
weapons at all.</p>

<p>I hesitate, as a mere layman, to enter into the controversy
which for a time raged so fiercely about the famous "Jervois
skull," now reposing in the National Museum at Canberra; but some
notes I made when in the Jervois Range in 1933 may be of interest.
There I met Tom Hanlon, on whose station the skull was said to have
been found. Hanlon said:</p>

<p class="quote">O'Neil came here and asked if there were any
skulls about. I told him of this one lying in the paddock. I was
astounded to hear later that it was a million years old! There was
a white man's tomahawk and a bag with some red ochre alongside the
skull&mdash;they didn't have those a million years ago, surely! I
knew the gin whose skull it was: she has two strapping sons here
now, Archie and Jack. She was an undersized old woman of the
Bulltanga tribe. She went bush and died there.</p>

<p>This Jervois country will be familiar to all who have read
Plowman's fascinating books. On a very far-back station I have
heard <i>The Man from Oodnadatta</i> acclaimed as the truest work
on the Inland. It assuredly is one of the best. Many of the
characters of all Plowman's three books may still be met by the
traveller. In the west of Queensland, as we passed out of the
Territory and prepared to trace the long Birdsville track, we
encountered the hero of Hatfield's book <i>Ginger Murdoch.</i> He
was locally known as Red Murphy. I spent the evening listening to
his tales and wishing that it had been my luck to have met him
before Hatfield did. He was a treasure house of excellent
stories.</p>

<p>One of the drought problems for the missionaries at a place like
Hermannsburg is how to find employment for the able-bodied men who
have become attached to the Mission and make it their home. The
long-debated pipe-line to bring the constant water of the
Korporilya Springs to the station is now an accomplished fact and
gardening is giving occupation to a number, while the improvement
in the seasons has restored some of the old pursuits. But drought
will come again and once more unemployment must result unless the
Government takes a useful hand in the game. Tourists are now a
recognized source of national wealth in every country which can
attract them: let me revive here a suggestion, made by H. A.
Heinrich when I was at Hermannsburg in the 1929 drought. The work
would both assist tourist traffic and help the natives. The
estimated cost was 3000 and his idea was to construct a road,
passable for motor-cars, to embrace in a round tour most of the
best-known scenic features to the west of Alice Springs. Starting
from that township, the first place of call would be the
magnificent gorge known as Simpson's Gap (twelve miles), then
eighteen miles farther on would be visited the picturesque Jay
River (where the home for half-caste children used to be), with its
adjacent Standley Chasm. In turn would come Narrow (or Spencer) Gap
(10), Ellery Gap (10), the Glen Helen Gorge (30), Redbank Gorge,
only three feet wide (12), over the hills at Umbatcha Springs to
the Missionary Plain (20), Gosse Range (6), Gilbert Springs (15),
Lilchera Springs (12), Korporilya Springs (6), Hermannsburg (5),
Palm Valley (15), Glen of Palms (4), Boggy Hole (about half a mile
of good water&mdash;a spot to which the whole population of the
Finke River Mission Station went on one occasion for a week&mdash;a
"big fellow picnic"), and back to Hermannsburg via Todd's Glen
(17), Wallace rock carvings (30), and into Alice Springs (60). The
figures quoted are subject to revision; the total distance is
roughly 300 miles. Hermannsburg would provide a convenient camping
spot <i>en route.</i></p>

<p>A considerable part of the way is now possible for cars, but
that is not recommending it to the city driver! To see where motors
are taken in this land of few roads&mdash;roads, that is, within
the meaning of that word in the coastal States&mdash;is a liberal
education in the power of the internal combustion engine, the
durability of bodies and the resilience of springs. The truck is
the favoured official vehicle. If you chance to meet Wishart Smith
(an old boy of Scotch College, Melbourne, by the way), the Resident
Engineer of Alice Springs, you will probably find that his truck is
equipped with supplies of everything that might be
needed&mdash;food, petrol, water, tools&mdash;to meet possible
breakdown, all neatly packed in special containers. The precaution
is necessary; so extensive is his territory that an accident might
find him hundreds of miles from his base and a great many from the
nearest aid. The padres, too, of both the A.I.M., and the Methodist
Inland Mission, to name the only two religious organizations there
with which I am familiar, have their vehicles similarly provided.
Plowman has proved a capable historian of the earlier period of the
Presbyterian work; there is room for someone to continue the tale
now that the camel and packhorse stage has been passed. As for the
equally interesting Methodist movement, its history has apparently
either to be written as a new work altogether, or collected from
the journals in which its fragments have appeared. These
missionaries serve the white population of a parish which, in the
case on one of them at least, I know to be nearly 1400 miles from
north to south and 800 from east to west. They know no distinction
of creed or belief and, literally, they "serve." I have grateful
reason to remember that one of them can mend a lame motor, but
their skill, experience and willingness carry them far beyond
that.</p>

<p>Sitting with my good friend, the Rev. H. H. Griffiths, the
present Methodist padre at the Alice, I have heard him discourse on
many an unusual incident (unusual to town folk, that is) which he
regarded as the commonplaces of his life and, behind his back, I
have learnt much more, tales of a devotion to the cause of humanity
that compels admiration. Grim tales, some of them; but, when the
speaker was the padre himself or his wife, who accompanies him on
the long lonely journeys, the humorous predominated. Harry, a
native from the "top end," was the centre of many a good story.
Judging by the ambiguity of some of his pronouncements he could
have been a descendant of the Delphic Oracle. "What name that
fellow tree, Harry?" asked Mr Griffiths as he noticed a specimen
new to him. Harry stood up in the truck, fixed an intent regard on
the tree until it was lost to sight, then delivered judgment. "Him
might be whatyoucallem, I t'ink!" Harry, cured of the habit of
swearing, would not allow other black to indulge, at least not in
the presence of his master or mistress. Like most converts he
became a zealot. Passing a camp one day, far out in the wilderness,
a naked aboriginal was seen racing across to intercept the car.
Breathless, and evidently proud of his pace, the blackfellow
panted: "Me run like hell!" Instantly Harry was out of the truck.
Clapping his hand over the fellow's mouth, he poured at him a
fierce string of native talk. What he said was not followable by
the two white folk, but the result soon explained it. The stranger
first looked dazed and then reconstructed his first remark: "Me run
like anyt'ing!" he now said. It was this same Harry who
unconsciously fired a fine double-barrel on a certain occasion: in
a single remark he rebuked a fellow countryman and uncovered the
cause of the trouble. "You go wash your mout' wit' soap!" he
stormed at a swearer. "You talkem like white man!"</p>

<p>To officiate at a wedding the padre drove some 400 miles, the
bridesmaid came some 600 miles. All stayed at least two days. The
parson's first job was to cut the hair of the male
guests&mdash;nine of them had not had their hair trimmed for nearly
twelve months! "My hands were tired out," he laughed, as he
recalled the experience. "I took that hair off in lumps!" For the
wedding feast their hosts killed a bullock, two pigs and twelve
roosters.</p>

<p>Tragedy comes too often into their life. Mr and Mrs Griffiths
and another missionary were travelling to Darwin and had taken with
them a half-caste lad. They ran into rain and presently were
bogged. The car was jacked up and the boy crawled under to see the
cause of a certain trouble. Night had fallen. Mrs Griffiths was
holding the light of a torch on the lad when the jack collapsed
and, to her lasting horror, he was crushed to death before her
eyes. Then a miracle happened: the two men, unaided, lifted the car
off the body. Somehow they struggled out of the bog, reached a
station on the overland telegraph line and obtained permission to
bury the poor child. Moved beyond tears, those two clergymen,
accustomed though they were to such scenes, found it almost
impossible to officiate at the grave.</p>

<p>It was the artists' car which Mr Griffiths assisted us to cure
at Alice Springs. At the conclusion of the treatment I have a diary
entry which indicates that we were about to set forth again:
"Henrietta had breakfast with us this morning. We had poached eggs;
she had the white of an egg in her radiator to check leaking." A
stick-up just before reaching the Alice had not been altogether
Henrietta's fault. We ran out of petrol, thanks to the final
crossing of the Hugh River, which took us nearly a full day to
accomplish and ate up all our supplies. Eventually, when the car
stopped for want of "juice" a little south of the Macdonnell
Ranges, we thought we were about five miles from Heavitree Gap, so
only seven from Alice Springs. Gaily one of the artists set off
bearing two petrol tins. But his gaiety lessened as the distance
grew&mdash;we were really sixteen miles out. It was evening when he
reached the township. Carrying three gallons of petrol he started
the return journey, but the darkness was so great he kept straying
from the sandy track and at last, about midnight, he camped,
blackfellow fashion, with a fire on each side of him. Meanwhile we
kept watch for him till weariness took us and we lay down by the
fire and slept. About 2 a.m., my companion woke and looked towards
the gap. "Here he comes," he said, "someone has given him a lift."
Sure enough, there was the single headlight of a car showing in the
distance through the mulga. Casting off sleep we built up a
generous blaze, made a billy of tea, cut sandwiches, and generally
prepared the fatted calf to welcome the prodigal. But he did not
arrive till twelve hours later. The bright light was the planet
Venus rising!</p>

<p>During three lengthy trips those artists gathered experiences
grave and gay. They were painting, one day, when a passing bushman
offered criticism: "Yes," said he; "the picture's all right; but
y'oughter have that stump grubbed outer the front!" One of them is
a pretty capable player of the fiddle. His Waterloo came when he
was persuaded to entertain a group of natives. They wasted no
compliments&mdash;"plenty too much tomcat!" was the summing up as
they departed. Another of those blacks used a quaint method of
explaining that a fellow tribesman had no English: "Dis my friend.
He no hear you. Me speak for him."</p>

<p>In the permanent pool of the Finke at Henbury lurks a
debbil-debbil snake of immense proportions and outrageous habits.
He cannot brook disturbance and incontinently swallows the native
who chances to trouble the waters. I may count myself fortunate, I
suppose, that he allowed me to bathe there, as I did one lovely
winter morning when the air was tonic in its freshness. But,
formidable as this mythical creature is, he is nothing to the snake
old Preddie (Freddie) knew to be living over by Lake Eyre. "Ever
walkabout Lake Eyre, Freddie?" "No good, big pfella snake walkabout
there&mdash;beeg pfella snake&mdash;debbil-debbil
snake&mdash;shakem ground when he walkabout; no good!" "What name
that big pfella snake, Freddie? What white man call him?" Freddie
thought long and earnestly. Black snake? No. Carpet snake? No. Rock
snake? No. Python? No. He knew that fellow snake name but he "no
t'ink it now." Night fell, and just as the white man was in his
first sleep came a yell from Freddie. He had thought of the
name&mdash;"White pfella call him eart'quake!"</p>

<p>Elsewhere reference has been made to the intelligence of the
aboriginal. Frequently he is judged by his seeming failure to
understand questions, or to reply to them fully, but I found that
he usually grasped all the implications, though he chose to reply
to the obvious only. That practice, by the way, is often the result
of the white man's impatience at the native's daring to have
opinions as well as knowledge. It was certainly not stupidity which
prompted the answer in the story told me by a missionary from the
north-west. The two had reached the sea coast and the white man
proposed to bathe. "Any shark here, Jackie?" he asked. "No shark
here, boss," came the assurance. The bath was duly had, and, as he
dried, the boss inquired: "Why no shark here, Jackie?" "Too plurry
much crocodile, boss!" promptly returned Jackie. Or again, but this
is an illustration of combined shrewdness and wit, the tale told by
Dr Madigan in his excellent volume <i>Central Australia.</i> It
came to me in this form. "You ride that warrigal this morning,
Billy," ordered the manager of the station. Billy regarded the
horse, a noted buckjumper and outlaw, with strong disfavour. Then
he turned to his employer: "More better you ride him, boss.
Blackfellow gettin' mighty scarce!" An excellent illustration of
the natives' opinion of woman was afforded during a conversation on
quite other topics. A bird lighted on a tree near by and the
blackfellow picked up a stone and drove it away. It was a Willy
Wagtail. "Him alla same woman; too much yabber-yabber," he
explained. Then the white man remembered that the old fellows of
the tribe will never talk secrets if a woman or a wagtail is
about.</p>

<i>Residual Hills, and the Gibber Resulting from Their
Detrition</i>
</p>

<p>In an endeavour to reach Boggy Hole we once ventured our car
down the Ellery Creek by a route, I dare swear, that no other car
had ever taken or is likely to take until something in the nature
of a track is created. This was the roughest going met with on any
of my trips and I counsel car owners to avoid attempting it. Two
natives from the Finke Mission escorted us with a team of donkeys
and, after passing the remains of the old Henbury homestead, we
yoked four of the gallant little beasts to the front of the car. It
was a treat to see them from the driver's seat, seemingly dressed
in a new mouse-coloured costume, so neat that it suggested the
tailor-made. Along the back and down the tail ran a clear dark
line, and this line extended across the shoulders to form the
perfect figure of a cross. (That, so the legend tells, is the
distinction borne by the donkey ever since he carried Christ into
Jerusalem). Miles of stony creek bed alternated with patches of
sand and were broken by sharp rises and still steeper descents
while, in our advance, the great red wall of the gorge rose higher
and higher on each side. As she twisted and bounced over the
obstructions, the old car, viewed from the front, appeared to be
suffering from a combination of knock-knee, squint and St Vitus's
dance. At sixteen miles we camped&mdash;that sixteen miles had
taken four and a half hours!&mdash;and there we stayed, for not
even the redoubtable Henrietta, plus her auxiliaries, could advance
us past the next line of rocks. Some ten days later, this time with
six donkeys pulling, we essayed to return. Here is a sample of my
diary entries:</p>

<p class="journal">6th June 1934. Jack now attempting to crank up
the reluctant Henrietta. We should meet the donkeys somewhere up
the Gorge...stuck on first crossing (sand) for an hour just below
high red cliff. Two Wedgetail Eagles are working the cliff, flying
just below the skyline and close in to the rocks&mdash;possibly to
scare game into the open from the crannies and caves...One of the
eagles has gone aloft till he is now only a dark Cupid's bow near
the crescent moon, which is showing on the edge of some fleecy
cloud-lets...Henrietta has struck; unloaded car and prepared to
camp...Hooray! Jack has found a loose bolt jamming the works.
Proceeds to set the engine up again...Three Wedgetails are playing
circus overhead, following each other round and round in a small
air circle. I should say a pair and their young one&mdash;mother
seems to be playing tiggy with the boy. Circling higher now,
perhaps going up to look for grandfather who flew heavenwards when
we first came here...Nine donkeys and five natives
arrive...progress very slow...leak in radiator becomes
serious&mdash;attempted repairs with chewing gum (God bless
Wrigley!)...worst pinch of all just ahead&mdash;an almost vertical
rise of about ten feet and soft at that. The gorge resounds to the
shouts and shrill whistles of the abos. as they put the donkeys at
it&mdash;no, they are beaten and Jack is digging away the top of
the bank to ease the gradient...after many tries, gaining a little
each time, blocking the wheels, digging and pulling, we are on top
at last...the donkeys are yoked three in front, then two, then one
nearest the car. The centre one of the three leaders is much bigger
than his two mates; they lean in on him at every pull until they
must pretty well squeeze all his breath out, as well as rub his
hair off...One of our assistants has the largest mouth (short of
the late lamented Irving Sayles) I have seen on a human being. He
puts a finger in each corner, bares his beautiful teeth, and the
result is a whistle like the siren of a railway engine...Coming on
dark and still half a mile from old Henbury where we would like to
camp, though the water there is not good&mdash;"it 'tink" said our
abos. There is a good spring there, however,...could not reach
Henbury, so camped on the sand. Sent boys and donkeys home to
Hermannsburg. Dingoes howling as we retire.<br>
<br>
7th June. Thermometer shows two degrees of frost. No dew, so frost
not visible...9 a.m., the first fly...Henrietta braces herself for
her now unaided task and for the next three hours my job is laying
coco-nut matting and gathering it up again, while the other two
alternately dig and drive.</p>

<p>Here are the notes I made of our progress during the first hour.
The sand was very heavy: digging and laying of matting occurred
between each two gains:</p>

<p class="journal">Gained ten yards; ten feet; twenty feet; ten
yards; ten feet; five yards; five yards; two yards; three yards;
ten yards; six yards; and so on. Out of the worst of it by twelve
noon and on to plain with James Range on left and the blue
Macdonnells at right...Hermannsburg, after several stoppages, at 3
p.m. So we have taken two days to do that return sixteen miles.</p>

<p>Hermannsburg, with its ever vocal population, seems a metropolis
after such an experience. With the hospitality that sits so easily
on these kind people, we were welcomed as old friends by white and
black alike. Only when one has lived hard in a thirsty land does he
realize the boon of the hot bath, the varied meal, the soft bed of
home life. Sunday saw us at church as part of a crowded gathering
of aborigines. The service was Lutheran and much like that of the
Church of England&mdash;the responses, the creed and the confession
would have dignified any congregation in the world, and the singing
was equally good to hear. We white folk sat on chairs next to the
group of young girls, the women all being on one side and the men
on the other. Everybody was spruced-up for the occasion. Ahbel
(Abel), in the midst of his class of little boys, had his white
hair carefully combed and parted in the middle; from the pocket of
his shirt projected a decorous corner of coloured handkerchief. On
the platform, with the Rev. Mr Petering, sat Blind Moser (Moses),
most eloquent of native preachers, and between them stood a table
as altar. It was covered with an attractive cloth and supported two
bowls of artificial flowers and four candles. Above all hung a
large picture of Christ crucified.</p>

<i>Glen Helen Gorge (Finke River)</i>
</p>

<p>Blind Moser, grizzled of hair and beard, his sign of initiation
as a savage (the gaps where his teeth had been knocked out) showing
as he led the singing, was just below a portrait of Luther, whose
round comfortable face seemed to regard the scene, as well it
might, with complacency. Moser took for text John i, 13-18,
stressing the need for practising, not merely protesting, brotherly
love, and very impressive his sermon sounded. He knew the
Scriptures thoroughly, for it was he who, in the late Mr Strehlow's
time, had assisted in their translation into Arunta. He is still
the authority in all such matters.</p>

<p>Always did we leave Hermannsburg with regret, but the Alice had
still one more novelty to show before the South called so
imperatively that it could not be disobeyed. A Jamaican negro, who
resented strongly a suggestion that he was an Australian native,
came to our camp peddling opals, and with him I went along the bed
of the Todd to meet an opal cutter, whom I had not expected to see
so far from the field. He sat in a bower hut with his bench and
tools in front of him, a pleasant-faced man of about sixty, who
spoke with a slightly foreign accent and said he had been cutting
since he was fourteen years of age. For years he was on the
sapphire fields of Queensland, when as much as 30 an ounce would
sometimes be paid for good sapphires, and there were thirteen
buyers' agents always in residence. Those fields are still going,
he added, but have lost their importance. He came to Alice Springs
for garnets, but the local stuff is poor and Madagascar now floods
the market with better and cheaper stones. The opal he was cutting
was from a find 160 miles west of Oodnadatta, and was said to be
the hardest opal in the world. I noticed an Australite near his
polishing wheel. He called it a "plainer" and mentioned that he cut
that class of stone for mourning jewellery&mdash;the blackest stuff
he knew. He scoffed at the idea that it was a meteorite.</p>

<p>And so the moving pictures pass before "that inward eye which is
the bliss of solitude," the actors speak again, and the life is
lived once more.</p>

<h2><a name="c11" id="c11"></a>CHAPTER XI &mdash; SOME NOTES FOR
THE TOURIST</h2>

<p>Every country has, of course, its characteristic nomenclature;
Australia is no exception. In trying-out possibly unacceptable
immigrants to our country, an exceedingly effective test would be
their ability to write, or even pronounce, some of our place names.
The persons who could manage an outback title like Tidnacoordinnina
without stumbling, or overcome Cadabirrawirracanna or
Meremendicowoke at a glance, might reasonably be regarded as even
more than good Australians, for few native Australians could safely
attempt such hurdles.</p>

<p>C. J. Dennis has written some clever rhymes about the titles of
bush settlements and Banjo Paterson has pretty well summed up the
matter in a racy poem which tells of a contest between certain
shearers. One of them, waiting his chance, remarks:</p>

<p class="poem">"You've heard of Mungrybambone and the Gundabluey
pine,<br>
Quobbotha, Girilambone, and Terramungamine,<br>
Quambone, Eunonyhareenyha, Wee Waa, and Buntijo&mdash;"<br>
But the rest of the shearers stopped him: "For the sake of your
jaw, go slow."</p>

<p>How few Australians would pass a full examination in things
Australian! City knowledge&mdash;yes!&mdash;but (to paraphrase
Kipling) what do they know of Australia who only the cities know!
To the majority of its citizens much of our continent has been what
it all was to the ancient cartographer who wrote, in a blank space
in his map of the world, the words, <i>Austrialia incognita.</i>
There has been some excuse for our ignorance in the past, with
distances so extravagant and the methods of travel so restricted
that only a lucky few could find time or means to "see Australia
first;" but, like Molire's doctor, we have changed all that.
Opportunity now knocks at every door. It is true that distances
remain the same, but they may be conquered by any one in a normal
holiday and one need no longer be a Croesus to finance the
trip.</p>

<p>So deep and broad a country necessarily means many climates and
a wide diversity of creatures, just as it suggests and compels a
great range of occupation amongst its inhabitants. Despite their
homogeneity there is a feeling that presently the varied methods of
living dictated by climate, and the very real differences in daily
experience between the southerner who knows snow and the northerner
bordering on the equator, will breed such noticeable changes in the
people that a citizen may be identified at once as hailing from one
end or the other of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Coming down from the far north by steamer, I met a lad of twelve
years, born and bred in Australia, who asked me what a rabbit was
like. Now every one is aware that the rabbit is not native here
but, seeing that it owns so much of Australia, I wondered to find
there was a country youngster who had not seen one. I told the tale
to a Melbourne boy. He was amused at the Queenslander's ignorance.
But when I mentioned that there were crocodiles in the creek on the
northern chap's property, the Melbournian eyed me with suspicion.
Crocodiles he classed with lions and elephants as wholly exotic.
Yet they are as truly Australian as the kangaroo.</p>

<p>Before the motor-car was known in the land, two ladies were
driving Tommy, their twenty year old hack, through the Pitchi
Pitchi Pass in the Flinders Range. The way was lonely, and at its
loneliest part they met a turbaned Afghan, tall and bearded, who
made as if to stop them. They were thoroughly scared. They shocked
their ancient steed into a gallop, almost ran over their assailant,
and not until they had covered a couple of miles did they relax the
best pace the old horse could give them. Then, just as they were
exclaiming with joy over their deliverance, they encountered what
the Afghan had been trying to prepare them for. Camels! A string
from the breeding place, Marree, some 400 miles north of Adelaide,
was travelling west, and here it came&mdash;a long line of ungainly
bodies and swaying necks, each with an ugly arrogant face at the
end of it.</p>

<p>The horse is notoriously afraid of the camel&mdash;that is why
an Afghan was always sent ahead to warn drivers that a herd was
coming. As this lot swept into view Tommy forgot his years and took
to the hills, incidentally crossing a wire fence and leaving the
jinker with the two ladies on the near side of it.</p>

<i>Mulga-ants' Nest</i>
</p>

<p>An Arab legend would have us believe that in the far-off days of
Creation the Horse was dissatisfied with his shape. He appealed to
Allah as the High Court and submitted an outline of what was really
required to meet his views&mdash;a longer neck, for instance, more
arch to his back, a swishier tail, and so on. Allah worked on the
specifications and called the Horse to view the result. It was the
Camel. One look was enough for the Horse: he ran for his life, and
his progeny runs to this day whenever they catch sight of Allah's
joke.</p>

<p>The history of the camel in Australia goes back as far as 1840,
when two were imported from Teneriffe. They landed at Port
Adelaide. Then in 1859 Sir Henry Barkly, Governor of Victoria from
1856 to 1863, was authorized to import some for the use of the
Burke and Wills Expedition. Twenty-four were brought from Peshawar
in India, some of them as baggage animals and some for riding. An
Afghan accompanied them. But 1866 saw the real beginning of the
industry in this country: Sir Thomas Elder brought in one hundred.
A few of these died of mange, but the rest bred freely on Elder's
station, Beltana, South Australia. They were found useful in the
construction of the great overland telegraph line (Adelaide-Darwin)
in 1871 to 1873, and ever since they have been an almost essential
part of the Inland, although their value has shrunk appreciably
since the motor-truck has made the carriage of goods and produce so
much more expeditious.</p>

<p>The total number in Australia when they were most in use has
been given as from 12,000 to 15,000. It has been recorded that the
Arabian camel will carry a pack of three hundredweight, the
Egyptian up to four hundredweight, and the Australian-bred up to
six hundredweight, and that they will cover twenty-five miles a day
with these loads. During the Elder Scientific Expedition of 1891-2,
David Lindsay's riding camel travelled for twenty days on six
gallons of water!</p>

<p>Rare as the sight of a camel is in the coastal areas, their
plate-like footprints may be seen in many parts of the country and
the great beasts may be met far from civilization, for some are
running wild.</p>

<p>Endless miles of gibber, great level plains where the horizon is
unbroken the whole way round, dwarf the car that trespasses upon
them, until the motorist feels that he is of no importance at all.
The stones are of every colour and of every size. At times they are
no greater individually than buckshot and they range up to
fair-sized boulders, but the general effect, to the eye, is one of
evenness. Fascinating expanses they form, often with the mirage
making charming lakes about their edges, lakes whose bays,
promontories, islands and decorations of timber are realistic in
the extreme. If you are of the people who trust what they see, then
you are to be sadly deceived here. Strange, too, are the residuals,
lone peaks capped with tough desert-sandstone which has stood the
weathering of countless years, but is ever reluctantly yielding
fragments to form yet another gibber plain. Always reducing and
building up, fantastic in the extreme, they provide one of the
oddest landscapes in Australia, a fitting gateway to that
remarkable river of sand, the Finke.</p>

<p>An experienced traveller, after a long trip by car through the
Inland of Australia, pronounced the tracks, on the whole, good. But
what of the remainder? Well, they provide the something different!
A powerful car conquers easily enough the sandhills, the even
sandier river crossings, the stony flats, but the heavily-laden
caravan may linger long on some of those obstacles.</p>

<i>The Wilderness Blossoms</i>
</p>

<p>While the inland rivers are, as a rule, no more than sandy or
rocky depressions, they can be, on occasion, mighty torrents.
Cooper's Creek, when I saw it, was more like a sandpit than a
watercourse but we were assured by a station owner that he had seen
it a sheet of water thirty miles wide!</p>

<p>So dry are these stream beds that one of the jokes of the
bushman is to tell the new-chum that a line of dust seen in the
distance is caused by a shoal of fish swimming up the river!</p>

<p>Chasms! Is there a series anywhere in the world to equal that of
the Macdonnell Ranges! From that little town of Alice Springs,
lying snugly in its ring of hills, one may know a dozen great
water-cut gaps, any one of which would be sufficient to make a
reputation for its countryside. Nature has spilt them there with a
lavish hand&mdash;astonishing evidence of the hoary age of the
ever-changing hills which the creating rivers have helped to shape.
Heavitree Gap, so dose to the township that it has become a
commonplace to the inhabitants&mdash;yet how arresting between its
tumbling red walls; Attack Gap, looking down on Temple Bar Creek,
its stern sides ablaze in the live air; Simpson's Gap, narrowing
from lofty cliffs in a way that disguises its immense size; the
Glen Helen Gorge, which should be renamed the Finke Gorge for it is
that river's greatest achievement; Standley Chasm, only eighteen
feet wide for its first hundred yards, a straight cut through a
rocky range which rises nearly a thousand feet above it&mdash;but
their name is legion and each gap is distinct and like no
other.</p>

<p>The Inland of Australia is one of the few places where a bore is
not only tolerated but welcomed. Not the human bores, who
buttonhole you and tell you about themselves while you should be
telling them about yourself, but the bores which are holes in the
ground tapping supplies of that great essential&mdash;water. You
meet them in many places, notably about the western borders of
Queensland. Strange it is to come upon one gushing from an iron
pipe in an un-peopled wilderness, and refreshing to the eye is the
surrounding greenness after many miles of grey sand or the dullness
of mulga. Some are very deep&mdash;one at least goes down 5000
feet. If you want tea without trouble, camp by the bore, for the
water is at boiling heat when it reaches the surface. People who
use good bore water come to like its faint tang of the unknown;
they say rain water is insipid. Stock, too, take to it readily.
Inland legend holds the story of the horses which had been born
during a drought and had never known rain. They had been watered
all their lives at a bore. There came floods one night which
covered the bore and its troughs. Next morning the horses were seen
swimming out to the old spot to get a drink!</p>

<p>There are people who do not believe that story.</p>

<p>Many are the animal oddities in the heart of Australia. The
kangaroo and his like, strange early types, are common there as
elsewhere in the continent, but certain quaint forms of life are
peculiar to the vast interior. As I have recounted, frogs outlast
years of drought by filling their bodies with water and burrowing
deep before the pool they live in becomes completely dry; pond
creatures remain as dead for incredible periods to revive
miraculously with the first moisture; several species of birds,
including parrots, have caught the owl habit of flying after dark;
insects and reptiles, both innocent and harmful, abound in new
shapes. Conspicuous in the belts of eucalypts are the nests of a
big hairy caterpillar which never goes out alone but moves about as
one of a long line that looks alarmingly like a snake when you come
upon it undulating through the bush. The leader presumably knows
where he is going&mdash;the others trust him blindly. His immediate
follower has him by the tail, number three has number two similarly
held, and so on until number thirty or more waggles along at the
end like a rudder. I have broken the procession by pushing an
individual out of place. At once the rank was closed by the
detached portion accelerating. But when I arrested the rearmost
insect, the news was passed along, the wriggling ceased and all
waited for the kidnapped one to rejoin them. It suggested that all
guidance and direction were really from the rear&mdash;the rudder
determining the course, so to speak.</p>

<p>The nests, shiny brown bags of a tough parchment-like substance,
are loathsomely full of cast skins and a mass of excreta. The
natives believe that the contents cause blindness if they fall on
the face. On their looks I quite believe it. As many as a dozen
nests may be seen disfiguring one unfortunate tree, a real burden
when a single nest may be over two feet long.</p>

<p>The bushmen eye the ordered march of these processional
caterpillars with amusement and, as usual, have created some tall
tales about them. One said, in his dry way, unsmiling and
serious-seeming, that he turned the head of a procession round till
it joined on to the tail, so making a complete circle. Five days
later, when he passed again, that ring of caterpillars was still
going round and round on the same spot!</p>

<p>City folk are so accustomed to the postman's daily deliveries,
the whistle at the gate, the letter written in the evening received
next morning, that they learn with astonishment of places in their
own country to which His Majesty's mails do not run, or, if they
do, they arrive at long intervals on camel-back. Once a month, for
instance, a camel team leaves the railway line at Rumbelara to
follow the windings of the Finke River and Ellery Creek and so keep
certain outstations in touch with the civilized world. The mailman
takes five days to do the 160 outward miles, he spends a day at the
Hermannsburg Mission Station, his terminus, then he and his black
boy "Four O'Clock" (so called because of the angle at which he
customarily places his feet when standing about) start the return
journey, hooshtaing their camels down each night at a waterhole,
and sleeping none the less soundly because dingoes prowl and howl
round the camp.</p>

<p>Of the huge station properties on those wide spaces, it is
permissible to speak only in terms of square miles. No one goes
down to the gate to meet the postman there!</p>

<p>"In the high and far-off times," as Kipling would say, there
came to Australia a man and a dog. They are both here
to-day&mdash;the man still practising a stone-age culture which he
possibly brought with him, the dog still serving him, or running
free in packs, and known as the dingo. The antiquity of the
old-world civilizations is as nothing to the age of these
aborigines&mdash;meet them and you have stepped across the
centuries to a period so remote that it is lost in the mists that
hide the early history of the human race. Your ancestors stand
before you; at least a suggestion of what they were like and what
they did is pictured in the sayings and doings of these
primitives.</p>

<p>It is still possible, despite civilization's cancerous effect
upon the tribes, to see untouched aborigines. As recently as last
May a missionary from the Lutheran station at Hermannsburg
preached, in halting Pindupi, to a chief and his six wives, all as
naked as Adam before the Fall, near Haasts's Bluff in the western
Macdonnell Ranges. A tolerant and kindly folk, they listened
courteously and gave the white man of their best.</p>

<p>Modern man has forgotten how his forbears created fire. In the
Inland of this continent he may learn again. A stick twirled
rapidly for less than a minute, or a spear-thrower sawed, edge-on,
across a shield for less than half that time and behold! man's
greatest comfort is licking greedily at the dry wood on which it
feeds. They know many useful things, these ancient peoples, of
which we have lost all knowledge. We have advanced to better
methods in most cases, but it is questionable if all the practices
of the blackfellow were known to us, to be dropped as useless
luggage on our forward march. Was there ever a time in the dead and
gone centuries of our evolution when we possessed the faculty of
communicating with our fellow creatures at great distances without
even such an aid as wireless? The smoke signal of the native is an
obvious means, however little understood by us, but what of the
cases, vouched for by many Inlanders, in which there is no visible
manifestation at all!</p>

<p>A couple of days' march to the east of a certain station is a
north-south track used by two tribes. When one of these groups of
people is on a walkabout and arrives at the turnoff to the station,
the home blacks at once advise the whites of the impending visit,
that is, forty-eight hours ahead of the actual arrival of the
strangers. Not only that, but the particular tribe is named on each
occasion. "Missus bin finis," said a black woman employed in the
kitchen of a back-country home. The "missus" was her employer's
mother, then visiting just over 400 miles away. Careful note, it is
said, was made of the time of the lubra's statement. When word came
through, it was found that the "missus" had "finished" (died) the
morning of the announcement!</p>

<p>More credible, because readily observable and because so many
dwellers in the Inland are prepared to vouch for it, is the
statement that sign-language is a lingua franca in Australia, a
language understood by all the tribes. Whether that is literally
true or not I cannot say, but here is the testimony of a resident
of long standing: "I have had a native sitting in the back of my
truck and as we passed, without stopping, he has made signs to
other blacks who in return have signalled more news than in two
columns of a newspaper." The "boy" in the truck had come from
Darwin, the others were Arunta people. That boy could not speak
Arunta. His employer was in doubt one day about the track. A
passing Arunta was seen and after some hand-waving the boy said he
had learnt from the signs that they were to keep closer to the
range. It was the track all right.</p>

<p>Changing, ever changing, yet in the short life of Man seemingly
changeless, this great continent presents to the observer a museum
of oddities and contradictions, each more fascinating than the
other. The motor-car, that special product of the twentieth
century, halts by the crude fireside of the stone age; giant bones,
lying in what are now sandy wastes, testify to a bygone luxuriance
of vegetation which fed and sheltered huge beasts; dry areas,
remote from the coast, betray departed seas which once washed them;
strange creatures, living fossils they have been called, creatures
which have never grown up (in an evolutionary sense) hop, though
they have four legs, fly, though they are quadrupeds, lay eggs,
though they suckle their young, do, in short everything that is
unexpected; rivers know no moisture for long periods of years but
may be twenty miles wide of racing water; and, finally, the white
settler, leasing an area as large as a European State and so remote
from civilization that his mails would reach him earlier if he
lived in England&mdash;that man may yet be in close touch with his
fellows, because the latest thing in radio has been devised
specially for him and by its use he may converse with the outer
world, and command, almost as handily as a city dweller may call a
medical man, the services of a flying doctor whose sole job it is
to look after him.</p>

<h2><a name="c12" id="c12"></a>CHAPTER XII &mdash; WHAT OF THE
FUTURE?</h2>

<p>Before I touch on the problem of the aboriginal, let me consider
what the white man has to look forward to. He is a bold man who
would utter prophecies about the future of that great region which,
disregarding political boundaries, is commonly referred to as
Central Australia or the Inland.</p>

<p>In this chapter I shall concern myself not so much with
conclusions as with certain facts gathered at first hand.</p>

<p>Any views at all, particularly those of a visitor, must
inevitably be challenged when one finds that there is no complete
agreement amongst the inhabitants themselves. As everywhere else,
local opinion is swayed by the occupations of the speakers or by
their other personal interests. One pessimist said the only
industries worth anything in such a country were "dogging and
birding," by which he meant killing dingoes for their scalps and
catching birds, mainly parrots such as the delicate-toned Bourkes
and the rare Princess Alexandra, for the southern markets.</p>

<p>On the other hand I met recently a landowner who, far back as he
is from the fortnightly train, is outraging the cattle sense of his
neighbours by successfully running sheep. He had luck, they say,
for the rain came at just the right time to certain parts of his
big property (all property is big here, judged by southern
standards), but he has deserved his luck because of his courage and
enterprise. When I last saw him he was bidding for another good
year by increasing his flock; if his foresight is rewarded he will
be in a position to face many bad seasons. Of course his sheep must
be shepherded because of the wild dogs, but native labour is cheap
and reliable, and he is prepared to pay, and is paying, for the
advance he is making in prosperity.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="pic29" id="pic29"></a><img alt="" src=
"1403041h-images/WideHorizons29.jpg"><br>
<br>
<i>Feed Aplenty</i>
</p>

<p>His next-door neighbour (a very close neighbour as things go in
that part, for he is only ten miles away) is also tackling sheep,
and is likewise finding the experiment good. He is so far out that
no mailman comes near him; when he wants news he must run the truck
something over one hundred miles to the nearest siding, 100 miles
of stony creek beds and soft sandhills. Sometimes his papers and
letters have been three months old when he has received them.</p>

<p>A stranger came his way once. There was a lively dust-storm in
progress. The visitor waited for the worst to blow past, looked at
the moving landscape, then gazed reflectively at the settler. "You
know," he said in tones of the most earnest conviction, "you're
mad!"</p>

<p>But he is far from being mad. He is an enthusiast, he knows the
land thoroughly, he likes his job and he is, in his own phrase,
making a do of it. His one complaint is that a far-away
administration, which knows little of the very real difficulties
and dangers of this remote life, charges him&mdash;an opener-up of
new country&mdash;the same rate as is charged those nearer
settlement, and charges it while the whole enterprise is in the
exploratory stage, and before water has been located. He did not
object to having to find the fluid without which no settlement
could be, or to sinking his own wells and tanks, but he thought,
and with considerable show of reason, that the Government should
encourage such enterprise as his, so materially helpful to the
State, by remission of charges for the first few years, or at least
until water had been discovered.</p>

<p>I have said that large stations are the commonplace. They must
be large; there may be many waste miles in a run. The unit in the
south is the acre; in the Centre it is the square mile. Reducing
one of these runs to southern terms gives it nine and a quarter
million acres. Cattle are, of course, the mainstay, and they need
room. A small station (it was only some 1500 square miles) lost
practically all its stock in a lengthy drought. Trouble did not
cease with the coming of the rain; the herbage grew, grew in the
wonderful way it does in the Inland, but there were no cattle to
eat it, and years had to pass before the stock could be adequately
renewed. On the other hand, I have been assured by an owner that in
nine years (1922-31) he had a total rainfall of only eleven inches
on his property, yet he sold fat cattle every year. He could do
excellently, he said, on three inches a year.</p>

<p>Stock-raising would seem to be the lasting industry, but it must
always vary in value with the seasons. The range of those values is
all-embracing: it includes prosperity, in a series of good seasons,
and absolute ruin, in a run of bad ones. But cattle, horses,
camels, donkeys, sheep and goats are not regarded by all as the
wealth of the country. A great portion of the Inland is known to
carry minerals of value and never perhaps have there been so many
men out prospecting as at the present day. The extremely high price
of gold is an incentive Australia-wide, and the story about the
unfortunate Lasseter's "reef" or "cave" has made gold-seeking in
the Centre more than ever popular.</p>

<p>The more obvious of the minerals are opal (several huge fields
have been proved about the borders of the Northern Territory), mica
(the basis of a considerable industry), wolfram, tin and gold.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, Alice Springs is somewhat excitedly
regarding Tennant Creek as a possible Coolgardie. Although 300
miles away, the Alice is the nearest township to this new goldfield
and, if only commercially, as the most accessible source of
supplies, it is naturally greatly interested. The rush to The
Granites, two years ago, was a tragedy; but expert opinion in Alice
Springs (the centre for that place too) declared that The Granites
would yet pay its way and that one mine at least was doing well
there. About Tennant Creek there appears to be less doubt.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the future of the Central Inland is summed
up in one word&mdash;water! A steady supply of water is the great
need. With it, much is possible; without it I venture to think the
country as it stands has reached saturation point of population.
(Yes, that sounds like a contradiction in terms, but let it go!)
Many before me have stressed this need, and many have suggested a
probable remedy in continuous boring to reach the underground
reserves of water. Alice Springs gets good water by shallow
sinking; in western Queensland bores 5000 feet deep spill endless
millions of gallons of water, making possible the passage of cattle
over otherwise parched areas.</p>

<p>A great river bed like that of the Finke, usually a sandy
depression, and no more, in practically the whole of its thousand
miles, brings down enormous floods from time to time. Can that
water, now not used, be conserved? I put the question to the then
head of our State Rivers and Water Supply, and he not only said
"Yes," but indicated how the big problem of evaporation could be
overcome.</p>

<p>But, suppose that dams were thrown across some of those narrow
gorges cut by streams through the Macdonnell Ranges, and reservoirs
were established&mdash;what follows? The answer is that the soil
will grow most things&mdash;witness the gardens in Alice
Springs&mdash;and here is the only requirement needed to stimulate
that soil into activity.</p>

<p>Yes, but what are you going to do with the produce? The local
population is small, other markets are so distant that transport
costs would eat up all profit. There is only one reply&mdash;bring
the population to the goods if you cannot get the goods to the
population. Is that absurd? Not at all! All that is required is an
important goldfield, a Kalgoorlie or a silver-lead field like
Broken Hill. Both those places were in impossible wildernesses;
look at them now! The Tennant Creek goldfield or the Jervois Range
mineral deposits may yet prove the value of this theory.</p>

<p>Summarized it comes to this: a rich mining field produces not
only the money necessary for water conservation and public work
generally, but provides the population to make agriculture, cattle
breeding, sheep rearing, and all other primary industries payable
concerns.</p>

<p>Until that elusive field is discovered, my feeling is that
Central Australia, with its periodical plunges into arid
conditions, can progress only very slowly indeed. Immense areas
must be reserved for the cattle-stations, and for the fewer sheep
holdings, and these cannot be settled more closely. Yet without
more settlers little advance can be expected.</p>

<p>I have not brought the aborigines into this matter. If
settlement increases they will, unfortunately, be pushed aside as a
matter of course. If the whole area were deserted by the whites the
tribes are so shattered in most localities that their recovery, as
tribes, seems impossible.</p>

<p>One thing remains&mdash;the tourist. He is of immense value to
other countries, and his money is even now an appreciable item in
the far Inland. But our Centre cannot be a Switzerland or a New
Zealand until conditions of travel there are more to the liking of
the type of traveller one commonly finds, constantly seeking the
show places of nature, but expecting to view them under luxurious
conditions.</p>

<p>Yet the charm is there, in that vast lonely Inland, a real charm
which holds you for all time when once it catches you. The wide
gibber plains give an unequalled sense of freedom, the fauna and
the flora are unique (in the true sense of that abused word), and
the mountains! See from the flat at the Alice the sun strike the
Macdonnells as it rises on a clear winter morning and you will see
a sight to stay with you for ever. I know nothing finer.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c13" id="c13"></a>CHAPTER XIII &mdash;
HERMANNSBURG</h2>

<p>Professor S. D. Porteus, who occupies the chair of Clinical
Psychology in the University of Hawaii, came to Australia at the
instance of the Australian National Research Council, to test the
intelligence of the blackfellows, and to take physical measurements
of this dying people. That, as I have said, was in 1929. He it was
who led the small expedition of which I was a member, and he it was
who applied the mental tests, while to my lot fell the task of
ascertaining and recording each man's height, chest capacity,
strength of arm, leg and back, and many another necessary detail.
This work was to throw us into such intimate association with the
Arunta tribe, a tribe made world-famous by Strehlow, Baldwin
Spencer, Gillen, Basedow, and others, that we were able to make
some very interesting observations.</p>

<p>Our headquarters we fixed at Hermannsburg, where the Lutheran
missionaries rule and where we found not only hospitality but
abundant material for our researches. It is about ninety miles west
of Alice Springs, the terminus of the north-south railway line
built by the Australian Commonwealth. Camel trains plod in and out
to carry supplies to Hermannsburg, and to cattle-stations even
farther out, but the camels take three days to travel the ninety
miles. A motor-truck reduced the time to six or seven hours.</p>

<p>The train to the Alice ran once a fortnight. A notice board had
caught the eye at one remote spot where a dusty track showed that
sometimes vehicles crossed the line at this point. All around lay
unpeopled desolation. The notice read: "Beware of Trains!"</p>

<p>A fierce wind had raged a few days before our visit, and its
effects were still visible. It had carried the desert sand, sand as
fine as any in an hour-glass, as far as the coastal towns where it
had fallen as "red rain," charging the Spring showers with a
pigment which marked the streets and the dwellings as with stains
of blood. Soft and almost in-palpable as this sand was, it stopped
our train twenty-six times in one stretch of ten miles. Each time a
gang of men, travelling ahead for the purpose, had to dig the line
out to let us through.</p>

<p>Alice Springs was reached on the third day. We came to it by way
of one of the amazing gaps cut by Nature through the Macdonnell
Ranges. These mountains, as I have said, extend east and west for
some 300 miles across the centre of Australia and they are pierced
at irregular intervals by deep ravines, really river beds, which
provide the only means by which north and south traffic may pass
through such a mighty barrier. The ravines, or gaps, may be no more
than a few yards wide; their walls may tower up seven or eight
hundred feet. The rivers which have made them are usually destitute
of water, but floods course down from time to time and turn them
into formidable streams, often miles across.</p>

<p>Ours was the second passenger train to reach Alice Springs, so
the people turned out, almost <i>en masse,</i> to welcome it. The
population then might be 200; the shops and houses formed a long
straggling main street, in the sand of which still stood some fine
eucalyptus-trees. Deep indeed must the roots go to derive
sustenance from such soil in such a season. A cool hotel, some
official residences with deep verandas, an hostel maintained
beautifully by the Australian Inland Mission, a few stores, a tiny
school&mdash;and one had seen Alice Springs.</p>

<p>Some half-castes and a few natives living in diminutive humpies
on the far side of the Todd River were all the aborigines visible
in the settlement. We chartered a motortruck, loaded it with our
measuring and testing apparatus and set out along the Macdonnell
Ranges westward. We travelled most of the day; through Heavitree
Gap, across plains covered with dusty mulga and desert oak and some
Hakea, or over low hills rough with spinifex and porcupine grass,
now rushing across stony river beds with never a drop of water in
them, always with the mountains, now close, now distant, towering
up on either side. Then from a sandhill we saw the Krichauff Range,
standing a purple bar across the sunset, and in the middle distance
the cement houses of Hermannsburg.</p>

<p>The Germans of this outpost in the wilderness have toiled long
and faithfully as missionaries to convert the native people to
Christianity. I shall not question the results; I shall only bear
witness to the earnestness of the endeavour. Here it was that the
missionary Strehlow laboured for so many years and from here he
supplied the material of his monumental book on the Australian
aboriginal.</p>

<p>He compiled, too, certain word-books of the Arunta, Dieri,
Luritja and other native languages. It is a pity that these are
still unpublished manuscripts, for the tribes are going or have
gone, and their languages have gone with them. Strehlow's writings
were in German; here is an opportunity for a learned society in the
Fatherland, or elsewhere, to publish, and so place in permanent
form, some unusually interesting work of scientific value.</p>

<p>About 300 men, women and children, mostly members of the famous
Arunta tribe, were listed in the books of the mission, and a number
of these was always available for testing. So for three weeks we
worked every day and eventually put together a valuable set of
records which Professor Porteus has since worked out in Hawaii and
published in his <i>Psychology of a Primitive People.</i> Very
friendly was the general attitude towards us and we were gratified
when after a short period of close association we were told that we
had been admitted as members of the tribe.</p>

<p>This can best be described as a kind of honorary membership;
mercifully it called for no participation in the customary
initiation rites, embracing as they do the knocking out of a front
tooth, the ceremony of circumcision and the still more painful
practice of sub-incision.</p>

<i>A Dwelling at Hermannsburg</i>
</p>

<p>Nevertheless we were members, and it was soon apparent that
every one knew exactly his or her relationship to us. Tribal
kinship goes further than the white man's limited relationship by
marriage or by blood. We found we had numerous brothers and sisters
and even, absurd as it may seem, a number of (for want of a better
name) fathers and mothers apiece. A little girl, Angeluka, was
brought to me and introduced as one of my mothers. She was possibly
nine years old. Eight others were later to claim similar
relationship.</p>

<p>There were nearly a hundred children at the mission, bright-eyed
smiling youngsters with whom we were soon very much at home. In the
daytime they were our companions as often as we could have them; in
the evenings they invariably sang to us. This is what used to
happen on those spring nights. I wrote it at the time:</p>

<div style=
"font-family: Georgia; font-size:1em; margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%">
<p class="poem">Jinga arbalama<br>
Larberinja nuka<br>
I mankilna kuta<br>
Jinga ilbaukama<br>
Ara ntjara indora<br>
Imka kat mugala<br>
Lata bula ta itja<br>
Ninteula juntama.</p>

<p>The soft desert darkness is all about us, the little fires of
the children are lighted, they sit in circles round them singing.
<i>"Jinga arbalama..."</i> what is this haunting new-old song? I
feel like Wordsworth regarding his solitary reaper:</p>

<p class="poem">Will no one tell me what she sings?&mdash;<br>
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow<br>
For old, unhappy, far-off things,<br>
And battles long ago.</p>

<p>Yet the language should not, maybe, sound foreign to Australian
ears. It is pure Australian. The singers are the youngsters of two
native tribes, the place is almost the exact centre of our huge
continent, and the tongue is Arunta, made world-famous by many
scientists. The voices rise shriller than the cicada chorus of a
still day in summer and with much of the vibrant quality that is in
the high-pitched strains of those fairy fiddlers. But what is the
air?&mdash;the words may be Arunta and strange, but the tune is
familiar. Ah, I know; it is the ancient German <i>Lorelei,</i>
transported to these wild surroundings, and words given to it to
voice the feelings of a people who are doomed. They see their land
taken from them, they see their native animals passing down a road
on which their feet too are set, and a teacher, with rare poetic
insight, has put into their mouths this version of the old-world
song...<i>Jimga arbalama...</i> They are saying: "I do not know the
name of my sadness. I often think of the olden days when plenty
kangaroos sat on the hills. To-day I cannot find a single one."</p>

<p>Sad it is, but they are not deeply affected, these happy
children of a naturally smiling race. <i>"Mara imdora!"</i> (very
good) we cry, and with flashing white teeth, as yet unspoiled by
the Arunta practice of knocking out an incisor, and with the
merriest laughing eyes, they echo, even more shrilly than they
sang, <i>"Mara indora!"</i></p>

<p>Just as they have no form of salutation, so they appear to have
no folk songs truly their own. The corroboree chants, at once
monotonous and gripping, are not for these infants. Their world of
music is a European one and they have adapted themselves to it
wonderfully. Sometimes, too, they sing the English words. "Three
blind mice!" announces the superintendent, and they are off, at a
pitch I have never heard approached by any other human beings, in
the repetitions of the adventures the farmer's wife had with the
afflicted rodents.</p>

<p>It is hard to say which soars highest towards heaven, the boys'
voices or the girls'. We chance it: <i>"Warra mara yielima!"</i> we
proclaim in our best Arunta. There is a shriek of delight from all,
but mainly from the boys, for what we have said is: "The boys sing
nicely!" An excited yabber is followed by an unintelligible request
from two of the older girls who have stolen up close, emboldened by
the darkness. We guess its import. "Three blind mice, three blind
mice," we chant and they are in full cry once more. This time we
again applaud with vigorous <i>"Mara indora,"</i> then,
diplomatically, <i>"Quarra mara yielima,"</i> signifying that it is
the girls now who have excelled. Tumult greets this, laughter
predominating.</p>

<p>A young moon hangs in the west, paled by the amber glow that
lingers from the sun. Above is the great arch dwarfing us all to
insignificance. The little fires die down and the little people
creep towards us, less shy in the night than in the light of day.
They come closer and closer till we are standing in a stirring pool
of dark forms. "Quiet!" commands the superintendent. They have been
served with fresh clothes to-day. "Are you all still clean and
tidy?" he asks. "<i>Aua!</i>" they chorus, all safely agreeing to
that in the dark. Then, for he is also schoolmaster, he attempts to
display their mental paces. "What does 'untidy' mean?" he inquires,
with strong emphasis on the "un." The bright boy, as much in
evidence here as in any white school, knows and answers promptly.
"Breakem trouser!" says he.</p>

<p>But they're off again. Someone has hummed "Abide With Me" and to
hint at a known air is to start the whole pack. What vigour they
put into it; still the rendering is not without a certain light and
shade. Withal it is musical.</p>

<p>We find that they are always wanting new songs. So we rack our
memories for fairly simple examples and presently they are
following us in the Hawaiian <i>"Mokehana Lei."</i> It is
astonishing how quickly they learn both the music and the words.
Before the session is over they are giving a colourful imitation of
our rendering, and next day, wherever a few of the younger natives
gather together, we will hear solos develop into choruses:</p>

<p class="poem">Mokehana Lei with its sweetness<br>
Bringing happy memories of Kauai,<br>
There are all the valleys,<br>
There are all the palis,<br>
Mokehanai that I love!</p>

<p>One cannot help wondering what will be the speculations of the
first visitor from Honolulu to encounter the song in these
surroundings.</p>

<p>More popular still is "Old Macdonald had a farm," which they
find humorous to a degree. They delight particularly in the
turkeys&mdash;"With a gobble gobble here, and a gobble gobble
there, here a gobble, there a gobble, everywhere a gobble-gobble"
and while still in the learning stage they keep on asking for "Mo'
tuckey." An additional gobble thrown in never fails to convulse
them with laughter. We teach them also "Good Night Ladies" which
they sing with fine effect.</p>

<p>Soft little hands are touching us by this time, timidly at
first, then more boldly as they feel no repulse. A few wild
children are amongst the others to-night, Luritjas from the naked
tribe newly camped on the Finke River below the station, and they
hold aloof; but it seems as if all the rest, every single one of
the eighty odd, have attached themselves to our hands or our
clothing. I did not know that an ordinary number eight hand could
be so expansive&mdash;I must have at least half a dozen tiny grubby
paws in each of mine. There is something attractive in every young
creature, and these helpless babes of the Stone Age, thrust as they
have been without any preparation into a world in which they have
no place, make a special appeal...How close are tears and smiles!
Sentiment is strong within me as I stoop towards the dark heads.
One small fellow of about nine years lifts his face with a
brilliant smile to meet me. "Me you fader!" he says. I laugh, but
he is right: we two white men were made members of the Arunta
nation a few days before. He is one of my several fathers. As we
have each a number of mothers-in-law (who, by the merciful laws of
our people, may never speak to us!) it follows that we have many
wives. Personally I have recorded the names of nine belonga me.
"How many wives this pfella?" I ask, anxious to learn my full
responsibilities. A blackfellow readily counts up to ten by means
of his hands; anything over that is "mob." "Oh, mob wife!" is the
cheery response, the stress on "mob."</p>

<p>They don't know how comical their next selection sounds to our
ears. It is Harry Lauder's "Roamin' in the Gloamin'," learnt from a
gramophone record and reproduced with ludicrous imitation of the
broad Scotch. In swift succession come "The Song of Australia"
(their birthright song, if they only knew it!) and two war memories
(though not for them) in "A Long Long Trail A-winding" and
"Tipperary."</p>

<p>I flash my torch to see the effect. They are too much accustomed
to fire to be impressed save by the ease of the lighting. "Blow!" I
say, in an incautious moment, and set the example, switching off
the light as I do so. Wild excitement follows. All must blow it out
in turn and the circle of light reveals each time an eager young
face, dark brown rather than black, surmounted by hair of the tone
of ebony and relieved by a pair of the brightest of bright eyes and
a set of the whitest of white teeth. How quick they are to smile,
how readily they laugh! I feel a great liking for these, my own
people of another colour and another Age.</p>

<p><i>"Kalla!"</i> (enough) calls the teacher. It is bed-time. The
little fires are dead, the moon is low, though the night is yet
young. Everybody is vocal at once; a babel of rapid talk mingles
with snatches of song. The song has it and all are united again in
one melody. But what is it? This is something new, even to the
teacher. The leaders are obviously two girls of about fifteen. We
ask for it again and find it a song composed, words and music, by
this pair of young people partly in our honour and partly in that
of an Adelaide University party which had visited the station some
months before and had done some fine medical work. The individual
to be honoured is named in the last words of the verse. As
Professor Porteus and I are present it is his or my name to-night,
coupled with a reference to our projected departure from the
station:</p>

<p class="poem">Jakkai, jakkai, angai<br>
Erareramanga,<br>
Lena atua tjulkaraka,<br>
Reka ekara Mister Croll</p>

<p>is what they sing, meaning that they are sorry to thgink that
the white man has gone from them whose name is Mister Croll (or
Professor Porteus if it were his turn).</p>

<p>"A last song," says the teacher, <i>"Era relia</i>..." and with
the vim that is too generally absent from more civilized gatherings
they burst into:</p>

<p class="poem">Era relia mara indora,<br>
Era relia mara indora,<br>
Era relia mara indora,<br>
Nuna allmelama.</p>

<p>In other words "For he's a jolly good fellow, and so say all of
us!" For the "Hip Hurrah" they substitute <i>"Jakkai! Ndurbai!"</i>
which being freely translated, says, "Yes! He certainly is!"</p>

<p>To a medley of "Good Night Ladies" and <i>"Mokehama Lei"</i> the
girls move off to their quarters. The boys turn towards theirs,
some fifty paces away. We find ourselves each with an escort of
closely clinging forms, much as a queen bee centres a swarm. From
one of those unable to secure attachment comes a burst of familiar
song. His accent is quaint but the air is unmistakable.</p>

<p>"Mara, Mara, quite contrara," he sings, and "How does your
garden grow?" I break in. It is delightful to hear them finish the
old nursery rhyme.</p>

<p>They pass into their long cement house bearing armfuls of wood
and many lighted sticks, for they must have a fire these cool
nights. "Goood night, goood night, goood night" comes from them
all; then, as the door is shut, a final call, in a voice so young
as to be almost babyish, reaches our ears: "Goood night, Mister
Croll, my son."</p>

<p>It is one of my youthful fathers bestowing his blessing in all
seriousness upon his very much older tribal offspring.</p>
</div>

<p>"Bush tucker" could hardly be called plentiful about
Hermannsburg; there was too great a congestion of natives for many
food creatures or much edible vegetation to remain in the
neighbourhood. I wanted honey-ants, and I thought, till I saw them,
that I wanted to taste witchetty grubs. No ants were available on
any of my visits; the grubs, the living ones anyway, I could not
manage.</p>

<p>My young friend Urabulla had something in his hand. He held it
out. "You eatem witchetty grub?" he asked. His dark pleasant face
was serious; but there was a hint of humour in the bright brown
eyes, and the hint grew to a definite sparkle of pleasure as I
examined his offering. It was a wood-grub about four inches long
and as thick as my finger, resembling a very faintly animated piece
of suet. In Scotland it might have passed as the young of an
anaemic haggis. A slight wriggle, as I took it, assured me that it
was alive. Urabulla regarded it as a white child would look upon a
stick of chocolate. He was evidently "treating" his friend.</p>

<p>"You eatem?" he asked again, and I remembered that I had asked
for this, that I had said I should like to taste more of the native
food&mdash;indeed had specifically named the witchetty grub. The
thing wriggled again. Urabulla looked expectant; I think his mouth
watered...No, I couldn't face it. "Urabulla," I said, "no eatem
now; plenty dinner; no more."</p>

<p>A native youngster will masticate the grub <i>au naturel</i>,
with the gusto of a white child chewing a lump of toffee. Urabulla,
however, lit a small fire, browned his sample nicely, and in that
way made an excellent <i>hors-d'oeuvre.</i></p>

<p>I was reminded of this, and of happy days spent in Central
Australia, by the arrival yesterday of a box of
honeyants&mdash;another aboriginal delicacy. As an article of diet
they do not offend white man's ideas quite so much as the grubs do,
but all the same some courage is needed to tackle them. A live ant,
whose head you grasp between finger and thumb in order that you may
bite off its swollen body, cannot be regarded as attractive. This
consignment, however, sent by Rex Battarbee, the artist whose work
has done so much to make the Inland known, is not intended to serve
as a meal. Several of the insects are alive, and these favoured
specimens of <i>Camponotus inflatus</i> are now enjoying a
luxurious existence at the Melbourne University, while those that
have died have been added to several entomological collections.</p>

<p>Tillyard is responsible for the statement that the genus is
represented in Australia by something like a hundred species, but
apparently only a few of these have the honey-pot habit. That habit
is surely among the most extraordinary of Nature's many queer
provisions. <i>Inflatus</i> is in appearance just an ordinary ant,
a creature somewhat smaller than our common red sugar-ant, and
there is nothing about the worker, following his lawful occasions
in the mulga, to suggest his unusual method of storing the honey he
is gathering. He has apparently found it beyond the ability of his
people to build suitable storehouses, as the bees do of wax, in
which to keep safely such chancy stuff as honey, so he has invented
a living storehouse&mdash;the body of a fellow ant.</p>

<p>How the choice is made of the fortunate, or unfortunate,
creature which is to spend the rest of its days inert, a mere
helpless bag of sweetness, is not known. Seemingly any ordinary
member of the community is eligible. Once selected, the workers
bring to it their daily gains of nectar from the exudation of
insects, from the flowering mulga or other plants, or from wherever
it is they find their supply. John Shaw Neilson wrote of the
bees:</p>

<p class="poem">All their day's love is sunken<br>
Safe in the comb&mdash;</p>

<p>The poet who would sing these other wonder-workers must find a
rhyme for "abdomen," for that is where the "day's love" of the
honey-ant is sunken. The "honey-pots" swallow the nectar brought to
them, but keep it for the general use of the colony. They have two
stomachs&mdash;the one private, the other communal.</p>

<p>I have a series of the ants before me as I write. The larva is a
flabby, wrinkled, cream-coloured object, with but little definition
of head; the adult worker is black, save for bands of brown across
the back of the abdomen. The various stages of inflation are well
illustrated in the next nine specimens. As the body swells, the
brown bars (really a thin membrane) stretch until they present the
appearance of a shiny deep-toned cherry, a cherry reinforced with
dark bands of chitin, that horny substance which helps to form the
overcoats of invertebrates. As the head and thorax remain
unaltered, the animal looks ludicrously disproportioned.</p>

<i>Yarumpa the Honey-ant</i>
</p>

<p>Baldwin Spencer says that honey-ants similarly modified occur in
certain parts of America, and suggests that the modifications may
be connected with the fact that all these ants, including our
Australian species, are found in dry, arid country.</p>

<p>When a member of the ant community requires nourishment, it
caresses the honey-pot with its antennae, and the living pantry,
this sentient storehouse, passes out from its mouth a drop of the
desired food. One speculates upon how much of the precious
substance the trusted guardian is permitted, or permits itself, to
absorb for its own nutrition.</p>

<p>The aborigines are fond of the <i>Yarumpa,</i> as the Arunta
tribe call this black honey-ant, and gather it, whenever they can,
in great numbers. There is no mound on the surface to indicate
where a nest is located; a small hole leads vertically to the
passages and chambers in which the home life is led. Mr Battarbee,
writing from Hermannsburg, records that these present ants were
down in the earth about three feet and that the living honey-pots
were stowed away in rows, the big, full dark ones being at the
bottom in far corners, while the eggs were near the top. He added
that the natives sometimes bring in the equivalent of a billyful,
and I remember reading in Spencer, somewhere, that he had seen the
surface of a stretch of country turned over for these ants so
thoroughly that it looked as if it had been prospected for
gold.</p>

<p>I was interested to know that it was an old acquaintance of
mine, Titus (habitually pronounced Tittus), who had dug out this
lot for me. He it was who looked so incredulous when we walked the
bush together and I could not see certain tracks which were so
obvious to him; but I remember him best because it was with him
that Professor Porteus and I entered a certain sacred corroboree
cave, once a storehouse for Churinga. It was black as midnight
inside; we had to crawl with our heads close to the ground, and we
had no torch. Very carefully did I sweep the floor ahead of me with
a stick&mdash;I had no desire to meet a snake at face level. Then,
as the roof lifted and a match was struck, something sprang at us
suddenly and swiftly from the shadows and passed so dose that our
light flickered and all but went out.</p>

<p>It was only a bat; but I never did care for caves, so we crept
out again (I hope with no undue haste) to sit in the blessed
sunlight and eat the lunch provided by the hospitable missionaries
of the Finke River, a lunch, I need hardly say, which contained
neither witchetty grub nor honey-ant.</p>

<p>After I returned to the humdrum life of the city, a public
appeal was made by the Finke River Mission for funds to lay pipes
from the Korporilya Springs to the Mission. The appeal reminded me
of a walkabout I shared one day with some sixty little black
children.</p>

<p>The Korporilya Springs are five miles from Hermannsburg. In a
land where a drought may persist for years, the springs have never
been known to fail; their value is beyond stating.</p>

<p>Great was the excitement at the station when the picnic was
announced. The youngsters dashed about in great glee. By ten
o'clock we were off, a long straggling chattering line, the older
children carrying the tucker (mainly flour for a damper), the
younger dodging about like dogs let loose from the chain, their
sharp eyes missing nothing. Woe betide the animal, whether beetle,
lizard, grub, snake, or anything else that could be tracked down,
which showed a trail across the path to Korporilya that morning!
Everything is food to the blackfellow.</p>

<p>The way led across sandy flats as dry as the Sahara or over
stony ridges where only an occasional hardy tree, clinging
desperately to life, broke the skyline. A broad pad showed plainly.
To a southerner like myself, accustomed to the narrow tracks made
by our native creatures and by sheep and cattle, this would have
been a puzzle had I not known that two camels, burdened with metal
containers, daily paced this ten miles to bring in water to the
station. The camel's big spongy foot leaves a print as if a
dinner-plate had been pressed on the soil; a much-used track winds
across the desert with the definition of a motor road.</p>

<p>Crows caa-ed sadly, but beyond that there was no sign of life,
at least to the eyes of a white pfella. But here came a change! All
at once we had arrived at green vegetation, the lining of a creek
bed where the waters of Korporilya spread out and vanished in the
thirsty sands. Trees flourished, birds sang, and, from the shade,
soft Arunta voices hailed the children. A group of adults was
camped at this the only spot for many miles where there was a real
chance of securing some "bush tucker." The well-picked backbone of
a <i>pirinti</i> testified to one feast, and presently a tall
native came down the hillside carrying on his shoulder the
still-warm body of a euro (a kind of kangaroo) which he had
killed.</p>

<p>Never had the value of water, both to man and beast, been so
emphasized to me as when we passed from the desert into this
oasis.</p>

<p>Pushing up the valley we came to pools sheltering below steep
hillsides and finally to the actual source, where, crystal-clear,
cool and inviting, the stream gushed from crevices in a face of
rock. This was the spot, and the scattered children clustered round
as a fire was lighted and the preparation began for lunch.</p>

<p>Bark was stripped from a tree to use as a kneading-board and
busy little hands went to work, amidst a great clatter of tongues,
to mix the flour and water to a right consistency. There were
sixty-four children and enough separate little dampers were made to
go all round, with one or two over for luck. While these were
cooking in the ashes we scattered about the watercourse and the hot
hillsides, the white pfellas finding much to increase their
knowledge, the kiddies something, doubtless, to please their
appetites. But we did not wander far with that smell of cooking
ever calling us back.</p>

<p>Presently we were lined up, and the dampers, done to a turn (or
so it seemed to the hungry circle) were scraped from the fire and
handed out. To the joy of the youngsters I had taken my place in
the line with them and insisted on my share, but something better
than "store teeth" is needed for a successful attack on such food
and, after a brave show of enjoying it, I was glad to give my
bullet-proof lump to the better-equipped youngsters about me.</p>

<p>Two small naked Luritja children, whose tribe had come in from
the far Macdonnells a few days before, had been brought to this
walkabout. Shy, wondering little things, with no English and no
Arunta, I would have given something to be able to know their
thoughts of it all.</p>

<p>There was other food to follow, and we rested and took
photographs, enjoying more than I can say the luxury (most city
folk cannot realize what a luxury it can be) of running water to
drink and to wash in. Later we sent the children downstream out of
the way and we enjoyed to the full the second of the only two baths
it had been found possible for us to have while in that
drought-stricken country.</p>

<p>As we caught up with young Australia again, two of the boys
raced to Mr Heinrich (the Superintendent) calling rapidly in
Arunta. "They have two snakes down there to show you," he
explained. "Saucy pfella?" I asked the lads, meaning were they
poisonous snakes. They said "No." "Big pfella?" "Not big pfella."
They led us to a little pool where the two "snakes" were being
watched by a curious crowd of adults and kiddies. To our
astonishment the reptiles, so-called, proved to be worms,
apparently the common earth-worm. (Baldwin Spencer has noted that
the earth-worm is seldom found in these parts.)</p>

<p>Near by stood a handsome tree, perhaps twenty feet high, with
pendent branches and a crop of bright yellow seed-pods, resembling
those of our Victorian pittosporum. The blacks called it
<i>tnauta</i>. Round about were innumerable shells of a native
snail which had perished in thousands, presumably because of the
drought. A flat-topped rock, just the height of a table, proved to
be of exceptional interest, for this was the famous rain-stone of
the Arunta tribe. Taking a handful of the bleached snail-shells,
the wise man rubbed them to powder on the stone, shaping clouds
from their dust and invoking the aboriginal Jupiter Pluvius to fill
them with moisture. There were no evidences that the rain-maker had
made any recent attempts; he was probably too good a weather
prophet.</p>

<p>And so home. The children straggled and grew weary and the
bigger ones carried the smaller till we all reached Hermannsburg
again. That they revived at once was evidenced by the shrill
chatter that broke out at the sight of parents and was maintained
for hours afterwards.</p>

<p>At the station itself the problem of water was serious indeed.
It would have been too costly to remove the buildings to Korporilya
so Korporilya must be brought to the buildings. The fall of the
land favours a pipe-line, labour was available, and the supply of
water inexhaustible. Three years before, the drought brought death
by scurvy to forty-three of the natives at the station; how many
perished in the wilds can never be known. Had there been then this
water-supply, those lives would have been saved, for the water
means fresh vegetables and fruit and, what is important indeed to
these dispossessed people, steady employment to take the place of
the native activities no longer possible to them but so essential
to their health and well-being.</p>

<p>All this has now been attained, for the pipes are laid, the
water flows, and the mission gardens, full of green vegetables, are
a welcome sight to behold.</p>

<p>The camel is very much in evidence at Hermannsburg. He is still
used as a beast of burden and many a tourist (for tourists now
commonly pass through the mission reserve as a side trip on their
way to Darwin) has had the novel experience of riding one of the
big beasts from the Finke to the oasis at Palm Valley. I recall
very vividly indeed my first mount.</p>

<p>The beast sat before me, saddled and bridled, holding his
ridiculous head with that injured air which all camels affect. They
seem to have been born annoyed, and to have disapproved of
everything since. As I approached he turned his face my way, opened
his mouth to show a set of great, ugly, yellow teeth, and let out
an astonishing roar. It was at once plaintive and threatening, the
roar of a beast dying in unendurable agony, but determined to slay
any one who touched it. Later I was to know that this is the
correct thing in camel circles; the performance was repeated
whenever the proper occasion arose.</p>

<p>A stirrup hung from the saddle at the rear of the hump. To an
accompaniment of heart-rending groans and threats of biting, I
mounted to the seat, adjusted my feet, and took a firm grasp of the
reins. I suppose that there is good reason for it, but to the
novice the contrivance offered for the control of a lofty,
overbearing creature like the camel seems the most inadequate which
could be suggested. As I experienced it, it was a piece of
clothes-line in a loop round the neck, the forward ends fastened to
a few inches of ordinary string. This in turn was tied to a small
stick, known as a nosepeg, and the nosepeg was stuck through a hole
bored in the side of the left nostril of the camel. That was all
there was either to guide the steed or to check any misbehaviour on
his part. If you pulled hard the nosepeg came out, and if you did
not pull hard the camel took no notice of you. I soon learned that
a stout stick was better than all the pulling.</p>

<p>But the camel still sat; how was I to make him rise and go?
Terence entered, a sturdy young Arunta native, perhaps aged
twenty-five years, taciturn, up to all camel tricks. He kicked
Korporilya (for so I named my mount) in the badly upholstered
portion of him which to some extent concealed his ribs, and I had
just time to grasp the pommel when the upheaval began. Without
warning the rear part rose halfway and flung me forward. With no
pause the front part responded and threw me back. Again the tail
portion ascended, once more the front&mdash;and I was on a level
keel and safe for the moment. The camel may be said to form fours
as he rises, and he folds into fours as he subsides again. Some of
my tribal friends made no attempt to disguise their enjoyment of
the scene. I had figuratively, as well as literally, gone up in
their estimation.</p>

<p>We were well out in the desert to the west of Alice Springs, and
were about to follow the great Finke River as far as the Palm
Valley and its neighbouring Glen of Palms&mdash;proofs, the
geologists say, that once this country enjoyed tropical conditions,
for there alone in that district grow palms. All about us stood
groups of the Arunta tribe, appreciative to the full of the white
man's awkwardness. Doubtless the scene was cleverly mimicked, good
actors that they are, for the pleasure of many a future camp. How
high it seemed on that elevated perch! I looked down with a feeling
of almost Alpine aloofness. But just then we started, for
Korporilya was not going to be left behind the other two camels
which formed our team. In the lead was Ranji, an old bull camel,
with Terence on him. He was easy to follow; we calculated that he
roared a protest at every tenth pace. As we wound through the
gorges of the Krichauff Range he woke the echoes until we felt that
the whole listening world must know his woe. Only when he was
unharnessed and turned loose at night did he subside. Once, on the
homeward journey some days later, he missed his beat, and there was
an astonishing silence. "Ranji has decided to be a strong, silent
camel!" called my companion, and even the impassive Terence looked
interested. But I was too soon with my answering quotation:</p>

<p class="poem">Silence, like a poultice, comes to heal the blows
of sound,</p>

<p>for Ranji broke in midway, and peace fled.</p>

<p>The route by the ever-winding Finke has been described. Possibly
there are few rivers in the world quite like this 1000-mile long
depression, which customarily knows no water from end to end. The
camels would grab at a thorn bush in passing, tearing off a spiky
mouthful, or, suddenly stretching their long necks, would almost
unseat the riders to snatch a hardly visible plant of parakelia,
the only juicy-looking growth in all that wilderness. Into Palm
Valley we passed at the pace set by camels; a pace, by the way,
which is much faster than it looks. They cover thirty miles a day,
even with heavy loads. Here, for the first and only time in a
fortnight, we encountered fresh water. All about the creek bed were
the famous palms; from the towering rock walls drooped cycads,
birds twittered and sang, and we forgot for a while the savage
desert which lay about us, since it held in its thirsty hands this
cup of comfort.</p>

<p>A camper for so much of my life, I was particularly interested
to see how our blackfellow would settle down for the night. It was
simple enough; he chose a sandy spot, lit a very small fire, and
was at home. But first, with many a vigorous "Hooshta!" we had made
our still groaning camels kneel and had unloaded each. Hobbled, and
with the traditional camel-bell tinkling, they were left to wander
where they would. For a considerable time they ruminated, sitting
like small hillocks in the growing dusk, then one by one they rose
and began to feed. Their bells rang ever more softly as the great
beasts wandered farther away, until at last we noticed them no
longer.</p>

<p>Terence was busy at his tiny blaze. He was kneading flour on a
piece of bark. "You makem damper, Terence?" I asked. "<i>Aua!</i>"
said he, and later gave me a generous hunk of the result. It looked
rather like a grindstone, and had the taste which you would expect
that useful implement to have. After much attempted mastication of
a mouthful, I gave up the attempt to eat it. No wonder the natives
have such good teeth! Having destroyed part of his damper, I
offered Terence some of our bread. He accepted it with a readiness
which was a most serious reflection upon his own cooking. In a land
where fresh meat was at the time unprocurable, we had nothing to
cook. We opened tins, gave Terence his share, and sat by our fire
for the evening meal. Terence dined apart; our big white-pfella
fire was not to his liking. He ate decorously, if hungrily. The
tinned fruit, which followed, was particularly to his liking; every
black-fellow seems to have a sweet tooth. Tea was just as great a
weakness&mdash;but in that we bore him stout company.</p>

<p>It was, in R. L. Stevenson's happy phrase, "a wonderful clear
night of stars." The darkness had taken to itself the bodies of the
strange hills which surrounded us. Only their fretted crests showed
dimly against the sprinkled sky. With that lofty dome above us, and
the remembrance that, whichever way we turned, at least 1000 miles
lay between us and the surrounding sea, we felt small beyond
measure. But Terence wasted no time in philosophic reflection. He
coiled himself in a pair of blankets close to his private fire, and
was, seemingly, at once asleep. We white men, as usual, piled on so
much wood that we had to make our beds well away from the cheerful
blaze. The night grew cold, our fire died, and, shivering, we had
to crawl from our beds and build it again. Not so Terence; he had
the end of a long dry sapling burning, and as he felt the warmth
subsiding he merely put out his hand and pulled on another foot or
so of the stick. No turning out into the cold for him!</p>

<p>Morning broke dear and fresh. Directly above us two
starved-looking crows commented sadly on our being alive, and flew
away disappointed. Terence, too, had made off, for the camels were
miles away, and he had to track them. That was easy to his trained
eye, and by noon we were lunching in the Mpurrenteturri Cave, some
miles farther on in the journey.</p>

<h2><a name="c14" id="c14"></a>CHAPTER XIV &mdash; HUNTING THE
RELICS</h2>

<p>My first expedition quickened a lifelong interest in our
aborigines, an interest that had lain dormant for want of just such
an experience. Incidentally I began then a collection of native
implements and sacred objects which has grown to be of considerable
importance. To increase that collection I have paid visits to most
of the well-known, and long-deserted, camping grounds in Victoria,
but none of these journeys equalled in interest the motor drive to
Marree with my friend S. R. Mitchell in 1930.</p>

<p>Never was there a keener collector than Mitchell. He drove, but
he had an eye for everything&mdash;the road, the timber, the
flowers, the birds, the sluggish blue-tongue lizards which so
frequently flirted with death by lying across the track, the
occasional kangaroos, the hurrying emus; he missed none of them.
But these, after all, he took in his stride. They were incidentals.
His eye was all the time seeking other game. "Blackfellow!" he
would call, the brakes would go on and we were out in a moment
eager for the hunt.</p>

<p>The sign had probably been a little pile of stones, burnt brown
or black, lying on a claypan, or helping to form a mound on a
sand-blow. These blackfellow cooking places are commonly near the
banks of creeks or swamps or water-holes and are most numerous
where the precious fluid has been most nearly permanent. About
them, hidden by the sand or exposed by the action of the wind, lie
the stone implements dropped by the tribes when they moved camp to
another site. They will never return to recover them, for in this
particular part of Australia, distant though it is from cities, not
one blackfellow remains in his native state to care what becomes of
the tools and weapons and articles of daily use which he and his
ancestors had taken such pains to fashion. Those implements were
what we were hunting.</p>

<p>We had come long miles to their collecting. Narrow little
Victoria, from Melbourne to the Murray at Tocumwal, had been no
more than an afternoon's run. But a different tale was to tell when
we began to crawl, like ants on an endless floor, across the wide
plains of New South Wales. A very small mound would show as a
considerable hill on those seemingly boundless flats. Ever we
pushed the horizon before us, never apparently getting nearer.</p>

<p>It is true the surface varied; here was mallee and there pine; a
low-growing scrub, sometimes gay with flowers, made a patterned
carpet; saltbush, bluebush and grasses had their turn; and, glory
of glories, occasionally we came upon acres of Sturt's Desert Pea
in profuse bloom. Surely never was a finer sight of its kind than
is made by this lovely <i>Clianthus</i> in its vivid crimson and
black. It looked as if multitudes of tiny flames, deeper-toned than
ordinary fire, trembled upwards through the cool grey-green of the
foliage. "The bush burned but was not consumed." That picture must
always remain with us; for it alone, if for nothing else, our
journey would have been worth while.</p>

<p>Industrious Chinese gardeners, one would think, had been busy in
many parts. Not that any dwelling showed&mdash;we learned to expect
no more than one house in forty or fifty miles&mdash;but we would
run into patches of melons growing as thickly as in the most
carefully cultivated of gardens. One variety was round and
dark-green, very like the pie-melon of the greengrocers' shops;
another was larger, yellow of skin, oval in shape, in outward
semblance a cousin of the vegetable marrow. "Paddy melon" and
"squash melon" were local names. A Burbank may rise to make this
waste material profitable; at present the melons lie in their
myriads, covering the ground for miles, unused. "The stock will eat
them at a pinch," said someone, but he made it clear that they were
not popular with man or beast and he added the alarming
intelligence that one species causes blindness in the animal which
eats it.</p>

<p>A line of gums ahead generally indicated a creek. The car would
plunge down the near bank, groan and rock across the shingly
bottom, generally dry, and lurch up the opposing side to the
accompaniment of screams from gaily-painted and very noisy Galahs,
always making the most of any chance to seem scared, the rattling
calls of Top-knot Pigeons, and alarms and excursions of the bird
world generally. A sandy, pebbly hillside would attract
attention&mdash;here might be good hunting. So a-hunting we would
go, stooping and rising over our finds like feeding emus.</p>

<p>We are told by the scientists that many of the relics we were
discovering are common to stone-age peoples the world over. Here in
Australia we have actual contact to-day with the one considerable
body of such folk that still exists; but, and it is an amazing
thing, we have to guess at the meaning of much that we pick up.
None knows why some of the implements were made and whether they
were for particular or general use. There are plenty of
speculations of course, and some probably have hit the truth, but
in the absence of agreement amongst the experts the layman finds
himself standing on the shifting sands of doubt.</p>

<p>However, some of the uses are perfectly obvious. Unmistakably
the worn slabs known generally as Nardoo stones were the mills on
which edible seeds were ground. Probably pigment in the lump was
also reduced to a manageable powder by such means. They are of many
kinds of stone, these mills, and of varying shapes; but all alike
have a basin-like cavity which deepens from the edges to the centre
as the result of rubbing. Some have the cavity on each side; in
some a hole has been actually worn through. The rubbing-stones,
usually fairly soft and just large enough to be easily grasped, may
be found in numbers; also pounding stones, often smashed at the
ends through smiting hard substances.</p>

<p>These are all objects easily, observed, but in the astonishing
debris (astonishing both in quantity and variety) of a
long-established camp were numbers of smaller objects which only
the practised eye would distinguish as shaped by man&mdash;tiny
"crescents," narrow "points," <i>tuhlas</i> (or scrapers) sometimes
worn back by use to half their original size, the pointed tools
known to the Wonkonguru as <i>pirries,</i> small stone knives, and
many odds and ends which might have had any number of uses.
Examination would show that they had been carefully worked over by
the native artificer to secure the desired form. Of the
<i>pirrie,</i> leaf-shaped and often beautifully chipped, Dr Horne
has said that it is dainty enough to be worn as a charm on a watch
chain. Certainly some we found could rightly be described as
beautiful.</p>

<p>More rare, so the more eagerly sought, were stones generally
called "cylindro-conicals," a foot or more in length, tapering like
a cow's horn and occasionally, like it, curved. The base might be
two or three inches across, always hollowed slightly, and mostly
with the edges smashed as if the whole thing had been used as a
wedge and in that capacity had suffered some powerful blows. An axe
with a nicely ground edge was an occasional prize, but nothing
wooden remained in all this countryside save a few fragments of
ancient throwing-sticks.</p>

<p>Certain dry lakes were dotted with such obvious things as mills
and pounding stones. A gleam of white bone made us pause. "Yorick!"
said our expert, and carefully, very carefully, did we dust away
the thin layer of sand which only partly hid the skeleton of one
who, like Hamlet's jester, had doubtless had his gibes, his
gambols, his songs, his flashes of merriment but now lay, even as
Yorick, quite chap-fallen. This stretch of sheltered flat had been
not only a camping ground for the living; several other skeletons
showed their outlines from beneath the soft surface, and fragments
of skulls were numerous.</p>

<p>We camped that night by the edge of this lonely lake and one at
least of the party hoped, somewhat fearfully, that a ghostly
company might dance a corroboree with the moonlight shining through
the fleshless ribs. But a full moon rose in a still air and the
dead tribes stirred not at all. Civilization destroyed them; no
prayers of white or black can bring them back.</p>

<h2><a name="c15" id="c15"></a>CHAPTER XV &mdash; THE LIVING
ABORIGINAL</h2>

<p>A wide river bed, innocent of water, broken into many dryas-dust
channels by islands of sand and stones, a clear untroubled sky with
nothing to stay the sun from his work of withering up the little
remaining vegetation of this central region of Australia, and a
group of natives, as naked and unashamed as our first parents,
performing rites so old that they dwarf the white man's antiquity
as the Pyramids dwarf the motor-car. We who watch have stepped back
across the centuries, if not to the actual stone age, at least to
an age of stone.</p>

<p>The Time Machine invented by H. G. Wells took apparently only a
few seconds to carry its rider down the ringing grooves of change
to those dim far-off days when order was first appearing out of
chaos: lacking such means of moving in the fourth dimension we had
done well to travel in four days the twenty thousand, fifty
thousand, one hundred thousand&mdash;who shall say how
many?&mdash;years that separate modern civilized man from these
people.</p>

<p>We have arrived in their land, we have studied their every
movement, but what do we know as the result of our close and
interested observation? The springs of action remain concealed, to
be guessed at and wrangled over, but no more. Who shall say with
authority what these dark nomads mean in their ceremonies when they
themselves have lost all but legend, and that of the very
mistiest.</p>

<p>This group of some forty men, women and children, is of the
Luritja nation, next-door neighbours of the Arunta. They have come
in from the far Macdonnell Ranges to pitch their simple camp, a few
bushes piled to the windward of little fires, in the bed of the
great Finke River near the Hermannsburg Mission Station. As no rain
had fallen in any appreciable quantity for years, the river had
passed out of existence save as a thirsty depression in which,
miraculously, many fine gum-trees still survived.</p>

<p>Long-muscled men they are, shapely enough, runners and walkers
rather than lifters or diggers, neat in action, brown (not black)
of skin, shaggy-headed and shaggy-bearded, frank of eye, carrying
themselves with a natural dignity which is very attractive, utterly
spoilt in appearance when, to obey the missionary convention in
approaching the station, they must put on clothes. That act
transformed them from kings to beggars; the borrowed rags were an
ass's head upon the natural man.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="pic36" id="pic36"></a><img alt="" src=
"1403041h-images/WideHorizons36.jpg"><br>
<br>
<i>Corroboree Dress</i>
</p>

<p>Their shelters, quickly erected, were no more than a leaning
line of boughs, about three feet high, on the side from which the
south-easter blew. Under this they lay at night with their little
fires glowing in front. The domestic scenes were often attractive.
A young mother, sitting on the sand, suckled her baby. Near by
played her elder son, a boy of perhaps eighteen months or two
years. He stopped his play, ran to his mother and helped himself at
the other breast. That same family was met later on a food
excursion. Mother carried the few possessions and the infant;
father had his weapons in his hands, and straight across his back
lay the bigger lad, his head resting in the crook of father's left
elbow, his legs in the bend of the other arm.</p>

<p>Although these Luritj as are the nearest neighbours of the
Arunta tribe, the two languages differ so markedly that none of the
tribe could speak Arunta, and, of course, they knew no English. We
secured the services of Gerog, who declared he could "speakem two
side" (that is he could speak two languages), and he opened the
door to intercourse by informing our hosts that we were brothers of
the Arunta. Much interesting matter followed.</p>

<p>We had been made members of the Arunta tribe a few days before,
members by adoption, not by formal initiation, the Powers be
praised! Only the young and strong could endure with safety the
searching ceremonies preliminary to admission by prescribed ritual,
the mildest being the knocking out of a front tooth by means of a
stick as a gouge and a stone as a hammer. Every Arunta man who
smiled at us, and it is a generally friendly nation, displayed that
disfiguring gap in the white line of his wonderful teeth. In their
wisdom the old men (all is old-man rule; there is no chief or king
in the accepted sense) had placed my companion, Professor Porteus,
in the matrimonial division called Pungata and had given him the
Ilya (the Emu) as his totem. I was joined to the Bultara division
and became Tchilpa (a Wild Cat).</p>

<p>This was all serious enough to the tribe, as we soon found. From
the babies to the greybeards every one knew exactly our
relationship to every member of the community. A goodly number of
these mission natives knew a little English. "What name?" I would
ask. "Gerog," would perhaps be the reply. "Arunta?" was invariably
my next question; for a few Luritjas were about. <i>"Aua!"</i>
(yes) would come the answer, generally in a tone suggesting that I
should know an obvious thing like that. Inquiry as to "What skin"
(what division of the tribe) the man belonged to, was the final
interrogation and quite often the bright eyes would look
incredulously at me before there came, in rather astonished tones,
"Bultara&mdash;your brudder!" I should not be ignorant of a fact so
patent.</p>

<p>The Arunta have evolved a marriage system which, all
pronouncements to the contrary notwithstanding, is the puzzle of
the anthropologist. Disregarding the legends of the Alcheringa,
that far-off time when the Spirits were busy creating everything,
what great leader had the mathematical mind suggested in a scheme
whereby (was it accident or design) in-breeding was prevented, just
to mention one of the results? There are eight divisions. As a
Bultara I may marry into the Kumara division only. My son becomes
automatically, by birth, Knuria. He in his turn may marry only into
the Ngala division. His male children (my grandchildren) come back
again to Bultara, while it takes five crosses over to achieve the
same result when the offspring are female. It is the same with the
other divisions&mdash;no one may marry into his own section of the
tribe. Very closely is this observed; so firmly is its need
believed in, even today, that the missionaries have had to
recognize and allow it.</p>

<p>With such definite bounds determining whom he may wed, is it any
wonder that my tribesmen regard with scorn the casual unguided ways
of the white man in such an important matter. "White pfella alla
same dog. Catchem any pfella!" was the caustic summing-up of a
certain Oknirrabata (wise old man).</p>

<p>A child's tribal division, it will be seen, is determined by his
parentage, but his totem is acquired in quite another way. That
comes to him from the locality in which his mother was when she
felt the babe quicken within her, so in a family of half a dozen or
more children there may be as many totems, while the parents'
totems again may differ from that of the offspring. The totem may
be regarded as an accidental matter. It certainly appears to have
nothing to do with descent. A father may be Paroola and of the Emu
totem, the mother Panunga and a Witchetty Grub, and the children,
who would be Kumara, may be a Hakea Tree, another a Frog, another a
Wild Cat, another a Hawk, and so on.</p>

<p>But the tribal practices, ceremonies, beliefs and legends are
going. They are being pushed into the limbo of forgetfulness by the
pressure of the white man as sweepings, good and bad alike, vanish
before a new broom. The old men are the repositaries of the wisdom
which has come down the centuries and a time is approaching, and is
not so far away, when they will have no one to transmit it to.
Their sons are in touch with a new world, many of their grandsons
are going to school, never to know the sacred things of their
ancestors save as strangers know them, never to know how to live as
those ancestors did, pitting knowledge against the often scanty
resources of their native land and winning through. White man
dwellings must replace the wurleys, white man tucker, bought and
not caught, oust the natural foods. "You spearem euro?" I asked a
mission-bred black with whom we camped in Palm Valley. "Me no
spearem euro. Old pfella spearem euro," was the reply. His contact
with civilization, and his dependence on the white man's supplies,
had robbed him of ability to spear the euro. In other words he
could no longer live as a blackfellow.</p>

<p>But, and it is a disastrous but, there is commonly no white
pfella work for such as he. There was none anyway during such a
drought period as we saw&mdash;and it had lasted five years! The
cattle of the station had dwindled by then to a couple of hundred,
and with their disappearance had gone the main source of white man
employment for the native.</p>

<p>I have said that a problem faced by the missionaries is that of
providing work for the man or woman they have attracted to their
station for the primary purpose of turning the heathen into
Christians. The trouble is a real one and no one deplores it more
than the missionaries, for no one sees its effects more clearly.
But they have no hope of overcoming it in any fair degree, so we
have the anomalous case of a body doing good, and intending nothing
else, yet doing also harm. To bring the native to a centre and hold
him there for at least fixed periods is believed to be necessary if
he is to learn the new doctrines; but that implies a certain
disqualification of him as a native, while the leaving of his
children to be brought up in a white environment, pupils of a
school, victims of the clothing habit, sleeping under roofs, eating
canned foods, marks, quite frequently, the end. To the native the
price of Christ, as of civilization, is, far too often, death.</p>

<p>Here let me say that apparently the only direct friend the
native has is the missionary. Inevitably the tribes must pass out
as the European finds more ways of using this wild region, whether
by damming its occasional flood waters and converting the
wilderness into cultivation areas, or by making its bizarre scenery
and its peoples a draw for tourists, or, most expeditious method of
all, by working the hills for their many minerals. A good goldfield
would shorten appreciably the period of the blackfellow on earth.
All the present civilizing agents can have but the one result. At
least the missionary's way is kinder than most, and the more
thoughtful of the natives may find hope in the vision of a life
beyond this, a life in which drought is unknown and tucker always
plentiful.</p>

<p>The Australian aboriginal has been frequently spoken of as
deficient in intelligence&mdash;"the lowest type of mankind" is the
term in common use. We were concerned <i>inter alia</i> with
testing that intelligence. Professor Porteus, from his University
in Hawaii, has reported the scientific results in his book. Here I
may only say that the general impression that the blackfellow is of
very low mentality is, to my mind, wholly wrong. "Their
intellectual development has reached heights that few white
Australians realize," to quote an acknowledged authority (Rev. J.
R. B. Love). The native is judged largely on his inability to
understand the white man's requests; the white man, completely
assured of his own superiority, forgets too often that he would be
in much worse case were the boot on the other foot and the black
man questioning him in a strange tongue. The European is apt to
disregard all standards save his own; a native taking the same
stand must be utterly contemptuous of the adult human being who
starves in the midst of plenty because he has not the intelligence
to recognize the food that is about him. In that land as we saw it,
gripped by drought until all its juices had been squeezed out, the
foreigner turned loose to forage for himself would be dead or
demented in three days; but the tribes have managed to survive,
however sorely put to it to maintain life.</p>

<p>That struggle through countless generations against adverse
fates has produced a race of observers probably unexcelled in the
world. The old saying, "Root hog, or die," may be translated, in
application to the desert peoples, as "learn how to track or
perish." From the swaying back of a camel we saw our black guide
riding Ranji, the roaring, grumbling old bull oont, and watching,
watching, watching the sands below him. A sign, invisible to most,
would take his gaze&mdash;track of bird or snake or giant lizard or
occasional wallaby&mdash;and, half-turning in the saddle, he would
follow it with keen look as far as might be, then survey
thoughtfully the hills that closed in on either side. Quite
evidently he was speculating as to where the beast was now and what
other live food was running about there.</p>

<p>We found that the white man's camp holds unexpected humour for
his darker brother. A fire too big to sit near is a sign of mental
aberration to a people accustomed to make tiny blazes both back and
front by which they are really warmed. It is as little
understandable as the white's desire to return home at the end of a
day&mdash;where the black is at sun-down is home. His contempt is
great for the European's ignorance of tracks: why any one should be
lost in the bush beats him altogether. "What you do when you get
lost, Jackie?" asked a white of an aboriginal; "you must get lost
sometimes." Jackie reflected: "Yes, me get lost sometime. When me
get lost, me go back to camp."</p>

<p>His art of tracking is taught in earliest childhood and is
practised throughout life. It becomes ingrained habit. No mark
escapes the aboriginal, nothing moves that he does not see. And he
knows, moreover, which way the creature whose faint pad he has
noticed was heading and how long since it passed. "Snake track,
Jackie," exclaimed someone, proud to draw attention to what he
thought his native boy had missed. But Jackie had seen it and
merely grinned. "Why you no catchem?" persisted the white man,
knowing that snake is an aboriginal delicacy. "No good," came from
Jackie. "Two day!" In other words the track was two days old.</p>

<p>Who could doubt it? Certainly no one who has seen a blackfellow
identify the footprints, not only of his companions but of their
dogs! "That fella belonga Tapinah," and so on.</p>

<p>At every native camp we noticed how seemingly careless the
owners were of their spears and shields and boomerangs and their
few other belongings. These were usually hanging about on the roofs
of their wurleys and, as no native house is high enough to stand
upright in, they could be reached by any one. But, if any did take
them, inevitably would it be known who was the thief. An old fellow
at Hermannsburg was credited with being able to identify the
footprints of all the natives who formed that community of
hundreds. Remembering the reputation our Australian brother has
earned as a tracker, we made a special test one day. Those present,
in addition to Professor Porteus and myself, were half a dozen of
the Arunta, a Luritja named Tapinah, and a young German who was
attached to the mission.</p>

<p>A portion of the prevailing sand was smoothed and a native
impressed a footprint and rejoined the others standing against the
wall. All marks were obliterated save that one. Meanwhile I held
Tapinah in converse the other side of a shed. (I had no Luritja
save one word, <i>"Balalingo,"</i> meaning very good; he had no
English; so our converse was largely smile and gesture.) At the
call I led Tapinah round and indicated the solitary footprint. One
glance and he turned and pointed to the right man. Eight times was
he tried and seven times was he correct without hesitation or
apparent consideration, although one man was put on twice in
succession to try to confuse the tracker. The eighth time Tapinah
gazed at the print, gazed at the row of men, and made no sign.
"That fellow, that fellow, that fellow?" queried Professor Porteus,
pointing at each in turn, but Tapinah still stood mute. Then the
professor swung round and indicated the young German&mdash;"That
fellow?" he asked, and Tapinah's face became one large smile of
assent. It was that fellow all right; the white man had slipped off
a boot and made the print. <i>"Balalingo!"</i> we chorused, and
Tapinah beamed as much at the praise as at the trade tobacco which
was his reward.</p>

<p>At his camp near the Finke, his lubra, Wanti Wanti, suckled a
young baby girl, and her sister, Lucy, wife of Ali, nursed an
infant boy. Through an interpreter who could "speakem two side"
(talk both Luritja and English) we were invited to bestow names
upon the children. So there are two Luritjas of the rising
generation who will rejoice in the names' of Mokehana and Robin
respectively, to the possible bewilderment of future students of
that interesting nation. A very old woman, her teeth worn down by
hard foods until they were level with her gums, lay always at the
constant fire of the wurley. A foot had been burnt off and the
maimed leg was wrapped in rags. Flies, attracted by the refuse of a
too-long-established camp, swarmed and buzzed everywhere. One small
child, all head and protuberant stomach, lifted a face with no
visible eyes. In their places were two moving black-grey masses,
one of which he rubbed off to observe us. They were masses of
feasting flies. Here, too, was a babe, found deserted in the
ranges, the thinnest and most pitiable living thing I have ever
seen. Bear in mind that this was a camp seen under unusually bad
drought conditions.</p>

<i>"Black, but Comely"</i>
</p>

<p>We were told that the children of the aborigines are the freest
creatures in the world in their native state. They may do as they
please, even to being inordinately impudent to their elders. That
condition of things lasts till the age of formal admission to
membership of the tribe has been reached. Then, just when they
should be ranking as unbearable egotists, a startling change is
effected. They are subjected to trials, fierce and bloody, most of
them directed to the one end, that is, respect for the wisdom of
the old men and fear of the magic powers of which the elders of the
tribe alone have knowledge. These ceremonies bear a lasting result:
the youth gains a proper tribal perspective and becomes a good
citizen (from the tribal point of view). There is an incidental
matter which some observers claim is at the root of much of the
procedure. The old men know what their fate must be in a country so
inhospitable when once their powers fail, and much of what is
taught the young men as sacred is obviously intended as an old-age
pension for the cunning Oknirrabata. Certain foods, and they are
always the most delectable, may not be eaten by youth, but only by
grandfather and his fellow greybeards; their totem animals may not
form the diet of the young men, save in exceptional circumstances,
and then only sparingly, but there is nothing barred from the
ancient one, his totem creature included. Incidentally, he appears
to have first choice of wives so may always have a young lubra or
two to collect the succulent witchetty grub, the honey-ant with its
swollen bag of sweets, the lizard and the snake, dig the various
vegetable roots and prepare the seed flour to nourish his withered
body. Do they lack intelligence, these old men, judged by any
standard?</p>

<p>But down in the great sandy river bed sit the men of the tribe
that has just come in from the sunset. The women and children have
now been sent out of sight and hearing, for some of the ceremonies
we are to be shown they may not see and live. The men make fire for
us as a beginning; not by the method of rolling an upright stick
between the hands, as we know it in Victoria, but by rubbing the
hard edge of a wommera (a spear-thrower) to and fro across the
softer wood of a shield. One tall fellow stands on the shield as it
lies on the ground, back upwards; two others pull from opposing
sides, using the wommera like a cross-cut saw. I time them with a
stop-watch. In fifteen seconds there is smoke; in fifty-seven
seconds the fire is blazing merrily.</p>

<p>Each of these men is circumcised and all have suffered the
terrible rite of subincision. With the proper ceremonial knife,
stone-bladed and its handle made of grass-tree gum, they proceed to
demonstrate how the Lartna (the act of circumcision) is performed.
Wild-haired and naked, terribly in earnest, they form an arresting
group.</p>

<p>From that to blood-letting is a short step. One of the younger
men, whom earlier we saw as head of a family group composed of his
shapely wife and two small children, sits and selects a water-worn
stone from the river bed. With another larger pebble he hits this
several times, and behold he has made a three-cornered knife, the
blade a couple of inches long. The cutting edge is hardly of razor
keenness, but it is sufficiently sharp for his purpose. With a
length of native string he binds his arm just above the elbow to
make the veins swell, then deliberately he sets to work, with no
sign of emotion, to cut open with his crude weapon the largest
visible blood-vessel. By way, possibly, of sterilizing the part, he
rubs his hand first on the sand, then on his arm. After the
operation he loosens the string, rubs his hand over the wound and
pays no more attention to it. To secure more blood, with which to
sprinkle a shield, he now opens a small artery in another part of
his body. No sign of discomfort is betrayed at any stage of these
unhappy doings.</p>

<p>The full company now claims attention. They have ornamented
themselves with eaglehawk-down stuck in lines about their bodies. A
thick-set fellow stands above a small depression, lined with acacia
leaves, in which lie four round stones, decorated with down, which
represent emu eggs. Round the neck of the man is a hair string
suspending a much decorated bag (the emu's heart) in front of his
chest. He is the emu on guard and he peers this way and that and
never relaxes his vigilant outlook. To him enter the others,
stooping low and calling and whistling like young birds. They peck
about, near the parent bird, then group at his feet. "Wah, wah,
wah," they cry, then louder, "Wow, wow, wow, uwah, uwah," working
their bodies fiercely from side to side. All this while the old men
sitting in the river bottom beat time with sticks and stones,
singing something which sounds like "Nanjua-ay, nanjua-ay,
nanjua-ah!" repeated and repeated and repeated, varying only in
intensity as their ancient blood warms to the scene. It ends with a
leaping-up of all the performers, who mass about the central figure
and throw up their arms to a united yell.</p>

<p>More thrilling is the bone-pointing which succeeds the
corroborees, for this spells death to someone. Spencer tells that
the natives would not do this ceremony for him till a wind blew.
That was to disperse the poison and ensure that none lingered about
the camp.</p>

<p>Our people to-day are willing to show their powers, the
conditions apparently being favourable. Two men take part, one
kneeling low in the sand, the other crouching over and behind him.
They have a pair of poison bones joined by hair string, and they
know that they have but to point these at an enemy and "sing" him
and he assuredly dies. I find myself on their front, though well to
one side, and I am beckoned to move more out of the line of fire;
they do not want to "bone" me. I obey, and the dread ceremony is
gone through.</p>

<p>In retrospect I have sometimes wondered whether that exhibition
granted to us&mdash;looked upon by us just as a queer proceeding, a
matter of scientific interest&mdash;gave opportunity for one of
those warriors to work off a private grudge and, if so, what were
the reactions.</p>

<p>They compelled respect, these people, even as, apart from
certain habits and customs, they inspired liking. We pondered upon
their future. An early estimate gave 300,000 as the probable number
of natives when we Europeans took possession of their country some
150 years ago. The grave scandal of their rapid disappearance is
accentuated by the equally grave scandal that in this year of grace
1936 there are 20,000 half-castes in Australia and that the number
is rising fast. These men, now resting after their display, are as
yet uncontaminated&mdash;how long will it be before settlement robs
them of their liberty to roam? Cattle, which they are forbidden to
kill, take the place of their native game&mdash;their natural food
supplies&mdash;and white stockmen hound them off the waterholes,
which are now their most precious possessions, for without these,
their only water storages, they cannot live.</p>

<p>I look at them again. They are a smiling, good-humoured folk.
They sit in a circle and pass from mouth to mouth the battered
stump of a pipe charged with our tobacco. One of them breaks into
song, a high-pitched series of repetitions which would lead you to
suppose the man a tenor till he suddenly drops his voice to a deep
baritone. Gerog translates. The songs tell of hunting and of dogs;
and one apparently, but this is obscure, suggests the sort of
triangle one finds so often on the movie stage.</p>

<p>Two old men sit apart. There is something secretive about their
movements. No word is spoken by either. The elder has produced two
thin sticks about three feet long. He fashions them into a cross by
binding them with hair string in the centre. Now he proceeds to
take the string from point to point until he has an outline
resembling that of a boy's kite. Twisting the string round each arm
of the cross as he turns it about he fills in the frame for several
inches. He pauses and looks at his companion. Faint and low, with
an indescribable earnestness, solemnly as in any church office, the
other begins to sing. The winding is resumed, and I realize that I
am seeing the creation of a sacred implement. Moreover I sense that
the singing is the act of making it sacred. I learn later that it
is a <i>waninga,</i> an object used in secret ceremonials.</p>

<p>These two men are well past their prime. They will end their
days in the native way. With the younger men of the group it is
different. As I see their lean muscular frames, their keen eyes,
their obvious healthiness, and as I remember that each has in his
camp a family of little children, I recall with a pang the song the
Hermannsburg youngsters sang to us a night or two ago: "I do not
know the name of my sadness. I often think of the olden days when
plenty kangaroos sat on the hills. To-day I cannot find a single
one."</p>

<p>As a good Australian I deplore that we must confess failure in
dealing with our native races. We have studied them as museum
specimens are studied, we have tried humanitarian suggestions for
their betterment, but we have utterly failed to keep them alive.
Some outside advice is needed, or in a few years, a very few years,
there will be none of these unique stone-age people left&mdash;they
will have gone the way of the vanished Tasmanians, the way of
death.</p>

<h2><a name="c16" id="c16"></a>CHAPTER XVI &mdash; A NOTE ON THE
HALF-CASTE</h2>

<p>The observer was not altogether cynical who declared recently
that the principal output of Central Australia, in live stock, was
cattle, sheep, and half-castes. Challenged, he amended the
statement&mdash;but only to add the whole of the Far North and most
of Western Australia. Certain it is that the half-caste is
increasing notably in the Commonwealth. With the falling of full
bloods from an estimated 300,000 to about 60,000, the half-castes
have risen to 20,000. It is obvious to any one who knows the
conditions of life in the vast Inland that while they continue to
be as they are there can be no hope of preventing the mixture of
black and white, with the inevitable consequences. Men are cut off
from their own womankind; they are surrounded by young shapely
creatures, often of much natural grace. The result, however
deplorable, is natural, and no statute made by man has power to
stop it. The law of the Commonwealth is drastic enough, but
consider its enforcement. I asked a policeman in Central Australia
to indicate his beat. He waved his arm in an arc which took in
about half the horizon, and said: "Two hundred and fifty miles!" He
was not overstating it. A single cattle-station may be a hundred
miles across. It is ridiculous to suppose that such amazing areas
can be adequately policed. Whether it be the forbidden act of
harbouring native women at stations where only men are employed, or
assault in the secluded parts of the run, evidence is hard to get,
and, being native, it is regarded lightly. So the possibility of
detection being slight, and human nature being what it is, the
half-caste population will continue to increase.</p>

<p>In the old Indian saying that God made the white man and the
black man, but the devil made the half-caste, there is no reproach
levelled at the unhappy result of miscegenation. The implication is
only that the part-white child has a devil of a time. Quite
recently I saw more than a hundred of these unfortunates in the
home the Government has made for them at the old telegraph station
at Alice Springs. Very well tended and cared for they looked, and
happy enough. All were young; they had not reached the age at which
they would realize they were neither white nor black. But that
consciousness will come. "I wish my mother had strangled me at
birth," said one young woman, about twenty years old, to a
missionary. She had been brought up to white ways, educated, given
a taste for the refinements of civilization&mdash;only to find that
no civilized people wanted her, save in a way that was intolerable.
The blacks' camp and the life of the wurley were impossible now;
she was an outcast without a people. Yet these girls of mixed blood
are sometimes fairer than their white sisters, and both girls and
boys, as has been proved many times, may grow into dependable and
intelligent women and men.</p>

<p>But the problem of their aboriginal relatives, the full bloods,
is just as far from solution, it would seem, as that of the
half-castes. Most stations in the remote back country have their
blacks' camps. Indeed, many of the stations would find it difficult
to carry on without aboriginal labour. We found one camp on a bare
sandhill. No able-bodied blacks were about; they were away
mustering on a distant part of the huge property. A couple of gaunt
old men, one a striking figure some six feet high, were crouched
over a tiny fire in the entrance to a wurley. Half a dozen other
wurleys stood about, miserable structures, neither windproof nor
rainproof. Dogs scratched in every doorway, and a few old women
jabbered unintelligible comments on the visitors. Everything was
sordid in the extreme. One of the men was blind, the other suffered
from an eye trouble, which suggested that he too must soon lose his
sight. These, one could not help remembering, were originally the
owners here. The home of the present owners stood, a group of
substantial comfortable dwellings, in a sheltered spot, some three
hundred yards away. "The big fellow used to be a handy cattleman
before he got so old," said the manager, as we regarded the camp.
"He's pensioned off now, I suppose?" suggested someone. "Pensioned!
What for? Let the old blank look after himself!" was the reply. I
do not say that is typical, but it is true.</p>

<p class="cp"><i>"Civilized"</i>
</p>

<p>In another camp one of the old women, with more than average
English, spoke freely of her "harp-caste" children, one working
alonga such and such a station, the other "ober dat away." At still
another the patriarch who styled himself king, and wore a metal
label to that effect on his bare chest, was obviously proud of two
small half-caste sons of his lubra, who was much younger than
he.</p>

<p>Again let me say that it is idle to suppose that half-castes
will not continue to increase in numbers so long as opportunity
serves as it does at present&mdash;and that in despite of any
legislation, however minatory. The real problem to be faced is how
to deal with these people, justly and adequately. With diffidence,
for the question is a grave one and of growing importance, I
suggest that the matter of merging them into the general
population, with full citizen rights, should receive early and
sympathetic study. The first necessary step is obviously greater
facilities for education and insistence that all, wherever
possible, shall be treated in this regard as white children
are.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c17" id="c17"></a>CHAPTER XVII &mdash; THE QUICK AND
THE DEAD: SOME HISTORY AND A SUGGESTION</h2>

<p>As a sporting people we Australians are proud of our records;
for such a handful of folk, scattered over a huge area, we have
done rather well in quite a number of ways. But, unfortunately,
some of the achievements are records of a kind any country would
rather be without, and perhaps the worst is that of our treatment
of the original owners of the land we now possess.</p>

<p>What a shocking tale it is! Never mind for a moment who has been
to blame; take just the plain fact that in less than 150 years the
black population has been reduced from an estimated 300,000 (a
report to Exeter Hall in 1840 gave it as 1,400,000) to about
60,000, and these remnants are going fast.</p>

<p>Tasmania leads the way; not one of the interesting race which
once peopled that pleasant island remains alive today. Whites
settled there first in 1803; the Tasmanian race was extinct by
1876. It is always difficult to gauge the numbers of a shy, nomadic
people, but there seems to be little doubt that the native
Tasmanians numbered something like 2000. Brough Smyth described
them as a mild, kindly folk, diffident, willing to be friendly.
Captain Cook said they showed neither fear nor distrust. An early
writer, the Rev. T. Dove, remarked that harmony and good humour
reigned generally among the members of the tribe, and that "the
force of the parental instinct was strong enough to render the
maintenance of their offspring a care and a delight." He added
that, looking to</p>

<p class="quote">the methods which they devised of procuring
shelter and subsistence in their native wilds, to the skill and
precision with which they tracked the mazes of the bush, and to the
force of invention and of memory which is displayed in the copious
vocabulary of their several languages, they claim no inconsiderable
share of mental power and activity.</p>

<p>They seemed on the whole rather afraid of the invaders of their
territory until escaped convicts and ticket-of-leave men began to
steal the black women, and settlers began to occupy their lands.
Then the spears flew and a bloody war of extinction started. Brough
Smyth, the historian of the Victorian blacks, writing in 1876, has
some caustic things to say about this:</p>

<p class="quote">If they had not been men and women, if they had
not been human creatures, if they had been quadrumanous, every
detail connected with them would undoubtedly have been investigated
and recorded. But they were indeed human; and they were the enemies
of the white man because they wished to live in places where cattle
and sheep would thrive, and it was deemed necessary to exterminate
them; and they have been exterminated.</p>

<p>Leading up to that, the famous "line" was drawn in an endeavour
on a large scale to drive the whole of the aborigines into one
corner of the island. Despite the thoroughness of the preparation
the attempt was a signal failure, the entire result being the
capture of one native. The others slipped through the cordon. That
was in 1830. More pacific and suitable methods were then adopted by
some well-disposed citizens, and in the succeeding five years the
remaining Tasmanians were gathered together and placed on one of
the islands in Bass Strait. In 1854 there were but sixteen
survivors. Trucanini, last of her race, died in May, 1876.</p>

<p>Estimates of the number of aborigines who existed in Victoria
before the coming of the European vary considerably. One early
investigation placed it at 7500, another at 6000, another at 5000;
the lowest was 3000. An official return to the Legislative Council
made it 6000; by 1851 that was down to 2693; the 1871 census set
the total as 1330. Sir Thomas Mitchell, in his excursions through
Australia, saw very few natives, but, early as his journeys were,
one of the gifts of the white man to the black had already been
given; smallpox had been introduced and had destroyed a great many
of the original inhabitants.</p>

<p>It seems certain that in Gippsland there were more than a
thousand blacks. In forty-nine years they had dwindled to 200. The
two Melbourne tribes in 1838 tallied 292; there were twenty left in
1876. When the first settler camped on the Barwon the Geelong tribe
was about 200 strong; at the end of twenty years thirty-four
remained alive. To-day, in the whole of the State, there are
certainly not more than 100 full bloods&mdash;the official figure
is forty-five as the number under the care of the Aborigines'
Protection Board of Victoria.</p>

<p>But in this matter the history of one State is the history of
all States. At the 1921 census the New South Wales numbers had come
down to 1597 from 4287 in 1901, and those of South Australia to
1609 (the estimated number of the southern portion alone, when the
colony was founded in 1836, was 12,000), while Queensland still had
12,614, Western Australia 25,597, and Northern Australia 17,349.
The next census will assuredly show further decreases, for
civilization so far, in whatever form it has touched these wild
peoples, has been deadly in its effects.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that there should be clashes between invaders
and invaded in this, as in every other country. In many places,
though, where bold exploratory nations have pushed a way in, they
have had to contend with people, armed and organized, whose powers
of resistance made them formidable opponents. Not so the
Australian. His tribes were in small, scattered groups, speaking
many tongues, and quite incapable of unity because of these and
many other reasons, such as the huge distances separating the
parts. The black had his spear and his boomerang against the
gunpowder and weapons of precision; it was the stone age against
the age of armaments; a baby against a grown man.</p>

<p>Nomadic they were, these native Australians, but nomadic only
within well-defined areas. "My country" was a very definite place
to which the owner was bound by sacred ties hardly to be understood
by a European, and wherein he looked for his means of living. Those
means were the native animal, the fish, the root, the berry,
whatever flourished in his domain. Strangers must not enter there,
save by formal sanction or at the risk of challenge to battle.
Suddenly the tribes found men stalking about their immemorial
territory, asking no sanctions, disregarding or pushing aside the
aboriginal owners, uprooting the trees and building huts, despising
all that the tribes held sacred. More and more of these intruders
came, they travelled inland, and, behold, the native game was
destroyed, fences criss-crossed the land and new animals cropped
the grass where the kangaroo had fed. Deprived of his natural food,
forbidden to roam at liberty across his old hunting
grounds&mdash;what was the black-fellow to do? He did what the
white man would have done in like case&mdash;he killed a sheep or
one of the cattle and filled his empty stomach.</p>

<p>An English doctor, travelling in the Mallee, wrote in 1851:</p>

<p class="quote">The result of my investigations as to the
treatment of the blacks by white men was a profound pity for the
blacks, and indignation against some of the whites for their cruel
neglect of, or barbarous behaviour to, the defenceless aborigines,
whose hunting-grounds have been rendered useless by the myriads of
sheep and cattle introduced, which had utterly driven away the
kangaroo and emu, upon which they had principally depended for
food; and, while their main sources of food were thus destroyed,
not the slightest attempt at compensation had been made by the
powerful aggressors, who shot down mercilessly any tribe which,
impelled by hunger, dared to touch a single sheep or cow of the
vast flocks and herds around them.</p>

<p>In killing a beast the black broke the white man's law, and he
must be taught the lesson. If within reasonable distance of
settlement he was brought in (often strapped to the stirrup of his
captor&mdash;even as sometimes happens to-day in certain remote
parts of our Commonwealth) and put through a meaningless (to him)
court ceremony which ended in imprisonment. Or, when the law did
not conveniently function, the station might muster its hands and
make a raid upon the nearest camp, shooting wherever a head showed.
Retaliation followed; the lonely shepherd was speared in his hut
and occasionally a homestead was attacked in force.</p>

<p>Then was the battle between white and black joined indeed. Once
a state of war was established, the stockman went armed to protect
himself, and organized raids were made wherever the natives were
known to be gathered together.</p>

<p>With no intention of discussing the merits of a case which has
been closed, readers may be reminded that within the last four
years a policeman in Central Australia, who went out to arrest a
native for killing a white man, stated in evidence that his party
shot down seventeen blacks, and a little later another fourteen.
The court of inquiry officially justified the action but the pity
of it! It seems incredible that there was no better means of
bringing a black criminal to justice than by the indiscriminate
shooting of thirty-one of his tribe. By virtue of his office the
constable was a protector of the aborigines!</p>

<p>Detailed tales of atrocities in the younger days of colonization
are plentiful enough. Many awful deeds were done by the blacks,
but, as E. R. Gribble points out in his <i>Problem of the
Australian Aboriginal,</i> it must be remembered that they
naturally resented the presence of the invader of their land, an
invader against whom they were powerless in any other
way&mdash;moreover, every dark deed perpetrated by the natives was
duly recorded, but not every case in which whites were the
culprits.</p>

<p>In 1843 an assistant protector of the aborigines in what is now
north-western Victoria reported that he had gone carefully into the
question and had found that from 1838 to 1842 the blacks in his
district had killed eight white men, the greatest number slain at
any one attack being two, while in the same period and locality
forty-three natives were done to death by whites&mdash;as many as
fourteen being destroyed at the one time. "This you will perceive
exhibits a fearful preponderance against the whites," remarks the
assistant protector.</p>

<p>Edward John Eyre, who in 1845 was resident in charge of the most
densely populated native district in South Australia and lived
there for three years, reported on certain acts of aggression by
blacks:</p>

<p class="quote">I believe were Europeans placed under the same
circumstances, equally wronged, and equally shut out from redress,
they would not exhibit half the moderation or forbearance that
these poor untutored children of impulse have invariably shown.</p>

<p>It may have been the massacre of some forty aborigines, young
and old, male and female, at Myall Creek, in New South Wales, a
massacre for which seven white men were hanged, that caused the
Governor of the day to issue a proclamation in 1839 that a special
Act had been passed "to put a stop to the atrocities which have of
late been so extensively committed both by aborigines and on them."
He went on to say that he had received instructions from Her
Majesty's Government to cause an inquest or inquiry to be
instituted in every case wherein any aboriginal inhabitants came to
a violent death in consequence of a collision with white men, and
that he meant to make no distinction in such cases whether the
aggressors or parties injured were of one or the other race or
colour, but to bring all to equal and indiscriminate justice. His
Excellency concluded by stressing the importance which he and the
Government attached to the just and humane treatment of the
aborigines, and he declared earnestly and solemnly his deep
conviction that there was no subject or matter in which the
interest as well as the honour of the colonists were more
essentially concerned.</p>

<p>Two years earlier it had been found necessary by the Governor to
threaten landowners in the outlying districts with cancellation of
their licences to occupy Crown lands, and with the intimation that
prosecution would follow as well, if the practice on the part of
"overseers and other persons in charge of sheep and cattle" of
detaining by force in their huts black women of the neighbouring
tribes were not stopped. "It is an offence," remarked His
Excellency, "not only of a heinous and revolting character, but, in
its consequences, leading to bloodshed and murder."</p>

<p>There he touched upon one of the most frequent causes of hatred
of white by black. Again, what possible recourse had husband or
tribe, in their ignorance of government proclamations and powers,
but the spear?</p>

<p>Here may be mentioned the half-caste. Half-castes belong to
neither race; they are customarily disowned by both. Hard indeed is
their lot, unjustifiably hard. As a statesman once said in the
Victorian Parliament: "It is not the child who is illegitimate; it
is the parents." Though the full bloods decline, the half-castes
steadily increase in Australia. In Western Australia his numbers
leaped from 900 to 2853 in twenty-five years. That is typical.</p>

<p>But enough of assaults and atrocities. While it is clear that
the aboriginal has suffered cruelly in that regard, it is equally
true that he has been injured by many of the well-intentioned
efforts at kindness. Civilization and he, as the two are now
brought together, have proved themselves definitely incompatibles.
To take the naked black, accustomed to the constant exercise of his
faculties in the pursuit and procuring of his food, living
altogether under the sky, knowing no restraint upon his freedom,
and place him in a stuffy hut with a tin to open instead of a
kangaroo to catch, and clothes to keep him dirty and unhealthy, is
to invite him to a quick death.</p>

<p>Again I would record my conviction that the missionaries,
earnest, self-sacrificing, and well-meaning, are among the very few
who are doing any practical work in the interest of our natives.
But again I would protest against some of the practices which
strike me as ill-advised. One was referred to by Dr Elkin in his
address, "Understanding the Australian Aborigine," when he
said:</p>

<p class="quote">We do need to realize that the family spirit is a
real thing in aboriginal life, and that, therefore, any system
which separates the children from their parents for long intervals
is unwise, unless it be while the parents are on walk-about. The
dormitory system, according to which the children sleep, perhaps
behind locked doors, and eat away from their parents, is not
necessarily in the best interest of the children, their parents, or
the tribe.</p>

<p>Bad, too, is the insistence upon the wearing of clothes when the
natives have always been unclad. Centuries of exposure to cold and
heat have inured them to what a white man would call very great
hardships. A naked black has been seen to sleep in the sunshine,
apparently without discomfort, when the temperature was so high
that a bar of iron beside him was too hot to hold. And in the
Macdonnell Ranges the tribes lie, quite uncovered, by their tiny
fires when frost is thick on the ground, and again are seemingly
content. Assuredly they need no covering or they would use the
skins of the furred animals they are constantly killing. But too
often the missionary, moved by compassion as much as by a sense of
decency, demands that clothes shall be worn. Dr Ramsay Smith
states:</p>

<p class="quote">Consumption, which is inseparable from the habits
of clothing and housing, is responsible for a large number of
deaths. It has been remarked that while many die from our diseases,
a great many also die from our treatment.</p>

<p>Decency could be honoured by the adoption of a short skirt or
loin-cloth, leaving the body otherwise free. Comparison of pictures
of a native in his natural state with photographs of the rag-clad
mendicants who advertise our Commonwealth so disastrously to
tourists on the east-west railway line should prove a liberal
education to those who are interested but do not know the
aboriginal at first hand.</p>

<p>But what were these savages like to whom the coming of the
European has proved so disastrous? Definitely, as a people, they
were not warlike. They had no chiefs; all was old-man government.
To avoid any hint of sentiment, let me quote from a scientist's
description:</p>

<p class="quote">One can hardly be said to have seen human grace of
carriage who has not seen an aboriginal walk...The voice is soft
and musical and rich in inflections...Mentally the aboriginal in
his native surroundings is observant, self-reliant, and quick...As
a race the aboriginals are polite, proper in their behaviour,
modest, unassuming, gay, fond of jokes and laughter, and skilful
mimics...They are by nature frank, open, and confiding, and
cheerful under all sorts of privation. Sometimes they show great
delicacy of feeling. In many things the aboriginal is scrupulously
honest; and his morality, according to his lights and teaching, is
as high as among the generality of uneducated white people.</p>

<p>Thus Dr W. Ramsay Smith, permanent head of the Department of
Public Health of South Australia.</p>

<p>Charles Pickering in his book <i>The Races of Man</i> tells us
that</p>

<p class="quote">strange as it may appear I would refer to an
Australian as the finest model of the human race I have ever met
with; in muscular development combining perfect symmetry, activity,
and strength; while his head might have compared with an antique
bust of a philosopher.</p>

<p>Spencer and Gillen testified to the generosity of the natives.
Mathew described them as a peaceful, kindly people. Many are the
explorers who have spoken in glowing terms of black friends.</p>

<p>Professor Gregory, in his <i>Dead Heart of Australia,</i> after
recounting how the natives with him offered to go without tea and
sugar (the most precious of things in that country of bad water)
when they found the supplies for the white men were running short,
remarked:</p>

<p class="quote">The popular conception of the mental and moral
characters of the Australian aborigines is as erroneous as is the
caricature of their personal appearance. The extreme kindliness of
the people, especially to the old, is one of their most striking
characteristics. Instead of being cruel and without affection, they
show a fondness for their children and a generous consideration for
the old and infirm members of their clan unusual among primitive
people.</p>

<p>He concluded, as so manyof the scientists do to-day, that the
Australian is of Caucasian origin&mdash;that is, he belongs to the
same race-group as ourselves.</p>

<p>To paraphrase Kipling:</p>

<p class="poem">They ain't no blooming angels<br>
And they ain't no blackguards, too,<br>
But simply human beings<br>
Most remarkable like you.</p>

<p>An interesting commentary on the foregoing is contained in an
official report by the chief protector of aborigines in South
Australia. Of a certain reserve he said: "The aborigines on this
land are practically untouched by the vices of civilization."</p>

<p>A few of the mission stations are now reporting small increases
in the numbers of full bloods under their charge. These are but
drops in the ocean of waste&mdash;still the tribes melt away! A
century and a half of effort on the part of governments, missions,
and numerous organizations and individuals has had no better result
than this&mdash;the tribes continue to vanish! Professor Wood Jones
has pointed out that all through the story of the settlement of our
continent runs the declaration, almost wearying in its reiteration,
that "something must be done" in way of repayment, the resolve that
we must deal fairly with the blackfellow.</p>

<p>He adds:</p>

<p class="quote">To-day these protestations are made with equal
fervour; to-day, as yesterday, they beget ready sympathizers. Were
the aborigine to find salvation in pious wishes, or were he to
derive prosperity from sympathetic resolutions, then indeed we
would have to rank him as a chosen people, so blessed would be his
lot.</p>

<p>It is time, much more than time, that protestation and sporadic
effort alike were put to an end. The regeneration of the black is a
nation's job and can never be accomplished by any section, however
earnest. Obviously it is a Federal matter, and one that the Federal
Government should undertake promptly if it is to retain the world's
respect.</p>

<p>Many are the suggestions which could be made as to the lines on
which action should proceed. One basic essential, as I have already
said, is the employment of a scientist, the best man the world can
produce, one preferably with successful experience in the ruling of
native races, a man of the Hubert Murray type, who should be given
first a free hand regardless of expense (bear in mind we owe these
people for the whole of a continent), and then the power to carry
out his findings. That will do for a beginning.</p>

<p>Is it too much to expect any good results at this stage? Listen
to one of our greatest authorities:</p>

<p class="quote">Those who think that the Australian aboriginal is
doomed to die out, and the sooner the better; those who think the
effort to save him is not worth the making; and those who deceive
themselves into imagining that in Australia we already have native
reservations, should go to Gallup in New Mexico and see for
themselves the Navajo Reserves, in which an interesting and nomadic
race is flourishing and increasing.</p>

<p>And as a final word:</p>

<p class="quote">No man should be entrusted with the care of
captive kangaroos unless he has some understanding of the ways of
kangaroos. Much more, no man should be entrusted with the care of a
native race unless he understands the lore, the legends, the
beliefs, and the prejudices of the people who are placed under his
jurisdiction.</p>
