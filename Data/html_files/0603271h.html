  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SINCE these papers have been put into my hands to edit, I
  will begin by reminding the public of the sad loss of the steamship
  <i>Stratford</i>, which started a year ago upon a voyage for the purpose of
  oceanography and the study of deep-sea life. The expedition had been
  organized by Dr. Maracot, the famous author of Pseudo-Coralline Formations
  and The Morphology of the Lamellibranchs. Dr. Maracot had with him Mr. Cyrus
  Headley, formerly assistant at the Zoological Institute of Cambridge,
  Massachusetts, and at the time of the voyage Rhodes Scholar at Oxford.
  Captain Howie, an experienced navigator, was in charge of the vessel, and
  there was a crew of twenty-three men, including an American mechanic from the
  Merribank Works, Philadelphia.</p>

  <p>This whole party has utterly disappeared, and the only word ever heard of
  the ill-fated steamer was from the report of a Norwegian barque which
  actually saw a ship, closely corresponding with her description, go down in
  the great gale of the autumn of 1926. A lifeboat marked <i>Stratford</i> was
  found later in the neighbourhood of the tragedy, together with some deck
  gratings, a lifebuoy, and a spar. This, coupled with the long silence, seemed
  to make it absolutely sure that the vessel and her crew would never be heard
  of more. Her fate is rendered more certain by the strange wireless message
  received at the time, which, though incomprehensible in parts, left little
  doubt as to the fate of the vessel. This I will quote later.</p>

  <p>There were some remarkable points about the voyage of the <i>Stratford</i>
  which caused comment at the time. One was the curious secrecy observed by
  Professor Maracot. He was famous for his dislike and distrust of the Press,
  but it was pushed to an extreme upon this occasion, when he would neither
  give information to reporters nor would he permit the representative of any
  paper to set foot in the vessel during the weeks that it lay in the Albert
  Dock. There were rumours abroad of some curious and novel construction of the
  ship which would fit it for deep-sea work, and these rumours were confirmed
  from the yard of Hunter and Company of West Hartlepool, where the structural
  changes had actually been carried out. It was at one time said that the whole
  bottom of the vessel was detachable, a report which attracted the attention
  of the underwriters at Lloyd's, who were, with some difficulty, satisfied
  upon the point. The matter was soon forgotten, but it assumed an importance
  now when the fate of the expedition has been brought once more in so
  extraordinary manner to the notice of the public.</p>

  <p>So much for the beginning of the voyage of the <i>Stratford</i>. There are
  now four documents which cover the facts so far as they are known. The first
  is the letter which was written by Mr. Cyrus Headley, from the capital of the
  Grand Canary, to his friend, Sir James Talbot, of Trinity College, Oxford,
  upon the only occasion, so far as is known, when the <i>Stratford</i> touched
  land after leaving the Thames. The second is the strange wireless call to
  which I have alluded. The third is that portion of the log of the Arabella
  Knowles which deals with the vitreous ball. The fourth and last is the
  amazing contents of that receptacle, which either represent a most cruel and
  complex mystification, or else open up a fresh chapter in human experience
  the importance of which cannot be exaggerated. With this preamble I will now
  give Mr. Headley's letter, which I owe to the courtesy of Sir James Talbot,
  and which has not previously been published. It is dated October 1st,
  1926.</p>

  <p>I am mailing this, my dear Talbot, from Porta de la Luz, where we have put
  in for a few days of rest. My principal companion in the voyage has been Bill
  Scanlan, the head mechanic, who, as a fellow-countryman and also as a very
  entertaining character, has become my natural associate. However, I am alone
  this morning as he has what he describes as 'a date with a skirt'. You see,
  he talks as Englishmen expect every real American to talk. He would be
  accepted as the true breed. The mere force of suggestion makes me 'guess' and
  'reckon' when I am with my English friends. I feel that they would never
  really understand that I was a Yankee if I did not. However, I am not on
  those terms with you, so let me assure you right now that you will not find
  anything but pure Oxford in the epistle which I am now mailing to you.</p>

  <p>You met Maracot at the Mitre, so you know the dry chip of a man that he
  is. I told you, I think, how he came to pitch upon me for the job. He
  inquired from old Somerville of the Zoological Institute, who sent him my
  prize essay on the pelagic crabs, and that did the trick. Of course, it is
  splendid to be on such a congenial errand, but I wish it wasn't with such an
  animated mummy as Maracot. He is inhuman in his isolation and his devotion to
  his work. 'The world's stiffest stiff,' says Bill Scanlan: And yet you can't
  but admire such complete devotion. Nothing exists outside his own science. I
  remember that you laughed when I asked him what I ought to read as a
  preparation, and he said that for serious study I should read the collected
  edition of his own works, but for relaxation Haeckel's Plankton-Studien.</p>

  <p>I know him no better now than I did in that little parlour looking out on
  the Oxford High. He says nothing, and his gaunt, austere face&mdash;the face
  of a Savonarola, or rather, perhaps, of a Torquemada&mdash;never relapses
  into geniality. The long, thin, aggressive nose, the two small gleaming grey
  eyes set closely together under a thatch of eyebrows, the thin-lipped,
  compressed mouth, the cheeks worn into hollows by constant thought and
  ascetic life, are all uncompanionable. He lives on some mental mountaintop,
  out of reach of ordinary mortals. Sometimes I think he is a little mad. For
  example, this extraordinary instrument that he has made ... but I'll tell
  things in their due order and then you can judge for yourself.</p>

  <p>I'll take our voyage from the start. The <i>Stratford</i> is a fine
  seaworthy little boat, specially fitted for her job. She is twelve hundred
  tons, with clear decks and a good broad beam, furnished with every possible
  appliance for sounding, trawling, dredging and tow-netting. She has, of
  course, powerful steam winches for hauling the trawls, and a number of other
  gadgets of various kinds, some of which are familiar enough, and some are
  strange. Below these are comfortable quarters with a well&mdash;fitted
  laboratory for our special studies.</p>

  <p>We had the reputation of being a mystery ship before we started, and I
  soon found that it was not undeserved. Our first proceedings were commonplace
  enough. We took a turn up the North Sea and dropped our trawls for a scrape
  or two, but, as the average depth is not much over sixty feet and we were
  specially fitted for very deep-sea work, it seemed rather a waste of time.
  Anyhow, save for familiar table fish, dog-fish, squids, jelly-fish and some
  terrigenous bottom deposits of the usual alluvial clay-mud, we got nothing
  worth writing home about. Then we rounded Scotland, sighted the Faroes, and
  came down the Wyville-Thomson Ridge, where we had better luck. Thence we
  worked south to our proper cruising-ground, which was between the African
  coast and these islands. We nearly grounded on Fuert-Eventura one moonless
  night, but save for that our voyage was uneventful.</p>

  <p>During these first weeks I tried to make friends with Maracot, but it was
  not easy work. First of all, he is the most absorbed and absent-minded man in
  the world. You will remember how you smiled when he gave the elevator boy a
  penny under the impression that he was in a street car. Half the time he is
  utterly lost in his thoughts, and seems hardly aware of where he is or what
  he is doing. Then in the second place he is secretive to the last degree. He
  is continually working at papers and charts, which he shuffles away when I
  happen to enter the cabin. It is my firm belief that the man has some secret
  project in his mind, but that so long as we are due to touch at any port he
  will keep it to himself. That is the impression which I have received, and I
  find that Bill Scanlan is of the same opinion.</p>

  <p>'Say, Mr. Headley,' said he one evening, when I was seated in the
  laboratory testing out the salinity of samples from our hydrographic
  soundings, 'what d'you figure out that this guy has in his mind? What d'you
  reckon that he means to do?'</p>

  <p>'I suppose,' said I, 'that we shall do what the Challenger and a dozen
  other exploring ships have done before us, and add a few more species to the
  list of fish and a few more entries to the bathymetric chart.'</p>

  <p>'Not on your life,' said he. 'If that's your opinion you've got to guess
  again. First of all, what am I here for, anyhow?'</p>

  <p>'In case the machinery goes wrong,' I hazarded.</p>

  <p>'Machinery nothing! The ship's machinery is in charge of MacLaren, the
  Scotch engineer. No, sir, it wasn't to run a donkey-engine that the Merribank
  folk sent out their star performer. If I pull down fifty bucks a week it's
  not for nix. Come here, and I'll make you wise to it..'</p>

  <p>He took a key from his pocket and opened a door at the back of the
  laboratory which led us down a companion ladder to a section of the hold
  which was cleared right across save for four large glittering objects
  half-exposed amid the straw of their huge packing-cases. They were flat
  sheets of steel with elaborate bolts and rivets along the edges. Each sheet
  was about ten feet square and an inch and a half thick, with a circular gap
  of eighteen inches in the middle.</p>

  <p>'What in thunder is it?' I asked.</p>

  <p>Bill Scanlan's queer face&mdash;he looks half-way between a vaudeville
  comic and a prize-fighter&mdash;broke into a grin at my astonishment.</p>

  <p>'That's my baby, sir,' he quoted. 'Yes, Mr. Headley, that's what I am here
  for. There is a steel bottom to the thing. It's in that big case yonder. Then
  there is a top, kind of arched, and a great ring for a chain or rope. Now,
  look here at the bottom of the ship.'</p>

  <p>There was a square wooden platform there, with projecting screws at each
  corner which showed that it was detachable.</p>

  <p>'There is a double bottom,' said Scanlan. 'It may be that this guy is
  clean loco, or it may be that he has more in his block than we know, but if I
  read him right he means to build up a kind of room&mdash;the windows are in
  storage here&mdash;and lower it through the bottom of the ship. He's got
  electric searchlights here, and I allow that he plans to shine 'em through
  the round portholes and see what's goin' on around.'</p>

  <p>'He could have put a crystal sheet into the ship, like the Catalina Island
  boats, if that was all that was in his mind,' said I.</p>

  <p>'You've said a mouthful,' said Bill Scanlan, scratching his head. 'I can't
  figger it out nohow. The only one sure thing is, that I've been sent to be
  under his orders and to help him with the darn fool thing all I can. He has
  said nothin' up to now, so I've said the same, but I'll just snoop around,
  and if I wait long enough I'll learn all there is to know.'</p>

  <p>So that was how I first got on to the edge of our mystery. We ran into
  some dirty weather after that, and then we got to work doing some deep-sea
  trawling north-west of Cape Juba, just outside the Continental Slope, and
  taking temperature readings and salinity records. It's a sporting
  proposition, this deep-sea dragging with a Peterson otter trawl gaping twenty
  feet wide for everything that comes its way&mdash;sometimes down a quarter of
  a mile and bringing up one lot of fish, sometimes half a mile and quite a
  different lot, every stratum of ocean with its own inhabitants as separate as
  so many continents. Sometimes from the bottom we would just bring up half a
  ton of clear pink jelly, the raw material of life, or, maybe, it would be a
  scoop of pteropod ooze, breaking up under the microscope into millions of
  tiny round reticulated balls with amorphous mud between. I won't bore you
  with all the brotulids and macrurids, the ascidians and holothurians and
  polyzoa and echinoderms&mdash;anyhow, you can reckon that there is a great
  harvest in the sea, and that we have been diligent reapers. But always I had
  the same feeling that the heart of Maracot was not in the job, and that other
  plans were in that queer high, narrow Egyptian mummy of a head. It all seemed
  to me to be a try- out of men and things until the real business got
  going.</p>

  <p>I had got as far as this in my letter when I went ashore to have a last
  stretch, for we sail in the early morning. It's as well, perhaps, that I did
  go, for there was no end of a barney going on upon the pier, with Maracot and
  Bill Scanlan right in the heart of it. Bill is a bit of a scrapper, and has
  what he calls a mean wallop in both mitts, but with half a dozen Dagoes with
  knives all round them things looked ugly, and it was time that I butted in.
  It seems that the Doctor had hired one of the things they call cabs, and had
  driven half over the island inspecting the geology, but had clean forgotten
  that he had no money on him. When it came to paying, he could not make these
  country hicks understand, and the cabman had grabbed his watch so as to make
  sure. That brought Bill Scanlan into action, and they would have both been on
  the floor with their backs like pin-cushions if I had not squared the matter
  up, with a dollar or two over for the driver and a five-dollar bonus for the
  chap with the mouse under his eye. So all ended well, and Maracot was more
  human than ever I saw him yet. When we got to the ship he called me into the
  little cabin which he reserves for himself and he thanked me.</p>

  <p>'By the way, Mr. Headley,' he said, 'I understand that you are not a
  married man?'</p>

  <p>'No,' said I, 'I am not.'</p>

  <p>'No one depending upon you?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'Good!' said he. 'I have not spoken of the object of this voyage because I
  have, for my own reasons, desired it to be secret. One of those reasons was
  that I feared to be forestalled. When scientific plans get about one may be
  served as Scott was served by Amundsen. Had Scott kept his counsel as I have
  done, it would be he and not Amundsen who would have been the first at the
  South Pole. For my part, I have quite as important a destination as the South
  Pole, and so I have been silent. But now we are on the eve of our great
  adventure and no rival has time to steal my plans. Tomorrow we start for our
  real goal.'</p>

  <p>'And what is that?' I asked.</p>

  <p>He leaned forward, his ascetic face all lit up with the enthusiasm of the
  fanatic.</p>

  <p>'Our goal,' said he, 'is the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.'</p>

  <p>And right here I ought to stop, for I expect it has taken away your breath
  as it did mine. If I were a story-writer, I guess I should leave it at that.
  But as I am just a chronicler of what occurred, I may tell you that I stayed
  another hour in the cabin of old man Maracot, and that I learned a lot, which
  there is still just time for me to tell you before the last shore boat
  leaves.</p>

  <p>'Yes, young man,' said he, 'you may write freely now, for by the time your
  letter reaches England we shall have made the plunge.'</p>

  <p>This started him sniggering, for he has a queer dry sense of humour of his
  own.</p>

  <p>'Yes, sir, the plunge is the right word on this occasion, a plunge which
  will be historic in the annals of Science. Let me tell you, in the first
  place, that I am well convinced that the current doctrine as to the extreme
  pressure of the ocean at great depths is entirely misleading. It is perfectly
  clear that other factors exist which neutralize the effect, though I am not
  yet prepared to say what those factors may be. That is one of the problems
  which we may settle. Now, what pressure, may I ask, have you been led to
  expect under a mile of water?' He glowered at me through his big horn
  spectacles.</p>

  <p>'Not less than a ton to the square inch,' I answered. 'Surely that has
  been clearly shown.'</p>

  <p>'The task of the pioneer has always been to disprove the thing which has
  been clearly shown. Use your brains, young man. You have been for the last
  month fishing up some of the most delicate Bathic forms of life, creatures so
  delicate that you could hardly transfer them from the net to the tank without
  marring their sensitive shapes. Did you find that there was evidence upon
  them of this extreme pressure?'</p>

  <p>'The pressure,' said I, 'equalized itself. It was the same within as
  without.'</p>

  <p>'Words&mdash;mere words!' he cried, shaking his lean head impatiently.
  'You have brought up round fish, such fish as Gastro-stomus globulus. Would
  they not have been squeezed flat had the pressure been as you imagine? Or
  look at our otter-boards. They are not squeezed together at the mouth of the
  trawl.'</p>

  <p>'But the experience of divers?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly it holds good up to a point. They do find a sufficient increase
  of pressure to influence what is perhaps the most sensitive organ of the
  body, the interior of the ear. But as I plan it, we shall not be exposed to
  any pressure at all. We shall be lowered in a steel cage with crystal windows
  on each side for observation. If the pressure is not strong enough to break
  in an inch and a half of toughened double-nickelled steel, then it cannot
  hurt us. It is an extension of the experiment of the Williamson Brothers at
  Nassau, with which no doubt you are familiar. If my calculation is wrong
  &mdash;well, you say that no one is dependent upon you. We shall die in a
  great adventure. Of course, if you would rather stand clear, I can go
  alone.'</p>

  <p>It seemed to me the maddest kind of scheme, and yet you know how difficult
  it is to refuse a dare. I played for time while I thought it over.</p>

  <p>'How deep do you propose to go, sir?' I asked.</p>

  <p>He had a chart pinned upon the table, and he placed the end of his
  compasses upon a point which lies to the south-west of the Canaries.</p>

  <p>'Last year I did some sounding in this part,' said he.</p>

  <p>'There is a pit of great depth. We got twenty-five thousand feet there. I
  was the first to report it. Indeed, I trust that you will find it on the
  charts of the future as the "Maracot Deep".'</p>

  <p>'But, good God, sir!' I cried, 'you don't propose to descend into an abyss
  like that?'</p>

  <p>'No, no,' he answered, smiling. 'Neither our lowering chain nor our air
  tubes reach beyond half a mile. But I was going to explain to you that round
  this deep crevasse, which has no doubt been formed by volcanic forces long
  ago, there is a varied ridge or narrow plateau, which is not more than three
  hundred fathoms under the surface.'</p>

  <p>'Three hundred fathoms! A third of a mile!'</p>

  <p>'Yes, roughly a third of a mile. It is my present intention that we shall
  be lowered in our little pressure-proof look-out station on to this submarine
  bank. There we shall make such observations as we can. A speaking-tube will
  connect us with the ship so that we can give our directions. There should be
  no difficulty in the mater. When we wish to be hauled up we have only to say
  so.'</p>

  <p>'And the air?'</p>

  <p>'Will be pumped down to us.'</p>

  <p>'But it will be pitch-dark.'</p>

  <p>'That, I fear, is undoubtedly true. The experiments of Fol and Sarasin at
  the Lake of Geneva show that even the ultra-violet rays are absent at that
  depth. But does it matter? We shall be provided with the powerful electric
  illumination from the ship's engines, supplemented by six two-volt Hellesens
  dry cells connected together so as to give a current of twelve volts. That,
  with a Lucas army signalling lamp as a movable reflector, should serve our
  turn. Any other difficulties?'</p>

  <p>'If our air lines tangle?'</p>

  <p>'They won't tangle. And as a reserve we have compressed air in tubes which
  would last us twenty&mdash;four hours. Well, have I satisfied you? Will you
  come?'</p>

  <p>It was not an easy decision. The brain works quickly and imagination is a
  mighty vivid thing. I seemed to realize that black box down in the primeval
  depths, to feel the foul twice-breathed air, and then to see the walls
  sagging, bulging inwards, rending at the joints with the water spouting in at
  every rivet-hole and crevice and crawling up from below. It was a slow,
  dreadful death to die. But I looked up, and there were the old man's fiery
  eyes fixed upon me with the exaltation of a martyr to Science. It's catching,
  that sort of enthusiasm, and if it be crazy, it is at least noble and
  unselfish. I caught fire from his great flame, and I sprang to my feet with
  my hand out.</p>

  <p>'Doctor, I'm with you to the end,' said I.</p>

  <p>'I knew it,' said he. 'It was not for your smattering of learning that I
  picked you, my young friend, nor,' he added, smiling, 'for your intimate
  acquaintance with the pelagic crabs. There are other qualities which may be
  more immediately useful, and they are loyalty and courage.'</p>

  <p>So with that little bit of sugar I was dismissed, with my future pledged
  and my whole scheme of life in ruins. Well, the last shore boat is leaving.
  They are calling for the mail. You will either not hear from me again, my
  dear Talbot, or you will get a letter worth reading. If you don't hear you
  can have a floating headstone and drop it somewhere south of the Canaries
  with the inscription :</p>

  <p>'Here, or Hereabouts, lies all that the fishes have left of my friend,
  CYRUS J. HEADLEY.'</p>

  <p>The second document in the case is the unintelligible wireless message
  which was intercepted by several vessels, including the Royal Mail steamer
  Arroya. It was received at 3 p.m. October 3rd, 1926, which shows that it was
  dispatched only two days after the <i>Stratford</i> left the Grand Canary, as
  shown in the previous letter, and it corresponds roughly with the time when
  the Norwegian barque saw a steamer founder in a cyclone two hundred miles to
  the south-west of Porta de la Luz. It ran thus :</p>

  <p>Blown on our beam ends. Fear position hopeless. Have already lost Maracot,
  Headley, Scanlan. Situation incomprehensible. Headley handkerchief end of
  deep sea sounding wire. God help us! S. S. <i>Stratford</i></p>

  <p>This was the last, incoherent message which came from the ill-fated
  vessel, and part of it was so strange that it was put down to delirium on the
  part of the operator. It seemed, however, to leave no doubt as to the fate of
  the ship.</p>

  <p>The explanation&mdash;if it can be accepted as an explanation&mdash;of the
  matter is to be found in the narrative concealed inside the vitreous ball,
  and first it would be as well to amplify the very brief account which has
  hitherto appeared in the Press of the finding of the ball. I take it verbatim
  from the log of the Arabella Knowles, master Amos Green, outward bound with
  coals from Cardiff to Buenos Aires :</p>

  <p>'Wednesday, Jan. 5th, 1927. Lat. 27.14, Long. 28 West. Calm weather. Blue
  sky with low banks of cirrus clouds. Sea like glass. At two bells of the
  middle watch the first officer reported that he had seen a shining object
  bound high out of the sea, and then fall back into it. His first impression
  was that it was some strange fish, but on examination with his glasses he
  observed that it was a silvery globe, or ball, which was so light that it
  lay, rather than floated, on the surface of the water. I was called and saw
  it, as large as a football, gleaming brightly about half a mile off on our
  starboard beam. I stopped the engines and called away the quarter-boat under
  the second mate, who picked the thing up and brought it aboard.</p>

  <p>'On examination it proved to be a ball made of some sort of very tough
  glass, and filled with a substance so light that when it was tossed in the
  air it wavered about like a child's balloon. It was nearly transparent, and
  we could see what looked like a roll of paper inside it. The material was so
  tough, however, that we had the greatest possible difficulty in breaking the
  ball open and getting at the contents. A hammer would not crack it, and it
  was only when the chief engineer nipped it in the throw of the engine that we
  were able to smash it. Then I am sorry to say that it dissolved into
  sparkling dust, so that it was impossible to collect any good-sized piece for
  examination. We got the paper, however, and, having examined it and concluded
  that it was of great importance, we laid it aside with the intention of
  handing it over to the British Consul when we reached the Plate River. Man
  and boy, I have been at sea for five-and-thirty years, but this is the
  strangest thing that ever befell me, and so says every man aboard this ship.
  I leave the meaning of it all to wiser heads than mine.'</p>

  <p>So much for the genesis of the narrative of Cyrus J. Headley, which we
  will now give exactly as written :</p>

  <p>Whom am I writing to? Well, I suppose I may say to the whole wide world,
  but as that is rather a vague address I'll aim at my friend Sir James Talbot,
  of Oxford University, for the reason that my last letter was to him and this
  may be regarded as a continuation. I expect the odds are a hundred to one
  that this ball, even if it should see the light of day and not be gulped by a
  shark in passing, will toss about on the waves and never catch the eye of the
  passing sailor, and yet it's worth trying, and Maracot is sending up another,
  so, between us, it may be that we shall get our wonderful story to the world.
  Whether the world will believe it is another matter, I guess, but when folk
  look at the ball with its vitrine cover and note its contents of levigen gas,
  they will surely see for themselves that there is something here that is out
  of the ordinary. You at any rate, Talbot, will not throw it aside unread.</p>

  <p>If anyone wants to know how the thing began, and what we were trying to
  do, he can find it all in a letter I wrote you on October 1st last year, the
  night before we left Porta de la Luz. By George! If I had known what was in
  store for us, I think I should have sneaked into a shore boat that night. And
  yet&mdash;well, maybe, even with my eyes open I would have stood by the
  Doctor and seen it through. On second thoughts I have not a doubt that I
  would.</p>

  <p>Well, starting from the day that we left Grand Canary I will carry on with
  my experiences.</p>

  <p>The moment we were clear, of the port, old man Maracot fairly broke into
  flames. The time for action had come at last and all the damped-down energy
  of the man came flaring up. I tell you he took hold of that ship and of
  everyone and everything in it, and bent it all to his will. The dry,
  creaking, absent- minded scholar had suddenly vanished, and instead there
  emerged a human electrical machine, crackling with vitality and quivering
  from the great driving force within. His eyes gleamed behind his glasses like
  flames in a lantern. He seemed to be everywhere at once, working out
  distances on his chart, comparing reckonings with the skipper, driving Bill
  Scanlan along, setting me on to a hundred odd jobs, but it was all full of
  method and with a definite end. He developed an unexpected knowledge of
  electricity and of mechanics and spent much of his time working at the
  machinery which Scanlan, under his supervision, was now carefully piecing
  together.</p>

  <p>'Say, Mr. Headley, it's just dandy,' said Bill, on the morning of the
  second day. 'Come in here and have a look. The Doc. is a regular fellow and a
  whale of a slick mechanic.'</p>

  <p>I had a most unpleasant impression that it was my own coffin at which I
  was gazing, but, even so, I had to admit that it was a very adequate
  mausoleum. The floor had been clamped to the four steel walls, and the
  porthole windows screwed into the centre of each. A small trapdoor at the top
  gave admission, and there was a second one at the base. The steel cage was
  supported by a thin but very powerful steel hawser, which ran over a drum,
  and was paid out or rolled in by the strong engine which we used for our
  deep-sea trawls. The hawser, as I understood, was nearly half a mile in
  length, the slack of it coiled round bollards on the deck. The rubber
  breathing-tubes were of the same length, and the telephone wire was connected
  with them, and also the wire by which the electric lights within could be
  operated from the ship's batteries, though we had an independent instalment
  as well.</p>

  <p>It was on the evening of that day that the engines were stopped. The glass
  was low, and a thick black cloud rising upon the horizon gave warning of
  coming trouble. The only ship in sight was a barque flying the Norwegian
  colours, and we observed that it was reefed down, as if expecting trouble.
  For the moment, however, all was propitious and the <i>Stratford</i> rolled
  gently upon a deep blue ocean, white-capped here and there from the breath of
  the trade wind. Bill Scanlan came to me in my laboratory with more show of
  excitement than his easy-going temperament had ever permitted him to
  show.</p>

  <p>'Look it here, Mr. Headley,' said he, 'they've lowered that contraption
  into a well in the bottom of the ship. D'you figure that the Boss is going
  down in it?'</p>

  <p>'Certain sure, Bill. And I am going with him.'</p>

  <p>'Well, well, you are sure bughouse, the two of you, to think of such a
  thing. But I'd feel a cheap skate if I let you go alone.'</p>

  <p>'It is no business of yours, Bill.!</p>

  <p>'Well, I just feel that it is. Sure, I'd be as yellow as a Chink with the
  jaundice if I let you go alone. Merribanks sent me here to look after the
  machinery, and if the machinery is down at the bottom of the sea, then it's a
  sure thing that it's me for the bottom. Where those steel castings are
  &mdash;that's the address of Bill Scanlan&mdash;whether the folk round him
  are crazy or no.'</p>

  <p>It was useless to argue with him, so one more was added to our little
  suicide club and we just waited for our orders.</p>

  <p>All night they were hard at work upon the fittings, and it was after an
  early breakfast that we descended into the hold ready for our adventure. The
  steel cage had been half lowered into the false bottom, and we now descended
  one by one through the upper trap-door, which was closed and screwed down
  behind us, Captain Howie with a most lugubrious face having shaken hands with
  each of us as we passed him. We were then lowered a few more feet, the
  shutter drawn above our heads, and the water admitted to test how far we were
  really seaworthy. The cage stood the trial well, every joint fitted exactly,
  and there was no sign of any leakage. Then the lower flap in the hold was
  loosened and we hung suspended in the ocean beneath the level of the
  keel.</p>

  <p>It was really a very snug little room, and I marvelled at the skill and
  foresight with which everything had been arranged. The electric illumination
  had not been turned on, but the semi&mdash;tropical sun shone brightly
  through the bottle-green water at either porthole. Some small fish were
  flickering here and there, streaks of silver against the green background.
  Inside there was a settee round the little room, with a bathymetric dial, a
  thermometer, and other instruments ranged above it. Beneath the settee was a
  row of pipes which represented our reserve supply of compressed air in case
  the tubes should fail us. Those tubes opened out above our heads, and the
  telephonic apparatus hung beside them. We could all hear the mournful voice
  of the captain outside.</p>

  <p>'Are you really determined to go?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'We are quite all right,' the Doctor answered, impatiently. 'You will
  lower slowly and have someone at the receiver all the time. I will report
  conditions. When we reach the bottom, remain as you are until I give
  instructions. It will not do to put too much strain upon the hawser, but a
  slow movement of a couple of knots an hour should be well within its
  strength. And now "Lower away!" '</p>

  <p>He yelled out the two words with the scream of a lunatic. It was the
  supreme moment of his life, the fruition of all his brooding dreams. For an
  instant I was shaken by the thought that we were really in the power of a
  cunning, plausible monomaniac. Bill Scanlan had the same thought, for he
  looked across at me with a rueful grin and touched his forehead. But after
  that one wild outburst our leader was instantly his sober, self-contained
  self once more. Indeed, one had but to look at the order and forethought
  which showed itself in every detail around us to be reassured as to the power
  of his mind.</p>

  <p>But now all our attention was diverted to the wonderful new experience
  which every instant was providing. Slowly the cage was sinking into the
  depths of the ocean. Light green water turned to dark olive. That again
  deepened into a wonderful blue, a rich deep blue gradually thickening to a
  dusky purple. Lower and lower we sank&mdash;a hundred feet, two hundred feet,
  three hundred. The valves were acting to perfection. Our breathing was as
  free and natural as upon the deck of the vessel. Slowly the bathymeter needle
  moved round the luminous dial. Four hundred, five hundred, six hundred. 'How
  are you?' roared an anxious voice from above us.</p>

  <p>'Nothing could be better,' cried Maracot in reply. But the light was
  failing. There was now only a dim grey twilight which rapidly changed to
  utter darkness. 'Stop her!' shouted our leader. We ceased to move and hung
  suspended at seven hundred feet below the surface of the ocean. I heard the
  click of the switch, and the next instant we were flooded with glorious
  golden light which poured out through each of our side windows and sent long
  glimmering vistas into the waste of waters round us. With our faces against
  the thick glass, each at our own porthole, we gazed out into such a prospect
  as man had never seen.</p>

  <p>Up to now we had known these strata by the sight of the few fish which had
  been too slow to avoid our clumsy trawl, or too stupid to escape a drag- net.
  Now we saw the wonderful world of water as it really was. If the object of
  creation was the production of man, it is strange that the ocean is so much
  more populous than the land. Broadway on a Saturday night, Lombard Street on
  a week-day afternoon, are not more crowded than the great sea spaces which
  lay before us. We had passed those surface strata where fish are either
  colourless or of the true maritime tints of ultramarine above and silver
  below. Here there were creatures of every conceivable tint and form which
  pelagic life can show. Delicate leptocephali or eel larva shot like streaks
  of burnished silver across the tunnel of radiance. The slow snake-like form
  of muroena, the deepsea lamprey, writhed and twisted by, or the black
  ceratia, all spikes and mouth, gaped foolishly back at our peering faces.
  Sometimes it was the squat cuttlefish which drifted across and glanced at us
  with human sinister eyes, sometimes it was some crystal-clear pelagic form of
  life, cystoma or glaucus, which lent a flower&mdash;like charm to the scene.
  One huge caranx, or horse mackerel, butted savagely again and again against
  our window until the dark shadow of a seven-foot shark came across him, and
  he vanished into its gaping jaws. Dr. Maracot sat entranced, his notebook
  upon his knee, scribbling down his observations and keeping up a muttered
  monologue of scientific comment. 'What's that? What's that?' I would hear.
  'Yes, yes, chimoera mirabilis as taken by the Michael Sars. Dear me, there is
  lepidion, but a new species as I should judge. Observe that macrurus, Mr.
  Headley; its colouring is quite different to what we get in the net.' Once
  only was he taken quite aback. It was when a long oval object shot with great
  speed past his window from above, and left a vibrating tail behind it which
  extended as far as we could see above us and below. I admit that I was as
  puzzled for the moment as the Doctor, and it was Bill Scanlan who solved the
  mystery.</p>

  <p>'I guess that boob, John Sweeney, has heaved his lead alongside of us.
  Kind of a joke, maybe, to prevent us from feeling lonesome.'</p>

  <p>'To be sure! To be sure!' said Maracot, sniggering. 'Plumbus longicaudatus
  &mdash;a new genus, Mr. Headley, with a piano-wire tail and lead in its nose.
  But, indeed, it is very necessary they should take soundings so as to keep
  above the bank, which is circumscribed in size. All well, Captain!' he
  shouted. 'You may drop us down.'</p>

  <p>And down we went. Dr. Maracot turned off the electric light and all was
  pitch-darkness once more save for the bathymeter's luminous face, which
  ticked off our steady fall. There was a gentle sway, but otherwise we were
  hardly conscious of any motion. Only that moving hand upon the dial told us
  of our terrific, our inconceivable, position. Now we were at the
  thousand-foot level, and the air had become distinctly foul. Scanlan oiled
  the valve of the discharge tube and things were better. At fifteen hundred
  feet we stopped and swung in mid-ocean with our lights blazing once more.
  Some great dark mass passed us here, but whether swordfish or deep-sea shark,
  or monster of unknown breed, was more than we could determine. The Doctor
  hurriedly turned off the lights. 'There lies our chief danger,' said he;
  'there are creatures in the deep before whose charge this steel-plated room
  would have as much chance as a beehive before the rush of a rhinoceros.'</p>

  <p>'Whales, maybe,' said Scanlan.</p>

  <p>'Whales may sound to a great depth,' the savant answered. 'A Greenland
  whale has been known to take out nearly a mile of line in a perpendicular
  dive. But unless hurt or badly frightened no whale would descend so low. It
  may have been a giant squid: They are found at every level.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I guess squids are too soft to hurt us. The laugh would be with the
  squid if he could claw a hole in Merribanks' nickel steel.'</p>

  <p>'Their bodies may be soft,' the Professor answered, 'but the beak of a
  large squid would sheer through a bar of iron, and one peck of that beak
  might go through these inch-thick windows as if they were parchment.'</p>

  <p>'Gee Whittaker!' cried Bill, as we resumed our downward journey.</p>

  <p>And then at last, quite softly and gently, we came to rest. So delicate
  was the impact that we should hardly have known of it had it not been that
  the light when turned on showed great coils of the hawser all around us. The
  wire was a danger to our breathing tubes, for it might foul them, and at the
  urgent cry of Maracot it was pulled taut from above once more. The dial
  marked eighteen hundred feet. We lay motionless on a volcanic ridge at the
  bottom of the Atlantic.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR a time I think that we all had the same feeling. We did
  not want to do anything or to see anything. We just wanted to sit quiet and
  try to realize the wonder of it&mdash;that we should be resting in the plumb
  centre of one of the great oceans of the world. But soon the strange scene
  round us, illuminated in all directions by our lights, drew us to the
  windows.</p>

  <p>We had settled upon a bed of high algae ('Cutleria multifida,' said
  Maracot), the yellow fronds of which waved around us, moved by some deep-sea
  current, exactly as branches would move in a summer breeze. They were not
  long enough to obscure our view, though their great flat leaves, deep golden
  in the light, flowed occasionally across our vision. Beyond them lay slopes
  of some blackish slag-like material which were dotted with lovely coloured
  creatures, holothurians, ascidians, echini and echinoderms, as thickly as
  ever an English spring time bank was sprinkled with hyacinths and primroses.
  These living flowers of the sea, vivid scarlet, rich purple and delicate
  pink, were spread in profusion upon that coal-black background. Here and
  there great sponges bristled out from the crevices of the dark rocks, and a
  few fish of the middle depths, themselves showing up as flashes of colour,
  shot across our circle of vivid radiance. We were gazing enraptured at the
  fairy scene when an anxious voice came down the tube:</p>

  <p>'Well, how do you like the bottom? Is all well with you? Don't be too
  long, for the glass is dropping and I don't like the look of it. Giving you
  air enough? Anything more we can do?'</p>

  <p>'All right, Captain!' cried Maracot, cheerily. 'We won't be long. You are
  nursing us well. We are quite as comfortable as in our own cabin. Stand by
  presently to move us slowly forwards.'</p>

  <p>We had come into the region of the luminous fishes, and it amused us to
  turn out our own lights, and in the absolute pitch-darkness&mdash;a darkness
  in which a sensitive plate can be suspended for an hour without a trace even
  of the ultra-violet ray&mdash;to look out at the phosphorescent activity of
  the ocean. As against a black velvet curtain one saw little points of
  brilliant light moving steadily along as a liner at night might shed light
  through its long line of portholes. One terrifying creature had luminous
  teeth which gnashed in Biblical fashion in the outer darkness. Another had
  long golden antennae, and yet another a plume of flame above its head. As far
  as our vision carried, brilliant points flashed in the darkness, each little
  being bent upon its own business, and lighting up its own course as surely as
  the nightly taxicab at the theatre-hour in the Strand. Soon we had our own
  lights up again and the Doctor was making his observations of the
  sea-bottom.</p>

  <p>'Deep as we are, we are not deep enough to get any of the characteristic
  Bathic deposits,' said he. 'These are entirely beyond our possible range.
  Perhaps on another occasion with a longer hawser-'</p>

  <p>'Cut it out!' growled Bill. 'Forget it!'</p>

  <p>Maracot smiled. 'You will soon get acclimatized to the depths, Scanlan.
  This will not be our only descent.'</p>

  <p>'The Hell you say!' muttered Bill.</p>

  <p>'You will think no more of it than of going down into the hold of the
  <i>Stratford</i>. You will observe, Mr. Headley, that the groundwork here, so
  far as we can observe it through the dense growth of hydrozoa and silicious
  sponges, is pumicestone and the black slag of basalt, pointing to ancient
  plutonic activities. Indeed, I am inclined to think that it confirms my
  previous view that this ridge is part of a volcanic formation and that the
  Maracot Deep,' he rolled out the words as if he loved them, 'represents the
  outer slope of the mountain. It has struck me that it would be an interesting
  experiment to move our cage slowly onwards until we come to the edge of the
  Deep, and see exactly what the formation may be at that point. I should
  expect to find a precipice of majestic dimensions extending downwards at a
  sharp angle into the extreme depths of the ocean.'</p>

  <p>The experiment seemed to me to be a dangerous one, for who could say how
  far our thin hawser could bear the strain of lateral movement; but with
  Maracot danger, either to himself or to anyone else, simply did not exist
  when a scientific observation had to be made. I held my breath, and so I
  observed did Bill Scanlan, when a slow movement of our steel shell, brushing
  aside the waving fronds of seaweed, showed that the full strain was upon the
  line. It stood it nobly, however, and with a very gentle sweeping progression
  we began to glide over the bottom of the ocean, Maracot, with a compass in
  the hollow of his hand, shouting his direction as to the course to follow,
  and occasionally ordering the shell to be raised so as to avoid some obstacle
  in our path.</p>

  <p>'This basaltic ridge can hardly be more than a mile across,' he explained.
  'I had marked the abyss as being to the west of the point where we took our
  plunge. At this rate, we should certainly reach it in a very short time.'</p>

  <p>We slid without any check over the volcanic plain, all feathered by the
  waving golden algae and made beautiful by the gorgeous jewels of Nature's
  cutting, flaming out from their setting of jet. Suddenly the Doctor dashed to
  the telephone.</p>

  <p>'Stop her!' he cried. 'We are there!'</p>

  <p>A monstrous gap had opened suddenly before us. It was a fearsome place,
  the vision of a nightmare. Black shining cliffs of basalt fell sheer down
  into the unknown. Their edges were fringed with dangling laminaria as ferns
  might overhang some earthly gorge, but beneath that tossing, vibrating rim
  there were only the black gleaming walls of the chasm. The rocky edge curved
  away from us, but the abyss might be of any breadth, for our lights failed to
  penetrate the gloom which lay before us. When a Lucas signalling lamp was
  turned downwards it shot out a long golden lane of parallel beams extending
  down, down, down until it was quenched in the gloom of the terrible chasm
  beneath us.</p>

  <p>'It is indeed wonderful!' cried Maracot, gazing out with a pleased
  proprietary expression upon his thin, eager face. 'For depth I need not say
  that it has often been exceeded. There is the Challenger Deep of twenty-six
  thousand feet near the Ladrone Islands, the Planet Deep of thirty-two
  thousand feet off the Philippines, and many others, but it is probable that
  the Maracot Deep stands alone in the declivity of its descent, and is
  remarkable also for its escape from the observation of so many hydrographic
  explorers who have charted the Atlantic. It can hardly be doubted-'</p>

  <p>He had stopped in the middle of a sentence and a look of intense interest
  and surprise had frozen upon his face. Bill Scanlan and I, gazing over his
  shoulders, were petrified by that which met our startled eyes.</p>

  <p>Some great creature was coming up the tunnel of light which we had
  projected into the abyss. Far down where it tailed off into the darkness of
  the pit we could dimly see the vague black lurchings and heavings of some
  monstrous body in slow upward progression. Paddling in clumsy fashion, it was
  rising with dim flickerings to the edge of the gulf. Now, as it came nearer,
  it was right in the beam, and we could see its dreadful form more clearly. It
  was a beast unknown to Science, and yet with an analogy to much with which we
  are familiar. Too long for a huge crab and too short for a giant lobster, it
  was moulded more upon the lines of the crayfish, with two monstrous nippers
  outstretched on either side, and a pair of sixteen-foot antennae which
  quivered in front of its black dull sullen eyes. The carapace, light yellow
  in colour, may have been ten feet across, and its total length, apart from
  the antennae, must have been not less than thirty.</p>

  <p>'Wonderful!' cried Maracot, scribbling desperately in his notebook. 'Semi-
  pediculated eyes, elastic lamellae, family crustacea, species unknown.
  Crustaceus Maracoti&mdash;why not? Why not?'</p>

  <p>'By gosh, I'll pass its name, but it seems to me it's coming our way!'
  cried Bill. 'Say, Doc, what about putting our light out?'</p>

  <p>'Just one moment while I note the reticulations!' cried the naturalist.
  'Yes, yes, that will do.' He clicked off the switch and we were back in our
  inky darkness, with only the darting lights outside like meteors on a
  moonless night.</p>

  <p>'That beast is sure the world's worst,' said Bill, wiping his forehead. 'I
  felt like the morning after a bottle of Prohibition Hoosh.'</p>

  <p>'It is certainly terrible to look at,' Maracot remarked, 'and perhaps
  terrible to deal with also if we were really exposed to those monstrous
  claws. But inside our steel case we can afford to examine him in safety and
  at our ease.'</p>

  <p>He had hardly spoken when there came a rap as from a pickaxe upon our
  outer wall. Then there was a long drawn rasping and scratching, ending in
  another sharp rap.</p>

  <p><a id="pic1"
     name="pic1"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">In the Grip of the Giant Crab</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>'Say, he wants to come in!' cried Bill Scanlan in alarm. 'By gosh! we want
  "No Admission" painted on this shack.' His shaking voice showed how forced
  was his merriment, and I confess that my own knees were knocking together as
  I was aware of the stealthy monster closing up with an even blacker darkness
  each of our windows in succession, as he explored this strange shell which,
  could he but crack it, might contain his food.</p>

  <p>'He can't hurt us,' said Maracot, but there was less assurance in his
  tone. 'Maybe it would be as well to shake the brute off.' He hailed the
  Captain up the tube.</p>

  <p>'Pull us up twenty or thirty feet,' he cried.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later we rose from the lava plain and swung gently in the
  still water. But the terrible beast was pertinacious. After a very short
  interval we heard once more the raspings of his feelers and the sharp
  tappings of his claws as he felt us round. It was terrible to sit silently in
  the dark and know that death was so near. If that mighty claw fell upon the
  window, would it stand the strain? That was the unspoken question in each of
  our minds.</p>

  <p>But suddenly an unexpected and more urgent danger presented itself. The
  tappings had gone to the roof of our little dwelling, and now we began to
  sway with a rhythmic movement to and fro.</p>

  <p>'Good God!' I cried. 'It has hold of the hawser. It will surely snap
  it.'</p>

  <p>'Say, Doc, it's mine for the surface. I guess we've seen what we came to
  see, and it's home, sweet home for Bill Scanlan. Ring up the elevator and get
  her going.'</p>

  <p>'But our work is not half done,' croaked Maracot. 'We have only begun to
  explore the edges of the Deep. Let us at least see how broad it is. When we
  have reached the other side I shall be content to return.' Then up the tube:
  'All well, Captain. Move on at two knots until I call for a stop.'</p>

  <p>We moved slowly out over the edge of the abyss. Since darkness had not
  saved us from attack we now turned on our lights. One of the portholes was
  entirely obscured by what appeared to be the creature's lower stomach. Its
  head and its great nippers were at work above us, and we still swayed like a
  clanging bell. The strength of the beast must have been enormous. Were ever
  mortals placed in such a situation, with five miles of water beneath&mdash;
  and that deadly monster above? The oscillations became more and more violent.
  An excited shout came down the tube from the Captain as he became aware of
  the jerks upon the hawser, and Maracot sprang to his feet with his hands
  thrown upwards in despair. Even within the shell we were aware of the jar of
  the broken wires, and an instant later we were falling into the mighty gulf
  beneath us.</p>

  <p>As I look back at that awful moment I can remember hearing a wild cry from
  Maracot.</p>

  <p>'The hawser has parted! You can do nothing! We are all dead men!' he
  yelled, grabbing at the telephone tube, and then, 'Good-bye, Captain,
  good-bye to all.' They were our last words to the world of men.</p>

  <p>We did not fall swiftly down, as you might have imagined. In spite of our
  weight our hollow shell gave us some sustaining buoyancy, and we sank slowly
  and gently into the abyss. I heard the long scrape as we slid through the
  claws of the horrible creature who had been our ruin, and then with a smooth
  gyration we went circling downwards into the abysmal depths. It may have been
  fully five minutes, and it seemed like an hour, before we reached the limit
  of our telephone wire and snapped it like a thread. Our air tube broke off at
  almost the same moment and the salt water came spouting through the vents.
  With quick, deft hands Bill Scanlan tied cords round each of the rubber tubes
  and so stopped the inrush, while the Doctor released the top of our
  compressed air which came hissing forth from the tubes. The lights had gone
  out when the wire snapped, but even in the dark the Doctor was able to
  connect up the Hellesens dry cells which lit a number of lamps in the
  roof.</p>

  <p>'It should last us a week,' he said, with a wry smile. 'We shall at least
  have light to die in.' Then he shook his head sadly and a kindly smile came
  over his gaunt features. 'It is all right for me. I am an old man and have
  done my work in the world. My one regret is that I should have allowed you
  two young fellows to come with me. I should have taken the risk alone.'</p>

  <p>I simply shook his hand in reassurance, for indeed there was nothing I
  could say. Bill Scanlan, too, was silent. Slowly we sank, marking our pace by
  the dark fish shadows which flitted past our windows. It seemed as if they
  were flying upwards rather than that we were sinking down. We still
  oscillated, and there was nothing so far as I could see to prevent us from
  falling on our side, or even turning upside down. Our weight, however, was,
  fortunately, very evenly balanced and we kept a level floor. Glancing up at
  the bathymeter I saw that we had already reached the depth of a mile.</p>

  <p>'You see, it is as I said,' remarked Maracot, with some complacency. 'You
  may have seen my paper in the Proceedings of the Oceanographical Society upon
  the relation of pressure and depth. I wish I could get one word back to the
  world, if only to confute Bulow of Giessen, who ventured to contradict
  me.'</p>

  <p>'My gosh! If I could get a word back to the world I wouldn't waste it on a
  square-head highbrow,' said the mechanic. 'There is a little wren in
  Philadelphia that will have tears in her pretty eyes when she hears that Bill
  Scanlan has passed out. Well, it sure does seem a darned queer way of doing
  it, anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'You should never have come,' I said, putting my hand on his.</p>

  <p>'What sort of tin-horn sport should I have been if I had quitted?' he
  answered. 'No, it's my job, and I am glad I stuck it.'</p>

  <p>'How long have we?' I asked the Doctor, after a pause.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>'We shall have time to see the real bottom of the ocean, anyhow,' said he.
  'There is air enough in our tubes for the best part of a day. Our trouble is
  with the waste products. That is what is going to choke us. If we could get
  rid of our carbon dioxide-'</p>

  <p>'That I can see is impossible.'</p>

  <p>'There is one tube of pure oxygen. I put it in in case of accidents. A
  little of that from time to time will help to keep us alive. You will observe
  that we are now more than two miles deep.'</p>

  <p>'Why should we try to keep ourselves alive? The sooner it is over the
  better,' said I.</p>

  <p>'That's the dope,' cried Scanlan. 'Cut loose and have done with it.' .</p>

  <p>'And miss the most wonderful sight that man's eye has ever seen!' said
  Maracot. 'It would be treason to Science. Let us record facts to the end,
  even if they should be for ever buried with our bodies. Play the game
  out.'</p>

  <p>'Some sport, the Doc!' cried Scanlan. 'I guess he has the best guts of the
  bunch. Let us see the spiel to an end.'</p>

  <p>We sat patiently on the settee, the three of us, gripping the edges of it
  with strained fingers as it swayed and rocked, while the fishes still flashed
  swiftly upwards athwart the portholes.</p>

  <p>'It is now three miles,' remarked Maracot. 'I will turn on the oxygen, Mr.
  Headley, for it is certainly very close. There is one thing,' he added, with
  his dry, cackling laugh, 'it will certainly be the Maracot Deep from this
  time onwards. When Captain Howie takes back the news my colleagues will see
  to it that my grave is also my monument. Even Bulow of Giessen-' He babbled
  on about some unintelligible scientific grievance.</p>

  <p>We sat in silence again, watching the needle as it crawled on to its
  fourth mile. At one point we struck something heavy, which shook us so
  violently that I feared that we would turn upon our side. It may have been a
  huge fish, or conceivably we may have bumped upon some projection of the
  cliff over the edge of which we had been precipitated. That edge had seemed
  to us at the time to be such a wondrous depth, and now looking back at it
  from our dreadful abyss it might almost have been the surface. Still we
  swirled and circled lower and lower through the dark green waste of waters.
  Twenty-five thousand feet now was registered upon the dial.</p>

  <p>'We are nearly at our journey's end,' said Maracot. 'My Scott's recorder
  gave me twenty-six thousand seven hundred last year at the deepest point. We
  shall know our fate within a few minutes. It may be that the shock will crush
  us. It may be&mdash;'</p>

  <p>And at that moment we landed.</p>

  <p>There was never a babe lowered by its mother on to a feather-bed who
  nestled down more gently than we on to the extreme bottom of the Atlantic
  Ocean. The soft thick elastic ooze upon which we lit was a perfect buffer,
  which saved us from the slightest jar. We hardly moved upon our seats, and it
  is as well that we did not, for we had perched upon some sort of a projecting
  hummock, clothed thickly with the viscous gelatinous mud, and there we were
  balanced rocking gently with nearly half our base projecting and unsupported.
  There was a danger that we would tip over on our side, but finally we
  steadied down and remained motionless. As we did so Dr. Maracot, staring out
  through his porthole, gave a cry of surprise and hurriedly turned out our
  electric light.</p>

  <p>To our amazement we could still see clearly. There was a dim, misty light
  outside which streamed through our porthole, like the cold radiance of a
  winter morning. We looked out at the strange scene, and with no help from our
  own lights we could see clearly for some hundred yards in each direction. It
  was impossible, inconceivable, but none the less the evidence of our senses
  told us that it was a fact. The great ocean floor is luminous.</p>

  <p>'Why not?' cried Maracot, when we had stood for a minute or two in silent
  wonder. 'Should I not have foreseen it? What is this pteropod or globigerina
  ooze? Is it not the product of decay, the mouldering bodies of a billion
  billion organic creatures? And is decay not associated with phosphorescent
  luminosity? Where, in all creation, would it be seen if it were not here? Ah!
  It is indeed hard that we should have such a demonstration and be unable to
  send our knowledge back to the world.'</p>

  <p>'And yet,' I remarked, 'we have scooped half a ton of radiolarian jelly at
  a time and detected no such radiance.'</p>

  <p>'It would lose it, doubtless, in its long journey to the surface. And what
  is half a ton compared to these far-stretching plains of slow putrescence?
  And see, see,' he cried in uncontrollable excitement, 'the deep-sea creatures
  graze upon this organic carpet even as our herds on land graze upon the
  meadows!'</p>

  <p>As he spoke a flock of big black fish, heavy and squat, came slowly over
  the ocean bed towards us, nuzzling among the spongy growths and nibbling away
  as they advanced. Another huge red creature, like a foolish cow of the ocean,
  was chewing the cud in front of my porthole, and others were grazing here and
  there, raising their heads from, time to time to gaze at this strange object
  which had so suddenly appeared among them.</p>

  <p>I could only marvel at Maracot, who in that foul atmosphere, seated under
  the very shadow of death, still obeyed the call of Science and scribbled his
  observations in his notebook. Without following his precise methods, I none
  the less made my own mental notes, which will remain for ever as a picture
  stamped upon my brain. The lowest plains of ocean consist of red clay, but
  here it was overlaid by the grey bathybian slime which formed an undulating
  plain as far as our eyes could reach. This plain was not smooth, but was
  broken by numerous strange rounded hillocks like that upon which we had
  perched, all glimmering in the spectral light. Between these little hills
  there darted great clouds of strange fish, many of them quite unknown to
  Science, exhibiting every shade of colour, but black and red predominating.
  Maracot watched them with suppressed excitement and chronicled them in his
  notes.</p>

  <p>The air had become very foul, and again we were only able to save
  ourselves by a fresh emission of oxygen. Curiously enough, we were all hungry
  &mdash;I should rather say ravenous&mdash;and we fell upon the potted beef
  with bread and butter, washed down by whisky and water, which the foresight
  of Maracot had provided. With my perceptions stimulated by this refreshment,
  I was seated at my lookout portal and longing for a last cigarette, when my
  eyes caught something which sent a whirl of strange thoughts and
  anticipations through my mind.</p>

  <p>I have said that the undulating grey plain on every side of us was studded
  with what seemed like hummocks. A particularly large one was in front of my
  porthole, and I looked out at it within a range of thirty feet. There was
  some peculiar mark upon the side of it, and as I glanced along I saw to my
  surprise that this mark was repeated again and again until it was lost round
  the curve. When one is so near death it takes much to give one a thrill about
  anything connected with this world, but my breath failed me for a moment and
  my heart stood still as I suddenly realized that it was a frieze at which I
  was looking and that, barnacled and worn as it was, the hand of man had
  surely at some time carved these faded figures. Maracot and Scanlan crowded
  to my porthole and gazed out in utter amazement at these signs of the
  omnipresent energies of man.</p>

  <p>'It is carving, for sure!' cried Scanlan. 'I guess this dump has been the
  roof of a building. Then these other ones are buildings also. Say, boss,
  we've dropped plumb on to a regular burg.'</p>

  <p>'It is, indeed, an ancient city,' said Maracot. 'Geology teaches that the
  seas have once been continents and the continents seas, but I have always
  distrusted the idea that in times so recent as the quaternary there could
  have been an Atlantic subsidence. Plato's report of Egyptian gossip had then
  a foundation of fact. These volcanic formations confirm the view that this
  subsidence was due to seismic activity.'</p>

  <p>'There is regularity about these domes,' I remarked. 'I begin to think
  that they are not separate houses, but that they are cupolas and form the
  ornaments of the roof of some huge building.'</p>

  <p>'I guess you are right,' said Scanlan. 'There are four big ones at the
  corners and the small ones in lines between. It's some building, if we could
  see the whole of it! You could put the whole Merribank plant inside it
  &mdash;and then some.'</p>

  <p>'It has been buried up to the roof by the constant dropping from above,'
  said Maracot. 'On the other hand, it has not decayed. We have a constant
  temperature of a little over 32 Fahrenheit in the great depths, which would
  arrest destructive processes. Even the dissolution of the Bathic remains
  which pave the floor of the ocean and incidentally give us this luminosity
  must be a very slow one. But, dear me! this marking is not a frieze but an
  inscription.'</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that he was right. The same symbol recurred every here
  and there. These marks were unquestionably letters of some archaic
  alphabet.</p>

  <p>'I have made a study of Phoenician antiquities, and there is certainly
  something suggestive and familiar in these characters,' said our leader.
  'Well, we have seen a buried city of ancient days, my friends, and we carry a
  wonderful piece of knowledge with us to the grave. There is no more to be
  learned. Our book of knowledge is closed. I agree with you that the sooner
  the end comes the better.'</p>

  <p>It could not now be long delayed. The air was stagnant and dreadful. So
  heavy was it with carbon products that the oxygen could hardly force its way
  out against the pressure. By standing on the settee one was able to get a
  gulp of purer air, but the mephitic reek was slowly rising. Dr. Maracot
  folded his arms with an air of resignation and sank his head upon his breast.
  Scanlan was now overpowered by the fumes and was already sprawling upon the
  floor. My own head was swimming, and I felt an intolerable weight at my
  chest. I closed my eyes and my senses were rapidly slipping away. Then I
  opened them for one last glimpse of that world which I was leaving, and as I
  did so I staggered to my feet with a hoarse scream of amazement.</p>

  <p>A human face was looking in at us through the porthole!</p>

  <p>Was it my delirium? I clutched at the shoulder of Maracot and shook him
  violently. He sat up and stared, wonder-struck and speechless at this
  apparition. If he saw it as well as I, it was no figment of the brain. The
  face was long and thin, dark in complexion, with a short, pointed beard, and
  two vivid eyes darting here and there in quick, questioning glances which
  took in every detail of our situation. The utmost amazement was visible upon
  the man's face. Our lights were now full on, and it must indeed have been a
  strange and vivid picture which presented itself to his gaze in that tiny
  chamber of death, where one man lay senseless and two others glared out at
  him with the twisted, contorted features of dying men, cyanosed by incipient
  asphyxiation. We both had our hands to our throats, and our heaving chests
  carried their message of despair. The man gave a wave of his hand and hurried
  away.</p>

  <p>'He has deserted us!' cried Maracot.</p>

  <p>'Or gone for help. Let us get Scanlan on the couch. It's death for him
  down there.'</p>

  <p>We dragged the mechanic on to the settee and propped his head against the
  cushions. His face was grey and he murmured in delirium, but his pulse was
  still perceptible.</p>

  <p>'There is hope for us yet,' I croaked.</p>

  <p>'But it is madness!' cried Maracot. 'How can man live at the bottom of the
  ocean? How can he breathe? It is collective hallucination. My young friend,
  we are going mad.'</p>

  <p>Looking out at the bleak, lonely grey landscape in the dreary spectral
  light, I felt that it might be as Maracot said. Then suddenly I was aware of
  movement. Shadows were flitting through the distant water. They hardened and
  thickened into moving figures. A crowd of people were hurrying across the
  ocean bed in our direction. An instant later they had assembled in front of
  the porthole and were pointing and gesticulating in animated debate. There
  were several women in the crowd, but the greater part were men, one of whom,
  a powerful figure with a very large head and a full black beard, was clearly
  a person of authority. He made a swift inspection of our steel shell, and,
  since the edge of our base projected over the place on which we rested, he
  was able to see that there was a hinged trap-door at the bottom. He now sent
  a messenger flying back, while he made energetic and commanding signs to us
  to open the door from within.</p>

  <p>'Why not?' I asked. 'We may as well be drowned as be smothered. I can
  stand it no longer.'</p>

  <p>'We may not be drowned,' said Maracot. 'The water entering from below
  cannot rise above the level of the compressed air. Give Scanlan some brandy.
  He must make an effort, if it is his last one.'</p>

  <p>I forced a drink down the mechanic's throat. He gulped and looked round
  him with wondering eyes. Between us we got him erect on the settee and stood
  on either side of him. He was still half-dazed, but in a few words I
  explained the situation.</p>

  <p>'There is a chance of chlorine poisoning if the water reaches the
  batteries,' said Maracot. 'Open every air tube, for the more pressure we can
  get the less water may enter. Now help me while I pull upon the lever.'</p>

  <p>We bent our weight upon it and yanked up the circular plate from the
  bottom of our little home, though I felt like a suicide as I did so. The
  green water, sparkling and gleaming under our light, came gurgling and
  surging in. It rose rapidly to our feet, to our knees, to our waists, and
  there it stopped. But the pressure of the air was intolerable. Our heads
  buzzed and the drums of our ears were bursting. We could not have lived in
  such an atmosphere for long. Only by clutching at the rack could we save
  ourselves from falling back into the waters beneath us.</p>

  <p>From our higher position we could no longer see through the portholes, nor
  could we imagine what steps were being taken for our deliverance. Indeed,
  that any effective help could come to us seemed beyond the power of thought,
  and yet there was a commanding and purposeful air about these people, and
  especially about that squat bearded chieftain, which inspired vague hopes.
  Suddenly we were aware of his face looking up at us through the water beneath
  and an instant later he had passed through the circular opening and had
  clambered on to the settee, so that he was standing by our side&mdash;a short
  sturdy figure, not higher than my shoulder, but surveying us with large brown
  eyes, which were full of a half-amused confidence, as who should say, 'You
  poor devils; you think you are in a very bad way, but I can clearly see the
  road out.'</p>

  <p>Only now was I aware of a very amazing thing. The man, if indeed he was of
  the same humanity as ourselves, had a transparent envelope all round him
  which enveloped his head and body, while his arms and legs were free. So
  translucent was it that no one could detect it in the water, but now that he
  was in the air beside us it glistened like silver, though it remained as
  clear as the finest glass. On either shoulder he had a curious rounded
  projection beneath the clear protective sheath. It looked like an oblong box
  pierced with many holes, and gave him an appearance as if he were wearing
  epaulettes.</p>

  <p>When our new friend had joined us another face appeared in the aperture of
  the bottom and thrust through it what seemed like a great bubble of glass.
  Three of these in succession were passed in and floated upon the surface of
  the water. Then six small boxes were handed up and our new acquaintance tied
  one with the straps attached to them to each of our shoulders, whence they
  stood up like his own. Already I began to surmise that no infraction of
  natural law was involved in the life of these strange people, and that while
  one box in some new fashion was a producer of air the other was an absorber
  of waste products. He now passed the transparent suits over our heads, and we
  felt that they clasped us tightly in the upper arm and waist by elastic
  bands, so that no water could penetrate. Within we breathed with perfect
  ease, and it was a joy to me to see Maracot looking out at me with his eyes
  twinkling as of old behind his glasses, while Bill Scanlan's grin assured me
  that the life-giving oxygen had done its work, and that he was his cheerful
  self once more. Our rescuer looked from one to another of us with grave
  satisfaction, and then motioned to us to follow him through the trap-door and
  out on to the floor of the ocean. A dozen willing hands were outstretched to
  pull us through and to sustain our first faltering steps as we staggered with
  our feet deep in the slimy ooze.</p>

  <p>Even now I cannot get past the marvel of it! There we were, the three of
  us, unhurt and at our ease at the bottom of a five-mile abyss of water. Where
  was that terrific pressure which had exercised the imagination of so many
  scientists? We were no more affected by it than were the dainty fish which
  swam around us. It is true that, so far as our bodies were concerned, we were
  protected by these delicate bells of vitrine, which were in truth tougher
  than the strongest steel, but even our limbs, which were exposed, felt no
  more than a firm constriction from the water which one learned in time to
  disregard. It was wonderful to stand together and to look back at the shell
  from which we had emerged. We had left the batteries at work, and it was a
  wondrous object with its streams of yellow light flooding out from each side,
  while clouds of fishes gathered at each window. As we watched it the leader
  took Maracot by the hand, and we followed them both across the watery morass,
  clumping heavily through the sticky surface.</p>

  <p>And now a most surprising incident occurred, which was clearly as
  astonishing to these strange new companions of ours as to ourselves. Above
  our heads there appeared a small, dark object, descending from the darkness
  above us and swinging down until it reached the bed of the ocean within a
  very short distance from where we stood. It was, of course, the deep-sea lead
  from the <i>Stratford</i> above us, making a sounding of that watery gulf
  with which the name of the expedition was to be associated. We had seen it
  already upon its downward path, and we could well understand that the tragedy
  of our disappearance had suspended the operation, but that after a pause it
  had been concluded, with little thought that it would finish almost at our
  feet. They were unconscious, apparently, that they had touched bottom, for
  the lead lay motionless in the ooze. Above me stretched the taut piano wire
  which connected me through five miles of water with the deck of our vessel.
  Oh, that it were possible to write a note and to attach it! The idea was
  absurd, and yet could I not send some message which would show them that we
  were still conscious? My coat was covered by my glass bell and the pockets
  were unapproachable, but I was free below the waist and my handkerchief
  chanced to be in my trousers pocket. I pulled it out and tied it above the
  top of the lead. The weight at once disengaged itself by its automatic
  mechanism, and presently I saw my white wisp of linen flying upwards to that
  world which I may never see again. Our new acquaintances examined the
  seventy-five pounds of lead with great interest, and finally carried it off
  with us as we went upon our way.</p>

  <p>We had only walked a couple of hundred yards, threading our way among the
  hummocks, when we halted before a small square-cut door with solid pillars on
  either side and an inscription across the lintel. It was open, and we passed
  through it into a large, bare chamber. There was a sliding partition worked
  by a crank from within, and this was drawn across behind us. We could, of
  course, hear nothing in our glass helmets, but after standing a few minutes
  we were aware that a powerful pump must be at work, for we saw the level of
  the water sinking rapidly above us. In less than a quarter of an hour we were
  standing upon a sloppy stone-flagged pavement, while our new friends were
  busy in undoing the fastenings of our transparent suits. An instant later
  there we stood, breathing perfectly pure air in a warm, well-lighted
  atmosphere, while the dark people of the abyss, smiling and chattering,
  crowded round us with hand-shakings and friendly pattings. It was a strange,
  rasping tongue that they spoke, and no word of it was intelligible to us, but
  the smile on the face and the light of friendship in the eye are
  understandable even in the waters under the earth. The glass suits were hung
  on numbered pegs upon the wall, and the kindly folk half led and half pushed
  us to an inner door which opened on to a long downward-sloping corridor. When
  it closed again behind us there was nothing to remind us of the stupendous
  fact that we were the involuntary guests of an unknown race at the bottom of
  the Atlantic ocean and cut off for ever from the world to which we
  belonged.</p>

  <p>Now that the terrific strain had been so suddenly eased we were all
  exhausted. Even Bill Scanlan, who was a pocket Hercules, dragged his feet
  along the floor, while Maracot and I were only too glad to lean heavily upon
  our guides. Yet, weary as I was, I took in every detail as we passed. That
  the air came from some air-making machine was very evident, for it issued in
  puffs from circular openings in the walls. The light was diffused and was
  clearly an extension of that fluor system which was already engaging the
  attention of our European engineers when the filament and lamp were dispensed
  with. It shone from long cylinders of clear glass which were suspended along
  the cornices of the passages. So much I had observed when our descent was
  checked and we were ushered into a large sitting-room, thickly carpeted and
  well furnished with gilded chairs and sloping sofas which brought back vague
  memories of Egyptian tombs. The crowd had been dismissed and only the bearded
  man with two attendants remained. 'Manda' he repeated several times, tapping
  himself upon the chest. Then he pointed to each of us in turn and repeated
  the words Maracot, Headley and Scanlan until he had them perfect. He then
  motioned us to be seated and said a word to one of the attendants, who left
  the room and returned presently, escorting a very ancient gentleman,
  white-haired and long- bearded, with a curious conical cap of black cloth
  upon his head. I should have said that all these folk were dressed in
  coloured tunics, which extended to their knees, with high boots of fish skin
  or shagreen. The venerable newcomer was clearly a physician, for he examined
  each of us in turn, placing his hand upon our brows and closing his own eyes
  as if receiving a mental impression as to our condition. Apparently he was by
  no means satisfied, for he shook his head and said a few grave words to
  Manda. The latter at once sent the attendant out once more, and he brought in
  a tray of eatables and a flask of wine, which were laid before us. We were
  too weary to ask ourselves what they were, but we felt the better for the
  meal. We were then led to another room, where three beds had been prepared,
  and on one of these I flung myself down. I have a dim recollection of Bill
  Scanlan coming across and sitting beside me.</p>

  <p>'Say, Bo, that jolt of brandy saved my life,' said he. 'But where are we,
  anyhow?'</p>

  <p>'I know no more than you do.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I am ready to hit the hay,' he said, sleepily, as he turned to his
  bed. 'Say, that wine was fine. Thank God, Volstead never got down here.' They
  were the last words I heard as I sank into the most profound sleep that I can
  ever recall.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN I came to myself I could not at first imagine where I
  was. The events of the previous day were like some blurred nightmare, and I
  could not believe that I had to accept them as facts. I looked round in
  bewilderment at the large, bare, windowless room with drab-coloured walls, at
  the lines of quivering purplish light which flowed along the cornices, at the
  scattered articles of furniture, and finally at the two other beds, from one
  of which came the high-pitched, strident snore which I had learned aboard the
  <i>Stratford</i>, to associate with Maracot. It was too grotesque to be true,
  and it was only when I fingered my bed cover and observed the curious woven
  material, the dried fibres of some sea plant, from which it was made, that I
  was able to realize this inconceivable adventure which had befallen us. I was
  still pondering it when there came a loud explosion of laughter, and Bill
  Scanlan sat up in bed.</p>

  <p>'Mornin', Bo!' he cried, amid his chuckles, on seeing that I was
  awake.</p>

  <p>'You seem in good spirits,' said I, rather testily. 'I can't see that we
  have much to laugh about.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I had a grouch on me, the same as you, when first I woke up,' he
  answered. 'Then came a real cute idea, and it was that that made me
  laugh.'</p>

  <p>'I could do with a laugh myself,' said I. 'What's the idea?'</p>

  <p>'Well, Bo, I thought how durned funny it would have been if we had all
  tied ourselves on to that deep-sea line. I allow with those glass dinguses we
  could have kept breathing all right. Then when old man Howie looked over the
  side there would have been the whole bunch of us comin' up at him through the
  water. He would have figured that he had hooked us, sure. Gee, what a
  spiel!'</p>

  <p>Our united laughter woke the Doctor, who sat up in bed with the same
  amazed expression upon his face which had previously been upon my own. I
  forgot our troubles as I listened in amusement to his disjointed comments,
  which alternated between ecstatic joy at the prospect of such a field of
  study, and profound sorrow that he could never hope to convey his results to
  his scientific confreres of the earth. Finally he got back to the actual
  needs of the moment.</p>

  <p>'It is nine o'clock,' he said, looking at his watch. We all registered the
  same hour, but there was nothing to show if it was night or morning.</p>

  <p>'We must keep our own calendar,' said Maracot; 'we descended upon October
  3rd. We reached this place on the evening of the same day. How long have we
  slept?'</p>

  <p>'My gosh, it may have been a month,' said Scanlan, 'I've not been so deep
  since Mickey Scott got me on the point in the six round try-out at the
  Works.'</p>

  <p>We dressed and washed, for every civilized convenience was at hand. The
  door, however, was fastened, and it was clear that we were prisoners for the
  time. In spite of the apparent absence of any ventilation, the atmosphere
  kept perfectly sweet, and we found that this was due to a current of air
  which came through small holes in the wall. There was some source of central
  heating, too, for though no stove was visible, the temperature was pleasantly
  warm. Presently I observed a knob upon one of the walls, and pressed it. This
  was, as I expected, a bell, for the door instantly opened, and a small, dark
  man, dressed in a yellow robe, appeared in the aperture. He looked at us
  inquiringly, with large brown, kindly eyes.</p>

  <p>'We are hungry,' said Maracot; 'can you get us some food?'</p>

  <p>The man shook his head and smiled. It was clear that the words were
  incomprehensible to him.</p>

  <p>Scanlan tried his luck with a flow of American slang, which was received
  with the same blank smile. When, however, I opened my mouth and thrust my
  finger into it, our visitor nodded vigorously and hurried away.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later the door opened and two of the yellow attendants
  appeared, rolling a small table before them. Had we been at the Biltmore
  Hotel we could not have had better fare. There were coffee, hot milk, rolls,
  delicious flat fish, and honey. For half an hour we were far too busy to
  discuss what we ate or whence it was obtained. At the end of that time the
  two servants appeared once more, rolled out the tray, and closed the door
  carefully behind them.</p>

  <p>'I'm fair black and blue with pinching myself,' said Scanlan. 'Is this a
  pipe dream or what? Say, Doc, you got us down here, and I guess it is up to
  you to tell us just how you size it all up.'</p>

  <p>The Doctor shook his head.</p>

  <p>'It is like a dream to me also, but it is a glorious dream! What a story
  for the world if we could but get it to them!'</p>

  <p>'One thing is clear,' said I, 'there was certainly truth in this legend of
  Atlantis, and some of the folk have in a marvellous way managed to carry
  on.'</p>

  <p>'Well, even if they carried on,' cried Bill Scanlan, scratching his bullet
  head, 'I am darned if I can understand how they could get air and fresh water
  and the rest. Maybe if that queer duck with the beard that we saw last night
  comes to give us a once-over he will put us wise to it.'</p>

  <p>'How can he do that when we have no common language?'</p>

  <p>'Well, we shall use our own observation,' said Maracot. 'One thing I can
  already understand. I learned it from the honey at breakfast. That was
  clearly synthetic honey, such as we have already learned to make upon the
  earth. But if synthetic honey, why not synthetic coffee, or flour? The
  molecules of the elements are like bricks, and these bricks lie all around
  us. We have only to learn how to pull out certain bricks&mdash;sometimes just
  a single brick&mdash;in order to make a fresh substance. Sugar becomes
  starch, or either becomes alcohol, just by a shifting of the bricks. What is
  it that shifts them? Heat. Electricity. Other things perhaps of which we know
  nothing. Some of them will shift themselves, and radium becomes lead or
  uranium becomes radium without our touching them.'</p>

  <p>'You think, then, that they have an advanced chemistry?'</p>

  <p>'I'm sure of it. After all there is no elemental brick which is not ready
  to their hands. Hydrogen and oxygen come readily from the sea water. There
  are nitrogen and carbon in those masses of sea vegetation, and there are
  phosphorus and calcium in the bathybic deposit. With skilful management and
  adequate knowledge, what is there which could not be produced?'</p>

  <p>The Doctor had launched upon a chemical lecture when the door opened and
  Manda entered, giving us a friendly greeting. There came with him the same
  old gentleman of venerable appearance whom we had met the night before. He
  may have had a reputation for learning, for he tried several sentences, which
  were probably different languages, upon us, but all were equally
  unintelligible. Then he shrugged his shoulders and spoke to Manda, who gave
  an order to the two yellow-clad servants, still waiting at the door. They
  vanished, but returned presently with a curious screen, supported by two side
  posts. It was exactly like one of our cinema screens, but it was coated with
  some sparkling material which glittered and shimmered in the light. This was
  placed against one of the walls. The old man then paced out very carefully a
  certain distance, and marked it upon the floor. Standing at this point he
  turned to Maracot and touched his forehead, pointing to the screen.</p>

  <p>'Clean dippy,' said Scanlan. 'Bats in the belfry.'</p>

  <p>Maracot shook his head to show that we were nonplussed. So was the old man
  for a moment. An idea struck him, however, and he pointed to his own figure.
  Then he turned towards the screen, fixed his eyes upon it, and seemed to
  concentrate his attention. In an instant a reflection of himself appeared on
  the screen before us. Then he pointed to us, and a moment later our own
  little group took the place of his image. It was not particularly like us.
  Scanlan looked like a comic Chinaman and Maracot like a decayed corpse, but
  it was clearly meant to be ourselves as we appeared in the eyes of the
  operator.</p>

  <p>'It's a reflection of thought,' I cried.</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' said Maracot. 'This is certainly a most marvellous invention,
  and yet it is but a combination of such telepathy and television as we dimly
  comprehend upon earth.'</p>

  <p>'I never thought I'd live to see myself on the movies, if that cheese-
  faced Chink is really meant for me,' said Scanlan. 'Say, if we could get all
  this news to the editor of the Ledger he'd cough up enough to keep me for
  life. We've sure got the goods if we could deliver them.'</p>

  <p>'That's the trouble,' said I. 'By George, we could stir the whole world if
  we could only get back to it. But what is he beckoning about?'</p>

  <p>'The old guy wants you to try your hand at it, Doc.'</p>

  <p>Maracot took the place indicated, and his strong, clear-cut brain focused
  his picture to perfection. We saw an image of Manda, and then another one of
  the <i>Stratford</i> as we had left her.</p>

  <p>Both Manda and the old scientist nodded their great approval at the sight
  of the ship, and Manda made a sweeping gesture with his hands, pointing first
  to us and then to the screen.</p>

  <p>'To tell them all about it&mdash;that's the idea,' I cried. 'They want to
  know in pictures who we are, and how we got here.'</p>

  <p>Maracot nodded to Manda to show that he understood, and had begun to throw
  an image of our voyage, when Manda held up his hand and stopped him. At an
  order the attendants removed the screen, and the two Atlanteans beckoned that
  we should follow them.</p>

  <p>It was a huge building, and we proceeded down corridor after corridor
  until we came at last to a large hall with seats arranged in tiers like a
  lecture room. At one side was a broad screen of the same nature as that which
  we had seen. Facing it there was assembled an audience of at least a thousand
  people, who set up a murmur of welcome as we entered. They were of both sexes
  and of all ages, the men dark and bearded, the women beautiful in youth and
  dignified in age. We had little time to observe them, for we were led to
  seats in the front row, and Maracot was then placed on a stand opposite the
  screen, the lights were in some fashion turned down, and he had the signal to
  begin.</p>

  <p>And excellently well he played his part. We first saw our vessel sailing
  forth from the Thames, and a buzz of excitement went up from the tense
  audience at this authentic glimpse of a real modern city. Then a map appeared
  which marked her course. Then was seen the steel shell with its fittings,
  which was greeted with a murmur of recognition. We saw ourselves once more
  descending, and reaching the edge of the abyss. Then came the appearance of
  the monster who had wrecked us. 'Marax! Marax!' cried the people, as the
  beast appeared. It was clear that they had learned to know and to fear it.
  There was a terrified hush as the creature fumbled with our hawser, and a
  groan of horror as the wires parted and we dropped into the gulf. In a month
  of explanation we could not have made our plight so clear as in that
  half-hour of visible demonstration.</p>

  <p>As the audience broke up they showered every sign of sympathy upon us,
  crowding round us and patting our backs to show that we were welcome. We were
  presented in turn to some of the chiefs, but the chieftainship seemed to lie
  in wisdom alone, for all appeared to be on the same social scale, and were
  dressed in much the same way. The men wore tunics of a saffron colour coming
  down to the knees, with belts and high boots of a scaly tough material which
  must have been the hide of some sea beast. The women were beautifully draped
  in classical style, their flowing robes of every tint of pink and blue and
  green, ornamented with clusters of pearl or opalescent sheets of shell. Many
  of them were lovely beyond any earthly comparison. There was one&mdash;but
  why should I mix my private feelings up with this public narrative? Let me
  say only that Mona is the only daughter of Manda, one of the leaders of the
  people, and that from that first day of meeting I read in her dark eyes a
  message of sympathy and of understanding which went home to my heart, as my
  gratitude and admiration may have gone to hers. I need not say more at
  present about this exquisite lady. Suffice it that a new and strong influence
  had come into my life. When I saw Maracot gesticulating with unwonted
  animation to one kindly lady, while Scanlan stood conveying his admiration in
  pantomime in the centre of a group of laughing girls, I realized that my
  companions also had begun to find that there was a lighter side to our tragic
  position. If we were dead to the world we had at least found a life beyond,
  which promised some compensation for what we had lost.</p>

  <p>Later in the day we were guided by Manda and other friends round some
  portions of the immense building. It had been so embedded in the sea-floor by
  the accumulations of ages that it was only through the roof that it could be
  entered, and from this point the passages led down and down until the floor
  level was reached several hundred feet below the entrance chamber. The floor
  in turn had been excavated, and we saw in all directions passages which
  sloped downwards into the bowels of the earth. We were shown the air-making
  apparatus with the pumps which circulated it through the building. Maracot
  pointed out with wonder and admiration that not only was the oxygen united
  with the nitrogen, but that smaller retorts supplied other gases which could
  only be the argon, neon, and other little-known constituents of the
  atmosphere which we are only just beginning to understand. The distilling
  vats for making fresh water and the enormous electrical instalments were
  other objects of interest, but much of the machinery was so intricate that it
  was difficult for us to follow the details. I can only say that I saw with my
  own eyes, and tested with my own palate, that chemicals in gaseous and liquid
  forms were poured into various machines, that they were treated by heat, by
  pressure, and by electricity, and that flour, tea, coffee, or wine was
  collected as the product.</p>

  <p>There was one consideration which was very quickly forced upon us by our
  examination, on various occasions, of as much of this building as was open to
  our inspection. This was that the exposure to the sea had been foreseen and
  the protection against the inrush of the water had been prepared long before
  the land sank beneath the waves. Of course, it stood to reason, and needed no
  proof, that such precautions could not have been taken after the event, but
  we were witnesses now of the signs that the whole great building had from the
  first been constructed with the one idea of being an enduring ark of refuge.
  The huge retorts and vats in which the air, the food, the distilled water,
  and the other necessary products were made were all built into the walls, and
  were evidently integral parts of the original construction. So, too, with the
  exit chambers, the silica works where the vitrine bells were constructed, and
  the huge pumps which controlled the water. Every one of these things had been
  prepared by the skill and the foresight of that wonderful far-away people who
  seemed, from what we could learn, to have thrown out one arm to Central
  America and one to Egypt, and so left traces of themselves even upon this
  earth when their own land went down into the Atlantic. As to these, their
  descendants, we judged that they had probably degenerated, as was but
  natural, and that at the most they had been stagnant and only preserved some
  of the science and knowledge of their ancestors without having the energy to
  add to it. They possessed wonderful powers and yet seemed to us to be
  strangely wanting in initiative, and had added nothing to that wonderful
  legacy which they had inherited. I am sure that Maracot, using this
  knowledge, would very soon have attained greater results. As to Scanlan, with
  his quick brain and mechanical skill, he was continually putting in touches
  which probably seemed as remarkable to them as their powers to us. He had a
  beloved mouth-organ in his coat-pocket when we made our descent, and his use
  of this was a perpetual joy to our companions, who sat around in entranced
  groups, as we might listen to a Mozart, while he handed out to them the
  crooning coon songs of his native land.</p>

  <p>I have said that the whole building was not open to our inspection, and I
  might give a little further detail upon that subject. There was one well-worn
  corridor down which we saw folk continually passing, but which was always
  avoided by our guides in our excursions. As was natural our curiosity was
  aroused, and we determined one evening that we would take a chance and do a
  little exploring upon our own account. We slipped out of our room, therefore,
  and made our way to the unknown quarter at a time when few people were
  about.</p>

  <p>The passage led us to a high arched door, which appeared to be made of
  solid gold. When we pushed it open we found ourselves in a huge room, forming
  a square of not less than two hundred feet. All around, the walls were
  painted with vivid colours and adorned with extraordinary pictures and
  statues of grotesque creatures with enormous head-dresses, like the full
  dress regalia of our American Indians. At the end of this great hall there
  was one huge seated figure, the legs crossed like a Buddha, but with none of
  the benignity of aspect which is seen on the Buddha's placid features. On the
  contrary, this was a creature of Wrath, open-mouthed and fierce-eyed, the
  latter being red, and their effect exaggerated by two electric lights which
  shone through them. On his lap was a great oven, which we observed, as we
  approached it, to be filled with ashes.</p>

  <p>'Moloch!' said Maracot. 'Moloch or Baal&mdash;the old god of the
  Phoenician races.'</p>

  <p>'Good heavens!' I cried, with recollections of old Carthage before me.
  'Don't tell me that these gentle folk could go in for human sacrifice.'</p>

  <p>'Look it here, Bo!' said Scanlan, anxiously. 'I hope they keep it in the
  family, anyhow. We don't want them to pull no such dope on us.'</p>

  <p>'No, I guess they have learned their lesson,' said I. 'It's misfortune
  that teaches folk to have pity for others.'</p>

  <p>'That's right,' Maracot remarked, poking about among the ashes, 'it is the
  old hereditary god, but it is surely a gentler cult. These are burned loaves
  and the like. But perhaps there was a time&mdash;'</p>

  <p>But our speculations were interrupted by a stern voice at our elbow, and
  we found several men in yellow garments and high hats, who were clearly the
  priests of the Temple. From the expression on their faces I should judge that
  we were very near to being the last victims to Baal, and one of them had
  actually drawn a knife from his girdle. With fierce gestures and cries they
  drove us roughly out of their sacred shrine.</p>

  <p>'By gosh!' cried Scanlan, 'I'll sock that duck if he keeps crowding me!
  Look it here, you Bindlestiff, keep your hands off my coat.'</p>

  <p>For a moment I feared that we should have had what Scanlan called a 'rough
  house' within the sacred precincts. However, we got the angry mechanic away
  without blows and regained the shelter of our room, but we could tell from
  the demeanour of Manda and others of our friends that our escapade was known
  and resented.</p>

  <p>But there was another shrine which was freely shown to us and which had a
  very unexpected result, for it opened up a slow and imperfect method of
  communication between our companions and ourselves. This was a room in the
  lower quarter of the Temple, with no decorations or distinction save that at
  one end there stood a statue of ivory yellow with age, representing a woman
  holding a spear, with an owl perched upon her shoulder. A very old man was
  the guardian of the room, and in spite of his age it was clear to us that he
  was of a very different race, and one of a finer, larger type than the men of
  the Temple. As we stood gazing at the ivory statue, Maracot and I, both
  wondering where we had seen something like it, the old man addressed us.</p>

  <p>'Thea,' said he, pointing to the figure.</p>

  <p>'By George!' I cried, 'he is speaking Greek.'</p>

  <p>'Thea! Athena!' repeated the man.</p>

  <p>There was not a doubt of it. 'Goddess&mdash;Athena,' the words were
  unmistakable. Maracot, whose wonderful brain had absorbed something from
  every branch of human knowledge, began at once to ask questions in Classical
  Greek which were only partly understood and were answered in a dialect so
  archaic that it was almost incomprehensible. Still, he acquired some
  knowledge, and he found an intermediary through whom he could dimly convey
  something to our companions.</p>

  <p>'It is a remarkable proof,' said Maracot that evening, in his high
  neighing voice and in the tones of one addressing a large class, 'of the
  reliability of legend. There is always a basis of fact even if in the course
  of the years it should become distorted. You are aware&mdash;or probably you
  are not aware'&mdash;('Bet your life!' from Scanlan)&mdash;'that a war was
  going on between the primitive Greeks and, the Atlanteans at the time of the
  destruction of the great island. The fact is recorded in Solon's description
  of what he learned from the priests of Sais. We may conjecture that there
  were Greek prisoners in the hands of the Atlanteans at the time, that some of
  them were in the service of the Temple, and that they carried their own
  religion with them. That man was, so far as I could understand, the old
  hereditary priest of the cult, and perhaps when we know more we shall see
  something of these ancient people.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I hand it to them for good sense,' said Scanlan. 'I guess if you
  want a plaster god it is better to have a fine woman than that blatherskite
  with the red eyes and the coal-bunker on his knees.'</p>

  <p>'Lucky they can't understand your views,' I remarked. 'If they did you
  might end up as a Christian martyr.'</p>

  <p>'Not so long as I can play them jazz,' he answered, 'I guess they've got
  used to me now, and they couldn't do without me.'</p>

  <p>They were a cheerful crowd, and it was a happy life, but there were and
  are times when one's whole heart goes out to the homelands which we have
  lost, and visions of the dear old quadrangles of Oxford, or of the ancient
  elms and the familiar campus of Harvard, came up before my mind. In those
  early days they seemed as far from me as some landscape in the moon, and only
  now in a dim uncertain fashion does the hope of seeing them once more begin
  to grow in my soul.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a few days after our arrival that our hosts or our
  captors&mdash; we were dubious sometimes as to which to call them&mdash;took
  us out for an expedition upon the bottom of the ocean. Six of them came with
  us, including Manda, the chief. We assembled in the same exit chamber in
  which we had originally been received, and we were now in a condition to
  examine it a little more closely. It was a very large place, at least a
  hundred feet each way, and its low walls and ceiling were green with marine
  growths and dripping with moisture. A long row of pegs, with marks which I
  presume were numbers, ran round the whole room, and on each was hung one of
  the semi-transparent bells of vitrine and a pair of the shoulder batteries
  which ensured respiration. The floor was of flagged stone worn into
  concavities, the footsteps of many generations, these hollows now lying as
  pools of shallow water. The whole was highly illuminated by fluor tubes round
  the cornice. We were fastened into our vitrine coverings, and a stout pointed
  staff made of some light metal was handed to each of us. Then, by signals,
  Manda ordered us to take a grip of a rail which ran round the room, he and
  his friends setting us an example. The object of this soon became evident,
  for as the outer door swung slowly open the sea water came pouring in with
  such force that we should have been swept from our feet but for this
  precaution. It rose rapidly, however, to above the level of our heads, and
  the pressure upon us was eased. Manda led the way to the door, and an instant
  afterwards we were out on the ocean bed once more, leaving the portal open
  behind us ready for our return.</p>

  <p>Looking round us in the cold, flickering, spectral light which illuminates
  the bathybian plain, we could see for a radius of at least a quarter of a
  mile in every direction.</p>

  <p>What amazed us was to observe, on the very limit of what was visible, a
  very brilliant glow of radiance. It was towards this that our leader turned
  his steps, our party walking in single file behind him. It was slow going,
  for there was the resistance of the water, and our feet were buried deeply in
  the soft slush with every step; but soon we were able to see clearly what the
  beacon was which had attracted us. It was our own shell, our last reminder of
  terrestrial life, which lay tilted upon one of the cupolas of the far-flung
  building, with all its lights still blazing. It was three-quarters full of
  water, but the imprisoned air still preserved that portion in which our
  electric instalment lay. It was strange indeed as we gazed into it to see the
  familiar interior with our settees and instruments still in position, while
  several good-sized fish like minnows in a bottle swam round and round inside
  it. One after the other our party clambered in through the open flap, Maracot
  to rescue a book of notes which floated on the surface, Scanlan and I to pick
  up some personal belongings. Manda came also with one or two of his comrades,
  examining with the greatest interest the bathometer and thermometer with the
  other instruments which were attached to the wall. The latter we detached and
  took away with us. It may interest scientists to know that forty degrees
  Fahrenheit represents the temperature at the greatest sea depths to which man
  has ever descended, and that it is higher, on account of the chemical
  decomposition of the ooze, than the upper strata of the sea.</p>

  <p>Our little expedition had, it seems, a definite object besides that of
  allowing us a little exercise upon the bed of the ocean. We were hunting for
  food. Every now and then I saw our comrades strike sharply down with their
  pointed sticks, impaling each time a large brown flat fish, not unlike a
  turbot, which was numerous, but lay so closely in the ooze that it took
  practised eyes to detect it. Soon each of the little men had two or three of
  these dangling at his side. Scanlan and I soon got the knack of it, and
  captured a couple each, but Maracot walked as one in a dream, quite lost in
  his wonder at the ocean beauties around him and making long and excited
  speeches which were lost to the ear, but visible to the eyes from the
  contortion of his features.</p>

  <p>Our first impression had been one of monotony, but we soon found that the
  grey plains were broken up into varied formations by the action of the
  deep-sea currents which flowed like submarine rivers across them. These
  streams cut channels in the soft slime and exposed the beds which lay
  beneath. The floor of these banks consisted of red clay which forms the base
  of all things on the surface of the bed of the ocean, and they were thickly
  studded with white objects which I imagined to be shells, but which proved,
  when we examined them, to be the ear bones of whales and the teeth of sharks
  and the other sea monsters. One of these teeth which I picked up was fifteen
  inches long, and we could but be thankful that so fearful a monster
  frequented the higher levels of ocean. It belonged, according to Maracot, to
  a giant-killing grampus or Orca gladiator. It recalled the observation of
  Mitchell Hedges that even the most terrible sharks that he had caught bore
  upon their bodies the marks which showed that they had encountered creatures
  larger and more formidable than themselves.</p>

  <p>There was one peculiarity of the ocean depths which impresses itself upon
  the observer. There is, as I have said, a constant cold light rising up from
  the slow phosphorescent decay of the great masses of organic matter. But
  above, all is black as night. The effect is that of a dim winter day, with a
  heavy black thundercloud lying low above the earth. Out of this black canopy
  there falls slowly an incessant snowstorm of tiny white flakes, which glimmer
  against the sombre background. These are the shells of sea snails and other
  small creatures who live and die in the five miles of water which separate us
  from the surface, and though many of these are dissolved as they fall and add
  to the lime salts in the ocean, the rest go in the course of ages to form
  that deposit which had entombed the great city in the upper part of which we
  now dwelt.</p>

  <p>Leaving our last link with earth beneath us, we pushed on into the gloom
  of the submarine world and soon we were met by a completely new development.
  A moving patch appeared in front of us, which broke up as we approached it
  into a crowd of men, each in his vitrine envelope, who were dragging behind
  them broad sledges heaped with coal. It was heavy work, and the poor devils
  were bending and straining, tugging hard at the sharkskin ropes which served
  as traces. With each gang of men there was one who appeared to be in
  authority, and it interested us to see that the leaders and the workers were
  clearly of a different race. The latter were tall men, fair, with blue eyes
  and powerful bodies. The others were, as already described, dark and almost
  negroid, with squat, broad frames. We could not inquire into the mystery at
  that moment, but the impression was left upon my mind that the one race
  represented the hereditary slaves of the other, and Maracot was of the
  opinion that they may have been the descendants of those Greek prisoners
  whose goddess we had seen in the Temple.</p>

  <p>Several droves of these men, each drawing its load of coal, were met by us
  before we came to the mine itself. At this point the deep-sea deposits and
  the sandy formations which lay beneath them had been cut away, and a great
  pit exposed, which consisted of alternate layers of clay and coal,
  representing strata in the old perished world of long ago which now lay at
  the bottom of the Atlantic. At the various levels of this huge excavation we
  could see gangs of men at work hewing the coal, while others gathered it into
  loads and placed it in baskets, by means of which it was hoisted up to the
  level above. The whole mine was on so vast a scale that we could not see the
  other side of the enormous pit which so many generations of workers had
  scooped in the bed of the ocean. This, then, transmuted into electric force,
  was the source of the motive power by which the whole machinery of Atlantis
  was run. It is interesting, by the way, to record that the name of the old
  city had been correctly preserved in the legends, for when we had mentioned
  it to Manda and others they first looked greatly surprised that we should
  know it, and then nodded their heads vigorously to show that they
  understood.</p>

  <p>Passing the great coal pit&mdash;or, rather, branching away from it to the
  right&mdash;we came on a line of low cliffs of basalt, their surface as clear
  and shining as on the day when they were shot up from the bowels of the
  earth, while their summit; some hundreds of feet above us, loomed up against
  the dark background. The base of these volcanic cliffs was draped in a deep
  jungle of high seaweed, growing out of tangled masses of crinoid corals laid
  down in the old terrestrial days. Along the edge of this thick undergrowth we
  wandered for some time, our companions beating it with their sticks and
  driving out for our amusement an extraordinary assortment of strange fishes
  and crustacea, now and again securing a specimen for their own tables. For a
  mile or more we wandered along in this happy fashion, when I saw Manda stop
  suddenly and look round him with gestures of alarm and surprise. These
  submarine gestures formed a language in themselves, for in a moment his
  companions understood the cause of his trouble, and then with a shock we
  realized it also. Dr. Maracot had disappeared.</p>

  <p>He had certainly been with us at the coal pit, and he had come as far as
  the basalt cliffs. It was inconceivable that he had got ahead of us, so it
  was evident that he must be somewhere along the line of jungle in our rear.
  Though our friends were disturbed, Scanlan and I, who knew something of the
  good man's absent-minded eccentricities were confident that there was no
  cause for alarm, and that we should soon find him loitering over some sea
  form which had attracted him. We all turned to retrace our steps, and had
  hardly gone a hundred yards before we caught sight of him.</p>

  <p>But he was running&mdash;running with an agility which I should have
  thought impossible for a man of his habits. Even the least athletic can run,
  however, when fear is the pacemaker. His hands were outstretched for help,
  and he stumbled and blundered forward with clumsy energy. He had good cause
  to exert himself, for three horrible creatures were close at his heels. They
  were tiger crabs, striped black and white, each about the size of a
  Newfoundland dog. Fortunately they were themselves not very swift travellers,
  and were scurrying along the soft sea bottom in a curious sidelong fashion
  which was little faster than that of the terrified fugitive.</p>

  <p>Their wind was better, however, and they would probably have had their
  horrible claws upon him in a very few minutes had not our friends intervened.
  They dashed forward with their pointed sticks, and Manda flashed a power
  electric lantern, which he carried in his belt, in the face of the loathsome
  monsters, who scuttled into the jungle and were lost to view. Our comrade sat
  down on a lump of coral and his face showed that he was exhausted by his
  adventure. He told us afterwards that he had penetrated the jungle in the
  hope of securing what seemed to him to be a rare specimen of the deep-sea
  Chimoera, and that he had blundered into the nest of these fierce tiger
  crabs, who had instantly dashed after him. It was only after a long rest that
  he was able to resume the journey.</p>

  <p>Our next stage after skirting the basalt cliffs led us to our goal. The
  grey plain in front of us was covered at this point by irregular hummocks and
  tall projections which told us that the great city of old lay beneath it. It
  would all have been completely buried for ever by the ooze, as Herculaneum
  has been by lava or Pompeii by ashes, had an entrance to it not been
  excavated by the survivors of the Temple. This entrance was a long, downward
  cutting, which ended up in a broad street with buildings exposed on either
  side. The walls of these buildings were occasionally cracked and shattered,
  for they were not of the solid construction which had preserved the Temple,
  but the interiors were in most cases exactly as they had been when the
  catastrophe occurred, save that sea changes of all sorts, beautiful and rare
  in some cases and horrifying in others, had modified the appearances of the
  rooms. Our guides did not encourage us to examine the first ones which we
  reached, but hurried us onwards until we came to that which had clearly been
  the great central citadel or palace round which the whole town centred. The
  pillars and columns and vast sculptured cornices and friezes and staircases
  of this building exceeded anything which I have ever seen upon earth.</p>

  <p>Its nearest approach seemed to me to be the remains of the Temple of
  Karnak at Luxor in Egypt, and, strange to say, the decorations and
  half-effaced engravings resembled in detail those of the great ruin beside
  the Nile, and the lotus-shaped capitals of the columns were the same. It was
  an amazing experience to stand on the marble tessellated floors of those vast
  halls, with great statues looming high above one on every side, and to see,
  as we saw that day, huge silvery eels gliding above our heads and frightened
  fish darting away in every direction from the light which was projected
  before us. From room to room we wandered, marking every sign of luxury and
  occasionally of that lascivious folly which is said, by the lingering legend,
  to have drawn God's curse upon the people. One small room was wonderfully
  enamelled with mother-of- pearl, so that even now it gleamed with brilliant
  opalescent tints when the light played across it. An ornamented platform of
  yellow metal and a similar couch lay in one corner, and one felt that it may
  well have been the bedchamber of a queen, but beside the couch there lay now
  a loathsome black squid, its foul body rising and falling in a slow, stealthy
  rhythm so that it seemed like some evil heart which still beat in the very
  centre of the wicked palace. I was glad, and so, I learned, were my
  companions, when our guides led the way out once more, glancing for a moment
  at a ruined amphitheatre and again at a pier with a lighthouse at the end,
  which showed that the city had been a seaport. Soon we had emerged from these
  places of ill omen and were out on the familiar bathybian plain once
  more.</p>

  <p>Our adventures were not quite over, for there was one more which was as
  alarming to our companions as to ourselves. We had nearly made our way home
  when one of our guides pointed upwards with alarm. Gazing in that direction
  we saw an extraordinary sight. Out of the black gloom of the waters a huge,
  dark figure was emerging, falling rapidly downwards. At first it seemed a
  shapeless mass, but as it came more clearly into the light we could see that
  it was the dead body of a monstrous fish, which had burst so that the
  entrails were streaming up behind it as it fell. No doubt the gases had
  buoyed it up in the higher reaches of the ocean until, having been released
  by putrefaction or by the ravages of sharks, there was nothing left but dead
  weight, which sent it hurtling down to the bottom of the sea. Already in our
  walk we had observed several of these great skeletons picked clean by the
  fish, but this creature was still, save for its disembowelment, even as it
  had lived. Our guides seized us with the intention of dragging us out of the
  path of the falling mass, but presently they were reassured and stood still,
  for it was clear that it would miss us. Our vitrine helmets prevented our
  hearing the thud, but it must have been prodigious when the huge body struck
  the floor of the ocean, and we saw the globigerina ooze fly upwards as the
  mud splashes when a heavy stone is hurled into it. It was a sperm whale, some
  seventy feet long, and from the excited and joyful gestures of the submarine
  folk I gathered that they would find plenty of use for the spermaceti and the
  fat. For the moment, however, we left the derelict creature, and with joyful
  hearts, for we unpractised visitors were weary and aching, found ourselves
  once more in front of the engraved portal of the roof, and finally standing
  safe and sound, divested of our vitrine bells, on the sloppy floor of the
  entrance chamber.</p>

  <p>A few days&mdash;as we reckon time&mdash;after the occasion when we had
  given the community a cinema view of our own proceedings, we were present at
  a very much more solemn and august exhibition of the same sort, which gave us
  in a clear and wonderful way the past history of this remarkable people. I
  cannot flatter myself that it was given entirely on our behalf, for I rather
  think that the events were publicly rehearsed from time to time in order to
  carry on the record, and that the part to which we were admitted was only
  some intermezzo of a long religious ceremony. However that may be, I will
  describe it exactly as it occurred.</p>

  <p>We were led to the same great hall or theatre where Dr. Maracot had thrown
  our own adventures upon the screen. There the whole community was assembled,
  and we were given, as before, places of honour in front of the great luminous
  screen. Then, after a long song, which may have been some sort of patriotic
  chant, a very old white-haired man, the historian or chronicler of the
  nation, advanced amid much applause to the focus point and threw upon the
  bright surface before him a series of pictures to represent the rise and fall
  of his own people. I wish I could convey to you their vividness and drama. My
  two companions and I lost all sense of time and place, so absorbed were we in
  the contemplation, while the audience was moved to its depths and groaned or
  wept as the tragedy unfolded, which depicted the ruin of their fatherland,
  the destruction of their race.</p>

  <p>In the first series of scenes we saw the old continent in its glory, as
  its memory had been handed down by these historical records passed from
  fathers to sons. We had a bird's-eye view of a glorious rolling country,
  enormous in extent, well watered and cleverly irrigated, with great fields of
  grain, waving orchards, lovely streams and woody hills, still lakes and
  occasional picturesque mountains. It was studded with villages and covered
  with farm- houses and beautiful private residences. Then our attention was
  carried to the capital, a wonderful and gorgeous city upon the sea-shore, the
  harbour crammed with galleys, her quays piled with merchandise, and her
  safety assured by high walls with towering battlements and circular moats,
  all on the most gigantic scale. The houses stretched inland for many miles,
  and in the centre of the city was a crenellated castle or citadel, so
  widespread and commanding that it was like some creation of a dream. We were
  then shown the faces of those who lived in that golden age, wise and
  venerable old men, virile warriors, saintly priests, beautiful and dignified
  women, lovely children, an apotheosis of the human race.</p>

  <p>Then came pictures of another sort. We saw wars, constant wars, war by
  land and war by sea. We saw naked and defenceless races trampled down and
  over- ridden by great chariots or the rush of mailed horsemen. We saw
  treasures heaped upon the victors, but even as the riches increased the faces
  upon the screen became more animal and more cruel. Down, down they sank from
  one generation to another. We were shown signs of lascivious dissipation or
  moral degeneracy, of the accretion of matter and decline of spirit. Brutal
  sports at the expense of others had taken the place of the manly exercises of
  old. There was no longer the quiet and simple family life, nor the
  cultivation of the mind, but we had a glimpse of a people who were restless
  and shallow, rushing from one pursuit to another, grasping ever at pleasure,
  for ever missing it, and yet imagining always that in some more complex and
  unnatural form it might still be found. There had arisen on the one hand an
  over-rich class who sought only sensual gratification, and on the other hand
  an over-poor residue whose whole function in life was to minister to the
  wants of their masters, however evil those wants might be.</p>

  <p>And now once again a new note was struck. There were reformers at work who
  were trying to turn the nation from its evil ways, and to direct it back into
  those higher paths which it had forsaken. We saw them, grave and earnest men,
  reasoning and pleading with the people, but we saw them scorned and jeered at
  by those whom they were trying to save. Especially we could see that it was
  the priests of Baal, priests who had gradually allowed forms and show and
  outward ceremonies to take the place of unselfish spiritual development, who
  led the opposition to the reformers. But the latter were not to be bullied or
  browbeaten. They continued to try for the salvation of the people, and their
  faces assumed a graver and even a terror-inspiring aspect, as those of men
  who had a fearsome warning to give which was like some dreadful vision before
  their own minds. Of their auditors some few seemed to heed and be terrified
  at the words, but others turned away laughing and plunged ever deeper into
  their morass of sin. There came a time at last when the reformers turned away
  also as men who could do no more, and left this degenerate people to its
  fate.</p>

  <p>Then we saw a strange sight. There was one reformer, a man of singular
  strength of mind and body, who gave a lead to all the others. He had wealth
  and influence and powers, which latter seemed to be not entirely of this
  earth. We saw him in what seemed to be a trance, communing with higher
  spirits. It was he who brought all the science of his land&mdash;science
  which far outshone anything known by us moderns&mdash;to the task of building
  an ark of refuge against the coming troubles. We saw myriads of workmen at
  work, and the walls rising while crowds of careless citizens looked on and
  made merry at such elaborate and useless precautions. We saw others who
  seemed to reason with him and to say to him that if he had fears it would be
  easier for him to fly to some safer land. His answer, so far as we could
  follow it, was that there were some who must be saved at the last moment, and
  that for their sake he must remain in the new Temple of safety. Meanwhile he
  collected in it those who had followed him, and he held them there, for he
  did not himself know the day nor the hour, though forces beyond mortal had
  assured him of the coming fact. So when the ark was ready and the water-tight
  doors were finished and tested, he waited upon doom, with his family, his
  friends, his followers, and his servants.</p>

  <p>And doom came. It was a terrible thing even in a picture. God knows what
  it could be like in reality. We first saw a huge sleek mountain of water rise
  to an incredible height out of a calm ocean. Then we saw it travel, sweeping
  on and on, mile after mile, a great glistening hill, topped with foam, at an
  ever- increasing rate. Two little ships tossing among the snowy fringe upon
  the summit became, as the wave rolled towards us, a couple of shattered
  galleys. Then we saw it strike the shore and sweep over the city, while the
  houses went down before it like a field of corn before a tornado. We saw the
  folk upon the house-tops glaring out at the approaching death, their faces
  twisted with horror, their eyes staring, their mouths contorted, gnawing at
  their hands and gibbering in an insanity of terror. The very men and women
  who had mocked at the warning were now screaming to Heaven for mercy,
  grovelling with their faces on the ground, or kneeling with frenzied arms
  raised in wild appeal. There was no time now to reach the ark, which stood
  beyond the city, but thousands dashed up to the Citadel, which stood upon
  higher ground, and the battlement walls were black with people. Then suddenly
  the Castle began to sink. Everything began to sink. The water had poured down
  into the remote recesses of the earth, the central fires had expanded it into
  steam, and the very foundations of the land were blown apart. Down went the
  city and ever down, while a cry went up from ourselves and the audience at
  the terrible sight. The pier broke in two and vanished. The high Pharus
  collapsed under the waves. The roofs looked for a while like successive reefs
  of rock forming lines of spouting breakers until they, too, went under.</p>

  <p>The Citadel was left alone upon the surface, like some monstrous ship, and
  then it also slid sideways down into the abyss, with a fringe of helpless
  waving hands upon its summit. The awful drama was over, and an unbroken sea
  lay across the whole continent, a sea which bore no life upon it, but which
  among its huge smoking swirls and eddies showed all the wrack of the tragedy
  tossed hither and thither, dead men and animals, chairs, tables, articles of
  clothing, floating hats and bales of goods, all bobbing and heaving in one
  huge liquid fermentation. Slowly we saw it die away, and a great wide expanse
  as smooth and bright as quicksilver, with a murky sun low on the horizon,
  showed us the grave of the land that God had weighed and found wanting.</p>

  <p>The story was complete. We could ask for no more, since our own brains and
  imagination could supply the rest. We realized the slow remorseless descent
  of that great land lower and lower into the abyss of the ocean amid volcanic
  convulsions which threw up submarine peaks around it. We saw it in our mind's
  eye stretched out, over miles of what was now the bed of the Atlantic, the
  shattered city lying alongside of the ark or refuge in which the handful of
  nerve-shattered survivors were assembled. And then finally we understood how
  these had carried on their lives, how they had used the various devices with
  which the foresight and science of their great leader had endowed them, how
  he had taught them all his arts before he passed away, and how some fifty or
  sixty survivors had grown now into a large community, which had to dig its
  way into the bowels of the earth in order to get room to expand. No library
  of information could make it clearer than that series of pictures and the
  inferences which we could draw from them. Such was the fate, and such the
  causes of the fate, which overwhelmed the great land of Atlantis. Some day
  far distant, when this bathybian ooze has turned to chalk, this great city
  will be thrown up once more by some fresh expiration of Nature, and the
  geologist of the future, delving in the quarry, will exhume not flints nor
  shells, but the remains of a vanished civilization, and the traces of an
  old-world catastrophe.</p>

  <p>Only one point had remained undecided, and that was the length of time
  since the tragedy had occurred. Dr. Maracot discovered a rough method of
  making an estimate. Among the many annexes of the great building there was
  one huge vault, which was the burial-place of the chiefs. As in Egypt and in
  Yucatan, the practice of mummifying had been usual, and in niches in the
  walls there were endless rows of these grim relics of the past. Manda pointed
  proudly to the next one in the succession, and gave us to understand that it
  was specially arranged for himself.</p>

  <p>'If you take an average of the European kings,' said Maracot, in his best
  professional manner, 'you will find that they run to above five in the
  century. We may adopt the same figure here. We cannot hope for scientific
  accuracy, but it will give us an approximation. I have counted the mummies,
  and they are four hundred in number.'</p>

  <p>'Then it would be eight thousand years?'</p>

  <p>'Exactly. And this agrees to some extent with Plato's estimate. It
  certainly occurred before the Egyptian written records begin, and they go
  back between six and seven thousand years from the present date. Yes, I think
  we may say that our eyes have seen the reproduction of a tragedy which
  occurred at least eight thousand years ago. But, of course, to build up such
  a civilization as we see the traces of, must in itself have taken many
  thousands of years.</p>

  <p>'Thus,' he concluded&mdash;and I pass the claim on to you&mdash;we have
  extended the horizon of ascertained human history as no men have ever done
  since history began.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was about a month, according to our calculations, after
  our visit to the buried city that the most amazing and unexpected thing of
  all occurred. We had thought by this time that we were immune to shocks and
  that nothing new could really stagger us, but this actual fact went far
  beyond anything for which our imagination might have prepared us.</p>

  <p>It was Scanlan who brought the news that something momentous had happened.
  You must realize that by this time we were, to some extent, at home in the
  great building; that we knew where the common rest rooms and recreation rooms
  were situated; that we attended concerts (their music was very strange and
  elaborate) and theatrical entertainments, where the unintelligible words were
  translated by very vivid and dramatic gestures; and that, speaking generally,
  we were part of the community. We visited various families in their own
  private rooms, and our lives&mdash;I can speak for my own, at any rate
  &mdash;were made the brighter by the glamour of these strange people,
  especially of that one dear young lady whose name I have already mentioned.
  Mona was the daughter of one of the leaders of the tribe, and I found in his
  family a warm and kindly welcome which rose above all differences of race or
  language. When it comes to the most tender language of all, I did not find
  that there was so much between old Atlantis and modern America. I guess that
  what would please a Massachusetts girl of Brown's College is just about what
  would please my lady under the waves.</p>

  <p>But I must get back to the fact that Scanlan came into our room with news
  of some great happening.</p>

  <p>'Say, there is one of them just blown in, and he's that excited that he
  clean forgot to take his glass lid off, and he was jabbering for some minutes
  before he understood that no one could hear him. Then it was Blah Blah Blah
  as long as his breath would hold, and they are all following him now to the
  jumping-off place. It's me for the water, for there is sure something worth
  our seeing.'</p>

  <p>Running out, we found our friends all hurrying down the corridor with
  excited gestures, and we, joining the procession, soon formed part of the
  crowd who were hurrying across the sea bottom, led by the excited messenger.
  They drove along at a rate which made it no easy matter for us to keep up,
  but they carried their electric lanterns with them, and even though we fell
  behind we were able to follow the gleam. The route lay as before, along the
  base of the basalt cliffs until we came to a spot where a set of steps,
  concave from long usage, led up to the top. Ascending these, we found
  ourselves in broken country, with many jagged pinnacles of rock and deep
  crevasses which made it difficult travelling. Emerging from this tangle of
  ancient lava, we came out on a circular plain, brilliant by the
  phosphorescent light, and there in the very centre of it lay an object which
  set me gasping. As I looked at my companions I could see from their amazed
  expression how fully they shared my emotion.</p>

  <p>Half embedded in the slime there lay a good-sized steamer. It was tilted
  upon its side, the funnel had broken and was hanging at a strange angle, and
  the foremast had snapped off short, but otherwise the vessel was intact and
  as clean and fresh as if she had just left the dock. We hurried towards her
  and found ourselves under the stern. You can imagine how we felt when we read
  the name '<i>Stratford</i>, London'. Our ship had followed ourselves into the
  Maracot Deep.</p>

  <p>Of course, after the first shock the affair did not seem so
  incomprehensible. We remembered the falling glass, the reefed sails of the
  experienced Norwegian skipper, the strange black cloud upon the horizon.
  Clearly there had been a sudden cyclone of phenomenal severity and the
  .<i>Stratford</i> had been blown over. It was too evident that all her people
  were dead, for most of the boats were trailing in different states of
  destruction from the davits, and in any case what boat could live in such a
  hurricane? The tragedy had occurred, no doubt, within an hour or two of our
  own disaster. Perhaps the sounding-line which we had seen had only just been
  wound in before the blow fell. It was terrible, but whimsical, that we should
  be still alive, while those who were mourning our destruction had themselves
  been destroyed. We had no means of telling whether the ship had drifted in
  the upper levels of the ocean or whether she had lain for some time where we
  found her before she was discovered by the Atlantean.</p>

  <p>Poor Howie, the captain, or what was left of him, was still at his post
  upon the bridge, the rail grasped firmly in his stiffened hands. His body and
  that of three stokers in the engine-room were the only ones which had sunk
  with the ship. They were each removed under our direction and buried under
  the ooze with a wreath of sea-flowers over their remains. I give this detail
  in the hope that it may be some comfort to Mrs. Howie in her bereavement. The
  names of the stokers were unknown to us.</p>

  <p>Whilst we had been performing this duty the little men had swarmed over
  the ship. Looking up, we saw them everywhere, like mice upon a cheese. Their
  excitement and curiosity made it clear to us that it was the first modern
  ship&mdash;possibly the first steamer&mdash;which had ever come down to them.
  We found out later that their oxygen apparatus inside their vitrine bells
  would not allow of a longer absence from the recharging station than a few
  hours, and so their chances of learning anything of what was on the sea-bed
  were limited to so many miles from their central base. They set to work at
  once breaking up the wreck and removing all that would be of use to them, a
  very long process, which is hardly accomplished yet. We were glad also to
  make our way to our cabins and to get many of those articles of clothing and
  books which were not ruined beyond redemption.</p>

  <p>Among the other things which we rescued from the <i>Stratford</i> was the
  ship's log, which had been written up to the last day by the captain in view
  of our own catastrophe. It was strange indeed that we should be reading it
  and that he should be dead. The day's entry ran thus:</p>

  <p>'Oct. 3. The three brave but foolhardy adventurers have today, against my
  will and advice, descended in their apparatus to the bottom of the ocean, and
  the accident which I had foreseen has occurred. God rest their souls. They
  went down at eleven a.m. and I had some doubts about permitting them, as a
  squall seemed to be coming up. I would that I had acted upon my impulse, but
  it would only have postponed the inevitable tragedy. I bade each of them
  farewell with the conviction that I would see them no more. For a time all
  was well, and at eleven forty-five they had reached a depth of three hundred
  fathoms, where they had found bottom. Dr. Maracot sent several messages to me
  and all seemed to be in order, when suddenly I heard his voice in agitation,
  and there was considerable agitation of the wire hawser. An instant later it
  snapped. It would appear that they were by this time over a deep chasm, for
  at the Doctor's request the ship had steamed very slowly forwards. The air
  tubes continued to run out for a distance which I should estimate at half a
  mile, and then they also snapped. It is the last which we can ever hope to
  hear of Dr. Maracot, Mr. Headley, or Mr. Scanlan.</p>

  <p>'And yet a most extraordinary thing must be recorded, the meaning of which
  I have not had time to weigh, for with this foul weather coming up there is
  much to distract me. A deep-sea sounding was taken at the same time, and the
  depth recorded was twenty-six thousand six hundred feet. The weight was, of
  course, left at the bottom, but the wire has just been drawn in and,
  incredible as it may seem, above the porcelain sample cup there was found Mr.
  Headley's handkerchief with his name marked upon it. The ship's company were
  all amazed, and no one can suggest how such a thing could have occurred. In
  my next entry I may have more to say about this. We have lingered a few hours
  in the hope of something coming to the surface, and we have pulled up the
  hawser, which shows a jagged end. Now I must look to the ship, for I have
  never seen a worse sky and the barometer is at a8.5 and sinking fast.'</p>

  <p>So it was that we got the final news of our former companions. A terrific
  cyclone must have struck her and destroyed her immediately afterwards.</p>

  <p>We stayed at the wreck until a certain stuffiness within our vitrine bells
  and a feeling of increasing weight upon our chests warned us that it was high
  time to begin our return. Then it was, on our homeward journey, that we had
  an adventure which showed us the sudden dangers to which these submarine folk
  are exposed, and which may explain why their numbers, in spite of the lapse
  of time, were not greater than they were. Including the Grecian slaves we
  cannot reckon those numbers at more than four or five thousand at the most.
  We had descended the staircase and were making our way along the edge of the
  jungle which skirts the basalt cliffs, when Manda pointed excitedly upwards
  and beckoned furiously to one of our party who was some distance out in the
  open. At the same time he and those around him ran to the side of some high
  boulders, pulling us along with them. It was only when we were in their
  shelter that we saw the cause of the alarm. Some distance above us, but
  descending rapidly, was a huge fish of a most peculiar shape. It might have
  been a great floating feather-bed, soft and bulging, with a white
  under-surface and a long red fringe, the vibration of which propelled it
  through the water. It appeared to have neither mouth nor eyes, but it soon
  showed that it was formidably alert. The member of our party who was out in
  the open ran for the same shelter that we had taken, but he was too late. I
  saw his face convulsed with terror as he realized his fate.</p>

  <p>The horrible creature descended upon him, enveloped him on all sides, and
  lay upon him, pulsing in a dreadful way as if it were thrusting his body
  against the coral rocks and grinding it to pieces. The tragedy was taking
  place within a few yards of us, and yet our companions were so overcome by
  the suddenness of it that they seemed to be bereft of all power of action. It
  was Scanlan who rushed out and, jumping on the creature's broad back,
  blotched with red and brown markings, dug the sharp end of his metal staff
  into its soft tissues.</p>

  <p>I had followed Scanlan's example, and finally Maracot and all of them
  attacked the monster, which glided slowly off, leaving a trail of oily and
  glutinous excretion behind it. Our help had come too late, however, for the
  impact of the great fish had broken the vitrine bell of the Atlantean and he
  had been drowned. It was a day of mourning when we carried his body back into
  the Refuge, but it was also a day of triumph for us, for our prompt action
  had raised us greatly in the estimation of our companions. As to the strange
  fish, we had Dr. Maracot's assurance that it was a specimen of the blanket
  fish, well known to ichthyologists, but of a size such as had never entered
  into his dreams.</p>

  <p>I speak of this creature because it chanced to bring about a tragedy, but
  I could, and perhaps will, write a book upon the wonderful life which we have
  seen here. Red and black are the prevailing colours in deep-sea life, while
  the vegetation is of the palest olive, and is of so tough a fibre that it is
  seldom dragged up by our trawls, so that Science has come to believe that the
  bed of the ocean is bare. Many of the marine forms are of surpassing
  loveliness, and others so grotesque in their horror that they are like the
  images of delirium and of a danger such as no land animal can rival. I have
  seen a black sting-ray thirty feet long with a horrible fang upon its tail,
  one blow of which would kill any living creature. I have seen, too, a
  frog-like beast with protruding green eyes, which is simply a gaping mouth
  with a huge stomach behind it. To meet it is death unless one has an electric
  flash with which to repel it. I have seen the blind red eel which lies among
  the rocks and kills by the emission of poison, and I have seen also the giant
  sea-scorpion, one of the terrors of the deep, and the hag fish, which lurks
  among the sea jungle.</p>

  <p>Once, too, it was my privilege to see the real sea-serpent, a creature
  which has seldom appeared before the human eye, for it lives in the extreme
  depths and is seen on the surface only when some submarine convulsion has
  driven it out of its haunts. Two of them swam, or rather glided, past us one
  day while Mona and I cowered among the bunches of lamellaria. They were
  enormous&mdash;some ten feet in height and two hundred in length, black
  above, silver-white below, with a high fringe upon the back, and small eyes
  no larger than those of an ox. Of these and many other such things an account
  will be found in the paper of Dr. Maracot, should it ever reach your
  hands.</p>

  <p>Week glided into week in our new life. It had become a very pleasant one,
  and we were slowly picking up enough of this long-forgotten tongue to enable
  us to converse a little with our companions. There were endless subjects both
  for study and for amusement in the Refuge, and already Maracot has mastered
  so much of the old chemistry that he declares that he can revolutionize all
  worldly ideas if he can only transmit his knowledge. Among other things they
  have learned to split the atom, and though the energy released is less than
  our scientists had anticipated, it is still sufficient to supply them with a
  great reservoir of power. Their acquaintance with the power and nature of the
  ether is also far ahead of ours, and indeed that strange translation of
  thought into pictures, by which we had told them our story and they theirs,
  was due to an etheric impression translated back into terms of matter.</p>

  <p>And yet, in spite of their knowledge, there were points connected with
  modern scientific developments which had been overlooked by their
  ancestors.</p>

  <p>It was left to Scanlan to demonstrate the fact. For weeks he was in a
  state of suppressed excitement, bursting with some great secret, and
  chuckling continually at his own thoughts. We only saw him occasionally
  during this time, for he was extremely busy and his one friend and confidant
  was a fat and jovial Atlantean named Berbrix, who was in charge of some of
  the machinery. Scanlan and Berbrix, though their intercourse was carried on
  chiefly by signs and mutual back-slapping, had become very close friends, and
  were now continually closeted together. One evening Scanlan came in
  radiant.</p>

  <p>'Look here, Doc,' he said to Maracot, 'I've a dope of my own that I want
  to hand to these folk. They've shown us a thing or two and I figure that it
  is up to us to return it. What's the matter with calling them together
  tomorrow night for a show?'</p>

  <p>'Jazz or the Charleston?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Charleston nothing. Wait till you see it. Man, it's the greatest stunt
  &mdash;but there, I won't say a word more. Just this, Bo. I won't let you
  down, for I've got the goods, and I mean to deliver them.'</p>

  <p>Accordingly, the community were assembled next evening in the familiar
  hall. Scanlan and Berbrix were on the platform, beaming with pride. One or
  other of them touched a button, and then&mdash;well, to use Scanlan's own
  language, 'I hand it to him, for he did surprise us some!'</p>

  <p>'2L.O. calling,' cried a clear voice. 'London calling the British Isles.
  Weather forecast.' Then followed the usual sentence about depressions and
  anticyclones. 'First News Bulletin. His Majesty the King this morning opened
  the new wing of the Children's Hospital in Hammersmith&mdash;' and so on and
  on, in the familiar strain. For the first time we were back in a workaday
  England once more, plodding bravely through its daily task, with its stout
  back bowed under its war debts. Then we heard the foreign news, the sporting
  news. The old world was droning on the same as ever. Our friends the
  Atlanteans listened in amazement, but without comprehension. When, however,
  as the first item after the news, the Guards' band struck up the march from
  Lohengrin a positive shout of delight broke from the people, and it was funny
  to see them rush upon the platform, and turn over the curtains, and look
  behind the screens to find the source of the music. Yes, we have left our
  mark for ever upon the submarine civilization.</p>

  <p>'No, sir,' said Scanlan, afterwards. 'I could not make an issuing station.
  They have not the material, and I have not the brains. But down at home I
  rigged a two-valve set of my own with the aerial beside the clothes line in
  the yard, and I learned to handle it, and to pick up any station in the
  States. It seemed to me funny if, with all this electricity to hand, and with
  their glasswork ahead of ours, we couldn't vamp up something that would catch
  an ether wave, and a wave would sure travel through water just as easy as
  through air. Old Berbrix nearly threw a fit when we got the first call, but
  he is wise to it now, and I guess it's a permanent institution.'</p>

  <p>Among the discoveries of the Atlantean chemists is a gas which is nine
  times lighter than hydrogen and which Maracot has named levigen. It was his
  experiments with this which gave us the idea of sending glass balls with
  information as to our fate to the surface of the ocean.</p>

  <p>'I have made Manda understand the idea,' said he. 'He has given orders to
  the silica workers, and in a day or two the globes will be ready.'</p>

  <p>'But how can we get our news inside?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'There is a small aperture left through which the gas is inserted. Into
  this we can push the papers. Then these skilful workers can seal up the hole.
  I am assured that when we release them they will shoot up to the
  surface.'</p>

  <p>'And bob about unseen for a year.'</p>

  <p>'That might be. But the ball would reflect the sun's rays. It would surely
  attract attention. We were on the line of shipping between Europe and South
  America. I see no reason why, if we send several, one at least may not be
  found.'</p>

  <p>And this, my dear Talbot, or you others who read this narrative, is how it
  comes into your hands. But a far more fateful scheme may lie behind it. The
  idea came from the fertile brain of the American mechanic.</p>

  <p>'Say friends,' said he, as we sat alone in our chamber, 'it's dandy down
  here, and the drink is good and the eats are good, and I've met a wren that
  makes anything in Philadelphia look like two cents, but all the same there
  are times when I want to feel that I might see God's own country once
  more.'</p>

  <p>'We may all feel that way,' said I, 'but I don't see how you can hope to
  make it.'</p>

  <p>'Look it here, Bo! If these balls of gas could carry up our message, maybe
  they could carry us up also. Don't think I'm joshing, for I've figured it out
  to. rights. We will suppose we put three or four of them together so as to
  get a good lift. See? Then we have our vitrine bells on and harness ourselves
  on to the balls. When the bell rings we cut loose and up we go. What is going
  to stop us between here and the surface?'</p>

  <p>'A shark, maybe.'</p>

  <p>'Blah! Sharks nothing! We would streak past any shark so's he'd hardly
  know we was there. He'd think we was three flashes of light and we'd get such
  a lick on that we'd shoot fifty feet up in the air at the other end. I tell
  you the goof that sees us come up is going to say his prayers over it.'</p>

  <p>'But suppose it is possible, what will happen afterwards!'</p>

  <p>'For Pete's sake, leave afterwards out of it! Let us chance our luck, or
  we are here for keeps. It's me for cutting loose and having a dash at
  it.'</p>

  <p>'I certainly greatly desire to return to the world, if only to lay our
  results before the learned societies,' said Maracot. 'It is only my personal
  influence which can make them realize the fund of new knowledge which I have
  acquired. I should be quite in favour of any such attempt as Scanlan has
  indicated.'</p>

  <p>There were good reasons, as I will tell later, which made me the least
  eager of the three.</p>

  <p>'It would be perfect madness as you propose it. Unless we had someone
  expecting us on the surface we should infallibly drift about and perish from
  hunger and thirst.'</p>

  <p>'Shucks, man, how could we have someone expecting us?'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps even that could be managed,' said Maracot. 'We can give within a
  mile or two the exact latitude and longitude of our position.'</p>

  <p>'And they would let down a ladder,' said I, with some bitterness.</p>

  <p>'Ladder nothing! The boss is right. See here, Mr. Headley, you put in that
  letter that you are going to send the universe&mdash;my! don't I see the
  scare lines in the journals!&mdash;that we are at 27 North Latitude and 28.14
  West Longitude, or whatever other figure is the right one, Got that? Then you
  say that three of the most important folk in history, the great man of
  Science, Maracot, and the rising-star bug-collector, Headley, and Bob
  Scanlan, a peach of a mechanic and the pride of Merribank's; are all yellin'
  and whoopin' for help from the bottom of the sea. Follow my idea?'</p>

  <p>'Well, what then?'</p>

  <p>'Well, then it's up to them, you see. It's kind of a challenge that they
  can't forget. Same as I've read of Stanley finding Livingstone and the like.
  It's for them to find some way to yank us out or to catch us at the other end
  if we can take the jump ourselves.'</p>

  <p>'We could suggest the way ourselves,' said the Professor. 'Let them drop a
  deep-sea line into these waters and we will look out for it. When it comes we
  can tie a message to it and bid them stand by for us.'</p>

  <p>'You've said a mouthful!' cried Bob Scanlan. 'That is sure the way to do
  it.'</p>

  <p>'And if any lady cared to share our fortunes four would be as easy as
  three,' said Maracot, with a roguish smile at me.</p>

  <p>'For that matter, five is as easy as four,' said Scanlan. 'But you've got
  it now, Mr. Headley. You write that down, and in six months we shall be back
  in London River once more.'</p>

  <p>So now we launch our two balls into that water which is to us what the air
  is to you. Our two little balloons will go aloft. Will both be lost on the
  way? It is possible. Or may we hope that one will get through? We leave it on
  the knees of the gods. If nothing can be done for us, then let those who care
  for us know that in any case we are safe and happy. If, on the other hand,
  this suggestion could be carried out and the money and energy for our rescue
  should be forthcoming, we have given you the means by which it can be done.
  Meanwhile, good-bye&mdash;or is it au revoir?</p>

  <p>So ended the narrative in the vitrine ball.</p>

  <p>The preceding narrative covers the facts so far as they were available
  when the account was first drawn up. While the script was in the hands of the
  printer there came an epilogue of the most unexpected and sensational
  description. I refer to the rescue of the adventurers by Mr. Faverger's steam
  yacht Marion and the account sent out by the wireless transmitter of that
  vessel, and picked up by the cable station at the Cape de Verde Islands,
  which has just forwarded it to Europe and America. This account was drawn up
  by Mr. Key Osborne, the well-known representative of the Associated
  Press.</p>

  <p>It would appear that immediately upon the first narrative of the plight of
  Dr. Maracot and his friends reaching Europe an expedition was quietly and
  effectively fitted up in the hope of bringing about a rescue. Mr. Faverger
  generously placed his famous steam yacht at the disposal of the party, which
  he accompanied in person. The Marion sailed from Cherbourg in June, picked up
  Mr. Key Osborne and a motion-picture operator at Southampton, and set forth
  at once for the tract of ocean which was indicated in the original document.
  This was reached upon the first of July.</p>

  <p>A deep-sea piano-wire line was lowered, and was dragged slowly along the
  bottom of the ocean. At the end of this line, beside the heavy lead, there
  was suspended a bottle containing a message. The message ran:</p>

  <p>'Your account has been received by the world, and we are here to help you.
  We duplicate this message by our wireless transmitter in the hope that it may
  reach you. We will slowly traverse your region. When you have detached this
  bottle, please replace your own message in it. We will act upon your
  instructions.'</p>

  <p>For two days the Marion cruised slowly to and fro without result. On the
  third a very great surprise awaited the rescue party. A small, highly
  luminous ball shot out of the water a few hundred yards from the ship, and
  proved to be a vitreous message-bearer of the sort which had been described
  in the original document. Having been broken with some difficulty, the
  following message was read:</p>

  <p>'Thanks, dear friends. We greatly appreciate your grand loyalty and
  energy. We receive your wireless messages with facility, and are in a
  position to answer you in this fashion. We have endeavoured to get possession
  of your line, but the currents lift it high, and it sweeps along rather
  faster than even the most active of us can move against the resistance of the
  water. We propose to make our venture at six tomorrow morning, which should,
  according to our reckoning, be Tuesday, July 5th. We will come one at a time,
  so that any advice arising from our experience can be wirelessed back to
  those who come later. Once again heartfelt thanks.</p>

  <p>Maracot. Headley. Scanlan.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Key Osborne now takes up the narrative:</p>

  <p>'It was a perfect morning, and the deep sapphire sea lay as smooth as a
  lake, with the glorious arch of the deep blue sky unbroken by the smallest
  cloud. The whole crew of the Marion was early astir, and awaited events with
  the most tense interest. As the hour of six drew near our anticipation was
  painful. A look-out had been placed upon our signal mast, and it was just
  five minutes to the hour when we heard him shouting, and saw him pointing to
  the water on our port bow. We all crowded to that side of the deck, and I was
  able to perch myself on one of the boats, from which I had a clear view. I
  saw through the still water something which looked like a silver bubble
  ascending with great rapidity from the depths of the ocean. It broke the
  surface about two hundred yards from the ship, and soared straight up into
  the air, a beautiful shining globe some three feet in diameter, rising to a
  great height and then drifting away in some slight current of wind exactly as
  a toy balloon would do. It was a marvellous sight, but it filled us with
  apprehension, for it seemed as if the harness might have come loose, and the
  burden which this tractor should have borne through the waters had been
  shaken loose upon the way. A wireless was at once dispatched:</p>

  <p>"'Your messenger has appeared close to the vessel. It had nothing attached
  and has flown away." Meanwhile we lowered a boat so as to be ready for any
  development.</p>

  <p>'Just after six o'clock there was another signal from our watchman, and an
  instant later I caught sight of another silver globe, which was swimming up
  from the depths very much more slowly than the last. On reaching the surface
  it floated in the air, but its burden was supported upon the water. This
  burden proved upon examination to be a great bundle of books, papers, and
  miscellaneous objects all wrapped in a casing of fish skin. It was hoisted
  dripping upon the deck, and was acknowledged by wireless, while we eagerly
  awaited the next arrival.</p>

  <p>'This was not long in coming. Again the silver bubble, again the breaking
  of the surface, but this time the glistening ball shot high into the air,
  suspending under it, to our amazement, the slim figure of a woman. It was but
  the impetus which had carried her into the air, and an instant later she had
  been towed to the side of the vessel. A leather circlet had been firmly
  fastened round the upper curve of the glass ball, and from this long straps
  depended which were attached to a broad leather belt round her dainty waist.
  The upper part of her body was covered by a peculiar pear-shaped glass shade
  &mdash;I call it glass, but it was of the same tough light material as the
  vitreous ball. It was almost transparent, with silvery veins running through
  its substance. This glass covering had tight elastic attachments at the waist
  and shoulders, which made it perfectly watertight, while it was provided
  within, as has been described in Headley's original manuscript, with novel
  but very light and practical chemical apparatus for the renovation of air.
  With some difficulty the breathing bell was removed and the lady hoisted upon
  deck. She lay there in a deep faint, but her regular breathing encouraged us
  to think that she would soon recover from the effects of her rapid journey
  and from the change of pressure, which had been minimized by the fact that
  the density of the air inside the protective sheath was considerably higher
  than our atmosphere, so that it may be said to have represented that half-way
  point at which human divers are wont to pause.</p>

    <p class="caption">The glistening ball shot high into the air,
    suspending<br>
    under it, to our amazement, the slim figure of a woman.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>'Presumably this is the Atlantean woman referred to in the first message
  as Mona, and if we may take her as a sample they are indeed a race worth
  reintroducing to earth. She is dark in complexion, beautifully clear-cut and
  high-bred in feature, with long black hair, and magnificently hazel eyes
  which looked round her presently in a charming amazement. Sea-shells and
  mother-of- pearl were worked into her cream-coloured tunic, and tangled in
  her dark hair. A more perfect Naiad of the Deep could not be imagined, the
  very personification of the mystery and the glamour of the sea. We could see
  complete consciousness coming back into those marvellous eyes, and then she
  sprang suddenly to her feet with the activity of a young doe and ran to the
  side of the vessel. "Cyrus! Cyrus!" she cried.</p>

  <p>'We had already removed the anxiety of those below by a wireless. But now
  in quick succession each of them arrived, shooting thirty or forty feet into
  the air, and then falling back into the sea, from which we quickly raised
  them. All three were unconscious, and Scanlan was bleeding at the nose and
  ears, but within an hour all were able to totter to their feet: The first
  action of each was, I imagine, characteristic. Scanlan was led off by a
  laughing group to the bar, from which shouts of merriment are now resounding,
  much to the detriment of this composition. Dr. Maracot seized the bundle of
  papers, tore out one which consisted entirely, so far as I could judge, of
  algebraic symbols, and disappeared downstairs, while Cyrus Headley ran to the
  side of his strange maiden, and looks, by last reports, as if he had no
  intention of ever quitting it. Thus the matter stands, and we trust our weak
  wireless will carry our message as far as the Cape de Verde station. The
  fuller details of this wonderful adventure will come later, as is fitting,
  from the adventurers themselves.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE are very many people who have written both to me,
  Cyrus Headley, Rhodes Scholar of Oxford, and to Professor Maracot, and even
  to Bill Scanlan, since our very remarkable experience at the bottom of the
  Atlantic, where we were able at a point 200 miles south-west of the Canaries
  to make a submarine descent which has not only led to a revision of our views
  concerning deep-sea life and pressures, but has also established the survival
  of an old civilization under incredibly difficult conditions. In these
  letters we have been continually asked to give further details about our
  experiences. It will be understood that my original document was a very
  superficial one, and yet it covered most of the facts. There were some,
  however, which were withheld, and above all the tremendous episode of the
  Lords of the Dark Face. This involved some facts and some conclusions of so
  utterly extraordinary a nature that we all thought it was best to suppress it
  entirely for the present. Now, however, that Science has accepted our
  conclusions&mdash;and I may add since Society has accepted my bride&mdash;our
  general veracity is established and we may perhaps venture upon a narrative
  which might have repulsed public sympathy in the first instance.</p>

  <p>Before I get to the one tremendous happening I would lead up to it by some
  reminiscences of those wonderful months in the buried home of the Atlanteans,
  who by means of their vitrine oxygen bells are able to walk the ocean floor
  with the same ease as those Londoners whom I see now from my windows in the
  Hyde Park Hotel are strolling among the flower-beds.</p>

  <p>When first we were taken in by these people after our dreadful fall from
  the surface we were in the position of prisoners rather than of guests. I
  wish now to set upon record how this came to change and how through the
  splendour of Dr. Maracot we have left such a name down there that the memory
  of us will go down in their annals as of some celestial visitation. They knew
  nothing of our leaving, which they would certainly have prevented if they
  could, so that no doubt there is already a legend that we have returned to
  some heavenly sphere, taking with us the sweetest and choicest flower of
  their flock.</p>

  <p>I would wish now to set down in their order some of the strange things of
  this wonderful world, and also some of the adventures which befell us until I
  came to the supreme adventure of all&mdash;one which will leave a mark upon
  each of us for ever&mdash;the coming of the Lord of the Dark Face. In some
  ways I wish that we could have stayed longer in the Maracot Deep for there
  were many mysteries there, and up to the end there were things which we could
  not understand. Also we were rapidly learning something of their language, so
  that soon we should have had much more information.</p>

  <p>Experience had taught these people what was terrible and what was
  innocent. One day, I remember, that there was a sudden alarm and that we all
  ran out in our oxygen bells on to the ocean bed, though why we ran or what we
  meant to do was a mystery to us. There could be no mistake, however, as to
  the horror and distraction upon the faces of those around us. When we got out
  on to the plain we met a number of the Greek coal-workers who were hastening
  towards the door of our Colony. They had come at such a pace, and were so
  weary that they kept falling down in the ooze, and it was clear that we were
  really a rescue party for the purpose of picking up these cripples, and
  hurrying up the laggards. We saw no sign of weapons and no show of resistance
  against the coming danger. Soon the colliers were hustled along, and when the
  last one had been shoved through the door we looked back along the line that
  they had traversed. All that we could see was a couple of greenish wisp-like
  clouds, luminous in the centre and ragged at the edges, which were drifting
  rather than moving in our direction. At the clear sight of them, though they
  were quite half a mile away, my companions were filled with panic and beat at
  the door so as to get in the sooner. It was surely nervous work to see these
  mysterious centres of trouble draw nearer, but the pumps acted swiftly and we
  were soon in safety once more. There was a great block of transparent
  crystal, ten feet long and two feet broad, above the lintel of the door, with
  lights so arranged that they threw a strong glare outside. Mounted on the
  ladders kept for the purpose, several of us, including myself, looked through
  this rude window. I saw the strange shimmering green circles of light pause
  before the door. As they did so the Atlanteans on either side of me simply
  gibbered with fear. Then one of the shadowy creatures outside came flicking
  up through the water and made for our crystal window. Instantly my companions
  pulled me down below the level of vision, but it seems that in my
  carelessness some of my hair did not get clear from whatever the maleficent
  influence may be which these strange creatures send forth. There is a patch
  there which is withered and white to this day.</p>

  <p>It was not for a long time that the Atlanteans dared to open their door,
  and when at last a scout was sent forth he went amid hand-shakings and slaps
  on the back as one who does a gallant deed. His report was that all was
  clear, and soon joy had returned to the community, and this strange
  visitation seemed to have been forgotten. We only gathered from the word
  'Praxa', repeated in various tones of horror, that this was the name of the
  creature. The only person who derived real joy from the incident was
  Professor Maracot, who could hardly be restrained from sallying out with a
  small net and a glass vase. 'A new order of life, partly organic, partly
  gaseous, but clearly intelligent,' was his general comment. 'A freak out of
  Hell,' was Scanlan's less scientific description.</p>

  <p>Two days afterwards, when we were out on what we called a shrimping
  expedition, when we walked among the deep-sea foliage and captured in our
  hand- nets specimens of the smaller fish, we came suddenly upon the body of
  one of the coal-workers, who had no doubt been overtaken in his flight by
  these strange creatures. The glass bell had been broken&mdash;a matter which
  called for enormous strength, for this vitrine substance is extraordinarily
  tough, as you realized when you attempted to reach my first documents. The
  man's eyes had been torn out, but otherwise he had been uninjured.</p>

  <p>'A dainty feeder!' said the Professor after our return. 'There is a hawk
  parrot in New Zealand which will kill the lamb in order to get at a
  particular morsel of fat above the kidney. So this creature will slay the man
  for his eyes. In the heavens above and in the waters below Nature knows but
  one law, and it is, alas! remorseless cruelty.'</p>

  <p>We had many examples of that terrible law down there in the depths of the
  ocean. I can remember, for example, that many times we observed a curious
  groove upon the soft bathybian mud, as if a barrel had been rolled along it.
  We pointed it out to our Atlantean companions, and when we could interrogate
  them we tried to get from them some account of what this creature could be.
  As to its name our friends gave some of those peculiar clicking sounds which
  come into the Atlantean speech, and which cannot be reproduced either by the
  European tongue or by the European alphabet. Krixchok is, perhaps, an
  approximation to it. But as to its appearance we could always in such cases
  make use of the Atlantean thought reflector by which our friends were able to
  give a very clear vision of whatever was in their own minds. By this means
  they conveyed to us a picture of a very strange marine creature which the
  Professor could only classify as a gigantic sea slug. It seemed to be of
  great size, sausage shaped with eyes at the ends of stems, and a thick
  coating of coarse hair or bristles. When showing this apparition, our friends
  by their gestures expressed the greatest horror and repulsion.</p>

  <p>But this, as anyone could predicate who knew Maracot, only served to
  inflame his scientific passions and to make him the more eager to determine
  the exact species and sub-species of this unknown monster. Accordingly I was
  not surprised when, on the occasion of our next excursion, he stopped at the
  point where we clearly saw the mark of the brute upon the slime, and turned
  deliberately towards the tangle of seaweed and basaltic blocks out of which
  it seemed to have come. The moment we left the plain the traces of course
  ceased, and yet there seemed to be a natural gully amid the rocks which
  clearly led to the den of the monster. We were all three armed with the pikes
  which the Atlanteans usually carried, but they seemed to me to be frail
  things with which to face unknown dangers. The Professor trudged ahead,
  however, and we could but follow after.</p>

  <p>The rocky gorge ran upwards, its sides formed of huge clusters of volcanic
  debris and draped with a profusion of the long red and black forms of
  lamellaria which are characteristic of the extreme depths of Ocean. A
  thousand beautiful ascidians and echinoderms of every joyous colour and
  fantastic shape peeped out from amid this herbage, which was alive with
  strange crustaceans and low forms of creeping life. Our progress was slow,
  for walking is never easy in the depths, and the angle up which we toiled was
  an acute one. Suddenly, however, we saw the creature whom we hunted, and the
  sight was not a reassuring one.</p>

  <p>It was half protruded from its lair, which was a hollow in a basaltic
  pile. About five feet of hairy body was visible, and we perceived its eyes,
  which were as large as saucers, yellow in colour, and glittering like agates,
  moving round slowly upon their long pedicles as it heard the sound of our
  approach. Then slowly it began to unwind itself from its burrow, waving its
  heavy body along in caterpillar fashion. Once it reared up its head some four
  feet from the rocks, so as to have a better look at us, and I observed, as it
  did so, that it had what looked like the corrugated soles of tennis shoes
  fastened on either side of its neck, the same colour, size, and striped
  appearance. What this might mean I could not conjecture, but we were soon to
  have an object lesson in their use.</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The Professor had braced himself with his pike projecting forward and a
  most determined expression upon his face. It was clear that the hope of a
  rare specimen had swept all fear from his mind. Scanlan and I were by no
  means so sure of ourselves, but we could not abandon the old man, so we stood
  our ground on either side of him.</p>

  <p>The creature, after that one long stare, began slowly and clumsily to make
  its way down the slope, worming its path among the rocks, and raising its
  pedicled eyes from time to time to see what we were about. It came so slowly
  that we seemed safe enough, since we could always out-distance it. And yet,
  had we only known it, we were standing very near to death.</p>

  <p>It was surely Providence that sent us our warning. The beast was still
  making its lumbering approach, and may have been sixty yards from us, when a
  very large fish, a deep-sea groper, shot out from the algae-jungle on our
  side of the gorge and swam slowly across it. It had reached the centre, and
  was about midway between the creature and ourselves when it gave a convulsive
  leap, turned belly upwards, and sank dead to the bottom of the ravine. At the
  same moment each of us felt an extraordinary and most unpleasant tingling
  pass over our whole bodies, while our knees seemed to give way beneath us.
  Old Maracot was as wary as he was audacious, and in an instant he had sized
  up the situation and realized that the game was up. We were faced by some
  creature which threw out electric waves to kill its prey, and our pikes were
  of no more use against it than against a machine-gun. Had it not been for the
  lucky chance that the fish drew its fire, we should have waited until it was
  near enough to loose off its full battery, which would infallibly have
  destroyed us. We blundered off as swiftly as we could, with the resolution to
  leave the giant electric sea-worm severely alone for the future.</p>

  <p>These were some of the more terrible of the dangers of the deep.. Yet
  another was the little black Hydrops ferox, as the Professor named him. He
  was a red fish not much longer than a herring, with a large mouth and a
  formidable row of teeth. He was harmless in ordinary circumstances, but the
  shedding of blood, even the very smallest amount of it, attracted him in an
  instant, and there was no possible salvation for the victim, who was torn to
  pieces by swarms of attackers. We saw a horrible sight once at the colliery
  pits, where a slave worker had the misfortune to cut his hand. In an instant,
  coming from all quarters, thousands of these fish were on to him. In vain he
  threw himself down and struggled; in vain his horrified companions beat them
  away with their picks and shovels. The lower part of him, beneath his bell,
  dissolved before our eyes amid the cloud of vibrant life which surrounded
  him. One instant we saw a man. The next there was a red mass with white
  protruding bones. A minute later the bones only were left below the waist and
  half a clean-picked skeleton was lying at the bottom of the sea. The sight
  was so horrifying that we were all ill, and the hard-boiled Scanlan actually
  fell down in a faint and we had some difficulty in getting him home.</p>

  <p>But the strange sights which we saw were not always horrifying. I have in
  mind one which will never fade from our memory. It was on one of those
  excursions which we delighted to take, sometimes with an Atlantean guide, and
  sometimes by ourselves when our hosts had learned that we did not need
  constant attendance and nursing. We were passing over a portion of the plain
  with which we were quite familiar, when we perceived, to our surprise, that a
  great patch of light yellow sand, half an acre or so in extent, had been laid
  down or uncovered since our last visit. We were standing in some surprise,
  wondering what submarine current or seismic movement could have brought this
  about, when to our absolute amazement the whole thing rose up and swam with
  slow undulations immediately above our heads. It was so huge that the great
  canopy took some appreciable time, a minute or two, to pass from over us. It
  was a gigantic flat fish, not different, so far as the Professor could
  observe, from one of our own little dabs, but grown to this enormous size
  upon the nutritious food which the bathybian deposits provide. It vanished
  away into the darkness above us, a great, glimmering, flickering white
  &mdash;and yellow expanse, and we saw it no more.</p>

  <p>There was one other phenomenon of the deep sea which was very unexpected.
  That was the tornadoes which frequently occur. They seem to be caused by the
  periodical arrival of violent submarine currents which set in with little
  warning and are terrific while they last, causing as much confusion and
  destruction as the highest wind would do upon land. No doubt without these
  visitations there would be that putridity and stagnation which absolute
  immobility must give, so that, as in all Nature's processes, there was an
  excellent object in view; but the experience none the less was an alarming
  one.</p>

  <p>On the first occasion when I was caught in such a watery cyclone, I had
  gone out with that very dear lady to whom I have alluded, Mona, the daughter
  of Manda. There was a very beautiful bank loaded with algae of a thousand
  varied colours which lay a mile or so from the Colony. This was Mona's very
  special garden which she greatly loved, a tangle of pink serpularia, purple
  ophiurids and red holothurians. On this day she had taken me to see it, and
  it was while we were standing before it that the storm burst. So strong was
  the current which suddenly flowed upon us that it was only by holding
  together and getting behind the shelter of rocks that we could save ourselves
  from being washed away. I observed that this rushing stream of water was
  quite warm, almost as warm as one could bear, which may show that there is a
  volcanic origin in these disturbances and that they are the wash from some
  submarine disturbance in some far-off region of the ocean bed. The mud of the
  great plain was stirred up by the rush of the current, and the light was
  darkened by the thick cloud of matter suspended in the water around us. To
  find our way back was impossible, for we had lost all sense of direction, and
  in any case could hardly move against the rush of the water. Then on the top
  of all else a slowly increasing heaviness of the chest and difficulty in
  breathing warned me that our oxygen supply was beginning to fail us.</p>

  <p>It is at such times, when we are in the immediate presence of death, that
  the great primitive passions float to the surface and submerge all our lesser
  emotions. It was only at that moment that I knew that I loved my gentle
  companion, loved her with all my heart and soul, loved her with a love which
  was rooted deep down and was part of my very self. How strange a thing is a
  love like that! How impossible to analyse! It was not for her face or figure,
  lovely as they were. It was not for her voice, though it was more musical
  than any I have known, nor was it for mental communion, since I could only
  learn her thoughts from her sensitive ever-changing face. No, it was
  something at the back of her dark dreamy eyes, something in the very depths
  of her soul as of mine which made us mates for all time. I held out my hand
  and clasped her own, reading in her face that there was no thought or emotion
  of mine which was not flooding her own receptive mind and flushing her lovely
  cheek. Death at my side would present no terror to her, and as for myself my
  heart throbbed at the very thought.</p>

  <p>But it was not to be. One would think that our glass coverings excluded
  sounds, but as a matter of fact the throb of certain air vibrations
  penetrated them easily, or by their impact started similar vibrations within.
  There was a loud beat, a reverberating clang, like that of a distant gong. I
  had no idea what it might mean, but my companion was in no doubt. Still
  holding my hand, she rose from our shelter, and after listening intently she
  crouched down and began to make her way against the storm. It was a race
  against death, for every instant the terrible oppression on my chest became
  more unbearable. I saw her dear face peering most anxiously into mine, and I
  staggered on in the direction to which she led me. Her appearance and her
  movements showed that her oxygen supply was less exhausted than mine. I held
  on as long as Nature would allow, and then suddenly everything swam around
  me. I threw out my arms and fell senseless upon the soft ocean floor.</p>

  <p>When I came to myself I was lying on my own couch inside the Atlantean
  Palace. The old yellow&mdash;clad priest was standing beside me, a phial of
  some stimulant in his hand. Maracot and Scanlan, with distressed faces, were
  bending over me, while Mona knelt at the bottom of the bed with tender
  anxiety upon her features. It seems that the brave girl had hastened on to
  the community door, from which on occasions of this sort it was the custom to
  beat a great gong as a guide to any wanderers who might be lost. There she
  had explained my position and had guided back the rescue party, including my
  two comrades who had brought me back in their arms. Whatever I may do in
  life, it is truly Mona who will do it, for that life has been a gift from
  her.</p>

  <p>Now that by a miracle she has come to join me in the upper world, the
  human world under the sky, it is strange to reflect upon the fact that my
  love was such that I was willing, most willing, to remain for ever in the
  depths so long as she should be all my own. For long I could not understand
  that deep, deep intimate bond which held us together, and which was felt, as
  I could see, as strongly by her as by me. It was Manda, her father, who gave
  me an explanation which was as unexpected as it was satisfying.</p>

  <p>He had smiled gently over our love affair&mdash;smiled with the indulgent,
  half-amused air of one who sees that come to pass which he had already
  anticipated. Then one day he led me aside and in his own chamber he placed
  that silver screen upon which his thoughts and knowledge could be reflected.
  Never while the breath of life is in my body can I forget that which he
  showed me&mdash;and her. Seated side by side, our hands clasped together, we
  watched entranced while the pictures flickered up before our eyes, formed and
  projected by that racial memory of the past which these Atlanteans
  possess.</p>

  <p>There was a rocky peninsula jutting out into a lovely blue ocean. I may
  not have told you before that in these thought cinemas, if I may use the
  expression, colour is produced as well as form. On this headland was a house
  of quaint design, wide-spread, red-roofed, white-walled, and beautiful. A
  grove of palm trees surrounded it. In this grove there appeared to be a camp,
  for we could see the white sheen of tents and here and there the glimmer of
  arms as of some sentinel keeping ward. Out of this grove there walked a
  middle-aged man clad in mail armour, with a round light shield on his arm. He
  carried something in his other hand, but whether sword or javelin I could not
  see. He turned his face towards us once, and I saw at once that he was of the
  same breed as the Atlantean men who were around me. Indeed, he might have
  been the twin brother of Manda, save that his features were harsh and
  menacing&mdash;a brute man, but one who was brutal not from ignorance but
  from the trend of his own nature. The brute and the brain are surely the most
  dangerous of all combinations. In this high forehead and sardonic, bearded
  mouth one sensed the very essence of evil. If this were indeed some previous
  incarnation of Manda himself, and by his gestures he seemed to wish us to
  understand that it was, then in soul, if not in mind, he has risen far since
  then.</p>

  <p>As he approached the house, we saw in the picture that a young woman came
  out to meet him. She was clad as the old Greeks were clad, in a long clinging
  white garment, the simplest and yet the most beautiful and dignified dress
  that woman has ever yet devised. Her manner as she approached the man was one
  of submission and reverence&mdash;the manner of a dutiful daughter to a
  father. He repulsed her savagely, however, raising his hand as if to strike
  her As she shrank back from him, the sun lit up her beautiful, tearful face
  and I saw that it was my Mona.</p>

  <p>The silver screen blurred, and an instant later another scene was forming.
  It was a rock-bound cove, which I sensed to belong to that very peninsula
  which I had already seen. A strange-shaped boat with high pointed ends was in
  the foreground. It was night, but the moon shone very brightly on the water.
  The familiar stars, the same to Atlantis as to us, glittered in the sky.
  Slowly and cautiously the boat drew in. There were two rowers, and in the
  bows a man enveloped in a dark cloak. As he came close to the shore he stood
  up and looked eagerly around him. I saw his pale, earnest face in the clear
  moonlight. It did not need the convulsive clasp of Mona or the ejaculation of
  Manda to explain that strange intimate thrill which shot over me as I looked.
  The man was myself.</p>

  <p>Yes, I, Cyrus Headley, now of New York and of Oxford; I, the latest
  product of modern culture, had myself once been part of this mighty
  civilization of old. I understood now why many of the symbols and hieroglyphs
  which I had seen around had impressed me with a vague familiarity. Again and
  again I had felt like a man who strains his memory because he feels that he
  is on the edge of some great discovery, which is always awaiting him, and yet
  is always just outside his grasp. Now, too, I understood that deep soul
  thrill which I had encountered when my eyes met those of Mona. They came from
  the depths of my own subconscious self where the memories of twelve thousand
  years still lingered.</p>

  <p>Now the boat had touched the shore, and out of the bushes above there had
  come a glimmering white figure. My arms were outstretched to enfold it. After
  one hurried embrace I had half lifted, half carried her into the boat. But
  now there was a sudden alarm. With frantic gestures I beckoned to the rowers
  to push out. It was too late. Men swarmed out of the bushes. Eager hands
  seized the side of the boat. In vain I tried to beat them off. An axe gleamed
  in the air and crashed down upon my head. I fell forward dead upon the lady
  bathing her white robe in my blood. I saw her screaming, wild-eyed and
  open-mouthed, while her father dragged her by her long black hair from
  underneath my body. Then the curtain closed down.</p>

  <p>Once again a picture flickered up upon the silver screen. It was inside
  the house of refuge which had been built by the wise Atlantean for a place of
  refuge on the day of doom&mdash;that very house in which we now stood. I saw
  its crowded, terrified inmates at the moment of the catastrophe. Then I saw
  my Mona once again, and there also was her father who had learned better and
  wiser ways so that he was now included among those who might be saved. We saw
  the great hall rocking like a ship in a storm, while the awestruck refugees
  clung to the pillars or fell upon the floor. Then we saw the lurch and fall
  as it descended through the waves.Once more the scene died away, and Manda
  turned smiling to show that all was over.</p>

  <p>Yes, we had lived before, the whole group of us, Manda and Mona and I, and
  perhaps shall live again, acting and reacting down the long chain of our
  lives. I had died in the upper world, and so my own reincarnations had been
  upon that plane. Manda and Mona had died under, the waves, and so it was
  there that their cosmic destiny had been worked out. We had for a moment seen
  a corner lifted in the great dark veil of Nature and had one passing gleam of
  truth amid the mysteries which surround us. Each life is but one chapter in a
  story which God has designed. You cannot judge its wisdom or its justice
  until in some supreme day, from some pinnacle of knowledge, you look back and
  see at last the cause and the effect, acting and reacting, down all the long
  chronicles of Time.</p>

  <p>This new-found and delightful relationship of mine may have saved us all a
  little later when the only serious quarrel which we ever had broke out
  between us and the community with which we dwelt. As it was, it might have
  gone ill with us had not a far greater matter come to engage the attention of
  all, and to place us on a pinnacle in their estimation. It came about
  thus.</p>

  <p>One morning, if such a term can be used where the time of day could only
  be judged by our occupations, the Professor and I were seated in our large
  common room. He had fitted one corner of it as a laboratory and was busily
  engaged in dissecting a gastrostomus which he had netted the day before. On
  his table were scattered a litter of amphipods and copepods with specimens of
  Valella, Ianthina, Physalia, and a hundred other creatures whose smell was by
  no means as attractive as their appearance. I was seated near him studying an
  Atlantean grammar, for our friends had plenty of books, printed in curious
  right to left fashion upon what I thought was parchment but which proved to
  be the bladders of fishes, pressed and preserved. I was bent on getting the
  key which would unlock all this knowledge, and therefore I spent much of my
  time over the alphabet and the elements of the language.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, however, our peaceful pursuits were rudely interrupted by an
  extraordinary procession which rushed into the room. First came Bill Scanlan,
  very red and excited, one arm waving in the air, and, to our amazement, a
  plump and noisy baby under the other. Behind him was Berbrix, the Atlantean
  engineer who had helped Scanlan to erect the wireless receiver. He was a
  large stout jovial man as a rule, but now his big fat face was convulsed with
  grief. Behind him again was a woman whose straw-coloured hair and blue eyes
  showed that she was no Atlantean but one of the subordinate race which we
  traced to the ancient Greeks.</p>

  <p>'Look it here, boss,' cried the excited Scanlan. 'This guy Berbrix, who is
  a regular fellar, is going clean goofie and so is this skirt whom he has
  married, and I guess it is up to us to see that they get a square deal. Far
  as I understand it she is like a nigger would be down South, and he said a
  mouthful when he asked her to marry him, but I reckon that's the guy's own
  affair and nothing to us.'</p>

  <p>'Of course it is his own affair,' said I. 'What on earth has bitten you,
  Scanlan?'</p>

  <p>'It's like this, boss. Here ha! a baby come along. It seems the folk here
  don't want a breed of that sort nohow, and the Priests are out to offer up
  the baby to that darn image down yonder. The chief high muck-a-muck got hold
  of the baby and was sailin' off with it but Berbrix yanked it away, and I
  threw him down on his ear-hole, and now the whole pack are at our heels and
  &mdash;'</p>

  <p>Scanlan got no further with his explanation, for there was a shouting and
  a rush of feet in the passage, our door was flung open, and several of the
  yellow-clad attendants of the Temple rushed into the room. Behind them,
  fierce and austere, came the high-nosed formidable Priest. He, beckoned with
  his hand, and his servants rushed forward to seize the child. They halted,
  however, in indecision as they saw Scanlan throw the baby down among the
  specimens on the table behind him, and pick up a pike with which he
  confronted his assailants. They had drawn their knives, so I also ran with a
  pike to Scanlan's aid, while Berbrix did the same. So menacing were we that
  the Temple servants shrank back and things seemed to have come to a
  deadlock.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Headley, sir, you speak a bit of their lingo,' cried: Scanlan. 'Tell
  them there ain't no soft pickings here. Tell them we ain't givin' away no
  babies this morning, thank you. Tell them there will be such a rough house as
  they never saw if they don't vamose the ranche. There now, you asked for it
  and you've got it good and plenty and I wish you joy.'</p>

  <p>The latter part of Scanlan's speech was caused by the fact that Dr.
  Maracot had suddenly plunged the scalpel with which he was performing his
  dissection into the arm of one of the attendants who had crept round and had
  raised his knife to stab Scanlan. The man howled and danced about in fear and
  pain while his comrades, incited by the old Priest, prepared to make a rush.
  Heaven only knows what would have happened if Manda and Mona had not entered
  the room. He stared with amazement at the scene and asked a number of eager
  questions of the High Priest. Mona had come over to me, and with a happy
  inspiration I picked up the baby and placed it in her arms, where it settled
  down and cooed most contentedly.</p>

  <p>Manda's brow was overcast and it was clear that he was greatly puzzled
  what to do. He sent the Priest and his satellites back to the Temple, and
  then he entered into a long explanation, only a part of which I could
  understand and pass on to my companions.</p>

  <p>'You are to give up the baby,' I said to Scanlan.</p>

  <p>'Give it up! No, sir. Nothin' doing!'</p>

  <p>'This lady is to take charge of mother and child.'</p>

  <p>'That's another matter. If Miss Mona takes it on, I am contented. But if
  that bindlestiff of a priest&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'No, no, he cannot interfere. The matter is to be referred to the Council.
  It is very serious, for I understand Manda to say that the Priest is within
  his rights and that it is an old-established custom of the nation. They could
  never, he says, distinguish between the upper and lower races if they had all
  sorts of intermediates in between. If children are born they must die. That
  is the law.'</p>

  <p>'Well, this baby won't die anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'I hope not. He said he would do all he could with the Council. But it
  will be a week or two before they meet. So it's safe up to then, and who
  knows what may happen in the meantime.'</p>

  <p>Yes, who knew what might happen. Who could have dreamed what did happen.
  Out of this is fashioned the next chapter of our adventures.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I HAVE already said that within a short distance of the
  underground dwelling of the Atlanteans, prepared beforehand to meet the
  catastrophe which overwhelmed their native land, there lay the ruins of that
  great city of which their dwelling had once been part. I have described also
  how with the vitrine bells charged with oxygen upon our heads we were taken
  to visit this place, and I tried to convey how deep were our emotions as we
  viewed it. No words can describe the tremendous impression produced by those
  colossal ruins, the huge carved pillars and gigantic buildings, all lying
  stark and silent in the grey phosphorescent light of the bathybian deeps,
  with no movement save the slow wash of the giant fronds in the deep-sea
  currents, or the flickering shadows of the great fish which passed through
  the gaping doors or flitted round the dismantled chambers. It was a favourite
  haunt of ours, and under the guidance of our friend Manda we passed many an
  hour examining the strange architecture and all the other remains of that
  vanished civilization which bore every sign of having been, so far as
  material knowledge goes, far ahead of our own.</p>

  <p>I have said material knowledge. Soon we were to have proof that in
  spiritual culture there was a vast chasm which separated them from us. The
  lesson which we carry from their rise and their fall is that the greatest
  danger which can come to a state is when its intellect outruns its soul. It
  destroyed this old civilization, and it may yet be the ruin of our own.</p>

  <p>We had observed that in one part of the ancient city there was a large
  building which must have stood upon a hill, for it was still considerably
  elevated above the general level. A long flight of broad steps constructed
  from black marble led up to it, and the same material had been used in most
  of the building, but it was nearly obscured now by a horrible yellow fungus,
  a fleshy leprous mass, which hung down from every cornice and projection.
  Above the main doorway, carved also in black marble, was a terrible
  Medusa-like head with radiating serpents, and the same symbol was repeated
  here and there upon the walls. Several times we had wished to explore this
  sinister building, but on each occasion our friend Manda had shown the
  greatest agitation and by frantic gestures had implored us to turn away. It
  was clear that so long as he was in our company we should never have our way,
  and yet a great curiosity urged us to penetrate the secret of this ominous
  place. We held a council on the matter one morning, Bill Scanlan and I.</p>

  <p>'Look it here, Bo,' said he, 'there is something there that this guy does
  not want us to see, and the more he hides it the more of a hunch have I that
  I want to be set wise to it. We don't need no guides any more, you or I. I
  guess we can put on our own glass tops and walk out of the front door same as
  any other citizen. Let us go down and explore.'</p>

  <p>'Why not?' said I, for I was as curious about the matter as Scanlan. 'Do
  you see any objection, sir?' I asked, for Dr. Maracot had entered the room.
  'Perhaps you would care to come down with us and fathom the mystery of the
  Palace of Black Marble.'</p>

  <p>'It may be the Palace of Black Magic as well,' said he. 'Did you ever hear
  of the Lord of the Dark Face?'</p>

  <p>I confessed that I never did. I forget if I have said before that the
  Professor was a world-famed specialist on Comparative Religions and ancient
  primitive beliefs. Even the distant Atlantis was not beyond the range of his
  learning.</p>

  <p>'Our knowledge of the conditions there came to us chiefly by way of
  Egypt,' said he. 'It is what the Priests of the Temple at Sais told Solon
  which is the solid nucleus round which all the rest, part fact and part
  fiction, has gathered.'</p>

  <p>'And what wisecracks did the priests say?' asked Scanlan.</p>

  <p>'Well, they said a good deal. But among other things they handed down a
  legend of the Lord of the Dark Face. I can't help thinking that he may have
  been the Master of the Black Marble Palace. Some say that there were several
  Lords of the Dark Face&mdash;but one at least is on record.'</p>

  <p>'And what sort of a duck was he?' asked Scanlan.,</p>

  <p>'Well, by all accounts, he was more than a man, both in his power and in
  his wickedness. Indeed, it was on account of these things, and on account of
  the utter corruption which he had brought upon the people, that the whole
  land was destroyed.'</p>

  <p>'Like Sodom and Gomorrah.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly. There would seem to be a point where things become impossible.
  Nature's patience is exhausted, and the only course open is to smear it all
  out and begin again. This creature, one can hardly call him a man, had
  trafficked in unholy arts and had acquired magic powers of the most far
  &mdash;reaching sort which he turned to evil ends. That is the legend of the
  Lord of the Dark Face. It would explain why his house is still a thing of
  horror to these poor people and why they dread that we should go near
  it.'</p>

  <p>'Which makes me the more eager to do so,' I cried.</p>

  <p>'Same here, Bo,' Bill added.</p>

  <p>'I confess that I, too, should be interested to examine it,' said the
  Professor. 'I cannot see that our kind hosts here will be any the worse if we
  make a little expedition of our own, since their superstition makes it
  difficult for them to accompany us. We will take our opportunity and do
  so.'</p>

  <p>It was some little time before that opportunity came, for our small
  community was so closely knit that there was little privacy in life. It
  chanced, however, one morning&mdash;so far as we could with our rough
  calendar reckon night and morning&mdash;there was some religious observance
  which assembled them all and took up all their attention. The chance was too
  good for us to miss and having assured the two janitors who worked the great
  pumps of the entrance chamber that all was right we soon found ourselves
  alone upon the ocean bed and bound for the old city. Progress is slow through
  the heavy medium of salt water, and even a short walk is wearying, but within
  an hour we found ourselves in front of the huge black building which had
  excited our curiosity. With no friendly guide to check us, and no
  presentiment of danger, we ascended the marble stair and passed through the
  huge carved portals of this palace of evil.</p>

  <p>It was far better preserved than the other buildings of the old city
  &mdash;so much so, indeed, that the stone shell was in no way altered, and
  only the furniture and the hangings had long decayed and vanished. Nature,
  however, had brought her own hangings, and very horrible they were. It was a
  gloomy shadowy place at the best, but in those hideous shadows lurked the
  obscene shapes of monstrous polyps and strange, misformed fish which were
  like the creations of a nightmare. Especially I remember an enormous purple
  sea-slug which crawled, in great numbers, everywhere and large black flat
  fish which lay like mats upon the floor, with long waving tentacles tipped
  with flame vibrating above them in the water. We had to step carefully, for
  the whole building was filled with hideous creatures which might well prove
  to be as poisonous as they looked.</p>

  <p>There were richly ornamented passages with small side rooms leading out
  from them, but the centre of the building was taken up by one magnificent
  hall, which in the days of its grandeur must have been one of the most
  wonderful chambers ever erected by human hands. In that gloomy light we could
  see neither the roof nor the full sweep of the walls, but as we walked round,
  our lamps casting tunnels of light before us, we appreciated its huge
  proportions and the marvellous decorations of the walls. These decorations
  took the form of statues and ornaments, carved with the highest perfection of
  art, but horrible and revolting in their subjects. All that the most depraved
  human mind could conceive of Sadic cruelty and bestial lust was reproduced
  upon the walls. Through the shadows monstrous images and horrible imaginings
  loomed round us on every side. If ever the devil had a Temple erected in his
  honour, it was there. So too was the devil himself, for at one end of the
  room, under a canopy of discoloured metal which may well have been gold, and
  on a high throne of red marble, there was seated a dreadful deity, the very
  impersonation of evil, savage, scowling and relentless, modelled upon the
  same lines as the Baal whom we had seen in the Atlantean Colony, but
  infinitely stranger and more repulsive. There was a fascination in the
  wonderful vigour of that terrible countenance, and we were standing with our
  lamps playing upon it, absorbed in our reflections, when the most amazing,
  the most incredible thing came to break in upon our reflections. From behind
  us there came the sound of a loud, derisive human laugh.</p>

  <p>Our heads were, as I have explained, enclosed in our glass bells, from
  which all sound was excluded, nor was it possible for anyone wearing a bell
  to utter any sound. And yet that mocking laugh fell clear upon the ears of
  each of us. We sprang round and stood amazed at what was before us.</p>

  <p>Against one of the pillars of the hall a man was leaning, his arms folded
  upon his chest, and his malevolent eyes fixed with a threatening glare upon
  ourselves. I have called him a man, but he was unlike any man whom I have
  ever seen, and the fact that he both breathed and talked as no man could
  breathe or talk, and made his voice carry as no human voice could carry, told
  us that he had that in him which made him very different from ourselves.
  Outwardly he was a magnificent creature, not less than seven feet in height
  and built upon the lines of a perfect athlete, which was more noticeable as
  he wore a costume which fitted tightly upon his figure, and seemed to consist
  of black glazed leather. His face was that of a bronze statue&mdash;a statue
  wrought by some master craftsman in order to depict all the power and also
  all the evil which the human features could portray. It was not bloated or
  sensual, for such characteristics would have meant weakness and there was no
  trace of weakness there. On the contrary, it was extraordinarily clean-cut
  and aquiline, with an eagle nose, dark bristling brows, and smouldering black
  eyes which flashed and glowed with an inner fire. It was those remorseless,
  malignant eyes, and the beautiful but cruel straight hard-lipped mouth, set
  like fate, which gave the terror to his face. One felt, as one looked at him,
  that magnificent as he was in his person, he was evil to the very marrow, his
  glance a threat, his smile a sneer, his laugh a mockery:</p>

  <p>'Well, gentlemen,' he said, talking excellent English in a voice which
  sounded as clear as if we were all back upon earth, 'you have had a
  remarkable adventure in the past and are likely to have an even more exciting
  one in the future, though it may be my pleasant task to bring it to a sudden
  end. This, I fear, is a rather one-sided conversation, but as I am perfectly
  well able to read your thoughts, and as I know all about you, you need not
  fear any misunderstanding. But you have a great deal&mdash;a very great deal
  to learn.'</p>

  <p>We looked at each other in helpless amazement. It was hard, indeed, to be
  prevented from comparing notes as to our reactions to this amazing
  development. Again we heard that rasping laugh.</p>

  <p>'Yes, it is indeed hard. But you can talk when you return, for I wish you
  to return and to take a message with you. If it were not for that message, I
  think that this visit to my home would have been your end. But first of all I
  have a few things which I wished to say to you. I will address you, Dr.
  Maracot, as the oldest and presumably the wisest of the party, though none
  could have been very wise to make such an excursion as this. You hear me very
  well, do you not? That is right, a nod or a shake is all I ask.</p>

  <p>'Of course you know who I am. I fancy you discovered me lately. No one can
  speak or think of me that I do not know it. No one can come into this my old
  home, my innermost intimate shrine, that I am not summoned. That is why these
  poor wretches down yonder avoid it, and wanted you to avoid it a1so. You
  would have been wiser if you had followed their advice. You have brought me
  to you, and when once I am brought I do not readily leave.</p>

  <p>'Your mind with its little grain of earth science is worrying itself over
  the problems which I present. How is it that I can live here without oxygen?
  I do not live here. I live in the great world of men under the light of the
  sun. I only come here when I am called as you have called me. But I am an
  ether- breathing creature. There is as much ether here as on a mountain top.
  Some of your own people can live without air. The cataleptic lies for months
  and never breathes. I'm even as he, but I remain, as you see me, conscious
  and active.</p>

  <p>'Now you worry as to how you can hear me. Is it not the very essence of
  wireless transmission that it turns from the ether to the air? So I, too, can
  turn my words from my etheric utterance to impinge upon your ears through the
  air which fills those clumsy bells of yours.</p>

  <p>'And my English? Well, I hope it is fairly good. I have lived some time on
  earth, oh a weary, weary time. How long is it? Is this the eleventh thousand
  or the twelfth thousand year? The latter, I think. I have had time to learn
  all human tongues. My English is no better than the rest.</p>

  <p>'Have I resolved some of your doubts? That is right. I can see if I cannot
  hear you. But now I have something more serious to say.</p>

  <p>'I am Baal-seepa. I am the Lord of the Dark Face. I am he who went so far
  into the inner secrets of Nature that I could defy death himself. I have so
  handled things that I could not die if I would. Some will stronger than my
  own is to be found if I am ever to die. Oh, mortals, never pray to be
  delivered from death. It may seem terrible, but eternal life is infinitely
  more so. To go on and on and on while the endless procession of humanity goes
  past you. To sit ever at the wayside of history and to see it go, ever moving
  onwards and leaving you behind. Is it a wonder that my heart is black and
  bitter, and that I curse the whole foolish drove of them? I injure them when
  I can. Why should I not?</p>

  <p>'You wonder how I can injure them. I have powers, and they are not small
  ones. I can sway the minds of men. I am the master of the mob. Where evil has
  been planned there have I ever been. I was with the Huns when they laid half
  Europe in ruins. I was with the Saracens when under the name of religion they
  put to the sword all who gainsayed them. I was out on Bartholomew's night. I
  lay behind the slave trade. It was my whisper which burned ten thousand old
  crones whom the fools called witches. I was the tall dark man who led the mob
  in Paris when the streets swam in blood. Rare times those, but they have been
  even better of late in Russia. That is whence I have come. I had half
  forgotten this colony of sea-rats who burrow under the mud and carry on a few
  of the arts and legends of that grand land where life flourished as never
  since. It is you who reminded me of them, for this old home of mine is still
  united, by personal vibrations of which your science knows nothing, to the
  man who built and loved it. I knew that strangers had entered it. I inquired,
  and here I am. So now since I am here&mdash;and it is the first time for a
  thousand years&mdash;it has reminded me of these people. They have lingered
  long enough. It is time for them to go. They are sprung from the power of one
  who defied me in his life, and who built up this means of escape from the
  catastrophe which engulfed all but his people and myself. His wisdom saved
  them and my powers saved me. But now my powers will crush those whom he
  saved, and the story will be complete.'</p>

  <p>He put his hand into his breast and he took out a piece of script. 'You
  will give this to the chief of the water-rats,' said he. 'I regret that you
  gentlemen should share their fate, but since you are the primary cause of
  their misfortune it is only justice, after all. I will see you again later.
  Meanwhile I would commend a study of these pictures and carvings, which will
  give you some idea of the height to which I had raised Atlantis during the
  days of my rule. Here you will find some record of the manners and customs of
  the people when under my influence. Life was very varied, very highly
  coloured, very many- sided. In these drab days they would call it an orgy of
  wickedness. Well, call it what you will, I brought it about, I rejoiced in
  it, and I have no regrets. Had I my time again, I would do even so and more,
  save only for this fatal gift of eternal life. Warda, whom I curse and whom I
  should have killed before he grew strong enough to turn people against me,
  was wiser than I in this. He still revisits earth, but it is as a spirit, not
  a man. And now I go. You came here from curiosity, my friends. I can but
  trust that that curiosity is satisfied.'</p>

  <p>And then we saw him disappear. Yes, before our very eyes he vanished. It
  was not done in an instant. He stood clear of the pillar against which he had
  been leaning. His splendid towering figure seemed blurred at the edges. The
  light died out of his eyes and his features grew indistinct. Then in a moment
  he had become a dark whirling cloud which swept upwards through the stagnant
  water of this dreadful hall. Then he was gone, and we stood gazing at each
  other and marvelling at the strange possibilities of life.</p>

  <p>We did not linger in that horrible palace. It was not a safe place in
  which to loiter. As it was, I picked one of those noxious purple slugs off
  the shoulder of Bill Scanlan, and I was myself badly stung in the hand by the
  venom spat at me by a great yellow lamelli branch. As we staggered out I had
  one last impression of those dreadful carvings, the devil's own handiwork,
  upon the walls, and then we almost ran down the darksome passage, cursing the
  day that ever we had been fools enough to enter it. It was joy indeed to be
  out in the phosphorescent light of the bathybian plain, and to see the clear
  translucent water once again around us. Within an hour we were back in our
  home once more. With our helmets removed, we met in consultation in our own
  chamber. The Professor and I were too overwhelmed with it all to be able to
  put our thoughts into words. It was only the irrepressible vitality of Bill
  Scanlan which rose superior.</p>

  <p>'Holy smoke!' said he. 'We are up against it now. I guess this guy is the
  big noise out of hell. Seems to me, with his pictures and statues and the
  rest, he would make the wardsman of a red light precinct look like two cents.
  How to handle him&mdash;that's the question.'</p>

  <p>Dr. Maracot was lost in thought. Then he rang the bell and summoned our
  yellow-clad attendant. 'Manda,' said he. A minute later our friend was in the
  room. Maracot handed him the fateful letter.</p>

  <p>Never have I admired a man as I did Manda at that moment. We had brought
  threatened ruin upon his people and himself by our unjustifiable curiosity
  &mdash;we, the strangers whom he had rescued when everything was hopelessly
  lost. And yet, though he turned a ghastly colour as he read the message,
  there was no touch of reproach upon the sad brown eyes which turned upon us.
  He shook his head, and despair was in every gesture. 'Baal-seepa!
  Baal-seepa!' he cried, and pressed his hands convulsively to his eyes, as if
  shutting out some horrible vision. He ran about the room like a man
  distracted with his grief, and finally rushed away to read the fatal message
  to the community. We heard a few minutes later the clang of the great bell
  which summoned them all to conference in the Central Hall.</p>

  <p>'Shall we go?' I asked.</p>

  <p>Dr. Maracot shook his head.</p>

  <p>'What can we do? For that matter, what can they do?What chance have they
  against one who has the powers of a demon?'</p>

  <p>'As much chance as a bunch of rabbits against a weasel,' said Scanlan.
  'But, by Gosh, it's up to us to find a way out. I guess we can't go out of
  our way to raise the devil and then pass the buck to the folk that saved
  us.'</p>

  <p>'What do you suggest?' I asked eagerly, for behind all his slang and his
  levity I recognized the strong, practical ability of this modern man of his
  hands.</p>

  <p>'Well, you can search me,' said he. 'And yet maybe this guy is not as safe
  as he thinks. A bit of it may have got worn out with age, and he's getting on
  in years if we can take his word for it.'</p>

  <p>'You think we might attack him?'</p>

  <p>'Lunacy!' interjected the doctor.</p>

  <p>Scanlan went to his locker. When he faced round he had a big six-shooter
  in his hand.</p>

  <p>'What about this?' he said. 'I laid hold of it when we got our chance at
  the wreck. I thought maybe it might come useful. I've a dozen shells here.
  Maybe if I made as many holes in the big stiff it would let out some of his
  Magic. Lord save us! What is it?'</p>

  <p>The revolver clattered down upon the floor, and Scanlan was writhing in
  agonies of pain, his left hand clasping his right wrist. Terrible cramps had
  seized his arm, and as we tried to alleviate them we could feel the muscles
  knotted up as hard as the roots of a tree. The sweat of agony streamed down
  the poor fellow's brow. Finally, utterly cowed and exhausted, he fell upon
  his bed.</p>

  <p>'That lets me out,' he said. 'I'm through. Yes, thank you, the pain is
  better. But it is K.O. to William Scanlan. I've learned my lesson. You don't
  fight hell with six-shooters, and it's no use to try. I give him best from
  now onwards.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, you have had your lesson,' said Maracot, 'and it has been a severe
  one.'</p>

  <p>'Then you think our case is hopeless?'</p>

  <p>'What can we do when, as it would seem, he is aware of every word and
  action? And yet we will not despair.' He sat in thought for a few moments. 'I
  think,' he resumed, 'that you, Scanlan, had best lie where you are for a
  time. You have had a shock from which it will take you some time to
  recover.'</p>

  <p>'If there is anything doing, count me in, though I guess we can cut out
  the rough stuff,' said our comrade bravely, but his drawn face and shaking
  limbs showed what he had endured.</p>

  <p>'There is nothing doing so far as you are concerned. We at least have
  learned what is the wrong way to go to work. All violence is useless. We are
  working on another plane&mdash;the plane of spirit. Do you remain here,
  Headley. I am going to the room which I use as a study. Perhaps if I were
  alone I could see a little more clearly what we should do.'</p>

  <p>Both Scanlan and I had learned to have a great confidence in Maracot. If
  any human brain could solve our difficulties, it would be his. And yet surely
  we had reached a point which was beyond all human capacity. We were as
  helpless as children in the face of forces which we could neither understand
  nor control. Scanlan had fallen into a troubled sleep. My own one thought as
  I sat beside him was not how we should escape, but rather what form the blow
  would take and when it would fall. At any moment I was prepared to see the
  solid roof above us sink in, the walls collapse, and the dark waters of the
  lowest deep close in upon those who had defied them so long.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the great bell pealed out once more. Its harsh clamour
  jarred upon every nerve. I sprang to my feet, and Scanlan sat up in bed. It
  was no ordinary summons which rang through the old palace. The agitated
  tumultuous ringing, broken and irregular, was calling an alarm. All had to
  come, and at once. It was menacing and insistent. 'Come now! Come at once!
  Leave everything and come!' cried the bell.</p>

  <p>'Say, Bo, we should be with them,' said Scanlan. 'guess they're up against
  it now.'</p>

  <p>'And yet what can we do?'</p>

  <p>'Maybe just the sight of us will give them a bit of heart. Anyhow, they
  must not think that we are quitters. Where is the Doc?'</p>

  <p>'He went to his study. But you are right, Scanlan. We should be with the
  others and let them see that we are ready to share their fate.'</p>

  <p>'The poor boobs seem to lean on us in a way. It may be that they know more
  than we, but we seem to have more sand in our craw than they. I guess they
  have taken what was given to them, and we have had to find things for
  ourselves. Well, it's me for the deluge&mdash;if the deluge has got to
  be.'</p>

  <p>But as we approached the door a most unexpected interruption detained us.
  Dr. Maracot stood before us. But was it indeed the Dr. Maracot whom we had
  known&mdash;this self-assured man with strength and resolution shining from
  every feature of his masterful face? The quiet scholar had been submerged,
  and here was a superman, a great leader, a dominant soul who might mould
  mankind to his desires.</p>

  <p>'Yes, friends, we shall be needed. All may yet be well. But come at once,
  or it may be too late. I will explain everything later&mdash;if there is any
  later for us. Yes, yes, we are coming.'</p>

  <p>The latter words, with appropriate gesture, were spoken to some terrified
  Atlanteans who had appeared at the door and were eagerly beckoning to us to
  come. It was a fact, as Scanlan had said, that we had shown ourselves several
  times to be stronger in character and prompter in action than these secluded
  people, and at this hour of supreme danger they seemed to cling to us. I
  could hear a subdued murmur of satisfaction and relief as we entered the
  crowded hall, and took the places reserved for us in the front row.</p>

  <p>It was time that we came, if we were indeed to bring any help. The
  terrible presence was already standing upon the dais and facing with a cruel,
  thin-lipped, demoniacal smile the cowering folk before him. Scanlan's simile
  of a bunch of rabbits before a weasel came back to my memory as I looked
  round at them. They sank together, holding on to each other in their terror,
  and gazing wide&mdash;eyed at the mighty figure which towered above them and
  the ruthless granite-hewed face which looked down upon them. Never can I
  forget the impression of those semi-circular rows, tier above tier, of
  haggard, wide-eyed faces with their horrified gaze all directed towards the
  central dais. It would seem that he had already pronounced their doom and
  that they stood in the shadow of death waiting for its fulfilment. Manda was
  standing in abject submission, pleading in broken accents for his people, but
  one could see that the words only gave an added zest to the monster who stood
  sneering before him. The creature interrupted him with a few rasping words,
  and raised his right hand in the air, while a cry of despair rose from the
  assembly.</p>

  <p>And at that moment Dr. Maracot sprang upon the dais. It was amazing to
  watch him. Some miracle seemed to have altered the man. He had the gait and
  the gesture of a youth, and yet upon his face there was a look of such power
  as I have never seen upon human features yet. He strode up to the swarthy
  giant, who glared down at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>'Well, little man, what have you to say?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'I have this to say,' said Maracot. 'Your time has come. You have over-
  stayed it. Go down! Go down into the Hell that has been waiting for you so
  long. You are a prince of darkness. Go where the darkness is.'</p>

  <p>The demon's eyes shot dark fire as he answered:</p>

  <p>'When my time comes, if it should ever come, it will not be from the lips
  of a wretched mortal that I shall learn it,' said he. 'What power have you
  that you could oppose for a moment one who is in the secret places of Nature?
  I could blast you where you stand.'</p>

  <p>Maracot looked into those terrible eyes without blenching. It seemed to me
  that it was the giant who flinched away from his gaze.</p>

  <p>'Unhappy being,' said Maracot. 'It is I who have the power and the will to
  blast you where you stand. Too long have you cursed the world with your
  presence. You have been a plague-spot infecting all that was beautiful and
  good. The hearts of men will be lighter when you are gone, and the sun will
  shine more brightly.'</p>

  <p>'What is this? Who are you? What is it that you are saying?' stammered the
  creature.</p>

  <p>'You speak of secret knowledge. Shall I tell you that which is at the very
  base of it? It is that on every plane the good of that plane can be stronger
  than the evil. The angel will still beat the devil. For the moment I am on
  the same plane on which you have so long been, and I hold the power of the
  conqueror. It has been given to me. So again I say: Down with you! Down to
  Hell to which you belong! Down, sir! Down, I say! Down!'</p>

  <p>And then the miracle occurred. For a minute or more&mdash;how can one
  count time at such moments?&mdash;the two beings, the mortal and the demon,
  faced each other as rigid as statues, glaring into each other's eyes, with
  inexorable will upon the two faces, the dark one and the fair. Then suddenly
  the great creature flinched. His face convulsed with rage, he threw two
  clawing hands up into the air. 'It is you, Warda, you cursed one! I recognize
  your handiwork. Oh, curse you, Warda. Curse you! Curse you!' His voice died
  away, his long dark figure became blurred in its outline, his head drooped
  upon his chest, his knees sagged under him, down he sank and down, and as he
  sank he changed his shape. At first it was a crouching human being, then it
  was a dark formless mass, and then with sudden collapse it had become a
  semi-liquid heap of black and horrible putrescence which stained the dais and
  poisoned the air. At the same time Scanlan and I dashed forward on to the
  platform, for Dr. Maracot, with a deep groan, his powers exhausted, had
  fallen forward in helpless collapse. 'We have won! We have won!' he muttered,
  and an instant later his senses had left him and he lay half dead upon the
  floor.</p>

  <p>*</p>

  <p>Thus it was that the Atlantean colony was saved from the most horrible
  danger that could threaten it, and that an evil presence was banished for
  ever from the world. It was not for some days that Dr. Maracot could tell his
  story, and when he did it was of such a character that if we had not seen the
  results we should have put it down as the delirium of his illness. I may say
  that his power had left him with the occasion which had called it forth, and
  that he was now the same quiet, gentle man of science whom we had known.</p>

  <p>'That it should have happened to me!' he cried. 'To me, a materialist, a
  man so immersed in matter that the invisible did not exist in my philosophy.
  The theories of a whole lifetime have crumbled about my ears.'</p>

  <p>'I guess we have all been to school again,' said Scanlan, 'If ever I get
  back to the little home town, I shall have something to tell the boys.'</p>

  <p>'The less you tell them the better, unless you want to get the name of
  being the greatest liar that ever came out of America,' said I. 'Would you or
  I have believed it all if someone else had told us?'</p>

  <p>'Maybe not. But say, Doc, you had the dope right enough. That great black
  stiff got his ten and out as neat as ever I saw. There was no come-back
  there. You clean pushed him off the map. I don't know on what other map he
  has found his location, but it is no place for Bill Scanlan anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'I will tell you exactly what occurred,' said the Doctor. 'You will
  remember that I left you and retired into my study. I had little hope in my
  heart, but I had read a good deal at different times about black magic and
  occult arts. I was aware that white can always dominate black if it can but
  reach the same plane. He was on a much stronger&mdash;I will not say higher
  &mdash;plane than we. That was the fatal fact.</p>

  <p>'I saw no way of getting over it. I flung myself down on the settee and I
  prayed&mdash;yes, I, the hardened materialist, prayed&mdash;for help. When
  one is at the very end of all human power, what can one do save to stretch
  appealing hands into the mists which gird us round? I prayed&mdash; and my
  prayer was most wonderfully answered.</p>

  <p>'I was suddenly aware of the fact that I was not alone in the room. There
  stood before me a tall figure, as swarthy as the evil presence whom we
  fought, but with a kindly, bearded face which shone with benevolence and
  love. The sense of power which he conveyed was not less than the other, but
  it was the power of good, the power within the influence of which evil would
  shred away as the mists do before the sun. He looked at me with kindly eyes,
  and I sat, too amazed to speak, staring up at him. Something within me, some
  inspiration or intuition, told me that this was the spirit of that great and
  wise Atlantean who had fought the evil while he lived, and who, when he could
  not prevent the destruction of his country, took such steps as would ensure
  that the more worthy should survive even though they should be sunk to the
  depths of the Ocean. This wondrous being was now interposing to prevent the
  ruin of his work and the destruction of his children. With a sudden gush of
  hope I realized all this as clearly as if he had said it. Then, still
  smiling, he advanced, and he laid his two hands upon my head. It was his own
  virtue and strength, no doubt, which he was transferring to me. I felt it
  coursing like fire down my veins. Nothing in the world seemed impossible at
  that moment. I had the will and the might to do miracles. Then at that moment
  I heard the bell clang out, which told me that the crisis had come. As I rose
  from the couch the spirit, smiling his encouragement, vanished before me.
  Then I joined you, and the rest you know.'</p>

  <p>'Well, sir,' said I, 'I think you have made your reputation. If you care
  to set up as a god down here, I expect you would find no difficulty.'</p>

  <p>'You got away with it better than I did, Doc,' said Scanlan in a rueful
  voice. 'How is it this guy didn't know what you were doing? He was quick
  enough on to me when I laid hand on a gun. And yet you had him guessing.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose that you were on the plane of matter, and that, for the moment,
  we were upon that of spirit,' said the Doctor thoughtfully. 'Such things
  teach one humility. It is only when you touch the higher that you realize how
  low we may be among the possibilities of creation. I have had my lesson. May
  my future life show that I have learned it.'</p>

  <p>So this was the end of our supreme experience. It was but a little time
  later that we conceived the idea of sending news of ourselves to the surface,
  and that later by means of vitrine balls filled with levigen, we ascended
  ourselves to be met in the manner already narrated. Dr. Maracot actually
  talks of going back. There is some point of Ichthyology upon which he wants
  more precise information. But Scanlan has, I hear, married his wren in
  Philadelphia, and has been promoted as works manager of Merribanks, so he
  seeks no further adventure, while I&mdash;well, the deep sea has given me a
  precious pearl, and I ask for no more.</p><br>
