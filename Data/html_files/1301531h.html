  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"><small>CHAPTER I.</small> &mdash;<br>
  Ikey And His Trade</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IF you bring a woman into a story you spoil the story, and
in all
  probability libel the woman; everybody knows that. But there are two women in
  this story, so get ready; they always have crept in, and they always will
  &mdash; and we have to make the best of it. In this instance, though, the
  first person to creep in was Ikey Hole.</p>

  <p>The police in particular, but almost everybody who knew him at all
  intimately, called him Keyhole Ikey, so that by the time that he crept into
  the story he was laboring under an extra syllable as well as a kit of
  scientifically constructed tools distributed about his person. It was a
  second story that he crept into &mdash; through a bedroom window.</p>

  <p>Ikey started in business at the early age of sixteen as a porch-climber,
  and by the time he was twenty he had become a past grand-master of his
  profession; but since by that time porches had grown a little out of fashion
  in New York he began to make a specialty of fire-escapes, and from that time
  on he throve amazingly, as everybody does who is sufficiently far-sighted to
  move with the times.</p>

  <p>He was a very careful man, was Ikey. He considered every little detail,
  just like the big interests do; but, unlike them, he was contriving to salt
  away quite a snug little fortune without running the risk of being
  muckraked.</p>

  <p>He agreed with the big interests in detesting publicity, but he differed
  from them again, in having nothing whatever to do with gentlemen&rsquo;s
  agreements. Ikey had no pals; he always worked alone.</p>

  <p>He closed the window carefully behind him, leaving just sufficient space
  open at the bottom to enable him to insert his fingers should he have need to
  open it again in a hurry; then he pulled down the blind.</p>

  <p>That left him in pitch-darkness, but not for long, for he produced an
  electric torch from his sleeve and pressed the button; that gave him just
  sufficient light to examine the door by.</p>

  <p>The door proved to be unlocked, and the key was on the outside; so he
  opened it very gently, removed the key, and locked it on the inside.</p>

  <p>Now, economy was one of Ikey&rsquo;s strong points, and burning that
  electric torch of his cost him good money; so he extinguished it and replaced
  it up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>Then he switched on the electric light that was hanging in the middle of
  the room; it was a sixteen candlepower tungsten lamp, and, besides being a
  whole lot better to work by, the use of it cost him nothing.</p>

  <p>The sudden flood of light revealed his figure full length in the
  pier-glass that stood facing him in one corner of the room, and he nearly
  jumped out of his skin with fright.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; he muttered with a low chuckle; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  gettin&rsquo; nervous! Have to cut out corfee and cigarettes for a
  while!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Coffee and cigarettes were Ikey&rsquo;s chief solace in his hours of ease;
  but there was the making of a hero in Ikey, and he decided to give them both
  up on the instant, and with as little compunction as he would have felt in
  refusing an offer of employment; he knew what suited him, did Ikey, and he
  never broke his word to himself, either, whatever he might do to other
  people.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, looking sharply round the
  room and twiggling his nose. His nose had escaped being prehensile by very
  little; it was big, curled over at the end, and he used it to talk to himself
  with, just like a mouse does that is peeping out of a hole; you could almost
  read his thoughts by watching that nose of his twist and wrinkle and squirm,
  and he had a pair of little beady, black eyes above it that were not at all
  unlike a mouse&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>In addition to all that, he had rather large ears that stood out on either
  side of his head and were pointed at the top. So he was really very like a
  mouse, was Ikey.</p>

  <p>As he stood surveying the room, buttoning the top button of one of his
  black kid gloves that had come unfastened, you would never have mistaken Ikey
  for a big-hearted man; you would have probably mentally assessed him as a
  &ldquo;piker,&rdquo; and it would never have entered your head that he might
  possibly possess both characteristics.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;lemme see&mdash;under the
  mattress? no; under the rug? no; nice little dinky tin box under the bed?
  like as not; no, nothing there. Um-m-m! Tucked in the folds of a nighty in
  the middle of a bureau drawer? No, not there, either.&rdquo; He pulled out
  handful after handful of lingerie, tossing the garments into a heap on the
  floor. &ldquo;All pretty cheap stuff this&mdash;midsummer sale sort of stuff;
  heaps of it, though&mdash;guess she spent all her money at the sales. Dashed
  robbers, those department-stores&mdash;guess there&rsquo;s nothing doing
  here. Hello! Ah, here&rsquo;s a drawer locked! There may be somethin&rsquo;
  inside worth lookin&rsquo; at.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He tugged at the top right-hand drawer of the bureau, and his nose
  wriggled, and his little black mustache stood straight on end on either side
  of it as his lips straightened into a grin, and his little black eyes
  glittered like jewels in a setting of crow&rsquo;s feet when the drawer
  refused to come open.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Love-letters, like as not!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Too much
  fluffy white stuff here. I reckon somebody&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to git
  married. I&rsquo;ll bet a nickel that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter. Better
  have a look though.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ikey always traveled prepared for every possible contingency, except
  fighting; he never fought, and he never murdered people; but, like Dan Cupid
  he laughed at locksmiths.</p>

  <p>He produced a short, stiff, crooked piece of wire, which he worked about
  with his thin, restless fingers for about half a minute; then he inserted it
  gingerly in the keyhole, jerked it, drew it back a little, jerked it again,
  and click! went the lock, and Ikey opened the drawer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; he exclaimed, out loud this time, wriggling his whole
  body and twisting one leg round the other in excitement.
  &ldquo;Gee&mdash;whiz! Gee&mdash;Rusalem! By the blue beak on the map of a
  traffic-bull in winter, if here ain&rsquo;t all the money in the
  world!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pulled out a bundle of bills from beneath a pile of lace-handkerchiefs
  and began to count.</p>

  <p>?Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen! Mother of me, what a haul! Twenty-five,
  twenty- six! I wonder if I&rsquo;m drunk? Thirty-three, thirty-four,
  thirty-five&mdash;this is like findin&rsquo; money! Forty-six, forty-seven!
  By the red face of a thirsty bull on pay-day, if here ain&rsquo;t fifty
  centuries! Fifty one-hundred-dollar bills! Fif- tee little yeller plasters
  o&rsquo; one hundred plunks apiece, payable to bearer on demand, and me the
  bearer! Me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He slipped the whole bundle into an inside pocket, hardly able to contain
  himself with glee; but he would not have been Keyhole Ikey if he were not
  still careful; he unlocked the door again and replaced the key on the outside
  before going, with the laudable intention of causing suspicion to fall on
  some one in the house.</p>

  <p>Then he switched the light out and slipped noiselessly through the window,
  closing it behind him; he even took the trouble to fasten the window-catch
  again from the outside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do hope the lady came by the mazuma honest!&rdquo; he remarked to
  himself, as he started to climb down the fire-escape. &ldquo;I surely would
  hate to handle any o&rsquo; this money if it was tainted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he dropped ten feet or so into the yard below, making about half as
  much noise as a cat would have done in performing the same feat, and vanished
  into the darkness, still chuckling.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"><small>CHAPTER II.</small> &mdash;<br>
  Which Introduces Woman Number One</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was at least two hours after Ikey Hole left it through
the window that
  the owner of the bedroom entered through the door. She is woman number one,
  who helps to spoil the story, so perhaps her name is relevant; besides, a
  name is one of the few things in this world that don&rsquo;t cost anything,
  and even school- teachers have them; her name was Lizzie Wingfield. Describe
  her for yourself.</p>

  <p>Imagine the prettiest girl you can&mdash;not too tall and not too
  short&mdash;fair or dark as your fancy dictates and multiply the resulting
  loveliness by two; after that you&rsquo;ve only got yourself to blame if you
  don&rsquo;t like her, and the story will get along famously.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ve told you she was a schoolteacher; she was dressed in a low-cut
  evening gown, for description of which see any one of the current fashion
  magazines; and she didn&rsquo;t look like a school-teacher in the
  least&mdash;at least not like your idea of one. The point is that she was a
  school-teacher, and that she had been to a dance. Remember, I said was.</p>

  <p>Her mind was still centered on the gaiety and the garish lights and the
  lingering airs of waltz music; as she entered the room she was still humming
  the air of the last tune she had waltzed to. As she walked across the room
  she stumbled over the pile of lingerie that Ikey had heaped so carelessly on
  the floor, and the humming ceased. Then she turned on the light.</p>

  <p>No. She didn&rsquo;t swear. Ladies don&rsquo;t do that. At all events, her
  sort don&rsquo;t.</p>

  <p>But she sat down on the bed and stared at the confusion, and wished that
  it were proper for her to swear, and you will admit that that is a bird of
  quite another feather.</p>

  <p>She still had a certain amount of equanimity left, for the knowledge that
  she had so much frilly stuff to scatter about was, so to speak, forced on her
  notice; no woman in the world can repress a quite pardonable feeling of pride
  when she realized the extent of her possessions of that kind, and especially
  when the garments in question are all new and clean, and were bought at
  absolutely bargain prices.</p>

  <p>But then she noticed that the right-hand top drawer of the bureau was not
  quite closed; and she had left it locked. Her heart began to flutter now in
  real earnest. She was afraid even to open the drawer and look, she was so
  frightened.</p>

  <p>She sat on the edge of the bed and stared at the bureau, and felt herself
  going goose-fleshy all over, and for two whole minutes she could not screw up
  sufficient nerve to investigate.</p>

  <p>Then she seized the knob and jerked the drawer open, as though to get the
  worst over quickly, and her face grew as white as the pile of petticoats on
  the floor as she discovered what the reader knows already&mdash;that the
  fifty beautiful, new, crinkly, yellow hundred-dollar hills were missing.</p>

  <p>No. She didn&rsquo;t scream. And she didn&rsquo;t wring her hands, or the
  bell, or the neck of the answering chambermaid; and if that doesn&rsquo;t
  make you like her, nothing will. She just stood still and turned over the
  handkerchiefs and all the other things in the drawer one by one to make you
  like her, nothing will. She just stood still and turned over the
  handkerchiefs and all the other things in the drawer one by one to make sure,
  and then&mdash;guess! She looked under the bed for burglars!</p>

  <p>Not a hurried peep, either; she took a good, hard look, and made
  absolutely certain that there weren&rsquo;t any. Then she knelt down on the
  floor and laid her arms on the bed, and laid her head on her arms and sobbed
  and sobbed and sobbed.</p>

  <p>Poor little woman! She had a right to sob. She had resigned her position
  as school-teacher that very day with a view to getting married the following
  month, and that five thousand dollars was all, absolutely every cent, that
  she and her intended had got to marry on. And the worst of it was that he was
  nowhere near to comfort her; he was all the way across the continent in San
  Francisco.</p>

  <p>She couldn&rsquo;t rush down-stairs, and down the street a couple of
  blocks, and round the corner, and ring the bell of his flat, and weep on his
  big, broad bosom; she had to weep alone, and that is an unsatisfactory
  business. She realized it before long, and left off weeping.</p>

  <p>Although he was not near to comfort her, his letters were&mdash;two or
  three hundred of them; the burglar hadn&rsquo;t taken those. She took a
  bundle of them from the back of the drawer and untied the piece of blue
  ribbon, and removed the top letter and opened it; but she extracted very
  little comfort from it.</p>

  <p>It was the very last letter he had written her, and the five thousand
  dollars had been enclosed in the same registered envelope. No. We won&rsquo;t
  look over her shoulder.</p>

  <p>A man&rsquo;s love-letters make disgusting reading, and for that reason
  they ought to be sacred, if for no other. But part of that letter has a
  bearing on the story, and, as he was a very business-like young fellow for a
  lover when he was writing about business, and as he put all the poetry and
  kisses in the first six and the last ten pages, we can give part of the
  middle page without making anybody&rsquo;s gorge rise or offending
  anybody&rsquo;s sense of propriety. It was something like this:</p>

  <p>I have only saved five thousand dollars in all these years. (NOTE&mdash;He
  had on been saving for five years and five months. Pretty steady sort of
  young fellow that, eh?) It makes me feel like a beast when I think that I
  have only that much with which to begin life with you; if I had on met you
  earlier I would have saved more, for I would have had something to work for.
  I am sending you the money enclosed in this envelope; take it round to any
  good bank in your immediate neighborhood am open an account in your own name.
  The money will surely be safer in your hands than in mine, and as long as
  you&rsquo;ve got it I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be able to embark on any
  speculative undertaking without your consent. One of my chief faults is a
  desire to speculate and get rich quickly. A man came to me yesterday with a
  proposition that absolutely glittered, and I have seldom felt more tempted in
  my life; what made it still more tempting was the fact that I had the money;
  it was out on mortgage and I had called it in; the mortgagor, who happens to
  be a friend of mine, paid me yesterday. So in order to put myself out of the
  reach of further temptation of that kind I am mailing the whole of the five
  thousand dollars to you, where I know it will be safe.</p>

  <p>She read no further than that. She couldn&rsquo;t. The bitter irony of it
  was too much for her, and she knelt down again beside the bed with the letter
  all crumpled up in her fingers, and dropped great big salt tears all over it,
  and sobbed as though her heart would break.</p>

  <p>It wasn&rsquo;t all her fault, but what difference did that make? The
  money was gone. And he had trusted her. The registered letter had arrived
  after banking hours, and she had thought that the money would be safe in that
  drawer for one night, especially as nobody in the house knew she had it.</p>

  <p>Of course, she ought to have given it to somebody else&mdash;her landlady,
  for instance&mdash;to keep for her, but she hadn&rsquo;t thought of that; she
  had been too busy thinking how proud she was to be trusted like that, and how
  good Walter was&mdash;yes, his name was Walter&mdash;and what a fine, honest,
  straightforward, manly fellow he was, and how she loved him! And then she had
  gone to the dance! That was the cruelest part of it; if only she had kept her
  trust and stayed at home to watch the money, she could have fought for it,
  and died over it if need was; but the money had disappeared while she was out
  enjoying herself. And Walter had worked for five long years to save it!</p>

  <p>It would be kinder to leave her there to sob herself to sleep, but we
  can&rsquo;t do it; the requirements of a short story are as inexorable as
  fate itself, and she had more mortification in store for her yet.</p>

  <p>There was still a chance to recover the money, although it was a slim
  one.</p>

  <p>She summoned her landlady first; and when that elderly and excitable
  person had finished telling her what she knew already&mdash;that she was a
  ninny and a donkey and a rash, foolish, thoughtless female for leaving all
  that money loose in a bureau drawer&mdash;the two of them ran out just as
  they were, without either hats or cloaks on, to look for a policeman. And, of
  course, they couldn&rsquo;t find one.</p>

  <p>So they came back again and did what they should have done in the first
  instance&mdash;telephoned to headquarters; they overlooked that idea at first
  in the distress and excitement of the overwhelming disaster. After an almost
  interminable delay two policemen came&mdash;one in uniform and one in a blue
  serge suit. They both had muddy boots.</p>

  <p>They examined everything in the room, the window especially. They looked
  extremely wise at first, until they realized that Ikey had left no tracks at
  all; then they looked scornful and began to take notes.</p>

  <p>They trampled mud over everything, including some of the lingerie that was
  still lying on the floor; and they asked Lizzie Wingfield her age. and how
  long she&rsquo;d lived there; and the landlady her age, and how long
  she&rsquo;d lived there; and one of them sat on the bed; and the both of them
  kept their hats on, and when she didn&rsquo;t know the numbers of the bills
  they looked openly incredulous, and even the sight of the registered envelope
  in which the bills came failed to convince them.</p>

  <p>They said that they would make a report, and that the matter would be
  fully investigated, and went; but they left the impression behind them that
  they believed the whole thing to be a frame-up, and that young women who
  lived in rooms away from their parents, even when they were school-teachers
  and hadn&rsquo;t any parents, were people of no account, to put it
  mildly.</p>

  <p>And Lizzie Wingfield turned the light out and threw herself down on the
  bed without undressing and sobbed herself to sleep. And there for the present
  we will leave her.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"><small>CHAPTER III.</small> &mdash;<br>
  Ha, Ha! Woman Number Two! The Plot Thickens!</a></h2>

  <p class="first">KEYHOLE IKEY sat in the front parlor of his seven-room flat
in
  Eighty-First Street, and crooned the burglar&rsquo;s lullaby to his
  eldest-born. It is a sweetly sentimental song, and gets the youngsters off to
  sleep better than anything. Try it. This is the first verse:</p>

  <p>Sleep, my grafterling! None o&rsquo; your lip! You&rsquo;ll be a
  &ldquo;baron,&rdquo; though daddy&rsquo;s a &ldquo;dip&rdquo;! Daddy is
  watching for &ldquo;buzzards&rdquo; and &ldquo;screws,&rdquo; Cops cannot
  catch you; it&rsquo;s slumber for youse! The son of a &ldquo;gun&rdquo;
  should know better than weep, For &ldquo;suckers&rdquo; are born for him
  while he&rsquo;s asleep! Sleep, my grafterling! Cover your glims! Dreams of
  the &ldquo;boodle&rdquo; are better than hymns, So dream of the
  &ldquo;boodle&rdquo; and dream of the &ldquo;dough,&rdquo; Dream of the
  dodges a &ldquo;grafter&rdquo; should know! Hurry to dreamland before it gets
  light! Daddy must go on the &ldquo;rustle&rdquo; tonight!</p>

  <p>There are six more verses, and Ikey sang them all; while his eldest and
  only son lay face upward on his lap and knocked pieces off the welkin in
  celebration of the arrival of his first tooth. But Ikey was a proud and
  devoted father, and amazingly patient, so he sang the song all over again
  from the beginning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, sonny!&rdquo; he exclaimed when he had finished.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fitter to be a bull than a gun if you make so much noise!
  You gotter learn to keep quiet!&rdquo; But sonny wouldn&rsquo;t
  hush&mdash;not even when Mrs. Ikey came in and cuddled him.</p>

  <p>She is the second woman, so take due note of her. Petite, svelte, good-
  looking, copper-haired, tailor-made, neat, not in the least degree flashy.
  She was wearing just that amount of jewelry that the &ldquo;countess&rdquo;
  in the home notes column of the Married Woman&rsquo;s Weekly says one should
  wear in the park of an afternoon, and not one sparkler more.</p>

  <p>The diamonds were good ones, even if they did rightly belong to other
  people, but they were none of them very large or noticeable.</p>

  <p>She was quite an unusual woman was Mrs. Ikey, in more ways than one. She
  labored under no delusions as to Ikey&rsquo;s method of earning his living;
  she never had done, for that matter. She had married him with her eyes open
  after careful consideration of all the points involved.</p>

  <p>She had come to the conclusion that physical comfort, and nice dresses,
  and plenty to eat, together with the company of a crook who loved her, were
  preferable to the long days of toil and tribulation in a department-store,
  where she worked when Ikey met her. She herself was intensely respectable,
  and never even used slang.</p>

  <p>She went to church, and called on her friends, who were quite the
  &ldquo;best&rdquo; people in her immediate neighborhood; and she was
  charitable and agreeable, and not in the least stuck-up; in fact, as I said
  before, she was quite an unusual woman.</p>

  <p>She never came into contact with the tools of Ikey&rsquo;s trade, because
  Ikey did not keep them at the flat.</p>

  <p>Ikey had a little office several blocks away, with an electric meter in it
  that occasionally registered enormous quantities of current; but as Ikey
  always paid his bills promptly, it was nobody&rsquo;s business to make
  inquiries about that, and the sort of electric furnace that Ikey used takes
  up so little room that it is quite easily concealed.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Ikey handled the investment end of the business. She took the
  pecuniary proceeds, after Ikey had settled with the &ldquo;fence,&rdquo; and
  invested them in real estate bonds in her own name, so that even if Ikey
  should happen to be &ldquo;unfortunate,&rdquo; and get &ldquo;rapped,&rdquo;
  and &ldquo;soaked the limit,&rdquo; she would be well provided for,
  anyhow.</p>

  <p>And Ikey had drilled her carefully in all the devious by-routes of the
  criminal law, so that if he should happen to get &ldquo;lagged&rdquo; she
  would know exactly what to do and when to do it.</p>

  <p>She smiled at him bewitchingly as she relieved him of the squalling
  infant, and Ikey looked the very picture of contentment. Why shouldn&rsquo;t
  he? He had never for a single instant had cause to regret his marriage, and
  the pleased air of proprietorship with which he surveyed her would have made
  any woman proud; so she smiled at him again, and Ikey&rsquo;s world was all
  rose-pink and beautiful.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take him in the park a while. Ikey,&rdquo; she said;
  &ldquo;perhaps the fresh air will send him off to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; else will,&rdquo; said Ikey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried
  all the other stunts; sometimes the last shot sinks the ship, though; you go
  ahead and have a try. Say, but you&rsquo;re the swell guy this afternoon!
  They&rsquo;ll be thinkin&rsquo; your husband&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; these
  society dudes! Go on; you cut along into the park afore I fall in love with
  you all over again!?</p>

  <p>So Mrs. Ikey, smiling sweetly at her lord and master, put the baby into a
  brand new hundred dollar perambulator and wheeled him off to Central Park,
  while Ikey stayed at home to cogitate.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Ikey never did go about much in the afternoons; quite
  naturally he slept rather late, and ate his breakfast when other people were
  eating their luncheons; and after that he liked to sit about and read the
  paper. But this afternoon he was more than usually anxious to stay indoors
  and think.</p>

  <p>He had five thousand dollars in his coat-pocket, and he was undecided what
  to do with it. Added to what Mrs. Ikey had salted down already, it was still
  not quite enough money to retire on; doubled it would just do. And Ikey was
  by birth, and upbringing, and instinct, and inclination, first and last, a
  born gambler. Mrs. Ikey had weaned him of the habit at the time she married
  him; but the desire still remained; and here was a gorgeous opportunity for
  one big, final plunge without consulting Mrs. Ikey.</p>

  <p>If he lost the money she would know nothing about it, for he had said
  nothing to her yet about his haul of the night before; and if he doubled it,
  or trebled it&mdash;Gee! It was almost too good to think about. He was still
  undecided when Mrs. Ikey came back two hours later with the child.</p>

  <p>He noticed that his wife seemed to be singularly disturbed about something
  on her return, but he asked her no questions; Ikey had ideas of his own about
  the management of women, and having found them successful in practise, he
  acted up to them.</p>

  <p>It was a part of his fixed policy never to meet trouble half-way, and to
  wait until his wife chose to make a disturbance before attempting to find out
  the reason for it or to quell it. So he sat back in his arm-chair, and held
  his tongue, and waited. But he had not to wait for long.</p>

  <p>She put the infant to bed in another room, and in less than ten
  minutes&rsquo; time she was back again into the parlor to talk to him; and
  Ikey, irritated into a condition of extreme sensitiveness by his abstention
  from coffee and cigarettes, knew at once, even before she put her arms round
  his neck, that something big was coming.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where were you last night, Ikey?&rdquo; she asked him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Business, as usual,&rdquo; said Ikey, who hated talking
  &ldquo;shop&rdquo; when he saw no necessity for it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why I want to know. When I was going into the
  park just now, Ikey, I passed one of the prettiest, sweetest-looking girls I
  ever saw. She was sitting on one of the seats crying. I sat down on the seat
  beside her; I simply couldn&rsquo;t go past her, Ikey, she looked so sad and
  miserable; and after a while I got into conversation with her. One
  couldn&rsquo;t sit there and say nothing; it was simply heart-breaking; so I
  spoke to her after a while, and asked her if I couldn&rsquo;t do anything for
  her, or help her in any way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And she touched you for a five-spot, I suppose?&rdquo; said
  Ikey.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no! She wasn&rsquo;t that kind at all. She said no, and got up
  and wanted to go away; she was evidently an awfully nice girl, and
  didn&rsquo;t like talking to strangers. But I held her back, and after a
  minute or two I convinced her that I really wanted to hear her story and see
  whether I couldn&rsquo;t help her. She said she was sure I couldn&rsquo;t
  help her, but she told me the story.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some &lsquo;con&rsquo; game, I&rsquo;ll bet!&rdquo; remarked Ikey
  in an undertone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems she is engaged to be married. The man she is going to
  marry, or was going to&mdash;she can&rsquo;t marry him now&mdash;lives in San
  Francisco, and he sent her five thousand dollars, all the money he had in the
  world, to keep for him until he came to New York.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a rummy!&rdquo; murmured Ikey.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She put the money in a bureau drawer and went out to a dance; and
  while she was away somebody came into the room and forced the drawer open and
  took it. Was it you, Ikey?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ikey said nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because if it was you, Ikey, I&rsquo;d like you to give it back to
  her. She&rsquo;s a nice girl&mdash;you&rsquo;d never believe how nice until
  you&rsquo;d seen her&mdash;and taking her money is the cruelest shame I ever
  heard of; I wouldn&rsquo;t stand for it a minute; Ikey, I wouldn&rsquo;t,
  really! Was it you, Ikey?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ikey said nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course, Ikey, if you had taken it I should quite understand that
  you did it not knowing the circumstances; you couldn&rsquo;t possibly have
  known. And I&rsquo;m ever so sure you wouldn&rsquo;t do a mean thing like
  that with your eyes open, would you, Ikey? And now that you do know, and
  supposing you did take the money, you&rsquo;ll give it back, won&rsquo;t you,
  Ikey?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ikey still said nothing, and she laid one hand on each of his shoulders
  and looked him straight in the eyes. And Ikey hung his head. He still said
  nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Ikey, you know when we married we both of us promised
  we&rsquo;d never tell each other any lies, whatever we might agree to tell
  other people&mdash;didn&rsquo;t we? You&rsquo;re not going back on that
  promise now, Ikey, are you? Was it you that took that five thousand dollars,
  Ikey?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; groaned Ikey, &ldquo;I took it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I got it here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, give it back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet your life I&rsquo;ll give it back!&rdquo; said Ikey,
  turning at last, as any worm will turn, and throwing her hands off his
  shoulders. Then he grasped her shoulders in turn and shook her almost
  savagely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See here, my gal! I love you good and plenty, and we&rsquo;ve got
  on good together. I&rsquo;ve told you no lies, and you haven&rsquo;t told me
  any, an&rsquo; that was part o&rsquo; the bargain. But there was another part
  to that bargain, and you seem to be forgettin&rsquo; it. How about your
  promisin&rsquo; not to chip in until I gave the word? Now didn&rsquo;t you
  promise?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Ikey,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I promised. But this
  isn&rsquo;t exactly chipping in. This is different. That girl has got to have
  her money back! I&rsquo;d hate to think I was spending so much as a penny of
  it&mdash;it would make me wretched. Think how happy we&rsquo;ve been, Ikey!
  You wouldn&rsquo;t like to take away that girl&rsquo;s chance of being happy
  too, would you, Ikey? She&rsquo;s a good girl, and a nice girl; she never
  harmed anybody in her life. You couldn&rsquo;t do it, Ikey! I know you
  couldn&rsquo;t! You&rsquo;re not mean enough!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ikey swore. Never mind what he said; this is a moral story; it is
  sufficient to say that Ikey felt his determination slipping away from under
  him, and that he swore.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;you know it&rsquo;s the right girl?&rdquo; he asked.
  &ldquo;How d&rsquo;you know it ain&rsquo;t one o&rsquo; these here wise molls
  pulling off a &lsquo;con&rsquo; game? Did she give you her address by any
  chance?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I asked her for it. Her name&rsquo;s Lizzie Wingfield, and she
  lives in that big apartment house four blocks away from here on the north
  side of the street - the Harlemia it&rsquo;s called&mdash;and she rents a
  back bedroom in one of the flats on the second floor. Now, Ikey, does that
  tally? Wasn&rsquo;t that the one?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ikey nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll give it back?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo; said Ikey, getting up and reaching for his hat.
  &ldquo;Lemme think it over; I&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Ikey; think it over! But if you want me to go on loving
  you, think twice, Ikey, and let it be yes both times!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now isn&rsquo;t that just like a woman?&rdquo; mumbled Ikey as he
  started down the stairs.</p>

  <p>When Ikey reached the bottom of the stairs he paused for a moment in the
  hallway. He was thinking of that gambling notion of his again, and the
  thought of it was singularly sweet. Horses were his pet fancy.</p>

  <p>He knew nothing about horses themselves, but he knew all about their form
  on paper, and there had been a time, not so very long ago, when Ikey was
  known personally to every book-maker on the turf.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly, laying his long
  index-finger to the side of his extraordinary nose. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
  swell idea! A1. Couldn&rsquo;t beat it! If I win I&rsquo;ll do what the
  missus says, give the gal back her money, suit myself and the missus and
  everybody else, and be five or ten thousand in. And if I lose I&rsquo;ll be
  no worse off, anyhow! It&rsquo;s a bet! I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He walked about eight blocks to let the idea soak in, and on the way it
  occurred to him that there might be some difficulty about placing a big bet
  on the course unless he made arrangements for it.</p>

  <p>So he turned into a hotel where there were writing-tables provided in the
  foyer, and wrote the following letter:</p>

  <p>DEAR ABE: You&rsquo;ve not seen me for quite a while, but I ain&rsquo;t
  dead yet not by a darn sight. I&rsquo;ve only been a bit broke, that&rsquo;s
  all, and you know I always bet big, and never bet at all unless I&rsquo;ve
  got the cash. I&rsquo;m coming down to the course on Saturday next, and if
  you&rsquo;re there I&rsquo;m going to have a try for some of your money;
  I&rsquo;m bringing down about five thousand of the real thing with me, and
  I&rsquo;m going to make a real big splurge with it. I&rsquo;ve got some
  inside dope about a certain horse that&rsquo;ll act on your bank-roll like a
  Turkish bath; It&rsquo;ll thin her out considerable. So bring along plenty of
  mazuma with you, and get ready to leave it behind you with a good grace, for
  I shall surely clean you out. Hoping this finds you as it leaves me, A1,
  believe me, Yours till the last bell rings, IKEY HOLE.</p>

  <p>He sealed the letter and addressed it to Mr. Abraham Maxstein, turf
  accountant, and he posted it with a grin that savored of pleasant
  recollections.</p>

  <p>That done, he strolled, home again leisurely, and told his wife that he
  would take an early opportunity of returning the money. When she pressed him
  for information as to the exact date on which he would do it, he answered
  &ldquo;within a week,&rdquo; and not another word could she get out of
  him.</p>

  <p>When she finally left off nagging him about it, he settled down in his
  shirt- sleeves to the careful study of a Turf Guide, and he got so much
  interest out of it that he had to he summoned twice to dinner for the first
  time in history.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"><small>CHAPTER IV.</small> &mdash;<br>
  Enter The Hero! The Plot Gets Thicker Still</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NOW we must see what Lizzie Wingfield is doing all this
time. A young lady
  who has just lost five thousand dollars, to say nothing of her hopes of an
  early wedding, at one swift, sudden swoop cannot fail to be interesting, even
  if she is too unhappy to be amusing.</p>

  <p>As we have seen, a strange lady met her in the park and talked to her, and
  was very sympathetic, and found out her address; but that hadn&rsquo;t helped
  her in the least so far as she could see; she was still hopeless, and from
  time to time she still wept.</p>

  <p>She had written to San Francisco&mdash;a long, tearful letter, in which
  she told Walter Bavin all about it&mdash;how the money had disappeared, and
  how she had informed the police, and how rude the police had been, and how
  she would never forgive herself even if he forgave her, which she had no
  right to expect he would do, and oh! reams and reams of that kind of thing;
  the extra postage on the letter had cost her thirty cents. And all she had to
  do then was sit down and wait for the answer.</p>

  <p>She could hardly be expected to be happy. Letters take several days to get
  to San Francisco, and answers take several other days to come back again; she
  figured it out closely, and saw no prospect whatever of getting an answer
  before Saturday, and waiting for it was just like sitting in an electric
  chair and waiting for the warden&rsquo;s assistant to turn on the
  current.</p>

  <p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t she weep? The suspense was partly broken on the
  Wednesday, for she received a telegram from Walter&mdash;Walter
  Bavin&mdash;that evening; but it was so short, and the contents of it were so
  unexpected and so altogether irrelevant that she extracted very little
  encouragement from it; in fact the only consolation she drew from it at all
  was the fact that he had apparently forgotten to cancel his engagement. It
  ran:</p>

  <p>Your letter received. Say nothing. Inform nobody. Await my letter. WALTER
  BAVIN.</p>

  <p>Now what the dickens could that mean? What sort of consolation could a
  poor girl drag out of that? She puzzled over it, and worried about it, and
  lay awake at night trying to read all sorts of possible and impossible
  meanings in between the two brief lines, until she became very nearly
  ill.</p>

  <p>But there was nothing else for it but to wait for the promised letter, and
  obey orders in the mean time by holding her tongue; and no woman, young or
  old, likes to do that.</p>

  <p>She would very likely have gone mad, and spoiled the story in that way, if
  she hadn&rsquo;t been a school-teacher; but school-teachers are so used to
  putting up with diabolically ingenious torment at the hands of other people
  that the ordinary slings and arrows of outrageous fortune don&rsquo;t break
  them down as they would ordinary people. She kept a sort of half-Nelson on
  her sanity, and wept and waited.</p>

  <p>Then came the letter. It was shorter than usual. There were two whole
  pages less of love-stuff; she knew that because she read them first. The
  beginning of the middle part amazed her, because Walter Bavin appeared to
  care much less about the loss of the five thousand dollars than he did about
  its loss becoming known.</p>

  <p>There were two whole pages of reiterated commands to her to hold her
  tongue, though he only used that coarse expression once; all the other times
  he expressed it quite courteously but firmly none the less.</p>

  <p>By the time that she had skimmed through the first seven pages of the
  letter she was almost ready to scream for she had been brought up to always
  know the reason why of things, and her every instinct tended in that
  direction, and here was a long-drawn-out pen-and-ink mystery that cut off her
  woman&rsquo;s one prerogative of talking without a word of explanation. But
  she read on. And presently she did scream.</p>

  <p>Her whole world, or all that the vanished five thousand dollars had left
  of it, her faith in humanity, her hopes for the future, and, worst of all,
  her belief in her lover seemed to be sliding away from under her feet.</p>

  <p>The room rocked and swayed; the electric light above her head seemed to he
  going round and round and round; and the letter swam before her eyes until
  she couldn&rsquo;t read it; and then big tears began to fall on it; and the
  storm broke. Never mind what she did then.</p>

  <p>It is neither decent nor amusing to intrude on the privacy of a young
  woman at the moment when the crisis of her life arrives, and she stands
  stripped suddenly of faith and hope and charity to face the world alone, This
  is part of what she read:</p>

  <p>Those fifty one-hundred-dollar bills were stolen from the trust company of
  which I am cashier, although they were not stolen from my department, and as
  yet the directors do not suspect me. They will, though, if you advertise the
  loss of them, and then it will be all up.</p>

  <p>So&mdash;he had lied to her! He had said they were his savings, and all
  the time he knew they were stolen money. He had&mdash;But let us draw the
  curtain, and leave her alone. We can?t help her, or at least not yet, and the
  agony of a fellow creature, especially of a lonely fellow creature, is not a
  pleasing spectacle.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"><small>CHAPTER V.</small> &mdash;<br>
  In Which Ikey Makes A Killing, And Enjoys Himself</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WATCH Ikey now. He is off to Aqueduct races in a chess-
board suit of gray
  with a red stripe in it; he is wearing a purple tie fastened with his lucky
  topaz stick-pin, and a broad-brimmed derby hat with a low crown, and purple
  socks that just show over the edge of his shiny brown shoes.</p>

  <p>He doesn&rsquo;t look a bit like the same Ikey. His furtive look is gone
  completely, and he strides along with quite a jaunty air, smoking a
  twenty-five-cent cigar with a big red and gold band round it. Cigars were not
  included in his oath of abstinence.</p>

  <p>He has eaten fish for breakfast, because he always has good luck on the
  days when he eats fish; and he has given half a dollar to a blind man, and
  has patted a spotty dog; and when he got out of bed he carefully put his left
  slipper on his right foot; and he has bought a new pack of cards at the
  nearest stationer&rsquo;s and cut the ace of diamonds at the first try; in
  fact he has left no stone unturned and no deed undone that could help to make
  the day auspicious. And to crown it all, as he walked toward the railway
  station, he saw a skew-bald horse between the shafts of a grocer&rsquo;s cart
  and two milk-white horses immediately afterward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; said Ikey to himself. &ldquo;This is my lucky day! I
  know it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He wasn&rsquo;t known as Keyhole Ikey on the race-course. Not a bit of it.
  There they all greeted him as &ldquo;Old King Cole,&rdquo; and were
  uncommonly glad to see him. As Old King Cole, and &ldquo;Coley&rdquo; for
  short, he had accumulated in days gone by a reputation as a &ldquo;fall
  guy&rdquo; and a &ldquo;good spender&rdquo; and a
  &ldquo;sucker&rdquo;&mdash;just the sort of man they like to see at a race
  meeting.</p>

  <p>Naturally it was the bookies who liked him the best, and they greeted him
  most effusively; but on this occasion Ikey had very little to say to any of
  them. He kept his own counsel, and worked his way gradually to where Abe
  Maxstein, a Hebrew gentleman of plethoric paunch and purple countenance, was
  bellowing out the odds on the first race.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; shouted Abe. &ldquo;Why, dash my Sam if here
  ain&rsquo;t Old King Cole again! Lookin&rsquo; like a winner, too! How goes
  it, Coley??</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; answered Ikey. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s yourself? Get my
  letter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure thing. What&rsquo;s your fancy in the first race?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nix!&rdquo; said Ikey. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t bettin&rsquo; on the
  first race.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never! You standin&rsquo; out while there&rsquo;s anythin&rsquo; on
  four legs runnin&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t believe it! What&rsquo;s come over you
  all of a sudden?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to have a plunge on the third,&rdquo; answered Ikey,
  his face screwed up knowingly, and that remarkable nose of his twitching
  thirteen to the dozen; &ldquo;a feller I know pretty well slipped me the
  dope.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Coley, name your gee! You can get all you want here.
  I&rsquo;ll lay you the odds against any horse you like in the third
  race&mdash;here&rsquo;s the list&mdash;now, then, what&rsquo;s your
  fancy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll wait till the numbers go up,&rdquo; answered
  Ikey.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t! Come on now! I&rsquo;ll lay you a fair price
  and give you a run for your money. If the horse don&rsquo;t run you get your
  money back. Now then, which is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tiddliwinks,&rdquo; said Ikey.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ho, ho! So that&rsquo;s the lay of the land, is it? Evens
  Tiddliwinks! I&rsquo;ll lay you even money. That horse&rsquo;ll start two to
  one on or I&rsquo;m a liar! How much d&rsquo;you want at evens?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Five thousand,&rdquo; said Ikey quietly, handing up the fifty
  hundred dollar bills all fastened neatly together with a rubber hand.</p>

  <p>Abe Maxstein&rsquo;s face froze like an iceberg. But Abe had offered Ikey
  all he wanted, and the crowd had heard him, so Abe had to make good his
  boast. He examined the bills very closely, and counted them very carefully,
  but he did not slip off the rubber band, and he tossed the whole bundle into
  his bag just as Ikey had given it to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ten thousand dollars Old King Cole on Tiddliwinks in the third
  race!&rdquo; he said to his clerk, and the clerk wrote it down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You been robbin&rsquo; a bank, or what?&rdquo; he asked Ikey.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to rob you, same as I warned you in my
  letter,&rdquo; Ikey answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cinch&mdash;almost a shame
  to take the money!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I seen some o&rsquo; your cinches before!&rdquo; said Abe
  scornfully, and Ikey sauntered away to the grand stand to watch the
  running.</p>

  <p>Abe Maxstein&rsquo;s clerk had been busy chalking up the runners and
  prices for the third race on a big blackboard, seeing that people seemed
  already anxious to bet on that race; and against the name of Tiddliwinks he
  wrote &ldquo;evens.&rdquo; Abe Maxstein turned and looked at it; and then he
  looked at Ikey, fast disappearing in the crowd.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder what that guy knows!&rdquo; he muttered. Then he wetted
  his fat thumb and rubbed out the word &ldquo;evens,&rdquo; and wrote instead
  the cryptic figures ; he had laid all he cared to against that horse.</p>

  <p>Every other bookie on the course followed suit promptly, and Ikey had the
  satisfaction of changing the quotation of a horse by his own unaided effort
  for the first time in his life.</p>

  <p>Ikey took not the slightest interest in the first two races, for he had no
  money on. He watched them, but his face wore a cynical smile, and as the
  first two horses in the second race fought it out neck and neck near the
  winning- post, he actually turned his head to light a fresh cigar. But the
  third race was quite another matter.</p>

  <p>He began to grow excited the moment the saddling-bell rang, and he craned
  his neck so eagerly to see the horses come filing out one by one onto the
  course that the man standing next to him turned and cursed him soundly for
  crowding.</p>

  <p>Ikey did not even look at the horses, but he studied the jockies&rsquo;
  jackets and the numbers intently, and from the moment that his eyes rested on
  the red and yellow jacket with green stripes that Tiddliwinks&rsquo;s jockey
  wore they never left it again for an instant. He hardly even blinked.</p>

  <p>It was a short race&mdash;six furlongs&mdash;a mere scamper between two
  poles; but there were sixteen runners, and more than a little depended on
  luck at the start.</p>

  <p>Ikey watched the kicking, plunging, fidgeting field that lined up to the
  barrier with eyes that were almost starting out of his head, and he made a
  sound that was half squeal and half grunt as the barrier went up, and the
  horses shot away, with Tiddliwinks well in the lead.</p>

  <p>Down the course they came&mdash;a thundering, flogging, panting stampede
  of men and horses&mdash;and Ikey twisted and squirmed and swore, and rubbed
  his nose, and tugged at his little black mustache, and bit his new cigar in
  two in an ecstasy of torture.</p>

  <p>Neck and neck went Tiddliwinks with three other horses, all four of them
  straining every muscle and every nerve that was in them, and not one of them
  so highly strained as Ikey; his heart was in his mouth and in his shoes
  alternately as first Tiddliwinks and then some other horse took the lead for
  half a second.</p>

  <p>The thing was over like a flash. All four horses streaked past the
  winning- post in a bunch, with the other twelve trailing out at intervals,
  behind them. The thing was so close that nobody on the grand stand could tell
  which of them was the winner; it looked like a dead heat of four horses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tiddliwinks!&rdquo; roared somebody; &ldquo;Jonas,&rdquo; shouted
  ten other men; &ldquo;Galahad,&rdquo; yelled a crowd of people; opinions were
  pretty evenly divided. Ikey watched the number-board. And Ikey groaned. And
  Ikey&rsquo;s fingers were clenched so tightly that they hurt his palms.</p>

  <p>Ikey&rsquo;s face was as pallid as a sheet, and his knees trembled, and
  his breath came through his quivering nostrils in short, sharp gasps, as he
  held it till the last possible second, and released it suddenly, and filled
  his lungs again th a jerk. And then up went the numbers, and Ikey sighed; 7,
  13, 5 in that order.</p>

  <p>Seven was&mdash;Tiddliwinks!</p>

  <p>Tiddliwinks had won. And Ikey had enjoyed himself. Ikey was the calmest
  man on the course now. Unless you had watched him while the race was on you
  would never have believed that he had had a cent on the result. He left the
  grand stand quite leisurely, and strolled toward Abe Maxstein&rsquo;s stand
  with his hands in his pockets and an air of almost boredom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Coley!&rdquo; shouted Abe. &ldquo;You made a killing that
  time, and no mistake! What are you goin&rsquo; to bet on in the
  next?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nix!&rdquo; said Ikey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m through! This is where I
  draw your money, same as I promised!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What? Not goin&rsquo; to have another bet!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not today! Come on, shovel out! It&rsquo;s about your
  turn!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Coley, all right. Suit yourself! I&rsquo;ll have it all
  back again one o&rsquo; these days. You watch! Here
  y&rsquo;are&mdash;here&rsquo;s your five thousand back&mdash;same bundle you
  gave me. Looks like good money to me, all right, but you never can tell.
  Anyhow, you&rsquo;ve got it back again, whether it&rsquo;s good or bad; and
  here&rsquo;s the rest. That&rsquo;s a thousand-dollar bill, in case you never
  seen one before; an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s two o&rsquo; five hundred, an&rsquo;
  here y&rsquo;are two more fives, an&rsquo; five, ten, fifteen, twenty
  centuries. There! Are ye satisfied?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right y&rsquo;are!&rdquo; said Ikey. &ldquo;Always did get a square
  deal from you, Abe! S&rsquo;long! Oh, hi, Abe! Half a minute! Got change for
  this thou?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. You stick to what you&rsquo;ve got, and thank your lucky
  stars you&rsquo;ve got it! No time to make change! Now, then&mdash;runners in
  the fourth race.&rdquo; And he started calling out the names. And Ikey
  pouched his money, and turned his face homeward with a bulging pocket and a
  feeling of absolute contentment permeating his whole anatomy.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"><small>CHAPTER VI.</small> &mdash;<br>
  In Which Ikey&rsquo;s Streak Of Luck Begins To Hold Out Symptoms Of Getting
  Thin</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THESE rapid changes of scene are growing just a trifle
bewildering,
  aren&rsquo;t they? But there is worse to come. We&rsquo;re back again now
  with Lizzie Wingfield. She hasn&rsquo;t gone to bed yet. She hasn&rsquo;t
  even undressed. She is sitting in the rocker by the window, crying a little
  from time to time, and much too miserable to notice anything, or care about
  anything, or even think about anything except the hollowness and mockery and
  rottenness of all the wide, wide world.</p>

  <p>Very nice people who have very nice ideas always tumble down into the
  depths of despair when their exquisitely fine-drawn notions fail for once to
  pan out. It is only crooks and people like ourselves who can view things
  dispassionately.</p>

  <p>If you had told Lizzie Wingfield at that minute that there was any common
  honesty or kindness or sense of fair play to be found in the universe, she
  wouldn&rsquo;t have believed you. She would have been quite polite, but
  unconvinced.</p>

  <p>There was a little noise that came from just behind her&mdash;ever such a
  tiny little noise&mdash;the sort of noise that a mouse might make. And she
  didn&rsquo;t notice it. The noise was repeated two or three times.</p>

  <p>It came from underneath the blind that hid the window behind her chair
  scratch! scratch! tick! tick!&mdash;and then, all at once&mdash;snack! quite
  loud and sudden. But still she didn&rsquo;t notice it. Then the window began
  to rise, slowly, gently, ever so gently, inch by inch, Silently, until the
  bottom half of it was up almost as far as it would go.</p>

  <p>She felt the draft then, for the wind blew the blind out into the room
  until it nearly hit the back of her chair; and she got up to change her
  position.</p>

  <p>She started to pull her chair over into another corner of the room, and in
  doing so she faced the window; and as she faced it the blind went up suddenly
  with a whir-r-r and a clack! and the black, dark, rainy night outside became
  visible, with something almost as dark that crouched and moved on the window-
  sill between her and the murkiness beyond. And she didn&rsquo;t scream. Like
  her now, eh?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said a voice. &ldquo;Hush, missie! Not a word! I
  won&rsquo;t hurt yer! I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo; in, but I won&rsquo;t do a thing
  to yer! Not a word, now! Quiet!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She didn&rsquo;t care. What if all the burglars in the world came in! They
  could take her wedding trousseau if they cared to. Goodness knew she
  didn&rsquo;t want it, and there was nothing else to take! And if they killed
  her? Bah! What did she care for that, either! She would be really and truly
  glad to die.</p>

  <p>She drew the chair back to make room for the burglar, or whatever he might
  be, and Keyhole Ikey stepped down into the room&mdash;Keyhole Ikey, dressed
  in his professional costume of almost black serge suit, black gloves and very
  dark gray cap.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Ikey again, turning to close the window after
  him, and holding one warning finger up to his wicked-looking nose. He closed
  the window carefully and then pulled down the blind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darned clumsy of me!&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I oughter ha&rsquo;
  got used to them roller- shades by now. Fancy me springin&rsquo; that one
  like a new beginner! Now, missie, is the door locked?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can see for yourself!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Why do you
  ask? Have you come to kill me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kill you! Lord love you, no! The very idee! Look alive, missie,
  an&rsquo; lock that door&mdash;that&rsquo;s a good gal; I gotter be kinder
  quick. Go on, now; it&rsquo;s up&rsquo; to you. You&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo;
  this apartment&mdash;not me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She walked over to the door and locked it, amazed at her own meekness in
  obeying him so promptly. Then she leaned her back against the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, what is it?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

  <p>Ikey fumbled in his inside pocket. In one pocket he had the fifty hundred-
  dollar bills that he had stolen, and in the other was the bundle of odd
  amounts that the bookmaker had paid him.</p>

  <p>Both amounted to the same sum; but whereas it could make no possible
  difference to the lady which roll she received so long as she got her five
  thousand dollars back, it might make a lot of difference to him. A hundred-
  dollar bill is easily negotiable anywhere, and a thousand-dollar bill is not.
  He found the right pocket at last, and laid the bookie&rsquo;s money on the
  dressing- table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There y&rsquo;are, missie! There&rsquo;s your money back! I&rsquo;m
  the guy what took it! A little bird told me as how you needed it bad, so I
  brought it back to yer. It ain&rsquo;t the same identical money; but it
  ain&rsquo;t green goods, I give yer my word, an&rsquo; it comes to the same
  amount. Go on count it! I&rsquo;m in a hurry!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pushed the bundle of bills a hit farther along the dressing-table and
  drew back toward the corner, so as not to frighten her.</p>

  <p>Imagine her sensations! Here was the utterly unheard-of happening under
  her very eyes&mdash;apparently the key to half her troubles thrust into her
  hand by an absolute stranger in her own room at half past eleven at night a
  self-confessed burglar handing back the money he had stolen, and without a
  hint of compulsion!</p>

  <p>It was not a bolt from the blue; it was a bomb from the black. Of course,
  she didn&rsquo;t believe it. She stood staring at him, with her eyes wide
  open, round and wondering. And Ikey laughed, and his laughter broke the spell
  to some extent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite true, missie! I ain&rsquo;t kiddin&rsquo; yer!
  Come on&mdash;count your money an&rsquo; let me git!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She walked over to the dressing-table and counted the bills like a woman
  in a trance, and still refusing to believe her senses. But there was no
  blinking the fact that on the table lay five thousand dollars. She counted it
  twice to make sure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That right, missie?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t! O&rsquo; course you
  don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t try to! Lord love yer! why, what&rsquo;s the
  matter with the woman? I took your money, an&rsquo; there it is back again;
  there y&rsquo;are! There it is, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s all about it! All
  you&rsquo;ve got to do now is hold your tongue an&rsquo; look
  wise&mdash;savvy? Put me down as a white guy that didn&rsquo;t want to harm
  yer, an&rsquo; there you&rsquo;ve got it. Now, good night, missie! Take my
  tip an&rsquo; go to bed&mdash;hit the hay an&rsquo; play you&rsquo;ve been
  dreamin&rsquo;! You&rsquo;ll find the money all there in the mornin&rsquo;,
  so kid yerself you never lost it! An&rsquo; shove it in the bank first time
  you get the chance, missie, so&rsquo;s folks like me don&rsquo;t get another
  chance at it. So-long, missie. Good luck!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Keyhole Ikey opened the window again softly and disappeared by the way
  he had come. When he had gone, Lizzie Wingfield stood and stared first at the
  closed window, and then at the money in her hand, and stared, and stared,
  and- pinched herself to see if she were dreaming, or dead, or what; but the
  bills were there, and they were tough and soft and crinkly; and the pinch
  hurt her, and made a little red mark come on her white arm, and no, she
  didn&rsquo;t believe it. It was altogether too impossible, and too absolutely
  good to be true.</p>

  <p>Once again Ikey climbed quietly down the fire-escape, and dropped ten feet
  or so into the yard beneath him. Then he crouched in the shadow of the wall
  for two whole minutes and listened. There was nothing moving, that Ikey could
  hear, so he sneaked out of the yard, following the passage that led to the
  street in front.</p>

  <p>At the end of the passage was a gate; it was an iron gate that squeaked on
  its hinges when people opened it; so Ikey placed one hand on the top of it
  and vaulted. And as he sprang an ominous blue form stepped out-from the
  darkness, and a voice said gruffly: &ldquo;What ha&rsquo; you been doing in
  there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ikey ran. Goodness, how he ran! And he could sprint, could Ikey. He ran
  like the wind, dodging all the time into the shadows, thinking as he ran, and
  picking his way where it might be hard to follow him. But Patrolman Baines
  was on his track; and Patrolman Baines had done a quarter once in fifty-two.
  He was new to his job; and keen as mustard, fit as the proverbial fiddle, and
  game as a wagon-load of tigers.</p>

  <p>Ikey panted, and swore beneath his breath. Patrolman Baines panted, and
  put on a spurt and grabbed him. Ikey ducked. The patrolman stumbled, and Ikey
  tripped him.</p>

  <p>But Baines was an athlete as well as a sprinter; he grabbed Ikey more
  firmly as he fell, and the two went down together, and in less than a second
  Ikey lay face upward on the pavement in the grip of a hammerlock hold that
  nearly wrenched his bones apart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Patrolman Baines, &ldquo;you?ll come along
  o&rsquo; me an&rsquo; give an account o&rsquo; yourself. Are you comin&rsquo;
  quiet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; said Ikey. &ldquo;Go ahead; I know the way.&rdquo; The
  patrolman held him by the sleeve, too confident in his own strength to
  trouble about putting on the handcuffs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What were you doin&rsquo; in there? he asked. But Ikey, with the
  wisdom of the wise, said nothing.</p>

  <p>They welcomed Ikey at the stationhouse&mdash;gave him a ringing welcome,
  for they all knew him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw! Can all that chin stuff!&rdquo; said Ikey. &ldquo;What am I
  charged with?&rdquo; &ldquo;With being a suspected person,&rdquo; said the
  lieutenant, writing in the book before him. &ldquo;Put him in the cooler and
  search him.&rdquo; So Ikey was led below.</p>

  <p>It took them just ten seconds to find the five thousand dollars in
  Ikey&rsquo;s pocket, and thirty seconds more to tell the news to the
  lieutenant, who wrote down the numbers of the notes carefully and then rang
  up police headquarters on the phone. After about five minutes&rsquo;
  conversation over the wire, during which he referred repeatedly to the notes
  in front of him, he hung up the receiver with a jerk and ordered:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fetch that guy up here again. We may as well alter the charge now
  as later.&rdquo; So Ikey was once again stood up before the
  lieutenant&rsquo;s desk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re charged now,&rdquo; said the lieutenant, &ldquo;with
  being in possession of stolen goods, to wit, book-notes the property of the
  San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Sacramento Trust Company, as well as with
  being a suspected person and being found in possession of burglar&rsquo;s
  tools.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw!&rdquo; said Ikey. &ldquo;That all? Can&rsquo;t yer think
  o&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; else? Ain&rsquo;t the city hall missin&rsquo;, or
  somethin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Put him back in the cooler!&rdquo; ordered the lieutenant; and back
  Ikey went.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"><small>CHAPTER VII.</small> &mdash;<br>
  Across The Continent</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE is no means of helping Ikey just for the moment; the
police have got
  him, and it takes a bigger pull than we have got to unclutch their fingers.
  So we must leave him in confinement, and leave Mrs. Ikey&mdash;tailormade and
  tearful - rushing round New York arranging bail bonds. She ought to be able
  to manage that all right, seeing what careful drilling Ikey has given her
  with a view to just such an unfortunate occurrence. This story has got to
  move, and we must move with it; so we are in San Francisco now. The offices
  of the San Francisco, Los Angeles and Sacramento Trust Company stand at the
  corner of one of the many streets leading down to the harbor, and the
  president&rsquo;s suite is in 4, the front of the building, two flights up.
  We are in the president&rsquo;s private office now. We have finished gaping
  in silent and respectful wonder at the richness of the furnishings and the
  splendor of the ten-pile turkey carpet, and we are watching the president
  himself&mdash;a middle-aged man with a red neck and a parting that reaches
  from ear to ear. He looks angry, and he is. He has reason to be.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come here, Brown!&rdquo; says the president in a voice that sounds
  like a garbage- can being dumped into an ash-cart. And a long-nosed,
  pale-faced man named Brown comes running from the next room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; orders the president; and Brown sits down opposite
  to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make head or tail of this business,&rdquo; says the
  president; &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ve got to start for New York
  on tonight&rsquo;s train; so I&rsquo;ve no time to look into it. You&rsquo;ll
  have to do it. If only young Walter Bavin were here! But just when I want him
  most the young idiot throws up his job and goes to New York to marry some
  infernal woman!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;d gone.&rdquo; Brown, be it noted, is
  a superior sort of person who affects to ignore any one below the rank of
  manager.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, take it from me that he has! That&rsquo;ll save time!
  He left the day before yesterday, and I&rsquo;m sorry he&rsquo;s gone. Now,
  then, you remember that five thousand dollars that was missing from the
  receiving-teller&rsquo;s department a short time ago? Well, all I did about
  it was to notify the police and give them the numbers of the missing notes;
  we&rsquo;d had them straight from the United States Treasury; so that was
  easy. I didn&rsquo;t offer a reward, and, in fact, I thought very little more
  about it; the sum wasn&rsquo;t big enough to make a fuss over. But see here
  what&rsquo;s happened. Look at this&mdash;and this&mdash;and this!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He tossed three envelopes onto the table, and in each of the envelopes was
  five thousand dollars in bills. In the first envelope, which bore the San
  Francisco postmark, was a piece of white paper, on which was written in a
  disguised hand, &ldquo;Returned with thanks by the man who took
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In the second envelope, which bore the Los Angeles postmark, was another
  and smaller envelope, on the outside of which were written the words,
  &ldquo;Herewith the missing five thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And in the third envelope, which had the New York postmark on it, was a
  telegram-blank on which somebody had printed, in capitals, &ldquo;This money
  was recently stolen from you; please take it back and forgive the
  thief.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>None of the three communications bore any signature, and, beyond the
  postmark, not one of them gave any clue to its sender&rsquo;s identity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now, look here!&rdquo; said the president. &ldquo;Not one of
  the bills contained in either of those envelopes bears a number corresponding
  to any of the stolen ones; and here&rsquo;s a telegram I&rsquo;ve just
  received from the chief of police in New York, stating that they&rsquo;ve
  captured a man there with every one of our missing notes in his possession.
  Now, what d&rsquo;you make of it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did all those letters come today?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, they didn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ve only got to look at the
  postmarks to tell that! The point is, they&rsquo;re here. We lost five
  thousand, and, counting what the police in New York have captured, we get
  twenty thousand back. That won&rsquo;t do, of course; all this money here
  belongs to somebody else; our money seems to be in New York; and as I&rsquo;m
  going there on tonight&rsquo;s train, I will attend to that end of it myself.
  You must see to this end.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your suggestions are very helpful today, aren&rsquo;t they? In the
  first place, all those letters were registered; that ought to afford some
  clue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. The post-office people aren&rsquo;t allowed
  to give any information.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know that. But aren&rsquo;t there ways and means?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not that I know of.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, get hold of Newman, then;
  he&rsquo;s the receiving- teller that is responsible for the missing bills.
  Find Out what he knows about it. I&rsquo;ve suspected that man ever since the
  money was first missing, but there was no proof to go on; so I said nothing.
  But get him up here again and give him a regular grilling, and find out what
  he knows; I haven&rsquo;t time to see to it myself. I&rsquo;ve several other
  more important things to attend to, and after that I&rsquo;ve got to go home
  and settle up some business there before I catch the train; so I must hurry.
  Now, have you got that? Is there anything else I can tell you? Very well,
  then. Wire me in New York if anything turns up, and I&rsquo;ll wire you if I
  get any news from that end. Between the two of us, we ought to be able to
  throw some light on the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"><small>CHAPTER VIII.</small> &mdash;<br>
  Which Enlightens Lizzie Wingfield And Certain Others</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LIZZIE WINGFIELD might be mournful and hopeless, but she
had to have some
  exercise. Even beautiful maidens whose last left belief is in the scoundrelly
  depravity of all humanity are apt to study their complexions; she studied
  hers in the mirror, and then concluded to go out for a walk. Besides, she
  wanted to meet the tailor-made lady again with the perambulator and tell her
  all about the burglar who had brought the money back.</p>

  <p>So she arrayed herself in the &ldquo;going away&rdquo; dress that formed
  part of her marriage trousseau and in the dream of a hat that she had bought
  for the wedding and might just as well take into use now that the wedding was
  &ldquo;off,&rdquo; and started down the stairs.</p>

  <p>And at the top of the front steps she stood still for a second to feel
  whether or not her hat was on straight; then she glanced once up the street
  to the left, and once down the street to the right, and nearly fainted. She
  would have surely fallen down the steps and broken her neck or twisted her
  ankle or something if Walter hadn&rsquo;t caught her.</p>

  <p>Yes, there was Walter, just that minute arrived from San
  Francisco&mdash;big, strong, broad-chested, gray-eyed&mdash;handsome as any
  man has a right to be, and neat as a bridegroom. He caught her in his big,
  strong arms, and so saved the situation and the story. He didn&rsquo;t kiss
  her, though. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been proper to do it out there in the
  street, and, besides, he wasn&rsquo;t quite sure yet how he stood. He kept
  his arm round her, though, in case she should happen to fall again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Walter!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How could you! You a
  thief? And to think that I loved you and trusted you! Go away! I never want
  to see you again! I sent you a telegram saying that everything was over
  between us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Walter grimly; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why I came! I
  can&rsquo;t see any reason for calling the engagement off just because the
  money was stolen. I&rsquo;m just as fond of you, and I don&rsquo;t see how
  you could have helped it. Besides, why call me a thief? I didn&rsquo;t steal
  the money!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, but Walter, you did! You said so in your letter!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did I? I&rsquo;d like to see the letter! I must have been
  dr&mdash;I mean I think you must have read it wrong!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Her eyes lit up like jewels, lighted from behind by the
  joy that was new- born in her. &ldquo;You mean that, Walter? You
  mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean exactly what I say, and you&rsquo;re a little goose! Come,
  let&rsquo;s go sit somewhere where it&rsquo;s quiet, and I&rsquo;ll tell you
  all about it and we can compare notes. But tell me first, is the engagement
  still off?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her answer was inaudible, but its purport must have been absolutely clear
  to him, for he took her in his arms and kissed her right there and then in
  the street, to the awful disgust of two elderly ladies who were passing and
  the horrid envy of a patrolman. But patrolmen don&rsquo;t count, anyhow. Then
  they walked into the park, having nowhere else to go, and sat down on one of
  the benches.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be awfully
  awkward now that we haven&rsquo;t got that money; but I must ask for my job
  back again, and you&rsquo;ll have to come with me to Frisco and try to make
  both ends meet on my pay. Say, though! I&rsquo;d give something to lay my
  hands on that burglar!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The burglar wasn&rsquo;t a bad man at all he brought me the money
  back again!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wha-a-a-at?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact, Walter!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve got it after all?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, indeed I haven&rsquo;t. You see, Walter, I thought&mdash;I
  thought you&rsquo;d stolen it; so when the burglar gave it back to me I put
  it in an envelope and posted it straight to the president of the trust
  company, with a little note inside asking him to forgive the
  thief.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo; Walter Bavin didn&rsquo;t finish the
  sentence. He just stretched his legs out in front of him and threw his head
  back, and laughed for about five minutes without stopping.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look here, little woman,&rdquo; he said when he had got his breath
  back again, &ldquo;listen, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it. That money
  of mine was out on mortgage. I&rsquo;d lent it to a fellow named Newman on
  the security of his house. Newman is receiving teller, and I was paying
  teller in the same office. Newman had to repay me the loan by a certain date,
  but he hadn?t arranged for a new mortgage to replace the old one, and he
  hadn&rsquo;t the cash; so he stole it from the safe, meaning, of course, to
  pay the whole lot back before anybody found it out. I didn&rsquo;t know about
  it at the time naturally; but I discovered it almost directly after I&rsquo;d
  sent you the money, and as luck would have it the general manager missed the
  money from the safe on the same day.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Newman&rsquo;s a life-long friend of mine, and I
  wouldn&rsquo;t give him away for worlds; but in common honesty, if I
  didn&rsquo;t give him away, and especially seeing that I had had the money,
  I&rsquo;d got to take the loss on my own shoulders&mdash;I mean it was up to
  me to repay the bank or else expose Newman. Then I got your letter saying
  that the money was stolen, so I couldn&rsquo;t get it back from you. But
  I&rsquo;d got to do something pretty quickly, so I went to my uncle in Los
  Angeles and told him I needed five thousand dollars at once. I wouldn&rsquo;t
  tell him why, but I suppose he knew I wouldn&rsquo;t have come to him unless
  I&rsquo;d simply got to have it; at all events, he gave me five thousand
  dollars in bills, and I put them in a registered envelope and arranged for
  another fellow to post them to the bank from Los Angeles. I did it, of
  course, to save Newman; but it seems the bank&rsquo;s been paid back twice
  over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you tell that horrid man Newman what you&rsquo;d
  done?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, no. I didn&rsquo;t get the chance. When I returned from Los
  Angeles he was away from the office on some business or other; and before he
  came back I got your telegram saying that it was all over between us, so I
  caught the next train to find out why.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what can you do about it, Walter?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dunno, I&rsquo;m sure. I&rsquo;ve got a few hundred dollars with
  me&mdash;enough for a week&rsquo;s hotel bill and our two fares to Frisco. I
  vote we get married first and talk about ways and means afterward.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And they did, too, that very day, and went and stayed at the Kickerdocker
  Hotel, and she wore the hat and dress at her wedding after all! What do you
  know about that?</p>

  <p>She tried to persuade him to stay somewhere that was a little bit less
  expensive, but Walter wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. Walter was wise. He thought
  he would be more likely to meet people there who were worth meeting, and so
  he did. He met the president of the San Francisco, Los Angeles and Sacramento
  Trust Company.</p>

  <p>The president walked in one fine morning and began opening letters and
  telegrams in the foyer, and Walter, who was loafing in the foyer, walked
  straight up to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad to see you, sir!&rdquo; said Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; said the president.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want my job back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh. Well, I&rsquo;ll talk to you about that in half a minute. Wait
  while I open this telegram.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The president tore it open with his thumb and scowled over it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thought so!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;That accounts for one of
  them! Read that!&rdquo; he ordered, handing the telegram to Bavin, &ldquo;and
  tell me what you know about it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The message was from Brown in San Francisco, and it ran:</p>

  <p>Newman has confessed to taking money. Also claims that registered envelope
  bearing San Francisco postmark and containing five thousand is his. Has post-
  office receipt to prove it. Have suspended him pending receipt of your
  instructions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; snapped the president. &ldquo;No beating about the
  bush! Come up to my room and tell me every word you know about it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So Walter Bavin told him, omitting no single detail.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And d&rsquo;you mean to tell me that you actually borrowed money
  and sent it to the firm anonymously rather than expose your friend or see the
  firm robbed?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the lady you&rsquo;ve since married did the same thing, eh?
  Sent the money straight back because she thought you&rsquo;d stolen
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to meet her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d be delighted, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So Mrs. Bavin was produced, and blushed becomingly, and told her version
  of the story, while the president leaned back in his chair and wondered if
  the days of miracles had come again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you want your job back again?&rdquo; he asked, turning to Bavin.
  &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t support a wife properly on the salary
  you&rsquo;ve been getting. If you&rsquo;ll catch the next train back
  I&rsquo;ll slate you for a thousand a year increase, and I&rsquo;ll send a
  wire on ahead confirming it. I like a man who can be loyal to the firm and
  his friends at the same time. That settles that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And about Newman, sir? I don&rsquo;t think he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deal with Newman when I get back!&rdquo; snapped the
  president. &ldquo;And now. Mrs. Bavin, would you mind telling me about that
  burglar all over again from the beginning?&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"><small>CHAPTER IX.</small> &mdash;<br>
  Which Is Short, And Treats Of Ikey</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IKEY was out on bail; his wife had managed that. His
address was quite
  well known to the police, and the president of the San Francisco, Los
  Angeles, and Sacramento Trust Company, being a very important person with a
  pull, had no difficulty whatever in obtaining it.</p>

  <p>He refused to say why he wanted it, and he refused for the time being to
  commit himself with reference to the hundred-dollar bills that had been found
  on Ikey&rsquo;s person. He had grown rich by holding his tongue on suitable
  occasions, and like Ikey, it took more than a policeman to make him talk when
  he didn&rsquo;t want to.</p>

  <p>Ikey was sitting one afternoon in the front parlor, looking very forlorn
  indeed, with his head between his hands and his elbows resting on his knees -
  not at all like the same Ikey of the race-course or the Ikey who had paid the
  money back.</p>

  <p>He looked like a querulous and half-drowned Ikey, and Mrs. Ikey sat in the
  next chair and tried to comfort him.</p>

  <p>?It&rsquo;s all very fine you talkin&rsquo;, missus,&rdquo; said Ikey;
  &ldquo;but what you say&rsquo;s rot! There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; to it! The
  minute a guy like me tries to act white he gets pinched, an&rsquo; there
  y&rsquo; are! Look at me! Have I been took once before since me an&rsquo; you
  got spliced? No. An&rsquo; have I been livin&rsquo; on the square all that
  time? Not so&rsquo;s you&rsquo;d notice it, I haven&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;ve took
  what I wanted, an&rsquo; kep&rsquo; it, an&rsquo; held my tongue. Any harm
  come of it? Not as I can remember! Then I goes an&rsquo; listens you,
  an&rsquo; tries to act white, an&rsquo; gives back five thousand wads
  o&rsquo; good gov&rsquo;ment coin what I&rsquo;d took, an&rsquo; up comes a
  cop an&rsquo; pinches me! There&rsquo;s a lesson for yer!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Ikey dear!&rdquo; said his better half. &ldquo;You did
  it to please me, and because you couldn&rsquo;t be mean, and I know good will
  come of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet it will!&rdquo; said Ikey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a nice
  long rest up the river! That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;ll come of it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A ring came at the bell, and Mrs. Ikey rose to answer the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be one o&rsquo; them sheriff&rsquo;s deputys,&rdquo;
  said Ikey, hopefully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be come to tell me my bail&rsquo;s
  been raised an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve got to go to jug till I can get a new
  bondsman. You see if it ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But it was not the sheriff&rsquo;s deputy. It was the president of the San
  Francisco, Los Angeles, and Sacramento Trust Company.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what can I do for you?&rdquo; asked Ikey, with just a hint of
  venom in his voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to see what I can do for you!&rdquo; said the
  president, laughing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re talking!&rdquo; said Ikey. Fetch the gentleman a
  cigar, missus&mdash;no, not those, the good ones&mdash;that&rsquo;s right.
  Take a seat, mister, an&rsquo; go ahead&mdash;I&rsquo;m
  listenin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the president, coughing a little awkwardly,
  &ldquo;I understand that you&rsquo;re in trouble&mdash;under arrest&mdash;out
  on bail&mdash;that right?&rdquo; Ikey nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I happen to know the lady whose money
  you&mdash;er&mdash;took, and to whom you returned it; she told me all about
  it. There&rsquo;s one thing I don&rsquo;t quite follow yet, though. Why
  didn&rsquo;t you give her back the same bills? Why bills of different
  denominations? Had you by any chance as much as ten thousand dollars in your
  possession?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at first I hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Ikey. &ldquo;It come about
  this way. I gave the lady a sportin&rsquo; chance. I played the five thousand
  all on one horse at Aqueduct races, an&rsquo; the horse won at even money;
  I&rsquo;d got ten then, hadn&rsquo;t I? Well, I gave the lady back her five,
  seein&rsquo; as I&rsquo;d had good luck myself, an&rsquo; I kep&rsquo; the
  hundred dollar bills partly because they&rsquo;d brought me luck, an&rsquo;
  partly because they was easier to get rid of. There y&rsquo; are!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; laughed the president. &ldquo;Well,
  I&rsquo;ve known worse crooks than you - a lot worse! Now my proposal to you
  is this. I&rsquo;ve got a crook in my office who also stole money and who
  also paid it back, and I&rsquo;ve decided to give him another chance; but it
  wouldn&rsquo;t be exactly ethical to do that and let you go to jail, would
  it? So I&rsquo;m going to offer you another chance, too. There&rsquo;s a sum
  of five thousand dollars going begging at the present moment; the police have
  got it, but it doesn&rsquo;t actually belong to anybody; my firm has been
  repaid the money that was stolen, so I can&rsquo;t claim it, but I&rsquo;m
  the only person who can dispose of it all the same. Now I&rsquo;ll sign an
  order releasing that money to you on one condition&mdash;that you give me
  your word of honor you&rsquo;ll go straight from now on. You won the money on
  the race-course, and though the stake wasn&rsquo;t yours to begin with, still
  you have more claim on the proceeds of the bet than anybody else I can think
  of; and I&rsquo;m assuming that you have a sense of honor simply because you
  wouldn&rsquo;t have paid the lady back her five thousand otherwise. At all
  events, I prefer to look at it in that light. Now, do you accept my terms?
  Yes or no?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; burst in Mrs. Ikey, on her knees between Ikey and
  the president. &ldquo;You leave him to me, sir, and I&rsquo;ll make him
  promise! Go away, sir, now, and leave him to me! I&rsquo;ll answer for it.
  The answer&rsquo;s yes! yes!! yes!!!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Did Ikey promise? He did. And did he keep it? I can&rsquo;t tell you, for
  he&rsquo;s a secretive little cuss, is Ikey.</p>

  <p>But he took the five thousand dollars sure enough and sold up the flat in
  Eighty-First Street, and shortly afterward disappeared along with Mrs. Ikey
  and little Ikey with the tooth, and nobody in New York has ever seen them
  since.</p>

  <p>But there is a man over in Los Angeles who very much resembles Ikey. He
  says his name is Cole&mdash;Isaac Cole. He has a wife who is copper-haired
  and tailor- made, and one son; and he also has a nose that is pliable and
  restless and immense. But this Mr. Isaac Cole is a reputable merchant.</p>

  <p>His ways of doing business are well known throughout the whole of
  California, and though they say you must get up very early in the morning if
  you want to catch him napping, they all admit that his methods are at least
  legal; and some say he is absolutely honest.</p>

  <p>He smokes no cigarettes and never goes to a race meeting, and he may
  possibly be the same Ikey. But, on the other hand, he may not; and there is
  no possible means of finding out.</p>
