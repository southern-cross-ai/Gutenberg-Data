<p>Production Notes:<br>
<br>
This work is the third edition, extending beyond the Federation
of Australian States. In a book of this format, the paragraph
headlines have been omitted, particularly in the light of the
index occupying almost 20% of the book.<br>
<br>
A few changes have been made to modernise punctuation. In the
original, about half of the 4-digit numbers, apart from dates,
have the comma separator and half do not; here they all have the
separator. The single illustration has been added to the Contents
page. Both accompanying maps are unobtainable.</p>

<h3>GENERAL PREFACE.</h3>
<br>
<p><i>The aim of this series is to sketch the history of Modern
Europe, with that of its chief colonies and conquests, from about
the end of the fifteenth century down to the present time. In one
or two cases the story commences at an earlier date: in the case
of the colonies it generally begins later. The histories of the
different countries are described, as a rule, separately; for it
is believed that, except in epochs like that of the French
Revolution and Napoleon I, the connection of events will thus be
better understood and the continuity of historical development
more clearly displayed.</i></p>
<p><i>The series is intended for the use of all persons anxious
to understand the nature of existing political conditions. "The
roots of the present lie deep in the past"; and the real
significance of contemporary events cannot be grasped unless the
historical causes which have led to them are known. The plan
adopted makes it possible to treat the history of the last four
centuries in considerable detail, and to embody the most
important results op modern research. It is hoped therefore that
the series will be useful not only to beginners but to students
who have already acquired some general knowledge of European
History. For those who wish to carry their studies further, the
bibliography appended to each volume will act as a guide to
original sources of information and works more detailed and
authoritative.</i></p>
<p><i>Considerable attention is paid to political geography, and
each volume is furnished with such maps and plans as may be
requisite for the illustration of the text.</i></p>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<br>
<p>No sane person would attempt to write a complete history of
Australasia in three hundred pages. Having, therefore, to make a
selection, I have fallen back upon the traditions of that school
which regards history as past politics, and politics as present
history. Even with this limitation, I have had to go lightly over
the ground, omitting much that even I know, and, doubtless, much
more of which I am ignorant. I can boast no special qualification
for the task, save that I have spent three years in Australia,
living as an Australian amongst Australians; but I have not
spared to search the best sources of information.</p>
<p>Prominent amongst these are the Parliamentary Papers, which
contain, for those who know how to use them, materials for not
one but many histories of the nineteenth century. And here let me
express a word of thanks to the Corporation of the City of
Liverpool, which is conferring a priceless boon on all students
of modern history within its dominions, by keeping in accessible
condition, and under the charge of a most courteous librarian, a
complete set of these invaluable records. No private library,
scarcely any college library, can afford the space for such a
treasure. It needs the magnificence of civic hospitality. The
Journals of the Royal Geographical Society have been my authority
for the chapter on internal exploration; many of the accounts
which they contain are written by the explorers themselves. For
the early voyages which resulted in the discovery of the coast
line of Australasia, I have used the contemporary histories. All
these authorities have been supplemented by personal research
amongst the Government archives at Sydney, Melbourne, and
Wellington.</p>
<p>But it has been my good fortune also to benefit by help from
other sources. To my repeated enquiries upon points of colonial
history the Agents-General of the respective colonies have
returned most courteous and ready replies, and they have laid me
under frequent obligation by the loan of valuable documents.
Similar help has come from the Foreign Office and the Colonial
Office, rendered always with a promptness which has doubled its
value. My colleague Professor Gonner, who has himself made a
special study of Australian questions, has most kindly read my
proof-sheets, and made many valuable suggestions by which I have
benefited. If it be not presumptuous for a contributor to refer
in print to his editor, I would also acknowledge the great
advantage I have derived from the friendly criticism and
watchfulness of Dr Prothero, who has saved me from the
consequences of many a slip, while his general approval has
inspired me with a confidence which, standing alone, I should
have hardly felt.</p>
<p>Finally, I have to thank Miss M. J. Leather, of University
College, Liverpool, for the full and careful index which, even in
its condensed form, constitutes not the least valuable part of
this book.</p>

<h3>NOTE TO SECOND EDITION.</h3>
<p>The following pages are practically a reprint of the first
edition. The author's efforts have on this occasion been confined
to the correction of clerical errors, one or two of which were
discovered by his critics in the Press, and to the addition of
the latest available statistics.</p>

<h3>PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>IN</small> preparing the new edition for the Press, the
author has been mainly concerned to give some account of the
successful realization of the movement towards federation in
Australia, the earlier history of which was sketched in the
former editions. In this task he has been chiefly guided by the
standard work of his friend and successor Professor Harrison
Moore, entitled <i>The Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Australia.</i></p>
<p>But he has also attempted to give a brief account of some of
the more important of the many interesting experiments in
politics and social organization which have been made by
Australasian statesmen in recent years; and here he has been
specially indebted to the valuable work entitled <i>State
Experiments in Australia and New Zealand</i>, by the Hon. W.
Pember Reeves, himself closely associated with the active
reforming government of the late Mr Seddon in New Zealand, to
which so many of these experiments were due. For details and
statistics, he has relied chiefly on the very full and careful
<i>Official Year Book of the Commonwealth of Australia</i>,
annually compiled by Mr G. H. Knibbs, Official Statistician of
the Commonwealth, which is a mine of accurate information.</p>
<p>These printed sources have been freely supplemented by
information promptly and courteously supplied, in answer to
enquiries, by the High Commissioners for the Commonwealth and the
Dominion of New Zealand, and by the Agents-General of the various
Australian States, to whom, and to their obliging officials, he
begs herewith to tender his very sincere thanks for their
kindness. He desires also to acknowledge his indebtedness for a
revised estimate of the administration of Colonel Gawler, in
South Australia, to a thesis containing the results of original
research among the Colonial Office papers, prepared by Mr R. J.
Rudall, B.Litt, Rhodes Scholar, of Christchurch, Oxford, which he
trusts will soon appear in print.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br>
<br>
<small>DISCOVERIES IN THE SOUTH SEAS.</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> first duty of an author who attempts to
write a history of the Australasian colonies for English readers
is to point out a possible misapprehension which would render his
work unintelligible. The terms "Australia" and "Australasia" are
often used by speakers and writers as though the one were only a
more elaborate and dignified equivalent of the other. As a matter
of fact Australia is, geographically, a part of Australasia.
Australia is the name appropriated to the huge island continent,
at one time known as "New Holland", which lies in the Pacific
Ocean due south of Papua or New Guinea, and south-east of China.
Sometimes the name "Australia" includes, and sometimes it does
not include, the lesser island of Tasmania (formerly known as Van
Diemen's Land), which itself lies due south of the south-eastern
coast of Australia, separated from it only by some 120 miles of
shallow strait. There seems no adequate reason why Australia, as
a geographical expression, should not include Tasmania, just as
Europe includes England; and, as brevity of expression is a
desirable object, Australia shall in these pages include
Tasmania, except where express mention is made of the
distinction. Politically speaking, this practice seems equally
harmless. Australia, even in the narrower sense, is not a single
state under one government; it comprises five distinct and
separately governed colonies&mdash;New South Wales, Victoria,
South Australia, Western Australia, and Queensland; and the
addition of the colony of Tasmania, so closely allied with these
in history and character, will create no difficulty.</p>
<p>Incidentally we have here come upon another pitfall of
language. "South Australia", to any one at all familiar with
Australian matters, means exclusively the colony of that name,
with a clearly defined though extensive territory. By the less
well-informed, it is apt to be taken for a mere indefinite
geographical expression. No doubt there is some excuse for this
mistake, inasmuch as the great bulk of the colonial population is
settled towards the southern and south-eastern shores of the
continent of Australia. But it would be disastrous to allow such
a use of the term to slip into a history of the Australasian
colonies.</p>
<p>"Australasia", on the other hand, though an equally uncertain
term, is never, except by the ignorant, used as an equivalent to
"Australia". In its widest application, Australasia includes
Australia, the three islands known together as "New Zealand", and
the almost countless islands of the Pacific ocean, from Sumatra
and Borneo to the extreme east of the Polynesian group. This use
of the term has the high authority of Mr Alfred Russel Wallace,
the eminent explorer and man of science; but, however convenient
to the naturalist, it cannot be adopted by the historian. For
there is no historical connection between many of the groups
composing this enormous area, and any attempt to treat them as a
political whole would be doomed to certain failure. But within
this area, though often separated from each other by vast
distances, there is a group of communities whose histories are
linked together by two important facts allegiance to the British
crown, and prevalence of British blood, manners, ideas, and
hopes. This group consists of Australia (including Tasmania) and
the islands of New Zealand; and to this group we propose in these
pages to confine the term "Australasia". One or two other
dependencies of the British crown there are&mdash;such as Fiji
and New Guinea&mdash;which have some claims to be considered
members of the British Australasian group; but they are
distinguished from the Australasian <i>colonies</i> by the great
fact that the bulk of their population is not of European race.
It will be better, therefore, to exclude them from the main
current of our story, and only to refer to them incidentally
towards its close. For the history of the Australasian colonies
is pre-eminently the history of a European race in a non-European
land.</p>
<p>The early days of Australasia are a striking illustration of
the assertion, so often made, and with apparent truth, that the
Englishman discovers nothing and invents nothing, but that he
possesses a marvellous knack of adopting and developing the
discoveries and inventions of others. In the great maritime
discoveries of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, England
plays a very small part. Such original discoveries as she can
claim were made after the great lines of maritime enterprise had
been laid by other nations, and, even then, were often made by
foreigners in the English service. But, when once the existence
of lands hitherto unknown had been established, no perils, no
threats could keep the English from swooping down upon the prize.
The Spaniard or the Frenchman descried land, examined it hastily,
set up his country's flag as claim of title, and sailed away. The
Englishman went to stay. And so it has come about that of the
countries discovered by Gama and Columbus, by Torres and Tasman
and Carrier, (no one of them an Englishman or in English pay,)
the great bulk has ultimately fallen to the British race.</p>
<p>It is impossible to say with certainty who it was that first
discovered to Europeans the continent of Australia. When the
great awakening of thought which took place in the fifteenth
century had stirred up men's minds to put to practical use the
new discoveries in science, it was natural that all eyes should
be turned towards those rich Eastern lands which scholars knew
from the histories of Alexander the Great, and which the
multitude had heard of from the merchants who came at intervals
along the old caravan routes to the great fairs of Europe. India
and Cathay (China) were the names with which the adventurers
buoyed up their own hopes, and charmed the money for supplies out
of the pockets of princes and courtiers.</p>
<p>Two well defined and distinct lines of approach were
attempted, almost simultaneously, in the hope of reaching by sea
the riches of the Orient. The Portuguese, cautiously feeling
their way down the west coast of Africa, rounded the Cape in
1497, and reached Calicut at the beginning of the next year.
Following up their successes, they pushed further and further
east till they reached the spice islands of the Malay
archipelago, and, before the middle of the sixteenth century,
obtained almost a monopoly of that valuable spice trade, which
had long been the most remunerative branch of foreign commerce.
Meanwhile, the Spaniards, urged by the great Columbus, had
adopted the really brilliant idea that the East might be reached
by deliberately starting out in the opposite direction, and
trusting to the new scientific conclusion that the world was a
sphere and not a plane. It is this daring acceptance of
scientific conclusion, while yet unverified by experience, which
shews the real greatness of the character of Columbus. As we
know, he set out to find India, and, on his way, discovered
America. His successors were engaged for some years in exploring
the new continent which he had brought to light, still believing
that it formed a part of the long desired India. At length the
truth dawned on them, but the discovery of the Pacific by Vasco
Nunez de Balboa only stimulated them to still further effort.
They pushed on and on, until the visit of Magelhaens to the
Philippine Islands in 1521 brought the Spaniards well past the
easternmost stations of the Portuguese, and completed the circle
of the globe.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to believe that, in her wanderings in
the Malay archipelago, no Spanish or Portuuese ship sighted the
mainland of Australia. The northern coast of Australia is at one
place distant less than 100 miles from the southern coast of New
Guinea, and in those days it was no uncommon thing for a vessel
to be blown 100 miles out of her course, especially when sailing
in little-known waters. It is not difficult, therefore, to
understand how, in the early years of the sixteenth century,
rumours began to float about Europe of a great southern land,
which had slept unknown since the beginning of the world in the
untraversed ocean. These rumours began to take hold of men's
minds, and to appear in visible, though highly imaginative
shapes, on the rude charts of geographers and travellers. One of
the oldest of these is to be found in the British Museum, and is
attributed to the year 1542. It is believed to have been at one
time the property of a man named Rotz, a French sailor who passed
some part of his life in England; and this fact gives some colour
to the claim put forward by the French, that their countryman,
Guillaume le Testu, was the true discoverer of Australia. The
claim is based mainly upon the fact that Testu's name appears on
a map dated 1555, on which a southern continent, styled <i>Jave
la Grande</i> ("Great Java"), is outlined. But this fact, of
course, merely proves that Testu had heard of such a country, and
guessed whereabouts to look for it. The outline is certainly not
sufficiently correct to convince us that he had personally
explored the coast.</p>
<p>Far more striking proof of the knowledge of Australia which
gained ground during the later sixteenth century is afforded by a
work published in 1598 by the Dutch historian Cornelius Wytfliet.
One passage is sufficiently interesting to bear reproduction.</p>
<p>"The <i>Terra Australis</i> is the most southern of all lands,
and is separated from New Guinea by a narrow strait.... The
<i>Terra Australis</i> begins at one or two degrees from the
Equator, and is ascertained by some to be of so great an extent,
that if it were thoroughly explored it would be regarded as a
fifth part of the world."</p>
<p>Here we have not only the position of the country stated with
some approach to accuracy, but a shrewd guess at the vastness of
the still unexplored regions. The continent, too, has always kept
the simple name given to it by the earliest writers; it is
<i>Australia</i> the South Land, and nothing can better describe
it. The more ambitious name of Australasia (South Land of Asia),
invented by the French writer Brosses in the middle of the
eighteenth century, has been productive of much confusion, and
has now, as we have seen, more than one meaning.</p>
<p>The credit of converting the legendary belief of the later
sixteenth century into verified fact belongs, undoubtedly, to
Spain. In the year 1595 Alvaro de Mendana, a Spaniard of birth
and influence, set sail from Peru, ostensibly to settle the
Salomon Islands, but with secret hopes of discovering the
much-talked-of continent. Mendana died without having
accomplished anything more than a temporary settlement on the
Santa Cruz group; but his pilot, Pedro Fernandez de Quiros,
devoted himself to the fulfilment of his captain's object, and,
in the year 1605, started from Lima, under the most favourable
auspices, to refound Mendana's abandoned settlement at Santa
Cruz, and then to search for the Great South Land. Quiros
discovered many islands, probably, from the accounts of his
followers, belonging to the Samoan group, and ultimately reached
the group now known as the New Hebrides, to one of which he gave
the name of <i>Austral del Espiritu Santo</i>, a fact which
indicates pretty clearly the nature of his hopes. Quiros, no
doubt, thought that he had accomplished his object, and, in
pursuance of his orders, started northward, with part only of his
expedition, for Santa Cruz. The accounts of his proceedings
thenceforward are not satisfactory. Perhaps he thought that he
had done all that was hoped of him, perhaps his men mutinied, but
in any case it is probable that he did not even reach Santa Cruz.
Meeting with bad weather, he consulted his officers, giving them
the choice between New Spain and China. They unanimously decided
for the former, and thus missed their best chance of making the
great discovery.</p>
<p>But Quiros' lieutenant, Luis Vaez de Torres, who had been left
behind at Espiritu Santo, was more enterprising and more
fortunate. Sailing along its western coast, he saw enough to
convince him that the so-called Australia was only one of the
many islands of the Pacific, and not the great continent of which
Quiros was in search. After making a bold dash south-westward,
which must have brought him to a point between New Caledonia and
the eastern coast of Australia, Torres stood back to the
north-west, with the object of making the south-eastern point of
New Guinea, probably hoping ultimately to reach China by way of
the Philippine Islands. He succeeded in making New Guinea, but,
in spite of his efforts, he tailed to weather the eastern point,
and was compelled to coast along the southern shore. This
disappointment really gives Torres his title to fame; for it
seems beyond question that, in passing through the narrow strait
which now bears his name, he more than once sighted the northern
shores of Australia. Though, by his own account, he was more
interested in annexing little islands on the Guinea coast than in
exploring towards the south, the currents and shallows compelled
him often to stand in a southerly direction; and he expressly
says that he reached the end of the nth degree of latitude, where
the water became shallow. Thus he must have been well within the
outline of the continent.</p>
<p>The business of exploration was soon afterwards taken up by
the Dutch, who, having successfully conducted a heroic war of
independence against Spain, and established a national Republic,
were rapidly becoming one of the great sea powers. There is
indeed a tradition that in the very year (1606) in which Torres
made his famous voyage, the northern coasts of Australia were
sighted by the Dutch ship <i>Duyphen</i>, which sailed from
Bantam to New Guinea, and is said to have gone as far as
13&frac14; degrees of latitude South. In the year 1616 a Dutch
ship named <i>Eendracht</i>, under the command of Theodoric
Hertoge or, as he is generally called, Dirk Hartog, accidentally
fell in with the west coast of Australia, at a point now known as
Shark Bay. Several other voyages followed, which resulted in a
gradually increasing knowledge of the continent. Carstenz, a
Dutch explorer, named the Gulf of Carpentaria in the north in
1623, after the Dutch governor of the West Indies. Dutch
expeditions in 1628 gave the name of the great De Witt to the
western coast. But the turning point in the history of Australian
maritime exploration is the famous voyage made by Abel Jansz
Tasman in the year 1642.</p>
<p>The expedition was sent out by the Governor and Council of the
Dutch East Indies from their headquarters at Batavia, the
colonial capital of Holland. It consisted only of two vessels, a
yacht and a fly-boat. After spending some time at Mauritius, the
expedition steered south and east, and, on the 24th November,
1642, discovered land which, in his modesty, Tasman called Van
Diemen's Land, after the Governor of the Indies, but which the
justice of posterity has named, after its discoverer, Tasmania.
After exploring the east coast for some distance, and naming
Storm Bay and Frederick Henry's Bay, Tasman again sailed east
and, on the 13th December, 1642, sighted the middle island of New
Zealand. Here, on the west coast, he met the determined
opposition of the natives, who killed several of his men at a
place which he named Murderers' Bay. Bearing north, Tasman
discovered the Three Kings' Islands, and rounded the North Cape.
To the territory thus discovered he gave the name of Staates
Land, thus claiming it on behalf of the Republic of Holland; but
his Government afterwards changed the title to New Zealand, a
name which it has ever since borne. Tasman continued his voyage
eastward, and discovered the Friendly Islands, as well as several
smaller places; but these do not concern us. He returned to
Batavia round the north coast of New Guinea, and reached port on
the 16th June 1643, having in eight months added a new chapter to
the world's history.</p>
<p>Two years later, Tasman undertook a second voyage of
discovery. Of the history of this expedition little is known; but
it is interesting from the fact that the instructions given by
his Government to the great sailor are still in existence. From
these we gather that Torres' discovery of the strait which bears
his name was unknown to the Dutch in 1644, for one of Tasman's
chief duties in the new expedition was to discover whether or no
New Guinea and the South Land were parts of the same continent.
He was also directed to examine the east coast of Australia, and
to report whether Van Diemen's land likewise formed part of the
continent. Apparently he did not succeed in the task. At any rate
Tasman had been dead a hundred years before it was ascertained
that Tasmania was an island.</p>
<p>By the middle of the 17th century Australasia had thus
acquired a thoroughly Dutch character. In the great stone map of
the world which Quellius made in the year 1662 for the Town Hall
of Amsterdam, the names New Holland (Australia) and New Zealand
shew the view taken of the new world by the Dutch; and it was, in
fact, long before the declining strength of Holland compelled the
States to abandon their claims. But at last England appeared on
the scene.</p>
<p>The character of the first English explorer in Australian
waters cannot be considered creditable to his nation. William
Dampier was one of the large body of amateur pirates (to put it
plainly) whom the increasing familiarity of Englishmen with
hitherto unknown waters produced in the 16th and 17th centuries.
Without being essentially cruel or lawless, he adopted the
popular view that morality and law-abidingness were shore virtues
only, and, though there is no evidence that he committed outrages
for the mere pleasure of the occupation, he certainly let nothing
stand in the way of a prospect of plunder. His greatest virtue
was unquestionably a steady thirst for knowledge of all kinds
connected with navigation, or, as he himself puts it, "increase
of experience".</p>
<p>Dampier's first visit to Australia took place in January 1689,
and was a sort of offshoot from a piratical cruise on the coasts
of the Dutch possessions in the East Indies, which occupied him
for seven or eight years. His own account of his adventures
(discreetly worded) was published in 1697, and though the account
which it gives of New Holland is anything but attractive, the
success of the book seems to have stirred up in the public mind a
desire for further discovery. It is noteworthy that, even at the
very end of the 17th century, some of the most elementary facts
concerning Australia were yet unknown. Dampier says: "<i>New
Holland</i> is a very large Tract of Land. It is not yet
determined whether it is an Island or a main Continent; but I am
certain that it joyns neither to <i>Asia, Africa</i>, nor
<i>America</i>."</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year 1699, Dampier set out from
England in command of the <i>Roebuck</i>, an Admiralty vessel, on
a voyage of discovery in the South Seas. Instead of taking the
usual western route by America, he sailed round the Cape of Good
Hope, and reached Australia in August, at the point previously
touched by Dirk Hartog, but which he now renamed "Shark Bay".
Finding, however, little to reward his efforts, after two months'
desultory exploration of the western coast, he sailed north to
the Dutch Indies. For this conduct he apologizes in a later work,
pleading the mutinous character of his crew; but it is clear that
the hope of plunder (of which Australia afforded very little
encouragement) drew him to tropical quarters. Dampier, however,
published an interesting account of the plants and animals of New
Holland, which probably excited some attention. He probably also
helped to generate the legend of a still more southern land, of
which Australia was to prove but an outlying island, a legend
which had a considerable influence on his great successor, Cook,
and even upon much more modern explorers.</p>
<p>For more than half a century after Dampier's voyages, the
spirit of discovery seems to have slept. The next great name in
English annals is that of James Cook; and his long exertions
practically completed the adventurous task of ascertaining the
real character of Australasia. Later explorers had many details
to fill in, and many dangers to encounter; but when Cook died the
fifth great division of the world was no longer an Unknown
Land.</p>
<p>Cook's first experience of southern exploration was in 1768,
when he set out, as lieutenant in command of H.M.S.
<i>Endeavour</i>, with a party of men of science, to observe from
Tahiti the approaching transit of Venus. The main object of the
voyage was accomplished by the beginning of June 1769, but the
great geographical work was still to be done. The voyage to
Tahiti had been by the old western route of the Spaniards, not by
the bolder track chosen by Dampier. But the party determined to
return home by the Pacific route; and it is this homeward journey
which has given Cook his title to fame. Pushing westwards from
Tahiti (or Otaheite&mdash;formerly known as King George III's
Island), and touching at several smaller places, the expedition
reached New Zealand in August 1769, exploring Poverty Bay on the
east coast of the north island. Working still northwards, it
explored and named the Thames River, and, rounding the North
Cape, sailed along the western coast until it reached Queen
Charlotte Sound, one of the many beautiful inlets which pierce
the north eastern shoulder of the middle island. Here Cook
discovered, much to his surprise, that a shallow and turbulent
channel (now known as Cook Strait) separated into two islands
what he had before believed to be one. Sailing through this
channel, he reached his old quarters in Poverty Bay; and then,
turning south, he completely circumnavigated the middle island,
until he once more came up to Queen Charlotte Sound. Thus the
general outline of New Zealand was put beyond dispute; and if
Tasman may claim the credit of the discovery, Cook is entitled to
be considered as the real explorer of the colony.</p>
<p>But further success awaited the expedition. Sailing westward
in March 1770, Cook soon reached the east coast of Australia, and
commenced an exploration of the shores which was productive of
important results. He reached Botany Bay just at the beginning of
the beautiful Australian autumn, when the country was recovering
under heavy showers from the long heat of summer. It is to this
fact that we owe the picturesque name of Botany Bay, which so
long, in the minds of Englishmen, stood for the whole of the
Australian colonies. For several months the party continued to
explore the coast line in a northerly direction, encountering
grave dangers in following the line of the Great Barrier Reef,
which extends for hundreds of miles along the coast, and leaving
traces of their passage in such names as Cape Tribulation (where
they were nearly wrecked), Endeavour River, and Possession
Island. Passing through Torres Strait, they finally settled the
fact of the separation of New Guinea from Australia; and Cook
then formally claimed possession, in the name of the British
Crown, of the country behind the coast line he had explored,
giving to it the name of New South Wales, which it retains to the
present day.</p>
<p>A second voyage, undertaken by Cook in the year 1772, in the
ships <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Adventure</i>, is not of great
importance in Australasian history. The ships soon became
separated, and though both, at different times, visited New
Zealand, the main energy of Captain Cook (as he had now become)
was directed towards the search for the still more southern or
Antarctic land, the notion of which had been set afloat by
Dampier. His voyage is, however, of importance in the general
history of discovery, for it proved, pretty conclusively, that,
if such a land existed at all, it was so far south as to be
practically useless for purposes of trade or settlement. And it
is for ever memorable as shewing, that, by the use of proper
precautions, the longest voyages, even in extreme climates, may
be undertaken with practical immunity from disease. Cook himself
on this voyage lost only one man through sickness, though he was
away from England upwards of three years, and experienced all
extremes of climate.</p>
<p>In the year 1776, Cook started on his third and last voyage;
but this time with the chief object of discovering a north-west
passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. On his outward
journey, however, he visited Tasmania and New Zealand; and,
though he did not spend very much time in exploring those
countries, the experts who accompanied him added considerably to
the existing knowledge of botany and zoology. After calling at
Hawaii, Cook sailed northward, in the spring of 1778, to explore
the American coast, and, though he did not get further north than
the shores of Alaska, he made some useful observations upon the
country in the neighbourhood of Bering Strait and Nootka Sound,
and perhaps incidentally started an important trade in furs
between Alaska and China. Returning for the winter of 1778-9 to
Hawaii, Cook was, as every one knows, murdered by the natives in
Karakara Bay, on the 14th February 1779.</p>
<p>At the death of Captain Cook, Australasia may be said to have
been practically explored, so far as the coast line was
concerned. Only one maritime discovery of first rate importance
remained to be made, viz. the existence of a channel between
Tasmania and the mainland. This discovery was made by Surgeon
Bass in 1798, and the strait which he surveyed still bears his
name. The later voyages of the <i>Investigator</i> and the
<i>Beagle</i> are famous for their services to navigation and
science generally; but Mr Bass's discovery may be said to have
completed the coast map of Australasia.</p>
<p>Turning now from discovery and exploration to settlement, we
may pause for a moment to form some general idea of the nature of
the countries which have become the scene of a new civilization.
And here we must be careful to distinguish between Australia and
the rest of Australasia&mdash;i.e., practically, New Zealand.</p>
<p>From a physical point of view, the appearance of Australia is
disappointing to any one familiar with the variety of scenery to
be found in Great Britain and Ireland. Here and there, in the
settled parts of the country, are mountainous districts, covered
with luxurious vegetation, and watered by beautiful streams. But
the general aspect of the temperate parts of the continent is one
of mild undulation or absolute flatness, covered with somewhat
monotonous vegetation, or (in the summer months) bare and
parched; while there is neither the artificial beauty of high
cultivation nor the natural beauty of primitive wildness. Except
in the tropical north, there are practically no navigable rivers
on the mainland; even the Murray and the Darling are apt to
become impassable in the summer. The scarcity of water is,
indeed, one of the most disastrous natural features of Australia;
and, unless artificial means can be used to correct it, vast
tracts of country must for ever remain unsettled. Tasmania,
however, is a country of noble rivers and striking scenery,
though the painful monotony of Australian forest or "bush" is to
be met with there also.</p>
<p>On the other hand the climate, in the temperate regions, is,
perhaps, one of the finest in the world. Except in the
mountainous districts there is no severe cold, frost and snow
being unknown; and, though in the summer the temperature rises
very high, the air is, as a rule, so dry, that neither lassitude
nor other ill effects follow, and cases of sunstroke are
extremely rare. A man may be prostrated by a temperature of
80&deg; Fahr. in London, and yet feel quite brisk in experiencing
100&deg; in Melbourne. The soil too, in spite of the scarcity of
water, is in many parts exceedingly fertile, both for pasture and
agriculture; and these conditions of climate and soil must be
regarded as important factors in the history of the colonies.</p>
<p>It is, however, in its productive aspect, that Australia
occupies such an unique position. Though possessing native fauna
and flora of great extent and variety, it is almost barren 01
native products in any way useful for the prime necessities of
life. The native animals and birds are curious rather than
valuable. With few exceptions, they can be used neither for food
nor service. The same remark applies to the native vegetable
life. The universal gum tree is now becoming famous for its
sanitary qualities; but early colonists cannot live on medicine,
and the gum forests of Australia furnished but little timber for
building houses and making furniture, nor did her uncultivated
plains yield edible roots or grain. On the other hand, the soil
of Australia has shewn a remarkable capacity for fostering and
developing imported animal and plant life. The consequence has
been that the economic side of Australian life has been almost
purely European. It is simply a reproduction of British economy,
slightly modified to suit new conditions.</p>
<p>This feature has been intensified by the absence of
competition. The aborigines of Australia (the word "native" is
now always reserved for those of European descent) have had no
influence on Australian history. Absolutely barbarous and
unskilled in the arts of life, dragging out, according to the
accounts of all travellers, a wretched and precarious existence
even before the arrival of European settlers, they could offer no
resistance to the invaders, and they have, in fact, been entirely
ignored (except as objects of charity or aversion) in the
settlement of the country. Probably always few in numbers, they
are now, at the highest estimate, considerably less than one
hundred thousand. In Tasmania they have entirely disappeared; and
though in the barren interior of the mainland they may prolong
their existence for generations, there seems to be no hope that
they will improve their lot. Most of the colonies have passed
laws intended to protect them from personal cruelty and fraud;
but these laws serve only still more to separate them from
civilized life. The one pursuit in which they have hitherto been
regarded as useful is that of tracking criminals or missing
travellers; but white settlers in the "bush" are rapidly becoming
more expert than the aborigines in such matters, and the "black
trackers" are falling into discredit.</p>
<p>New Zealand, on the other hand, presents a very different
picture. Perhaps no country in the world contains so much
inspiring scenery in so small a compass. From the semi-tropical
north, with its hot lakes and luxurious vegetation, to the
vigorous south, with its glaciers and snow-fed streams, there is
a constant succession of beautiful and varied landscapes. The
terrible monotony of the Australian gum forest is unknown. There
are no dried up river beds or parched plains; everything is
green, fresh, and prolific. It is not an invalid's country,
except in the north, where a valetudinarian may revel in a
temperature which hardly varies a dozen degrees the whole year
round. But for the average man the climate is unsurpassed. There
are no extremes of heat, such as those which scorch the
Australian plains and, except in the far south and the mountain
districts, no severe winters. Everywhere there are refreshing
winds and abundant rainfall, the fertile soil responds to the
lightest effort of labour, the great extent of seaboard and the
splendid rivers afford abundant means of travel, and the
Englishman planted down in New Zealand finds himself in a country
which reproduces all the good natural conditions of his old home,
without some of its less pleasing features. The east wind of
England, the fog and smoke of English towns, have no
representatives in New Zealand. Though it is quite possible that
the timber of Australia may ultimately prove very valuable, at
present the New Zealand kauri pine and the beautiful tiger wood
are better known than the Australian timbers, and are actually
imported into Australia in large quantities. Some of the finest
buildings of Australia are built of New Zealand stone. The coasts
of New Zealand swarm with fish; and, although the indigenous
fauna are few and not very valuable, the great ease with which
European animals and birds have been acclimatized has already
rendered New Zealand a land of plenty.</p>
<p>The coloured inhabitants of the colony are, moreover, a very
different race from the miserable blacks of Australia.
"Aborigines" they can hardly be called; for it is the generally
received opinion that the forefathers of the Maoris colonized New
Zealand from one or more of the islands of the Samoan group; and,
though it is quite possible that they intermarried with an
aboriginal, or at least an earlier stock, the peculiar vigour and
fine physique of the Maori race are characteristics rarely to be
found in peoples which have for ages lived in isolation. The fate
of Captain Furneaux' party in Murderers' Bay was ominous of the
attitude likely to be taken up by the Maori towards the white
colonists. As a matter of fact the early European settlers in New
Zealand had to reckon with the warlike Maori in a way unknown to
the colonists of Australia. The Maoris were anything but savages.
Although their knowledge of the arts of peaceful life was limited
when New Zealand colonization began, they knew something of
agriculture, navigation, house-building, wood-carving, and other
pursuits. Above all, they were adepts in the art of war, which
their men considered as the real business of existence, and
pursued with a zest and skill which made them formidable enemies.
At the same time they possessed chivalrous and generous
qualities, which occasionally manifested themselves in startling
ways.</p>
<p>On the whole, it was quite impossible to treat the Maoris as
the colonists of Australia treated the aborigines&mdash;with
contemptuous neglect. The Maori could not be overlooked; and the
treaty of Waitangi and the wars of the sixties are landmarks in
New Zealand history. Though the Maori has failed to harmonize
with and take part in the European civilization which has grown
up around him, though he may be doomed to extinction at some
distant period, yet he is still to some extent in possession of
the land of his fathers, and he has left his mark on the
institutions of New Zealand, no less than on the character of the
New Zealand colonist.</p>
<p>It is perhaps difficult to make an English reader understand
the essential difference between Australia proper and New
Zealand, and indeed, it may well be possible to exaggerate it.
But to one familiar by personal contact with the two countries,
the difference is unmistakeable. Perhaps it consists mainly in
the fact that the developement of New Zealand has been at a
slower rate than that of Australia, though on much the same
lines. But even this difference is a factor of vast importance,
for a different rate of developement produces a different
character of developement. We shall not attempt then, in these
pages, to tell the story of New Zealand along with that of
Australia, at least until we come to deal with those modern
aspects of history in which they are essentially alike.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br>
<br>
<small>THE FOUNDING OF NEW SOUTH WALES.</small></h3>
<p><small>IT</small> is universally known that the actual history
of Australia, as a European settlement, dates from the landing of
Captain Phillip at Botany Bay on the 18th January 1788. It is
equally well known that the bulk of Captain Phillip's expedition
consisted of men and women who, under the barbarous criminal law
of the time, had been sentenced to transportation for various
periods (in most cases of seven years) for offences of greater or
less magnitude. The conclusion is drawn from this latter fact
that Australia was, at the first, and was intended to be, nothing
more than a penal settlement, a mere means of ridding England of
undesirable individuals. And it is assumed that the subsequent
developement of the colony of New South Wales into a prosperous
free community was a happy accident. This is a profound
mistake.</p>
<p>It will easily be understood that the famous voyage of Cook
and Banks had created a considerable sensation. Exploration was a
fashionable pursuit, both in England and elsewhere, at the close
of the eighteenth century. George III himself was a munificent
patron of scientific research, and loyal subjects could do no
less than imitate his example. Cook, originally of humble
position, rose deservedly to honour and dignity; Banks became
President of the Royal Society, and was knighted. The glowing
description of Botany Bay which he had given was not forgotten;
and people somewhat hastily assumed that a spot so prolific in
flowers must prove a kind of Eden to the happy settler.</p>
<p>While the minds of men were in this condition, there occurred
one of the most disastrous losses which the fortunes of England
have ever suffered. Just at the time when Cook and his companions
were doing their great work in the South Seas, a series of
unparalleled blunders and follies on the part of English
statesmen had driven the English colonies in America into an
unnatural war with the mother country. After generations of
neglect and indifference, England was beginning to grow very
proud of her children beyond the sea; and, though the high spirit
of the nation at first backed George III and his Ministers in
their obstinate determination to deny these children the
privileges of manhood, yet, when the facts became known, public
opinion, instructed by the great Lord Chatham, rose slowly
against the follies of the Government. When a disastrous war
terminated in the final loss of the American colonies (a loss
formally admitted by England in 1782), public feeling, apparently
more sensitive than the Government upon the subject of national
honour, cast about for a plan by which the losses of the war
might be repaired. While the Parliament, in 1781, abolished the
office of Secretary of State for the Colonies, and even swept
away the Council of Trade and Plantations, thereby signifying its
belief that the colonial career of England had closed, the
popular mind, as represented by men of science and philanthropy,
saw in the discoveries of Cook and Banks an opportunity for
recovering lost ground.</p>
<p>But, with Europe barely resting from the convulsions of a
continental war, with the eyes of all the Sea Powers bent on
maritime conquest abroad, it would have been childish folly to
make any attempt to settle a private colony in Australia. The
settlement would simply have been snapped up by the war-ships of
some European power, or made the scene of buccaneering
enterprise. This the advocates of colonization very well knew;
and they realized, therefore, that the first object of their
efforts should be to overcome the supineness of Government on the
question.</p>
<p>They might have waited long enough, until indeed the French
Revolution had filled the minds of English statesmen to the
exclusion of everything else, but for one lucky accident. The
loss of the American colonies had incidentally put the Government
to a great deal of inconvenience on one point. Even before the
outbreak of the Civil War, the eagerness of the American
colonists to obtain a supply of labour upon any terms had induced
the Crown to give convicted prisoners the informal option of
escaping a severe, possibly a capital sentence, by consenting to
banishment to America. At first this practice was purely
voluntary; there was no legal power to transport a convict if he
preferred to be hanged. But when the circumstances of the Civil
War had brought England into closer touch with her colonies, it
was resolved to give Parliamentary sanction to a practice which
had proved, on the whole, beneficial. Accordingly, a statute of
the year 1666 authorized the transportation of "lewd, disorderly,
and lawless persons", convicted of theft in the counties of
Northumberland and Cumberland, to any of His Majesty's
possessions in America, not to return upon pain of death.
Apparently the Act worked well, for in the year 1670 the
permission was extended to include all persons convicted of the
capital offences of nocturnal arson and maiming of cattle; though
in such cases the clause against return was limited to seven
years, and the prisoner could not be transported at all without
his consent.</p>
<p>The system was gradually extended by Act of Parliament to
other offences, until, at the time of the Declaration of
Independence, the annual export of prisoners had reached an
average of nearly 500, most of whom went to the southern colonies
of America. The process was exceedingly welcome to the
Government; for the value of prisoners had increased so
satisfactorily that, instead of being obliged to be at heavy
charges for their maintenance in England, the Secretary of State
found contractors perfectly willing to take the convicts off his
hands, without subsidy, or even allowance for expenses. The value
of a "common male convict" in the colonial market was about
&pound;10; of women &pound;8 or &pound;9. Trained artificers
fetched more than twice as much. Of course the transported
convict did not find himself a free man when he landed in
America. He was "assigned" to his purchaser, and practically
remained in slavery till he could purchase his freedom. The
social side of the system will be found discussed, with that
author's usual vividness of imagination, in the works of Defoe.
One serious drawback to its success, from the humane point of
view, was that about one seventh of the convicts died, either in
prison or on board ship, before reaching the shores of
America.</p>
<p>The loss of the American colonies, then, came as a severe blow
to this system. The Government now frankly admitted that "the
transportation to the American colonies was attended with much
difficulty"; and Mr Duncan Campbell, the chief transportation
agent, in his evidence before the Commons Committee of 1779,
stated that the revolt of the colonies had practically put an end
to the trade. At the same time, the exertions of the
philanthropist John Howard had called public attention to the
evils of the prison system, and rendered it impossible for the
old scandals of the Fleet and the Marshalsea to continue. The
"hulks", or river-ships in which the worst prisoners were
confined, were equally unpopular. The Government was brought face
to face with a problem of great difficulty.</p>
<p>The result of the enquiry undertaken by the House of Commons
in 1779 was an Act of Parliament passed in the year 1783, which
authorized the King in Council to fix places, either within or
without the British dominions, to which offenders might be
transported. In the course of its enquiry the Committee had
received suggestions from various witnesses as to suitable places
for the future reception of convicts. The suggestions were only
three; one that convicts should be sent to labour on the
fortifications of Gibraltar (a plan which the Committee did not
seriously entertain), a second that one of the British
settlements on the Gambier river should be chosen, and the third,
made by Sir Joseph (then Mr) Banks, that an attempt should be
made to colonize Botany Bay. The evidence against the Gambier
scheme was overwhelming. The mortality amongst the free European
settlers on the west coast of Africa was so startling, that the
Committee shrank aghast from the proposal. Even its advocates
admitted that "on their first arrival the climate would probably
be fatal to numbers," and one in six was suggested by experts as
the probable mortality. So that it appeared, as it has been well
put, that the Gambier scheme was merely a means for "the
execution of capital punishment by malaria."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the statute of 1783, which received the royal
assent on the 30th June, did not in any way indicate Australia as
a place of transportation; and it was left once more for private
enterprise to move in the matter of Australian colonization. In
August of the same year Mr Matra, afterwards well known as
British consul at Tangiers, presented a memorial to the
Government, urging the importance of effecting a settlement in
New South Wales. As this memorial (still preserved in the
Colonial Office) is virtually the germ of Australian settlement,
it is worth while to notice that it contains no reference
whatever to the question of transportation. Inasmuch as Mr Matra
was evidently anxious to urge every argument in favour of the
scheme, this fact seems to make it clear that the idea of an
Australian penal settlement had not yet taken hold of men's
minds. The only political suggestion in the memorial is that the
proposed settlement will afford an asylum to the unfortunate
American loyalists, whose devotion to the mother-country has left
them in a painful position. The other arguments are purely
economic. They dwell largely upon the commercial advantages to be
derived from settlement in New South Wales, and suggest that
"with good management and a few settlers, in twenty or thirty
years they might cause a revolution in the whole system of
European commerce, and secure to England a monopoly of some part
of it and a very large share in the whole." The memorial
recommends, in fact, as the basis of settlement, the rather rare
material of "marines accustomed to husbandry".</p>
<p>The suggestion of a convict establishment came from the
Government. In a conversation between Lord Sydney and Mr Matra on
the 6th April 1784, the former hinted at the matter, and Matra,
with all the eagerness of an enthusiast who grasps at every
argument which seems to help his plan, at once fell in with the
suggestion. That he regarded it, however, as but a subsidiary
part of the scheme, is clear from the pains which he took to
induce free settlers to join the expedition.</p>
<p>But with the Government the case was different. The prospect
of getting rid of convicts was here evidently the motive power,
and, though the Attorney-General also suggested political
considerations with respect to the navigation of the China seas,
it is evident that the Government plan was one of a convict
settlement. In fact the Government adopted such a scheme, drawn
up by Sir George Young. Yet it is worth noticing that, even in
the official instructions given to Captain Phillip, the latter is
directed at once to send home particulars of the new country in
view of probable free emigration. The situation then is clear. A
convict settlement formed no part of the scheme of the earliest
advocates of settlement in New South Wales. Its inclusion was the
price they paid for Government assistance, without which it would
have been impossible to stir.</p>
<p>The negotiations dragged on, as Government matters were apt to
do in those times, and it was not till the close of the year 1786
that Orders in Council definitely fixed upon the eastern coast of
New Holland as a place to which convicts might be transported
under the Act of 1783. By that time, however, preparations for an
expedition were in full swing; and early in the following year
its members began to assemble.</p>
<p>A word should be given to the man who had the good fortune to
lead an expedition which resulted in the planting of a new
continent. The choice of the Government fell upon Arthur Phillip,
the son of the widow of a naval captain, who had married a German
settled in London as a teacher of languages. Mrs Phillip's first
husband, Captain Herbert, is said to have been related to the
powerful family of the Earls of Pembroke. During her first
husband's life Mrs Phillip would have made friends in naval
circles, and it is not, therefore, surprising to find that, at
the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, in the year 1755, Arthur
Phillip, then sixteen years of age, took service in a man-of-war.
The times were favourable for a gallant spirit. The previous wars
of the century had made promotion easy, and there was no lack of
opportunities for distinction in the present. Phillip was present
at the capture of Havannah by Lord Albemarle in 1762, being
already of lieutenant's rank; and he is generally supposed to
have secured something considerable out of the plunder of the
city. At any rate, on the cessation of hostilities in the
following year, he, then just of the age of twenty-five, was able
to marry and settle down as a country gentleman at Lyndhurst in
the New Forest.</p>
<p>But peace eventually palled upon his ardent spirit, and,
finding no need of his services in his own country, Phillip
volunteered to serve Portugal in her colonial quarrel with Spain.
England had already shown her goodwill towards Portugal at the
close of the Seven Years' War; it was natural, therefore, that an
English officer should feel drawn to her flag. Equally natural
was it that Spain and France, anxious to humiliate their ancient
enemy, should seize the opportunity of the American rebellion to
join the colonists against the mother-country, a movement which
at once involved England in naval war on a large scale.</p>
<p>This turn of events brought Phillip back to England in hot
haste, and he was immediately gazetted to the command of a
fireship, a step which was followed in the year 1781 by his
promotion to the rank of post-captain, with command of the
frigate <i>Ariadne</i>. He served with distinction throughout the
war, and, at the conclusion of the peace of Versailles in 1783,
returned once more to a repose which appears to have been always
uncongenial to him, and from which he was again summoned by the
commission to take charge of the expedition to Botany Bay. It
will be noticed that, hitherto, Captain Phillip, though he had
given abundant proof of warlike capacity, had shown no evidence
of ability to direct peaceful undertakings. But it was probably
necessary to choose between a warrior and a statesman; and the
Government preferred the former.</p>
<p>The expedition, as finally arranged, consisted of two
men-of-war (the frigate <i>Sirius</i>, which carried Phillip
himself, and the tender <i>Supply</i>, under Lieutenant Ball),
six transports carrying about 750 convicts (550 men and 200
women),* and three store ships. The fleet also carried a
detachment of marines, 208 in all, who were principally
distributed amongst the transports, as guards over the prisoners,
besides 40 free women (wives of the marines) and, presumably, the
usual complement of crews. Taken altogether, there cannot well
have been less than 1,100 souls engaged in the expedition about as
many as are now carried by one first-class Australian liner
during a busy voyage. On the 13th May 1787 Captain Phillip, as
Commodore of the squadron, gave orders to weigh anchor, and the
first emigrants started for Australia.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The numbers of the convicts are variously
stated by the authorities.]</p>
<p>The route taken was by the Canaries and Santa Cruz, across the
Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro (for the sake of avoiding the calms of
the African coast), and from Rio to the Cape of Good Hope. Soon
after leaving the latter port, the squadron broke into two parts;
Captain Phillip in the <i>Supply</i>, accompanied by the
transports <i>Alexander</i>, <i>Scarborough</i>, and
<i>Friendship</i>, going on ahead, and Captain Hunter, in the
<i>Sirius</i>, taking command of the rest of the convoy. On the
18th January 1788 the <i>Supply</i> reached Botany Bay, followed
during the next two days by the rest of the fleet.</p>
<p>It was evident at once to Captain (or, as we must now call
him, Governor) Phillip's practical eye, that, however excellent a
hunting ground for scientific explorers, Botany Bay was no
suitable site for a colony. Not only did the harbour afford no
proper protection to vessels; but the supply of fresh water was
inadequate, and the ground soft and marshy. So, obeying the
letter of his instructions, which forbade him to delay landing
his men in the hopes of finding a better harbour than Botany Bay,
the Governor gave orders for the preparation of a site for
landing, but himself at once set out in an open rowing boat to
discover a better harbour elsewhere. His hopes were bent upon
Port Jackson, another inlet on the coast, about three leagues to
the north of Botany Bay, mentioned by Captain Cook in his account
of his voyage. This he speedily discovered, and the eyes of the
party were gladdened by the sight of a magnificent harbour, now
the pride and delight of the citizens of Sydney. Though wide at
the mouth and of vast extent, the port is broken up by
innumerable headlands which jut out from its shores, into as many
smaller coves or inlets, each of which is practically a harbour
within a harbour. The height of the banks, and the abundant
growth of the trees which lined them, afforded complete
protection from the wind, from whatever quarter it came, and the
chief difficulty of the Governor and his officers was to select
from so many candidates for favour the actual site of the
intended settlement. After various attempts, the choice
ultimately fell on an inlet which possessed an abundant supply of
fresh water, and was further distinguished by banks so steep that
even the largest ships of the expedition could moor right under
the shore. In honour of the Secretary of State this inlet was
named "Sydney Cove". Returning to Botany Bay only two days after
he had left it, the Governor found his predictions of its
unsuitability amply verified by experience. All the reports which
reached him from actual explorers were unfavourable; and he no
longer hesitated to give the word for the removal of the
settlement. This was on the 24th of January 1788, less than a
week after the <i>Sirius</i> had sailed into Botany Bay. Now
occurs one of the most startling incidents in Australian
history.</p>
<p>As the expedition was making preparations for departure on the
24th January, its members were astonished to see in the offing
two ships carrying French colours. Governor Phillip at once
bethought him of rumours which had existed, of an expedition sent
out before his own from France. His suspicions proved correct.
The French commander, M. de la Pérouse, had been despatched from
France in the year 1785 on a voyage of discovery, had coasted
round both shores of South America, had sailed north as far as
Nootka Sound, and then, following Cook's track in his last
voyage, had struck south by the Sandwich and Friendly Islands to
Australia. The Frenchmen, though they hovered about the coast for
several days, made no effort to interfere with Governor Phillip's
proceedings&mdash;in fact, friendly relations were entered into
between the two parties; and it is, of course, quite possible
that no permanent consequences were intended to follow, in the
way of French colonization. On the other hand, it is quite clear
that, until the arrival of Governor Phillip's expedition, Great
Britain had no title whatever to Australia. The formal claim made
by Cook, not being followed by actual occupation, could give no
better right than the earlier discoveries of Spain and Holland;
and, until the actual taking of possession by Governor Phillip,
the French had as good a right as any one to settle. It is
seizure, not discovery, which gives a title by the Law of
Nations; and there is, therefore, some justification for the
saying that England won Australia by six days.</p>
<p>Warned by the appearance of possible rivals, the expedition
made all haste to Port Jackson, where a landing was speedily
effected, and, on the 26th January 1788, formal possession was
taken of Sydney Cove, although the proclamation of the Colony and
the reading of the Governor's Commission did not take place until
the 7th February. During the whole of the long voyage the
expedition had lost less than forty lives; a very small number if
the circumstances be taken into account. Soon after the landing,
however, dysentery and scurvy broke out, and, until natural
remedies were discovered, the health of the colony suffered
severely.</p>
<p>The commission of Governor Phillip defined the territory of
New South Wales as including the whole eastern coast of Australia
(as it was then believed to be) from Cape York (Torres Strait) in
the north to South Cape (the southernmost point of Tasmania) in
the south, with an inland or western boundary of the 135th degree
of longitude E. The colony was also to comprise all the adjacent
islands of the Pacific Ocean within the same degrees of latitude
as the mainland. These dimensions, if literally construed, would
have included not only the present colonies of New South Wales,
Queensland, Victoria, and Tasmania, with a good slice of South
Australia, but also the bulk of New Zealand, the whole of the New
Hebrides, Fiji, Samoan, Friendly, and Society groups, as well as
Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island, and other isolated spots. Of
course no serious attempt to defend such an enormous territory
could have been within the deliberate projects of the Ministry of
the day; but no doubt it was thought well to open the mouth as
wide as possible. There are always plenty of people willing to
believe that because they desire a thing they are in some
mysterious way entitled to it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in order to show that the sovereignty of the
Pacific Islands was not to be a mere empty boast, one of Governor
Phillip's first formal acts was to despatch Lieutenant Gidley
King, with a small party of marines and convicts, to take
possession of Norfolk Island, favourable accounts of which had
been brought home by Cook, and upon which M. de la P&eacute;rouse
had also reported. The expedition under Lieutenant King, which
left Port Jackson on the 14th February 1788 in the tender
<i>Supply</i>, duly arrived at its destination, and in the
following month the ship returned to Port Jackson, with glowing
accounts of the new settlement. The soil was apparently fertile,
there was water in abundance, fish and fowl were to be caught in
numbers on the shores and in the forests, the pine with which the
island was covered was no mere rubbish demanding labour to clear
away, but a valuable store of timber, and the flax plant grew
wild, affording opportunity for the immediate establishment of a
profitable industry. On the return voyage the commander of the
<i>Supply</i> explored and named Lord Howe Island.</p>
<p>So good was the news that, in October 1788, a fresh detachment
of marines and convicts was sent to Norfolk Island, and a colony
definitely established under the rule of Lieutenant King, as a
subordinate of the Governor of New South Wales. The subsequent
history of the little community has been romantic and
interesting; but it can be disposed of in a few words. After
being used as a penal settlement until 1855 (with the exception
of twenty years at the beginning of the century), it was suddenly
cleared and prepared for the reception of the Pitcairn islanders.
These persons were the descendants of a handful of mutineers who
had set their captain (Bligh) and a score of men afloat in an
open boat in the Pacific in the year 1789. The mutineers,
doubtless believing that Bligh would never again be heard of,
made their way to the tiny Pitcairn Island, and there, after a
few stormy years, ultimately settled down into a condition which
is usually described as idyllic. It is to be feared that this
stage was reached by a rather severe process of struggle, which
resulted in the undisputed survival of the strongest; but the
notoriously imperious character of Bligh (who, curiously enough,
was afterwards Governor of New South Wales), and the fact that
the mutineers, instead of murdering their commander, merely set
him afloat, whereby, after a marvellous voyage, he ultimately
escaped with his life, go a long way to palliate the undeniable
fact of mutiny. For a long time the fate of the mutineers was
unsuspected; but in the year 1814 the community on Pitcairn
Island was accidentally discovered. It was too late to think of
punishment when, in fact, most of the original mutineers were
dead; and the Pitcairners remained an object of increasing
curiosity till the year 1856, when, having grown beyond the
resources of their little territory, they were removed to the
newly vacated Norfolk Island. Many of them, however, returned to
their old home, which their descendants still inhabit. At the
present day the population of Norfolk Island numbers about 750,
that of Pitcairn Island 120, and that of Lord Howe Island about
50. Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands are under the jurisdiction of
the Governor of New South Wales. Pitcairn Island was placed under
the control of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific in
1898. The clearing of Norfolk Island in 1806 has left its trace
in the name of New Norfolk in Tasmania, a beautiful township on
the river Derwent, to which the convicts were then removed. (See
p. 75.)</p>
<p>Under the wise rule of Governor Phillip, things prospered with
the settlement at Port Jackson. At first, indeed, serious
difficulties arose with regard to provisions, the Home Government
having somewhat too hastily assumed that the colony would in a
short time prove self-supporting. There was so much preliminary
work to be done in the way of erecting houses for the Governor
and his staff, barracks for the marines, and hospitals for the
sick, and the denseness of the forest which covered the shores of
the port was so great, that it was some time before any serious
attempts at agriculture could be made. The land was not ready for
autumn sowing, and when an attempt was made in the spring it was
found that the soil in the neighbourhood of Sydney was not
favourable to cereals. So that, although, according to the
official report of the Commissary, there were, on the 30th Sept.
1788, sufficient quantities of most of the necessaries of life to
last for a year, famine very soon began to stare the community in
the face. The transports had already been dismissed, and the
Governor sent the Government vessels one after another to the
Cape of Good Hope and to Norfolk Island for supplies; but the
ships met with bad luck, and only the unexpected arrival of
supplies from England saved the colony from grave disaster. In
other respects, matters were satisfactory. The health of the
settlers improved. After one or two striking examples had been
made, the convicts settled down tolerably well; and, on the
whole, the relations with the aborigines were good.</p>
<p>The arrival of fresh settlers, most of them convicts,
necessitated a further developement of the resources of the
colony. Fresh settlements were accordingly made at Parramatta, on
the river of that name, about fifteen miles due west of Sydney,
and in the neighbourhood of Richmond Hill, on the Hawkesbury
River, which runs into the sea at Broken Bay, about twenty miles
north of Port Jackson. On the banks of the Hawkesbury the
Governor found the rich wheat land which he had been seeking, and
the success of the crops, though endangered by the sudden floods
which are the bane of Australian rivers, ultimately put an end to
any fear of want of the necessaries of life. In the year 1790
large re-inforcements reached the colony, including a detachment
of a newly-raised regiment, the New South Wales Corps. By the
same ships instructions arrived for the free grant of lands on a
liberal scale to such of the marines and other freemen as were
willing to settle in the colony, especially to those who
volunteered for service in the new regiment. It had previously
been ordered that every convict, when his term of service
expired, should be entitled to a grant, varying from thirty acres
upwards, according to the circumstances of his family. A small
stock of sheep reached the colony and was carefully fostered by
the settlers. For a long time it was supposed that cattle could
not be reared, but in the year 1795 it was discovered that the
stragglers which had escaped into the bush had accomplished in a
state of nature what the efforts of their owners could not
accomplish, and the possibility of acclimatizing them was proved
beyond question. It was some time, however, before cattle-rearing
attained any success. In the year 1796 imported cows sold for as
much as &pound;84 a head.</p>
<p>During the remainder of Governor Phillip's term of office
there were few striking incidents. The accounts of that period
which we possess deal mainly with the attempts to establish
various industries of which the colony stood in need, the
variations of the seasons and crops, the visits of trading
vessels from India and the Cape, the behaviour of the settlers,
and the relations between the colony and the aborigines.
According to the official reports, the two last points did not
long continue satisfactory. Crimes of every kind were frequent,
and the conduct of the "emancipists", or those whose sentences
had expired, is described as being almost worse than that of the
actual convicts. In spite of the fact that the result of their
labour would now go into their own pockets, the emancipists were
lazy and dissolute, relying on the belief that the Government
would not allow them to starve, whatever their demerits. This was
especially the case at the Hawkesbury settlement, which really
afforded the best prospect of successful agriculture, but the
distance of which from headquarters prevented a thorough
supervision. Unfortunately, the number of free settlers who
arrived during Governor Phillip's reign was very small.
Unfortunately, too, some of the settlers discovered a method of
distilling spirits of an inferior but highly intoxicating
character from the wheat which they grew, and thus put it beyond
the power of the Government to regulate the supply of
intoxicants. Although a few of the younger men among the
aborigines acted as farm servants, and a few of their women and
children hung about the various settlements, it was quite clear
that any permanent union for industrial or social purposes
between the white and black races was out of the question. The
pages of contemporary annals are full of accounts of treacherous
attacks by the blacks, provoked no doubt, in most instances, by
ill-treatment, and of cruel reprisals made, sometimes by the
Government, but oftener by private and unlicensed authority. Of
the personal humanity of Governor Phillip there can be no doubt,
but circumstances were too strong for him.</p>
<p>At the close of the year 1792 Phillip resigned office and
returned to England. After an interval of nearly three years,
during which time the government of the colony was administered
by Captain Grose and Captain Paterson respectively, Captain
Hunter arrived as Governor (Sept. 1795). Captain Hunter had
sailed, along with Governor Phillip, in the <i>Sirius</i>, on the
original expedition of 1787; and, though he had not remained very
long on the occasion of his first visit, he was probably better
acquainted than a total stranger would have been, with the
requirements of the colony.</p>
<p>Under Governor Hunter the fortunes of the colony rose
steadily. One year after his arrival the total live stock was
just over 5,000 head, and 5,400 acres of land had been cleared
for cultivation. Fifteen months later, at the close of the year
1797, the stock had risen to above 9,000 head, and, though there
appears to be no record of land cleared, there were nearly 5,000
acres under actual cultivation for grain, while in the previous
year much of the cleared land had been wasted. In August of 1798,
though the stock had only risen to about 10,000 head, the number
of acres in crop was upwards of 6,000. In another twelve months
the number of acres in crop had risen to nearly 8,000, though the
increase of stock in the year had again only been about 1,000
head. But these figures tell us very little unless we look at
them in relation to others. On the arrival of Governor Hunter the
total white population of New South Wales had been under 4,000.
At the close of his term of office, in the year 1800, according
to Mr Mossman (though his authority is not quoted), it had
increased to 6,000. We are probably safe in taking the latter
figure as a maximum for any period during Governor Hunter's term
of office, and we can thus arrive at a notion of the relationship
between the population and the means of subsistence; and this is
the true test of the material condition of a community. It will
be noticed that, supposing the increase of the population to have
been fairly steady, the number of acres in grain crop very nearly
equalled, at any given period, the number of inhabitants. As the
average yield of grain was at this time about 35 bushels to the
acre, and as the amount required to be set aside for seed was
about one bushel an acre, it is clear that, in average years, the
grain raised would average something over 30 bushels a head of
the whole population. As the average consumption of grain in
England at the same period was reckoned at not less than six
quarters per annum, it is probable that, even at the end of
Governor Hunter's reign, the colony could not feed its own
population, even so far as regards grain foods, on the same scale
as that adopted in England. And in flesh the deficiency was, of
course, far greater; it was long before salt meat ceased to be
the staple food of the colony, and the arrival of the store ships
to be awaited with anxiety. Yet the fact of progress was evident,
and the steady increase of sheep and cattle, as compared with the
inferior animals, such as goats and swine, showed that stock was
improving in quality as well as quantity.</p>
<p>The three most notable events of the period are the discovery
of coal, the expedition of Bass to Tasmania, and the explorations
to the north of the existing settlements.</p>
<p>In May 1797 a boat which had been fishing a short distance
south of Botany Bay was hailed by three strangers from the coast.
On being taken off, the strangers declared that they had started
from Bengal a few months before in a ship called the <i>Sydney
Cove</i>, with a speculative cargo for Port Jackson. Immediately
after rounding the South Cape (then believed to be part of the
mainland) the <i>Sydney Cove</i> had been driven on shore,
water-logged. Seventeen of the crew started thence in the ship's
long-boat, with a view of reaching Port Jackson. They were,
however, again wrecked, but this time, fortunately, on the
mainland, at a place called Point Hicks. From hence five started
to walk to Sydney. Two of them gave up in despair; but the
remaining three, a man named Clarke and two companions, pushed on
till they were seen by the fishermen. After reaching Sydney, Mr
Clarke stated that, two days before being rescued, he and his
companions had discovered a large outcrop of coal, so easily
workable that they had then and there gathered enough to make a
large fire, by which they had slept during the night. Such news
was not to be overlooked, and Mr Bass, the surgeon of the
Government vessel <i>Reliance</i>, an intrepid spirit,
immediately went off in a whale-boat in search of the treasure.
He soon discovered that Clarke had spoken truly, for about seven
leagues to the south of Point Solander, in the Illawarra
district, there was visible in the face of a steep cliff, wasted
by the sea, a stratum of coal, in width about six feet, and
extending eight or nine miles to the southward. The coal was
good, but its situation was so difficult of access, that, in the
existing state of affairs, it was felt that any attempt to work
it would be futile.</p>
<p>This disappointment was, however, speedily avenged; for in
September of the same year (1797) Lieutenant Shortland of the
<i>Reliance</i>, sent northwards in pursuit of some runaway
sailors who had stolen a boat, entered a hitherto unknown river,
about a hundred miles north of Port Jackson. The mouth of the
river afforded an excellent harbour for ships, but, in addition
to that, Shortland observed with satisfaction the existence of
coal in a position peculiarly easy for shipment. Naming the river
after the Governor, the discoverer returned to Sydney with all
speed, and reported his news. Steps were at once taken to utilize
the discovery, and the town of Newcastle, now so important in
Australian industry, was founded. Up till 1821 the coal mines
were worked entirely by convict labour. In 1826 they were handed
over to the Australian Agricultural Company upon a monopoly for
21 years. Since the expiry of the monopoly, the mines have been
worked on competitive principles, with the result that the output
has risen rapidly, till in 1892 it exceeded three million and a
quarter tons.</p>
<p>The expedition of Mr Bass, which led to the discovery of the
fact that Tasmania is an island, is one of the boldest
experiments on record.</p>
<p>Although the captain and the bulk of the remaining crew of the
<i>Sydney Cove</i> had been rescued immediately after their
existence had been made known by Mr Clarke, a few men had been
left to guard the wreck until the summer, when an attempt was to
be made to save some of the cargo. These men showed considerable
boldness in exploring the adjacent coasts, and a suspicion was
engendered in the minds of those who heard their accounts, that
the accepted ideas concerning Tasmania were unsound. Seizing the
opportunity of escape from enforced idleness, and, obtaining
permission to take an open boat, manned by volunteers from the
king's ships, Surgeon Bass embarked on a coasting voyage to the
south. Though the smallness of his vessel did not permit him at
once to attempt an investigation, he saw enough to convince him
that between New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania)
there existed a channel capable of admitting the full swell of
the Pacific from the west, and the same opinion was formed by
Lieutenant Flinders, also of the <i>Reliance</i>, who had
accompanied the <i>Francis</i> in her second voyage to the rescue
of the <i>Sydney Cove</i>. In August of the year 1798, Flinders
and Bass set off again together in a small decked boat, the
<i>Norfolk</i>. After thoroughly exploring Twofold Bay, at the
south-eastern extremity of the main land, the adventurers
proceeded southward, touching at many of the little islands which
lie about the northern and eastern coasts of Tasmania, and adding
to the list of known Australian animals the curious wombat. Then,
sailing due west, they explored the northern coast, entering Port
Dalrymple (formed by the outflow of the river Tamar), and finding
abundance of black swans, geese, and other birds. Keeping again
west, they sighted and named Table Cape and Circular Head, and
pressed on until the sight of shore trending away to the
south-east, and washed by the roll of great breakers, convinced
them that they had achieved the main object of their search, the
thorough proof that between Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales
there lay a complete and navigable channel. Following the western
coast of Tasmania, they reached South-West Cape, and finally
South Cape itself, when they were in comparatively well-known
waters. A gale carried them past the opening of Storm Bay, and
prevented the immediate entry of the Derwent river; but, working
back through Frederick Henry Bay, the intrepid adventurers sailed
up the Derwent, and at length succeeded in catching a
blackfellow, the first whom they had seen, though the smoke of
fires had often been visible. Finally, coasting along the eastern
shore, the expedition indulged in seal hunting in the
north-eastern islands, and at last reached home at Sydney, after
a complete circumnavigation of Tasmania. Additional interest
attaches to the voyage from the fact that the <i>Norfolk</i> was
an Australian built boat, having been constructed of Norfolk
Island pine. Her burden was only five-and-twenty tons, yet in
this little craft Flinders and Bass accomplished a five months'
voyage in unknown seas, where no supply of provisions or shelter
could be counted upon.</p>
<p>In the following year (1799) the little <i>Norfolk</i> again
sailed on a voyage of discovery. This time the direction was
northerly, and Lieutenant Flinders alone conducted the
expedition. Running along the shore, the vessel reached Cape
Moreton, as it had been named by Cook, who appears to have had no
suspicion that the point to which he gave the name was not part
of the mainland. Flinders, however, exploring the bay to the
north, found that the so-called Moreton Cape was an island at its
mouth. Entering upon a careful examination of the bay, he found a
river which, from the nature of its banks, he named "Pumice Stone
River". Here he saw a good deal of the aborigines, who appeared
of a somewhat higher type than those of Port Jackson, having
risen to the industrial level of fishermen. Flinders also
explored Hervey Bay and Curlew Island, and was able to report the
existence of turtle and whales along the coast. This expedition
may be said to have directly prepared the way for the settlement
of the Moreton Bay District, afterwards the nucleus of the colony
of Queensland; just as the expedition of the previous year
prepared the way for the colonization of Tasmania.</p>
<p>Governor Hunter's successor was a man of whom we have already
heard, like Hunter himself a member of the original expedition
under Captain Phillip in 1787, and therefore well acquainted with
the conditions of the colony. Philip Gidley King had been
lieutenant of the <i>Sirius</i> when Hunter was its captain; and he had
subsequently distinguished himself by his prudent and successful
government of the little settlement in Norfolk Island. He had by
this time been raised to the rank of Captain in the Royal Navy,
having gone home invalided from Norfolk Island in 1790. In the
following year, however, he had returned with a regular
commission as Lieutenant-Governor, and the magnificent allowance
of &pound;250 a year. On the retirement of Captain Hunter in the
year 1800, it was thought by the Home Government that King's long
experience of Australian affairs would make him a fit successor;
but they overlooked the obvious truth that officials and, for the
matter of that, private men, are often very unwilling to submit
to the rule of one whom they have long known in an inferior
position.</p>
<p>And indeed there happened to be one very difficult question
awaiting the immediate handling of the new Governor. It has been
mentioned before that the reckless and dissolute character of
many of the settlers made the demand for spirits of all kinds
exorbitant. The Government had all along striven to retain at
least the wholesale trade in its own hands, more on moral than
financial grounds, for the prices charged at the Government
stores were very moderate. But the cupidity of some of the
cleverer settlers had taught them a method of distilling inferior
spirits from wheat; and these they retailed at an enormous
profit. The Government had found great difficulty in putting down
this practice, which was a deliberate defiance of the revenue
laws. But a far more difficult problem now presented itself. The
New South Wales corps, which, as we have stated, had been raised
in England expressly for service in Australia, was officered by
men who were, in many cases, soldiers in little more than name.
With the prospect of a huge continental war in Europe, there was
plenty of scope there for the ambition of those who were soldiers
indeed. And so it happened that several commissions in the New
South Wales Corps had been given to men of no military
experience, who volunteered to serve mainly with a view of
utilizing the commercial advantages offered to the favoured
settlers and officials of the colony. On their arrival, they
found that one of the most profitable pursuits in which they
could engage was the trade in imported spirits. The Government
had already adopted a licensing system, and, so long as the
traders paid the revenue duties, and did not take advantage of
their position as officials of the colony to push their wares,
the enterprise was legitimate enough. But it seems to be proved
beyond all question that the temptation to abuse their positions
was too strong for at least some of the officers. As officials of
the colony, they had immense influence over the conduct even of
the emancipated settlers, and with the convicts they were, of
course, all powerful. If they used this influence in the
direction of the consumption of spirits, their efforts would meet
with but too ready a response from the inclinations of the
settlers, and one branch of the Government establishment would
become simply a machinery for debauching the colony.</p>
<p>It is to be feared that this really happened. At any rate the
Home Government thought so, for, in their instructions to
Governor King, they expressly ordered him to prohibit the landing
of any spirits at Port Jackson without his consent. This order
Governor King carried out, at least to some extent, causing very
large quantities of wine and spirits to be sent away from the
port, and insisting upon the sale of the rest in open market at a
moderate price. The monopolists were, of course, enraged at this
infraction of their privileges, and a feeling of discontent, all
the more dangerous that it existed amongst those who were
nominally supporters of the Government, grew up in the colony.
But King's personal influence seems to have prevented any
outbreak among the officials during his own time. His successor,
as we shall see, was less fortunate.</p>
<p>In the year 1804 occurred the only serious rising among the
convict population which the colony experienced. It is, in fact,
a most striking testimony to the truth that even anarchy requires
some degree of morals, that a mere handful of officials, with
very little military experience, and with no possibility of
succour from outside, should have been able to keep in check,
with apparent ease, a large number of men hostile to all forms of
government. It is terrible to think of what might have been the
consequences if the convicts had once got the upper hand; for
they would have been acting with halters round their necks, and
their first thought would have been to prevent the escape of a
single official. But the treachery and heartless cruelty shown by
the convicts towards one another seem to have rendered any
attempt at conspiracy in most cases futile.</p>
<p>In the attempt of 1804, however, there were new features. The
circumstances of Irish history during the closing years of the
18th century are well known, and the English Government found on
its hands a number of prisoners whom it deemed essential to
banish as far as possible from their native country. Many of
these persons were not criminals at all, in the ordinary
acceptation of the term, but political offenders, whose objects
and even actions would at the present time be looked upon with
leniency. In those days, however, the terror of the French
Revolution was upon England, and there was little thought of
mercy. From the year 1791, transports carrying Irish convicts
began to appear in Port Jackson, where it is to be feared they
met with a scanty welcome from the officials. Many of them, being
deemed "intractable", were put to work in chains upon the public
roads, and in the year 1804 a party of some 300 were employed at
Castle Hill, between Parramatta and Windsor. Watching their
opportunity, these men overpowered their guard, and, seizing its
weapons, marched in the direction of the Hawkesbury River, where
they expected to receive support from the settlers, whose
disaffection was notorious. In this, however, they were
disappointed, and, upon being charged by a handful of soldiers,
they laid down their arms. Eight of the ringleaders were
executed; the rest were pardoned.</p>
<p>But, though in other respects somewhat unfortunate, Governor
King's reign was distinguished by the developement of the capital
industry of New South Wales&mdash;wool-growing. Among the
officers of the New South Wales Corps was one John Macarthur,
who, though bred to the army, had shown a most remarkable
enterprise in agricultural experiment. He seems, however, to have
been convinced that the future of the colony lay in pastoral,
rather than agricultural pursuits, and, having fortunately
obtained from the Cape in 1797 a few of the fine merino sheep for
which Spain had been famous, and of which she at one time
possessed almost a monopoly, he devoted himself to scientific
breeding. The conditions of pasturage in the colony immediately
produced an alteration in the character of the fleece; but, by
paying great attention to these effects, Macarthur succeeded in
raising a type of wool which though different from was by no
means inferior to the Spanish fleece. Having occasion to go to
England in 1801, on account of a quarrel with a brother officer,
which had resulted in the resignation of his commission,
Macarthur devoted his spare time to interesting the English
Government in his experiments. He succeeded so well that when he
returned to the colony, in the year 1805, he carried with him an
order for a free grant of 5,000 acres of land, in the Cowpastures
district, where the wild cattle had been found in 1795. This was
the beginning of the famous Camden estate, so named after the
Secretary of State of the period, and here, with the full
sympathy and encouragement of Governor King, Macarthur began to
develope on a large scale the pursuit of wool-growing. The annual
export of New South Wales wool now exceeds three hundred millions
of pounds, and constitutes one-half of the export trade of the
colony, which, it must be remembered, occupies by no means so
large an area as it did in Macarthur's time. To estimate at its
true value the worth of his experiments, we must reckon the value
of the wool export of Victoria, Queensland, and Tasmania; for he
is the father of their industry, as well as of that of New South
Wales. Seldom has the perseverance of one man brought more
splendid results. We shall hear of Macarthur again, in less
prosperous circumstances, but it is right here to say that,
besides the wool-growing industry, he did much to foster another
staple branch of the commerce of the colony, viz. the wine
trade.</p>
<p>We now come to what is, perhaps, the most picturesque incident
in the early history of the colony, the incident which most
reminds us of the events which used to form the staple of
European histories.</p>
<p>Governor King, who retired from office in 1806, was succeeded
by Captain Bligh. The name is familiar to us as that of the
commander of the <i>Bounty</i>, whose fate is intimately bound up
with the history of Norfolk and Pitcairn Islands (p. 32).
Subsequent events showed that Bligh's experiences on that
memorable voyage were by no means unaccountable freaks of
circumstance, but the natural consequences of his own peculiar
character. Both in scientific ability and resourcefulness Bligh
was eminent amongst his fellows. His personal bravery was beyond
question, and he early acquired a great reputation. Though but
thirty-three when appointed to the <i>Bounty</i>, his name was
already associated with the discoveries of Cook, and with
independent contributions to the science of navigation. He had
fought with distinction in two naval engagements, and had gained
by merit the rank of lieutenant. Even the revelations of the
mutineers were counterbalanced by the admiration which his
intrepid voyage had aroused; and the incident rather hastened
than delayed his promotion. He rose to captain's rank, and earned
distinction at Camperdown and Copenhagen, and in the mutiny at
the Nore. Even his disastrous failure in New South Wales did not
put an end to his prosperous career; he died full of honours,
professional and scientific&mdash; Vice-Admiral of the Blue, and
a Fellow of the Royal Society.</p>
<p>It is obvious that we must not too hastily assume that Bligh
was alone to blame for the troubles connected with his name in
Australia. But he came upon an errand which demanded the greatest
care and discretion; and he showed very little of either quality.
One of the most pressing instructions of the Home Government to
the new Governor was to put an end at all hazards to the
iniquitous official traffic in spirits which was ruining the
colony. The existence of the traffic was surely beyond question;
the duty of suppressing it, therefore, clear. Nor could the
delinquents complain that they were not warned. In February 1807,
the Governor issued an Order totally prohibiting the use of
spirits and liquors as payment for labour or goods&mdash;in other
words, adopting the spirit of the Truck Acts by insisting on
money payments, at least in the liquor trade. In a country like
England, such an order by an executive authority would, no doubt,
have been unconstitutional; but it must be remembered that, in
the existing stage of the colony's history, the Governor was of
necessity invested with almost absolute power, and that he was
carrying out instructions received from home.</p>
<p>But, in enforcing his policy, Bligh was far from prudent. We
cannot disregard the general testimony to the harshness of his
character, and his want of consideration for the feelings of
others. And at last he took a most unfortunate step. A month
after the issue of the famous Order, a ship arrived at Port
Jackson carrying two stills, one of which was consigned to Mr
Macarthur, by this time one of the leading inhabitants of the
colony. Private distilling of alcohol being unlawful, the
Governor ordered the still to be reshipped. Here he was
unquestionably within his rights, although, in the circumstances
of Macarthur's position, and the fact being considered that he
was known to be engaged in experiments in wine-making, more
forbearance might have been shown to him. But the Governor was
suspected, rightly or wrongly, of being personally hostile to
Macarthur, and for the next few months relations were very
strained. Ultimately, on what appears to have been a very
trifling charge, not of a criminal character at all, Macarthur
was summoned by the Judge-Advocate to appear before him.
Macarthur, either treating the summons as a formality, or else
unwilling to compromise his dignity by appearing before a
tribunal which he did not respect, merely sent an explanatory
letter; whereupon the Governor issued a warrant for his
arrest.</p>
<p>On being brought before the Court, which consisted of the
Judge-Advocate and six military assessors, Macarthur objected to
the presence of the former, on the ground that he (the
Judge-Advocate) was personally hostile to himself. The military
assessors sustained the objection of the prisoner; but the
Judge-Advocate declined to vacate his seat, and, as he was
directly appointed by the Crown, the Governor had no power to
supersede him, even had he wished to do so. It is clear, however,
that there was a strong feeling of hostility against the Governor
in the minds of the military officials; for not only the
assessors, but also Major Johnston, the actual commandant of the
forces, refused to obey the Governor's summons to an interview.
In this refusal they were obviously guilty of a breach of
discipline, if of nothing more; for Bligh was their commanding
officer, and, as such, at least entitled to their presence.</p>
<p>It was evident that matters had now gone too far to be
compromised, and Major Johnston put the seal to the act of
revolution by taking possession of the Governor's person at the
head of the troops, and immediately assuming the reins of
government. This event happened at the close of January 1808, and
was attended by the orthodox accompaniments of revolution. The
adherents of the Governor were dismissed, and the favourers of
the opposition, including Macarthur himself, were installed in
their places. The Governor was not put to death, but he was kept
in prison for twelve months. Here lies the weak point of the
proceedings, from the point of view of the revolutionary party.
If, as they alleged, the Governor's conduct justified theirs,
they should have at once sent him home to plead his cause before
the only tribunal capable of judging between them, accompanying
him with such witnesses as were necessary to prove the truth of
their assertions. Instead of taking this course, they tried (but
without success) to prevent the news reaching England. Johnston
had two superior officers in Australia; and these, when they
arrived on the scene, approved his proceedings, but ultimately
set Governor Bligh at liberty. The latter, as we have said, was
received with open arms in England; and the first act of his
successor, Governor Macquarie, was to send home Johnston under
arrest. Johnston was tried by court-martial and condemned; but,
in spite of the protest of the Regent, was only cashiered.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most complete condemnation of Bligh's failure is
to be found in the success of Macquarie. In many points
resembling one another&mdash;in temper, vanity, intrepidity,
restlessness,&mdash;Bligh, whatever his excuses, unquestionably
failed in his task of governing the colony, Macquarie, as
unquestionably, succeeded. The secret of the difference is
probably to be found in the fact that, whereas Bligh's activity
was negative, Macquarie's was positive. Bligh could be immensely
active in repressing mischiefs; Macquarie was bent upon effecting
positive reforms. He saw, and it is his great merit, that if he
could put the settlers in the way of material prosperity on
honest lines, many of the bad features of the popular character
would disappear at once. With this object he set about
enterprises of all kinds. Schools and churches were founded, and
the Government money was lavishly spent on public buildings.
Measures were taken to secure the farms in the river valleys from
inundation. Roads were commenced wherever there appeared to be a
chance of opening up new country. Above all, the Governor
insisted that when a convict had served his sentence he was on
the same social and legal footing as a free immigrant. Grants of
lands were liberally made to emancipists, and they were admitted
to the learned professions. This policy was severely condemned
both at home and abroad; but there can be no doubt that it was,
in the circumstances, the one possible method of laying the
foundations of a really great community. To have maintained the
most invidious of all class distinctions, founded on a moral
superiority in many cases more apparent than real, would have
been to condemn the settlement to perpetual infancy. Macquarie
seems to have been the first Australian Governor to rise to the
opportunities of his position. His predecessors had all regarded
themselves as officials deputed to keep order among an unruly
body of men and women. Macquarie formed a far higher estimate of
his duty, and believed himself sent to develope the resources of
his vast territory, and urge his subjects forward in the path of
progress. Dictatorial and overbearing he may have been, but he
won the hearts of the people; and at the close of his long term
of office, in the year 1821, he returned to England amid the
regret of the entire colony.</p>
<p>During his government the colony expanded in many directions,
but in none more strikingly than in the exploration which
resulted in the discovery of the country to the west of the Blue
Mountains. Hitherto the Nepean river, the stream which waters the
Camden district, had seemed to be the boundary of possible
extension to the west; for beyond it lay a chain of mountains
which was deemed impassable. Even the dauntless Bass had
pronounced against any further waste of energy in that direction.
But soon after Governor Macquarie's arrival a spell of drought,
which dried up the pastures round Sydney, brought the colonists
face to face with the prospect of ruin for their stock, by this
time become very valuable.</p>
<p>At last three explorers, Blaxland, Wentworth, and Lawson,
succeeded, in the year 1813, in crossing the range, and reported
an almost unlimited extent of fine pasture land beyond. The
Governor at once sent surveyors to ascertain the possibility of
making a road across the mountains. Their report was favourable,
and the work was undertaken with the utmost resources of the
Government. It was accomplished in less than two years, a
marvellous feat if the circumstances be taken into account, and
the town of Bathurst founded, as the capital of a great pastoral
district capable of unlimited expansion.</p>
<p>And expansion speedily followed. We remember the figures at
the time of Governor Hunter's departure. When Governor Macquarie
left the colony, only twenty-one years later, the population had
increased from six thousand to thirty thousand, the stock from
ten thousand to upwards of a quarter of a million head. It is
evident, therefore, that, fast as the population had increased,
the wealth of the country had increased far more rapidly.</p>
<p>The end of Governor Macquarie's term of office marks the
conclusion of the colony's infancy. Up to this time, in spite of
its comparative prosperity, the settlement had been a severe
drain upon the British exchequer. What with costs of transport,
assistance to free emigrants, provision against famine, salaries
of civil and military officials, expenses of public works, and
other items, the colony is reputed to have cost the mother
country, in the first thirty-four years of its existence, no less
than ten millions sterling. It was money well spent; for, while a
similar expenditure in convict prisons at home would have left no
assets behind it, the ten millions sunk in Australia were laying
the foundations of a great and free country, which in after times
would prove a fair field for labour and enterprise. But it was an
act of faith, and its cost speaks, perhaps more eloquently than
anything else, of the work involved in the early days of
government. Australians are sometimes apt to speak as though they
and their fathers had done the whole work of building up
Australia. But if it be true, and it unquestionably is true in
the matter of colonization, that the beginning is the hardest
task, the British taxpayer, who, in the early years of Australian
history, had plenty of claims on his pocket, is entitled to some
of the credit of the achievement.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br>
<br>
<small>DEVELOPEMENT OF NEW SOUTH WALES.</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> next Governorship, that of Sir Thomas
Brisbane, marks a definite stage in the history of New South
Wales. The discovery of the Bathurst Plains had put an end to all
doubts of the ultimate ability of the colony to sustain an
increasing population; and now, for the first time, the tide of
free immigration began to flow. The rapid increase of population
in England, which followed the close of the Napoleonic wars,
provided a constant succession of aspirants anxious to make their
fortunes in Australia. The speedy result of this immigration was
a change in the industrial conditions of the colony. Hitherto the
Government had felt itself unable to rely upon the settlers to
provide entirely for their own maintenance. Notwithstanding the
obvious and terrible consequences of a deficient harvest, the
traditions of old days were strong, and the recklessness and
improvidence of the farmers sometimes jeopardized the very
existence of the settlement. Notwithstanding the fertility of the
soil, wheat had long to be imported in large quantities from
India. And the Government, partly perhaps for the sake of
employing the convicts, but equally to protect the community
against the consequences of the idleness of the emancipists, used
to carry on farming operations on a great scale. Needless to say,
these operations were costly and difficult; and the Government
was only too glad to relinquish them when it saw sufficient free
settlers engaged in supplying the market. By this change the
community at once approached more nearly to the familiar model of
ordinary industrial life, and the good example of the new
colonists spread to their neighbours, notwithstanding the fact
that there was for long a deep social gulf between the two
classes of freemen and emancipists.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Brisbane was a humane man and a scholar. Not only
did he endeavour, by introducing new industries, such as tobacco
and sugar growing, to find profitable employment for all classes,
but he pushed forward the exploration of the continent,
especially in a northern direction. It was, in fact, during his
administration, in the year 1823, that Surveyor Oxley practically
rediscovered Queensland; for the previous explorations of
Flinders in Moreton Bay seem to have been forgotten. And the
Governor rendered himself famous in the world of science by the
observatory which he built at Parramatta, and by the solar
observations recorded there.</p>
<p>But the great achievement of Governor Brisbane's
administration was the introduction of institutions which
ultimately served as the basis of self-government in Australia.
An exact description of the political evolution of the Australian
colonies belongs to another chapter; here it is only necessary to
point out that hitherto there had been no free institutions, in
the ordinary sense of the term. The Governor had been responsible
solely to the Home or Colonial Office in London. So far as the
colonists were concerned, his word was law. Not only did he lay
down rules for the conduct of the settlers, but he directed the
execution of them, and he was himself, in the last resort, the
highest local court of appeal in all cases. The only immediate
check upon his omnipotence was the presence in the colony of
officials who, though bound to obey his lawful orders, could not
be permanently dismissed by him. There lay, of course, always an
appeal, by way of representation, to the Home Government; but
England was a long way off in those days. And in extreme cases,
as Governor Bligh had found, there was the remedy of revolution;
but that was a remedy from which moderate reformers naturally
shrank. As a consequence, the fate of the colony for the time
being depended very much upon the personal character of the
Governor; and we have been justified, hitherto, in breaking up
its history into sections corresponding with the terms of office
enjoyed by its respective rulers. It was long before the Governor
ceased to be the most powerful influence in the affairs of the
colony; but we are now entering upon a period in which
institutions will gradually take the place of men.</p>
<p>This period begins definitely in the year 1823, with the
passing of the first Constitutional Statute which operated in
Australia. The statute did not by any means provide a complete
set of free institutions, as we understand them, or even as they
were understood in England at that time. But when we consider the
general conditions of the colony, and the conservative reaction
which had come over England after the French Revolution, and
which lasted until the Reform Act of 1832, we shall probably
admit that the concession of 1823 was a substantial step. By it
the former military administration of justice, by a
Judge-Advocate and military assessors, was superseded by a
Supreme Court on an English model, with a Chief Justice, and the
right to a trial by jury in civil cases, if both the parties
agreed upon it. But in criminal cases the jury was still to
consist of military officers, seven in number, although the
prisoner was to be entitled to challenge them on any grounds for
which an ordinary juror could be objected to in England. His
Majesty in Council was, however, authorized to extend the jury
system in any way deemed desirable; and, as a matter of fact, it
was not very long before the jury system was introduced into
criminal trials in Australia. Moreover, convicts were no longer
to be excluded from giving evidence in Courts of Justice. Other
provisions were made by the Act, on the subject of appeals; but
these will be more particularly discussed hereafter.</p>
<p>The political innovations made by the statute were also
important. They provided for the appointment of a Council with
legislative and financial powers, albeit under certain very
substantial limitations, which will be alluded to elsewhere. This
Council at first consisted entirely of Government officials, and
was of course subject to no process of popular election. But, as
Lord Bathurst explained in his letter which covered the warrant
of appointment, it was intended by the Home Government that the
new Council should at least to some degree represent the views of
non-official colonists; and this pledge was redeemed in the year
1825 by the nomination of three independent members.
Notwithstanding its carefully guarded character, this Council is
of great importance in the history of the colony; for it at once
formed a nucleus around which the elements of criticism and legal
opposition gathered, and, by their action, ultimately produced
the materials for self-government. This will appear as we proceed
with our story.</p>
<p>The other great political object of the statute was the
separation of Tasmania (then known as <i>Van Diemen's Land</i>)
from the mother colony. This topic belongs more properly to the
history of Tasmania; here it is sufficient to say that the Home
Government, at the time of the passing of the Act, apparently
hesitated between complete and partial separation, and took
powers for both. Lord Bathurst ultimately decided in favour of
partial separation only; and Van Diemen's Land had to wait many
years before becoming completely independent of the Government at
Sydney.</p>
<p>In other respects the statute is a notable land-mark in the
history of New South Wales. It gave parliamentary sanction to the
power, previously exercised somewhat irregularly by the Governors
of the colony, to remit part of their sentences to convicts of
good behaviour, and by so doing enabled the Governor to dispose
with greater facility of the available population. It also
empowered him to create separate settlements for convicts who had
been again convicted of felony since their arrival in the colony;
and thereby encouraged further colonization, while at the same
time it enabled the colonial authorities to weed out specially
dangerous characters from the main settlement. Finally, it
legalized the practice of indentured service, that is, the
entering into articles of service for a period of seven years or
under by young men with employers who were willing to pay for
their passage to Australia; and provided for the enforcement of
such arrangements both against the parties to them and third
persons who attempted to break them. Thus the Home Government did
its best to induce free emigration to the colony; but the general
circumstances of the time, and the inducements soon afterwards
held out by the colonies themselves, were more powerful
incentives.</p>
<p>The mother colony of Australia now started upon a career of
progress and developement which, in spite of stormy interludes,
it maintained until the crisis of 1843. The marks of freedom and
independence manifested themselves one by one. Freedom of the
press was formally proclaimed in 1824, and although (as might
have been expected) the liberty was at first abused, and caused
much trouble during the governorship of Sir Ralph Darling
(1825-1831), yet, under the more judicious rule of Sir Richard
Bourke (1831-1837), the difficulties were removed, and the
problem of reconciling free government with free criticism has
ultimately been solved in Australia. In the year 1827 the colony
was rich enough to support its own civil government (though the
mother country naturally continued to pay for the maintenance and
guard of the convicts she sent to the colony); and, a few years
later, the Government of the colony began even to vote funds to
assist the immigration of desirable colonists. This practice was
warmly seconded by the Imperial Government, until the attractions
of the colony ceased to need any such superfluous addition to its
natural advantages.</p>
<p>It is perhaps necessary to say a few words concerning the
troubled reign of Sir Ralph Darling, though its most exciting
incidents were only of indirect importance in the history of the
colony. Governor Darling appears to have been an honourable and
upright man; but quite unsuitable for the position which he was
called upon to fill. He was annoyed (as other men after him have
been) by the personal, and often grossly unfair criticisms of the
local press; and, forgetting that such criticisms are better left
to answer themselves, he stooped to quarrel with antagonists whom
he should have treated with silent contempt. As a natural
consequence, his every act was misrepresented, and insult after
insult was heaped upon him. He was accused of cruelty in the case
of two soldiers, whom he detected in the unworthy trick of trying
to escape active service by getting themselves convicted of
felony. He was charged with gross favouritism in the grants of
public lands&mdash;a charge which it was almost impossible to
rebut at a time when no system or order prevailed in the disposal
of such property. He was further accused of harsh conduct in the
case of Captain Robison, who was sentenced by a court martial to
be dismissed the army. Certain well-meaning but ill-informed
persons, anxious to pose as philanthropists, took up the matter
in the House of Commons, and it was referred to the consideration
of a select committee. The committee cannot possibly be accused
of partiality towards the Governor. It included two of his actual
accusers in the House, and a majority of names quite above
suspicion. The Committee reported an entire acquittal on all the
charges proceeded with; several of the accusations were not even
supported by evidence. Darling himself was knighted and received
further promotion.</p>
<p>Unhappy, however, as the period of Sir Ralph Darling's
governorship was, it probably led indirectly to more than one
important step in the progress of the colony.</p>
<p>For instance, it soon became clear to the Home Government that
some further extension of constitutional machinery was necessary.
The tiny Council of seven, half of them officials, with its
limited powers, formed no adequate medium of communication
between the Governor and the mass of the settlers. Accordingly,
by a statute of the Imperial Parliament passed in the year 1828,
the maximum number of the Council was raised to fifteen, and its
legislative powers considerably increased. This important change
virtually placed the official members of the Council in a
minority in questions upon which the Government and the settlers
as a whole were divided in opinion; and although the Council
could not pass, or even discuss a proposed law without the
Governor's consent, its position in legislation was materially
improved. In the ordinary administrative work of government the
Governor was still practically supreme, except where he chose to
fetter his own action by giving his consent to colonial laws
which controlled it. But in the administration of justice still
further steps towards a free model were taken; and the somewhat
sweeping clause, which introduced the whole of existing English
law en bloc, though it subsequently gave rise to some technical
difficulty, was obviously calculated to afford the ordinary
colonist substantial protection against the arbitrary action of
Government.</p>
<p>Again, the charges against Governor Darling on the subject of
Crown lands stirred up the Home Government to take that very
important subject in hand. It is well known to lawyers that, by
the driest of legal fictions, a fiction moreover which, unlike
most legal fictions, never corresponded with fact, the Crown is
supposed to be not merely overlord but absolute owner of all land
in Great Britain to which no subject can show a specific title.
This fiction had once had great practical consequences in
England, in the days of turbulence, when the forfeiture of a
traitor's land was a convenient punishment and a warning. But the
theory had almost died a natural death when it sprang to life
again in the most unexpected manner with the acquisition of the
great English colonies. For if, as was the case, no subject could
show a recognized title to any of the countless acres of America
and Australia, at a time when those countries were first opened
up by white men, it followed that, according to this relic of
feudal theory, these acres belonged to the Crown. It may seem
almost incredible that a question of such magnitude should be
settled by the revival of a purely technical and antiquarian
fiction. Nevertheless the fact is so, and it is perhaps the
strongest testimony possible to the law-abidingness and innate
conservatism of the Anglo-Saxon race. No statute, no struggle, no
heated debate marks the settlement of the question. The Crown
quietly assumed the ownership of Australian land; and the
assumption stood the strain, not merely of the rush for sheep
pastures, but, which is far more wonderful, of the rush for gold.
The advanced guard of the exploring colonists might burst into
country never before trodden by the foot of white man; but they
could claim no acre of it, except through the grant of the
Crown.</p>
<p>In fact, the Crown (that is to say the Government which acted
in the name of the Crown) treated the unoccupied land of the
Australian colonies as a great reserve fund from which to recoup
itself the outlay incurred in founding the settlement, as well as
a provision for future developements. For a long time land in
Australia was practically of no pecuniary value, owing to the
fact that any respectable applicant could always obtain a free
grant. The policy upon which the Government started was, briefly,
to give a moderate grant (say of three or four hundred acres) to
every official or free settler who desired it, and to "assign" to
him the services of a limited number of convicts, in return for
which he undertook to relieve the Government of the cost of their
maintenance. The latter practice was a bad one. Not only were
services thus extorted almost worthless; but the system did a
great deal to put the honourable relationship of employer and
employed on a bad footing throughout Australia. It was not,
however, discontinued until the year 1838, on the eve of the
abolition of transportation.</p>
<p>At first, then, the grants of land were on a moderate scale,
and made with a view to their employment in agriculture, or in
the feeding of store cattle. They were generally irrevocable, but
were sometimes charged with the payment of a small quit-rent, to
commence after a certain period. This was especially the case
with the smaller grants made to "expirees" or emancipists; and it
was felt that, in such cases, the original title deeds would
hardly be such as future generations would be proud of.</p>
<p>While the settlement continued small, this rather indefinite
state of things did not cause much difficulty. Land at length
acquired a market price, but it was probably little more than the
value of the buildings and other improvements upon it. Still, as
the country in the immediate neighbourhood of the capital became
taken up, the land gradually acquired a monopoly value,
increasing with the growth of population.</p>
<p>And when the discovery of the plains beyond the Blue Mountains
had opened up an indefinite vista of expansion, and flocks and
herds of great size began to appear, the land question assumed a
new aspect. The great sheep and cattle breeders wanted, not
hundreds of acres under high cultivation, but thousands of acres
which required no labour to render them serviceable. We have seen
that Macarthur had secured his grant of 5,000 acres at Camden
from the Home Government. But those who followed him had no time
for such formalities. Hastily collecting as many head of sheep
and cattle as they could lay hands on, and taking with them one
or two "stock riders", often the most reckless and daring of the
assigned convicts, they plunged into a new district, and
generally laid claim to some enormous area, which they did not
attempt to cultivate, and upon which they built only the minimum
of necessary accommodation. They argued, with great force, that
the land was No Man's Land, and that they, as first comers, were
entitled to occupy it. But it is certain that they did not expect
this bold argument to prevail. The truth is that, as they spent
nothing in improvements, they were prepared to risk being
ejected. At the worst, they might realize fortunes before the
Government had made up its mind how to treat them; and they knew
that the official mind was tender towards vested interests. These
pioneer settlers received the name of "squatters"; a term which
is probably of American origin, though it was first used in
America in a slightly different sense.</p>
<p>In the year 1824 the Home Government endeavoured to introduce
some order into the system of land grants. But the effort is a
striking example of the folly of attempting to manage a distant
possession from a London office. The Secretary of State directed
that the whole territory of New South Wales should be divided
into counties, hundreds, and parishes, after the English model,
and a complete valuation made throughout the colony, with the
object of fixing an average price for each parish. Any individual
was to be at liberty to purchase any quantity up to fifteen
square miles for money down; smaller lots might be bought for
deferred quit-rents. The assignment system was to be
continued.</p>
<p>It is impossible to believe that the statesman who sanctioned
these Regulations had the faintest knowledge of the existing
conditions of New South Wales. In the first place, to conduct a
complete survey and valuation of the vast territory of the colony
would have demanded the exclusive services of the surveying staff
for several years. In the second, either purely nominal values
must have been put upon the outlying parishes, in which case huge
areas of land would have been bought for a mere trifle, or a
substantial price must have been arbitrarily fixed, which would
have rendered it impossible to find a purchaser in the colony.
Surely the follies of statesmen have been many; but it may be
questioned whether such another egregious document ever emanated
from a Government office. Governor Darling, to whom it was
addressed, contemptuously disregarded it.</p>
<p>But in truth the Home Government itself hardly treated it
seriously; for it immediately violated the spirit of the
Regulations by making large free grants of land to the Australian
Agricultural Company and the Van Diemen's Land Company. This was
a most mischievous step, and it was only the comparative thinness
of population in Australia and Tasmania which prevented these
grants from becoming the source of serious difficulty. Had the
tide of migration to Australia been as rapid as that to America,
or had these grants stood in the way of the gold rush in the
fifties, there would have been trouble.</p>
<p>But, after several minor hesitations and alterations, Lord
Ripon proclaimed a definite policy in 1831. He laid it down that
from henceforth there should be one uniform method of disposing
of Crown lands in Australia, namely by public auction at which
the land would go to the highest bidder, a minimum price being
fixed by the Crown. Even those persons, such as assisted
emigrants and military men, who were entitled to free grants,
were to have the value of their claims estimated in money and to
deduct the amount from the sum which they bid at the auction.</p>
<p>This somewhat crude attempt at a settlement of the question
did not touch one important side of it, viz. the position of the
squatters. It is true that any one might, by the Regulations,
select any portion of unappropriated land that he pleased, and
have it put up to auction at the minimum of five shillings an
acre. And as it was certain that no one would bid more than five
shillings an acre for outlying land, the selector might be sure
of it at that figure. But the squatter was not prepared to give
five shillings an acre, or any other substantial sum, for his
land. He argued that he ought to have it for nothing; or, if not
the land itself, at least the use of it. And, moreover, by a
deliberate misreading of the Regulations, Governor Darling
declined to allow selection beyond the settled districts, and the
squatter was, therefore, left in the position of a mere
trespasser.</p>
<p>But it was found impossible to treat him as a trespasser. A
colonial statute of the year 1833 had created a body of officials
known as "Commissioners of Crown Lands", who were specially
instructed to prevent any encroachment or intrusion on Crown
lands, especially such encroachment as might lead ultimately to a
claim of occupation. But after a few years it proved quite
hopeless to attempt to enforce the statute of 1833; and, in fact,
to have done so would have been to stamp out an industry of the
greatest value to the colony. So Governor Bourke wisely made up
his mind to face the inevitable, and sanction a system which he
could not prevent. In the year 1836 he divided the outlying
territory of the colony into pastoral or squatting districts, and
granted temporary grazing licences to applicants upon payment of
a small fee. These licences created no definite tenure of the
land, but merely excused the holder from the penalties of
trespass within a certain district for a limited period. A
colonial statute of the year 1839 legalized this practice, and
put it upon a systematic footing by organizing a body of "Border
Police", to act under the directions of the Commissioners of
Crown Lands in keeping order in the pastoral districts. The
squatters themselves, although the Government at first recognized
no definite area of holding, arranged with one another the limits
of their respective "runs" or "stations", * and, ultimately, as
might have been expected, claimed a definite interest in their
occupations. The pastoral districts themselves are interesting as
forming the basis of the later division of the colony into
electoral provinces. Up to 1850, however, they constituted a sort
of Ishmael's territory, in which the Land Commissioners and the
Border Police alone represented law and order.</p>
<p class="foot">[* It is not a little singular that two such
opposite ideas as motion and fixity should have been used
practically as synonyms in Australian history. The "run"
obviously looks at the matter from the point of view of the
sheep; the "station" is the squatter's residence.]</p>
<p>It is impossible, within the limits of these pages, to follow
the intricate history of the land question at length; but one
other step taken in this period must be alluded to. This was the
appointment by the Imperial Government in 1840 of a Board of
"Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners", to act as advisers
to the Colonial Secretary in all matters respecting the disposal
of Crown Lands in the Australian Colonies, and on the subject of
emigration. The Commissioners immediately proceeded to lay down a
most important rule, which virtually governed the policy of New
South Wales and her daughter colonies until the gold discoveries.
This rule was that, while the proceeds of land sales should still
continue the exclusive property of the Imperial (as distinct from
the Colonial) Government, the sum produced should be regarded as
a trust for the benefit of that colony or part of a colony which
produced it, and should be expended for its benefit one half in
the carrying on of public works, the other in assisting
immigration.</p>
<p>In pursuance of this principle, a very important new set of
Land Regulations, drawn up in pursuance of an Imperial statute
affecting all the Australasian colonies, was issued in 1842. So
far as they relate to the present state of New South Wales, they
did not effect any serious change in the principle of land sales,
except by raising the minimum reserve to a pound an acre. But by
dividing the old mother colony into three land districts, the
Northern (or Moreton Bay) district, the Middle (or Sydney)
district, and the Southern (or Port Phillip) district, they
foreshadowed unmistakeably the ultimate separation of Victoria
and Queensland from the mother-colony, and they seem in fact so
to have been understood. They created three separate land funds
for the three districts; and thus rendered a future financial
separation comparatively easy.</p>
<p>The year 1842 was also in other ways important in the history
of New South Wales, for in it was passed the Imperial statute
which first introduced representative institutions into
Australia. Again reserving the details of the measure (which is a
landmark in the political history of Australia) for a future
chapter, we may point out that now for the first time in a scheme
of Australian government the legislative body received that
foremost place which Englishmen have long been accustomed to
award it. The plan was no longer to give judicial institutions
with a minimum of parliamentary government attached; but to
create a scheme of representative government with independent
executive and judicial authorities. The nominee element is not
excluded by the statute of 1842, but it is reduced to an absolute
minority (twelve in a Council of thirty-six). And, what was
regarded as even more important, only half of the twelve are to
be holders of Government offices. Though the franchise is fixed
on a property basis, the colonial legislature is to have power to
alter it. The power to initiate as well as to discuss legislative
proposals is conferred upon the Council, and, subject to certain
reservations for the salaries of Government officials, and to the
very important reservation of the Land Fund, the Council is to
have control over the finances of the colony. An elaborate scheme
of local government is also provided by the Act; but this was
altogether premature, and fell through directly. The final
clauses of the statute empower the Queen in Council to separate
from the original territory of New South Wales any districts
north of the 26th degree of south latitude, and to confer upon
them the more elementary system of government which the parent
colony is just throwing off. These clauses obviously foreshadow
the future independence of Queensland; but they seem to have been
restricted in their wording, to soothe the anxiety of those who
were opposed to the separation of Tasmania and Victoria.</p>
<p>A few words more must suffice to dispose of the early history
of New South Wales. The most marked social feature of the period
upon which the colony entered with the introduction of the new
constitution was the gradual disappearance of the penal element.
The practice of assigning convict servants had been stopped, at
any rate to a large extent 1838; two years later, transportation
to New South Wales was itself abolished; and, although a
desperate attempt to revive both practices was made in 1849, the
feeling of the majority of the colonists was too plain to be
mistaken. Except where such help was almost impossible to obtain,
e.g. in the remoter squatting districts, the settlers greatly
preferred to pay the higher price and secure the greater
efficiency of free labour; and the attempt of 1849 was productive
of something very like a revolution. The Constitution of 1842 by
implication allowed equal political rights to freemen and
emancipists; and this policy, combined with the cessation of
convict immigration and distribution, did much to obliterate the
old line of social cleavage. The numbers of the free settlers had
so grown that they were well able to set an improved social
fashion, and were in no danger of being either outvoted or
oppressed by their emancipist neighbours.</p>
<p>But this change was at first productive of considerable
suffering. The colony still laboured under the disadvantages of
the bad commercial system originally necessitated by the peculiar
circumstances of its history. It was accustomed to look largely
to other countries for the supply of capital, and even, in some
cases, of commodities for immediate consumption. Of course, at
the time to which we are alluding, there was no native supply of
precious metals, and the fact that in its early days the colony
had been of necessity dependent upon Europe for a supply of coin,
had led to false notions concerning the nature of capital,
especially to the belief that, without an actual influx of gold
and silver, it was impossible for the colony to exist. The
cessation of the heavy subsidy (about &pound;200,000 <i>per
annum</i>), which the Imperial Government had continued to pay so
long as the colony received its convicts, caused a scarcity of
bullion, and tied the hands of the Government in the initiation
of public works. The colonists did not see that this scarcity was
more than compensated by the fall of the prices of necessaries in
their own market, while it, of course, left the value of their
produce to the outside world absolutely untouched. In the year
1841 the price of the 2 lb. loaf fell from 7&frac12;<i>d</i>. to
4&frac12;<i>d</i>., and did not exceed 5<i>d</i>. in any of the
following ten years. The price of beef steadily fell, as did also
that of butter, cheese, and almost all other necessaries of life.
Wages fell too, but in nothing like the same proportion, so that
the wage-earner was really better off than he had been before, in
spite of, or rather because of the free immigration, which
brought many employers of labour. Moreover, wages recovered long
before prices, which continued to show a downward tendency till
the gold rush of 1851. But real harm was caused by the excessive
speculation in the newly opened lands which took place, and the
bad system of banking which began to prevail. To this period we
may perhaps date that practice of putting absurdly inflated
values upon land and other securities, which has done so much to
damage the reputation of Australian finance. Amongst the
colonists themselves, these sanguine views are readily understood
and discounted; but it must be remembered that Australia deals
largely with the outside world in securities, and is, in her own
view, dependent upon European and American capital for her
developement. And when banks and building societies actually
operate upon the basis of these fictitious values, and fail in
consequence, the effect produced is not encouraging.</p>
<p>We are not compelled, however, to leave the early history of
the colony with melancholy reflections. The colonists tided over
the crisis of 1843 in one way or another. Some of their
expedients were more ingenious, perhaps, than altogether sound.
It is said that the assets of the unfortunate Bank of Australia
were disposed of by lottery, in spite of the opposition of the
Governor. The whole colony seemed bent on the plan, and if the
community chose to distribute its losses through the exciting
medium of luck, there could be little harm done, so long as the
step was in no way sanctioned by Government, and did not become a
precedent. Less irregular means were in time gradually adopted,
and before the end of Governor Gipps' administration, the colony
was so prosperous that the Governor could afford to discourage
the enterprising explorers who found indications of gold in the
Bathurst district. Sir George Gipps did not wish to see the
steady industry of the colony disturbed by the exciting pursuit
of gold-digging. His attempt may remind us somewhat forcibly of
King Canute's alleged adventure with the ocean; but it is clear
that the Governor, a popular and kind-hearted man, did not see
any pressing need for new occupations.</p>
<p>These views are entirely borne out by the figures which reveal
the state of the colony at the close of our period. In the year
1851 the population was found to be nearly 360,000, showing an
increase of about 1,100 per cent. during the previous thirty
years. The live stock had increased during the last nine years
200 per cent., from five to fifteen million head. It is
noteworthy, however, that the alienation of Crown lands had
received a sudden and severe check by the introduction of the
pound an acre minimum in 1842. During the years 1842 to 1850,
inclusive, less than 50,000 acres had been disposed of; while in
the previous five years, under the small reserve fixed by the
Governor, upwards of a million acres had been alienated. No doubt
the excessive purchases and speculations of the earlier period,
which had been stimulated by the sudden progress of the newly
founded settlement at Port Phillip (though the figures quoted do
not include Port Phillip sales), produced a severe reaction,
which the policy of the Home Government in fixing the high
reserve of 20<i>s</i>. an acre was said to intensify. During the
whole of the period 1842-1850, the Government and the colonists
were divided on this important question. The Government took the
view that sales at a low price encouraged speculation, spread the
population over an area out of all proportion to its wants, and
alienated the interests of future generations. The colonists
urged that the land belonged to the people of the colony (i.e.
the existing inhabitants) and that every facility ought to be
given them to do what they liked with it. The question is still
an open one; but it is to be observed that even the
self-governing colonies, in which colonial opinion may be said to
be omnipotent, have come to the conclusion, as evidenced by their
policy, that there was much wisdom in the views of the Home
Government in the old days.</p>
<p>It will, of course, be understood that the amount of the land
<i>sales</i> in no way indicates the extent of territory under
occupation at the close of our period; for the practice of
squatting on unsurveyed wild lands had spread enormously since
the introduction of the licensing system. Its extent can best be
gathered from the figures relative to stock already stated, and
from a report sent home by Sir George Gipps so early as 1843,
which declared that practically the whole of the vast territory
south of the Darling, with the exception of the settled counties,
was in the hands of the squatters. The purely nominal character
of the return received by Government for the use of this land is
shown by the fact that, in the year 1840, the Crown income from
700 stations, some of them comprising hundreds of thousands of
acres, only reached &pound;60; in the following year it fell to
&pound;20. Even the imposition of a stock tax in the year 1839
hardly altered the absurdity of this state of things, for the
stock tax was applicable to the purposes of general expenditure,
while the Border Police were supposed to be maintained out of the
proceeds of the land licences. Manifestly, the squatters were
getting valuable privileges for nothing, and the Government, in
the interests of justice, determined to put an end to the farce.
For several years the battle raged hotly between the Governor and
the squatters, and at one time threatened to produce a deadlock.
In the end, however, a compromise was effected, and, finally, an
Imperial statute of the year 1847 authorised the granting of
pastoral leases for terms of years varying from one to fourteen,
according to the probability that the land would or would not be
required for settlement purposes. The squatter was to pay an
agistment rent varying with the feeding capacity of his run, and
was not to be allowed to use any part of his land for
agricultural purposes, except so much as would be required for
his own food. Moreover (and this clause turned out to be very
important) at the expiry of his lease he was to have the first
right to purchase the land at its unimproved value (never to be
taken as less than &pound;1 an acre). The squatters grumbled
immensely at the Act, and refused to take up their leases, though
in most cases they paid the new rent. But when the gold rush
came, and the value of land rose enormously, the squatters
demanded their leases as from the date of the Act, and,
therewith, their right to purchase at unimproved value. Perhaps
it was natural, but it was rather undignified. However, this
subject belongs to another chapter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br>
<br>
<small>THE DAUGHTER COLONIES OF NEW SOUTH WALES.<br>
<br>
I. <i>Tasmania. (Van Diemen's Land.)</i></small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>IT</small> must have been manifestly obvious, even at
the time when Governor Phillip's commission was granted, that the
vast area included in his jurisdiction could not be more than
nominally governed by a single ruler. A territory of a million
square miles, rather more than nine times the size of the United
Kingdom, could only be administered by a single head so long as
settlement was confined to a fraction of the territory. Ignorance
of the nature of the country, a desire to leave the Governor's
hands free, above all, an anxiety to ward off foreign claims,
combined to produce the magnificent terms of Governor Phillip's
commission. When it was issued, the general opinion was (as we
have seen) that Tasmania formed part of the mainland. Port
Phillip and its pasture lands were undreamt of. Even the country
behind Port Jackson was unexplored; and the territory which is
now the colony of Queensland was only guessed at from casual
observations along the coast.</p>
<p>The discoveries of Flinders and Bass in the southern straits,
and their adventurous voyage round Van Diemen's Land (as it was
then called) excited much interest in Sydney; and this interest
was turned into uneasiness when, three years later, a French
squadron under Commodore Baudin paid a somewhat lengthy visit to
the island. Governor King, of New South Wales, made up his mind
to attempt a settlement in Tasmania. He was not only actuated by
a wish to anticipate the French. The little sub-colony of Norfolk
Island, in which he, as its first Lieutenant-Governor, took
considerable interest, was in an unsatisfactory condition, and he
cast about for a new home for the settlers. Moreover, he deemed
it possible to improve the tone of the settlement at Sydney by
removing from it some of the most turbulent characters. Nor was
he alone in his views; the Home Government had begun to doubt the
prudence of sending so many criminals to one spot, and was
anxious to found a new settlement.</p>
<p>The spot first chosen was Port Phillip, the nidus of the
present colony of Victoria. The explorations of Bass and
Flinders, the attractions of a settlement which had been formed
at Twofold Bay, and the dread of French attempts on the southern
coast of Australia, combined to fix the resolution of the
Government. The Ocean, with 400 prisoners, convoyed by the
warship Calcutta, sailed from England under the command of
Captain Collins, the former advocate-general of New South Wales,
and reached Port Phillip in 1803. A very short experience,
however, led Collins to the conclusion that Port Phillip was an
unsuitable site for a settlement, and he made strong
representations on the subject to his official chief at Sydney.
In the meantime, Lieutenant Bowen, in the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, had
sailed for the southern coast of Van Diemen's Land, and landed
his party at a place called Risdon, on the Derwent River. Pushed
by his difficulties, Collins sent a subordinate in Bowen's ship,
which had by that time returned to his relief, to explore the
northern coast of Tasmania, within a few hours' sail of the
anchorage at Port Phillip. He explored the entrance to the river
Tamar, but his report, though not altogether unfavourable, led
Collins to prefer the southern coast, and in February 1804 he
joined Lieutenant Bowen at Risdon. Even Risdon did not, however,
satisfy him, and, dropping further down the Derwent, he finally
anchored at a place known as Sullivan's Cove, which he directed
to be laid out as a town bearing the name of Lord Hobart, the
then Secretary of State for the colonies. Hobart Town, or, as it
is now called, the City of Hobart, has to this day remained the
capital of Tasmania.</p>
<p>But it was deemed unadvisable to leave the northern shore
entirely open to the approaches of possible rivals, and so, in
the same year (1804) a small expedition was despatched from
Sydney under Colonel Paterson, an officer distinguished alike for
his humanity and his intelligence, with a view of further
exploring the Tamar. He founded a small settlement, known as York
Town, which still survives; but in the year 1806 he removed his
quarters to the site of the present city of Launceston, at the
junction of the North and South Esk, which here unite to form the
Tamar river. The Tamar is not such a splendid stream as the
Derwent, it long bore an undeserved reputation for danger, and
Launceston, being very considerably further from its port
(Dalrymple) than Hobart from the mouth of the Derwent, did not at
first obtain the commercial advantages which its nearness to the
mainland would otherwise have procured for it. From Launceston
and Hobart, the two early settlements, the colonization of
Tasmania has ultimately been effected. Until the year 1826, they
were the respective capitals of the two counties (Cornwall and
Buckinghamshire) into which the whole island was divided. In the
year 1807 Lieutenant Laycock and his party started to cross by
land from Launceston to Hobart, and found, to their astonishment,
that they could travel the whole way through clear country.
Immediately afterwards, Collins commenced the great trunk road
from north to south, which is still the admiration of travellers
for its smoothness and easiness; and in the year 1812 Launceston
was definitely subjected to the Government at Hobart, the whole
island thus passing under one administration.</p>
<p>The early years of the little settlement at Hobart were not
without their excitements. One of the first acts of the Home
Government in connection with the new colony was to order the
removal of the settlers from Norfolk Island to the shores of the
Derwent. The order was obeyed with reluctance, for many of the
settlers had become attached to their island home, and did not
care to face again the hardships of a change. Norfolk Island had,
however, become unpopular with the Home Government, and the
settlers had to go. They were given the choice between New South
Wales and Tasmania, but their recollections of Sydney were not
encouraging, and most of them preferred the uncertainties of the
new colony. They were treated with every consideration by the
authorities, provided with grants of land and loans of stock, and
fed from the Government stores for six months. They were
distributed over different parts of the colony, many of them
being settled in a lovely spot on the banks of the Upper Derwent,
called after them New Norfolk, which, though later receiving the
official name of Elizabeth Town (after Mrs Macquarie), has
retained its original title. It is now a prosperous and beautiful
district, perhaps more resembling an English country side than
any other place in Australia; but it owes little to its original
settlers. The migration was not a success. The weaker immigrants
succumbed to the temptations of Hobart, and drifted back into
crime; some of the better ones managed to return to their beloved
island. Only a few prospered in the new colony. One of the most
valuable acquisitions of the settlement at Hobart came, however,
through the migration. Joseph Holt, an Irish political prisoner,
a man of great ability, was befriended by Collins, and did much
to start the agriculture of Tasmania on a sound basis, by
introducing improved methods of farming among private settlers,
and thus rendering Government farms unnecessary. The Government
idea of cultivation was to provide as much labour for convicts as
possible, of a kind that would not facilitate their chances of
escape. Gangs of men worked together, encumbered with chains, and
using only a clumsy hoe for tool. Holt spent some years in
Australia after the expiration of his sentence; and, though most
of them were passed near Sydney, he did a good deal for Tasmania.
Ultimately he amassed a small fortune, with which he set sail for
England, dying, after many adventures, in his native land.</p>
<p>Soon after the arrival of the Norfolk Island settlers, the new
colony was threatened with the horrors of famine, It was, of
course, at first mainly dependent on other countries, principally
on New South Wales, for the necessaries of life. In the year 1806
a disastrous inundation overtook the valley of the Hawkesbury,
the chief corn-growing district of the mother-colony. The prices
of maize and wheat are said to have risen to &pound;5 and
&pound;6 a bushel. There was little to spare for the settlement
at Hobart. A vessel despatched to India for wheat was wrecked;
starvation stared the colony in the face. Luckily it was found
that kangaroo meat could be procured in fair quantities, and for
several years the settlers subsisted mainly on this food, while
the free men, who did not wear Government uniform, were content
to clothe themselves in skins, of which, fortunately, there was
no scarcity. This state of things produced evils which survived
the famine period, though the latter lasted until 1810. Many of
the convicts, especially the assigned servants, were employed in
hunting the kangaroo, an occupation which they, quite naturally,
preferred to the monotony of field work. Their employers were
tempted to use them in this way, for the Government paid eighteen
pence a pound for kangaroo meat; and fortunes were made by those
who were lucky enough to have skilful servants. But the bonds of
discipline were inevitably relaxed by such occupations, and many
convicts seized the opportunity to escape. Of these a large
proportion perished miserably in the trackless bush, or, after a
short experience of freedom, crawled back again to beg
forgiveness. But a few of the bolder spirits succeeded in
maintaining life by hunting, or by plundering lonely homesteads:
and their success invited imitators. The Australian bushranger is
hardly an attractive person. He combines (or combined, for he is
now practically extinct) the vices of civilization with a choice
assortment of savage villanies, though occasionally he makes a
display of rather tawdry chivalry. From 1810 to 1830 the outbreak
raged fiercely; and almost every descendant of old Tasmanian
settlers has family legends to tell, of midnight attacks, or of
lonely farms surprised when all the men were away. Many settlers,
men and women, became as brave in defence as the rangers were
daring in attack; and grants of land as rewards for clever
captures were not at all uncommon. These lands often perpetuate
by their names the services for which they were granted, and thus
weave a thread of romance into the somewhat monotonous web of
colonial history. The Government remained powerless till the
outrages had provoked general resentment among the settlers,
after which the more violent outlaws were gradually captured; but
the spirit survived in the practice of sheep and cattle stealing
by convict drovers, which prevailed at one time to an enormous
extent. A revival of the older style occurred in New South Wales
and Victoria after the gold rush; and was not finally stamped out
until the capture of the notorious Kelly gang in the year
1880.</p>
<p>The early years of the colony were also enlivened by the visit
of Governor Bligh, who, as has been related, after a year's
imprisonment at Sydney, was permitted to leave New South Wales on
his promise not to land in Australia on his way home. This
promise he did not consider binding, and in the year 1809 he
appeared at Hobart. The Lieutenant-Governor was in a somewhat
difficult position; for Bligh was by law his superior officer,
though in fact he had been deposed by the revolution at Sydney.
Ultimately, Collins forbade any settler to hold communication
with the deposed commander; but one or two were shrewder than the
Lieutenant-Governor in their expectations of the attitude which
the Home Government would take up, and their shrewdness received
its reward. At the end of the year Governor Macquarie reached
Sydney; and Bligh, when he returned from Tasmania for a short
time to the scene of his deposition, was treated with all
respect.</p>
<p>Three months later, Lieutenant-Governor Collins died. Though
not a great ruler, he was popular for his private qualities. His
task was one of no ordinary difficulty&mdash;to lay the
foundations of a prosperous community with a very doubtful
collection of materials. The famine which lasted during half his
term of office severely handicapped his efforts, and he cannot be
accused of responsibility for it, nor of any lack of ordinary
prudence.</p>
<p>For some time after Collins' death, the settlement was
administered by temporary officials, who did not venture upon any
definite policy. During the interregnum, however, the colony
received a visit from the new Governor-in-chief, Macquarie, under
whose supervision the Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania long
continued to act. Governor Macquarie landed in November 1811, and
his visit is important, for it practically determined the
immediate future of the colony. He was full of zeal and energy.
He laid out roads, planned public buildings, projected townships,
named rivers and mountains, and infused into the community some
ambition for material progress, as well as some kind of social
order. The first Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania had been little
given to outward display; but Macquarie exacted a good deal of
ceremony, and his bent, in the circumstances of the time, was
decidedly influential for good.</p>
<p>At last, at the beginning of the year 1813, a new
Lieutenant-Governor arrived from England, in the person of
Lieutenant-Colonel Davey, of the Royal Marines. Davey seems to
have treated his office more or less as a joke. He was totally
without ceremony, and would drink and jest with any one. He had
hoped to escape the restraints of matrimony by accepting the
post; but his wife was too alert, and managed to reach his ship
just as it was starting. His activity was mainly confined to the
repression of bushranging; but even here his methods were such as
to excite surprise. Annoyed by the repeated successes of the
outlaws, he put the whole island under martial law, and forbade
any one, free or bond, to leave his house after nightfall without
permission, enforcing his prohibition by flogging. This step,
equally absurd and useless, was severely censured by the Governor
at Sydney.</p>
<p>What little progress was made in Davey's time was due to
private enterprise. Regular houses of business were established.
In the year 1815 the colony began to export wheat to Sydney, in
the following year it also sent salt meat. By the close of 1820
the value of exports in these articles reached &pound;33,000.
Some exploration of the western coast was undertaken, and
Macquarie Harbour and Port Davey discovered. The whale fishery
was developed. Churches began to appear. A newspaper was
successfully established in 1816. When Colonel Davey was
displaced, in 1817, the population of the colony was just over
three thousand, and about the same number of acres were returned
as being in cultivation. Sheep-breeding and cattle-rearing were
yet to come.</p>
<p>Colonel Davey was succeeded as Lieutenant-Governor by William
Sorell, who at once proved his capacity by substantially checking
the progress of bushranging. Not less important to the colony was
the arrival of free immigrants, who now began to come in large
numbers. To tempt them to leave their native country, the
Tasmanian Government offered free grants of land, rations for six
months, the loan of stock and seed, and, above all, a fixed price
for all wheat and beef which they could produce. Sorell explored
new regions for the convenience of the immigrants, amongst others
the country about the lake which still bears his name. Encouraged
by these efforts, and by the advocacy of writers in the English
press, immigrants arrived in large numbers, so many as six
hundred in one year. By the end of 1821 the population had risen
to 7,400.</p>
<p>The rate of material progress was, naturally, much more rapid
after the arrival of the free settlers than it had been before.
Though many sank discouraged before the difficulties of
colonization, others were sensible enough to see their
opportunity, and soon attained comfort, if not wealth. In the
year 1821 the number of acres in cultivation was returned at
upwards of fourteen thousand. In 1819 the colony began to export
wool on a small scale, but the experiment was at first
unsuccessful. In 1820, however, Colonel Paterson induced
Macarthur, of Sydney, to ship him a selection from his famous
flocks, and the naturalization was successfully accomplished. In
the year 1821 the number of sheep in the island was returned at
upwards of 180,000. In the following year 794 bales of wool were
exported, and although for some years more the statistics do not
survive, the wool industry clearly became the backbone of the
colony. It spread the fame of Tasmanian pastures in the old
world, brought strange ships to her ports, now no longer (except
in a few cases) closed to commerce, and gradually substituted
steady enterprise for speculation in rum. When Governor Macquarie
paid his farewell visit to the island, in the year 1821, he was
justifiably astonished at the change which had taken place since
his former appearance. Then there was a colony to make; now it
was made. Lieutenant-Governor Sorell retired in 1823, to the
general regret of the inhabitants, who petitioned the Home
Government against his removal.</p>
<p>He was succeeded by a man whose long period of office is a
vital epoch in the history of the colony. The mere appointment of
such a distinguished officer as Colonel Arthur, who had already
earned the marked confidence of the Home Government as
administrator of British Honduras, was sufficient to show that
the Secretary of State intended to raise the position of Tasmania
in the colonial world, and to treat her as a possession of
importance. And, although Arthur's government provoked great
opposition and bitter criticism in the colony, his subsequent
brilliant career (unaided by interest) should make us pause
before accepting the popular view. In truth there is a very
simple explanation of the apparent difficulty, that a Governor of
high character and first-rate ability, devoted to what he deemed
to be the interests of the colony, should have been continually
at feud with his subjects. The fact is that they were opposed to
him on a fundamental question of policy.</p>
<p>The great increase of free settlers caused by the immigration
under Governor Sorell, uniting with the indignation provoked by
the outrages of the bushrangers, led to the first manifestations
of hostility to the convict system. The colony of Tasmania, of
course, felt the evils of that system to the full; for it was the
receptacle of the doubly convicted. In spite, therefore, of the
scarcity of labour which the abolition of transportation would
entail, even in spite of the failure of the system of pauper
emigration which was tried in the thirties, the free settlers
gradually drew together into a compact opposition to the convict
system. In the year 1835 the first formal petition against it was
sent to the Home Government, but the feeling had been growing for
several years.</p>
<p>Arthur, on the other hand, was pledged to the convict system.
He took the view of Macquarie, that the Australian colonies were
founded for the ultimate regeneration of criminals and for the
benefit of their descendants, and, while he did not share
Macquarie's optimistic hopes regarding the effects of mild
treatment, he never lost sight of the great object of
reclamation. Accordingly, he looked upon the free immigrants
rather as a means to an end, than as the desirable settlers for
whose benefit alone the island was to be administered.</p>
<p>The settlement at Macquarie Harbour, on the west coast, had
been established in the year 1821, shortly after the exploration,
with a view to provide a secure prison for those incorrigible
offenders who could be trusted neither as assigned servants nor
as labourers in the Government gangs. The stories of this place,
as well as of its still more notorious successor, Port Arthur,
are horrible. No doubt many of them are exaggerated; but the
testimony of independent witnesses is sufficient to show that
everything depended on the character of the commandant, and that,
if he were cruel or indifferent, the wretched prisoners were in a
hopeless position. It was, in fact, intended that the place
should serve as a deterrent. It was presumed to be absolutely
inaccessible by land, and the sea voyage was dangerous and
wearisome. From the moment of their landing, the prisoners were
kept to the most exhausting labour, while their food was reduced
to the lowest amount consistent with life. There was no pretence
of comfort in the huts the men were not sent there to be
comfortable and the possession of such minor treasures as a fish
hook or an inch of tobacco was a penal offence. It was, in fact,
an attempt to deprive human beings of the advantages of savagery
and civilization alike. Many of the prisoners, reduced to
despair, deliberately threw away their lives; a few escaped, to
perish in the trackless forests.</p>
<p>The occurrence of an outbreak at Macquarie Harbour in 1824
drew the new Governor's attention to its dangers. After
suppressing the revolt with severity, Arthur came to the
conclusion that the attempt to dehumanize the wretched prisoners
was both foolish and cruel, and he gave orders for the
introduction of new pursuits, including the cultivation of the
soil. Moreover, he induced a Wesleyan missionary, Mr Schofield,
to the latter's immortal honour, to enter upon the forbidding
task of ministering to the wretched community; and the result of
his labours entirely justified the Governor's hopes. When Messrs
Backhouse and Walker, of the Society of Friends, visited the
settlement during their missionary tour in the colonies, a few
years later, they found much indeed to condemn, but Macquarie
Harbour was no longer simply a place of despair.</p>
<p>In the year 1832, the growth of free settlement in the west of
Tasmania rendered it necessary to abandon Macquarie Harbour as a
penal station. A substitute was found in Port Arthur, a harbour
on a promontory of the south-eastern coast, whose natural
position appeared to mark it out as an ideal place for an
isolated prison. Tasman Peninsula, on which Port Arthur is
situated, is united only by a narrow neck of land with
Forrestier's Peninsula, which again is joined to the mainland
only by a second narrow ridge; so that any prisoner who succeeded
in passing the first neck would find himself again hemmed in on a
small tract of land almost entirely surrounded by a stormy sea.
But very few did pass the first barrier; for it was guarded night
and day by fierce dogs, and lamps were kept constantly burning.
At Port Arthur the system of punishment was reduced to an exact
science. Severe manual labour was demanded of the prisoner whose
chief characteristic was brutal strength; the convict who had
fallen through abuse of mental powers was put to lighter work,
but deprived of every opportunity of exercising his abused
faculties. The rule was avowedly one of terror, but it was, on
the whole, steady and just; and the officials were often of a
class superior to those who ruled the labour gangs elsewhere.
There were a church and schools; and the celebrated establishment
at Point Puer was an attempt, not wholly unsuccessful, to reform
juvenile convicts whose characters had not become too hardened
for repentance.</p>
<p>Governor Arthur's period of office was also remarkable for an
open war against the aborigines. The history of the Tasmanian
aboriginal is a sad one. In many respects superior to his brother
on the mainland, he was still less able to harmonize with the
advance of European settlement. The very fact that he the more
readily made acquaintances among the white men proved to be his
ruin; for he the more readily acquired the white man's vices,
and, having but a comparatively limited area to range over, he
could not withdraw himself so easily from contact. The early
relationships of the colonists and the aborigines exhibit the
usual unhappy features of cruelty, revenge, treachery, and
dissoluteness. When they were kindly treated, the savages were
friendly; but they naturally failed to distinguish between one
white man and another, and when a tribe had been cruelly used by
a party of settlers, it took the first opportunity of revenging
itself. The colonists would, perhaps also naturally, attribute
this attack to spontaneous treachery; and thus a determined
feeling of antagonism grew up between the races.</p>
<p>This feeling culminated in the year 1830, when the official
list of outrages shows that scarcely a week passed without loss
of life amongst the Europeans. The reprisals or provocations
suffered by the blacks are not given, but are admitted by candid
historians to have been considerable. The Governor at first
endeavoured to attract the savages into his power by promises of
good treatment, and then to settle them peaceably on a reserve
which should not be visited by white men. As might have been
expected, the results of the policy were small. Those who were
induced to come in either resented the restraint upon their
liberty and escaped, or pined away in captivity and had to be
released to save their lives.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year 1830, a bolder policy was
attempted. The Governor called upon all the active inhabitants of
the colony to assist him in drawing a complete cordon across the
east country, and thus forcibly to sweep the district, driving
the blacks into Tasman Peninsula, where they might easily be
confined (much as the convicts were two years later). The whole
island at first responded with enthusiasm, and the colony became
one vast military camp. But the movement was too difficult to be
executed by inexperienced hands. To sweep an indefinite tract of
country, much of it unexplored and covered with dense forests,
and to keep a line several hundred miles in length so exactly
that naked savages, possessing all the advantages of woodcraft,
should not be able to break through, was beyond Arthur's powers.
After a campaign of two months, the Black War ended in
ignominious failure, attributed by some to the treachery of
escaped convicts, by others to specific mistakes, but really due
to the hopelessness of the task. Only two of the aborigines were
captured, after an expenditure of &pound;30,000. Oddly enough,
the one good effect of the campaign appears to have been to raise
the tone of the convicts who had been allowed to take part in it.
For the first time they seem to have felt themselves identified
with the safety of the community by which they were
surrounded.</p>
<p>Within three or four years the intelligent efforts of a single
man, aided at first by the scantiest resources, safely
accomplished what the campaign of 1830 had failed to secure Mr
Robinson was already in the service of the Government at a very
small salary, as superintendent of a small aboriginal settlement
on one of the Bruni islands. He offered to persuade the
aborigines of the mainland to consent to voluntary expatriation
to one of the numerous islands of the coast. He was looked upon
as a visionary; but it is to Arthur's credit that he was not
obstructed. Taking with him two or three of the aborigines from
the Bruni islands, he boldly penetrated into any part of the
country in which he believed the blacks to be numerous. The
presence of his companions attracted the savages, many of whom
hoped to find lost relatives amongst them. When the strangers
appeared, Robinson, who had mastered the Tasmanian dialects,
boldly approached them, and endeavoured to persuade them to
accompany him. The blacks were probably not unfamiliar with the
presence of stray white men who had escaped from the rigours of
the law, and made little objection to his approach. Strange to
say, he was successful in his attempts, though, towards the end
of his mission, he had sometimes to use force to effect a
capture, without, of course, inflicting bodily injury. He
encountered many dangers, but the result of his labours was that
by the year 1835 about 200 aborigines had been captured, and
these, or rather the survivors, for many died soon after capture,
were established on Flinders' Island, at the eastern entrance to
Bass' Strait. Although it is pretty certain that the captives did
not include the whole of the aborigines at large, the effect of
the removal was practically to do away with the dangers to which
the colony had been exposed. The success of the achievement, so
far as regards the aborigines themselves, was not so marked. The
little community on Flinders' Island dwindled rapidly; and, on
the founding of Port Phillip, Robinson was allowed to remove many
of them to the new colony with what object is not quite clear.
Here many perished from violence and vice. The remainder were
ultimately allowed to return to the colony, and were settled
about Oyster Bay, the scene of their former lives. But it was too
late to save them, and they rapidly disappeared. The race is now
totally extinct.</p>
<p>It was during Arthur's term of office, too, that the
operations of the Van Diemen's Land Company commenced. The
company had obtained in England a grant of 250,000 acres, upon
condition of selecting them in one block on the north-west coast.
It was to pay a small quit rent of &pound;468 a year; but this
might be redeemed at twenty years' purchase, or reduced by the
employment of convict labour. When the company's agent arrived,
there was considerable friction about the choice of land; for the
Governor did not relish the prospect of a great capitalist
association, whose directors might rival the influence of the
Government. Ultimately, the company obtained grants amounting to
considerably over 300,000 acres, but in different parts of the
north. It set to work vigorously, and, no doubt, greatly
forwarded the developement of the colony by the settlers whom it
introduced, and the flocks which it imported. But the state of
the labour market rendered any prospect of political influence
visionary. The company's servants, tempted by the superior
attractions of independent settlement or of life in the towns,
left it soon after landing; and it was some time before its
operations became profitable. Other large grants were made to the
Van Diemen's Land Establishment, in the Norfolk Plains District;
but the history of the great land companies of Australia shows
that they have entirely failed to compete with individual
enterprise in the work of colonization.</p>
<p>Governor Arthur retired from office in 1836. His reign had not
been free from friction, mainly for the reason before stated. He
had trouble with the Press, much as his contemporary, Sir Ralph
Darling, had in New South Wales. He was accused of nepotism and
the use of unworthy agents&mdash;the fact being that a close
system of devoted officials was essential to the success of his
schemes. But it is clear that, under his rule, the colony had
made substantial progress. It had ceased to be dependent on New
South Wales, its constitution had been enlarged, banks had been
founded, the press, in spite of difficulties, had increased in
numbers and influence, bushranging had been put down, the
aboriginal question settled. When Arthur arrived in the colony,
the population was just over 10,000; when he left it, this number
had been quadrupled. The traffic at the ports had trebled itself,
the exports had increased from &pound;25,000 to upwards of half a
million sterling, though the cost of government was less than
three times what it had been when he arrived. The amount of land
in cultivation had been quadrupled; the number of sheep had risen
to nearly a million head. There were twenty-nine schools in the
colony, and eighteen places of worship. Above all, colonists from
Tasmania had just founded the new settlement of Port Phillip,
whose rising fortunes were in the future to prove of such
importance to the neighbouring island. To Colonel Arthur
succeeded a man whose name is a household word amongst Englishmen
and Australians alike-Sir John Franklin, the hero of the
north-west passage, the future commander of the ill-fated
<i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i>, was received with the warmest
welcome in the island. His talents were rather scientific than
administrative, and he seems never to have thoroughly grasped the
complicated conditions of Tasmanian society. Hence his
administration was not altogether a success, although his
personal popularity was indisputable. He unfortunately became
involved in the difficult question of ecclesiastical rivalries,
and, though an eminently religious man, was inevitably subjected
to criticism and reproach. The later years of his government were
embarrassed by the severe period of commercial depression which
affected all the Australian colonies, but none more than
Tasmania. Finally, he became involved in a quarrel with the
Tasmanian Colonial Secretary, and, though he was maintained in
the exercise of his authority by the Home Government, he retired
from office under circumstances which left it open to his
adversaries to say that he was practically dismissed.</p>
<p>But, whatever his reputation as an administrator, Franklin
conferred on the colony lasting distinction as the scene of
scientific research. He encouraged every visitor who came with
the object of extending knowledge. Sir Joseph Hooker, in the year
1840, obtained, by personal investigation, the materials for his
great work, <i>The Flora of Tasmania</i>. The ambitious explorer
and naturalist Strzelecki received in Tasmania the warmest help
and encouragement. Charles Darwin, in the <i>Beagle</i>, spent
many months in the investigation of the coasts and rivers of the
colony. Jukes, the geologist, and Richardson, the naturalist,
also made this period famous by their researches. Franklin
himself founded what is now the Royal Society of Tasmania, then
known as the Tasmanian Society, and its earliest meetings were
held at Government House. Moreover, he entered into
correspondence with the famous Dr Arnold of Rugby, with a view to
the establishment of elementary education on a sound basis, and a
provision for higher education. As a result, one of Dr Arnold's
nephews was appointed Inspector of Schools in the colony, and one
of his favourite pupils head master of the first higher grade
school. The period of Sir John Franklin's government is the
golden age of learning in Tasmania.</p>
<p>The short and troubled reign of his successor, Sir Eardley
Wilmot, contains little of permanent interest, but it is marked
by the revival, this time destined to be successful, of the
feeling against transportation. The policy of the Home Government
had been vacillating. More than once the system had been
threatened with abolition; but in the early forties it was
suddenly developed to an alarming extent under the auspices of
Lord Stanley. The discontinuance of transportation to New South
Wales rendered the pressure on Tasmania all the greater, and the
removal of convicts from Norfolk Island to Port Arthur excited
genuine alarm. The Governor and the Legislative Council came to
an open rupture, and, though the Home Government refused at the
time to discontinue the practice of transportation, it
endeavoured to pacify the opposition by a large annual grant
towards the maintenance of the convict establishment, which had
been thrown on the colonial treasury in 1836.</p>
<p>Before the difficulties occasioned by this struggle could be
removed, Sir Eardley Wilmot was deprived of office by Mr
Gladstone. It is generally understood that accusations of private
immorality had been made against him, and that these were
informally intimated to him as the real reason for his dismissal.
The Governor at once denied the accusations, and requested a
public investigation. His protest was backed up by many who had
been his active opponents in political matters in the colony. But
no investigation was granted, and it is the general view that the
Governor was sacrificed for having acquiesced in Lord Stanley's
unpopular views on the convict system. Believing himself bound to
carry out the Minister's policy, even against his own private
beliefs, he had ceased to remonstrate upon the obvious mistakes
of the Administration, thereby provoking intense opposition in
the colony at the same time that he encouraged the Home
Government to persist in its plans. After his retirement, it was
found that the colony was taxed beyond all reason for the
maintenance of convicts whose labour had ceased to be of any
public value; and, after three more years of strenuous agitation,
which perhaps did more than anything else to weld the community
into a compact whole, the obnoxious system of transportation,
having been already discontinued in nearly all the other
colonies, was finally abolished for Van Diemen's Land, which
received thereupon the new name of Tasmania. This event took
place in the year 1853, in the governorship of Sir William
Denison, Sir Eardley Wilmot's successor.</p>

<h3>2. <i>Victoria.</i> (<i>Port Phillip.</i>)</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> colony of Victoria might, with some
justice, be spoken of as a grand-daughter, rather than as a
daughter, of New South Wales. For, as we shall see, there can be
little doubt that the final impulse which led to its formation
came from Tasmania, more than from the older colony; and there
was at one time even a proposal that it should be governed from
Hobart. But, ultimately, the infant settlement was placed under
the tutelage of New South Wales.</p>
<p>We have already seen that the expedition which founded
Tasmania was originally destined for Port Phillip. The
explorations of Flinders and Bass, and the knowledge that a
scanty population of whalers had for some years maintained
themselves on the islands and bays of the Strait, drew public
attention to the southern coast of Australia at the close of the
eighteenth century. The expedition of 1803 was the result; and
for a few months a detachment of convicts under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Collins inhabited the shores of Port Phillip
Bay. But, as we have also seen, after correspondence both with
London and Sydney, Colonel Collins broke up the camp (for it was
nothing more), and sailed for the Derwent. The name of Sullivan
Bay, at the head of which the Port Phillip camp was pitched,
survives in the Sullivan Cove of Hobart, and makes one link
between the two colonies.</p>
<p>For twenty years more, Port Phillip was undisturbed by
attempts at settlement. But in 1824 Mr Hamilton Hume, an
enterprising native of Parramatta, accompanied by Captain Hovell,
made an overland journey from Sydney to the south coast, and
finally reached the shores of Port Phillip at Corio Bay, an inlet
on the western curve, near to which stands the present town of
Geelong. There was considerable difference of opinion between the
travellers as to the exact site of their discovery, but both
agreed on the advantages of the place from the point of view of
settlement. Moreover there were (as usual) rumours of French
expeditions.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Sir Ralph Darling, the then Governor of New South
Wales, resolved to make a second attempt at a settlement, partly
with a view to relieve the pressure on Sydney, partly to ward off
the expected visits of the French. In the year 1825, a party of
convicts under Captain Wright was despatched to Port Phillip, but
effected a landing instead on Phillip Island, at the entrance of
Westernport, a bay a few miles east of Port Phillip. Here the
party established a temporary settlement, known as Fort Dumaresq;
but, tempted by the appearance of the mainland on the eastern
shore of Westernport, they speedily removed thither. At first the
prospects seemed excellent, and the commandant wrote in high
spirits. But the scarcity of fresh water soon proved a serious
drawback, and, in spite of the protest of Hovell, who believed
that Westernport was the fertile spot which he had reached on his
former expedition, the Government at Sydney decided to abandon
the settlement, and its decision was approved by the Colonial
Office. At the beginning of the year 1828, the settlers were
fetched back to Sydney, the live stock of the settlement being
transferred to the little colony at Port Dalrymple, in Tasmania,
where it was cordially welcomed.</p>
<p>The expedition which is usually, though not, perhaps, quite
justly, considered as the founding of Victoria, was a purely
individual speculation, conducted by the Messrs Henty, in the
year 1834. As has been before pointed out, the Strait had been
for years familiar to whalers as a profitable hunting ground, and
some of the men engaged in the industry, instead of returning to
civilization between the seasons, built themselves huts on some
island or promontory, where they lived in a state of
semi-savagery. Several of these huts had been found by the
settlers at Westernport, one or two of them surrounded by gardens
and other evidences of permanent occupation. But, in the main,
the whalers were mere outlaws, who would never have developed
into a settled community.</p>
<p>The Henty family was of an entirely different stamp, being of
good Kentish blood and substantial property. The father and his
seven sons had been seized with the true emigrant spirit, the
desire for broad lands and free air. They had sold their English
property and joined the ill-fated expedition to the Swan River
(Western Australia) in 1829. Having lost the bulk of their
fortune in the disastrous early years of Western Australia, they
migrated to Tasmania, hoping to obtain a free grant of land in
the neighbourhood of Launceston. They were colonists of the most
desirable type, having skill and perseverance, as well as
honourable traditions.</p>
<p>But, on reaching Launceston, they found that the free grants
of land had been put an end to by the Regulations of 1831, and,
moreover, that the colony of Tasmania was already too crowded to
permit of operations on the scale they hoped for. Accordingly,
they at once turned their attention elsewhere, and, in the year
1834, started a whaling establishment at Portland Bay, which they
worked in connection with sheep farming and agriculture. The
settlement was at first totally unauthorized either by the
Colonial or Home Governments, and when Mr Henty tried to obtain a
legal guarantee of possession, he was sternly refused. As a
matter of fact, outlying settlements such as his caused the
authorities considerable trouble. To extend to them the apparatus
of government would entail an expense quite out of proportion to
the immediate advantage. To leave them absolutely alone would be
to incur odium and, possibly, to give the French an excuse for
denying the existence of a British title. However, after some
delay, the Secretary of State, at the beginning of the year 1835,
gave an informal permission to the settlement to continue, with a
vague promise of compensation for disturbance should the
territory ever be incorporated in a settled colony. The promise
came in for redemption with unpleasant promptitude, and,
ultimately, in the year 1846, the Messrs Henty received a grant
of land, in or near the town of Portland, then worth about
&pound;2,000, now, of course, of considerably greater value.</p>
<p>The reason why the Henty settlement, though ultimately
recognized, and though unquestionably within the area of the
present colony of Victoria, cannot be considered as the true
founding of the colony, is that it did not spread, but was itself
absorbed in another settlement, which commenced in the following
year, and was formally adopted by Government as the nucleus of a
colony.</p>
<p>This was the settlement of a number of Tasmanians, who bound
themselves together as the Port Phillip Association. Their leader
was John Batman, like Hamilton Hume a native of Parramatta, near
Sydney, and, like him, long a believer in the existence of fine
land on the south coast of New South Wales. In the year 1821 he
left Sydney and settled at Kingston, in Tasmania, where he
speedily became popular for his pleasant manners and love of
adventure. In 1827 he had applied for leave to join the
settlement at Westernport, and had been refused. After the
successful establishment of the Hentys at Portland Bay, he could
no longer be held back, and, in May of the year 1835, he landed
at Port Phillip as the leader of an exploring expedition. There
was at this time no regular partnership between the adventurers
who had combined to form the Port Phillip Association; but a
regular deed of partnership was executed after Batman's return to
Tasmania. Batman's great idea was to open a friendly intercourse
with the aborigines, and to get from them a grant of land, on the
model of William Penn's treaty with the Indians. In this scheme
he was abundantly successful, for, on the 6th June, 1835, he
obtained from a few savages, who stated themselves to be chiefs
of the country, grants of two tracts of land, one the present
site of Melbourne, the other near Geelong, amounting by his own
estimation to about 600,000 acres of the finest pastoral land in
Australia. The price paid for this magnificent purchase consisted
of a few knives, looking-glasses, and blankets, and the promise
of a yearly rent of similar articles, estimated in value at about
&pound;200. The deeds (which still survive) are drawn up in
English legal form, and the "marks" of the chiefs are affixed.
Had they been entered into by English subjects, they would
undoubtedly have effected their object, that is, if the granting
parties had really been owners of the lands. But that is a very
large reservation; for there is no evidence to show that the
aborigines understood the meaning either of land ownership or
writing. They wanted the trinkets, and naturally did anything
they were asked in order to secure them. They would probably have
sold the same lands over again the next day, had the opportunity
presented itself; and this without a thought of fraud.
Nevertheless, Batman proceeded with all solemnity to make copies
of his deeds, two of which he handed over to the aborigines, who
must have been additionally pleased with this mark of confidence
and generosity.</p>
<p>Batman made his original settlement on the Geelong land at a
promontory which he called "Indented Head", near Corio Bay. This
fact accounts for the claim of Geelong to be considered as the
mother town of Victoria. It also accounts for the fact that a
subsequent expedition, with which a Mr Fawkner of Launceston was
connected, and which reached Port Phillip in August of the same
year 1835, believed itself to be the real founder of the colony.
Fawkner, who had previously been at Port Phillip (probably in
Collins' expedition of 1803) seems not to have accompanied the
new explorers on their journey in the <i>Enterprise</i>; and his
claim to leadership has been stoutly denied by members of the
party, which proceeded up the Yarra river, and effected a landing
on the present site of Melbourne. Seeing no signs of settlement,
they believed themselves to be first in the field, but Batman's
followers from Indented Head put in a rival claim, alleging that
the spot (forming part of the district known as "Dutigalla") was
covered by the grant made to them by the aborigines. Hence arose
a dispute which lasted for a long time, and involved many obscure
points. The truth appears to be that Batman and Fawkner (who soon
arrived, and by his energy and enterprise undoubtedly did much to
forward the settlement) are jointly entitled to the credit of
founding the colony. Curiously enough, they represented very
clearly the two rival interests of the time. Batman was a
squatter who believed in sheep breeding on a great scale. Fawkner
was a trader, and advocated small agriculture and industrial
enterprise.</p>
<p>Of course the so-called treaty with the aborigines was not
allowed to stand. Some money was spent, and some very unsound
constitutional law ventilated over the question; but when the
Association laid the papers before its own counsel in England,
their advice was unanimous against the validity of the grants.
Three out of the four counsel took the simple and obvious ground
that the Crown claimed title to the land included in the grants,
and that, therefore, no arrangement made without its approval
could bind it. The fourth counsel (Dr Lushington) was of opinion
that the land was not vested in the Crown, but that the grants
still conveyed no title to the purchasers. The reasons for this
rather peculiar view are not stated, but it is clear that the
Association's case was hopeless. Either Port Phillip was in
British territory or it was not. If it was, the aborigines could
make no title without the consent of the Crown; if it was not,
the settlers would have no claim to British protection might
indeed be treated as political enemies. After a short struggle,
the settlers gave up the question, and threw themselves on the
generosity of the Government. Ultimately, the surviving members
of the Association were allowed &pound;7,000 on the purchase of
land, by way of compensation and reward. The Association itself
was dissolved in the year 1836, and had no influence upon the
future of the colony.</p>
<p>The next question for the Home Government was whether it
should allow the settlement to proceed, or peremptorily warn off
intending colonists. The dislike of incurring the responsibility
and expense of a new colony, and the unwillingness to allow a
rival so comparatively near the newly founded settlement of South
Australia pleaded strongly in favour of non-recognition. But the
question soon settled itself by the logic of facts. It was
impossible to keep settlers off the inviting pastures. In the
early part of the year 1836 many more Tasmanian speculators
appeared; and when in the autumn of the same year (spring in
Australia) Major Mitchell published in Sydney his glowing account
of his recent overland expedition to Australia Felix, the stream
set in fast and strong from New South Wales proper. The
settlement at Port Phillip was an accomplished fact, and
Government had to recognize it. There were some indications,
indeed, that if the authorities should delay much longer, the
settlers would take the matter out of their hands. But at present
the new colony was anxious for official recognition.</p>
<p>On the 26th August 1835, Governor Bourke of New South Wales
had issued a proclamation by which he claimed Port Phillip as
part of the territory comprised within the limits of his
commission, and warned all persons against trespassing upon Crown
lands. This express claim was important in one respect; for it
shewed that the new colony was to be governed from Sydney, not
from Hobart, as Colonel Arthur, and, perhaps, some of the
colonists from Tasmania, had hoped. But it did not do much
towards organizing the colony; and, in fact, for more than a year
after it the settlers lived in patriarchal simplicity, each being
a law unto himself. But in September 1836, having in the
meanwhile received an official report as to the character of the
settlement, Governor Bourke proceeded formally to proclaim it as
open for colonization, and to appoint Captain William Lonsdale as
resident police magistrate. At the time when the report was drawn
up (June 1836) the colony consisted of 177 white persons, who
claimed to occupy about 100 square miles of land, and who owned
about 26,000 sheep, with a few horses and cattle. Already eleven
small vessels were regularly engaged in the trade between
Tasmania and the new settlement.</p>
<p>On the 1st October 1836 the new police magistrate arrived with
his establishment. The latter consisted of three surveyors, a
lieutenant and thirty soldiers, and a couple of constables. From
this tiny germ has sprung the present Government of Victoria.
Institutions began rapidly to develope. Before the close of 1836
there was a public gaol. In the year 1837 Governor Bourke visited
the settlement and laid out the sites of Melbourne (the Fawkner
settlement, hitherto known as "Bearbrass") and Williamstown (the
port of Melbourne); in September of the same year a police
magistrate and constables were appointed for the Batman
settlement at Corio Bay, thenceforward known as Geelong; in 1838
Quarter Sessions were proclaimed at Melbourne, and in 1840 the
town of Portland was laid out. Before 1840, however, important
events had happened.</p>
<p>One of these was the first sale of land in the colony. Though
it had ceased to treat the settlers as <i>de facto</i>
trespassers, the Government had always declined to recognize any
titles. One of Captain Lonsdale's earliest difficulties had been
to prevent settlers building huts on any spots that pleased their
fancy. He knew that such achievements would be made the basis of
future claims, and he therefore hastened to open a regular market
for the sale of land. The first sale in the colony took place at
Melbourne in June 1837; and comprised half-acre lots in Melbourne
and Williamstown. Of Melbourne lots about 100 were sold. The
highest price reached was &pound;95, the average &pound;35. Only
seven Williamstown lots were knocked down, but they averaged
&pound;46 apiece. In November another sale of Melbourne lots took
place; but &pound;100 was the highest price realized. Land in
similar positions has since sold (even before "boom" times) at
&pound;600 per foot frontage. There was a sale at Geelong in
1839, and at Portland in 1840.</p>
<p>But meanwhile the colony had advanced a distinct step in its
political organization. It was soon found that the simple
machinery of a police magistrate and constables was insufficient
for the wants of the community. It was necessary to do something
more than keep the peace. Accordingly, in July 1839, Mr Charles
Joseph Latrobe, who had been sent out from England for the
purpose, was gazetted "Superintendent of Port Phillip". The title
was an unfortunate one, for it obviously recalled the convict
system. But its adoption was probably due to a desire not to
commit the Government to an implied promise of separation from
the mother colony, rather than to any wish to limit Mr Latrobe's
powers; for it was provided that, within the limits of his
district, the Superintendent should exercise the powers of a
Lieutenant-Governor. His district, it should be observed, was not
by any means co-extensive with the present colony of Victoria.
From Yarrawonga on the north to Cape Liptrap on the south all
east of such a line was excluded, probably with a view to keep
clear of the little settlement at Twofold Bay. An under-treasurer
and a clerk of the peace were added to the official staff in the
same year 1839, and a Court of Requests for small civil cases
established, to obviate the necessity of long journeys to Sydney.
In the following year (1840) Melbourne was divided into two
districts of north and south, and in 1842 the capital of the
colony received its municipal charter. In the year 1840 Melbourne
had also been proclaimed a free port. The proclamation of the
Port Phillip Pastoral District in the year 1839 brought the
colony within the provisions of the new squatting scheme of the
mother-colony, and the subdivision of the District in 1840 (into
the Westernport and Portland Bay Districts) and again in 1842 (by
the creation of Gippsland and the Murray) is evidence of the
rapid growth of pastoral interests, and the opening up of new
territory.</p>
<p>The peaceful and prosperous period which followed on the
organization of the colony, and which lasted until the great
events of 1850-1, leaves little in the way of history to record.
Almost the only landmarks are the inland discoveries which added
more grazing land to the pastures of Port Phillip, the rather
heated discussion over the land laws, and the progress of the
struggle for separation from the mother-colony. The first of
these movements is described elsewhere; here it is sufficient to
say that the practical revelation of the fine district of
Gippsland, though its existence was suspected long before, was
made in the year 1841, partly by exploration from the north, and
partly by the extension of sheep stations in the south; that the
overland journey from Sydney gradually opened up new country,
often spoken of as the Omeo District, to the north-east of Port
Phillip; and, finally, that by the year 1846 the Wimmera District
in the north-west had become partially occupied.</p>
<p>The land question deserves a more detailed notice. The first
sales of land in Victoria took place under the Colonial Office
Regulations of 1831 (Lord Ripon's), alluded to above (p. 62), and
were conducted by auction with a small reserve. But this practice
did not suit the views of the newly appointed Colonial Land and
Emigration Commissioners, who had a special interest in the
neighbouring colony of South Australia, where the Crown lands
were not disposed of by public competition, but by allotment at
the fixed price of &pound;1 an acre. The founders of South
Australia attached great importance to the maintenance of this
principle, and they naturally feared that if it became known that
land could be obtained at five shillings an acre (the reserve
price) at Port Phillip, many of the South Australian colonists
would be tempted across the border. There was little fear of land
in Melbourne or Geelong selling at so low a figure as five
shillings an acre; but country land might conceivably fetch no
more at an auction.</p>
<p>So the Commissioners recommended that, except in towns where
the practice of sale by auction had already been established,
land sales in the Port Phillip District should for the future be
conducted on the fixed price system, while at the same time the
reserve in New South Wales proper should be raised to twelve
shillings an acre.</p>
<p>These recommendations were duly acted upon, and they produced
the important Land Regulations of 1840, which did far more than
change the method of disposal of Crown lands. By splitting up the
old territory of New South Wales into three Land Districts (which
must not be confused with the temporary Pastoral Districts), and
by treating the proceeds of land sales in each as a separate
fund, they clearly foreshadowed the separation both of Victoria
and Queensland from the mother-colony. More than that, they
considerably enlarged the limits of the first named colony by
making the Murray and the Murrumbidgee its northern boundary,
thus prolonging its territory eastward to the coast, and
including in it the fine province of Gippsland. These boundaries
were not secured in their completeness on the actual separation
of the colony; but they had a substantial effect on the final
settlement of the boundaries of Victoria.</p>
<p>So disastrous, however, did the tendency of the Regulations
appear to Governor Gipps to be, that he took the strong step of
practically nullifying them in Port Phillip. The Regulations
authorized the continuance of the auction system at Melbourne,
Williamstown, Geelong, and Portland. So far good. They also named
&pound;100 an acre as the fixed price at which land in other new
<i>towns</i> might be disposed of. At present there was not much
harm in such a rule, except that it would materially check the
settlement of new towns. But the Regulations sanctioned the
disposal of all other land in Port Phillip District at the fixed
price of &pound;1 an acre, without competition, to all applicants
in order of application. To Sir George Gipps this looked like
mere madness, the result of ignorance of local conditions. The
Commissioners seemed to have forgotten that, especially in an
expanding community, land just outside a definite circle may be
worth almost as much as land just within it; and Sir George Gipps
calculated that an adoption of the Regulations in the
neighbourhood of Melbourne and Geelong alone would involve the
Crown in a loss (for so it seemed to him) of nearly one million
sterling, even at existing prices. The truth of his estimate is
strikingly exemplified by the case of Mr Henry Dendy, who arrived
in the colony at the close of the year 1840. This gentleman had
bought from the Commissioners in London eight square miles of
Port Phillip land at &pound;1 an acre, and, armed with his
certificate of purchase, claimed the right to select his
territory anywhere outside the actual limits of Melbourne. He was
offered &pound;15,000 for his certificate immediately upon his
arrival; and, had he been able to choose his land as he wished,
and retain it to the present day, he would probably now be one of
the wealthiest men in the world, with half suburban Melbourne as
his tenants. As it was, he was "bluffed" in a not very creditable
way by the Government, and it was declared that no more sales of
suburban land would be allowed until further notice.</p>
<p>The short experiment of selling lands at a fixed price was, so
far as Port Phillip was concerned, speedily put an end to by the
vigorous remonstrances of Sir George Gipps, and the Crown Land
Sales Act of 1842 introduced a uniform system of sale of all new
lands by public auction throughout the Australasian colonies. A
criticism of the fixed price plan will be more in place in an
account of the founding of South Australia, where it first made
its appearance.</p>
<p>But it is necessary to say a word about one provision of the
Crown Land Sales Act 1842, which stirred up a terrible storm both
in New South Wales proper and in Port Phillip District, and which
gave the representatives in the new Legislative Council an
opportunity for declamation, which lasted until the discovery of
gold had emphasized the folly of their opposition.</p>
<p>This was the clause which positively forbade the sale of any
Crown land (except in very rare cases) at less than a reserve
price of &pound;1 an acre. This became the text of grievances in
the new Legislative Council at Sydney, which was (as we have
seen) created by the Constitution of 1842, and to which Port
Phillip sent six members. As the clause was contained in an
Imperial statute, nothing short of a similar authority could set
it aside. The whole efforts of the Opposition were therefore
directed towards convincing the Home Government that the reserve
was excessive, and ought to be lowered. Sir George Gipps adhered
manfully to the other view, and refused to support (though of
course he transmitted) the petitions of the colonists. The latter
argued that the land of the colony belonged to the people of the
colony, who alone gave it value, and that the people ought to be
allowed to purchase as much of it as they wished at a reasonable
reserve. The actual reserve suggested by the Council in some
cases went as low as sixpence an acre. They complained that by
the policy of the Government enterprise was starved and expansion
prevented; for they argued (and quite truly) that profitable
pursuits might be carried on upon land which, at that date, was
clearly not worth a pound an acre. To this the Governor replied,
in effect, that to assert the doctrine that the present handful
of settlers had a moral claim to the whole of the land of the
colony was a doctrine which no statesman, in justice to future
generations, could possibly admit. He also pointed out that the
recognition of the practice of squatting completely disposed of
the theory that pursuits which would pay for occupation but not
for purchase were discouraged. And, with regard to the doctrine
of a prohibitive price, he simply pointed to the returns, which
showed that, although in New South Wales proper the sales had
fallen off since 1842, in Port Phillip they had increased
substantially in the years 1845 and 1846. From '47 to '50 the
rise was prodigious, though Governor Gipps did not remain to see
this justification of his policy. The fact was, that, during the
forties, men bought in Port Phillip District rather than in New
South Wales proper.</p>
<p>Never has foresight been more completely justified than that
of Sir George Gipps. Had the colonists been allowed their way,
the generation of 1840 to 1850 would have acquired the whole land
of the colony at nominal prices, and the expanded population of
the next decade would have found itself under a tyranny of
landowners which would probably have led to a revolution. The
Opposition, however, made one point when they said that the
discouragement of speculative purchases gave an opportunity to
the squatters to gain a moral, and, in some cases, a legal title
to the freehold of their runs. This was, undoubtedly, one of the
results of the Crown Lands Leases Act of 1847; but the provisions
from which it sprang were inserted in spite of the express
warnings of Sir George Gipps.</p>
<p>With the year 1842 may be said also to begin the movement in
favour of separation from the mother-colony, which achieved its
success in 1850. The Constitution Act of the former year had made
yet another change in the boundaries of Port Phillip, by
discarding the Murrumbidgee as the boundary of the District, and
substituting for it the more southerly stream of the Murray to
its headwaters in the Australian Alps, and thence by a straight
line to Cape Howe. This change, which was evidently due to the
remonstrances of the Sydney colonists, who objected to losing the
rich Goulbourn District, finally fixed the boundaries of the
colony of Victoria.</p>
<p>Provided thus with a definite territory, the settlers at Port
Phillip, now growing in numbers and wealth, began to feel the
disadvantages of a distant seat of government. The Constitution
of 1842 had nominally given them more power of managing their own
affairs; practically it had placed them largely under the control
of their fellow colonists in Sydney, After a very short
experience it was found that Port Phillip residents could not be
expected to give up their home interests to serve in the
Legislative Council at Sydney; and it became necessary to elect
representatives residing near the seat of government. This
practice virtually left Port Phillip matters in the hands of
Sydney men; and, willing enough as the Port Phillip colonists
might be to be ruled by Imperial statesmen, however distant from
the scene of action, they were not in the least inclined to be
ruled by New South Wales colonists. And yet, the more democratic
the Council at Sydney became, the more nearly was this result
achieved. It is but fair to say that the settlers in Port Phillip
found a bold champion of their views, even among the Sydney
residents; for Dr Lang, a presbyterian minister by calling and an
agitator by predilection, warmly espoused their cause. Moreover
from the very first the settlement at Port Phillip had had its
own treasury, its own land fund, and its own staff of officials.
And in the year 1847 the feeling in favour of separation had been
accentuated by the division of the old bishopric of Australia
into four new sees, one of which was specially constituted for
the Port Phillip District.</p>
<p>Matters came to a crisis in the year 1848. An election to the
Legislative Council took place in July of that year, and the
settlers at Port Phillip determined upon a bold step. Persuading
all the genuine candidates for the District to withdraw their
names, they elected Earl Grey, the Secretary of State for the
colonies, as member for Melbourne, and returned the District
seats as vacant. Of course this was only a feint, and in October
new elections were held, with the result that the vacancies for
the District were filled. But the step had its effect on the
Colonial Office, and when, in the year 1849, the Board of Trade
formally recommended the Ministry of the day to accede to the
request for separation, the Ministry at once acquiesced, and the
long-desired provision was inserted in the Constitution Act of
1850. The news of the passing of this measure reached Melbourne
in November 1850, but the formal creation of the new colony of
Victoria did not take place till the 1st July 1851. By this time
the population had increased to 77,000, but the mere record of
this total does not represent the important facts of the case.
For the male inhabitants were more than 20 per cent. in excess of
the female, and of the males more than one half were between the
ages of 21 and 45, that is to say, in the full vigour of
life.</p>
<p>Thus the masculine power of the community was unusually great,
and its wealth corresponded with its vigour. The total revenue
for the year 1850 was nearly &pound;260,000, of which about half
came from the land fund and about half from general sources. The
revenue exceeded the expenditure, liberal as that had been, by
thirty per cent. The imports reached the substantial figure of
&pound;745,000, or between nine and ten pounds a head, for man,
woman, and child. But the exports were larger still, amounting in
value to one million sterling. All this was before the discovery
of gold.</p>

<h3>3. <small><i>Queensland.</i> (<i>Moreton Bay
District.</i>)</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> expedition of Surveyor Oxley along the
coast north of Sydney, in the year 1823, excited considerable
interest, and various attempts were made to settle colonies at
Port Essington, Melville Island, and other places on the north
coast; but all these proved unsuccessful. It was considered,
however, that some of the more accessible harbours on the east
coast might be suitable for penal settlements, as a relief to the
rapidly-filling Tasmania. Accordingly, in the year 1826, under
the authority of an Order in Council issued by the Home
Government, Governor Darling proclaimed Port Macquarie, Moreton
Bay, and Norfolk Island as places to which persons convicted of
offences in New South Wales might be sent. The Moreton Bay named
in this proclamation is the seat of government of the present
colony of Queensland; but the true growth of the colony must be
sought elsewhere.</p>
<p>For the proclamation of Moreton Bay as a penal settlement of
course carried with it a total prohibition of all free settlers.
No one was at liberty to visit the neighbourhood without the
express permission of the Government, no land was thrown open for
sale, the developement of the settlement was restricted within
the limits fixed by the needs of the penal establishment. When
the city of Brisbane was founded, it was founded simply as a
Government station, and so it remained for fourteen years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the great wave of pastoral enterprise had been
rolling steadily northward as well as southward. We have seen
that the advanced stations in the Monaroo District of the
Australian Alps led to the discovery of Gippsland. Just so did
the stations on the Liverpool Plains lead to the discovery of
pastoral Queensland. The squatters of the Liverpool Plains, ever
seeking fresh pasture for their sheep, pushed northward, till
they compelled the Government to recognise the New England
District. The bolder spirits, many of them recent arrivals from
England, pushed northward again, over the Macintyre and Dumaresq
Rivers, until they discovered the Darling Downs, that splendid
tract of sheep-breeding country which is now the pride of
Queensland. Their silent approach had been hidden from the
Government outposts near Moreton Bay by two lines of mountains,
which, running parallel with the coast, screen the interior
entirely from it. In fact these mountain walls were at first a
source of great anxiety to the squatters, who wanted an
accessible harbour, and for several years no pass to Moreton Bay
was known except an almost impracticable fissure named
"Cunningham's Gap".</p>
<p>At length the extreme expense of the long overland journey to
Newcastle emboldened the squatters of the Darling Downs to push
through the mountain wall and make their appearance in the
Moreton Bay District. At first they were not allowed to bring
their produce to Brisbane, but the abolition of the assignment
system in 1838, and the suspension of transportation in 1840,
soon led the Government to take a different view of the case, and
in 1840 the penal establishment at Brisbane was broken up.
Thereupon the Government officials joined heartily with the
"Jackeroos" (as the squatters had been called by the blacks), and
a more practicable pass through the mountains was quickly found
by the energy of Lieutenant Gorman, formerly commandant of the
station.</p>
<p>Thenceforward the Moreton Bay District began to develope on
much the same lines as those which had been followed by its
sister colony of Port Phillip in the south. The first open sale
of lands in the District took place (at Sydney) in the year 1842;
but in the first nine years of its existence less than 2,500
acres of Crown land were disposed of. Direct immigration from
Europe was established, but the immigrants came in small numbers.
Squatting spread much more rapidly; and a steady stream from the
northern districts of New South Wales soon rendered the
appointment of Crown Land Commissioners necessary. But the
squatters experienced great difficulty in obtaining labour, and
the system of assignment and even importation of convicts from
the old country was maintained in Moreton Bay District a decade
longer than in New South Wales proper. When, on the attempted
revival of the transportation system in 1849, the unfortunate
<i>Hashemy</i> was driven with her convict cargo from Melbourne
to Sydney, and there received with storms of indignation, the
difficulty was disposed of by handing over the immigrants to the
squatters of the Darling Downs, who were only too ready to
receive them. In their hunger for labour, the squatters also
imported Chinese hands across the straits, and thus laid the
foundation of the great Chinese question. It is said, however,
that the original Australian prejudice against the Chinaman was
started before his arrival, by the scare created during the
Chinese war of 1841-2, to the effect that the Chinese were
determined to revenge themselves on their white neighbours by
poisoning their tea. As the squatter's "hand" drank tea in large
quantities when he could not get whiskey, the stockmen fled to
the towns upon the startling rumour, and left the stations
deserted.</p>
<p>The gold discoveries of 1851, which did not extend to Moreton
Bay District, added still further to the anxiety of the
squatters, and laid the basis of the party politics of the next
few years. The squatters desired labour at any price, but the new
artizans and small farmers who were gradually growing up in and
around Brisbane determined that they should only have it at a
high price. The squatters' petitions for "exiles" (as the
convicts were now euphoniously termed) were met by an opposition
which based itself upon the alleged evil effect of the
introduction of convict labour, but which was really produced by
an anxiety to prevent the flooding of the labour market.</p>
<p>Accordingly, when the cry came for separation from the
mother-colony, as it very soon did after the success of Port
Phillip in that direction, it was not an united cry. The small
farmers and the men of the towns, sheltering themselves behind
the great Australian Anti-Transportation League of 1851, and
choosing as their mouthpiece the ever available Dr Lang, aimed at
separation pure and simple, with no obligations. The squatters,
represented in the Council at Sydney by men of their own class,
tried to tempt the Colonial Office to grant separation, by
offering to relieve the mother country of an annual draft of
convicts. Had not the distant colony of Western Australia come to
the relief of the Home Government, by a request to be supplied
with the article which the Queensland squatters were also
seeking, it is possible that the latter might have had their way,
at the expense of much ill-feeling. As it was, the resolute
attitude of the great majority of Australians was respected, and,
when separation was granted in 1859, it was accompanied by no
conditions relative to transportation. The introduction of
Responsible Government in New South Wales, followed by the
discovery of gold in Queensland in 1858, really settled the
question. It was hardly to be expected that the Moreton Bay
settlers would allow their revenues to be expended by the Council
at Sydney, and their affairs to be directed by Sydney-appointed
officials. Even at the time of its separation, however, the
colony was not very powerful, so far as material interests were
concerned. Its population was about 30,000, divided almost
equally between town and country. Of towns there were about
twenty in all, ranging in size from Brisbane, with 4,000
inhabitants, to Allora with 55; in fact half of the so-called
towns were mere villages. None of them had separate municipal
governments at the date of separation; but the movement in favour
of town municipalities manifested itself immediately afterwards.
Brisbane, Ipswich, and Toowoomba obtained self-government at
once. The relative proportion of the sexes, the male inhabitants
preponderating by about 50 per cent., and the amount of the trade
at the ports, gave promise of rapid and vigorous developement;
and this promise has since been fully realized. Nevertheless, it
is clear that, when it began its separate career, the community
was a mere speck upon the surface of the vast territory confided
to its care; and it is even startling to realize that its members
entered upon their full political freedom without any preparation
or schooling in the lower forms of political life. Queensland is,
in fact, the only Australasian community which has never passed
through the preliminary stages of colonial government. The fact
that it at once proved equal to its new position must be regarded
as a signal testimony to the political aptitude of the
Anglo-Saxon race.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br>
<br>
<small>WESTERN AUSTRALIA AND SOUTH AUSTRALIA.<br>
<br>
I. <i>Western Australia</i></small>.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>EXPLORATIONS</small> conducted by Captain Stirling on
the western coast of New Holland, in the year 1827, determined
the British Government to attempt a settlement in that direction.
The tide of popular feeling was running so strongly in favour of
colonization, that the Colonial Secretary actually indulged in
the hope that the enterprise might be made self-supporting from
the first; and the formal notice issued by the Colonial Office,
on the 5th December, 1828, stated that His Majesty's Government
did not intend to contribute anything towards the cost of
transit, or the maintenance of the settlers in their new home.
The inducement held out to intending emigrants was a promise that
parties containing a proportion of not less than five females to
six males should upon their arrival receive free grants of land,
at the rate of forty acres for every &pound;3 of capital invested
in public or private objects in the colony to the satisfaction of
the Government. All lands not brought into cultivation within
twenty-one years from the date of the grant were to revert to the
Crown, and the settlers were to give security that they would not
come upon the Government for rations. Although the Colonial
Office Notice was headed "Swan River", its terms did not actually
promise that the new settlement should be made in any particular
spot.</p>
<p>Before these terms had been made public, however, certain
enterprising capitalists Mr Thomas Peel, Sir Francis Vincent,
Colonel Potter Macqueen, and Mr E. W. Schenley had made an offer
which the Colonial Office felt strongly inclined to accept. Mr
Peel and his friends proposed to arrange for the emigration,
within a period of four years, of at least 10,000 souls; their
object being to establish tobacco and cotton planting, the
cultivation of sugar and flax, and the growth of certain
unspecified drugs which, in some mysterious way, were to get the
Government out of political difficulties then existing. The
promoters of the scheme also proposed to rear horses for India,
and cattle for the supply of salt provisions for the navy. In
return for their expenditure, which they estimated at &pound;30
upon each emigrant, they proposed that each of their male
settlers should receive a free grant of at least 200 acres; but,
though the terms of the Memorial are not very clear, it seems
that these grants were to be deducted from the total area to be
reserved to the promoters of the enterprise. This area the
memorialists appear to have fixed at the modest figure of four
million acres, being the value of their estimated expenditure,
calculated at the rate of one shilling and sixpence an acre.</p>
<p>The negotiations which first followed upon this offer appear
to have been orally conducted, and before the issue of the public
Notice misunderstandings had arisen between the promoters of the
enterprise and the Colonial Office. That something had been said
by the Government officials to encourage the project appears
probable; for Mr Peel at once proceeded to buy a ship capable of
carrying 400 emigrants, and to stock her with the necessary
provisions and outfit. He also entered into correspondence with
Captain Stirling, the intended Lieutenant-Governor of the
settlement, and then learnt, obviously to his surprise, that the
Government was not prepared to adopt his plans in their entirety.
He remonstrated somewhat pointedly with Mr Horace Twiss, the
official with whom he had apparently been in communication; but
the department very easily disposed of his personal appeals by
the simple expedient of directing another official to conduct the
future correspondence. Mr Peel was evidently so very sanguine,
and dealt so much in italics in his correspondence, that it is
quite possible that he imagined Mr Twiss to have said more than
he did say. And indeed, when he received his final answer from
the Colonial Office, the cause of his disappointment is not very
easy to ascertain. It is true that the Government reduced his
maximum claim to one million acres, and cut down the allowance
for cost of passage to &pound;15 a head; but it accepted his
estimate of land value at eighteen pence an acre, and allowed him
twelve years within which to provide the required capital, while
for ordinary emigrants the offer of eighteen pence an acre only
held good till the end of 1829. Moreover, the Government actually
offered to allot half a million acres immediately on the arrival
of the first batch of 400 emigrants under Mr Peel's auspices,
provided that they complied with the conditions of the
Notice.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is quite clear that Mr Peel's friends were
dissatisfied with the terms offered by the Government, for
Colonel Macqueen withdrew at once, and in January, 1829, Sir
Francis Vincent and Mr Schenley followed suit. But Mr Peel was
made of sterner stuff, or more deeply involved, for we find his
name, with those of his son and a few friends, on the list of
inhabitants of the colony furnished by Captain Stirling in 1830,
though his party appear to have declined to allow their names to
appear on the ordinary Muster Book of the settlement. Moreover,
Mr Peel seems to have succeeded in inducing nearly 200 persons to
accompany him. He was invited to mark out his claim upon the map
of the colony immediately after Captain Stirling, who had been
promised a grant of 100,000 acres, had made his choice; but, for
some reason, his reservation appears to have lapsed, for Captain
Stirling writes in January 1830 that he has thrown it open to
general settlement.</p>
<p>In the spring of the year 1829 the expedition under Captain
Stirling set out, and reached its destination safely in August of
that year. The Governor, who was assisted in his labours by a
small nominee Council created under an Act of Parliament passed
for the purpose in 1829, immediately on his arrival marked out
the sites of two towns Fremantle, at the entrance of the Swan
River, and Perth, the future capital of the colony, some nine
miles up the stream. The favourable reports which the founders of
the colony had circulated in England were eagerly adopted, and
fresh colonists arrived in great numbers almost before the
Governor was ready to receive them. Sufficient land had not been
surveyed; the navigation of Cockburn Sound had not been
thoroughly explored. Moreover, the character of some of the early
immigrants left much to be desired. Though the Colonial Office
had made a strong point of the promise that under no
circumstances should convicts be sent to the colony, it was found
necessary, in order to provide a supply of manual labour, to
authorize the binding or "indenturing" of servants for a
specified time to those capitalists who were willing to pay the
cost of their passage; and a good many of these servants were
simply vagabonds whom the parish authorities in England had been
anxious to get rid of. Before the close of the year 1829 the
Governor found himself obliged to appoint a magistracy and a body
of constables; but the commencement of agricultural operations in
the year 1830 did a good deal to provide regular employment for
all hands, and to reduce the temptations to idleness and
vice.</p>
<p>Within four months of its foundation the colony possessed a
population of thirteen hundred souls, of whom 850 were
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> residents, and the remainder military on
service, visitors from the other Australian colonies, or foreign
merchants. Already twenty-five ships had arrived in Cockburn
Sound; some of them from Sydney. The inevitable depression which
seizes upon the immigrant soon after his arrival in a strange
land had at first given rise to gloomy anticipations of failure;
but, when Captain Stirling wrote, in January 1830, the community
had already partially recovered from the attack. The building of
houses and boats, the transport of goods from the ships, the
examination of land with a view to selection, and fishing, filled
up the time of the more energetic settlers, and left them little
leisure for melancholy reflections.</p>
<p>But the succeeding years were to try severely the patience of
the settlers. The sanguine expectations of speedy success were
not realized. The anticipated trade with China did not spring up;
for the simple reason that the settlers could offer the Chinese
nothing that they had not already, while they themselves could
not afford to buy Chinese goods. For some time the supply of
necessaries was intermittent, and in poor seasons the colony came
near to starvation. Many immigrants had spent their last penny in
purchasing articles of outfit, and were therefore unable to buy
provisions on their arrival. The Government, though its officials
did their best to alleviate distress, steadily declined to assume
the responsibility of maintaining the population. The free grants
made at the foundation of the colony had established a bad
principle of settlement; and, although Lord Ripon's Regulations
of 1831 introduced the practice of sale into the colony, it was
some time before the evil effects of lavish grants were
counteracted. Some of the early immigrants had brought out large
numbers of indentured servants, whom they were, in many cases,
bound to feed during the continuance of their contracts. Finding
the expense of their keep greater than the profits on their
labour, they often voluntarily released their servants, who
either sought employment from the smaller capitalists of the
settlement, or migrated to Tasmania in search of work. The former
class often saved enough in a few years to buy small farms at the
Government price of five shillings an acre; and then the labour
market became starved, and wages rose to prohibitive figures.
There was trouble also with the aborigines; and it became
necessary to organize a system of mounted police to overawe them.
Many of the settlers, overcome by their troubles, left the
colony, and carried evil reports to other lands. Nevertheless, a
temperate and detailed account of the settlement, published in
the year 1835 by Major Irwin, for several years Commandant of the
forces in the colony, shews that the community was distinctly
progressing. Beside the original towns of Perth and Fremantle,
the townships of Guildford, Kelmscott, Augusta, and York had been
founded; and there was even a small handful of settlers at King
George's Sound, where the new colony had taken over a military
station established by the Sydney Government in 1826.
Sheep-farming was being rapidly developed, as the suitability of
the climate and soil became apparent. Horse-breeding had been
successfully started. There was a regularly established weekly
newspaper. And there were not a few individual settlers whose
achievements and prospects were all that could be desired. So far
as Government machinery was concerned, the necessary duties were
performed by a small staff of officials, of whom the Colonial
Secretary and the Surveyor were, perhaps, the most important.
There was but one judge in the colony, who acted in the double
capacity of Chairman of Quarter Sessions and Commissioner of the
Civil Court. Criminal charges were always tried by a jury; in
civil cases either party was entitled to demand the same method
of trial. But it was to be long before the colony was able to
defray the expenses of its own administration.</p>
<p>In the year 1835, largely at the instigation of Major Irwin, a
society, known as the Western Australian Association, was
established in London for the purpose of protecting the interests
of the colony. It consisted partly of persons directly connected
with the settlement, partly of Calcutta residents, who projected
a connection, both for purposes of trade and health, with the
colony, and of Englishmen interested in colonial questions. The
Association succeeded in establishing a corresponding committee
in the colony, and from time to time published information as to
its conditions. From these reports we learn that, down to the end
of the year 1835, about 1,600,000 acres of land had been
alienated by the Crown; but the effect of these figures is
modified by the consideration that less than 1,500 acres had been
disposed of since the coming into operation of the rule against
free grants, and that, of the remainder, only about 300,000 acres
had been acquired in fee simple through the fulfilment of
conditions of improvement. In the same year 1835, the colonists
presented to the Home Government a Memorial against Lord Ripon's
Regulations; urging that the abandonment of the free grant
principle involved a breach of faith on the part of the Colonial
Office. Though the Secretary of State declined to accede to this
view, he allowed the owners of free grants, many of whom had
selected their lands in great haste on their arrival, to exchange
their old selections for blocks which time had proved to be more
fertile or suitable. But as the old grants were only to be
accepted at the rate of eighteen pence an acre, and the new were
to continue at the minimum of five shillings adopted in 1831. it
followed that the applicant anxious for exchange would only get
30 acres of new land for a surrender of 100 acres of his old
property.</p>
<p>The colony now entered upon a long and uneventful period, in
which the historian finds little to record. The reports which
came to hand in the mother country shewed that the little
settlement was making steady, if slow progress. In the year 1838,
the non-official colonists secured a voice in the government of
their own affairs, through the nomination of four of their number
to seats in the Legislative Council. The troubles with the
aborigines were dying away. The blacks were voluntarily rendering
services of a valuable character to the colonists, and a local
law of a liberal character had admitted them to many of the
rights of British subjects. By the close of the year 1840 the
numbers of the white population had risen to 2,300, chiefly by
the excess of births over deaths, for self-supported immigration
had almost ceased, and assisted immigration had not yet begun.
The cry of scarce labour was still heard, but in some way or
other the farmers seemed to do well. When Governor Hutt reported
in 1845, he took a cheerful view of the situation. The population
had almost doubled itself in the preceding four years, the
acreage under crop was steadily rising. A scarcity of money and a
bad system of paper credit, combined with the difficulty of
disposing of the abundant proceeds of successive good harvests,
had at one time produced rather alarming results. But by mutual
forbearance, and the exercise of economy, a better system had
been introduced; and there was abundant evidence of comfort, if
not of wealth. The great drawback to the economic prosperity of
the colony lay in the uniformity of its occupations. Exchange,
even more than production, is essential to the creation of
wealth; and how exchange when all produce similar articles? The
answer evidently was develop e an export trade, and thus increase
your own means and the customs revenue at once. But just here lay
the difficulty. The Indian trade was not very hopeful. The
eastern colonies hardly wanted anything that Western Australia
could give them. Nevertheless, the colonists had made a
determined effort, with no little success. In the year 1843-4
they had increased their exports by nearly 100 per cent., they
had made a beginning in ship-building, the vine and the olive
were being cultivated for export, and the friends of the colony
had secured admission for Western Australian timber into the
dockyards of the mother country. Meanwhile the old standard
pursuits were not neglected. Sheep-breeding and farming remained
as popular as ever.</p>
<p>But all other questions sank into unimportance compared with
the standing difficulty of obtaining a supply of labour at
moderate rates. Owing to the lavish distribution of land at the
foundation of the colony, there were always private owners only
too anxious to sell at less than the Government minimum of one
pound an acre introduced by the Land Sales Act of 1842. The
consequences of this fact were two. In the first place, any
labourer who worked with steadiness for a few years could easily
purchase enough land from private owners to enable him to set up
as a small proprietor. On the other hand, the frequent purchases
of land brought no money into the colonial exchequer, and,
consequently, the fund from which the other Australian colonies
paid the expenses of their immigrants, and provided their public
works, was not in existence in Western Australia. In the early
years of the colony a company, known as the Western Australian
Company, had been formed, somewhat on the lines of the more
famous New Zealand Company, for the introduction of immigrants
and the developement of the colony. This body professed to have
obtained a grant of 51,000 acres in the Leschenault District,
near the northern coast of Geographe Bay, some hundred miles
south of Perth, where it proposed to found a settlement to be
known as Australind. But a reference to the Company's prospectus
shews that it mainly aimed at inducing the emigration of small
capitalists, who had already bought and paid for land at the
Company's offices in London, according to the vicious system, so
much beloved of statesmen and company promoters, but so fatal to
their clients, by which the intending settler is shown a plan of
land situated thousands of miles away, and induced to commit
himself irrevocably to the purchase of a spot which he has never
seen, and of which the map can only give him the very vaguest
idea. There is no need to attribute any conscious injustice to
the organizers of such schemes. The natural desire to retain as
much control as possible at headquarters, and to secure the
investor beyond redemption, was sufficient to recommend the plan.
The Western Australian Company seems to have done some business;
for we find it, a few years later, in correspondence with the
Government on the subject of its claims. But it cannot have
attained much success; for in the year 1849 a second association,
the Colonization Assurance Company, was formed in England
(apparently by some of the promoters of the earlier venture) to
settle the very same district of Leschenault. The town of
Australind, however, still survives.</p>
<p>At last the step was taken which was to prove so momentous in
the history of Western Australia. In the years 1845 and 1846 the
legislature of the colony took the question of labour into
earnest consideration, and produced two reports, in which they
strongly impressed upon the Colonial Office the absolute
necessity, if the colony was to be saved from stagnation and
decay, of facilitating immigration, both of small capitalists and
of labourers. The suggestions made by the reports are, virtually,
three. The first is the removal of all difficulties in the way of
the introduction of German settlers, who (say the Council) are
already disgusted with the treatment of their fellow-countrymen
in the United States, and who look favourably towards Australia
as a land of greater promise. The second is the assisted
emigration of poor persons, who, not being actually paupers or at
least not incapable paupers, are always very near the border line
which separates dependence from independence, and a large
proportion of whom fall every year into the ranks of those who
receive public aid. The third, and most startling suggestion
(regard being had to the circumstances of the founding of the
colony) is that a limited number of convicts shall be sent out
annually, at the expense of the Home Government, to labour upon
the roads and other public works of the colony.</p>
<p>Very little seems to have come of the first of these
suggestions. The legal difficulties in the way of German
immigration were, even in 1846, very small, the chief one being a
disability in aliens to own the fee simple of British soil. But,
even if this disability held good in colonial territory, it was
comparatively easy for the German immigrant to acquire the rights
of a British citizen. The English Government did not see its way
to advertise in Germany for German emigrants.</p>
<p>The second suggestion could not be acted upon at once. The
relief of the poor in England had always been a matter for the
local, not the central Government; and, in 1846, the Poor Law
Commissioners had not that control over the local authorities
which is now so firmly exercised by the Local Government Board.
But, in course of time, facilities were given by Parliament to
the local Poor Law authorities to assist in the emigration of
their poor. And, even before that event, means had been provided,
as we shall see, for emigrants of the second class.</p>
<p>But it was the third suggestion of the Legislative Council
which received the promptest attention. The Home Government was
just then keenly embarrassed by the growing dislike of the
eastern colonies to receive convict immigrants, and it clutched
eagerly at the opening offered by the wants of Western Australia.
The colonists were under the impression that they would receive
bands of prisoners who would work in gangs under official
supervision, or, at least, be assigned to private employers by
the Government. But the assignment system had been formally
abolished in 1838, and could not be revived; while the gang
system required an elaborate organization which did not yet exist
in Western Australia. The Colonial Office was in a hurry, so the
Secretary of State determined on sending a varied assortment,
with a view to test the capabilities of the colony. First came a
ship-load of "Parkhurst" lads, who were so warmly welcomed that
the Colonial Office speedily sent a second and a third
detachment. On the 1st May, 1849, an Order in Council named
Western Australia as a place to which convicts might be sent
under the Transportation Acts; and, in the following year,
arrived the first batch of "ticket of leave" men, who, as Lord
Grey explained, would have to be treated in all respects as free
persons, except that they would have to report themselves
periodically to a magistrate; and Lord Grey suggested that an Act
of the local legislature should render them amenable to summary
jurisdiction for all offences not capital. So rapid was the
stream, that Governor Fitzgerald held up his hands in alarm; but
his fears were not realized, and when the Home Government
proceeded further to create a regular penal establishment and to
pour British money and British convicts into the colony
wholesale, the settlers woke up to new energy, and things in
Western Australia began to move at last. The opposition to the
new decision had been faint, and it was now almost entirely
overcome. Before April 1852 the colony had received 1,500
convicts, of whom about half were "ticket of leave", and half
actual prisoners. In the year 1852, the Imperial Parliament voted
&pound;86,000 for the convict establishment, most of it to be
spent in the colony. New officials were needed; old officials had
their salaries raised. There was a steady market for provisions,
and, with the produce of their sales, the farmers and squatters
took up new land. The country round Champion Bay was settled.
Best of all, the land fund began to assume tangible proportions,
and the Emigration Commissioners began to send out free emigrants
by the hundred. Coal was discovered, a trade in guano and
sandal-wood sprang up. The Madras cavalry took its remounts at
last from Western Australia. Mining operations were commenced on
the Murchison River. There was a talk of pearl fisheries in Shark
Bay. The careful statistics compiled by Mr Durlacher, the
Registrar-General of the colony, in 1859, shew that the
population had increased to nearly 15,000, or an increase of 23
per cent. on the census of 1854, that the revenue had, during the
same period, increased 43 per cent., that, though very few
immigrant capitalists had arrived, there had been an influx of
nearly a thousand agricultural labourers, whose services were
enabling the farmers to develope their land at a profitable rate.
The health of the colony, as usual, left little to be desired.
Wages were high, though not now prohibitive; the prices of
necessaries low.</p>
<p>But there were certain drawbacks to this picture of
prosperity. The decision adopted in 1849 (p. 124) bore immediate
fruit in the constitutional plans of 1850. When the other
colonies of the Australian group obtained their representative
institutions by the Imperial Act of the latter year, Western
Australia was left out in the cold. It was merely provided that,
when she could prove herself to be entirely self-supporting, her
local legislature might, upon a petition of one-third of its
householders, make provision for representative institutions on
the model of the eastern colonies. An attempt in this direction
was made in the year 1854, but without success. The colony was
unwilling to forego the advantages to be derived from the heavy
expenditure of Imperial funds, which exceeded its own proper
revenues by considerably more than 100 per cent.; and, though
most of this large outlay was directly connected with the convict
establishments, yet a subsidy of about; &pound;10,000 was
annually needed to supplement the colonial expenditure on the
strictly civil administration. Moreover, of the whole male
population of the colony at the close of the year 1859, nearly 41
per cent., were or had been convicts. In Freemantle, Perth,
Sussex, Swan, Toodyay, Victoria, Wellington, and York, the bond
population actually exceeded the free, at least among the male
adults, who alone would take part in the work of representative
government. Even excluding actual convicts, there was only a
percentage of 62.5 persons above the age of infancy who could
both read and write; and every year saw the admission into the
ranks of the free of illiterates destitute of such elementary
accomplishments. It was impossible to grant representative
institutions to such a community as this.</p>
<p>But in the year 1865 a change came about. In that year the
Home Government announced, in deference to the urgent
remonstrances of the other colonies, its intention of ceasing to
send convicts to Western Australia. The settlers in the latter
colony were dismayed. They had grown accustomed to the new state
of things. They did not object to the risks of "ticket of leave"
servants. The Imperial Law officers had in 1850 given a valuable
opinion to the effect that the committal to prison of an
indentured servant for an offence against his master did not
dissolve the contract of service. Before that date, if the
servant were anxious to change his place, he committed an offence
which would land him in gaol for a month, and, when he came out,
he was a free man, so far as his former master was concerned. Now
the boot was on the other foot. The master prosecuted the
offending servant, allowed him a month to repent of his misdeeds
in prison, and then received him back to sterner discipline.
Colonists had grown rich on the expenditure of the convict
establishments. They saw ruin before them if it ceased. They
protested to the Home Government, but they protested in vain. The
other colonies declared that the convicts who escaped, or the
"expirees" who retired from their somewhat distant neighbour
contaminated the immaculate purity of their own populations, and
the Home Government (doubtless to its own chagrin) had to bow
before an overwhelming majority.</p>
<p>But good came out of the immediate loss suffered by the
colony. With the change in its circumstances, the desire for free
institutions once more awoke, and, in the year 1865, a petition,
which alleged itself to be signed by 1,303 of the 2,110
householders of the colony, was presented to the Legislative
Council, urging the introduction of a measure to establish
representative government. The Council, which had undergone no
change in its constitution since the year 1838, save by the
introduction of two more official members, did not receive the
petition with perfect sympathy, but, nevertheless, appointed a
committee to enquire into its statements. The committee reported
that, although the signatures should be properly reduced to
1,153, by striking off the names of petitioners still under
sentence, yet that the latter number could be accepted as
genuine, and that 898 of the 1,153 admitted signatures were those
of persons who had never undergone sentence&mdash;in fact of
fully free citizens. Even the reduced figure of 898 obviously
represented more than the statutory third of the householders of
the colony, and the committee was, therefore, obliged to report
the petition as formally adequate. But the Council denied
altogether its duty, as distinct from its discretion, to act upon
the prayer of the petition; and its members, with one dissentient
voice, adopted an amendment to the effect that the requirements
of the situation would be adequately met by the addition of two
non-official members to the Council&mdash;in order to balance the
official against the non-official votes&mdash;and by the
alteration of the tenure of non-official members from life
holding to occupation for three years. In this view Governor
Hampton concurred, and, in the year 1867, the Duke of Buckingham
announced that the Home Government would act upon the
recommendation. But public feeling was too strong, and in the
year 1870 a Legislative Council, consisting partly of nominee and
partly of elected members, was created, on the model of the
Constitutions of 1850. Twenty years more of steady progress
brought the colony of Western Australia into the front rank of
British dependencies; and in the year 1890 an Imperial statute
enabled Her Majesty in Council to assent to the terms of a
colonial measure which provided a bi-cameral Parliament with full
powers of self-government. Her Majesty's assent was proclaimed in
the colony in October of the same year, and completed the
establishment of Responsible Government in Australasia. The
colony founded, amid so much difficulty and discouragement, by
Captain Stirling in 1829, now ranks in point of political
developement and independence with the oldest and proudest
possessions of the Crown; while recent developements in commerce
and industry bid fair to make it equally successful in the
pursuit of material prosperity.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>2. <i>South Australia.</i></h3>
<br>
<p>The record of the colony of South Australia is one of the
pleasantest chapters in Australasian history. Though the colony
had its trials in early days, they were soon over; and, though
its prosperity has sometimes advanced by leaps and bounds, its
progress has, in the main, been steady and uniform. There has
been, practically speaking, no difficulty with the aborigines;
there has never been a convict question in South Australia. The
colony has had its romance in the Northern Territory problem and
the overland telegraph. Probably at some future date the romance
will be realized in solid fact; the telegraph is, as every one
knows, already accomplished.</p>
<p>Sturt's famous overland journey in 1830, during which he
explored the waters of the Murrumbidgee and the Lachlan,
discovered the Darling, and floated down the Murray till he
reached Lake Alexandrina, practically gave the occasion for the
settlement of South Australia. Though the intrepid explorer did
not succeed in reaching the sea, owing to the dangerous character
of the mouth of the Murray, he saw enough to convince him that a
great and fertile land lay awaiting settlers. His reports stirred
up the Sydney Government to further efforts; and in the following
year Captain Collet Barker, who had been visiting the abortive
settlements in the north-west, and had touched at King George's
Sound on his return, was commissioned to examine St Vincent's
Gulf, for the purpose of completing Sturt's exploration of the
Murray. This object he achieved, though he died in the moment of
triumph, slain by the blacks, whose cause he had always
championed. Fragmentary as were his notes, his efforts were
sufficient to prove that there was access from the sea to land
suitable for a settlement, and the plan was taken up forthwith in
London.</p>
<p>But the disasters of recent years, in connection with the
colony of Western Australia, had not escaped public attention;
and there were a deliberation and carefulness in the preparations
for the new settlement which augured well for its success. The
celebrated theorist on the subject of colonization, Mr Edward
Gibbon Wakefield, expounded his views at length, and some of the
main features of his scheme were adopted. Finally, in the year
1834, a statute of the Imperial Parliament authorized His Majesty
to create a province or provinces of South Australia, which
should be exempt from the jurisdiction of any other Australian
Government. It seems odd that the framers of the statute should
have chosen the old military title of "province" for that
settlement in Australia which least of all deserved the name; and
we may agree with a recent historian that the name of "South
Australia" is vague and meaningless, while at the same time we
may be permitted to hope that his proposed
substitute&mdash;"Centralia"&mdash;may never be allowed to offend
British ears. But the "Province of South Australia" became, and
till recently remained, the title of the great colony which fills
the gap between New South Wales and Victoria on the east, and
Western Australia on the west; which touches the Indian Ocean on
the south, and once (through the addition of the Northern
Territory) stretched away to the Gulf of Carpentaria on the
north. It has, however, as will later appear, been reduced to its
original proportions by the transfer of the Northern Territory to
the Commonwealth Government.</p>
<p>The statute of 1834 provided that the King in Council should
appoint a body of three or more Commissioners, to be known as
"The Colonization Commissioners for South Australia", whose
function it should be to manage and dispose of the land and land
revenues of the province, and superintend the emigration of
settlers. The details were to be managed on the spot by a
Resident Commissioner, appointed by the Crown as Commissioner of
Public Lands in the Colony, but acting under the directions of
the Commissioners in London, who were also to have power to
appoint a secretary, treasurer, assistant surveyors, and other
officials. By implication, however, the colony was to be ruled by
a Governor appointed by the Crown, to whom the power of making
laws was to be delegated; but it was promised that a Constitution
should be granted when the population of the colony should reach
fifty thousand souls. It is an express provision of the statute
that convicts from the United Kingdom shall at no time and under
no circumstances be transported to the colony.</p>
<p>The remarkable feature in the provisions hitherto detailed is,
of course, the great power given to the South Australian
Commissioners, who, though they were undoubtedly Crown officials,
were also in fact the promoters of the enterprise. But the
discretion of the Commissioners was limited by one or two
provisions of importance. No Crown lands were to be sold at less
than twelve shillings an acre, and no power was given to the
Commissioners to make free grants. The Commissioners might fix
any sum higher than twelve shillings an acre as the sale price;
but such price was to be uniform at any given period,
irrespective of situation or quantity, the money had to be paid
down, and the sale open to the public. The proceeds of the land,
whether arising from sale or pasturage licences, were to form an
Emigration Fund, which was to be wholly devoted to the emigration
of persons under the age of thirty years, as nearly as possible
in equal proportion of sexes; and no assisted passage was to be
allowed to one member of a family unless the others accompanied
him. Moreover, in order to test the <i>bon&acirc; fides</i> and
stability of the scheme, the Act was not to come into operation
until the Commissioners had deposited &pound;20,000 as security
with the Home Treasury, and until intending purchasers of land in
the colony to the extent of &pound;35,000 had come forward and
deposited their purchase money. But, these conditions being
fulfilled, the Commissioners were to have power to borrow on the
security of the Land Fund anything up to &pound;50,000 to start
emigration, and, for general purposes, up to &pound;200,000, to
be charged on the future general revenues of the colony.</p>
<p>It will be seen from the foregoing sketch of the provisions of
the South Australia statute, that the new colony was intended to
be a venture on a purely voluntary basis, an association in the
nature of an ordinary mercantile enterprise, for which the State
took no responsibility. The actual work of government was, no
doubt, to be carried on by state officials; but this was to be
government as it was understood in England, not as it had been
hitherto practised in Australia, where the State fed, clothed,
taught, and employed the bulk of the population. The State
reserved to itself the right to take over the administration in
the wider sense, if at the end of ten years from the passing of
the Act there should not be a population of ten thousand in the
province; but that contingency never happened, and the
Commissioners were ultimately abolished or, rather, transformed,
for very different reasons.</p>
<p>So prompt was the response to the scheme of the Commissioners,
that the first emigrant ship, the <i>Duke of York</i>, anchored
in Nepean Bay, Kangaroo Island, on the 27th July 1836, and seven
more vessels reached the coast before the end of that year. The
true pioneer of the colony was Colonel Light, the first Surveyor
General, who, after much exploration and anxious consideration,
fixed the site of the capital on the banks of the river Torrens,
where Adelaide now stands, and that of the harbour at the present
Port Adelaide, eight miles from the city, and about half-way up
the eastern shore of St Vincent's Gulf. The former choice, though
hotly disputed at the time, has been amply confirmed by
experience; the latter was not so happy, but the difficulties of
the coast were great, and Colonel Light could hardly have been
expected to foresee the enormous increase in the draught of
ocean-going ships which has taken place since the founding of
South Australia.</p>
<p>The early days of the colony illustrated the weakness of the
dual system established by the South Australia statute. One of
Colonel Light's subordinates, no doubt actuated by the best of
motives, appealed from him to the Commissioners in England on a
point of administration, and the Commissioners virtually
suspended Colonel Light without hearing his version of the story.
The Surveyor General, already worn out by the toils of his
office, died in the year 1838. Captain Hindmarsh, the first
Governor, was hardly more fortunate. He quarrelled with his
officials, most of them appointed by the Commissioners, and was
recalled at their instigation in the year of Light's death. His
successor, Colonel Gawler, was faced, on his arrival, with
serious difficulties, owing to the delay in surveying lands for
settlement. To save the mass of the immigrants from starvation,
he launched into expenditure on public buildings, and was accused
of concentrating the labourers of the settlement in the suburbs
of Adelaide. It is said that in the year 1840, when the
population was still less than 15,000, the debt of the colony
exceeded &pound;300,000. Bills drawn by Colonel Gawler on the
Home Commissioners were dishonoured; and the infant settlement
was plunged into a financial crisis. In 1841, Colonel Gawler was
replaced by a man whose name is for ever identified with the
success of the Australasian colonies Sir George (then Captain)
Grey. Under his wise government the province commenced that
career of prosperity which, with few breaks, it has ever since
maintained.</p>
<p>But, even before Captain Grey's arrival, events had happened
which showed that there was a future before the colony. In 1838
cattle had been brought from New South Wales by the Murray route,
and an indication of great commercial possibilities thereby
clearly given. The survey of the colony had been pushed on with
great energy, and upwards of a quarter of a million acres had
been sold by the middle of the year 1839. The price realized,
nearly &pound;230,000, showed that the estimate of twelve
shillings an acre had not been chimerical. Settlers were pouring
in, and bringing capital with them. Mr Eyre had explored the
shores of Lake Torrens, and accomplished his brilliant feat of
travelling overland from Adelaide to King George's Sound. The
alleged extravagance of Colonel Gawler's government had been
greatly exaggerated; and it is at least questionable whether the
censures passed upon him were deserved.</p>
<p>Captain Grey took prompt measures to relieve the situation.
His first care was to diminish the army of Government
employ&eacute;s which had grown up under the policy adopted by
Colonel Gawler, and which was doing a double injury to the
community, by eating up its revenues and by depriving the farmers
of necessary labour. He at once made a substantial reduction in
the rate of Government wages, in order to force labourers, so far
as possible, to take service with private employers, and refused
to enter upon any new works except those actually essential for
the business of the colony. Great indignation followed, of
course, amongst those who had found their account in the old
state of things; and, had there been representative institutions
in the colony, matters would have gone hard with the young
Governor. But Grey was the last man in the world to be turned
aside from his convictions by popular clamour; and, in this
instance, he fortunately had the power to enforce his views.
Great reductions were at once effected in the Government
expenditure, and the most beneficial results followed. The
farmers, now able to procure a supply of labour, extended their
operations; and in the year 1841 the cultivated area of the
colony rose from 2,500 to 6,700 acres, while in the following
year it nearly reached 20,000 acres. The significance of these
figures does not quite appear until we know that during the same
two years the population of the colony only increased from 14,600
to 17,000. In other words, the immense increase in the cultivated
area was not due to the sudden influx of immigrants, but to the
better distribution of the existing population.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the debt incurred by Colonel Gawler hung like a
millstone round the colony's neck, and when Captain Grey, anxious
not to break faith with the public creditors, drew bills on the
Home Commissioners to meet the debts incurred by his predecessor,
the bills were dishonoured. It is impossible to discuss here the
justice of this step on the part of those responsible for it; but
the incident was distinctly unfortunate, as it produced bad
feeling in the colony, and perhaps gave rise to those strained
relations between Sir George Grey and the Colonial Office, which
long did so much to mar the usefulness of the former's brilliant
career. Happily, the immediate tension was relieved by the
discovery, towards the end of the year 1842, of the great Kapunda
and, later on, of the Burra copper mines, which brought a new
industry into the colony and, by stimulating the growth of
population, enabled the farmers to find a ready market at
profitable prices for their produce. To these discoveries is
probably to be attributed the steady and substantial increase in
the population which set in after 1842, and which continued until
the gold rush in 1851. In the latter year South Australia sent,
to the United Kingdom alone, upwards of 4,000 tons of copper ore,
being a greater contributor in this respect than any other
country in the world except Cuba.</p>
<p>In the year 1845, Governor Grey, to the great regret of the
settlers (who had by that time learnt to appreciate his value)
was transferred to the neighbouring Australasian colony of New
Zealand, where his arduous labours form an important chapter of
colonial history. He was succeeded at Adelaide by Major Robe,
whose short term of office was chiefly marked by an unhappy
quarrel on the subject of ecclesiastical precedence. The subject
cannot be adequately treated in this book; but it may be said
that, whereas the equality and independence of religious bodies
was a fundamental principle with the founders of the colony,
Major Robe proposed, not indeed to establish the Anglican or any
other Church, but to grant pecuniary aid from the State coffers
to the principal religious communities. The desire for Government
subventions was so universal in the early days of the Australian
colonies and the temptation to the leaders of the Churches so
strong, that Major Robe's proposals were adopted by the majority
of his nominee Council. But, with the fuller political
emancipation in 1851, his arrangements were entirely swept away;
and probably the bulk of the colonists had all along disliked
them as a perpetual apple of discord.</p>
<p>This question, and an unsuccessful attempt on the part of the
Governor to impose a royalty on minerals without the consent of
the Legislative Council, form the chief incidents of Major Robe's
career. He was recalled, at his own request, in 1848, and
succeeded by Sir Henry Fox Young.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Young's term of office included events of the first
degree of importance, not only for South Australia, but for the
whole of the Australasian colonies; for it comprised the gold
discoveries of 1851, and did not cease till the very eve of the
introduction of Responsible Government. But the first part of it
only belongs to this chapter, and the principal fact in the first
part is the introduction of representative institutions.</p>
<p>An explanatory statute of the Imperial Parliament, passed in
the year 1838, had enabled Her Majesty to constitute a
Legislative Council of any number of persons (not less than
three) resident in the province. Under the powers of this statute
a Legislative Council of eight nominee members had come into
existence, and had virtually acted as the advisory committee of
the Governor. Of these members of the Council, half were
"official" in the strict sense, i.e. they were the holders of
paid appointments under the Crown in the colony, while the other
four, though nominated by the Governor, were not officially
connected with the Government otherwise than as unpaid members of
the Council, and were supposed to represent the interests of the
ordinary colonists. But it is, of course, clear that the Governor
would not nominate or recommend to seats in the Legislative
Council any persons who were avowedly hostile to the general
policy of the Government. And, even if the non-official members
proved restive, it was obvious that the Governor's casting vote
would always give the official members a majority, if the latter
were present in full force. The strong card of the Opposition lay
in the fact that five members were necessary to form a quorum of
the Council. If, therefore, the four non-official members
withdrew from session, no business could be done; and this card
was played with effect during the struggle over the mineral
royalties question.</p>
<p>It had, however, been a virtual promise at the time of the
colony's foundation, that, when the number of inhabitants reached
50,000, a "Constitution" should be granted by the Imperial
Government, and this Constitution was generally understood to
imply the existence of the representative element. So far from
attempting to go back upon this arrangement, the Imperial
Government had in the year 1842, long before the required
condition had been satisfied, passed an important statute
empowering Her Majesty to create in the colony a Legislative
Council or a General Assembly, or both; and the statute provided
that, if an Assembly were established, it should consist either
wholly or partially of elected members. The statute is noteworthy
on other grounds in the history of South Australia. It
consolidates into one fund, bearing interest at the very moderate
rate of 3&frac12; per cent., the various debts incurred by the
Commissioners under the powers of the foundation statute of 1834,
and guarantees the creditors their interest by a charge on the
Imperial Consolidated Fund; it forgives the colony entirely the
sum of &pound;155,000 which the Imperial Government had advanced
to it in the troubles of its early years; and it authorizes the
Governor (but not the Commissioners) to borrow any future sums
which it may be necessary to raise, upon the security of colonial
debentures charged upon the revenues of the colony. The Crown
Land Sales Act of the same year (1842) abolished the general
control of the South Australian Commissioners over the colony,
along with the office of Commissioner itself, and merely left to
the newly constituted Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners
certain powers over the disposal of Crown Lands and the revenues
derived therefrom. The events of the year 1842 had, therefore,
placed South Australia, both as respects government and land
distribution, on the footing of an ordinary colony of the British
empire, free from proprietary interests.</p>
<p>But it was not until the year 1849 that the circumstances of
the colony warranted the Crown in putting into force the
constitutional clauses of the Act of 1842. In the year 1849,
however, the population rose rapidly from forty-one to fifty-two
thousand, and the Home Government promptly responded to the
request for further emancipation. Inasmuch as the Imperial
Parliament contemplated a measure dealing generally with the
government of the Australian colonies, it was not thought well to
put in motion the special machinery, or to use the special
terminology, of the South Australia Act of 1842. But the statute
of 1850, which separated the Port Phillip District from New South
Wales, and conferred representative institutions on Tasmania and
Victoria, provided for the establishment of a similar form of
government in South Australia, and thus brought all the
Australian colonies (with the exception of Western Australia)
into the same stage of political developement. Under the
provisions of a Colonial Ordinance, approved by the Queen in
Council, a new Legislative Council was created, to consist of
twenty-four members, of whom two-thirds were to be elective and
the remaining eight nominee. Of the nominees, again, only half
were to be officials (in the strict sense), so that the new
Council (as it continued to be called, though it was, in fact,
the "General Assembly" contemplated by the statute of 1842)
contained really four-fifths of more or less independent members.
The Council met for the first time on the 20th August 1851, and
though, of course, it had control neither of the Land Fund nor of
the immediate action of the executive, by its free criticism and
its control of the general revenue it at once obtained a hold
upon the policy of the Government.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br>
<br>
<small>THE GOVERNMENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN COLONIES TO
1851.</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>IT</small> is generally admitted that, of all the
benefits to be derived from a study of colonial history, none is
greater than that which arises from an observation of the
political developement of the English-speaking colonies. And
while the influence of the Australian colonies upon the mother
country has in many respects been considerable, it has, in all
probability, been greater in no sphere than in the department of
politics. It becomes important therefore to attempt a general
survey of the early political history of the Australian colonies;
and the year 1851 has been chosen as the period at which this
early history terminates, because it was not until that date that
the Australian colonies were in any way brought into line as the
recipients of political institutions. Before the passing of the
Australian Government Act of 1850, the political history of the
group of communities with which we are now concerned had indeed
pursued a common course, but the various stages had been reached
at very different periods. The great events of the year 1851
tended to make one Australian history out of what had been
several distinct Australian histories, and thus the date is
doubly suitable to mark an epoch. With regard to the neighbouring
colony of New Zealand, its early arrangements were so different
from those of the Australian group, that we shall do better to
treat of them in a separate chapter.</p>
<p>Our account of the history of Australian government must
naturally commence with some account of the source from which it
issued; although this is so much a part of English history that
our account may well be brief.</p>
<p>The question of foreign dependencies had arisen at a very
early date, in connection with the dynastic claims of the English
monarchs of the Norman and Angevin lines. The Conqueror's Duchy
of Normandy, with its outlying fiefs in the Channel Islands,
Henry II's great inherited possessions of Guienne and Anjou,
Edward III's claims on the throne of France, all rendered it
impossible to overlook the question. So long as the English kings
ruled England simply through their officials, with the occasional
advice of Councils of Nobles, there could be small opportunity
for difference of opinion. Provided that the exchequers of
Normandy and England were kept separate, that the courts in each
showed respect for the local law, the King might do pretty well
what he pleased with either country, short of making personal
demands upon the services or property of his subjects. But when,
in the 13th century, parliaments of Estates began to acquire
considerable authority in their own lands, it soon became a
question how far the influence which bound the King in one
country could extend to his actions in another. Happily, the two
parties chiefly interested were at one in the matter. The King
objected to any interference by the strong English Parliament
with his government of outlying dependencies, whose people were
perhaps more ready than the English to submit to despotic power.
The English Parliament, on the other hand, realized perfectly
that any admission by the King of its right to control the
affairs of a dependency, would imply a corresponding
responsibility for the finances of that dependency; and warily
declined any interference. Thus it came to be accepted as a
doctrine of the constitution, that the government of dependencies
was the peculiar province of that department of the English
administration which was supposed to be immediately under the
control of the King&mdash;viz., the King's or (as it came later
to be called) the Privy Council. This doctrine prevailed without
question down to the Restoration in 1660, in spite of the events
of the Civil War; and by virtue of it Jersey and Guernsey claim
to this day that they are not in the jurisdiction of the English
Parliament.</p>
<p>Before the Restoration the question had, of course, assumed
serious proportions. The founding and gradual developement of the
American colonies, the strong tide of immigration to them which
set in with the beginning of the Puritan troubles, had put a
wholly different complexion on the subject of dependencies. The
American colonies were not foreign countries united to England by
the accident of dynastic title, but communities of kindred blood,
whose hopes and sympathies were pretty sure to be shared by one
or other of the newly-formed political parties in the old
country. Though they could hardly be treated as Calais had been,
by the grant of direct parliamentary representation, their
interests were readily espoused by members of the House of
Commons, now growing in importance; and the experiences of the
Long Parliament, which had ruled the colonies as it had ruled
everything else, had rendered the House of Commons very unwilling
to part entirely with the control of foreign possessions.
Cromwell's naval victories, which had added Jamaica to the list
of dependencies, stimulated this feeling, and, although the
growing English settlements in India, and the newly-acquired
station at Bombay, were still left to the East India Company,
Parliament declined to part altogether with control over the
colonies.</p>
<p>The compromise which Clarendon suggested, and which he
ultimately carried through, was worthy of his high reputation for
statesmanship. He declined to hand over the direct administration
of the colonies to Parliament, a task for which Parliament was
then but little fitted, but he reorganized the old constitutional
authority, the Privy Council, and provided for the appointment of
a special committee, which he named the Council of <i>Foreign
Plantations</i>, to "sit apart for the most particular
inspection, regulation, and care of the Foreign Plantations."
Twelve years after its formation, viz. in the year 1672, this
committee was amalgamated with another committee formed by
Clarendon at the Restoration, the <i>Council of Trade</i>; and
the two together, known as <i>The Council of Trade and
Plantations</i>, are, undoubtedly, the earliest appearance in
English history of a regular Colonial Office. It is, however,
only just to point out that the idea of such a body really
belongs to Cromwell's period of government, when an unsuccessful
attempt had been made to constitute a <i>Council of Trade and
Navigation</i>. It is also noteworthy, that one of the express
duties of the first Council of Trade and Plantations was to
consider "how noxious and unprofitable persons may be
transplanted to the general advantage of the Public and commodity
of our Foreign Plantations." The Council was abolished in the
year 1675, but, twenty years later, it was revived by King
William, and continued to be the colonial authority till the year
1781, when it was abolished at the close of the American War of
Independence.</p>
<p>But the mere constitution of such a Council would not of
itself have given Parliament any influence over the colonies.
Parliamentary elections did not at the Restoration, as they
virtually do now, appoint the most influential members of the
King's Council. To understand how Clarendon's scheme indirectly
brought about a Parliamentary control which Clarendon himself,
perhaps, did not desire, but which he surely must have foreseen,
we must turn for a moment to another subject.</p>
<p>When the Norman and Angevin kings organized the government of
England, they adopted a plan which they had inherited, through
the arrangements of Charles the Great, from the elaborate
officialism of the decaying Roman Empire. This plan, be it
remembered, had nothing in it of the severe Republicanism of
early Rome. It was the gradual outcome of Greek and Oriental
influences upon the decaying empire of the Caesars, which had
long had its seat of power, not at Rome, but at Constantinople.
Briefly speaking, the plan was, to create a separate and clearly
defined office for each department of Court or State, and to hand
it over to the almost irresponsible charge of a great official.
In many cases these offices became hereditary; they were looked
upon as property, and were often sold by the king before they
fell vacant. With the introduction of feudal ideas, they
gradually became fiefs, much in the same way as land. They were
expected to yield the Crown a certain revenue, and there were
certain vague principles as to the rights of their holders with
regard to the public; but beyond this the official conducted his
department with little interference on the part of the
sovereign.</p>
<p>Two results followed from this policy; first, that the kings
or emperors gradually lost touch of one department of business
after another, and found themselves helpless in the hands of
their great officials; secondly, that the offices themselves
came, by inheritance and purchase, to be filled by mere grandees,
whose duties became formal or honorary. In this way the old Court
offices in England, the Chamberlainship, the Stewardship, the
Marshalship, and the like, had already become useless for
government purposes by the end of the 12th century.</p>
<p>The English kings could not, with their ability, have failed
to see this; and their rapid creation of new offices,
justitiarship, treasurership, chancellorship, attests their
anxiety. But here they repeated the old policy of endowing
offices with definite functions; and the new officials, though
originally intended to be mere men of business, soon began in
their turn to pose as grandees, and to claim independence in
their offices. In the organization of the Exchequer we can see
how the kings tried to play them off against one another; but
only the strong kings succeeded in the task.</p>
<p>At last the English kings succeeded in training up a race of
officials whose duties were simply to do what they were told.
From about the close of the fourteenth century, we come across
traces of individuals described as "King's Secretaries", who
possessed the confidence of the monarchs, but who were not
allowed to assume an independent position. Their principal duties
were to conduct secret correspondence, and to keep the king aware
of what was going on in all the departments of state. Though not
of the dignity of councillors, they attended the meetings of the
King's Council in the capacity of clerks or secretaries, and
probably knew as much of what was being done as the chancellor or
the treasurer himself.</p>
<p>This kind of official was exactly suited to the ideas of the
Tudor monarchs, who were bent on breaking down feudal
independence, and whose ceaseless activity demanded the aid of
able and faithful agents. Accordingly, we find that, with the
sixteenth century, the King's Secretaries rise into the first
rank of officials. In the list appear such names as those of
Thomas Cromwell, Cecil, Walsingham, Sir Thomas Smith. By a
statute of 1539, the secretaries, now officially styled "The
King's Majesty's Principal Secretaries", were given precedence
before all other persons of their social rank, while, from a
Royal Warrant of the same date, we learn that they attended all
meetings of the Council (though not yet as councillors), and (a
very important matter) that it was their duty to be present, in
an official capacity, at all meetings of either House of
Parliament, whether they were members or not. Obviously this
latter practice was intended to give the King a hold over
Parliament. It resulted in giving Parliament a hold over the
King.</p>
<p>Thus politicians of all views held that the presence of the
Secretaries in Parliament was desirable. As Parliaments grew in
importance, the kings felt it to be almost impossible to govern
without an intimate knowledge of the temper of the House of
Commons upon important topics. The Parliament found it impossible
to criticize adequately the policy of the King, unless it had
daily opportunity of questioning and influencing at least some
officials actually engaged in carrying out that policy. But the
haughty jealousy which the victories of the Civil War had
developed in the temper of Parliament would brook no violation of
the rule of secrecy of debate; and it would have been impossible
for the King to have insisted on the presence in Parliament of
officials who were not members of either House. The result of the
feeling was that, after the Restoration, it became necessary to
appoint as Ministers of State men who actually occupied seats in
Parliament. At the same time, Clarendon made it an essential of
his policy that the Secretaries should not only be members of the
Privy Council, but <i>members of all committees of it</i>. Thus
the Secretary of State became an essential link between Council
and Parliament, as an official who necessarily knew the mind of
each. Thus, too, he became a part of the Cabinet system, which
depends for its very existence on the sympathy of Council and
Parliament. Thus, finally, the Secretary of State brought the
colonies into touch with the Parliament in a constitutional
way.</p>
<p>But at first the position of the Secretary of State was a
difficult one. He was primarily the King's servant, and bound to
keep the King's secrets. In the matter of foreign dependencies,
he was supposed to obey the King's chosen instrument of
government, the Council of Trade and Plantations. But, if the
King chose, he could withdraw any colonial matter from this
Council, which was merely an advisory committee appointed by
himself, and direct the Secretary to dispose of it in his office.
Thus there arose a dual control in England the Secretary of
State, rapidly passing under the control of Parliament, though
still, nominally, a royal official, and the Council of Trade and
Plantations, a purely official body. For a long time, the
division of business wavered; but the creation of a third
Secretary of State in the year 1768, with the exclusive control
of the colonies, narrowed the functions of the Council of Trade
in colonial matters to a minimum. Parliament had now, through the
Secretary for the Colonies, a definite hold on colonial business;
and the Council of Trade only claimed the right to interfere in
special cases. At the close of the American War, both the new
Secretary of State and the Council of Trade and Plantations were
abolished; and the remnant of colonial business was transferred
to the Home Secretary.* It was some time before Parliament could
be brought to realize that, after the loss of America, Great
Britain had any colonies at all; and this fact accounts for much
of the apathy which marks the early attitude of the Home
Government towards Australian affairs. For it was in this very
decade, which witnessed the abolition of the Secretary for the
Colonies and the Council of Trade, that Captain Phillip's
immortal expedition was undertaken. By the end of the century,
England had arrived at the conclusion that she still had
colonies, and, on the creation of a new third Secretary of State,
in the year 1801, he was named Secretary for War and the
Colonies. A few years later, the Government plucked up courage to
reconstitute the Council of Trade and Plantations, or, as it soon
came to be called, the "Board of Trade"; and, in due time,
Parliament voted its expenses. For by this time it had become
quite clear that Parliament, in granting George III an income in
return for the surrender of Crown Lands, had acquired the right
to control the colonies; and the House of Commons was no longer
afraid of Crown authority. The unhappy results of Parliamentary
interference in the American question had been patent; but the
Quebec Act of 1774 and the Canada Act of 1791 showed that
Parliament did not intend to relinquish its hold on the colonies.
Australia began life as a settlement in which the British
Parliament had a right (faintly enough exercised at first) to be
interested.</p>
<p class="foot">[* But a sort of ghost of the Colonial Office, in
a very attenuated condition, appears to have haunted the Home
Office during the amalgamation period.]</p>
<p>When, therefore, we say that, for the first sixty years of its
existence, New South Wales was a Crown Colony, we must be
understood to refer to the relations between the colony and the
mother-country, not to the relations between the Crown and the
Imperial Parliament. And it may be as well to state shortly here
the meaning of the expression. The title "Crown Colony" is used
as a technical phrase to indicate a foreign possession in which
the <i>administration</i> of public affairs (as distinct from
legislation and finance) is in the hands of officials appointed
by and accountable directly to the Colonial Office in London.
There may be, and are, various modifications of this state of
things; but if the Colonial Office appoints, either through the
Governor or in the name of the Crown, the actual office-holders
in the colony, the latter is said to be a "Crown colony". Where
the bulk of such officials are, both in law and in fact,
appointed by the independent action of the people of the colony,
the latter is said to have "Responsible Government"; and this is
so, even though a few of the officials, such as the military
commandant and the staff of the Mint, are actually appointed by
the Home authorities.</p>
<p>But, although British dependencies thus divide themselves
primarily into two great classes of Crown Colonies and colonies
with Responsible Government, it by no means follows that all in
the former class are in the same stage of political developement.
From the despotic government of a military station to the large
amount of self-government enjoyed by the Australian colonies on
the eve of the introduction of Responsible Government, there is a
great distance to travel, and we must now proceed to trace the
stages by which it was covered.</p>
<p>The circumstances in which New South Wales was originally
settled rendered it imperative that absolute power within the
limits of the colony should be entrusted to the early Governors.
The great bulk of the settlers had already forfeited their title
to the rights of free Englishmen. It was therefore deemed no
hardship that they should be left completely to the discretion of
their Governor. The only free settlers were Government officials
and soldiers; and it was their duty, in discharging their
offices, to obey implicitly the commands of their chief. Over the
latter there lay, of course, the hand of the Home Government;
and, though the greatness of the distance between Australia and
England rendered it difficult for complaints to be heard, it is
not certain that this inevitable difficulty operated less harshly
on the Governor than on his subjects. It is clear that, during
the first half century of Australian history, several Governors
were censured, and some practically removed, by the Home
Government upon the complaints of settlers; and it is more than
doubtful if those complaints were always well-founded.</p>
<p>For the first twenty-five or thirty years of Australian
history, then, the form of government was purely military. At
first the Governors were usually officers of the Royal Navy; for
the semi-maritime character of Sydney and the other penal
settlements,* and the apprehended danger of an attack by foreign
powers from the sea, appeared to render such a course desirable.
Somewhat later, the custom of appointing army officers was
introduced. Collins, Macquarie, Brisbane, Arthur, Darling, and
Bourke were all military men. The civilian Governor is rarely to
be met with before the year 1850. The powers, claimed and
exercised by the early Governors, of publishing General Orders on
their own authority, of interfering substantially with the
common-law rights even of freemen, of executing summary
punishment upon offenders, and the like, were all military in
their character, and were tolerated under the general plea of the
practical existence of a state of war between the authorities and
the convict settlers. The same military character is also
impressed upon the economic arrangements of the early settlers.
At first the whole community lived upon Government rations. The
Government supplied seed and tools for the farms, and took all
the settlers' produce at a fixed price. Often it engaged in
farming operations on its own account. Medicine and clothing were
dispensed from the Government offices. All the public works were
undertaken on the initiative and carried out under the
supervision of Government. This state of things lasted at least
until Macarthur shewed what could be done by individual
enterprise; and there can be little doubt that it has given a
powerful impulse to what is now called the State socialism of the
colonies. When the colonists took the administration into their
own hands, they found a Government machinery capable of being
used for all kinds of economic purposes, and a community long
accustomed to look to Government for help and direction in
economic enterprise. The natural result followed.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Hobart, Launceston, Port Macquarie, Port
Curteis, and Moreton Bay were all coast settlements.]</p>
<p>In no case, however, does the military character of the early
Australian settlements come out more clearly than in the
administration of justice. That the Governor should be the final
court of appeal in all cases was, perhaps, inevitable; but the
organization of the other tribunals was equally military in
character. The first ordinary Court of Justice in Australia was
appointed under an Imperial statute of the year 1787, and
consisted of a Judge-Advocate and six military or naval assessors
from time to time appointed by the Governor. This tribunal was
expressly authorized by the Letters Patent which created it, to
take notice of any criminal offences against the laws of England;
and thus English criminal law was implicitly introduced into
Australia. But it was also empowered to proceed without strict
regard to the technical rules of English law; and of this
permission it availed itself freely, with a result which would
hardly be deemed entirely satisfactory by those ardent reformers
who desire a similar relaxation in England. There does not appear
to have been any express provision in the statute of 1787 for the
creation of civil courts; but the Judge-Advocate's commission
empowered him to decide in civil cases, and he appears to have
acted upon their authority. In the year 1787, a Vice-Admiral's
Court was established by Letters Patent; but this was equally
military in character. In the year 1795, an Imperial statute
empowered the Lieutenant-Governor of Norfolk Island to hold a
criminal court on the model of that at Sydney, with only four
assessors. For a long time Tasmania had no separate Courts of
Justice; for, when the statute of 1787 was passed, Tasmania was
believed to be a part of the continent, and the wording of the
statute was deemed only to authorize the creation of tribunals on
islands adjacent to the eastern coast of Australia, whereas,
after Bass's discoveries, it was clear that Tasmania was an
island on the southern coast. Cases arising at Hobart and
Launceston were accordingly, to the great detriment of justice,
summoned for trial at Sydney; though it is difficult to see how
this course was less opposed to the wording of the statute than
the creation of a separate court would have been. But in 1821, on
the suggestion of Commissioner Bigge, Judge-Advocate Wyld
proceeded personally to Hobart, and held a court there in much
the same way as when an English judge goes on circuit.</p>
<p>In the year 1814, a distinct step in advance was taken, by the
creation of independent courts of civil jurisdiction. These were
of two kinds the "Supreme Court", which held sittings both in New
South Wales and Tasmania, and heard all cases involving more than
&pound;50, and the "Governor's Courts", one in New South Wales
and one in Tasmania, for the trial of less important cases. The
Supreme Court was composed of a professional judge, specially
appointed by His Majesty, and two magistrates appointed by the
Governor. The Court could proceed to business if the judge and
one magistrate were present. The first judge of the Supreme Court
was Charles Lamb's friend, Barron Field, who arrived at Sydney in
the year 1817, and by his high character did much to revive the
English respect for the administration of justice. So far as
possible, he framed the practice of the Supreme Court on English
models; but he had no jury to assist him, and the uncertainty as
to the extent to which English law was really binding in
Australia was very embarrassing. As a matter of practice, Mr
Justice Field used to allow all convicts to give evidence in his
court, and he permitted convicts not actually serving a sentence
to bring and defend actions; but he strongly opposed Governor
Macquarie's proposal to make such a practice positive law. It
does not appear that there was an overwhelming amount of business
awaiting the arrival of Mr Justice Field; but there was quite
enough to make it plain that the Supreme Court supplied a
substantial want, and perhaps, if the fees and expenses had been
less heavy, there might have been still more work to be done. And
there can be no doubt that the Supreme Court must have acted as a
powerful factor in the growth of a desire for free institutions;
for Mr Justice Field did not hesitate to oppose the Governor's
authority if he considered it to be illegally exercised. Thus,
though he usually respected the Governor's General Orders, and
treated them as part of the existing law, he declined altogether
to recognize ex post facto legislation; and he more than once
gave a decision against the Government in actions brought by the
Governor. It is true that, in cases where more than &pound;300
were involved, there lay an appeal from the Supreme Court to the
Court of Appeal, which consisted of the Governor and the
Judge-Advocate; but that Court would naturally shrink from
overruling the judgment of a professional judge, and, as a matter
of fact, appeals were rarely brought. There was a further
theoretical appeal to the Privy Council when the sum in dispute
exceeded &pound;3,000.</p>
<p>The Governor's Courts established by the Letters Patent of
1814 consisted, in New South Wales, of the Judge-Advocate and two
inhabitants appointed by the Governor, and, in Tasmania, of the
deputy Judge-Advocate and two inhabitants appointed by the
Lieutenant-Governor. Their jurisdiction was limited to cases of
the value of &pound;50 and under. In New South Wales the
Governor's Court held sittings quarterly, not only at Sydney, but
at Parramatta, Liverpool, and Windsor, if there were cases to be
tried; and a special monthly sitting was held for the disposal of
very small cases. Owing to the illness of the existing
Judge-Advocate, the first Governor's Court was not held until
1816, when it found great arrears awaiting it. Though the scale
of fees was at first high, it was afterwards reduced, and the
Court became very popular, the best proof of this assertion being
that suitors who had larger claims would try to split them up
into sums below &pound;50, in order to be able to use the
Governor's Court.</p>
<p>The weak spots in this judicial system were, obviously, the
absence of the jury element, and the dual position of the
Judge-Advocate. Whatever may be the defects of trial by jury, it
is fairly certain that the ordinary Englishman is not satisfied
to see criminal charges tried in any other way; and, in the
administration of the criminal law, it is perhaps more important
to secure public confidence than to dispense justice with
absolute accuracy. With regard to the Judge-Advocate, he
occupied, as his name implies, the incompatible offices of judge
and advocate. He had to set in motion Crown prosecutions, and, at
the same time, to act as judge of their validity. The weakness of
his position was made evident in one of the early <i>causes
cel&egrave;bres</i> of New South Wales, the prosecution by the
Rev. Samuel Marsden of Mr J. J. Campbell, the Colonial Secretary,
for an alleged libel published in the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>. As
the prosecution had (like all criminal prosecutions) to be
conducted in the name of the Crown, it was necessary to obtain
the consent of the Judge-Advocate to the filing of the
information. Rightly or wrongly, Judge-Advocate Wyld gave Mr
Marsden's advisers the impression that he was very reluctant to
sanction the proceedings; and it can hardly, therefore, have been
with unmixed confidence that they realized that at the trial the
same Mr. Wyld would be the presiding judge. As a matter of fact,
the evidence was clear, and Mr Campbell was found guilty; but the
weakness of the Judge-Advocate's position was none the less
obvious. Shortly after this occurrence, a special Commissioner
appointed by the Home Government visited the Australian
settlements, and made a special report upon the administration of
justice there, with the fortunate result that the two causes of
complaint just described were removed. It is, however, right to
point out that, from the earliest settlement of Australia, the
Governors had exercised the powers conferred upon them by their
commissions to appoint Justices of the Peace; and these
magistrates, besides exercising summary jurisdiction over the
convict class, acted to some extent as protectors of the accused
in the preliminary steps of proceedings in the higher criminal
courts. But the dependence of the Justices of the Peace on the
pleasure of the Government, and their general want of
professional knowledge, rendered their position unsatisfactory as
a bulwark against oppressive proceedings on the part of the
officers of the Crown.</p>
<p>Another important early institution of the Australian colonies
was the Executive Council. From the very first the Governors had
been assisted in their public duties by both civil and military
officials, appointed and paid by the Home Government. Phillip's
staff consisted of a Lieutenant Governor, a chaplain, a
provost-marshal, surgeons, and a Judge-Advocate; a treasurer, a
secretary, and a surveyor were soon added, and other officials
made their appearance as occasion arose. At first these officials
were purely ministerial. Though the Governor, doubtless,
consulted them freely upon the matters arising within their own
specific departments, they acted simply under his orders, and had
no official communication with one another. Legally speaking, no
opinion, however strong, as to the mischief likely to be produced
by one of the Governor's orders, would have justified an official
in disobeying it. The only remedy was an appeal to the Home
Government; and even in such a case the rule was strictly laid
down by the Colonial Office, that all communications with the
Home authorities must pass through the hands of the Governor,
although duplicates might, for safety, be sent by private
conveyance. The Governor could dismiss any official, but he could
only make temporary appointments, the Home Government reserving
the right of finally approving or rejecting his choice. At first
nearly all the officials were sent direct from England; but, long
before 1851, it had become the custom, except in the case of the
most important appointments, to allow the Australian Governors to
recommend local applicants, who were confirmed in their offices
by the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>Soon after New South Wales had settled down into industrial
developement, a more important step was taken. In the commissions
appointing the Australian governors, the latter were directed to
summon a few of the more important officials as an Executive
Council, and to consider their advice collectively given. The
Governor was not bound to follow the advice of his Council; he
was not even obliged to consult them if he thought the matter
required urgency and secrecy. He was still to be entitled to the
individual advice of the officials in matters falling within
their own departments. But the direction was a step of great
importance, for all that. If a Governor thereafter acted on his
own responsibility, without consulting his Council, he ran the
risk of a sharp rebuke from the Colonial Office for neglecting an
obvious precaution. And, by affording the principal officials a
constitutional opportunity of discussing together the general
affairs of the colony and of tendering independent and collective
advice, the institution of the Executive Council gave a powerful
impulse to the spread of a wholesome public opinion, which is one
of the essential pre-requisites of self-government. The fact that
the Council was composed almost, if not quite exclusively, of
office-holders, gave it a sense of responsibility and an
influence which a mere consultative committee can never possess.
The Council is the direct ancestor of the Cabinet of the modern
Australian colony; and it is a pity that, owing to a supposed
analogy with the English Privy Council, persons who are not
actually holding office should have been retained in some (though
not in all) of the Australian colonies, as members of the
Executive Council. Of course, as in England, non-official
councillors do not act, in ordinary circumstances. It is
conceivable, however, that in the colonies, where tradition is
not so strong as in England, non-official members might claim to
act in a case of overwhelming emergency. If they succeeded in
doing so, Cabinet government would be doomed.</p>
<p>The obscurity in which many of the early Australian records
still remain renders it difficult to say precisely when the
Executive Council was first established in Australia. It is
certainly as old as Sir Ralph Darling's period of office
(1825-1831), and it may very well have been in existence under
Sir Thomas Brisbane. It is probable, however, that in the early
days of its history it was not very frequently consulted.
Governor Bourke (1831-1837) appears to have only required a
formal session on important occasions, and, in ordinary cases, to
have recorded his interviews with the officials specially
concerned as the Minutes of the Executive Council. At least, this
is the impression which the Minutes convey. The Executive Council
was in existence from the foundation of the free colonies, such
as Western Australia and South Australia. The daughter-colonies,
Tasmania, Victoria, and Queensland, developed it at the moment of
separation.</p>
<p>The enquiry conducted by Commissioner Bigge, during Governor
Macquarie's term of office, was productive of great changes in
Australian government. These changes were embodied or authorized
in an Imperial statute of the year 1823. By the terms of this
enactment, the Crown was empowered to create new Supreme Courts,
each with a Chief Justice and (if necessary) two other judges,
for New South Wales and Tasmania; and this authority was
exercised in each colony in the same year by a Charter of Justice
and Letters Patent. The new Supreme Courts were to have
jurisdiction in all cases, civil and criminal, and even the power
of trying offenders for crimes committed in New Zealand * and
other places in the Pacific; but they were not expressly bound to
conform to English law, criminal trials were to be conducted by a
judge and seven military officers (instead of five as hitherto),
and civil actions by a judge and two magistrates appointed from
time to time by the Governor. But the officers in criminal trials
were to be open to challenge for interest or affection, and the
magistrates in civil cases for any cause for which a juror could
be challenged in England. Moreover, in civil actions at law, the
parties might, if they agreed to this course, have a jury of
twelve freeholders; and the Crown might extend the jury system as
it saw fit, by Order in Council. Also, there were to be courts of
Quarter Sessions both in New South Wales and Tasmania, with the
ordinary powers of such courts in England, and, in addition,
substantial powers of summary jurisdiction over convicts. And the
Governor was empowered to create local courts for the recovery of
claims not exceeding &pound;10, to be known as "Courts of
Requests", presided over by "Commissioners". On the other hand,
the power to appeal from the Supreme Court in ordinary cases was
limited to actions involving &pound;500 (instead of &pound;300),
unless the judge who tried the case should otherwise order; while
the constitution of the Court of Appeals was altered by the
substitution of the Chief Justice for the Judge-Advocate, in
association with the Governor.</p>
<p class="foot">[* New Zealand was not at this time a British
possession; but irregular settlements of British subjects
existed, and the settlers were practically under no control.]</p>
<p>This Act caused some disappointment by its very conservative
attitude with regard to trial by jury; but, in substituting the
work of civilian judges for the military jurisdiction of the
Judge-Advocate, it marked a great advance, while the substitution
of regular courts of Quarter Sessions for the arbitrary tribunals
of individual magistrates was an unquestionable boon to the
convict class. By an amending statute of the year 1828, English
law (statutes, decisions, and traditions), was introduced at one
swoop into the colony; and, though the very catastrophic method
of this change was productive of considerable difficulty, it put
an end to the previous unsatisfactory state of things, in which
the Governor's General Orders could virtually set aside the most
cherished maxims of English law. But, before the year 1828,
proper provision had been made for local legislation, adapted to
the special wants of the Australian colonies.</p>
<p>For the Act of 1823 had not only been concerned with the
administration of justice. It had provided for the establishment
of a Legislative Council to assist the Governor with its advice
in the making of ordinances for the good rule of the colony. The
Council was to consist of five, six, or seven members, at the
option of the Crown; and these members were all to be appointed
by the Colonial Office. The Council itself was to have no
initiative in legislation, nor could it, in cases of extreme
emergency, even prevent the Governor from legislating in
opposition to the views of every one of its members. But, on the
other hand, the Governor could not promulgate any Ordinance
without first laying it before the Council; and the dissentient
members were entitled to record their reasons for dissent on the
Minutes of the Council, which would, in due course, come under
the scrutiny of the Colonial Office. By a somewhat curious
proviso, it was laid down that no Ordinance should even be
proposed to the Council unless the Chief Justice had previously
certified that its terms were consistent with the laws of
England, "so far as the circumstances of the colony will admit".
The Chief Justice was therefore the absolute check on any
improper legislation by the Governor; bat the placing of colonial
Ordinances on a recognized footing, and the allowance of free
criticism by local councillors, were real steps in the direction
of self-government. The Crown of course reserved to itself a
final power to disallow colonial legislation.</p>
<p>In due course this scheme was carried into effect in New South
Wales by the appointment (in 1825) of seven councillors, of whom
four were Government officials, and three private settlers whose
names had been sent to the Secretary of State by Sir Thomas
Brisbane. It was obvious that such a Council, with its limited
powers, would not at first manifest any extreme opposition to the
Government; but, so strong is the instinct of Englishmen for
affairs, that, by continually suggesting to the Governor subjects
for legislation, and by freely discussing the details of money
bills, the Council very soon acquired a substantial position both
in legislative and administrative matters. The customs duties had
recently been regulated by a statute of the Imperial Parliament,
and the Land Fund was still jealously reserved by the Home
Government; but as the Council possessed power to levy taxes, and
as the Home Government ceased in 1827 to supply money for
carrying on the civil (as opposed to the penal) establishment,
the control of the general finances passed largely to the
Council. Similar machinery was established in Tasmania. This
colony, under a special section of the Imperial statute of 1823,
had been created a Lieutenant-Governorship, and, very shortly
afterwards, an independent Governorship, with a Supreme Court,
and Executive and Legislative Councils of its own. The other
Australian colonies did not exist in 1823.</p>
<p>In the year 1828 a further developement took place in the
machinery of government. An Imperial statute of that year, whilst
generally confirming the judicial arrangements of its
predecessor, abolished the anomalous Courts of Appeal, and
allowed litigants to appeal directly from the Supreme Court to
the English Privy Council in important cases. It also provided
for the institution of circuit courts, and it authorized the
Crown to delegate to the colonial legislatures the power of
extending the jury system both in civil and criminal matters.
With regard to legislation and administration, it empowered the
Crown to increase the Legislative Councils to fifteen members,
and it handed over to the local legislatures the control and
expenditure of the Customs revenue. Moreover, the Governor was no
longer to be allowed to override the opinion of a majority of his
Council in matters of legislation, nor was the absolute veto of
the Chief Justice retained. But, within fourteen days after the
passing of any Ordinance, the judges of the Supreme Court might
enter a formal protest against its validity, and refuse to enrol
it. Still, if the Council upon a review of the Ordinance adhered
to its determination, the Ordinance was to be deemed binding
until the pleasure of the Home Government should be known.</p>
<p>The statute of 1828 produced considerable changes in the
mother-colony of New South Wales, where the enlarged Legislative
Council exercised considerable influence, and where the jury
system was soon gradually introduced. Whilst the statute was in
force the new settlement at Port Phillip was founded (1835) and
its government organised under a Superintendent and a staff of
officials (1839). Local courts of Quarter Sessions (1838) and of
Requests (1839) were established by Proclamation from Sydney; but
the Governor of New South Wales retained actual control over the
administration at Melbourne. To Tasmania, by that time an
independent colony, the provisions of the Act of 1828 applied
equally with New South Wales. Western Australia (1829) and South
Australia (1834) began life, as we have seen, with nominee
Legislative Councils, similar to those existing at Sydney and
Hobart.</p>
<p>The next great landmark in the history of Australian
government is the year 1842. By an Imperial statute of that year
the principle of political representation was for the first time
introduced into Australia. The Australian colonies had by this
time obtained the right to regulate the administration of justice
by local enactment; the new statute was therefore, unlike its
predecessors, concerned almost wholly with legislation and
administration. It provided for the establishment in New South
Wales of a Legislative Council, not, as before, consisting wholly
of members appointed by the Crown, but of thirty-six members, of
whom twelve were to be appointed by the Crown, and twenty-four to
be elected by the colonists. The nominee members might hold their
seats for five years, except that, if they had been appointed as
holders of specified offices, they were to forfeit their seats
when they ceased to hold their offices. But not more than half
the nominated members were to be officials. The elected members
were to be qualified by the ownership of freeholds to the value
of &pound;100 a year, and they were to be elected by persons who
were either freeholders to the value of &pound;200 capital, or
were householders occupying premises worth &pound;20 a year. The
Legislative Council was to sit at least once a year, and not to
continue without a general election for more than five years;
nominee members were to vacate their seats upon a dissolution.
There were to be at least six elective members allotted to the
Port Phillip District (Victoria).</p>
<p>The Council thus constituted was to have power to legislate
for the colony in any manner "not repugnant to the laws of
England", and was to have entire control over the colonial
revenue (except the Land Fund), subject to a fixed annual
reservation of &pound;81,600, to be expended by the Governor in
maintaining the civil establishment, and in subsidizing public
worship. To shew that the Council was to have the real initiative
in matters of legislation, the statute empowered it to appoint a
Speaker, subject to the Governor's disallowance; but the
Governor, though he could not pass measures without the consent
of the Council, might insist on his proposals being discussed,
and he might refuse or withhold for the approval of the Home
Government any measures tendered to him for the Royal assent.</p>
<p>Before leaving the Constitution Act of 1842, it must be
mentioned that the statute contained an elaborate scheme for the
introduction of local government into the rural parts of New
South Wales, by the establishment of elective District Councils,
with considerable powers of local administration and legislation.
The scheme was well-intentioned, but it shewed an absolute
ignorance of the circumstances of the colony, and was a complete
failure. Under the provisions of the scheme, the District
Councils were to be liable for half the expenses of the police
force maintained within their districts. At the same time, they
were not given the control of the police force. Quite naturally,
the rural districts shewed great reluctance to be incorporated,
and, in spite of the honest efforts of Governor Gipps, the whole
plan resulted in a fiasco. Ten years later, more modest
beginnings were made in South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria,
where a scheme of road-making has gradually developed, on
thoroughly sound lines, into a general system of rural
self-government. Considerably later, a scheme for rural
municipalities was adopted in New South Wales; but the
mother-colony seems never to have entirely recovered from the
prejudice created against local government by the abortive
attempt of 1842.</p>
<p>So far as central government is concerned, the scheme of 1842
may be said to have been a success, at least in its main
principles. The idea was, evidently, to get as near the English
bi-cameral plan as possible, by including two distinct classes of
members in one chamber. By allowing the Legislative Council
itself to modify (under limitations) both its own constitution
and the franchise of its electors, the Home Government gave free
play to the growing democratic spirit of the colony. The fact
that the elective members always outnumbered the nominees by two
to one, rendered it impossible for the latter to carry a measure
in the teeth of an united public opinion, or to prevent the
passing of a measure which the general sentiment of the community
demanded. The disappearance of the Governor from the ordinary
meetings of the Council, and of the Government monopoly of
initiation, left the Council an opportunity to shape the policy
of the colony, and threw upon the Governor the whole onus of
refusing the Royal assent to a Bill carried in the Council. From
the colonists' point of view, the weak point of the scheme was
not so much the nominee members, as the position of the
Government officials. By the terms of the Constitution Act not
more than half the nominee seats might be held by officials; but
even this limitation always left six seats, which might be filled
by persons pledged to support, under all circumstances, the
Governor's administration, and whose conduct could never be
subjected to the effective criticism of popular election. The
emphatic refusal of the Home Government, in 1845, to permit its
salaried officials to accept elective seats in the Council, put
an end to an attempt to establish in a modified form the system
of "responsible government" under the Act of 1842, and left the
colonial Government much in the position of that of the German
Empire, whose members may be criticised and condemned, but not
ejected from office, by the popular assembly. It was, in fact, on
this principle, and on the reserves for the Civil List, that the
Home Government relied for the continuance of effective control
in matters of administration.</p>
<p>Although this result, when the significance of it finally
dawned upon the consciousness of the colony, provoked strong
criticism, it by no means follows that it was a bad result. It
gave the politicians of the colony a schooling in a modified form
of representative government, without throwing upon them the full
responsibilities of the Cabinet system. The fight over the Land
Sales Act, described elsewhere (pp. 69-71), is an eloquent
indication of what would have happened had the colonists
controlled the administration from 1842 to 1855. By the modified
constitution of 1842, the Land question was placed beyond their
reach; and there can be no manner of doubt that any other scheme
would have been disastrous to the future fortunes of the colony.
But perhaps the best tribute to the success of the constitution
of 1842 is the fact that it was extended, in the year 1850, to
the younger colonies of Tasmania and South Australia, which had
hitherto retained the purely nominee system, and to the
newly-created colony of Victoria, which, as the Port Phillip
District of New South Wales, had been partly under the operation
of the scheme of 1842.</p>
<p>Thus the Act for the better Government of Her Majesty's
Australian Colonies, passed in the year 1850, which closes the
period at present under review, practically put the three
colonies of South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria on the
political footing hitherto occupied by New South Wales alone. It
also contemplated the establishment of Western Australia, at some
future date, on a similar basis; but the required conditions were
not fulfilled by that colony till the year 1870. The statute of
1850 recognizes the broadening of the electoral franchise which
had been achieved in New South Wales under the permission
accorded in 1842. It hands over the imposition and expenditure of
the Customs revenue wholly to the colonial Governments, with the
simple reservations that no differential duties may be charged,
and that no customs may be levied on stores imported for the use
of English troops, nor in defiance of treaty obligations. It also
provides for the establishment of a Supreme Court in the new
colony of Victoria, in the place of the District Branch of the
Supreme Court of New South Wales which had hitherto done duty at
Melbourne. In other respects the scheme of 1842 was applied with
little variation. Certain elaborate administrative arrangements
were attempted by the Colonial Office, with a view of creating a
supremacy in the Governor of New South Wales over the other
Australian Governors. He was given the title of
"Governor-General", and made Governor of each of the four
colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and South
Australia; the actual administrators of the three latter colonies
being nominally reduced to the position of Lieutenant-Governors.
The Lieutenant-Governors, although communicating directly with
the Colonial Office, were directed also to communicate with the
Governor-General; and, no doubt, the Colonial Office hoped by
this scheme to pave the way for the future introduction of that
federal bond between the colonies which the legislators of 1850
expressly refused to create. But the attempt was altogether a
failure. On the retirement of Sir Charles Fitzroy from the
Governor-Generalship in 1855, the full title of Governor was
conferred on the rulers of the other colonies; and, though the
titular distinction of "Governor-General" was retained by the
Governors at Sydney till the year 1861, the title carried no real
power. Perhaps its most practical result was to cause the jealous
Victorians of 1853 to vote their Governor &pound;2,000 a year
more of salary than his nominal superior at Sydney. The real
effect of the statute of 1850, which came into actual operation
in the succeeding year, was to create, not a federal group with a
permanent leadership in the mother-colony, but a body of four
entirely independent colonies, equal in political status, but
steadily bent on an honourable rivalry in wealth and political
importance. Many changes have since taken place, but, until 1900,
this was still the position occupied by the Australian colonies
towards one another. The present is, therefore, a convenient
opportunity for breaking off the thread of Australian story, to
turn to the fortunes of the neighbouring settlements in New
Zealand.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<br>
<small>THE FOUNDING OF NEW ZEALAND.</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>IT</small> is difficult to know whether to write of New
Zealand as a colony or as a continent comprising several
colonies. On the one hand, it has never been without a political
unity. Ever since the proclamation of the Queen's sovereignty,
there has been one Governor to whom all authorities in the island
have been subordinate; whereas, as we have seen, the Australian
colonies were, legally speaking, long independent of one another.
And, in enumerating the Australasian colonies, it was for long
the custom to reckon New Zealand, along with New South Wales,
Victoria, Queensland, and the other members of the Australian
group, as a single community. On the other hand, when the history
of New Zealand comes to be examined, it is found to be the
history, not of a single homogeneous body, but of a group of more
or less connected bodies, each, for a time at least, enjoying a
large share of independence. This fact must always be borne in
mind in thinking of New Zealand.</p>
<p>The reports of Cook's companions, and the foundation of the
Australian settlements, combined to bring the islands of New
Zealand into notice at the beginning of the nineteenth century.
Long before any step was taken by Government towards recognizing
the existence of English claims, a casual, and, for the most
part, disreputable settlement of Europeans had taken place,
principally on the shores of the Bay of Islands, on the
north-east coast of the North Island. Here lived, in
half-piratical, half-patriarchal fashion, crews of shipwrecked
sailors, whale and seal fishers, escaped convicts from Australia,
and others of Ishmaelite character. Though the native Maoris were
fierce cannibals, they were a race of singular generosity and
amiability. So long as their prejudices were not offended, they
welcomed the white man or "Pakeha" (as they called him); and many
of them entered into close relationships with the European
settlers. Sometimes a white man went completely over to the Maori
civilization&mdash;for a civilization it unquestionably was was
adopted by a Maori chief, and lived the life of his hospitable
entertainers. Such a person received the title of "Pakeha Maori",
i.e. one who is both a white man and a Maori. Usually the Pakeha
Maori was a man of bad character, who caused endless trouble by
introducing European vices amongst his entertainers, and stirring
them up to war against those of the white settlers who retained
their own civilization. But occasionally an honourable specimen
was found; and his knowledge and influence were, of course,
invaluable in later times. The more legitimate occupations of the
early settlers were the cultivation of native flax, and the trade
in firearms with the Maoris, an intensely warlike race, who
eagerly coveted these superior weapons.</p>
<p>Strange tales of bloodshed and cruelty began to float across
the seas from New Zealand. Disputes between the white settlers
and the Maoris led to a ruthless feud between the races. One of
the most frequent causes of these disputes was the question of
land purchase; and as this cause was for many years one of the
prime factors in New Zealand history, it will be well to explain
it at once in a few words.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Maoris
occupied a stage in civilization somewhere between that of the
Australian aborigines and the inhabitants of Western Europe at
the close of the middle ages. They had emerged from the nomadic
stage occupied by the Australians, in which territorial rights
were almost unknown, and the land was thought little of because
it was put to little use. It had been comparatively easy for the
English Crown to maintain the calm assumption that the whole of
the soil of Australia was vested in it. It was impossible to
establish such a claim in New Zealand. Although private ownership
of land was unrecognized, tribal ownership was clearly denned.
When English settlement in New Zealand began, the whole of the
North Island at least (and part of the Middle Island) was
definitely parcelled out amongst the Maori tribes; and the
attachment of the tribe to its land was intense and indelible.
Not only was the tribe attached to its land by material
interests, by its "pahs" and villages, its skilfully cultivated
fields, and its rights of fishing and hunting; but also by the
tenderest ties of religion and sentiment. The shrines of his
gods, the burial places of his ancestors, the scenes of his
adventures by flood and field, each hill and stream celebrated in
legend and poetry, were to the Maori a sacred tie. Even forcible
expulsion by a hostile tribe did not bar his right. Not until the
whole tribe had solemnly renounced all intention to return to the
home of its fathers, was the title of the invader secure. The
failure to grasp this fact was a frequent source of trouble in
later days.</p>
<p>But, although the ownership of the tribe was indelible, the
right of the individual was only temporary. Every member of a
tribe was entitled to settle upon and cultivate some part of the
tribal land; no member could sell an inch of it (least of all to
a foreigner) without the consent of his tribe. An unworthy Maori
might be tempted to make a sale to a Pakeha trader, but, while
the Englishman hugged himself on his "conveyance" of thousands of
acres, obtained for a few muskets and beads, the seller's tribe
scoffed at the notion of being bound by such a transaction. It
was to them just what the attempt of an undergraduate to sell his
rooms in a college would be to us. Even the chief of a tribe
could not sell without his tribesmen's full consent. His "mana",
or jurisdiction, covered the tribal territory; but the Maori
distinguished between sovereignty and ownership as clearly as an
English lawyer could do. He was far more than a match for the
ignorant settler in subtlety and logical power; and, doubtless,
the disappointment with which the early colonists realized that
the Maori chiefs could not be disposed of like children, had much
to do with their attitude towards the native race.</p>
<p>The rumours before alluded to stirred up the desire of earnest
spirits in Australia and England for missionary effort. Foremost
amongst these was the Rev. Samuel Marsden, colonial chaplain at
Parramatta, New South Wales, the hero of the libel case alluded
to in the last chapter, who, in the year 1814, fitted out a brig,
<i>The Active</i>, in which he came to New Zealand, accompanied
by two missionaries, and founded a mission station. The Church
Missionary Society of England and other religious bodies followed
his example; and thus the first reputable European element was
introduced. The success of the missionaries was remarkable. The
Maoris were intensely religious and affectionate; and the
influence of the missionaries soon became very great. Indeed it
seemed at one time that New Zealand would develope on much the
same lines as Prussia in the thirteenth century, as an
agricultural community guided and governed by religious
enthusiasts of an alien race. But the presence of the Pakeha
rendered such a result impossible; and the secular arm had to be
called in. Governor Macquarie, of New South Wales, had been urged
by Marsden to put a stop to the outrages of the white settlers,
and, in the year 1814, he actually appointed magistrates to
reside in New Zealand, although, as a matter of fact, his
commission as Governor did not then include the Maori islands. In
the year 1817 a more decisive step was taken. By an Imperial
statute of that year, all offences committed by persons forming
part of the crew or passengers of any British ship, in any
territory not belonging to an European power or to the United
States of America, might be tried and punished in any colonial
court having Admiralty jurisdiction, just as though such offences
had been committed at sea. This statute, in which New Zealand was
expressly named, gave the Governor of New South Wales power to
deal promptly with offences committed in New Zealand by the
Pakehas, who had, most of them, arrived in British ships. But it
set up no local jurisdiction, nor did it profess in any way to
deal with the Maoris directly. In fact, the statute is careful to
disclaim any attempt to set up British sovereignty in New
Zealand. Its provisions were repeated in the Act of 1823, which
created a Legislative Council in New South Wales; and
jurisdiction over offences committed in New Zealand was thereby
conferred upon the Supreme Courts of New South Wales and
Tasmania. But it should be noted that the Act of 1823 expressly
limits jurisdiction over the settlers (as distinct from persons
acting as part of a ship's crew) to <i>British subjects</i>; and
this limitation had its meaning.</p>
<p>For, in the year in which the statute was passed, a curious
Frenchman, who styled himself Baron de Thierry, proposed to buy
from the natives a block of land at Hokianga, on the west coast
of the North Island, nearly opposite to the Bay of Islands on the
eastern shore. Like Batman and his friends at the founding of
Port Phillip, some dozen years later, he appears to have thought
that he could set up an independent "sovereignty", at the same
time obtaining the advantages of British protection. But the
Colonial Office thought otherwise, and expressly disclaimed all
political connection with New Zealand. Thierry then turned to
France, and, though at first received with derision, he appears
finally to have made some impression. There is little doubt that
the French Government was, in 1824, less indifferent than the
English to the advantages of New Zealand; and, though Thierry was
too contemptible an agent to be recognised, a possible French
colonization of New Zealand was not lost sight of. About fifteen
years later, two French companies, the "Nanto-Bordelaise", and
the "Compagnie Fran&ccedil;aise de la Nouvelle Z&eacute;lande",
were formed to promote this object; the basis of settlement being
an alleged purchase of land at Akaroa, near Christchurch, in the
Middle Island, by one Langlois, a French whaler. Though the
expedition was unsuccessful in claiming the sovereignty of the
Akaroa Peninsula, it effected a settlement, of which there are
traces to this day; and its land claims were ultimately bought up
by the New Zealand Company.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, many things had happened. As the
result, probably, of Thierry's attempts, a colonization society,
under the patronage of Lord Durham, was formed in England in the
year 1825; and, in the following year, some of the society's
emigrants, under Captain Herd, reached New Zealand, where they
proposed to purchase lands in the north. They did, in fact, make
a few purchases, which were ultimately bought up by the New
Zealand Company of 1839; but very few of them remained to
settle.</p>
<p>The real beginning of English rule in New Zealand occurs in
the year 1833, when Mr James Busby, an official appointed by the
Colonial Office in London, arrived in the capacity of Resident
Magistrate at the Bay of Islands. As the British Government still
declined to recognize in New Zealand a dependency of the Crown,
Busby's position was anomalous; and he was frankly informed by
Lord Goderich, the Secretary of State, and by Governor Bourke,
his immediate superior, that he had very little legal power. But
it was understood that he was to do his best to put a stop to the
scandalous outrages, both by Europeans and Maoris, which were
exciting indignation in England. Aided by the presence of H.M.S.
<i>Alligator</i>, whose captain, however, did more harm than good
by an ill-considered revenge taken for the detention of a
shipwrecked crew at Taranaki, Busby succeeded in maintaining a
semblance of order. He was cordially supported by the
missionaries, without whose knowledge and influence he could have
done nothing. He just managed to keep the British name in
evidence till the arrival of the New Zealand Company's immigrants
in 1839.</p>
<p>For, despite the ill success of Herd's attempt in 1826, the
idea of New Zealand colonization was steadily growing in the
English mind. From the year 1835 to the year 1847 there are
traces of an English Association which attempted a settlement on
the west coast of the North Island, about the Manukau river, on
land alleged to have been purchased from the Maoris before the
Proclamation of 1839 (to be hereafter alluded to). In the year
1837, Edward Gibbon Wakefield and his family, whose names are so
conspicuous in New Zealand history, threw themselves heartily
into the project; and, though their first attempt was a failure,
the New Zealand Company was successfully floated in the year 1839
for the colonization of New Zealand, and a supplementary
Association soon after, to further the objects of the principal
society. Though the company did not obtain its charter until
1841, it immediately sent out settlers in the ship <i>Tory</i>,
and alleged itself to have purchased large tracts of lands from
the Maoris in the neighbourhood of Cook's Strait, both at Petone
in the Hutt valley (where the first settlement was made), and at
Te Aro (later known as Wellington) on the western shores of Port
Nicholson.</p>
<p>But the activity of the company's settlers had at last roused
the Government to decided action. The authorities of New South
Wales had a reasonable fear that, if a private company were
allowed to deal directly with the Maoris, it might afterwards
prove difficult to bring the settlers under Government authority.
Accordingly, in the year 1839, Governor Gipps' Commission was
altered so as to include New Zealand, and he at once proclaimed
the latter territory as within his jurisdiction. Shortly
afterwards he announced that the Crown had appointed Captain
Hobson, a naval officer long familiar with Australasian waters,
to be Lieutenant-Governor of the new colony. At the same time,
Governor Gipps shewed his appreciation of the situation by also
proclaiming that Her Majesty's Government would not recognize any
claim to land bought from the Maoris without the sanction of the
Crown. Lieutenant-Governor Hobson arrived in New Zealand in
January, 1840, and found at once that he had entered upon a
position of no ordinary difficulty.</p>
<p>To begin with, although Great Britain had, by the Proclamation
of the previous year, practically assumed sovereignty over New
Zealand, it was obvious that the Maoris must either be forcibly
conquered, or won over to acknowledge British claims. They were
<i>de facto</i> in possession; they could not possibly be
ignored. To have effected a forcible conquest would probably have
been beyond the power of any forces which the British Government
were likely to spare for such a purpose. But the iniquity of such
a plan would have been greater than its difficulty. It was
necessary to use persuasion.</p>
<p>In this task Governor Hobson succeeded beyond his hopes.
Thanks to the efforts and influence of the English missionaries,
thanks also to the chivalrous and trustful character of the
Maoris, the Governor succeeded almost immediately in procuring
the recognition of the Queen's sovereignty over a large part of
the North Island. One effect of the irregular occupation by
Europeans which had prevailed in the previous few years had been
to unite several formerly independent and isolated Maori tribes
into a sort of loose confederation, which produced some semblance
of a Maori nation. On the 6th February, 1840, the heads of this
confederation, together with many chiefs of independent tribes,
signed a document known as the Treaty of Waitangi, by which they
ceded to Her Majesty all the "rights and powers of sovereignty"
which they exercised or possessed, or might be supposed to
exercise or possess, in New Zealand. In return for this
surrender, Her Majesty guaranteed "to the chiefs and tribes of
New Zealand, and to the respective families and individuals
thereof" all their possessory and proprietary rights in their
"lands, estates, forests and fisheries", with the proviso that,
if the proprietors of any lands were disposed to alienate them,
Her Majesty should have the exclusive right of pre-emption at
prices to be agreed upon. And Her Majesty extended "to the
natives of New Zealand "her protection", and all the rights and
privileges of British subjects".</p>
<p>This treaty was signed by the Lieutenant-Governor on behalf of
the Crown, and by forty-six principal Maori chiefs, in the
presence of about 500 inferior chiefs. Many other signatures were
afterwards obtained; and, on the 21st May, 1840, Hobson felt
justified in proclaiming the sovereignty of the Queen over the
whole of the islands of New Zealand. The British title to the
North Island he expressly placed upon the basis of the Treaty of
Waitangi; as to the other islands, he gave no reasons. His
proceedings were hurried by the rival claims of the New Zealand
Company (to be hereafter noticed); and his official superior,
Governor Gipps, deemed it imperative to anticipate the company's
demands. There was some pretext for claiming the Middle Island
not by "discovery" (as Gipps put it), for discovery confers no
title but by occupation, for there were very few Maoris in the
Middle Island; and, as a matter of fact, very little trouble ever
arose with regard to Maori rights there. The proprietary rights
of the few tribes which claimed a settlement in the Middle Island
were bought up in the year 1848.</p>
<p>A word must here be said as to the Waitangi treaty, for it is
the corner-stone of New Zealand history. The document, as it
stands, is perfectly clear; its meaning is unmistakeable. The
Maoris cede their political, but reserve their proprietary
rights. Moreover, they bind themselves to give the Queen's
Government the first right to purchase all the land which they
may choose to sell. Now, had the Maoris themselves afterwards
protested that they did not understand the meaning of the
document, such a protest must have received careful attention;
for the treaty was drawn up by British officials, and put forward
by duly accredited British representatives, while the Maoris
merely did what they were asked to do. But, as a matter of fact,
the Maoris at least all those of any importance always clung to
the Treaty of Waitangi as their sheet-anchor. They proved beyond
a suspicion of doubt that they fully realized the distinction
between sovereignty and property; to use their own emphatic
expression, they had "given up the shadow and retained the
substance". It was the actual proposers of the bargain, the
British Government and the settlers whom it represented, who
strove afterwards to upset the Treaty of Waitangi. Disgusted,
apparently, to find that the Maoris were not the ignorant and
easily gullible savages they had hoped to find, the European
settlers were constantly urging their Government to regard the
"so-called Treaty of Waitangi" as a mere plaything devised for
the amusement of grown-up children. In effect, they contended
either (1) that the Maori titles must be construed according to
English land law&mdash;a grotesque interpretation of a perfectly
intelligible sentence, or (2) that the Maoris must be compelled
to give up those very rights which the treaty expressly
guaranteed to them, of selling their land when they pleased and
only when they pleased&mdash; which would have been sheer
stealing. It may well be that a person who has been tricked into
a disadvantageous bargain has a moral claim to relief; but to
pretend that the Maori chiefs tricked the British Government into
the bargain of 1840, or even that the bargain was not, at that
time, distinctly favourable to British interests, is palpably
absurd.</p>
<p>Hobson's next care was to deal with the settlers at Port
Nicholson. They claimed to have purchased large tracts of land
from the Maoris at Petone and Te Aro (afterwards Wellington)
before hearing of Gipps' proclamation on the subject of lands.
The Petone purchase appears to have been undisputed by the
Maoris; but the purchase at Te Aro was long the source of
trouble. The Port Nicholson settlers, aided by the powerful
friends of their company at home, began to make trouble for the
Governor, and soon demonstrated the folly of the Home Government
in allowing New Zealand to begin under dual control. They
actually began to organize an independent government, in defiance
of the officials in the north; but their political efforts were
promptly put down. In August of 1840 Governor Gipps, in spite of
strong opposition, passed through the Legislative Council at
Sydney a colonial Act setting aside all titles in New Zealand
acquired from the Maoris, and appointing Commissioners to enquire
into the circumstances of alleged purchases. This Act was
ultimately disallowed by the Home Government, not because its
policy was disapproved of by the Colonial Office, but because the
intended separation of New Zealand from New South Wales rendered
it unwise that the latter colony should seem to legislate for the
former. It was, however, regarded as in operation for a few
months in New Zealand, and although, under great pressure, Gipps
consented to recognize the purchase by the New Zealand Company of
110,000 acres at Port Nicholson, he emphatically refused to
sanction purchases alleged to have been made by the Wakefields
elsewhere. In September of 1840, Lieutenant-Governor Hobson
negotiated with the Maoris the purchase of land at Waitemata, on
the narrow neck between the Manukau Harbour and the Hauraki Gulf.
Here he founded a town, to which he gave the name of Auckland,
and hither he transferred the seat of government from the Bay of
Islands. The site of Auckland was in some respects admirable for
its original purpose, for it afforded easy access by sea to both
the east and the west coasts of the North Island, while it
commanded the land approaches from the south to the early
settlements about the Bay of Islands and Hokianga. But, as
settlement pushed further south, it was found to be too far from
the geographical centre of New Zealand; and ultimately, in the
year 1865, the seat of government was again removed to
Wellington, which had exchanged its native name of Te Aro for the
title which it at present bears, just about the time that
Auckland was founded.</p>
<p>In August, 1840, the Imperial Parliament passed the statute
which gave separate existence as a British colony to New Zealand.
It was an Act for the ostensible purpose of continuing the
existing political arrangements in New South Wales and Tasmania;
but, incidentally, it empowered Her Majesty to separate from the
former colony any islands which might then or at any future time
be dependent upon it. The proceeding was a little disingenuous.
By a mere administrative direction, New Zealand had, in the
previous year, been included in the jurisdiction of New South
Wales. Now Parliament was asked formally to sanction the
severance of the tie, and, thereby, implicitly to admit that its
creation had been regular.</p>
<p>In pursuance of the statute, Letters Patent, dated 16th
November, 1840, constituted the islands of New Zealand a separate
colony, and changed Hobson's title to that of Governor. During
the passage of the measure through the House of Lords, the Earl
of Ripon had made the rather startling suggestion that Her
Majesty had power to grant constitutions to new colonies without
Parliamentary authority; but the Government preferred to take
express powers in the Act. The Letters Patent now accordingly
created a Legislative Council, consisting of the Governor and at
least six other persons to be named or designated by the Colonial
Office; and accompanying Instructions (5 Dec. 1840) designated
the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, and
the three senior Justices of the Peace in the colony, as members
of the first Legislative Council. But no matter was to be
discussed by the Council unless proposed by the Governor; and no
enactment, except for the purpose of raising annual supplies, or
in case of emergency, was to operate without the express sanction
of the Colonial Office. It will be seen, then, that the first
Legislature of New Zealand was even more limited in its powers
than the first Legislature of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The Letters Patent and Instructions of 1840 also created an
Executive Council, consisting of the three officials before
alluded to, and directed the Governor, with the advice and
consent of his Executive Council, to proceed to map out the
colony into counties, hundreds, and parishes, on the English
model, and, after making due reserves for native purposes, to
sell Crown lands at a uniform price, with a limit of one square
mile to any purchaser. There was also the same mischievous
provision which caused so much trouble in Australia, to the
effect that intending emigrants might pay their purchase money in
England, and select on arrival in the colony the number of acres
specified in their land certificate. For some unexplained reason
the Letters Patent changed the titles of the North, Middle, and
Stewart's Island into "New Ulster", "New Munster", and "New
Leinster" respectively.</p>
<p>New Zealand affairs now began to develope rapidly. Three
months after the issue of Hobson's commission as Governor, the
New Zealand Company received its first Charter (12th Feb. 1841).
The company was incorporated for the purpose of "purchasing and
acquiring, settling, improving, cultivating, letting, selling,
granting, alienating, mortgaging, charging or otherwise dealing
with and making a profit of lands, tenements, and hereditaments
in our said colony." Its capital was to be &pound;300,000 in
&pound;25 shares, of which two-thirds were to be paid up within
twelve months, on pain of forfeiture of its charter. The
company's affairs were to be managed by a Court of Proprietors,
voting in proportion to the number of shares held by its members,
and a Court of Directors elected by the proprietors; but the
directors were entitled to appoint agents and local boards in the
colony. The Company was to receive from the Crown a free grant of
one acre of land for every five shillings proved to have been
expended by it in colonization.</p>
<p>It has been necessary to give so much detail of the
constitution of the New Zealand Company, inasmuch as its
pretensions, and the difficulties arising out of them, form the
staple of New Zealand history for the next ten years. It was
beyond all question a company established on a purely commercial
basis; and, whatever the aims and hopes of some of its promoters,
it could claim to be treated neither as an independent authority
nor as a philanthropic association.</p>
<p>The arrival of Governor Hobson's Commission and Instructions
in the colony produced prompt action. In May, 1841, the new
status of the colony was formally proclaimed, and an Executive
and a Legislative Council were called into existence in
accordance with the terms of the Letters Patent and Commission.
The Legislative Council at once held a session, and, on the 9th
June, passed a Crown Lands Ordinance on the lines of the New
South Wales project of Governor Gipps. A Commission was to be
appointed to investigate claims, and no titles were to be allowed
until approved by the Government. But the Government, on the
recommendation of the Commissioners, might approve purchases
previously made from the Maoris, and, in such a case, the title
of the purchaser was to date from the original purchase. There
lay the weak spot of the Ordinance; it offered a strong
temptation to speculators to cajole or coerce Maori occupiers
into sales, hoping for ultimate confirmation from the Crown.</p>
<p>In other respects Government was not idle. Quarter Sessions,
to be held at Auckland, Wellington, and Russell, were proclaimed;
Petty Sessions at times and places appointed by the Governor.
Courts of Requests (replaced in the following year (1842) by
County Courts) were established for the recovery of small civil
debts. In November, 1841, Auckland was formally proclaimed the
capital of the colony; and the arrival of a Chief Justice
(Martin) and an Attorney-General (Swainson), about the same time,
prepared the way for further developements. As the first act of
the session of 1842, a Supreme Court was established by colonial
ordinance, with a provision for the trial of all questions of
fact by a jury. Five years later, the Governor and Executive
Council were constituted a Court of Appeals from the decisions of
the Supreme Court on questions of law.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the work of colonization proceeded actively under
the auspices of the New Zealand Company. The settlement at
Auckland enjoyed all the <i>prestige</i> of a seat of Government,
and all the safety ensured by the presence of British troops. But
no one was specially concerned in developing its material
resources. The New Zealand Company's agents, on the other hand,
were all energy. At the close of the year 1840, an association
had been formed at Plymouth, in England, for the purpose of
effecting a separate settlement in New Zealand; but the New
Zealand Company promptly bought it up, and attempted to settle
its colonists upon land which they claimed by purchase from the
natives at Taranaki (then named New Plymouth) and Wanganui, on
the west coast of the North Island. Very shortly afterwards, the
same company established the first settlement in the Middle
Island, at Blind Bay, to which they gave the name of Nelson.
These settlements were effected in direct defiance of the
principle that negotiation with the Maoris for land should only
proceed through the Crown; and the Taranaki and Wanganui
purchases, at any rate, were productive of infinite trouble and
danger. Nevertheless, the pressure put upon Government by the
Company was so great, that the Governor, in September, 1841,
still further relaxed in its favour the Crown's right of
pre-emption, and increased the allowance of 110,000 acres, made
by Governor Gipps, to nearly double that amount, including land
at Wellington, Taranaki, and Wanganui. The easy terms upon which
the company obtained its lands naturally operated unfavourably
upon the Government settlers at the Bay of Islands, who could not
hope to compete with the attractions which it offered.
Accordingly, although the Governor endeavoured, by judicious
division of the Crown lands into small lots, and by the
establishment of a Land Registry and other improvements in title,
to prevent further distribution of the population amongst the
company's settlements, he found his efforts unavailing. As a last
resource, he passed an Ordinance reducing the price of Crown
lands to that at which the company obtained its grants in
England, viz. five shillings an acre; but the Ordinance was
promptly disallowed by the Home Government; and, in November,
1842, the proclamation of the Australian Crown Land Sales Act put
a stop (in theory) to any further disposal of Crown lands at less
than &pound;1 an acre. But Governor Hobson did not live to make
this proclamation. After an heroic struggle to perform his most
difficult task in the face of overwhelming physical weakness, the
first Governor of New Zealand died at his post in September,
1842.</p>
<p>Governor Hobson's death placed the temporary administration of
New Zealand in the hands of the Colonial Secretary, Lieutenant
Shortland; and he, naturally, desired so far as possible to keep
things <i>in statu quo</i> until the arrival of a new Governor.
But matters were in a stage too acute to permit of inaction; and
Shortland soon found himself in a most difficult position.
Notwithstanding that the Crown Land Commissioner appointed under
the ordinance of 1841 had not certified in favour of the
purchase, Captain Wakefield, the New Zealand Company's agent at
Nelson, insisted on proceeding with the survey of some land which
he professed to have bought from the Maoris on the banks of the
river Wairau. The proceeding was excessively dangerous; for the
Wairau is a river of the Middle Island which debouches in Cloudy
Bay, several hundred miles from the then seat of government at
Auckland. Two Maori chiefs, Rauparaha and Rangihaeta, asserted
that the land in question never had been and never would be sold
by the Maoris; and, by way of protest against the survey, burnt
down a surveyor's hut, first carefully removing the contents from
it. If the contention of the chiefs was sound, they had done no
more than they were strictly entitled to do. Till they were
proved to be wrong in their assertion of title to the land, they
could not, with any justice, be treated as criminals. They had
shed no blood, and effected no wanton destruction of
property.</p>
<p>Most unadvisedly, Mr Thompson, the police magistrate at
Nelson, issued a warrant for the apprehension of the chiefs, and
himself proceeded with Captain Wakefield and a body of forty
settlers (most of them armed) to execute it. The chiefs were soon
discovered, but they declined to surrender. While the parley was
proceeding, a shot, fired by one of the English party, struck a
Maori woman the wife of one of the chiefs and the daughter of the
other. In after days it was urged, and possibly with truth, that
the shot was accidental. But it could hardly be expected that
brave men, whose passions had already been aroused, would stop to
weigh such an improbable alternative in the exciting
circumstances of the moment. The fact seems indisputable, that
the first shot came from the English. The Maoris then poured a
volley into the arresting party. Nineteen white men, including
Wakefield, were killed; the Maoris only lost four of their
number.</p>
<p>This incident sent a thrill through the whole islands, and
profoundly stirred the minds of Maori and white man. A little
further indiscretion, and a war of races would have ensued, which
could only have resulted in the massacre or the expulsion of
every European settler. Happily, the Acting Governor was firm.
Every investigation which he made led him more firmly to the
conclusion that the white men had been the aggressors. Whilst he
expressed sympathy with the relatives of the slain settlers, and
took steps to protect the southern settlements from danger by the
despatch of troops under Major Richmond to Wellington, he firmly
declined to attempt any vengeance against Rauparaha and
Rangihaeta. He was supported in his opinion by the Chief Justice,
the Attorney-General, and by Mr Spain, the special Crown Land
Commissioner sent out by the Imperial Government. Rauparaha
willingly met the latter, and explained his position. The Maoris
were once more assured that the Treaty of Waitangi would be
respected, and that no claims to lands by white settlers would be
allowed till they had been thoroughly investigated by a Crown
Commissioner. To the assertion of Colonel Wakefield, the New
Zealand Company's agent at Wellington, that the company's title
to the land on which his brother was slain "had not been proved
to be invalid", the Acting Governor forcibly replied that Colonel
Wakefield totally mistook the situation. The question was, not
whether the company's title had been proved to be invalid, but
whether a claim which was, <i>primâ facie</i>, in positive defiance of
treaty rights, a colonial ordinance, and an Imperial
proclamation, had been proved, as the result of exceptional
circumstances, to be capable of support.</p>
<p>Unhappily, Lieutenant Shortland's successor, Captain Fitzroy,
who arrived in the colony at the close of the year 1843, was much
less resolute. Though he held an enquiry at Waikanae concerning
the Wairau incident, and formally announced to the Maori chiefs
his intention not to take further proceedings to avenge the
deaths of the white men, he was prevailed upon to tamper with the
sound rule which prohibited direct purchases of land from the
Maoris. In March, 1844, he published what was long known as the
"ten shillings an acre proclamation", sanctioning direct
purchases from the natives, subject to approval by the Government
and payment to the latter of ten shillings an acre by the
purchaser. In October of the same year he waived the ten
shillings fee, substituting a nominal payment of one penny an
acre in acknowledgement of the Crown's rights. This last
announcement, known as the "penny an acre proclamation" was a
clear evasion of the Land Sales Act of 1842, and gave rise to
infinite trouble. Alleged purchasers of land started up on all
sides. The New Zealand Company's Report of 1844, whilst admitting
that only some 230,000 acres had been disposed of to settlers,
claimed the ownership of nearly four times that amount. An
extensive claim at Wairarapa, near Wellington, and another on the
Waitara, in Taranaki, led to further agitation among the Maoris;
and in the troubles which ensued Governor Fitzroy was recalled.
He was succeeded by a man whose period of office had just proved
epoch-making in the history of South Australia, and whose reign
in New Zealand was to be equally important in the history of that
colony. Captain George Grey arrived in New Zealand in November,
1845, and at once took up the reins of government.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br>
<br>
<small>DEVELOPEMENT OF NEW ZEALAND.</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>LETTERS PATENT</small> of the 21st June, 1845, had
appointed Captain Grey Lieutenant-Governor of the islands of New
Zealand. It is not quite clear why the Home Government reverted
to the more modest title, after conferring an independent
Governorship on Hobson and Fitzroy. Possibly, the attempt to form
an united executive for Australia, subsequently brought forward
in 1850, was even in 1845 contemplated by the Secretary of State
for the Colonies. But nothing came of it in New Zealand. Captain
Grey had no time for a personal interview with the authorities in
Downing Street. He came in hot haste from South Australia, and,
from the moment of his arrival, exercised the full powers of a
Colonial Governorship.</p>
<p>The outlook was not promising. The European settlers were
suffering from an attack of that economic depression which seems
to visit all new colonies when the initial expenditure of capital
ceases to provide abundant work at high rates. The late Governor,
Fitzroy, had issued Government debentures to a large amount, for
the purpose of tiding over the depression. The Home Government
had flatly refused to sanction this proceeding; but Fitzroy was
so scared by the prospect of publishing the disallowance in the
colony, that he suppressed it altogether. Grey was less timid. He
made a great effort to repay part of the indebtedness from
colonial funds, and arranged for the postponement of the
remainder. At the same time, he boldly published the decision of
the Colonial Office.</p>
<p>Then he turned to the north, where the Maoris were in open war
against the whites. The cause of quarrel was the standing trouble
about the land. Fitzroy's foolish Proclamations had, as might
have been expected, given rise to any number of disputed claims.
English settlers, firmly convinced that the land system with
which they were familiar was the only possible system, insisted
upon purchases from individual Maoris, which the tribal chiefs
would not recognize. Foolish speeches made by the friends of the
New Zealand Company in England, especially speeches made in
Parliament, excited the alarm of the Maoris. It may seem
astounding that the Maoris should watch English Parliamentary
debates. Yet it is certain that such was the case. And,
unfortunately, intelligent and quick of apprehension as they
were, the Maoris did not fully realize the complete emptiness of
Parliamentary talk, or the exigencies of party warfare. When they
found that the chiefs who took part in the affair of the Wairau
had been characterized as murderers in the House of Commons, when
they heard that in the same place there had been read a document,
emanating from an official of the New Zealand Company, in which
the Treaty of Waitangi was described as a "praiseworthy device
for amusing and pacifying savages for the moment", they took
these things seriously. They did not realize that the main object
of the Company's champions in the English Parliament was, not to
hurt the Maoris, but to oust the Government from Downing Street.
But they did realize very clearly, that an association of
Englishmen, which had its resident representatives in New
Zealand, was bent on treating the Maori land-titles as shadows
which could not be allowed to impede the march of what these
agents were pleased to call a superior civilization.</p>
<p>Governor Grey saw the importance of the crisis, and proceeded
to act at once. He first solemnly announced that, whatever the
foolish talk of irresponsible persons, Her Majesty's Government
had no intention whatever of impugning the Treaty of Waitangi. He
then took steps to prevent the importation of firearms for sale
to the Maoris. By appointing Maori chiefs to offices of trust
under the English Government, he prevented an united rising of
the natives. Then, after a short but sharp campaign, Colonel
Despard defeated the persistently hostile chiefs, largely by the
help of Maori allies. The war at the Bay of Islands was over
before the end of January, 1846. There was an attack on the
settlements near Wellington in May, but no general rising. Some
rather harsh justice was meted out to prominent chiefs; but a
healing measure was the appointment, by ordinance of 1846, of
Resident Magistrates specially charged with the administration of
justice in matters in which Maoris were concerned. The most
startling provision of the Ordinance is that which authorizes a
Resident Magistrate, in the case of a Maori charged with theft,
to allow the delinquent to pay four times the value of the goods
and obtain his discharge. In civil suits between Maoris the
Magistrate is to be assisted by two Maori assessors, one
appointed by each party; and no judgment is to be given till the
Court is unanimous.</p>
<p>Relieved from the pressure of war, the Governor turned to deal
with the great source of trouble, the Land Question. He issued a
notice in June, 1846, to the effect that he declined any longer
to act upon Governor Fitzroy's Proclamations, which allowed
direct purchase from the Maoris. Settlers who claimed to have
purchased under the "ten-shillings an acre proclamation" must
send in their claims at once. Those who claimed under the "penny
an acre proclamation" might send in their papers; but these would
not be further considered until the pleasure of the Home
Government was known. A stringent Ordinance of November 1846
subjected any person purchasing or occupying land from or under a
Maori title to a fine varying between &pound;5 and &pound;100;
and an almost contemporary enactment provided for a commission to
investigate claims made under the first proclamation. But, even
if the claimant made good his title, he might be compelled to
accept compensation from the Treasury instead of a grant of his
actual land.</p>
<p>Unhappily, things in England went against this wise policy. In
June, 1846, the friends of the New Zealand Company came into
office with Lord John Russell, and the seals of the Colonial
Office were given to Earl Grey, one of the most prominent
advocates of the company. One of the first cares of the
Government was to pass an elaborate Constitution Act for New
Zealand, and a statute to modify the Australian Crown Land Sales
Act. Leaving the former measure for the moment, we may here point
out that, by the provisions of the latter, the whole of New
Zealand was exempted from the operation of the statute of 1842.
The effect was, that Crown lands in New Zealand were no longer
subject to the rule that all sales must be conducted by auction
at a minimum price of &pound;1 an acre, but were once more at the
discretionary disposal of the Colonial Office. The construction
put by the Government upon the new legislation is to be seen in
the Royal Instructions issued in December, 1846. The principle of
sales by auction at a minimum price of &pound;1 an acre was to be
continued, and no purchases of lands held under a native title
were to be deemed valid unless made by the Crown. But Land
Registries were to be opened for the recording of titles, and all
lands not claimed and recorded within a fixed time were to be
deemed Crown lands, no native titles being recognized unless
acknowledged by some official act, or evidenced by the
expenditure of labour upon the lands claimed.</p>
<p>These Instructions were so obviously contrary, not only to
policy but to justice, that the Governor, backed up by the
opinion of the wisest and most independent colonists, simply
refused to enforce them. Both the Bishop of New Zealand (Selwyn)
and the Chief Justice (Martin) protested formally to the Home
Government against a scheme which, if successfully enforced,
would deprive thousands of Maoris of their ancestral lands, and,
if successfully resisted, would result in the expulsion of the
European settlers from New Zealand. The Home Government accepted
the situation with a bad grace; and, Governor Grey's proceedings
with regard to the Fitzroy proclamations having in the meantime
been approved by the Colonial Office, the question closed for the
moment with the regulation by colonial ordinance of the practice
of "squatting", which had grown up in New Zealand at the close of
the war of 1845. It may well be questioned whether, in the
circumstances of the colony, the practice was not likely to lead
to trouble; but in New Zealand, as in Australia, the squatters
practically forced the hand of the Government.</p>
<p>Before leaving the Land Question, however, we may refer to a
practical commentary on the Government policy, which appeared at
the close of the year 1849. In the ten years of the colony's
existence, the Government had granted away nearly 274,000 acres,
for which it had realized just under &pound;52,000, or an average
price of something less than four shillings an acre. The expenses
of the survey department and the compensation paid for Maori
rights amounted to &pound;33,000, and the Government had made
itself responsible to disappointed claimants under the Fitzroy
Proclamations to the extent of &pound;97,000. Thus the total
proceedings of the Land Office had resulted in a loss of nearly
&pound;80,000; whilst, in addition, the Colonial Treasury owed
the Home Government &pound;14,000 for expenses of emigration.
Further than this, the Report of 1849 shewed that 14,000 acres
had been granted by deeds which stated that the grants were
recommended by the Crown Lands Commissioners, whereas, as a
matter of fact, the Commissioners had made no such
recommendation; while in other cases the amount actually granted
was in excess of the amount recommended, or even of the amount
claimed by the purchaser. These little anomalies were cured by a
general Ordinance of Confirmation passed in 1850, and specially
sanctioned by the Home Government.</p>
<p>We must now retrace our steps to the year 1846, when the
accession of Lord John Russell's Government to office marked the
rise of the New Zealand Company's star. On the 14th August, 1846,
Mr Hawes (Under-Secretary) moved for leave to bring in a Bill for
the Government of New Zealand; and such was the unanimity of all
parties, that the measure passed through three readings in each
House and obtained the Royal Assent in exactly a fortnight. There
is no evidence that the slightest examination of the measure took
place at any stage, or that any one but the promoters was
interested to the smallest extent in the scheme. And yet it
proposed to confer on a colony, which had not been in existence
quite ten years, a constitution of a far more advanced and
elaborate type than any then enjoyed by an Australian community.
As the scheme was a complete <i>fiasco</i>, it will not be
necessary to discuss it in detail; but a short description of the
measure must be given.</p>
<p>The new Constitution was to be based upon a system of
Municipal Corporations, which Her Majesty was to be empowered to
create, and to endow with any powers which she was entitled by
statute to confer on borough corporations in England. In each
province of New Zealand there was to be an Assembly, consisting
of a Governor, a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, and
a House of Representatives elected by the "Mayors, Aldermen, and
Corporations of the Municipal Corporations aforesaid". Each
Provincial Assembly was to have power to legislate for its own
province only; but, to ensure united action, Her Majesty might
create a General Assembly for the whole of New Zealand, and this
General Assembly was to consist of a Governor in Chief, a
Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, and a House of
Representatives elected by the members of the representative
Chambers of the Provincial Assemblies. To this General Assembly
was to be entrusted the power of legislation for the whole
islands in certain specified matters, such as customs duties,
currency, lighthouses, and posts. With a sudden lapse into
sanity, the Act provided that, "by reason of the unsettled state
of the Native Inhabitants thereof", the province of New Ulster
might be deprived of the privileges of the new Constitution till
the year 1854, if Her Majesty should see fit. But the maintenance
of the old form of government in the North Island was not to
prevent the creation of the General Assembly, to whose House of
Representatives the Queen might appoint (O delightful
inconsistency!) members of the existing nominee Legislative
Council. Whether the "New Ulster" indicated by this section was
the New Ulster in existence at the passing of the Act, or another
New Ulster to be created under the powers of the section
empowering Her Majesty to divide afresh the islands into
provinces, was discreetly left unsettled. The point was
important.</p>
<p>After taking a few months to consider of its powers, the Home
Government issued elaborate Letters Patent and Instructions in
pursuance of the Act. These documents are dated 23rd December,
1846, and they enjoin the full introduction of the scheme of the
Act, without making any use of the wise cautionary provision in
respect of the North Island. Perhaps the most important clause is
that which provides for the separation from "New Ulster" of the
settlements about Cook's Strait, notwithstanding that they are on
the North Island. The effect of this direction was, obviously, to
remove the Company's settlers at Wellington and in the Hutt
valley from the immediate control of the Governor and Council at
Auckland, and to make them the centre of a rival provincial
organization. For the rest, the elaborate scheme of the Act was
fully developed; and boroughs, councils, provincial and General
Assemblies, provincial Executive Councils, were to be conjured
into life. Almost the only useful clause in the Instructions is
that which provides for the proclamation of "aboriginal
districts", where, under the powers specially conferred by the
Act, Maori laws and customs were to be administered by
magistrates appointed by the Governor in Chief.</p>
<p>These solemn documents, accompanied by a new Commission
appointing him "Governor in Chief", were duly received by Grey.
He had, of course, no alternative but to proclaim them, which he
did on the 24th November, 1847. But he shewed the strength of his
character by simply declining to put them in force, save by
proclaiming Mr Edward John Eyre as Lieutenant-Governor of New
Munster and nominating Major-General Dean Pitt to a similar post
in New Ulster (January 1848), and by drawing the southern
boundary of the latter province from the mouth of the river Patea
due east to the coast. The appointment of these two Executive
Officers enabled the Governor-in-Chief to move freely about his
dominions without stopping the ordinary course of business. In
other respects things went on much as before.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to waste time in criticizing the paper
Constitution of 1846. Had it been put into force, it would
inevitably have resulted in an attempt by the small European
minority in the North Island to ignore the rights of the large
Maori majority. It can hardly have been intended by the promoters
of the measure to enrol the Maori tribes in "Municipal
Districts", or to generate Maori "Mayors, Aldermen, and Common
Councillors". But, as if to put the point beyond doubt, the
Instructions had expressly provided that no one who could not
write and read English should enjoy the municipal franchise.
Inasmuch as the Maoris wrote and read their own beautiful
language, and not English, they were obviously excluded from all
the benefits of a Constitution thus based on a strongly-marked
race division. It is hardly likely that they would have let this
fact stand in the way of an armed resistance to that encroachment
on Maori rights which a representative Assembly of Europeans
would inevitably have commenced.</p>
<p>But it is scarcely worth while pursuing the subject further.
The Home Government was completely overpowered by the force of
the Governor's remonstrances, and beat an ignominious retreat
from its undignified position. At the beginning of the session of
1848, amidst considerable banter from the Opposition, the
Ministry hastily introduced and passed a measure for the
suspension of the Constitution of 1846. The old Legislative
Council, created in 1841, was revived, but the Governor was to
have power, subject to Her Majesty's approval, to increase its
numbers, and even, with its advice, to create provincial
Legislative Councils of a modified type. The vision of
municipalities was not entirely given up; but the Governor was to
have great discretion as to its introduction.</p>
<p>Thus perished the Constitution of 1846; but this is not to say
that its effects disappeared with it. Its mere publication had
had two most mischievous results. It confirmed the Maoris in
their belief that the Home Government, prompted by the colonists,
was steadily bent on a scheme of appropriation. It compelled the
practical defiance of the Imperial Parliament by a courageous
Governor. Neither of these results can be said to have been
satisfactory.</p>
<p>We now turn to matters more immediately practical than
Constitution making. The splendid territory in the southern parts
of the Middle Island had long attracted the attention of
prospective colonizers, and in the year 1847 a movement in favour
of settling it was set on foot in England. The powerful friends
of the New Zealand Company had, in the year 1846, obtained a loan
of &pound;100,000 at 3 per cent. from the Treasury, and in the
following year they succeeded in securing, with Parliamentary
sanction, another loan of &pound;136,000, together with a
remission of interest on both sums. Further than this, the
statute of 1847, which authorized the second loan, suspended the
operation of the existing Regulations (of 13th December, 1846)
for the sale of Crown Lands so far as the province of New Munster
was concerned, and actually vested the whole lands of the Crown
in that province "absolutely and entirely" in the New Zealand
Company, until the 5th July, 1850. There was, it is true, a
restriction upon disposing of such lands, except for public
purposes, at less than &pound;1 an acre; but in other respects
the Company was to have a free hand. By the help of the strong
pressure brought to bear under this startling provision, the
Company's agents forced the Governor in the following year to
negotiate the purchase of the Middle Island from the Maoris; and
it thus became, as Crown land, practically at the Company's
disposal.</p>
<p>It will be readily understood that the Company did not fail to
improve its opportunity. An association of settlers, consisting
principally of members of the Free Church of Scotland, known as
the Otago Association, was formed to purchase land from the
Company in the south of the Middle Island; and in due time its
settlement became the province of Otago. The early settlers,
under the leadership of Mr Cargill, were few in number, though
energetic. They failed to fulfil the terms of their purchase
within the time specified; and, though they are mentioned in the
preamble of the Act which dissolved the New Zealand Company in
1851, their settlement was not constituted a province by that
statute. It was, however, put on the footing of the other
provinces by the Constitution of 1852. Even at the latter date
its population was only about 1,500.</p>
<p>Shortly after the formation of the Otago Association, an
attempt was made on a larger scale to found a settlement on
strictly Church of England lines. The influence and general high
character of the early missionaries of the Church Missionary
Society, the labours of Marsden and Broughton in the early days,
and the impression produced by the vigorous episcopate of Selwyn
in later times, had aroused a strong enthusiasm amongst the
members of the Anglican Church. Selwyn had been consecrated
Bishop of New Zealand in 1841, and since that date his
public-spirited efforts in the cause of religion and humanity had
been productive of the greatest good. He warmly welcomed the
prospect of a Church of England settlement, and offered to give
up part of his diocese to a bishop who should be specially
concerned with the new venture. The plan was at first to make the
new settlement in the valley of the Wairarapa, to the extreme
south of the North Island, and east of the Wellington settlement.
The New Zealand Company had, with the permission of the
Government, purchased land there in 1844; and this land it was
willing to dispose of to the Church of England colony. But its
title to the land was far from clear; and the managers of the
Canterbury Association preferred to go further south. On the 13th
November, 1849, the new Association was incorporated by Letters
Patent, which gave it considerable powers of self-government. On
the 1st December following, the Association entered into a
contract with the New Zealand Company, by which the latter
undertook to reserve, for a period of ten years, a tract of
2,500,000 acres in the Middle Island, to be taken up and paid for
by the Association as its requirements demanded.</p>
<p>Under these arrangements the Association proceeded with the
settlement of what is now the province of Canterbury; but in the
year 1850 the threatened dissolution of the New Zealand Company
left it in a very precarious position. To remedy this difficulty,
an Act of Parliament of that year recognized the pre-emptive
claims of the Association to the district covered by the
agreement of December 1849 (with the exception of the French
settlement at Akaroa), and left it in the power of the Colonial
Office even to extend the term of ten years stipulated for in the
agreement. This enactment practically placed the Canterbury
settlement in the position of an independent colony; for the
proceeds of its land sales were not to go to the general Land
Fund, but, after deduction of one-sixth for the Crown, to be
expended by the Association for its own purposes. The statute of
1850, however, contained a stipulation that the Association
should annually dispose of land to settlers to an average value
of &pound;50,000; and, the Association having failed to fulfil
this condition, its power to dispose of Crown lands was abolished
at the close of the year 1852. By the Constitution of the same
year, the Canterbury settlement became a province of the colony
of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It wanted but one step more to get rid of the difficulties
created by the vicious system of dual control which had prevailed
since the foundation of New Zealand. This step was the
dissolution of the New Zealand Company itself, and it was taken
in the year 1851. By a statute passed in August of that year, the
<i>de facto</i> dissolution of the Company was accepted; and the
Crown was empowered to make provision for the government of the
Company's settlements at Wellington, Nelson, and New Plymouth.
Special terms were introduced into the Act to preserve for the
benefit of Nelson a sum of &pound;25,000 which had been set apart
for it by the Company. A final clause reserved to the
shareholders of the defunct Company a claim upon the land
revenues of the whole colony, to the extent of &pound;268,000
odd, which had been guaranteed to them in the event of a
dissolution by the statute of 1847. This sum was stated to
represent, at the rate of five shillings an acre, the amount of
land claimed by the Company in 1847 under the terms of its
foundation charter of 1841; but its imposition on the general
Land Fund of the colony was bitterly resented by the settlers in
those districts, such as Auckland and the Bay of Islands, which
had never benefited by the Company's proceedings. It was,
however, probably worth while to pay even such a price for
getting rid of an extravagant and impracticable system. The
extinction of the Company paved the way for the introduction of a
new and uniform scheme of government, to which we must now
advert.</p>
<p>Certain useful clauses of the Act which suspended the
Constitution of 1846 empowered the Legislative Council of the
colony itself to indicate the lines upon which political
developement should proceed. To some extent this permission had
been followed. In the year 1848 there had been a Colonial
Ordinance constituting separate Provincial Councils for New
Ulster and New Munster; and the Provincial Council of New Munster
had held at least one session. An Ordinance of 1852 provided for
the introduction of the representative element into the existing
Provincial Councils. But more sweeping changes were expected, and
the last measure was not enforced.</p>
<p>The material prosperity and importance of New Zealand were,
though somewhat slowly, increasing. Since the dark year in which
Sir George Grey assumed office, the customs revenue had steadily
mounted; and in 1849 the imports exceeded a quarter of a million
sterling. In spite of the rival attractions in the Company's
settlements, the Government land sales were increasing each year.
Though the colony was not yet financially independent, the amount
of the Parliamentary grant and the subsidy from the military
chest shewed a decided tendency to decline. The white population
had reached 27,000 in 1852; the Maoris were estimated to count
about double that number, a rapid decline from the estimate of
1840. One very important declaration had been made by the Home
Government in 1849. No convicts were to be sent to New
Zealand.</p>
<p>Moreover, the local organization of the colony had made some
way. The Governor had from time to time proclaimed "Hundreds",
under the powers of the first Lands Ordinance and the general
discretion accorded to him by his commission. The proclamation of
a Hundred practically withdrew the land comprised in it from
squatting operations, and brought it within the limits of settled
country. Several Hundreds had been proclaimed in 1848, when New
Squatting Regulations had been published. An attempt had even
been made to act upon the municipal clauses of the abortive
Instructions of 1846; and Auckland had received a charter in
1851. Beyond the settled country, Pastoral Districts gave a rough
indication of future developement.</p>
<p>In these circumstances Sir George Grey (he had been knighted
in 1848) felt himself at length able to concur in the earnest
wish of the settlers for representative institutions. In August
1851, he sent to the Colonial Office a memorable despatch, in
which he drew the outlines of the constitution which he deemed
most suited to the circumstances of the colony. He proposed the
formation of five Provincial Districts, each with a paid elective
Council, and an elective Superintendent. For purposes of central
government he recommended a General Legislative Assembly of two
Houses, one composed of members elected by the Provincial
Councils, the other of members elected directly by the provincial
electors. The central executive should be in the hands of a
Governor and other permanent officials appointed by the Crown;
and to it should be reserved the power of distributing the Land
revenue, confirming or disallowing Provincial Ordinances, and
protecting Maori rights. So far as legislation is concerned, the
scheme is almost that of the United States of America; but the
character of the executive shews that at this time Sir George
Grey was by no means inclined to trust absolutely to
representative bodies.</p>
<p>The Imperial Parliament, in the Constitution Act of 1852,
somewhat deviated from the plan sketched out by Sir George Grey.
His suggestion as to the creation of provinces is followed; but
the number is increased from five to six (Auckland, New Plymouth,
Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, and Otago), and the Governor is
given a veto upon the election of Superintendents. The provincial
Councils and Superintendents are to hold office for four years;
but the Councils may be prorogued by the Superintendents and
dissolved by the Governor. The franchise for all purposes is
based upon &pound;50 freeholds, leaseholds of at least three
years with an annual value of &pound;10, and resident household
occupation of &pound;10 (urban) or &pound;5 (rural). The list of
subjects on which the Provincial Councils may not legislate
includes not merely intercolonial matters, such as currency,
posts, customs, weights and measures, and so on, but also Native
and Crown lands, marriage laws, important criminal offences,
property law, and the laws of inheritance and wills. The
Superintendent is not to sit with his Provincial Council, which
will have its own Speaker; but he may insist on consideration of
his proposed measures, and is alone entitled to propose
expenditure. The assent of the Governor is necessary to all
provincial legislation; but it may, subject to disallowance, be
expressed by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>The General Assembly of the colony is to consist of the
Governor, a Legislative Council of life nominees appointed by him
(not, as suggested by Grey, elected by the Provincial Councils)
and a House of Representatives elected under the same conditions
as the Provincial Councils. But the House of Representatives may,
subject to a dissolution, continue in office for five years from
election. The Legislative Council will have a Speaker chosen by
the Governor, the House of Representatives will elect their own,
subject to the Governor's confirmation.</p>
<p>The limits to the legislative powers of the General Assembly
are merely that its Acts require the assent of the Crown (which
may be expressed by the Governor), and that they must not be
"repugnant to the Law of England"&mdash;a provision which in this
and similar cases has been authoritatively explained to mean, not
repugnant to the terms of an Act of the Imperial Parliament
extending to the colony. Moreover, the Governor is to have the
exclusive initiation of money bills; and there is an absolute
reserve of &pound;16,000 a year for a Civil List. Otherwise, the
whole revenue, including the Land Fund, is to be at the disposal
of the General Assembly. But there are temporary provisions for
the cases of Otago and Canterbury during the currency of their
contracts with the defunct New Zealand Company, whose claim of
&pound;268,000 is to be met by the appropriation of one-fourth of
the annual Land revenue. After the claims of the Central
Government have been satisfied, the balance of the revenue is to
be distributed among the Provincial Councils in proportion to the
amounts collected in their Districts. The Maoris are to be
protected by the strict prohibition of any purchase of tribal
land by a private person, by the reservation of &pound;7,000 a
year for Native purposes in the Civil List, and by the power
given to the Governor to proclaim Native Districts under Maori
law. A new Commission and Instructions to Sir George Grey
accompanied the Constitution Act; but it is not necessary to
refer to them here in detail.</p>
<p>The boundaries of the newly created provinces were proclaimed
in February 1853; and the Superintendents and Councils quickly
sprang into existence. Before Sir George Grey left the colony, on
the last day of the year, the new provincial organization was in
full work, and had already tasted the sweets of power. Why it was
allowed to precede the General Assembly it is difficult to say;
certainly the arrangement produced difficulties. For when
Governor Grey departed, leaving the reins of government to the
senior military officer, Colonel Wynyard, and the General
Assembly met in May 1854, the latter found itself confronted with
a strong local organization which was inclined to narrow the
limits of central authority to the utmost. By the terms of the
Constitution Act, both the General Assembly and the Provincial
Councils were clearly invested with the power of appropriating
revenue, which implies a power of taxation; but, as the
legislation of the Assembly was to override that of the Councils,
and as the Assembly might deal with matters, such as Crown Lands
and Customs, which the Provinces were forbidden to touch, it is
obvious that, legally speaking, the power lay with the central
legislature. On the other hand, as the members of the House of
Representatives were elected by the provincial electors, it is
clear that provincial feelings would be strongly represented in
the House. Various arrangements were from time to time made,
notably the "compacts" of 1856 and 1867; and under them the
Assembly and the Provincial Councils divided the revenues till
the latter disappeared. The most startling fact seems to be that
a colonial Ordinance in the year 1856 authorized the Provincial
Councils to make laws for the disposal of their own Crown lands,
and that this Ordinance actually received the Royal Assent. For,
at the time of the passing of the great Public Works Act of 1875,
a Parliamentary Return was published, which shewed that the
provinces had adopted land systems greatly differing from each
other in detail, though possessing common features. It is but
fair to add that the provinces had succeeded in realizing a
substantial price, nearly &pound;1 an acre, for the nine million
acres which they had disposed of during their existence.</p>
<p>Under the federal constitution (for so it may be called) of
1852, the colony lived until 1875. Many alterations of
constitutional detail were made from time to time, but the
principle of central and provincial governments was maintained.
In 1858 the new province of Hawke's Bay, with Napier as its
capital, was created out of the old province of Wellington. In
January 1859, the name of New Plymouth was discarded for the
Maori title of Taranaki. In October 1859 the province of
Marlborough, with Picton (formerly Waitohi) as its capital, was
detached from Nelson; it includes the scene of the famous
incident on the Wairau. In March 1861, a new province of
Southland, with Invercargill as its capital, was carved out of
the old province of Otago; but in 1870 it was reunited with the
latter. In 1867, the gold finds on the Buller river led to the
opening up of the Canterbury lands west of the Otira range, and
involved the organization of a new county of Westland, which, in
1873, became a province. The original organization of Westland is
interesting as affording perhaps the earliest instance of the use
in modern politics of the now familiar term "county council".</p>
<p>But, as a more subdivided local government gradually came into
existence, as boroughs and road boards took up the real work of
local administration, the provincial system fell into disrepute
with the advocates of a policy of rapid developement. Its claims
on the revenue were found to be a hindrance to the raising of
loans on the credit of the colony; and its attitude towards the
central government was unsympathetic. As means of communication
became more frequent, the necessity for localization ceased to be
felt. As the old characteristics of the various settlements
disappeared, the provincial differences of policy and feeling
became less marked, and the expense and inconvenience of separate
administrations appeared unnecessary burdens. The adoption of a
resolute immigration policy in 1870, and the formation of a
central Ministry of Public Works, foreshadowed the doom of the
provinces. The Abolition of Provinces Act, passed in 1875, put
the seal on this policy; and since 1875 there has been but one
Government in New Zealand. Nevertheless, the provincial system,
despite its drawbacks, had served a useful purpose. For the
strongest kind of government is that which expresses a general
unity subject to strong local differences of detail.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.<br>
<br>
<small>THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD.</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>WE</small> now come to the event which was to change,
if not the entire character, at least the rate of Australian
progress, and to give to the Australasian colonies that
reputation for precocity of developement which they have ever
since maintained. Hitherto, notwithstanding the peculiarities of
the original settlement, the developement of Australasian
communities had been normal and regular. When once the artificial
state of industry produced in the older colonies by the convict
system had worn away, it was observed that the invariable process
of social developement set in. At first the new lands were
occupied rather than settled by pastoral groups, whose wants were
few and simple, and who claimed the right to roam over vast areas
of land which remained in its natural state. The chief object of
many of the great squatters was to make a fortune and return to
England. They were, many of them, men of good family, who had
merely come to Australia to try their luck, and who clung to
English ways and English ideas. They performed a useful function
in pioneering for new territory, and in gradually introducing
more settled industries. The small towns which grew up in their
districts were at first mainly depots for the receipt and
forwarding of their wool and hides, and for the distribution of
such stores as were needed in a pastoral station.</p>
<p>Then came the small settler, with the humbler object of making
himself a home, and of dwelling under his own vine and fig-tree,
cultivating his own farm. He was often a man who had been helped
or persuaded to emigrate, and he was inclined to hold strong
views as to the nature of his interest in the colony, and to look
with disfavour upon the huge tracts which were grazed by the
squatter's flocks and herds, instead of being broken up by the
plough. Gradually he pushed the squatter farther and farther
inland (for all settlement in Australia began from the coast) and
effected a change in the character of the district. The little
towns became more and more centres of social and industrial life.
The squatter preferred to get his personal goods in England, from
tradesmen with whom he had dealt in his youth. The small farmer
was quite content with the rougher productions of Australia; and
so local industries were gradually introduced. But this change
had not gone far in 1850. For all the more costly and complicated
industrial productions, Australia still depended upon the
mother-country. At the close of the year 1850, there were, for
example, only forty-six factories in the whole of Victoria, and,
of these, thirty-five were directly connected with the pastoral
and agricultural interests. Ten years were to produce a total
revolution in this matter, and to render the manufacturer and the
artisan supreme, where the squatter and the farmer had hitherto
ruled.</p>
<p>For many years prior to 1851 there had been rumours to the
effect that gold existed in Australia. Stray shepherds had found,
or obtained from the aborigines, lumps of quartz which they
believed to contain the metal; but their stories had been
regarded as incredible. The Government discouraged all such
suggestions, as tending to divert the popular mind from steady
industry.</p>
<p>But about the year 1840 these rumours began to grow stronger.
A New South Wales clergyman, Mr W. B. Clarke, afterwards alleged
himself to have found a piece of gold quartz in the colony in the
year 1841; but, for some unexplained reason, he did not make his
discovery public at that time. In the year 1844 Sir Roderick
Murchison, a distinguished geologist, in his presidential address
to the Royal Geographical Society of England, compared specimens
of rocks brought home by Count Strzelecki from his overland
expedition of 1840, with specimens from the gold-bearing
mountains of Ural. So far, however, from predicting (as Mr
Hargraves alleges him to have done) that gold would be found in
the region explored by Strzelecki, Sir Roderick Murchison in 1844
says emphatically that the Australian Cordillera "so far differs
from the Ural and many other meridian chains, in having as yet
offered no trace of gold or auriferous veins." But Mr Hargraves
and, later, Sir Roderick himself claimed that the latter had, in
the year 1846, at a meeting of the Geological Society of
Cornwall, urged the unemployed Cornish miners to emigrate to
Australia in search of gold. Furthermore, in the same year, Sir
Roderick addressed a formal letter to the Secretary of State for
the Colonies, stating his belief in the existence of goldfields
in Australia; and, two years later, he followed this up by a
statement to the effect that he had received specimens of gold
ore from New South Wales, and he strongly recommended the
Government to undertake a mineral survey.</p>
<p>It is probable, however, that these theoretical conclusions
would have received little attention, had it not been for the
accidental discovery of gold in California, in the year 1848. The
great excitement which followed upon that event set men's minds
at work in Australia; and it was not long before discoveries were
made which banished all doubts. In the year 1849, a Mr Smith, of
Berrima, a town about 80 miles south-west of Sydney, boldly
announced to the Government that he had discovered the existence
of gold in "payable" quantities, and that, for a sum of money, he
would point out the spot. His story was, however, received with
caution, and he was merely told that, if he would fulfil his
promise, the Government would see him suitably rewarded. Nothing
came of this announcement; but, in the year 1851, a Mr E. H.
Hargraves, an old settler in New South Wales, returned thither
from California, where he had spent about eighteen months in the
search for gold. His efforts in California resulted in no
immediate prosperity; but he gained much useful practical
experience. More than this, as he looked at the natural features
of the Californian goldfields, a great idea grew up in his mind.
Though not a geologist, he appears to have had a quick eye for
stratical resemblances; and, the more he studied the
peculiarities of rocks and soil in California, the more he became
convinced that he knew, in his own colony, a district which
presented the same features, and which, therefore, might be
expected to produce the same results. Remaining in California
only long enough to finish his observations, he returned to
Sydney at the beginning of the year 1851. Seldom has such
absolute confidence in unverified observation proved so
completely justified. According to Hargraves' own account, he
went without hesitation to a spot on the banks of a little stream
known as Lewes Pond Creek, a tributary of Summer Hill Creek,
itself a tributary of the Macquarie River, and there at once, on
the 12th February, 1851, found alluvial gold. In April, he had so
far advanced as to be able to write to the Government offering to
disclose his treasures upon payment of a sum of &pound;500.
Receiving a similar answer to that given to Smith, he decided to
trust to the liberality of the Government, and offered at once to
shew his workings to the Government geologist, an official
recently sent out from England to report upon gold prospects. On
the 19th May Mr Stutchbury officially reported the discovery of
gold in workable quantities at Summer Hill Creek; and, by the end
of the same month, the immigration to the diggings had begun.
Hargraves himself took no part in the digging, merely pointing
out to others, without reserve, the places in which his
experience led him to predict discovery, and instructing them in
the processes of washing and cleaning. He was soon made a
Commissioner of Crown Lands by the Government, and received a
reward of &pound;10,000.</p>
<p>Now began a period which can have had no complete parallel in
earlier history, save the almost contemporaneous parallel of
California. For, in days when news travelled slowly, and
travelling for ordinary men was still slower, in days when
Governments jealously prohibited the expatriation of their
subjects, and only allowed the immigration of aliens under strict
limits, nothing like the Australian gold rush could have taken
place. As it was, everything favoured the stampede. The
Australian colonies themselves were anxious for immigrants. The
European disturbances of 1848 had led many continental rulers to
the conclusion that it was wiser to allow turbulent spirits to go
than to attempt to keep them. The new era of industry had
completely unsettled the old relationships, and awakened a spirit
of restlessness. Finally, the recent application of steam to
sea-going ships had rendered a rapid decrease in the length of
the voyage from Europe a practical certainty. From the moment
that the genuineness of Hargraves' discoveries was placed beyond
doubt, a swarm of pilgrims from all parts of the world set their
faces towards the diggings. Many, perhaps the majority of the
arrivals, were totally unsuited for the actual work of mining.
Some of these turned to other pursuits in the neighbourhood, and,
in no small number of cases, did far better than the diggers
whose gold they received. But thousands turned back in despair
after a few days' experience of the hardships of the life; so
that, almost from the first, there was an enormous traffic to and
fro, and strong division of parties upon the gold question. An
extreme view of the effect upon population may be obtained from a
comparison of the statistics of Victoria at the close of the
years 1850 and 1855 respectively. At the former date, the
population was just under 70,000; at the latter, it was upwards
of 300,000. But no other colony increased to anything like this
extent during the gold rush.</p>
<p>The first care of the Government at Sydney, on receiving the
official report of the existence of gold, was to decide upon the
attitude to be assumed towards the diggers. It was abundantly
clear that the establishment of mining industries would mean a
great increase of expense to the Government. It was equally clear
that, as the law had been declared over and over again in the
colony, unauthorized digging on Crown land constituted a
trespass, for which the digger was legally responsible. But the
Governor was wise enough to see that no threats of prosecution
would deter men bent on digging in unoccupied lands, even if it
were possible to preserve the lands of private owners from
forcible intrusion. The squatting question had demonstrated that,
beyond a certain point, the theory of Crown occupation of waste
lands was apt to break down.</p>
<p>So the Government advisers suggested a compromise. Falling
back on a still older feudal doctrine, they asserted the
indefeasible right of the Crown to all gold found <i>either on
private or public lands</i>, but recommended that licenses to dig
should be granted on easy terms, which would have the double
effect of providing a revenue and of preserving an
acknowledgement of the Crown's title.</p>
<p>Acting on this advice, Governor Fitzroy, on the 22nd May,
1851, issued a Proclamation, forbidding all persons to dig for
gold on any lands without licence, but expressing the willingness
of the Government to grant licences at a fee of thirty shillings
a month to diggers on Crown lands. For the present, the Governor
refused to allow digging on private lands without the owner's
consent. The Proclamation also announced that no licence would be
given to any labourer or servant, unless he could produce a
certificate of discharge from his last service. At the same time,
the Governor commenced the practice of appointing special
Commissioners for the goldfields, charged with the administration
of the licensing system and the general maintenance of order in
their respective Districts. He also strengthened the police force
by every means in his power, and then awaited developements.</p>
<p>He had not long to wait. Almost immediately after the issue of
the Proclamation, another goldfield was discovered on the Turon
river, also a feeder of the Macquarie, only a few miles from
Lewes Pond; and shortly afterwards a third was opened up on the
Abercrombie, a tributary of the Murrumbidgee, which takes its
rise in the Cordillera, south of Bathurst. By the beginning of
June, gold began to pour into Bathurst; but Mr Hardy, the Chief
Commissioner, was able to report an almost idyllic peace and
plenty at the diggings.</p>
<p>In the middle of July an event occurred which at once produced
a violent attack of gold fever. This was the discovery of an
enormous mass of virgin gold, weighing upwards of 100 lbs., by Dr
Kerr, a squatter on the Meroo Creek. Dr Kerr had been guided to
the spot by an aboriginal who had been in his service several
years; and, in his excitement, he broke the matrix in which the
nugget was imbedded, and thus spoilt what would have been the
most magnificent specimen of gold quartz hitherto discovered.
Even as it was, the display in the streets of Bathurst of a
single find of gold worth about &pound;4,000 was enough to excite
the feelings of the inhabitants to a pitch inconsistent with
steady industry.</p>
<p>But Dr Kerr's find raised a point of some interest to the
Government. In framing the licensing regulations, the advisers of
the Crown had thought only of the possibilities of alluvial
mining. Had they even directed their thoughts towards rock gold,
they would probably have considered it highly improbable that any
explorer should be able to extract the metal without an amount of
preparation which he would hardly undertake upon the security of
a bare licence. But, as it happened, Dr Kerr had not even a
licence when he discovered the gold, though he, naturally, took
one out as soon as possible afterwards. To strengthen its
position, the Government seized the gold in the hands of a firm
of shippers who were about to send it to England; but, on the
firm's representation, it was released, security being given for
the payment of a royalty of ten per cent., if the Crown should see
fit to demand it. Early in August 1851, the Governor announced
that, for the future, licences would be held to cover only
alluvial gold, and that for rock gold won on Crown land the
Government would demand a royalty of ten per cent., half that
amount if the working was on private land. A fortnight later, the
Government undertook the escort of gold from the diggings to
Sydney, thereby adding considerably to the Crown revenue, and, at
the same time, obtaining additional power over the Gold
Districts. By the end of August, gold to the value of
&pound;70,000 had been exported from the colony. But these
figures were soon eclipsed by those which followed.</p>
<p>The news of the gold discoveries near Bathurst had soon spread
through the Australian colonies. The more adventurous of the
colonists started at once for the diggings. Others, often
encouraged by their Governments, who foresaw a constant drain of
population in favour of the old colony, endeavoured to find gold
within their own limits. Rumours of discoveries were constantly
arising. Gold was found at Echunga in South Australia, in the
Fingal District of Tasmania, and in the Coromandel ranges of New
Zealand. But none of these discoveries could compare for a moment
with those which took place within the newly-constituted colony
of Victoria. Even so early as August 1851, gold had been worked
at a place called "Deep" or "Anderson's" Creek, not far from
Melbourne; but this was soon abandoned in favour of the diggings
at Chines, on the head waters of the streams which flow north
from the Great Dividing Range to the Murray River. A month later,
these again were temporarily deserted in favour of the rich
Buninyong District, just south of the range, whose chief centre
was Ballaarat. Finally, at the beginning of October 1851, the
wonderful finds at Mount Alexander, a spur of the Macedon range
to the north of Melbourne, were eclipsing all previous
discoveries. Before the end of the year, the export of gold from
Victoria alone had very nearly reached half a million in value.
In two years the population of the Victorian goldfields almost
equalled the whole population of the colony at the close of 1850.
Most of the diggers lived in tents, and had absolutely no
interest in the colony beyond the mere hope of profit from the
diggings. If a more profitable field had opened elsewhere, they
would have left at once. By the end of the year 1851, the
probable area of future discoveries was pretty well recognized.
The goldfields, with few exceptions, were found to lie on one
side or the other of the eastern Cordillera or chain of mountains
which, beginning with Mount Elliot in Northern Queensland,
follows the coast with remarkable precision till it reaches Port
Phillip Bay. But all the more northerly part of this chain was
unexplored in 1851, and, of course, there was room for almost any
developement within such wide limits.</p>
<p>Warned by events in New South Wales, the Governments of the
other Australian colonies had made preparations for the crisis.
Western Australia was too remote to be much affected; and her
newly-arrived supply of convict labour rendered her contented.
But South Australia and Tasmania suffered severely from the drain
of population which set in towards the diggings. In South
Australia the effect was, in some districts, almost as though a
pestilence had swept away the men, leaving the women and children
untouched. Some of the emigrants really deserted their families,
but the bulk were honourable men, and remittances of gold soon
began to find their way to Adelaide for distribution amongst
relatives in the colony. After the comparative failure of the
gold diggings in South Australia, the Government had wisely set
itself to secure some part of the prosperity of the gold
discoveries for its colony by establishing both land and river
traffic routes. In these efforts it was highly successful. Many
South Australians made handsome fortunes by sending provisions to
the Buninyong and Mount Alexander Districts; and the new steamers
on the Murray proved a source of profit to the colony which
lasted until the developement of the railway system.
Unfortunately, this prosperity could hardly be realized at the
time, owing to the great scarcity of coined money in the colony.
In 1851 the privilege of coining was still jealously monopolized
by the Mint in London; while the rapid expansion of business in
the latter part of that year had rendered the supply of coin in
Australia totally inadequate to the demand. Very soon after the
discoveries, Governor Fitzroy had sent home a memorial from the
Legislative Council at Sydney, praying for the establishment of a
branch Mint in that city; and similar applications soon followed
from the other colonies. On the 22nd March, 1853, a Treasury
Minute sanctioned the applications, and colonial Mints were
shortly afterwards established by Order in Council. But, in the
meanwhile, the South Australians had got over their difficulty by
passing a Colonial Act authorizing the issue by the colonial
Government of gold ingots, of slightly higher intrinsic value
than the coins they were supposed to represent, stamped with an
authentic mark. These ingots were not made legal tender; and the
only object of the Government mark was to guarantee quality and
weight. But they were generally accepted in official and
commercial transactions, they tided over the crisis of scarcity,
and the Home Government, though with due official caution,
approved the action of Governor Young.</p>
<p>In Tasmania, the main difficulty arose from the drain of
emigrants. In August 1851, Sir William Denison wrote home urging
the transportation of more convicts or "probationers", on the
ground that there would be a great demand for food stuffs by the
neighbouring colonies, while the supply of agricultural labourers
would be shorter than ever. Both Tasmania and South Australia
united in deciding upon the continuance of the system by which
free emigrants were sent out at the expense of the Land Fund of
each colony, notwithstanding that such emigrants would probably
leave for Victoria immediately after their arrival. Of the
existence of this contingency there could be little doubt. On the
16th January, 1852, the Governor of Tasmania wrote "I have a
number of examples of men who have come back from Mount Alexander
after an absence from this colony of not more than eight weeks,
with gold to the value of from &pound;120 to &pound;1,000."
During the five months which followed the writing of this letter,
4,000 persons (most of them wage-earners in the prime of life)
left Tasmania for Victoria. As the whole population of Tasmania
was at this time only about 50,000, the matter was serious.
Nevertheless, Tasmania tided safely through the difficulties of
the gold period, and was even able, as we shall see, to help her
sorely-tried sister.</p>
<p>For it was upon the newly-established Government at Melbourne
that the strain of the new era most severely fell. The Government
at Sydney was an old and tried institution, with traditions of
more than half a century, and a staff of experienced officials
under an exceptionally able chief. When Hargraves made his
discoveries in 1851, the population of the mother colony was
nearly a quarter of a million, exclusive of the Port Phillip
District; and such a population meant a Government organization
of corresponding magnitude. Moreover, the people of New South
Wales had always, from circumstances, been accustomed to much
government, and did not resent it; while Victoria had been
started as a colony whose people were too prosperous and
contented to require more than a minimum of guidance. When the
gold discoveries suddenly drew into the colony, not merely the
most turbulent characters of Australia, but the crews of deserted
ships and the general outpourings of the civilized world, and
when, overcome by the contagion, the Government officials threw
up their posts wholesale and started for the diggings, it became
evident that the Lieutenant-Governor had his hands full. Even so
early as November 1851, he began to anticipate trouble from the
pre-emptive clauses of the Crown Lands Leasing Act of 1847 (p.
71), by which the squatters had a right to purchase a part of
their runs, at the expiration of their leases. Some of the
diggers who had made money naturally wished to purchase land in
the neighbourhood of the goldfields. The claims of the squatters
barred the way; and the squatters themselves looked with small
favour upon a class of men whom they regarded as troublesome
intruders, and whose proceedings rendered it almost impossible
for the pastoralists to procure sufficient labour to carry on
their operations. The squatters chose to overlook two important
facts, viz., that they had themselves originally acquired their
position precisely as the digger acquired his, and that the
presence of the digger, if it raised the price of labour, also
enormously increased the prices of the squatter's produce.</p>
<p>But more immediate financial troubles began to press upon the
Government. It had been necessary, not merely to add largely to
the numbers of the official staff to provide additional police,
commissioners, magistrates, customs officers, &amp;c. but also to
increase their pay in some proportion to the greatly increased
cost of living. Even with a rise in their salaries of 50 or 100
per cent., the subordinate officials would not stay. The sight of
the reckless and prosperous diggers who came down to Melbourne to
spend the Christmas of 1851, and who flung their gold about
wholesale, was too much for the feelings of the civilians. They
deserted in troops. On the 12th January, 1852,
Lieutenant-Governor Latrobe wrote&mdash;"The police in town and
country have almost entirely abandoned duty", and he begged of
the Secretary of State to send military aid. In May 1852, Sir
John Pakington replied, promising six companies of the 59th
regiment from China; but subsequently decided to send a whole
regiment direct from England. A man-of-war was also to be
stationed in Australian waters. A still more welcome assistance
came in the early part of the year from the Governor of Tasmania,
who sent, at Latrobe's earnest request, a body of 200 pensioners,
who had been serving as convict guards, and who might be expected
to resist those temptations which, if yielded to, would result in
the loss of their pensions. But all this assistance meant money,
and the Government soon fell into sore straits.</p>
<p>It is true that at first the revenue rose substantially.
Comparing the income for the quarters ending 31st December, 1850,
and 31st December, 1851, respectively, we find, on general
account, an increase of &pound;11,000, or about 30 per cent.,
and, on the territorial account, or Land Fund, an increase of
&pound;73,000,&mdash;about 100 per cent. Three months later, the
increase was about 200 per cent. on the general revenue, while
the territorial revenue remained stationary. But the latter fact
may be accounted for by the transference of the fees for gold
licences to the general revenue. It is more important, however,
to notice that, though the revenue was rising, expenses were
increasing still faster. Not only had the staff to be doubled or
trebled, at a very large increase of pay, but Government
contracts for public buildings, printing, stores, fittings, and
other necessaries, could only be placed, if at all, at
extravagantly high prices. "No Tenders can be obtained for
supplies of boots and shoes; orders have been sent to
neighbouring colonies for them. . . Old Furniture sells at about
75 per cent. advance on the former prices of new; scarcely any
mechanics will work." Latrobe estimated the deficit in the
revenue of the year 1853 as nearly &pound;400,000,
notwithstanding that he reckoned the whole Gold Revenue of
&pound;600,000 as available for general expenses.</p>
<p>In his anxiety, the Lieutenant-Governor had at first (December
1851) proposed to double the licence fee of thirty shillings a
month; but the proposal had provoked such a storm of opposition
that he withdrew it. The revenue from licences was the source of
much contention. The Government alleged that it was not taxation,
but rent of Crown lands; and at first devoted it exclusively to
the service of the gold fields. The diggers denounced it as
taxation without representation; and the Legislative Council,
almost necessarily in opposition to the Government whilst the
latter was administered by nominees of the Colonial Office,
refused to make up deficiencies out of the general revenue. Thus
the Lieutenant-Governor was placed between two fires. If he
enforced the licence fees he angered what was rapidly becoming
the largest part of the population; if he relinquished them, he
left himself without means to carry on the government of the gold
fields.</p>
<p>From this dilemma he was saved by the receipt of a general
permission from the Colonial Office, towards the close of 1852,
to deal with the gold revenue in the same manner as ordinary
revenue. By placing this fund at the disposal of the colonial
legislature, the Home Government not only removed a great
grievance and relieved the hands of the Lieutenant-Governor from
the shackles previously laid upon them by the Colonial Office,
but it took a substantial step towards the end which was now
acknowledged on all sides to be the ultimate outcome of the new
discoveries, viz., the introduction of Responsible Government.
The same despatch contained a still more important concession,
authorizing the Lieutenant-Governor to devote the remaining part
of the Land Revenue, viz., that arising from sales and pastoral
licences, "to the purposes rendered urgent by the present
crisis." As this fund was jealously reserved by the existing
Constitutions of the Australian colonies, and devoted, under the
provisions of the Crown Land Sales Act, exclusively to the
purposes of emigration and public works, it will be seen that the
Colonial Office took a strong step in sanctioning its diversion.
But it must be observed that the expenditure of this additional
fund was placed exclusively in the hands of the
Lieutenant-Governor and his Executive Council, acting
independently of the colonial legislature.</p>
<p>With this assistance, the Lieutenant-Governor struggled on,
amid increasing difficulties, till the spring of the year 1853.
By this time the agitation against the licence fee had reached an
alarming height; for the first successes of the new discoveries
had passed away, and, although the export of gold continued to
increase, it was by no means at its former rate, nor in
proportion to the increase of population. At the beginning of
September 1853, there were said to be nearly 70,000 persons
living at the Victorian goldfields; and many of these, in all
probability, earned very little more than mechanics employed in
settled work. Hence there was a fair ground for an orderly
agitation against the amount of the fee; but, unfortunately, the
diggers preferred violent measures. There was some excuse for
them. They were not represented in the Legislative Council, for
they had sprung into existence as a body since the passing of the
Act of 1850, and, though a measure had been introduced with a
view of giving them the franchise, it had not yet received the
assent of the Home Government. In the meantime, therefore, they
could not, through their representatives in the Council,
effectively criticise either the existing law or its
administration. With regard to the latter, there was obviously
room for complaint; for the immense increase of business had
compelled the Government to appoint an inferior class of
officials, and some of these, at least, succumbed to the strong
temptations of their position.</p>
<p>At the beginning of August 1853, a petition had been presented
by the Bendigo diggers, in which they urged the reduction of the
licence fee and the grant of representation to the diggers. The
Lieutenant-Governor returned a pacific reply; but the delegates
in charge of the petition were evidently bent on arousing strong
feelings, and they held meetings in Melbourne which went the
extreme length permissible to loyal subjects. Still, the
Lieutenant-Governor shrank from strong measures, and endeavoured
to remove one ground of complaint by appointing, as a nominee
member of the Legislative Council, a gentleman who was believed
to possess the confidence of the diggers. The nomination was at
once repudiated by the delegates of the latter; and, at the end
of August, an organized attempt was made to resist the renewal of
licences on the old terms. Hundreds of diggers pledged themselves
to pay no more than a third of the sum previously demanded; and
those who were inclined to yield to the Government's demands were
warned that the agitators would not "be responsible for their
safety" if they remained at the diggings. The licence system had
by this time extended, beyond the diggers, to the storekeepers
and other tradesmen at the goldfields, who were making enormous
profits out of the diggers; and these, for the most part,
unhesitatingly complied with the demands of the agitators,
willing rather to pay the fines for breach of the Government
Regulations than to offend their customers. A daring attack on a
private escort of gold near Bendigo, which occurred about this
time, shewed that the colony was on the verge of a civil war.</p>
<p>Just at this moment, an event occurred which rendered it
impossible for the Government to maintain its position unimpaired
with the scanty forces at its disposal. In the middle of
September, 1853, the total abolition of the licence fee was
seriously proposed in the Legislative Council of New South Wales.
The news flew like wildfire to Victoria, where the diggers had
hitherto looked upon the colonial legislatures (in which, it will
be remembered, they were not yet represented) as their natural
enemies. It seemed to them now that they had everything in their
own hands; and it became clearly impossible for the Government,
in the existing temper of the diggers, to exact the full amount
of the licence fee. A Proclamation, hastily published with a view
to allay excitement, by an unfortunate omission in the printed
copies led the public to believe that the total abolition of the
licence system was contemplated by the Victorian Government. A
select committee of the Legislative Council reported unfavourably
upon the system. The Government made the best of a bad bargain,
and accepted a fee of forty shillings for the three months ending
30th November, 1853; and, on the following day, the Legislative
Council passed a new Goldfields Act, which greatly reduced the
fees for diggers' licences, while it substantially increased
those demanded for permission to open stores at the goldfields.
It also provided for the grant of leases of auriferous lands, at
a royalty of not less than 5 per cent., and gave legal sanction
to the customs regarding the "claims" of diggers, which had
gradually grown up to regulate the rival interests of
neighbouring miners. Offences against the Act were to be decided
upon by the magistrates; but the accused might demand a court of
at least two members, and there was to be an appeal to General
Sessions.</p>
<p>These measures were partly successful in restoring order; but
it was obvious that the goldfields contained men who were averse
from a peaceable settlement. Notwithstanding that the numbers of
the elective members of the Legislative Council were more than
once increased, that, with the full consent of the Home
Government, a bill was being prepared for the introduction of
Responsible Government, and that the material condition of the
diggers was being rapidly improved, the Lieutenant-Governor had,
in January 1854, to report the formation of a "Diggers'
Congress", which obviously had for its object the supersession of
the ordinary government.</p>
<p>Mr Latrobe retired from office in May of the same year; and
one of the first points noticed by his successor, Sir Charles
Hotham, was the existence of an agitation against the Chinese at
the Bendigo diggings. Notwithstanding the enthusiastic character
of his reception during his progress through the goldfields in
September, the new Governor soon had to face serious
disturbances. The events of the next few months formed a crisis
in the history, not only of Victoria, but of Australia. Naturally
there is much dispute concerning them; and, as the following
account is taken chiefly from Sir Charles Hotham's reports, it is
possible that the acts of his opponents may not obtain strict
justice. But it is admitted on all sides that Sir Charles acted
with the most perfect <i>bon&acirc; fides</i>; and the accounts
given by the insurgents are far too contradictory and prejudiced
to receive much credit.</p>
<p>On the night of the 6th October, 1854, a miner named Scobie
was murdered, or at least killed, at the Eureka Hotel, near
Ballaarat. The Eureka Hotel was a place of no good repute, kept
by a man named Bentley, who, as well as his wife, was (it is
said) an ex-convict from Tasmania. Suspicion fell upon the
couple; and they, with a second man (named Farrell), were
arrested by the magistrates, but almost immediately released for
alleged default of evidence. The dismissal of the charge excited
a storm of indignation in the camp; and a body of diggers at once
attempted to wreck the hotel and lynch the accused. In the latter
object they, fortunately, did not succeed, and so rendered
themselves liable only to charges of riot and arson, instead of
the more serious charge of murder. Four of the ringleaders were,
through the prompt measures of Sir Charles Hotham, shortly
afterwards arrested, and committed for trial. But the accusations
of partiality against the officials were too strong to be
resisted; and a Board of Inquiry hastily instituted by the
Governor disclosed the ugly facts that Dewes, the magistrate who
presided at the hearing of the charge against the Bentleys, had
been in the habit of borrowing money from residents, and that
Sergeant-Major Milne, of the Police Force, had been guilty of
receiving bribes. The officials implicated were at once
dismissed; and the Bentleys and Farrell re-arrested and
convicted. But the Governor very properly declined to release the
arrested rioters, who, shortly before Christmas 1854, were
convicted and sentenced to short terms of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more disturbances had happened. Though a Commission
upon the general condition of the gold fields was holding its
enquiries, in November many diggers again refused to pay the
reduced licence fees, and, on the 30th of the month, a serious
riot took place. The military were called out, the Riot Act was
read, and there was some shooting. Eight captures were made; but
the lesson had not been severe enough, and a state of open war
ensued. The diggers entrenched themselves in a fortified camp
known as the "Eureka Stockade", openly drilled their forces in
the presence of the authorities, and levied horses and rations
from unwilling miners in the name of a "Commander-in-Chief". At
the same time they issued a long political manifesto, which,
while it did not avowedly disclaim allegiance to the Crown,
contained proposals to which no regularly constituted Government
could ever have assented.</p>
<p>The Governor at once ordered all the available military force
to Ballaarat; but, before reinforcements arrived, the coolness
and promptitude of Captain Thomas, the officer in command of the
troops on the Ballaarat goldfield when the riot of the 30th
November took place, had nipped the insurrection in the bud.
Captain Thomas saw that, while the Eureka Stockade threatened to
become a serious obstacle to the Government if its completion
were allowed, in its uncompleted state it was really a source of
weakness to the insurgents. By collecting their forces in one
spot, and thus rendering them more exposed to a crushing attack,
and by drawing off the men who threatened the Government camp, it
really left the commander of the troops free to act with
decision. Accordingly, Captain Thomas determined at once to
attack the position. Assembling his forces (somewhat less than
200 men) at 3 o'clock on the morning of the 3rd December, he
moved towards the stockade. At about 150 yards from the
entrenchments, he was perceived by the scouts of the insurgents,
who promptly fired on the advancing troops. Thomas himself,
Pasley (his aide-de-camp), Rede (the Resident Commissioner) and
Hacket (the Stipendiary Magistrate), all of whom were present at
the attack, positively assert that the insurgents fired before a
shot was discharged by the troops. Upon this reception, Captain
Thomas gave the order to fire, and the entrenchments were carried
with a rush after about ten minutes of sharp fighting. Captain
Wise was fatally wounded, and three privates were killed
outright; one officer and eleven privates were wounded. Of the
insurgents, about thirty were known to have been killed, and many
more wounded. Nearly 120 prisoners were taken. The effect of the
victory was, so far as local disturbances were concerned,
instantaneous. Even before the reinforcements under Major-General
Nickle appeared, all resistance to the authorities had died away;
and, though the Governor at once proclaimed a state of martial
law, he was able to recall the proclamation in less than a
week.</p>
<p>In other districts of the colony the effect was, for a while,
doubtful. The extreme reluctance of Englishmen to admit the
necessity for military interference by the Government told
strongly in favour of the rioters. There was some danger that
Melbourne and Geelong, left almost entirely unprotected by the
concentration of troops and police at Ballaarat, would be taken
possession of by rioters from the country districts; and Sir
Charles Hotham made hasty application to Sir William Denison, the
Governor of Tasmania, for military assistance. Very soon,
however, the feelings of orderly citizens asserted themselves.
Special constables were sworn in at Melbourne and Geelong,
marines from two men-of-war stationed at Port Phillip guarded the
prisons and the powder stores, wealthy men volunteered to serve
as mounted police, and the arrival of the 99th Regiment from
Tasmania, on the 10th December, dealt a final blow to the hopes
of the insurgents. Even before this event, all the respectable
classes in the community had rallied round the Governor; and he
felt himself in a position to defy further outbreaks.</p>
<p>But the ugliest feature of the whole affair was yet to be
revealed. Out of the large number of prisoners taken at the
capture of the stockade, only thirteen were committed for trial;
the magistrates being instructed to commit only when the evidence
was of the clearest nature. It being considered impossible to
obtain an impartial trial by a local jury, the prisoners were
brought down to Melbourne, and, after various delays, the charges
were proceeded with on the 20th February, 1855. A Boston negro,
named John Joseph, and a reporter for the Ballaarat Times, named
Manning, were first tried. The latter may have been merely led
away by professional ardour in the pursuit of "copy", though the
fact that he had been openly drilled and instructed in the use of
a pike by the insurgents would seem to shew that his zeal was
somewhat excessive. In the case of Joseph, the evidence was
overwhelming; he had actually been seen to fire upon the troops,
and he was captured in a tent which had been used as a guardroom
by the insurgents. No counter-evidence was offered, the
prisoners' counsel relying entirely on the alleged absence of
treasonable intention. Nevertheless, both prisoners were speedily
acquitted; and, although the Government wisely withdrew the
remaining cases for the time, subsequent trials produced similar
results. Ultimately, however, the difficulties of the situation
were allayed by the reforms introduced on the recommendation of
the Commission appointed to consider the whole subject of the
goldfields. This body presented, on the 27th March, 1855, an
extremely able report, in which it recommended the abolition of
the licence fee and the substitution therefor of a "miner's
right" or Crown permission, lasting for a year, and granted for a
nominal fee of &pound;1, to occupy for mining purposes a specific
piece of Crown land. The deficiency in revenue anticipated from
the abolition of licence fees was to be met by the imposition of
an export duty upon gold, at the rate of half-a-crown an ounce.
The Commission strongly recommended the granting of the political
franchise to holders of "miner's rights", and the provision of
liberal facilities for the acquisition of land by the miners. It
also advocated the simplification of the existing complex system
of government in the mining districts, whereby Commissioners,
Police authorities, Commissariat officials, and magistrates, all
worked independently of each other, and suggested the
substitution therefor of experienced "Wardens" at the head of
elective Boards, who should not only dispose (with the aid of
skilled assessors) of disputes specially connected with mining
operations, but who should have power to issue by-laws adapted to
the special requirements of each district.</p>
<p>These recommendations were, for the most part, carried out by
legislation of the same year (1855); and, before his lamented
death in December 1855, Sir Charles Hotham had the happiness of
being able to report to the Home Government the almost perfect
tranquillity of the goldfields. Moreover, the revenue had not
suffered by the substitution of the export duty for the licence
fees; but the Collector of Customs was of opinion that the result
of the change had been to throw the entire burden of the tax upon
the importers of the colony, instead of upon the mining
population. The Government was not, however, disposed to concern
itself with considerations of abstract justice, so long as it
could collect a sufficient revenue without serious
opposition.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.<br>
<br>
<small>RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT AND MODERN
CONSTITUTIONS.</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>WE</small> now enter upon the next stage in the
political history of the Australasian colonies. By the changes of
1850-2 all the members of the group, with the exception of the
remote colony of Western Australia, had reached a similar stage
of political developement. In the matter of the administration of
justice they were as unfettered as it is possible for any
nominally dependent community to be. The immense majority of
cases, civil and criminal, arising in the colonies were there
finally disposed of by judges who, if originally appointed by the
Colonial Office, were thoroughly amenable to colonial laws, and
who had by this time become an integral part of colonial society.
Only in rare and important cases was there any appeal to a
tribunal in England. In the matter of legislation, the changes of
1842 and 1850 had placed an overwhelming power in the hands of
the colonists. The Imperial control was maintained only by the
reservation of a few subjects from treatment by the colonial
legislatures, by the discretion vested in the Governors to refuse
or delay assent to measures, and by the right of the Governor to
nominate a limited proportion of the Legislative Councils, or, as
in the case of New Zealand, to create a nominee Chamber.</p>
<p>In the matter of general administration, however, the case was
different. Control over the general revenue had been conceded to
the Legislative Councils; and, since in these the representative
members were always in a substantial majority, the views of the
colonists were pretty sure to prevail, notwithstanding the rule
that all proposals for expenditure must come from the Governor.
But the colonial legislatures were still prohibited from dealing
with the Land Fund, i.e. the produce of the sale and leasing of
the public land of the colonies, which, as we have seen, belonged
by constitutional theory to the Crown, and which was regulated by
the Imperial Land Sales Act of 1842. This fund, to which were
added, on the discovery of gold in 1851, the large sums
representing the proceeds of licences to miners and store-keepers
on the goldfields, as well as the fees charged for gold escort,
was at first administered by the Governors alone, under
instructions from the Home Government. The general policy was
that, after deduction of the expenses immediately connected with
the administration of the Crown Lands, the residue should be
divided into two equal parts. One of these parts was retained by
the Governor of the colony which produced it for expenditure in
works of public utility, such as roads, bridges, and public
buildings generally; the other was sent to the Emigration
Commissioners in London, to be by them expended in emigration to
the colony by which it was remitted. The reservation of this fund
from popular control was felt as a great grievance, more
especially when the Home Government ceased (as it did before 1850
cease in the majority of the colonies) to contribute towards the
expenses of colonial government. Moreover, though the imposition
and expenditure of the customs dues were entrusted to the
Legislative Councils, their collection was still in the hands of
the Imperial authorities, who also kept an eye upon the terms of
the Colonial Customs Acts, and who were hardly yet prepared to
face the possibility of different tariffs for different parts of
the empire. But, most of all, the colonists resented the
principle which prevented them from expressing their
dissatisfaction with the conduct of any administrative official,
otherwise than by a mere resolution or criticism which had no
direct effect. The higher administrative officials were all
appointed by the Colonial Office, and in many cases were actually
sent out from England to their posts. They were under the direct
control of the Governor, and, though they usually occupied seats
in the Legislative Council, they occupied them as Crown nominees,
not as elected representatives. Consequently, if any difference
of opinion arose between the Governor and the legislature, the
officials in question not only supported the Governor's policy,
but reported to him the exact state of affairs in the Legislative
Council of which they were members, thereby enabling him to
estimate with accuracy his chances of success in a conflict with
colonial opinion. The worst feature of this system was, perhaps,
not that it favoured the Government at the expense of the
legislature, but that it enabled each party to defeat the policy
of the other without securing the fruits of the victory. The
result was a divided authority which, in times of crisis,
constituted a grave danger. It was to free the colonies from this
anomalous state of things that the more energetic colonial
politicians bent themselves, so soon as the increase of wealth
and population brought about by the discoveries of gold had
rendered ultimate success certain. No reasonable doubt can be
entertained that it was the latter circumstance which finally put
the introduction of Responsible Government beyond dispute. But
one or two preliminary steps cleared the way for the greater
change.</p>
<p>The first of these was the transfer of the Customs Houses to
the colonial authorities. This step had practically been rendered
inevitable by the Imperial statutes of 1846, which, while putting
the seal on the Free Trade policy of the mother country, left the
colonial governments at liberty to adopt or not, as they pleased,
the new policy on which England had embarked. In such
circumstances, it would have been manifestly absurd for the
Imperial authorities to attempt to retain control over offices
which might carry into effect a policy wholly different from that
adopted by their own government. The real difficulty was one of
pensions. To have cut the whole of the existing colonial staffs
adrift, would have brought down a storm of claims for retiring
allowances upon the Treasury. So Earl Grey at first proposed to
temporize, by maintaining at each port a few of the older
officials, for the purpose of enforcing the few Imperial rules
(e.g. that prohibiting differential duties) which still remained
in force. But, a few months later, he changed his mind; and, in
April 1851, a circular from the Colonial Office announced that,
with the approval of the Treasury, the Customs establishments
would be at once transferred to the colonial governments, the
latter being instructed, so far as possible, to continue the
existing officials in their posts. The change was soon afterwards
effected in the various colonies; and, as one of the first
results of the gold discoveries was to increase enormously the
business of the colonial Customs Houses, it is extremely
improbable that any difficulty occurred in finding posts for
those officials who cared to occupy them. The few Imperial rules
referred to were entrusted to the enforcement of colonial
officials, who received "deputations" for that purpose from the
Treasury authorities. These officials were also instructed to
make such returns to the Home Government as might be necessary to
enable the latter to publish official statistics concerning trade
and navigation.</p>
<p>Another step in the same direction was the handing over of the
Gold Revenue to the colonial exchequers. This event was the
result of the sudden pressure put upon the authorities of
Victoria by the rapid developement at the goldfields. Lord Grey
had, as early as October 1851, expressed his approval of the view
of Sir Charles FitzRoy, that the revenue arising from gold
licences should be primarily applicable to defray the expenses
entailed by the gold discoveries. But the Secretary of State did
not propose to waive the control of the Home Government over the
details of the expenditure. His successor, however, wise enough
to see that the Governor would be placed in an invidious position
by being saddled with the sole local responsibility in the
expenditure of the gold revenue, and warned by the hostile
attitude of the Victorian Legislative Council, boldly handed over
the whole fund to the administration of the colonial legislatures
in June 1852. This concession left the Land Fund composed of the
same items as before the gold discoveries viz., of the proceeds
of sales, leases, and pastoral licences; although these items, of
course, increased rapidly in amount with the increase of
population. Moreover, Sir John Pakington, though he did not hand
over the control of this remaining revenue to the colonial
legislatures, went so far as to authorize Sir Charles FitzRoy and
Mr Latrobe, at their own discretion, to apply such parts of it as
might be necessary to the ordinary expenses of Government. This
permission was acted on to a large extent, at least in Victoria;
and it soon became evident that the desire of the colonists for
complete control over the revenues could not long be withstood.
Nevertheless, the Imperial Land Sales Act of 1842 stood yet in
the way of all the Australasian colonies save New Zealand.</p>
<p>The final step in the chain of events which led to the
introduction of Responsible Government was, perhaps, not strictly
concerned with government machinery at all. But the total
cessation of transportation to any colony which contemplated
taking upon itself the full responsibilities of self-government
was regarded as a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i>. Victoria, South
Australia, and New Zealand had never been made by the mother
country receptacles for convicts. Transportation to New South
Wales, which then included Queensland, had ceased, after long
uncertainties, with the <i>Hashemy</i> incident in 1851. At the
close of the year 1852, the Duke of Newcastle announced to the
Governor of Tasmania that transportation to that colony had
absolutely ceased. There was thus a clean sheet for all except
the distant colony of Western Australia, which, isolated from the
rest of the group by thousands of miles of trackless desert,
could (it was thought) have no evil influence on its sister
colonies, and which did not then seriously contemplate the
introduction of Responsible Government. The way was at last clear
to the other colonies.</p>
<p>The Australian Government Act of 1850 had obviously been
regarded by its framers as only a temporary measure; for its 32nd
section expressly empowers the Legislative Councils of the
Australian colonies to devise new constitutions for their
communities, with the assent of the Home Government, to be given
after notice to the Imperial Parliament. The rapid developement
of events in Australia immediately after the passing of this Act
was sufficient to ensure that its provisions should not be
inoperative. The Colonial Office, abandoning its usual caution,
was the first to suggest that the powers conferred by the 32nd
section should be acted upon, and wisely forbore to insist upon
any rigid conditions, such as uniformity in the different
colonies, or provision for federal action. At first such of the
colonists as were not absorbed in the rush for gold, or in the
pressing necessities of the immediate situation, seem to have
been almost bewildered by the freedom of choice left open to
them. But gradually the majority came to the conclusion that the
two great objects to be attained in each colony were, a
bi-cameral Parliament possessing complete control over all
branches of revenue and expenditure, and an executive scheme
which should be controllable by party action, as in England. Upon
minor points the various colonies differed; but, in the main,
they concurred in desiring the English form of government.
Whether this fact was due to the inherent merits of the British
Constitution, or simply to a lack of the rare quality of
political originality, it is difficult to say.</p>
<p>After the first pressure of the gold discoveries had passed
away, committees were appointed of the most influential members
of the Legislative Councils in the four colonies to be affected
by the contemplated changes. The deliberations of these
committees, which were charged with framing the new
constitutions, are extremely interesting to the student of
political tendencies, but they cannot here be described in
detail. Suffice it to say that, before the end of the year 1854,
the four colonies had finally made up their minds as to the forms
they desired, and had submitted Bills for the approval of Her
Majesty. In the following year these measures received the Royal
assent, and became law. But there was a slight difference in the
manner of their introduction. The Bills sent home by the
Governors of South Australia and Tasmania simply received the
Royal assent in pursuance of the Act of 1850. The measures
submitted by New South Wales and Victoria contained provisions
which the Home Government was advised were not within the power
of Her Majesty to sanction without the express authority of
Parliament. So a special Act of Parliament was passed in each of
the latter cases to empower Her Majesty to consent to the
measure. But the Imperial Parliament, with that itch for meddling
which is the great weakness of popularly elected bodies, took the
opportunity, as the colonial measures were passing through its
hands, of making a few alterations in them. So that Her Majesty
ultimately assented to measures which had not actually been
passed by the colonial legislatures; and it is very doubtful
whether, by strict law, the constitutions thus curiously produced
are in order.* But the colonies were too anxious for their
emancipation to quarrel over details; and the measures have been
accepted without serious question. At the same time, the Imperial
Land Sales Act of 1842 and its amendments were repealed, with
exceptions for Western Australia; and the vexed question of the
Land Revenue was thus transferred to another sphere. It was not
thought needful to pass a new Constitution Act for New Zealand;
for that colony had already, as we have seen, obtained its
bi-cameral legislature by the Act of 1852. But in the
introduction of Responsible Government New Zealand plays (as we
shall see) a conspicuous part.</p>
<p class="foot">[* So hastily were the alterations made, that the
New South Wales Constitution Act, as finally passed, contains (in
the 3rd section) a reference to "clause sixty-two", while, as a
matter of fact, there are only fifty-eight clauses in the
Act.]</p>
<p>In creating their new legislatures the colonies were, as we
have said, unanimous in adopting the bi-cameral principle. But
they differed to some extent with regard to its application. All
of them obtained a Lower Chamber or Assembly, based on a broad
democratic franchise, and consisting wholly of elective members.
Most of the colonies imposed some slight test of stability, such
as the occupation of property of small value, or the membership
of a recognized profession, as a condition of obtaining the
franchise; but the colony of South Australia, in its second and
successful attempt at legislation, threw the franchise open to
every male of the age of twenty-one who should have been six
months on the electoral roll of any constituency. In most cases,
qualification for the franchise was accepted as qualification for
membership of the Assembly; this was even the rule in South
Australia, where, as we have seen, the franchise was the widest.
But the colony of Victoria, somewhat to the surprise of the Home
Government, imposed a high property qualification (freehold in
possession worth &pound;2,000, or &pound;200 a year) upon its
members of Assembly. All the colonies endeavoured to give a
preference in money bills to the Lower Chamber; but the precise
terms adopted differed considerably. All the Acts provided that
money bills should originate in the Assembly. The Victorian Act
expressly gave the Upper Chamber power to reject, but not to
alter such measures. The South Australian Act forbade
<i>either</i> House to pass a vote or resolution for
appropriation for any purpose not recommended by the Governor to
<i>the Assembly</i> during the same session; thereby implicitly
allowing the Upper Chamber to amend existing propositions. The
other two Acts are silent as to the powers of rejection or
amendment; but the former power is clearly implied by general
words, which only empower the Houses to legislate jointly.</p>
<p>It was, however, in respect of the constitution of the Upper
Houses, or Legislative Councils, that the constitutional
Committees differed most substantially. In New South Wales the
proposition to found an hereditary legislature was actually
adopted by the committee; but rejected in deference to outside
opinion. The precedent of Canada led the Home Government to
sympathize in this matter with outside opinion rather than with
the committee; and the proposal perished. But the New South Wales
Act (like the slightly earlier Constitution of New Zealand)
provided that the Legislative Council should consist of nominee
members, appointed by the Governor with the advice of his
Executive Council. No property qualification is prescribed; and
the numbers are only limited by the rule that at least
four-fifths must be non-official members, i.e. persons holding no
place of profit under the Crown, and by the implied rule that the
total number of members must not fall below twenty-one. By a
curious clause, intended perhaps to guard against the dangers of
a House appointed entirely by one Cabinet, it is provided that
the first appointed Councillors shall hold their seats only for
five years, but that members appointed after the first five years
shall sit for life. What was to be the position of members
appointed after the first nominations but before the expiry of
five years, the Act does not state.</p>
<p>But the other colonies refused to follow the lead of New South
Wales and New Zealand. In Victoria, South Australia, and
Tasmania, the Legislative Council was to consist of members
elected upon a comparatively high property or educational
franchise. In Victoria and Tasmania, the qualification of the
elected members was possession or ownership of a substantial
quantity of immovable property; the South Australian Act simply
provided that they should be of the age of thirty, and residents
in the colony of three years' standing. It is hardly possible
that the politicians of Victoria and Tasmania, where elective
Councils were introduced in the name of democracy, did not see
that a body of men elected upon a high property franchise, and
themselves qualified by the possession of property, would be far
more conservative in their tendencies than a House which could be
swamped at will by the nominees of a democratic Cabinet. But
perhaps they were willing to be deceived. At any rate, it is
certain that it is only the elective Upper Chambers in Australia
which have had any real weight. There was some attempt in the
Constitutions of 1855 to prevent any loss of dignity to the
Councils through hostile action on the part of the Assemblies, by
provisions to the effect that the Presidents and officials of the
former bodies should receive as large salaries as the
corresponding officials of the latter.</p>
<p>In all the four Constitutions of 1855 there is a provision
that the Governor shall summon a Parliament at least once a year.
The duration of the Lower House was generally fixed at five
years; but again South Australia shewed herself the most advanced
in democratic intention by the clause which limited the duration
of her Assembly to three. In the case of the elective Councils,
the members were to retire gradually, at the expiration of fixed
periods of two years (Victoria), three years (Tasmania), or four
years (South Australia), the senior members on the roll
withdrawing at each period, but being capable of re-election. In
Victoria the initial difficulty of assigning priority was got
over by treating the member for each province who was at the
bottom of the poll at the first elections as the senior member;
and, as each "province" or electoral constituency for the Council
was to have five members, it would follow that the whole council
would be renewed every ten years. South Australia and Tasmania
adopted the simpler expedient of drawing lots for order of
seniority in the first instance. In token of the increased powers
of legislation acquired by the colonies under their new
constitutions, New South Wales and Victoria claimed that their
Parliaments should henceforth legislate in the name of the Queen,
and not of the Governor; South Australia and Tasmania more
modestly contented themselves with the powers of their existing
legislatures. As regards the power of (so-called) veto possessed
by the Crown, the distinction was unimportant; for the Governor
continued to assent to measures in the name of the Crown, and the
right of reservation was fully maintained. But the wider powers
of the New South Wales and Victorian Acts saved them from some of
the technical worries to which South Australia was exposed by the
construction put by the judges upon the "repugnancy" clause (pp.
161, 201) of the old Act of 1850. From such difficulties, the
colonies were, however, relieved by an Imperial statute of the
year 1865.</p>
<p>We now come to the other great object of the constitutions of
1855, viz., the introduction of Responsible Ministries. We have
said that the framers of those constitutions almost unanimously
desired to copy the British system. We have now to shew how
strangely they differed in their plans for securing the desired
result.</p>
<p>The model of Cabinet or Responsible Government which the
colonists desired to copy was the curious product of the
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and best justifies the
peculiar claim which the English nation has long put forward of
political originality. Its gradual creation forms a part of
English, rather than of Australian history; and it is no part of
our business here to describe it. But it is necessary, in order
that the difficulties of the constitution-makers of 1855 may be
fairly appreciated, to point out its leading features. These may
be said to be (1) the control of the entire executive machinery
of state by an informal body of heads of departments, whose
advice the Crown is bound to follow in all cases, except in
certain rare questions concerning a dissolution of Parliament;
(2) the fact that all the members of this informal body, or
Cabinet, are also members of one House or other of Parliament,
and can there be questioned concerning their departments; (3) the
fact that almost all other State officials (except a few who
stand or fall with the Cabinet) are excluded from the more
important House of Parliament, and that a Cabinet is thus
precluded from directly influencing votes by the gift of places;
(4) the fact that such members of the Cabinet as are members of
the House of Commons have to seek re-election on acceptance of
office, (5) the constitutional understanding that a Cabinet shall
resign the moment it fails to command a majority in the House of
Commons, and (6) the tendency, not so clear in 1855 as now, for
the Cabinet to become more and more a solid body, whose members
stand or fall together. Of these six features only two, that
which excludes ordinary public officials from the House of
Commons, and that which compels newly appointed Ministers to seek
re-election, are dependent upon express law. All the rest, the
very names of Cabinet and Premier, the peculiar relations between
the Premier and his colleagues, and between the Cabinet and
Parliament, and, even more important, the rule that the Crown
places itself absolutely in the hands of the existing Cabinet,
are utterly unknown to express law, and are simply the result of
a long and complicated political history, perhaps merely a stage
in the process of further developement. They are almost incapable
of being stated as a coherent system. Certainly they would be
impracticable as a scheme of government in any country which had
not a profound reverence for political tradition, and a strong
genius for compromise. Yet this was the scheme which the
colonists of 1853 sought to secure by their constitutions. How
did they do it?</p>
<p>It requires a skilled eye to detect in the Australian
Constitution Acts any reference whatever to the eagerly desired
scheme of Responsible or Cabinet Government. An intelligent
foreigner, well versed in the constitutional doctrines of
Blackstone and Montesquieu, might read them through without being
any the wiser as to the nature of the modern system. It is only
when we have grasped the peculiar features of English political
tradition that we are able to pick out, here and there, a clause
or an expression which points to the new order of things. And it
is not without interest that we notice what were the features of
Responsible Government which impressed themselves most distinctly
on the minds of the colonists.</p>
<p>In the first place it was felt to be absolutely necessary, if
not to dismiss, at least to provide for the dismissal or
resignation of the existing heads of departments. It is true that
these officials held their posts merely at the pleasure of the
Crown; but it was a pleasure which long usage and understanding
had construed as a guarantee of security of tenure, so long as
the official in question continued to perform his duties to the
satisfaction of his superiors. Practically, such an official was
never removed unless he was guilty of gross incompetence or
deliberate malpractices. But the colonists desired now to have,
in the place of permanent officials, Ministers who could be
dismissed by a mere vote of Parliament, recorded on a question of
policy. Obviously, it was but just to provide compensation for
those officials who, having accepted office under one set of
conditions, would lose it under another; for it was fairly clear
that the nominees of the Colonial office would not long retain
the favour of colonial Parliaments. Accordingly, at the
suggestion of the Home Government, the framers of the new
Constitutions inserted clauses guaranteeing pensions to the
officials "more liable to loss of office on political grounds
than heretofore." This was the wording of the Tasmanian Act, and
most correctly states the new condition of affairs. But all the
four colonies committed the mistake of allowing the existing
occupants of office to claim their pensions on <i>retirement</i>
or removal; thereby relieving them from the necessity of waiting
till a hostile vote should release them. Tasmania went still
farther, and allowed her officials to claim immediate
compensation for "increased liability to loss of office", before
any loss had actually occurred. The officials were thus able to
pocket comfortable sums, and at once to enter the lists, with all
the prestige of their former experience, as candidates for
"responsible" office. But only one colony, Victoria, made any
provision for future Responsible Ministers. These would accept
office with full knowledge of the uncertainty of their position,
and must take their chance. Victoria set aside &pound;4,000 a
year to compensate the Responsible Ministers of the future.</p>
<p>To that feature of the English system which makes the advice
of the Cabinet final in all the acts of the Crown, only slight
expression is given in the the Constitution Acts. The
Constitutions of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia
require that all appointments to public office (except the
appointment of Ministers) shall be made by the Governor "with the
advice (and consent) of the Executive Council"; and that of South
Australia further requires that all payments out of the public
funds, and all appointments and dismissals from office (except in
the case of Ministers) shall be made in pursuance of warrants
signed by the Governor and countersigned by the Chief Secretary,
who is, of course, a Responsible Minister. But in other respects
the doctrine of Cabinet power is left to tradition; and the
Constitution of Tasmania is absolutely silent on the whole
subject.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mention should be made of the fact that,
although the control of the Cabinets over the Public Service is
still, in theory, maintained, its exercise is substantially
modified by the Public Service Acts which have been passed in
most of the colonies, and which aim at preventing any arbitrary
or unjust promotions or dismissals. It is this fact which so
sharply distinguishes between the politics of Australia and those
of America.]</p>
<p>With regard to the second doctrine, that members of the
Cabinet must be also members of Parliament, the Acts are equally
incomplete. Only in the cases of Victoria and South Australia is
the doctrine stated in clear terms. In these colonies it is
provided that a certain number of Government officials shall be
members of Parliament. New South Wales contented herself with
allowing such officials to seek re-election to the Assembly after
vacating their seats by acceptance of office. The constitution of
Tasmania merely says that any acceptance of office shall vacate a
seat in Parliament, leaving it a matter of doubt whether any
officials, and if so which, may seek re-election. The exclusion
from the elective Houses of all officials other than Responsible
Ministers is, however, clearly laid down in all cases except that
of Tasmania.</p>
<p>Again, the peculiar relations between the Ministry and the
Parliament are only hinted at in the obscurest way in the
Constitution Acts. The summoning, prorogation, and dissolution of
Parliament are placed in the hands of the Governor alone; and
although, doubtless, it was intended that the Governor should in
ordinary cases act in such matters upon the advice of his
Ministers, it would clearly not have been right to bind him to do
so, for then it would have been left in the power of a defeated
Ministry practically to put an end to Parliamentary government,
by insisting upon repeated prorogations and dissolutions. Even in
England, the Crown is clearly not bound to dissolve Parliament in
all cases upon the request of the Cabinet. But the apparently
free hand left to the Governor in such matters is no conclusive
proof of the contemplation of Responsible Government; for the
same course is adopted in other cases, in which he is clearly
intended to follow the advice of his Ministers. An unmistakeable
reference, however, to the new system occurs in the exception, to
be found in all the new Constitutions except that of Tasmania
(which does not refer to the matter at all), limiting the powers
of the Executive Council in the matter of public appointments.
Although, as we have said, appointments are in all other cases to
be made upon the advice of the Executive Council, in the case of
the "appointments of the officers liable to retire from office on
political grounds", the choice is to lie with the Governor alone.
The Constitution of South Australia expressly gives the Governor
the power of dismissal, as well as of appointment in such cases;
in the other Constitutions the power of dismissal is only
implied. The exception is obviously intended to enable the
Governor to get rid of a Ministry which has lost the confidence
of Parliament and is yet unwilling to resign, and also to prevent
a retiring Ministry having any voice in the appointment of its
successor. With regard to the sixth great feature of the English
system, the solidarity of the Cabinet, the Constitution Acts are
absolutely silent; unless we see in the clause respecting the
countersign of warrants in South Australia by the Chief Secretary
a covert allusion to it.</p>
<p>On the whole, a study of the Constitutions of 1855 leaves upon
the mind of the student the impression that the colonies had made
up their minds to adopt the English system, but that they found
great difficulty in understanding it, still more difficulty in
describing it. The Cabinet system was, in 1855, so imperfectly
understood even in England, outside privileged circles, that this
is no matter for surprise. It is doubtful whether, at the time
when the Constitutions were framed, there was a single person in
Australia who had had any practical acquaintance with the working
of the system. There were, of course, many officials, from the
Governors downwards, who owed their appointments to Cabinet
Ministers; and they and the colonists must have known that these
Ministers were, in some mysterious way, influenced by debates in
Parliament, and liable to go out of office for reasons quite
unconnected with administration. But this was a slender basis for
the introduction of a new and complicated system.</p>
<p>It is not to be wondered at, then, that the colonies found
some difficulty in getting their new Constitutions to work. The
first elections under the new system naturally brought to the
front representatives of the new classes of society developed by
the gold rush; and the old leaders found themselves discarded.
Few of the Cabinets retained office more than a few months, and
changes of Ministers were frequent. In Victoria something like a
deadlock occurred, owing, apparently, to the desire of the
existing officials to secure their pensions before embarking upon
the uncertainties of Responsible Government. Without waiting to
be dismissed or removed by a hostile vote, and before the new
Parliament had met, the four chief officials requested the
Governor to release them from office "on political grounds", and
the Governor, in compliance with their request, proceeded to do
so; whereupon, each official wrote a formal letter, accepting his
dismissal, and claiming a pension. Unfortunately, the member
charged with reporting the circumstance to the Legislative
Council announced that his colleagues had resigned, and, although
this statement was corrected on the following day, the suspicions
of the Council were aroused. The situation was rendered still
more strained by the announcement, which soon followed, that the
Governor had re-appointed the same four officials to their old
offices, and had added to them three new officers, thus obviously
intending to create a Cabinet. Inasmuch as the country had not
had an opportunity of expressing its views upon the policy of the
existing Government, this manoeuvring was looked upon as an
unfair attempt to secure a start in the political race; and the
officials implicated only escaped censure by the use of their own
votes in the Council.</p>
<p>But it was in New Zealand that the greatest surprise occurred.
For in the New Zealand Constitution of 1852, there was no
reference, direct or indirect, to the new system; and, as a
matter of fact, it had not been contemplated by the framers of
the statute. There is no provision in the Constitution for the
re-election of Ministers, nor for the exclusion of other
officials from Parliament; apparently the Executive Council is
not even indirectly alluded to in the Act. Moreover, outside the
Constitution Act, the Governor's Commission was couched in terms
which clearly implied the existence of a permanent Executive. The
Governor had only power to fill two seats; and his appointments
required express confirmation by the Home Government.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, by the time that the Constitution of 1852 was
got to work in New Zealand, the idea of Responsible Government
was already in the air. And when the General Assembly held its
first meeting, in May 1854, the subject was immediately raised.
On the 2nd June, Mr E. G. Wakefield carried, with only one
dissentient in a House of Representatives of 30 members, a
resolution urging the immediate establishment of ministerial
responsibility. Sir George Grey had, unfortunately, left the
colony a few months before; and the office of Governor was being
temporarily administered by Lieutenant-Colonel Wynyard, who,
naturally, shrank from saddling his successor with changes of
which he, or the Home Government, might disapprove.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was obviously necessary to do something to
avert the deadlock which the existing system unhappily rendered
only too likely. For, if the House of Representatives were to
take up an attitude of opposition, the Governor would find
himself deprived of means wherewith to carry on the government.
There was no Land Fund to fall back upon in New Zealand; and,
though there was a guaranteed Civil List, it was only sufficient
for the barest essentials of the Government staff. Moreover, even
the Civil List might fail at any time, owing to the expiry of the
Customs Acts.</p>
<p>So the Governor, acting on the advice of his Attorney-General,
determined to offer a compromise. He would not take the
responsibility of dismissing or even accepting the resignation of
officials directly appointed by the Home Government; but it so
happened that one of the four officials in the Executive Council
(the Colonial Secretary) had been appointed by a previous
Governor, and Colonel Wynyard felt that his case was different.
Before making any changes in the occupation of offices, he
offered to call to the Executive Council three non-official
members of the House of Representatives who possessed the
confidence of the latter body, and, upon a remonstrance from the
Legislative Council, to the effect that such a step would ignore
its existence, to add a member from the Upper House. This scheme
was at first accepted by the Assembly, and was actually tried for
about two months. But it will be seen that the effect of the
arrangement was practically to constitute a Government of two
parts, of which one did the work and the other criticized it,
only the critical part being in touch with the Assembly. This
state of things was inevitable so long as the permanent officials
were retained; for, of course, the Governor could not secure them
seats in the elective House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Naturally, the arrangement was not successful. The official
members of the Government perhaps made light of criticisms in the
House of Representatives which they did not hear. The
non-official members disclaimed responsibility for administration
which they did not conduct. On the 1st August, 1854, the crisis
came to a head. On the Governor refusing to do more than accept
the resignation of the Colonial Secretary if voluntarily
tendered, the non-official members of the Government resigned,
and all attempts to find successors acceptable to the House of
Representatives failed entirely. At this point, the Governor
seems to have made the serious mistake of applying for advice to
Mr E. G. Wakefield, who, though a member of the House of
Representatives, had not been a member of the retiring Ministry.
The Governor protested that his proceedings had been approved by
his only constitutional advisers (the permanent officials). But
the House evidently resented deeply what it believed to be an
attempt to create division within its own walls; and when, after
a short prorogation, a new Ministry was constituted by the
Governor on the terms of the former arrangement, it was at once
met with a vote of no confidence. It now seemed as though a
deadlock were imminent; but, at the last moment, the House of
Representatives suggested that the Governor should for the
remainder of the session carry on the government in the old way,
i.e. through the permanent executive, confining his attention to
matters of immediate importance. On this understanding, the
necessary supplies were voted, and the Assembly was prorogued
till July 1855. By that time the Home Government had expressed
its complete willingness to sanction the introduction of
Responsible Government, but it took the view that, after all, no
legislation on the subject was necessary, beyond that for
securing pensions to the officials of the old system. On the
appointment of Colonel Gore Browne, Colonel Wynyard's successor,
which shortly followed, the Colonial Office did not even think it
advisable to alter the terms of his commission; and, immediately
after the opening of the session of 1856, the necessary provision
for the retiring officials was made. Thereupon their offices were
filled by members of the House of Representatives; and
Responsible Government in New Zealand became an accomplished
fact. But a curious little trace of the struggle which
accompanied its birth survives in the rule that members of the
House of Representatives, on accepting Cabinet office, are not
bound to seek re-election at the hands of their constituents.
This is also the rule in South Australia.</p>
<p>Since the changes of 1854-6, the general outlines of the
schemes of government at work in the Australasian colonies have
altered but little. Minor changes have been made, the system of
local government has been developed, questions and disputes have
arisen and been settled. All these are matters of much interest,
but they have not involved reconstruction of the political
fabric, and space forbids any detailed account of them. Amongst
the most pronounced tendencies may be named the extension of the
franchise for the Lower Chambers, the adoption of the ballot
system, the shortening of the duration of Parliaments, the
payment of members, and the measures for preventing a deadlock
between the two Chambers of one Constitution. With regard to the
first of these tendencies, it may be said that the effect of
modern changes has been practically to give the franchise for the
popular House to almost all resident adults of both sexes. The
introduction of the "one man one vote" principle has been
generally effected in both Federal and State elections. The
ballot system of voting was adopted very shortly after the
introduction of Responsible Government, and is now in force
throughout the Australasian colonies. In most cases, the extreme
limit for the duration of a Parliament has been reduced to three
years; the new Constitution of Western Australia adopted the
intermediate number of four; but the triennial basis has recently
been introduced by way of amendment. Payment of members is now
universal in the case of the Lower Chambers of the Australasian
colonies; in Tasmania, South Australia, and New Zealand, members
of the Upper Chamber also receive remuneration.</p>
<p>The expedients adopted for preventing a deadlock between the
two Chambers of a Constitution have been either (a) alterations
of the composition of the Upper Chamber, with a view of bringing
it more into touch with the colony, or (b) definitions of the
relative powers of the two Houses. Several changes of the former
kind have taken place, with the objects of reducing the
qualifications necessary for the electoral franchise, subdividing
the electoral provinces or constituencies for the Upper Chamber,
and diminishing the number of years for which a member of the
Upper Chamber holds his seat. Even in the nominee Chamber of New
Zealand a change has been adopted, by which members require
reappointment every seven years; failing reappointment, their
seats become vacant. But by far the most interesting experiment
is the scheme adopted by the South Australian Parliament in the
year 1881, by which, if there is a deadlock, and a measure is
passed by the Assembly in two successive Parliaments (a general
election having intervened), and in the latter Parliament by
absolute majorities on the second and third readings, the
Governor may then dissolve both Houses at once, or, at his
option, issue new writs for one or two new members to be sent
from each constituency of the Upper House. In the event of the
Council being united against the Government, the Governor would
probably adopt the former alternative; if the opposition majority
were but small, the latter would probably be sufficient. At the
present time, resort is being had to these provisions of the
statute of 1881; but the result is not yet known. Attempted
definitions of the powers of the two Chambers have been on many
occasions formulated; and resort has sometimes been had to
Imperial decision. The general desire of the Lower Chambers has
been to exclude the Upper Chambers altogether from jurisdiction
in the matter of money bills; but the desire has never been
realized in theory, however nearly it may have been reached in
practice. While the inconveniences of allowing two separate
bodies to discuss the details of a long scheme of expenditure may
be freely admitted, there seems no reason why, on the barest
principles of justice, elective Upper Chambers, such as those
which exist in Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania, should be
prohibited from tendering advice (whether by "suggestion" or
"amendment" does not very much matter) upon broad questions of
finance. And where, as has happened more than once, a Lower
Chamber endeavours to insert in money bills measures of principle
which are not really financial matters at all, or to forbid the
Upper Chamber to discuss a measure which, though primarily a
non-financial matter, incidentally affects the revenue by means
of fines, such action must be unhesitatingly condemned as
unworthy of honourable men.</p>
<p>To complete the story of Responsible Government, it should be
repeated that in the year 1859 Her Majesty, acting upon the
powers reserved to her by the Constitution of 1855, created the
separate colony of Queensland by detaching it from the mother
colony of New South Wales, and conferred upon it, by Letters
Patent, a constitution similar in most respects to that of New
South Wales. Queensland, then, must be added to the list of
colonies with nominee Councils. It is remarkable as being the
only Australian community which has at one stroke entered upon
both separate existence and political self-government. In the
year 1890, the colony of Western Australia, more than once
previously disappointed, received a bi-cameral constitution and
Responsible Government At first the Upper Chamber was to be
nominee, but at the expiration of six years from the first
summons to the Council, or if sooner the white population of the
colony attained 60,000, it was to be replaced by an elective
council of members holding their seats for six years, and
retiring by thirds every two years. The change came about in due
course, and is now in operation. Finally, it ought to be noticed
that in the year 1874 the group of islands in the Pacific known
as "Fiji" became, vested by surrender of the native chiefs in the
British crown, and was incorporated as a colony with a Governor
and a nominee Legislative Council of twelve members, of whom half
are official and half non-official.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.<br>
<br>
<small>INTERNAL EXPLORATION OF AUSTRALIA.</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> expeditions of the great navigators of the
17th century had revealed nothing more of Australia than its
coast line. The early explorers were, nearly all, sailors by
profession, and, with true sailor instinct, did not care to go
far from their ships. It was reserved for the successors of
Captain Phillip to encourage and reward the exploration of the
great interior which, until the close of the eighteenth century,
was absolutely unknown to Europeans. The gradual pressure of
increasing population upon the limits of settlement, the desire
to open up new districts for colonization, the zeal for
scientific discovery, and, in some cases, the mere spirit of
enterprise, have gradually pushed the track of the explorer over
the vast regions of Australia; till now, though much remains to
be examined in detail, the main outlines of the picture are known
to the European world.</p>
<p>It seems, therefore, convenient in this place to give a
succinct account of the explorations which have led to this
result, in order that the progress of discovery may more clearly
appear than would be possible if only casual references were made
to each achievement in the general story of Australian
developement. At the same time it must not be forgotten that the
achievements of the explorers were, in many cases, the direct
results, and the no less direct causes, of events in general
history.</p>
<p>What may be called the physical features of Australian
exploration have a certain character of their own. There are no
ravenous beasts and no impenetrable mountain ranges with barriers
of eternal snow; nor is the progress of the traveller barred by
giant rivers. A few poisonous snakes are to be reckoned with; but
a moderate amount of care and skill is sufficient to avoid danger
from them. Such mountains as Australia possesses lie almost
entirely in long ranges parallel with the eastern and
south-eastern shores, and were scaled at an early date. Even the
aboriginal, savage and utterly barbarous as he is, has not proved
a very formidable danger to the explorer. He has been hostile
chiefly in regions previously visited by the white man, whose
virtues he has thus had an opportunity of acquiring. Even the
bewildering "bush", the trackless forest of monotonous eucalypts,
in which the inexperienced traveller will lose himself in a
moment, is, after all, to be found much more in the neighbourhood
of the early settled districts than in the recently explored
interior. The real dangers of the inland explorer arise from the
scarcity of water, the long stretches of barren desert which
afford neither food nor shelter, and, above all, the uncertainty
of the seasons. A tract of land which, in winter or a rainy
summer, will be easy and even pleasant travelling, in a season of
drought will be an inhospitable desert. A stream which the weary
traveller has for days counted upon with certainty as a relief to
his sufferings and a means of continuing his journey, is found
upon his arrival to have disappeared for want of rain; and there
is nothing for him to do but to sit down and die.</p>
<p>A paper written in the year 1831 by the famous Australian
explorer Allan Cunningham may be accepted as trustworthy evidence
of the progress of Australian exploration up to that date. The
first great event in that progress is the discovery, already
alluded to, of the Bathurst plains, by Messrs Blaxland,
Wentworth, and Lawson in the year 1813. The barrier to be pierced
was the chain known as the Blue Mountains, some sixty miles to
the west of Sydney. These hills do not seem very formidable to
Europeans, accustomed to scrambling about the Alps and the
Pyrenees; but several previous failures testified to the superior
daring of Mr Wentworth and his companions. Proceeding up the
Grose River, and then keeping along the crest of the watershed,
they at length arrived at a point which seemed to them the
highest of the range. From thence striking due west, and crossing
a dreary waste, the travellers had at last the satisfaction of
seeing from afar a rich plain, watered by two fine streams, which
have since received the names of the Macquarie and the Lachlan.
Though they were obliged to turn back when actually in sight of
the promised land, their report received credit; a road to the
newly-discovered plains was constructed by convict labour in the
following year; and in a very short space of time the flocks on
the Bathurst plains, for so the new district was called,
threatened to rival the famous flocks of Camden.</p>
<p>The discovery of the Lachlan and Macquarie rivers had excited
hopes that, by following these streams in their westerly course,
some valuable discoveries might be made. Accordingly, in the
years 1817 and 1818, two expeditions under the command of the
Surveyor-General, Oxley, were organized with this object. The
first expedition met with much disappointment. Its efforts to
descend the Lachlan and Macquarie resulted only in the discovery
of huge swamps, in which these rivers appeared to lose
themselves, and from which arose the legend of a great inland
Australian sea, now proved to be baseless. The second expedition,
however, abandoning the Macquarie marshes, struck eastward and
discovered the Liverpool Plains (afterwards the site of the
Australian Agricultural Company's settlement), finally reaching
the coast at Port Macquarie, the mouth of the river Hastings. The
discoveries of Wentworth and Oxley practically resulted in the
colonization of a semicircular belt many thousands of miles in
extent, which embraced the old colony on the west and north.</p>
<p>The next great extension was on the south, where the famous
"Cowpastures" had hitherto marked the limits of settlement.
Gradually the squatters, led on by aboriginal stories of a great
river flowing west, pushed through the thick belt of scrub to the
south-west of Camden, crossed the Dividing Range, and there,
surely enough, found, not only a great river flowing west, but a
vast extent of open pasturage, called by the aborigines
"Monaroo", but to which the colonists gave the name of "Brisbane
Downs". Fired by the prospect thus opened up, of reaching
overland the south country whose shores had been explored by
Flinders and Bass, two young colonists, Messrs Hume and Hovell,
undertook, in the year 1824, a great expedition to the
south-west. Starting from a point near the headwaters of the
newly-discovered river, the Murrumbidgee, they succeeded, after
one false start, in striking a happy line which led them, with
comparatively little difficulty, straight to the shores of Port
Phillip Bay. On their way they discovered and named the Hume, the
Ovens, and the Goulburn rivers, and crossed as well, though they
do not seem to have known it, the infant stream of the great
arterial river of southern Australia, the Murray. They also
penetrated the chain known as the Australian Alps. Their glowing
accounts of the fertility of the country to the south of this
latter range were afterwards to be verified by the pastoral
prosperity of Victoria, but at first they seem to have been
disregarded. The curious fact appears to be that the travellers
believed themselves to have reached, at their final point, the
shores of Westernport, instead of those of Port Phillip.</p>
<p>The year 1827 witnessed the great and fruitful journey of
Allan Cunningham to the north. Cunningham had been with Oxley on
his expedition of 1817, and had had much other experience of
Australian exploration. Crossing Oxley's track of 1818, which led
to Port Macquarie, Cunningham pushed almost due north, crossed
the Peel River (discovered and named by Oxley), discovered the
stream to which he gave the name of Dumaresq, and then, bending
north-east, pushed on till he came to the glorious pastures known
as the Darling Downs, now one of the finest sheep-breeding
districts in Australia. Still pushing to the north, but hugging
the western slopes of the range which, so he suspected, ran
parallel with the eastern coast, he accidentally discovered a gap
in the chain which, as he afterwards ascertained, was destined to
prove the desired means of communication between the inland
district which he had just discovered and the coast settlement at
Moreton Bay. Cunningham returned from the expedition of 1827 by a
route only slightly more to the east than that which he had taken
on setting out; but in the following winter he sailed for Moreton
Bay, explored the river Brisbane almost to its source, and
ascertained that it did not, as was then supposed, flow from the
Macquarie marshes, but from the eastern cliffs of the apparently
interminable chain which cuts off the eastern shores of Australia
from the plains of the Darling and the Murray. Thus he
established beyond doubt that the true way of opening up the
country to the west was by a road connecting it, through his Gap
of the previous year, with the highest navigable point of the
Brisbane.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Government of New South Wales had made another
effort to solve the mystery of the Macquarie, which had baffled
Oxley. In the year 1826, Captain Sturt, accompanied by Mr Hume
(the successful explorer of 1824) set out for Mount Harris, where
Oxley had left his boats in 1818, when starting for Port
Macquarie. The year 1826 was the third year of a drought; and the
meaning of an Australian drought was brought fully home to
Captain Sturt when he discovered, in place of the marshes upon
which Oxley had cruised, hard sunbaked plains, on which birds and
dingoes wandered feebly about, gasping for air. But the mystery
of the Macquarie remained as great as ever; for, after growing
gradually fainter in its descent from Mount Harris, the river
simply disappeared in a most inexplicable way, and all further
efforts at this time failed to trace its further course. Sturt,
however, made a discovery not less important than the fate of the
Macquarie, namely, the existence of the Darling river, upon which
he stumbled in his northward track, and which he followed
westward for about forty miles, always finding, however, its
waters salt and undrinkable. Pushing his enterprise to the very
verge of imprudence, Captain Sturt at length returned to Bathurst
after many weeks of arduous toil.</p>
<p>In the year 1829 the same officer was commissioned by the
Government to explore the course of the Murrumbidgee. Pushing
along the right bank until he reached a point about 450 miles
south-west of Sydney, he there built a dep&ocirc;t, and, putting
together a boat which he had brought with him, he launched it on
the waters of the newly-discovered river. Following the stream,
in much danger from the floating logs which it contained, he
passed (though he seems hardly to have guessed it at the time)
the mouth of the Lachlan, and at length reached (Feb. 1830) the
main stream of the Murray, the great arterial river which
receives the waters of the Darling, and sweeps on in a mighty
volume to Lake Alexandrina, near Adelaide. Pursuing his course
down this river, Sturt came, after about nine days of travelling,
to the mouth of a stream almost as large as the Murray itself.
This tributary he strongly suspected to be the river Darling,
whose upper waters he had himself explored three years before.
Turning up this new stream, he traced its course for a few days,
but did not succeed in reaching the southernmost point of his own
previous examination. He thus left it still an open question
whether the sweet-water river which joined the Murray at
longitude 141&deg; east, was or was not identical with the
brackish Darling previously explored. But, returning to his
original direction down the Murray, Sturt soon accomplished a far
greater feat; for, after a voyage of thirty-two days, he passed
into the great shallow Lake Alexandrina, and, crossing to its
southern shores, ascertained beyond dispute that he had reached
the southern shore of the continent at a spot far west of the
point reached by Hume, namely at Encounter Bay, in the present
colony of South Australia. Conducting his party back by the route
by which they had come, Captain Sturt reached Sydney after a
voyage which was not only productive of immediate results, but
established for ever the general outlines of the river system of
southern Australia.</p>
<p>Even more immediately fruitful was the expedition of Sir
Thomas Mitchell, the Surveyor-General of New Wales, in 1836. In
spite of the drought, he succeeded in tracing the whole channel
of the Lachlan to its junction with the Murrumbidgee, descended
that river and the Murray to the outlet of the hypothetical
Darling, ascended the latter stream till its identity with the
real Darling could no longer be questioned, and then explored the
Murray <i>upwards</i>, till stopped by the floods at Swan Hill.
Here leaving the river, he struck south-west, and, through many
dangers, skirting the chain of mountains which he named the
Grampians, obtained from the northernmost of the group, Mount
Hope, a view of a rich and attractive country. Pushing still
further south, and discovering the Wimmera and other streams, he
finally reached the coast at the mouth of the River Glenelg, from
which he visited the newly-established settlement of the Messrs
Henty at Portland Bay. Commencing his return journey by a route
parallel to, but considerably to the south-east of that by which
he had come, he crossed a range of hills which he named the
Australian Pyrenees, and, from the summit of Mount Macedon, sixty
miles to the north of the then unborn city of Melbourne, he burst
into enthusiastic rapture at the sight of the fertile plains of
Australia Felix, the central portion of the present colony of
Victoria. Sir Thomas Mitchell was a scientific, as opposed to a
merely practical explorer; and in his report of his great
expedition he lays emphatic and perhaps rather exasperating
stress upon the mistake made by nearly all his predecessors, in
keeping to the rivers and low-lying lands, instead of taking the
more arduous routes along the mountain ranges. But the
Surveyor-General was entitled to boast; for his own expedition
was a conspicuous success, on account of its economy of human
life and the exactness of its achievements, as well as for its
immediate effect on the colonization of South Australia and
Victoria.</p>
<p>The progress of discovery, which had hitherto been directed
exclusively from Sydney, was now found to originate in other
parts of Australia.</p>
<p>For Captain Stirling had founded the colony of Western
Australia in the year 1829; and, nine years later, H.M.S.
<i>Beagle</i>, under the command of Captain Wickham, set out from
Swan River on a voyage of exploration along the N.W. coast of
Australia. On her outward voyage from England, she had left at
the Cape of Good Hope a certain brilliant young lieutenant,
George Grey, destined to play a conspicuous part in the drama of
British colonial history; and he, with his friend and comrade
Lushington, had conceived the daring plan of making straight to
the unknown coast from the Cape, and penetrating into the great
continent at a point never yet visited by Europeans. In a little
schooner of 160 tons, the <i>Lynher</i>, Grey and Lushington left
the Cape on the 20th October, 1837, and, on the 3rd December,
reached Hanover Bay, in longitude 124&deg; 40' east. After a halt
of some weeks, during which Lushington visited Timor to get
ponies, the expedition started south, and soon came across a
considerable river, which Grey named the Glenelg&mdash;a somewhat
unfortunate choice, as there already existed a Glenelg River in
the south of the continent. Arrived at this river, the expedition
turned to the east and followed its course for many miles; but
the travelling was so bad that half the horses died, and the
explorers deemed it prudent to turn into a chain of hills which
ran almost due north and south, with a view of visiting the
country behind them. Lieutenant Grey had before this been wounded
by hostile natives, and at this point the surgeon forbade him to
go further; but he declined to allow the expedition to turn back,
and camped on the hills whilst Lieutenant Lushington explored the
chain due south. Being at length obliged to return to the coast,
the party there met Captain Wickham in the <i>Beagle</i>, who had
been exploring the coast south of the point at which Grey and
Lushington had landed. A comparison of results led the explorers
to the conclusion that the old theory started by Dampier, to the
effect that the north-west shoulder of Australia was in fact an
archipelago of islands through which a direct passage to the seas
of the Old World might be discovered, was no more than a myth
occasioned by the strong currents and floods of the FitzRoy and
Glenelg Rivers, of which they saw ample evidence. But the results
achieved still seemed insufficient to account for the drainage of
so vast an area as north-western Australia; and the more modern
theory of a great inland sea was rather strengthened by the
explorations of 1838.</p>
<p>The next great expeditions of discovery, if we except the
brilliant sortie of Count Strzelecki into Gippsland in 1840, are
those of Mr Edward John Eyre in 1838-1841. The successes of this
intrepid explorer can only be described as little short of
marvellous; for, with but very scanty assistance, he practically
pierced the great continent from east to west. His first
expedition was an attempt to drive a mob of 300 cattle from
Sydney to Adelaide. Leaving Sydney, with only six followers, in
November 1837, he succeeded in reaching Adelaide eight months
later, thus establishing the possibility of a new trade route of
infinite importance to the commerce of Australia. At the close of
the next year Mr Eyre, with double the number of cattle and a
flock of a thousand sheep, repeated his journey from Sydney to
Adelaide, reducing the time occupied by the journey to about
three months. Immediately afterwards, as though to demonstrate
the impossibility of failure, he plunged into entirely new
territory, and led a flock of sheep over the three hundred miles
of then unknown country between King George's Sound and the
settlement at Swan River, thus demonstrating the possibility of
avoiding the dreaded Cape Leeuwin, and establishing a trade route
between Adelaide and Perth, as he had done formerly between
Sydney and Adelaide. Anyone who has made practical acquaintance
with the difficulties of Australian travelling, even in these
modern times, can hardly admire too greatly the patience and
resource, the courage and energy, which carried Mr Eyre through
the difficulties of these expeditions.</p>
<p>But a greater triumph was in store. Aided now to some extent
by public liberality, Mr Eyre, in the year 1840, started on an
expedition northward from Spencer's Gulf, to explore the
interior. He soon reached Lake Torrens; but here even his
sagacity was baffled, and, after vain attempts to proceed towards
the north, he suddenly struck out in a south-westerly direction
and reached the coast on the western or far side of the great
inlet known as Spencer's Gulf, at Port Lincoln. Returning thence
by a circuitous route to Adelaide, Eyre a second time set out
from the capital in a northerly direction. Again baffled by the
country about Lake Torrens, he found himself once more, at the
close of the year 1840, on the southern coast, but this time at
Fowler's Bay, hundreds of miles to the west of Port Lincoln. Here
he conceived the daring project of penetrating through the
absolutely unknown country which lay between him and the
settlement at King George's Sound, almost the extreme western
point of the continent. Sending back all his followers who would
go to Adelaide, the intrepid explorer, accompanied only by one
white man and three aborigines, actually succeeded, after
undergoing the utmost extremes of hardship, in reaching his
destination. Often he had to march for five or six days without
finding a drop of water. At the head of the Great Australian
Bight his little company shewed signs of extreme dejection, and
even of mutiny; and, in addition to all the inevitable cares of
the journey, there fell upon Eyre's shoulders the burden of
watching for an outbreak against which he would be powerless to
stand, and which would probably seal the fate of the party. At
length the tragedy happened. During Eyre's temporary absence from
the camp, two of the blacks murdered his white companion,
plundered the scanty stock of provisions, and fled into the bush.
The explorer was now left in a fearful position. Behind him lay
an impenetrable and apparently barren country. The nearest
settlement to the east was at a distance of 400 miles, to the
west of 600. Before him lay the inhospitable ocean. His
provisions were almost exhausted, his horses nearly dead of
starvation. But no thought of despair seems to have crossed his
mind. In his own account he says simply&mdash;"I had no time for
deliberation"; and, accordingly, he pushed on at once. After
another hundred miles of travelling, which occupied no less than
a month, he met with an incident to which he, in all probability,
owed his life. Visiting the shore near Cape Le Grand, he saw, to
his great delight, a large French vessel, by whose captain he and
his one follower were kindly entertained for twelve days. But
nothing could break the resoluteness of his purpose. In spite of
the dissuasions of his deliverers, Eyre insisted on being put on
shore again, and at last, after another four weeks of enterprise,
reached Albany on the 7th July, 1841. Unhappily, the report he
had to give of the country through which he travelled was about
as unfavourable as it could possibly be; and for many years after
his journey the whole of the land between Spencer's Gulf and King
George's Sound was believed to be a barren wilderness. Subsequent
explorations have modified without essentially refuting his
report. Happily, an expedition made in the year 1844 by Governor
Grey of South Australia (the north-western explorer of 1838), in
a precisely opposite direction, resulted in a more favourable
account. Following the coast from Adelaide to the boundary of
Victoria (then part of New South Wales) Governor Grey found an
abundance of land suitable for settlement. Inasmuch as Sir Thomas
Mitchell's expedition of 1836 had reached the Glenelg River, a
few miles from Governor Grey's easternmost point, and as, three
years previously, Mr Orr had explored the coast east of Port
Phillip as far as Corner inlet, the southern coast of the
continent was fairly well known by the end of the year 1844. The
general result of the discoveries was that, taking Adelaide as
the dividing point, the country to the west was sterile and
unpromising, while that to the east was fruitful and rich. The
subsequent exploration of the Gippsland coast only served to
confirm this view.</p>
<p>We have next to notice the three celebrated expeditions of
Ludwig Leichhardt, a German explorer, in the north-east. The
first of these was entirely successful; the two latter ended in
disaster. Leaving Brisbane in October 1844, Dr Leichhardt
followed the north-east coast in an almost parallel line, along
the range of hills which extends nearly to the base of York
Peninsula. Here striking to the west, he made for the shores of
the Gulf of Carpentaria; but, having the misfortune to lose his
companion, Mr Gilbert, in an encounter with the natives, he
turned south and followed the course of the gulf until he came to
Limmen Bight, where he again struck north-west, and at last
arrived at Port Essington, a British naval station established a
few years before on the Gulf of Van Diemen. During his journey he
made valuable observations on the character of what is now
northern Queensland; and his supporters, who had given him up for
lost, were enthusiastic in their welcome when he suddenly
re-appeared in Brisbane. His success had inspired him with the
hope of further discoveries; and, being generously supplied with
stores and equipment, he almost immediately set out upon a daring
attempt to pierce the heart of the continent in a journey from
east to west. The almost invariable fate of large expeditions,
however, overtook the party. Dissensions arose, the animals,
becoming unmanageable, either died or disappeared; and the
explorers soon returned without having accomplished anything
noteworthy. Nothing daunted, Leichhardt set out a third time,
with a small company, and never reappeared. The last news
reported him only at a short distance from Brisbane; after that
all traces were lost.</p>
<p>Passing by the expeditions of Captain Sturt from Adelaide in
1845 and 1846, which, undertaken with an object similar to that
of Eyre, seemed to establish the impossibility of penetrating
from south to north of the continent, we come to the numerous
expeditions of the years 1860-2, which resulted in the final
achievement of the long-desired object. The greatest name in this
eventful period is perhaps that of M<sup>c</sup>Douall Stuart, a
man of indomitable courage and perseverance, whose efforts were
not merely successful in the long run, but were successful
without the loss of a single human life. No less than four times
did he essay his great task, only to be driven back by
overwhelming obstacles. The first three journeys, in which he
does not seem to have gone beyond Eyre's northernmost point, were
by his friends termed "preparatory journeys;" and perhaps the two
earlier were undertaken more by way of proof of his powers than
as serious attempts to reach the northern coasts. But the great
object was always before his eyes, and on his third journey,
which lasted from April 1859 to January 1860, he would probably
have made a bold push for the north, but for the unsatisfactory
character of three of his small handful of followers. One of them
actually deserted him in the night, and very nearly lost his life
by his folly. The other two could not be relied upon; and, with
great reluctance, Stuart had to turn his face southward at the
end of the year 1859. He immediately, however, started again with
only two faithful followers, and, after a journey of four months,
through incredible hardships, actually succeeded in reaching a
point within 200 miles of the Gulf of Carpentaria. It was an
exceptionally dry and hot year, even for central Australia.
Though Stuart started at what should have been the beginning of
the rainy season, he seems to have seen practically no rain the
whole way. He and his men suffered intensely from scurvy; and the
horses were in a sorry plight. Still they were determined to push
on. But, as they neared the northern coast, the appearance of
large bodies of hostile aborigines, evidently superior in
intelligence to the tribes of the far interior, and determinedly
opposed to his further progress, warned Stuart of the unknown
dangers to which he might be exposing his feeble party, and
compelled him reluctantly to turn back. He had discovered and
named a mountain which he believed to be the centre of Australia,
and, with true British patriotism, had planted upon it the
national flag, with a fervent hope that the blessings of
civilization might speedily dawn upon the then benighted land. In
September 1860 he reached once more his starting point at
Chambers' Creek, disappointed but not daunted. In less than three
months he had collected an exploring party of ten men, and
started from Adelaide on a fifth attempt. This time his trials
were comparatively light, and his success complete. Keeping
considerably to the west of his former tracks, and following a
line of hills which supplied him with water and grass during the
whole of his journey, he reached the shores of Van Diemen's Gulf
near, but not at the mouth of, the river Adelaide, on the 25th
July, 1862, just six months after leaving the northern limit of
the settled districts of South Australia. Although the season had
again been exceptionally dry, he had only been two nights without
water; and his journey appeared to establish the possibility not
only of an overland telegraph (its main object), but of an
overland route for the sheep and cattle of South Australia to the
waters of the Indian Ocean and the crowded markets of the East.
The overland telegraph was, before very long, an accomplished
fact; but the overland cattle route has not yet been established.
A still greater political result, however, followed from Stuart's
expeditions; for, though it is by no means clear that he was
actually the first to cross the continent, his explorations were
held to give his fellow-colonists a primary claim to the vast
territories traversed by him. In the year 1863 the colony of
South Australia, which had already received some additions by a
statute of the Imperial Parliament in 1861, was invested with the
huge Northern Territory, which included the site of the abortive
colony of North Australia, founded in 1838, refounded in 1846,
and extinguished in 1849. This expansion extended the territory
under the rule of the Governor at Adelaide from the Pacific to
the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the other colonies had not been idle. In 1861, Mr
F. T. Gregory, of Western Australia, aided by his Government, and
supported as a base of operations by the barque <i>Dolphin</i>,
which cruised round the north-western coasts, accomplished a long
and useful course of inland exploration along the Hammersley
Ranges to the south, and then east from the coast as far as Mount
Macpherson. But the expedition which excited the most interest
was that of Burke and Wills, which left Melbourne in August 1860,
to attempt the overland route from south to north. The expedition
was large and well-found; and a special feature of its equipment
was the introduction of camels, which, however, proved of very
little use. But again it appeared that a small body of united and
resolute men, even though poorly equipped, is far more effective
in exploration than a large expedition, which is liable to
dissensions, and can never move without an extensive supply of
provisions. Even before the borders of civilization had been
reached, the party had divided; the advanced section, under Burke
and Wills, reaching Cooper's Creek (at the extreme south-west of
the present colony of Queensland) in November 1860. Here a
dep&ocirc;t was formed; and a still smaller party, consisting
only of Burke, Wills, King, and Gray, pushed on alone to
accomplish the larger half of the journey, leaving the others,
under Brah&eacute;, to await their return at Cooper's Creek. In
view of subsequent events, the precise nature of the instructions
left with Brah&eacute; is a matter of importance; but,
unfortunately, it seems impossible to ascertain it. Brah&eacute;
asserted in his formal report to the Committee of Management in
Melbourne, that he was ordered by Burke to remain for "three
months, or longer, if provisions and other circumstances would
permit". But Mr Wright, left in charge of the rearmost party, who
fell in with Brah&eacute; soon after the latter had commenced his
retreat, states in his report that Brah&eacute; at first admitted
an order to wait "three or four months". As a matter of fact,
Brah&eacute; waited at Cooper's Creek just over four months, from
the 16th December to the 21st April, 1861, and then, finding his
provisions running short, and having two or three men down with
scurvy, he commenced his homeward journey, leaving, however, a
small supply of provisions in case of Burke's return. On the
evening of the very day on which Brah&eacute; left Cooper's
Creek, the advanced party, having, in spite of severe hardships
and the death of one of its number, reached the tidal waters of
the Flinders, which flows into the Gulf of Carpentaria, arrived
at the Creek. Notwithstanding their bitter disappointment at
finding the camp deserted, the explorers made a desperate though
unsuccessful attempt to reach home. They had already lost four of
their camels, the remaining two soon died. Instead of returning
on his old track, which perhaps would have been the wisest plan,
Burke decided to push direct for Mount Hopeless, which he
believed to be only about 150 miles from Cooper's Creek. But the
strength of the party was utterly unequal to the task. The
provisions failed; and, though the aborigines fed them with fish
and nardoo cake, this was no diet for men already enfeebled, and
before whom lay an arduous journey. Wills was the first to
succumb. Heroically insisting on his companions leaving him alone
to die, as their only chance of safety, he lay down and was never
seen alive again. A few days later Burke gave way, and, less
heroic than Wills, begged his faithful follower to remain with
him till he was dead. The end soon came, and King was now left
absolutely alone. Returning to the scene of Wills' death, he
buried the body, and then followed the tracks of the aborigines
till he came to a camp, where he was kindly treated; though it is
obvious that the blacks did not altogether like such an addition
to the demands on their scanty supply of food.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the returning party under Brah&eacute; had fallen
in with the rearmost section under Wright. The latter, harassed
by the blacks, and unsuccessful in finding his way, had lost
several men, and had entirely failed to reach Cooper's Creek.
Aided now by Brah&eacute;'s knowledge of the country, he, with
Brah&eacute; and three horses, pushed rapidly to Cooper's Creek,
and reached the dep&ocirc;t on May 8th, 1861. Oddly enough,
however, he failed to find any traces of Burke, though the latter
had left word of his intended movements in a "plant". Then,
abandoning all hope, the survivors of the expedition set off on
their homeward journey, probably just about the time at which
Burke and Wills were dying of starvation. Immediately upon their
arrival, relief expeditions were organized for the purpose of
finding the lost travellers; and, on the 15th September, 1861,
the Victorian party, under Mr A. W. Howitt, fell in with King,
who, though in a state of extreme wretchedness, had managed, with
the aid of the friendly blacks, to keep himself alive. The
melancholy fate of Burke and Wills was established beyond doubt
by Mr Howitt; and the records buried by the dead men were
recovered and brought to Melbourne, where they created a profound
sensation. Ultimately the bodies of the explorers were recovered,
and accorded a public funeral.</p>
<p>With the explorations of Stuart and Burke may be said to end
the heroic age of Australian exploration. Without in the least
wishing to detract from the arduous and successful labours of
their successors, it may be pointed out that, with the final
return of the search parties despatched to seek for Burke and
Wills, the mantle of thick darkness which had so long hung over
the interior of Australia was finally dispersed. The continent
had been crossed in two directions from west to east in the
extreme north by the Gregorys and Leichhardt, in the extreme
south by Eyre and Grey. Twice had explorers travelled from south
to north; and, though the last expedition had ended in disaster,
its records survived as a guide to future travellers. The area of
settlement was spreading with rapidity, as the excitement of the
gold discoveries was wearing away. The most conspicuous gap on
the chart of Australia was the middle desert of Western
Australia, lying north and south of the Tropic of Capricorn. This
desert was crossed in two directions by Mr Giles and Mr John
Forrest in the years 1874 and 1875. Exploration in the south-west
was also successfully accomplished by Mr Alexander Forrest and Mr
Giles, about the same time. Earlier explorers on the north-west
coast had been Mr Dalrymple, Mr Martin, the Messrs Jardine, Mr
Sholl, and the members of the Leichhardt relief expedition
despatched in the year 1869 by the Government of Western
Australia. Gradually the general features of the continent became
known; and the object of future expeditions will rather be to
furnish exact reports of hitherto neglected spots, than to make
any startling discoveries in geographical science.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br>
<br>
<small>MAORI WARS IN NEW ZEALAND.</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> introduction of Responsible Government in
New Zealand did not at once put an end to the questions which
agitated the colony. Amongst these the most acute, and perhaps
also the most important, was the question of the relations
between the European and the Maori races. We have seen how this
question had raised its head at the time of the first settlement;
it was still unsolved when Governor Gore Browne took over the
seals of office from Colonel Wynyard in 1855. The white settlers
were increasing in numbers and power; the Maoris were decreasing
in number, but were as brave as ever, and better equipped than
before. Openly or secretly, the white settlers held it their
destiny to occupy the land. Openly and more aggressively, as
their hopes of success dwindled, the Maoris avowed it to be their
policy to yield to the white man nothing more than the terms of
the Treaty of Waitangi. The struggle, though it embraced many
points of issue, always centred itself round the question of land
purchase. The whites, eager to acquire land, hungered for
permission to deal directly with individual Maori occupants. The
Imperial Government, fearing the result of such dealings, had
expressly forbidden any purchase of Maori lands save through the
Crown; and, in granting Responsible Government, had reserved
Maori questions from the control of the Colonial Ministers,
urging that, so long as Imperial troops were needed for the
protection of the colony, so long must the Imperial Government
retain control over the only subject which ever compelled their
use. The Maoris themselves were divided into an aristocratic or
patriotic party, which vowed eternal hostility against all
proposals to part with more of the Maori land, and a
Europeanizing or progressive party, which adopted the ways and
manners of the white man, and was willing to sell its rights for
immediate material advantages. It may be asked&mdash;why did not
each party follow its own wishes, and deal with its own property
as it pleased? The answer is obvious. The aristocratic party
altogether denied the existence of individual property in land,
or, at least, the right of individual occupants to sell it
without the consent of their tribe. A Government Commission which
investigated the whole Native Question in 1856 reported that the
evidence in favour of this view was overwhelming. "Generally
there is no such thing as an individual claim clear and
independent of tribal right." Yet Europeans would persist in
attempting to negotiate directly with the apparent owners of
land, notwithstanding that the Native Secretary was doing his
best, and not unsuccessfully, to buy enough land for settlement
from the tribal authorities. A large purchase which the New
Zealand Company alleged itself to have made from the Maoris at
Taranaki in 1840 was (as we shall see) a source of endless
trouble and danger. Again and again disputes broke out, and
finally, in November 1856, a large Maori gathering near Lake
Taupo pledged itself to oppose any further sale of Maori lands,
even to the British Government.</p>
<p>The hostility manifested by the Maoris towards European
progress naturally embittered the feelings of the Europeans
towards the Maoris. So long as the Native Minister was not a real
Minister, but merely a person whose advice the Governor was not
bound to accept, while he might act upon the advice of the Native
Secretary, an Imperial official acting as the Governor's
subordinate, the General Assembly could not proceed very actively
in Native Affairs. But, by attempting to impede the distribution
of the annual sum reserved by the Constitution Act for Native
Purposes, and by importuning the Imperial Government to transfer
to it the direct control of Native Affairs, it no doubt fed the
flames of wrath in the minds of the leading Maoris, who were
perfectly well informed of what went on in the Parliament House
at Auckland. An elaborate series of Bills, framed in the year
1858 by the General Assembly with the object of securing the
control over Maori land questions, was severely handled by the
Imperial Government; and only a part of its provisions became
law. A map prepared in 1859 by the Government surveyor shews
that, even up to that date, the Maoris had succeeded in retaining
their hold on the great bulk of the land in the North Island,
where indeed the whites only held patches about Auckland,
Wellington, New Plymouth, the Bay of Islands, and Hawke's Bay,
and at the mouths of the Wanganui and Manawatu. All the great
Middle Island, with very scanty exceptions, had been acquired by
the Europeans; the small Southern Island was still nominally
Maori. The centre of Maori disaffection was the scene of the
great meeting formerly alluded to, viz. Lake Taupo, in the very
heart of the North Island. Here the chiefs who lived on the great
river Waikato had succeeded in forming a league against land
selling, which gradually developed into the "King" movement
&mdash;i.e. an attempt to set up a Maori sovereignty under a
chief named Potatau, who, however, was by no means entirely
hostile to the Europeans.</p>
<p>At the commencement of the year 1860 affairs came to a crisis;
but, in order to appreciate the meaning of the ensuing struggle,
it is necessary to review very briefly the leading incidents in
the history of the nominal cause of the war.</p>
<p>It appears that, in a year which is variously stated by local
evidence to have been 1830 and 1834, the powerful tribes living
on the Waikato river had made a descent upon the settlements of
the Ngatiawa tribe, in the beautiful and fertile district of
Taranaki. The Waikato raid had been a complete success, mainly
owing to the absence of the fighting men of the Ngatiawa, who
were engaged on an expedition elsewhere. So thoroughly were the
Ngatiawa defeated, that the greater part of them abandoned
Taranaki, and went to live at Waikanae, a district at least 100
miles south of their former settlement, though on the same
western coast of the North Island. A few, however, of the
Ngatiawa remained in the mountain fastnesses of Mount Egmont, the
lovely snow-capped mountain which rears its head above the
streams and green forests of Taranaki; and a few stragglers from
neighbouring districts occupied some of the deserted "pahs" and
lodges of the defeated Ngatiawa. But no general resettlement was
made; for the fierce Waikatos, though withdrawing to their own
districts, threatened to come down again with fire and sword as
soon as it became worth their while to do so.</p>
<p>Such was the state of affairs when New Zealand became a
British colony, and one of the first objects of the energetic
agents of the New Zealand Company was to acquire a large tract of
the fertile and apparently deserted district of Taranaki. In the
year 1840, Colonel Wakefield believed himself to have
accomplished this object. Through the intervention of a Pakeha
Maori, one Barrett, who had been settled for some years in the
district, he procured the signatures (or rather, marks) of
several persons to a deed professing to convey an immense tract
of country to the trustees of the New Zealand Company. It is
difficult to know precisely the claim of the persons who
professed to sell the land. They are described in the deed as
"chiefs of the district of Nga Motu"; but their chiefship was
afterwards alleged to have been somewhat of the same character as
the kingly descent of modern Irish claimants, and, in any case,
there was no such thing in the New Zealand of 1840 as the chief
of a district. It was the tribe, not the district, which was the
basis of rule; and it appears probable that the signers of the
deed of 1840 were mere casual occupants, who knew the weakness of
their title, and were glad to sell for what they could get.
Moreover, they lived in constant fear of the Waikatos, and felt
that the presence of Europeans was some kind of a protection.</p>
<p>A suspicion does indeed appear to have crossed the minds of
the Company's agents that the conquering Waikatos might claim an
interest in the land; and, accordingly, on the advice of Governor
Hobson, the Company made a payment of a small sum to one of the
Waikato chiefs, to induce him to waive his rights of conquest.
But it does not appear to have suggested itself, either to the
Governor or to Colonel Wakefield, that they were all the while
neglecting the real owners of the land, namely, the Ngatiawa,
living in exile at Waikanae, whose ancestral rights could,
according to Maori custom, be extinguished neither by conquest
nor by informal abandonment.</p>
<p>Then came the proclamation which refused to recognize any
title acquired direct from the Maoris, the Land Sales Act of
1842, and the special enquiry concerning land titles conducted by
Mr Spain, the Imperial Commissioner. When he came to the alleged
purchase of 1840, Mr Spain deliberated long, but ultimately
pronounced a decision to the effect that 60,000 acres had been
bought on equitable terms, and that the Company was entitled to a
Crown grant thereof. But Governor Fitzroy, in 1844, reversed this
decision, and declined to allow a Crown grant to issue. Having
regard, however, to the fact that many of the Company's settlers
had actually taken up land, and that, in fact, the town of New
Plymouth had come into existence on the faith of the purchase,
the Governor exerted himself to effect a new purchase of 3,500
acres in and around the township, which he hoped would prove
sufficient for the immediate wants of the settlers. But, with
almost incredible short-sightedness, while he repudiated the
purchase of 1840 as invalid, he waived the Crown's right of
pre-emption over the block in question; and gave permission to
the Company's settlers to acquire sections of it by direct
purchase, on satisfying the claims of the exiles at Waikanae.</p>
<p>A more suicidal policy could hardly have been imagined. It at
once raised in the minds of the Ngatiawa at Waikanae visions of
unlimited blackmail, to be levied on the unfortunate settlers.
They had only to wait until some confiding farmer, tired of
seeing a fine patch of land lying idle, had built his house and
expended his capital in improvements, and then to come down on
him one by one with claims for compensation. The wretched settler
would never know when he had done with such demands; for if, as
seemed quite possible, the land rights of Maori children were
held to be inalienable by their parents, a perpetual and
hereditary succession of bloodsuckers would be fastened on his
homestead. And yet, every fresh payment would make him less
willing to abandon his holding.</p>
<p>Governor Grey saw at a glance the folly of his predecessor's
action and, in the year 1847, announced his intention of
confirming Mr Spain's award, and of making a Crown grant to the
Company of the 60,000 acres, though, out of consideration for the
hopes raised by Governor Fitzroy's action, he offered to pay a
small sum by way of <i>solatium</i> to the Waikanae exiles. But
it was too late. In the very next year (1848) a fleet of canoes
brought back from Waikanae to Taranaki a body of nearly 600
Maoris, among them Wiremu Kingi Te Whiti, or William King, an
Europeanized Maori, who exercised great influence over the
Ngatiawa. Their return was soon followed by brawls and bloodshed,
which, though at first confined to Maoris, were so obviously
dangerous to the peace of the district, that, in February 1858,
Governor Browne at length issued a proclamation declaring that
all persons, Maori or European, found under arms, would be
treated as rebels. This proclamation, being badly translated into
Maori, produced further ill-feeling; and the two races were
obviously drifting into war.</p>
<p>The spark was kindled by the offer of a friendly chief named
Teira to sell to the British Government a block of land on the
Waitara river, which flows into the sea about eight miles north
of New Plymouth. The offer was first made at a great meeting held
to welcome the Governor; and it was at once repudiated by Wiremu
Kingi on behalf of his tribe. Nevertheless, negotiations were
proceeded with; and, Teira having received &pound;100 on account
of the purchase-money, the Government determined to proceed to a
survey. Now the act of survey was always regarded by the Maoris
as the decisive step; and it was clear to all that some
demonstration would be made when the operation should be
attempted. Just at this crisis the emissaries of the Waikatos
arrived, and endeavoured to turn the quarrel about land into the
larger question of Maori nationality and independence. Wiremu
Kingi was at first opposed to the new idea, for he feared that
his own importance would be dwarfed by that of the Maori king
Potatau; but he could not draw back, and, on the 20th February,
1860, a party of 70 or 80 Maoris forcibly repulsed a party under
Mr Parris, the District Commissioner, who was attempting to
survey the Waitara block.</p>
<p>This outbreak of insubordination was promptly met by the
Governor, who arrived at New Plymouth with reinforcements on the
1st March. Wiremu Kingi attempted to impede his landing, but,
upon a threat to fire, gave way and withdrew into the woods. He,
however, refused to come to an interview; and, hostilities being
inevitable, the outlying settlers were called in, block-houses
built, and further reinforcements summoned. Colonel Gold was sent
to take up a position at the mouth of the Waitara to protect the
survey, which the Governor fully intended to carry out, but with
strict injunctions to avoid, if possible, drawing the first
blood.</p>
<p>It is possible that, at this moment, the European authorities
were inclined to underestimate the immense attractions to the
Maoris of a race war. It had for some years been apparent to the
keen observation of the natives that they were being slowly
extinguished by the march of European settlement. They could not
hope to compete with the European in the peaceful arts, for the
simple reason that, with all their brilliant abilities, they
could not bring themselves to regard money-making as a serious
business. No one is keener for money than the Maori, when money
is to be obtained by force, by a sudden effort of cunning, or
even by begging. But he cannot submit to years of drudgery with
the sole object of making a fortune. He lives for excitement; and
love, oratory, and war, but especially war, are the means by
which he obtains it. The Maori is a born warrior not a mere
brutal bully, but a strategist, a skilful engineer, a daring and
successful skirmisher. When Wiremu Kingi offered the Maoris war
in 1860, he offered them an occupation for which their souls were
pining, and from which they had been long debarred.</p>
<p>On the 17th March Kingi erected a pah of defiance on the
Waitara block. After two days of hard fighting, in which he lost
several men, Colonel Gold captured the pah, only to find that it
had been abandoned, to admire the ingenuity of its construction,
and to realize that he had effected nothing. Ten days later, the
tribes were up in the south; and New Plymouth lay between hostile
fires. It required all the efforts of the Governor, aided by
Colonel Gold and Captain Cracroft of H.M.S. <i>Niger</i>, who
cruised along the coast, to protect it. There is no safe
anchorage in Taranaki Bight; and, whenever the west wind blew,
the ships had to make for sea. In his alarm the Governor summoned
speedy aid from Sydney and Melbourne, and wrote home urging the
despatch of at least 3,000 troops. Auckland was put into a state
of defence, and explanatory manifestoes were issued, with the
object of disabusing the Maoris of misapprehensions deliberately
fostered by designing persons. An unpleasant incident of the
period was an open difference of opinion between the Government
and the respected Bishop of New Zealand, with regard to the
justification of the policy adopted by the military
authorities.</p>
<p>Meantime, the proceedings in the Taranaki District went on. On
the 27th June, 1860, a party under Major Nelson suffered a severe
repulse on the Waitara, in attempting to take a pah which was
garrisoned conjointly by the Ngatiawa under Wiremu Kingi and many
of the Waikato warriors. Almost immediately afterwards, Potatau,
the Maori king, died; and the removal of his pacific influence
was a great blow to those who had hoped for a neutral attitude on
the part of the Waikato confederation. The arrival of
Major-General Pratt from Melbourne, to take command of the
forces, raised the spirits of the colonists; but it was some time
before he could obtain any decisive success. The mysterious
relations between the Waikatos and the Ngatiawa in Taranaki
rendered operations in that district very difficult; and the
unfortunate murder of a Maori near Auckland in October rendered
it probable that a combined attack would be made by all the
Maoris in the North Island on the comparatively defenceless
capital. At last, however, on the 6th November, a detachment of
600 men under the Major-General inflicted a severe defeat on a
party of Waikatos at the pah Mahoetahi; and, on the 29th
December, the British troops succeeded in dislodging the Waikatos
from a strong position which they had taken up on the Waitara,
driving them back into the forest. In spite of difficulties
arising from imperfect ammunition, and disputes as to precedence
between officers of the regular forces and those of the Taranaki
militia and volunteers, General Pratt pushed his redoubts
steadily forward, and, on the 23rd January, 1861, repulsed a
large party of Maoris who had attacked the foremost position. So
far from decisive, however, was this success, that the Native
Secretary, Mr Donald McLean, in a lengthy memorandum composed ten
days later, drew the gravest picture of general disaffection
among the Maori tribes, and stated it to be his deliberate
opinion, "that the English settlements in New Zealand are at
present in a more dangerous and precarious state than they have
been at any period since the foundation of the colony." The
Native Secretary's opinion was backed by the Responsible Native
Minister, an official not by any means naturally disposed to take
the same view of affairs as the Native Secretary; and it was
evident that the colony had a difficult task before it. The most
hopeful prospect of peace appeared in the conduct of William
Thompson, a great Maori chief, who came down to the scene of
hostilities in March with the avowed object of putting an end to
the war. But it soon became clear that William Thompson, powerful
as he was, had great difficulty in soothing the angry suspicions
of the war party; and when General Pratt, on the severance of New
Zealand from the Australian command, left the colony at the end
of the month, peace was by no means established. With the arrival
of General Cameron hostilities gradually ceased, but it could not
be said that either party had attained its object; and peace
negotiations were still dragging on when, in August 1861, news
arrived in the colony that Sir George Grey had been reappointed
to his old Governorship, and would soon appear to take the helm
of affairs.</p>
<p>Sir George came in hot haste from the Cape, landed in New
Zealand at the end of November 1861, and took the oaths of office
on the 3rd December. With characteristic energy, he set to work
to find out the real state of affairs, and, with this object, he
sought information from all sources, personally visiting the
Maori districts. His accounts throw a strong light on that most
interesting subject of study, the Maori character. He found that
the warrior chiefs, the men whose names had struck terror to the
hearts of the Taranaki settlers, were employing the leisure of a
truce in founding schools and cultivating literature and oratory.
The one thing that the Maori could not appreciate was uniformity
of government and occupation. It seemed to him too dull. To him
it appeared natural that the strongest and most capable man in a
district should set up a government of his own and rule in his
own way. Even the King movement was dying out for want of
excitement A threat of war, a breath of patriotic agitation,
would have brought it to vigorous life again; but it appeared too
cumbrous for ordinary use. The Governor found, living peacefully
in the heart of the disaffected country, an Englishman named
Armitage. This gentleman, by a public notice set up on his land,
intimated his intention of personally collecting a fine of one
shilling from every trespasser upon his property, which, be it
observed, he held direct from the Maoris, in open defiance of
British law. A weak Governor would have protested against such
conduct as insubordination, and discountenanced the offender,
even if he had not punished him. Grey promptly appointed him a
Resident Magistrate with a salary from the Government, and thus
secured a capable supporter in the heart of the enemy's country.
He followed up this bold stroke by proposing a generous
expenditure of money on Maori purposes, and an organization of
the Maori districts on lines which should fully recognize and
adopt, as the basis of government, the "runangas" or tribal
gatherings of the native race. Finally, he wrote home suggesting
that the Imperial Government should now hand over the control of
Native Affairs to the Responsible Ministers, without entirely
withdrawing its military support An almost simultaneous discovery
or rediscovery of gold in the Coromandel Ranges, near Auckland,
added to the hopefulness of the colony; and it at first seemed as
though Sir George Grey were about to achieve a magical
success.</p>
<p>But the tide soon turned. The Home Government, while assenting
to the suggestion of the Governor that the control of Native
Affairs should be handed over to the Colonial Ministers, declined
to waive its demand for contribution to military expenses; and
the colonists were thus made to realize that, in return for
complete independence, they must pay the heavy penalty, not only
of military charges, but of the philanthropic measures which were
part of Sir George Grey's scheme. This discovery naturally damped
their eagerness for autonomy; and they now declined the proffered
boon. But the Secretary of State intimated that it was too late
to draw back; and, with much misgiving, the colonists took up the
heavy task. In spite of a sharp passage of arms with the
Secretary of State, who had committed the grave irregularity of
publishing, and even acting upon, a communication from General
Cameron which reflected on the Governor's conduct, without
allowing the latter an opportunity of meeting the charges, Sir
George Grey persevered in his plans. He gradually organized the
Native Districts, promptly suppressed Maori feuds, pushed on the
military road from Auckland to the Waikato, and finally, at the
beginning of June, 1863, re-occupied in force two large blocks of
land south of New Plymouth, from which the European settlers had
been driven during the outbreak in 1861.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year 1863 it almost seemed as though
the war were at an end. To avoid all further provocation, the
Governor strongly re commended the entire abandonment of the
attempt to purchase the Waitara block, the very <i>casus
belli</i> itself. Notwithstanding the success of General
Cameron's arms, and the repeated assurances of officials sent by
the Government to investigate the title, the Governor could not
satisfy himself that Wiremu Kingi's claims were entirely
baseless; and Wiremu's party never ceased to protest against the
legality of the sale by Teira. Sir George Grey saw that, with the
bulk of the purchase-money still to be paid, with the expense of
surveys and military protection, with native reserves to be
deducted, and claims of dispossessed settlers to be provided for,
the colony as a whole would gain little by the completion of the
purchase. But the Ministers could not be brought to look at the
matter in the same light; and, whilst negotiations were still
dragging on, a party of Englishmen coming along the beach to New
Plymouth were brutally murdered by a Maori ambush on the 4th of
May, 1863. In a moment the whole country from the Waikato to the
west coast was in a blaze. There could now be no immediate
thought of conciliation. Troops were hastily massed at New
Plymouth. On the 5th June, General Cameron stormed and captured
the position of the Maoris on the Katikara, fifteen miles south
of New Plymouth; but this repulse did not seriously damp the
courage of the Maoris, who, on the 17th July, made a combined and
daring attack on General Cameron's troops (now strengthened by
the arrival of the Royal Irish) in two different places. The
attack was not successful; but news received from the officer in
command at Wanganui, an European settlement on the road between
New Plymouth and Wellington, shewed that the Maori plan included
an attempt on that place; and an intercepted letter dated 29th
June, addressed by the Waikato chiefs to the Maoris settled at
Waikanae, placed beyond all doubt the existence of a complete
scheme of attack, covering all the European settlements in the
North Island. During the rest of the year small engagements, in
which the British troops were nearly always successful, took
place; and the superiority of the Europeans in the field was
clearly established. Unfortunately, no decisive blow could be
inflicted; the defeat of an attacking party was merely followed
by another attack, and the simultaneous occurrence of raids upon
different settlements on the same day shewed that the Maoris had
adopted a highly skilful plan of guerilla warfare, against which
it was difficult to make any headway except by military
operations on a great scale. The occurrence of several dastardly
murders of unarmed settlers, including even women and children,
in the later months of the year, proved that the war was
degenerating on the part of the Maoris into a horrible race
vendetta; and the colonists, now thoroughly alarmed and thirsting
for vengeance, determined on severe measures. In December, 1863,
the Assembly passed a series of statutes which provided for the
establishment of a system of military government in the disturbed
districts, to be followed by a wholesale confiscation of rebel
lands, and the settlement upon them of military occupants,
prepared to defend their possessions by the sword. With some
reluctance the Home Government, which had now, as we have seen,
handed over the control of Native Affairs to the Colonial
Parliament, allowed the measures to pass.</p>
<p>It is, however, one thing to decide upon confiscation, and
another to enforce it; and, during the first three months of the
year 1864, there seemed no immediate prospect of bringing the war
to a close. But April and May were eventful, if not entirely
favourable to the British arms. On the 28th of the former month,
a large body of east coast Maoris, who had at last been persuaded
to join the Waikatos in the west, were interrupted in their march
and severely defeated by the powerful Arawa tribe, through whose
territories they had to pass. This event was, of course, doubly
welcome, as it shewed that the Waikato confederation failed to
include all the Maori tribes; but its effect was almost
immediately neutralized by a severe defeat suffered by General
Cameron in his attack on a position known as the Gate Pah, near
Tauranga Harbour on the east coast (Bay of Plenty). The British
lost thirty-two men, including eleven of the Naval Brigade; and
the list of other casualties was considerable. But fortune again
turned. On the very next day, Captain Shortt defeated the
desperate attack of a body of fanatic Maoris, who were preaching
the expulsion of the white settler as a religious duty. A
fortnight later, a second intertribal battle resulted in favour
of British interests; another body of fanatics being severely
handled by friendly Wanganui tribes in their attempt to attack
the British settlements in that district. Finally, on the 21st
June, the defeat at Tauranga was amply avenged by a brilliant
victory obtained by Colonel Greer, almost on the same spot, over
a powerfully entrenched force of 600 Maoris. The enemy's forces
were practically cut to pieces; more than a hundred were left
dead on the field. Above all, Rawiri, a great plundering chief,
the implacable but chivalrous foe of the British, was slain,
fighting desperately to the last. On the 5th August, the Tauranga
tribes made an absolute submission to the Governor in person. The
most serious drawback to these substantial successes was the
escape from Kawau of a large body of prisoners who, it was
feared, would spread the war into a hitherto peaceful district.
It must be remembered that, to a Maori, especially to a warrior,
imprisonment was a far worse evil than death; and it was foreseen
that the escaped prisoners would carry with them feelings of
undying hatred to the British race.</p>
<p>The history of the next two or three years cannot be regarded
as entirely satisfactory. It consisted largely of differences of
opinion between the Governor and his Ministers, of
misapprehensions and explanations by successive Secretaries of
State, and of allegations and counter-allegations by the General
in command and the Governor. Nothing could more forcibly have
demonstrated the evils of divided government in a time of strain.
The Governor, bound by the recent decision of the Colonial Office
to follow the advice of his Responsible Ministers in all matters,
was yet, as an Imperial official, bound also to guard the
interests of the Crown, and especially to maintain its treaty
obligations. The Colonial Ministry, owing its very existence to a
majority in the House of Representatives, was bound to follow the
trend of public opinion among the colonists. The military
commander, although he was obliged to recognize the supremacy of
the Governor within the colony, regarded him simply as an
Imperial official, and deeply resented an alleged attempt on the
part of the Colonial Ministry to communicate directly with his
subordinate officers. Moreover, he was himself entitled to
communicate with the Home Government through the Horse Guards;
and his despatches would ultimately find their way, not to the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, Sir George Grey's chief, but
to the now distinct Secretary for War, the head of another
department. Worse than all, the growing expense and danger of the
military proceedings caused the southern provinces to long for a
deliverance from the burdens of the situation at any price, and
to ask for a separation from the northern districts. To this
proposal it is perhaps needless to say that the Home Government
returned a prompt negative; and the removal of the seat of
government to Wellington in 1865 shewed that the Imperial
authorities were determined to maintain the unity of the
colony.</p>
<p>In the circumstances it is not, perhaps, surprising that the
war lingered on, enlivened only by occasional skirmishes, in
which the British troops were generally, but not always,
successful. The policy of confiscation and settlement, however,
went hand in hand with military advance; and the hostile Maoris
were gradually wearied out. It was the inevitable war of races
which, it is to be feared, can never have but one ending. In May
1865 the famous Waikato chief, William Thompson, made his
submission on behalf of the King confederacy; and operations
became practically confined to the Wanganui district, where the
fanatic Hauhaus kept up a war of plunder and outrage. In spite of
the unhappy differences between Sir George Grey and General
Cameron, operations were pushed on by the colonial forces. In
July the Weraroa Pah was captured, on the 25th December the
fanatics were again defeated on the Wairoa, and on the 6th
January, 1866, their last stronghold of Putahi fell into the
hands of Major-General Chute, who had by this time taken over the
command from General Cameron. The danger was now obviously over.
One by one the British regiments left the island; and in June
1866 Sir George Grey was able to despatch by the newly-laid
Pacific cable a message stating that the war was at an end.</p>
<p>But the colony was not to escape without another outbreak. In
1867 Sir George Bowen succeeded Sir George Grey as Governor of
the Colony; Sir George Grey unhappily retiring in circumstances
of misunderstanding and dispute which were a most unfit
termination to a long and brilliant career. In 1868 the fanatical
Hauhaus again broke out into rebellion; and, on the 7th
September, the colonial forces under Colonel McDonnell sustained
a severe repulse at Te Ruaruru, five officers and seventeen men
being killed on the spot. This was bad enough; but almost worse
was the news, which immediately followed, of the massacre by
others of the Hauhaus under Te Kooti, an escaped prisoner, of
forty Europeans and twenty friendly Maoris at Poverty Bay on the
east coast, near the site of the present town of Gisborne.
Something very like a general panic now ensued in the North
Island; and, in spite of the presence of the Governor, who moved
up at once to the scene of action, the town of Wanganui was
reduced to a state of siege. Colonel Whitmore, however, promptly
took measures to avenge the massacre at Poverty Bay, and, before
the end of the year, had inflicted two severe defeats on the
rebel forces. These successes were followed up, on the 5th
January, 1869, by the capture of the Nagata Pah, the stronghold
of the Hauhau chief Te Kooti. This time a crushing defeat was
inflicted on the rebels, who lost upwards of 130 men, while the
colonists only lost, inclusive of their Maori allies, one officer
and 10 men. Unfortunately, Te Kooti himself escaped, and
continued to do damage amongst the friendly Maoris of the east
coast But his efforts were neutralized to a great extent by
Colonel Whitmore, who in February, and again in March, captured
other important strongholds, one of his most gallant supporters
being the Wanganui chief Te Kepa, who received formal military
rank in the Colonial forces as Major Kemp. The pah captured by
Colonel Whitmore on the 3rd February was a most formidable
affair, 100 yards each way at its widest points, furnished with
barracks, magazines, ovens, palisaded roads, and all other
necessaries for a long siege. Throughout the year occasional
outbreaks occurred; and the position of affairs was considered
grave enough to warrant the retention in the colony of the 18th
regiment, which was about to embark. But on the 4th October Te
Kooti, who had again threatened the European towns, was wounded
in a skirmish; later in the same month the Native Land Court
pronounced final judgment in a celebrated land case which had
long been a source of trouble among the Maoris; in December the
Waikato chiefs sent in proposals for peace; the captured Hauhaus,
though treated with great leniency, were sent to the Otago
district to be out of harm's way; in the excitement of the gold
discoveries in Westland the colonists recouped themselves for
their long experience of trials and losses in the North Island.
But the Maoris, though conquered, were unsubdued. In spite of the
confiscations and military settlements, Sir George Bowen had to
report in 1871 that they still held eleven-sixteenths of the land
in the North Island, and that in the "King" country they yet
firmly refused to part with their territorial rights. The old
chief Wiremu Kingi was still living in sullen retirement at the
foot of Mount Egmont when Sir George Bowen visited the northern
settlements in 1869; and his example is typical of Maori
attitude. Though he is represented in the House of
Representatives and the Council, though he has rents from
European tenants and schools from European rulers, yet the Maori
is a Maori still. No union is possible between races so far apart
in civilization and blood; and it remains to be seen whether they
can peaceably dwell together in the land. In 1891, there were
upwards of 40,000 Maoris in the islands. In 1906, these had
increased to upwards of 50,000, including half-castes. No one who
has seen the Maoris, or learnt anything of their history, can for
a moment suppose that they will consent to be wiped out of
existence without a struggle. They still hold ten million acres
of their ancestral soil. The latest statistics seem to show that
their decline in numbers has been decisively checked. There may
yet be a Maori question in New Zealand.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.<br>
<br>
<small>FEDERATION IN AUSTRALIA.</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>WE</small> have seen how the accidents of history had
produced in the southern hemisphere a group of seven communities,
closely allied with each other by blood, speech, institutions,
geographical position, and (in spite of minor differences)
sympathy. We have seen also that, when Australasian institutions
assumed their present shape in 1856, there was no legal bond
between them, save the indirect bond of common allegiance to the
British crown. It had long been felt, however, that it was an
obstruction in the path of civic developement, and even a grave
political danger, that there should be no adequate machinery by
which these communities could, if need be, unite their forces
without the circuitous process of Imperial organization.</p>
<p>The first step appears to have been taken by the framers of
the Australian Constitution Act of 1850, who, adopting the
recommendations of the Privy Council Report of the previous year,
proposed to insert clauses empowering a voluntary union of any
two or more colonies in a General Assembly which should have
power to legislate upon certain specified subjects. The object of
the framers of the report was avowedly to bring about an
uniformity in colonial customs tariffs; and it may be that this
very fact rendered their scheme unpopular. It must always be
remembered that the Australasian colonies were founded when
England was a protectionist country; the mission of Cobden and
Bright came ten years too late to convert the colonists. Whether
this were the reason or not, the General Assembly clauses of the
Act of 1850 received so little support in Parliament that Lord
Grey was fain to withdraw them. And this in spite of the broad
hint given by the Government that a body representing the united
colonies would have considerable claims to be entrusted with the
administration of the coveted Land Fund.</p>
<p>But, though the Imperial Government abandoned the clauses
which provided for a common legislature, it endeavoured, with
doubtful wisdom, to create a kind of common executive for the
colonies of Australia. When the new commissions rendered
necessary by the rearrangements of 1850 were issued, it was found
that, instead of making five independent Governorships for the
then existing colonies (Queensland was as yet unborn) the
Colonial Office had created a Governor-Generalship of all
Australia (including the Swan River settlement or Western
Australia), conferring this dignity on Sir Charles FitzRoy, the
then Governor of New South Wales. Further than this, Sir Charles
FitzRoy was also created <i>Governor</i>, not only of New South
Wales, but of Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania; the actual
administrators of the three latter colonies being merely
appointed Lieutenant-Governors. And, in the Royal Instructions
which accompanied the commissions, it was expressly provided
that, whilst a Lieutenant-Governor should have full power to
communicate directly with the Colonial Office, yet he might at
any time be superseded in his duties by a personal visit of the
Governor-General to his colony. With regard to Western Australia,
it is difficult to see that the plan was ever intended to be more
than purely formal.</p>
<p>This elaborate scheme proved to be entirely nugatory. The gold
discoveries soon drew a great line of separation between the two
colonies principally affected by them and the other members of
the group; while the strong rivalry existing between New South
Wales and Victoria rendered common action almost impossible. In
spite of the friendly relations between Sir Charles FitzRoy and
Mr Latrobe, New South Wales and Victoria immediately adopted
different revenue policies&mdash;the very result which Lord
Grey's elaborate arrangements had been intended to prevent. With
the retirement of Sir Charles FitzRoy from office in 1855, the
Lieutenant-Governorships of the younger colonies were converted
into full Governorships; and, a few years later, even the titular
honour of Governor-General was abandoned.</p>
<p>In spite of the ill-success of this scheme, the new colony of
Victoria, in framing its "Responsible" Constitution, suggested
provision for a federal assembly; and various efforts were made
during the next twenty years to give some effect to a movement
the importance of which most of the best minds in the
Australasian colonies were willing to acknowledge. But, until the
year 1880, nothing beyond the meeting of occasional conferences
was accomplished; and these conferences, though they were
undoubtedly of great value in keeping alive the idea of union,
and promoting friendly feelings, had little immediate
results.</p>
<p>In the year 1880, however, the prospects seemed brighter. A
conference held at Melbourne in that year, between the three
south-eastern colonies of the continent, discussed several
important questions, and, on its adjournment to Sydney, was
joined by representatives of all the other self-governing
colonies, including New Zealand. Greatly strengthened by these
accessions, the conference agreed upon a scheme for the
introduction of an intercolonial judicial system, and, almost
unanimously, upon a policy respecting Chinese immigration, a
question then becoming very serious. Unfortunately, Western
Australia differed from the other members of the conference on
this latter topic; and the conference failed to agree upon a
measure for converting itself into a legally authorized body with
power to take common action.</p>
<p>This step was, however, shortly afterwards accomplished. The
question of French claims in the New Hebrides proved a powerful
stimulus to public opinion; and, in the year 1883, a conference
at which all the Australasian colonies (including Fiji) were
represented, adopted a scheme for the creation of a Federal
Council of Australasia, with power to legislate on specified
subjects. The list of these subjects was very narrow. Practically
speaking, it only included those matters which are neither of
Imperial nor of purely local interest&mdash;such as fisheries,
intercolonial legal process, and the influx of criminals. And the
power of the Council was almost purely legislative; it had no
means of enforcing its own measures, even though, in any
particular case, they legally superseded the law of a particular
colony. Moreover, membership of the Council was entirely
optional; and none of its measures could be enforced in a colony
not represented in it. Unhappily, neither the mother colony of
New South Wales, nor the colony of New Zealand, ever saw its way
to join the Council, which, though its existence was sanctioned
by Imperial statute, and though it effected a certain amount of
work, was never regarded as very much more than an expression of
tendency in the direction of fuller union. In this capacity it
did, undoubtedly, do good service.</p>
<p>In the year 1887 a still further step, of a somewhat different
character, was taken by the assembling in London of a conference
of Australasian delegates, which resulted in the adoption of a
scheme of Australasian Naval Defence. This scheme, which was
embodied in an Imperial statute of the following year, provided
for the maintenance during a period of ten years on the
Australian station of a force of seven men-of-war, four of which
were to be kept permanently in commission, the other three being
held in reserve in Australasian ports. The first cost of the
ships was defrayed by the Imperial Government, which also made
good any losses; while the colonies paid five per cent. annual
interest on the prime cost, and also the entire cost of
maintenance on the peace footing, provided that it did not exceed
&pound;91,000 a year. But, in the event of war, the Imperial
Government was to bear the cost of commissioning and maintaining
the reserve vessels.</p>
<p>The report of the Imperial Commissioner on Australian land
defences, published in the year 1889, gave a fresh impetus to the
federation movement. This time New South Wales took the lead,
and, while declining to join the Federal Council, offered to meet
representatives of the other colonies for the purpose of
considering a scheme of federal government. Ultimately, after
some correspondence, New South Wales so far consented to
recognize the existence of the Federal Council as to agree to
take part in a preliminary conference with the members of that
body, on condition that representatives of New Zealand were
likewise invited. The meeting held at Melbourne in February 1890
was, therefore, a meeting of the Federal Council with
representatives of the colonies which had declined to join its
ranks; and strong efforts were made (but in vain) to induce these
colonies to adopt the Council as an <i>ad interim</i> measure.
Finally, it was agreed to promote a Federal Convention of all the
colonies in the following year, for the purpose of devising a
federal constitution. Practically, therefore, the conference of
1890 resolved itself into an intellectual demonstration. In this
capacity it served its purpose. Though the attendance of the
public at its debates was thin, the proceedings were widely
published, and probably produced some effect.</p>
<p>At any rate, the projected Federal Convention duly met in
Sydney in March 1891, and, after five weeks of animated debate,
produced a draft measure. All the colonies were represented;
though New Zealand, which had already intimated that its
immediate adhesion to a federal scheme could not be expected,
only sent three delegates instead of the seven allotted to each
self-governing colony by the resolutions of 1890.</p>
<p>It is not possible here to analyse at length the provisions of
the measure drafted by the Convention of 1891. Briefly, it may be
said that the Bill contemplated a complete scheme of federal
government, legislative, executive, and judiciary. The federal
parliament was (in addition to the Governor-General) to comprise
two Houses, somewhat on the model of the Congress of the United
States; the Senate, consisting of an equal number of members
chosen by the legislature of each colony, representing the
"States' Right" principle, and the popular chamber, whose members
were to be chosen by the electors of each colony in proportion to
its population, expressing the "National" principle. All the
members of the federal parliament were to be paid for their
services, and were to be incapable of sitting in the States'
parliaments. The Governor-General of the Commonwealth, appointed
by the Crown, was to be head of the legislature and the
executive; but in both capacities he was to act as a
constitutional ruler. All communications between the individual
colonies and the Imperial Government were to pass through the
Governor-General; while the colonies were to have the right of
appointing their own Governors. This provision looks rather like
a derogation from the independence of the individual colonies;
but the States' Right principle was safeguarded by the fact that
the scope of the federal government's jurisdiction was strictly
limited by the terms of the constitution. It was not to be, as in
Canada and the old constitution of New Zealand, a supreme central
power with subordinate local governments; but a delegated and
circumscribed authority, only interfering with the liberty of its
constituents in matters expressly committed to it. Upon the most
difficult topic of all, the question of customs duties, the draft
Bill provided that the existing revenue laws should remain in
force until an uniform scheme was provided by the federal
parliament, but that the collection of duties should be
undertaken by the federal officials, who were at once to take
over, not only the customs department, but posts and telegraphs,
military and naval defences, ocean signals, and quarantine.</p>
<p>The next few years were not favourable to the prospects of
federation. Sir Henry Parkes, its most prominent champion in the
mother-colony of New South Wales, went out of office soon after
the break-up of the Convention of 1891; and the severe financial
depression of the next few years discouraged bold plans.
Nevertheless, the question was not allowed to sleep. The
Australian Natives' Association held an important conference in
1893, and advocated the direct popular election of a convention
which should draft a measure for submission to the Imperial
Parliament. Perhaps somewhat disturbed by the prospect of having
a scheme passed over their heads, the conference of Australian
Premiers held at Hobart in 1895 endorsed this resolution; and, in
the course of the year 1896, all the Australian colonies, except
Queensland, made provision by statute for the election of
delegates. In all cases save that of Western Australia, the
delegates were to be chosen by direct popular vote; in Western
Australia, the two Houses of Parliament, sitting together, were
to elect. Of the five colonies which agreed to elect delegates,
all, except South Australia, required that a minimum vote should
be cast for the acceptance of the proposal. The minimum was,
however, reached in all cases; and the delegates met at Adelaide
in March 1897.</p>
<p>The draft Bill of 1891 was accepted as a basis of discussion;
but was subjected to sharp and practical criticism. The chief
difficulties were caused by the proposal of equal representation
in the Senate, and by the proposed financial relations of the
Federal and States' Parliaments. It was felt that a Senate
containing equal numbers of representatives from all the
constituent States might well block the path of progress on which
the large majority of Australians might desire to enter. It was
also felt, that the vague provision of the Bill of 1891 on the
subject of the Customs laws was a source of danger; the more so
as the leading colony of New South Wales was known to be opposed
to the majority of the other colonies on the subject of fiscal
policy.</p>
<p>These difficulties failed to find a solution in the first
session of the Convention of 1897, which lasted for a month; and
even the second session, held in the Australian spring
(September) at Sydney, was not more successful, though much time
was usefully spent in considering various amendments of the Bill,
suggested by the colonial Parliaments. In the third session,
however, which began at Melbourne in January 1898, and lasted for
nearly two months, Sir Edward Braddon, a former Governor, and
subsequently Premier, of Tasmania, persuaded the Convention to
accept a compromise on the revenue question which, however it may
have fallen short of perfection as a permanent arrangement,
undoubtedly saved the situation in 1898. By the terms of the
draft Bill, uniform Customs duties were to be imposed throughout
the Commonwealth by the Federal Parliament within two years after
the establishment of the Commonwealth. Until that time, the
Commonwealth Executive was to collect the duties in each State
under the laws in existence in that State, and, after deducting
the expenses of collection, and a proportionate amount,
calculated on the basis of population, of the general expenses of
the Commonwealth, to return the balance to the State in which it
was collected. And, even after the establishment of uniform
duties, the Commonwealth was still, for five years, and further
until the Federal Parliament should otherwise provide, to
continue the system of returning the balance collected in each
State. But, except in the case of Western Australia, which was to
be allowed, for five years, to protect herself against the
products of the other States by border duties, all internal
Customs duties were to be absolutely prohibited.</p>
<p>The danger about these arrangements was, in the eyes of the
larger colonies, that an undue proportion of the Commonwealth
expenditure might fall upon the quota of Customs duties
contributed by them; and Sir Edward Braddon proposed to meet this
difficulty by limiting the expenditure of the Commonwealth out of
the Customs revenue to one fourth of its net amount. This
proposal was, with some modification, accepted by the session
which commenced in Melbourne in January 1898, and lasted for
nearly two months. The difficulty about the composition of the
Senate was also overcome by a careful provision against
"deadlocks" of the two Houses; and the Federation Bill was
finally adopted by the Convention on 16th March 1898.</p>
<p>But the difficulties in the way of federation were by no means
ended with the adoption of the Bill by the Convention. The
colonies had only consented to elect representatives on the
condition that any scheme proposed should be submitted to the
parliamentary electors in each colony for final approval; and,
unfortunately, when the Referendum was held, in June, 1898, New
South Wales, though polling a majority in favour of the measure,
did not register the required minimum of votes for its
acceptance, while Western Australia abstained altogether from
voting. As Queensland had not been represented at the Convention,
the result was that only three colonies&mdash;Victoria, South
Australia, and Tasmania&mdash;were legally committed to the
measure. Though, by the terms of the Bill, these three colonies
might have proceeded to address the Imperial Government to enact
it, it was felt impossible to go further with such a division of
opinion; and success still seemed to be far off.</p>
<p>With a change of Government in New South Wales, however,
prospects began to improve; and, after the mother-colony had
passed, in its own Parliament, an Act approving of the Federal
Bill with some important amendments, a conference of the Premiers
of all six colonies met at Melbourne in January, 1899, with a
view of arriving at a compromise. Ultimately, the desired
unanimity was obtained by modifications limiting the operation of
the "Braddon clause" to ten years (or until such further time as
the Federal Parliament should see fit to leave it unaltered),*
and providing that the federal capital should be fixed in New
South Wales, but not within one hundred miles of Sydney.</p>
<p class="foot">[* After much discussion, the "Braddon clause"
has recently (1910) been superseded by a Federal Act which
provides for the payment to the States, during the next ten
years, of an annual sum equal to twenty-five shillings a head of
their populations.]</p>
<p>With these, and minor amendments, the Federal Bill was for the
second time submitted to the electors of the colonies; and, on
this occasion, with success. All the colonies, with the exception
of Western Australia, accepted the measure by the requisite
majorities; while Western Australia merely postponed her
Referendum, which, after the Imperial Parliament had enacted the
Bill, was speedily held, and resulted in a decisive victory for
federation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in order that Australian views might be well
considered by the Imperial Parliament in discussing the measure,
a delegation from the concurring colonies accompanied the Bill to
England, and held discussions with Mr Chamberlain, who, as
Secretary of State for the Colonies, was to introduce it into the
Imperial Parliament, and with the Law Officers of the Crown. New
Zealand, which, though having no immediate intention of entering
the Commonwealth, desired to obtain the right of entering as an
"Original State" in the future, and Western Australia, which
wished to secure certain alterations in the measure, also made
representations in England; but these representations were not
successful. In the Imperial Parliament, the only real point of
difficulty was upon the clause of the Bill which withdrew
entirely from the Privy Council all appeals in cases affecting
the Federal Constitution or the Constitutions of the States,
unless outside interests were involved, and gave the Federal
Parliament power to prohibit by legislation other classes of
appeals. For various causes, appeals to the Privy Council were
unpopular in Australia; but there was some reason to suppose that
this clause had been inserted, at the end of the Convention of
1897-8, without full consideration. It was, however, a delicate
matter for the Imperial Government to make any alteration in a
measure which had been so fully debated in Australia; while
another Referendum in the colonies would certainly have
occasioned delay and expense, and might have imperilled the whole
scheme. On the other hand, the Imperial Parliament could hardly
be expected to pass a measure which, in its opinion, seriously
and unwisely diminished the prerogative of the Crown.</p>
<p>Both sides were, therefore, inclined to a compromise; and,
ultimately, a modification of the clause, not of a particularly
satisfactory character, was agreed to; and the Bill, as thus
amended, obtained the force of law by means of a short covering
Act of the Imperial Parliament, which received the Royal Assent
on 9th July, 1900. This Act, besides giving formal validity to
the terms of the Federal Bill, and repealing inconsistent
Imperial statutes, empowered Her Majesty, at any time within one
year from its passing, to proclaim the creation of the Federal
Commonwealth, and to incorporate into it, as "Original States",
such of the colonies as should by that time have accepted its
provisions. This power was duly exercised in September 1900; and
the Commonwealth of Australia was born on New Year's Day 1901,
Western Australia having, as has been said, given in her formal
adhesion as an "Original State" prior to the issue of the Royal
Proclamation. The first Parliament of the Commonwealth was opened
by H.R.H. the Duke of Federal Cornwall, afterwards Prince of
Wales and now King George V, on 31st May, 1901; he having been
deputed to that office by King Edward VII, who, on the death of
Queen Victoria in January 1901, had become King of Great Britain
and Ireland, and of the British Dominions beyond the narrow seas.
In addition to its duties as Federal authority, the Commonwealth
Government was entrusted, in the year 1906, with the direct
administration of British New Guinea, or Papua, and, in the year
1911, with that of the huge Northern Territory, formerly part of
South Australia. It should be noted, however, that there is this
difference between the position of the Northern Territory and
that of British New Guinea, that the former is, while the latter
is not, part of the Commonwealth itself.</p>
<p>Thus the legal edifice of the Commonwealth had been, after so
many efforts, successfully reared; but it had been felt, all
along, that its government would hardly become a reality to the
Australian citizen, until it was housed in a visible and suitable
form on Australian soil. Naturally also, as in the case of
American federation, it had been felt that, to ensure complete
freedom from local influence, it must not be permanently lodged
in any of the splendid capital cities already existing in
Australia, but in some spot where it would be without a rival. As
we have seen, one of the provisions of the Commonwealth Act had
empowered the new Federal Parliament to fix the seat of
government within the State of New South Wales, at a distance of
not less than one hundred miles from the mother-city of Sydney.
It was also provided, by the same clause, that to the federal
capital should be annexed not less than one hundred square miles
of territory belonging absolutely to the Commonwealth (i.e. not
under State control); and that any Crown lands which might be
required for that purpose should be granted, without payment, to
the Commonwealth. In the meanwhile, the Federal Parliament was to
sit at Melbourne, the most central of the States' capitals.</p>
<p>One of the first cares of the new government was to select the
necessary site; and, needless to say, it was not without numerous
suggestions. After much public discussion, the favourite
candidates for the honour proved to be the three towns of Albury,
Dalgety, and Tumut. Albury was obviously suggested by the fact
that it is almost on the boundary between New South Wales and
Victoria; being (as the traveller knows to his cost) the point at
which the broad-gauge Victorian line changes to the narrow gauge
of the New South Wales system. Dalgety is a small town in the
great squatting district which lies in the extreme south-east of
New South Wales, a good deal nearer to the coast than Albury, and
not very far from the Gippsland border of Victoria. Tumut is
likewise a small town, but a good deal further north, and,
consequently, considerably further from the Victorian border,
than either Albury or Dalgety, and, for all practical purposes,
much further from the coast than either. But it had the
substantial advantages of being situated on a branch of the great
Murrumbidgee river, and of being connected with the main
continental railway between Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
<p>The difficult question of choice came before the Federal
Parliament in the year 1903; and, as might have been expected,
serious differences of opinion soon shewed themselves. After
failing to secure a conference between the two Houses, the
Government succeeded in carrying through the House of
Representatives a Bill in favour of the choice of Tumut; but the
Senate, after reading the Bill a second time, accepted an
amendment in favour of a fourth site, Bombala, which the House of
Representatives refused to pass. In the following year another
Bill was brought forward; and the Houses ultimately agreed on a
site to be fixed within seventeen miles of Dalgety. But, partly
with a view of securing an adequate water-supply (always a vital
question in Australian politics), and also direct access to the
sea, the Seat of Government Act, 1904, provided that the
territory to be annexed to the federal capital should be nine
hundred square miles, instead of the minimum of one hundred
required by the Commonwealth Act.</p>
<p>This proposal, not unnaturally, roused a good deal of
opposition in New South Wales, which complained that the proposal
of the Federal Parliament contemplated the creation, at the
expense of that State, not merely of a federal area of a moderate
size, sufficient to ensure the dignity and independence of the
federal capital, but of a new federal State, small, indeed,
compared with the huge areas of the Australian colonies, but as
large as an average English county. The difficulties of
water-supply and access to the sea the Government of New South
Wales proposed to meet by special provisions for guarding the
catchment areas outside the federal territory, and by
facilitating the construction of a federal railway from the
federal capital to the coast. But it flatly declined to grant
anything like nine hundred square miles of its territory; and in
this resolution it was confirmed by resolutions of both Houses of
the New South Wales Parliament.</p>
<p>Thus matters appeared to have come to a deadlock: and for four
years an apparently interminable correspondence passed between
the respective Governments of the Commonwealth and New South
Wales. Ultimately, however, in the year 1908, the parties arrived
at an agreement which conceded the main points of the
Commonwealth's demands; with the important addition, that any
private lands required for the purposes of the scheme should be
paid for at a rate not exceeding their value as it stood at the
adoption of the scheme. This was a provision very necessary for
the protection of the Commonwealth; for, naturally, the selection
of the federal site would send up the speculative value of the
land in its neighbourhood 'by leaps and bounds'. Accordingly,
with considerable astuteness, the Federal Government introduced
the new Bill into its Parliament with the provision that Dalgety
should remain the choice; but, in the course of debate, this was
suddenly altered to the totally new selection of the
Yass-Canberra district, and the maximum value date was promptly
fixed accordingly.</p>
<p>Further important questions of detail had to be discussed with
the Government of New South Wales; but these were happily
settled, and a formal agreement was signed between the Federal
Premier and the Premier of New South Wales on 18th October, 1909,
which was ratified in the following December by the two
Parliaments concerned. In addition to its nine hundred square
miles of territory in the Yass-Canberra district, which is fifty
miles north of Dalgety and about seventy miles in a direct line
from the coast, the Commonwealth secures the right to run a
federal railway from the capital to Port Jervis (about one
hundred and twenty miles distant), together with a site for a
federal harbour and defences, the right to use the waters of the
Snowy River for generation of electricity, and paramount
water-rights over the catchment areas of certain neighbouring
rivers. The formal cession of territory duly took place in
December 1910, to take effect as from the beginning of 1911; but,
in the meanwhile, careful arrangements had been made by a federal
statute, the Seat of Government (Administration) Act, 1910, for
the vesting of complete and direct control over the
newly-acquired area in the Federal Government.</p>
<p>Thus it will be seen that the Federal Government exercises two
distinct kinds of authority. One is direct, over the Northern
Territory, the newly acquired federal site, and British New
Guinea, which last is not even part of the territory of the
Commonwealth. In these areas, the Federal Government shares its
authority only with the rarely-exercised supreme control of the
Imperial Parliament. The other kind of authority which it
exercises is federal, over the territories of the various States
forming the Commonwealth. Here the functions of the Federal
Government are strictly prescribed and limited by the
Commonwealth Act; and the control over these territories is
shared by the Governments of the respective States, both Federal
and States' Governments being subject to the supreme but
rarely-exercised powers of the Imperial Parliament. The central
and connecting point is the Crown, of which the fixed heads of
the Executive, the Governor-General of the Commonwealth and the
Governors of the States, as well as the Responsible Ministers of
both the Federal and the States' Governments, are the
representatives,* and in whose name, alike in Australia and all
other parts of the British Empire, the daily government is
carried on.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The proposal that the States should have the
right to elect their own Governors disappeared from the
Commonwealth Bill before it was despatched to England.]</p>
<p>At the present time, the Federal Government is engaged in the
fascinating, if difficult task, of bringing into existence a
federal capital which shall be a model for the world. The
greatest care is being taken to make the result worthy of the
unique occasion. Not since the foundation of Washington, a
hundred years ago, has such an opportunity arisen; and the world
has learnt much in a hundred years. The new federal acquisition
has already been carefully surveyed, a scheme for the
organization of the administrative and executive services
prepared, the site of the actual city selected, and plans for its
erection invited from the whole world. The world will look
forward with confidence to the success of the enterprise now
being inaugurated under the Southern Cross, and will not be
disappointed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.<br>
<br>
<small>PRESENT DAY TOPICS.</small></h3>
<br>
<p><small>CONNECTED</small> with the subject of federation, both
historically and necessarily, is the question of British
influence in the Pacific generally. Although Britain has
succeeded in acquiring the two largest of the Pacific islands,
and although the possessors of Australia and New Zealand must
always occupy a predominant position in Pacific affairs, there
are yet many other prizes too tempting to be overlooked. In the
west, Germany and France watch with care the course of events in
New Guinea and the New Hebrides; while the French penal
settlement of New Caledonia is a standing grievance to the
colonists who have succeeded in closing their ports to British
convicts. Further east, though England has acquired the important
colony of Fiji, the United States of America, as well as European
nations, have no mind to permit further accessions to the British
Empire; and the recent acquisition of Samoa by Germany has
definitely introduced international questions. The British
Governor of Fiji is High Commissioner for the Western Pacific;
and the title itself appears to other nations to be a standing
menace.</p>
<p>The troubles in connection with the Fijian group of islands,
which culminated in the cession of Fiji to the British Crown in
the year 1874, raised by natural association the question of the
more western island of New Guinea, or, as it had formerly been
called, Papua. It appeared that the claims of the Dutch, who had
undoubtedly been intimately connected with the island since the
beginning of the seventeenth century, were confined to a somewhat
uncertain portion of New Guinea towards the west; the eastern
part being admittedly a sort of No-man's land. Its shores had
been continually visited for survey purposes during the last
century by British ships; but no assertion of sovereignty over
the numerous aboriginal tribes had been made by the British
Government. On the occasion of the organization of Fiji, strong
representations as to the desirability of taking a similar course
with regard to eastern New Guinea were made to the Secretary of
State (Lord Carnarvon); but the Minister, after consulting the
various Australasian governments, and finding them by no means
unanimous, refused to take the step unless the colonies desiring
it would undertake to contribute towards the expense likely to be
incurred. The colonies were not prepared to assume this
responsibility; and the Imperial Government therefore contented
itself, on the organization of the Fijian government, with
providing for the exercise of protective jurisdiction by the
Governor of that colony in Pacific waters not claimed by any
European power. Thus the matter rested, until, at the close of
the year 1877, the reported discovery of gold in New Guinea again
brought the question prominently forward. The news immediately
attracted numbers of Australian gold-diggers, and, following in
their wake, crowds of less reputable characters, who not only
attempted to settle, or rather to lodge, in New Guinea itself,
but took irregular possession of more than one of the numerous
islands lying between Australia and New Guinea in Torres Strait,
within the coast line of Queensland. Here they caused
considerable trouble; and the Queensland Government, after acting
as police authority in the islands in question for some little
time without legal warrant, endeavoured to make its position
constitutional with regard to them. In this it was successful.
The British Admiralty, on the report of Commander Heath,
certified that there was no known claim to the islands in
question by any foreign Power, and that there appeared no serious
objection to the alteration of the Queensland coast boundaries
for the purpose of including them. Almost at the same time, Sir
Arthur Gordon, then High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, at
the request of the Queensland Government, appointed the Resident
Magistrate of Thursday Island (a Queensland possession) to be a
deputy commissioner for the purpose of protecting the aborigines
in Murray and Darnley Islands. Also at the request of the
Queensland Government, the Admiralty stationed a war-ship at Port
Moresby in New Guinea. But the Imperial Government, though
pressed by representative bodies of various kinds connected with
the colonies, still firmly declined to extend the principle of
absorption by annexing any part of New Guinea itself to the
Empire.</p>
<p>The pressure, however, became very great. Companies were
formed in Australia for the development of New Guinea. The
Queensland Government's agent at Port Moresby began to assume
more and more the character of an administrator of the country
near the Port. Though the Home Government actually forbade a
proposed visit to the scene of events by the acting High
Commissioner during his chief's absence, this step was more than
counterbalanced by the fact that the High Commissioner himself,
Sir Arthur Gordon, definitely recommended annexation in November,
1878. Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, notwithstanding, adhered to the
decision arrived at by his predecessor (Lord Carnarvon) in
1875</p>
<p>In February of the year 1883, the matter assumed a new phase
by the definite offer of the Queensland Government, cabled by Sir
Thomas M<sup>c</sup>Ilwraith, to bear the expense of the
administration of New Guinea, if the Imperial authorities would
sanction its annexation. The reasons urged by Queensland were,
the increasing traffic through Torres Strait, the rapid
development of coast industries, such as beche-de-mer and pearl
fishing, the danger of the escape of convicts from New Caledonia,
and the inadequacy of the High Commissionership.</p>
<p>The proposal of Queensland was being discussed by the Colonial
Office in somewhat leisurely fashion, when the news reached
Australia that a German association had been formed for the
settlement of New Guinea. The idea was not new. Three months
before Sir Thomas Mclwraith's message was sent, the British
Government had been warned of the scheme; but Lord Granville
(Foreign Secretary) declined to believe in the existence of the
plan, at least so far as the German Government was concerned. The
colonists held a different view; and, on the 4th April, 1883, the
Queensland Government formally took possession of New Guinea in
the name of Her Majesty. In this step they had the hearty
concurrence of at least three of the Australian governments; and
Lord Derby, who had been considerably startled by the report of
the move, which reached him through an indirect channel, speedily
received messages from the neighbouring colonies which convinced
him of the existence of a strong Australian feeling on the
subject.</p>
<p>Still Lord Derby declined to accede to the wishes of the
colonists; and, in July, 1883, he forwarded to the Governor of
Queensland a despatch in which he formally repudiated the
annexation, and refused, on behalf of the British Government, to
do more than increase the number of deputy commissioners in the
coveted territory, at the expense of the Queensland
Government.</p>
<p>But the colonists did not intend to give way. Although the
German Government professed entire indifference to the subject of
colonization, the news that France contemplated the extension of
her penal settlements in the Pacific served to heighten the
excitement; and on the 31st August, 1883, Lord Granville was
induced to present to the French Government a formal protest
against the dangers of the situation. The immediate fear was,
that France would seize upon the New Hebrides group, lying
between Fiji and New Caledonia; and, although the agreement
entered into between the French and British Governments in 1878,
for the preservation of the independence of this group, was
reported to be still in force, the rumour of French war-ships in
the neighbourhood roused colonial feeling to its highest pitch. A
federal convention was (as we have seen) summoned to meet at the
close of the year 1883; and the Government of New Zealand went so
far as to submit a Bill to facilitate confederation with, or
annexation of, the islands of the Pacific. When the convention
met, it manifested the strongest and most unanimous feeling in
favour of the annexation of New Guinea, the prevention of further
French settlements in the Pacific, and the undesirability of
allowing the French <i>r&eacute;cidiviste</i> policy to be
carried out.</p>
<p>Ultimately this feeling was successful. The attitude of the
German Government towards New Guinea not proving so entirely
indifferent as was at first alleged, an agreement was arrived at
for a partition. In April, 1886, Sir Edward Malet and Count
Herbert Bismarck signed at Berlin a declaration which marked out
the limits of mutual acquisition in the Western Pacific. The
German possession of Kaiser Wilhelm's Land, on the north-east
coast of New Guinea, is definitely recognized; and an imaginary
line, starting from its south-eastern corner, travels due east to
the Solomon Islands, which it bisects, then north-east to the
Marshall group, and finally due north to an indefinite point in
the ocean. All to the west and north of this line is secured from
British influence; Germany may not acquire any possession or
protectorate to the south or east. Samoa, Tonga, and one or two
other places, already provided for by other treaties, were
excluded from the Declaration.</p>
<p>The way being thus prepared, and the Queensland Government
definitely undertaking to contribute for fifteen years an annual
sum not exceeding &pound;15,000 towards the expenses of the new
possession, British New Guinea was, in June 1888, in pursuance of
a new Act of Parliament * passed in 1887, definitely created a
possession of the British Crown. The Government was to consist of
an Administrator, a Judge, and a Secretary to the Government,
with Executive and Legislative Councils, after the usual fashion
of a Crown colony in the first stage. At the same time Dr (now
Sir William) Macgregor was appointed first Administrator. Shortly
before this date, the New Hebrides question had been temporarily
settled by the mutual withdrawal, on the part of both England and
France, of all territorial claims; protection to life and
property being secured by a Joint Naval Commission of the two
countries under the terms of a Note signed at Paris in January
1888, the proposed terms of which had been previously approved by
the Australasian Conference of 1887. At the same time, the
English Government withdrew its objections to the formal
annexation by France of the island of Raiatea, to the leeward of
Tahiti, which had virtually been a French possession for six
years, but had been formally recognized as independent by a
Declaration of the year 1847. Unfortunately, the efforts of the
British Government to prohibit the supply of ammunition and
alcohol to the natives of the independent groups were rendered
largely ineffectual by the refusal in the year 1885 of the
American Government to concur in an agreement for the purpose. In
the year 1906, however, the administration of the New Hebrides
was re-organized under an Anglo-French convention, which secures
better control in the interests of settlers and natives. As was
mentioned in the preceding chapter, the direct administration of
British New Guinea (now known as "Papua") has recently been
confided to the Commonwealth Government.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The British Settlements Act 1887, which
empowered Her Majesty to organize a government for any British
possession acquired otherwise than by cession or conquest, and
not already within the jurisdiction of the <i>legislature</i> of
any British possession. For judicial purposes New Guinea was part
of Queensland.]</p>
<p>Allusion has been made to the treaties affecting Samoa and
Tonga; and the offer of New Zealand to undertake the
administration of the former group renders it necessary to
describe very briefly the history of the Samoan question.</p>
<p>On the 17th January, 1878, the United States of America
entered into a treaty with the King of Samoa, by which the
Republic obtained certain trading privileges, together with a
limited amount of jurisdiction over its own subjects resident in
the islands. In August of the following year, the States secured
the further special privilege of using the harbour of Pango Pango
for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in January 1879, the German Government had obtained
a treaty somewhat similar to the American treaty of 1878, but
containing also an important clause confirming previous land
purchases by Germans in the islands. Seven months later, in
August 1879, Great Britain formally entered upon the scene with a
treaty securing liberty of commerce and jurisdiction, and the
right to acquire a coaling station beyond the limits of the
capital, Apia. Almost immediately afterwards, the consuls of the
three Treaty Powers, Germany, Great Britain, and the United
States, entered into an arrangement for the municipal government
of the town of Apia by a Board consisting of themselves. This
arrangement, which was only accepted after considerable
hesitation by the Samoans, was at first for a period of four
years; and its existence was justified by the necessity of
securing at least a limited area in which commercial transactions
could be carried on without disturbance by the native feuds
which, unfortunately, seemed to be constantly occurring. In
September, 1883, it was renewed indefinitely. But a further
treaty, drawn up by the consuls, with the object of creating an
Executive Council for the affairs of the Samoan government, was
disavowed by the Home authorities, on the ground that its
provisions would reduce Samoan independence to a shadow.</p>
<p>These arrangements at first produced an appearance of
tranquillity; but, in the year 1885, disturbances broke out
again. The truth seems to have been, that the islands were
plagued by the presence of independent adventurers of European
birth who, under cover of acting as advisers to the native
chiefs, fomented internal dissensions, to which the Samoans have
long been disposed; and that these feuds, complicated by disputes
concerning land ownership, and by commercial rivalry, kept the
islands in a constant condition of civil war.</p>
<p>In the troubles of 1885 the German consul at Apia took a
prominent part; and, though it is impossible to be sure of the
rights of the matter, the reports being totally inconsistent with
one another, it seems clear that his action led the
representatives of the other Powers to believe that the Germans
meditated annexation. To check this plan, if it really existed,
the United States consul in April 1886 announced an American
protectorate over the Samoan group, a step which was promptly
repudiated by his Government. The situation was complicated by
the presence of war-ships belonging to the various Powers, and by
the ever-present feuds of the natives. It was clear that
something decisive had to be done.</p>
<p>In the spring of the year 1886, the Governments of the three
Treaty Powers agreed to hold a local enquiry by specially
appointed Commissioners, with the object of coming to some
arrangement concerning the future of the Samoan group. The
consuls were recalled, in order to leave the field clear; and in
the autumn the Commissioners met. Unfortunately, it soon appeared
that they would not agree. Germany was strongly in favour of the
administration of Samoa by a single European power, which,
presumably, meant Germany herself. Great Britain and the United
States declined to allow the extinction of Samoan independence.
The negotiations of the Commissioners came to an end in 1887; but
not before a new element of danger had manifested itself in the
appearance of an European envoy from the native Court of Hawaii,
with a mission to establish a native "Polynesian Empire". At the
beginning of the following year, the Treaty Powers withdrew from
the municipal scheme of 1879.</p>
<p>In October, 1888, civil war again broke out in the islands; a
new claimant to the throne threatening to prove a formidable
rival to the existing combatants. In January, 1889, this new
aspirant (Mataafa) came into collision with the German
representative; and the encounter was followed by a state of
affairs which was, practically, war between Germany and Mataafa's
followers. As it was quite evident that the other Powers would
not allow Germany to effect a military conquest of the islands,
Prince Bismarck, in February 1889, proposed the holding of a
conference at Berlin upon Samoan affairs; and the proposal was
ultimately accepted by Great Britain and the United States, on
the condition that hostilities were at once suspended.</p>
<p>The conference was duly held; and, on the 14th June, 1889, the
Powers agreed to an Act regulating the affairs of Samoa. The
chief terms of the Treaty were, the establishment of a Supreme
Court, and a revival of the municipal council at Apia. But the
council was not, as before, to consist of consular
representatives, but of persons elected by the residents, consuls
being expressly excluded. Moreover, the council was to be
presided over by a President chosen with the consent of the
Treaty Powers, or, failing their agreement, by some independent
authority. At the head of the Supreme Court, which was to have
exclusive jurisdiction over land questions in which Europeans
were interested, as well as in suits between persons of different
nationalities and crimes committed by natives against foreigners,
was to be a Chief Justice, also nominated by the Treaty Powers,
or, failing their agreement, by the King of Sweden. For small
cases there was to be a magistrate appointed by the municipal
council. Perhaps most important of all, the Treaty provided that
purchases of land by foreigners from natives should only be
permitted under strict regulations, and that there should be an
investigation of pending claims.</p>
<p>Under these arrangements, the affairs of Samoa went on, not
without difficulty, till 1898, when, on the death of Malietoa,
the Chief chosen by the Powers, the partisans of Mataafa again
made trouble, and bloodshed ensued. Ultimately, after an
examination of affairs by Commissioners of the Powers, the Berlin
Act was revoked, and the British withdrew from Samoa, receiving
compensation from Germany in Tonga and elsewhere. Mataafa died in
February of the present year (1912).</p>
<p>British relations with Tonga were, until 1899, regulated by
Treaty signed on the 29th November, 1879, modified by an amending
Treaty of the 2nd June, 1891. By these documents Great Britain
acquired the rights of the "most favoured nation" in Tonga; and
the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific was empowered to
try offences committed against British Law by British subjects in
Tonga, as well as all civil suits brought against British
subjects there. But, when the British Government ceded Samoa, by
the treaty of 1899, it received compensation by the withdrawal of
all German claims in Tonga, which is now exclusively under the
protection of the British Empire. Germany at the same time ceded
to Great Britain a further part of the Solomon Islands, including
the Howe group. The career of the "Honourable and Reverend"
Shirley Baker, officially recorded in the Blue Books, and more
popularly described in <i>The Diversions of a Prime Minister</i>;
affords as good an illustration as could be desired of the state
of politics in Tonga, and, probably, in the other independent
Pacific islands.</p>
<p>On the whole, the Pacific question can hardly be considered to
be in a satisfactory state. That the eyes of European powers are
turned longingly towards the fair islands of the archipelago, is
abundantly clear. That the condition of the native races in the
islands is such as to afford constantly recurring pretexts for
interference, almost every mail brings testimony. To the present
date, the diplomatic arrangements, cautiously superficial and
hypocritically maintaining a show of indifference, are utterly
inadequate to decide in advance the complicated possibilities of
a general scramble. Fortunately, the local jealousies of the
natives themselves render it most improbable that anything like a
wide-spread league of the coloured races will provoke a general
war against the native inhabitants of the Pacific islands. But
this very fact only renders the more probable a long series of
irritating difficulties, each in itself of little importance, but
each capable, under favourable circumstances, of provoking a
breach between rival colonizing Powers.</p>
<p>With the Pacific question the Australasian colonies are
especially concerned, not merely by their geographical position,
but by the thorny subject Polynesian Labour. And this again links
it with the equally important question of Northern Separation in
Queensland, about which it would be very desirable to know
something definite, but as to which it is, unhappily, almost
impossible to obtain trustworthy information. However, it appears
obvious that the vast territory of Queensland, with its seat of
government at the extreme south-eastern corner, cannot be
properly administered by a single office. This the moderate men
of all parties seem inclined to admit. Already a foreshadowing of
separation appears in the divisions into which, for judicial,
mining, and some other purposes, the State is distributed; and
such divisions will recall similar incidents in the history of
New South Wales. Equally clear are the social and economic
differences between the tradesmen and artisans of Brisbane and
the south, the great squatters of the Darling Downs and the
inland plains, the gold-miners of the townships on the eastern
cordillera, and the new industries of the tropical north, the
sugar and cotton planters, the traders in pearls and other
products of the Gulf of Carpentaria. But, unfortunately, these
interests do not seem to coincide with any definite geographical
areas, and, in consequence, instead of a projected Northern
Separation only, we hear now of Central and Northern Separation;
and the distribution of state railways, the direction of state
roads, and the alienation of state lands, are all coloured by the
possibilities of future subdivision. One reason for the increased
complexity of the question appears to be the rapid development of
the extreme north, the districts watered by the Flinders, Albert,
and Leichhardt, rivers. A few years ago, it was assumed that
Northern Queensland meant a strip of territory behind the
north-east coast, of which Rockhampton, Mackay, Wickham, and
Townsville were the ports. Now, with the annexation of British
New Guinea and the development of the Gulf trade, this Northern
District has, in a sense, become central; and the question has
assumed a new aspect. One thing it is interesting to
notice&mdash;that Separation is not opposed to Federation. In
fact, the late Mr Macrossan, who, till his death in 1891, was the
great representative of Northern Separation, was likewise one of
the most ardent advocates of Federation. But the Polynesian
labour topic divides the Northern District against itself; for
the sugar and tobacco planters, a rapidly increasing interest,
cannot, by their own showing, work their plantations without
kanaka labour, and they are indisposed to agree to separation
without a guarantee against prohibition. The white men of the
labouring classes, on the other hand, who hate the coloured
labourers, and are bent on driving out the kanaka and the
Chinese, at one time succeeded in actually prohibiting the
landing of the former by an Act of 1890. The results of this Act
were, however, so disastrous to the sugar industry, that its very
author started a successful campaign for its repeal, which took
effect in 1892. Very shortly after coming into existence,
however, viz. in 1901, the Federal Parliament passed an Act which
provided for the total exclusion of Polynesian labourers from
Queensland by the end of the year 1906. There have, of course,
been ugly revelations in connection with the supply of Polynesian
labourers; and the troubles at Apia and other places, which have
so complicated the Pacific question, have generally been provoked
by the kidnapping tendencies of the merchants engaged in the
labour traffic. It is equally true that the general sentiment of
the Australasian colonies is powerfully against the admission of
coloured races; as witness the almost universal legislation
restricting the immigration of Chinese. On the other hand, the
danger of a preponderance of the coloured races hardly seems
imminent. The last published official statistics of Queensland
showed, out of a total population of upwards of half a million
persons, only a little over twenty thousand, or just four per
cent., of Oriental or Polynesian origin; and, in all probability,
the figures of the census of 1911, when analysed, will show an
even greater preponderance of the white races.</p>
<p>But, of even greater importance for the British reader than
the condition of the coloured labourer in Australasia, is the
condition of the labouring classes of his own speech and blood.
For, unlike an empire won by conquest, a colony is an experiment
in nation-building; and the great colonies of Australia are
experiments on a scale hardly second to those of the United
States of America and the vast Dominion of Canada. What have they
to teach us about those vital problems which are concerned with
the relations of capital and labour, and which touch so
profoundly the well-being of the great majority of a modern
community, and the peace and good order of the nation?</p>
<p>As we have seen, in our study of the early history of
Australia, one of the greatest concerns of the administrators of
those days was for a steady and abundant flow of suitable
immigrants. The powerful magnet of the gold discoveries relieved
them of all present anxiety as to the sufficiency of the supply,
and laid the foundations of a strong and virile race. Allusion
has already been made to the rapidity with which the population
increased during the fifties of the last century; and the figures
show that the influx proceeded steadily during the sixties and
seventies, while, in the eighties, the average annual increase by
immigration nearly reached the figure 25,000, amounting in the
ten years 1880-90 to 244,284 persons, the great majority of whom
were of British blood.</p>
<p>Before 1890, various schemes for the encouragement of
immigration had been in operation; but they had gradually
dwindled in attractiveness as the need for their maintenance
disappeared, and, in the last decade of the nineteenth century,
they practically ceased to exist. Unfortunately, also, perhaps
owing to the indirect influence of those neo-Malthusian doctrines
which, when the history of that century comes to be impartially
written, will probably be condemned as the deadliest blow at
civilisation ever inflicted by ignorant academic pedantry, there
grew up in Australia a decided hostility to immigration of all
kinds. No doubt this hostility was more particularly directed
against the immigration of Orientals, whose ideals and practices
rendered assimilation with Australians difficult, if not
impossible. But there can be little doubt that it extended also
to immigrants of European blood and speech; and that (in many
respects) admirable institution, the Australian Natives'
Association, cannot be held entirely blameless for a policy which
threatened to starve the growth of prosperity in the midst of
countless opportunities of development. The result may be read at
a glance in the official figures, which show that, in the
nineties, immigration into Australia fell, from an annual average
of nearly 25,000, to less than 1,500, and that, in the five years
1896-1900, the total immigration to Australia was actually less
than the emigration, by 645 persons. No doubt this period
coincided with a severe financial depression; but it did not
occur, apparently, to Australian statesmen to consider which was
the cause and which the effect. Their chief remedy for the
wide-spread distress was to raise the Customs duties on imports;
but, as the duties went up, the population went down, and, though
the artificial inflation of prices maintained, for some time, a
hollow prosperity in the great cities, it caused real suffering
to the majority of the population, and fell severely upon the
class which is the real backbone of Australia, the "selector" or
agriculturalist.</p>
<p>Unhappily, the formation of the Commonwealth did not bring an
immediate change of ideas. One of the most marked and speedy
political results of that change was the growth in power of the
Parliamentary representatives of the manual labourers; and
"Labour" Governments (the first in 1904) have thrice held the
helm of State. These representatives were by no means free from
the economic heresies which their predecessors had inherited from
the first half of the nineteenth century; and the sentiment of
"Australia for the Australians" was reflected in early Federal
legislation. Specially entrusted by the Commonwealth Act with
this vital subject, the Federal Parliament, in 1901, passed the
Immigration Restriction Act, which severely discouraged the
influx of immigrants. But wiser counsels soon prevailed; and an
amending Act of 1905 modified many of the illiberal features of
the legislation of 1901.</p>
<p>The restrictive policy of the Commonwealth is now (apart from
the very necessary exclusion of criminals and undesirables)
practically confined to two classes of immigrant, viz. persons of
alien blood, and persons, known as "contract labourers", coming
out to fulfil definite engagements contracted in their native
countries. The former are liable to be subjected to the "language
test", i.e. to be required to write out not less than fifty words
of a language prescribed by Regulation, and dictated by the
officer administering the Acts. The latter will not be admitted
unless their contracts have received the approval of a Minister
of State, which will not be given if the contract has been made
with a view of influencing an industrial dispute, or is regarded
as an attempt to take advantage of the immigrant's ignorance of
local industrial conditions. In both these cases, the
justification of the policy must depend largely on the way in
which it is applied; and it is satisfactory to know that, during
the years 1903-10, only 747 persons were refused admission on
either of the above grounds, while over half a million immigrants
were admitted. As a matter of fact, the "language test" is not,
and never has been, applied to persons of European race. Of these
half-million of immigrants, considerably more than four-fifths
were British; and it is matter for congratulation that the annual
rate of British immigration to Australia is steadily mounting. It
must by no means be supposed, moreover, that the new attitude
towards immigration has been manifested solely in relaxing
restrictions. Several of the States offer substantial
inducements, in the way of assisted passages and land grants, to
intending settlers of a suitable type; and, in the year 1910, the
Commonwealth Government definitely entered upon the task of
making known the attractions of Australia as a field of
colonization.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the organized efforts of the labouring
classes to improve their own economic and social position have
been conspicuous in the Australasian colonies. From the middle of
the nineteenth century onwards, there was a rapid formation of
Trade Unions, whose efforts speedily resulted in the definite
establishment of an "Eight Hours Day", an event which is annually
celebrated in one of the great holidays of Australasia. The
honour of initiating the movement belongs to New Zealand, where,
even before 1850, the Otago Association, in building its capital
city of Dunedin, applied the principle. Everywhere, as was
natural, the earliest classes of operatives to follow suit were
those of the building trade; the great demand for their services
in the early days of the colonies rendering them irresistible.
Ere the reaction inevitably consequent upon a period of feverish
activity had set in, the passing of the Trade Union Acts of 1871
and 1875 in England had given a further stimulus to the
organizing movement; and these statutes were speedily adopted
throughout Australia. Even before 1871, however, and only a few
years after a similar tendency had manifested itself in England,
federations of Unions, under the names of "Trades Committees" or
"Trades and Labour Councils", had been formed in the chief
Australian cities. The earliest of these was the Trades Committee
of Melbourne, formed in 1859. Each capital city, and many
others, have now their Parliaments of Labour; and inter-colonial
congresses of their representatives are from time to time
held.</p>
<p>It was natural that such powerfully organized bodies should
seek to exercise a direct influence on the colonial legislatures;
and, very wisely, both for themselves and the whole community,
they determined to exercise it through elected members of
Parliament, representative of their views. The "Labour" member
became a conspicuous feature in the colonial Parliaments of the
last decade of the nineteenth century; especially after the great
shearing, mining, and maritime strikes of 1890-2. With the
arrival of Federation, the political influence of "Labour"
rapidly increased; and, as has been said, the control of the
Commonwealth has three times since 1900 been in the hands of a
Labour Government, whilst the same party has been in power in
several of the States. A word must be said as to the practical
achievements of its representatives in amelioration of the lot of
the labouring classes.</p>
<p>Even before the appearance in Parliament of the "Labour"
member, the Colony of Victoria, stirred to emulation by the long
series of English statutes which, after the great victory of Lord
Shaftesbury in 1844, had culminated in the Factory and Workshop
Regulation Acts of 1867, had inaugurated similar legislation in
Australia. In 1873 was passed, in Victoria, the first Australian
Factory Act, with the double object of securing the enforcement
of sanitary regulations in factories, and limiting the labour of
women to eight hours a day. But, unfortunately, the enforcement
of the Act was, as had been the case at first in England,
entrusted to local bodies; and it was only after repeated efforts
that a successful system of control was established. A Royal
Commission in 1883 revealed grave abuses, especially in the
employment of unpaid apprentices and the conditions of outside
workers. Even among the adult males in the unorganized trades,
cases of men compelled to work for sixteen or eighteen hours a
day were discovered a fact which sounds incredible to one who
made acquaintance with Australia only seven years later. But the
report of 1883 produced good fruit. A greatly improved Act was
passed in Victoria in 1884, and became the model for the other
Australasian colonies. Tasmania adopted the older Act in the same
year; but the newer model was followed in South Australia in
1894, in New South Wales and Queensland in 1896, in New Zealand
in 1901, and in Western Australia in 1902. As a result, the hours
of women and children in factories have, everywhere throughout
Australasia, been limited to a maximum of forty-eight a week (in
New Zealand forty-five); compulsory holidays, both in factories
and shops, have been introduced; stringent provisions for the
guarding of dangerous machinery are in force; the supply of
ventilation, opportunities for meals, drinking-water, sanitary
conveniences, seats, and even, in some cases, dressing-rooms, is
compulsory; and strict precautions against fire are enforced.
Perhaps the most striking feature of the system are the
provisions, to be found in all the States, as well as in the
Dominion of New Zealand, requiring the payment of a minimum wage;
but, as this minimum appears never to exceed five shillings a
week (in New Zealand) and falls as low as half a crown (in
Victoria and Queensland), those familiar with the high average
earnings of manual labour in Australasia may suspect that these
figures represent attempts to discourage abuses of the
apprenticeship system, rather than any estimate of the current
rate of wages for adult labourers. This is fixed by the organized
efforts of the Trade Unions, and ranges from the ten shillings a
day of the unskilled labourer in the mines of Western Australia,
to the average of thirty-two shillings a week paid, in the year
1909, to the factory worker throughout Australia. Needless to
say, nominally high wages mean everywhere increased cost of
living; and the factory hand in Hobart is probably far better off
in every way with his thirty-five shillings, than the miner at
Coolgardie with his sixty or seventy, or even than his brother
factory-hand at Perth with his forty-seven. Much of the success
of the factory legislation in Australasia has, undoubtedly, been
due to the fact, that its introduction and enforcement have
proceeded, in most cases, from Cabinet Ministers of Labour,
specially concerned with the welfare of the industrial
classes.</p>
<p>But more instructive to English readers, because more novel,
than the factory legislation of Australasia, are the legislative
efforts which have in recent years been made in the southern
hemisphere to settle industrial disputes by methods less barbaric
than those of the strike and the lock-out. Inasmuch as this
problem is one of the most difficult that modern communities have
to face, it is not surprising to find that, at first sight, there
appears to be infinite variety of treatment throughout
Australasia in the matter. Nevertheless, it will probably be
found, that most varieties of treatment accorded to the subject
range themselves under one of two systems, which may for
convenience be called the Wages Board system and the Arbitration
Court system.</p>
<p>The Wages Board system, briefly, aims at establishing, for
each trade in which circumstances require it, a special board,
consisting of equal numbers of employers and employees in that
trade, whose "determinations" on wages questions shall be,
subject in some cases to suspension by the Government, or an
appeal to a Court of Industrial Appeals, consisting of a judge or
judges, binding on employers and employees throughout the trade.
In Victoria, where the system originated in 1896, the members of
the special boards were at first elected; but they are now
appointed by the Governor, on the nomination of the Minister of
Labour, subject to a protest by a certain proportion of the
employers or employees engaged in the trade in question. The
system is not applied to all trades indiscriminately; but, after
beginning with three or four trades, and the employment of women
and children, it is now applicable to almost any widely extended
trade, on resolutions of both Houses of Parliament, moved by a
Minister of the Crown.</p>
<p>The Wages Board system, which, after a trial of its rival, the
Arbitration Court system, was adopted by New South Wales in 1908,
and is now in force in all the States of Australia, obviously
aims at the prevention, rather than the cure, of industrial
disputes. The Arbitration Court system, on the other hand, aims
at allaying disputes which have actually broken out, or are, at
least, threatened. It began in Victoria in 1891, with a voluntary
scheme; and South Australia, in 1894, introduced a compulsory
system. But these experiments were not successful; and the credit
of the real success of the Arbitration Court system must be given
to the remarkable Conciliation and Arbitration Act which, after
four years of discussion, came into force in New Zealand on New
Year's Day, 1895. As its name implies, the Act aimed, first, at
settling disputes by mutual agreement, second, on failure of this
method, by compulsory arbitration. To secure the former object, a
local board, consisting of equal numbers of employers and
employees, with an impartial chairman, was to be set up in each
"industrial district" of the colony. The election of the
representative members of the boards was to be in the hands of
the associations of employers and employees who chose to register
under the Act; but any employer or any Trade Union could bring a
dispute before a Board. The award of the latter was to be only in
the nature of friendly advice; but either party could appeal from
it to the Arbitration Court of the colony, consisting of a judge
of the Supreme Court and two assessors appointed respectively by
federations of employers' associations and Trade Unions. The
decision of this Court might, again, be merely in the nature of
advice; but, on the other hand, it might be an award in the
strictest sense, binding on the parties, and enforceable, by
substantial fines, on both employers and employees. The Act
further contained a remarkable clause enabling industrial
agreements made between employers and Trade Unions, relative to
the conduct of business, to be registered in the Supreme Court;
and such agreements might be made legally binding for periods not
exceeding three years.</p>
<p>The best testimony to the value of the New Zealand scheme of
1895 is to be found in the facts, that it has been largely made
use of; that, since it came into operation, industrial peace has
succeeded industrial war; and that the period of its operation
has been one of unprecedented commercial prosperity in the
Dominion. That such novel legislation should have proved to be
imperfect in details is not remarkable; but these imperfections
have been largely overcome by amending legislation. That trifling
labour disputes have occurred since it was enacted, is no
reflection upon it; for these disputes have been almost entirely
confined to unorganized labour, which cannot initiate proceedings
under the Act, though it is bound by the provisions of awards
resulting from the proceedings initiated by organized labour.
Perhaps the most serious criticism that can be made upon the
measure is, that it put direct pressure upon all employees to
become members of Trade Unions; not merely by denying to
unorganized workers the right to initiate proceedings under it,
but by authorizing the Arbitration Court to order employers to
give preference to unionists where it should see fit to do
so.</p>
<p>In the face of the great success of the New Zealand
legislation, it is a little difficult to see why the similar
scheme in force in New South Wales from 1901 to 1908 was
abandoned. But it would appear that the system set up in Western
Australia in 1902, and amended in 1909, has been effective; and
it is noteworthy that the Federal Parliament, which, under the
Constitution Act, has power to deal with industrial disputes
extending beyond the limits of a single State, has set up a
drastic system of compulsory arbitration, under which strikes and
lock-outs are absolutely forbidden.</p>
<p>Whilst not attempting to dogmatize as to the comparative
merits of the two systems just outlined, it may be permitted to
an outsider to offer two suggestions. The first is, that,
although the success of the one may render the need for the other
less pressing, there seems to be no reason why the two systems
should not exist side by side, with advantage to the community,
as, indeed, they do in Western Australia. The second suggestion
is, that even industrial disputes, cruel as they often are, may
have their value in stimulating inventiveness. Many a useful
production would never have seen the light but for the urgent
need of overcoming a difficulty produced by a strike or a
lock-out. There is danger in lulling industry into apathy and
conservatism.</p>
<p>To return to Australian history, however, it is to be observed
that the Federal Parliament has found its powers under the
Constitution inadequate to enable it to deal as it would wish
with commerce and industry, and has recently appealed, by
referendum, but without success, for their enlargement. One of
its most remarkable movements has been towards adapting the
machinery of the protective tariff which it favours, to
benefiting the conditions of industry, by granting fiscal
privileges to employers who give "fair and reasonable"
remuneration to their employees. A less debateable measure of the
Federal Parliament was the Old Age Pensions Act of 1908, under
which every needy and reputable white person of the age of
sixty-five, who has resided continuously in Australia for
twenty-five (since reduced to twenty) years, and every person of
the age of sixteen who has, in Australia, become permanently
incapacitated for work, is entitled to a pension not exceeding
ten shillings a week. The credit for the introduction of this
benevolent system into the southern hemisphere belongs, however,
not to Australia, but to New Zealand, where a scheme began to
operate in 1898. It was copied in New South Wales, Victoria, and
Queensland, between 1900 and 1908; but, on the adoption of the
Commonwealth scheme, these State provisions ceased to operate.
The Commonwealth Act of 1908 contained a remarkable provision
enabling the minimum age for women pensioners to be reduced by
the Government to sixty years; and effect was given to this
provision in 1910. It should be pointed out that, though
substantial amounts are annually expended from public funds
throughout Australasia in the relief of destitution, there is no
systematic scheme, like the English Poor Law, which enables every
needy person to claim relief as a matter of right. The number of
pensions current on the 30th June 1910, in Australia, was 65,492,
and the expenditure thereon during the preceding year
&pound;1,497,330. The number of pensioners was just under 15 per
1,000 of the inhabitants, very evenly distributed throughout the
States, except that in Western Australia, which at present
contains a large proportion of young colonists, it only reached
8.45 per 1,000. The numbers of the sexes drawing pensions were
also singularly equal; there being a preponderance of about six
per cent. of women. The cost of the scheme during the same period
amounted to six shillings and ten pence a head of the
population.</p>
<p>A third novelty in social organization for which the
enterprising politicians of New Zealand were responsible, was the
introduction of Woman Suffrage in 1893. By the Electoral Act of
that year, women of both races, British and Maori, were given the
right to vote at elections for the House of Representatives on
precisely the same terms as men; and the example of New Zealand
was rapidly followed by South Australia in 1894. Then there was a
long pause in the movement; but Western Australia followed its
eastern neighbour in 1899, and the advent of federation in 1900
brought the question strongly to the front. For the Constitution
Act, though it did not in terms provide for Woman Suffrage, yet,
by enacting that the franchise for the Federal Houses should at
first be, "in each State, that which is prescribed by the law of
the State as the qualification of the electors of the more
numerous House of Parliament of the State," and, afterwards, such
as the Federal Parliament should provide, made a demand for the
increase of the States' electorates almost irresistible.
Accordingly, in 1902, the old parent colony of New South Wales
opened the ranks of its electors to women; and its example was
followed by Tasmania in 1903, Queensland in 1905, and, finally,
by Victoria in 1909. Meanwhile, however, the Federal Parliament
itself had given the more reluctant States a lead by an Act of
1902, which introduced adult suffrage for the Federal elections;
so that women have been capable of voting at such elections
throughout Australia since that year. Nor have they failed to
exercise their rights; for, in the three General Elections which
have been held since the inauguration of the Federal Parliament
in 1901, nearly three million votes have been cast by women, as
against rather less than three million four hundred by men, while
in the State elections women have been proportionately active. It
is a little doubtful whether, by the terms of the Constitution
Act, women are legally capable of being elected to Parliament;
but it is believed that, as a matter of fact, neither in
Australia nor in New Zealand has any woman yet taken her seat as
a member of a federal or State legislature.</p>
<p>Before leaving the subject of franchise qualifications,
reference may be made to another striking provision of the New
Zealand Electoral Act of 1893, by which any qualified elector who
failed to record his vote at an election was to have his name
removed from the electoral register after the election. This
drastic provision seems to have been unnecessary for stimulating
the holders of the franchise to do their duty; for, though it was
repealed in 1905, yet in the recent elections of 1908 nearly 80
per cent. of the registered electors voted. Inasmuch as over 99
per cent. of the adult inhabitants of the Dominion are registered
electors, it will be seen that a General Election in New Zealand
involves a real expression of popular opinion. The Dominion
elections of 1908 were also remarkable for the introduction of
the Second Ballot, i.e. the rule by which no candidate who does
not receive an absolute majority of the votes recorded at the
first ballot in any constituency, is declared elected without a
second ballot, in which the two highest candidates are pitted
against one another. In 1908 there were twenty-three second
ballots; and of the twenty-three candidates who were thus
compelled to face a second ordeal, eight were rejected in favour
of rivals who had received fewer votes at the first ballot. In
Victoria, a more original effort to prevent misrepresentation was
made in the Compulsory Preferential Voting Act of 1911, which
took effect at the Victorian General Election of November last.
By that statute, voters are compelled (on pain of having their
votes rejected altogether) to indicate the order of their
preference for all the candidates on the ballot paper. If no one
of these obtains, at the first count, an absolute majority of the
votes cast, the lowest candidate is then rejected, and the second
votes on his ballot papers counted towards the candidates for
whom they are given; and so on, until some candidate obtains an
absolute majority of the votes cast.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it may be observed that, though, happily, an
entire stranger to any personal experience of the horrors of war,
Australia has, especially in recent years, manifested an
increasing determination to guard her shores against foreign
attack, as well as to contribute her quota to Imperial
defence.</p>
<p>After the withdrawal of the Imperial forces in 1870, various
arrangements of a more or less perfect kind were made by the
separate colonies for the maintenance and training of citizen
troops on a volunteer basis. To these were added, in the years
1883-4, a number of bodies of partially-paid militia, who
received arms, accoutrements, ammunition, and military
necessaries from the Government, together with a small annual
allowance in money. From these men, of course, a higher condition
of efficiency was demanded than from the "volunteers"; but they
were not professional troops in the strict sense. Of strictly
"permanent" soldiers there were in Australia, on the eve of the
passing of the Commonwealth Act, less than 1,500, mostly staff,
artillery, and engineers. The militia and volunteers at that date
amounted to rather less than 30,000. On the naval side,
arrangements for the maintenance of ships of the British Navy in
various ports had been in force from about 1883 onwards; and in
1890 the whole of the Australasian colonies (including New
Zealand) entered into an agreement with the Imperial Government
for the maintenance in Australasian waters of a naval squadron,
consisting of five third-class naval cruisers and two torpedo
boats, of which three cruisers and one gunboat were actually to
be kept in commission. The first cost of the vessels was defrayed
by the Imperial Government; but the colonies bound themselves for
ten years to pay an annual 5 per cent. on the cost of
construction, and an annual sum of &pound;91,000 for up-keep.
Needless to say, this squadron was not considered sufficient for
the defence of Australasia; it was an addition to the ships
maintained by the Imperial Government on the Australian Naval
Station.</p>
<p>Once more, the advent of federation inaugurated a new era;
and, in the year 1903, the Federal Government united with the
Government of New Zealand in renewing and extending the Naval
Agreement of 1890. On this occasion, which is also noteworthy as
affording an instance of co-operation between federated Australia
and the Dominion, the number of ships was increased to eleven, of
which seven, with a complement of 25 officers and 700 men, were
to be kept in commission, and the annual contribution to a
maximum of &pound;240,000. Arrangements were made by this
agreement (which holds till 1913) for the annual nomination of
eight naval cadets from Australia, and two from New Zealand, to
the British navy; and, in addition to these professional sailors,
and a few permanently employed by the Federal Government, upwards
of 1,700 naval volunteers and cadets have been organized in
Australia.</p>
<p>In the year in which it renewed the Naval Agreement, the
Federal Government also took in hand the subject of the land
forces. All male inhabitants between eighteen and sixty were
declared liable to serve in time of war; cadet corps were
established; various provisions for increasing the mobility and
efficiency of the forces on service were enacted; and the
requirements of drill and training on the part of the militia and
volunteers were made more stringent. In the year 1905, a Council
of Defence, with Naval and Military Boards, was established to
assist the Minister, and to ensure continuity of administration.
A purely Australian navy was commenced in 1909 with an order for
three torpedo-boat destroyers; one to be delivered in Australia
in sections, for local completion. The visit of Lord Kitchener in
1909 still further stimulated the movement; and, as the result of
his advice, plans already framed were modified, and a new and
comprehensive scheme of defence inaugurated in 1910. The
liability of all adult males to serve, not merely in time of war,
but in time of peace, is affirmed. The actual training is,
however, except in time of peril, to be confined to those between
fourteen and twenty-six years of age. These will be divided into
four classes, viz. junior cadets (twelve to fourteen), senior
cadets (fourteen to eighteen), full citizen forces (eighteen to
twenty-five), and a class from twenty-five to twenty-six with
very light duties. It is not intended, of course, that the whole
time of any of these classes shall be devoted to military duties;
but the third class will do annually sixteen whole-day drills, of
which eight at least will be in camps of continuous training. The
new scheme will necessarily take some time to establish; but
registration of cadets has already begun, 20,000 senior cadets
will begin to train during the present year, and will be
increased by 20,000 yearly up to the year 1919, while next year
20,000 full citizen forces will be enrolled, increasing by a
similar number in each successive year. When the scheme is fully
working, there should be in Australia 114,000 men above the age
of eighteen trained to the use of arms.</p>
<p>Nor have the requirements of the Australian navy been
overlooked in the care for the land forces. The three vessels
ordered in 1909 have already been launched, and are known as the
<i>Parramatta</i>, the <i>Yarra</i>, and the <i>Warrego</i>. But,
as the result of a visit by Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson in
1911, a far more ambitious naval scheme has been proposed, to
comprise a total Australian fleet of fifty-two vessels, with a
complement of 15,000 men. Other proposals include the immediate
establishment of a Military College in the new federal capital,
and the formation of a Railway War Council, to secure
co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States Railway
Departments with regard to the concentration and mobilization of
troops. Such a scheme should be specially effective in Australia,
where, of the 16,000 miles of railways open, 15,400 belong to the
States.</p>
<p>New Zealand has, as will be remembered by those who have read
the earlier chapters of this book, had practical experience of
war in her conflicts between the settlers and the Maoris. It is
hardly surprising, therefore, to find that she has not been
behindhand in maintaining her land defences. At the close of the
year 1909, she had nearly 14,000 men at least partially trained
to arms. In that year a new Act came into force, imposing the
obligation of undergoing military training on all males between
the ages of fourteen and twenty-one.</p>
<p>It would be ungrateful to close this work without a heartfelt
tribute to the splendid services rendered to the Empire by the
Australasian contingents in the South African war. Not less than
21,000 men volunteered and were accepted for service with the
British forces; and the moral effect of the gift was even greater
than its substantial military value. It was one of the many
pregnant and welcome signs, that the "crimson thread of kinship",
which binds together the free peoples of the Empire, is stronger
than the adamantine chains of despotic rule, and that even those
now living may see the day when the potential energies of that
Empire shall be linked together into the strongest, and yet the
freest union which the world has ever known.</p>

<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL APPENDIX.</h3>
<br>
<p>[As explained in the Preface, the author has relied for his
material almost exclusively upon original sources of information.
It being, however, part of the plan of the series to which this
book belongs, to include a reference to works dealing with the
subject, for the information of those readers who may wish to
pursue their studies further, a short list is here appended. But
the author must, at the risk of appearing ungracious, expressly
disclaim responsibility for the accuracy of all the works cited,
some of which are valuable rather as illustrations of Australian
character than as records of facts.]</p>
