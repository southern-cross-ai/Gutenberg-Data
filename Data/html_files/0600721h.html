<h2><a id="pigeons1" name="pigeons1"></a>1. THE WHISTLER IN THE
DARK</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">GRISWELL awoke suddenly, every nerve
tingling with a premonition of imminent peril. He stared about
wildly, unable at first to remember where he was, or what he was
doing there. Moonlight filtered in through the dusty windows, and
the great empty room with its lofty ceiling and gaping black
fireplace was spectral and unfamiliar. Then as he emerged from the
clinging cobwebs of his recent sleep, he remembered where he was
and how he came to be there. He twisted his head and stared at his
companion, sleeping on the floor near him. John Branner was but a
vaguely bulking shape in the darkness that the moon scarcely
grayed.</p>

<p>Griswell tried to remember what had awakened him. There was no
sound in the house, no sound outside except the mournful hoot of an
owl, far away in the piny woods. Now he had captured the illusive
memory. It was a dream, a nightmare so filled with dim terror that
it had frightened him awake. Recollection flooded back, vividly
etching the abominable vision.</p>

<p>Or was it a dream? Certainly it must have been, but it had
blended so curiously with recent actual events that it was
difficult to know where reality left off and fantasy began.</p>

<p>Dreaming, he had seemed to relive his past few waking hours, in
accurate detail. The dream had begun, abruptly, as he and John
Branner came in sight of the house where they now lay. They had
come rattling and bouncing over the stumpy, uneven old road that
led through the pinelands, he and John Branner, wandering far
afield from their New England home, in search of vacation pleasure.
They had sighted the old house with its balustraded galleries
rising amidst a wilderness of weeds and bushes, just as the sun was
setting behind it. It dominated their fancy, rearing black and
stark and gaunt against the low lurid rampart of sunset, barred by
the black pines.</p>

<p>They were tired, sick of bumping and pounding all day over
woodland roads. The old deserted house stimulated their imagination
with its suggestion of antebellum splendor and ultimate decay. They
left the automobile beside the rutty road, and as they went up the
winding walk of crumbling bricks, almost lost in the tangle of rank
growth, pigeons rose from the balustrades in a fluttering, feathery
crowd and swept away with a low thunder of beating wings.</p>

<p>The oaken door sagged on broken hinges. Dust lay thick on the
floor of the wide, dim hallway, on the broad steps of the stair
that mounted up from the hall. They turned into a door opposite the
landing, and entered a large room, empty, dusty, with cobwebs
shining thickly in the corners. Dust lay thick over the ashes in
the great fireplace.</p>

<p>They discussed gathering wood and building a fire, but decided
against it. As the sun sank, darkness came quickly, the thick,
black, absolute darkness of the pinelands. They knew that
rattlesnakes and copperheads haunted Southern forests, and they did
not care to go groping for firewood in the dark. They ate frugally
from tins, then rolled in their blankets fully clad before the
empty fireplace, and went instantly to sleep.</p>

<p>This, in part, was what Griswell had dreamed. He saw again the
gaunt house looming stark against the crimson sunset; saw the
flight of the pigeons as he and Branner came up the shattered walk.
He saw the dim room in which they presently lay, and he saw the two
forms that were himself and his companion, lying wrapped in their
blankets on the dusty floor. Then from that point his dream altered
subtly, passed out of the realm of the commonplace and became
tinged with fear. He was looking into a vague, shadowy chamber, lit
by the gray light of the moon which streamed in from some obscure
source. For there was no window in that room. But in the gray light
he saw three silent shapes that hung suspended in a row, and their
stillness and their outlines woke chill horror in his soul. There
was no sound, no word, but he sensed a Presence of fear and lunacy
crouching in a dark corner... Abruptly he was back in the dusty,
high-ceilinged room, before the great fireplace.</p>

<p>He was lying in his blankets, staring tensely through the dim
door and across the shadowy hall, to where a beam of moonlight fell
across the balustraded stair, some seven steps up from the landing.
And there was something on the stair, a bent, misshapen, shadowy
thing that never moved fully into the beam of light. But a dim
yellow blur that might have been a face was turned toward him, as
if <i>something</i> crouched on the stair, regarding him and his
companion. Fright crept chilly through his veins, and it was then
that he awoke&mdash;if indeed he had been asleep.</p>

<p>He blinked his eyes. The beam of moonlight fell across the stair
just as he had dreamed it did; but no figure lurked there. Yet his
flesh still crawled from the fear the dream or vision had roused in
him; his legs felt as if they had been plunged in ice-water. He
made an involuntary movement to awaken his companion, when a sudden
sound paralyzed him.</p>

<p>It was the sound of whistling on the floor above. Eery and sweet
it rose, not carrying any tune, but piping shrill and melodious.
Such a sound in a supposedly deserted house was alarming enough;
but it was more than the fear of a physical invader that held
Griswell frozen. He could not himself have defined the horror that
gripped him. But Branner's blankets rustled, and Griswell saw he
was sitting upright. His figure bulked dimly in the soft darkness,
the head turned toward the stair as if the man were listening
intently. More sweetly and more subtly evil rose that weird
whistling.</p>

<p>"John!" whispered Griswell from dry lips. He had meant to
shout&mdash;to tell Branner that there was somebody upstairs,
somebody who could mean them no good; that they must leave the
house at once. But his voice died dryly in his throat.</p>

<p>Branner had risen. His boots clumped on the floor as he moved
toward the door. He stalked leisurely into the hall and made for
the lower landing, merging with the shadows that clustered black
about the stair.</p>

<p>Griswell lay incapable of movement, his mind a whirl of
bewilderment. Who was that whistling upstairs? Why was Branner
going up those stairs? Griswell saw him pass the spot where the
moonlight rested, saw his head tilted back as if he were looking at
something Griswell could not see, above and beyond the stair. But
his face was like that of a sleepwalker. He moved across the bar of
moonlight and vanished from Griswell's view, even as the latter
tried to shout to him to come back. A ghastly whisper was the only
result of his effort.</p>

<p>The whistling sank to a lower note, died out. Griswell heard the
stairs creaking under Branner's measured tread. Now he had reached
the hallway above, for Griswell heard the clump of his feet moving
along it. Suddenly the footfalls halted, and the whole night seemed
to hold its breath. Then an awful scream split the stillness, and
Griswell started up, echoing the cry.</p>

<p>The strange paralysis that had held him was broken. He took a
step toward the door, then checked himself. The footfalls were
resumed. Branner was coming back. He was not running. The tread was
even more deliberate and measured than before. Now the stairs began
to creak again. A groping hand, moving along the balustrade, came
into the bar of moonlight; then another, and a ghastly thrill went
through Griswell as he saw that the other hand gripped a
hatchet&mdash;a hatchet which dripped blackly. <i>Was</i> that
Branner who was coming down that stair?</p>

<p>Yes! The figure had moved into the bar of moonlight now, and
Griswell recognized it. Then he saw Branner's face, and a shriek
burst from Griswell's lips. Branner's face was bloodless,
corpse-like; gouts of blood dripped darkly down it; his eyes were
glassy and set, and blood oozed from the great gash which <i>cleft
the crown of his head!</i></p>

<p>Griswell never remembered exactly how he got out of that
accursed house. Afterward he retained a mad, confused impression of
smashing his way through a dusty cobwebbed window, of stumbling
blindly across the weed-choked lawn, gibbering his frantic horror.
He saw the black wall of the pines, and the moon floating in a
blood-red mist in which there was neither sanity nor reason.</p>

<p>Some shred of sanity returned to him as he saw the automobile
beside the road. In a world gone suddenly mad, that was an object
reflecting prosaic reality; but even as he reached for the door, a
dry chilling whir sounded in his ears, and he recoiled from the
swaying undulating shape that arched up from its scaly coils on the
driver's seat and hissed sibilantly at him, darting a forked tongue
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>With a sob of horror he turned and fled down the road, as a man
runs in a nightmare. He ran without purpose or reason. His numbed
brain was incapable of conscious thought. He merely obeyed the
blind primitive urge to run&mdash;run&mdash;run until he fell
exhausted.</p>

<p>The black walls of the pines flowed endlessly past him; so he
was seized with the illusion that he was getting nowhere. But
presently a sound penetrated the fog of his terror&mdash;the
steady, inexorable patter of feet behind him. Turning his head, he
saw <i>something</i> loping after him&mdash;wolf or dog, he could
not tell which, but its eyes glowed like balls of green fire. With
a gasp he increased his speed, reeled around a bend in the road,
and heard a horse snort; saw it rear and heard its rider curse; saw
the gleam of blue steel in the man's lifted hand.</p>

<p>He staggered and fell, catching at the rider's stirrup.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, help me!" he panted. "The thing! It killed
Branner&mdash;it's coming after me! <i>Look!</i>"</p>

<p>Twin balls of fire gleamed in the fringe of bushes at the turn
of the road. The rider swore again, and on the heels of his
profanity came the smashing report of his six-shooter&mdash;again
and yet again. The fire-sparks vanished, and the rider, jerking his
stirrup free from Griswell's grasp, spurred his horse at the bend.
Griswell staggered up, shaking in every limb. The rider was out of
sight only a moment; then he came galloping back.</p>

<p>"Took to the brush. Timber wolf, I reckon, though I never heard
of one chasin' a man before. Do you know what it was?"</p>

<p>Griswell could only shake his head weakly.</p>

<p>The rider, etched in the moonlight, looked down at him, smoking
pistol still lifted in his right hand. He was a compactly-built man
of medium height, and his broad-brimmed planter's hat and his boots
marked him as a native of the country as definitely as Griswell's
garb stamped him as a stranger.</p>

<p>"What's all this about, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Griswell answered helplessly. "My name's
Griswell. John Branner&mdash;my friend who was traveling with
me&mdash;we stopped at a deserted house back down the road to spend
the night. Something&mdash;" at the memory he was choked by a rush
of horror. "My God!" he screamed. "I must be mad! <i>Something</i>
came and looked over the balustrade of the stair&mdash;something
with a yellow face! I thought I dreamed it, but it must have been
real. Then somebody began whistling upstairs, and Branner rose and
went up the stairs walking like a man in his sleep, or hypnotized.
I heard him scream&mdash;or someone screamed; then he came down the
stair again with a bloody hatchet in his hand&mdash;and my God,
sir, he was <i>dead!</i> His head had been split open. I saw brains
and clotted blood oozing down his face, and his face was that of a
dead man. <i>But he came down the stairs!</i> As God is my witness,
John Branner was murdered in that dark upper hallway, and then his
dead body came stalking down the stairs with a hatchet in its
hand&mdash;to kill me!"</p>

<p>The rider made no reply; he sat his horse like a statue,
outlined against the stars, and Griswell could not read his
expression, his face shadowed by his hat-brim.</p>

<p>"You think I'm mad," he said hopelessly. "Perhaps I am."</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think," answered the rider. "If it was any
house but the old Blassenville Manor&mdash;well, we'll see. My
name's Buckner. I'm sheriff of this county. Took a prisoner over to
the county-seat in the next county and was ridin' back late."</p>

<p>He swung off his horse and stood beside Griswell, shorter than
the lanky New Englander, but much harder knit. There was a natural
manner of decision and certainty about him, and it was easy to
believe that he would be a dangerous man in any sort of a
fight.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid to go back to the house?" he asked, and Griswell
shuddered, but shook his head, the dogged tenacity of Puritan
ancestors asserting itself.</p>

<p>"The thought of facing that horror again turns me sick. But poor
Branner&mdash;" he choked again. "We must find his body. My God!"
he cried, unmanned by the abysmal horror of the thing; "<i>what</i>
will we find? If a dead man walks, what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll see." The sheriff caught the reins in the crook of his
left elbow and began filling the empty chambers of his big blue
pistol as they walked along.</p>

<p>As they made the turn Griswell's blood was ice at the thought of
what they might see lumbering up the road with a bloody, grinning
death-mask, but they saw only the house looming spectrally among
the pines, down the road. A strong shudder shook Griswell.</p>

<p>"God, how <i>evil</i> that house looks, against those black
pines! It looked sinister from the very first&mdash;when we went up
the broken walk and saw those pigeons fly up from the
porch&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pigeons?" Buckner cast him a quick glance. "You saw the
pigeons?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes! Scores of them perching on the porch railing."</p>

<p>They strode on for a moment in silence, before Buckner said
abruptly: "I've lived in this country all my life. I've passed the
old Blassenville place a thousand times, I reckon, at all hours of
the day and night. But I never saw a pigeon anywhere around it, or
anywhere else in these woods."</p>

<p>"There were scores of them," repeated Griswell, bewildered.</p>

<p>"I've seen men who swore they'd seen a flock of pigeons perched
along the balusters just at sundown," said Buckner slowly.
"Negroes, all of them except one man. A tramp. He was buildin' a
fire in the yard, aimin' to camp there that night. I passed along
there about dark, and he told me about the pigeons. I came back by
there the next mornin'. The ashes of his fire were there, and his
tin cup, and skillet where he'd fried pork, and his blankets looked
like they'd been slept in. Nobody ever saw him again. That was
twelve years ago. The blacks say they can see the pigeons, but no
black would pass along this road between sundown and sunup. They
say the pigeons are the souls of the Blassenvilles, let out of hell
at sunset. The Negroes say the red glare in the west is the light
from hell, because then the gates of hell are open, and the
Blassenvilles fly out."</p>

<p>"Who were the Blassenvilles?" asked Griswell, shivering.</p>

<p>"They owned all this land here. French-English family. Came here
from the West Indies before the Louisiana Purchase. The Civil War
ruined them, like it did so many. Some were killed in the War; most
of the others died out. Nobody's lived in the Manor since 1890 when
Miss Elizabeth Blassenville, the last of the line, fled from the
old house one night like it was a plague spot, and never came back
to it&mdash;this your auto?"</p>

<p>They halted beside the car, and Griswell stared morbidly at the
grim house. Its dusty panes were empty and blank; but they did not
seem blind to him. It seemed to him that ghastly eyes were fixed
hungrily on him through those darkened panes. Buckner repeated his
question.</p>

<p>"Yes. Be careful. There's a snake on the seat&mdash;or there
was."</p>

<p>"Not there now," grunted Buckner, tying his horse and pulling an
electric torch out of the saddle-bag. "Well, let's have a
look."</p>

<p>He strode up the broken brick walk as matter-of-factly as if he
were paying a social call on friends. Griswell followed close at
his heels, his heart pounding suffocatingly. A scent of decay and
moldering vegetation blew on the faint wind, and Griswell grew
faint with nausea, that rose from a frantic abhorrence of these
black woods, these ancient plantation houses that hid forgotten
secrets of slavery and bloody pride and mysterious intrigues. He
had thought of the South as a sunny, lazy land washed by soft
breezes laden with spice and warm blossoms, where life ran
tranquilly to the rhythm of black folk singing in sunbathed
cottonfields. But now he had discovered another, unsuspected
side&mdash;a dark, brooding, fear-haunted side, and the discovery
repelled him.</p>

<p>The oaken door sagged as it had before. The blackness of the
interior was intensified by the beam of Buckner's light playing on
the sill. That beam sliced through the darkness of the hallway and
roved up the stair, and Griswell held his breath, clenching his
fists. But no shape of lunacy leered down at them. Buckner went in,
walking light as a cat, torch in one hand, gun in the other.</p>

<p>As he swung his light into the room across from the stairway,
Griswell cried out&mdash;and cried out again, almost fainting with
the intolerable sickness at what he saw. A trail of blood drops led
across the floor, crossing the blankets Branner had occupied, which
lay between the door and those in which Griswell had lain. And
Griswell's blankets had a terrible occupant. John Branner lay
there, face down, his cleft head revealed in merciless clarity in
the steady light. His outstretched hand still gripped the haft of a
hatchet, and the blade was imbedded deep in the blanket and the
floor beneath, just where Griswell's head had lain when he slept
there.</p>

<p>A momentary rush of blackness engulfed Griswell. He was not
aware that he staggered, or that Buckner caught him. When he could
see and hear again, he was violently sick and hung his head against
the mantel, retching miserably.</p>

<p>Buckner turned the light full on him, making him blink.
Buckner's voice came from behind the blinding radiance, the man
himself unseen.</p>

<p>"Griswell, you've told me a yarn that's hard to believe. I saw
something chasin' you, but it might have been a timber wolf, or a
mad dog.</p>

<p>"If you're holdin' back anything, you better spill it. What you
told me won't hold up in any court. You're bound to be accused of
killin' your partner. I'll have to arrest you. If you'll give me
the straight goods now, it'll make it easier. Now, didn't you kill
this fellow, Branner?</p>

<p>"Wasn't it something like this: you quarreled, he grabbed a
hatchet and swung at you, but you dodged and then let <i>him</i>
have it?"</p>

<p>Griswell sank down and hid his face in his hands, his head
swimming.</p>

<p>"Great God, man, I didn't murder John! Why, we've been friends
ever since we were children in school together. I've told you the
truth. I don't blame you for not believing me. But God help me, it
is the truth!"</p>

<p>The light swung back to the gory head again, and Griswell closed
his eyes.</p>

<p>He heard Buckner grunt.</p>

<p>"I believe this hatchet in his hand is the one he was killed
with. Blood and brains plastered on the blade, and hairs stickin'
to it&mdash;hairs exactly the same color as his. This makes it
tough for you, Griswell."</p>

<p>"How so?" the New Englander asked dully.</p>

<p>"Knocks any plea of self-defense in the head. Branner couldn't
have swung at you with this hatchet after you split his skull with
it. You must have pulled the ax out of his head, stuck it into the
floor and clamped his fingers on it to make it look like he'd
attacked you. And it would have been damned clever&mdash;if you'd
used another hatchet."</p>

<p>"But I didn't kill him," groaned Griswell. "I have no intention
of pleading self-defense."</p>

<p>"That's what puzzles me," Buckner admitted frankly,
straightening. "What murderer would rig up such a crazy story as
you've told me, to prove his innocence? Average killer would have
told a logical yarn, at least. Hmmm! Blood drops leadin' from the
door. The body was dragged&mdash;no, couldn't have been dragged.
The floor isn't smeared. You must have carried it here, after
killin' him in some other place. But in that case, why isn't there
any blood on your clothes? Of course you could have changed clothes
and washed your hands. But the fellow hasn't been dead long."</p>

<p>"He walked downstairs and across the room," said Griswell
hopelessly. "He came to kill me. I knew he was coming to kill me
when I saw him lurching down the stair. He struck where I would
have been, if I hadn't awakened. That window&mdash;I burst out at
it. You see it's broken."</p>

<p>"I see. But if he walked then, why isn't he walkin' now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know! I'm too sick to think straight. I've been fearing
that he'd rise up from the floor where he lies and come at me
again. When I heard that wolf running up the road after me, I
thought it was John chasing me&mdash;John, running through the
night with his bloody ax and his bloody head, and his
death-grin!"</p>

<p>His teeth chattered as he lived that horror over again.</p>

<p>Buckner let his light play across the floor.</p>

<p>"The blood drops lead into the hall. Come on. We'll follow
them."</p>

<p>Griswell cringed. "They lead upstairs."</p>

<p>Buckner's eyes were fixed hard on him.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid to go upstairs, with me?"</p>

<p>Griswell's face was gray.</p>

<p>"Yes. But I'm going, with you or without you. The thing that
killed poor John may still be hiding up there."</p>

<p>"Stay behind me," ordered Buckner. "If anything jumps us, I'll
take care of it. But for your own sake, I warn you that I shoot
quicker than a cat jumps, and I don't often miss. If you've got any
ideas of layin' me out from behind, forget them."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool!" Resentment got the better of his
apprehension, and this outburst seemed to reassure Buckner more
than any of his protestations of innocence.</p>

<p>"I want to be fair," he said quietly. "I haven't indicted and
condemned you in my mind already. If only half of what you're
tellin' me is the truth, you've been through a hell of an
experience, and I don't want to be too hard on you. But you can see
how hard it is for me to believe all you've told me."</p>

<p>Griswell wearily motioned for him to lead the way, unspeaking.
They went out into the hall, paused at the landing. A thin string
of crimson drops, distinct in the thick dust, led up the steps.</p>

<p>"Man's tracks in the dust," grunted Buckner. "Go slow. I've got
to be sure of what I see, because we're obliteratin' them as we go
up. Hmmm! One set goin' up, one comin' down. Same man. Not your
tracks. Branner was a bigger man than you are. Blood drops all the
way&mdash;blood on the bannisters like a man had laid his bloody
hand there&mdash;a smear of stuff that looks&mdash;<i>brains</i>.
Now what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He walked down the stair, a dead man," shuddered Griswell.
"Groping with one hand&mdash;the other gripping the hatchet that
killed him."</p>

<p>"Or was carried," muttered the sheriff. "But if somebody carried
him&mdash;<i>where are the tracks?</i>"</p>

<p>They came out into the upper hallway, a vast, empty space of
dust and shadows where time-crusted windows repelled the moonlight
and the ring of Buckner's torch seemed inadequate. Griswell
trembled like a leaf. Here, in darkness and horror, John Branner
had died.</p>

<p>"Somebody whistled up here," he muttered. "John came, as if he
were being called."</p>

<p>Buckner's eyes were blazing strangely in the light.</p>

<p>"The footprints lead down the hall," he muttered. "Same as on
the stair&mdash;one set going, one coming. Same
prints&mdash;<i>Judas!</i>"</p>

<p>Behind him Griswell stifled a cry, for he had seen what prompted
Buckner's exclamation. A few feet from the head of the stair
Branner's footprints stopped abruptly, then returned, treading
almost in the other tracks. And where the trail halted there was a
great splash of blood on the dusty floor&mdash;and other tracks met
it&mdash;tracks of bare feet, narrow but with splayed toes. They
too receded in a second line from the spot.</p>

<p>Buckner bent over them, swearing.</p>

<p>"The tracks meet! And where they meet there's blood and brains
on the floor! Branner must have been killed on that spot&mdash;with
a blow from a hatchet. Bare feet coming out of the darkness to meet
shod feet&mdash;then both turned away again; the shod feet went
downstairs, the bare feet went back down the hall." He directed his
light down the hall. The footprints faded into darkness, beyond the
reach of the beam. On either hand the closed doors of chambers were
cryptic portals of mystery.</p>

<p>"Suppose your crazy tale <i>was</i> true," Buckner muttered,
half to himself. "These aren't your tracks. They look like a
woman's. Suppose somebody did whistle, and Branner went upstairs to
investigate. Suppose somebody met him here in the dark and split
his head. The signs and tracks would have been, in that case, just
as they really are. But if that's so, why isn't Branner lyin' here
where he was killed? Could he have lived long enough to take the
hatchet away from whoever killed him, and stagger downstairs with
it?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Recollection gagged Griswell. "I <i>saw</i> him on the
stair. He was dead. No man could live a minute after receiving such
a wound."</p>

<p>"I believe it," muttered Buckner. "But&mdash;it's madness! Or
else it's <i>too</i> clever&mdash;yet, what sane man would think up
and work out such an elaborate and utterly insane plan to escape
punishment for murder, when a simple plea of self-defense would
have been so much more effective? No court would recognize that
story. Well, let's follow these other tracks. They lead down the
hall&mdash;here, what's this?"</p>

<p>With an icy clutch at his soul, Griswell saw the light was
beginning to grow dim.</p>

<p>"This battery is new," muttered Buckner, and for the first time
Griswell caught an edge of fear in his voice. "Come on&mdash;out of
here quick!"</p>

<p>The light had faded to a faint red glow. The darkness seemed
straining into them, creeping with black cat-feet. Buckner
retreated, pushing Griswell stumbling behind him as he walked
backward, pistol cocked and lifted, down the dark hall. In the
growing darkness Griswell heard what sounded like the stealthy
opening of a door. And suddenly the blackness about them was
vibrant with menace. Griswell knew Buckner sensed it as well as he,
for the sheriff's hard body was tense and taut as a stalking
panther's.</p>

<p>But without haste he worked his way to the stair and backed down
it, Griswell preceding him, and fighting the panic that urged him
to scream and burst into mad flight. A ghastly thought brought icy
sweat out on his flesh. <i>Suppose the dead man were creeping up
the stair behind them in the dark, face frozen in the death-grin,
blood-caked hatchet lifted to strike?</i></p>

<p>This possibility so overpowered him that he was scarcely aware
when his feet struck the level of the lower hallway, and he was
only then aware that the light had grown brighter as they
descended, until it now gleamed with its full power&mdash;but when
Buckner turned it back up the stairway, it failed to illuminate the
darkness that hung like a tangible fog at the head of the
stair.</p>

<p>"The damn thing was conjured," muttered Buckner. "Nothin' else.
It couldn't act like that naturally."</p>

<p>"Turn the light into the room," begged Griswell. "See if
John&mdash;if John is&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could not put the ghastly thought into words, but Buckner
understood.</p>

<p>He swung the beam around, and Griswell had never dreamed that
the sight of the gory body of a murdered man could bring such
relief.</p>

<p>"He's still there," grunted Buckner. "If he walked after he was
killed, he hasn't walked since. But that thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again he turned the light up the stair, and stood chewing his
lip and scowling. Three times he half lifted his gun. Griswell read
his mind. The sheriff was tempted to plunge back up that stair,
take his chance with the unknown. But common sense held him
back.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have a chance in the dark," he muttered. "And I've
got a hunch the light would go out again."</p>

<p>He turned and faced Griswell squarely.</p>

<p>"There's no use dodgin' the question. There's somethin' hellish
in this house, and I believe I have an inklin' of what it is. I
don't believe you killed Branner. Whatever killed him is up
there&mdash;now. There's a lot about your yarn that don't sound
sane; but there's nothin' sane about a flashlight goin' out like
this one did. I don't believe that thing upstairs is human. I never
met anything I was afraid to tackle in the dark before, but I'm not
goin' up there until daylight. It's not long until dawn. We'll wait
for it out there on that gallery."</p>

<p>The stars were already paling when they came out on the broad
porch. Buckner seated himself on the balustrade, facing the door,
his pistol dangling in his fingers. Griswell sat down near him and
leaned back against a crumbling pillar. He shut his eyes, grateful
for the faint breeze that seemed to cool his throbbing brain. He
experienced a dull sense of unreality. He was a stranger in a
strange land, a land that had become suddenly imbued with black
horror. The shadow of the noose hovered above him, and in that dark
house lay John Branner, with his butchered head&mdash;like the
figments of a dream these facts spun and eddied in his brain until
all merged in a gray twilight as sleep came uninvited to his weary
soul.</p>

<p>He awoke to a cold white dawn and full memory of the horrors of
the night. Mists curled about the stems of the pines, crawled in
smoky wisps up the broken walk. Buckner was shaking him.</p>

<p>"Wake up! It's daylight."</p>

<p>Griswell rose, wincing at the stiffness of his limbs. His face
was gray and old.</p>

<p>"I'm ready. Let's go upstairs."</p>

<p>"I've already been!" Buckner's eyes burned in the early dawn. "I
didn't wake you up. I went as soon as it was light. I found
nothin'."</p>

<p>"The tracks of the bare feet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gone!"</p>

<p>"<i>Gone?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, gone! The dust had been disturbed all over the hall, from
the point where Branner's tracks ended; swept into corners. No
chance of trackin' anything there now. Something obliterated those
tracks while we sat here, and I didn't hear a sound. I've gone
through the whole house. Not a sign of anything."</p>

<p>Griswell shuddered at the thought of himself sleeping alone on
the porch while Buckner conducted his exploration.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" he asked listlessly. "With those tracks gone
there goes my only chance of proving my story."</p>

<p>"We'll take Branner's body into the county-seat," answered
Buckner. "Let me do the talkin'. If the authorities knew the facts
as they appear, they'd insist on you being confined and indicted. I
don't believe you killed Branner&mdash;but neither a district
attorney, judge nor jury would believe what you told me, or what
happened to us last night. I'm handlin' this thing my own way. I'm
not goin' to arrest you until I've exhausted every other
possibility.</p>

<p>"Say nothin' about what's happened here, when we get to town.
I'll simply tell the district attorney that John Branner was killed
by a party or parties unknown, and that I'm workin' on the
case.</p>

<p>"Are you game to come back with me to this house and spend the
night here, sleepin' in that room as you and Branner slept last
night?"</p>

<p>Griswell went white, but answered as stoutly as his ancestors
might have expressed their determination to hold their cabins in
the teeth of the Pequots: "I'll do it."</p>

<p>"Let's go then; help me pack the body out to your auto."</p>

<p>Griswell's soul revolted at the sight of John Branner's
bloodless face in the chill white dawn, and the feel of his clammy
flesh. The gray fog wrapped wispy tentacles about their feet as
they carried their grisly burden across the lawn.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="pigeons2" name="pigeons2"></a>2. THE SNAKE'S
BROTHER</h2>

<p>Again the shadows were lengthening over the pinelands, and again
two men came bumping along the old road in a car with a New England
license plate.</p>

<p>Buckner was driving. Griswell's nerves were too shattered for
him to trust himself at the wheel. He looked gaunt and haggard, and
his face was still pallid. The strain of the day spent at the
county-seat was added to the horror that still rode his soul like
the shadow of a black-winged vulture. He had not slept, had not
tasted what he had eaten.</p>

<p>"I told you I'd tell you about the Blassenvilles," said Buckner.
"They were proud folks, haughty, and pretty damn ruthless when they
wanted their way. They didn't treat their slaves as well as the
other planters did&mdash;got their ideas in the West Indies, I
reckon. There was a streak of cruelty in them&mdash;especially Miss
Celia, the last one of the family to come to these parts. That was
long after the slaves had been freed, but she used to whip her
mulatto maid just like she was a slave, the old folks say... The
Negroes said when a Blassenville died, the devil was always waitin'
for him out in the black pines.</p>

<p>"Well, after the Civil War they died off pretty fast, livin' in
poverty on the plantation which was allowed to go to ruin. Finally
only four girls were left, sisters, livin' in the old house and
ekin' out a bare livin', with a few blacks livin' in the old slave
huts and workin' the fields on the share. They kept to themselves,
bein' proud, and ashamed of their poverty. Folks wouldn't see them
for months at a time. When they needed supplies they sent a Negro
to town after them.</p>

<p>"But folks knew about it when Miss Celia came to live with them.
She came from somewhere in the West Indies, where the whole family
originally had its roots&mdash;a fine, handsome woman, they say, in
the early thirties. But she didn't mix with folks any more than the
girls did. She brought a mulatto maid with her, and the
Blassenville cruelty cropped out in her treatment of this maid. I
knew an old man years ago, who swore he saw Miss Celia tie this
girl up to a tree, stark naked, and whip her with a horsewhip.
Nobody was surprised when she disappeared. Everybody figured she'd
run away, of course.</p>

<p>"Well, one day in the spring of 1890 Miss Elizabeth, the
youngest girl, came in to town for the first time in maybe a year.
She came after supplies. Said the blacks had all left the place.
Talked a little more, too, a bit wild. Said Miss Celia had gone,
without leaving any word. Said her sisters thought she'd gone back
to the West Indies, but she believed her aunt <i>was still in the
house</i>. She didn't say what she meant. Just got her supplies and
pulled out for the Manor.</p>

<p>"A month went past, and a black came into town and said that
Miss Elizabeth was livin' at the Manor alone. Said her three
sisters weren't there any more, that they'd left one by one without
givin' any word or explanation. She didn't know where they'd gone,
and was afraid to stay there alone, but didn't know where else to
go. She'd never known anything but the Manor, and had neither
relatives nor friends. But she was in mortal terror of
<i>something</i>. The black said she locked herself in her room at
night and kept candles burnin' all night...</p>

<p>"It was a stormy spring night when Miss Elizabeth came tearin'
into town on the one horse she owned, nearly dead from fright. She
fell from her horse in the square; when she could talk she said
she'd found a secret room in the Manor that had been forgotten for
a hundred years. And she said that there she found her three
sisters, dead, and hangin' by their necks from the ceilin'. She
said <i>something</i> chased her and nearly brained her with an ax
as she ran out the front door, but somehow she got to the horse and
got away. She was nearly crazy with fear, and didn't know what it
was that chased her&mdash;said it looked like a woman with a yellow
face.</p>

<p>"About a hundred men rode out there, right away. They searched
the house from top to bottom, but they didn't find any secret room,
or the remains of the sisters. But they did find a hatchet stickin'
in the doorjamb downstairs, with some of Miss Elizabeth's hairs
stuck on it, just as she'd said. She wouldn't go back there and
show them how to find the secret door; almost went crazy when they
suggested it.</p>

<p>"When she was able to travel, the people made up some money and
loaned it to her&mdash;she was still too proud to accept
charity&mdash;and she went to California. She never came back, but
later it was learned, when she sent back to repay the money they'd
loaned her, that she'd married out there.</p>

<p>"Nobody ever bought the house. It stood there just as she'd left
it, and as the years passed folks stole all the furnishings out of
it, poor white trash, I reckon. A Negro wouldn't go about it. But
they came after sunup and left long before sundown."</p>

<p>"What did the people think about Miss Elizabeth's story?" asked
Griswell.</p>

<p>"Well, most folks thought she'd gone a little crazy, livin' in
that old house alone. But some people believed that mulatto girl,
Joan, didn't run away, after all. They believed she'd hidden in the
woods, and glutted her hatred of the Blassenvilles by murderin'
Miss Celia and the three girls. They beat up the woods with
bloodhounds, but never found a trace of her. If there was a secret
room in the house, she might have been hidin' there&mdash;if there
was anything to that theory."</p>

<p>"She couldn't have been hiding there all these years," muttered
Griswell. "Anyway, the thing in the house now isn't human."</p>

<p>Buckner wrenched the wheel around and turned into a dim trace
that left the main road and meandered off through the pines.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"There's an old Negro that lives off this way a few miles. I
want to talk to him. We're up against something that takes more
than white man's sense. The black people know more than we do about
some things. This old man is nearly a hundred years old. His master
educated him when he was a boy, and after he was freed he traveled
more extensively than most white men do. They say he's a voodoo
man."</p>

<p>Griswell shivered at the phrase, staring uneasily at the green
forest walls that shut them in. The scent of the pines was mingled
with the odors of unfamiliar plants and blossoms. But underlying
all was a reek of rot and decay. Again a sick abhorrence of these
dark mysterious woodlands almost overpowered him.</p>

<p>"Voodoo!" he muttered. "I'd forgotten about that&mdash;I never
could think of black magic in connection with the South. To me
witchcraft was always associated with old crooked streets in
waterfront towns, overhung by gabled roofs that were old when they
were hanging witches in Salem; dark musty alleys where black cats
and other things might steal at night. Witchcraft always meant the
old towns of New England, to me&mdash;but all this is more terrible
than any New England legend&mdash;these somber pines, old deserted
houses, lost plantations, mysterious black people, old tales of
madness and horror&mdash;God, what frightful, ancient terrors there
are on this continent fools call 'young'!"</p>

<p>"Here's old Jacob's hut," announced Buckner, bringing the
automobile to a halt.</p>

<p>Griswell saw a clearing and a small cabin squatting under the
shadows of the huge trees. The pines gave way to oaks and
cypresses, bearded with gray trailing moss, and behind the cabin
lay the edge of a swamp that ran away under the dimness of the
trees, choked with rank vegetation. A thin wisp of blue smoke
curled up from the stick-and-mud chimney.</p>

<p>He followed Buckner to the tiny stoop, where the sheriff pushed
open the leather-hinged door and strode in. Griswell blinked in the
comparative dimness of the interior. A single small window let in a
little daylight. An old Negro crouched beside the hearth, watching
a pot stew over the open fire. He looked up as they entered, but
did not rise. He seemed incredibly old. His face was a mass of
wrinkles, and his eyes, dark and vital, were filmed momentarily at
times as if his mind wandered.</p>

<p>Buckner motioned Griswell to sit down in a string-bottomed
chair, and himself took a rudely-made bench near the hearth, facing
the old man.</p>

<p>"Jacob," he said bluntly, "the time's come for you to talk. I
know you know the secret of Blassenville Manor. I've never
questioned you about it, because it wasn't in my line. But a man
was murdered there last night, and this man here may hang for it,
unless you tell me what haunts that old house of the
Blassenvilles."</p>

<p>The old man's eyes gleamed, then grew misty as if clouds of
extreme age drifted across his brittle mind.</p>

<p>"The Blassenvilles," he murmured, and his voice was mellow and
rich, his speech not the patois of the piny woods darky. "They were
proud people, sirs&mdash;proud and cruel. Some died in the war,
some were killed in duels&mdash;the menfolks, sirs. Some died in
the Manor&mdash;the old Manor&mdash;" His voice trailed off into
unintelligible mumblings.</p>

<p>"What of the Manor?" asked Buckner patiently.</p>

<p>"Miss Celia was the proudest of them all," the old man muttered.
"The proudest and the cruelest. The black people hated her; Joan
most of all. Joan had white blood in her, and she was proud, too.
Miss Celia whipped her like a slave."</p>

<p>"What is the secret of Blassenville Manor?" persisted
Buckner.</p>

<p>The film faded from the old man's eyes; they were dark as
moonlit wells.</p>

<p>"What secret, sir? I do not understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do. For years that old house has stood there with its
mystery. You know the key to its riddle."</p>

<p>The old man stirred the stew. He seemed perfectly rational
now.</p>

<p>"Sir, life is sweet, even to an old black man."</p>

<p>"You mean somebody would kill you if you told me?"</p>

<p>But the old man was mumbling again, his eyes clouded.</p>

<p>"Not somebody. No human. No human being. The black gods of the
swamps. My secret is inviolate, guarded by the Big Serpent, the god
above all gods. He would send a little brother to kiss me with his
cold lips&mdash;a little brother with a white crescent moon on his
head. I sold my soul to the Big Serpent when he made me maker of
<i>zuvembies</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Buckner stiffened.</p>

<p>"I heard that word once before," he said softly, "from the lips
of a dying black man, when I was a child. What does it mean?"</p>

<p>Fear filled the eyes of old Jacob.</p>

<p>"What have I said? No&mdash;no! I said nothing."</p>

<p>"<i>Zuvembies</i>," prompted Buckner.</p>

<p>"<i>Zuvembies</i>," mechanically repeated the old man, his eyes
vacant. "A <i>zuvembie</i> was once a woman&mdash;on the Slave
Coast they know of them. The drums that whisper by night in the
hills of Haiti tell of them. The makers of <i>zuvembies</i> are
honored of the people of Damballah. It is death to speak of it to a
white man&mdash;it is one of the Snake God's forbidden
secrets."</p>

<p>"You speak of the <i>zuvembies</i>," said Buckner softly.</p>

<p>"I must not speak of it," mumbled the old man, and Griswell
realized that he was thinking aloud, too far gone in his dotage to
be aware that he was speaking at all. "No white man must know that
I danced in the Black Ceremony of the voodoo, and was made a maker
of <i>zombies</i> and <i>zuvembies</i>. The Big Snake punishes
loose tongues with death."</p>

<p>"A <i>zuvembie</i> is a woman?" prompted Buckner.</p>

<p>"<i>Was</i> a woman," the old Negro muttered. "<i>She</i> knew I
was a maker of <i>zuvembies</i>&mdash;she came and stood in my hut
and asked for the awful brew&mdash;the brew of ground snake-bones,
and the blood of vampire bats, and the dew from a nighthawk's
wings, and other elements unnamable. She had danced in the Black
Ceremony&mdash;she was ripe to become a <i>zuvembie</i>&mdash;the
Black Brew was all that was needed&mdash;the other was
beautiful&mdash;I could not refuse her."</p>

<p>"Who?" demanded Buckner tensely, but the old man's head was sunk
on his withered breast, and he did not reply. He seemed to slumber
as he sat. Buckner shook him. "You gave a brew to make a woman a
<i>zuvembie</i>&mdash;what is a zuvembie?"</p>

<p>The old man stirred resentfully and muttered drowsily.</p>

<p>"A <i>zuvembie</i> is no longer human. It knows neither
relatives nor friends. It is one with the people of the Black
World. It commands the natural demons&mdash;owls, bats, snakes and
werewolves, and can fetch darkness to blot out a little light. It
can be slain by lead or steel, but unless it is slain thus, it
lives for ever, and it eats no such food as humans eat. It dwells
like a bat in a cave or an old house. Time means naught to the
<i>zuvembie</i>; an hour, a day, a year, all is one. It cannot
speak human words, nor think as a human thinks, but it can
hypnotize the living by the sound of its voice, and when it slays a
man, it can command his lifeless body until the flesh is cold. As
long as the blood flows, the corpse is its slave. Its pleasure lies
in the slaughter of human beings."</p>

<p>"And why should one become a zuvembie?" asked Buckner
softly.</p>

<p>"Hate," whispered the old man. "Hate! Revenge!"</p>

<p>"Was her name Joan?" murmured Buckner.</p>

<p>It was as if the name penetrated the fogs of senility that
clouded the voodoo-man's mind. He shook himself and the film faded
from his eyes, leaving them hard and gleaming as wet black
marble.</p>

<p>"Joan?" he said slowly. "I have not heard that name for the span
of a generation. I seem to have been sleeping, gentlemen; I do not
remember&mdash;I ask your pardon. Old men fall asleep before the
fire, like old dogs. You asked me of Blassenville Manor? Sir, if I
were to tell you why I cannot answer you, you would deem it mere
superstition. Yet the white man's God be my witness&mdash;"</p>

<p>As he spoke he was reaching across the hearth for a piece of
firewood, groping among the heaps of sticks there. And his voice
broke in a scream, as he jerked back his arm convulsively. And a
horrible, thrashing, trailing <i>thing</i> came with it. Around the
voodoo-man's arm a mottled length of that shape was wrapped, and a
wicked wedge-shaped head struck again in silent fury.</p>

<p>The old man fell on the hearth, screaming, upsetting the
simmering pot and scattering the embers, and then Buckner caught up
a billet of firewood and crushed that flat head. Cursing, he kicked
aside the knotting, twisting trunk, glaring briefly at the mangled
head. Old Jacob had ceased screaming and writhing; he lay still,
staring glassily upward.</p>

<p>"Dead?" whispered Griswell.</p>

<p>"Dead as Judas Iscariot," snapped Buckner, frowning at the
twitching reptile. "That infernal snake crammed enough poison into
his veins to kill a dozen men his age. But I think it was the shock
and fright that killed him."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" asked Griswell, shivering.</p>

<p>"Leave the body on that bunk. Nothin' can hurt it, if we bolt
the door so the wild hogs can't get in, or any cat. We'll carry it
into town tomorrow. We've got work to do tonight. Let's get
goin'."</p>

<p>Griswell shrank from touching the corpse, but he helped Buckner
lift it on the rude bunk, and then stumbled hastily out of the hut.
The sun was hovering above the horizon, visible in dazzling red
flame through the black stems of the trees.</p>

<p>They climbed into the car in silence, and went bumping back
along the stumpy terrain.</p>

<p>"He said the Big Snake would send one of his brothers," muttered
Griswell.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" snorted Buckner. "Snakes like warmth, and that swamp
is full of them. It crawled in and coiled up among that firewood.
Old Jacob disturbed it, and it bit him. Nothin' supernatural about
that." After a short silence he said, in a different voice, "That
was the first time I ever saw a rattler strike without singin'; and
the first time I ever saw a snake <i>with a white crescent moon on
its head.</i>"</p>

<p>They were turning in to the main road before either spoke
again.</p>

<p>"You think that the mulatto Joan has skulked in the house all
these years?" Griswell asked.</p>

<p>"You heard what old Jacob said," answered Buckner grimly. "Time
means nothin' to a <i>zuvembie</i>."</p>

<p>As they made the last turn in the road, Griswell braced himself
against the sight of Blassenville Manor looming black against the
red sunset. When it came into view he bit his lip to keep from
shrieking. The suggestion of cryptic horror came back in all its
power.</p>

<p>"Look!" he whispered from dry lips as they came to a halt beside
the road. Buckner grunted.</p>

<p>From the balustrades of the gallery rose a whirling cloud of
pigeons that swept away into the sunset, black against the lurid
glare.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="pigeons3" name="pigeons3"></a>3. THE CALL OF
<i>ZUVEMBIE</i></h2>

<p>Both men sat rigid for a few moments after the pigeons had
flown.</p>

<p>"Well, I've seen them at last," muttered Buckner.</p>

<p>"Only the doomed see them perhaps," whispered Griswell. "That
tramp saw them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see," returned the Southerner tranquilly, as he
climbed out of the car, but Griswell noticed him unconsciously
hitch forward his scabbarded gun.</p>

<p>The oaken door sagged on broken hinges. Their feet echoed on the
broken brick walk. The blind windows reflected the sunset in sheets
of flame. As they came into the broad hall Griswell saw the string
of black marks that ran across the floor and into the chamber,
marking the path of a dead man.</p>

<p>Buckner had brought blankets out of the automobile. He spread
them before the fireplace.</p>

<p>"I'll lie next to the door," he said. "You lie where you did
last night."</p>

<p>"Shall we light a fire in the grate?" asked Griswell, dreading
the thought of the blackness that would cloak the woods when the
brief twilight had died.</p>

<p>"No. You've got a flashlight and so have I. We'll lie here in
the dark and see what happens. Can you use that gun I gave
you?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. I never fired a revolver, but I know how it's
done."</p>

<p>"Well, leave the shootin' to me, if possible." The sheriff
seated himself cross-legged on his blankets and emptied the
cylinder of his big blue Colt, inspecting each cartridge with a
critical eye before he replaced it.</p>

<p>Griswell prowled nervously back and forth, begrudging the slow
fading of the light as a miser begrudges the waning of his gold. He
leaned with one hand against the mantelpiece, staring down into the
dust-covered ashes. The fire that produced those ashes must have
been built by Elizabeth Blassenville, more than forty years before.
The thought was depressing. Idly he stirred the dusty ashes with
his toe. Something came to view among the charred debris&mdash;a
bit of paper, stained and yellowed. Still idly he bent and drew it
out of the ashes. It was a note-book with moldering cardboard
backs.</p>

<p>"What have you found?" asked Buckner, squinting down the
gleaming barrel of his gun.</p>

<p>"Nothing but an old note-book. Looks like a diary. The pages are
covered with writing&mdash;but the ink is so faded, and the paper
is in such a state of decay that I can't tell much about it. How do
you suppose it came in the fireplace, without being burned up?"</p>

<p>"Thrown in long after the fire was out," surmised Buckner.
"Probably found and tossed in the fireplace by somebody who was in
here stealin' furniture. Likely somebody who couldn't read."</p>

<p>Griswell fluttered the crumbling leaves listlessly, straining
his eyes in the fading light over the yellowed scrawls. Then he
stiffened.</p>

<p>"Here's an entry that's legible! Listen!" He read:</p>

<p class="letter">"'I know someone is in the house besides myself.
I can hear someone prowling about at night when the sun has set and
the pines are black outside. Often in the night I hear <b>it</b>
fumbling at my door. <i>Who</i> is it? Is it one of my sisters? Is
it Aunt Celia? If it is either of these, why does she steal so
subtly about the house? Why does she tug at my door, and glide away
when I call to her? Shall I open the door and go out to her? No,
no! I dare not! I am afraid. Oh God, what shall I do? I dare not
stay here&mdash;but where am I to go?'"</p>

<p>"By God!" ejaculated Buckner. "That must be Elizabeth
Blassenville's diary! Go on!"</p>

<p>"I can't make out the rest of the page," answered Griswell. "But
a few pages further on I can make out some lines." He read:</p>

<p class="letter">"'Why did the Negroes all run away when Aunt
Celia disappeared? My sisters are dead. I know they are dead. I
seem to sense that they died horribly, in fear and agony. But why?
<b>Why?</b> If someone murdered Aunt Celia, why should that person
murder my poor sisters? They were always kind to the black people.
Joan&mdash;'"</p>

<p>He paused, scowling futilely.</p>

<p>"A piece of the page is torn out. Here's another entry under
another date&mdash;at least I judge it's a date; I can't make it
out for sure.</p>

<p class="letter">"'&mdash;the awful thing that the old Negress
hinted at? She named Jacob Blount, and Joan, but she would not
speak plainly; perhaps she feared to&mdash;' Part of it gone here;
then: 'No, no! How can it be? <b>She</b> is dead&mdash;or gone
away. Yet&mdash;she was born and raised in the West Indies, and
from hints she let fall in the past, I know she delved into the
mysteries of the voodoo. I believe she even danced in one of their
horrible ceremonies&mdash;how could she have been such a beast? And
this&mdash;this horror. God, can such things be? I know not what to
think. If it is <b>she</b> who roams the house at night, who
fumbles at my door, who <b>whistles</b> so weirdly and
sweetly&mdash;no, no, I must be going mad. If I stay here alone I
shall die as hideously as my sisters must have died. Of that I am
convinced.'"</p>

<p>The incoherent chronicle ended as abruptly as it had begun.
Griswell was so engrossed in deciphering the scraps that he was not
aware that darkness had stolen upon them, hardly aware that Buckner
was holding his electric torch for him to read by. Waking from his
abstraction he started and darted a quick glance at the black
hallway.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"What I've suspected all the time," answered Buckner. "That
mulatto maid Joan turned <i>zuvembie</i> to avenge herself on Miss
Celia. Probably hated the whole family as much as she did her
mistress. She'd taken part in voodoo ceremonies on her native
island until she was 'ripe,' as old Jacob said. All she needed was
the Black Brew&mdash;he supplied that. She killed Miss Celia and
the three older girls, and would have gotten Elizabeth but for
chance. She's been lurkin' in this old house all these years, like
a snake in a ruin."</p>

<p>"But why should she murder a stranger?"</p>

<p>"You heard what old Jacob said," reminded Buckner. "A
<i>zuvembie</i> finds satisfaction in the slaughter of humans. She
called Branner up the stair and split his head and stuck the
hatchet in his hand, and sent him downstairs to murder you. No
court will ever believe that, but if we can produce her body, that
will be evidence enough to prove your innocence. My word will be
taken, that she murdered Branner. Jacob said a <i>zuvembie</i>
could be killed... in reporting this affair I don't have to be too
accurate in detail."</p>

<p>"She came and peered over the balustrade of the stair at us,"
muttered Griswell. "But why didn't we find her tracks on the
stair?"</p>

<p>"Maybe you dreamed it. Maybe a <i>zuvembie</i> can project her
spirit&mdash;hell! why try to rationalize something that's outside
the bounds of rationality? Let's begin our watch."</p>

<p>"Don't turn out the light!" exclaimed Griswell involuntarily.
Then he added: "Of course. Turn it out. We must be in the dark
as"&mdash;he gagged a bit&mdash;"as Branner and I were."</p>

<p>But fear like a physical sickness assailed him when the room was
plunged in darkness. He lay trembling and his heart beat so heavily
he felt as if he would suffocate.</p>

<p>"The West Indies must be the plague spot of the world," muttered
Buckner, a blur on his blankets. "I've heard of <i>zombies</i>.
Never knew before what a <i>zuvembie</i> was. Evidently some drug
concocted by the voodoo-men to induce madness in women. That
doesn't explain the other things, though: the hypnotic powers, the
abnormal longevity, the ability to control corpses&mdash;no, a
<i>zuvembie</i> can't be merely a mad-woman. It's a monster,
something more and less than a human being, created by the magic
that spawns in black swamps and jungles&mdash;well, we'll see."</p>

<p>His voice ceased, and in the silence Griswell heard the pounding
of his own heart. Outside in the black woods a wolf howled eerily,
and owls hooted. Then silence fell again like a black fog.</p>

<p>Griswell forced himself to lie still on his blankets. Time
seemed at a standstill. He felt as if he were choking. The suspense
was growing unendurable; the effort he made to control his
crumbling nerves bathed his limbs in sweat. He clenched his teeth
until his jaws ached and almost locked, and the nails of his
fingers bit deeply into his palms.</p>

<p>He did not know what he was expecting. The fiend would strike
again&mdash;but how? Would it be a horrible, sweet whistling, bare
feet stealing down the creaking steps, or a sudden hatchet-stroke
in the dark? Would it choose him or Buckner? <i>Was Buckner already
dead?</i> He could see nothing in the blackness, but he heard the
man's steady breathing. The Southerner must have nerves of steel.
Or was that Buckner breathing beside him, separated by a narrow
strip of darkness? Had the fiend already struck in silence, and
taken the sheriff's place, there to lie in ghoulish glee until it
was ready to strike?&mdash;a thousand hideous fancies assailed
Griswell tooth and claw.</p>

<p>He began to feel that he would go mad if he did not leap to his
feet, screaming, and burst frenziedly out of that accursed
house&mdash;not even the fear of the gallows could keep him lying
there in the darkness any longer&mdash;the rhythm of Buckner's
breathing was suddenly broken, and Griswell felt as if a bucket of
ice-water had been poured over him. From somewhere above them rose
a sound of weird, sweet whistling...</p>

<p>Griswell's control snapped, plunging his brain into darkness
deeper than the physical blackness which engulfed him. There was a
period of absolute blankness, in which a realization of
<i>motion</i> was his first sensation of awakening consciousness.
He was running, madly, stumbling over an incredibly rough road. All
was darkness about him, and he ran blindly. Vaguely he realized
that he must have bolted from the house, and fled for perhaps miles
before his overwrought brain began to function. He did not care;
dying on the gallows for a murder he never committed did not
terrify him half as much as the thought of returning to that house
of horror. He was overpowered by the urge to
run&mdash;run&mdash;run as he was running now, blindly, until he
reached the end of his endurance. The mist had not yet fully lifted
from his brain, but he was aware of a dull wonder that he could not
see the stars through the black branches. He wished vaguely that he
could see where he was going. He believed he must be climbing a
hill, and that was strange, for he knew there were no hills within
miles of the Manor. Then above and ahead of him a dim glow
began.</p>

<p>He scrambled toward it, over ledge-like projections that were
more and more taking on a disquieting symmetry. Then he was
horror-stricken to realize that a sound was impacting on his
ears&mdash;<i>a weird mocking whistle</i>. The sound swept the
mists away. Why, what was this? <i>Where was he?</i> Awakening and
realization came like the stunning stroke of a butcher's maul. He
was not fleeing along a road, or climbing a hill; he was mounting a
stair. He was still in Blassenville Manor! <i>And he was climbing
the stair!</i></p>

<p>An inhuman scream burst from his lips. Above it the mad
whistling rose in a ghoulish piping of demoniac triumph. He tried
to stop&mdash;to turn back&mdash;even to fling himself over the
balustrade. His shrieking rang unbearably in his own ears. But his
will-power was shattered to bits. It did not exist. He had no will.
He had dropped his flashlight, and he had forgotten the gun in his
pocket. He could not command his own body. His legs, moving
stiffly, worked like pieces of mechanism detached from his brain,
obeying an outside will. Clumping methodically they carried him
shrieking up the stair toward the witch-fire glow shimmering above
him.</p>

<p>"Buckner!" he screamed. "Buckner! Help, for God's sake!"</p>

<p>His voice strangled in his throat. He had reached the upper
landing. He was tottering down the hallway. The whistling sank and
ceased, but its impulsion still drove him on. He could not see from
what source the dim glow came. It seemed to emanate from no central
focus. But he saw a vague figure shambling toward him. It looked
like a woman, but no human woman ever walked with that skulking
gait, and no human woman ever had that face of horror, that leering
yellow blur of lunacy&mdash;he tried to scream at the sight of that
face, at the glint of keen steel in the uplifted claw-like
hand&mdash;but his tongue was frozen.</p>

<p>Then something crashed deafeningly behind him; the shadows were
split by a tongue of flame which lit a hideous figure falling
backward. Hard on the heels of the report rang an inhuman
squawk.</p>

<p>In the darkness that followed the flash Griswell fell to his
knees and covered his face with his hands. He did not hear
Buckner's voice. The Southerner's hand on his shoulder shook him
out of his swoon.</p>

<p>A light in his eyes blinded him. He blinked, shaded his eyes,
looked up into Buckner's face, bending at the rim of the circle of
light. The sheriff was pale.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt? God, man, are you hurt? There's a butcher knife
there on the floor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not hurt," mumbled Griswell. "You fired just in
time&mdash;the fiend! Where is it? Where did it go?"</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>Somewhere in the house there sounded a sickening flopping and
flapping as of something that thrashed and struggled in its death
convulsions.</p>

<p>"Jacob was right," said Buckner grimly. "Lead can kill them. I
hit her, all right. Didn't dare use my flashlight, but there was
enough light. When that whistlin' started you almost walked over me
gettin' out. I knew you were hypnotized, or whatever it is. I
followed you up the stairs. I was right behind you, but crouchin'
low so she wouldn't see me, and maybe get away again. I almost
waited too long before I fired&mdash;but the sight of her almost
paralyzed me. Look!"</p>

<p>He flashed his light down the hall, and now it shone bright and
clear. And it shone on an aperture gaping in the wall where no door
had showed before.</p>

<p>"The secret panel Miss Elizabeth found!" Buckner snapped. "Come
on!"</p>

<p>He ran across the hallway and Griswell followed him dazedly. The
flopping and thrashing came from beyond that mysterious door, and
now the sounds had ceased.</p>

<p>The light revealed a narrow, tunnel-like corridor that evidently
led through one of the thick walls. Buckner plunged into it without
hesitation.</p>

<p>"Maybe it couldn't think like a human," he muttered, shining his
light ahead of him. "But it had sense enough to erase its tracks
last night so we couldn't trail it to that point in the wall and
maybe find the secret panel. There's a room ahead&mdash;the secret
room of the Blassenvilles!"</p>

<p>And Griswell cried out: "My God! It's the windowless chamber I
saw in my dream, with the three bodies hanging&mdash;ahhhhh!"</p>

<p>Buckner's light playing about the circular chamber became
suddenly motionless. In that wide ring of light three figures
appeared, three dried, shriveled, mummy-like shapes, still clad in
the moldering garments of the last century. Their slippers were
clear of the floor as they hung by their withered necks from chains
suspended from the ceiling.</p>

<p>"The three Blassenville sisters!" muttered Buckner. "Miss
Elizabeth wasn't crazy, after all."</p>

<p>"Look!" Griswell could barely make his voice intelligible.
"There&mdash;over there in the corner!"</p>

<p>The light moved, halted.</p>

<p>"Was that thing a woman once?" whispered Griswell. "God, look at
that face, even in death. Look at those claw-like hands, with black
talons like those of a beast. Yes, it was human, though&mdash;even
the rags of an old ballroom gown. Why should a mulatto maid wear
such a dress, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"This has been her lair for over forty years," muttered Buckner,
brooding over the grinning grisly thing sprawling in the corner.
"This clears you, Griswell&mdash;a crazy woman with a
hatchet&mdash;that's all the authorities need to know. God, what a
revenge!&mdash;what a foul revenge! Yet what a bestial nature she
must have had, in the beginnin', to delve into voodoo as she must
have done&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The mulatto woman?" whispered Griswell, dimly sensing a horror
that overshadowed all the rest of the terror.</p>

<p>Buckner shook his head. "We misunderstood old Jacob's
maunderin's, and the things Miss Elizabeth wrote&mdash;<i>she must
have known</i>, but family pride sealed her lips. Griswell, I
understand now; the mulatto woman had her revenge, but not as we'd
supposed. She didn't drink the Black Brew old Jacob fixed for her.
It was for somebody else, to be given secretly in her food, or
coffee, no doubt. Then Joan ran away, leavin' the seeds of the hell
she'd sowed to grow."</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that's not the mulatto woman?" whispered
Griswell.</p>

<p>"When I saw her out there in the hallway I knew she was no
mulatto. And those distorted features still reflect a family
likeness. I've seen her portrait, and I can't be mistaken. There
lies the creature that was once Celia Blassenville."</p>
