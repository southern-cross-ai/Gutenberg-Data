<h2>FOREWORD.</h2>

<p>Canniness grew up during the centuries of Scotland's poverty
when extreme thrift was a necessity. To the present generation it
comes as an inherited gift. In Aberdeen it almost amounts to
genius.</p>

<p>The origin of pawkiness is less obvious, but it can be traced
back to the stern preaching of the seventeenth century, when it was
considered sinful to make a joke consciously, or to laugh at one.
It was obviously dangerous even to see one. Determined to run no
risks our cautious forefathers avoided all appearance of joking,
but developed an earnest truthfulness of speech together with a
self-revealing candour and quaintness of expression which never
deserted them even in the more serious crises of life. This we call
pawkiness.</p>

<p>Take equal quantities of pawkiness and canniness and you have
the recipe for Scottish humour.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>MY CANNY YOUTH.</h2>

<div align="center"><img src=
"1402591h-images/05-My-Canny-Youth.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>Though not an Aberdonian I confess that I have a modicum of
canniness. When a boy, and living at Jedburgh, my brothers and I
were allowed twopence each Saturday to buy ourselves mutton pies.
One Saturday night my father discovered me sitting in a corner of
the parlour absorbed in gloomy meditation, my week-end coppers
still in my hand.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" he asked, "haven't you bought your pie?"</p>

<p>"No!" was my tearful reply, "I've been round all the shops and I
can't make up my mind which has the biggest ones."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch48" id="ch48"></a>THE LONG WAY OUT.</h2>

<p>When Rab Mathieson's wife Janet was given over by the doctor she
called him to her bedside and said: "Rab, I want ye to promise me
just ae thing afore I dee. Promise me!"</p>

<p>"Ye'll hae to tell me what it is or I'll no' promise," said
Rab.</p>

<p>"Weel, it's just this. Ye must gi'e me yer solemn word that
ye'll no' put anither in my place."</p>

<p>"Na! Na! I'll promise naething o' the kind," said Rab
emphatically; "I've been sae weel content wi' my first bargain in
wives that it's only reasonable I should repeat the order."</p>

<p>"If ye dare to tak' anither wife, Rab," declared Janet raising
herself in bed excitedly, "I'll scratch mysel' oot o' the grave and
haunt you and her till ye dee."</p>

<p>A year after Janet's death, Rab took a second wife.</p>

<p>On the wedding day a friend who was acquainted with the
circumstances said to him:</p>

<p>"Man, are ye no feart?"</p>

<p>"No' a bit!" declared Rab: "Ye see I took precautions. She'll
hae to scratch hersel' to Australia afore she bothers me again: I
buried her face doon."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch45" id="ch45"></a>TAKING NO RISKS.</h2>

<p>A canny Scot found himself beleaguered in New York during the
Great War, his wife being still in Aberdeenshire.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go home to the wife, Sandy?" asked a friendly
American.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Sandy indignantly, "wad ye hae me riskin' my
life crossin' the Atlantic Ocean wi' a' thae murderin' submarines
aboot? Na! Na! I've sent for the wife tae come to me."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>A BONNIE BAIRN.</h2>

<div align="center"><img src=
"1402591h-images/07-A-Bonnie-Bairn.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>The story goes that when I was born a sour old maid called to
see the new baby. At sight of my little red face she involuntarily
ejaculated: "Eh me! Aweel-a-wat, he's no' bonnie!" Then observing
my mother's resentful looks she added, "But they that the bonniest
bairns generally grow up to be the ugliest men and women."</p>

<p>Upon which my eldest brother aged six looked up innocently at
her wrinkled face and remarked: "You must have been a very bonnie
bairn, Miss Pringle."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>HOW TO DISPERSE A CROWD.</h2>

<p>A Scotsman wishing to join the police force in Birmingham, was
asked by the Inspector: "What would you do to disperse a
crowd?"</p>

<p>"Weel," replied the Scot, "I dinna ken what ye wad dae in
Birmingham, but if I were in Aberdeen, I'd pass round the hat."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch38" id="ch38"></a>PLAYING THE GAME.</h2>

<p>At a recent International Football Match between Scotland and
England, an Englishman had a bottle of whisky, while a Scotsman,
who stood next to him, had none. The weather was hot and Sandy was
dry.</p>

<p>"If ye were a sport ye'd pass the bottle," said the latter.</p>

<p>"There's only a mouthful left," replied the other.</p>

<p>"Ay!" agreed Sandy, "I see it's just a dribble. If ye were a
player I'd say ye were a champion 'dribbler,' but ye're no good at
'passin'."</p>

<p>"Pass? No fear! Just you watch me 'shoot!'" And the Englishmen
put the bottle to his mouth.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Sandy. "Ye should ken that it scores against ye to
shoot into yer ain goal."</p>

<p>Sandy got his drink.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CUPBOARD LOVE.</h2>

<p>The following conversation was overheard by some mean spy at a
Glasgow "close mouth."</p>

<p>"Jean, tell me wha's bonnie wee doo (turtle dove) are ye?"</p>

<p>"Uch awa'! Ye ken fine yersel', Jock."</p>

<p>"Then ye love me, Jean?"</p>

<p>"Ay, indeed! Twa pies last nicht and twa the nicht&mdash;wha
wadna, Jock?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>"GUILTY" AS CHARGED.</h2>

<div align="center"><img src=
"1402591h-images/09-Guilty-As-Charged.jpg" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>A Scotsman and a Jew were brought up before a magistrate charged
with being drunk and incapable. Both pleaded "Not Guilty."</p>

<p>"What reason have you, constable, for thinking that the accused
were drunk?" asked the magistrate.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied the policeman, "Macdonald was throwing his
money about."</p>

<p>"Um! yes&mdash;I see! But what about the other prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Isaacs was throwing it back at him."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>AYE A SOMETHING!</h2>

<p>One of the best Glasgow stories concerns two wives who were
heard gossiping on a stairhead.</p>

<p>"So your Jean is married at last," said one. "And how is she
gettin' on?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's getting on fine&mdash;just fine!" replied her
neighbour. "There's only wan thing the matter. She just canna bide
her man&mdash;but there's aye a something!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>"DAMN THAT FLY!"</h2>

<p>One hot Sunday a Highland minister opened his sermon thus:</p>

<p>"Ass I came into ta pulpit this mornin' I heard a member of my
congregation, who is sitting toon there in the front pew, say to a
poor, wee, small, innocent fly that wass annoying him, 'Damn that
fly!' Now I know, my brethern, that it iss a fery warrum tay, put
we must pe gentle with ta poor, wee, small, innocent flies that
alight on our hot faces. We ought to put up a hand slowly and say,
'Co away little fly?" chust prushing it aside. Now there is a fly
that has lighted on my own face chust now. I do not get angry with
it and say 'Damn that fly!' No, my brethren, I chust raise my hand
gently to my face and say&mdash;"Damn! <i>It's a wasp!</i>"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>A DEATH CERTIFICATE.</h2>

<p>"To think o't, puir Bob M'Craw was fishin', and fell in the
river and was drooned."</p>

<p>"Are you sure he's deid?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's deid richt enough. They got him oot, and went through
his pockets, and he didna move."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch59" id="ch59"></a>WILD OATS.</h2>

<div align="center"><img src="1402591h-images/11-Wild-Oats.jpg"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>The sowing of wild oats generally takes the form of prodigal
expenditure and even the Canny Scot is guilty at times of a lapse
into extravagance.</p>

<p>It must have been an Aberdeen child who entered a little
confectioner's shop, threw down a halfpenny on the counter, and,
with the energy begot of despair sobbed out:</p>

<p>"A farthin's worth o' sweetie scrapins and a farthin' back. I've
quarrelled wi' my mither and I dinna care what I spend."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch57" id="ch57"></a>WHERE'S THE WHIP.</h2>

<p>A Scotsman bought a shilling ticket for a lottery, the first
prize being a Pony and Trap. One night a knock came to the door and
a voice called: "Are ye in, Tam?"</p>

<p>Tam went to the door and saw a village cronie standing there
with a pony and trap.</p>

<p>"Weel, Tam, ye'll be pleased to hear that you've won the first
prize."</p>

<p>Tam scratched his head, walked round and had a good look. "Aye,"
he said, "that's the pony and trap richt enough, but where's the
whip?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>A "DEAD" HEAT.</h2>

<p>Seeing two men bathing on the Aberdeen beach a wealthy
Englishman offered five pounds to the one who could stay longest
under water. They are still searching for the bodies.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>ENCORE.</h2>

<p>The roof of a certain kirk was in need of repairing, but the
leading elder could not be convinced that such was the case. At a
meeting convened to consider the matter a lump of plaster descended
on this elder's head. When he had recovered from the shock he rose
and said:</p>

<p>"I am now convinced that the roof must be redone immediately. In
fact I'll give five pounds mysel!"</p>

<p>Upon which the minister closed his eyes and prayed
fervently:</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, hit him again!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch52" id="ch52"></a>THE VERNACULAR.</h2>

<div align="center"><img src=
"1402591h-images/13-The-Vernacular.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>It was "Glasgow Fair" Saturday. Many rowing boats obstructed the
passage of the Clyde steamers as they entered Rothesay Bay. One in
particular seemed to be in imminent danger of being run down.</p>

<p>The steamer blew its siren, and an excited little girl was heard
exhorting her perspiring father to pull harder at the oars:</p>

<p>"Poo, Paw, poo! Can ye no poo Paw?"</p>

<p>Which being interpreted signifies&mdash;"Pull Daddy pull! Can
you not pull, Daddy."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>A BLACK DAY.</h2>

<p>Mr Harry Lauder (now Sir Harry) once invited me to lunch.
Crossing Oxford Street, London, on our way to his hotel we were
held up amid the busy traffic. Harry gripped my arm and said
earnestly:</p>

<p>"Man, Moffat, if you and me was to get knockit doon thegither it
wad be a black day for Scotland."</p>

<p>During the subsequent lunch Harry related some of his
experiences.</p>

<p>"When I furst landed in America," he said, "I was met by a crood
o' thae reporter men. Yin o' them says to me: 'Well, Harry,' says
he, 'we've had a countryman of yours here doing great business in
the music halls (Here Harry named another Scottish
comedian)&mdash;He made piles of American dollars but he didn't
leave many of them behind him.' 'Weel, I'll leave less,' says I,
and wi' that I telt him yin aboot that same comedian and me. 'I was
livin' up in a wee garret room in Leeverpool, for the nearer the
slates the cheaper the rent ye ken, when wan day my freend
T&mdash;&mdash; climbed the stairs to my room and says he to me,
'Harry, I've jist come for a wee bit consultation aboot how to save
money.' I had been pittin' a bit sang thegither, but I laid my wark
aside and says: 'Weel then, sit doon on the floor, and seein' that
we're auld freends and can talk thegither withoot seein' I'll jist
blaw oot the candle.'"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch41" id="ch41"></a>SHARING EXPENSES.</h2>

<p>An Aberdonian, resident in London, once met a friend from the
Granite City and on learning that he was in need of a square meal
remarked&mdash;"Ye'll just come wi' me. I ken the very place, if
you stand the drinks I'll stand the lunch." It was a free lunch
bar.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>NO ORANGE BLOSSOMS.</h2>

<div align="center"><img src=
"1402591h-images/15-No-Orange-Blossoms.jpg" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>At breakfast in a fashionable boarding-house at Strathpeffer an
affected old maid from the South found a tribute of flowers on her
plate, placed there by her friends in celebration of her birthday.
Pressing them impulsively to her cheek, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"How perfectly charming! All the beautiful flowers come to
me!"</p>

<p>Thereupon an old Scottish lady who sat opposite to her remarked
dryly: "Ay! A' except orange-blossoms."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch47" id="ch47"></a>THE "CHOOCKIE" WAS GOOD.</h2>

<p>Two members of the schoolboard were delegated to inspect a
remote Highland school. They found that the discipline was not all
that it should be, and decided to report accordingly.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster's wife was exceedingly hospitable and provided
an excellent chicken dinner.</p>

<p>On their way home over the hills the following conversation took
place:</p>

<p>FIRST INSPECTOR (doubtfully): "Umphum! Ay! Yes! I doot we will
haf to report against him&mdash;the deecipline wass pad."</p>

<p>SECOND INSPECTOR: "Naw, man, we'll no' report unfavourably.
True, the deecipline wass pad&mdash;but, och! the choockie wass
goot!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>EXTRAVAGANCE.</h2>

<p>An Aberdonian sat at the bedside of his friend who was a patient
in a nursing home.</p>

<p>"Ye seem to be a bit cheerier the day, John," said the
visitor.</p>

<p>"Ay, man, I thocht I was gaun to dee, but the doctor tells me he
can save my life. It's to cost a hunner pounds."</p>

<p>"Eh! that's terrible extravagance! Do ye think it's worth
it?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch60" id="ch60"></a>YANKEE SCOTTISH HUMOUR.</h2>

<p>"Money breeds money," said a New York man to me the other day,
"but the Scotsman who put two dollars into the canary's cage is
still waiting for 'interesting' results."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch35" id="ch35"></a>NO USE FOR GEPGRAPHY.</h2>

<div align="center"><img src=
"1402591h-images/17-No-Use-For-Geography.jpg" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>The lot of the Day School Teacher is not always a happy one and
the question of corporal punishment gives rise to many unpleasant
scenes with irate parents. A mother accompanied her little girl to
school one morning and addressed the teacher thus:</p>

<p>"What richt hae the likes o' you to thresh my wee lassie for no
kennin' her geography? What's geography onyway? I never had nae
geography and I got a man. My sister, Meg, had nae geography and
she got a man; but you!&mdash;ye canna get a man wi' a' yer
geography!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch43" id="ch43"></a>SOMETHING IN HIS HEAD.</h2>

<p>As a concert artist I was present on one occasion at the
"Coachmen's Annual Soiree Concert and Ball" held in St. Andrews'
Hall, Glasgow. What proved to be the speech of the evening was
delivered by a rough-spoken self-made man, then the largest
cab-owner in the city. In the course of his remarks he said:</p>

<p>"Everybody wha wants to get on in this warld has to hae
something in his heid. There's oor chairman, the Lord Provost, his
heid's foo o' politics. Here's my minister sittin' aside me; his
heid's foo o' theology. There's Mr Hunter yonder, his heid's
crammed foo o' electreecity; and as for me mysel', ye a' ken that
my heid's foo o' beasts."</p>

<h2><a name="ch39" id="ch39"></a>SCOTLAND WON.</h2>

<p>Max O'Rell wrote a book about Scotland and tells this story as
an illustration of Scottish density.</p>

<p>An Englishman living in Fife met the newly appointed Provost of
the town and greeted him by exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Hail, MacBain! Thane of Fife!"</p>

<p>McBain considered a moment, and said, "Ay! that's a' verra weel,
but yer quotation's wrang. It's not MacBain, it's Macbeth."</p>

<p>The Englishman left him in disgust, and meeting another native
said: "Do you know, I met the new provost a minute ago and called
to him, 'Hail! MacBain, Thane of Fife!' And what do you think he
said?"</p>

<p>"I couldna guess."</p>

<p>"He said 'It's not MacBain, it's Macbeth."</p>

<p>The second Fifer considered this and said: "Dae ye ken man, I

<p>"I think Scotland won&mdash;two, nothing."</p>

<br>

<p>The tipping system is a problem which occasions many a heartache
all over the world; but in no place more so than the breast of the
Aberdonian.</p>

<p>An Aberdonian was doing London last year and having been told
that it was customary to leave a tip below the plate in restaurants
invariably left one. The waiter or waitress who cleared his table
always found a little slip on which was written "Back 'Call Boy'
for the Derby." When 'Call Boy' won, an Aberdonian, for the first
time in history, felt that inward glow which comes of lavish
generosity.</p>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>KISSING TIME.</h2>

<p>The captain of the old Clyde steamer <i>The Marquis of Bute</i>
was a breezy old Highlander with a short temper. <i>The
Marquis</i>, crowded with passengers from Dunoon, had just called
in at Kirn one Monday morning. As the gangway was being taken off,
a young man and woman were observed rushing down the pier. The
Captain kindly had the gangway put on again, and the passengers
were preparing to give "the last man aboard" the usual ironic
cheer, when the young man paused to kiss his sweetheart "Good-bye."
This was too much for the worthy captain.</p>

<p>"Throw off that gangway," he shouted. "You can chust
kiss&mdash;kiss&mdash;kiss till I come pack."</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>A SUM IN PROPORTION.</h2>

<p>A canny couple from the North when on a visit to London took a
journey in "The Underground." While descending in the lift the old
man was looking at a notice which read "Spitting strictly
prohibited&mdash;penalty forty shillings." when his wife whispered
to him:</p>

<p>"Eh, John! I think I'm gaen to be sick."</p>

<p>"No' here, woman! no' here!" cried John: "look at the notice! It
costs twa pounds just to spit!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>HOSPITALITY.</h2>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>ABERDEEN ARITHMETIC.</h2>

<p>There is an Aberdonian grocer whose customers can never quite
make up their minds whether he is very cute or only very stupid.
His fellow citizens can quite sympathise with him when he halves a
peppermint lozenge when weighing out a halfpenny-worth of
"sweeties" for a bairn, for they would do it themselves. It is
another matter when it comes to his mental arithmetic. He has been
heard to sum up a cash customer's indebtedness thus:</p>

<p>"Ten and eleven are twenty-one. Two and a penny. Fivepence
change&mdash;thank you!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>FEW ARE CHOSEN.</h2>

<p>The story goes that a drunk fell into an open grave and lay
unconscious till morning. He was awakened by the sound of a trumpet
blown by a rag-and-bottle hawker. Scrambling out of his
resting-place he looked about him, scratched his head in perplexity
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Gosh! this is a puir turn oot for Kirkintilloch."</p>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>NO CANINE ARTISTES.</h2>

<p>On a certain occasion the late Mr Mackenzie Murdoch after a
magnificent display of violin playing received a vociferous encore
which was not confined to hand-clapping. The chairman rose
indignantly and rang his bell for silence.</p>

<p>"Stop that whustlin'," he shouted: "And ye're no' permitted to
kick oor new toon hall tae bits wi' yer muckle feet. If ye wants an
encore I tell ye this: ye'll no' get Mr Murdoch back by whustlin'

<br>

<p>Many stories are told against the pulpit but here is one in
which the pew figures and not to advantage. A Glasgow clergyman who
on his way to the morning service overheard the conversation of
three young men of his congregation. They had consulted their
pockets and found that they had only two half-pennies among
them.</p>

<p>The minister hurried on and waited for them beside the elder at
the plate. As they passed in to the kirk, he said:</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>A TREAT IN STORE.</h2>

<p>A newcomer had just settled in a small Ayrshire town. Determined

new friend responded with:</p>

<p>"Man, I'm real glad ye've come to settle among us. I'll maybe be

<h2><a name="ch42" id="ch42"></a>SOLOMON UP-TO-DATE.</h2>

<p>The greatest "original" I have ever run across was my fellow
passenger on a railway journey from Glasgow to Paisley. He managed
to give the wisdom of Solomon a modern twist that made it his
own.</p>

<p>"I am prood to be a member o' the Established Kirk o' Scotland,"
he told me. "The Free Kirk has nae richt to exist. It was
prophetically condemned by scripture three thoosand years ago."</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Easy enough," he replied. "Did not Solomon say 'let all thy
ways be <i>established</i>'?"</p>

<p>"Are you married?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Na! na! theres nae wife." He produced a large door key from his
pocket. "There's my big key! I can gang hame when I like&mdash;the
nicht, the morn's mornin', next week if I like. Naebody to say
'Where goest thou?' But look at my neebours!&mdash;everywhere the
wife says 'Go!' and he goeth, 'haud (hold) the bairn' and he
haudeth it."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "Solomon says 'whoso findeth a wife findeth a

<p>"Ay!" he agreed, a pawkie twinkle coming into his eyes. "But I'm

<p>A village blacksmith named Andra Gow was so henpecked at home
that he spent his evenings at the public house. His wife's brother
determined to make an effort to cure Andra of his drinking habits.
One Saturday night the blacksmith was staggering and singing along
the road when a dark figure emerged from the kirkyard gate and
addressed him in hollow tones: "Andra Gow, I come to warn you that
drink is sending you straight to Hell."</p>

<p>"And wha may you be?" asked Andra.</p>

<p>"I am the Devil!" replied the black figure.</p>

<p>"I was thinking that," said Andra dryly, "Come and have a drink.
I'm married to yer sister."</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>AN ABERDEEN WAIL.</h2>

<p>At a certain social party the daughter of the house had obliged
the guests by singing the Jacobite song "Wae's me for Prince
Charlie."</p>

<p>An Englishman being present the proud hostess asked him how he
liked it.</p>

<p>"Oh, very much," he said. "So pathetic don't you know. I suppose
it's a sort of Aberdeen wail? But, after all, you know, what's
fourpence?"</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" asked the surprised hostess.</p>

<p>"Well, didn't every verse finish up with 'Where's my fourpence,
Charlie'?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch55" id="ch55"></a>VAIN REGRETS.</h2>

<p>As my native town might as well get her share of the cheap
publicity, I have no scruples in telling this one. I recently
delivered a lecture from the pulpit of a fashionable West-end
church in Glasgow. In the course of my address I said:</p>

<p>"At the performances of 'Bunty Pulls the Strings' our audiences,
even in Scotland, laugh when they see the country folks of sixty
years ago putting half-pennies and pennies in the kirk plate. Yet a
moment's thought would have shown them that owing to the tremendous
depreciation in the purchasing power of money our grandfathers were
really contributing sums equal to threepence and sixpence in our
present money."</p>

<p>When I entered the vestry after the service I discovered an
elder seated at a table busily counting a mountain of coppers into
shilling heaps. He looked sadly at me and said:</p>

<p>"Eh, man! What a pity we took the collection before the
sermon."</p>

<p>To a person of thrifty habits the spending of money becomes in
course of time a matter of mental agony. Two Scotsmen came to
London with a cheap excursion and had to spend a night in a hotel.
Waking at two in the morning one of them found the other sitting on
a chair by his bed.</p>

<p>"What are ye sittin' there for, Donald? Can ye no' get in tae

<p>"Gee-whiz! You call that a river? You should see our

<p>The Scotsman in general is credited with a more than ordinary
frugality but on occasion he is guilty of carrying the virtue to
excess.</p>

<p>An Aberdonian sat on his bed one Sunday morning solemnly
contemplating some money which he had taken from the pocket of his
week-day trousers.</p>

<p>"Let me see," he said to himself, "fan I went oot on the spree

<p>A member of a country kirk had been absent for two weeks on
holiday. On his return he asked the beadle if they had got any
further towards appointing a minister.</p>

<p>"Naw, mun!" replied the beadle: "we've had twa student chiels
tryin' their hauns. The first was a big man and I'd hae been vexed
if he'd got the kirk. Fortunately he closed the Bible wi' sic a
bang that they said he was wantin' in reverence. The second was a

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>HE LEFT THEM TO IT.</h2>

<p>A Canadian farmer of Scottish extraction kept up the religious
traditions of his race by reading each morning to his family and
his field workers a consecutive chapter of the Bible. One fine day
in the harvesting season, when time was precious, he struck the
sixth chapter of 1st Chronicles, which consists of eighty-one
verses of genealogical names. He droned on till he came
to:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And Shallum begat Hilkiah and Hillkiah begat Azariah, and
Azariah begat Seraiah, and Seraiah begat Jehozadak."</p>

<p>There he paused and looked over the leaf.</p>

<p>One wet and stormy day an Edinburgh cabby, being dissatisfied
with the fare offered him by a gentleman in kilts, was proceeding

<p>A bride in the northern city received from the best man the
present of an umbrella. As she did not care for the handle she
decided to have the umbrella changed for one of the same value, but
more to her taste. Without consulting the giver she personally
approached the Union Street firm whose name was on the tag.</p>

<p>The shop-keeper was all smiles. "With pleasure, madam," he said,
unwrapping the parcel. But at sight of the umbrella his expression
changed. "I am sorry, madam, but this was not bought in our

dram that he brought a bottle with him to the kirk. One day, while
in the vestry during the long prayer that preceded the collection,
he filled up the bottle with soda water from the minister's siphon.
When he heard the 'Amen' he hurried into the kirk, took the 'ladle'
and began to rax it along the pews. Suddenly the cork came fleein'
out of the bottle with a loud 'pop' and the contents sprayed from
his frock-coat pocket, all over the folk at the back of him. The
minister looked down at him and said: 'Ay, Donald, I always said
that yer secret sin would find you out. Yer bottle would have
remained quietly in yer pocket if ye hadna helped yersel' so freely
to my soda water.'"</p>
