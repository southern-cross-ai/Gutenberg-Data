<br>
<h3><span class="aa">Exploration and Settlement of the N.W.
Coast</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><span class="aa">When</span> Mr. Padbury first
proposed to effect a settlement upon the scene of Mr. F.
Gregory's discoveries on the North West Coast of this Colony, the
Local Government agreed to furnish him with two persons competent
to survey the coast, endeavor to find the southern entrance to
the DeGrey River, and to further the exploration of the interior.
With that view Messrs. Hunt and Ridley were engaged, the former
as a navigator and draughtsman, and the latter to conduct the
inland exploration. Mr. Hunt accompanied by Mr. Turner sailed in
the cutter <i>Mystery</i> for the DeGrey some time prior to the
departure of the <i>Tien Tsin</i> with the stock, in order to
ascertain whether there was any suitable spot near that river
where the stock could be landed, but failing in that returned to
Nicol Bay and awaited the arrival of the <i>Tien Tsin</i>. We
have been favoured with the Reports Messrs. Hunt and Ridley have
made to the Government of their proceedings. We give those
portions of Mr. Hunt's report, which are of general interest, and
also extract * from that of Mr Ridley, those particulars of the
nature of the country seen, which furnish what may be taken to be
a fair idea of it, as regarding its capabilities for settlement.
At the DeGrey itself no harbor or fair anchorage was found, but
about 35 miles south of it, a very superior one was discovered,
and although no surface water was found along its shores, the
explorers are of opinion it may be obtained by digging, and if
not, a river named the Dugald was found running seven miles to
the E.S.E., which possibly would furnish the necessary element
during a considerable portion of the year. The discovery of
Mangrove Harbor,** which is of easy access, is a most fortunate
circumstance, and on its shores will probably be formed the
future principal township of that portion of the coast. The much
dreaded spinifex proves not to be so great an impediment us was
supposed, and it is not improbable the plant itself may prove to
be worth exportation, possessing a strong fibre similar to hemp,
and of it the natives prepare the string with which they make
their fishing lines and nets.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Here given in full, sourced from another
newspaper.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Shortly afterwards renamed Port Hedland; see
below.]</p>
<blockquote>We commence Mr. Hunt's Journal, with his arrival at
the Turtle Islands, giving each day's proceedings until the
return to Nicol Bay where he was joined by the <i>Tien Tsin</i>,
and we then pass on to the overland journey with Messrs. Nairn
and Ridley from the Harding river to the DeGrey.</blockquote>

<h3><span class="aa">2. Extracts from C. C. Hunt's Journal,
1863</span>.</h3>
<br>
<p class="negindent3"><i>Extracts from a Journal kept by Mr. Hunt
on board the cutter "Mystery," and on the land journey from Tien
Tsin Harbor to the DeGrey River</i>.</p>
<p>April 21.&mdash;Anchored off Little Turtle Island hear the
mouth of the DeGrey. In approaching the island from the eastward
care should he taken, as a considerable reef from S.S.W. to N.W.
with deep water close to the rocks; the island is awash at high
water spring tides. Many turtle near the reef.</p>
<p>22nd.&mdash;Anchored 3 miles off Point Larry, bearing S.E. by
E.; the water from the last anchorage seldom above 1¾ fathoms. At
9 a.m. Mr. Turner and self went towards the river in a boat at
half flood; found the deepest water towards Point Larry side, but
seldom above 8 feet at three-quarter flood; the entrance of the
river consists of a low sandy spit on the east side with
[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] at the back; on the west side the
channel is somewhat deeper near the mangroves; above this the
river trends S.E. by S. with deepest water on the west side with
a bold shore. The current carried us towards Ripon Island at the
rate of four miles an hour near high water spring tides. At 1
p.m. landed, but the country is so level could not see far; where
the river trends to W. there is a fine reach of water with fully
5 fathoms, banks steep and rocky, but to reach this at any time
would be impossible for anything but boats on account of the
numerous shoals and sand spits. I observed what I supposed to be
a native weir stretched right across the river, but I soon
discovered my mistake, for the supposed weir was natives who
rushed towards the bank carrying their nets with them, and were
joined by several others; they all came running along the bank
shouting and yelling, inviting us to land, which I did not deem
it prudent to do, especially as I was doubtful about getting out
of the river that tide; when the natives saw we were returning
they called to their companions and pointed to where they thought
we should stick for the night, but we got out and tracked the
boat over the sand bank; the natives seemed disappointed, but 26
of them continued to follow us; they appeared to be a fine lusty
body of men, carrying no arms, but there were more of them a
quarter of a mile back probably trailing their spears if they
meant mischief; they followed us about four miles to the edge of
the mangroves. Many of the banks in the Inlet were dry at half
ebb and the breakers within a mile of the cutter.</p>
<p>23rd.&mdash;Sailed for Turtle Island to examine the state of
the anchorage; found reef at high water to have little more than
a fathom upon it; the island is little more than a sand heap
covered with coarse grass above the influence of the tide, and
the abode of immense numbers of pelicans and other sea birds,
with whose eggs we could have loaded the boat. On the east side
of the island there is good water, 6 to 10 fathoms within 3
miles; anchored in 6 fathoms, coarse sand, half a mile E. of
reef, island bearing 2 miles W. by S. ½ E. I do not consider it
safe for any vessel to approach nearer than two miles even in the
calmest weather.</p>
<p>24th.&mdash;Examining the coast for the western outlet of the
river; the shore all round the bay from Spit Point to Point Larry
is thickly covered with mangroves with tolerably clear sand hills
at their back. In the afternoon stood along the coast west of
Spit Point, where the mangroves cease and the sand hills stand
out to high water mark. No opening to be seen.</p>
<p>25th.&mdash;The breakers extend from Little Turtle Island
W.S.W. for about 7 miles; took an inner passage, and stood in for
what I supposed to be an inlet and anchored in 3½ fathoms one
mile from the shore; started in the boat to examine the place and
found it to be of some consequence, being well adapted for a
harbor for a considerable number of craft, the soundings from the
cutter to the entrance shewing 4 to 11 fathoms. One mile S. by E.
took us into the Inlet and a quarter of a mile S. brought us to
an inner harbor more spacious and safe than the outer one; a
course from this entrance S.E. by S. 1¼ miles and S. by W. half a
mile up a creek took us to the main land where the creek trended
to the E. and narrow; we found good landing free of mangroves,
walking a few hundred yards south of the head of the creek, the
country as far as we could see appeared to be an immense spinifex
plain, with a few trees far away to the south; we landed in two
or three other places to find water but without success; if that
could be found, this would be an excellent place to land stock
in, well sheltered from every wind and ample water for a vessel
of 500 tons, although the entrance is narrow it has good
soundings. It is in Lat. 20deg. 19min. S., Long. 118deg. 30min.
E., bottom sand and mud.</p>
<p>26th.&mdash;Coasting to westward towards Cape Thouin within
two miles of the land; numerous mangroves for a few miles E. of
the Cape, but too shallow to approach with the cutter. Most of
the points as headlands along this line of coast seem to be
divided from the mainland by mangrove creeks cutting them off at
the back.</p>
<p>27th.&mdash;Anchored off Forestier Island, 2 miles E. ½ S.
from E. end, in a good anchorage for small vessels, a remarkable
red hill brought to bear S.E. by S. ½ E. will take them through
the passage clear of rocks, and the anchorage is covered from all
winds but N.W.</p>
<p>28th.&mdash;Mr. Turner went in the boat to examine the
mangroves along the shore for an opening that might be the Yule,
but found them to be merely small creeks with shallow water.
Landed on the east end of island to look at the coast line to the
south; found it to be lower than that passed the last two days
and the shore covered with mangroves, apparently backed for two
miles by salt marshes. Forestier is, like Turtle and other small
islands in these seas, sandy and covered with a coarse grass or
spinifex; saw nothing but the track of a native dog&mdash;how did
he get there?</p>
<p>29th.&mdash;Standing for Depuch Island; anchored in 5 fathoms,
quarter of a mile from shore on the S.E. side of the island, safe
from all winds but N. and N.N.W.</p>
<p>30th.&mdash;Landed with Mr. Turner and made an unsuccessful
search for water, the ravines however shewed signs of there
having been a considerable rush down them a few weeks back.
Ascended to the highest point (perhaps 300 feet) composed of
metamorphic sandstone, and had a good view of the main land
beyond the mangroves. This island appears to be of the same
formation as Dampier's Archipelago, except that we found a sort
of coarse lava in the gullies. We noticed some small gum trees
had been cut down a few years ago; rock kangaroo and native dogs
abound.</p>

<br>
<p>May 1.&mdash;Anchored off the watering cove in Nicol
Bay....</p>
<br>
<hr class="tenth">
<br>
<blockquote>From this date to May 17, we make no extracts, the
events having been previously recorded in Captain Jarman's
Journal; heavy rain fell on the 14th and 15th, and a flood came
down on the camp during the night causing great damage to the
stores, spoilt most of their cartridges.</blockquote>
<br>
<hr class="tenth">
<br>
<p>...21st.&mdash;Mr. Ridley, Mr. Nairn, Dugald (the native), and
myself started for the DeGrey; the country passed over is fine
grassy land but very boggy. Camped on the west branch of a stream
I suppose to be the George.</p>

<br>
<p>22nd.&mdash;At 9 miles struck the junction of the George and
Sherlock, at this time running rapidly, but had fallen 8 feet
since the last rains, trending N.N.E. and about 400 yards broad;
9 miles further brought us to the bank of a considerable river
running strongly; the day's march has been over fine grassy level
plains.</p>
<p>23rd.&mdash;Struck along the west bank of the river for about
five miles to find a ford, and travelled over a generally well
grassed country but rather boggy, the soil is alluvial, and also
that seen the previous two days.</p>
<p>24th.&mdash;Sunday.</p>
<p>25th.&mdash;Struck towards a pass through the ranges, trending
S.S.E. from Depuch Island: found the country through the hills
stony and but poorly grassed; at a ¼ past 10 had an extensive
view from a peak 300 feet high to the East northerly over a vast
plain apparently covered with spinifex or scrub; at 3.30 p.m.
crossed a small stream bed trending N.N.W., at 5 p.m. crossed
another and halted at a fine pool 100 yards broad and half a mile
long; country passed over since leaving the range is alluvial
with spinifex and scrub, Lat. 20deg. 35min. S. Long. 118deg.
12min. E.<br></p>

<br>
<p>26th.&mdash;At one mile crossed a small stream; at 3.40 p.m.
crossed a shallow river bed 400 yards wide, running rapidly,
probably the Yule, trending towards Cape Thouin; halted at a
clay-pan with flooded gum trees. Distance 20 miles, almost all
spinifex.</p>
<p>27th.&mdash;Crossed stream bed 300 yards wide, still running
Lat. 20deg. 32min. Long. 118deg. 26min.; passed ridges of white
quartz running for 2½ miles, and halted at Long. 20deg.
26min.</p>
<p>28th.&mdash;At 4 miles struck a small running stream bed and
another shortly after; camped at a salt creek at the back of
Mangrove Harbor,* saw some natives and found some of their
weapons in an old camp.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Shortly afterwards Port Hedland.]</p>
<p>29th.&mdash;Crossed two stream beds before half past 10 a.m.,
and in the afternoon another with water in small pools, and
shortly after the country much improved with good grass and
alluvial flats. Five natives followed on our tracks making signal
fires. Halted Lat. 20deg. 14min. 28sec.</p>
<p>30th.&mdash;Shortly after starting met a party of armed
natives, and the hideous yell they set up made one of the pack
horses bolt, and Dugald went to recover it, upon which the
natives supposing he was running away, came threateningly forward
within 50 yards, when we fired a shot over their heads, which
startled them, and three of us galloping up they scampered off to
the hills holding their shields behind them; at 9.30 a.m. struck
the western branch of the DeGrey near the head of Ripon Island;
fine feed near the banks superior to any I had previously seen;
the river here has a broad sandy dry bed; travelled down the
river and camped on the plains four miles from N.W. corner of
Ripon, country fine open grassy plains.</p>
<p>31st.&mdash;Passed on through sand and hills to Point Larry
and then southwards to west side of Spit Point beyond the
mangroves where we intended to halt, but finding no good water
pushed on 6 miles S.E. and camped at a clay-pan in an open plain
with fine grass.</p>
<p>June 1st.&mdash;Started for what appeared to be a lake but
proved to be only mirage; course S.E. by E. across the plain and
along the bed of the river, at noon halted at a fine pool, deep,
but difficult for stock to get down to the water, quantities of
ducks, abundance of grass; struck the junction of the DeGrey and
the Strelley, and following up the latter passed the north end of
Magnetic Hills, the country again becoming poor and sandy, that
between Points Larry and Spit and Magnetic Hills is of first rate
quality; the deep creek seen by Mr. F. Gregory discharges itself
into salt marshes about 6 miles west of Spit Point.</p>
<p>2nd.&mdash;Course S.S.W.; halted Lat. 20deg. 38min. 31sec.,
Long. 118deg. 56min. 30sec.; country sand hills and scrub and to
S.W. dwarf gums and spinifex.</p>
<p>3rd.&mdash;W.S.W. During the day passed over a broken poor
country, in 3 hours crossed as many stream beds coming from the
range before us; at 10.30 in the hills passed a fine patch of
grass, and several red kangaroo in sight; at 12.45 halted for the
day at a brook in the ranges with good feed and water.</p>
<p>4th.&mdash;W.S.W. In three hours crossed stream bed and at
noon halted at another, the country passed over being very rugged
with small patches of grass and spinifex; afternoon course W. by
S., crossed stream bed 200 yards broad, cleared the hills and
camped in the plains.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;Due West. At 3½ hours crossed the Yule, here a
quarter mile broad with good stream of water; halted at noon on
the west branch.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;W. ½ N. over spinifex plains until 9.45 a.m. then W.
passing over two stream beds with country well grassed.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;Struck our camp of May 24 at a clay-pan where we had
burned a large patch of spinifex; this day we found that on the
burned ground the grass had grown the almost incredible length of
14 inches&mdash;1 inch per day, a sort of flaggy grass much

<blockquote>From this date until the 23rd June, the Journal
contains nothing of general interest; Mr. Nairn then left with
the stock for the DeGrey, and the writer in the <i>Mystery</i>
for the north, and anchored on the 25th in Mangrove Harbor; of
this excellent harbor a perfect survey was made and the outer
portion named Port Headland. On the 28th the cutter anchored at
Turtle Island, and on the 4th July the overland party made their
appearance on the beach at Spit Point, and Mr. Hunt then
accompanied Mr. Nairn back to the stock which was slowly
travelling up. The sheep, and cattle were found south of the
Yule, in good condition, although the ewes had been dropping
lambs ever since leaving the Harding, and all safely reached the
DeGrey on the 28th, locating a little west of Ripon Island. On
the 25th commenced the task of getting the <i>Mystery</i> into
the DeGrey, which was not accomplished until the top of spring
tide on the 29th with no little amount of pulling and heaving,
she was then moored to the bank of Ripon Island and commenced
discharging. All was ready by the 6th August for her going to
sea, but although drawing less than five feet, she did not get
out until the 13th, when she sailed for Fremantle.</blockquote>

<p>The Hon. the Colonial Secretary, Perth.</p>
<br>
<hr class="tenth">
<br>
<p>An exploring party, consisting of five persons, having been
organized by the Local Government and Mr Padbury, for the purpose
of more fully examining portions of the country on the north-west
coast of this Colony, discovered by Mr Gregory in 1861, and
afterwards pushing out either from Nicol Bay or Breaker Inlet in
the direction of, and reaching if possible, the Fitzroy River,
determining thereby the existence or otherwise of a large river,
supposed to empty itself into the sea in the vicinity of Lagrange
or Roebuck Bays, as also of additional pastoral country;
exploring inland as far as time and other circumstances would
permit.</p>
<p>I received instructions from the Colonial Secretary's Office
to proceed to Nicol Bay, for the purpose of taking the command,
and left Fremantle on the 25th of April, in the barque <i>Tien
Tsin</i>, which vessel had been chartered by Mr Padbury, for two
trips, to convey stock either to Nicol Bay, Breaker Inlet, or any
intermediate spot which might be found to afford greater
facilities for landing, watering, and for the stock subsequently
proceeding to any spot that might be fixed upon for the first
station.</p>
<p>Mr Padbury was desirous that this should be on the DeGrey
River if possible. Mr Hunt, who, in addition to myself, proceeded
on account of the Government to form one of my party, and act as
Navigator and Draughtsman, left Fremantle twenty days prior to
the <i>Tien Tsin's</i> departure, in Mr Padbury's cutter
<i>Mystery</i>, for the purpose of examining (as closely as time
and other circumstances would permit) the coast line between
Nicol Bay and Breaker Inlet, with the view of landing stock as
above alluded to, leaving on his way up a letter buried at the
foot of a flag-staff on the south end of Delambre Island, and
with instructions to await the <i>Tien Tsin</i> in Nicol Bay,
should he return to that place before her arrival from
Fremantle.</p>
<p>Mr Padbury accompanied his party (in the <i>Tien Tsin</i>),
and shipped 537 sheep, 11 horses, and 6 working bullocks, the
first voyage, with a party consisting of five whites, and five
aboriginal blacks, four of the latter having been furnished by
the Government from the Penal Establishment at Rottnest
Island.</p>
<p>After a pleasant passage, during which only two sheep were
lost, the <i>Tien Tsin</i> dropped anchor four or five miles
north of Delambre Island, when Captain Jarman, the second officer
of the <i>Tien Tsin</i>, Messrs. Samson, Nairn, a seaman, and
myself, left the vessel in one of her gigs for the nearest part
of the beach, but, owing to the precipitous character of that
part of the Island, were unable to effect a landing, but after
experiencing some little difficulty in getting through the broken
water, and "tracking" the boat for a considerable distance over a
reef, which extends along its south-western side, accomplished
our purpose shortly after daylight near the south end of the
Island, from which the flag-staff planted by the <i>Mystery's</i>
party was plainly visible, about half-a-mile distant.</p>
<p>Upon reaching it, and digging up the bottle containing the
expected letter, we learned that the cutter had returned from
Breaker Inlet two days previously, and had sailed for Hearson's
Cove, near the head of Nicol Bay, (16 or 20 miles), for water,
whither we proceeded, and assisted in completing the watering,
which was not accomplished until shortly after dark, in
consequence of its being low water, and the casks having to be
rolled for more than half-a-mile over mud and sand.</p>
<p>During high water the boat could be taken to within less than
two hundred yards of "Gregory's Well," from which the water was
procured. About eight p.m., we weighed anchor and stood out for
the <i>Tien Tsin</i>, which was reached shortly after midnight,
when Messrs. Hunt and Turner (the latter forming one of Mr
Padbury's party in the <i>Mystery</i>,) accompanied Captain
Jarman on board to report to Mr Padbury the result of the
voyage.</p>
<p>Before proceeding farther it may he as well to remark that the
streams near Hearson's Cove, from which the <i>Dolphin</i>
procured an abundant supply of good water the year before last,
in the month of October, was then (though four months earlier in
the dry season) completely dried up, and the pools in its bed,
about two hundred yards from the beach, quite salt. "Gregory's
Well" contained but a small supply, four hogsheads per day being
all that was then procurable, and before the end of the dry
season would, in all probability, be quite dry. From the fact of
its being close to the beach, but little (if at all) above the
level of the sea, under the narrow belt of hills immediately
behind it, backed by extensive salt marshes, I should fear that a
further sinking through the bed of clay on which the fresh water
rests, would only result in its loss, or the addition of salt;
and for the same reason the almost perfect continuity of the salt
marshes lying immediately behind the very narrow ridge of
sand-hills, which form by far the greatest part of the coast-line
between Breaker Inlet and Tien Tsin Harbour, and through which
various mangrove creeks allow the free ingress and egress of the
waters of the sea, caused by the rise and fall of the tides,
which at the spring amount to eighteen or twenty feet, would, I
consider, preclude the probability of fresh water being
obtainable by means of wells along that portion of the coast on
the sea-side of the marshes. On the southern side of the marshes
and mangrove creeks I did not perceive the slightest indication
of salt either on the land or in the water throughout the country
lying between Tien Tsin Harbour and the DeGrey River, though
pretty well examined throughout the entire length and from
between 10 to 30 miles of the coast inland. The <i>Mystery's</i>
party, on the return from Breaker Inlet above-mentioned, saw and
partially examined a harbour about thirty miles to the westward
of the DeGrey River, which has since been twice visited, and
found to be an excellent anchorage, though not very extensive,
perfectly landlocked, and therefore secure from all winds. It has
been named Port Hedland, after the master of the <i>Mystery</i>,
who first perceived the entrance to it. A practicable route for
driving stock to the DeGrey from thence has also been found and a
good landing place on firm ground above the marshes, to which
spot boats of any size could convey stock during high water. The
weakest of the sheep, when were nearly all in very low condition
when shipped, were now beginning to show the effects of the
confinement, five or six having died during our absence in search
of the cutter, and as the report brought by Messrs. Hunt and
Turner was not considered sufficiently encouraging to induce the
risk of a trial of landing at Breaker Inlet, and nothing being
then known concerning the character of the country in the
vicinity of Port Hedland, the stock were landed at the head of a
bay, immediately on the eastern side of Cape Lambert, during this
6th, 7th, and 8th of May, (the bay having been entered during the
afternoon, of the 5th.). This bay not having a name on the
Admiralty charts was called Tien Tsin Harbour; an island forming
part of its eastern side, Jarman Island, and an inlet near the
south eastern head, Butcher Inlet, after the vessel, captain, and
chief officer respectively. But as this harbour, together with
Port Hedland, Breaker Inlet, and other parts of the coast
visited, will form the subject of a special report from Mr Hunt,
it is unnecessary to say more than that both the harbour and
inlet afford good shelter for vessels, and possess excellent
facilities for landing stock; the latter particularly. Fresh
water can be procured in the sand hills at the head of the bay,
for a month or six weeks after any heavy rains, beyond which time
it becomes brackish, and a much longer continuation of dry
weather renders it unfit even for the use of stock. I do not
think that a permanent supply of fresh water will ever be
obtained at this harbour, except from tanks, the marshes there
not forming any exception to the general rule, but, on the
contrary, remaining rather closer than usual to the beach, and
very extensive. The day after our arrival I walked about 5 miles
inland, accompanied by James McCourt (one of Mr Padbury's party)
and the free native Dugald, and fortunately struck a river, which
was afterwards found to be the principal branch of the Harding,
(not seen by Mr Gregory,) with a fine reach of water upwards of
two miles in length, and fifty or sixty yards wide, and having
abundance of grass on wide alluvial plains on its banks. To this
place the stock were removed on the 9th May, a few weak sheep and
one bullock having died on the way, owing to lowness of condition
and the effects of the brackish water which they had drunk after
landing.</p>

<p>Mr Padbury, wishing to see a little of the country before
returning to Fremantle in the <i>Tien Tsin</i>, Captain Jarman
and himself, with Messrs. Samson, Nairn, and Turner, made a two
days' excursion into the country, while Mr Hunt and myself
examined Butcher Inlet and the mangrove creeks running into it,
with a view to finding a passage to firm ground above the marshes
where goods for the station might be landed, in which however we
were only partially successful. On the morning of the 11th May
the <i>Tien Tsin</i> sailed for Fremantle, for the second lot of
stock, Captain Jarman and Mr Padbury having the previous day
arranged with Mr Nairn, (Mr Padbury's brother-in-law) who had the
direction of Mr Padbury's affairs during his absence, that in the
event of the cutter's leaving the harbour for any purpose before
the <i>Tien Tsin's</i> return, a letter should be left in a
bottle buried on the eastern side of a cask sunk in a small well
in the sand hills, from which the stock had been watered on
landing, though at what distance from it or depth in the ground
(if any such things were particularly specified) I am not
prepared to say, not having been present when the matter was
settled.</p>
<p>During the forenoon of the day of the cutter's departure for
Turtle Island and Spit Point, (23rd June) the same day on which
the stock left for the DeGrey, the master having received the
order from Mr Nairn, I accompanied him to the above-mentioned
cask, and assisted in burying a bottle containing letters for the
<i>Tien Tsin's</i> party, informing them of the plan of
operations proposed by Mr Nairn, occurrences since his departure,
and the place where the cutter would in all probability be found,
viz, Turtle Island or Spit Point.</p>
<p>Mr Nairn, in my presence, simply directed the master to bury
the bottle on the eastern side of the cask, which was done, the
bottle being left in an upright position, touching the eastern
side of the cask, with the cork twelve or fourteen inches beneath
the surface. I have been thus minute in describing my knowledge
of the affair, as the abandonment of the projected expedition to
the southward and eastward of the DeGrey is attributable to the
<i>Tien Tsin's</i> party not being able to find the cutter,
(owing to the non-appearance of the letters when searched for) as
Mr Nairn could spare me only one native, instead of the three men
that Mr Padbury had engaged to furnish, until his party was
reinforced, which he expected it would have been on the arrival
of the <i>Tien Tsin</i>.</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted that an arrangement involving such
serious consequences should not have been committed to paper.</p>
<p>A considerable difference of opinion appears to exist among
those who were present when the matter was discussed, as to what
really was specified and agreed to.</p>
<p>It being proposed in my instructions, that a short trip into
the country should be undertaken during the <i>Tien Tsin's</i>
absence on her second voyage, preparatory to the departure for
the Fitzroy River, I prepared to start for the purpose of
examining the country from Tien Tsin Harbour to the DeGrey River,
between the coast and Mr Gregory's route, which, for a
considerable part of the distance, was thirty or forty miles
inland, but was detained nearly a week in consequence of a heavy
fall of rain on the 13th, 14th and 15th May, which flooded the
rivers and rendered the country exceedingly boggy.</p>
<p>On the 21st I left the camp on the Harding for the DeGrey,
accompanied by Messrs. Hunt and Nairn and the native Dugald,
although the country was still exceedingly soft, and was absent
three weeks. The improvement perceptible in the condition of the
stock during that period was almost incredible; the bullocks,
that five weeks before had been, landed in low condition with
rough coats, were now sleek and shining, and by no means
despicable beef. The sheep had also improved in the same
proportion, proving that the grasses possess the requisite
properties for speedy fattening.</p>
<p>For the first forty-two miles eastward of the camp on the
western Harding I found the country to be an almost unbroken very
open grassy plain of stiff alluvial soil, lying between the first
range of hills and the coast, and extending from their base to
near the edge of the salt marshes, and crossed by the Harding,
George, and Sherlock of Gregory, and also by the main branch of
the Sherlock (missed by Mr Gregory when following down the
western branch to its junction with the George) and by several
other considerable water-courses.</p>
<p>In three of the above-mentioned rivers I believe that
permanent water will be found, but as they were partially in
flood when passed I cannot speak with any degree of
certainty.</p>
<p>The average width of the plain I estimated at ten miles which
Messrs. Hunt and Nairn considered too low. It is bounded on to
the East by a spur of the range which extends nearly to the coast
a little to the eastward of Depuch Island.</p>
<p>To the eastward of this spur, through which there is a good
pass, the main body of the range gradually recedes from the coast
being at the Strelley river (the most eastern part seen) nearly
forty miles distant. Nearly the whole of the large extent of
country lying between, nearly ninety miles in length, and varying
from ten to nearly forty miles in width, may almost be termed one
vast spinifex plain, the soil principally being a coarse sandy
loam, with a few groups and isolated rocky hills, the greatest
number of which lie towards the north-eastern extremity and are
composed of a dark rock of volcanic origin, while those seen near
the south-eastern are principally a very coarse grained light
coloured granite.</p>
<p>Several large water-courses in addition to the Yule river
cross this plain, some of which I have no doubt contain permanent
water if appearances are to be trusted.</p>
<p>Some very tolerable sized patches of much stronger land
bearing excellent grass were also seen (and I have no doubt
others will be found) which will be found exceedingly useful as
shifts for flocks of sheep in the event of the country becoming
stocked.</p>
<p>Should the spinifex land be found capable of producing
sufficient pasture for stock during the short time that the lower
and more clayey grass plains are too wet and soft, (which I feel
confident would he the case, due attention being paid to burning
at the proper times) these patches of grass will be doubly
valuable as affording variety of food, so desirable for all
descriptions of stock.</p>
<p>It would be premature to give a decided opinion as to whether
the climate will affect the growth or fineness of the wool in any
serious degree, until the effect upon the sheep of the hot wet
season has been observed.</p>
<p>Should it not be found particularly injurious, either to the
growth of wool or the general health of the stock, I have no
hesitation in expressing my belief that the grassy country is
capable of carrying a percentage of stock very considerably above
that of the best of the settled districts of the colony, both on
account of the quantity of grass, as also the very much longer
period during which it continues to grow, owing to the dry season
being also the cool season, having its periodical rains and heavy
dews, (if this season can he taken as a fair average). For the
same reason a much smaller quantity of water would suffice for
the use of the stock both on account of the comparatively
trifling evaporation and the much smaller quantity which they
would consume.</p>
<p>Tanks for containing water to any amount could be made in
nearly any of the grassy land for the trouble of digging out, the
soil being admirably adapted for the purpose; a little puddling
might be required in some instances.</p>
<p>Judging of the country described by Mr Gregory which I have
not seen, by that also described by him which I have had an
opportunity of examining, I consider that sufficient pasture has
already been discovered for several hundred thousand sheep, or a
proportionate number of large stock within an available distance
of the coast, and an immense field on the rivers and plains in
its immediate vicinity for the cultivation of cotton, tobacco,
and other inter-tropical productions, with one of more extent and
promising to the northward and eastward still unexplored. The
weather during the whole of my stay (between three and four
months) was with the exception of a few rainy days, almost
invariably delightful, the days cool and refreshing, and the
nights cold and bracing.</p>
<p>Small flies were found rather troublesome, more particularly
very near the coast but mosquitoes not nearly so much so as on
the Swan.</p>
<p>All timber required for substantial buildings would have to be
imported, the only kinds the country produces being the flooded
gum, cajeput, and a species of acacia, all of which are to be
found only in the beds of rivers or other water-courses and on
their immediate banks, and are very inferior. Stone for building
purposes is plentiful wherever there is a hill. For most other
purposes they (the hills) are useless, being invariably barren,
generally abrupt masses of rock, bearing spinifex round their
bases and wherever they are capable of bearing anything.
Limestone was not found by any of the party during my stay,
though sought for. Many (to me) new flowers and plants were seen,
some of which were very beautiful, but the hurried nature of the
trip precluded the possibility of collecting and drying any at
that time.</p>
<p>Kangaroo and all other animals (mice and native dogs excepted)
are very scarce.</p>
<p>The natives do not appear to be more than usually numerous or
hostile, and will not I imagine offer even the usual amount of
obstruction to the settlement of the country.</p>
<p>They are in general above the average stature of those further
south (at least I should so imagine if those I have seen are a
fair sample.)</p>
<p>The principal food of those within reach of the coast appears
to be fish. Nearly every one carries a net, some of which are
funnel shaped and others resembling small stake nets, made of a
two stranded twine which they manufacture from the fibre of some
variety of the spinifex. The knot is the same as in ours, and
they could not be distinguished from each other except on close
inspection. Neither the men or women appear to possess the
smallest article in the shape of covering.</p>
<p>On the 23rd of June, Mr Nairn having decided upon not waiting
any longer for the <i>Tien Tsin</i>, which was now a few days
overdue, started with his party and struck for the DeGrey, which
he did not expect to teach in less than a month or five weeks, as
many of the ewes had yet to lamb.</p>
<p>He directed the matter of the cutter to sail on the same day,
and meet him on an appointed day at Spit Point. Fearing that by
accompanying the land party, I might lose the opportunity of
replying to any letters or instructions received by the <i>Tien
Tsin</i>, I sailed in the cutter, (as did also Mr Hunt,) having
first accompanied the master, and assisted in burying a bottle
containing letters, as before described.</p>
<p>From that date to the 30th of July,* on which day the cutter
commenced discharging cargo in Breaker Inlet, for the use of the
station party on the DeGrey, (the sheep having arrived two days
before, after a very satisfactory journey on which only two lambs
were lost,) we had seen lying alternately at Spit Point, Turtle
Island, and Port Hedland, and twice had communication with the
overland party.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Appendix for this interval in the extract
from Ridley's Journal.]</p>
<p>On the 13th of Aug., the goods were all carted to the station
on the DeGrey, and orders previously received by the master from
Mr Nairn for the cutter to sail with all despatch for Fremantle
for provisions, inferring from the non-appearance of the <i>Tien
Tsin</i> that some accident had occurred, or change in the
arrangements taken place.</p>
<p>As Mr Nairn was unable with any degree of safety, to reduce
his party by furnishing more than one native for the exploring
party, there was no alternative for Mr Hunt and myself to return
in the cutter, or await her return, when it would have been too
late in the season to have attempted a start with the slightest
prospect of success.</p>
<p>We therefore made up our minds to return, not a little
disappointed and disgusted at the turn things had taken. Alter a
rough passage of thirteen days, we arrived at Fremantle on the
15th instant, and were released from our eighty-two days life of
comparative misery having been without meat (one sheep excepted)
unless procured by chance, but rarely able to obtain the means of
washing our faces, while our floating prison swarmed with most
unpleasant passengers, in the shape of bugs and cockroaches; our
only pleasure being derived from the kindness and attention of
the master, Mr P. Hedland, who, together with the crew, every
strove to make matters as smooth as possible under the
circumstances.</p>
<p>For further details of parts of the proceedings described in
the foregoing, I desire to refer His Excellency to my journal of
daily occurrences.</p>

<h3><span class="aa">Appendix.</span></h3>
<br>
<blockquote>The following particulars of the visit of the
<i>Mystery</i> to Port Hedland are extracted from Mr Ridley's
Journal:&mdash;</blockquote>
<p>"June 25.&mdash;At 2.30 dropped anchor in the mangrove inlet
discovered by the <i>Mystery's</i> party during the late trip to
the DeGrey, and which Mr Hunt now named "Port Hedland," after the
master, he having been the first to discern the entrance, which
lies between a small rocky point projecting from a sandy beach on
the western side, and a more sandy point on the eastern, at the
head of a shallow bay or indent; the channel varying from 11 to 4
fathoms for about three quarters of a mile seaward, from which it
gradually shoals to about one and a half fathoms (low water) on
the bank, marked on the Admiralty chart, between one and two
miles from the shore. A few hundred yards inside the
above-mentioned points we passed over a narrow bank, apparently
the bar of the inlet, having about 5 feet of water on it:
immediately inside of which it increased to 6, 7, and 8, fathoms;
the inlet turning to the eastward and opening out into a fine
sheet of water of an oval shape, the longest way being E and W,
with several large mangrove creeks to the Eastward, Southward,
and Westward.</p>
<p>Continued S. of E. for about a mile inside of bar, and dropped
anchor in 3½ fathoms (sand and mud). The western point of
entrance being completely shut in, the harbour from our present
position has the appearance of an inland lake, and is perfectly
secure from any winds. Went in the boat with the Master and Mr
Hunt in afternoon to different points for bearings, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Propose making a fuller examination to-morrow. All the depths
given above are low water soundings.</p>
<p>June 26.&mdash;Went in boat with Messrs. Hunt and Headland to
examine the entrance to the harbour, found that what we yesterday
took for the bar was only a narrow sand-bank, a few yards in
width, running diagonally across the centre, with a channel on
either side upwards of a hundred yards wide, carrying 4, 5, and 6
fathoms at low water. Landed on eastern side of entrance, and saw
three natives fishing in the surf, about ½ a mile to the eastward
of us. Wishing to ascertain if possible the whereabouts of fresh
water, as also of pearl oysters (which at Tien Tsin Harbour they
call weerdie,) Mr Hunt, a man and myself advanced to meet them,
they having commenced coming towards us; making friendly signs
similar to those used by the natives seen since our arrival on
the coast, as we went on, which they returned, but their courage
failing them when within two or three hundred yards of us, they
made off for the sandhills, and as they continued to retire as we
advanced, we gave up the attempt and crossed over to the western
side and dug a hole in the most likely looking hollow among the
sand-hills, which however caved in just as the sand was becoming
very moist. Fresh water is in all probability to be found here at
this time, though for the same reasons as before stated with
regard to Hearson's Cove, and Tien Tsin Harbour, viz., the
proximity of the marshes on the land side, I do not believe that
a permanent supply will ever be obtained from wells. Some pieces
of shells of the large pearl oysters, similar to those found by
the <i>Dolphin's</i> party at Nicol Bay, were picked up this
morning.</p>
<p>July 15.&mdash;Messrs. Headland, Turner, and myself with two
of the Cutter's men examined two of the southern mangrove creeks
and found the cutter could if necessary go about two miles up
either of them and land stock from her deck during high-water on
to the spinifex plain, to all appearance quite clear of the
marshes.</p>
<p>July 16.&mdash;Mr Turner and two of the cutter's men went to
the overland track, and buried the letter for Mr Nairn apprising
him of the cutter's arrival here. Party returned about sunset,
having travelled the whole distance to the track (which they
struck about three miles to the N. E. of the quartz hill passed
by Messrs. Hunt, Nairn, and myself on 27th May,) on our overland
journey to the DeGrey, over firm ground, and passed one or two
water-courses the nearest of which is not much more than a mile
from the head of the creek, in which water will be procurable for
some weeks if even it should not rain. The fact of the line
between the head of the creeks here and the DeGrey River being
both practicable and easy for stock driving, is now determined
most satisfactorily. From the the masthead, as also from the
plains at the head of the creek, we can now see that this port is
about four or five miles further to the westward than it was
supposed to be when Mr Hunt and myself endeavoured to reach it on
the 28th May, which is fortunate, as it is very doubtful whether
the marshes, then seen, could ever have been crossed by large
stock."</p>
