<h1><a name="C00" id="C00">THE COMMON READER</a>
</h1>

<p>There is a sentence in Dr. Johnson's Life of Gray which might
well be written up in all those rooms, too humble to be called
libraries, yet full of books, where the pursuit of reading is
carried on by private people. "...I rejoice to concur with the
common reader; for by the common sense of readers, uncorrupted by
literary prejudices, after all the refinements of subtilty and the
dogmatism of learning, must be finally decided all claim to
poetical honours." It defines their qualities; it dignifies their
aims; it bestows upon a pursuit which devours a great deal of time,
and is yet apt to leave behind it nothing very substantial, the
sanction of the great man's approval.</p>

<p>The common reader, as Dr. Johnson implies, differs from the
critic and the scholar. He is worse educated, and nature has not
gifted him so generously. He reads for his own pleasure rather than
to impart knowledge or correct the opinions of others. Above all,
he is guided by an instinct to create for himself, out of whatever
odds and ends he can come by, some kind of whole&mdash;a portrait
of a man, a sketch of an age, a theory of the art of writing. He
never ceases, as he reads, to run up some rickety and ramshackle
fabric which shall give him the temporary satisfaction of looking
sufficiently like the real object to allow of affection, laughter,
and argument. Hasty, inaccurate, and superficial, snatching now
this poem, now that scrap of old furniture, without caring where he
finds it or of what nature it may be so long as it serves his
purpose and rounds his structure, his deficiencies as a critic are
too obvious to be pointed out; but if he has, as Dr. Johnson
maintained, some say in the final distribution of poetical honours,
then, perhaps, it may be worth while to write down a few of the
ideas and opinions which, insignificant in themselves, yet
contribute to so mighty a result.</p>

</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tower of Caister Castle still rises ninety feet into the
air, and the arch still stands from which Sir John Fastolf's barges
sailed out to fetch stone for the building of the great castle. But
now jackdaws nest on the tower, and of the castle, which once
covered six acres of ground, only ruined walls remain, pierced by
loop-holes and surmounted by battlements, though there are neither
archers within nor cannon without. As for the "seven religious men"
and the "seven poor folk" who should, at this very moment, be
praying for the souls of Sir John and his parents, there is no sign
of them nor sound of their prayers. The place is a ruin.
Antiquaries speculate and differ.</p>

<p><sup>&nbsp;</sup>
</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <i>The Paston Letters,</i> edited by Dr. James
Gairdner (1904), 4 vols.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not so very far off lie more ruins&mdash;the ruins of Bromholm
Priory, where John Paston was buried, naturally enough, since his
house was only a mile or so away, lying on low ground by the sea,
twenty miles north of Norwich. The coast is dangerous, and the
land, even in our time, inaccessible. Nevertheless, the little bit
of wood at Bromholm, the fragment of the true Cross, brought
pilgrims incessantly to the Priory, and sent them away with eyes
opened and limbs straightened. But some of them with their
newly-opened eyes saw a sight which shocked them&mdash;the grave of
John Paston in Bromholm Priory without a tombstone. The news spread
over the country-side. The Pastons had fallen; they that had been
so powerful could no longer afford a stone to put above John
Paston's head. Margaret, his widow, could not pay her debts; the
eldest son, Sir John, wasted his property upon women and
tournaments, while the younger, John also, though a man of greater
parts, thought more of his hawks than of his harvests.</p>

<p>The pilgrims of course were liars, as people whose eyes have
just been opened by a piece of the true Cross have every right to
be; but their news, none the less, was welcome. The Pastons had
risen in the world. People said even that they had been bondmen not
so very long ago. At any rate, men still living could remember
John's grandfather Clement tilling his own land, a hard-working
peasant; and William, Clement's son, becoming a judge and buying
land; and John, William's son, marrying well and buying more land
and quite lately inheriting the vast new castle at Caister, and all
Sir John's lands in Norfolk and Suffolk. People said that he had
forged the old knight's will. What wonder, then, that he lacked a
tombstone? But, if we consider the character of Sir John Paston,
John's eldest son, and his upbringing and his surroundings, and the
relations between himself and his father as the family letters
reveal them, we shall see how difficult it was, and how likely to
be neglected&mdash;this business of making his father's
tombstone.</p>

<p>For let us imagine, in the most desolate part of England known
to us at the present moment, a raw, new-built house, without
telephone, bathroom or drains, arm-chairs or newspapers, and one
shelf perhaps of books, unwieldy to hold, expensive to come by. The
windows look out upon a few cultivated fields and a dozen hovels,
and beyond them there is the sea on one side, on the other a vast
fen. A single road crosses the fen, but there is a hole in it,
which, one of the farm hands reports, is big enough to swallow a
carriage. And, the man adds, Tom Topcroft, the mad bricklayer, has
broken loose again and ranges the country half-naked, threatening
to kill any one who approaches him. That is what they talk about at
dinner in the desolate house, while the chimney smokes horribly,
and the draught lifts the carpets on the floor. Orders are given to
lock all gates at sunset, and, when the long dismal evening has
worn itself away, simply and solemnly, girt about with dangers as
they are, these isolated men and women fall upon their knees in
prayer.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century, however, the wild landscape was broken
suddenly and very strangely by vast piles of brand-new masonry.
There rose out of the sandhills and heaths of the Norfolk coast a
huge bulk of stone, like a modern hotel in a watering-place; but
there was no parade, no lodging-houses, and no pier at Yarmouth
then, and this gigantic building on the outskirts of the town was
built to house one solitary old gentleman without any
children&mdash;Sir John Fastolf, who had fought at Agincourt and
acquired great wealth. He had fought at Agincourt and got but
little reward. No one took his advice. Men spoke ill of him behind
his back. He was well aware of it; his temper was none the sweeter
for that. He was a hot-tempered old man, powerful, embittered by a
sense of grievance. But whether on the battlefield or at court he
thought perpetually of Caister, and how, when his duties allowed,
he would settle down on his father's land and live in a great house
of his own building.</p>

<p>The gigantic structure of Caister Castle was in progress not so
many miles away when the little Pastons were children. John Paston,
the father, had charge of some part of the business, and the
children listened, as soon as they could listen at all, to talk of
stone and building, of barges gone to London and not yet returned,
of the twenty-six private chambers, of the hall and chapel; of
foundations, measurements, and rascally work-people. Later, in
1454, when the work was finished and Sir John had come to spend his
last years at Caister, they may have seen for themselves the mass
of treasure that was stored there; the tables laden with gold and
silver plate; the wardrobes stuffed with gowns of velvet and satin
and cloth of gold, with hoods and tippets and beaver hats and
leather jackets and velvet doublets; and how the very pillow-cases
on the beds were of green and purple silk. There were tapestries
everywhere. The beds were laid and the bedrooms hung with
tapestries representing sieges, hunting and hawking, men fishing,
archers shooting, ladies playing on their harps, dallying with
ducks, or a giant "bearing the leg of a bear in his hand ". Such
were the fruits of a well-spent life. To buy land, to build great
houses, to stuff these houses full of gold and silver plate (though
the privy might well be in the bedroom), was the proper aim of
mankind. Mr. and Mrs. Paston spent the greater part of their
energies in the same exhausting occupation. For since the passion
to acquire was universal, one could never rest secure in one's
possessions for long. The outlying parts of one's property were in
perpetual jeopardy. The Duke of Norfolk might covet this manor, the
Duke of Suffolk that. Some trumped-up excuse, as for instance that
the Pastons were bondmen, gave them the right to seize the house
and batter down the lodges in the owner's absence. And how could
the owner of Paston and Mauteby and Drayton and Gresham be in five
or six places at once, especially now that Caister Castle was his,
and he must be in London trying to get his rights recognised by the
King? The King was mad too, they said; did not know his own child,
they said; or the King was in flight; or there was civil war in the
land. Norfolk was always the most distressed of counties and its
country gentlemen the most quarrelsome of mankind. Indeed, had Mrs.
Paston chosen, she could have told her children how when she was a
young woman a thousand men with bows and arrows and pans of burning
fire had marched upon Gresham and broken the gates and mined the
walls of the room where she sat alone. But much worse things than
that had happened to women. She neither bewailed her lot nor
thought herself a heroine. The long, long letters which she wrote
so laboriously in her clear cramped hand to her husband, who was
(as usual) away, make no mention of herself. The sheep had wasted
the hay. Heyden's and Tuddenham's men were out. A dyke had been
broken and a bullock stolen. They needed treacle badly, and really
she must have stuff for a dress.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Paston did not talk about herself.</p>

<p>Thus the little Pastons would see their mother writing or
dictating page after page, hour after hour, long long letters, but
to interrupt a parent who writes so laboriously of such important
matters would have been a sin. The prattle of children, the lore of
the nursery or schoolroom, did not find its way into these
elaborate communications. For the most part her letters are the
letters of an honest bailiff to his master, explaining, asking
advice, giving news, rendering accounts. There was robbery and
manslaughter; it was difficult to get in the rents; Richard Calle
had gathered but little money; and what with one thing and another
Margaret had not had time to make out, as she should have done, the
inventory of the goods which her husband desired. Well might old
Agnes, surveying her son's affairs rather grimly from a distance,
counsel him to contrive it so that "ye may have less to do in the
world; your father said, In little business lieth much rest. This
world is but a thoroughfare, and full of woe; and when we depart
therefrom, right nought bear with us but our good deeds and
ill."</p>

<p>The thought of death would thus come upon them in a clap. Old
Fastolf, cumbered with wealth and property, had his vision at the
end of Hell fire, and shrieked aloud to his executors to distribute
alms, and see that prayers were said "in perpetuum", so that his
soul might escape the agonies of purgatory. William Paston, the
judge, was urgent too that the monks of Norwich should be retained
to pray for his soul "for ever". The soul was no wisp of air, but a
solid body capable of eternal suffering, and the fire that
destroyed it was as fierce as any that burnt on mortal grates. For
ever there would be monks and the town of Norwich, and for ever the
Chapel of Our Lady in the town of Norwich. There was something
matter-of-fact, positive, and enduring in their conception both of
life and of death.</p>

<p>With the plan of existence so vigorously marked out, children of
course were well beaten, and boys and girls taught to know their
places. They must acquire land; but they must obey their parents. A
mother would clout her daughter's head three times a week and break
the skin if she did not conform to the laws of behaviour. Agnes
Paston, a lady of birth and breeding, beat her daughter Elizabeth.
Margaret Paston, a softer-hearted woman, turned her daughter out of
the house for loving the honest bailiff Richard Calle. Brothers
would not suffer their sisters to marry beneath them, and "sell
candle and mustard in Framlingham". The fathers quarrelled with the
sons, and the mothers, fonder of their boys than of their girls,
yet bound by all law and custom to obey their husbands, were torn
asunder in their efforts to keep the peace. With all her pains,
Margaret failed to prevent rash acts on the part of her eldest son
John, or the bitter words with which his father denounced him. He
was a "drone among bees", the father burst out, "which labour for
gathering honey in the fields, and the drone doth naught but taketh
his part of it". He treated his parents with insolence, and yet was
fit for no charge of responsibility abroad.</p>

<p>But the quarrel was ended, very shortly, by the death (22nd May
1466) of John Paston, the father, in London. The body was brought
down to Bromholm to be buried. Twelve poor men trudged all the way
bearing torches beside it. Alms were distributed; masses and dirges
were said. Bells were rung. Great quantities of fowls, sheep, pigs,
eggs, bread, and cream were devoured, ale and wine drunk, and
candles burnt. Two panes were taken from the church windows to let
out the reek of the torches. Black cloth was distributed, and a
light set burning on the grave. But John Paston, the heir, delayed
to make his father's tombstone.</p>

<p>He was a young man, something over twenty-four years of age. The
discipline and the drudgery of a country life bored him. When he
ran away from home, it was, apparently, to attempt to enter the
King's household. Whatever doubts, indeed, might be cast by their
enemies on the blood of the Pastons, Sir John was unmistakably a
gentleman. He had inherited his lands; the honey was his that the
bees had gathered with so much labour. He had the instincts of
enjoyment rather than of acquisition, and with his mother's
parsimony was strangely mixed something of his father's ambition.
Yet his own indolent and luxurious temperament took the edge from
both. He was attractive to women, liked society and tournaments,
and court life and making bets, and sometimes, even, reading books.
And so life now that John Paston was buried started afresh upon
rather a different foundation. There could be little outward change
indeed. Margaret still ruled the house. She still ordered the lives
of the younger children as she had ordered the lives of the elder.
The boys still needed to be beaten into book-learning by their
tutors, the girls still loved the wrong men and must be married to
the right. Rents had to be collected; the interminable lawsuit for
the Fastolf property dragged on. Battles were fought; the roses of
York and Lancaster alternately faded and flourished. Norfolk was
full of poor people seeking redress for their grievances, and
Margaret worked for her son as she had worked for her husband, with
this significant change only, that now, instead of confiding in her
husband, she took the advice of her priest.</p>

<p>But inwardly there was a change. It seems at last as if the hard
outer shell had served its purpose and something sensitive,
appreciative, and pleasure-loving had formed within. At any rate
Sir John, writing to his brother John at home, strayed sometimes
from the business on hand to crack a joke, to send a piece of
gossip, or to instruct him, knowingly and even subtly, upon the
conduct of a love affair. Be "as lowly to the mother as ye list,
but to the maid not too lowly, nor that ye be too glad to speed,
nor too sorry to fail. And I shall always be your herald both here,
if she come hither, and at home, when I come home, which I hope
hastily within XI. days at the furthest." And then a hawk was to be
bought, a hat, or new silk laces sent down to John in Norfolk,
prosecuting his suit, flying his hawks, and attending with
considerable energy and not too nice a sense of honesty to the
affairs of the Paston estates.</p>

<p>The lights had long since burnt out on John Paston's grave. But
still Sir John delayed; no tomb replaced them. He had his excuses;
what with the business of the lawsuit, and his duties at Court, and
the disturbance of the civil wars, his time was occupied and his
money spent. But perhaps something strange had happened to Sir John
himself, and not only to Sir John dallying in London, but to his
sister Margery falling in love with the bailiff, and to Walter
making Latin verses at Eton, and to John flying his hawks at
Paston. Life was a little more various in its pleasures. They were
not quite so sure as the elder generation had been of the rights of
man and of the dues of God, of the horrors of death, and of the
importance of tombstones. Poor Margaret Paston scented the change
and sought uneasily, with the pen which had marched so stiffly
through so many pages, to lay bare the root of her troubles. It was
not that the lawsuit saddened her; she was ready to defend Caister
with her own hands if need be, "though I cannot well guide nor rule
soldiers", but there was something wrong with the family since the
death of her husband and master. Perhaps her son had failed in his
service to God; he had been too proud or too lavish in his
expenditure; or perhaps he had shown too little mercy to the poor.
Whatever the fault might be, she only knew that Sir John spent
twice as much money as his father for less result; that they could
scarcely pay their debts without selling land, wood, or household
stuff ("It is a death to me to think if it"); while every day
people spoke ill of them in the country because they left John
Paston to lie without a tombstone. The money that might have bought
it, or more land, and more goblets and more tapestry, was spent by
Sir John on clocks and trinkets, and upon paying a clerk to copy
out Treatises upon Knighthood and other such stuff. There they
stood at Paston&mdash;eleven volumes, with the poems of Lydgate and
Chaucer among them, diffusing a strange air into the gaunt,
comfortless house, inviting men to indolence and vanity,
distracting their thoughts from business, and leading them not only
to neglect their own profit but to think lightly of the sacred dues
of the dead.</p>

<p>For sometimes, instead of riding off on his horse to inspect his
crops or bargain with his tenants, Sir John would sit, in broad
daylight, reading. There, on the hard chair in the comfortless room
with the wind lifting the carpet and the smoke stinging his eyes,
he would sit reading Chaucer, wasting his time, dreaming&mdash;or
what strange intoxication was it that he drew from books? Life was
rough, cheerless, and disappointing. A whole year of days would
pass fruitlessly in dreary business, like dashes of rain on the
window-pane. There was no reason in it as there had been for his
father; no imperative need to establish a family and acquire an
important position for children who were not born, or if born, had
no right to bear their father's name. But Lydgate's poems or
Chaucer's, like a mirror in which figures move brightly, silently,
and compactly, showed him the very skies, fields, and people whom
he knew, but rounded and complete. Instead of waiting listlessly
for news from London or piecing out from his mother's gossip some
country tragedy of love and jealousy, here, in a few pages, the
whole story was laid before him. And then as he rode or sat at
table he would remember some description or saying which bore upon
the present moment and fixed it, or some string of words would
charm him, and putting aside the pressure of the moment, he would
hasten home to sit in his chair and learn the end of the story.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To learn the end of the story&mdash;Chaucer can still make us
wish to do that. He has pre-eminently that story-teller's gift,
which is almost the rarest gift among writers at the present day.
Nothing happens to us as it did to our ancestors; events are seldom
important; if we recount them, we do not really believe in them; we
have perhaps things of greater interest to say, and for these
reasons natural story-tellers like Mr. Garnett, whom we must
distinguish from self-conscious storytellers like Mr. Masefield,
have become rare. For the story-teller, besides his indescribable
zest for facts, must tell his story craftily, without undue stress
or excitement, or we shall swallow it whole and jumble the parts
together; he must let us stop, give us time to think and look about
us, yet always be persuading us to move on. Chaucer was helped to
this to some extent by the time of his birth; and in addition he
had another advantage over the moderns which will never come the
way of English poets again. England was an unspoilt country. His
eyes rested on a virgin land, all unbroken grass and wood except
for the small towns and an occasional castle in the building. No
villa roofs peered through Kentish tree-tops; no factory chimney
smoked on the hill-side. The state of the country, considering how
poets go to Nature, how they use her for their images and their
contrasts even when they do not describe her directly, is a matter
of some importance. Her cultivation or her savagery influences the
poet far more profoundly than the prose writer. To the modern poet,
with Birmingham, Manchester, and London the size they are, the
country is the sanctuary of moral excellence in contrast with the
town which is the sink of vice. It is a retreat, the haunt of
modesty and virtue, where men go to hide and moralise. There is
something morbid, as if shrinking from human contact, in the nature
worship of Wordsworth, still more in the microscopic devotion which
Tennyson lavished upon the petals of roses and the buds of lime
trees. But these were great poets. In their hands, the country was
no mere jeweller's shop, or museum of curious objects to be
described, even more curiously, in words. Poets of smaller gift,
since the view is so much spoilt, and the garden or the meadow must
replace the barren heath and the precipitous mountain-side, are now
confined to little landscapes, to birds' nests, to acorns with
every wrinkle drawn to the life. The wider landscape is lost.</p>

<p>But to Chaucer the country was too large and too wild to be
altogether agreeable. He turned instinctively, as if he had painful
experience of their nature, from tempests and rocks to the bright
May day and the jocund landscape, from the harsh and mysterious to
the gay and definite. Without possessing a tithe of the virtuosity
in word-painting which is the modern inheritance, he could give, in
a few words, or even, when we come to look, without a single word
of direct description, the sense of the open air.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And se the fresshe floures how they sprynge</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;that is enough.</p>

<p>Nature, uncompromising, untamed, was no looking-glass for happy
faces, or confessor of unhappy souls. She was herself; sometimes,
therefore, disagreeable enough and plain, but always in Chaucer's
pages with the hardness and the freshness of an actual presence.
Soon, however, we notice something of greater importance than the
gay and picturesque appearance of the mediaeval world&mdash;the
solidity which plumps it out, the conviction which animates the
characters. There is immense variety in the <i>Canterbury
Tales,</i> and yet, persisting underneath, one consistent type.
Chaucer has his world; he has his young men; he has his young
women. If one met them straying in Shakespeare's world one would
know them to be Chaucer's, not Shakespeare's. He wants to describe
a girl, and this is what she looks like:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ful semely hir wimpel pinched was,<br>
Hir nose tretys; hir eyen greye as glas;<br>
Hir mouth ful smal, and ther-to soft and reed;<br>
But sikerly she hadde a fair foreheed;<br>

For, hardily, she was nat undergrowe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then he goes on to develop her; she was a girl, a virgin, cold
in her virginity:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am, thou woost, yet of thy companye,<br>
A mayde, and love hunting and venerye,<br>
And for to walken in the wodes wilde,<br>
And noght to been a wyf and be with childe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next he bethinks him how</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Discreet she was in answering alway;<br>
And though she had been as wise as Pallas<br>
No countrefeted termes hadde she<br>
To seme wys; but after hir degree<br>
She spak, and alle hir wordes more and lesse<br>
Souninge in vertu and in gentillesse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each of these quotations, in fact, comes from a different Tale,
but they are parts, one feels, of the same personage, whom he had
in mind, perhaps unconsciously, when he thought of a young girl,
and for this reason, as she goes in and out of the <i>Canterbury
Tales</i> bearing different names, she has a stability which is
only to be found where the poet has made up his mind about young
women, of course, but also about the world they live in, its end,
its nature, and his own craft and technique, so that his mind is
free to apply its force fully to its object. It does not occur to
him that his Griselda might be improved or altered. There is no
blur about her, no hesitation; she proves nothing; she is content
to be herself. Upon her, therefore, the mind can rest with that
unconscious ease which allows it, from hints and suggestions, to
endow her with many more qualities than are actually referred to.
Such is the power of conviction, a rare gift, a gift shared in our
day by Joseph Conrad in his earlier novels, and a gift of supreme
importance, for upon it the whole weight of the building depends.
Once believe in Chaucer's young men and women and we have no need
of preaching or protest. We know what he finds good, what evil; the
less said the better. Let him get on with his story, paint knights
and squires, good women and bad, cooks, shipmen, priests, and we
will supply the landscape, give his society its belief, its
standing towards life and death, and make of the journey to
Canterbury a spiritual pilgrimage.</p>

<p>This simple faithfulness to his own conceptions was easier then
than now in one respect at least, for Chaucer could write frankly
where we must either say nothing or say it slyly. He could sound
every note in the language instead of finding a great many of the
best gone dumb from disuse, and thus, when struck by daring
fingers, giving off a loud discordant jangle out of keeping with
the rest. Much of Chaucer&mdash;a few lines perhaps in each of the
Tales&mdash;is improper and gives us as we read it the strange
sensation of being naked to the air after being muffled in old
clothing. And, as a certain kind of humour depends upon being able
to speak without self-consciousness of the parts and functions of
the body, so with the advent of decency literature lost the use of
one of its limbs. It lost its power to create the Wife of Bath,
Juliet's nurse, and their recognisable though already colourless
relation, Moll Flanders. Sterne, from fear of coarseness, is forced
into indecency. He must be witty, not humorous; he must hint
instead of speaking outright. Nor can we believe, with Mr. Joyce's
<i>Ulysses</i> before us, that laughter of the old kind will ever
be heard again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But, lord Christ! When that it remembreth me<br>
Up-on my yowthe, and on my Iolitee,<br>
It tikleth me aboute myn herte rote.<br>
Unto this day it doth myn herte bote<br>
That I have had my world as in my tyme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sound of that old woman's voice is still.</p>

<p>But there is another and more important reason for the
surprising brightness, the still effective merriment of the
<i>Canterbury Tales.</i> Chaucer was a poet; but he never flinched
from the life that was being lived at the moment before his eyes. A
farmyard, with its straw, its dung, its cocks and its hens, is not
(we have come to think) a poetic subject; poets seem either to rule
out the farmyard entirely or to require that it shall be a farmyard
in Thessaly and its pigs of mythological origin. But Chaucer says
outright:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three large sowes hadde she, and namo,<br>
Three kyn, and eek a sheep that highte Malle;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>or again,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A yard she hadde, enclosed al aboute<br>
With stikkes, and a drye ditch with-oute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He is unabashed and unafraid. He will always get close up to his
object&mdash;an old man's chin&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With thikke bristles of his berde unsofte,<br>
Lyk to the skin of houndfish, sharp as brere;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>or an old man's neck&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The slakke skin aboute his nekke shaketh<br>
Whyl that he sang;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>and he will tell you what his characters wore, how they looked,
what they ate and drank, as if poetry could handle the common facts
of this very moment of Tuesday, the sixteenth day of April, 1387,
without dirtying her hands. If he withdraws to the time of the
Greeks or the Romans, it is only that his story leads him there. He
has no desire to wrap himself round in antiquity, to take refuge in
age, or to shirk the associations of common grocer's English.</p>

<p>Therefore when we say that we know the end of the journey, it is
hard to quote the particular lines from which we take our
knowledge. Chaucer fixed his eyes upon the road before him, not
upon the world to come. He was little given to abstract
contemplation. He deprecated, with peculiar archness, any
competition with the scholars and divines:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The answere of this I lete to divynis,<br>
But wel I woot, that in this world grey pyne is.<br>
What is this world? What asketh men to have?<br>
Now with his love, now in the colde grave<br>
Allone, withouten any companye,<br>
O cruel goddes, that governe<br>
This world with binding of your worde eterne,<br>
And wryten in the table of athamaunt<br>
Your parlement, and your eterne graunt,<br>
What is mankinde more un-to yow holde<br>
Than is the sheepe, that rouketh in the folde?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Questions press upon him; he asks them, but he is too true a
poet to answer them; he leaves them unsolved, uncramped by the
solution of the moment, and thus fresh for the generations that
come after him. In his life, too, it would be impossible to write
him down a man of this party or of that, a democrat or an
aristocrat. He was a staunch churchman, but he laughed at priests.
He was an able public servant and a courtier, but his views upon
sexual morality were extremely lax. He sympathised with poverty,
but did nothing to improve the lot of the poor. It is safe to say
that not a single law has been framed or one stone set upon another
because of anything that Chaucer said or wrote; and yet, as we read
him, we are absorbing morality at every pore. For among writers
there are two kinds: there are the priests who take you by the hand
and lead you straight up to the mystery; there are the laymen who
imbed their doctrines in flesh and blood and make a complete model
of the world without excluding the bad or laying stress upon the
good. Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley are among the priests;
they give us text after text to be hung upon the wall, saying after
saying to be laid upon the heart like an amulet against
disaster&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Farewell, farewell, the heart that lives alone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He prayeth best that loveth best<br>
All things both great and small</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;such lines of exhortation and command spring to memory
instantly. But Chaucer lets us go our ways doing the ordinary
things with the ordinary people. His morality lies in the way men
and women behave to each other. We see them eating, drinking,
laughing, and making love, and come to feel without a word being
said what their standards are and so are steeped through and
through with their morality. There can be no more forcible
preaching than this where all actions and passions are represented,
and instead of being solemnly exhorted we are left to stray and
stare and make out a meaning for ourselves. It is the morality of
ordinary intercourse, the morality of the novel, which parents and
librarians rightly judge to be far more persuasive than the
morality of poetry.</p>

<p>And so, when we shut Chaucer, we feel that without a word being
said the criticism is complete; what we are saying, thinking,
reading, doing, has been commented upon. Nor are we left merely
with the sense, powerful though that is, of having been in good
company and got used to the ways of good society. For as we have
jogged through the real, the unadorned country-side, with first one
good fellow cracking his joke or singing his song and then another,
we know that though this world resembles, it is not in fact our
daily world. It is the world of poetry. Everything happens here
more quickly and mere intensely, and with better order than in life
or in prose; there is a formal elevated dullness which is part of
the incantation of poetry; there are lines speaking half a second
in advance what we were about to say, as if we read our thoughts
before words cumbered them; and lines which we go back to read
again with that heightened quality, that enchantment which keeps
them glittering in the mind long afterwards. And the whole is held
in its place, and its variety and divagations ordered by the power
which is among the most impressive of all&mdash;the shaping power,
the architect's power. It is the peculiarity of Chaucer, however,
that though we feel at once this quickening, this enchantment, we
cannot prove it by quotation. From most poets quotation is easy and
obvious; some metaphor suddenly flowers; some passage breaks off
from the rest. But Chaucer is very equal, very even-paced, very
unmetaphorical. If we take six or seven lines in the hope that the
quality will be contained in them it has escaped.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My lord, ye woot that in my fadres place,<br>
Ye dede me strepe out of my povre wede,<br>
And richely me cladden, o your grace<br>
To yow broghte I noght elles, out of drede,<br>
But feyth and nakedness and maydenhede.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In its place that seemed not only memorable and moving but fit
to set beside striking beauties. Cut out and taken separately it
appears ordinary and quiet. Chaucer, it seems, has some art by
which the most ordinary words and the simplest feelings when laid
side by side make each other shine; when separated, lose their
lustre. Thus the pleasure he gives us is different from the
pleasure that other poets give us, because it is more closely
connected with what we have ourselves felt or observed. Eating,
drinking, and fine weather, the May, cocks and hens, millers, old
peasant women, flowers&mdash;there is a special stimulus in seeing
all these common things so arranged that they affect us as poetry
affects us, and are yet bright, sober, precise as we see them out
of doors. There is a pungency in this unfigurative language; a
stately and memorable beauty in the undraped sentences which follow
each other like women so slightly veiled that you see the lines of
their bodies as they go&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And she set down hir water pot anon<br>
Biside the threshold in an oxe's stall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then, as the procession takes its way, out from behind peeps
the face of Chaucer, in league with all foxes, donkeys, and hens,
to mock the pomps and ceremonies of life&mdash;witty, intellectual,
French, at the same time based upon a broad bottom of English
humour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So Sir John read his Chaucer in the comfortless room with the
wind blowing and the smoke stinging, and left his father's
tombstone unmade. But no book, no tomb, had power to hold him long.
He was one of those ambiguous characters who haunt the boundary
line where one age merges in another and are not able to inhabit
either. At one moment he was all for buying books cheap; next he
was off to France and told his mother, "My mind is now not most
upon books." In his own house, where his mother Margaret was
perpetually making out inventories or confiding in Gloys the
priest, he had no peace or comfort. There was always reason on her
side; she was a brave woman, for whose sake one must put up with
the priest's insolence and choke down one's rage when the grumbling
broke into open abuse, and "Thou proud priest" and "Thou proud
Squire" were bandied angrily about the room. All this, with the
discomforts of life and the weakness of his own character, drove
him to loiter in pleasanter places, to put off coming, to put off
writing, to put off, year after year, the making of his father's
tombstone.</p>

<p>Yet John Paston had now lain for twelve years under the bare
ground. The Prior of Bromholm sent word that the grave-cloth was in
tatters, and he had tried to patch it himself. Worse still, for a
proud woman like Margaret Paston, the country people murmured at
the Pastons' lack of piety, and other families she heard, of no
greater standing than theirs, spent money in pious restoration in
the very church where her husband lay unremembered. At last,
turning from tournaments and Chaucer and Mistress Anne Hault, Sir
John bethought him of a piece of cloth of gold which had been used
to cover his father's hearse and might now be sold to defray the
expenses of his tomb. Margaret had it in safe keeping; she had
hoarded it and cared for it, and spent twenty marks on its repair.
She grudged it; but there was no help for it. She sent it him,
still distrusting his intentions or his power to put them into
effect. "If you sell it to any other use," she wrote, "by my troth
I shall never trust you while I live."</p>

<p>But this final act, like so many that Sir John had undertaken in
the course of his life, was left undone. A dispute with the Duke of
Suffolk in the year 1479 made it necessary for him to visit London
in spite of the epidemic of sickness that was abroad; and there, in
dirty lodgings, alone, busy to the end with quarrels, clamorous to
the end for money, Sir John died and was buried at Whitefriars in
London. He left a natural daughter; he left a considerable number
of books; but his father's tomb was still unmade.</p>

<p>The four thick volumes of the Paston letters, however, swallow
up this frustrated man as the sea absorbs a raindrop. For, like all
collections of letters, they seem to hint that we need not care
overmuch for the fortunes of individuals. The family will go on,
whether Sir John lives or dies. It is their method to heap up in
mounds of insignificant and often dismal dust the innumerable
trivialities of daily life, as it grinds itself out, year after
year. And then suddenly they blaze up; the day shines out,
complete, alive, before our eyes. It is early morning, and strange
men have been whispering among the women as they milk. It is
evening, and there in the churchyard Warne's wife bursts out
against old Agnes Paston: "All the devils of Hell draw her soul to
Hell." Now it is the autumn in Norfolk, and Cecily Dawne comes
whining to Sir John for clothing. "Moreover, Sir, liketh it your
mastership to understand that winter and cold weather draweth nigh
and I have few clothes but of your gift." There is the ancient day,
spread out before us, hour by hour.</p>

<p>But in all this there is no writing for writing's sake; no use
of the pen to convey pleasure or amusement or any of the million
shades of endearment and intimacy which have filled so many English
letters since. Only occasionally, under stress of anger for the
most part, does Margaret Paston quicken into some shrewd saw or
solemn curse. "Men cut large thongs here out of other men's
leather...We beat the bushes and other men have the birds...Haste
reweth...which is to my heart a very spear." That is her eloquence
and that her anguish. Her sons, it is true, bend their pens more
easily to their will. They jest rather stiffly; they hint rather
clumsily; they make a little scene like a rough puppet show of the
old priest's anger and give a phrase or two directly as they were
spoken in person. But when Chaucer lived he must have heard this
very language, matter of fact, unmetaphorical, far better fitted
for narrative than for analysis, capable of religious solemnity or
of broad humour, but very stiff material to put on the lips of men
and women accosting each other face to face. In short, it is easy
to see, from the Paston letters, why Chaucer wrote not <i>Lear</i>
or <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i> but the <i>Canterbury Tales.</i></p>

<p>Sir John was buried; and John the younger brother succeeded in
his turn. The Paston letters go on; life at Paston continues much
the same as before. Over it all broods a sense of discomfort and
nakedness; of unwashed limbs thrust into splendid clothing; of
tapestry blowing on the draughty walls; of the bedroom with its
privy; of winds sweeping straight over land unmitigated by hedge or
town; of Caister Castle covering with solid stone six acres of
ground, and of the plain-faced Pastons indefatigably accumulating
wealth, treading out the roads of Norfolk, and persisting with an
obstinate courage which does them infinite credit in furnishing the
bareness of England.</p>

<h1><a name="C02" id="C02">ON NOT KNOWING GREEK</a>
</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For it is vain and foolish to talk of knowing Greek, since in
our ignorance we should be at the bottom of any class of
schoolboys, since we do not know how the words sounded, or where
precisely we ought to laugh, or how the actors acted, and between
this foreign people and ourselves there is not only difference of
race and tongue but a tremendous breach of tradition. All the more
strange, then, is it that we should wish to know Greek, try to know
Greek, feel for ever drawn back to Greek, and be for ever making up
some notion of the meaning of Greek, though from what incongruous
odds and ends, with what slight resemblance to the real meaning of
Greek, who shall say?</p>

<p>It is obvious in the first place that Greek literature is the
impersonal literature. Those few hundred years that separate John
Paston from Plato, Norwich from Athens, make a chasm which the vast
tide of European chatter can never succeed in crossing. When we
read Chaucer, we are floated up to him insensibly on the current of
our ancestors' lives, and later, as records increase and memories
lengthen, there is scarcely a figure which has not its nimbus of
association, its life and letters, its wife and family, its house,
its character, its happy or dismal catastrophe. But the Greeks
remain in a fastness of their own. Fate has been kind there too.
She has preserved them from vulgarity. Euripides was eaten by dogs;
Aeschylus killed by a stone; Sappho leapt from a cliff. We know no
more of them than that. We have their poetry, and that is all.</p>

<p>But that is not, and perhaps never can be, wholly true. Pick up
any play by Sophocles, read&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Son of him who led our hosts at Troy of old, son of
Agamemnon,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>and at once the mind begins to fashion itself surroundings. It
makes some background, even of the most provisional sort, for
Sophocles; it imagines some village, in a remote part of the
country, near the sea. Even nowadays such villages are to be found
in the wilder parts of England, and as we enter them we can
scarcely help feeling that here, in this cluster of cottages, cut
off from rail or city, are all the elements of a perfect existence.
Here is the Rectory; here the Manor house, the farm and the
cottages; the church for worship, the club for meeting, the cricket
field for play. Here life is simply sorted out into its main
elements. Each man and woman has his work; each works for the
health or happiness of others. And here, in this little community,
characters become part of the common stock; the eccentricities of
the clergyman are known; the great ladies' defects of temper; the
blacksmith's feud with the milkman, and the loves and matings of
the boys and girls. Here life has cut the same grooves for
centuries; customs have arisen; legends have attached themselves to
hilltops and solitary trees, and the village has its history, its
festivals, and its rivalries.</p>

<p>It is the climate that is impossible. If we try to think of
Sophocles here, we must annihilate the smoke and the damp and the
thick wet mists. We must sharpen the lines of the hills. We must
imagine a beauty of stone and earth rather than of woods and
greenery. With warmth and sunshine and months of brilliant, fine
weather, life of course is instantly changed; it is transacted out
of doors, with the result, known to all who visit Italy, that small
incidents are debated in the street, not in the sitting-room, and
become dramatic; make people voluble; inspire in them that
sneering, laughing, nimbleness of wit and tongue peculiar to the
Southern races, which has nothing in common with the slow reserve,
the low half-tones, the brooding introspective melancholy of people
accustomed to live more than half the year indoors.</p>

<p>That is the quality that first strikes us in Greek literature,
the lightning-quick, sneering, out-of-doors manner. It is apparent
in the most august as well as in the most trivial places. Queens
and Princesses in this very tragedy by Sophocles stand at the door
bandying words like village women, with a tendency, as one might
expect, to rejoice in language, to split phrases into slices, to be
intent on verbal victory. The humour of the people was not
good-natured like that of our postmen and cab-drivers. The taunts
of men lounging at the street corners had something cruel in them
as well as witty. There is a cruelty in Greek tragedy which is
quite unlike our English brutality. Is not Pentheus, for example,
that highly respectable man, made ridiculous in the <i>Bacchae</i>
before he is destroyed? In fact, of course, these Queens and
Princesses were out of doors, with the bees buzzing past them,
shadows crossing them, and the wind taking their draperies. They
were speaking to an enormous audience rayed round them on one of
those brilliant southern days when the sun is so hot and yet the
air so exciting. The poet, therefore, had to bethink him, not of
some theme which could be read for hours by people in privacy, but
of something emphatic, familiar, brief, that would carry, instantly
and directly, to an audience of seventeen thousand people perhaps,
with ears and eyes eager and attentive, with bodies whose muscles
would grow stiff if they sat too long without diversion. Music and
dancing he would need, and naturally would choose one of those
legends, like our Tristram and Iseult, which are known to every one
in outline, so that a great fund of emotion is ready prepared, but
can be stressed in a new place by each new poet.</p>

<p>Sophocles would take the old story of Electra, for instance, but
would at once impose his stamp upon it. Of that, in spite of our
weakness and distortion, what remains visible to us? That his
genius was of the extreme kind in the first place; that he chose a
design which, if it failed, would show its failure in gashes and
ruin, not in the gentle blurring of some insignificant detail;
which, if it succeeded, would cut each stroke to the bone, would
stamp each fingerprint in marble. His Electra stands before us like
a figure so tightly bound that she can only move an inch this way,
an inch that. But each movement must tell to the utmost, or, bound
as she is, denied the relief of all hints, repetitions,
suggestions, she will be nothing but a dummy, tightly bound. Her
words in crisis are, as a matter of fact, bare; mere cries of
despair, joy, hate</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#g00">[Greek text-1]</a>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But these cries give angle and outline to the play. It is thus,
with a thousand differences of degree, that in English literature
Jane Austen shapes a novel. There comes a moment&mdash;"I will
dance with you," says Emma&mdash;which rises higher than the rest,
which, though not eloquent in itself, or violent, or made striking
by beauty of language, has the whole weight of the book behind it.
In Jane Austen, too, we have the same sense, though the ligatures
are much less tight, that her figures are bound, and restricted to
a few definite movements. She, too, in her modest, everyday prose,
chose the dangerous art where one slip means death.</p>

<p>But it is not so easy to decide what it is that gives these
cries of Electra in her anguish their power to cut and wound and
excite. It is partly that we know her, that we have picked up from
little turns and twists of the dialogue hints of her character, of
her appearance, which, characteristically, she neglected; of
something suffering in her, outraged and stimulated to its utmost
stretch of capacity, yet, as she herself knows ("my behaviour is
unseemly and becomes me ill"), blunted and debased by the horror of
her position, an unwed girl made to witness her mother's vileness
and denounce it in loud, almost vulgar, clamour to the world at
large. It is partly, too, that we know in the same way that
Clytemnestra is no unmitigated villainess. "<a href="#g00">[Greek
text-2]</a>" she says&mdash;"there is a strange power in
motherhood". It is no murderess, violent and unredeemed, whom
Orestes kills within the house, and Electra bids him utterly
destroy&mdash;"Strike again." No; the men and women standing out in
the sunlight before the audience on the hill-side were alive
enough, subtle enough, not mere figures, or plaster casts of human
beings.</p>

<p>Yet it is not because we can analyse them into feelings that
they impress us. In six pages of Proust we can find more
complicated and varied emotions than in the whole of the
<i>Electra.</i> But in the <i>Electra</i> or in the <i>Antigone</i>
we are impressed by something different, by something perhaps more
impressive&mdash;by heroism itself, by fidelity itself. In spite of
the labour and the difficulty it is this that draws us back and
back to the Greeks; the stable, the permanent, the original human
being is to be found there. Violent emotions are needed to rouse
him into action, but when thus stirred by death, by betrayal, by
some other primitive calamity, Antigone and Ajax and Electra behave
in the way in which we should behave thus struck down; the way in
which everybody has always behaved; and thus we understand them
more easily and more directly than we understand the characters in
the <i>Canterbury Tales.</i> These are the originals, Chaucer's the
varieties of the human species.</p>

<p>It is true, of course, that these types of the original man or
woman, these heroic Kings, these faithful daughters, these tragic
Queens who stalk through the ages always planting their feet in the
same places, twitching their robes with the same gestures, from
habit not from impulse, are among the greatest bores and the most
demoralising companions in the world. The plays of Addison,
Voltaire, and a host of others are there to prove it. But encounter
them in Greek. Even in Sophocles, whose reputation for restraint
and mastery has filtered down to us from the scholars, they are
decided, ruthless, direct. A fragment of their speech broken off
would, we feel, colour oceans and oceans of the respectable drama.
Here we meet them before their emotions have been worn into
uniformity. Here we listen to the nightingale whose song echoes
through English literature singing in her own Greek tongue. For the
first time Orpheus with his lute makes men and beasts follow him.
Their voices ring out clear and sharp; we see the hairy, tawny
bodies at play in the sunlight among the olive trees, not posed
gracefully on granite plinths in the pale corridors of the British
Museum. And then suddenly, in the midst of all this sharpness and
compression, Electra, as if she swept her veil over her face and
forbade us to think of her any more, speaks of that very
nightingale: "that bird distraught with grief, the messenger of
Zeus. Ah, queen of sorrow, Niobe, thee I deem divine&mdash;thee;
who evermore weepest in thy rocky tomb."</p>

<p>And as she silences her own complaint, she perplexes us again
with the insoluble question of poetry and its nature, and why, as
she speaks thus, her words put on the assurance of immortality. For
they are Greek; we cannot tell how they sounded; they ignore the
obvious sources of excitement; they owe nothing of their effect to
any extravagance of expression, and certainly they throw no light
upon the speaker's character or the writer's. But they remain,
something that has been stated and must eternally endure.</p>

<p>Yet in a play how dangerous this poetry, this lapse from the
particular to the general must of necessity be, with the actors
standing there in person, with their bodies and their faces
passively waiting to be made use of! For this reason the later
plays of Shakespeare, where there is more of poetry than of action,
are better read than seen, better understood by leaving out the
actual body than by having the body, with all its associations and
movements, visible to the eye. The intolerable restrictions of the
drama could be loosened, however, if a means could be found by
which what was general and poetic, comment, not action, could be
freed without interrupting the movement of the whole. It is this
that the choruses supply; the old men or women who take no active
part in the drama, the undifferentiated voices who sing like birds
in the pauses of the wind; who can comment, or sum up, or allow the
poet to speak himself or supply, by contrast, another side to his
conception. Always in imaginative literature, where characters
speak for themselves and the author has no part, the need of that
voice is making itself felt. For though Shakespeare (unless we
consider that his fools and madmen supply the part) dispensed with
the chorus, novelists are always devising some
substitute&mdash;Thackeray speaking in his own person, Fielding
coming out and addressing the world before his curtain rises. So to
grasp the meaning of the play the chorus is of the utmost
importance. One must be able to pass easily into those ecstasies,
those wild and apparently irrelevant utterances, those sometimes
obvious and commonplace statements, to decide their relevance or
irrelevance, and give them their relation to the play as a
whole.</p>

<p>We must "be able to pass easily"; but that of course is exactly
what we cannot do. For the most part the choruses, with all their
obscurities, must be spelt out and their symmetry mauled. But we
can guess that Sophocles used them not to express something outside
the action of the play, but to sing the praises of some virtue, or
the beauties of some place mentioned in it. He selects what he
wishes to emphasize and sings of white Colonus and its nightingale,
or of love unconquered in fight. Lovely, lofty, and serene, his
choruses grow naturally out of his situations, and change, not the
point of view, but the mood. In Euripides, however, the situations
are not contained within themselves; they give off an atmosphere of
doubt, of suggestion, of questioning; but if we look to the
choruses to make this plain we are often baffled rather than
instructed. At once in the <i>Bacchae</i> we are in the world of
psychology and doubt; the world where the mind twists facts and
changes them and makes the familiar aspects of life appear new and
questionable. What is Bacchus, and who are the Gods, and what is
man's duty to them, and what the rights of his subtle brain? To
these questions the chorus makes no reply, or replies mockingly, or
speaks darkly as if the straitness of the dramatic form had tempted
Euripides to violate it, in order to relieve his mind of its
weight. Time is so short and I have so much to say, that unless you
will allow me to place together two apparently unrelated statements
and trust to you to pull them together, you must be content with a
mere skeleton of the play I might have given you. Such is the
argument. Euripides therefore suffers less than Sophocles and less
than Aeschylus from being read privately in a room, and not seen on
a hill-side in the sunshine. He can be acted in the mind; he can
comment upon the questions of the moment; more than the others he
will vary in popularity from age to age.</p>

<p>If then in Sophocles the play is concentrated in the figures
themselves, and in Euripides is to be retrieved from flashes of
poetry and questions far flung and unanswered, Aeschylus makes
these little dramas (the <i>Agamemnon</i> has 1663 lines;
<i>Lear</i> about 2600) tremendous by stretching every phrase to
the utmost, by sending them floating forth in metaphors, by bidding
them rise up and stalk eyeless and majestic through the scene. To
understand him it is not so necessary to understand Greek as to
understand poetry. It is necessary to take that dangerous leap
through the air without the support of words which Shakespeare also
asks of us. For words, when opposed to such a blast of meaning,
must give out, must be blown astray, and only by collecting in
companies convey the meaning which each one separately is too weak
to express. Connecting them in a rapid flight of the mind we know
instantly and instinctively what they mean, but could not decant
that meaning afresh into any other words. There is an ambiguity
which is the mark of the highest poetry; we cannot know exactly
what it means. Take this from the <i>Agamemnon</i> for
instance&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#g00">[Greek text-3]</a>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The meaning is just on the far side of language. It is the
meaning which in moments of astonishing excitement and stress we
perceive in our minds without words; it is the meaning that
Dostoevsky (hampered as he was by prose and as we are by
translation) leads us to by some astonishing run up the scale of
emotions and points at but cannot indicate; the meaning that
Shakespeare succeeds in snaring.</p>

<p>Aeschylus thus will not give, as Sophocles gives, the very words
that people might have spoken, only so arranged that they have in
some mysterious way a general force, a symbolic power, nor like
Euripides will he combine incongruities and thus enlarge his little
space, as a small room is enlarged by mirrors in odd corners. By
the bold and running use of metaphor he will amplify and give us,
not the thing itself, but the reverberation and reflection which,
taken into his mind, the thing has made; close enough to the
original to illustrate it, remote enough to heighten, enlarge, and
make splendid.</p>

<p>For none of these dramatists had the licence which belongs to
the novelist, and, in some degree, to all writers of printed books,
of modelling their meaning with an infinity of slight touches which
can only be properly applied by reading quietly, carefully, and
sometimes two or three times over. Every sentence had to explode on
striking the ear, however slowly and beautifully the words might
then descend, and however enigmatic might their final purport be.
No splendour or richness of metaphor could have saved the
<i>Agamemnon</i> if either images or allusions of the subtlest or
most decorative had got between us and the naked cry</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#g00">[Greek text-4]</a>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dramatic they had to be at whatever cost.</p>

<p>But winter fell on these villages, darkness and extreme cold
descended on the hill-side. There must have been some place indoors
where men could retire, both in the depths of winter and in the
summer heats, where they could sit and drink, where they could lie
stretched at their ease, where they could talk. It is Plato, of
course, who reveals the life indoors, and describes how, when a
party of friends met and had eaten not at all luxuriously and drunk
a little wine, some handsome boy ventured a question, or quoted an
opinion, and Socrates took it up, fingered it, turned it round,
looked at it this way and that, swiftly stripped it of its
inconsistencies and falsities and brought the whole company by
degrees to gaze with him at the truth. It is an exhausting process;
to concentrate painfully upon the exact meaning of words; to judge
what each admission involves; to follow intently, yet critically,
the dwindling and changing of opinion as it hardens and intensifies
into truth. Are pleasure and good the same? Can virtue be taught?
Is virtue knowledge? The tired or feeble mind may easily lapse as
the remorseless questioning proceeds; but no one, however weak, can
fail, even if he does not learn more from Plato, to love knowledge
better. For as the argument mounts from step to step, Protagoras
yielding, Socrates pushing on, what matters is not so much the end
we reach as our manner of reaching it. That all can feel&mdash;the
indomitable honesty, the courage, the love of truth which draw
Socrates and us in his wake to the summit where, if we too may
stand for a moment, it is to enjoy the greatest felicity of which
we are capable.</p>

<p>Yet such an expression seems ill fitted to describe the state of
mind of a student to whom, after painful argument, the truth has
been revealed. But truth is various; truth comes to us in different
disguises; it is not with the intellect alone that we perceive it.
It is a winter's night; the tables are spread at Agathon's house;
the girl is playing the flute; Socrates has washed himself and put
on sandals; he has stopped in the hall; he refuses to move when
they send for him. Now Socrates has done; he is bantering
Alcibiades; Alcibiades takes a fillet and binds it round "this
wonderful fellow's head". He praises Socrates. "For he cares not
for mere beauty, but despises more than any one can imagine all
external possessions, whether it be beauty or wealth or glory, or
any other thing for which the multitude felicitates the possessor.
He esteems these things and us who honour them, as nothing, and
lives among men, making all the objects of their admiration the
playthings of his irony. But I know not if any one of you has ever
seen the divine images which are within, when he has been opened
and is serious. I have seen them, and they are so supremely
beautiful, so golden, divine, and wonderful, that everything which
Socrates commands surely ought to be obeyed even like the voice of
a God." All this flows over the arguments of Plato&mdash;laughter
and movement; people getting up and going out; the hour changing;
tempers being lost; jokes cracked; the dawn rising. Truth, it
seems, is various; Truth is to be pursued with all our faculties.
Are we to rule out the amusements, the tendernesses, the
frivolities of friendship because we love truth? Will truth be
quicker found because we stop our ears to music and drink no wine,
and sleep instead of talking through the long winter's night? It is
not to the cloistered disciplinarian mortifying himself in solitude
that we are to turn, but to the well-sunned nature, the man who
practises the art of living to the best advantage, so that nothing
is stunted but some things are permanently more valuable than
others.</p>

<p>So in these dialogues we are made to seek truth with every part
of us. For Plato, of course, had the dramatic genius. It is by
means of that, by an art which conveys in a sentence or two the
setting and the atmosphere, and then with perfect adroitness
insinuates itself into the coils of the argument without losing its
liveliness and grace, and then contracts to bare statement, and
then, mounting, expands and soars in that higher air which is
generally reached only by the more extreme measures of
poetry&mdash;it is this art which plays upon us in so many ways at
once and brings us to an exultation of mind which can only be
reached when all the powers are called upon to contribute their
energy to the whole.</p>

<p>But we must beware. Socrates did not care for "mere beauty", by
which he meant, perhaps, beauty as ornament. A people who judged as
much as the Athenians did by ear, sitting out-of-doors at the play
or listening to argument in the market-place, were far less apt
than we are to break off sentences and appreciate them apart from
the context. For them there were no Beauties of Hardy, Beauties of
Meredith, Sayings from George Eliot. The writer had to think more
of the whole and less of the detail. Naturally, living in the open,
it was not the lip or the eye that struck them, but the carriage of
the body and the proportions of its parts. Thus when we quote and
extract we do the Greeks more damage than we do the English. There
is a bareness and abruptness in their literature which grates upon
a taste accustomed to the intricacy and finish of printed books. We
have to stretch our minds to grasp a whole devoid of the prettiness
of detail or the emphasis of eloquence. Accustomed to look directly
and largely rather than minutely and aslant, it was safe for them
to step into the thick of emotions which blind and bewilder an age
like our own. In the vast catastrophe of the European war our
emotions had to be broken up for us, and put at an angle from us,
before we could allow ourselves to feel them in poetry or fiction.
The only poets who spoke to the purpose spoke in the sidelong,
satiric manner of Wilfrid Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. It was not
possible for them to be direct without being clumsy; or to speak
simply of emotion without being sentimental. But the Greeks could
say, as if for the first time, "Yet being dead they have not died".
They could say, "If to die nobly is the chief part of excellence,
to us out of all men Fortune gave this lot; for hastening to set a
crown of freedom on Greece we lie possessed of praise that grows
not old". They could march straight up, with their eyes open; and
thus fearlessly approached, emotions stand still and suffer
themselves to be looked at.</p>

<p>But again (the question comes back and back), Are we reading
Greek as it was written when we say this? When we read these few
words cut on a tombstone, a stanza in a chorus, the end or the
opening of a dialogue of Plato's, a fragment of Sappho, when we
bruise our minds upon some tremendous metaphor in the
<i>Agamemnon</i> instead of stripping the branch of its flowers
instantly as we do in reading <i>Lear</i>&mdash;are we not reading
wrongly? losing our sharp sight in the haze of associations?
reading into Greek poetry not what they have but what we lack? Does
not the whole of Greece heap itself behind every line of its
literature? They admit us to a vision of the earth unravaged, the
sea unpolluted, the maturity, tried but unbroken, of mankind. Every
word is reinforced by a vigour which pours out of olive-tree and
temple and the bodies of the young. The nightingale has only to be
named by Sophocles and she sings; the grove has only to be called
<a href="#g00">[Greek text-5]</a>, "untrodden", and we imagine the
twisted branches and the purple violets. Back and back we are drawn
to steep ourselves in what, perhaps, is only an image of the
reality, not the reality itself, a summer's day imagined in the
heart of a northern winter. Chief among these sources of glamour
and perhaps misunderstanding is the language. We can never hope to
get the whole fling of a sentence in Greek as we do in English. We
cannot hear it, now dissonant, now harmonious, tossing sound from
line to line across a page. We cannot pick up infallibly one by one
all those minute signals by which a phrase is made to hint, to
turn, to live. Nevertheless, it is the language that has us most in
bondage; the desire for that which perpetually lures us back. First
there is the compactness of the expression. Shelley takes
twenty-one words in English to translate thirteen words of
Greek&mdash;<a href="#g00">[Greek text-6]</a> ("... for everyone,
even if before he were ever so undisciplined, becomes a poet as
soon as he is touched by love").</p>

<p>Every ounce of fat has been pared off, leaving the flesh firm.
Then, spare and bare as it is, no language can move more quickly,
dancing, shaking, all alive, but controlled. Then there are the
words themselves which, in so many instances, we have made
expressive to us of our own emotions, <a href="#g00">[Greek
text-7]</a>&mdash;to take the first that come to hand; so clear, so
hard, so intense, that to speak plainly yet fittingly without
blurring the outline or clouding the depths, Greek is the only
expression. It is useless, then, to read Greek in translations.
Translators can but offer us a vague equivalent; their language is
necessarily full of echoes and associations. Professor Mackail says
"wan", and the age of Burne-Jones and Morris is at once evoked. Nor
can the subtler stress, the flight and the fall of the words, be
kept even by the most skilful of scholars&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>...thee, who evermore weepest in thy rocky tomb</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>is not</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#g00">[Greek text-8]</a>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, in reckoning the doubts and difficulties there is this
important problem&mdash;Where are we to laugh in reading Greek?
There is a passage in the <i>Odyssey</i> where laughter begins to
steal upon us, but if Homer were looking we should probably think
it better to control our merriment. To laugh instantly it is almost
necessary (though Aristophanes may supply us with an exception) to
laugh in English. Humour, after all, is closely bound up with a
sense of the body. When we laugh at the humour of Wycherley, we are
laughing with the body of that burly rustic who was our common
ancestor on the village green. The French, the Italians, the
Americans, who derive physically from so different a stock, pause,
as we pause in reading Homer, to make sure that they are laughing
in the right place, and the pause is fatal. Thus humour is the
first of the gifts to perish in a foreign tongue, and when we turn
from Greek to English literature it seems, after a long silence, as
if our great age were ushered in by a burst of laughter.</p>

<p>These are all difficulties, sources of misunderstanding, of
distorted and romantic, of servile and snobbish passion. Yet even
for the unlearned some certainties remain. Greek is the impersonal
literature; it is also the literature of masterpieces. There are no
schools; no forerunners; no heirs. We cannot trace a gradual
process working in many men imperfectly until it expresses itself
adequately at last in one. Again, there is always about Greek
literature that air of vigour which permeates an "age", whether it
is the age of Aeschylus, or Racine, or Shakespeare. One generation
at least in that fortunate time is blown on to be writers to the
extreme; to attain that unconsciousness which means that the
consciousness is stimulated to the highest extent; to surpass the
limits of small triumphs and tentative experiments. Thus we have
Sappho with her constellations of adjectives; Plato daring
extravagant flights of poetry in the midst of prose; Thucydides,
constricted and contracted; Sophocles gliding like a shoal of trout
smoothly and quietly, apparently motionless, and then, with a
flicker of fins, off and away; while in the <i>Odyssey</i> we have
what remains the triumph of narrative, the clearest and at the same
time the most romantic story of the fortunes of men and women.</p>

<p>The <i>Odyssey</i> is merely a story of adventure, the
instinctive story-telling of a sea-faring race. So we may begin it,
reading quickly in the spirit of children wanting amusement to find
out what happens next. But here is nothing immature; here are
full-grown people, crafty, subtle, and passionate. Nor is the world
itself a small one, since the sea which separates island from
island has to be crossed by little hand-made boats and is measured
by the flight of the sea-gulls. It is true that the islands are not
thickly populated, and the people, though everything is made by
hands, are not closely kept at work. They have had time to develop
a very dignified, a very stately society, with an ancient tradition
of manners behind it, which makes every relation at once orderly,
natural, and full of reserve. Penelope crosses the room; Telemachus
goes to bed; Nausicaa washes her linen; and their actions seem
laden with beauty because they do not know that they are beautiful,
have been born to their possessions, are no more self-conscious
than children, and yet, all those thousands of years ago, in their
little islands, know all that is to be known. With the sound of the
sea in their ears, vines, meadows, rivulets about them, they are
even more aware than we are of a ruthless fate. There is a sadness
at the back of life which they do not attempt to mitigate. Entirely
aware of their own standing in the shadow, and yet alive to every
tremor and gleam of existence, there they endure, and it is to the
Greeks that we turn when we are sick of the vagueness, of the
confusion, of the Christianity and its consolations, of our own
age.</p>

<h1><a name="C03" id="C03">THE ELIZABETHAN LUMBER ROOM</a>
</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These magnificent volumes<sup>1</sup> are not often, perhaps,
read through. Part of their charm consists in the fact that Hakluyt
is not so much a book as a great bundle of commodities loosely tied
together, an emporium, a lumber room strewn with ancient sacks,
obsolete nautical instruments, huge bales of wool, and little bags
of rubies and emeralds. One is for ever untying this packet here,
sampling that heap over there, wiping the dust off some vast map of
the world, and sitting down in semi-darkness to snuff the strange
smells of silks and leathers and ambergris, while outside tumble
the huge waves of the uncharted Elizabethan sea.</p>

<p><sup>&nbsp;</sup>
</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <i>Hakluyt's Collection of the Early Voyages,
Travels, and Discoveries of the English Nation,</i> five volumes,
4to, 1810.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For this jumble of seeds, silks, unicorns' horns, elephants'
teeth, wool, common stones, turbans, and bars of gold, these odds
and ends of priceless value and complete worthlessness, were the
fruit of innumerable voyages, traffics, and discoveries to unknown
lands in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The expeditions were manned
by "apt young men" from the West country, and financed in part by
the great Queen herself. The ships, says Froude, were no bigger
than modern yachts. There in the river by Greenwich the fleet lay
gathered, close to the Palace. "The Privy council looked out of the
windows of the court ...the ships thereupon discharge their
ordnance...and the mariners they shouted in such sort that the sky
rang again with the noise thereof." Then, as the ships swung down
the tide, one sailor after another walked the hatches, climbed the
shrouds, stood upon the mainyards to wave his friends a last
farewell. Many would come back no more. For directly England and
the coast of France were beneath the horizon, the ships sailed into
the unfamiliar; the air had its voices, the sea its lions and
serpents, its evaporations of fire and tumultuous whirlpools. But
God too was very close; the clouds but sparely hid the divinity
Himself; the limbs of Satan were almost visible. Familiarly the
English sailors pitted their God against the God of the Turks, who
"can speake never a word for dulnes, much lesse can he helpe them
in such an extremitie....But howsoever their God behaved himself,
our God showed himself a God indeed..." God was as near by sea as
by land, said Sir Humfrey Gilbert, riding through the storm.
Suddenly one light disappeared; Sir Humfrey Gilbert had gone
beneath the waves; when morning came, they sought his ship in vain.
Sir Hugh Willoughby sailed to discover the North-West Passage and
made no return. The Earl of Cumberland's men, hung up by adverse
winds off the coast of Cornwall for a fortnight, licked the muddy
water off the deck in agony. And sometimes a ragged and worn-out
man came knocking at the door of an English country house and
claimed to be the boy who had left it years ago to sail the seas.
"Sir William his father, and my lady his mother knew him not to be
their son, until they found a secret mark, which was a wart upon
one of his knees." But he had with him a black stone, veined with
gold, or an ivory tusk, or a silver ingot, and urged on the village
youth with talk of gold strewn over the land as stones are strewn
in the fields of England. One expedition might fail, but what if
the passage to the fabled land of uncounted riches lay only a
little farther up the coast? What if the known world was only the
prelude to some more splendid panorama? When, after the long
voyage, the ships dropped anchor in the great river of the Plate
and the men went exploring through the undulating lands, startling
grazing herds of deer, seeing the limbs of savages between the
trees, they filled their pockets with pebbles that might be
emeralds or sand that might be gold; or sometimes, rounding a
headland, they saw, far off, a string of savages slowly descending
to the beach bearing on their heads and linking their shoulders
together with heavy burdens for the Spanish King.</p>

<p>These are the fine stories used effectively all through the West
country to decoy "the apt young men" lounging by the harbour-side
to leave their nets and fish for gold. But the voyagers were sober
merchants into the bargain, citizens with the good of English trade
and the welfare of English work-people at heart. The captains are
reminded how necessary it is to find a market abroad for English
wool; to discover the herb from which blue dyes are made; above all
to make inquiry as to the methods of producing oil, since all
attempts to make it from radish seed have failed. They are reminded
of the misery of the English poor, whose crimes, brought about by
poverty, make them "daily consumed by the gallows". They are
reminded how the soil of England had been enriched by the
discoveries of travellers in the past; how Dr. Linaker brought
seeds of the damask rose and tulipas, and how beasts and plants and
herbs, "without which our life were to be said barbarous", have all
come to England gradually from abroad. In search of markets and of
goods, of the immortal fame success would bring them, the apt young
men set sail for the North, and were left, a little company of
isolated Englishmen surrounded by snow and the huts of savages, to
make what bargains they could and pick up what knowledge they might
before the ships returned in the summer to fetch them home again.
There they endured, an isolated company, burning on the rim of the
dark. One of them, carrying a charter from his company in London,
went inland as far as Moscow, and there saw the Emperor "sitting in
his chair of estate with his crown on his head, and a staff of
goldsmiths' work in his left hand". All the ceremony that he saw is
carefully written out, and the sight upon which the English
merchant first set eyes has the brilliancy of a Roman vase dug up
and stood for a moment in the sun, until, exposed to the air, seen
by millions of eyes, it dulls and crumbles away. There, all these
centuries, on the outskirts of the world, the glories of Moscow,
the glories of Constantinople have flowered unseen. The Englishman
was bravely dressed for the occasion, led "three fair mastiffs in
coats of red cloth", and carried a letter from Elizabeth "the paper
whereof did smell most fragrantly of camphor and ambergris, and the
ink of perfect musk". And sometimes, since trophies from the
amazing new world were eagerly awaited at home, together with
unicorns' horns and lumps of ambergris and the fine stories of the
engendering of whales and "debates" of elephants and dragons whose
blood, mixed, congealed into vermilion, a living sample would be
sent, a live savage caught somewhere off the coast of Labrador,
taken to England, and shown about like a wild beast. Next year they
brought him back, and took a woman savage on board to keep him
company. When they saw each other they blushed; they blushed
profoundly, but the sailors, though they noted it, knew not why.
Later the two savages set up house together on board ship, she
attending to his wants, he nursing her in sickness. But, as the
sailors noted again, the savages lived together in perfect
chastity.</p>

<p>All this, the new words, the new ideas, the waves, the savages,
the adventures, found their way naturally into the plays which were
being acted on the banks of the Thames. There was an audience quick
to seize upon the coloured and the high-sounding; to associate
those</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>frigates bottom'd with rich Sethin planks,<br>
Topt with the lofty firs of Lebanon,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>with the adventures of their own sons and brothers abroad. The
Verneys, for example, had a wild boy who had gone as pirate, turned
Turk, and died out there, sending back to Claydon to be kept as
relics of him some silk, a turban, and a pilgrim's staff. A gulf
lay between the spartan domestic housecraft of the Paston women and
the refined tastes of the Elizabethan Court ladies, who, grown old,
says Harrison, spent their time reading histories, or "writing
volumes of their own, or translating of other men's into our
English and Latin tongue", while the younger ladies played the lute
and the citharne and spent their leisure in the enjoyment of music.
Thus, with singing and with music, springs into existence the
characteristic Elizabethan extravagance; the dolphins and lavoltas
of Greene; the hyperbole, more surprising in a writer so terse and
muscular, of Ben Jonson. Thus we find the whole of Elizabethan
literature strewn with gold and silver; with talk of Guiana's
rarities, and references to that America&mdash;"O my America! my
new-found-land"&mdash;which was not merely a land on the map, but
symbolised the unknown territories of the soul. So, over the water,
the imagination of Montaigne brooded in fascination upon savages,
cannibals, society, and government.</p>

<p>But the mention of Montaigne suggests that though the influence
of the sea and the voyages, of the lumber room crammed with sea
beasts and horns and ivory and old maps and nautical instruments,
helped to inspire the greatest age of English poetry, its effects
were by no means so beneficial upon English prose. Rhyme and metre
helped the poets to keep the tumult of their perceptions in order.
But the prose writer, without these restrictions, accumulated
clauses, petered out in interminable catalogues, tripped and
stumbled over the convolutions of his own rich draperies. How
little Elizabethan prose was fit for its office, how exquisitely
French prose was already adapted, can be seen by comparing a
passage from Sidney's <i>Defense of Poesie</i> with one from
Montaigne's Essays.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He beginneth not with obscure definitions, which must blur the
margent with interpretations, and load the memory with
doubtfulness: but he cometh to you with words set in delightful
proportion, either accompanied with, or prepared for the well
enchanting Skill of Music, and with a tale (forsooth) he cometh
unto you, with a tale which holdeth children from play, and old men
from the Chimney corner; and pretending no more, doth intend the
winning of the mind from wickedness to virtue; even as the child is
often brought to take most wholesome things by hiding them in such
other as have a pleasant taste: which if one should begin to tell
them the nature of the <i>Alo&euml;s</i> or <i>Rhubarbarum</i> they
should receive, would sooner take their physic at their ears than
at their mouth, so is it in men (most of which are childish in the
best things, till they be cradled in their graves) glad they will
be to hear the tales of Hercules...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And so it runs on for seventy-six words more. Sidney's prose is
an uninterrupted monologue, with sudden flashes of felicity and
splendid phrases, which lends itself to lamentations and
moralities, to long accumulations and catalogues, but is never
quick, never colloquial, unable to grasp a thought closely and
firmly, or to adapt itself flexibly and exactly to the chops and
changes of the mind. Compared with this, Montaigne is master of an
instrument which knows its own powers and limitations, and is
capable of insinuating itself into crannies and crevices which
poetry can never reach; capable of cadences different but no less
beautiful; of subtleties and intensities which Elizabethan prose
entirely ignores. He is considering the way in which certain of the
ancients met death:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...ils l'ont faicte couler et glisser parmy la laschet&eacute;
de leurs occupations accoustum&eacute;es entre des garses et bons
compaignons; nul propos de consolation, nulle mention de testament,
nulle affectation ambitieuse de constance, nul discours de leur
condition future; mais entre les jeux, les festins, facecies,
entretiens communs et populaires, et la musique, et des vers
amoureux.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>An age seems to separate Sidney from Montaigne. The English
compared with the French are as boys compared with men.</p>

<p>But the Elizabethan prose writers, if they have the formlessness
of youth, have, too, its freshness and audacity. In the same essay
Sidney shapes language, masterfully and easily, to his liking;
freely and naturally reaches his hand for a metaphor. To bring this
prose to perfection (and Dryden's prose is very near perfection)
only the discipline of the stage was necessary and the growth of
self-consciousness. It is in the plays, and especially in the comic
passages of the plays, that the finest Elizabethan prose is to be
found. The stage was the nursery where prose learnt to find its
feet. For on the stage people had to meet, to quip and crank, to
suffer interruptions, to talk of ordinary things.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Cler.</i> A pox of her autumnal face, her pieced beauty!
there's no man can be admitted till she be ready now-a-days; till
she has painted, and perfumed, and washed, and scoured, but the boy
here; and him she wipes her oiled lips upon, like a sponge. I have
made a song (I pray thee hear it) on the subject.</p>

<p>[Page <i>sings.</i></p>

<p>Still to be neat, still to be drest, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>True.</i> And I am clearly on the other side: I love a good
dressing before any beauty o' the world. O, a woman is then like a
delicate garden; nor is there one kind of it; she may vary every
hour; take often counsel of her glass, and choose the best. If she
have good ears, show them; good hair, lay it out; good legs, wear
short clothes; a good hand, discover it often: practise any art to
mend breath, cleanse teeth, repair eyebrows; paint and profess
it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So the talk runs in Ben Jonson's <i>Silent Woman,</i> knocked
into shape by interruptions, sharpened by collisions, and never
allowed to settle into stagnancy or swell into turbidity. But the
publicity of the stage and the perpetual presence of a second
person were hostile to that growing consciousness of one's self,
that brooding in solitude over the mysteries of the soul, which, as
the years went by, sought expression and found a champion in the
sublime genius of Sir Thomas Browne. His immense egotism has paved
the way for all psychological novelists, auto-biographers,
confession-mongers, and dealers in the curious shades of our
private life. He it was who first turned from the contacts of men
with men to their lonely life within. "The world that I regard is
myself; it is the microcosm of my own frame that I cast mine eye
on; for the other I use it but like my globe, and turn it round
sometimes for my recreation." All was mystery and darkness as the
first explorer walked the catacombs swinging his lanthorn. "I feel
sometimes a hell within myself; Lucifer keeps his court in my
breast; Legion is revived in me." In these solitudes there were no
guides and no companions. "I am in the dark to all the world, and
my nearest friends behold me but in a cloud." The strangest
thoughts and imaginings have play with him as he goes about his
work, outwardly the most sober of mankind and esteemed the greatest
physician in Norwich. He has wished for death. He has doubted all
things. What if we are asleep in this world and the conceits of
life are as mere dreams? The tavern music, the Ave Mary bell, the
broken pot that the workman has dug out of the field&mdash;at the
sight and sound of them he stops dead, as if transfixed by the
astonishing vista that opens before his imagination. "We carry with
us the wonders we seek without us; there is all Africa and her
prodigies in us." A halo of wonder encircles everything that he
sees; he turns his light gradually upon the flowers and insects and
grasses at his feet so as to disturb nothing in the mysterious
processes of their existence. With the same awe, mixed with a
sublime complacency, he records the discovery of his own qualities
and attainments. He was charitable and brave and averse from
nothing. He was full of feeling for others and merciless upon
himself. "For my conversation, it is like the sun's, with all men,
and with a friendly aspect to good and bad." He knows six
languages, the laws, the customs and policies of several states,
the names of all the constellations and most of the plants of his
country, and yet, so sweeping is his imagination, so large the
horizon in which he sees this little figure walking that "methinks
I do not know so many as when I did but know a hundred, and had
scarcely ever simpled further than Cheapside".</p>

<p>He is the first of the autobiographers. Swooping and soaring at
the highest altitudes, he stoops suddenly with loving particularity
upon the details of his own body. His height was moderate, he tells
us, his eyes large and luminous; his skin dark but constantly
suffused with blushes. He dressed very plainly. He seldom laughed.
He collected coins, kept maggots in boxes, dissected the lungs of
frogs, braved the stench of the spermaceti whale, tolerated Jews,
had a good word for the deformity of the toad, and combined a
scientific and sceptical attitude towards most things with an
unfortunate belief in witches. In short, as we say when we cannot
help laughing at the oddities of people we admire most, he was a
character, and the first to make us feel that the most sublime
speculations of the human imagination are issued from a particular
man, whom we can love. In the midst of the solemnities of the Urn
Burial we smile when he remarks that afflictions induce
callosities. The smile broadens to laughter as we mouth out the
splendid pomposities, the astonishing conjectures of the <i>Religio
Medici.</i> Whatever he writes is stamped with his own
idiosyncrasy, and we first become conscious of impurities which
hereafter stain literature with so many freakish colours that,
however hard we try, it is difficult to be certain whether we are
looking at a man or his writing. Now we are in the presence of
sublime imagination; now rambling through one of the finest lumber
rooms in the world&mdash;a chamber stuffed from floor to ceiling
with ivory, old iron, broken pots, urns, unicorns' horns, and magic
glasses full of emerald lights and blue mystery.</p>

<h1><a name="C04" id="C04">NOTES ON AN ELIZABETHAN PLAY</a>
</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are, it must be admitted, some highly formidable tracts in
English literature, and chief among them that jungle, forest, and
wilderness which is the Elizabethan drama. For many reasons, not
here to be examined, Shakespeare stands out, Shakespeare who has
had the light on him from his day to ours, Shakespeare who towers
highest when looked at from the level of his own contemporaries.
But the plays of the lesser Elizabethans&mdash;Greene, Dekker,
Peele, Chapman, Beaumont and Fletcher,&mdash;to adventure into that
wilderness is for the ordinary reader an ordeal, an upsetting
experience which plys him with questions, harries him with doubts,
alternately delights and vexes him with pleasures and pains. For we
are apt to forget, reading, as we tend to do, only the masterpieces
of a bygone age, how great a power the body of a literature
possesses to impose itself: how it will not suffer itself to be
read passively, but takes us and reads us; flouts our
preconceptions; questions principles which we had got into the
habit of taking for granted, and, in fact, splits us into two parts
as we read, making us, even as we enjoy, yield our ground or stick
to our guns.</p>

<p>At the outset in reading an Elizabethan play we are overcome by
the extraordinary discrepancy between the Elizabethan view of
reality and our own. The reality to which we have grown accustomed
is, speaking roughly, based upon the life and death of some knight
called Smith, who succeeded his father in the family business of
pitwood importers, timber merchants and coal exporters, was well
known in political, temperance, and church circles, did much for
the poor of Liverpool, and died last Wednesday of pneumonia while
on a visit to his son at Muswell Hill. That is the world we know.
That is the reality which our poets and novelists have to expound
and illuminate. Then we open the first Elizabethan play that comes
to hand and read how</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I once did see<br>
In my young travels through Armenia<br>
An angry unicorn in his full career<br>
Charge with too swift a foot a jeweller<br>
That watch'd him for the treasure of his brow,<br>
And ere he could get shelter of a tree<br>
Nail him with his rich antlers to the earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where is Smith, we ask, where is Liverpool? And the groves of
Elizabethan drama echo "Where?" Exquisite is the delight, sublime
the relief of being set free to wander in the land of the unicorn
and the jeweller among dukes and grandees, Gonzaloes and
Bellimperias, who spend their lives in murder and intrigue, dress
up as men if they are women, as women if they are men, see ghosts,
run mad, and die in the greatest profusion on the slightest
provocation, uttering as they fall imprecations of superb vigour or
elegies of the wildest despair. But soon the low, the relentless
voice, which if we wish to identify it we must suppose typical of a
reader fed on modern English literature, and French and Russian,
asks why, then, with all this to stimulate and enchant, these old
plays are for long stretches of time so intolerably dull? Is it not
that literature, if it is to keep us on the alert through five acts
or thirty-two chapters, must somehow be based on Smith, have one
toe touching Liverpool, take off into whatever heights it pleases
from reality? We are not so purblind as to suppose that a man
because his name is Smith and he lives at Liverpool is therefore
"real". We know indeed that this reality is a chameleon quality,
the fantastic becoming as we grow used to it often the closest to
the truth, the sober the furthest from it, and nothing proving a
writer's greatness more than his capacity to consolidate his scene
by the use of what, until he touched them, seemed wisps of cloud
and threads of gossamer. Our contention merely is that there is a
station, somewhere in mid-air, whence Smith and Liverpool can be
seen to the best advantage; that the great artist is the man who
knows where to place himself above the shifting scenery; that while
he never loses sight of Liverpool he never sees it in the wrong
perspective. The Elizabethans bore us, then, because their Smiths
are all changed to dukes, their Liverpools to fabulous islands and
palaces in Genoa. Instead of keeping a proper poise above life they
soar miles into the empyrean, where nothing is visible for long
hours at a time but clouds at their revelry, and a cloud landscape
is not ultimately satisfactory to human eyes. The Elizabethans bore
us because they suffocate our imaginations rather than set them to
work.</p>

<p>Still, though potent enough, the boredom of an Elizabethan play
is of a different quality altogether from the boredom which a
nineteenth-century play, a Tennyson or a Henry Taylor play,
inflicts. The riot of images, the violent volubility of language,
all that cloys and satiates in the Elizabethans yet appears to be
drawn up with a roar as a feeble fire is sucked up by a newspaper.
There is, even in the worst, an intermittent bawling vigour which
gives us the sense in our quiet arm-chairs of ostlers and
orange-girls catching up the lines, flinging them back, hissing or
stamping applause. But the deliberate drama of the Victorian age is
evidently written in a study. It has for audience ticking clocks
and rows of classics bound in half morocco. There is no stamping,
no applause. It does not, as, with all its faults, the Elizabethan
audience did, leaven the mass with fire. Rhetorical and bombastic,
the lines are flung and hurried into existence and reach the same
impromptu felicities, have the same lip-moulded profusion and
unexpectedness, which speech sometimes achieves, but seldom in our
day the deliberate, solitary pen. Indeed, half the work of the
dramatists, one feels, was done in the Elizabethan age by the
public.</p>

<p>Against that, however, is to be set the fact that the influence
of the public was in many respects detestable. To its door we must
lay the greatest infliction that Elizabethan drama puts upon
us&mdash;the plot; the incessant, improbable, almost unintelligible
convolutions which presumably gratified the spirit of an excitable
and unlettered public actually in the playhouse, but only confuse
and fatigue a reader with the book before him. Undoubtedly
something must happen; undoubtedly a play where nothing happens is
an impossibility. But we have a right to demand (since the Greeks
have proved that it is perfectly possible) that what happens shall
have an end in view. It shall agitate great emotions; bring into
existence memorable scenes; stir the actors to say what could not
be said without this stimulus. Nobody can fail to remember the plot
of the <i>Antigone,</i> because what happens is so closely bound up
with the emotions of the actors that we remember the people and the
plot at one and the same time. But who can tell us what happens in
the <i>White Devil,</i> or the <i>Maid's Tragedy,</i> except by
remembering the story apart from the emotions which it has aroused?
As for the lesser Elizabethans, like Greene and Kyd, the
complexities of their plots are so great, and the violence which
those plots demand so terrific, that the actors themselves are
obliterated and emotions which, according to our convention at
least, deserve the most careful investigation, the most delicate
analysis, are clean sponged off the slate. And the result is
inevitable. Outside Shakespeare and perhaps Ben Jonson, there are
no characters in Elizabethan drama, only violences whom we know so
little that we can scarcely care what becomes of them. Take any
hero or heroine in those early plays&mdash;Bellimperia in the
<i>Spanish Tragedy</i> will serve as well as another&mdash;and can
we honestly say that we care a jot for the unfortunate lady who
runs the whole gamut of human misery to kill herself in the end? No
more than for an animated broomstick, we must reply, and in a work
dealing with men and women the prevalence of broomsticks is a
drawback. But the <i>Spanish Tragedy</i> is admittedly a crude
forerunner, chiefly valuable because such primitive efforts lay
bare the formidable framework which greater dramatists could
modify, but had to use. Ford, it is claimed, is of the school of
Stendhal and of Flaubert; Ford is a psychologist. Ford is an
analyst. "This man", says Mr. Havelock Ellis, "writes of women not
as a dramatist nor as a lover, but as one who has searched
intimately and felt with instinctive sympathy the fibres of their
hearts."</p>

<p>The play&mdash;<i>'Tis pity she's a Whore</i>&mdash;upon which
this judgement is chiefly based shows us the whole nature of
Annabella spun from pole to pole in a series of tremendous
vicissitudes. First, her brother tells her that he loves her; next
she confesses her love for him; next finds herself with child by
him; next forces herself to marry Soranzo; next is discovered; next
repents; finally is killed, and it is her lover and brother who
kills her. To trace the trail of feelings which such crises and
calamities might be expected to breed in a woman of ordinary
sensibility might have filled volumes. A dramatist, of course, has
no volumes to fill. He is forced to contract. Even so, he can
illumine; he can reveal enough for us to guess the rest. But what
is it that we know without using microscopes and splitting hairs
about the character of Annabella? Gropingly we make out that she is
a spirited girl, with her defiance of her husband when he abuses
her, her snatches of Italian song, her ready wit, her simple glad
love-making. But of character as we understand the word there is no
trace. We do not know how she reaches her conclusions, only that
she has reached them. Nobody describes her. She is always at the
height of her passion, never at its approach. Compare her with Anna
Karenina. The Russian woman is flesh and blood, nerves and
temperament, has heart, brain, body and mind where the English girl
is flat and crude as a face painted on a playing card; she is
without depth, without range, without intricacy. But as we say this
we know that we have missed something. We have let the meaning of
the play slip through our hands. We have ignored the emotion which
has been accumulating because it has accumulated in places where we
have not expected to find it. We have been comparing the play with
prose, and the play, after all, is poetry.</p>

<p>The play is poetry, we say, and the novel prose. Let us attempt
to obliterate detail, and place the two before us side by side,
feeling, so far as we can, the angles and edges of each, recalling
each, so far as we are able, as a whole. Then, at once, the prime
differences emerge; the long leisurely accumulated novel; the
little contracted play; the emotion all split up, dissipated and
then woven together, slowly and gradually massed into a whole, in
the novel; the emotion concentrated, generalised, heightened in the
play. What moments of intensity, what phrases of astonishing beauty
the play shot at us!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>O, my lords,<br>
I but deceived your eyes with antic gesture,<br>
When one news straight came huddling on another<br>
Of death! and death! and death! still I danced forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have oft for these two lips<br>
Neglected cassia or the natural sweets<br>
Of the spring-violet: they are not yet much wither'd.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With all her reality, Anna Karenina could never say</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"You have oft for these two lips<br>
Neglected cassia".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the most profound of human emotions are therefore beyond
her reach. The extremes of passion are not for the novelist; the
perfect marriages of sense and sound are not for him; he must tame
his swiftness to sluggardry; keep his eyes on the ground, not on
the sky: suggest by description, not reveal by illumination.
Instead of singing</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lay a garland on my hearse<br>
Of the dismal yew;<br>
Maidens, willow branches bear;<br>
Say I died true,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>he must enumerate the chrysanthemums fading on the grave and the
undertakers' men snuffling past in their four-wheelers. How then
can we compare this lumbering and lagging art with poetry? Granted
all the little dexterities by which the novelist makes us know the
individual and recognise the real, the dramatist goes beyond the
single and the separate, shows us not Annabella in love, but love
itself; not Anna Karenina throwing herself under the train, but
ruin and death and the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...soul, like a ship in a black storm,<br>
...driven, I know not whither.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So with pardonable impatience we might exclaim as we shut our
Elizabethan play. But what then is the exclamation with which we
close <i>War and Peace?</i> Not one of disappointment; we are not
left lamenting the superficiality, upbraiding the triviality of the
novelist's art. Rather we are made more than ever aware of the
inexhaustible richness of human sensibility. Here, in the play, we
recognise the general; here, in the novel, the particular. Here we
gather all our energies into a bunch and spring. Here we extend and
expand and let come slowly in from all quarters deliberate
impressions, accumulated messages. The mind is so saturated with
sensibility, language so inadequate to its experience, that, far
from ruling off one form of literature or decreeing its inferiority
to others, we complain that they are still unable to keep pace with
the wealth of material, and wait impatiently the creation of what
may yet be devised to liberate us of the enormous burden of the
unexpressed.</p>

<p>Thus, in spite of dullness, bombast, rhetoric, and confusion, we
still read the lesser Elizabethans, still find ourselves
adventuring in the land of the jeweller and the unicorn. The
familiar factories of Liverpool fade into thin air and we scarcely
recognise any likeness between the knight who imported timber and
died of pneumonia at Muswell Hill and the Armenian Duke who fell
like a Roman on his sword while the owl shrieked in the ivy and the
Duchess gave birth to a still-born babe 'mongst women howling. To
join those territories and recognise the same man in different
disguises we have to adjust and revise. But make the necessary
alterations in perspective, draw in those filaments of sensibility
which the moderns have so marvellously developed, use instead the
ear and the eye which the moderns have so basely starved, hear
words as they are laughed and shouted, not as they are printed in
black letters on the page, see before your eyes the changing faces
and living bodies of men and women&mdash;put yourself, in short,
into a different but not more elementary stage of your reading
development and then the true merits of Elizabethan drama will
assert themselves. The power of the whole is undeniable. Theirs,
too, is the word-coining genius, as if thought plunged into a sea
of words and came up dripping. Theirs is that broad humour based
upon the nakedness of the body, which, however arduously the
public-spirited may try, is impossible since the body is draped.
Then at the back of this, imposing not unity but some sort of
stability, is what we may briefly call a sense of the presence of
the Gods. He would be a bold critic who should attempt to impose
any creed upon the swarm and variety of the Elizabethan dramatists,
and yet it implies some timidity if we take it for granted that a
whole literature with common characteristics is a mere evaporation
of high spirits, a money-making enterprise, a fluke of the mind
which, owing to favourable circumstances, came off successfully.
Even in the jungle and the wilderness the compass still points.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Lord, Lord, that I were dead!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>they are for ever crying.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>O thou soft natural death that art joint-twin<br>
To sweetest slumber&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pageant of the world is marvellous, but the pageant of the
world is vanity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>glories<br>
Of human greatness are but pleasing dreams<br>
And shadows soon decaying: on the stage<br>
Of my mortality my youth hath acted<br>
Some scenes of vanity&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To die and be quit of it all is their desire; the bell that
tolls throughout the drama is death and disenchantment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All life is but a wandering to find home,<br>
When we're gone, we're there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ruin, weariness, death, perpetually death, stand grimly to
confront the other presence of Elizabethan drama which is life:
life compact of frigates, fir trees and ivory, of dolphins and the
juice of July flowers, of the milk of unicorns and panthers'
breath, of ropes of pearl, brains of peacocks and Cretan wine. To
this, life at its most reckless and abundant, they reply</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man is a tree that hath no top in cares,<br>
No root in comforts; all his power to live<br>
Is given to no end but t' have power to grieve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is this echo flung back and back from the other side of the
play which, if it has not the name, still has the effect of the
presence of the Gods. So we ramble through the jungle, forest, and
wilderness of Elizabethan drama. So we consort with Emperors and
clowns, jewellers and unicorns, and laugh and exult and marvel at
the splendour and humour and fantasy of it all. A noble rage
consumes us when the curtain falls; we are bored too, and nauseated
by the wearisome old tricks and florid bombast. A dozen deaths of
full-grown men and women move us less than the suffering of one of
Tolstoi's flies. Wandering in the maze of the impossible and
tedious story suddenly some passionate intensity seizes us; some
sublimity exalts, or some melodious snatch of song enchants. It is
a world full of tedium and delight, pleasure and curiosity, of
extravagant laughter, poetry, and splendour. But gradually it comes
over us, what then are we being denied? What is it that we are
coming to want so persistently, that unless we get it instantly we
must seek elsewhere? It is solitude. There is no privacy here.
Always the door opens and some one comes in. All is shared, made
visible, audible, dramatic. Meanwhile, as if tired with company,
the mind steals off to muse in solitude; to think, not to act; to
comment, not to share; to explore its own darkness, not the
bright-lit-up surfaces of others. It turns to Donne, to Montaigne,
to Sir Thomas Browne, to the keepers of the keys of solitude.</p>

<h1><a name="C05" id="C05">MONTAIGNE</a>
</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once at Bar-le-Duc Montaigne saw a portrait which Ren&eacute;,
King of Sicily, had painted of himself, and asked, "Why is it not,
in like manner, lawful for every one to draw himself with a pen, as
he did with a crayon?" Off-hand one might reply, Not only is it
lawful, but nothing could be easier. Other people may evade us, but
our own features are almost too familiar. Let us begin. And then,
when we attempt the task, the pen falls from our fingers; it is a
matter of profound, mysterious, and overwhelming difficulty.</p>

<p>After all, in the whole of literature, how many people have
succeeded in drawing themselves with a pen? Only Montaigne and
Pepys and Rousseau perhaps. The <i>Religio Medici</i> is a coloured
glass through which darkly one sees racing stars and a strange and
turbulent soul. A bright polished mirror reflects the face of
Boswell peeping between other people's shoulders in the famous
biography. But this talking of oneself, following one's own
vagaries, giving the whole map, weight, colour, and circumference
of the soul in its confusion, its variety, its
imperfection&mdash;this art belonged to one man only: to Montaigne.
As the centuries go by, there is always a crowd before that
picture, gazing into its depths, seeing their own faces reflected
in it, seeing more the longer they look, never being able to say
quite what it is that they see. New editions testify to the
perennial fascination. Here is the Navarre Society in England
reprinting in five fine volumes<sup>1</sup> Cotton's translation;
while in France the firm of Louis Conard is issuing the complete
works of Montaigne with the various readings in an edition to which
Dr. Armaingaud has devoted a long lifetime of research.</p>

<p><sup>&nbsp;</sup>
</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <i>Essays of Montaigne,</i> translated by Charles
Cotton, 5 vols. The Navarre Society, &pound;6: 6s. net.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To tell the truth about oneself, to discover oneself near at
hand, is not easy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We hear of but two or three of the ancients who have beaten this
road [said Montaigne]. No one since has followed the track; 'tis a
rugged road, more so than it seems, to follow a pace so rambling
and uncertain, as that of the soul; to penetrate the dark
profundities of its intricate internal windings; to choose and lay
hold of so many little nimble motions; 'tis a new and extraordinary
undertaking, and that withdraws us from the common and most
recommended employments of the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is, in the first place, the difficulty of expression. We
all indulge in the strange, pleasant process called thinking, but
when it comes to saying, even to some one opposite, what we think,
then how little we are able to convey! The phantom is through the
mind and out of the window before we can lay salt on its tail, or
slowly sinking and returning to the profound darkness which it has
lit up momentarily with a wandering light. Face, voice, and accent
eke out our words and impress their feebleness with character in
speech. But the pen is a rigid instrument; it can say very little;
it has all kinds of habits and ceremonies of its own. It is
dictatorial too: it is always making ordinary men into prophets,
and changing the natural stumbling trip of human speech into the
solemn and stately march of pens. It is for this reason that
Montaigne stands out from the legions of the dead with such
irrepressible vivacity. We can never doubt for an instant that his
book was himself. He refused to teach; he refused to preach; he
kept on saying that he was just like other people. All his effort
was to write himself down, to communicate, to tell the truth, and
that is a "rugged road, more than it seems".</p>

<p>For beyond the difficulty of communicating oneself, there is the
supreme difficulty of being oneself. This soul, or life within us,
by no means agrees with the life outside us. If one has the courage
to ask her what she thinks, she is always saying the very opposite
to what other people say. Other people, for instance, long ago made
up their minds that old invalidish gentlemen ought to stay at home
and edify the rest of us by the spectacle of their connubial
fidelity. The soul of Montaigne said, on the contrary, that it is
in old age that one ought to travel, and marriage, which, rightly,
is very seldom founded on love, is apt to become, towards the end
of life, a formal tie better broken up. Again with politics,
statesmen are always praising the greatness of Empire, and
preaching the moral duty of civilising the savage. But look at the
Spanish in Mexico, cried Montaigne in a burst of rage. "So many
cities levelled with the ground, so many nations exterminated...and
the richest and most beautiful part of the world turned upside down
for the traffic of pearl and pepper! Mechanic victories!" And then
when the peasants came and told him that they had found a man dying
of wounds and deserted him for fear lest justice might incriminate
them, Montaigne asked:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What could I have said to these people? 'Tis certain that this
office of humanity would have brought them into trouble....There is
nothing so much, nor so grossly, nor so ordinarily faulty as the
laws.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here the soul, getting restive, is lashing out at the more
palpable forms of Montaigne's great bugbears, convention and
ceremony. But watch her as she broods over the fire in the inner
room of that tower which, though detached from the main building,
has so wide a view over the estate. Really she is the strangest
creature in the world, far from heroic, variable as a weathercock,
"bashful, insolent; chaste, lustful; prating, silent; laborious,
delicate; ingenious, heavy; melancholic, pleasant; lying, true;
knowing, ignorant; liberal, covetous, and prodigal"&mdash;in short,
so complex, so indefinite, corresponding so little to the version
which does duty for her in public, that a man might spend his life
merely in trying to run her to earth. The pleasure of the pursuit
more than rewards one for any damage that it may inflict upon one's
worldly prospects. The man who is aware of himself is henceforward
independent; and he is never bored, and life is only too short, and
he is steeped through and through with a profound yet temperate
happiness. He alone lives, while other people, slaves of ceremony,
let life slip past them in a kind of dream. Once conform, once do
what other people do because they do it, and a lethargy steals over
all the finer nerves and faculties of the soul. She becomes all
outer show and inward emptiness; dull, callous, and
indifferent.</p>

<p>Surely then, if we ask this great master of the art of life to
tell us his secret, he will advise us to withdraw to the inner room
of our tower and there turn the pages of books, pursue fancy after
fancy as they chase each other up the chimney, and leave the
government of the world to others. Retirement and
contemplation&mdash;these must be the main elements of his
prescription. But no; Montaigne is by no means explicit. It is
impossible to extract a plain answer from that subtle, half
smiling, half melancholy man, with the heavy-lidded eyes and the
dreamy, quizzical expression. The truth is that life in the
country, with one's books and vegetables and flowers, is often
extremely dull. He could never see that his own green peas were so
much better than other people's. Paris was the place he loved best
in the whole world&mdash;"jusques &agrave; ses verrues et &agrave;
ses taches". As for reading, he could seldom read any book for more
than an hour at a time, and his memory was so bad that he forgot
what was in his mind as he walked from one room to another. Book
learning is nothing to be proud of, and as for the achievements of
science, what do they amount to? He had always mixed with clever
men, and his father had a positive veneration for them, but he had
observed that, though they have their fine moments, their
rhapsodies, their visions, the cleverest tremble on the verge of
folly. Observe yourself: one moment you are exalted; the next a
broken glass puts your nerves on edge. All extremes are dangerous.
It is best to keep in the middle of the road, in the common ruts,
however muddy. In writing choose the common words; avoid rhapsody
and eloquence&mdash;yet, it is true, poetry is delicious; the best
prose is that which is most full of poetry.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that we are to aim at a democratic simplicity.
We may enjoy our room in the tower, with the painted walls and the
commodious bookcases, but down in the garden there is a man digging
who buried his father this morning, and it is he and his like who
live the real life and speak the real language. There is certainly
an element of truth in that. Things are said very finely at the
lower end of the table. There are perhaps more of the qualities
that matter among the ignorant than among the learned. But again,
what a vile thing the rabble is! "the mother of ignorance,
injustice, and inconstancy. Is it reasonable that the life of a
wise man should depend upon the judgment of fools?" Their minds are
weak, soft and without power of resistance. They must be told what
it is expedient for them to know. It is not for them to face facts
as they are. The truth can only be known by the well-born
soul&mdash;"l'&acirc;me bien n&eacute;e". Who, then, are these
well-born souls, whom we would imitate if only Montaigne would
enlighten us more precisely?</p>

<p>But no. "Je n'enseigne poinct; je raconte." After all, how could
he explain other people's souls when he could say nothing "entirely
simply and solidly, without confusion or mixture, in one word",
about his own, when indeed it became daily more and more in the
dark to him? One quality or principle there is perhaps&mdash;that
one must not lay down rules. The souls whom one would wish to
resemble, like Etienne de La Bo&eacute;tie, for example, are always
the supplest. "C'est estre, mais ce n'est pas vivre, que de se
tenir attach&eacute; et oblige par necessit&eacute; a un seul
train." The laws are mere conventions, utterly unable to keep touch
with the vast variety and turmoil of human impulses; habits and
customs are a convenience devised for the support of timid natures
who dare not allow their souls free play. But we, who have a
private life and hold it infinitely the dearest of our possessions,
suspect nothing so much as an attitude. Directly we begin to
protest, to attitudinise, to lay down laws, we perish. We are
living for others, not for ourselves. We must respect those who
sacrifice themselves in the public service, load them with honours,
and pity them for allowing, as they must, the inevitable
compromise; but for ourselves let us fly fame, honour, and all
offices that put us under an obligation to others. Let us simmer
over our incalculable cauldron, our enthralling confusion, our
hotch-potch of impulses, our perpetual miracle&mdash;for the soul
throws up wonders every second. Movement and change are the essence
of our being; rigidity is death; conformity is death: let us say
what comes into our heads, repeat ourselves, contradict ourselves,
fling out the wildest nonsense, and follow the most fantastic
fancies without caring what the world does or thinks or says. For
nothing matters except life; and, of course, order.</p>

<p>This freedom, then, which is the essence of our being, has to be
controlled. But it is difficult to see what power we are to invoke
to help us, since every restraint of private opinion or public law
has been derided, and Montaigne never ceases to pour scorn upon the
misery, the weakness, the vanity of human nature. Perhaps, then, it
will be well to turn to religion to guide us? "Perhaps" is one of
his favourite expressions; "perhaps" and "I think" and all those
words which qualify the rash assumptions of human ignorance. Such
words help one to muffle up opinions which it would be highly
impolitic to speak outright. For one does not say everything; there
are some things which at present it is advisable only to hint. One
writes for a very few people, who understand. Certainly, seek the
Divine guidance by all means, but meanwhile there is, for those who
live a private life, another monitor, an invisible censor within,
"un patron au dedans", whose blame is much more to be dreaded than
any other because he knows the truth; nor is there anything sweeter
than the chime of his approval. This is the judge to whom we must
submit; this is the censor who will help us to achieve that order
which is the grace of a well-born soul. For "C'est une vie exquise,
celle qui se maintient en ordre jusques en son priv&eacute;". But
he will act by his own light; by some internal balance will achieve
that precarious and everchanging poise which, while it controls, in
no way impedes the soul's freedom to explore and experiment.
Without other guide, and without precedent, undoubtedly it is far
more difficult to live well the private life than the public. It is
an art which each must learn separately, though there are, perhaps,
two or three men, like Homer, Alexander the Great, and Epaminondas
among the ancients, and Etienne de La Bo&eacute;tie among the
moderns, whose example may help us. But it is an art; and the very
material in which it works is variable and complex and infinitely
mysterious&mdash;human nature. To human nature we must keep close.
"...il faut vivre entre les vivants". We must dread any
eccentricity or refinement which cuts us off from our
fellow-beings. Blessed are those who chat easily with their
neighbours about their sport or their buildings or their quarrels,
and honestly enjoy the talk of carpenters and gardeners. To
communicate is our chief business; society and friendship our chief
delights; and reading, not to acquire knowledge, not to earn a
living, but to extend our intercourse beyond our own time and
province. Such wonders there are in the world; halcyons and
undiscovered lands, men with dogs' heads and eyes in their chests,
and laws and customs, it may well be, far superior to our own.
Possibly we are asleep in this world; possibly there is some other
which is apparent to beings with a sense which we now lack.</p>

<p>Here then, in spite of all contradictions and all
qualifications, is something definite. These essays are an attempt
to communicate a soul. On this point at least he is explicit. It is
not fame that he wants; it is not that men shall quote him in years
to come; he is setting up no statue in the market-place; he wishes
only to communicate his soul. Communication is health;
communication is truth; communication is happiness. To share is our
duty; to go down boldly and bring to light those hidden thoughts
which are the most diseased; to conceal nothing; to pretend
nothing; if we are ignorant to say so; if we love our friends to
let them know it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"...car, comme je scay par une trop certaine exp&eacute;rience,
il n'est aucune si douce consolation en la perte de nos amis que
celle que nous aporte la science de n'avoir rien oubli&eacute; a
leur dire et d'avoir eu avec eux une parfaite et enti&egrave;re
communication."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are people who, when they travel, wrap themselves up, "se
d&eacute;fendans de la contagion d'un air incogneu" in silence and
suspicion. When they dine they must have the same food they get at
home. Every sight and custom is bad unless it resembles those of
their own village. They travel only to return. That is entirely the
wrong way to set about it. We should start without any fixed idea
where we are going to spend the night, or when we propose to come
back; the journey is everything. Most necessary of all, but rarest
good fortune, we should try to find before we start some man of our
own sort who will go with us and to whom we can say the first thing
that comes into our heads. For pleasure has no relish unless we
share it. As for the risks&mdash;that we may catch cold or get a
headache&mdash;it is always worth while to risk a little illness
for the sake of pleasure. "Le plaisir est des principales
esp&egrave;ces du profit." Besides if we do what we like, we always
do what is good for us. Doctors and wise men may object, but let us
leave doctors and wise men to their own dismal philosophy. For
ourselves, who are ordinary men and women, let us return thanks to
Nature for her bounty by using every one of the senses she has
given us; vary our state as much as possible; turn now this side,
now that, to the warmth, and relish to the full before the sun goes
down the kisses of youth and the echoes of a beautiful voice
singing Catullus. Every season is likeable, and wet days and fine,
red wine and white, company and solitude. Even sleep, that
deplorable curtailment of the joy of life, can be full of dreams;
and the most common actions&mdash;a walk, a talk, solitude in one's
own orchard&mdash;can be enhanced and lit up by the association of
the mind. Beauty is everywhere, and beauty is only two
finger's-breadth from goodness. So, in the name of health and
sanity, let us not dwell on the end of the journey. Let death come
upon us planting our cabbages, or on horseback, or let us steal
away to some cottage and there let strangers close our eyes, for a
servant sobbing or the touch of a hand would break us down. Best of
all, let death find us at our usual occupations, among girls and
good fellows who make no protests, no lamentations; let him find us
"parmy les jeux, les festins, faceties, entretiens communs et
populaires, et la musique, et des vers amoureux". But enough of
death; it is life that matters.</p>

<p>It is life that emerges more and more clearly as these essays
reach not their end, but their suspension in full career. It is
life that becomes more and more absorbing as death draws near,
one's self, one's soul, every fact of existence: that one wears
silk stockings summer and winter; puts water in one's wine; has
one's hair cut after dinner; must have glass to drink from; has
never worn spectacles; has a loud voice; carries a switch in one's
hand; bites one's tongue; fidgets with one's feet; is apt to
scratch one's ears; likes meat to be high; rubs one's teeth with a
napkin (thank God, they are good!); must have curtains to one's
bed; and, what is rather curious, began by liking radishes, then
disliked them, and now likes them again. No fact is too little to
let it slip through one's fingers, and besides the interest of
facts themselves there is the strange power we have of changing
facts by the force of the imagination. Observe how the soul is
always casting her own lights and shadows; makes the substantial
hollow and the frail substantial; fills broad daylight with dreams;
is as much excited by phantoms as by reality; and in the moment of
death sports with a trifle. Observe, too, her duplicity, her
complexity. She hears of a friend's loss and sympathises, and yet
has a bitter-sweet malicious pleasure in the sorrows of others. She
believes; at the same time she does not believe. Observe her
extraordinary susceptibility to impressions, especially in youth. A
rich man steals because his father kept him short of money as a
boy. This wall one builds not for oneself, but because one's father
loved building. In short, the soul is all laced about with nerves
and sympathies which affect her every action, and yet, even now in
1580, no one has any clear knowledge&mdash;such cowards we are,
such lovers of the smooth conventional ways&mdash;how she works or
what she is except that of all things she is the most mysterious,
and one's self the greatest monster and miracle in the world.
"...plus je me hante et connois, plus ma difformit&eacute;
m'estonne, moins je m'entens en moy." Observe, observe perpetually,
and, so long as ink and paper exist, "sans cesse et sans travail"
Montaigne will write.</p>

<p>But there remains one final question which, if we could make him
look up from his enthralling occupation, we should like to put to
this great master of the art of life. In these extraordinary
volumes of short and broken, long and learned, logical and
contradictory statements, we have heard the very pulse and rhythm
of the soul, beating day after day, year after year, through a veil
which, as time goes on, fines itself almost to transparency. Here
is some one who succeeded in the hazardous enterprise of living;
who served his country and lived retired; was landlord, husband,
father; entertained kings, loved women, and mused for hours alone
over old books. By means of perpetual experiment and observation of
the subtlest he achieved at last a miraculous adjustment of all
these wayward parts that constitute the human soul. He laid hold of
the beauty of the world with all his fingers. He achieved
happiness. If he had had to live again, he said, he would have
lived the same life over. But, as we watch with absorbed interest
the enthralling spectacle of a soul living openly beneath our eyes,
the question frames itself, Is pleasure the end of all? Whence this
overwhelming interest in the nature of the soul? Why this
overmastering desire to communicate with others? Is the beauty of
this world enough, or is there, elsewhere, some explanation of the
mystery? To this what answer can there be? There is none. There is
only one more question: "Que scais-je?"</p>

<h1><a name="C06" id="C06">THE DUCHESS OF NEWCASTLE</a><sup>1</sup>
</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"...All I desire is fame ", wrote Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of
Newcastle. And while she lived her wish was granted. Garish in her
dress, eccentric in her habits, chaste in her conduct, coarse in
her speech, she succeeded during her lifetime in drawing upon
herself the ridicule of the great and the applause of the learned.
But the last echoes of that clamour have now all died away; she
lives only in the few splendid phrases that Lamb scattered upon her
tomb; her poems, her plays, her philosophies, her orations, her
discourses&mdash;all those folios and quartos in which, she
protested, her real life was shrined&mdash;moulder in the gloom of
public libraries, or are decanted into tiny thimbles which hold six
drops of their profusion. Even the curious student, inspired by the
words of Lamb, quails before the mass of her mausoleum, peers in,
looks about him, and hurries out again, shutting the door.</p>

<p><sup>&nbsp;</sup>
</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <i>The Life of William Cavendish, Duke of
Newcastle, Etc.,</i> edited by C. H. Firth; <i>Poems and
Fancies,</i> by the Duchess of Newcastle; <i>The World's Olio,
Orations of divers Sorts Accommodated to Divers Places; Female
Orations; Plays; Philosophical Letters,</i> etc., etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But that hasty glance has shown him the outlines of a memorable
figure. Born (it is conjectured) in 1624, Margaret was the youngest
child of a Thomas Lucas, who died when she was an infant, and her
upbringing was due to her mother, a lady of remarkable character,
of majestic grandeur and beauty "beyond the ruin of time". "She was
very skilful in leases, and setting of lands and court keeping,
ordering of stewards, and the like affairs." The wealth which thus
accrued she spent, not on marriage portions, but on generous and
delightful pleasures, "out of an opinion that if she bred us with
needy necessity it might chance to create in us sharking
qualities". Her eight sons and daughters were never beaten, but
reasoned with, finely and gaily dressed, and allowed no
conversation with servants, not because they are servants but
because servants "are for the most part ill-bred as well as meanly
born". The daughters were taught the usual accomplishments "rather
for formality than for benefit", it being their mother's opinion
that character, happiness, and honesty were of greater value to a
woman than fiddling and singing, or "the prating of several
languages".</p>

<p>Already Margaret was eager to take advantage of such indulgence
to gratify certain tastes. Already she liked reading better than
needlework, dressing and "inventing fashions" better than reading,
and writing best of all. Sixteen paper books of no title, written
in straggling letters, for the impetuosity of her thought always
outdid the pace of her fingers, testify to the use she made of her
mother's liberality. The happiness of their home life had other
results as well. They were a devoted family. Long after they were
married, Margaret noted, these handsome brothers and sisters, with
their well-proportioned bodies, their clear complexions, brown
hair, sound teeth, "tunable voices", and plain way of speaking,
kept themselves "in a flock together". The presence of strangers
silenced them. But when they were alone, whether they walked in
Spring Gardens or Hyde Park, or had music, or supped in barges upon
the water, their tongues were loosed and they made "very merry
amongst themselves,...judging, condemning, approving, commending,
as they thought good".</p>

<p>The happy family life had its effect upon Margaret's character.
As a child, she would walk for hours alone, musing and
contemplating and reasoning with herself of "everything her senses
did present". She took no pleasure in activity of any kind. Toys
did not amuse her, and she could neither learn foreign languages
nor dress as other people did. Her great pleasure was to invent
dresses for herself, which nobody else was to copy, "for", she
remarks, "I always took delight in a singularity, even in
accoutrements of habits".</p>

<p>Such a training, at once so cloistered and so free, should have
bred a lettered old maid, glad of her seclusion, and the writer
perhaps of some volume of letters or translations from the
classics, which we should still quote as proof of the cultivation
of our ancestresses. But there was a wild streak in Margaret, a
love of finery and extravagance and fame, which was for ever
upsetting the orderly arrangements of nature. When she heard that
the Queen, since the outbreak of the Civil War, had fewer
maids-of-honour than usual, she had "a great desire" to become one
of them. Her mother let her go against the judgement of the rest of
the family, who, knowing that she had never left home and had
scarcely been beyond their sight, justly thought that she might
behave at Court to her disadvantage. "Which indeed I did," Margaret
confessed; "for I was so bashful when I was out of my mother's,
brothers', and sisters' sight that...I durst neither look up with
my eyes, nor speak, nor be any way sociable, insomuch as I was
thought a natural fool." The courtiers laughed at her; and she
retaliated in the obvious way. People were censorious; men were
jealous of brains in a woman; women suspected intellect in their
own sex; and what other lady, she might justly ask, pondered as she
walked on the nature of matter and whether snails have teeth? But
the laughter galled her, and she begged her mother to let her come
home. This being refused, wisely as the event turned out, she
stayed on for two years (1643-45), finally going with the Queen to
Paris, and there, among the exiles who came to pay their respects
to the Court, was the Marquis of Newcastle. To the general
amazement, the princely nobleman, who had led the King's forces to
disaster with indomitable courage but little skill, fell in love
with the shy, silent, strangely dressed maid-of-honour. It was not
"amorous love, but honest, honourable love", according to Margaret.
She was no brilliant match; she had gained a reputation for prudery
and eccentricity. What, then, could have made so great a nobleman
fall at her feet? The onlookers were full of derision,
disparagement, and slander. "I fear", Margaret wrote to the
Marquis, "others foresee we shall be unfortunate, though we see it
not ourselves, or else there would not be such pains to untie the
knot of our affections." Again, "Saint Germains is a place of much
slander, and thinks I send too often to you". "Pray consider", she
warned him, "that I have enemies." But the match was evidently
perfect. The Duke, with his love of poetry and music and
play-writing, his interest in philosophy, his belief "that nobody
knew or could know the cause of anything", his romantic and
generous temperament, was naturally drawn to a woman who wrote
poetry herself, was also a philosopher of the same way of thinking,
and lavished upon him not only the admiration of a fellow-artist,
but the gratitude of a sensitive creature who had been shielded and
succoured by his extraordinary magnanimity. "He did approve", she
wrote, "of those bashful fears which many condemned,...and though I
did dread marriage and shunned men's company as much as I could,
yet I...had not the power to refuse him." She kept him company
during the long years of exile; she entered with sympathy, if not
with understanding, into the conduct and acquirements of those
horses which he trained to such perfection that the Spaniards
crossed themselves and cried "Miraculo!" as they witnessed their
corvets, voltoes, and pirouettes; she believed that the horses even
made a "trampling action" for joy when he came into the stables;
she pleaded his cause in England during the Protectorate; and, when
the Restoration made it possible for them to return to England,
they lived together in the depths of the country in the greatest
seclusion and perfect contentment, scribbling plays, poems,
philosophies, greeting each other's works with raptures of delight,
and confabulating, doubtless, upon such marvels of the natural
world as chance threw their way. They were laughed at by their
contemporaries; Horace Walpole sneered at them. But there can be no
doubt that they were perfectly happy.</p>

<p>For now Margaret could apply herself uninterruptedly to her
writing. She could devise fashions for herself and her servants.
She could scribble more and more furiously with fingers that became
less and less able to form legible letters. She could even achieve
the miracle of getting her plays acted in London and her
philosophies humbly perused by men of learning. There they stand,
in the British Museum, volume after volume, swarming with a
diffused, uneasy, contorted vitality. Order, continuity, the
logical development of her argument are all unknown to her. No
fears impede her. She has the irresponsibility of a child and the
arrogance of a Duchess. The wildest fancies come to her, and she
canters away on their backs. We seem to hear her, as the thoughts
boil and bubble, calling to John, who sat with a pen in his hand
next door, to come quick, "John, John, I conceive!" And down it
goes&mdash;whatever it may be; sense or nonsense; some thought on
women's education&mdash;"Women live like Bats or Owls, labour like
Beasts, and die like Worms,...the best bred women are those whose
minds are civilest"; some speculation that had struck her, perhaps,
walking that afternoon alone&mdash;why "hogs have the measles", why
"dogs that rejoice swing their tails", or what the stars are made
of, or what this chrysalis is that her maid has brought her, and
she keeps warm in a corner of her room. On and on, from subject to
subject she flies, never stopping to correct, "for there is more
pleasure in making than in mending", talking aloud to herself of
all those matters that filled her brain to her perpetual
diversion&mdash;of wars, and boarding-schools, and cutting down
trees, of grammar and morals, of monsters and the British, whether
opium in small quantities is good for lunatics, why it is that
musicians are mad. Looking upwards, she speculates still more
ambitiously upon the nature of the moon, and if the stars are
blazing jellies; looking downwards she wonders if the fishes know
that the sea is salt; opines that our heads are full of fairies,
"dear to God as we are"; muses whether there are not other worlds
than ours, and reflects that the next ship may bring us word of a
new one. In short, "we are in utter darkness". Meanwhile, what a
rapture is thought!</p>

<p>As the vast books appeared from the stately retreat at Welbeck
the usual censors made the usual objections, and had to be
answered, despised, or argued with, as her mood varied, in the
preface to every work. They said, among other things, that her
books were not her own, because she used learned terms, and "wrote
of many matters outside her ken". She flew to her husband for help,
and he answered, characteristically, that the Duchess "had never
conversed with any professed scholar in learning except her brother
and myself ". The Duke's scholarship, moreover, was of a peculiar
nature. "I have lived in the great world a great while, and have
thought of what has been brought to me by the senses, more than was
put into me by learned discourse; for I do not love to be led by
the nose, by authority, and old authors; <i>ipse dixit</i> will not
serve my turn." And then she takes up the pen and proceeds, with
the importunity and indiscretion of a child, to assure the world
that her ignorance is of the finest quality imaginable. She has
only seen Des Cartes and Hobbes, not questioned them; she did
indeed ask Mr. Hobbes to dinner, but he could not come; she often
does not listen to a word that is said to her; she does not know
any French, though she lived abroad for five years; she has only
read the old philosophers in Mr. Stanley's account of them; of Des
Cartes she has read but half of his work on Passion; and of Hobbes
only "the little book called <i>De Cive</i>", all of which is
infinitely to the credit of her native wit, so abundant that
outside succour pained it, so honest that it would not accept help
from others. It was from the plain of complete ignorance, the
untilled field of her own consciousness, that she proposed to erect
a philosophic system that was to oust all others. The results were
not altogether happy. Under the pressure of such vast structures,
her natural gift, the fresh and delicate fancy which had led her in
her first volume to write charmingly of Queen Mab and fairyland,
was crushed out of existence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The palace of the Queen wherein she dwells,<br>
Its fabric's built all of hodmandod shells;<br>
The hangings of a Rainbow made that's thin,<br>
Shew wondrous fine, when one first enters in;<br>
The chambers made of Amber that is clear,<br>
Do give a fine sweet smell, if fire be near;<br>
Her bed a cherry stone, is carved throughout,<br>
And with a butterfly's wing hung about;<br>
Her sheets are of the skin of Dove's eyes made<br>
Where on a violet bud her pillow's laid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So she could write when she was young. But her fairies, if they
survived at all, grew up into hippopotami. Too generously her
prayer was granted:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Give me the free and noble style,<br>
Which seems uncurb'd, though it be wild.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She became capable of involutions, and contortions and conceits
of which the following is among the shortest, but not the most
terrific:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The human head may be likened to a town:<br>
The mouth when full, begun<br>
Is market day, when empty, market's done;<br>
The city conduct, where the water flows,<br>
Is with two spouts, the nostrils and the nose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She similised, energetically, incongruously, eternally; the sea
became a meadow, the sailors shepherds, the mast a maypole. The fly
was the bird of summer, trees were senators, houses ships, and even
the fairies, whom she loved better than any earthly thing, except
the Duke, are changed into blunt atoms and sharp atoms, and take
part in some of those horrible manoeuvres in which she delighted to
marshal the universe. Truly, "my Lady Sanspareille hath a strange
spreading wit". Worse still, without an atom of dramatic power, she
turned to play-writing. It was a simple process. The unwieldly
thoughts which turned and tumbled within her were christened Sir
Golden Riches, Moll Meanbred, Sir Puppy Dogman, and the rest, and
sent revolving in tedious debate upon the parts of the soul, or
whether virtue is better than riches, round a wise and learned lady
who answered their questions and corrected their fallacies at
considerable length in tones which we seem to have heard
before.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, the Duchess walked abroad. She would issue
out in her own proper person, dressed in a thousand gems and
furbelows, to visit the houses of the neighbouring gentry. Her pen
made instant report of these excursions. She recorded how Lady C.
R. "did beat her husband in a public assembly"; Sir F. O. "I am
sorry to hear hath undervalued himself so much below his birth and
wealth as to marry his kitchen-maid"; "Miss P. I. has become a
sanctified soul, a spiritual sister, she has left curling her hair,
black patches are become abominable to her, laced shoes and
Galoshoes are steps to pride&mdash;she asked me what posture I
thought was the best to be used in prayer". Her answer was probably
unacceptable. "I shall not rashly go there again", she says of one
such "gossip-making". She was not, we may hazard, a welcome guest
or an altogether hospitable hostess. She had a way of "bragging of
myself" which frightened visitors so that they left, nor was she
sorry to see them go. Indeed, Welbeck was the best place for her,
and her own company the most congenial, with the amiable Duke
wandering in and out, with his plays and his speculations, always
ready to answer a question or refute a slander. Perhaps it was this
solitude that led her, chaste as she was in conduct, to use
language which in time to come much perturbed Sir Egerton Brydges.
She used, he complained, "expressions and images of extraordinary
coarseness as flowing from a female of high rank brought up in
courts". He forgot that this particular female had long ceased to
frequent the Court; she consorted chiefly with fairies; and her
friends were among the dead. Naturally, then, her language was
coarse. Nevertheless, though her philosophies are futile, and her
plays intolerable, and her verses mainly dull, the vast bulk of the
Duchess is leavened by a vein of authentic fire. One cannot help
following the lure of her erratic and lovable personality as it
meanders and twinkles through page after page. There is something
noble and Quixotic and high-spirited, as well as crack-brained and
bird-witted, about her. Her simplicity is so open; her intelligence
so active; her sympathy with fairies and animals so true and
tender. She has the freakishness of an elf, the irresponsibility of
some non-human creature, its heartlessness, and its charm. And
although "they", those terrible critics who had sneered and jeered
at her ever since, as a shy girl, she had not dared look her
tormentors in the face at Court, continued to mock, few of her
critics, after all, had the wit to trouble about the nature of the
universe, or cared a straw for the sufferings of the hunted hare,
or longed, as she did, to talk to some one "of Shakespeare's
fools". Now, at any rate, the laugh is not all on their side.</p>

<p>But laugh they did. When the rumour spread that the crazy
Duchess was coming up from Welbeck to pay her respects at Court,
people crowded the streets to look at her, and the curiosity of Mr.
Pepys twice brought him to wait in the Park to see her pass. But
the pressure of the crowd about her coach was too great. He could
only catch a glimpse of her in her silver coach with her footmen
all in velvet, a velvet cap on her head, and her hair about her
ears. He could only see for a moment between the white curtains the
face of "a very comely woman", and on she drove through the crowd
of staring Cockneys, all pressing to catch a glimpse of that
romantic lady, who stands, in the picture at Welbeck, with large
melancholy eyes, and something fastidious and fantastic in her
bearing, touching a table with the tips of long pointed fingers, in
the calm assurance of immortal fame.</p>

<p>Should you wish to make sure that your birthday will be
celebrated three hundred years hence, your best course is
undoubtedly to keep a diary. Only first be certain that you have
the courage to lock your genius in a private book and the humour to
gloat over a fame that will be yours only in the grave. For the
good diarist writes either for himself alone or for a posterity so
distant that it can safely hear every secret and justly weigh every
motive. For such an audience there is need neither of affectation
nor of restraint. Sincerity is what they ask, detail, and volume;
skill with the pen comes in conveniently, but brilliance is not
necessary; genius is a hindrance even; and should you know your
business and do it manfully, posterity will let you off mixing with
great men, reporting famous affairs, or having lain with the first
ladies in the land.</p>

<p>The diary, for whose sake we are remembering the three hundredth
anniversary of the birth of John Evelyn,<sup>1</sup> is a case in
point. It is sometimes composed like a memoir, sometimes jotted
down like a calendar; but he never used its pages to reveal the
secrets of his heart, and all that he wrote might have been read
aloud in the evening with a calm conscience to his children. If we
wonder, then, why we still trouble to read what we must consider
the uninspired work of a good man we have to confess, first that
diaries are always diaries, books, that is, that we read in
convalescence, on horseback, in the grip of death; second, that
this reading, about which so many fine things have been said, is
for the most part mere dreaming and idling; lying in a chair with a
book; watching the butterflies on the dahlias; a profitless
occupation which no critic has taken the trouble to investigate,
and on whose behalf only the moralist can find a good word to say.
For he will allow it to be an innocent employment; and happiness,
he will add, though derived from trivial sources, has probably done
more to prevent human beings from changing their religions and
killing their kings than either philosophy or the pulpit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Written in 1920.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It may be well, indeed, before reading much further in Evelyn's
book, to decide where it is that our modern view of happiness
differs from his. Ignorance, surely, ignorance is at the bottom of
it; his ignorance and our comparative erudition. No one can read
the story of Evelyn's foreign travels without envying in the first
place his simplicity of mind, in the second his activity. To take a
simple example of the difference between us&mdash;that butterfly
will sit motionless on the dahlia while the gardener trundles his
barrow past it, but let him flick the wings with the shadow of a
rake, and off it flies, up it goes, instantly on the alert. So, we
may reflect, a butterfly sees but does not hear; and here no doubt
we are much on a par with Evelyn. But as for going into the house
to fetch a knife and with that knife dissecting a Red Admiral's
head, as Evelyn would have done, no sane person in the twentieth
century would entertain such a project for a second. Individually
we may know as little as Evelyn, but collectively we know so much
that there is little incentive to venture on private discoveries.
We seek the encyclop&aelig;dia, not the scissors; and know in two
minutes not only more than was known to Evelyn in his lifetime, but
that the mass of knowledge is so vast that it is scarcely worth
while to possess a single crumb. Ignorant, yet justly confident
that with his own hands he might advance not merely his private
knowledge but the knowledge of mankind, Evelyn dabbled in all the
arts and sciences, ran about the Continent for ten years, gazed
with unflagging gusto upon hairy women and rational dogs, and drew
inferences and framed speculations which are now only to be matched
by listening to the talk of old women round the village pump. The
moon, they say, is so much larger than usual this autumn that no
mushrooms will grow, and the carpenter's wife will be brought to
bed of twins. So Evelyn, Fellow of the Royal Society, a gentleman
of the highest culture and intelligence, carefully noted all comets
and portents, and thought it a sinister omen when a whale came up
the Thames. In 1658, too, a whale had been seen. "That year died
Cromwell." Nature, it seems, was determined to stimulate the
devotion of her seventeenth-century admirers by displays of
violence and eccentricity from which she now refrains. There were
storms, floods, and droughts; the Thames frozen hard; comets
flaring in the sky. If a cat so much as kittened in Evelyn's bed
the kitten was inevitably gifted with eight legs, six ears, two
bodies, and two tails.</p>

<p>But to return to happiness. It sometimes appears that if there
is an insoluble difference between our ancestors and ourselves it
is that we draw our happiness from different sources. We rate the
same things at different values. Something of this we may ascribe
to their ignorance and our knowledge. But are we to suppose that
ignorance alters the nerves and the affections? Are we to believe
that it would have been an intolerable penance for us to live
familiarly with the Elizabethans? Should we have found it necessary
to leave the room because of Shakespeare's habits, and to have
refused Queen Elizabeth's invitation to dinner? Perhaps so. For
Evelyn was a sober man of unusual refinement, and yet he pressed
into a torture chamber as we crowd to see the lions fed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...they first bound his wrists with a strong rope or small
cable, and one end of it to an iron ring made fast to the wall
about four feet from the floor, and then his feet with another
cable, fastened about five feet farther than his utmost length to
another ring on the floor of the room. Thus suspended, and yet
lying but aslant, they slid a horse of wood under the rope which
bound his feet, which so exceedingly stiffened it, as severed the
fellow's joints in miserable sort, drawing him out at length in an
extraordinary manner, he having only a pair of linen drawers upon
his naked body ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And so on. Evelyn watched this to the end, and then remarked
that "the spectacle was so uncomfortable that I was not able to
stay the sight of another", as we might say that the lions growl so
loud and the sight of raw meat is so unpleasant that we will now
visit the penguins. Allowing for his discomfort, there is enough
discrepancy between his view of pain and ours to make us wonder
whether we see any fact with the same eyes, marry any woman from
the same motives, or judge any conduct by the same standards. To
sit passive when muscles tore and bones cracked, not to flinch when
the wooden horse was raised higher and the executioner fetched a
horn and poured two buckets of water down the man's throat, to
suffer this iniquity on a suspicion of robbery which the man
denied&mdash;all this seems to put Evelyn in one of those cages
where we still mentally seclude the riff-raff of Whitechapel. Only
it is obvious that we have somehow got it wrong. If we could
maintain that our susceptibility to suffering and love of justice
were proof that all our humane instincts were as highly developed
as these, then we could say that the world improves, and we with
it. But let us get on with the diary.</p>

<p>In 1652, when it seemed that things had settled down unhappily
enough, "all being entirely in the rebels' hands", Evelyn returned
to England with his wife, his Tables of Veins and Arteries, his
Venetian glass and the rest of his curiosities, to lead the life of
a country gentleman of strong Royalist sympathies at Deptford. What
with going to church and going to town, settling his accounts and
planting his garden&mdash;"I planted the orchard at Sayes Court;
new moon, wind west"&mdash;his time was spent much as ours is. But
there was one difference which it is difficult to illustrate by a
single quotation, because the evidence is scattered all about in
little insignificant phrases. The general effect of them is that he
used his eyes. The visible world was always close to him. The
visible world has receded so far from us that to hear all this talk
of buildings and gardens, statues and carving, as if the look of
things assailed one out of doors as well as in, and were not
confined to a few small canvases hung upon the wall, seems strange.
No doubt there are a thousand excuses for us; but hitherto we have
been finding excuses for him. Wherever there was a picture to be
seen by Julio Romano, Polydore, Guido, Raphael, or Tintoretto, a
finely built house, a prospect, or a garden nobly designed, Evelyn
stopped his coach to look at it, and opened his diary to record his
opinion. On August 27, Evelyn, with Dr. Wren and others, was in St.
Paul's surveying "the general decay of that ancient and venerable
church"; held with Dr. Wren another judgement from the rest; and
had a mind to build it with "a noble cupola, a form of church
building not as yet known in England but of wonderful grace", in
which Dr. Wren concurred. Six days later the Fire of London altered
their plans. It was Evelyn again who, walking by himself, chanced
to look in at the window of "a poor solitary thatched house in a
field in our parish", there saw a young man carving at a crucifix,
was overcome with an enthusiasm which does him the utmost credit,
and carried Grinling Gibbons and his carving to Court.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is all very well to be scrupulous about the
sufferings of worms and sensitive to the dues of servant girls, but
how pleasant also if, with shut eyes, one could call up street
after street of beautiful houses. A flower is red; the apples
rosy-gilt in the afternoon sun; a picture has charm, especially as
it displays the character of a grandfather and dignifies a family
descended from such a scowl; but these are scattered
fragments&mdash;little relics of beauty in a world that has grown
indescribably drab. To our charge of cruelty Evelyn might well
reply by pointing to Bayswater and the purlieus of Clapham; and if
he should assert that nothing now has character or conviction, that
no farmer in England sleeps with an open coffin at his bedside to
remind him of death, we could not retort effectually offhand. True,
we like the country. Evelyn never looked at the sky.</p>

<p>But to return. After the Restoration Evelyn emerged in full
possession of a variety of accomplishments which in our time of
specialists seems remarkable enough. He was employed on public
business; he was Secretary to the Royal Society; he wrote plays and
poems; he was the first authority upon trees and gardens in
England; he submitted a design for the rebuilding of London; he
went into the question of smoke and its abatement&mdash;the lime
trees in St. James's Park being, it is said, the result of his
cogitations; he was commissioned to write a history of the Dutch
war&mdash;in short, he completely outdid the Squire of "The
Princess", whom in many respects he anticipated&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lord of fat prize-oxen and of sheep,<br>
A raiser of huge melons and of pine,<br>
A patron of some thirty charities,<br>
A pamphleteer on guano and on grain,<br>
A quarter-sessions chairman abler none.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All that he was, and shared with Sir Walter another
characteristic which Tennyson does not mention. He was, we cannot
help suspecting, something of a bore, a little censorious, a little
patronising, a little too sure of his own merits, and a little
obtuse to those of other people. Or what is the quality, or absence
of quality, that checks our sympathies? Partly, perhaps, it is due
to some inconsistency which it would be harsh to call by so strong
a name as hypocrisy. Though he deplored the vices of his age he
could never keep away from the centre of them. "The luxurious
dallying and profaneness" of the Court, the sight of "Mrs. Nelly"
looking over her garden Wall and holding "very familiar discourse"
with King Charles on the green walk below, caused him acute
disgust; yet he could never decide to break with the Court and
retire to "my poor but quiet villa", which was of course the apple
of his eye and one of the show-places in England. Then, though he
loved his daughter Mary, his grief at her death did not prevent him
from counting the number of empty coaches drawn by six horses
apiece that attended her funeral. His women friends combined virtue
with beauty to such an extent that we can hardly credit them with
wit into the bargain. Poor Mrs. Godolphin at least, whom he
celebrated in a sincere and touching biography, "loved to be at
funerals" and chose habitually "the dryest and leanest morsels of
meat", which may be the habits of an angel but do not present her
friendship with Evelyn in an alluring light. But it is Pepys who
sums up our case against Evelyn; Pepys who said of him after a long
morning's entertainment: "In fine a most excellent person he is and
must be allowed a little for a little conceitedness; but he may
well be so, being a man so much above others". The words exactly
hit the mark, "A most excellent person he was"; but a little
conceited.</p>

<p>Pepys it is who prompts us to another reflection, inevitable,
unnecessary, perhaps unkind. Evelyn was no genius. His writing is
opaque rather than transparent; we see no depths through it, nor
any very secret movements of mind or heart. He can neither make us
hate a regicide nor love Mrs. Godolphin beyond reason. But he
writes a diary; and he writes it supremely well. Even as we drowse,
somehow or other the bygone gentleman sets up, through three
centuries, a perceptible tingle of communication, so that without
laying stress on anything in particular, stopping to dream,
stopping to laugh, stopping merely to look, we are yet taking
notice all the time. His garden, for example&mdash;how delightful
is his disparagement of it, and how acid his criticism of the
gardens of others. Then, we may be sure, the hens at Sayes Court
laid the very best eggs in England; and when the Tsar drove a
wheelbarrow through his hedge, what a catastrophe it was; and we
can guess how Mrs. Evelyn dusted and polished; and how Evelyn
himself grumbled; and how punctilious and efficient and trustworthy
he was; how ready to give advice; how ready to read his own works
aloud; and how affectionate, withal, lamenting bitterly, but not
effusively&mdash;for the man with the long-drawn sensitive face was
never that&mdash;the death of the little prodigy Richard, and
recording how "after evening prayers was my child buried near the
rest of his brothers&mdash;my very dear children". He was not an
artist; no phrases linger in the mind; no paragraphs build
themselves up in memory; but as an artistic method this of going on
with the day's story circumstantially, bringing in people who will
never be mentioned again, leading up to crises which never take
place, introducing Sir Thomas Browne but never letting him speak,
has its fascination. All through his pages good men, bad men,
celebrities, nonentities are coming into the room and going out
again. The greater number we scarcely notice; the door shuts upon
them and they disappear. But now and again the sight of a vanishing
coat-tail suggests more than a whole figure sitting still in a full
light. Perhaps it is that we catch them unawares. Little they think
that for three hundred years and more they will be looked at in the
act of jumping a gate, or observing, like the old Marquis of
Argyle, that the turtle doves in the aviary are owls. Our eyes
wander from one to the other; our affections settle here or
there&mdash;on hot-tempered Captain Wray, for instance, who was
choleric, had a dog that killed a goat, was for shooting the goat's
owner, was for shooting his horse when it fell down a precipice; on
M. Saladine; on M. Saladine's daughter; on Captain Wray lingering
at Geneva to make love to M. Saladine's daughter; on Evelyn himself
most of all, grown old, walking in his garden at Wotton, his
sorrows smoothed out, his grandson doing him credit, the Latin
quotations falling pat from his lips, his trees flourishing, and
the butterflies flying and flaunting on his dahlias too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fear which attacks the recorder of centenaries lest he
should find himself measuring a diminishing spectre and forced to
foretell its approaching dissolution is not only absent in the case
of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> but the mere thought of it is ridiculous.
It may be true that <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is two hundred years of
age upon the twenty-fifth of April 1919, but far from raising the
familiar speculations as to whether people now read it and will
continue to read it, the effect of the bi-centenary is to make us
marvel that <i>Robinson Crusoe,</i> the perennial and immortal,
should have been in existence so short a time as that. The book
resembles one of the anonymous productions of the race rather than
the effort of a single mind; and as for celebrating its centenary
we should as soon think of celebrating the centenaries of
Stonehenge itself. Something of this we may attribute to the fact
that we have all had <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> read aloud to us as
children, and were thus much in the same state of mind towards
Defoe and his story that the Greeks were in towards Homer. It never
occurred to us that there was such a person as Defoe, and to have
been told that <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> was the work of a man with a
pen in his hand would either have disturbed us unpleasantly or
meant nothing at all. The impressions of childhood are those that
last longest and cut deepest. It still seems that the name of
Daniel Defoe has no right to appear upon the title-page of
<i>Robinson Crusoe,</i> and if we celebrate the bi-centenary of the
book we are making a slightly unnecessary allusion to the fact
that, like Stonehenge, it is still in existence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Written 1919.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The great fame of the book has done its author some injustice;
for while it has given him a kind of anonymous glory it has
obscured the fact that he was a writer of other works which, it is
safe to assert, were not read aloud to us as children. Thus when
the Editor of the <i>Christian World</i> in the year 1870 appealed
to "the boys and girls of England" to erect a monument upon the
grave of Defoe, which a stroke of lightning had mutilated, the
marble was inscribed to the memory of the author of <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i>. No mention was made of <i>Moll Flanders.</i>
Considering the topics which are dealt with in that book, and in
<i>Roxana, Captain Singleton, Colonel Jack</i> and the rest, we
need not be surprised, though we may be indignant, at the omission.
We may agree with Mr. Wright, the biographer of Defoe, that these
"are not works for the drawing-room table". But unless we consent
to make that useful piece of furniture the final arbiter of taste,
we must deplore the fact that their superficial coarseness, or the
universal celebrity of <i>Robinson Crusoe,</i> has led them to be
far less widely famed than they deserve. On any monument worthy of
the name of monument the names of <i>Moll Flanders</i> and
<i>Roxana,</i> at least, should be carved as deeply as the name of
Defoe. They stand among the few English novels which we can call
indisputably great. The occasion of the bicentenary of their more
famous companion may well lead us to consider in what their
greatness, which has so much in common with his, may be found to
consist.</p>

<p>Defoe was an elderly man when he turned novelist, many years the
predecessor of Richardson and Fielding, and one of the first indeed
to shape the novel and launch it on its way. But it is unnecessary
to labour the fact of his precedence, except that he came to his
novel-writing with certain conceptions about the art which he
derived partly from being himself one of the first to practise it.
The novel had to justify its existence by telling a true story and
preaching a sound moral. "This supplying a story by invention is
certainly a most scandalous crime", he wrote. "It is a sort of
lying that makes a great hole in the heart, in which by degrees a
habit of lying enters in." Either in the preface or in the text of
each of his works, therefore, he takes pains to insist that he has
not used his invention at all but has depended upon facts, and that
his purpose has been the highly moral desire to convert the vicious
or to warn the innocent. Happily these were principles that tallied
very well with his natural disposition and endowments. Facts had
been drilled into him by sixty years of varying fortunes before he
turned his experience to account in fiction. "I have some time ago
summed up the Scenes of my life in this distich," he wrote:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No man has tasted differing fortunes more,<br>
And thirteen times I have been rich and poor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He had spent eighteen months in Newgate and talked with thieves,
pirates, highwaymen, and coiners before he wrote the history of
Moll Flanders. But to have facts thrust upon you by dint of living
and accident is one thing; to swallow them voraciously and retain
the imprint of them indelibly, is another. It is not merely that
Defoe knew the stress of poverty and had talked with the victims of
it, but that the unsheltered life, exposed to circumstances and
forced to shift for itself, appealed to him imaginatively as the
right matter for his art. In the first pages of each of his great
novels he reduces his hero or heroine to such a state of unfriended
misery that their existence must be a continued struggle, and their
survival at all the result of luck and their own exertions. Moll
Flanders was born in Newgate of a criminal mother; Captain
Singleton was stolen as a child and sold to the gipsies; Colonel
Jack, though "born a gentleman, was put 'prentice to a pickpocket";
Roxana starts under better auspices, but, having married at
fifteen, she sees her husband go bankrupt and is left with five
children in "a condition the most deplorable that words can
express".</p>

<p>Thus each of these boys and girls has the world to begin and the
battle to fight for himself. The situation thus created was
entirely to Defoe's liking. From her very birth or with half a
year's respite at most, Moll Flanders, the most notable of them, is
goaded by "that worst of devils, poverty", forced to earn her
living as soon as she can sew, driven from place to place, making
no demands upon her creator for the subtle domestic atmosphere
which he was unable to supply, but drawing upon him for all he knew
of strange people and customs. From the outset the burden of
proving her right to exist is laid upon her. She has to depend
entirely upon her own wits and judgement, and to deal with each
emergency as it arises by a rule-of-thumb morality which she has
forged in her own head. The briskness of the story is due partly to
the fact that having transgressed the accepted laws at a very early
age she has henceforth the freedom of the outcast. The one
impossible event is that she should settle down in comfort and
security. But from the first the peculiar genius of the author
asserts itself, and avoids the obvious danger of the novel of
adventure. He makes us understand that Moll Flanders was a woman on
her own account and not only material for a succession of
adventures. In proof of this she begins, as Roxana also begins, by
falling passionately, if unfortunately, in love. That she must
rouse herself and marry some one else and look very closely to her
settlements and prospects is no slight upon her passion, but to be
laid to the charge of her birth; and, like all Defoe's women, she
is a person of robust understanding. Since she makes no scruple of
telling lies when they serve her purpose, there is something
undeniable about her truth when she speaks it. She has no time to
waste upon the refinements of personal affection; one tear is
dropped, one moment of despair allowed, and then "on with the
story". She has a spirit that loves to breast the storm. She
delights in the exercise of her own powers. When she discovers that
the man she has married in Virginia is her own brother she is
violently disgusted; she insists upon leaving him; but as soon as
she sets foot in Bristol, "I took the diversion of going to Bath,
for as I was still far from being old so my humour, which was
always gay; continued so to an extreme". Heartless she is not, nor
can any one charge her with levity; but life delights her, and a
heroine who lives has us all in tow. Moreover, her ambition has
that slight strain of imagination in it which puts it in the
category of the noble passions. Shrewd and practical of necessity,
she is yet haunted by a desire for romance and for the quality
which to her perception makes a man a gentleman. "It was really a
true gallant spirit he was of, and it was the more grievous to me.
'Tis something of relief even to be undone by a man of honour
rather than by a scoundrel", she writes when she had misled a
highwayman as to the extent of her fortune. It is in keeping with
this temper that she should be proud of her final partner because
he refuses to work when they reach the plantations but prefers
hunting, and that she should take pleasure in buying him wigs and
silver-hilted swords "to make him appear, as he really was, a very
fine gentleman". Her very love of hot weather is in keeping, and
the passion with which she kissed the ground that her son had trod
on, and her noble tolerance of every kind of fault so long as it is
not "complete baseness of spirit, imperious, cruel, and relentless
when uppermost, abject and low-spirited when down". For the rest of
the world she has nothing but good-will.</p>

<p>Since the list of the qualities and graces of this seasoned old
sinner is by no means exhausted we can well understand how it was
that Borrow's apple-woman on London Bridge called her "blessed
Mary" and valued her book above all the apples on her stall; and
that Borrow, taking the book deep into the booth, read till his
eyes ached. But we dwell upon such signs of character only by way
of proof that the creator of Moll Flanders was not, as he has been
accused of being, a mere journalist and literal recorder of facts
with no conception of the nature of psychology. It is true that his
characters take shape and substance of their own accord, as if in
despite of the author and not altogether to his liking. He never
lingers or stresses any point of subtlety or pathos, but presses on
imperturbably as if they came there without his knowledge. A touch
of imagination, such as that when the Prince sits by his son's
cradle and Roxana observes how "he loved to look at it when it was
asleep", seems to mean much more to us than to him. After the
curiously modern dissertation upon the need of communicating
matters of importance to a second person lest, like the thief in
Newgate, we should talk of it in our sleep, he apologises for his
digression. He seems to have taken his characters so deeply into
his mind that he lived them without exactly knowing how; and, like
all unconscious artists, he leaves more gold in his work than his
own generation was able to bring to the surface.</p>

<p>The interpretation that we put on his characters might therefore
well have puzzled him. We find for ourselves meanings which he was
careful to disguise even from his own eye. Thus it comes about that
we admire Moll Flanders far more than we blame her. Nor can we
believe that Defoe had made up his mind as to the precise degree of
her guilt, or was unaware that in considering the lives of the
abandoned he raised many deep questions and hinted, if he did not
state, answers quite at variance with his professions of belief.
From the evidence supplied by his essay upon the "Education of
Women" we know that he had thought deeply and much in advance, of
his age upon the capacities of women, which he rated very high, and
the injustice done to them, which he rated very harsh.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have often thought of it as one of the most barbarous customs
in the world, considering us as a civilised and a Christian
country, that we deny the advantages of learning to women. We
reproach the sex every day with folly and impertinence; which I am
confident, had they the advantages of education equal to us, they
would be guilty of less than ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The advocates of women's rights would hardly care, perhaps, to
claim Moll Flanders and Roxana among their patron saints; and yet
it is clear that Defoe not only intended them to speak some very
modern doctrines upon the subject, but placed them in circumstances
where their peculiar hardships are displayed in such a way as to
elicit our sympathy. Courage, said Moll Flanders, was what women
needed, and the power to "stand their ground"; and at once gave
practical demonstration of the benefits that would result. Roxana,
a lady of the same profession, argues more subtly against the
slavery of marriage. She "had started a new thing in the world" the
merchant told her; "it was a way of arguing contrary to the general
practise". But Defoe is the last writer to be guilty of bald
preaching. Roxana keeps our attention because she is blessedly
unconscious that she is in any good sense an example to her sex and
is thus at liberty to own that part of her argument is "of an
elevated strain which was really not in my thoughts at first, at
all". The knowledge of her own frailties and the honest questioning
of her own motives, which that knowledge begets, have the happy
result of keeping her fresh and human when the martyrs and pioneers
of so many problem novels have shrunken and shrivelled to the pegs
and props of their respective creeds.</p>

<p>But the claim of Defoe upon our admiration does not rest upon
the fact that he can be shown to have anticipated some of the views
of Meredith, or to have written scenes which (the odd suggestion
occurs) might have been turned into plays by Ibsen. Whatever his
ideas upon the position of women, they are an incidental result of
his chief virtue, which is that he deals with the important and
lasting side of things and not with the passing and trivial. He is
often dull. He can imitate the matter-of-fact precision of a
scientific traveller until we wonder that his pen could trace or
his brain conceive what has not even the excuse of truth to soften
its dryness. He leaves out the whole of vegetable nature, and a
large part of human nature. All this we may admit, though we have
to admit defects as grave in many writers whom we call great. But
that does not impair the peculiar merit of what remains. Having at
the outset limited his scope and confined his ambitions he achieves
a truth of insight which is far rarer and more enduring than the
truth of fact which he professed to make his aim. Moll Flanders and
her friends recommended themselves to him not because they were, as
we should say, "picturesque"; nor, as he affirmed, because they
were examples of evil living by which the public might profit. It
was their natural veracity, bred in them by a life of hardship,
that excited his interest. For them there were no excuses; no
kindly shelter obscured their motives. Poverty was their
taskmaster. Defoe did not pronounce more than a judgement of the
lips upon their failings. But their courage and resource and
tenacity delighted him. He found their society full of good talk,
and pleasant stories, and faith in each other, and morality of a
home-made kind. Their fortunes had that infinite variety which he
praised and relished and beheld with wonder in his own life. These
men and women, above all, were free to talk openly of the passions
and desires which have moved men and women since the beginning of
time, and thus even now they keep their vitality undiminished.
There is a dignity in everything that is looked at openly. Even the
sordid subject of money, which plays so large a part in their
histories, becomes not sordid but tragic when it stands not for
ease and consequence but for honour, honesty, and life itself. You
may object that Defoe is humdrum, but never that he is engrossed
with petty things.</p>

<p>He belongs, indeed, to the school of the great plain writers,
whose work is founded upon a knowledge of what is most persistent,
though not most seductive, in human nature. The view of London from
Hungerford Bridge, grey, serious, massive, and full of the subdued
stir of traffic and business, prosaic if it were not for the masts
of the ships and the towers and domes of the city, brings him to
mind. The tattered girls with violets in their hands at the street
corners, and the old weather-beaten women patiently displaying
their matches and bootlaces beneath the shelter of arches, seem
like characters from his books. He is of the school of Crabbe and
of Gissing, and not merely a fellow-pupil in the same stern place
of learning, but its founder and master.</p>

<h1><a name="C09" id="C09">ADDISON</a><sup>1</sup>
</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In July, 1843, Lord Macaulay pronounced the opinion that Joseph
Addison had enriched our literature with compositions "that will
live as long as the English language". But when Lord Macaulay
pronounced an opinion it was not merely an opinion. Even now, at a
distance of seventy-six years, the words seem to issue from the
mouth of the chosen representative of the people. There is an
authority about them, a sonority, a sense of responsibility, which
put us in mind of a Prime Minister making a proclamation on behalf
of a great empire rather than of a journalist writing about a
deceased man of letters for a magazine. The article upon Addison
is, indeed, one of the most vigorous of the famous essays. Florid,
and at the same time extremely solid, the phrases seem to build up
a monument, at once square and lavishly festooned with ornament,
which should serve Addison for shelter so long as one stone of
Westminster Abbey stands upon another. Yet, though we may have read
and admired this particular essay times out of number (as we say
when we have read anything three times over), it has never occurred
to us, strangely enough, to believe that it is true. That is apt to
happen to the admiring reader of Macaulay's essays. While
delighting in their richness, force, and variety, and finding every
judgement, however emphatic, proper in its place, it seldom occurs
to us to connect these sweeping assertions and undeniable
convictions with anything so minute as a human being. So it is with
Addison. "If we wish", Macaulay writes, "to find anything more
vivid than Addison's best portraits, we must go either to
Shakespeare or to Cervantes". "We have not the least doubt that if
Addison had written a novel on an extensive plan it would have been
superior to any that we possess." His essays, again, "fully entitle
him to the rank of a great poet"; and, to complete the edifice, we
have Voltaire proclaimed "the prince of buffoons", and together
with Swift forced to stoop so low that Addison takes rank above
them both as a humorist.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Written in 1919.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Examined separately, such flourishes of ornament look grotesque
enough, but in their place&mdash;such is the persuasive power of
design&mdash;they are part of the decoration; they complete the
monument. Whether Addison or another is interred within, it is a
very fine tomb. But now that two centuries have passed since the
real body of Addison was laid by night under the Abbey floor, we
are, through no merit of our own, partially qualified to test the
first of the flourishes on that fictitious tombstone to which,
though it may be empty, we have done homage, in a formal kind of
way, these sixty-seven years. The compositions of Addison will live
as long as the English language. Since every moment brings proof
that our mother tongue is more lusty and lively than sorts with
complete sedateness or chastity, we need only concern ourselves
with the vitality of Addison. Neither lusty nor lively is the
adjective we should apply to the present condition of the
<i>Tatler</i> and the <i>Spectator.</i> To take a rough test, it is
possible to discover how many people in the course of a year borrow
Addison's works from the public library, and a particular instance
affords us the not very encouraging information that during nine
years two people yearly take out the first volume of the
<i>Spectator.</i> The second volume is less in request than the
first. The inquiry is not a cheerful one. From certain marginal
comments and pencil marks it seems that these rare devotees seek
out only the famous passages and, as their habit is, score what we
are bold enough to consider the least admirable phrases. No; if
Addison lives at all, it is not in the public libraries. It is in
libraries that are markedly private, secluded, shaded by lilac
trees and brown with folios, that he still draws his faint, regular
breath. If any man or woman is going to solace himself with a page
of Addison before the June sun is out of the sky to-day, it is in
some such pleasant retreat as this.</p>

<p>Yet all over England at intervals, perhaps wide ones, we may be
sure that there are people engaged in reading Addison, whatever the
year or season. For Addison is very well worth reading. The
temptation to read Pope on Addison, Macaulay on Addison, Thackeray
on Addison, Johnson on Addison rather than Addison himself is to be
resisted, for you will find, if you study the <i>Tatler</i> and the
<i>Spectator,</i> glance at <i>Cato,</i> and run through the
remainder of the six moderate-sized volumes, that Addison is
neither Pope's Addison nor anybody else's Addison, but a separate,
independent individual still capable of casting a clear-cut shape
of himself upon the consciousness, turbulent and distracted as it
is, of nineteen hundred and nineteen. It is true that the fate of
the lesser shades is always a little precarious. They are so easily
obscured or distorted. It seems so often scarcely worth while to go
through the cherishing and humanising process which is necessary to
get into touch with a writer of the second class who may, after
all, have little to give us. The earth is crusted over them; their
features are obliterated, and perhaps it is not a head of the best
period that we rub clean in the end, but only the chip of an old
pot. The chief difficulty with the lesser writers, however, is not
only the effort. It is that our standards have changed. The things
that they like are not the things that we like; and as the charm of
their writing depends much more upon taste than upon conviction, a
change of manners is often quite enough to put us out of touch
altogether. That is one of the most troublesome barriers between
ourselves and Addison. He attached great importance to certain
qualities. He had a very precise notion of what we are used to call
"niceness" in man or woman. He was extremely fond of saying that
men ought not to be atheists, and that women ought not to wear
large petticoats. This directly inspires in us not so much a sense
of distaste as a sense of difference. Dutifully, if at all, we
strain our imaginations to conceive the kind of audience to whom
these precepts were addressed. The <i>Tatler</i> was published in
1709; the <i>Spectator</i> a year or two later. What was the state
of England at that particular moment? Why was Addison so anxious to
insist upon the necessity of a decent and cheerful religious
belief? Why did he so constantly, and in the main kindly, lay
stress upon the foibles of women and their reform? Why was he so
deeply impressed with the evils of party government? Any historian
will explain; but it is always a misfortune to have to call in the
services of any historian. A writer should give us direct
certainty; explanations are so much water poured into the wine. As
it is, we can only feel that these counsels are addressed to ladies
in hoops and gentlemen in wigs&mdash;a vanished audience which has
learnt its lesson and gone its way and the preacher with it. We can
only smile and marvel and perhaps admire the clothes.</p>

<p>And that is not the way to read. To be thinking that dead people
deserved these censures and admired this morality, judged the
eloquence, which we find so frigid, sublime, the philosophy to us
so superficial, profound, to take a collector's joy in such signs
of antiquity, is to treat literature as if it were a broken jar of
undeniable age but doubtful beauty, to be stood in a cabinet behind
glass doors. The charm which still makes <i>Cato</i> very readable
is much of this nature. When Syphax exclaims,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, where our wide Numidian wastes extend,<br>
Sudden, th'impetuous hurricanes descend,<br>
Wheel through the air, in circling eddies play,<br>
Tear up the sands, and sweep whole plains away.<br>
The helpless traveller, with wild surprise,<br>
Sees the dry desert all around him rise,<br>
And smother'd in the dusty whirlwind dies,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>we cannot help imagining the thrill in the crowded theatre, the
feathers nodding emphatically on the ladies' heads, the gentlemen
leaning forward to tap their canes, and every one exclaiming to his
neighbour how vastly fine it is and crying "Bravo!" But how can
<i>we</i> be excited? And so with Bishop Hurd and his
notes&mdash;his "finely observed", his "wonderfully exact, both in
the sentiment and expression", his serene confidence that when "the
present humour of idolising Shakespeare is over", the time will
come when <i>Cato</i> is "supremely admired by all candid and
judicious critics". This is all very amusing and productive of
pleasant fancies, both as to the faded frippery of our ancestors'
minds and the bold opulence of our own. But it is not the
intercourse of equals, let alone that other kind of intercourse,
which as it makes us contemporary with the author, persuades us
that his object is our own. Occasionally in <i>Cato</i> one may
pick up a few lines that are not obsolete; but for the most part
the tragedy which Dr. Johnson thought "unquestionably the noblest
production of Addison's genius" has become collector's
literature.</p>

<p>Perhaps most readers approach the essays also with some
suspicion as to the need of condescension in their minds. The
question to be asked is whether Addison, attached as he was to
certain standards of gentility, morality, and taste, has not become
one of those people of exemplary character and charming urbanity
who must never be talked to about anything more exciting than the
weather. We have some slight suspicion that the <i>Spectator</i>
and the <i>Tatler</i> are nothing but talk, couched in perfect
English, about the number of fine days this year compared with the
number of wet the year before. The difficulty of getting on to
equal terms with him is shown by the little fable which he
introduces into one of the early numbers of the <i>Tatler,</i> of
"a young gentleman, of moderate understanding, but great vivacity,
who...had got a little smattering of knowledge, just enough to make
an atheist or a freethinker, but not a philosopher, or a man of
sense". This young gentleman visits his father in the country, and
proceeds "to enlarge the narrowness of the country notions; in
which he succeeded so well, that he had seduced the butler by his
table-talk, and staggered his eldest sister...'Till one day,
talking of his setting dog...said 'he did not question but Tray was
as immortal as any one of the family'; and in the heat of the
argument told his father, that for his own part, 'he expected to
die like a dog'. Upon which, the old man, starting up in a very
great passion, cried out, 'Then, sirrah, you shall live like one';
and taking his cane in his hand, cudgelled him out of his system.
This had so good an effect upon him, that he took up from that day,
fell to reading good books, and is now a bencher in the
Middle-Temple". There is a good deal of Addison in that story: his
dislike of "dark and uncomfortable prospects"; his respect for
"principles which are the support, happiness, and glory of all
public societies, as well as private persons"; his solicitude for
the butler; and his conviction that to read good books and become a
bencher in the Middle-Temple is the proper end for a very vivacious
young gentleman. This Mr. Addison married a countess, "gave his
little senate laws", and, sending for young Lord Warwick, made that
famous remark about seeing how a Christian can die which has fallen
upon such evil days that our sympathies are with the foolish, and
perhaps fuddled, young peer rather than with the frigid gentleman,
not too far gone for a last spasm of self-complacency, upon the
bed.</p>

<p>Let us rub off such incrustations, so far as they are due to the
corrosion of Pope's wit or the deposit of mid-Victorian
lachrymosity, and see what, for us in our time, remains. In the
first place, there remains the not despicable virtue, after two
centuries of existence, of being readable. Addison can fairly lay
claim to that; and then, slipped in on the tide of the smooth,
well-turned prose, are little eddies, diminutive waterfalls,
agreeably diversifying the polished surface. We begin to take note
of whims, fancies, peculiarities on the part of the essayist which
light up the prim, impeccable countenance of the moralist and
convince us that, however tightly he may have pursed his lips, his
eyes are very bright and not so shallow after all. He is alert to
his finger-tips. Little muffs, silver garters, fringed gloves draw
his attention; he observes with a keen, quick glance, not unkindly,
and full rather of amusement than of censure. To be sure, the age
was rich in follies. Here were coffee-houses packed with
politicians talking of Kings and Emperors and letting their own
small affairs go to ruin. Crowds applauded the Italian opera every
night without understanding a word of it. Critics discoursed of the
unities. Men gave a thousand pounds for a handful of tulip roots.
As for women&mdash;or "the fair sex", as Addison liked to call
them&mdash;their follies were past counting. He did his best to
count them, with a loving particularity which roused the ill-humour
of Swift. But he did it very charmingly, with a natural relish for
the task, as the following passage shows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I consider woman as a beautiful romantic animal, that may be
adorned with furs and feathers, pearls and diamonds, ores and
silks. The lynx shall cast its skin at her feet to make her a
tippet; the peacock, parrot, and swan, shall pay contributions to
her muff; the sea shall be searched for shells, and the rocks for
gems; and every part of nature furnish out its share towards the
embellishment of a creature that is the most consummate work of it.
All this I shall indulge them in; but as for the petticoat I have
been speaking of, I neither can nor will allow it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In all these matters Addison was on the side of sense and taste
and civilisation. Of that little fraternity, often so obscure and
yet so indispensable, who in every age keep themselves alive to the
importance of art and letters and music, watching, discriminating,
denouncing and delighting, Addison was one&mdash;distinguished and
strangely contemporary with ourselves. It would have been, so one
imagines, a great pleasure to take him a manuscript; a great
enlightenment, as well as a great honour, to have his opinion. In
spite of Pope, one fancies that his would have been criticism of
the best order, open-minded and generous to novelty, and yet, in
the final resort, unfaltering in its standards. The boldness which
is a proof of vigour is shown by his defence of "Chevy Chase". He
had so clear a notion of what he meant by the "very spirit and soul
of fine writing" as to track it down in an old barbarous ballad or
rediscover it in "that divine work" "Paradise Lost". Moreover, far
from being a connoisseur only of the still, settled beauties of the
dead, he was aware of the present; a severe critic of its "Gothic
taste", vigilant in protecting the rights and honours of the
language, and all in favour of simplicity and quiet. Here we have
the Addison of Will's and Button's, who, sitting late into the
night and drinking more than was good for him, gradually overcame
his taciturnity and began to talk. Then he "chained the attention
of every one to him". "Addison's conversation", said Pope, "had
something in it more charming than I have found in any other man."
One can well believe it, for his essays at their best preserve the
very cadence of easy yet exquisitely modulated
conversation&mdash;the smile checked before it has broadened into
laughter, the thought lightly turned from frivolity or abstraction,
the ideas springing, bright, new, various, with the utmost
spontaneity. He seems to speak what comes into his head, and is
never at the trouble of raising his voice. But he has described
himself in the character of the lute better than any one can do it
for him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lute is a character directly opposite to the drum, that
sounds very finely by itself, or in a very small concert. Its notes
are exquisitely sweet, and very low, easily drowned in a multitude
of instruments, and even lost among a few, unless you give a
particular attention to it. A lute is seldom heard in a company of
more than five, whereas a drum will show itself to advantage in an
assembly of 500. The lutanists, therefore, are men of a fine
genius, uncommon reflection, great affability, and esteemed chiefly
by persons of a good taste, who are the only proper judges of so
delightful and soft a melody.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Addison was a lutanist. No praise, indeed, could be less
appropriate than Lord Macaulay's. To call Addison on the strength
of his essays a great poet, or to prophesy that if he had written a
novel on an extensive plan it would have been "superior to any that
we possess", is to confuse him with the drums and trumpets; it is
not merely to overpraise his merits, but to overlook them. Dr.
Johnson superbly, and, as his manner is, once and for all has
summed up the quality of Addison's poetic genius:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His poetry is first to be considered; of which it must be
confessed that it has not often those felicities of diction which
give lustre to sentiments, or that vigour of sentiment that
animates diction; there is little of ardour, vehemence, or
transport; there is very rarely the awfulness of grandeur, and not
very often the splendour of elegance. He thinks justly; but he
thinks faintly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sir Roger de Coverley papers are those which have the most
resemblance, on the surface, to a novel. But their merit consists
in the fact that they do not adumbrate, or initiate, or anticipate
anything; they exist, perfect, complete, entire in themselves. To
read them as if they were a first hesitating experiment containing
the seed of greatness to come is to miss the peculiar point of
them. They are studies done from the outside by a quiet spectator.
When read together they compose a portrait of the Squire and his
circle all in characteristic positions&mdash;one with his rod,
another with his hounds&mdash;but each can be detached from the
rest without damage to the design or harm to himself. In a novel,
where each chapter gains from the one before it or adds to the one
that follows it, such separations would be intolerable. The speed,
the intricacy, the design, would be mutilated. These particular
qualities are perhaps lacking, but nevertheless Addison's method
has great advantages. Each of these essays is very highly finished.
The characters are defined by a succession of extremely neat, clean
strokes. Inevitably, where the sphere is so narrow&mdash;an essay
is only three or four pages in length&mdash;there is not room for
great depth or intricate subtlety. Here, from the <i>Spectator,</i>
is a good example of the witty and decisive manner in which Addison
strikes out a portrait to fill the little frame:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sombrius is one of these sons of sorrow. He thinks himself
obliged in duty to be sad and disconsolate. He looks on a sudden
fit of laughter as a breach of his baptismal vow. An innocent jest
startles him like blasphemy. Tell him of one who is advanced to a
title of honour, he lifts up his hands and eyes; describe a public
ceremony, he shakes his head; shew him a gay equipage, he blesses
himself. All the little ornaments of life are pomps and vanities.
Mirth is wanton, and wit profane. He is scandalized at youth for
being lively, and at childhood for being playful. He sits at a
christening, or at a marriage-feast, as at a funeral; sighs at the
conclusion of a merry story, and grows devout when the rest of the
company grow pleasant. After all Sombrius is a religious man, and
would have behaved himself very properly, had he lived when
Christianity was under a general persecution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The novel is not a development from that model, for the good
reason that no development along these lines is possible. Of its
kind such a portrait is perfect; and when we find, scattered up and
down the <i>Spectator</i> and the <i>Tatler,</i> numbers of such
little masterpieces with fancies and anecdotes in the same style,
some doubt as to the narrowness of such a sphere becomes
inevitable. The form of the essay admits of its own particular
perfection; and if anything is perfect the exact dimensions of its
perfection become immaterial. One can scarcely settle whether, on
the whole, one prefers a raindrop to the River Thames. When we have
said all that we can say against them&mdash;that many are dull,
others superficial, the allegories faded, the piety conventional,
the morality trite&mdash;there still remains the fact that the
essays of Addison are perfect essays. Always at the highest point
of any art there comes a moment when everything seems in a
conspiracy to help the artist, and his achievement becomes a
natural felicity on his part of which he seems, to a later age,
half-unconscious. So Addison, writing day after day, essay after
essay, knew instinctively and exactly how to do it. Whether it was
a high thing, or whether it was a low thing, whether an epic is
more profound or a lyric more passionate, undoubtedly it is due to
Addison that prose is now prosaic&mdash;the medium which makes it
possible for people of ordinary intelligence to communicate their
ideas to the world. Addison is the respectable ancestor of an
innumerable progeny. Pick up the first weekly journal and the
article upon the "Delights of Summer" or the "Approach of Age" will
show his influence. But it will also show, unless the name of Mr.
Max Beerbohm, our solitary essayist, is attached to it, that we
have lost the art of writing essays. What with our views and our
virtues, our passions and profundities, the shapely silver drop,
that held the sky in it and so many bright little visions of human
life, is now nothing but a hold-all knobbed with luggage packed in
a hurry. Even so, the essayist will make an effort, perhaps without
knowing it, to write like Addison.</p>

<p>In his temperate and reasonable way Addison more than once
amused himself with speculations as to the fate of his writings. He
had a just idea of their nature and value. "I have new-pointed all
the batteries of ridicule", he wrote. Yet, because so many of his
darts had been directed against ephemeral follies, "absurd
fashions, ridiculous customs, and affected forms of speech", the
time would come, in a hundred years, perhaps, when his essays, he
thought, would be "like so many pieces of old plate, where the
weight will be regarded, but the fashion lost". Two hundred years
have passed; the plate is worn smooth; the pattern almost rubbed
out; but the metal is pure silver.</p>

faded, out-of-date, obsolete library, which, with a little help
from the rates, is chiefly subsidised from the shelves of
clergymen's widows, and country gentlemen inheriting more books

with windows that look to the sea and let in the shouts of men

vases stands, in which specimens of the local flowers droop, each
with its name inscribed beneath. The elderly, the marooned, the

the <i>Wesleyan Chronicle.</i> No one has spoken aloud here since
the room was opened in 1854. The obscure sleep on the walls,
slouching against each other as if they were too drowsy to stand

Why disturb their sleep? Why reopen those peaceful graves, the

<h1>TAYLORS AND EDGEWORTHS</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For one likes romantically to feel oneself a deliverer advancing
with lights across the waste of years to the rescue of some
stranded ghost&mdash;a Mrs. Pilkington, a Rev. Henry Elman, a Mrs.
Ann Gilbert&mdash;waiting, appealing, forgotten, in the growing
gloom. Possibly they hear one coming. They shuffle, they preen,
they bridle. Old secrets well up to their lips. The divine relief
of communication will soon again be theirs. The dust shifts and
Mrs. Gilbert&mdash;but the contact with life is instantly salutary.
Whatever Mrs. Gilbert may be doing, she is not thinking about us.
Far from it. Colchester, about the year 1800, was for the young
Taylors, as Kensington had been for their mother, "a very Elysium".
There were the Strutts, the Hills, the Stapletons; there was
poetry, philosophy, engraving. For the young Taylors were brought
up to work hard, and if, after a long day's toil upon their
father's pictures, they slipped round to dine with the Strutts,
they had a right to their pleasure. Already they had won prizes in
Darton and Harvey's pocket-book. One of the Strutts knew James
Montgomery, and there was talk, at those gay parties, with the
Moorish decorations and all the cats&mdash;for old Ben Strutt was a
bit of a character: did not communicate; would not let his
daughters eat meat, so no wonder they died of
consumption&mdash;there was talk of printing a joint volume to be
called <i>The Associate Minstrels,</i> to which James, if not
Robert himself, might contribute. The Stapletons were poetical,
too. Moira and Bithia would wander over the old town wall at
Balkerne Hill reading poetry by moonlight. Perhaps there was a
little too much poetry in Colchester in 1800. Looking back in the
middle of a prosperous and vigorous life, Ann had to lament many
broken careers, much unfulfilled promise. The Stapletons died
young, perverted, miserable; Jacob, with his "dark, scorn-speaking
countenance", who had vowed that he would spend the night looking
for Ann's lost bracelet in the street, disappeared, "and I last
heard of him vegetating among the ruins of Rome&mdash;himself too
much a ruin"; as for the Hills, their fate was worst of all. To
submit to public baptism was flighty, but to marry Captain M.!
Anybody could have warned pretty Fanny Hill against Captain M. Yet
off she drove with him in his fine phaeton. For years nothing more
was heard of her. Then one night, when the Taylors had moved to
Ongar and old Mr. and Mrs. Taylor were sitting over the fire,
thinking how, as it was nine o'clock, and the moon was full, they
ought, according to their promise, to look at it and think of their
absent children, there came a knock at the door. Mrs. Taylor went
down to open it. But who was this sad, shabby-looking woman
outside? "Oh, don't you remember the Strutts and the Stapletons,
and how you warned me against Captain M.?" cried Fanny Hill, for it
was Fanny Hill&mdash;poor Fanny Hill, all worn and sunk; poor Fanny
Hill, that used to be so sprightly. She was living in a lone house
not far from the Taylors, forced to drudge for her husband's
mistress, for Captain M. had wasted all her fortune, ruined all her
life.</p>

<p>Ann married Mr. G., of course&mdash;of course. The words toll
persistently through these obscure volumes. For in the vast world
to which the memoir writers admit us there is a solemn sense of
something unescapable, of a wave gathering beneath the frail
flotilla and carrying it on. One thinks of Colchester in 1800.
Scribbling verses, reading Montgomery&mdash;so they begin; the
Hills, the Stapletons, the Strutts disperse and disappear as one
knew they would; but here, after long years, is Ann still
scribbling, and at last here is the poet Montgomery himself in her
very house, and she begging him to consecrate her child to poetry
by just holding him in his arms, and he refusing (for he is a
bachelor), but taking her for a walk, and they hear the thunder,
and she thinks it the artillery, and he says in a voice which she
will never, never forget: "Yes! The artillery of Heaven!" It is one
of the attractions of the unknown, their multitude, their vastness;
for, instead of keeping their identity separate, as remarkable
people do, they seem to merge into one another, their very boards
and title-pages and frontispieces dissolving, and their innumerable
pages melting into continuous years so that we can lie back and
look up into the fine mist-like substance of countless lives, and
pass unhindered from century to century, from life to life. Scenes
detach themselves. We watch groups. Here is young Mr. Elman talking
to Miss Biffen at Brighton. She has neither arms nor legs; a
footman carries her in and out. She teaches miniature painting to
his sister. Then he is in the stage coach on the road to Oxford
with Newman. Newman says nothing. Elman nevertheless reflects that
he has known all the great men of his time. And so back and so
forwards, he paces eternally the fields of Sussex until, grown to
an extreme old age, there he sits in his Rectory thinking of
Newman, thinking of Miss Biffen, and making&mdash;it is his great
consolation&mdash;string bags for missionaries. And then? Go on
looking. Nothing much happens. But the dim light is exquisitely
refreshing to the eyes. Let us watch little Miss Frend trotting
along the Strand with her father. They meet a man with very bright
eyes. "Mr. Blake", says Mr. Frend. It is Mrs. Dyer who pours out
tea for them in Clifford's Inn. Mr. Charles Lamb has just left the
room. Mrs. Dyer says she married George because his washerwoman
cheated him so. What do you think George paid for his shirts, she
asks? Gently, beautifully, like the clouds of a balmy evening,
obscurity once more traverses the sky, an obscurity which is not
empty but thick with the star dust of innumerable lives. And
suddenly there is a rift in it, and we see a wretched little
packet-boat pitching off the Irish coast in the middle of the
nineteenth century. There is an unmistakable air of 1840 about the
tarpaulins and the hairy monsters in sou'westers lurching and
spitting over the sloping decks, yet treating the solitary young
woman who stands in shawl and poke bonnet gazing, gazing, not
without kindness. No, no, no! She will not leave the deck. She will
stand there till it is quite dark, thank you! "Her great love of
the sea...drew this exemplary wife and mother every now and then
irresistibly away from home. No one but her husband knew where she
had gone, and her children learnt only later in life that on these
occasions, when suddenly she disappeared for a few days, she was
taking short sea voyages ..." a crime which she expiated by months
of work among the Midland poor. Then the craving would come upon
her, would be confessed in private to her husband, and off she
stole again&mdash;the mother of Sir George Newnes.</p>

<p>One would conclude that human beings were happy, endowed with
such blindness to fate, so indefatigable an interest in their own
activities, were it not for those sudden and astonishing
apparitions staring in at us, all taut and pale in their
determination never to be forgotten, men who have just missed fame,
men who have passionately desired redress&mdash;men like Haydon,
and Mark Pattison, and the Rev. Blanco White. And in the whole
world there is probably but one person who looks up for a moment
and tries to interpret the menacing face, the furious beckoning
fist, before, in the multitude of human affairs, fragments of
faces, echoes of voices, flying coat-tails, and bonnet strings
disappearing down the shrubbery walks, one's attention is
distracted for ever. What is that enormous wheel, for example,
careering downhill in Berkshire in the eighteenth century? It runs
faster and faster; suddenly a youth jumps out from within; next
moment it leaps over the edge of a chalk pit and is dashed to
smithereens. This is Edgeworth's doing&mdash;Richard Lovell
Edgeworth, we mean, the portentous bore.</p>

<p>For that is the way he has come down to us in his two volumes of
memoirs&mdash;Byron's bore, Day's friend, Maria's father, the man
who almost invented the telegraph, and did, in fact, invent
machines for cutting turnips, climbing walls, contracting on narrow
bridges and lifting their wheels over obstacles&mdash;a man
meritorious, industrious, advanced, but still, as we investigate
his memoirs, mainly a bore. Nature endowed him with irrepressible
energy. The blood coursed through his veins at least twenty times
faster than the normal rate. His face was red, round, vivacious.
His brain raced. His tongue never stopped talking. He had married
four wives and had nineteen children, including the novelist Maria.
Moreover, he had known every one and done everything. His energy
burst open the most secret doors and penetrated to the most private
apartments. His wife's grandmother, for instance, disappeared
mysteriously every day. Edgeworth blundered in upon her and found
her, with her white locks flowing and her eyes streaming, in prayer
before a crucifix. She was a Roman Catholic then, but why a
penitent? He found out somehow that her husband had been killed in
a duel, and she had married the man who killed him. "The
consolations of religion are fully equal to its terrors", Dick
Edgeworth reflected as he stumbled out again. Then there was the
beautiful young woman in the castle among the forests of Dauphiny.
Half paralysed, unable to speak above a whisper, there she lay when
Edgeworth broke in and found her reading. Tapestries flapped on the
castle walls; fifty thousand bats&mdash;"odious animals whose
stench is uncommonly noisome"&mdash;hung in clusters in the caves
beneath. None of the inhabitants understood a word she said. But to
the Englishman she talked for hour after hour about books and
politics and religion. He listened; no doubt he talked. He sat
dumbfounded. But what could one do for her? Alas, one must leave
her lying among the tusks, and the old men, and the cross-bows,
reading, reading, reading. For Edgeworth was employed in turning
the Rhone from its course. He must get back to his job. One
reflection he would make. "I determined on steadily persevering in
the cultivation of my understanding."</p>

<p>He was impervious to the romance of the situations in which he
found himself. Every experience served only to fortify his
character. He reflected, he observed, he improved himself daily.
You can improve, Mr. Edgeworth used to tell his children, every day
of your life. "He used to say that with this power of improving
they might in time be anything, and without it in time they would
be nothing." Imperturbable, indefatigable, daily increasing in
sturdy self-assurance, he has the gift of the egoist. He brings
out, as he bustles and bangs on his way, the diffident, shrinking
figures who would otherwise be drowned in darkness. The aged lady,
whose private penance he disturbed, is only one of a series of
figures who start up on either side of his progress, mute,
astonished, showing us in a way that is even now unmistakable,
their amazement at this well-meaning man who bursts in upon them at
their studies and interrupts their prayers. We see him through
their eyes; we see him as he does not dream of being seen. What a
tyrant he was to his first wife! How intolerably she suffered! But
she never utters a word. It is Dick Edgeworth who tells her story
in complete ignorance that he is doing anything of the kind. "It
was a singular trait of character in my wife," he observes, "who
had never shown any uneasiness at my intimacy with Sir Francis
Delaval, that she should take a strong dislike to Mr. Day. A more
dangerous and seductive companion than the one, or a more moral and
improving companion than the other, could not be found in England."
It was, indeed, very singular.</p>

<p>For the first Mrs. Edgeworth was a penniless girl, the daughter
of a ruined country gentleman, who sat over his fire picking
cinders from the hearth and throwing them into the grate, while
from time to time he ejaculated "Hein! Heing!" as yet another
scheme for making his fortune came into his head. She had had no
education. An itinerant writing-master had taught her to form a few
words. When Dick Edgeworth was an undergraduate and rode over from
Oxford she fell in love with him and married him in order to escape
the poverty and the mystery and the dirt, and to have a husband and
children like other women. But with what result? Gigantic wheels
ran downhill with the bricklayer's son inside them. Sailing
carriages took flight and almost wrecked four stage coaches.
Machines did cut turnips, but not very efficiently. Her little boy
was allowed to roam the country like a poor man's son, bare-legged,
untaught. And Mr. Day, coming to breakfast and staying to dinner,
argued incessantly about scientific principles and the laws of
nature.</p>

<p>But here we encounter one of the pitfalls of this nocturnal
rambling among forgotten worthies. It is so difficult to keep, as
we must with highly authenticated people, strictly to the facts. It
is so difficult to refrain from making scenes which, if the past
could be recalled, might perhaps be found lacking in accuracy. With
a character like Thomas Day, in particular, whose history surpasses
the bounds of the credible, we find ourselves oozing amazement,
like a sponge which has absorbed so much that it can retain no more
but fairly drips. Certain scenes have the fascination which belongs
rather to the abundance of fiction than to the sobriety of fact.
For instance, we conjure up all the drama of poor Mrs. Edgeworth's
daily life; her bewilderment, her loneliness, her despair, how she
must have wondered whether any one really wanted machines to climb
walls, and assured the gentlemen that turnips were better cut
simply with a knife, and so blundered and floundered and been
snubbed that she dreaded the almost daily arrival of the tall young
man with his pompous, melancholy face, marked by the smallpox, his
profusion of uncombed black hair, and his finical cleanliness of
hands and person. He talked fast, fluently, incessantly, for hours
at a time about philosophy and nature, and M. Rousseau. Yet it was
her house; she had to see to his meals, and, though he ate as
though he were half asleep, his appetite was enormous. But it was
no use complaining to her husband. Edgeworth said, "She lamented
about trifles". He went on to say: "The lamenting of a female with
whom we live does not render home delightful". And then, with his
obtuse open-mindedness, he asked her what she had to complain of.
Did he ever leave her alone? In the five or six years of their
married life he had slept from home not more than five or six
times. Mr. Day could corroborate that. Mr. Day corroborated
everything that Mr. Edgeworth said. He egged him on with his
experiments. He told him to leave his son without education. He did
not care a rap what the people of Henley said. In short, he was at
the bottom of all the absurdities and extravagances which made Mrs.
Edgeworth's life a burden to her.</p>

<p>Yet let us choose another scene&mdash;one of the last that poor
Mrs. Edgeworth was to behold. She was returning from Lyons, and Mr.
Day was her escort. A more singular figure, as he stood on the deck
of the packet which took them to Dover, very tall, very upright,
one finger in the breast of his coat, letting the wind blow his
hair out, dressed absurdly, though in the height of fashion, wild,
romantic, yet at the same time authoritative and pompous, could
scarcely be imagined; and this strange creature, who loathed women,
was in charge of a lady who was about to become a mother, had
adopted two orphan girls, and had set himself to win the hand of
Miss Elizabeth Sneyd by standing between boards for six hours daily
in order to learn to dance. Now and again he pointed his toe with
rigid precision; then, waking from the congenial dream into which
the dark clouds, the flying waters, and the shadow of England upon
the horizon had thrown him, he rapped out an order in the smart,
affected tones of a man of the world. The sailors stared, but they
obeyed. There was something sincere about him, something proudly
indifferent to what you thought; yes, something comforting and
humane, too, so that Mrs. Edgeworth for her part was determined
never to laugh at him again. But men were strange; life was
difficult, and with a sigh of bewilderment, perhaps of relief, poor
Mrs. Edgeworth landed at Dover, was brought to bed of a daughter,
and died.</p>

<p>Day meanwhile proceeded to Lichfield. Elizabeth Sneyd, of
course, refused him&mdash;gave a great cry, people said; exclaimed
that she had loved Day the blackguard, but hated Day the gentleman,
and rushed from the room. And then, they said, a terrible thing
happened. Mr. Day, in his rage, bethought him of the orphan,
Sabrina Sydney, whom he had bred to be his wife; visited her at
Sutton Coldfield; flew into a passion at the sight of her; fired a
pistol at her skirts, poured melted sealing-wax over her arms, and
boxed her ears. "No; I could never have done that", Mr. Edgeworth
used to say, when people described the scene. And whenever, to the
end of his life, he thought of Thomas Day, he fell silent. So
great, so passionate, so inconsistent&mdash;his life had been a
tragedy, and in thinking of his friend, the best friend he had ever
had, Richard Edgeworth fell silent.</p>

<p>It is almost the only occasion upon which silence is recorded of
him. To muse, to repent, to contemplate were foreign to his nature.
His wife and friends and children are silhouetted with extreme
vividness upon a broad disc of interminable chatter. Upon no other
background could we realise so clearly the sharp fragment of his
first wife, or the shades and depths which make up the character,
at once humane and brutal, advanced and hidebound, of the
inconsistent philosopher, Thomas Day. But his power is not limited
to people; landscapes, groups, societies seem, even as he describes
them, to split off from him, to be projected away, so that we are
able to run just ahead of him and anticipate his coming. They are
brought out all the more vividly by the extreme incongruity which
so often marks his comment and stamps his presence; they live with
a peculiar beauty, fantastic, solemn, mysterious, in contrast with
Edgeworth, who is none of these things. In particular, he brings
before us a garden in Cheshire, the garden of a parsonage, an
ancient but commodious parsonage.</p>

<p>One pushed through a white gate and found oneself in a grass
court, small but well kept, with roses growing in the hedges and
grapes hanging from the walls. But what, in the name of wonder,
were those objects in the middle of the grass plot? Through the
dusk of an autumn evening there shone out an enormous white globe.
Round it at various distances were others of different
sizes&mdash;the planets and their satellites, it seemed. But who
could have placed them there, and why? The house was silent; the
windows shut; nobody was stirring. Then, furtively peeping from
behind a curtain, appeared for a second the face of an elderly man,
handsome, dishevelled, distraught. It vanished.</p>

<p>In some mysterious way, human beings inflict their own vagaries
upon nature. Moths and birds must have flitted more silently
through the little garden; over everything must have brooded the
same fantastic peace. Then, red-faced, garrulous, inquisitive, in
burst Richard Lovell Edgeworth. He looked at the globes; he
satisfied himself that they were of "accurate design and
workmanlike construction". He knocked at the door. He knocked and
knocked. No one came. At length, as his impatience was overcoming
him, slowly the latch was undone, gradually the door was opened; a
clergyman, neglected, unkempt, but still a gentleman, stood before
him. Edgeworth named himself, and they retired to a parlour
littered with books and papers and valuable furniture now fallen to
decay. At last, unable to control his curiosity any longer,
Edgeworth asked what were the globes in the garden? Instantly the
clergyman displayed extreme agitation. It was his son who had made
them, he exclaimed; a boy of genius, a boy of the greatest
industry, and of virtue and acquirements far beyond his age. But he
had died. His wife had died. Edgeworth tried to turn the
conversation, but in vain. The poor man rushed on passionately,
incoherently about his son, his genius, his death. "It struck me
that his grief had injured his understanding", said Edgeworth, and
he was becoming more and more uncomfortable, when the door opened
and a girl of fourteen or fifteen entering with a tea-tray in her
hand, suddenly changed the course of his host's conversation.
Indeed, she was beautiful; dressed in white; her nose a shade too
prominent, perhaps&mdash;but no, her proportions were exquisitely
right. "She is a scholar and an artist!" the clergyman exclaimed as
she left the room. But why did she leave the room? If she was his
daughter why did she not preside at the tea-table? Was she his
mistress? Who was she? And why was the house in this state of
litter and decay? Why was the front door locked? Why was the
clergyman apparently a prisoner, and what was his secret story?
Questions began to crowd into Edgeworth's head as he sat drinking
his tea; but he could only shake his head and make one last
reflection, "I feared that something was not right", as he shut the
white wicket gate behind him, and left alone for ever in the untidy
house among the planets and their satellites, the mad clergyman and
the lovely girl.</p>

<h1>LAETITIA PILKINGTON</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let us bother the librarian once again. Let us ask him to reach
down, dust, and hand over to us that little brown book over there,
the Memoirs of Mrs. Pilkington, three volumes bound in one, printed
by Peter Hoey in Dublin, MDCCLXXVI. The deepest obscurity shades
her retreat; the dust lies heavy on her tomb&mdash;one board is
loose, that is to say, and nobody has read her since early in the
last century when a reader, presumably a lady, whether disgusted by
her obscenity or stricken by the hand of death, left off in the
middle and marked her place with a faded list of goods and
groceries. If ever a woman wanted a champion, it is obviously
Laetitia Pilkington. Who then was she?</p>

<p>Can you imagine a very extraordinary cross between Moll Flanders
and Lady Ritchie, between a rolling and rollicking woman of the
town and a lady of breeding and refinement? Laetitia Pilkington
(1712-1759) was something of the sort&mdash;shady, shifty,
adventurous, and yet, like Thackeray's daughter, like Miss Mitford,
like Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute; and Jane Austen and Maria
Edgeworth, so imbued with the old traditions of her sex that she
wrote, as ladies talk, to give pleasure. Throughout her
<i>Memoirs,</i> we can never forget that it is her wish to
entertain, her unhappy fate to sob. Dabbing her eyes and
controlling her anguish, she begs us to forgive an odious breach of
manners which only the suffering of a lifetime, the intolerable
persecutions of Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;n, the malignant, she must say
the h&mdash;&mdash;h, spite of Lady C&mdash;&mdash;t can excuse.
For who should know better than the Earl of Killmallock's
great-granddaughter that it is the part of a lady to hide her
sufferings? Thus Laetitia is in the great tradition of English
women of letters. It is her duty to entertain; it is her instinct
to conceal. Still, though her room near the Royal Exchange is
threadbare, and the table is spread with old play-bills instead of
a cloth, and the butter is served in a shoe, and Mr. Worsdale has
used the teapot to fetch small beer that very morning, still she
presides, still she entertains. Her language is a trifle coarse,
perhaps. But who taught her English? The great Doctor Swift.</p>

<p>In all her wanderings, which were many, and in her failings,
which were great, she looked back to those early Irish days when
Swift had pinched her into propriety of speech. He had beaten her
for fumbling at a drawer: he had daubed her cheeks with burnt cork
to try her temper; he had bade her pull off her shoes and stockings
and stand against the wainscot and let him measure her. At first
she had refused; then she had yielded. "Why," said the Dean, "I
suspected you had either broken Stockings or foul toes, and in
either case should have delighted to expose you." Three feet two
inches was all she measured, he declared, though, as Laetitia
complained, the weight of Swift's hand on her head had made her
shrink to half her size. But she was foolish to complain. Probably
she owed her intimacy to that very fact&mdash;she was only three
feet two. Swift had lived a lifetime among the giants; now there
was a charm in dwarfs. He took the little creature into his
library. "'Well,' said he, 'I have brought you here to show you all
the Money I got when I was in the Ministry, but don't steal any of
it.' 'I won't, indeed, Sir,' said I; so he opened a Cabinet, and
showed me a whole parcel of empty drawers. 'Bless me,' says he,
'the Money is flown.'" There was a charm in her surprise; there was
a charm in her humility. He could beat her and bully her, make her
shout when he was deaf, force her husband to drink the lees of the
wine, pay their cab fares, stuff guineas into a piece of
gingerbread, and relent surprisingly, as if there were something
grimly pleasing to him in the thought of so foolish a midget
setting up to have a life and a mind of her own. For with Swift she
was herself; it was the effect of his genius. She had to pull off
her stockings if he told her to. So, though his satire terrified
her, and she found it highly unpleasant to dine at the Deanery and
see him watching, in the great glass which hung before him for that
purpose, the butler stealing beer at the sideboard, she knew that
it was a privilege to walk with him in his garden; to hear him talk
of Mr. Pope and quote Hudibras; and then be hustled back in the
rain to save coach hire, and then to sit chatting in the parlour
with Mrs. Brent, the housekeeper, about the Dean's oddity and
charity, and how the sixpence he saved on the coach he gave to the
lame old man who sold gingerbread at the corner, while the Dean
dashed up the front stairs and down the back so violently that she
was afraid he would fall and hurt himself.</p>

<p>But memories of great men are no infallible specific. They fall
upon the race of life like beams from a lighthouse. They flash,
they shock, they reveal, they vanish. To remember Swift was of
little avail to Laetitia when the troubles of life came thick about
her. Mr. Pilkington left her for Widow W&mdash;rr&mdash;n. Her
father&mdash;her dear father&mdash;died. The sheriff's officers
insulted her. She was deserted in an empty house with two children
to provide for. The tea chest was secured, the garden gate locked,
and the bills left unpaid. And still she was young and attractive
and gay, with an inordinate passion for scribbling verses and an
incredible hunger for reading books. It was this that was her
undoing. The book was fascinating and the hour late. The gentleman
would not lend it, but would stay till she had finished. They sat
in her bedroom. It was highly indiscreet, she owned. Suddenly
twelve watchmen broke through the kitchen window, and Mr.
Pilkington appeared with a cambric handkerchief tied about his
neck. Swords were drawn and heads broken. As for her excuse, how
could one expect Mr. Pilkington and the twelve watchmen to believe
that? Only reading! Only sitting up late to finish a new book! Mr.
Pilkington and the watchmen interpreted the situation as such men
would. But lovers of learning, she is persuaded, will understand
her passion and deplore its consequences.</p>

<p>And now what was she to do? Reading had played her false, but
still she could write. Ever since she could form her letters,
indeed, she had written, with incredible speed and considerable
grace, odes, addresses, apostrophes to Miss Hoadley, to the
Recorder of Dublin, to Dr. Delville's place in the country. "Hail,
happy Delville, blissful seat!" "Is there a man whose fixed and
steady gaze&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;the verses flowed without the
slightest difficulty on the slightest occasion. Now, therefore,
crossing to England, she set up, as her advertisement had it, to
write letters upon any subject, except the law, for twelve pence
ready money, and no trust given. She lodged opposite White's
Chocolate House, and there, in the evening, as she watered her
flowers on the leads, the noble gentlemen in the window across the
road drank her health, sent her over a bottle of burgundy; and
later she heard old Colonel &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; crying, "Poke
after me, my lord, poke after me," as he shepherded the
D&mdash;&mdash; of M&mdash;lb&mdash;gh up her dark stairs. That
lovely gentleman, who honoured his title by wearing it, kissed her,
complimented her, opened his pocket-book, and left her with a
bank-note for fifty pounds upon Sir Francis Child. Such tributes
stimulated her pen to astonishing outbursts of impromptu gratitude.
If, on the other hand, a gentleman refused to buy or a lady hinted
impropriety, this same flowery pen writhed and twisted in agonies
of hate and vituperation. "Had I said that your F&mdash;&mdash;r
died Blaspheming the Almighty", one of her accusations begins, but
the end is unprintable. Great ladies were accused of every
depravity, and the clergy, unless their taste in poetry was above
reproach, suffered an incessant castigation. Mr. Pilkington, she
never forgot, was a clergyman.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely the Earl of Killmallock's great-granddaughter
descended in the social scale. From St. James's Street and its
noble benefactors she migrated to Green Street to lodge with Lord
Stair's <i>valet de chambre</i> and his wife, who washed for
persons of distinction. She, who had dallied with dukes, was glad
for company's sake to take a hand at quadrille with footmen and
laundresses and Grub Street writers, who, as they drank porter,
sipped green tea, and smoked tobacco, told stories of the utmost
scurrility about their masters and mistresses. The spiciness of
their conversation made amends for the vulgarity of their manners.
From them Laetitia picked up those anecdotes of the great which
sprinkled her pages with dashes and served her purpose when
subscribers failed and landladies grew insolent. Indeed, it was a
hard life&mdash;to trudge to Chelsea in the snow wearing nothing
but a chintz gown and be put off with a beggarly half-crown by Sir
Hans Sloane; next to tramp to Ormond Street and extract two guineas
from the odious Dr. Meade, which, in her glee, she tossed in the
air and lost in a crack of the floor; to be insulted by footmen; to
sit down to a dish of boiling water because her landlady must not
guess that a pinch of tea was beyond her means. Twice on moonlight
nights, with the lime trees in flower, she wandered in St. James's
Park and contemplated suicide in Rosamond's Pond. Once, musing
among the tombs in Westminster Abbey, the door was locked on her,
and she had to spend the night in the pulpit wrapped in a carpet
from the Communion Table to protect herself from the assaults of
rats. "I long to listen to the young-ey'd cherubims!" she
exclaimed. But a very different fate was in store for her. In spite
of Mr. Colley Cibber, and Mr. Richardson, who supplied her first
with gilt-edged notepaper and then with baby linen, those harpies,
her landladies, after drinking her ale, devouring her lobsters, and
failing often for years at a time to comb their hair, succeeded in
driving Swift's friend, and the Earl's great-granddaughter, to be
imprisoned with common debtors in the Marshalsea.</p>

<p>Bitterly she cursed her husband, who had made her a lady of
adventure instead of what nature intended, "a harmless household
dove". More and more wildly she ransacked her brains for anecdotes,
memories, scandals, views about the bottomless nature of the sea,
the inflammable character of the earth&mdash;anything that would
fill a page and earn her a guinea. She remembered that she had
eaten plovers' eggs with Swift. "Here, Hussey," said he, "is a
Plover's egg. King William used to give crowns apiece for them..."
Swift never laughed, she remembered. He used to suck in his cheeks
instead of laughing. And what else could she remember? A great many
gentlemen, a great many landladies; how the window was thrown up
when her father died, and her sister came downstairs, with the
sugar-basin, laughing. All had been bitterness and struggle, except
that she had loved Shakespeare, known Swift, and kept through all
the shifts and shades of an adventurous career a gay spirit,
something of a lady's breeding, and the gallantry which, at the end
of her short life, led her to crack her joke and enjoy her duck
with death at her heart and duns at her pillow.</p>

<h1><a name="C11" id="C11">JANE AUSTEN</a>
</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is probable that if Miss Cassandra Austen had had her way we
should have had nothing of Jane Austen's except her novels. To her
elder sister alone did she write freely; to her alone she confided
her hopes and, if rumour is true, the one great disappointment of
her life; but when Miss Cassandra Austen grew old, and the growth
of her sister's fame made her suspect that a time might come when
strangers would pry and scholars speculate, she burnt, at great
cost to herself, every letter that could gratify their curiosity,
and spared only what she judged too trivial to be of interest.</p>

<p>Hence our knowledge of Jane Austen is derived from a little
gossip, a few letters, and her books. As for the gossip, gossip
which has survived its day is never despicable; with a little
rearrangement it suits our purpose admirably. For example, Jane "is
not at all pretty and very prim, unlike a girl of twelve...Jane is
whimsical and affected," says little Philadelphia Austen of her
cousin. Then we have Mrs. Mitford, who knew the Austens as girls
and thought Jane "the prettiest, silliest, most affected
husband-hunting butterfly she ever remembers ". Next, there is Miss
Mitford's anonymous friend "who visits her now [and] says that she
has stiffened into the most perpendicular, precise, taciturn piece
of 'single blessedness' that ever existed, and that, until <i>Pride
and Prejudice</i> showed what a precious gem was hidden in that
unbending case, she was no more regarded in society than a poker or
firescreen....The case is very different now", the good lady goes
on; "she is still a poker&mdash;but a poker of whom everybody is
afraid....A wit, a delineator of character, who does not talk is
terrific indeed!" On the other side, of course, there are the
Austens, a race little given to panegyric of themselves, but
nevertheless, they say, her brothers "were very fond and very proud
of her. They were attached to her by her talents, her virtues, and
her engaging manners, and each loved afterwards to fancy a
resemblance in some niece or daughter of his own to the dear sister
Jane, whose perfect equal they yet never expected to see." Charming
but perpendicular, loved at home but feared by strangers, biting of
tongue but tender of heart&mdash;these contrasts are by no means
incompatible, and when we turn to the novels we shall find
ourselves stumbling there too over the same complexities in the
writer.</p>

<p>To begin with, that prim little girl whom Philadelphia found so
unlike a child of twelve, whimsical and affected, was soon to be
the authoress of an astonishing and unchildish story, <i>Love and
Freindship</i>,<sup>1</sup> which, incredible though it appears,
was written at the age of fifteen. It was written, apparently, to
amuse the schoolroom; one of the stories in the same book is
dedicated with mock solemnity to her brother; another is neatly
illustrated with water-colour heads by her sister. These are jokes
which, one feels, were family property; thrusts of satire, which
went home because all little Austens made mock in common of fine
ladies who "sighed and fainted on the sofa".</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <i>Love and Freindship,</i> Chatto and Windus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters must have laughed when Jane read out loud
her last hit at the vices which they all abhorred. "I die a martyr
to my grief for the loss of Augustus. One fatal swoon has cost me
my life. Beware of Swoons, Dear Laura....Run mad as often as you
chuse, but do not faint..." And on she rushed, as fast as she could
write and quicker than she could spell, to tell the incredible
adventures of Laura and Sophia, of Philander and Gustavus, of the
gentleman who drove a coach between Edinburgh and Stirling every
other day, of the theft of the fortune that was kept in the table
drawer, of the starving mothers and the sons who acted Macbeth.
Undoubtedly, the story must have roused the schoolroom to
uproarious laughter. And yet, nothing is more obvious than that
this girl of fifteen, sitting in her private corner of the common
parlour, was writing not to draw a laugh from brother and sisters,
and not for home consumption. She was writing for everybody, for
nobody, for our age, for her own; in other words, even at that
early age Jane Austen was writing. One hears it in the rhythm and
shapeliness and severity of the sentences. "She was nothing more
than a mere good-tempered, civil, and obliging young woman; as such
we could scarcely dislike her&mdash;she was only an object of
contempt." Such a sentence is meant to outlast the Christmas
holidays. Spirited, easy, full of fun, verging with freedom upon
sheer nonsense,&mdash;<i>Love and Freindship</i> is all that; but
what is this note which never merges in the rest, which sounds
distinctly and penetratingly all through the volume? It is the
sound of laughter. The girl of fifteen is laughing, in her corner,
at the world.</p>

<p>Girls of fifteen are always laughing. They laugh when Mr. Binney
helps himself to salt instead of sugar. They almost die of laughing
when old Mrs. Tomkins sits down upon the cat. But they are crying
the moment after. They have no fixed abode from which they see that
there is something eternally laughable in human nature, some
quality in men and women that for ever excites our satire. They do
not know that Lady Greville who snubs, and poor Maria who is
snubbed, are permanent features of every ballroom. But Jane Austen
knew it from her birth upwards. One of those fairies who perch upon
cradles must have taken her a flight through the world directly she
was born. When she was laid in the cradle again she knew not only
what the world looked like, but had already chosen her kingdom. She
had agreed that if she might rule over that territory, she would
covet no other. Thus at fifteen she had few illusions about other
people and none about herself. Whatever she writes is finished and
turned and set in its relation, not to the parsonage, but to the
universe. She is impersonal; she is inscrutable. When the writer,
Jane Austen, wrote down in the most remarkable sketch in the book a
little of Lady Greville's conversation, there is no trace of anger
at the snub which the clergyman's daughter, Jane Austen, once
received. Her gaze passes straight to the mark, and we know
precisely where, upon the map of human nature, that mark is. We
know because Jane Austen kept to her compact; she never trespassed
beyond her boundaries. Never, even at the emotional age of fifteen,
did she round upon herself in shame, obliterate a sarcasm in a
spasm of compassion, or blur an outline in a mist of rhapsody.
Spasms and rhapsodies, she seems to have said, pointing with her
stick, end <i>there</i>; and the boundary line is perfectly
distinct. But she does not deny that moons and mountains and
castles exist&mdash;on the other side. She has even one romance of
her own. It is for the Queen of Scots. She really admired her very
much. "One of the first characters in the world", she called her,
"a bewitching Princess whose only friend was then the Duke of
Norfolk, and whose only ones now Mr. Whitaker, Mrs. Lefroy, Mrs.
Knight and myself." With these words her passion is neatly
circumscribed, and rounded with a laugh. It is amusing to remember
in what terms the young Bront&euml;'s wrote, not very much later,
in their northern parsonage, about the Duke of Wellington.</p>

<p>The prim little girl grew up. She became "the prettiest,
silliest, most affected husband-hunting butterfly" Mrs. Mitford
ever remembered, and, incidentally, the authoress of a novel called
<i>Pride and Prejudice,</i> which, written stealthily under cover
of a creaking door, lay for many years unpublished. A little later,
it is thought, she began another story, <i>The Watsons,</i> and
being for some reason dissatisfied with it, left it unfinished. The
second-rate works of a great writer are worth reading because they
offer the best criticism of his masterpieces. Here her difficulties
are more apparent, and the method she took to overcome them less
artfully concealed. To begin with, the stiffness and the bareness
of the first chapters prove that she was one of those writers who
lay their facts out rather baldly in the first version and then go
back and back and back and cover them with flesh and atmosphere.
How it would have been done we cannot say&mdash;by what
suppressions and insertions and artful devices. But the miracle
would have been accomplished; the dull history of fourteen years of
family life would have been converted into another of those
exquisite and apparently effortless introductions; and we should
never have guessed what pages of preliminary drudgery Jane Austen
forced her pen to go through. Here we perceive that she was no
conjuror after all. Like other writers, she had to create the
atmosphere in which her own peculiar genius could bear fruit. Here
she fumbles; here she keeps us waiting. Suddenly she has done it;
now things can happen as she likes things to happen. The Edwardses
are going to the ball. The Tomlinsons' carriage is passing; she can
tell us that Charles is "being provided with his gloves and told to
keep them on"; Tom Musgrave retreats to a remote corner with a
barrel of oysters and is famously snug. Her genius is freed and
active. At once our senses quicken; we are possessed with the
peculiar intensity which she alone can impart. But of what is it
all composed? Of a ball in a country town; a few couples meeting
and taking hands in an assembly room; a little eating and drinking;
and for catastrophe, a boy being snubbed by one young lady and
kindly treated by another. There is no tragedy and no heroism. Yet
for some reason the little scene is moving out of all proportion to
its surface solemnity. We have been made to see that if Emma acted
so in the ball-room, how considerate, how tender, inspired by what
sincerity of feeling she would have shown herself in those graver
crises of life which, as we watch her, come inevitably before our
eyes. Jane Austen is thus a mistress of much deeper emotion than
appears upon the surface. She stimulates us to supply what is not
there. What she offers is, apparently, a trifle, yet is composed of
something that expands in the reader's mind and endows with the
most enduring form of life scenes which are outwardly trivial.
Always the stress is laid upon character. How, we are made to
wonder, will Emma behave when Lord Osborne and Tom Musgrave make
their call at five minutes before three, just as Mary is bringing
in the tray and the knife-case? It is an extremely awkward
situation. The young men are accustomed to much greater refinement.
Emma may prove herself ill-bred, vulgar, a nonentity. The turns and
twists of the dialogue keep us on the tenterhooks of suspense. Our
attention is half upon the present moment, half upon the future.
And when, in the end, Emma behaves in such a way as to vindicate
our highest hopes of her, we are moved as if we had been made
witnesses of a matter of the highest importance. Here, indeed, in
this unfinished and in the main inferior story, are all the
elements of Jane Austen's greatness. It has the permanent quality
of literature. Think away the surface animation, the likeness to
life, and there remains, to provide a deeper pleasure, an exquisite
discrimination of human values. Dismiss this too from the mind and
one can dwell with extreme satisfaction upon the more abstract art
which, in the ball-room scene, so varies the emotions and
proportions the parts that it is possible to enjoy it, as one
enjoys poetry, for itself, and not as a link which carries the
story this way and that.</p>

<p>But the gossip says of Jane Austen that she was perpendicular,
precise, and taciturn&mdash;"a poker of whom everybody is afraid".
Of this too there are traces; she could be merciless enough; she is
one of the most consistent satirists in the whole of literature.
Those first angular chapters of <i>The Watsons</i> prove that hers
was not a prolific genius; she had not, like Emily Bront&euml;,
merely to open the door to make herself felt. Humbly and gaily she
collected the twigs and straws out of which the nest was to be made
and placed them neatly together. The twigs and straws were a little
dry and a little dusty in themselves. There was the big house and
the little house; a tea party, a dinner party, and an occasional
picnic; life was hedged in by valuable connections and adequate
incomes; by muddy roads, wet feet, and a tendency on the part of
the ladies to get tired; a little principle supported it, a little
consequence, and the education commonly enjoyed by upper
middle-class families living in the country. Vice, adventure,
passion were left outside. But of all this prosiness, of all this
littleness, she evades nothing, and nothing is slurred over.
Patiently and precisely she tells us how they "made no stop
anywhere till they reached Newbury, where a comfortable meal,
uniting dinner and supper, wound up the enjoyments and fatigues of
the day". Nor does she pay to conventions merely the tribute of lip
homage; she believes in them besides accepting them. When she is
describing a clergyman, like Edmund Bertram, or a sailor, in
particular, she appears debarred by the sanctity of his office from
the free use of her chief tool, the comic genius, and is apt
therefore to lapse into decorous panegyric or matter-of-fact
description. But these are exceptions; for the most part her
attitude recalls the anonymous lady's ejaculation&mdash;"A wit, a
delineator of character, who does not talk is terrific indeed!" She
wishes neither to reform nor to annihilate; she is silent; and that
is terrific indeed. One after another she creates her fools, her
prigs, her worldlings, her Mr. Collinses, her Sir Walter Elliotts,
her Mrs. Bennets. She encircles them with the lash of a whip-like
phrase which, as it runs round them, cuts out their silhouettes for
ever. But there they remain; no excuse is found for them and no
mercy shown them. Nothing remains of Julia and Maria Bertram when
she has done with them; Lady Bertram is left "sitting and calling
to Pug and trying to keep him from the flower-beds" eternally. A
divine justice is meted out; Dr. Grant, who begins by liking his
goose tender, ends by bringing on "apoplexy and death, by three
great institutionary dinners in one week". Sometimes it seems as if
her creatures were born merely to give Jane Austen the supreme
delight of slicing their heads off. She is satisfied; she is
content; she would not alter a hair on anybody's head, or move one
brick or one blade of grass in a world which provides her with such
exquisite delight.</p>

<p>Nor, indeed, would we. For even if the pangs of outraged vanity,
or the heat of moral wrath, urged us to improve away a world so
full of spite, pettiness, and folly, the task is beyond our powers.
People are like that&mdash;the girl of fifteen knew it; the mature
woman proves it. At this very moment some Lady Bertram is trying to
keep Pug from the flower beds; she sends Chapman to help Miss Fanny
a little late. The discrimination is so perfect, the satire so
just, that, consistent though it is, it almost escapes our notice.
No touch of pettiness, no hint of spite, rouse us from our
contemplation. Delight strangely mingles with our amusement. Beauty
illumines these fools.</p>

<p>That elusive quality is, indeed, often made up of very different
parts, which it needs a peculiar genius to bring together. The wit
of Jane Austen has for partner the perfection of her taste. Her
fool is a fool, her snob is a snob, because he departs from the
model of sanity and sense which she has in mind, and conveys to us
unmistakably even while she makes us laugh. Never did any novelist
make more use of an impeccable sense of human values. It is against
the disc of an unerring heart, an unfailing good taste, an almost
stern morality, that she shows up those deviations from kindness,
truth, and sincerity which are among the most delightful things in
English literature. She depicts a Mary Crawford in her mixture of
good and bad entirely by this means. She lets her rattle on against
the clergy, or in favour of a baronetage and ten thousand a year,
with all the ease and spirit possible; but now and again she
strikes one note of her own, very quietly, but in perfect tune, and
at once all Mary Crawford's chatter, though it continues to amuse,
rings flat. Hence the depth, the beauty, the complexity of her
scenes. From such contrasts there comes a beauty, a solemnity even,
which are not only as remarkable as her wit, but an inseparable
part of it. In <i>The Watsons</i> she gives us a foretaste of this
power; she makes us wonder why an ordinary act of kindness, as she
describes it, becomes so full of meaning. In her masterpieces, the
same gift is brought to perfection. Here is nothing out of the way;
it is midday in Northamptonshire; a dull young man is talking to
rather a weakly young woman on the stairs as they go up to dress
for dinner, with housemaids passing. But, from triviality, from
commonplace, their words become suddenly full of meaning, and the
moment for both one of the most memorable in their lives. It fills
itself; it shines; it glows; it hangs before us, deep, trembling,
serene for a second; next, the housemaid passes, and this drop, in
which all the happiness of life has collected, gently subsides
again to become part of the ebb and flow of ordinary existence.</p>

<p>What more natural, then, with this insight into their
profundity, than that Jane Austen should have chosen to write of
the trivialities of day-to-day existence, of parties, picnics, and
country dances? No "suggestions to alter her style of writing" from
the Prince Regent or Mr. Clarke could tempt her; no romance, no
adventure, no politics or intrigue could hold a candle to life on a
country-house staircase as she saw it. Indeed, the Prince Regent
and his librarian had run their heads against a very formidable
obstacle; they were trying to tamper with an incorruptible
conscience, to disturb an infallible discretion. The child who
formed her sentences so finely when she was fifteen never ceased to
form them, and never wrote for the Prince Regent or his Librarian,
but for the world at large. She knew exactly what her powers were,
and what material they were fitted to deal with as material should
be dealt with by a writer whose standard of finality was high.
There were impressions that lay outside her province; emotions that
by no stretch or artifice could be properly coated and covered by
her own resources. For example, she could not make a girl talk
enthusiastically of banners and chapels. She could not throw
herself whole-heartedly into a romantic moment. She had all sorts
of devices for evading scenes of passion. Nature and its beauties
she approached in a sidelong way of her own. She describes a
beautiful night without once mentioning the moon. Nevertheless, as
we read the few formal phrases about "the brilliancy of an
unclouded night and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods",
the night is at once as "solemn, and soothing, and lovely" as she
tells us, quite simply, that it was.</p>

<p>The balance of her gifts was singularly perfect. Among her
finished novels there are no failures, and among her many chapters
few that sink markedly below the level of the others. But, after
all, she died at the age of forty-two. She died at the height of
her powers. She was still subject to those changes which often make
the final period of a writer's career the most interesting of all.
Vivacious, irrepressible, gifted with an invention of great
vitality, there can be no doubt that she would have written more,
had she lived, and it is tempting to consider whether she would not
have written differently. The boundaries were marked; moons,
mountains, and castles lay on the other side. But was she not
sometimes tempted to trespass for a minute? Was she not beginning,
in her own gay and brilliant manner, to contemplate a little voyage
of discovery?</p>

<p>Let us take <i>Persuasion,</i> the last completed novel, and
look by its light at the books she might have written had she
lived. There is a peculiar beauty and a peculiar dullness in
<i>Persuasion.</i> The dullness is that which so often marks the
transition stage between two different periods. The writer is a
little bored. She has grown too familiar with the ways of her
world; she no longer notes them freshly. There is an asperity in
her comedy which suggests that she has almost ceased to be amused
by the vanities of a Sir Walter or the snobbery of a Miss Elliott.
The satire is harsh, and the comedy crude. She is no longer so
freshly aware of the amusements of daily life. Her mind is not
altogether on her object. But, while we feel that Jane Austen has
done this before, and done it better, we also feel that she is
trying to do something which she has never yet attempted. There is
a new element in <i>Persuasion,</i> the quality, perhaps, that made
Dr. Whewell fire up and insist that it was "the most beautiful of
her works". She is beginning to discover that the world is larger,
more mysterious, and more romantic than she had supposed. We feel
it to be true of herself when she says of Anne: "She had been
forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew
older&mdash;the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning". She
dwells frequently upon the beauty and the melancholy of nature,
upon the autumn where she had been wont to dwell upon the spring.
She talks of the "influence so sweet and so sad of autumnal months
in the country". She marks "the tawny leaves and withered hedges".
"One does not love a place the less because one has suffered in
it", she observes. But it is not only in a new sensibility to
nature that we detect the change. Her attitude to life itself is
altered. She is seeing it, for the greater part of the book,
through the eyes of a woman who, unhappy herself, has a special
sympathy for the happiness and unhappiness of others, which, until
the very end, she is forced to comment upon in silence. Therefore
the observation is less of facts and more of feelings than is
usual. There is an expressed emotion in the scene at the concert
and in the famous talk about woman's constancy which proves not
merely the biographical fact that Jane Austen had loved, but the
aesthetic fact that she was no longer afraid to say so. Experience,
when it was of a serious kind, had to sink very deep, and to be
thoroughly disinfected by the passage of time, before she allowed
herself to deal with it in fiction. But now, in 1817, she was
ready. Outwardly, too, in her circumstances, a change was imminent.
Her fame had grown very slowly. "I doubt ", wrote Mr. Austen Leigh,
"whether it would be possible to mention any other author of note
whose personal obscurity was so complete." Had she lived a few more
years only, all that would have been altered. She would have stayed
in London, dined out, lunched out, met famous people, made new
friends, read, travelled, and carried back to the quiet country
cottage a hoard of observations to feast upon at leisure.</p>

<p>And what effect would all this have had upon the six novels that
Jane Austen did not write? She would not have written of crime, of
passion, or of adventure. She would not have been rushed by the
importunity of publishers or the flattery of friends into
slovenliness or insincerity. But she would have known more. Her
sense of security would have been shaken. Her comedy would have
suffered. She would have trusted less (this is already perceptible
in <i>Persuasion</i>) to dialogue and more to reflection to give us
a knowledge of her characters. Those marvellous little speeches
which sum up, in a few minutes' chatter, all that we need in order
to know an Admiral Croft or a Mrs. Musgrove for ever, that
shorthand, hit-or-miss method which contains chapters of analysis
and psychology, would have become too crude to hold all that she
now perceived of the complexity of human nature. She would have
devised a method, clear and composed as ever, but deeper and more
suggestive, for conveying not only what people say, but what they
leave unsaid; not only what they are, but what life is. She would
have stood farther away from her characters, and seen them more as
a group, less as individuals. Her satire, while it played less
incessantly, would have been more stringent and severe. She would
have been the forerunner of Henry James and of Proust&mdash;but
enough. Vain are these speculations: the most perfect artist among
women, the writer whose books are immortal, died "just as she was
beginning to feel confidence in her own success".</p>

<h1><a name="C12" id="C12">MODERN FICTION</a>
</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In making any survey, even the freest and loosest, of modern
fiction, it is difficult not to take it for granted that the modern
practice of the art is somehow an improvement upon the old. With
their simple tools and primitive materials, it might be said,
Fielding did well and Jane Austen even better, but compare their
opportunities with ours! Their masterpieces certainly have a
strange air of simplicity. And yet the analogy between literature
and the process, to choose an example, of making motor cars
scarcely holds good beyond the first glance. It is doubtful whether
in the course of the centuries, though we have learnt much about
making machines, we have learnt anything about making literature.
We do not come to write better; all that we can be said to do is to
keep moving, now a little in this direction, now in that, but with
a circular tendency should the whole course of the track be viewed
from a sufficiently lofty pinnacle. It need scarcely be said that
we make no claim to stand, even momentarily, upon that vantage
ground. On the flat, in the crowd, half blind with dust, we look
back with envy to those happier warriors, whose battle is won and
whose achievements wear so serene an air of accomplishment that we
can scarcely refrain from whispering that the fight was not so
fierce for them as for us. It is for the historian of literature to
decide; for him to say if we are now beginning or ending or
standing in the middle of a great period of prose fiction, for down
in the plain little is visible. We only know that certain
gratitudes and hostilities inspire us; that certain paths seem to
lead to fertile land, others to the dust and the desert; and of
this perhaps it may be worth while to attempt some account.</p>

<p>Our quarrel, then, is not with the classics, and if we speak of
quarrelling with Mr. Wells, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Galsworthy, it is
partly that by the mere fact of their existence in the flesh their
work has a living, breathing, everyday imperfection which bids us
take what liberties with it we choose. But it is also true that,
while we thank them for a thousand gifts, we reserve our
unconditional gratitude for Mr. Hardy, for Mr. Conrad, and in a
much lesser degree for the Mr. Hudson of <i>The Purple Land, Green
Mansions,</i> and <i>Far Away and Long Ago</i>. Mr. Wells, Mr.
Bennett, and Mr. Galsworthy have excited so many hopes and
disappointed them so persistently that our gratitude largely takes
the form of thanking them for having shown us what they might have
done but have not done; what we certainly could not do, but as
certainly, perhaps, do not wish to do. No single phrase will sum up
the charge or grievance which we have to bring against a mass of
work so large in its volume and embodying so many qualities, both
admirable and the reverse. If we tried to formulate our meaning in
one word we should say that these three writers are materialists.
It is because they are concerned not with the spirit but with the
body that they have disappointed us, and left us with the feeling
that the sooner English fiction turns its back upon them, as
politely as may be, and marches, if only into the desert, the
better for its soul. Naturally, no single word reaches the centre
of three separate targets. In the case of Mr. Wells it falls
notably wide of the mark. And yet even with him it indicates to our
thinking the fatal alloy in his genius, the great clod of clay that
has got itself mixed up with the purity of his inspiration. But Mr.
Bennett is perhaps the worst culprit of the three, inasmuch as he
is by far the best workman. He can make a book so well constructed
and solid in its craftsmanship that it is difficult for the most
exacting of critics to see through what chink or crevice decay can
creep in. There is not so much as a draught between the frames of
the windows, or a crack in the boards. And yet&mdash;if life should
refuse to live there? That is a risk which the creator of <i>The
Old Wives' Tale,</i> George Cannon, Edwin Clayhanger, and hosts of
other figures, may well claim to have surmounted. His characters
live abundantly, even unexpectedly, but it remains to ask how do
they live, and what do they live for? More and more they seem to
us, deserting even the well-built villa in the Five Towns, to spend
their time in some softly padded first-class railway carriage,
pressing bells and buttons innumerable; and the destiny to which
they travel so luxuriously becomes more and more unquestionably an
eternity of bliss spent in the very best hotel in Brighton. It can
scarcely be said of Mr. Wells that he is a materialist in the sense
that he takes too much delight in the solidity of his fabric. His
mind is too generous in its sympathies to allow him to spend much
time in making things shipshape and substantial. He is a
materialist from sheer goodness of heart, taking upon his shoulders
the work that ought to have been discharged by Government
officials, and in the plethora of his ideas and facts scarcely
having leisure to realise, or forgetting to think important, the
crudity and coarseness of his human beings. Yet what more damaging
criticism can there be both of his earth and of his Heaven than
that they are to be inhabited here and hereafter by his Joans and
his Peters? Does not the inferiority of their natures tarnish
whatever institutions and ideals may be provided for them by the
generosity of their creator? Nor, profoundly though we respect the
integrity and humanity of Mr. Galsworthy, shall we find what we
seek in his pages.</p>

<p>If we fasten, then, one label on all these books, on which is
one word materialists, we mean by it that they write of unimportant
things; that they spend immense skill and immense industry making
the trivial and the transitory appear the true and the
enduring.</p>

<p>We have to admit that we are exacting, and, further, that we
find it difficult to justify our discontent by explaining what it
is that we exact. We frame our question differently at different
times. But it reappears most persistently as we drop the finished
novel on the crest of a sigh&mdash;Is it worth while? What is the
point of it all? Can it be that, owing to one of those little
deviations which the human spirit seems to make from time to time,
Mr. Bennett has come down with his magnificent apparatus for
catching life just an inch or two on the wrong side? Life escapes;
and perhaps without life nothing else is worth while. It is a
confession of vagueness to have to make use of such a figure as
this, but we scarcely better the matter by speaking, as critics are
prone to do, of reality. Admitting the vagueness which afflicts all
criticism of novels, let us hazard the opinion that for us at this
moment the form of fiction most in vogue more often misses than
secures the thing we seek. Whether we call it life or spirit, truth
or reality, this, the essential thing, has moved off, or on, and
refuses to be contained any longer in such ill-fitting vestments as
we provide. Nevertheless, we go on perseveringly, conscientiously,
constructing our two and thirty chapters after a design which more
and more ceases to resemble the vision in our minds. So much of the
enormous labour of proving the solidity, the likeness to life, of
the story is not merely labour thrown away but labour misplaced to
the extent of obscuring and blotting out the light of the
conception. The writer seems constrained, not by his own free will
but by some powerful and unscrupulous tyrant who has him in thrall,
to provide a plot, to provide comedy, tragedy, love interest, and
an air of probability embalming the whole so impeccable that if all
his figures were to come to life they would find themselves dressed
down to the last button of their coats in the fashion of the hour.
The tyrant is obeyed; the novel is done to a turn. But sometimes,
more and more often as time goes by, we suspect a momentary doubt,
a spasm of rebellion, as the pages fill themselves in the customary
way. Is life like this? Must novels be like this?</p>

<p>Look within and life, it seems, is very far from being "like
this". Examine for a moment an ordinary mind on an ordinary day.
The mind receives a myriad impressions&mdash;trivial, fantastic,
evanescent, or engraved with the sharpness of steel. From all sides
they come, an incessant shower of innumerable atoms; and as they
fall, as they shape themselves into the life of Monday or Tuesday,
the accent falls differently from of old; the moment of importance
came not here but there; so that, if a writer were a free man and
not a slave, if he could write what he chose, not what he must, if
he could base his work upon his own feeling and not upon
convention, there would be no plot, no comedy, no tragedy, no love
interest or catastrophe in the accepted style, and perhaps not a
single button sewn on as the Bond Street tailors would have it.
Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged; life is a
luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us from the
beginning of consciousness to the end. Is it not the task of the
novelist to convey this varying, this unknown and uncircumscribed
spirit, whatever aberration or complexity it may display, with as
little mixture of the alien and external as possible? We are not
pleading merely for courage and sincerity; we are suggesting that
the proper stuff of fiction is a little other than custom would
have us believe it.</p>

<p>It is, at any rate, in some such fashion as this that we seek to
define the quality which distinguishes the work of several young
writers, among whom Mr. James Joyce is the most notable, from that
of their predecessors. They attempt to come closer to life, and to
preserve more sincerely and exactly what interests and moves them,
even if to do so they must discard most of the conventions which
are commonly observed by the novelist. Let us record the atoms as
they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall, let us
trace the pattern, however disconnected and incoherent in
appearance, which each sight or incident scores upon the
consciousness. Let us not take it for granted that life exists more
fully in what is commonly thought big than in what is commonly
thought small. Any one who has read <i>The Portrait of the Artist
as a Young Man</i> or, what promises to be a far more interesting
work, <i>Ulysses</i>,<sup>1</sup> now appearing in the <i>Little
Review,</i> will have hazarded some theory of this nature as to Mr.
Joyce's intention. On our part, with such a fragment before us, it
is hazarded rather than affirmed; but whatever the intention of the
whole, there can be no question but that it is of the utmost
sincerity and that the result, difficult or unpleasant as we may
judge it, is undeniably important. In contrast with those whom we
have called materialists, Mr. Joyce is spiritual; he is concerned
at all costs to reveal the flickerings of that innermost flame
which flashes its messages through the brain, and in order to
preserve it he disregards with complete courage whatever seems to
him adventitious, whether it be probability, or coherence, or any
other of these signposts which for generations have served to
support the imagination of a reader when called upon to imagine
what he can neither touch nor see. The scene in the cemetery, for
instance, with its brilliancy, its sordidity, its incoherence, its
sudden lightning flashes of significance, does undoubtedly come so
close to the quick of the mind that, on a first reading at any
rate, it is difficult not to acclaim a masterpiece. If we want life
itself, here surely we have it. Indeed, we find ourselves fumbling
rather awkwardly if we try to say what else we wish, and for what
reason a work of such originality yet fails to compare, for we must
take high examples, with <i>Youth</i> or <i>The Mayor of
Casterbridge.</i> It fails because of the comparative poverty of
the writer's mind, we might say simply and have done with it. But
it is possible to press a little further and wonder whether we may
not refer our sense of being in a bright yet narrow room, confined
and shut in, rather than enlarged and set free, to some limitation
imposed by the method as well as by the mind. Is it the method that
inhibits the creative power? Is it due to the method that we feel
neither jovial nor magnanimous, but centred in a self which, in
spite of its tremor of susceptibility, never embraces or creates
what is outside itself and beyond? Does the emphasis laid, perhaps
didactically, upon indecency, contribute to the effect of something
angular and isolated? Or is it merely that in any effort of such
originality it is much easier, for contemporaries especially, to
feel what it lacks than to name what it gives? In any case it is a
mistake to stand outside examining "methods". Any method is right,
every method is right, that expresses what we wish to express, if
we are writers; that brings us closer to the novelist's intention
if we are readers. This method has the merit of bringing us closer
to what we were prepared to call life itself; did not the reading
of <i>Ulysses</i> suggest how much of life is excluded or ignored,
and did it not come with a shock to open <i>Tristram Shandy</i> or
even <i>Pendennis</i> and be by them convinced that there are not
only other aspects of life, but more important ones into the
bargain.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Written April 1919.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However this may be, the problem before the novelist at present,
as we suppose it to have been in the past, is to contrive means of
being free to set down what he chooses. He has to have the courage
to say that what interests him is no longer "this" but "that": out
of "that" alone must he construct his work. For the moderns "that",
the point of interest, lies very likely in the dark places of
psychology. At once, therefore, the accent falls a little
differently; the emphasis is upon something hitherto ignored; at
once a different outline of form becomes necessary, difficult for
us to grasp, incomprehensible to our predecessors. No one but a
modern, no one perhaps but a Russian, would have felt the interest
of the situation which Tchekov has made into the short story which
he calls "Gusev". Some Russian soldiers lie ill on board a ship
which is taking them back to Russia. We are given a few scraps of
their talk and some of their thoughts; then one of them dies and is
carried away; the talk goes on among the others for a time, until
Gusev himself dies, and looking "like a carrot or a radish" is
thrown overboard. The emphasis is laid upon such unexpected places
that at first it seems as if there were no emphasis at all; and
then, as the eyes accustom themselves to twilight and discern the
shapes of things in a room we see how complete the story is, how
profound, and how truly in obedience to his vision Tchekov has
chosen this, that, and the other, and placed them together to
compose something new. But it is impossible to say "this is comic",
or "that is tragic", nor are we certain, since short stories, we
have been taught, should be brief and conclusive, whether this,
which is vague and inconclusive, should be called a short story at
all.</p>

<p>The most elementary remarks upon modern English fiction can
hardly avoid some mention of the Russian influence, and if the
Russians are mentioned one runs the risk of feeling that to write
of any fiction save theirs is waste of time. If we want
understanding of the soul and heart where else shall we find it of
comparable profundity? If we are sick of our own materialism the
least considerable of their novelists has by right of birth a
natural reverence for the human spirit. "Learn to make yourself
akin to people....But let this sympathy be not with the
mind&mdash;for it is easy with the mind&mdash;but with the heart,
with love towards them." In every great Russian writer we seem to
discern the features of a saint, if sympathy for the sufferings of
others, love towards them, endeavour to reach some goal worthy of
the most exacting demands of the spirit constitute saintliness. It
is the saint in them which confounds us with a feeling of our own
irreligious triviality, and turns so many of our famous novels to
tinsel and trickery. The conclusions of the Russian mind, thus
comprehensive and compassionate, are inevitably, perhaps, of the
utmost sadness. More accurately indeed we might speak of the
inconclusiveness of the Russian mind. It is the sense that there is
no answer, that if honestly examined life presents question after
question which must be left to sound on and on after the story is
over in hopeless interrogation that fills us with a deep, and
finally it may be with a resentful, despair. They are right
perhaps; unquestionably they see further than we do and without our
gross impediments of vision. But perhaps we see something that
escapes them, or why should this voice of protest mix itself with
our gloom? The voice of protest is the voice of another and an
ancient civilisation which seems to have bred in us the instinct to
enjoy and fight rather than to suffer and understand. English
fiction from Sterne to Meredith bears witness to our natural
delight in humour and comedy, in the beauty of earth, in the
activities of the intellect, and in the splendour of the body. But
any deductions that we may draw from the comparison of two fictions
so immeasurably far apart are futile save indeed as they flood us
with a view of the infinite possibilities of the art and remind us
that there is no limit to the horizon, and that nothing&mdash;no
"method", no experiment, even of the wildest&mdash;is forbidden,
but only falsity and pretence. "The proper stuff of fiction" does
not exist; everything is the proper stuff of fiction, every
feeling, every thought; every quality of brain and spirit is drawn
upon; no perception comes amiss. And if we can imagine the art of
fiction come alive and standing in our midst, she would undoubtedly
bid us break her and bully her, as well as honour and love her, for
so her youth is renewed and her sovereignty assured.</p>

<h1><a name="C13" id="C13">"JANE EYRE" AND "WUTHERING
HEIGHTS"</a><sup>1</sup>
</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of the hundred years that have passed since Charlotte
Bront&euml; was born, she, the centre now of so much legend,
devotion, and literature, lived but thirty-nine. It is strange to
reflect how different those legends might have been had her life
reached the ordinary human span. She might have become, like some
of her famous contemporaries, a figure familiarly met with in
London and elsewhere, the subject of pictures and anecdotes
innumerable, the writer of many novels, of memoirs possibly,
removed from us well within the memory of the middle-aged in all
the splendour of established fame. She might have been wealthy, she
might have been prosperous. But it is not so. When we think of her
we have to imagine some one who had no lot in our modern world; we
have to cast our minds back to the 'fifties of the last century, to
a remote parsonage upon the wild Yorkshire moors. In that
parsonage, and on those moors, unhappy and lonely, in her poverty
and her exaltation, she remains for ever.</p>

<p><sup>&nbsp;</sup>
</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Written in 1916.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These circumstances, as they affected her character, may have
left their traces on her work. A novelist, we reflect, is bound to
build up his structure with much very perishable material which
begins by lending it reality and ends by cumbering it with rubbish.
As we open <i>Jane Eyre</i> once more we cannot stifle the
suspicion that we shall find her world of imagination as
antiquated, mid-Victorian, and out of date as the parsonage on the
moor, a place only to be visited by the curious, only preserved by
the pious. So we open <i>Jane Eyre;</i> and in two pages every
doubt is swept clean from our minds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to
the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not
separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while
turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that
winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud;
near, a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain
sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is nothing there more perishable than the moor itself, or
more subject to the sway of fashion than the "long and lamentable
blast". Nor is this exhilaration short-lived. It rushes us through
the entire volume, without giving us time to think, without letting
us lift our eyes from the page. So intense is our absorption that
if some one moves in the room the movement seems to take place not
there but up in Yorkshire. The writer has us by the hand, forces us
along her road, makes us see what she sees, never leaves us for a
moment or allows us to forget her. At the end we are steeped
through and through with the genius, the vehemence, the indignation
of Charlotte Bront&euml;. Remarkable faces, figures of strong
outline and gnarled feature have flashed upon us in passing; but it
is through her eyes that we have seen them. Once she is gone, we
seek for them in vain. Think of Rochester and we have to think of
Jane Eyre. Think of the moor, and again there is Jane Eyre. Think
of the drawing-room,<sup>1</sup> even, those "white carpets on
which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers", that "pale Parian
mantelpiece" with its Bohemia glass of "ruby red" and the "general
blending of snow and fire"&mdash;what is all that except Jane
Eyre?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Charlotte and Emily Bront&euml; had much the same
sense of colour. "...we saw&mdash;ah! it was beautiful&mdash;a
splendid place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs
and tables, and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of
glass drops hanging in silver chains from the centre, and
shimmering with little soft tapers" (<i>Wuthering Heights</i>).
"Yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a
boudoir, both spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid
brilliant garlands of flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of
white grapes and vine leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast
crimson couches and ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale
Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemia glass, ruby red; and
between the windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of
snow and fire" (<i>Jane Eyre</i>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The drawbacks of being Jane Eyre are not far to seek. Always to
be a governess and always to be in love is a serious limitation in
a world which is full, after all, of people who are neither one nor
the other. The characters of a Jane Austen or of a Tolstoi have a
million facets compared with these. They live and are complex by
means of their effect upon many different people who serve to
mirror them in the round. They move hither and thither whether
their creators watch them or not, and the world in which they live
seems to us an independent world which we can visit, now that they
have created it, by ourselves. Thomas Hardy is more akin to
Charlotte Bront&euml; in the power of his personality and the
narrowness of his vision. But the differences are vast. As we read
<i>Jude the Obscure</i> we are not rushed to a finish; we brood and
ponder and drift away from the text in plethoric trains of thought
which build up round the characters an atmosphere of question and
suggestion of which they are themselves, as often as not,
unconscious. Simple peasants as they are, we are forced to confront
them with destinies and questionings of the hugest import, so that
often it seems as if the most important characters in a Hardy novel
are those which have no names. Of this power, of this speculative
curiosity, Charlotte Bront&euml; has no trace. She does not attempt
to solve the problems of human life; she is even unaware that such
problems exist; all her force, and it is the more tremendous for
being constricted, goes into the assertion, "I love", "I hate", "I
suffer".</p>

<p>For the self-centred and self-limited writers have a power
denied the more catholic and broad-minded. Their impressions are
close packed and strongly stamped between their narrow walls.
Nothing issues from their minds which has not been marked with
their own impress. They learn little from other writers, and what
they adopt they cannot assimilate. Both Hardy and Charlotte
Bront&euml; appear to have founded their styles upon a stiff and
decorous journalism. The staple of their prose is awkward and
unyielding. But both with labour and the most obstinate integrity,
by thinking every thought until it has subdued words to itself,
have forged for themselves a prose which takes the mould of their
minds entire; which has, into the bargain, a beauty, a power, a
swiftness of its own. Charlotte Bront&euml;, at least, owed nothing
to the reading of many books. She never learnt the smoothness of
the professional writer, or acquired his ability to stuff and sway
his language as he chooses. "I could never rest in communication
with strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female",
she writes, as any leader-writer in a provincial journal might have
written; but gathering fire and speed goes on in her own authentic
voice "till I had passed the outworks of conventional reserve and
crossed the threshold of confidence, and won a place by their
hearts' very hearthstone". It is there that she takes her seat; it
is the red and fitful glow of the heart's fire which illumines her
page. In other words, we read Charlotte Bront&euml; not for
exquisite observation of character&mdash;her characters are
vigorous and elementary; not for comedy&mdash;hers is grim and
crude; not for a philosophic view of life&mdash;hers is that of a
country parson's daughter; but for her poetry. Probably that is so
with all writers who have, as she has, an overpowering personality,
so that, as we say in real life, they have only to open the door to
make themselves felt. There is in them some untamed ferocity
perpetually at war with the accepted order of things which makes
them desire to create instantly rather than to observe patiently.
This very ardour, rejecting half shades and other minor
impediments, wings its way past the daily conduct of ordinary
people and allies itself with their more inarticulate passions. It
makes them poets, or, if they choose to write in prose, intolerant
of its restrictions. Hence it is that both Emily and Charlotte are
always invoking the help of nature. They both feel the need of some
more powerful symbol of the vast and slumbering passions in human
nature than words or actions can convey. It is with a description
of a storm that Charlotte ends her finest novel <i>Villette</i>.
"The skies hang full and dark&mdash;a wrack sails from the west;
the clouds cast themselves into strange forms." So she calls in
nature to describe a state of mind which could not otherwise be
expressed. But neither of the sisters observed nature accurately as
Dorothy Wordsworth observed it, or painted it minutely as Tennyson
painted it. They seized those aspects of the earth which were most
akin to what they themselves felt or imputed to their characters,
and so their storms, their moors, their lovely spaces of summer
weather are not ornaments applied to decorate a dull page or
display the writer's powers of observation&mdash;they carry on the
emotion and light up the meaning of the book.</p>

<p>The meaning of a book, which lies so often apart from what
happens and what is said and consists rather in some connection
which things in themselves different have had for the writer, is
necessarily hard to grasp. Especially this is so when, like the
Bront&euml;s, the writer is poetic, and his meaning inseparable
from his language, and itself rather a mood than a particular
observation. <i>Wuthering Heights</i> is a more difficult book to
understand than <i>Jane Eyre,</i> because Emily was a greater poet
than Charlotte. When Charlotte wrote she said with eloquence and
splendour and passion "I love", "I hate", "I suffer". Her
experience, though more intense, is on a level with our own. But
there is no "I" in <i>Wuthering Heights.</i> There are no
governesses. There are no employers. There is love, but it is not
the love of men and women. Emily was inspired by some more general
conception. The impulse which urged her to create was not her own
suffering or her own injuries. She looked out upon a world cleft
into gigantic disorder and felt within her the power to unite it in
a book. That gigantic ambition is to be felt throughout the
novel&mdash;a struggle, half thwarted but of superb conviction, to
say something through the mouths of her characters which is not
merely "I love" or "I hate", but "we, the whole human race" and
"you, the eternal powers ..." the sentence remains unfinished. It
is not strange that it should be so; rather it is astonishing that
she can make us feel what she had it in her to say at all. It
surges up in the half-articulate words of Catherine Earnshaw, "If
all else perished and <i>he</i> remained, I should still continue
to be; and if all else remained and he were annihilated, the
universe would turn to a mighty stranger; I should not seem part of
it". It breaks out again in the presence of the dead. "I see a
repose that neither earth nor hell can break, and I feel an
assurance of the endless and shadowless hereafter&mdash;the
eternity they have entered&mdash;where life is boundless in its
duration, and love in its sympathy and joy in its fulness." It is
this suggestion of power underlying the apparitions of human nature
and lifting them up into the presence of greatness that gives the
book its huge stature among other novels. But it was not enough for
Emily Bront&euml; to write a few lyrics, to utter a cry, to express
a creed. In her poems she did this once and for all, and her poems
will perhaps outlast her novel. But she was novelist as well as
poet. She must take upon herself a more laborious and a more
ungrateful task. She must face the fact of other existences,
grapple with the mechanism of external things, build up, in
recognisable shape, farms and houses and report the speeches of men
and women who existed independently of herself. And so we reach
these summits of emotion not by rant or rhapsody but by hearing a
girl sing old songs to herself as she rocks in the branches of a
tree; by watching the moor sheep crop the turf; by listening to the
soft wind breathing through the grass. The life at the farm with
all its absurdities and its improbability is laid open to us. We
are given every opportunity of comparing <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
with a real farm and Heathcliff with a real man. How, we are
allowed to ask, can there be truth or insight or the finer shades
of emotion in men and women who so little resemble what we have
seen ourselves? But even as we ask it we see in Heathcliff the
brother that a sister of genius might have seen; he is impossible
we say, but nevertheless no boy in literature has a more vivid
existence than his. So it is with the two Catherines; never could
women feel as they do or act in their manner, we say. All the same,
they are the most lovable women in English fiction. It is as if she
could tear up all that we know human beings by, and fill these
unrecognisable transparences with such a gust of life that they
transcend reality. Hers, then, is the rarest of all powers. She
could free life from its dependence on facts; with a few touches
indicate the spirit of a face so that it needs no body; by speaking
of the moor make the wind blow and the thunder roar.</p>

<h1><a name="C14" id="C14">GEORGE ELIOT</a>
</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To read George Eliot attentively is to become aware how little
one knows about her. It is also to become aware of the credulity,
not very creditable to one's insight, with which, half consciously
and partly maliciously, one had accepted the late Victorian version
of a deluded woman who held phantom sway over subjects even more
deluded than herself. At what moment and by what means her spell
was broken it is difficult to ascertain. Some people attribute it
to the publication of her <i>Life.</i> Perhaps George Meredith,
with his phrase about the "mercurial little showman" and the
"errant woman" on the da&iuml;s, gave point and poison to the
arrows of thousands incapable of aiming them so accurately, but
delighted to let fly. She became one of the butts for youth to
laugh at, the convenient symbol of a group of serious people who
were all guilty of the same idolatry and could be dismissed with
the same scorn. Lord Acton had said that she was greater than
Dante; Herbert Spencer exempted her novels, as if they were not
novels, when he banned all fiction from the London Library. She was
the pride and paragon of her sex. Moreover, her private record was
not more alluring than her public. Asked to describe an afternoon
at the Priory, the story-teller always intimated that the memory of
those serious Sunday afternoons had come to tickle his sense of
humour. He had been so much alarmed by the grave lady in her low
chair; he had been so anxious to say the intelligent thing.
Certainly, the talk had been very serious, as a note in the fine
clear hand of the great novelist bore witness. It was dated on the
Monday morning, and she accused herself of having spoken without
due forethought of Marivaux when she meant another; but no doubt,
she said, her listener had already supplied the correction. Still,
the memory of talking about Marivaux to George Eliot on a Sunday
afternoon was not a romantic memory. It had faded with the passage
of the years. It had not become picturesque.</p>

<p>Indeed, one cannot escape the conviction that the long, heavy
face with its expression of serious and sullen and almost equine
power has stamped itself depressingly upon the minds of people who
remember George Eliot, so that it looks out upon them from her
pages. Mr. Gosse has lately described her as he saw her driving
through London in a victoria:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a large, thick-set sybil, dreamy and immobile, whose massive
features, somewhat grim when seen in profile, were incongruously
bordered by a hat, always in the height of Paris fashion, which in
those days commonly included an immense ostrich feather.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lady Ritchie, with equal skill, has left a more intimate indoor
portrait:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She sat by the fire in a beautiful black satin gown, with a
green shaded lamp on the table beside her, where I saw German books
lying and pamphlets and ivory paper-cutters. She was very quiet and
noble, with two steady little eyes and a sweet voice. As I looked I
felt her to be a friend, not exactly a personal friend, but a good
and benevolent impulse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A scrap of her talk is preserved. "We ought to respect our
influence," she said. "We know by our own experience how very much
others affect our lives, and we must remember that we in turn must
have the same effect upon others." Jealously treasured, committed
to memory, one can imagine recalling the scene, repeating the
words, thirty years later and suddenly, for the first time,
bursting into laughter.</p>

<p>In all these records one feels that the recorder, even when he
was in the actual presence, kept his distance and kept his head,
and never read the novels in later years with the light of a vivid,
or puzzling, or beautiful personality dazzling in his eyes. In
fiction, where so much of personality is revealed, the absence of
charm is a great lack; and her critics, who have been, of course,
mostly of the opposite sex, have resented, half consciously
perhaps, her deficiency in a quality which is held to be supremely
desirable in women. George Eliot was not charming; she was not
strongly feminine; she had none of those eccentricities and
inequalities of temper which give to so many artists the endearing
simplicity of children. One feels that to most people, as to Lady
Ritchie, she was "not exactly a personal friend, but a good and
benevolent impulse". But if we consider these portraits more
closely we shall find that they are all the portraits of an elderly
celebrated woman, dressed in black satin, driving in her victoria,
a woman who has been through her struggle and issued from it with a
profound desire to be of use to others, but with no wish for
intimacy, save with the little circle who had known her in the days
of her youth. We know very little about the days of her youth; but
we do know that the culture, the philosophy, the fame, and the
influence were all built upon a very humble foundation&mdash;she
was the grand-daughter of a carpenter.</p>

<p>The first volume of her life is a singularly depressing record.
In it we see her raising herself with groans and struggles from the
intolerable boredom of petty provincial society (her father had
risen in the world and become more middle class, but less
picturesque) to be the assistant editor of a highly intellectual
London review, and the esteemed companion of Herbert Spencer. The
stages are painful as she reveals them in the sad soliloquy in
which Mr. Cross condemned her to tell the story of her life. Marked
in early youth as one "sure to get something up very soon in the
way of a clothing club", she proceeded to raise funds for restoring
a church by making a chart of ecclesiastical history; and that was
followed by a loss of faith which so disturbed her father that he
refused to live with her. Next came the struggle with the
translation of Strauss, which, dismal and "soul-stupefying" in
itself, can scarcely have been made less so by the usual feminine
tasks of ordering a household and nursing a dying father, and the
distressing conviction, to one so dependent upon affection, that by
becoming a blue-stocking she was forfeiting her brother's respect.
"I used to go about like an owl," she said, "to the great disgust
of my brother." "Poor thing," wrote a friend who saw her toiling
through Strauss with a statue of the risen Christ in front of her,
"I do pity her sometimes, with her pale sickly face and dreadful
headaches, and anxiety, too, about her father." Yet, though we
cannot read the story without a strong desire that the stages of
her pilgrimage might have been made, if not more easy, at least
more beautiful, there is a dogged determination in her advance upon
the citadel of culture which raises it above our pity. Her
development was very slow and very awkward, but it had the
irresistible impetus behind it of a deep-seated and noble ambition.
Every obstacle at length was thrust from her path. She knew every
one. She read everything. Her astonishing intellectual vitality had
triumphed. Youth was over, but youth had been full of suffering.
Then, at the age of thirty-five, at the height of her powers, and
in the fulness of her freedom, she made the decision which was of
such profound moment to her and still matters even to us, and went
to Weimar, alone with George Henry Lewes.</p>

<p>The books which followed so soon after her union testify in the
fullest manner to the great liberation which had come to her with
personal happiness. In themselves they provide us with a plentiful
feast. Yet at the threshold of her literary career one may find in
some of the circumstances of her life influences that turned her
mind to the past, to the country village, to the quiet and beauty
and simplicity of childish memories and away from herself and the
present. We understand how it was that her first book was <i>Scenes
of Clerical Life,</i> and not <i>Middlemarch.</i> Her union with
Lewes had surrounded her with affection, but in view of the
circumstances and of the conventions it had also isolated her. "I
wish it to be understood", she wrote in 1857, "that I should never
invite any one to come and see me who did not ask for the
invitation." She had been "cut off from what is called the world",
she said later, but she did not regret it. By becoming thus marked,
first by circumstances and later, inevitably, by her fame, she lost
the power to move on equal terms unnoted among her kind; and the
loss for a novelist was serious. Still, basking in the light and
sunshine of <i>Scenes of Clerical Life,</i> feeling the large
mature mind spreading itself with a luxurious sense of freedom in
the world of her "remotest past", to speak of loss seems
inappropriate. Everything to such a mind was gain. All experience
filtered down through layer after layer of perception and
reflection, enriching and nourishing. The utmost we can say, in
qualifying her attitude towards fiction by what little we know of
her life, is that she had taken to heart certain lessons not
usually learnt early, if learnt at all, among which, perhaps, the
most branded upon her was the melancholy virtue of tolerance; her
sympathies are with the everyday lot, and play most happily in
dwelling upon the homespun of ordinary joys and sorrows. She has
none of that romantic intensity which is connected with a sense of
one's own individuality, unsated and unsubdued, cutting its shape
sharply upon the background of the world. What were the loves and
sorrows of a snuffy old clergyman, dreaming over his whisky, to the
fiery egotism of Jane Eyre? The beauty of those first books,
<i>Scenes of Clerical Life, Adam Bede, The Mill on the Floss,</i>
is very great. It is impossible to estimate the merit of the
Poysers, the Dodsons, the Gilfils, the Bartons, and the rest with
all their surroundings and dependencies, because they have put on
flesh and blood and we move among them, now bored, now sympathetic,
but always with that unquestioning acceptance of all that they say
and do, which we accord to the great originals only. The flood of
memory and humour which she pours so spontaneously into one figure,
one scene after another, until the whole fabric of ancient rural
England is revived, has so much in common with a natural process
that it leaves us with little consciousness that there is anything
to criticise. We accept; we feel the delicious warmth and release
of spirit which the great creative writers alone procure for us. As
one comes back to the books after years of absence they pour out,
even against our expectation, the same store of energy and heat, so
that we want more than anything to idle in the warmth as in the sun
beating down from the red orchard wall. If there is an element of
unthinking abandonment in thus submitting to the humours of Midland
farmers and their wives, that, too, is right in the circumstances.
We scarcely wish to analyse what we feel to be so large and deeply
human. And when we consider how distant in time the world of
Shepperton and Hayslope is, and how remote the minds of farmer and
agricultural labourers from those of most of George Eliot's
readers, we can only attribute the ease and pleasure with which we
ramble from house to smithy, from cottage parlour to rectory
garden, to the fact that George Eliot makes us share their lives,
not in a spirit of condescension or of curiosity, but in a spirit
of sympathy. She is no satirist. The movement of her mind was too
slow and cumbersome to lend itself to comedy. But she gathers in
her large grasp a great bunch of the main elements of human nature
and groups them loosely together with a tolerant and wholesome
understanding which, as one finds upon re-reading, has not only
kept her figures fresh and free, but has given them an unexpected
hold upon our laughter and tears. There is the famous Mrs. Poyser.
It would have been easy to work her idiosyncrasies to death, and,
as it is, perhaps, George Eliot gets her laugh in the same place a
little too often. But memory, after the book is shut, brings out,
as sometimes in real life, the details and subtleties which some
more salient characteristic has prevented us from noticing at the
time. We recollect that her health was not good. There were
occasions upon which she said nothing at all. She was patience
itself with a sick child. She doted upon Totty. Thus one can muse
and speculate about the greater number of George Eliot's characters
and find, even in the least important, a roominess and margin where
those qualities lurk which she has no call to bring from their
obscurity.</p>

<p>But in the midst of all this tolerance and sympathy there are,
even in the early books, moments of greater stress. Her humour has
shown itself broad enough to cover a wide range of fools and
failures, mothers and children, dogs and flourishing midland
fields, farmers, sagacious or fuddled over their ale,
horse-dealers, inn-keepers, curates, and carpenters. Over them all
broods a certain romance, the only romance that George Eliot
allowed herself&mdash;the romance of the past. The books are
astonishingly readable and have no trace of pomposity or pretence.
But to the reader who holds a large stretch of her early work in
view it will become obvious that the mist of recollection gradually
withdraws. It is not that her power diminishes, for, to our
thinking, it is at its highest in the mature <i>Middlemarch,</i>
the magnificent book which with all its imperfections is one of the
few English novels written for grown-up people. But the world of
fields and farms no longer contents her. In real life she had
sought her fortunes elsewhere; and though to look back into the
past was calming and consoling, there are, even in the early works,
traces of that troubled spirit, that exacting and questioning and
baffled presence who was George Eliot herself. In <i>Adam Bede</i>
there is a hint of her in Dinah. She shows herself far more openly
and completely in Maggie in <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>. She is
Janet in <i>Janet's Repentance,</i> and Romola, and Dorothea
seeking wisdom and finding one scarcely knows what in marriage with
Ladislaw. Those who fall foul of George Eliot do so, we incline to
think, on account of her heroines; and with good reason; for there
is no doubt that they bring out the worst of her, lead her into
difficult places, make her self-conscious, didactic, and
occasionally vulgar. Yet if you could delete the whole sisterhood
you would leave a much smaller and a much inferior world, albeit a
world of greater artistic perfection and far superior jollity and
comfort. In accounting for her failure, in so far as it was a
failure, one recollects that she never wrote a story until she was
thirty-seven, and that by the time she was thirty-seven she had
come to think of herself with a mixture of pain and something like
resentment. For long she preferred not to think of herself at all.
Then, when the first flush of creative energy was exhausted and
self-confidence had come to her, she wrote more and more from the
personal standpoint, but she did so without the unhesitating
abandonment of the young. Her self-consciousness is always marked
when her heroines say what she herself would have said. She
disguised them in every possible way. She granted them beauty and
wealth into the bargain; she invented, more improbably, a taste for
brandy. But the disconcerting and stimulating fact remained that
she was compelled by the very power of her genius to step forth in
person upon the quiet bucolic scene.</p>

<p>The noble and beautiful girl who insisted upon being born into
the Mill on the Floss is the most obvious example of the ruin which
a heroine can strew about her. Humour controls her and keeps her
lovable so long as she is small and can be satisfied by eloping
with the gipsies or hammering nails into her doll; but she
develops; and before George Eliot knows what has happened she has a
full-grown woman on her hands demanding what neither gipsies, nor
dolls, nor St. Ogg's itself is capable of giving her. First Philip
Wakem is produced, and later Stephen Guest. The weakness of the one
and the coarseness of the other have often been pointed out; but
both, in their weakness and coarseness, illustrate not so much
George Eliot's inability to draw the portrait of a man, as the
uncertainty, the infirmity, and the fumbling which shook her hand
when she had to conceive a fit mate for a heroine. She is in the
first place driven beyond the home world she knew and loved, and
forced to set foot in middle-class drawing-rooms where young men
sing all the summer morning and young women sit embroidering
smoking-caps for bazaars. She feels herself out of her element, as
her clumsy satire of what she calls "good society" proves.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Good society has its claret and its velvet carpets, its dinner
engagements six weeks deep, its opera, and its faery ball rooms
...gets its science done by Faraday and its religion by the
superior clergy who are to be met in the best houses; how should it
have need of belief and emphasis?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no trace of humour or insight there, but only the
vindictiveness of a grudge which we feel to be personal in its
origin. But terrible as the complexity of our social system is in
its demands upon the sympathy and discernment of a novelist
straying across the boundaries, Maggie Tulliver did worse than drag
George Eliot from her natural surroundings. She insisted upon the
introduction of the great emotional scene. She must love; she must
despair; she must be drowned clasping her brother in her arms. The
more one examines the great emotional scenes the more nervously one
anticipates the brewing and gathering and thickening of the cloud
which will burst upon our heads at the moment of crisis in a shower
of disillusionment and verbosity. It is partly that her hold upon
dialogue, when it is not dialect, is slack; and partly that she
seems to shrink with an elderly dread of fatigue from the effort of
emotional concentration. She allows her heroines to talk too much.
She has little verbal felicity. She lacks the unerring taste which
chooses one sentence and compresses the heart of the scene within
that. "Whom are you going to dance with?" asked Mr. Knightley, at
the Westons' ball. "With you, if you will ask me," said Emma; and
she has said enough. Mrs. Casaubon would have talked for an hour
and we should have looked out of the window.</p>

<p>Yet, dismiss the heroines without sympathy, confine George Eliot
to the agricultural world of her "remotest past", and you not only
diminish her greatness but lose her true flavour. That greatness is
here we can have no doubt. The width of the prospect, the large
strong outlines of the principal features, the ruddy light of the
early books, the searching power and reflective richness of the
later tempt us to linger and expatiate beyond our limits. But it is
upon the heroines that we would cast a final glance. "I have always
been finding out my religion since I was a little girl," says
Dorothea Casaubon. "I used to pray so much&mdash;now I hardly ever
pray. I try not to have desires merely for myself..." She is
speaking for them all. That is their problem. They cannot live
without religion, and they start out on the search for one when
they are little girls. Each has the deep feminine passion for
goodness, which makes the place where she stands in aspiration and
agony the heart of the book&mdash;still and cloistered like a place
of worship, but that she no longer knows to whom to pray. In
learning they seek their goal; in the ordinary tasks of womanhood;
in the wider service of their kind. They do not find what they
seek, and we cannot wonder. The ancient consciousness of woman,
charged with suffering and sensibility, and for so many ages dumb,
seems in them to have brimmed and overflowed and uttered a demand
for something&mdash;they scarcely know what&mdash;for something
that is perhaps incompatible with the facts of human existence.
George Eliot had far too strong an intelligence to tamper with
those facts, and too broad a humour to mitigate the truth because
it was a stern one. Save for the supreme courage of their
endeavour, the struggle ends, for her heroines, in tragedy, or in a
compromise that is even more melancholy. But their story is the
incomplete version of the story of George Eliot herself. For her,
too, the burden and the complexity of womanhood were not enough;
she must reach beyond the sanctuary and pluck for herself the
strange bright fruits of art and knowledge. Clasping them as few
women have ever clasped them, she would not renounce her own
inheritance&mdash;the difference of view, the difference of
standard&mdash;nor accept an inappropriate reward. Thus we behold
her, a memorable figure, inordinately praised and shrinking from
her fame, despondent, reserved, shuddering back into the arms of
love as if there alone were satisfaction and, it might be,
justification, at the same time reaching out with "a fastidious yet
hungry ambition" for all that life could offer the free and
inquiring mind and confronting her feminine aspirations with the
real world of men. Triumphant was the issue for her, whatever it
may have been for her creations, and as we recollect all that she
dared and achieved, how with every obstacle against her&mdash;sex
and health and convention&mdash;she sought more knowledge and more
freedom till the body, weighted with its double burden, sank worn
out, we must lay upon her grave whatever we have it in our power to
bestow of laurel and rose.</p>

<h1><a name="C15" id="C15">THE RUSSIAN POINT OF VIEW</a>
</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Doubtful as we frequently are whether either the French or the
Americans, who have so much in common with us, can yet understand
English literature, we must admit graver doubts whether, for all
their enthusiasm, the English can understand Russian literature.
Debate might protract itself indefinitely as to what we mean by
"understand". Instances will occur to everybody of American writers
in particular who have written with the highest discrimination of
our literature and of ourselves; who have lived a lifetime among
us, and finally have taken legal steps to become subjects of King
George. For all that, have they understood us, have they not
remained to the end of their days foreigners? Could any one believe
that the novels of Henry James were written by a man who had grown
up in the society which he describes, or that his criticism of
English writers was written by a man who had read Shakespeare
without any sense of the Atlantic Ocean and two or three hundred
years on the far side of it separating his civilisation from ours?
A special acuteness and detachment, a sharp angle of vision the
foreigner will often achieve; but not that absence of
self-consciousness, that ease and fellowship and sense of common
values which make for intimacy, and sanity, and the quick give and
take of familiar intercourse.</p>

<p>Not only have we all this to separate us from Russian
literature, but a much more serious barrier&mdash;the difference of
language. Of all those who feasted upon Tolstoi, Dostoevsky, and
Tchekov during the past twenty years, not more than one or two
perhaps have been able to read them in Russian. Our estimate of
their qualities has been formed by critics who have never read a
word of Russian, or seen Russia, or even heard the language spoken
by natives; who have had to depend, blindly and implicitly, upon
the work of translators.</p>

<p>What we are saying amounts to this, then, that we have judged a
whole literature stripped of its style. When you have changed every
word in a sentence from Russian to English, have thereby altered
the sense a little, the sound, weight, and accent of the words in
relation to each other completely, nothing remains except a crude
and coarsened version of the sense. Thus treated, the great Russian
writers are like men deprived by an earthquake or a railway
accident not only of all their clothes, but also of something
subtler and more important&mdash;their manners, the idiosyncrasies
of their characters. What remains is, as the English have proved by
the fanaticism of their admiration, something very powerful and
very impressive, but it is difficult to feel sure, in view of these
mutilations, how far we can trust ourselves not to impute, to
distort, to read into them an emphasis which is false.</p>

<p>They have lost their clothes, we say, in some terrible
catastrophe, for some such figure as that describes the simplicity,
the humanity, startled out of all effort to hide and disguise its
instincts, which Russian literature, whether it is due to
translation or to some more profound cause, makes upon us. We find
these qualities steeping it through, as obvious in the lesser
writers as in the greater. "Learn to make yourselves akin to
people. I would even like to add: make yourself indispensable to
them. But let this sympathy be not with the mind&mdash;for it is
easy with the mind&mdash;but with the heart, with love towards
them." "From the Russian", one would say instantly, where-ever one
chanced on that quotation. The simplicity, the absence of effort,
the assumption that in a world bursting with misery the chief call
upon us is to understand our fellow-sufferers, "and not with the
mind&mdash;for it is easy with the mind&mdash;but with the
heart"&mdash;this is the cloud which broods above the whole of
Russian literature, which lures us from our own parched brilliancy
and scorched thoroughfares to expand in its shade&mdash;and of
course with disastrous results. We become awkward and
self-conscious; denying our own qualities, we write with an
affectation of goodness and simplicity which is nauseating in the
extreme. We cannot say "Brother" with simple conviction. There is a
story by Mr. Galsworthy in which one of the characters so addresses
another (they are both in the depths of misfortune). Immediately
everything becomes strained and affected. The English equivalent
for "Brother" is "Mate"&mdash;a very different word, with something
sardonic in it, an indefinable suggestion of humour. Met though
they are in the depths of misfortune the two Englishmen who thus
accost each other will, we are sure, find a job, make their
fortunes, spend the last years of their lives in luxury, and leave
a sum of money to prevent poor devils from calling each other
"Brother" on the Embankment. But it is common suffering, rather
than common happiness, effort, or desire that produces the sense of
brotherhood. It is the "deep sadness" which Dr. Hagberg Wright
finds typical of the Russian people that creates their
literature.</p>

<p>A generalisation of this kind will, of course, even if it has
some degree of truth when applied to the body of literature, be
changed profoundly when a writer of genius sets to work on it. At
once other questions arise. It is seen that an "attitude" is not
simple; it is highly complex. Men reft of their coats and their
manners, stunned by a railway accident, say hard things, harsh
things, unpleasant things, difficult things, even if they say them
with the abandonment and simplicity which catastrophe has bred in
them. Our first impressions of Tchekov are not of simplicity but of
bewilderment. What is the point of it, and why does he make a story
out of this? we ask as we read story after story. A man falls in
love with a married woman, and they part and meet, and in the end
are left talking about their position and by what means they can be
free from "this intolerable bondage".</p>

<p>"'How? How?' he asked, clutching his head....And it seemed as
though in a little while the solution would be found and then a new
and splendid life would begin." That is the end. A postman drives a
student to the station and all the way the student tries to make
the postman talk, but he remains silent. Suddenly the postman says
unexpectedly, "It's against the regulations to take any one with
the post". And he walks up and down the platform with a look of
anger on his face. "With whom was he angry? Was it with people,
with poverty, with the autumn nights?" Again, that story ends.</p>

<p>But is it the end, we ask? We have rather the feeling that we
have overrun our signals; or it is as if a tune had stopped short
without the expected chords to close it. These stories are
inconclusive, we say, and proceed to frame a criticism based upon
the assumption that stories ought to conclude in a way that we
recognise. In so doing, we raise the question of our own fitness as
readers. Where the tune is familiar and the end
emphatic&mdash;lovers united, villains discomfited, intrigues
exposed&mdash;as it is in most Victorian fiction, we can scarcely
go wrong, but where the tune is unfamiliar and the end a note of
interrogation or merely the information that they went on talking,
as it is in Tchekov, we need a very daring and alert sense of
literature to make us hear the tune, and in particular those last
notes which complete the harmony. Probably we have to read a great
many stories before we feel, and the feeling is essential to our
satisfaction, that we hold the parts together, and that Tchekov was
not merely rambling disconnectedly, but struck now this note, now
that with intention, in order to complete his meaning.</p>

<p>We have to cast about in order to discover where the emphasis in
these strange stories rightly comes. Tchekov's own words give us a
lead in the right direction. "...such a conversation as this
between us", he says, "would have been unthinkable for our parents.
At night they did not talk, but slept sound; we, our generation,
sleep badly, are restless, but talk a great deal, and are always
trying to settle whether we are right or not." Our literature of
social satire and psychological finesse both sprang from that
restless sleep, that incessant talking; but after all, there is an
enormous difference between Tchekov and Henry James, between
Tchekov and Bernard Shaw. Obviously&mdash;but where does it arise?
Tchekov, too, is aware of the evils and injustices of the social
state; the condition of the peasants appals him, but the reformer's
zeal is not his&mdash;that is not the signal for us to stop. The
mind interests him enormously; he is a most subtle and delicate
analyst of human relations. But again, no; the end is not there. Is
it that he is primarily interested not in the soul's relation with
other souls, but with the soul's relation to health&mdash;with the
soul's relation to goodness? These stories are always showing us
some affectation, pose, insincerity. Some woman has got into a
false relation; some man has been perverted by the inhumanity of
his circumstances. The soul is ill; the soul is cured; the soul is
not cured. Those are the emphatic points in his stories.</p>

<p>Once the eye is used to these shades, half the "conclusions" of
fiction fade into thin air; they show like transparences with a
light behind them&mdash;gaudy, glaring, superficial. The general
tidying up of the last chapter, the marriage, the death, the
statement of values so sonorously trumpeted forth, so heavily
underlined, become of the most rudimentary kind. Nothing is solved,
we feel; nothing is rightly held together. On the other hand, the
method which at first seemed so casual, inconclusive, and occupied
with trifles, now appears the result of an exquisitely original and
fastidious taste, choosing boldly, arranging infallibly, and
controlled by an honesty for which we can find no match save among
the Russians themselves. There may be no answer to these questions,
but at the same time let us never manipulate the evidence so as to
produce something fitting, decorous, agreeable to our vanity. This
may not be the way to catch the ear of the public; after all, they
are used to louder music, fiercer measures; but as the tune sounded
so he has written it. In consequence, as we read these little
stories about nothing at all, the horizon widens; the soul gains an
astonishing sense of freedom.</p>

<p>In reading Tchekov we find ourselves repeating the word "soul"
again and again. It sprinkles his pages. Old drunkards use it
freely; "...you are high up in the service, beyond all reach, but
haven't real soul, my dear boy...there's no strength in it".
Indeed, it is the soul that is the chief character in Russian
fiction. Delicate and subtle in Tchekov, subject to an infinite
number of humours and distempers, it is of greater depth and volume
in Dostoevsky; it is liable to violent diseases and raging fevers,
but still the predominant concern. Perhaps that is why it needs so
great an effort on the part of an English reader to read <i>The
Brothers Karamazov</i> or <i>The Possessed</i> a second time. The
"soul" is alien to him. It is even antipathetic. It has little
sense of humour and no sense of comedy. It is formless. It has
slight connection with the intellect. It is confused, diffuse,
tumultuous, incapable, it seems, of submitting to the control of
logic or the discipline of poetry. The novels of Dostoevsky are
seething whirlpools, gyrating sandstorms, waterspouts which hiss
and boil and suck us in. They are composed purely and wholly of the
stuff of the soul. Against our wills we are drawn in, whirled
round, blinded, suffocated, and at the same time filled with a
giddy rapture. Out of Shakespeare there is no more exciting
reading. We open the door and find ourselves in a room full of
Russian generals, the tutors of Russian generals, their
step-daughters and cousins, and crowds of miscellaneous people who
are all talking at the tops of their voices about their most
private affairs. But where are we? Surely it is the part of a
novelist to inform us whether we are in an hotel, a flat, or hired
lodging. Nobody thinks of explaining. We are souls, tortured,
unhappy souls, whose only business it is to talk, to reveal, to
confess, to draw up at whatever rending of flesh and nerve those
crabbed sins which crawl on the sand at the bottom of us. But, as
we listen, our confusion slowly settles. A rope is flung to us; we
catch hold of a soliloquy; holding on by the skin of our teeth, we
are rushed through the water; feverishly, wildly, we rush on and
on, now submerged, now in a moment of vision understanding more
than we have ever understood before, and receiving such revelations
as we are wont to get only from the press of life at its fullest.
As we fly we pick it all up&mdash;the names of the people, their
relationships, that they are staying in an hotel at Roulettenburg,
that Polina is involved in an intrigue with the Marquis de
Grieux&mdash;but what unimportant matters these are compared with
the soul! It is the soul that matters, its passion, its tumult, its
astonishing medley of beauty and vileness. And if our voices
suddenly rise into shrieks of laughter, or if we are shaken by the
most violent sobbing, what more natural?&mdash;it hardly calls for
remark. The pace at which we are living is so tremendous that
sparks must rush off our wheels as we fly. Moreover, when the speed
is thus increased and the elements of the soul are seen, not
separately in scenes of humour or scenes of passion as our slower
English minds conceive them, but streaked, involved, inextricably
confused, a new panorama of the human mind is revealed. The old
divisions melt into each other. Men are at the same time villains
and saints; their acts are at once beautiful and despicable. We
love and we hate at the same time. There is none of that precise
division between good and bad to which we are used. Often those for
whom we feel most affection are the greatest criminals, and the
most abject sinners move us to the strongest admiration as well as
love.</p>

<p>Dashed to the crest of the waves, bumped and battered on the
stones at the bottom, it is difficult for an English reader to feel
at ease. The process to which he is accustomed in his own
literature is reversed. If we wished to tell the story of a
General's love affair (and we should find it very difficult in the
first place not to laugh at a General), we should begin with his
house; we should solidify his surroundings. Only when all was ready
should we attempt to deal with the General himself. Moreover, it is
not the samovar but the teapot that rules in England; time is
limited; space crowded; the influence of other points of view, of
other books, even of other ages, makes itself felt. Society is
sorted out into lower, middle, and upper classes, each with its own
traditions, its own manners, and, to some extent, its own language.
Whether he wishes it or not, there is a constant pressure upon an
English novelist to recognise these barriers, and, in consequence,
order is imposed on him and some kind of form; he is inclined to
satire rather than to compassion, to scrutiny of society rather
than understanding of individuals themselves.</p>

<p>No such restraints were laid on Dostoevsky. It is all the same
to him whether you are noble or simple, a tramp or a great lady.
Whoever you are, you are the vessel of this perplexed liquid, this
cloudy, yeasty, precious stuff, the soul. The soul is not
restrained by barriers. It overflows, it floods, it mingles with
the souls of others. The simple story of a bank clerk who could not
pay for a bottle of wine spreads, before we know what is happening,
into the lives of his father-in-law and the five mistresses whom
his father-in-law treated abominably, and the postman's life, and
the charwoman's, and the Princesses' who lodged in the same block
of flats; for nothing is outside Dostoevsky's province; and when he
is tired, he does not stop, he goes on. He cannot restrain himself.
Out it tumbles upon us, hot, scalding, mixed, marvellous, terrible,
oppressive&mdash;the human soul.</p>

<p>There remains the greatest of all novelists&mdash;for what else
can we call the author of <i>War and Peace?</i> Shall we find
Tolstoi, too, alien, difficult, a foreigner? Is there some oddity
in his angle of vision which, at any rate until we have become
disciples and so lost our bearings, keeps us at arm's length in
suspicion and bewilderment? From his first words we can be sure of
one thing at any rate&mdash;here is a man who sees what we see, who
proceeds, too, as we are accustomed to proceed, not from the inside
outwards, but from the outside inwards. Here is a world in which
the postman's knock is heard at eight o'clock, and people go to bed
between ten and eleven. Here is a man, too, who is no savage, no
child of nature; he is educated; he has had every sort of
experience. He is one of those born aristocrats who have used their
privileges to the full. He is metropolitan, not suburban. His
senses, his intellect, are acute, powerful, and well nourished.
There is something proud and superb in the attack of such a mind
and such a body upon life. Nothing seems to escape him. Nothing
glances off him unrecorded. Nobody, therefore, can so convey the
excitement of sport, the beauty of horses, and all the fierce
desirability of the world to the senses of a strong young man.
Every twig, every feather sticks to his magnet. He notices the blue
or red of a child's frock; the way a horse shifts its tail; the
sound of a cough; the action of a man trying to put his hands into
pockets that have been sewn up. And what his infallible eye reports
of a cough or a trick of the hands his infallible brain refers to
something hidden in the character, so that we know his people, not
only by the way they love and their views on politics and the
immortality of the soul, but also by the way they sneeze and choke.
Even in a translation we feel that we have been set on a
mountain-top and had a telescope put into our hands. Everything is
astonishingly clear and absolutely sharp. Then, suddenly, just as
we are exulting, breathing deep, feeling at once braced and
purified, some detail&mdash;perhaps the head of a man&mdash;comes
at us out of the picture in an alarming way, as if extruded by the
very intensity of its life. "Suddenly a strange thing happened to
me: first I ceased to see what was around me; then his face seemed
to vanish till only the eyes were left, shining over against mine;
next the eyes seemed to be in my own head, and then all became
confused&mdash;I could see nothing and was forced to shut my eyes,
in order to break loose from the feeling of pleasure and fear which
his gaze was producing in me..." Again and again we share Masha's
feelings in <i>Family Happiness</i>. One shuts one's eyes to escape
the feeling of pleasure and fear. Often it is pleasure that is
uppermost. In this very story there are two descriptions, one of a
girl walking in a garden at night with her lover, one of a newly
married couple prancing down their drawing-room, which so convey
the feeling of intense happiness that we shut the book to feel it
better. But always there is an element of fear which makes us, like
Masha, wish to escape from the gaze which Tolstoi fixes on us. Is
it the sense, which in real life might harass us, that such
happiness as he describes is too intense to last, that we are on
the edge of disaster? Or is it not that the very intensity of our
pleasure is somehow questionable and forces us to ask, with
Pozdnyshev in the <i>Kreutzer Sonata</i>, "But why live?" Life
dominates Tolstoi as the soul dominates Dostoevsky. There is always
at the centre of all the brilliant and flashing petals of the
flower this scorpion, "Why live?" There is always at the centre of
the book some Olenin, or Pierre, or Levin who gathers into himself
all experience, turns the world round between his fingers, and
never ceases to ask, even as he enjoys it, what is the meaning of
it, and what should be our aims. It is not the priest who shatters
our desires most effectively; it is the man who has known them, and
loved them himself. When he derides them, the world indeed turns to
dust and ashes beneath our feet. Thus fear mingles with our
pleasure, and of the three great Russian writers, it is Tolstoi who
most enthralls us and most repels.</p>

<p>But the mind takes its bias from the place of its birth, and no
doubt, when it strikes upon a literature so alien as the Russian,
flies off at a tangent far from the truth.</p>

<h1>MISS MITFORD</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking truthfully, <i>Mary Russell Mitford and her
Surroundings</i> is not a good book. It neither enlarges the mind
nor purifies the heart. There is nothing in it about Prime
Ministers and not very much about Miss Mitford. Yet, as one is
setting out to speak the truth, one must own that there are certain
books which can be read without the mind and without the heart, but
still with considerable enjoyment. To come to the point, the great
merit of these scrapbooks, for they can scarcely be called
biographies, is that they license mendacity. One cannot believe
what Miss Hill says about Miss Mitford, and thus one is free to
invent Miss Mitford for oneself. Not for a second do we accuse Miss
Hill of telling lies. That infirmity is entirely ours. For example:
"Alresford was the birthplace of one who loved nature as few have
loved her, and whose writings 'breathe the air of the hayfields and
the scent of the hawthorn boughs', and seem to waft to us 'the
sweet breezes that blow over ripened cornfields and daisied
meadows'." It is perfectly true that Miss Mitford was born at
Alresford, and yet, when it is put like that, we doubt whether she
was ever born at all. Indeed she was, says Miss Hill; she was born
"on the 16th December, 1787. 'A pleasant house in truth it was,'
Miss Mitford writes. 'The breakfast-room...was a lofty and spacious
apartment.'" So Miss Mitford was born in the breakfast-room about
eight-thirty on a snowy morning between the Doctor's second and
third cups of tea. "Pardon me," said Mrs. Mitford, turning a little
pale, but not omitting to add the right quantity of cream to her
husband's tea, "I feel ..." That is the way in which Mendacity
begins. There is something plausible and even ingenious in her
approaches. The touch about the cream, for instance, might be
called historical, for it is well known that when Mary won
&pound;20,000 in the Irish lottery, the Doctor spent it all upon
Wedgwood china, the winning number being stamped upon the soup
plates in the middle of an Irish harp, the whole being surmounted
by the Mitford arms, and encircled by the motto of Sir John
Bertram, one of William the Conqueror's knights, from whom the
Mitfords claimed descent. "Observe", says Mendacity, "with what an
air the Doctor drinks his tea, and how she, poor lady, contrives to
curtsey as she leaves the room." Tea? I inquire, for the Doctor,
though a fine figure of a man, is already purple and profuse, and
foams like a crimson cock over the frill of his fine laced shirt.
"Since the ladies have left the room", Mendacity begins, and goes
on to make up a pack of lies with the sole object of proving that
Dr. Mitford kept a mistress in the purlieus of Reading and paid her
money on the pretence that he was investing it in a new method of
lighting and heating houses invented by the Marquis de Chavannes.
It came to the same thing in the end&mdash;to the King's Bench
Prison, that is to say; but instead of allowing us to recall the
literary and historical associations of the place, Mendacity
wanders off to the window and distracts us again by the
platitudinous remark that it is still snowing. There is something
very charming in an ancient snowstorm. The weather has varied
almost as much in the course of generations as mankind. The snow of
those days was more formally shaped and a good deal softer than the
snow of ours, just as an eighteenth-century cow was no more like
our cows than she was like the florid and fiery cows of Elizabethan
pastures. Sufficient attention has scarcely been paid to this
aspect of literature, which, it cannot be denied, has its
importance.</p>

<p>Our brilliant young men might do worse, when in search of a
subject, than devote a year or two to cows in literature, snow in
literature, the daisy in Chaucer and in Coventry Patmore. At any
rate, the snow falls heavily. The Portsmouth mail-coach has already
lost its way; several ships have foundered, and Margate pier has
been totally destroyed. At Hatfield Peveral twenty sheep have been
buried, and though one supports itself by gnawing wurzels which it
has found near it, there is grave reason to fear that the French
king's coach has been blocked on the road to Colchester. It is now
the 16th of February 1808.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Mitford! Twenty-one years ago she left the
breakfast-room, and no news has yet been received of her child.
Even Mendacity is a little ashamed of itself, and, picking up
<i>Mary Russell Mitford and her Surroundings,</i> assures us that
everything will come right if we possess ourselves in patience. The
French king's coach was on its way to Bocking; at Becking lived
Lord and Lady Charles Murray-Aynsley; and Lord Charles was shy.
Lord Charles had always been shy. Once when Mary Mitford was five
years old&mdash;sixteen years, that is, before the sheep were lost
and the French king went to Bocking&mdash;Mary "threw him into an
agony of blushing by running up to his chair in mistake for that of
my papa". He had indeed to leave the room. Miss Hill, who, somewhat
strangely, finds the society of Lord and Lady Charles pleasant,
does not wish to quit it without "introducing an incident in
connection with them which took place in the month of February,
1808". But is Miss Mitford concerned in it? we ask, for there must
be an end of trifling. To some extent, that is to say, Lady Charles
was a cousin of the Mitfords, and Lord Charles was shy. Mendacity
is quite ready to deal with "the incident" even on these terms;
but, we repeat, we have had enough of trifling. Miss Mitford may
not be a great woman; for all we know she was not even a good one;
but we have certain responsibilities as a reviewer which we are not
going to evade.</p>

<p>There is, to begin with, English literature. A sense of the
beauty of nature has never been altogether absent, however much the
cow may change from age to age, from English poetry. Nevertheless,
the difference between Pope and Wordsworth in this respect is very
considerable. <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> was published in 1798; <i>Our
Village</i> in 1824. One being in verse and the other in prose, it
is not necessary to labour a comparison which contains, however,
not only the elements of justice, but the seeds of many volumes.
Like her great predecessor, Miss Mitford much preferred the country
to the town; and thus, perhaps, it may not be inopportune to dwell
for a moment upon the King of Saxony, Mary Anning, and the
ichthyosaurus. Let alone the fact that Mary Anning and Mary Mitford
had a Christian name in common, they are further connected by what
can scarcely be called a fact, but may, without hazard, be called a
probability. Miss Mitford was looking for fossils at Lyme Regis
only fifteen years before Mary Anning found one. The King of Saxony
visited Lyme in 1844, and seeing the head of an ichthyosaurus in
Mary Anning's window, asked her to drive to Pinny and explore the
rocks. While they were looking for fossils, an old woman seated
herself in the King's coach&mdash;was she Mary Mitford? Truth
compels us to say that she was not; but there is no doubt, and we
are not trifling when we say it, that Mary Mitford often expressed
a wish that she had known Mary Anning, and it is singularly
unfortunate to have to state that she never did. For we have
reached the year 1844; Mary Mitford is fifty-seven years of age,
and so far, thanks to Mendacity and its trifling ways, all we know
of her is that she did not know Mary Anning, had not found an
ichthyosaurus, had not been out in a snowstorm, and had not seen
the King of France.</p>

<p>It is time to wring the creature's neck, and begin again at the
very beginning.</p>

<p>What considerations, then, had weight with Miss Hill when she
decided to write <i>Mary Russell Mitford and her Surroundings?</i>
Three emerge from the rest, and may be held of paramount
importance. In the first place, Miss Mitford was a lady; in the
second, she was born in the year 1787; and in the third, the stock
of female characters who lend themselves to biographic treatment by
their own sex is, for one reason or another, running short. For
instance, little is known of Sappho, and that little is not wholly
to her credit. Lady Jane Grey has merit, but is undeniably obscure.
Of George Sand, the more we know the less we approve. George Eliot
was led into evil ways which not all her philosophy can excuse. The
Bront&euml;s, however highly we rate their genius, lacked that
indefinable something which marks the lady; Harriet Martineau was
an atheist; Mrs. Browning was a married woman; Jane Austen, Fanny
Burney, and Maria Edgeworth have been done already; so that, what
with one thing and another, Mary Russell Mitford is the only woman
left.</p>

<p>There is no need to labour the extreme importance of the date
when we see the word "surroundings" on the back of a book.
Surroundings, as they are called, are invariably eighteenth-century
surroundings. When we come, as of course we do, to that phrase
which relates how "as we looked upon the steps leading down from
the upper room, we fancied we saw the tiny figure jumping from step
to step", it would be the grossest outrage upon our sensibilities
to be told that those steps were Athenian, Elizabethan, or
Parisian. They were, of course, eighteenth-century steps, leading
down from the old panelled room into the shady garden, where,
tradition has it, William Pitt played marbles, or, if we like to be
bold, where on still summer days we can almost fancy that we hear
the drums of Bonaparte on the coast of France. Bonaparte is the
limit of the imagination on one side, as Monmouth is on the other;
it would be fatal if the imagination took to toying with Prince
Albert or sporting with King John. But fancy knows her place, and
there is no need to labour the point that her place is the
eighteenth century. The other point is more obscure. One must be a
lady. Yet what that means, and whether we like what it means, may
both be doubtful. If we say that Jane Austen was a lady and that
Charlotte Bront&euml; was not one, we do as much as need be done in
the way of definition, and commit ourselves to neither side.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly because of their reticence that Miss Hill is
on the side of the ladies. They sigh things off and they smile
things off, but they never seize the silver table by the legs or
dash the teacups on the floor. It is in many ways a great
convenience to have a subject who can be trusted to live a long
life without once raising her voice. Sixteen years is a
considerable stretch of time, but of a lady it is enough to say,
"Here Mary Mitford passed sixteen years of her life and here she
got to know and love not only their own beautiful grounds but also
every turn of the surrounding shady lanes". Her loves were
vegetable, and her lanes were shady. Then, of course, she was
educated at the school where Jane Austen and Mrs. Sherwood had been
educated. She visited Lyme Regis, and there is mention of the Cobb.
She saw London from the top of St. Paul's, and London was much
smaller then than it is now. She changed from one charming house to
another, and several distinguished literary gentlemen paid her
compliments and came to tea. When the dining-room ceiling fell down
it did not fall on her head, and when she took a ticket in a
lottery she did win the prize. If in the foregoing sentences there
are any words of more than two syllables, it is our fault and not
Miss Hill's; and to do that writer justice, there are not many
whole sentences in the book which are neither quoted from Miss
Mitford nor supported by the authority of Mr. Crissy.</p>

<p>But how dangerous a thing is life! Can one be sure that anything
not wholly made of mahogany will to the very end stand empty in the
sun? Even cupboards have their secret springs, and when,
inadvertently we are sure, Miss Hill touches this one, out,
terrible to relate, topples a stout old gentleman. In plain
English, Miss Mitford had a father. There is nothing actually
improper in that. Many women have had fathers. But Miss Mitford's
father was kept in a cupboard; that is to say, he was not a nice
father. Miss Hill even goes so far as to conjecture that when "an
imposing procession of neighbours and friends" followed him to the
grave, "we cannot help thinking that this was more to show sympathy
and respect for Miss Mitford than from special respect for him".
Severe as the judgement is, the gluttonous, bibulous, amorous old
man did something to deserve it. The less said about him the
better. Only, if from your earliest childhood your father has
gambled and speculated, first with your mother's fortune, then with
your own, spent your earnings, driven you to earn more, and spent
that too; if in old age he has lain upon a sofa and insisted that
fresh air is bad for daughters; if, dying at length, he has left
debts that can only be paid by selling everything you have or
sponging upon the charity of friends&mdash;then even a lady
sometimes raises her voice. Miss Mitford herself spoke out once.
"It was grief to go; there I had toiled and striven and tasted as
deeply of bitter anxiety, of fear, and of hope as often falls to
the lot of woman." What language for a lady to use! for a lady,
too, who owns a teapot. There is a drawing of the teapot at the
bottom of the page. But it is now of no avail; Miss Mitford has
smashed it to smithereens. That is the worst of writing about
ladies; they have fathers as well as teapots. On the other hand,
some pieces of Dr. Mitford's Wedgwood dinner service are still in
existence, and a copy of Adam's Geography, which Mary won as a
prize at school, is "in our temporary possession". If there is
nothing improper in the suggestion, might not the next book be
devoted entirely to them?</p>

<br>

<h1>DR. BENTLEY</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we saunter through those famous courts where Dr. Bentley once
reigned supreme we sometimes catch sight of a figure hurrying on
its way to Chapel or Hall which, as it disappears, draws our
thoughts enthusiastically after it. For that man, we are told, has
the whole of Sophocles at his finger-ends; knows Homer by heart;
reads Pindar as we read the <i>Times</i>; and spends his life, save
for these short excursions to eat and pray, wholly in the company
of the Greeks. It is true that the infirmities of our education
prevent us from appreciating his emendations as they deserve; his
life's work is a sealed book to us; none the less, we treasure up
the last flicker of his black gown, and feel as if a bird of
Paradise had flashed by us, so bright is his spirit's raiment, and
in the murk of a November evening we had been privileged to see it
winging its way to roost in fields of amaranth and beds of moly. Of
all men, great scholars are the most mysterious, the most august.
Since it is unlikely that we shall ever be admitted to their
intimacy, or see much more of them than a black gown crossing a
court at dusk, the best we can do is to read their lives&mdash;for
example, the <i>Life of Dr. Bentley</i> by Bishop Monk.</p>

<p>There we shall find much that is odd and little that is
reassuring. The greatest of our scholars, the man who read Greek as
the most expert of us read English not merely with an accurate
sense of meaning and grammar but with a sensibility so subtle and
widespread that he perceived relations and suggestions of language
which enabled him to fetch up from oblivion lost lines and inspire
new life into the little fragments that remained, the man who
should have been steeped in beauty (if what they say of the
Classics is true) as a honey-pot is ingrained with sweetness was,
on the contrary, the most quarrelsome of mankind.</p>

<p>"I presume that there are not many examples of an individual who
has been a party in six distinct suits before the Court of King's
Bench within the space of three years", his biographer remarks; and
adds that Bentley won them all. It is difficult to deny his
conclusion that though Dr. Bentley might have been a first-rate
lawyer or a great soldier "such a display suited any character
rather than that of a learned and dignified clergyman". Not all
these disputes, however, sprung from his love of literature. The
charges against which he had to defend himself were directed
against him as Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. He was
habitually absent from chapel; his expenditure upon building and
upon his household was excessive; he used the college seal at
meetings which did not consist of the statutable number of sixteen,
and so on. In short, the career of the Master of Trinity was one
continuous series of acts of aggression and defiance, in which Dr.
Bentley treated the Society of Trinity College as a grown man might
treat an importunate rabble of street boys. Did they dare to hint
that the staircase at the Lodge which admitted four persons abreast
was quite wide enough?&mdash;did they refuse to sanction his
expenditure upon a new one? Meeting them in the Great Court one
evening after chapel he proceeded urbanely to question them. They
refused to budge. Whereupon, with a sudden alteration of colour and
voice, Bentley demanded whether "they had forgotten his rusty
sword?" Mr. Michael Hutchinson and some others, upon whose backs
the weight of that weapon would have first descended, brought
pressure upon their seniors. The bill for &pound;350 was paid and
their preferment secured. But Bentley did not wait for this act of
submission to finish his staircase.</p>

<p>So it went on, year after year. Nor was the arrogance of his
behaviour always justified by the splendour or utility of the
objects he had in view&mdash;the creation of the Backs, the
erection of an observatory, the foundation of a laboratory. More
trivial desires were gratified with the same tyranny. Sometimes he
wanted coal; sometimes bread and ale; and then Madame Bentley,
sending her servant with a snuffbox in token of authority, got from
the butteries at the expense of the college a great deal more of
these commodities than the college thought that Dr. Bentley ought
to require. Again, when he had four pupils to lodge with him who
paid him handsomely for their board, it was drawn from the College,
at the command of the snuff-box, for nothing. The principles of
"delicacy and good feeling" which the Master might have been
expected to observe (great scholar as he was, steeped in the wine
of the classics) went for nothing. His argument that the "few
College loaves" upon which the four young patricians were nourished
were amply repaid by the three sash windows which he had put into
their rooms at his own expense failed to convince the Fellows. And
when, on Trinity Sunday 1719, the Fellows found the famous College
ale not to their liking, they were scarcely satisfied when the
butler told them that it had been brewed by the Master's orders,
from the Master's malt, which was stored in the Master's granary,
and though damaged by "an insect called the weevil" had been paid
for at the very high rates which the Master demanded.</p>

<p>Still these battles over bread and beer are trifles and domestic
trifles at that. His conduct in his profession will throw more
light upon our inquiry. For, released from brick and building,
bread and beer, patricians and their windows, it may be found that
he expanded in the atmosphere of Homer, Horace, and Manilius, and
proved in his study the benign nature of those influences which
have been wafted down to us through the ages. But there the
evidence is even less to the credit of the dead languages. He
acquitted himself magnificently, all agree, in the great
controversy about the letters of Phalaris. His temper was excellent
and his learning prodigious. But that triumph was succeeded by a
series of disputes which force upon us the extraordinary spectacle
of men of learning and genius, of authority and divinity, brawling
about Greek and Latin texts, and calling each other names for all
the world like bookies on a racecourse or washerwomen in a back
street. For this vehemence of temper and virulence of language were
not confined to Bentley alone; they appear unhappily characteristic
of the profession as a whole. Early in life, in the year 1691, a
quarrel was fastened upon him by his brother chaplain Hody for
writing Malelas, not as Hody preferred, Malela. A controversy in
which Bentley displayed learning and wit, and Hody accumulated
endless pages of bitter argument against the letter <i>s</i>
ensued. Hody was worsted, and "there is too much reason to believe,
that the offence given by this trivial cause was never afterwards
healed". Indeed, to mend a line was to break a friendship. James
Gronovius of Leyden&mdash;"homunculus eruditione mediocri, ingenio
nullo", as Bentley called him&mdash;attacked Bentley for ten years
because Bentley had succeeded in correcting a fragment of
Callimachus where he had failed.</p>

<p>But Gronovius was by no means the only scholar who resented the
success of a rival with a rancour that grey hairs and forty years
spent in editing the classics failed to subdue. In all the chief
towns of Europe lived men like the notorious de Pauw of Utrecht, "a
person who has justly been considered the pest and disgrace of
letters", who, when a new theory or new edition appeared, banded
themselves together to deride and humiliate the scholar. "...all
his writings", Bishop Monk remarks of de Pauw, "prove him to be
devoid of candour, good faith, good manners, and every gentlemanly
feeling: and while he unites all the defects and bad qualities that
were ever found in a critic or commentator, he adds one peculiar to
himself, an incessant propensity to indecent allusions." With such
tempers and such habits it is not strange that the scholars of
those days sometimes ended lives made intolerable by bitterness,
poverty, and neglect by their own hands, like Johnson, who after a
lifetime spent in the detection of minute errors of construction,
went mad and drowned himself in the meadows near Nottingham. On May
20, 1712, Trinity College was shocked to find that the professor of
Hebrew, Dr. Sike, had hanged himself "some time this evening,
before candlelight, in his sash". When Kuster died, it was reported
that he, too, had killed himself. And so, in a sense, he had. For
when his body was opened "there was found a cake of sand along the
lower region of his belly. This, I take it, was occasioned by his
sitting nearly double, and writing on a very low table, surrounded
with three or four circles of books placed on the ground, which was
the situation we usually found him in." The minds of poor
schoolmasters, like John Ker of the dissenting Academy, who had had
the high gratification of dining with Dr. Bentley at the Lodge,
when the talk fell upon the use of the word <i>equidem,</i> were so
distorted by a lifetime of neglect and study that they went home,
collected all uses of the word <i>equidem</i> which contradicted
the Doctor's opinion, returned to the Lodge, anticipating in their
simplicity a warm welcome, met the Doctor issuing to dine with the
Archbishop of Canterbury, followed him down the street in spite of
his indifference and annoyance and, being refused even a word of
farewell, went home to brood over their injuries and wait the day
of revenge.</p>

<p>But the bickerings and animosities of the smaller fry were
magnified, not obliterated, by the Doctor himself in the conduct of
his own affairs. The courtesy and good temper which he had shown in
his early controversies had worn away. "...a course of violent
animosities and the indulgence of unrestrained indignation for many
years had impaired both his taste and judgement in controversy",
and he condescended, though the subject in dispute was the Greek
Testament, to call his antagonist "maggot", "vermin", "gnawing
rat", and "cabbage head", to refer to the darkness of his
complexion, and to insinuate that his wits were crazed, which
charge he supported by dwelling on the fact that his brother, a
clergyman, wore a beard to his girdle.</p>

<p>Violent, pugnacious, and unscrupulous, Dr. Bentley survived
these storms and agitations, and remained, though suspended from
his degrees and deprived of his mastership, seated at the Lodge
imperturbably. Wearing a broad-brimmed hat indoors to protect his
eyes, smoking his pipe, enjoying his port, and expounding to his
friends his doctrine of the digamma, Bentley lived those eighty
years which, he said, were long enough "to read everything which
was worth reading", "Et tunc", he added, in his peculiar
manner,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Et tunc magna mei sub terris ibit imago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A small square stone marked his grave in Trinity College, but
the Fellows refused to record upon it the fact that he had been
their Master.</p>

<p>But the strangest sentence in this strange story has yet to be
written, and Bishop Monk writes it as if it were a commonplace
requiring no comment. "For a person who was neither a poet, nor
possessed of poetical taste to venture upon such a task was no
common presumption." The task was to detect every slip of language
in <i>Paradise Lost,</i> and all instances of bad taste and
incorrect imagery. The result was notoriously lamentable. Yet in
what, we may ask, did it differ from those in which Bentley was
held to have acquitted himself magnificently? And if Bentley was
incapable of appreciating the poetry of Milton, how can we accept
his verdict upon Horace and Homer? And if we cannot trust
implicitly to scholars, and if the study of Greek is supposed to
refine the manners and purify the soul&mdash;but enough. Our
scholar has returned from Hall; his lamp is lit; his studies are
resumed; and it is time that our profane speculations should have
an end. Besides, all this happened many, many years ago.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><a name="C16c" id="C16c">III</a>
</h1>

<h1>LADY DOROTHY NEVILL</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She had stayed, in a humble capacity, for a week in the ducal
household. She had seen the troops of highly decorated human beings
descending in couples to eat, and ascending in couples to bed. She
had, surreptitiously, from a gallery, observed the Duke himself
dusting the miniatures in the glass cases, while the Duchess let
her crochet fall from her hands as if in utter disbelief that the
world had need of crochet. From an upper window she had seen, as
far as eye could reach, gravel paths swerving round isles of
greenery and losing themselves in little woods designed to shed the
shade without the severity of forests; she had watched the ducal
carriage bowling in and out of the prospect, and returning a
different way from the way it went. And what was her verdict? "A
lunatic asylum."</p>

<p>It is true that she was a lady's-maid, and that Lady Dorothy
Nevill, had she encountered her on the stairs, would have made an
opportunity to point out that that is a very different thing from
being a lady.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My mother never failed to point out the folly of workwomen,
shop-girls, and the like calling each other "Ladies". All this sort
of thing seemed to her to be mere vulgar humbug, and she did not
fail to say so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What can we point out to Lady Dorothy Nevill? that with all her
advantages she had never learned to spell? that she could not write
a grammatical sentence? that she lived for eighty-seven years and
did nothing but put food into her mouth and slip gold through her
fingers? But delightful though it is to indulge in righteous
indignation, it is misplaced if we agree with the lady's-maid that
high birth is a form of congenital insanity, that the sufferer
merely inherits the diseases of his ancestors, and endures them,
for the most part very stoically, in one of those comfortably
padded lunatic asylums which are known, euphemistically, as the
stately homes of England.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Walpoles are not ducal. Horace Walpole's mother
was a Miss Shorter; there is no mention of Lady Dorothy's mother in
the present volume, but her great-grandmother was Mrs. Oldfield the
actress, and, to her credit, Lady Dorothy was "exceedingly proud"
of the fact. Thus she was not an extreme case of aristocracy; she
was confined rather to a bird-cage than to an asylum; through the
bars she saw people walking at large, and once or twice she made a
surprising little flight into the open air. A gayer, brighter, more
vivacious specimen of the caged tribe can seldom have existed; so
that one is forced at times to ask whether what we call living in a
cage is not the fate that wise people, condemned to a single
sojourn upon earth, would choose. To be at large is, after all, to
be shut out; to waste most of life in accumulating the money to buy
and the time to enjoy what the Lady Dorothys find clustering and
glowing about their cradles when their eyes first open&mdash;as
hers opened in the year 1826 at number eleven Berkeley Square.
Horace Walpole had lived there. Her father, Lord Orford, gambled it
away in one night's play the year after she was born. But Wolterton
Hall, in Norfolk, was full of carving and mantelpieces, and there
were rare trees in the garden, and a large and famous lawn. No
novelist could wish a more charming and even romantic environment
in which to set the story of two little girls, growing up, wild yet
secluded, reading Bossuet with their governess, and riding out on
their ponies at the head of the tenantry on polling day. Nor can
one deny that to have had the author of the following letter among
one's ancestors would have been a source of inordinate pride. It is
addressed to the Norwich Bible Society, which had invited Lord
Orford to become its president:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have long been addicted to the Gaming Table. I have lately
taken to the Turf. I fear I frequently blaspheme. But I have never
distributed religious tracts. All this was known to you and your
Society. Notwithstanding which you think me a fit person to be your
president. God forgive your hypocrisy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was not Lord Orford who was in the cage on that occasion.
But, alas! Lord Orford owned another country house, Ilsington Hall,
in Dorsetshire, and there Lady Dorothy came in contact first with
the mulberry tree, and later with Mr. Thomas Hardy; and we get our
first glimpse of the bars. We do not pretend to the ghost of an
enthusiasm for Sailors' Homes in general; no doubt mulberry trees
are much nicer to look at; but when it comes to calling people
"vandals" who cut them down to build houses, and to having
footstools made from the wood, and to carving upon those footstools
inscriptions which testify that "often and often has King George
III taken his tea" under this very footstool, then we want to
protest&mdash;"Surely you must mean Shakespeare?" But as her
subsequent remarks upon Mr. Hardy tend to prove, Lady Dorothy does
not mean Shakespeare. She "warmly appreciated" the works of Mr.
Hardy, and used to complain "that the county families were too
stupid to appreciate his genius at its proper worth". George the
Third drinking his tea; the county families failing to appreciate
Mr. Hardy: Lady Dorothy is undoubtedly behind the bars.</p>

<p>Yet no story more aptly illustrates the barrier which we
perceive hereafter between Lady Dorothy and the outer world than
the story of Charles Darwin and the blankets. Among her recreations
Lady Dorothy made a hobby of growing orchids, and thus got into
touch with "the great naturalist". Mrs. Darwin, inviting her to
stay with them, remarked with apparent simplicity that she had
heard that people who moved much in London society were fond of
being tossed in blankets. "I am afraid", her letter ended, "we
should hardly be able to offer you anything of that sort." Whether
in fact the necessity of tossing Lady Dorothy in a blanket had been
seriously debated at Down, or whether Mrs. Darwin obscurely hinted
her sense of some incongruity between her husband and the lady of
the orchids, we do not know. But we have a sense of two worlds in
collision; and it is not the Darwin world that emerges in
fragments. More and more do we see Lady Dorothy hopping from perch
to perch, picking at groundsel here, and at hempseed there,
indulging in exquisite trills and roulades, and sharpening her beak
against a lump of sugar in a large, airy, magnificently equipped
bird-cage. The cage was full of charming diversions. Now she
illuminated leaves which had been macerated to skeletons; now she
interested herself in improving the breed of donkeys; next she took
up the cause of silkworms, almost threatened Australia with a
plague of them, and "actually succeeded in obtaining enough silk to
make a dress"; again she was the first to discover that wood, gone
green with decay, can be made, at some expense, into little boxes;
she went into the question of funguses and established the virtues
of the neglected English truffle; she imported rare fish; spent a
great deal of energy in vainly trying to induce storks and Cornish
choughs to breed in Sussex; painted on china; emblazoned heraldic
arms, and, attaching whistles to the tails of pigeons, produced
wonderful effects "as of an aerial orchestra" when they flew
through the air. To the Duchess of Somerset belongs the credit of
investigating the proper way of cooking guinea-pigs; but Lady
Dorothy was one of the first to serve up a dish of these little
creatures at luncheon in Charles Street.</p>

<p>But all the time the door of the cage was ajar. Raids were made
into what Mr. Nevill calls "Upper Bohemia"; from which Lady Dorothy
returned with "authors, journalists, actors, actresses, or other
agreeable and amusing people". Lady Dorothy's judgement is proved
by the fact that they seldom misbehaved, and some indeed became
quite domesticated, and wrote her "very gracefully turned letters".
But once or twice she made a flight beyond the cage herself. "These
horrors", she said, alluding to the middle class, "are so clever
and we are so stupid; but then look how well they are educated,
while our children learn nothing but how to spend their parents'
money!" She brooded over the fact. Something was going wrong. She
was too shrewd and too honest not to lay the blame partly at least
upon her own class. "I suppose she can just about read?" she said
of one lady calling herself cultured; and of another, "She is
indeed curious and well adapted to open bazaars". But to our
thinking her most remarkable flight took place a year or two before
her death, in the Victoria and Albert Museum:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do so agree with you, she wrote&mdash;though I ought not to
say so&mdash;that the upper class are very&mdash;I don't know what
to say&mdash;but they seem to take no interest in
anything&mdash;but golfing, etc. One day I was at the Victoria and
Albert Museum, just a few sprinkles of legs, for I am sure they
looked too frivolous to have bodies and souls attached to
them&mdash;but what softened the sight to my eyes were 2 little
Japs poring over each article with a handbook...our bodies, of
course, giggling and looking at nothing. Still worse, not one soul
of the higher class visible: in fact I never heard of any one of
them knowing of the place, and for this we are spending
millions&mdash;it is all too painful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was all too painful, and the guillotine, she felt, loomed
ahead. That catastrophe she was spared, for who could wish to cut
off the head of a pigeon with a whistle attached to its tail? But
if the whole bird-cage had been overturned and the aerial orchestra
sent screaming and fluttering through the air, we can be sure, as
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain told her, that her conduct would have been
"a credit to the British aristocracy".</p>

<h1><a name="C16d" id="C16d">IV</a>

<h1>ARCHBISHOP THOMSON</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The origin of Archbishop Thomson was obscure. His great-uncle
"may reasonably be supposed" to have been "an ornament to the
middle classes". His aunt married a gentleman who was present at
the murder of Gustavus III of Sweden; and his father met his death
at the age of eighty-seven by treading on a cat in the early hours
of the morning. The physical vigour which this anecdote implies was
combined in the Archbishop with powers of intellect which promised
success in whatever profession he adopted. At Oxford it seemed
likely that he would devote himself to philosophy or science. While
reading for his degree he found time to write the <i>Outlines of
the Laws of Thought,</i> which "immediately became a recognised
text-book for Oxford classes". But though poetry, philosophy,
medicine, and the law held out their temptations he put such
thoughts aside, or never entertained them, having made up his mind
from the first to dedicate himself to Divine service. The measure
of his success in the more exalted sphere is attested by the
following facts: Ordained deacon in 1842 at the age of
twenty-three, he became Dean and Bursar of Queen's College, Oxford,
in 1845; Provost in 1855, Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol in 1861,
and Archbishop of York in 1862. Thus at the early age of
forty-three he stood next in rank to the Archbishop of Canterbury
himself; and it was commonly though erroneously expected that he
would in the end attain to that dignity also.</p>

<p>It is a matter of temperament and belief whether you read this
list with respect or with boredom; whether you look upon an
archbishop's hat as a crown or as an extinguisher. If, like the
present reviewer, you are ready to hold the simple faith that the
outer order corresponds to the inner&mdash;that a vicar is a good
man, a canon a better man, and an archbishop the best man of
all&mdash;you will find the study of the Archbishop's life one of
extreme fascination. He has turned aside from poetry and philosophy
and law, and specialised in virtue. He has dedicated himself to the
service of the Divine. His spiritual proficiency has been such that
he has developed from deacon to dean, from dean to bishop, and from
bishop to archbishop in the short space of twenty years. As there
are only two archbishops in the whole of England the inference
seems to be that he is the second best man in England; his hat is
the proof of it. Even in a material sense his hat was one of the
largest; it was larger than Mr. Gladstone's; larger than
Thackeray's; larger than Dickens's; it was in fact, so his hatter
told him and we are inclined to agree, an "eight full." Yet he
began much as other men begin. He struck an undergraduate in a fit
of temper and was rusticated; he wrote a text-book of logic and
rowed a very good oar. But after he was ordained his diary shows
that the specialising process had begun. He thought a great deal
about the state of his soul; about "the monstrous tumour of
Simony"; about Church reform; and about the meaning of
Christianity. "Self-renunciation", he came to the conclusion, "is
the foundation of Christian Religion and Christian Morals....The
highest wisdom is that which can enforce and cultivate this
self-renunciation. Hence (against Cousin) I hold that religion is
higher far than philosophy." There is one mention of chemists and
capillarity, but science and philosophy were, even at this early
stage, in danger of being crowded out. Soon the diary takes a
different tone. "He seems", says his biographer, "to have had no
time for committing his thoughts to paper"; he records his
engagements only, and he dines out almost every night. Sir Henry
Taylor, whom he met at one of these parties, described him as
"simple, solid, good, capable, and pleasing". Perhaps it was his
solidity combined with his "eminently scientific" turn of mind, his
blandness as well as his bulk, that impressed some of these great
people with the confidence that in him the Church had found a very
necessary champion. His "brawny logic" and massive frame seemed to
fit him to grapple with a task that taxed the strongest&mdash;how,
that is, to reconcile the scientific discoveries of the age with
religion, and even prove them "some of its strongest witnesses for
the truth". If any one could do this Thomson could; his practical
ability, unhampered by any mystical or dreaming tendency, had
already proved itself in the conduct of the business affairs of his
College. From Bishop he became almost instantly Archbishop; and in
becoming Archbishop he became Primate of England, Governor of the
Charterhouse and King's College, London, patron of one hundred and
twenty livings, with the Archdeaconries of York, Cleveland, and the
East Riding in his gift, and the Canonries and Prebends in York
Minster. Bishopthorpe itself was an enormous palace; he was
immediately faced by the "knotty question" of whether to buy all
the furniture&mdash;"much of it only poor stuff"&mdash;or to
furnish the house anew, which would cost a fortune. Moreover there
were seven cows in the park; but these, perhaps, were
counterbalanced by nine children in the nursery. Then the Prince
and Princess of Wales came to stay, and the Archbishop took upon
himself the task of furnishing the Princess's apartments. He went
up to London and bought eight Moderator lamps, two Spanish figures
holding candles, and reminded himself of the necessity of buying
"soap for Princess". But meanwhile far more serious matters claimed
every ounce of his strength. Already he had been exhorted to "wield
the sure lance of your brawny logic against the sophistries" of the
authors of <i>Essays and Reviews,</i> and had responded in a work
called <i>Aids to Faith.</i> Near at hand the town of Sheffield,
with its large population of imperfectly educated working men, was
a breeding ground of scepticism and discontent. The Archbishop made
it his special charge. He was fond of watching the rolling of
armour plate, and constantly addressed meetings of working men.
"Now what are these Nihilisms, and Socialisms, and Communisms, and
Fenianisms, and Secret Societies&mdash;what do they all mean?" he
asked. "Selfishness," he replied, and "assertion of one class
against the rest is at the bottom of them all". There was a law of
nature, he said, by which wages went up and wages went down. "You
must accept the declivity as well as the ascent....If we could only
get people to learn that, then things would go on a great deal
better and smoother." And the working men of Sheffield responded by
giving him five hundred pieces of cutlery mounted in sterling
silver. But presumably there were a certain number of knives among
the spoons and the forks.</p>

<p>Bishop Colenso, however, was far more troublesome than the
working men of Sheffield; and the Ritualists vexed him so
persistently that even his vast strength felt the strain. The
questions which were referred to him for decision were peculiarly
fitted to tease and annoy even a man of his bulk and his blandness.
Shall a drunkard found dead in a ditch, or a burglar who has fallen
through a skylight, be given the benefit of the Burial Service? he
was asked. The question of lighted candles was "most difficult";
the wearing of coloured stoles and the administration of the mixed
chalice taxed him considerably; and finally there was the Rev. John
Purchas, who, dressed in cope, alb, biretta and stole "cross-wise",
lit candles and extinguished them "for no special reason"; filled a
vessel with black powder and rubbed it into the foreheads of his
congregation; and hung over the Holy Table "a figure, image, or
stuffed skin of a dove, in a flying attitude". The Archbishop's
temper, usually so positive and imperturbable, was gravely ruffled,
"Will there ever come a time when it will be thought a crime to
have striven to keep the Church of England as representing the
common sense of the Nation?" he asked. "I suppose it may, but I
shall not see it. I have gone through a good deal, but I do not
repent of having done my best." If, for a moment, the Archbishop
himself could ask such a question, we must confess to a state of
complete bewilderment. What has become of our superlatively good
man? He is harassed and cumbered; spends his time settling
questions about stuffed pigeons and coloured petticoats; writes
over eighty letters before breakfast sometimes; scarcely has time
to run over to Paris and buy his daughter a bonnet; and in the end
has to ask himself whether one of these days his conduct will not
be considered a crime.</p>

<p>Was it a crime? And if so, was it his fault? Did he not start
out in the belief that Christianity had something to do with
renunciation and was not entirely a matter of common sense? If
honours and obligations, pomps and possessions, accumulated and
encrusted him, how, being an Archbishop, could he refuse to accept
them? Princesses must have their soap; palaces must have their
furniture; children must have their cows. And, pathetic though it
seems, he never completely lost his interest in science. He wore a
pedometer; he was one of the first to use a camera; he believed in
the future of the typewriter; and in his last years he tried to
mend a broken clock. He was a delightful father too; he wrote
witty, terse, sensible letters; his good stories were much to the
point; and he died in harness. Certainly he was a very able man,
but if we insist upon goodness&mdash;is it easy, is it possible,
for a good man to be an Archbishop?</p>

<h1><a name="C17" id="C17">THE PATRON AND THE CROCUS</a>
</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Young men and women beginning to write are generally given the
plausible but utterly impracticable advice to write what they have
to write as shortly as possible, as clearly as possible, and
without other thought in their minds except to say exactly what is
in them. Nobody ever adds on these occasions the one thing needful:
"And be sure you choose your patron wisely", though that is the
gist of the whole matter. For a book is always written for somebody
to read, and, since the patron is not merely the paymaster, but
also in a very subtle and insidious way the instigator and inspirer
of what is written, it is of the utmost importance that he should
be a desirable man.</p>

<p>But who, then, is the desirable man&mdash;the patron who will
cajole the best out of the writer's brain and bring to birth the
most varied and vigorous progeny of which he is capable? Different
ages have answered the question differently. The Elizabethans, to
speak roughly, chose the aristocracy to write for and the playhouse
public. The eighteenth-century patron was a combination of
coffee-house wit and Grub Street bookseller. In the nineteenth
century the great writers wrote for the half-crown magazines and
the leisured classes. And looking back and applauding the splendid
results of these different alliances, it all seems enviably simple,
and plain as a pikestaff compared with our own
predicament&mdash;for whom should we write? For the present supply
of patrons is of unexampled and bewildering variety. There is the
daily Press, the weekly Press, the monthly Press; the English
public and the American public; the bestseller public and the
worst-seller public; the highbrow public and the red-blood public;
all now organised self-conscious entities capable through their
various mouthpieces of making their needs known and their approval
or displeasure felt. Thus the writer who has been moved by the
sight of the first crocus in Kensington Gardens has, before he sets
pen to paper, to choose from a crowd of competitors the particular
patron who suits him best. It is futile to say, "Dismiss them all;
think only of your crocus", because writing is a method of
communication; and the crocus is an imperfect crocus until it has
been shared. The first man or the last may write for himself alone,
but he is an exception and an unenviable one at that, and the gulls
are welcome to his works if the gulls can read them.</p>

<p>Granted, then, that every writer has some public or other at the
end of his pen, the high-minded will say that it should be a
submissive public, accepting obediently whatever he likes to give
it. Plausible as the theory sounds, great risks are attached to it.
For in that case the writer remains conscious of his public, yet is
superior to it&mdash;an uncomfortable and unfortunate combination,
as the works of Samuel Butler, George Meredith, and Henry James may
be taken to prove. Each despised the public; each desired a public;
each failed to attain a public; and each wreaked his failure upon
the public by a succession, gradually increasing in intensity, of
angularities, obscurities, and affectations which no writer whose
patron was his equal and friend would have thought it necessary to
inflict. Their crocuses, in consequence, are tortured plants,
beautiful and bright, but with something wry-necked about them,
malformed, shrivelled on the one side, overblown on the other. A
touch of the sun would have done them a world of good. Shall we
then rush to the opposite extreme and accept (if in fancy alone)
the flattering proposals which the editors of the <i>Times</i> and
the <i>Daily News</i> may be supposed to make us&mdash;"Twenty
pounds down for your crocus in precisely fifteen hundred words,
which shall blossom upon every breakfast table from John o' Groats
to the Land's End before nine o'clock to-morrow morning with the
writer's name attached"?</p>

<p>But will one crocus be enough, and must it not be a very
brilliant yellow to shine so far, to cost so much, and to have
one's name attached to it? The Press is undoubtedly a great
multiplier of crocuses. But if we look at some of these plants, we
shall find that they are only very distantly related to the
original little yellow or purple flower which pokes up through the
grass in Kensington Gardens early in March every year. The
newspaper crocus is an amazing but still a very different plant. It
fills precisely the space allotted to it. It radiates a golden
glow. It is genial, affable, warm-hearted. It is beautifully
finished, too, for let nobody think that the art of "our dramatic
critic" of the <i>Times</i> or of Mr. Lynd of the <i>Daily News</i>
is an easy one. It is no despicable feat to start a million brains
running at nine o'clock in the morning, to give two million eyes
something bright and brisk and amusing to look at. But the night
comes and these flowers fade. So little bits of glass lose their
lustre if you take them out of the sea; great prima donnas howl
like hyenas if you shut them up in telephone boxes; and the most
brilliant of articles when removed from its element is dust and
sand and the husks of straw.</p>

<p>Journalism embalmed in a book is unreadable. The patron we want,
then, is one who will help us to preserve our flowers from decay.
But as his qualities change from age to age, and it needs
considerable integrity and conviction not to be dazzled by the
pretensions or bamboozled by the persuasions of the competing
crowd, this business of patron-finding is one of the tests and
trials of authorship. To know whom to write for is to know how to
write. Some of the modern patron's qualities are, however, fairly
plain. The writer will require at this moment, it is obvious, a
patron with the book-reading habit rather than the play-going
habit. Nowadays, too, he must be instructed in the literature of
other times and races. But there are other qualities which our
special weaknesses and tendencies demand in him. There is the
question of indecency, for instance, which plagues us and puzzles
us much more than it did the Elizabethans. The twentieth-century
patron must be immune from shock. He must distinguish infallibly
between the little clod of manure which sticks to the crocus of
necessity, and that which is plastered to it out of bravado. He
must be a judge, too, of those social influences which inevitably
play so large a part in modern literature, and able to say which
matures and fortifies, which inhibits and makes sterile. Further,
there is emotion for him to pronounce on, and in no department can
he do more useful work than in bracing a writer against
sentimentality on the one hand and a craven fear of expressing his
feeling on the other. It is worse, he will say, and perhaps more
common, to be afraid of feeling than to feel too much. He will add,
perhaps, something about language, and point out how many words
Shakespeare used and how much grammar Shakespeare violated, while
we, though we keep our fingers so demurely to the black notes on
the piano, have not appreciably improved upon <i>Antony and
Cleopatra.</i> And if you can forget your sex altogether, he will
say, so much the better; a writer has none. But all this is by the
way&mdash;elementary and disputable. The patron's prime quality is
something different, only to be expressed perhaps by the use of
that convenient word which cloaks so much&mdash;atmosphere. It is
necessary that the patron should shed and envelop the crocus in an
atmosphere which makes it appear a plant of the very highest
importance, so that to misrepresent it is the one outrage not to be
forgiven this side of the grave. He must make us feel that a single
crocus, if it be a real crocus, is enough for him; that he does not
want to be lectured, elevated, instructed, or improved; that he is
sorry that he bullied Carlyle into vociferation, Tennyson into
idyllics, and Ruskin into insanity; that he is now ready to efface
himself or assert himself as his writers require; that he is bound
to them by a more than maternal tie; that they are twins indeed,
one dying if the other dies, one flourishing if the other
flourishes; that the fate of literature depends upon their happy
alliance&mdash;all of which proves, as we began by saying, that the
choice of a patron is of the highest importance. But how to choose
rightly? How to write well? Those are the questions.</p>

<h1><a name="C18" id="C18">THE MODERN ESSAY</a>
</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Mr. Rhys truly says, it is unnecessary to go profoundly into
the history and origin of the essay&mdash;whether it derives from
Socrates or Siranney the Persian&mdash;since, like all living
things, its present is more important than its past. Moreover, the
family is widely spread; and while some of its representatives have
risen in the world and wear their coronets with the best, others
pick up a precarious living in the gutter near Fleet Street. The
form, too, admits variety. The essay can be short or long, serious
or trifling, about God and Spinoza, or about turtles and Cheapside.
But as we turn over the pages of these five little
volumes,<sup>1</sup> containing essays written between 1870 and
1920, certain principles appear to control the chaos, and we detect
in the short period under review something like the progress of
history.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <i>Modern English Essays,</i> edited by Ernest
Rhys, 5 vols. (Dent).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of all forms of literature, however, the essay is the one which
least calls for the use of long words. The principle which controls
it is simply that it should give pleasure; the desire which impels
us when we take it from the shelf is simply to receive pleasure.
Everything in an essay must be subdued to that end. It should lay
us under a spell with its first word, and we should only wake,
refreshed, with its last. In the interval we may pass through the
most various experiences of amusement, surprise, interest,
indignation; we may soar to the heights of fantasy with Lamb or
plunge to the depths of wisdom with Bacon, but we must never be
roused. The essay must lap us about and draw its curtain across the
world.</p>

<p>So great a feat is seldom accomplished, though the fault may
well be as much on the reader's side as on the writer's. Habit and
lethargy have dulled his palate. A novel has a story, a poem rhyme;
but what art can the essayist use in these short lengths of prose
to sting us wide awake and fix us in a trance which is not sleep
but rather an intensification of life&mdash;a basking, with every
faculty alert, in the sun of pleasure? He must know&mdash;that is
the first essential&mdash;how to write. His learning may be as
profound as Mark Pattison's, but in an essay it must be so fused by
the magic of writing that not a fact juts out, not a dogma tears
the surface of the texture. Macaulay in one way, Froude in another,
did this superbly over and over again. They have blown more
knowledge into us in the course of one essay than the innumerable
chapters of a hundred text-books. But when Mark Pattison has to
tell us, in the space of thirty-five little pages, about Montaigne,
we feel that he had not previously assimilated M. Gr&uuml;n. M.
Gr&uuml;n was a gentleman who once wrote a bad book. M. Gr&uuml;n
and his book should have been embalmed for our perpetual delight in
amber. But the process is fatiguing; it requires more time and
perhaps more temper than Pattison had at his command. He served M.
Gr&uuml;n up raw, and he remains a crude berry among the cooked
meats, upon which our teeth must grate for ever. Something of the
sort applies to Matthew Arnold and a certain translator of Spinoza.
Literal truth-telling and finding fault with a culprit for his good
are out of place in an essay, where everything should be for our
good and rather for eternity than for the March number of the
<i>Fortnightly Review.</i> But if the voice of the scold should
never be heard in this narrow plot, there is another voice which is
as a plague of locusts&mdash;the voice of a man stumbling drowsily
among loose words, clutching aimlessly at vague ideas, the voice,
for example, of Mr. Hutton in the following passage:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Add to this that his married life was very brief, only seven
years and a half, being unexpectedly cut short, and that his
passionate reverence for his wife's memory and genius&mdash;in his
own words, "a religion"&mdash;was one which, as he must have been
perfectly sensible, he could not make to appear otherwise than
extravagant, not to say an hallucination, in the eyes of the rest
of mankind, and yet that he was possessed by an irresistible
yearning to attempt to embody it in all the tender and enthusiastic
hyperbole of which it is so pathetic to find a man who gained his
fame by his "dry-light" a master, and it is impossible not to feel
that the human incidents in Mr. Mill's career are very sad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A book could take that blow, but it sinks an essay. A biography
in two volumes is indeed the proper depository, for there, where
the licence is so much wider, and hints and glimpses of outside
things make part of the feast (we refer to the old type of
Victorian volume), these yawns and stretches hardly matter, and
have indeed some positive value of their own. But that value, which
is contributed by the reader, perhaps illicitly, in his desire to
get as much into the book from all possible sources as he can, must
be ruled out here.</p>

<p>There is no room for the impurities of literature in an essay.
Somehow or other, by dint of labour or bounty of nature, or both
combined, the essay must be pure&mdash;pure like water or pure like
wine, but pure from dullness, deadness, and deposits of extraneous
matter. Of all writers in the first volume, Walter Pater best
achieves this arduous task, because before setting out to write his
essay ("Notes on Leonardo da Vinci") he has somehow contrived to
get his material fused. He is a learned man, but it is not
knowledge of Leonardo that remains with us, but a vision, such as
we get in a good novel where everything contributes to bring the
writer's conception as a whole before us. Only here, in the essay,
where the bounds are so strict and facts have to be used in their
nakedness, the true writer like Walter Pater makes these
limitations yield their own quality. Truth will give it authority;
from its narrow limits he will get shape and intensity; and then
there is no more fitting place for some of those ornaments which
the old writers loved and we, by calling them ornaments, presumably
despise. Nowadays nobody would have the courage to embark on the
once famous description of Leonardo's lady who has</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in deep
seas and keeps their fallen day about her; and trafficked for
strange webs with Eastern merchants; and, as Leda, was the mother
of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The passage is too thumb-marked to slip naturally into the
context. But when we come unexpectedly upon "the smiling of women
and the motion of great waters", or upon "full of the refinement of
the dead, in sad, earth-coloured raiment, set with pale stones", we
suddenly remember that we have ears and we have eyes, and that the
English language fills a long array of stout volumes with
innumerable words, many of which are of more than one syllable. The
only living Englishman who ever looks into these volumes is, of
course, a gentleman of Polish extraction. But doubtless our
abstention saves us much gush, much rhetoric, much high-stepping
and cloud-prancing, and for the sake of the prevailing sobriety and
hard-headedness we should be willing to barter the splendour of Sir
Thomas Browne and the vigour of Swift.</p>

<p>Yet, if the essay admits more properly than biography or fiction
of sudden boldness and metaphor, and can be polished till every
atom of its surface shines, there are dangers in that too. We are
soon in sight of ornament. Soon the current, which is the
life-blood of literature, runs slow; and instead of sparkling and
flashing or moving with a quieter impulse which has a deeper
excitement, words coagulate together in frozen sprays which, like
the grapes on a Christmas-tree, glitter for a single night, but are
dusty and garish the day after. The temptation to decorate is great
where the theme may be of the slightest. What is there to interest
another in the fact that one has enjoyed a walking tour, or has
amused oneself by rambling down Cheapside and looking at the
turtles in Mr. Sweeting's shop window? Stevenson and Samuel Butler
chose very different methods of exciting our interest in these
domestic themes. Stevenson, of course, trimmed and polished and set
out his matter in the traditional eighteenth-century form. It is
admirably done, but we cannot help feeling anxious, as the essay
proceeds, lest the material may give out under the craftsman's
fingers. The ingot is so small, the manipulation so incessant. And
perhaps that is why the peroration&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To sit still and contemplate&mdash;to remember the faces of
women without desire, to be pleased by the great deeds of men
without envy, to be everything and everywhere in sympathy and yet
content to remain where and what you are&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>has the sort of insubstantiality which suggests that by the time
he got to the end he had left himself nothing solid to work with.
Butler adopted the very opposite method. Think your own thoughts,
he seems to say, and speak them as plainly as you can. These
turtles in the shop window which appear to leak out of their shells
through heads and feet suggest a fatal faithfulness to a fixed
idea. And so, striding unconcernedly from one idea to the next, we
traverse a large stretch of ground; observe that a wound in the
solicitor is a very serious thing; that Mary Queen of Scots wears
surgical boots and is subject to fits near the Horse Shoe in
Tottenham Court Road; take it for granted that no one really cares
about &AElig;schylus; and so, with many amusing anecdotes and some
profound reflections, reach the peroration, which is that, as he
had been told not to see more in Cheapside than he could get into
twelve pages of the <i>Universal Review,</i> he had better stop.
And yet obviously Butler is at least as careful of our pleasure as
Stevenson; and to write like oneself and call it not writing is a
much harder exercise in style than to write like Addison and call
it writing well.</p>

<p>But, however much they differ individually, the Victorian
essayists yet had something in common. They wrote at greater length
than is now usual, and they wrote for a public which had not only
time to sit down to its magazine seriously, but a high, if
peculiarly Victorian, standard of culture by which to judge it. It
was worth while to speak out upon serious matters in an essay; and
there was nothing absurd in writing as well as one possibly could
when, in a month or two, the same public which had welcomed the
essay in a magazine would carefully read it once more in a book.
But a change came from a small audience of cultivated people to a
larger audience of people who were not quite so cultivated. The
change was not altogether for the worse. In volume iii. we find Mr.
Birrell and Mr. Beerbohm. It might even be said that there was a
reversion to the classic type, and that the essay by losing its
size and something of its sonority was approaching more nearly the
essay of Addison and Lamb. At any rate, there is a great gulf
between Mr. Birrell on Carlyle and the essay which one may suppose
that Carlyle would have written upon Mr. Birrell. There is little
similarity between <i>A Cloud of Pinafores,</i> by Max Beerbohm,
and <i>A Cynic's Apology,</i> by Leslie Stephen. But the essay is
alive; there is no reason to despair. As the conditions change so
the essayist, most sensitive of all plants to public opinion,
adapts himself, and if he is good makes the best of the change, and
if he is bad the worst. Mr. Birrell is certainly good; and so we
find that, though he has dropped a considerable amount of weight,
his attack is much more direct and his movement more supple. But
what did Mr. Beerbohm give to the essay and what did he take from
it? That is a much more complicated question, for here we have an
essayist who has concentrated on the work and is without doubt the
prince of his profession.</p>

<p>What Mr. Beerbohm gave was, of course, himself. This presence,
which has haunted the essay fitfully from the time of Montaigne,
had been in exile since the death of Charles Lamb. Matthew Arnold
was never to his readers Matt, nor Walter Pater affectionately
abbreviated in a thousand homes to Wat. They gave us much, but that
they did not give. Thus, some time in the nineties, it must have
surprised readers accustomed to exhortation, information, and
denunciation to find themselves familiarly addressed by a voice
which seemed to belong to a man no larger than themselves. He was
affected by private joys and sorrows, and had no gospel to preach
and no learning to impart. He was himself, simply and directly, and
himself he has remained. Once again we have an essayist capable of
using the essayist's most proper but most dangerous and delicate
tool. He has brought personality into literature, not unconsciously
and impurely, but so consciously and purely that we do not know
whether there is any relation between Max the essayist and Mr.
Beerbohm the man. We only know that the spirit of personality
permeates every word that he writes. The triumph is the triumph of
style. For it is only by knowing how to write that you can make use
in literature of your self; that self which, while it is essential
to literature, is also its most dangerous antagonist. Never to be
yourself and yet always&mdash;that is the problem. Some of the
essayists in Mr. Rhys' collection, to be frank, have not altogether
succeeded in solving it. We are nauseated by the sight of trivial
personalities decomposing in the eternity of print. As talk, no
doubt, it was charming, and certainly the writer is a good fellow
to meet over a bottle of beer. But literature is stern; it is no
use being charming, virtuous, or even learned and brilliant into
the bargain, unless, she seems to reiterate, you fulfil her first
condition&mdash;to know how to write.</p>

<p>This art is possessed to perfection by Mr. Beerbohm. But he has
not searched the dictionary for polysyllables. He has not moulded
firm periods or seduced our ears with intricate cadences and
strange melodies. Some of his companions&mdash;Henley and
Stevenson, for example&mdash;are momentarily more impressive. But
<i>A Cloud of Pinafores</i> has in it that indescribable
inequality, stir, and final expressiveness which belong to life and
to life alone. You have not finished with it because you have read
it, any more than friendship is ended because it is time to part.
Life wells up and alters and adds. Even things in a book-case
change if they are alive; we find ourselves wanting to meet them
again; we find them altered. So we look back upon essay after essay
by Mr. Beerbohm, knowing that, come September or May, we shall sit
down with them and talk. Yet it is true that the essayist is the
most sensitive of all writers to public opinion. The drawing-room
is the place where a great deal of reading is done nowadays, and
the essays of Mr. Beerbohm lie, with an exquisite appreciation of
all that the position exacts, upon the drawing-room table. There is
no gin about; no strong tobacco; no puns, drunkenness, or insanity.
Ladies and gentlemen talk together, and some things, of course, are
not said.</p>

<p>But if it would be foolish to attempt to confine Mr. Beerbohm to
one room, it would be still more foolish, unhappily, to make him,
the artist, the man who gives us only his best, the representative
of our age. There are no essays by Mr. Beerbohm in the fourth or
fifth volumes of the present collection. His age seems already a
little distant, and the drawing-room table, as it recedes, begins
to look rather like an altar where, once upon a time, people
deposited offerings&mdash;fruit from their own orchards, gifts
carved with their own hands. Now once more the conditions have
changed. The public needs essays as much as ever, and perhaps even
more. The demand for the light middle not exceeding fifteen hundred
words, or in special cases seventeen hundred and fifty, much
exceeds the supply. Where Lamb wrote one essay and Max perhaps
writes two, Mr. Belloc at a rough computation produces three
hundred and sixty-five. They are very short, it is true. Yet with
what dexterity the practised essayist will utilise his
space&mdash;beginning as close to the top of the sheet as possible,
judging precisely how far to go, when to turn, and how, without
sacrificing a hair's-breadth of paper, to wheel about and alight
accurately upon the last word his editor allows! As a feat of skill
it is well worth watching. But the personality upon which Mr.
Belloc, like Mr. Beerbohm, depends suffers in the process. It comes
to us not with the natural richness of the speaking voice, but
strained and thin and full of mannerisms and affectations, like the
voice of a man shouting through a megaphone to a crowd on a windy
day. "Little friends, my readers", he says in the essay called "An
Unknown Country", and he goes on to tell us how&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a shepherd the other day at Findon Fair who had come
from the east by Lewes with sheep, and who had in his eyes that
reminiscence of horizons which makes the eyes of shepherds and of
mountaineers different from the eyes of other men....I went with
him to hear what he had to say, for shepherds talk quite
differently from other men.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Happily this shepherd had little to say, even under the stimulus
of the inevitable mug of beer, about the Unknown Country, for the
only remark that he did make proves him either a minor poet, unfit
for the care of sheep, or Mr. Belloc himself masquerading with a
fountain pen. That is the penalty which the habitual essayist must
now be prepared to face. He must masquerade. He cannot afford the
time either to be himself or to be other people. He must skim the
surface of thought and dilute the strength of personality. He must
give us a worn weekly halfpenny instead of a solid sovereign once a
year.</p>

<p>But it is not Mr. Belloc only who has suffered from the
prevailing conditions. The essays which bring the collection to the
year 1920 may not be the best of their authors' work, but, if we
except writers like Mr. Conrad and Mr. Hudson, who have strayed
into essay writing accidentally, and concentrate upon those who
write essays habitually, we shall find them a good deal affected by
the change in their circumstances. To write weekly, to write daily,
to write shortly, to write for busy people catching trains in the
morning or for tired people coming home in the evening, is a
heart-breaking task for men who know good writing from bad. They do
it, but instinctively draw out of harm's way anything precious that
might be damaged by contact with the public, or anything sharp that
might irritate its skin. And so, if one reads Mr. Lucas, Mr. Lynd,
or Mr. Squire in the bulk, one feels that a common greyness silvers
everything. They are as far removed from the extravagant beauty of
Walter Pater as they are from the intemperate candour of Leslie
Stephen. Beauty and courage are dangerous spirits to bottle in a
column and a half; and thought, like a brown paper parcel in a
waistcoat pocket, has a way of spoiling the symmetry of an article.
It is a kind, tired, apathetic world for which they write, and the
marvel is that they never cease to attempt, at least, to write
well.</p>

<p>But there is no need to pity Mr. Clutton Brock for this change
in the essayist's conditions. He has clearly made the best of his
circumstances and not the worst. One hesitates even to say that he
has had to make any conscious effort in the matter, so naturally
has he effected the transition from the private essayist to the
public, from the drawing-room to the Albert Hall. Paradoxically
enough, the shrinkage in size has brought about a corresponding
expansion of individuality. We have no longer the "I" of Max and of
Lamb, but the "we" of public bodies and other sublime personages.
It is "we" who go to hear the <i>Magic Flute</i>; "we" who ought to
profit by it; "we", in some mysterious way, who, in our corporate
capacity, once upon a time actually wrote it. For music and
literature and art must submit to the same generalisation or they
will not carry to the farthest recesses of the Albert Hall. That
the voice of Mr. Clutton Brock, so sincere and so disinterested,
carries such a distance and reaches so many without pandering to
the weakness of the mass or its passions must be a matter of
legitimate satisfaction to us all. But while "we" are gratified,
"I", that unruly partner in the human fellowship, is reduced to
despair. "I" must always think things for himself, and feel things
for himself. To share them in a diluted form with the majority of
well-educated and well-intentioned men and women is for him sheer
agony; and while the rest of us listen intently and profit
profoundly, "I" slips off to the woods and the fields and rejoices
in a single blade of grass or a solitary potato.</p>

<p>In the fifth volume of modern essays, it seems, we have got some
way from pleasure and the art of writing. But in justice to the
essayists of 1920 we must be sure that we are not praising the
famous because they have been praised already and the dead because
we shall never meet them wearing spats in Piccadilly. We must know
what we mean when we say that they can write and give us pleasure.
We must compare them; we must bring out the quality. We must point
to this and say it is good because it is exact, truthful, and
imaginative:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nay, retire men cannot when they would; neither will they, when
it were Reason; but are impatient of Privateness, even in age and
sickness, which require the shadow: like old Townsmen: that will
still be sitting at their street door, though therby they offer Age
to Scorn...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>and to this, and say it is bad because it is loose, plausible,
and commonplace:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With courteous and precise cynicism on his lips, he thought of
quiet virginal chambers, of waters singing under the moon, of
terraces where taintless music sobbed into the open night, of pure
maternal mistresses with protecting arms and vigilant eyes, of
fields slumbering in the sunlight, of leagues of ocean heaving
under warm tremulous heavens, of hot ports, gorgeous and
perfumed...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It goes on, but already we are bemused with sound and neither
feel nor hear. The comparison makes us suspect that the art of
writing has for backbone some fierce attachment to an idea. It is
on the back of an idea, something believed in with conviction or
seen with precision and thus compelling words to its shape, that
the diverse company which includes Lamb and Bacon, and Mr. Beerbohm
and Hudson, and Vernon Lee and Mr. Conrad, and Leslie Stephen and
Butler and Walter Pater reaches the farther shore. Very various
talents have helped or hindered the passage of the idea into words.
Some scrape through painfully; others fly with every wind
favouring. But Mr. Belloc and Mr. Lucas and Mr. Squire are not
fiercely attached to anything in itself. They share the
contemporary dilemma&mdash;that lack of an obstinate conviction
which lifts ephemeral sounds through the misty sphere of anybody's
language to the land where there is a perpetual marriage, a
perpetual union. Vague as all definitions are, a good essay must
have this permanent quality about it; it must draw its curtain
round us, but it must be a curtain that shuts us in, not out.</p>

<h1><a name="C19" id="C19">JOSEPH CONRAD</a><sup>1</sup>
</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suddenly, without giving us time to arrange our thoughts or
prepare our phrases, our guest has left us; and his withdrawal
without farewell or ceremony is in keeping with his mysterious
arrival, long years ago, to take up his lodging in this country.
For there was always an air of mystery about him. It was partly his
Polish birth, partly his memorable appearance, partly his
preference for living in the depths of the country, out of ear-shot
of gossips, beyond reach of hostesses, so that for news of him one
had to depend upon the evidence of simple visitors with a habit of
ringing door-bells who reported of their unknown host that he had
the most perfect manners, the brightest eyes, and spoke English
with a strong foreign accent.</p>

<p><sup>&nbsp;</sup>
</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> August, 1914.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, though it is the habit of death to quicken and focus our
memories, there clings to the genius of Conrad something
essentially, and not accidentally, difficult of approach. His
reputation of later years was, with one obvious exception,
undoubtedly the highest in England; yet he was not popular. He was
read with passionate delight by some; others he left cold and
lustreless. Among his readers were people of the most opposite ages
and sympathies. Schoolboys of fourteen, driving their way through
Marryat, Scott, Henty, and Dickens, swallowed him down with the
rest; while the seasoned and the fastidious, who in process of time
have eaten their way to the heart of literature and there turn over
and over a few precious crumbs, set Conrad scrupulously upon their
banqueting table. One source of difficulty and disagreement is, of
course, to be found where men have at all times found it, in his
beauty. One opens his pages and feels as Helen must have felt when
she looked in her glass and realised that, do what she would, she
could never in any circumstances pass for a plain woman. So Conrad
had been gifted, so he had schooled himself, and such was his
obligation to a strange language wooed characteristically for its
Latin qualities rather than its Saxon that it seemed impossible for
him to make an ugly or insignificant movement of the pen. His
mistress, his style, is a little somnolent sometimes in repose. But
let somebody speak to her, and then how magnificently she bears
down upon us, with what colour, triumph, and majesty! Yet it is
arguable that Conrad would have gained both in credit and in
popularity if he had written what he had to write without this
incessant care for appearances. They block and impede and distract,
his critics say, pointing to those famous passages which it is
becoming the habit to lift from their context and exhibit among
other cut flowers of English prose. He was self-conscious and stiff
and ornate, they complain, and the sound of his own voice was
dearer to him than the voice of humanity in its anguish. The
criticism is familiar, and as difficult to refute as the remarks of
deaf people when <i>Figaro</i> is played. They see the orchestra;
far off they hear a dismal scrape of sound; their own remarks are
interrupted, and, very naturally, they conclude that the ends of
life would be better served if instead of scraping Mozart those
fifty fiddlers broke stones upon the road. That beauty teaches,
that beauty is a disciplinarian, how are we to convince them, since
her teaching is inseparable from the sound of her voice and to that
they are deaf? But read Conrad, not in birthday books but in the
bulk, and he must be lost indeed to the meaning of words who does
not hear in that rather stiff and sombre music, with its reserve,
its pride, its vast and implacable integrity, how it is better to
be good than bad, how loyalty is good and honesty and courage,
though ostensibly Conrad is concerned merely to show us the beauty
of a night at sea. But it is ill work dragging such intimations
from their element. Dried in our little saucers, without the magic
and mystery of language, they lose their power to excite and goad;
they lose the drastic power which is a constant quality of Conrad's
prose.</p>

<p>For it was by virtue of something drastic in him, the qualities
of a leader and captain, that Conrad kept his hold over boys and
young people. Until <i>Nostromo</i> was written his characters, as
the young were quick to perceive, were fundamentally simple and
heroic, however subtle the mind and indirect the method of their
creator. They were seafarers, used to solitude and silence. They
were in conflict with Nature, but at peace with man. Nature was
their antagonist; she it was who drew forth honour, magnanimity,
loyalty, the qualities proper to man; she who in sheltered bays
reared to womanhood beautiful girls unfathomable and austere. Above
all, it was Nature who turned out such gnarled and tested
characters as Captain Whalley and old Singleton, obscure but
glorious in their obscurity, who were to Conrad the pick of our
race, the men whose praises he was never tired of celebrating:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They had been strong as those are strong who know neither doubts
nor hopes. They had been impatient and enduring, turbulent and
devoted, unruly and faithful. Well-meaning people had tried to
represent these men as whining over every mouthful of their food,
as going about their work in fear of their lives. But in truth they
had been men who knew toil, privation, violence,
debauchery&mdash;but knew not fear, and had no desire of spite in
their hearts. Men hard to manage, but easy to inspire; voiceless
men&mdash;but men enough to scorn in their hearts the sentimental
voices that bewailed the hardness of their fate. It was a fate
unique and their own; the capacity to bear it appeared to them the
privilege of the chosen! Their generation lived inarticulate and
indispensable, without knowing the sweetness of affections or the
refuge of a home&mdash;and died free from the dark menace of a
narrow grave. They were the everlasting children of the mysterious
sea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such were the characters of the early books&mdash;<i>Lord Jim,
Typhoon, The Nigger of the "Narcissus", Youth</i>; and these books,
in spite of the changes and fashions, are surely secure of their
place among our classics. But they reach this height by means of
qualities which the simple story of adventure, as Marryat told it,
or Fenimore Cooper, has no claim to possess. For it is clear that
to admire and celebrate such men and such deeds, romantically,
whole-heartedly and with the fervour of a lover, one must be
possessed of the double vision; one must be at once inside and out.
To praise their silence one must possess a voice. To appreciate
their endurance one must be sensitive to fatigue. One must be able
to live on equal terms with the Whalleys and the Singletons and yet
hide from their suspicious eyes the very qualities which enable one
to understand them. Conrad alone was able to live that double life,
for Conrad was compound of two men; together with the sea captain
dwelt that subtle, refined, and fastidious analyst whom he called
Marlow. "A most discreet, understanding man", he said of
Marlow.</p>

<p>Marlow was one of those born observers who are happiest in
retirement. Marlow liked nothing better than to sit on deck, in
some obscure creek of the Thames, smoking and recollecting; smoking
and speculating; sending after his smoke beautiful rings of words
until all the summer's night became a little clouded with tobacco
smoke. Marlow, too, had a profound respect for the men with whom he
had sailed; but he saw the humour of them. He nosed out and
described in masterly fashion those livid creatures who prey
successfully upon the clumsy veterans. He had a flair for human
deformity; his humour was sardonic. Nor did Marlow live entirely
wreathed in the smoke of his own cigars. He had a habit of opening
his eyes suddenly and looking&mdash;at a rubbish heap, at a port,
at a shop counter&mdash;and then complete in its burning ring of
light that thing is flashed bright upon the mysterious background.
Introspective and analytical, Marlow was aware of this peculiarity.
He said the power came to him suddenly. He might, for instance,
overhear a French officer murmur "Mon Dieu, how the time
passes!"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing [he comments] could have been more commonplace than this
remark; but its utterance coincided for me with a moment of vision.
It's extraordinary how we go through life with eyes half shut, with
dull ears, with dormant thoughts....Nevertheless, there can be but
few of us who had never known one of these rare moments of
awakening, when we see, hear, understand, ever so
much&mdash;everything&mdash;in a flash, before we fall back again
into our agreeable somnolence. I raised my eyes when he spoke, and
I saw him as though I had never seen him before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Picture after picture he painted thus upon that dark background;
ships first and foremost, ships at anchor, ships flying before the
storm, ships in harbour; he painted sunsets and dawns; he painted
the night; he painted the sea in every aspect; he painted the gaudy
brilliancy of Eastern ports, and men and women, their houses and
their attitudes. He was an accurate and unflinching observer,
schooled to that "absolute loyalty towards his feelings and
sensations", which, Conrad wrote, "an author should keep hold of in
his most exalted moments of creation". And very quietly and
compassionately Marlow sometimes lets fall a few words of epitaph
which remind us, with all that beauty and brilliancy before our
eyes, of the darkness of the background.</p>

<p>Thus a rough-and-ready distinction would make us say that it is
Marlow who comments, Conrad who creates. It would lead us, aware
that we are on dangerous ground, to account for that change which,
Conrad tells us, took place when he had finished the last story in
the <i>Typhoon</i> volume&mdash;"a subtle change in the nature of
the inspiration"&mdash;by some alteration in the relationship of
the two old friends. "...it seemed somehow that there was nothing
more in the world to write about." It was Conrad, let us suppose,
Conrad the creator, who said that, looking back with sorrowful
satisfaction upon the stories he had told; feeling as he well might
that he could never better the storm in <i>The Nigger of the
"Narcissus"</i>, or render more faithful tribute to the qualities
of British seamen than he had done already in <i>Youth</i> and
<i>Lord Jim.</i> It was then that Marlow, the commentator, reminded
him how, in the course of nature, one must grow old, sit smoking on
deck, and give up seafaring. But, he reminded him, those strenuous
years had deposited their memories; and he even went so far perhaps
as to hint that, though the last word might have been said about
Captain Whalley and his relation to the universe, there remained on
shore a number of men and women whose relationships, though of a
more personal kind, might be worth looking into. If we further
suppose that there was a volume of Henry James on board and that
Marlow gave his friend the book to take to bed with him, we may
seek support in the fact that it was in 1905 that Conrad wrote a
very fine essay upon that master.</p>

<p>For some years, then, it was Marlow who was the dominant
partner. <i>Nostromo, Chance, The Arrow of Gold</i> represent that
stage of the alliance which some will continue to find the richest
of all. The human heart is more intricate than the forest, they
will say; it has its storms; it has its creatures of the night; and
if as novelist you wish to test man in all his relationships, the
proper antagonist is man; his ordeal is in society, not solitude.
For them there will always be a peculiar fascination in the books
where the light of those brilliant eyes falls not only upon the
waste of waters but upon the heart in its perplexity. But it must
be admitted that, if Marlow thus advised Conrad to shift his angle
of vision, the advice was bold. For the vision of a novelist is
both complex and specialised; complex, because behind his
characters and apart from them must stand something stable to which
he relates them; specialised because since he is a single person
with one sensibility the aspects of life in which he can believe
with conviction are strictly limited. So delicate a balance is
easily disturbed. After the middle period Conrad never again was
able to bring his figures into perfect relation with their
background. He never believed in his later, and more highly
sophisticated characters as he had believed in his early seamen.
When he had to indicate their relation to that other unseen world
of novelists, the world of values and convictions, he was far less
sure what those values were. Then, over and over again, a single
phrase, "He steered with care", coming at the end of a storm,
carried in it a whole morality. But in this more crowded and
complicated world such terse phrases became less and less
appropriate. Complex men and women of many interests and relations
would not submit to so summary a judgement; or, if they did, much
that was important in them escaped the verdict. And yet it was very
necessary to Conrad's genius, with its luxuriant and romantic
power, to have some law by which its creations could be tried.
Essentially&mdash;such remained his creed&mdash;this world of
civilised and self-conscious people is based upon "a few very
simple ideas"; but where, in the world of thoughts and personal
relations, are we to find them? There are no masts in
drawing-rooms; the typhoon does not test the worth of politicians
and business men. Seeking and not finding such supports, the world
of Conrad's later period has about it an involuntary obscurity, an
inconclusiveness, almost a disillusionment which baffles and
fatigues. We lay hold in the dusk only of the old nobilities and
sonorities: fidelity, compassion, honour, service&mdash;beautiful
always, but now a little wearily reiterated, as if times had
changed. Perhaps it was Marlow who was at fault. His habit of mind
was a trifle sedentary. He had sat upon deck too long; splendid in
soliloquy, he was less apt in the give and take of conversation;
and those "moments of vision" flashing and fading, do not serve as
well as steady lamplight to illumine the ripple of life and its
long, gradual years. Above all, perhaps, he did not take into
account how, if Conrad was to create, it was essential first that
he should believe.</p>

<p>Therefore, though we shall make expeditions into the later books
and bring back wonderful trophies, large tracts of them will remain
by most of us untrodden. It is the earlier books&mdash;<i>Youth,
Lord Jim, Typhoon, The Nigger of the "Narcissus"</i>&mdash;that we
shall read in their entirety. For when the question is asked, what
of Conrad will survive and where in the ranks of novelists we are
to place him, these books, with their air of telling us something
very old and perfectly true, which had lain hidden but is now
revealed, will come to mind and make such questions and comparisons
seem a little futile. Complete and still, very chaste and very
beautiful, they rise in the memory as, on these hot summer nights,
in their slow and stately way first one star comes out and then
another.</p>

<h1><a name="C20" id="C20">HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY</a>
</h1>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the first place a contemporary can scarcely fail to be struck
by the fact that two critics at the same table at the same moment
will pronounce completely different opinions about the same book.
Here, on the right, it is declared a masterpiece of English prose;
on the left, simultaneously, a mere mass of waste-paper which, if
the fire could survive it, should be thrown upon the flames. Yet
both critics are in agreement about Milton and about Keats. They
display an exquisite sensibility and have undoubtedly a genuine
enthusiasm. It is only when they discuss the work of contemporary
writers that they inevitably come to blows. The book in question,
which is at once a lasting contribution to English literature and a
mere farrago of pretentious mediocrity, was published about two
months ago. That is the explanation; that is why they differ.</p>

<p>The explanation is a strange one. It is equally disconcerting to
the reader who wishes to take his bearings in the chaos of
contemporary literature and to the writer who has a natural desire
to know whether his own work, produced with infinite pains and in
almost utter darkness, is likely to burn for ever among the fixed
luminaries of English letters or, on the contrary, to put out the
fire. But if we identify ourselves with the reader and explore his
dilemma first, our bewilderment is short-lived enough. The same
thing has happened so often before. We have heard the doctors
disagreeing about the new and agreeing about the old twice a year
on the average, in spring and autumn, ever since Robert Elsmere, or
was it Stephen Phillips, somehow pervaded the atmosphere, and there
was the same disagreement among grown-up people about these books
too. It would be much more marvellous, and indeed much more
upsetting, if, for a wonder, both gentlemen agreed, pronounced
Blank's book an undoubted masterpiece, and thus faced us with the
necessity of deciding whether we should back their judgement to the
extent of ten and sixpence. Both are critics of reputation; the
opinions tumbled out so spontaneously here will be starched and
stiffened into columns of sober prose which will uphold the dignity
of letters in England and America.</p>

<p>It must be some innate cynicism, then, some ungenerous distrust
of contemporary genius, which determines us automatically as the
talk goes on that, were they to agree&mdash;which they show no
signs of doing&mdash;half a guinea is altogether too large a sum to
squander upon contemporary enthusiasms, and the case will be met
quite adequately by a card to the library. Still the question
remains, and let us put it boldly to the critics themselves. Is
there no guidance nowadays for a reader who yields to none in
reverence for the dead, but is tormented by the suspicion that
reverence for the dead is vitally connected with understanding of
the living? After a rapid survey both critics are agreed that there
is unfortunately no such person. For what is their own judgement
worth where new books are concerned? Certainly not ten and
sixpence. And from the stores of their experience they proceed to
bring forth terrible examples of past blunders; crimes of criticism
which, if they had been committed against the dead and not against
the living, would have lost them their jobs and imperilled their
reputations. The only advice they can offer is to respect one's own
instincts, to follow them fearlessly and, rather than submit them
to the control of any critic or reviewer alive, to check them by
reading and reading again the masterpieces of the past.</p>

<p>Thanking them humbly, we cannot help reflecting that it was not
always so. Once upon a time, we must believe, there was a rule, a
discipline, which controlled the great republic of readers in a way
which is now unknown. That is not to say that the great
critic&mdash;the Dryden, the Johnson, the Coleridge, the
Arnold&mdash;was an impeccable judge of contemporary work, whose
verdicts stamped the book indelibly and saved the reader the
trouble of reckoning the value for himself. The mistakes of these
great men about their own contemporaries are too notorious to be
worth recording. But the mere fact of their existence had a
centralising influence. That alone, it is not fantastic to suppose,
would have controlled the disagreements of the dinner-table and
given to random chatter about some book just out an authority now
entirely to seek. The diverse schools would have debated as hotly
as ever, but at the back of every reader's mind would have been the
consciousness that there was at least one man who kept the main
principles of literature closely in view: who, if you had taken to
him some eccentricity of the moment, would have brought it into
touch with permanence and tethered it by his own authority in the
contrary blasts of praise and blame.<sup>1</sup> But when it comes
to the making of a critic, nature must be generous and society
ripe. The scattered dinner-tables of the modern world, the chase
and eddy of the various currents which compose the society of our
time, could only be dominated by a giant of fabulous dimensions.
And where is even the very tall man whom we have the right to
expect? Reviewers we have but no critic; a million competent and
incorruptible policemen but no judge. Men of taste and learning and
ability are for ever lecturing the young and celebrating the dead.
But the too frequent result of their able and industrious pens is a
desiccation of the living tissues of literature into a network of
little bones. Nowhere shall we find the downright vigour of a
Dryden, or Keats with his fine and natural bearing, his profound
insight and sanity, or Flaubert and the tremendous power of his
fanaticism, or Coleridge, above all, brewing in his head the whole
of poetry and letting issue now and then one of those profound
general statements which are caught up by the mind when hot with
the friction of reading as if they were of the soul of the book
itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> How violent these are two quotations will show. "It
[<i>Told by an Idiot</i>] should be read as the <i>Tempest</i>
should be read, and as <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> should be read,
for if Miss Macaulay's poetic gift happens to be less sublime than
those of the author of the <i>Tempest,</i> and if her irony happens
to be less tremendous than that of the author of <i>Gulliver's
Travels,</i> her justice and wisdom are no less noble than
theirs."&mdash;<i>The Daily News.</i></p>

<p>The next day we read: "For the rest one can only say that if Mr.
Eliot had been pleased to write in demotic English <i>The Waste
Land</i> might not have been, as it just is to all but
anthropologists, and literati, so much waste-paper."&mdash;<i>The
Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And to all this, too, the critics generously agree. A great
critic, they say, is the rarest of beings. But should one
miraculously appear, how should we maintain him, on what should we
feed him? Great critics, if they are not themselves great poets,
are bred from the profusion of the age. There is some great man to
be vindicated, some school to be founded or destroyed. But our age
is meagre to the verge of destitution. There is no name which
dominates the rest. There is no master in whose workshop the young
are proud to serve apprenticeship. Mr. Hardy has long since
withdrawn from the arena, and there is something exotic about the
genius of Mr. Conrad which makes him not so much an influence as an
idol, honoured and admired, but aloof and apart. As for the rest,
though they are many and vigorous and in the full flood of creative
activity, there is none whose influence can seriously affect his
contemporaries, or penetrate beyond our day to that not very
distant future which it pleases us to call immortality. If we make
a century our test, and ask how much of the work produced in these
days in England will be in existence then, we shall have to answer
not merely that we cannot agree upon the same book, but that we are
more than doubtful whether such a book there is. It is an age of
fragments. A few stanzas, a few pages, a chapter here and there,
the beginning of this novel, the end of that, are equal to the best
of any age or author. But can we go to posterity with a sheaf of
loose pages, or ask the readers of those days, with the whole of
literature before them, to sift our enormous rubbish heaps for our
tiny pearls? Such are the questions which the critics might
lawfully put to their companions at table, the novelists and
poets.</p>

<p>At first the weight of pessimism seems sufficient to bear down
all opposition. Yes, it is a lean age, we repeat, with much to
justify its poverty; but, frankly, if we pit one century against
another the comparison seems overwhelmingly against us.
<i>Waverley, The Excursion, Kubla Khan, Don Juan, Hazlitt's Essays,
Pride and Prejudice, Hyperion,</i> and <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>
were all published between 1800 and 1821. Our century has not
lacked industry; but if we ask for masterpieces it appears on the
face of it that the pessimists are right. It seems as if an age of
genius must be succeeded by an age of endeavour; riot and
extravagance by cleanliness and hard work. All honour, of course,
to those who have sacrificed their immortality to set the house in
order. But if we ask for masterpieces, where are we to look? A
little poetry, we may feel sure, will survive; a few poems by Mr.
Yeats, by Mr. Davies, by Mr. De la Mare. Mr. Lawrence, of course,
has moments of greatness, but hours of something very different.
Mr. Beerbohm, in his way, is perfect, but it is not a big way.
Passages in <i>Far Away and Long Ago</i> will undoubtedly go to
posterity entire. <i>Ulysses</i> was a memorable
catastrophe&mdash;immense in daring, terrific in disaster. And so,
picking and choosing, we select now this, now that, hold it up for
display, hear it defended or derided, and finally have to meet the
objection that even so we are only agreeing with the critics that
it is an age incapable of sustained effort, littered with
fragments, and not seriously to be compared with the age that went
before.</p>

<p>But it is just when opinions universally prevail and we have
added lip service to their authority that we become sometimes most
keenly conscious that we do not believe a word that we are saying.
It is a barren and exhausted age, we repeat; we must look back with
envy to the past. Meanwhile it is one of the first fine days of
spring. Life is not altogether lacking in colour. The telephone,
which interrupts the most serious conversations and cuts short the
most weighty observations, has a romance of its own. And the random
talk of people who have no chance of immortality and thus can speak
their minds out has a setting, often, of lights, streets, houses,
human beings, beautiful or grotesque, which will weave itself into
the moment for ever. But this is life; the talk is about
literature. We must try to disentangle the two, and justify the
rash revolt of optimism against the superior plausibility, the
finer distinction, of pessimism.</p>

<p>Our optimism, then, is largely instinctive. It springs from the
fine day and the wine and the talk; it springs from the fact that
when life throws up such treasures daily, daily suggests more than
the most voluble can express, much though we admire the dead, we
prefer life as it is. There is something about the present which we
would not exchange, though we were offered a choice of all past
ages to live in. And modern literature, with all its imperfections,
has the same hold on us and the same fascination. It is like a
relation whom we snub and scarify daily, but, after all, cannot do
without. It has the same endearing quality of being that which we
are, that which we have made, that in which we live, instead of
being something, however august, alien to ourselves and beheld from
the outside. Nor has any generation more need than ours to cherish
its contemporaries. We are sharply cut off from our predecessors. A
shift in the scale&mdash;the sudden slip of masses held in position
for ages&mdash;has shaken the fabric from top to bottom, alienated
us from the past and made us perhaps too vividly conscious of the
present. Every day we find ourselves doing, saying, or thinking
things that would have been impossible to our fathers. And we feel
the differences which have not been noted far more keenly than the
resemblances which have been very perfectly expressed. New books
lure us to read them partly in the hope that they will reflect this
re-arrangement of our attitude&mdash;these scenes, thoughts, and
apparently fortuitous groupings of incongruous things which impinge
upon us with so keen a sense of novelty&mdash;and, as literature
does, give it back into our keeping, whole and comprehended. Here
indeed there is every reason for optimism. No age can have been
more rich than ours in writers determined to give expression to the
differences which separate them from the past and not to the
resemblances which connect them with it. It would be invidious to
mention names, but the most casual reader dipping into poetry, into
fiction, into biography can hardly fail to be impressed by the
courage, the sincerity, in a word, by the widespread originality of
our time. But our exhilaration is strangely curtailed. Book after
book leaves us with the same sense of promise unachieved, of
intellectual poverty, of brilliance which has been snatched from
life but not transmuted into literature. Much of what is best in
contemporary work has the appearance of being noted under pressure,
taken down in a bleak shorthand which preserves with astonishing
brilliance the movements and expressions of the figures as they
pass across the screen. But the flash is soon over, and there
remains with us a profound dissatisfaction. The irritation is as
acute as the pleasure was intense.</p>

<p>After all, then, we are back at the beginning, vacillating from
extreme to extreme, at one moment enthusiastic, at the next
pessimistic, unable to come to any conclusion about our
contemporaries. We have asked the critics to help us, but they have
deprecated the task. Now, then, is the time to accept their advice
and correct these extremes by consulting the masterpieces of the
past. We feel ourselves indeed driven to them, impelled not by calm
judgement but by some imperious need to anchor our instability upon
their security. But, honestly, the shock of the comparison between
past and present is at first disconcerting. Undoubtedly there is a
dullness in great books. There is an unabashed tranquillity in page
after page of Wordsworth and Scott and Miss Austen which is
sedative to the verge of somnolence. Opportunities occur and they
neglect them. Shades and subtleties accumulate and they ignore
them. They seem deliberately to refuse to gratify those senses
which are stimulated so briskly by the moderns; the senses of
sight, of sound, of touch&mdash;above all, the sense of the human
being, his depth and the variety of his perceptions, his
complexity, his confusion, his self, in short. There is little of
all this in the works of Wordsworth and Scott and Jane Austen. From
what, then, arises that sense of security which gradually,
delightfully, and completely overcomes us? It is the power of their
belief&mdash;their conviction, that imposes itself upon us. In
Wordsworth, the philosophic poet, this is obvious enough. But it is
equally true of the careless Scott, who scribbled masterpieces to
build castles before breakfast, and of the modest maiden lady who
wrote furtively and quietly simply to give pleasure. In both there
is the same natural conviction that life is of a certain quality.
They have their judgement of conduct. They know the relations of
human beings towards each other and towards the universe. Neither
of them probably has a word to say about the matter outright, but
everything depends on it. Only believe, we find ourselves saying,
and all the rest will come of itself. Only believe, to take a very
simple instance which the recent publication of <i>The Watsons</i>
brings to mind, that a nice girl will instinctively try to soothe
the feelings of a boy who has been snubbed at a dance, and then, if
you believe it implicitly and unquestioningly, you will not only
make people a hundred years later feel the same thing, but you will
make them feel it as literature. For certainty of that kind is the
condition which makes it possible to write. To believe that your
impressions hold good for others is to be released from the cramp
and confinement of personality. It is to be free, as Scott was
free, to explore with a vigour which still holds us spell-bound the
whole world of adventure and romance. It is also the first step in
that mysterious process in which Jane Austen was so great an adept.
The little grain of experience once selected, believed in, and set
outside herself, could be put precisely in its place, and she was
then free to make it, by a process which never yields its secrets
to the analyst, into that complete statement which is
literature.</p>

<p>So then our contemporaries afflict us because they have ceased
to believe. The most sincere of them will only tell us what it is
that happens to himself. They cannot make a world, because they are
not free of other human beings. They cannot tell stories because
they do not believe that stories are true. They cannot generalise.
They depend on their senses and emotions, whose testimony is
trustworthy, rather than on their intellects whose message is
obscure. And they have perforce to deny themselves the use of some
of the most powerful and some of the most exquisite of the weapons
of their craft. With the whole wealth of the English language at
the back of them, they timidly pass about from hand to hand and
book to book only the meanest copper coins. Set down at a fresh
angle of the eternal prospect they can only whip out their
notebooks and record with agonised intensity the flying gleams,
which light on what? and the transitory splendours, which may,
perhaps, compose nothing whatever. But here the critics interpose,
and with some show of justice.</p>

<p>If this description holds good, they say, and is not, as it may
well be, entirely dependent upon our position at the table and
certain purely personal relationships to mustard pots and flower
vases, then the risks of judging contemporary work are greater than
ever before. There is every excuse for them if they are wide of the
mark; and no doubt it would be better to retreat, as Matthew Arnold
advised, from the burning ground of the present to the safe
tranquillity of the past. "We enter on burning ground," wrote
Matthew Arnold, "as we approach the poetry of times so near to us,
poetry like that of Byron, Shelley, and Wordsworth, of which the
estimates are so often not only personal, but personal with
passion," and this, they remind us, was written in the year 1880.
Beware, they say, of putting under the microscope one inch of a
ribbon which runs many miles; things sort themselves out if you
wait; moderation, and a study of the classics are to be
recommended. Moreover, life is short; the Byron centenary is at
hand; and the burning question of the moment is, did he, or did he
not, marry his sister? To sum up, then&mdash;if indeed any
conclusion is possible when everybody is talking at once and it is
time to be going&mdash;it seems that it would be wise for the
writers of the present to renounce the hope of creating
masterpieces. Their poems, plays, biographies, novels are not books
but notebooks, and Time, like a good schoolmaster, will take them
in his hands, point to their blots and scrawls and erasions, and
tear them across; but he will not throw them into the waste-paper
basket. He will keep them because other students will find them
very useful. It is from the notebooks of the present that the
masterpieces of the future are made. Literature, as the critics
were saying just now, has lasted long, has undergone many changes,
and it is only a short sight and a parochial mind that will
exaggerate the importance of these squalls, however they may
agitate the little boats now tossing out at sea. The storm and the
drenching are on the surface; continuity and calm are in the
depths.</p>

<p>As for the critics whose task it is to pass judgement upon the
books of the moment, whose work, let us admit, is difficult,
dangerous, and often distasteful, let us ask them to be generous of
encouragement, but sparing of those wreaths and coronets which are
so apt to get awry, and fade, and make the wearers, in six months
time, look a little ridiculous. Let them take a wider, a less
personal view of modern literature, and look indeed upon the
writers as if they were engaged upon some vast building, which
being built by common effort, the separate workmen may well remain
anonymous. Let them slam the door upon the cosy company where sugar
is cheap and butter plentiful, give over, for a time at least, the
discussion of that fascinating topic&mdash;whether Byron married
his sister&mdash;and, withdrawing, perhaps, a handsbreadth from the
table where we sit chattering, say something interesting about
literature itself. Let us buttonhole them as they leave, and recall
to their memory that gaunt aristocrat, Lady Hester Stanhope, who
kept a milk-white horse in her stable in readiness for the Messiah
and was for ever scanning the mountain tops, impatiently but with
confidence, for signs of his approach, and ask them to follow her
example; scan the horizon; see the past in relation to the future;
and so prepare the way for masterpieces to come.</p>
