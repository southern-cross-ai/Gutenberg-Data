  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THIS little volume is a reproduction of six articles which
  appeared some little time ago in the columns of the <i>Times</i>. I know
  nothing about the authors except what can be gathered from their own writing.
  But the articles from the outset arrested my attention, as they doubtless did
  that of many others, by their originality and breadth of view, and so I read
  on with steadily growing interest and sympathy. The suggestions of the
  writers appeared to me to deserve more than a cursory perusal, and I am glad
  that they are now to be given to the public in a permanent form.</p>

  <p>The tremendous upheaval caused by the war has led to great searchings of
  heart, and the air is full of bold and sometimes rather wild speculation
  about fundamentals. 'It is not often in our history,' as some one has
  recently said,* 'that the nation has found time to think. Now, by a curious
  paradox, while the flower of her youth and strength are fighting for her
  freedom and her life, the others have a chance of thinking out the best use
  to which that life and freedom can be put when they are safe once more.
  Indeed at the present time activity is as marked in the field of ideas as it
  is in the field of war.'</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* 'Report of the Committee of the Privy Council on
  Scientific and Industrial Research,' p. 19. ]</p>

  <p>What is characteristic about that activity is its unusual freedom from the
  shackles of dogma and convention. It may be said&mdash;using the word in no
  party sense&mdash;that we are all Radicals to-day, all prepared to entertain,
  and to judge dispassionately on their merits, proposals which only a few
  years ago would have seemed wildly revolutionary. But with all this
  speculation going on, much of it excellent in quality, there is some danger
  of distraction. There is a limit to what can be done, all at once, to alter
  the bases, social, economic and political, of our national life. We seem to
  be more than ever in need of synthesis, of some unifying principle, else we
  may easily find ourselves pursuing a number of ends which, though perhaps
  individually commendable, are incompatible with one another. Hence we have
  cause to be grateful to any one who seeks, like the authors of this volume,
  to cover the whole field, to see all the main objects of the new national
  endeavour in their relation to one another, and to find principles by which
  they can be worked into a coherent scheme.</p>

  <p>So bold an enterprise has the faults of its qualities. No human mind can
  be equally familiar with the ins and outs of all the large and diverse
  questions here brought under review.</p>

  <p>And it is no disparagement to the authors of this volume to say that they
  seem to me less at home in dealing with the constitutional and political
  aspects of their subject than with the economic and social. Not that their
  handling of the former is without merit and interest. I, of all men, should
  be the first to welcome their clear perception that the problem of
  reconstruction is not merely a British but an Imperial problem, and their
  advocacy of 'the development of the present British Parliament into an
  Imperial Parliament with oversea representatives,' leaving the purely local
  concerns of the United Kingdom to be dealt with by subordinate assemblies.
  Nor am I any less in sympathy with their attitude to our outworn party
  divisions&mdash;the 'bilateral system of conflict about false issues,' now
  happily in abeyance, and never, let us hope, to be revived in its old
  insincerity. As that system has been found an intolerable encumbrance in time
  of war, it would certainly be no less wasteful and futile when we come to
  deal with the colossal problems which the return of peace will bring. If
  these problems are to be tackled with any prospect of a good result, the
  stereotyped old parties have got to disappear and to make room for fresh
  groups, whose members will be bound together by a genuine agreement of
  opinion on the live issues of the new age, not by a mechanical and
  meaningless acceptance of the shibboleths of a dead past. That this necessary
  regrouping would be assisted by a change in our methods of election, and
  especially by the adoption of what is known as 'proportional representation,'
  is a point on which our authors lay particular stress. 'The sane method of
  voting is known as Proportional Representation with large constituencies and
  the single transferable vote, and it is as reasonable and necessary that the
  country should adopt it as soon as possible as that it should adopt the right
  types of aeroplane and the best sorts of gun. The advantage of this method is
  not a matter of opinion, but a matter of demonstration.' That is a strong
  statement, though personally I do not disagree with it. But I find more
  difficulty in accepting another and even more drastic reform, which the
  writers advocate with equal insistence, namely, the substitution of
  'occupational' for local constituencies. And without going into the merits of
  this proposal, about which much might be said by way of criticism, it is in
  my humble opinion evident that the attempt to run two such radical changes
  concurrently is quite impracticable. Nor do our authors attempt to show us
  how the simultaneous adoption of these two new principles could be made to
  work. In this as in other portions of their schemes of constitutional change
  there is indeed much that is ingenious and attractive. But I cannot help
  feeling that we are sometimes getting rather far away from the immediately
  possible. I doubt whether the writers have much experience of actual
  politics. In their excursions into that region, so inhospitable to
  philosophy, they do not seem to have their feet quite on the ground.</p>

  <p>Very different is the impression made upon my mind by the chapters which
  deal with the industrial future. The breadth of view and boldness of
  imagination, which are the great merits of the whole treatise, are in this
  portion of it buttressed by a familiarity with existing conditions and a
  close touch with fact. Opinions may differ about many of the arguments of the
  writers. But no serious student of the subject can fail to benefit from
  contact with their ideas or to recognise the insight, the grasp, and the
  architectonic quality of their work. They are not scratching the surface of
  the question, but going to the root of it. In following their lead the reader
  will find himself constantly at the centre of the problem, not wandering in
  the outskirts and on the fringes of it. And I shall be greatly surprised if
  he does not feel, when he puts down the book, that it has saved him from
  pursuing m.any false scents and has shed new light upon the few big essential
  points, on which it has caused him to concentrate his attention.</p>

  <p>On none of these points is the case of the writers more clear and
  convincing than When they are pressing home the intimate connection between
  the reform of our educational system, now so loudly demanded&mdash;which aims
  at much more and better teaching of science&mdash;and such a reorganisation
  of our great national industries as will enable us to make good use of the
  increased number of men of scientific training whom our schools and colleges
  are asked to turn out. 'To educate without creating opportunity,' as they
  truly say, 'is to set a bonus upon the export of national ability.' I will
  not try to summarise their argument, which is already quite sufficiently
  condensed. The reader will be much better employed in studying it in their
  own words. But it may be interesting to point out how remarkably their
  contention on this head is reinforced by the recently published
  Report&mdash;from which I have already quoted&mdash;of the Committee of the
  Privy Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. In that Report, a
  remarkable document far above the average of official productions of its
  class, the opinion is expressed that 'a good deal of the inertia which
  British manufacturers have shown towards research may have been due to a
  realisation, partly instinctive perhaps, but partly based on experience, that
  research <i>on the small scale they could afford</i> (the italics are mine)
  was at best a doubtful proposition.' And again, 'Our experience up to the
  present leads us to think that the small scale on which most British
  industrial firms have been planned is one of the principal impediments in the
  way of the organisation of research, with a view to the conduct of those long
  and complicated investigations which are necessary for the solution of the
  fundamental problems lying at the basis of our staple industries.'</p>

  <p>Here we have precisely the same insistence on the 'importance of scale'
  which the reader will find repeatedly illustrated in the following pages. The
  words I have just quoted might be paralleled by a number of passages in this
  volume. I will quote only one: 'Though a million pound business may be easily
  able to sustain and profit by fifty chemists, of whom one now and again makes
  a paying discovery, it does not follow that a hundred thousand pound business
  can profitably sustain any chemists at all, much less keep up a laboratory
  for five. Although a State containing a number of big businesses may maintain
  a multitude of industrial scientific investigators employed in them, it does
  not follow necessarily that another State, although it contains many more
  businesses and those of greater aggregate value, can, if they are businesses
  of a smaller scale individually, employ any investigators at all. It
  certainly does not reflect unfavourably upon either the intelligence, the
  energy or the patriotism of the business men in the small-scale-business
  country, and it is high time that that sort of blame, which entirely confuses
  the issue, ceased.'</p>

  <p>The authors of the Report and the writers of this volume are both largely
  concerned with what, in the jargon of the day, are known as 'pivotal or key
  industries.' I think that the passages which I have just quoted from them may
  be said to contain a pivotal or key idea. It may turn out after all that the
  shortcomings with which it is just now the custom to reproach the British man
  of business, in contrast, for instance, with his German rival&mdash;his
  conservatism, his lack of enterprise, his neglect to avail himself of the aid
  of science, his reluctance to combine with his fellows for common
  ends&mdash;are not so much faults of character, as necessary consequences of
  an antiquated system, for which not individuals, but State policy, economic
  doctrine and wrong popular notions should share the blame. The majority of
  our men of business have no doubt been doing their best on the lines which
  they have always been taught, and have themselves believed to be the only
  right ones. But the world has been moving at a tremendous pace, and the
  industrial and commercial methods and maxims of fifty or sixty years ago
  have, under the changed conditions, lost much of their virtue. They were the
  natural product of the transitional epoch which followed the Industrial
  Revolution. The mistake which most people then made was in thinking that the
  principles of Go As You Please and the General Scramble, which may have been
  necessary and even appropriate during the inevitable break-up of the Old
  Order, could possibly be the permanent foundations of the New. But we all
  recognise now that there must be a fresh effort of economic and social
  organisation. We see the crude and formidable beginnings of it already in the
  growth of mammoth businesses and combines and in the huge federations of
  Labour. They are a product of the vast scale of modern enterprise resulting
  from the achievements of science in the development of mechanical power, and
  they render the position of the small isolated business and of the so-called
  'free,' that is to say unassociated, labourer constantly more precarious and
  untenable. The drawback and evils of these great agglomerations are obvious,
  but they are after all the necessary raw material of the New Order. They only
  make for oppression and social conflict when they are not controlled in the
  interests of the community, and are directed, as they are even now not wholly
  directed, to the pursuit of purely selfish ends.</p>

  <p>For this process of agglomeration is certainly going on. There is indeed
  no resisting it, and those who cannot accommodate themselves to inevitable
  conditions will presently be forced to the wall. The recognition of these
  truths is no longer confined to the theorist and the outside observer. From
  the heart of the business world itself come the most urgent warnings against
  excessive unregulated competition and the loudest appeals for organisation on
  co-operative lines and for the helping hand of the State. I wonder whether
  many of my readers have met with a little book, published not long ago,
  bearing the title of 'Trade as a Science,' from the pen of Mr. Ernest Benn. I
  am afraid it has so far not attracted the attention it deserves, for it is
  full of practical knowledge and shrewd ideas, expounded in a terse, fresh,
  vigorous, not to say pugnacious style. It is written exclusively from the
  point of view of a man actually engaged in 'the making and selling of goods'
  who has not much use for professional economists and none at all for
  politicians. Yet this eminently practical person is just as condemnatory as
  any member of the Fabian Society, of the 'individualistic, inarticulate,
  unorganised mass' of old-fashioned British trade. He sees as clearly as any
  one that the future belongs to big-scale businesses or to such smaller
  businesses as can learn to work together and to pool their resources for
  certain objects&mdash;the full use of scientific research being only one of
  them &mdash;which individually they are not strong enough to attain.</p>

  <p>This modern tendency to concentration in business, alike on its productive
  and its distributive side, has all-important consequences beyond the economic
  sphere. It affects the whole structure of society and is responsible for the
  new views now steadily gaining ground of the functions and responsibilities
  of the State. Of this reaction of recent economic developments upon social
  and civic life our authors have much to say. It is indeed their central
  theme. And if in discussing it within such narrow limits of space they are
  compelled, as they themselves confess, to be 'severely elementary,' I do not
  think they can be accused of any lack of thoroughness in laying out the
  ground. Perhaps the point at which the whole range of their constructive
  principles is most clearly exhibited is in the brilliant chapter on
  'Scientific Agriculture and the Nation's Food.' Progressive agriculturists,
  in their uphill but increasingly hopeful struggle, will be grateful for the
  support here given to all their main objects by men who evidently are not of
  their number, but approach the subject from a new angle and purely from the
  national point of view\ And if I dare add another sentence or two to an
  Introduction which has already run to excessive length, let me specially
  commend to them, and to others, what our authors have to say about the true
  place and also the limitations of a Tariff, or indeed of any form of
  Protection, in a national economic policy. Their wise and discriminating
  words on this subject should show us a way out of what has now become a
  barren and boring controversy between Protectionists and Free Traders,
  obviate any further misunderstanding, and allow us all to get to practical
  business.</p>

  <p>But I must not let myself be tempted to stray into any further discussion
  of the numerous and alluring topics which are crowded into this stimulating
  book. My duty is discharged in commending it to the public as a valuable and
  distinguished contribution to the national symposium on the revolution which
  is being brought about by the war. There are indeed some who think that all
  such speculations are idle and based on a false hypothesis. When the war is
  once over, they tell us, we shall all hasten to return to the old ways. Its
  lessons will soon be forgotten, and a few years hence everything will be very
  much the same as it was before. For my own part I differ entirely from that
  view of the probabilities of the future. No doubt it is possible to
  exaggerate the effect which even the greatest external events can have upon
  the character of human beings. The men and women who survive the war will be
  the same men and women, and it would be a moral miracle if they should be
  entirely transformed by it. But it would be even more miraculous if the
  catastrophic experiences of the last two years did not leave a permanent mark
  upon them. Apart from its material effects which both in the way of
  destruction and construction are simply immense, the present struggle is
  certain, as it seems to me, to leave behind it a profound change in the
  national spirit and outlook. Whether we like it or not there is no
  possibility of getting back into the old grooves. When the war at long last
  comes to an end, we shall find ourselves confronted with a maze of
  difficulties such as no generation of men, of whom w^e have any record, have
  ever had to face before. As the war itself is the greatest in history, so
  will its aftermath be the most prodigious. And upon all those, who are not of
  necessity wholly absorbed in the conduct of the war itself, there rests no
  higher obligation than to think constantly, strenuously, connectedly, with
  soberness but also, if they are fortunate enough to possess it, with
  imagination, of the new measures and methods by which those difficulties may
  haply be overcome. To that kind of thought, serious, practical and
  constructive, the following pages should afford valuable aid.</p>

  <p>&mdash;MlLNER.</p>

  <h2><a id="art1"
     name="art1">I. &mdash; SCIENCE IN EDUCATION AND INDUSTRY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN a recent conversation between two friends the complaint
  was made that there existed no clear and systematic national plan or policy
  for the development of the Empire after the war. This complaint was
  discussed, and both friends concluded at last that it was unfounded, that
  there did exist&mdash;though too often expressed in a fragmentary way and
  much obscured by personal and party questions&mdash; a clear and simple
  course before the country. The two friends attempted a plain statement of
  this course, and came to a very complete agreement upon it. Their attempt
  seemed so to clear up their own ideas that they think the results may appeal
  to a wider circle. They have ventured to compress them into some three or
  four letters (in which it may be noted two hands are engaged), believing that
  what they will have to say will outline a complete and consistent liberal and
  progressive policy in British affairs. They find they can approach the whole
  matter most conveniently by coming into it in reference to the recent
  discussion of the national neglect of science.</p>

  <p>For the last quarter of a century one of these writers has been interested
  in the movement for the development of science teaching and scientific
  research in this country. He has been equally impressed by the excellence and
  by the futility of the criticisms levelled at our higher educational
  organization, from the days of Matthew Arnold to the recent gathering in the
  rooms of the Linnean Society, when, under appropriately asphyxiating
  conditions, witness after witness testified to the suffocation of science in
  British affairs, to waste, disastrous ignorance, and murderous indifference
  to knowledge in our administration, and to our planless future. The figure of
  Sir Ray Lankester still haunts his memory. Sir Ray, with a corrugated brow
  and troubled eyes, asking in a kind of perplexed whisper what it was held us
  back, why, with so overwhelming a case against neglect, with such instances
  and proofs, in these days of tragic and bitter demonstration, we still even
  now were not getting on to any real expansion either of scientific education
  or of the organization of research.</p><br>

  <h3>SCIENCE AND THE PUBLIC SERVICES</h3>

  <p class="first">Sir Ray Lankester's answer to his own question was to attack
  the Civil Service Commissioners. They have a bias in favour of the old
  classical education, and they load the scales against science by overmarking
  Greek and Latin subjects and undermarking science. In practice this closes
  the big public services to the science student. Clever and ambitious boys are
  drawn over to the classical side; they acquire an 'anti-modern side' habit of
  mind and a certain contempt for the modern side residuum. The science of the
  country suffers doubly&mdash;first, because the abler and administrative men
  are unscientific and ignorant of science; and, secondly, because science does
  not get the pick of our young men. The case of the scientific men for an
  immediate scaling up of the marks given for science in the Civil Service
  requirements is overwhelming and unanswerable. Nothing that is written here
  is to be taken as detracting from the urgency of that demand.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless it is arguable that obstruction by the friends of the old-
  fashioned education among the Civil Service Commissioners does not exhaust
  the account of the forces that blockade science from this country. The
  diagnosis of our scientific congestion, our scientific atrophy, may be
  carried farther. The question may be a much wider one than it is generally
  supposed to be. The British neglect of science may be not a specific trouble
  in itself, but a symptom of some much decider and more general trouble. It is
  possible that in attacking classical dons. University prejudices. Convocation
  clerics, scholastic stupidity, national apathy about science, journalistic
  ignorance, and so on and so on, the scientific progressive has been attacking
  on too narrow a front and at the wrong point in the front. It is conceivable
  that British education will never be extensively altered in this way; the
  experience of a quarter of a century at least points to that conclusion. It
  is conceivable that the educational problem is not a problem-in-itself at
  all, and that when we begin to regard it as a part in a much larger problem,
  as part of the general problem of national reconstruction, we shall find
  that, instead of our difficulties being increased by this enlargement of
  purview, they will be found to vanish away.</p>

  <p>This, at any rate, is the thesis now presented. It is submitted that the
  problem of national education and the problem of economic reconstruction are
  inseparable and cannot be dealt with apart. They must be part of one plan,
  the national plan. What other problems may also enter into this plan may be
  deferred for a later date. The present thesis is quite enough for this
  opening discussion.</p><br>

  <h3>THE GREAT DYE QUESTION</h3>

  <p class="first">Everybody is familiar at the present time with what we may
  call the instance of the dyes, the great dye question. That may serve very
  well as our type case. What is true of the dyes will be found with a rough
  parallelism to be true of metallurgy, engineering, the electrical industry,
  and so on. The story of the dyes as it is usually told is the story of a
  British discovery exploited by Germany because Germany was developing and was
  able to get to work at once with a large class of properly trained mediocre
  chemical investigators, while Britain had no such class available. At a
  comparatively trivial amount spent upon scientific education Germany captured
  an industry not merely worth twenty million and more a year to her, but
  giving her, as we now discover, remarkable military and political advantages.
  So far we endorse the story. But then comes the implication that had Britain
  laid down, as one lays down wine, a few thousand chemical students in the
  'eighties and 'nineties to mature, at a cost, let us say, of a thousand
  pounds a head or so, nothing of the sort would have happened, and that all
  that we have now to do after the war is just to set aside an annual million
  earmarked 'chemists,' and then all these arrears will be made up to us.</p>

  <p>But, indeed, the business is not so simple as that. We submit that it has
  been practically impossible for Britain to produce that class of technical
  chemists up to the present time, that no subsidizing of education, however
  generous, would have enabled her to do so, and that without changes far more
  extensive than a mere endowment of technical universities and colleges she
  will still be unable to produce it.</p>

  <p>There comes in at this point something which is generally spoken of as the
  apathy of the British manufacturer. Everyone has heard of his remarkable
  refusal to employ technical chemists and scientific experts, even such few as
  we had. And everybody has heard of those wonderful German firms that keep one
  hundred, three hundred, six hundred industrial chemists constantly at work.
  From that the narrator proceeds to vehement abuse of the conservative British
  employer, whose only ambition is to be mistaken for a country gentleman, who
  lives by his grandfather's routines, deserts the works for an estate, shoots
  pheasants, and so on and so on. We are all familiar with the shrill
  indictment, the popular novelist-reformer is for ever at it. The 'apathetic'
  manufacturer shares with the 'clerical headmaster' his acutest indignation.
  Such social criticisms brighten life, but they fail altogether to exhaust
  this problem.</p><br>

  <h3>OUR OLD ECONOMIC SYSTEM</h3>

  <p class="first">Indeed, they scarcely touch it. Even if the British
  manufacturer lived always in his shirt-sleeves and never washed his hands,
  and kept a torn-out page of a chemical text-book pinned above his
  shaving-glass, he would still not be in a position to employ a large staff of
  technical chemists. He cannot do so because his business and his plant are
  not upon a scale that permits that sort of thing. In that lies the gist of
  this matter. The British economic system developed some generations before
  the German did, before electricity, and concurrently with the railways; it is
  older, it is more old-fashioned, its parts are upon a different scale.
  America and Germany have developed the present economic system upon that
  larger scale which the enormous development of means and rapidity of
  communications in the nineteenth century have made possible. Britain was
  doing very well on the older scale. Necessarily one must state things
  crudely, but the broad fact in the business issue between Britain and Germany
  during the last quarter-century is that Britain has been a country of a great
  number of little hundred-thousand-pound businesses, so to speak, with a
  tradition of mutual competition, with, indeed, competition preached as a
  gospel, and Germany has been a country of fewer and co-operating five-million
  businesses and combines. All sorts of consequences follow from that essential
  structural difference in the two systems, but the only one that concerns us
  now is in its relation to the industrial application of science.</p>

  <p>It is one of the commonest delusions of unwary minds that things can be
  reduced to scale and still remain the same sort of things. But for most
  practical purposes that is not the case; you cannot reduce a house to scale,
  for example, because of the doors and windows, and our legislative amateurs
  in popular economy will probably discover in a year or so that the psychology
  of investing five shillings is not at all the same process writ small as the
  psychology of investing a thousand pounds. In the same way, though a million-
  pound business may be easily able to sustain and profit by fifty chemists, of
  whom one now and then makes a paying discovery, it does not follow that a
  hundred-thousand-pound business can profitably sustain any chemists at all,
  much less keep up a laboratory for five. Although a State containing a number
  of big businesses may maintain a multitude of industrial scientific
  investigators employed in them, it does not follow necessarily that another
  State, although it contains many more businesses, and those of a greater
  aggregate value, can, if they are businesses on a smaller scale individually,
  employ any investigators at all. It certainly does not reflect unfavourably
  upon either the intelligence, the energy, or the patriotism of the business
  men in the small-scale-business country, and it is high time that that sort
  of blame, which entirely confuses the issue, ceased. And although the
  colleges of the latter State, the State on small-business lines, turn out
  chemists and investigators by the myriad, it does not follow that they will
  be efficiently employed, at least until they can learn to live on the wages
  of a boy clerk and experiment in an outhouse for the love of knowledge and
  their employer with three test tubes and a Bunsen burner. The tendency of the
  best among them will be to emigrate to the big-business State. Perkins and
  his aniline dyes go to Germany. To educate without creating opportunity is to
  set a bonus upon the export of national ability. In other words, big
  business, progressive methods, and scientific research come together and must
  come together. Syndicating businesses and organizing scientific education and
  research are two aspects of the same job.</p>

  <p>THE PATTERN OF 1920</p>

  <p>The conclusion follows from these considerations that those who are
  attacking the problem of the industrial reorganization of the Empire and
  those who are working for educational reconstruction need to join hands.
  Apart both movements are likely to be far less effective than upon a broader
  common intention. Apart each may much more easily fail. The British
  industrial and business problem is to scrap the methods of 1850-60, and not
  to imitate Germany with a copy of her 1890-1900 methods, but to go right
  ahead to the 1920 pattern. What that pattern should be it is in its general
  form not very difficult to say, whatever discoveries in detail remain to be
  made. The experiment of controlled establishments, the experiences of trusts
  and combines, German State socialism, the theories of guild socialism, are
  all in the solution. When one watches a process of crystallisation ever and
  again one sees a jerk and a shift as the growing crystals adjust. Such an
  incident occurred recently. This was the big amalgamation of Brunner Mond and
  Co. and Castner Kellner and Co. The shares of both companies appreciated at
  once. But why should amalgamation in the chemical industry stop at Brunner
  Mond and Co. and Castner Kellner and Co.? Why not face the present
  desirability and the final necessity of a still more comprehensive
  crystallisation, and prepare now to bring in the British Empire itself as an
  active and contributing partner in the ultimate combination?</p>

  <p>Brunner Mond and Co., it is said, have never had a strike, retain their
  men for exceptionally long periods, train many of them specially, and pension
  old men off. They do this with no pretensions to philanthropy, but because it
  pays. But no small hundred-thousand-pound concern can afford to do anything
  of the sort; it works on a narrower basis for too immediate ends. A chemical
  industry on an Imperial scale can, on the other hand, do things on a far
  wider basis, can work for larger and remoter advantages, and turn its vast
  profits far more directly to the enduring benefit of the community. It can
  plan such a liberal and comprehensive treatment of labour as no smaller
  employer can attempt. The minor employer deals with his men by the hour, day,
  or job; he has to take them as they come 'out of the unknown' to him; he is
  unable to treat them generously as they age; he is powerless to help their
  children; indeed, to do his duty in any way beyond the immediate business in
  hand. But a nationalized industry can see the life of labour as a whole, and
  can deal with its own section of organized labour not through a mere string
  of isolated jobs, snatch-profit occasions, and petty disputes, but as a
  scheme of lives; can guarantee ease presently in return for energy now, and
  can formulate and realise big, thorough, efficient, economical, and racially
  beneficial schemes of education, training, selection, direction, and
  research.</p>

  <p>In this time of reconstruction there are two entirely divergent ways in
  which the new education may develop: one leading straight to Britain's last
  muddle, and the other to an Imperial renascence. The first is the traditional
  national method, planless, incoherent, wildly wasteful. It begins in a tangle
  of agitating bodies, committees, and organizations; it goes on to much zeal,
  more anger, storms of blame, scraps of fine performance, the setting to work
  of conceivably quite large numbers of professors, instructors, demonstrators,
  and students, who won't understand quite why, who won't understand quite to
  what end, who will get all sorts of knowledge perhaps, but certainly no
  knowledge of the ends and methods of the business machinery in which their
  knowledge is required. And so on to disputes, bitterness, inadequate
  opportunities, wasted lives, and an ultimate triumph of some better-organized
  foreign State. That is the easier way, the greater probability.</p><br>

  <h3>RESEARCH AMALGAMATED WITH INDUSTRY</h3>

  <p class="first">The second way is a replanning of scientific education and
  research, concurrently with, and as a part of, a systematic amalgamation and
  co- ordination of industries, so that the same men who plan the plant may
  have a decisive voice in the education of the men who will work the plant.
  The boys and girls in the schools and the men and women in the technical
  college will be instructed in, they will be parties to, the great national
  industrial undertakings. Instead of thinking of leaving school, as one routs
  out of bed on a cold morning, and plunging into an alien world of insecure,
  generally distasteful, and, from the employee's point of view, unmeaning
  employment, they will think about and choose and prepare themselves for the
  part they will play and the career they will follow, if not in most cases to
  conspicuous success and usefulness, then at least to an ordinary conclusion
  in comfort and leisure, in the national life.</p>

  <p>This, then, is the present thesis; that if they wish to be anything more
  than an academic voice crying vainly in the darkness, Sir Ray Lankester and
  his friends of the British Science Guild must set out and take counsel with
  and understand those captains and organizers of industry and those labour
  leaders, whose primary concern should be the reinstatement of the national
  economic life after the war. There must be mutual inspiration and help, a
  common theory and a common aim. Talking about national scientific education
  without talking about social and economic reconstruction is ploughing the
  sands and beating the air. The effort to save the minds of the next
  generation from those clerical, social, and merely scholastic powers,
  amiable, but unimaginative and ignorant of present-day needs and
  possibilities, that at present so fatally control our educational machinery,
  is doomed to certain failure unless it is part of a far more comprehensive
  scheme.</p>

  <p>So far we have insisted merely upon the correlation of education and
  industrialism. Certain subsequent arguments will seek to extend this
  correlation so as to demonstrate the futility of any sort of piece-meal
  reconstruction at the present time, and the necessity for one national plan.
  And, further, we shall attempt to state in plain, broad terms the lines upon
  which such a plan must be drawn if it is to succeed. These ideas will be the
  very carefully thought-out views of the writer, and they will be set out as
  the basis of a campaign of reconstructive effort. Our British world is at
  present a confusion of fragmentary good intentions and partial proposals. We
  discuss the projection of tariffs and we discuss the organization of labour
  without considering the profound difference it makes whether we are dealing
  with the projection and manning of a chaotic world of individualistic
  businesses run for unchecked private profit or a system of amalgamated
  businesses in which the public interest is the controlling shareholder. A man
  may very well be a violent Free-trader and trade unionist in the former
  alternative and quite the reverse in the latter. We are going about the
  business of our national future like a family which is acquiring an
  automobile by sending father out to get some sort of good engine, it doesn't
  matter what, mother to back her fancy in carburettors, Frankie to get
  acetylene headlights, Bertie to buy wheels, and Georgie to buy tires,
  regardless of each other and the weight and size of the whole, leaving the
  rest of the equipage to happen somehow, while sister Beatrice sits at home
  inquiring into the respective merits of the petrol and the steam engine, and
  Caroline looks through the accounts to find out whether the family can afford
  to set up a car of any sort at all. But, indeed, the future of the Empire is
  now either one whole, one plan, or&mdash;failure and fragmentation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="art2"
     name="art2">II. &mdash; SCIENTIFIC AGRICULTURE AND THE NATION'S
     FOOD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT is probable that historians will mark the year 1914 as
  the end of the Socialist movement; it was an ailing movement before that
  time, and after the war we shall find new oppositions and new formulae
  replacing the obsolete '-isms' of the former age. This is not to say that
  Socialism will be counted to have failed. No movement can be said to have
  failed which has sat so triumphantly on the grave of its antagonists as
  Socialism has sat upon the grave of laissez faire. But the movement combined
  general ideas of the utmost sanity with methods of utter impracticability,
  and, while the sounder elements of the Socialistic proposal have so passed
  into the general consciousness as to be no longer distinctive, its rejected
  factors shrivel and perish as things completely judged, and its name becomes
  a shelter for 'rebels' and faddists.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the deadest part of Socialism now is all that centred about the
  idea of 'expropriation.' In the 'eighties the Socialists were always
  discussing the taking away of the land from its owners and of capital from
  its owners, 'with or without compensation.' The fiercer sort were very stern
  against compensation. At the most they would consider humane provision for
  the declining years of the more elderly rich. They regretfully abandoned the
  idea of a punitive treatment of Dives so far as this world went. And then the
  economic system was to be handed over to the most marvellous officials, who
  were no doubt to spring forth at once in limitless numbers from the brains of
  the Socialist propagandists ready equipped for their task. The early
  Socialists expounded their doctrine with the blithest disregard of what one
  might have imagined was a fairly obvious fact, that you cannot suddenly
  create whole new classes of men. That is the common error of almost all the
  revolutionary schemes of the study and of the work-room alike. It was the
  English Fabian Socialists who first betrayed a doubt of the practicability of
  this sensational change of hands. Being largely recruited from the ranks of
  Government clerks, who did at least correspond about affairs, the Fabians
  perceived a necessity for prepared bureaucrats.</p><br>

  <h3>ABSURDITY OF 'EXPROPRIATION'</h3>

  <p class="first">That Fabian doubt has grown now to a complete understanding
  of the absurdity of any proposal to 'expropriate' owners and rebuild the
  social world anew with new units of an entirely different sort. There can be
  no interval for such a reconstruction; we may change the world indeed as much
  as we like, provided we keep on going all the time, but we cannot do the
  smallest change that involves a week's stoppage. So that while on the one
  hand the bulk of reasonable men in the Empire have come over to the primary
  Socialist assertion that food production, transport, all the big
  industrialism are matters not for the profit-seeking of private ownership,
  but for public administration, it has also come to the completest realization
  that it is impossible to wrench these services suddenly from the hands that
  control them to-day. We cannot cut to-morrow off from yesterday; the world
  will be of the same men. Without any preachment or propaganda we all find
  ourselves to-day drifted into a virtual agreement upon the reasonable course
  of economic development. It is a development towards nationalization; so far
  we go with the Socialist, but it is a development not by the Socialist's
  panacea of 'expropriation' at all, but by amalgamation, by co-ordination and
  co-operation, by bringing the State into partnership, and an increasing
  partnership, in the big businesses that result from those amalgamations, by
  developing the crude beginnings of the 'controlled establishment,' by the
  quid pro quo of profit-sharing and control in the national interest in
  exchange for the national credit and a helpful tariff.</p>

  <p>This outlook for the land and the food supply of the Empire opens some
  broad questions of very remarkable interest. It is not one of the least of
  the compensations for this war that it has necessitated experiments upon an
  otherwise impossible scale in the handling and rationing of the people's food
  and drink, and upon the conversion of private into quasi-public businesses.
  There has been haste and no doubt there has been much waste and a
  considerable variety of incidental inaccuracies and abuses, favouritism,
  jobbery, the wrong man in this place and the crooked man in that, but on the
  whole this series of improvised 'nationalizations' is full of suggestion and
  encouragement for the more deliberate and permanent readjustments that must
  be made after the war. The most striking demonstration has been of the
  practicability of the State coming in as the food buyer and distributor, and
  of the great possibilities of control and participation that this opens out
  to us, first, of the already very extensively syndicated popular provision
  trade of the country, and secondly, of the cultivator. The State can step in
  here with a minimum of social disturbance. It need expropriate nobody, it
  need confiscate nothing, it leaves the landlord his acres, the farmer his
  farm, the wholesaler his warehouse, and the retailer his shop, but on the one
  hand it can insist upon certain standards of quality, wholesomeness and
  cheapness, and on the other upon certain standards of cultivation. The great
  advantage of the quasi-public big business is that the profit the State
  partner seeks is not a dividend but the public welfare. It can afford to buy
  even at a loss a crop which is socially beneficial, it can afford to sell
  even at a loss a product which is wholesome or socially stimulating. Its true
  profit is a highly cultivated country and a well-fed, energetic population.
  Big business, and particularly State business, means wide views and distant
  ends, and they are attainable in no other way.</p>

  <p>THE USE OF A TARIFF</p>

  <p>The use of a tariff in regulating international trade relations is
  entirely consonant with the general trend of modern thought. When Socialism
  spent her declining years rejoicing over the grave of laissez faire, the
  kindred superstition of Free Trade, the superstition that all goes well with
  a land if only you leave imports alone, lay waiting to join its parent in
  that grave. But there is also a danger&mdash;and nowadays it is the great
  danger&mdash;of becoming just as blindly superstitious about a tariff.</p>

  <p>A tariff is perhaps a necessary part of any national economic scheme, but
  it is not in itself an economic scheme. Nevertheless there does seem to be a
  superstition in some quarters that if only the price of a commodity which it
  is desirable to produce in this country is driven up and its importation
  checked by a tariff, that commodity will necessarily be produced adequately
  and sufficiently in this country. This, at best, would be a lazy-tongs way of
  doing things, but also it is the wrong way. It does not exclude the
  possibility of a permanent scarcity of the desired product, of an economic
  hold-up, and of large private fortunes being made at the public expense. A
  tariff, we must bear in mind, varies in public value with the economic
  constitution of the State it protects. In an individualistic State of
  uncontrolled and irresponsible businesses it becomes very easily a means of
  looting the general public and impoverishing the country. The really
  formidable opponents of tariff projects are shrewd men acquainted with human
  nature, and quite free from any superstitions about the automatic blessedness
  of everything under free trade. But they will not have the faintest
  toleration for any tariff that, for example, will tend in their opinion to
  make farmers lazily fat and send up the landowners' rents in a time when it
  is the bounden duty of everyone to be lean and active. The country will not
  stand a merely protective tariff in foodstuffs, or in any commodity.</p>

  <p>A BONUS FOR FARMERS</p>

  <p>Considerations of this sort have recently produced from one ex-Fabian
  Socialist, Sir Leo Chiozza Money, a scheme that is, to say the least of it,
  of very considerable interest. It proposes that, roughly speaking, the State,
  by co-ordinating the present wholesalers and distributing agencies, should
  buy all the food in the country and hand it out to the retailers. It would
  buy first the national produce, and this it would buy with a view to
  developing the highest and most beneficial forms of cultivation. It would
  then supplement this supply by buying through the Colonial Governments and
  importing the surplus colonial output. Finally it would, if necessary,
  complete its needs by buying in the cheapest foreign market. It would of
  course buy at three price levels, and it would in effect subsidise the home
  grower, who would have as his encouragement not a protective tariff but a
  bonus price. And the cost of this encouragement would fall not upon the
  poorer sort of consumer, as a tariff would do, but upon the general
  community, which would be profiting by the security and prosperity of
  agriculture and by the increased national safety to which a well-maintained
  agriculture conduces.</p>

  <p>The reaction upon the life and quality of the farmer, although it would be
  neither revolutionary nor in any way violent, would nevertheless be very
  considerable. With the State as his buyer he would no longer be under any
  necessity to dodder into the market-town with his bits of produce on a
  market-day and pick up scraps of scientific farming amidst the quizzing of
  the farmers' ordinary. It is the privilege of the customer to call the tune
  of the seller, and the State buyer would also be the State Department of
  Agriculture; the Department of Agriculture, in concert with existing buyers
  and wholesale distributors, would not only be buying the national produce, it
  would be conducting the teaching of agricultural science, it would be
  maintaining experimental farms and agricultural research, it would be
  controlling the systematic improvement of breed and seed, and working with
  the syndicated national chemical industries for the supply of fertilisers.
  And the farmer would no longer be unable to take up the new better methods
  because of the smallness of his scale and the shortness of his views, or free
  to hump his back and declare that what was good enough for his father was
  good enough for him. The State buyer would be in a position to indicate, and
  to indicate with a certain authority, the best seeds, the best breeds, the
  preferable methods. He would have an eye, too, to the welfare of the farmer's
  hands, and some power to object to such obsolete and wasteful methods as
  contrive to muddle along at the grave social cost of underpaid labour. He
  would be in a position to press the too individualistic farmer towards a
  co-operative use of machinery, of dairies, and such-like plant.</p>

  <p>SYNDICATION WITHOUT CONFISCATION</p>

  <p>So in the matter of the land, just as in the matter of industrial
  production which was discussed in our first chapter, the alternative to the
  development of grave social stresses as the outcome of the war&mdash;stresses
  that may easily develop upon a quite catastrophic scale&mdash;seems to lie
  along the line of the syndication and nationalization of existing public
  services. This does not necessarily involve the transfer of control to public
  officials but rather the conversion of the existing direction to the national
  service. It recognizes, organizes, and renders more responsible and efficient
  a state of affairs that the wholesale and distributive syndications of the
  last few decades have already partially and informally brought about. Without
  confiscation, revolution, or personal hardship, it opens the way to a state
  of affairs when all the land of Britain will be administered as if it were
  one great estate for the general national benefit.</p>

  <p>And the attention of those who are agitating for extensive reforms in our
  education is particularly drawn to the way in which the development of a
  great system of scientific study and teaching follows almost necessarily upon
  such a national organization of agricultural production as a part of its
  development. Scientific education on the biological side becomes no longer an
  educational blind alley, a protesting ineffectiveness; it leads straight to
  appointments, influence, and usefulness. It is a point that we believe to be
  of extreme importance, and one that seems to be overlooked entirely in the
  current discussion of educational reform, it is a point that a study of the
  history of scientific and technical development in Germany will completely
  endorse, that economic reconstruction must if anything precede, and certainly
  must accompany, any large development of scientific and technical
  teaching.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="art3"
     name="art3">III. &mdash; THE LONG VIEW AND LABOUR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN no relationship, not even in relationship to the
  inevitable hostile competition of Central Europe, does the making of a
  national plan for the reconstruction of our economic life upon bigger and
  less individualistic lines become so suddenly urgent as it does in relation
  to the possibilities of acute labour trouble after the war. The very great
  sense and understanding of the labour masses have consented to a general
  truce in labour disputes during this vital conflict. There have been breaches
  of the truce, it is true, but always with very colourable justification or
  through peculiar instigation, and I think there are few of those who have
  watched the labour situation during the last quarter-century who will not
  agree that the general willingness and loyalty of our workers under the test
  of war have been remarkable and of the most hopeful augury for the future of
  the Empire. It will be nothing less than shameful on the part of those who
  rule us and of those who control our industrial life if they are unprepared
  to meet the men at the peace with something better than a resumption of the
  pitiful old struggles. And just as it has been maintained in two previous
  chapters that the key to a successful scientific competition with Germany and
  the key to a proper development of the home food supply lie alike in
  comprehensive amalgamations and syndications into which the, State enters as
  a controlling partner, so now it will be argued that the key of escape from a
  chaotic and disastrous series of labour conflicts lies in the same
  process.</p>

  <p>Every age expresses itself in transitory oppositions which it believes to
  be permanent, and the thought of every age is hampered by the oppositions of
  its predecessor. We talk and write too much as if we were still in the
  extremely individualistic world of Herbert Spencer and the Manchester School;
  as though every man were to be assigned either to the class of capital or the
  class of labour, as though capital were a system of freely competitive
  employers working for profit and labour a system of freely competitive
  workers struggling for a living just above the margin of existence, and as
  though the State were nothing but a restraining influence upon the massacre
  that would otherwise naturally ensue. With the whole nation unified as it has
  never been before in the most honourable struggle in its history there are
  yet people who can still imagine that such base chaotic scramblings are the
  continuing conditions of civil life. But, indeed, such conditions are as dead
  and done with as slavery&mdash;or Harriet Martineau. Unhappily they have left
  abundant traces upon the relations of employer and employed, and, in
  particular, upon the ideas and traditions of labour, a legacy that may yet
  greatly embarrass the development of a new and better England.</p><br>

  <h3>EMPLOYERS AND TRADE UNIONS</h3>

  <p class="first">Nearly all the mixed peoples of the British Isles are
  generous-spirited and good-humoured people, but it is idle to approach the
  question of labour without recognizing the distortions of resentment,
  suspicion, and unwillingness that have been left upon our naturally genial,
  popular mind by the experiences of the Selfish Age, the age of the
  medium-sized competing businesses, in economic development. The workers,
  faced by employers who were obsessed by the idea of getting as much work for
  as little money as possible, and who were indeed, because of the scale of
  their businesses, unable to take the long views that can disregard immediate
  losses or advantages, developed a quite ferocious resolution to give as
  little work for as much money as possible. Neither side was thinking of the
  community or the future, because the conditions were too close, because the
  business was on too small a scale to admit of that. The trade unions grew up,
  we have to remember, as the organization of a resistance to near-sighted
  exactions; their primary purpose was the protection of human life from an
  irrational and destructive pressure, and that primary purpose has left its
  form upon trade unionism to this day. The original trade unions, to put it
  bluntly, aimed at shirking. They were indeed perfectly justified in aiming at
  shirking, at less work and more pay, in the presence of an industrialism that
  aimed only at private profit, at more work for less pay, and that canted
  about 'liberty' whenever it was reminded of the most elementary duties
  towards housing, education, sanitation, and the national and Imperial future.
  And it is merely foolish for people nowadays to set up an outcry at the
  restrictive and obstructive traditions of trade unionism and to expect these
  highly defensive organizations of the less educated to leap forward
  open-handed to greet the slowly formed and still very imperfect realizations
  of public duty on the part of the owning and employing classes. It is
  scarcely less just to blame the employers for sweating to get profits. Both
  sides were demoralized by the old conditions. Both sides are still
  imperfectly adapted to the new possibilities and necessities. Neither has
  much right to call the other side shortsighted and narrow. They have to go to
  school together if the Empire is to be saved. It is hopeless for anyone to
  discuss the future of labour in Great Britain who does not bear continually
  in mind this legacy of lurking suspicion. It is a vital part of this problem
  that whatever is not done openly now, whatever is not clearly and fully
  explained now so that most workmen and most employers understand it, will be
  misinterpreted and blocked by popular distrust. Economic reconstruction must
  be a general act. It is an idle dream, and all too prevalent a dream, to
  suppose that any great economic reorganization can be brought about by quiet
  meetings of bankers and big business men and unobtrusive bargains with
  Government departments. The workers are going to be restive at any changes
  they cannot understand and watch. Whatever reorganization is attempted must
  be done in the daylight; it must be set out quite plainly in the popular
  Press, it must be forced upon the attention of the worker; he must be made a
  party to every step in the national process. That he can very easily be made
  a party, that indeed already there is coming in from the labour side and
  expressed in labour terms a closely kindred movement to the movement for
  quasi-nationalization that is coming from above, will be almost immediately
  pointed out.</p><br>

  <h3>THE SCALE OF BUSINESS</h3>

  <p class="first">Let us insist again upon the dominant idea that runs through
  all these letters, which is the importance of scale; in this connexion this
  takes the form of the proposition that the relation of the management of the
  business of manufacture to the worker varies in its nature as the business
  varies in its scale. The difference in scale makes a difference in kind. The
  relation of a man who employs just two men to those men, differs from the
  relation of the director of a hundred-thousand-pound business to his workers,
  and this again differs from the relation of a State trust to its workers not
  simply in scale but, because of the difference in scale, in almost every
  other conceivable respect. The last two relationships differ almost as widely
  as the act of taking a passing taxicab and the act of buying an estate. As
  the business merges in the State we pass from the question of selling hours
  of labour to the question of how to make the best use of a whole life. We
  pass from an antagonism of buyers and sellers of work to a scheme for a
  common welfare. And there come into the field of vision considerations of
  Imperial and racial benefit that are entirely beyond the range of the Selfish
  Age.</p>

  <p>The old conception of labour was well expressed by the term 'hands.' The
  employer took his hands on as he listed and paid them off when he thought
  fit. His business fluctuated widely, as small businesses must. When he didn't
  want his workers he kept them loafing about outside his gates doing nothing,
  waiting for a job. He did not lose by that very much, but the Empire did.
  Moreover, he employed them when they were still imperfectly educated and
  immature. He made what he could out of them; what they became was none of his
  concern. He did not lose by that, but the Empire did. He dropped them at the
  first sign of age, and he did not hesitate to work them so that they aged
  rapidly. He did not have to keep them when they were incapacitated, but the
  Empire did. He fought them with lock-outs and was gallant against a strike.
  The men and their families degenerated during their conflicts, but there were
  always other men to be found. He won his fight, perhaps. But we will not
  italicize again. The Empire as employer cannot afford to treat its man power
  in this fashion. The quasi-nationalized business can confer with the State
  and with organized labour and scheme a use of labour that will be at once far
  more profitable to the community and far more acceptable to the worker. For
  example, it seems to be demonstrable that much more can be got out of a man
  if he works intensely, continually, and hopefully for quite a few years than
  if he works hopelessly and unwillingly for all his life. Very few private
  employers can bargain with a man upon the lifetime scale; but the
  nationalized industry can. It can pay in that most attractive of all wages,
  security; it can guarantee a man's ultimate leisure and independence. The
  private employer cannot arrange that the worker shall remain under training
  up to 18 or 20, so increasing his ultimate efficiency; the national employer
  can. And it is in this direction of the quasi-national business that our
  urgent international position, our national welfare and the happiness of the
  people alike point. Whether we think of Imperial success, social efficiency,
  or human comfort and happiness, the conclusion is the same.</p><br>

  <h3>GUILD SOCIALISM</h3>

  <p class="first">It has already been suggested here that no movement in the
  direction of national trusts has any prospect of success if it is made a
  matter of private arrangement and secret intrigue. Such methods are not only
  contrary to the suspicious nature of a modern democracy demoralized by
  industrialism, but they disregard and waste the enormous possibilities of
  contributory assistance in an even partially educated populace. And it is in
  this connexion that more attention needs to be given by organizers and
  directors of industry to those comparatively modern developments of labour
  thought which figure as Syndicalism and Guild Socialism. These ideas are
  stirring great numbers of the younger workers, and they are receiving quite
  inadequate notice in the general Press. Our governing class, thanks to the
  facilities for a classical education existing in Great Britain, know far more
  about the ideas of the Gracchi than they do about the notions that such
  people as, for example, Mr. Cole and Mr. Mellor and the Editor of The New
  Age, are spreading industriously in the country.</p>

  <p>No doubt there is much to be said for the systematic snubbing of these
  busy propagandists. England would not be what it is if we did not snub, but
  large sections of the workers are not snubbing these people and these ideas.
  Let us by all means continue to snub them, take it out of them socially and
  so on, but let us at least see whether some use is not to be made of their
  ideas. These new ideas among the workers need not make for conflict, but they
  certainly will make for conflict if they are ignored. That is the important
  fact to grasp. These new views are apt to be couched in terms of class
  hostility and in the old aggressive and now irritating phrases of militant
  Marxism, but essentially these new views are constructive views; from the
  labour side they really present what is a reciprocal movement to the trend of
  the employer organizations towards trusts and national associations. Like all
  labour movements, they tend to disregard the practical difficulties in the
  way of a complete change of control; they do seem at times to
  contemplate&mdash;just as the older Socialists did&mdash;a revolutionary
  change of control. There is no recognition of that fundamental principle of
  statecraft upon which we have already laid stress in these papers&mdash;that
  new social classes cannot be suddenly created. But this misconception is
  bound to correct itself at the first attempt at realization, and so it has
  none of the importance some frightened magnates may be disposed to give it.
  The fact&mdash;the very valuable and cardinal fact&mdash;remains that this
  group of movements of which Guild Socialism is the most typical is rapidly
  preparing the minds of large masses of workers for industries upon a national
  scale, and making the position of the hundred-thousand-pound business even
  worse than it would otherwise be. We have to allow for prejudice and
  unreasonableness on both sides of this question. Naturally a popular movement
  will demand a new sort of democratic control, with every porter and
  ticket-clerk voting upon railway management, and naturally the railway
  directors (who will, after all, become the national directors) regard this
  proposal with quite needless horror, because both sides are obsessed by this
  idea, that with nationalization some entirely novel sort of management can be
  immediately improvised. If only the business organizer could be induced to
  see what a pious aspiration is the democratic control of the Guild Socialist,
  how apart it is from the rest of the question, and how inevitable is the
  continuation of the existing control into the new conditions, he would
  perhaps be readier with help and a welcome for what is really a most valuable
  educational movement. He is in practice, if he would only realize it, as
  irremovable as&mdash;Mr. Asquith.</p>

  <p>Gifted literary men have been obliging us recently with picturesque
  speculations upon the profound psychological changes that are going on in the
  New Armies. We must not be too ready.to recoil from their highly imaginative
  assurances to the opposite extreme of supposing that the ten millions or so
  of people who have been engaged either in Army or Navy or upon some special
  war-time work have not got a very much clearer idea of the possibility of
  great national businesses and a much stronger disposition to prefer direct
  public service to work under individualist control. With every desire to be
  unimaginative, one feels the probability of such a change in the general
  mind. It is a change altogether upon the lines we have been laying down.
  Opportunity, current thought, and the new disposition of great multitudes of
  people march with our Imperial necessities.</p>

  <p>In our two preceding chapters it was sought to show that the essential of
  a plan of national reconstruction must be the reorganization of business and
  agriculture upon the lines of national trusts. The thesis of this chapter is
  that it is possible, desirable, and necessary to change the life of labour
  concurrently with this process of industrial nationalization, and to replace
  the chancy, insecure, distressing, discouraging, and publicly wasteful method
  of employment on a basis of weekly and even hourly wages by much longer and
  fairer forms of engagement. This is a change that can only be effected with
  the consent and concurrence of labour, organized or unorganized. The national
  plan must be a public plan&mdash;no Peace Book hidden away in Westminster and
  jealously guarded from the curiosity of 'outsiders' will serve; the broad
  ideas of any effective national plan need to be canvassed in the popular
  Press; the mind of the New Labour needs to be cultivated and has to be
  respected. Syndication upon a national scale, and with extreme publicity and
  public participation&mdash;such, it is submitted, are the lines, and the only
  possible lines, upon which we must go if our Empire is to wax and not wane in
  the new era that this war begins.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="art4"
     name="art4">IV. &mdash; PROBLEMS OF POLITICAL ADAPTATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN our three preceding chapters it has been propounded that
  the ruling idea to adopt in our national policy, the idea about which the
  rest of our policy can be built as a body is built upon a backbone, is the
  idea of national syndication, the idea of grouping and amalgamating our
  industries, our food supply and our labour organization, upon a national
  scale; that only upon those lines can we hope to make our industries
  scientific and progressive, defeat foreign competition, secure a satisfactory
  home food supply, and come to an understanding and keep the peace with
  labour, and that the alternative to such a reconstruction boldly and openly
  planned and carried through is decadence and Imperial disintegration. We have
  now, if our plan is to be a complete one, to go on to the consideration of a
  much more subtle and intricate matter, the legislative and administrative
  changes that are needed for the effective carrying out of this
  reconstruction. We ask&mdash;with a negative answer in our
  tones&mdash;whether the existing machinery is equal to the task. If it is
  not, we ask, then wherein does it fail? What are the minimum changes and the
  least disturbing methods of change necessary to clear the way to these vital
  economic developments?</p><br>

  <h3>WANT OF CLEAR THINKING</h3>

  <p class="first">It is the purpose of these chapters to be plain and
  elementary, to put what we believe to be the stark essentials of a hopeful
  scheme of reconstruction, of what the writers believe to be the only possible
  scheme of reconstruction, with the utmost bareness and simplicity. We believe
  that there is at present a dangerous want of clear general thinking upon the
  national outlook and a dangerous disposition to undertake piecemeal changes
  without any comprehensive vision. We believe that this is one problem, and
  not to be dealt with miscellaneously. The misconception is still too
  prevalent that it is 'practical' to work with one's nose right up close to
  this question or that, and 'theoretical' and useless to get a little way off
  and look at what we are doing.</p>

  <p>In no relation is this small-business method of feeling about things
  rather than of thinking about things, of making our estimates with the point
  of the nose, so to speak, instead of the cerebral hemispheres, more evident
  and more evidently mischievous than in relation to projected legislative
  developments. These have to be envisaged largely, we passionately believe, or
  patched disastrously. It is evident that our Legislature and Administration
  work slowly, lack initiative, are not really in touch with the mind of the
  community, and so keep the community in a fever of unrest. The Press and
  public discussion are full of complaints, instances of failure, accusation of
  lost opportunity and shirked responsibility. But they are confused and
  incoherent complaints, they do not seem to produce any real working project
  for political reconstruction, they are almost as unhelpful to the forming of
  a plan as the moaning of a patient is to the formation of a diagnosis. Let
  us, therefore, make an attempt here to sort out the constituents of what is
  probably in its very essence a confused and complex trouble. Let us try to
  distinguish the factors in the political tangle. It is probable, we suggest,
  that it is not one thing wrong but several distinct things wrong, things not
  very closely correlated, that makes our existing government so slow, so
  evasive, and so generally unsatisfactory&mdash;and, when we consider the task
  of reconstruction before us, so hopeless. There may be quite separable things
  wrong, and each thing wrong may demand quite separate treatment.</p>

  <p>That at least is the suggestion we are making here. That is our present
  thesis. We are going to suggest here that there is not only a complexity of
  origin but a masking of symptoms in this case.</p><br>

  <h3>THE MACHINE OF GOVERNMENT</h3>

  <p class="first">The complaint on the surface, as we hear it, is that the
  undoubted slowness and clumsiness of British government are due to the
  predominance of lawyers in politics. Gentlemen unversed in affairs give us to
  understand that government should be in the hands of men of science or
  'business-men,' regardless of the fairly obvious fact that men of science are
  most properly engaged in the advancement of science, and that the proper
  business of a business man is to mind his own business. As a matter of fact
  politics and government have always been, and will always be so long as human
  communities endure, largely in the hands of lawyers or lawyer-like persons,
  and this for no other reason than that they are matters of systematic human
  relationship, which is only another way of saying that they are matters of
  law. In an autocracy the lawyer may have to propitiate the autocrat, in a
  democracy the lawyer may have to propitiate the people, but under any form of
  government he remains the intermediary, the active agent, the minister
  between men and men. This is so obvious that this outcry against lawyers
  already changes its direction, and in the place of a simple Jack Cade-like
  proposal to be quit of them altogether we are getting analyses of the 'legal'
  type of mind, and complaints, with which we ourselves are in far more
  sympathy, that the organization, procedure and education of our legal
  profession fall short of modern needs, are still essentially Gothic and
  mediaeval. We are, in fact, no longer asked to slaughter our lawyers, but to
  bring them up to date. The modernisation of the political lawyer is quite a
  different proposition from the abolition of the political lawyer, and apart
  from such special questions as the relation of the two branches of the
  profession to each other and the relations of the advocate to the judge,
  questions with which these papers will not deal, its discussion passes
  indistinguishably into a discussion of a general liberal education. As a part
  of that discussion we will return to it in a later paper.</p>

  <p>But our suggestion here is that whatever the present defects of the legal
  tradition and the legal training may be, they are not really the major
  reasons for our present clumsiness and unconstructiveness of government. They
  are at the utmost a minor contributory reason. We want to suggest that our
  existing governing machine is, quite apart from the percentage of lawyers in
  it, an unsuitable instrument, a misfit, a very incomplete and unsatisfactory
  adaptation to current needs of forms of government originally set up under
  conditions of communication and transit and economic production that carry us
  halfway back to the Bronze Age. We suggest that this governing machine of
  ours has hitherto always been patched up for fresh needs at the latest
  possible moment under a maximum of urgency and with a minimum of efficiency,
  and that it is possible not only to scheme out but to carry out much more
  drastic and fundamental re-arrangements. Reform Bills, Parliament Acts, Home
  Rule Bills, quieter but more effectual changes of method and relationship
  than have been, of course; the political history of the British Empire for a
  century has been very largely a history of a struggle to adjust, but it is
  still open to question whether any step has ever been taken except as a
  reluctant minimum concession to a need already flagrant. And about the
  suitability of this patched-up fabric to control the vast changes demanded in
  our immediate future it seems to us there can be hardly any doubt at
  all.</p><br>

  <h3>THE THREE ESTATES</h3>

  <p class="first">The form of the British governing machine was of course
  determined long ago by the needs and conditions of a comparatively small
  feudal monarchy, a monarchy with practically no manufactures and only a very
  trifling interest on the sea, in which there was no such thing as a town as
  big as Winchester is now; and its three tiers of King, Lords, and Commons
  still represent very fairly the three organs, as it were, of such a simple
  community, first the law and the State, secondly the landowner, the land
  administration, and thirdly the tenantry. All the references of the governing
  machine are references to practically autonomous localities&mdash;the Lords
  have chiefly territorial titles still, the members in the Commons still
  represent local interests; everything was localized, because in those days,
  apart from the Crown, there were no such things as non-local interests, such
  interests as a participating share in a railway system, a bicycle business,
  colonial trade, foreign investments, chemical industries, or book-printing,
  for example, give a man to-day. The modern State contains not three organs,
  but a great number, some of which have no representative at all in the
  government as distinctive organs, and some of which get a representation in
  disguise, as when some great railway man or some great Colonial man pretends
  to be the landlord of Thistown or Thatshire, or some energetic industrial
  organizer assures us that he represents the southern division of Cow-shire.
  None of these modern organs has a representation that has any thought-out
  proportion or relationship to that of the many other organs in our intricate
  modern State. It is only by assuming that there is a special national
  providence that we can assume that our governing apparatus can be anything
  like the best possible for the Empire; and the whole mass of our present
  discontents argues that it is not so. Upon three distinct lines, we submit,
  we can challenge these existing arrangements and point to conceivably better
  ones.</p><br>

  <h3>LOCAL REFERENCE</h3>

  <p class="first">The first of these defects of the British Parliament is this
  question of local reference. We assert that, for a large and increasing
  number of citizens in a modern State, locality has only a residential
  interest, and often even that residential interest is transitory, and that
  the major aspect of the existences of such citizens is towards some trade or
  industry or occupation of national dimensions. The real 'estates' of a modern
  community are cut up politically into kaleidoscopic fragments and distributed
  among topographical constituencies. We have on the one hand 'representatives'
  of such places as Croydon or Hampstead or Battersea, whose inhabitants have
  scarcely anything in common except a postal address, and, on the other hand,
  if we want to deal in any satisfactory way with the transport workers or
  railway servants or medical men or electrical engineers, we have to go
  outside the formal Constitution altogether and discuss matters with trade and
  professional organizations that have neither legislative nor administrative
  power, that may not represent the entire profession or industry concerned,
  that are often mere organizations for restricting work and raising wages
  without any tradition or sense of public function. Yet straight ahead of us
  is a time in which it is manifest we must either reconstruct our economic
  life on a larger scale or succumb to a better-organized State, and the only
  means at present in existence for the vast discussions and agreements between
  employer and employed that are necessary to this reconstruction are these not
  very efficient and essentially defensive labour organizations on the one
  hand, and the voluntary organizations of employers on the other; and between
  these two, to direct their cooperation and adjudicate, is this old-fashioned
  Legislature, with its obsolete reference to localities and to the social
  grades of the Feudal Age and its admitted practical ineptitude. Perhaps the
  shortest way to economic reorganization may lie in lifting most of the task
  out of the scope of the Legislature altogether, in largely increasing the
  powers and scope and responsibilities of the great labour organizations on
  the one hand, in bringing both them and the national councils of the
  employers and proprietors of the great industries into the structure of the
  Constitution, in insisting upon joint conferences and joint action, and in
  leaving Parliament little more than the power to endorse or veto the outcome
  of these joint deliberations. But this will be to set up an industrial state
  beside the feudal state. On the face of it this may seem to offer a less
  serious break with older forms and habits than an attempt to supersede or
  supplement the existing methods of Parliamentary representation by national
  occupational constituencies; but that is not our opinion. In reality we
  believe it is a far more dangerous method than to attempt a courageous reform
  of representational method.</p>

  <p>The increasing disharmony between Parliament and our urgent national
  needs, due to this persistence of local reference when the whole drift of
  things is towards broadening the interests of every citizen who matters
  beyond the limits of any localized constituency, does not by any means
  exhaust the tale of our legislative inefficiency. There is next the
  unwieldiness of both Houses, and thirdly there is that persistent tendency to
  a bilateral system of conflict about false issues which is denounced as the
  'party system.'</p>

  <p>With regard to the former point we are dealing once again with another
  instance of that blindness to the question of scale on the part of the
  British which has been the burden of all these papers. It would seem to be
  the most obvious of propositions that there must be in legislative
  assemblies, as in other bodies, a size for maximum efficiency. But it is a
  proposition extraordinarily disregarded. Above a certain optimum of size the
  numbers must become too great for attention and discussion, and the assembly
  begin to tail out towards a mob, to lose will-power and intention, and obey
  the laws of mob psychology; below it, the assembly must be insufficiently
  various and representative. Yet our House of Commons seems to have been put
  together with an entire disregard of any such possibilities, and new peer
  after new peer has been added to the House of Lords without any thought
  whatever of the mechanical effect of these additions upon the vigour of the
  whole.</p><br>

  <h3>The Party System</h3>

  <p class="first">Much graver than its unwieldiness is the persistent
  bilaterality of our Legislature. Party has turned legislation into a duel,
  and party interests and party loyalty have blinded men to the future dangers
  and opportunities of the Empire. But why has party been able to do this, and
  whence does party derive its strength? This is a question to which an answer
  exists, but it is a question very rarely answered. We read a great deal of
  rather clamorous matter in the popular Press about the abolition of the party
  system, but a careful examination of such utterances reveals no project of
  how the party system is to be abolished. A small but active section of
  journalists inspired by Mr. Sidney Low's very able criticisms (in his
  Governance of England) of our methods of government has made his views its
  own, has claimed them as its own, and used them as a basis for much aimless
  rhetoric. But no attempt whatever has been made to analyse the processes that
  have given and must give a Legislature this bilateral character. To do so
  would have been to abandon irresistible opportunities for indulgence in
  conspiracy mania. It was more romantic and attractive to present party as a
  conspiracy of the rich. A soberer inquiry into this defect, as into most
  defects of our British system, will go far to restore our faith in British
  human nature and in the remediable quality of our difficulties. The true
  source of Parliamentary bilaterality had been analysed in anticipation half a
  century ago.</p>

  <p>From the days of Hare and John Stuart Mill onward there has been a
  progressive analysis of the character and effects of voting methods, and it
  may now be taken as demonstrated that, wherever the common and obvious method
  of giving each voter in any election a single non-transferable vote is
  adopted, it follows necessarily that there can be no real decision between
  more than two candidates, and further it follows that the affairs decided by
  such voting will gravitate continually into the control of two antagonized
  party organizations. This is, of course, tame stuff compared with heady
  shoutings and accusations against plutocrats, rich Jews, privileged families,
  and party funds, but it is the simple essential of this question. Voting,
  like any other process, is subject to scientific treatment; there is one
  right method of voting which automatically destroys bilaterality, and there
  is a considerable variety of wrong methods amenable to manipulation and
  fruitful of corruption and enfeebling complications. The sane method of
  voting is known as Proportional Representation with large constituencies and
  the single transferable vote, and it is as reasonable and necessary that the
  country should adopt it as soon as possible as that it should adopt the right
  types of aeroplane and the best sorts of gun. The advantage of this method is
  not a matter of opinion, but a matter of demonstration; it needs but an hour
  or so of inquiry to convince any intelligent person of its merit and
  desirability and of the fatal and incurable mischiefs of any other method. It
  is the custom of the melodramatic school of political writers to speak of
  Proportional Representation as a 'fad': but it is no more a fad to want the
  methods of proportional representation in Parliamentary election than it is
  to want copper wire instead of ginger-beer bottle wire in an electrical
  installation, or wheaten flour instead of chaff in a loaf. With it
  Parliamentary institutions will work freely; without it they will certainly
  choke and block in any great emergency.</p>

  <p>Party manipulation and the political irrelevance due to our method of
  voting, unwieldiness due to our national disregard of the importance of
  scale, and a complete failure to shape out or present in any way the real
  conflicting interests and classes of a modern community, a failure due to the
  antiquity of the machine, these are the three categories of our Parliamentary
  failure. They are, so to speak, the mechanical defects of our government.
  They are continually preventing and perverting our national effort; they
  waste time and energy enormously, while before us now lies a period wherein
  we cannot afford to waste either time or energy, when indeed nervelessness,
  evasiveness, and dilatoriness mean the certain downfall of our Empire.</p>

  <p>The cure of these mechanical defects, we would assert, constitutes a group
  of urgencies that can be considered apart from another set of problems that
  looms far more insistently upon the public imagination. These latter are the
  problems of Imperial reorganization, of Colonial representation, for example,
  upon an Imperial Council. Pursuing our scheme of a complete review in outline
  of a possible national and Imperial policy, we shall take these up in our
  next paper. Here we would claim only to have set out and established a
  statement of defects as a preliminary to this inquiry, and to have indicated
  cause for a change in the size of Parliament and in the method of electing
  representatives.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="art5"
     name="art5">V. &mdash; AN IMPERIAL CONSTITUTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">OF the four chapters that have preceded this, the first
  three have been devoted to three aspects of the thesis that the central idea
  about which any scheme of Imperial reconstruction must be grouped is the idea
  of economic syndications upon a national or Imperial scale; that about this
  idea the agitations for scientific education and scientific method, for
  tariff defence and aggressive industrialism, the perplexities of the national
  food supply, and the rational solution of the labour problem, group
  themselves into a coherent national plan, and that they can group themselves
  hopefully in no other way. The fourth chapter took up the question of the
  sufficiency of our Imperial Legislatures for this task. That chapter was in
  the nature of a clearance of the ground; the popular attacks upon the
  predominance of lawyers and upon party government were considered and shown
  not to cover the essentials of the case. Attention was drawn to the widely
  disregarded failure of Parliament to represent adequately those great modern
  estates of the realm that have no local reference, such, for example, as the
  engineering and transit industries. It is from this point that we would now
  carry on.</p>

  <p>Our view is that these great economic syndications upon a national scale,
  which is the only possible means of saving and developing the British Empire
  against the dangers and competition that threaten it, must be settled, and
  can only be settled, with the understanding, participation, and consent of
  both labour on the one hand and the existing proprietors, directors, and
  managers concerned in these economic systems on the other. It is absurd to
  suppose any sudden and violent change of system in these things; the
  arrangements of yesterday are the only possible material we have for the
  arrangements of to-morrow. We want to see labour inspired and stimulated by
  our new sense of common needs, in conference with capital, quickened by a
  sense of extreme national danger, upon these great constructive
  projects.</p><br>

  <h3>PRESENT METHODS OF REPRESENTATION</h3>

  <p class="first">Now our case is that our Parliament as at present
  constituted is a gathering of representatives not of interests but of
  localities, and, considered as representatives, very badly elected even at
  that. It is not equal to this vast and intricate task in its present state,
  and so we have either to perform an operation upon our Parliamentary
  institutions far more drastic than any previous Reform Bill, or to
  contemplate a still more novel possibility in the appearance of, so to speak,
  a collateral state, a conference of labour and capital outside Parliament,
  reconstructing the economic life of the community regardless of Parliament,
  and quite possibly developing friction with Parliament from the very
  beginning of its attempt. The possibility will be so alarming to
  conservative-minded people that they will be strongly disposed to recoil from
  either, to fall back upon the dignified passiveness of 'wait and see; it will
  last our time,' and so to leave our children to drift on to the decline and
  humiliations, the internal conflicts and national disasters of a national
  obsolescence that we, at any rate, may never live to witness. Anything, we
  submit, is better than that counsel of despair. The alternative we would
  advocate here is the bolder and more hopeful one of political reconstruction,
  of a courageous recasting of our Parliamentary institutions to meet the needs
  of the new time.</p>

  <p>And here again we would attack our problem by bringing in a whole set of
  wider problems, the problems that arise out of the manifest necessity at the
  present time first for a clearer definition of the relationship of the
  various parts of the Empire one to another, and then for the establishment of
  some permanent method of relationship that will exclude the possibility of
  war, first with our present Allies and secondly with the United States of
  America. We may find the method of beginning with the widest possible
  problem, the general problem of an Imperial constitution and an international
  peace league, makes the confusion of problems of national and colonial
  government fall into place and proportion in just the same way that the idea
  of a reconstruction of economic life by the syndication of businesses and the
  control of agriculture upon a national scale clears up the otherwise aimless
  tangle of domestic politics.</p>

  <p>Let us consider in the order of their extent the possible political bodies
  and world associations that loom upon men's imaginations at the present time.
  The widest dream of all is the dream of a League of Peace. This is a
  possibility, even a probability; it may be some sort of league that will
  include America, or it may be a league of our present Allies; but its nature
  must necessarily be one that puts it outside our present inquiry. It will
  have to be based on treaties; it will be diplomatic in its nature; its
  character will not reflect back in any structural and necessary way into the
  general political life of the constituent States. Its indirect and
  prospective consequences in the security of all its constituent States will,
  of course, be enormous, but we are writing here not of such indirect and
  ultimate consequences, but of the way in which the widest considerations must
  determine the form of the narrower problems, and from that point of view
  councils of the Allies and Leagues of Peace may be left out of this
  discussion.</p><br>

  <h3>A COUNCIL OF EMPIRE</h3>

  <p class="first">Coming now down the scale to the next synthetic idea we have
  the dream of a council of the whole Empire, the dream of a defining by some
  comprehensive constitutional law the at present extraordinarily informal
  relations of the various parts of the Empire. Everybody perceives that the
  Government of Great Britain is not really representative of the Empire it
  rules; Great Britain is remarkably in the position of a trustee minding the
  affairs of various kindred minors and of various races and communities
  temporarily incapacitated from independent sovereignty, and almost everybody
  feels that this must necessarily be a temporary arrangement and that what is
  desirable marches with what is just, when we look to a recasting of this
  complicated system of relationships in which Great Britain will no longer be
  sole director, but merely a partner in partnership with its former
  Dependencies. So far as the Dominions go that are predominantly of British
  descent, the Dominions that are pleased to be called Britains beyond the
  seas, it is quite conceivable that there may be political unifications of a
  very thorough sort, but so far as the great masses of non-British people go,
  peoples with alien racial and national traditions, the idea of assimilation
  is equally unacceptable with the idea of continuing and unending subjection.
  Ireland has taught the British the folly of rash and premature experiments in
  amalgamation, and it is clear that the future of the non-kindred parts of the
  Empire, such as Egypt or Rajputana or Bengal, lies along the line of
  education and autonomous development to the position of free and equal allies
  in one great Imperial confederation. So far as these non-British peoples are
  concerned it may be questioned whether the setting up of any common Imperial
  Council to include them is advisable. So far as they are concerned it may be
  wiser at present for the trustee to continue to administer.</p>

  <p>That does not mean an arrest of political development. It means that these
  mainly Oriental dependencies, which are now in phases of profound economic
  reconstruction and which are emerging rather rapidly from ancient and
  primitive political conditions to the possession of a Press and to a steadily
  increasing racial and national self-consciousness, have still to show their
  quality and difference under modern conditions, have still to shape. They may
  presently be plainly developing on lines so similar to the lines in the
  development of our own community that our sons may be able to take up the
  question of an equal and parallel share in a common Empire with some
  confidence; or they may display so essential and incurable a divergence that
  the problem may have become manifestly the problem of an alliance of
  dissimilars. We know too little to foretell which of these directions will be
  taken, and meanwhile we submit that the general policy of the Imperial
  Government is to keep things going, to release every tendency that does not
  threaten the safety of the Empire, to give the native every chance and every
  opportunity that is not plainly mischievous, to encourage experiment as much
  as possible and to direct it as little as possible, and in and out of season
  steadily, persistently, to set up and maintain in the minds of ruling race
  and subject race alike this idea of the trustee, the idea of 'when you are
  ready to take it back your land is yours.' Upon which lines of thought it is
  clear that the idea of a council representative of the whole Empire recedes
  also from our problem.</p><br>

  <h3>AN IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT</h3>

  <p class="first">That leads us to the next stage down the scale, to the idea
  of an Imperial Government which, while still acting as a trustee for the
  non-kindred races and nations under the Imperial Crown, will be no longer
  merely representative of Great Britain, but of what Mr. Hughes has accustomed
  us to speak of as the Britains. We would suggest that this is a practicable
  proposition, and that the general form and composition of this new Imperial
  Parliament can be indicated. We believe that the development of the present
  British Parliament into an Imperial Parliament with oversea representatives,
  together with the relegation of purely English, Welsh, Scotch, Irish, and
  Ulster concerns to subordinate assemblies, involves the solution of endless
  squabbles between Celt and Saxon, and is the next necessary step towards a
  secure and efficient Empire.</p>

  <p>First we would point out that there are a number of functions that would
  be far better performed by such a broader-based Parliament. The first of
  these is the support and maintenance of the Navy and naval establishments and
  fortifications throughout the Empire. The second is the control of the
  Expeditionary Army and the maintenance of a skeleton military establishment
  for the Empire by which the national service militias that must certainly
  follow this war could be gunned, mobilised, and directed in an Imperial
  crisis. The third is the Imperial control of the food supply and of the
  Imperial resources of raw material. The fourth is Imperial transit, posts,
  money, standards, ports, and seaways. The fifth is the common Imperial trade
  policy. The sixth is the supreme direction of education, not with any power
  of prohibition, but with unlimited powers of endowment, to maintain the
  common language and the supply of higher education universally throughout the
  Empire. The seventh is the maintenance of the Supreme Court of the Empire.
  The eighth is the control of foreign policy and the continuation of the
  Imperial trusteeship over the non-represented Dependencies. Such, roughly,
  are the functions which an Imperial Parliament could discharge, and could
  manifestly discharge more conveniently and with a broader basis of support
  than our present British Parliament.</p>

  <p>In setting it up there would be ample opportunity of remedying the
  manifest defects of the existing Legislature, of pruning its numbers,
  replacing the bilateral vote by the proper method of voting, and making it
  really representative of the estates of a modern community. And we suggest
  that this can be done without the destruction of the outward form of the
  existing British Parliament, and indeed without any very dramatic breach of
  continuity.</p><br>

  <h3>LORDS AND COMMONS</h3>

  <p class="first">It has already been pointed out that the opposition of Lords
  and Commons in the British Parliament represents nothing but the factors of
  landlord and tenant in the originally agricultural British nation. The main
  factors of a modern State are not there; the main factors of a modern State
  are first Direction and secondly Democracy or Labour. The main function of a
  modern Legislature is the conference and co-operation of these two powers.
  The essential necessity in the process of conversion which has been
  blundering and struggling along in British political affairs for the last
  ninety years has been the conversion of the House of Lords into a House of
  Directors and of the House of Commons into a representative Democratic
  assembly, but so far as the former goes it is a valid complaint that the
  landlords do still remain disproportionally represented, while a considerable
  amount of Direction has been forced into the Lower House; and so far as the
  latter goes, that the retention of localized constituencies has masked the
  proper representation of labour and forced it into irregular and collateral
  forms of expression through irresponsible or inadequately responsible Trade
  Unions. The manifest common sense of our present necessities is to complete
  this hitherto blind and confused effort of our Parliament to adapt itself to
  modern conditions along lines that the industry of a considerable number of
  ingenious writers has already made fairly plain and continuous.</p>

  <p>The modernisation of the House of Lords that these speculations have
  worked out does not present itself as a very terrible or revolutionary
  process. The essential idea in most of these suggestions is to extend the
  method of representative peers, already used in the case of the Irish and
  Scotch peerage, to the entire peerage. All the peers now either sitting in or
  voting for representatives in the House of Lords will become, it is proposed,
  members of a new body of electors, to whom will be added a considerable
  number&mdash;some thousands, certainly&mdash;of leading men, directors of
  great businesses and public services, men of science and learning, lawyers,
  administrators, soldiers, admirals, and so on, all the people who ought to be
  placed or whom it is advisable to place upon the honours lists. Whether these
  electors will bear titles or not does not matter here. But they will be
  classified by functions; there will be a faculty of transit, for example, a
  military faculty, a faculty of literature and education, and so on, and each
  faculty will elect its quota of representatives to sit beside the law lords
  in the Imperial Upper House. In this way, it is pointed out, with the minimum
  of revolutionary disturbance, we can get a modernized House of Lords. This is
  clearly no mere Utopian project. It is quite a workable and practical method
  for the rearrangement, for the simplification and clearer responsibility of
  those unco-ordinated persons who already 'exist' as our directors and
  leaders; it is the minimum change needed to give an efficient Upper
  House.</p><br>

  <h3>OCCUPATIONAL CONSTITUENCIES</h3>

  <p class="first">And for the Lower House, if we want to get a clear statement
  from and a clear understanding with the mass of the people, if an Imperial
  plan is ever to be made plain and acceptable, it is equally evident that we
  must be prepared for a rearrangement of our population for the purposes of
  Parliamentary elections into national occupational constituencies, so that
  instead of labour being partially and imperfectly represented by men
  subsidized by levies made upon more or less representative Trade Unions and
  Socialistic societies, and sitting ostensibly as members for Hanley or
  Halifax or Blackburn, we shall have groups of members directly representing
  Scotch Minerals or Australian Transport or British Textiles or the Army and
  Navy. Instead of a crowd of vague and amateurish legislators representing
  with a conscientious unmeaningness unmeaning areas, we shall have men
  representing certain national functions intensely, and just as a diagram of
  the circulation or the nervous system or the muscles shapes out the whole
  body, so these men through their special wide interest will shape out the
  whole nation and the Empire. In both Houses we shall gain enormously in
  sincerity, directness of method and authority. We shall have the real living
  interests of the country in direct touch with legislative and organizing
  power, and the vast series of misunderstandings upon falsely conceived issues
  and all the passion, social conflict, disorder, and delay that are otherwise
  inevitable in the time of great reconstruction ahead will be cut out. We
  shall no longer have labour represented often by mere mischief-makers,
  maintained and returned to Parliament in the queerest ways, boasting that
  they are 'rebels,' and conceiving their highest purpose as the obstruction
  and annoyance of the national administration. We shall, instead, get men as
  keen as the masters for effective national action. With such a reconstructed
  Legislature, we submit, our Empire will reconstruct with swiftness and
  vigour, and stand renewed. In no other way, we are persuaded, can great
  social stresses be avoided. This, then, is the right way for the country, the
  proper national plan for efficiency, the plan that all reasonable men must
  combine to see that the nation understand and approve it. We have small doubt
  that this is the right way, and that the need to take it is urgent. The days
  of leisure have passed. There is the right way now before the British Empire,
  or there is destruction. 'The world will not wait for the English 'another
  score of years.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="art6"
     name="art6">VI. &mdash; HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE EMPIRE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AND now, having drawn in a rough but nearly complete outline
  the nature of the task of reconstruction that we conceive to lie before the
  British people, we return to the question from which we set out, the question
  of a better education.</p>

  <p>Throughout these papers we have not so much argued as taken for granted
  that no modern State may hope to achieve any effective reconstruction or
  remain at any satisfactory level of organization without the assent and
  understanding of most of its people. This has been fully recognized and
  attended to in this first great attempt at national organization that has so
  startled the world by its power and efficiency&mdash;the German Empire. In
  this new phase of high organization, upon which Germany has been the first to
  enter, and into which the rest of the world is now passing, there must exist
  something more than unavoidable interests and coercions, there must be a
  closer nexus than that to hold man to man in the common effort; and just as
  far as these will-destroying links are superseded by understandings and
  willing participations, just so far does the national efficiency cease to be
  mechanical and become a living reality. This education, this plain
  explanation of the State and of the intentions of the State to the common
  citizen, was necessary in the pioneer experiment of Germany; it is far more
  necessary to the coming developments of the Allied League and the British
  Imperial system. Our British peoples in particular are all more intractable
  under education than the Germans and far more suspicious and difficult, but
  once their reluctant confidence is gained they are probably much more
  generous and helpful. Our economic and political organization will be futile
  if it does not carry with it an organization of our at present aimless and
  confused national intelligence. Quite apart from that technical education
  which is necessary for the economic efficiency of the citizen, there has to
  be an education of the national mind in general ideas. That is the mental
  side of these material developments. To think of changes in factory and
  Legislature without thinking of changes in school and Press is like thinking
  of going for a walk with one's left leg only, leaving the right at
  home.</p><br>

  <h3>THE TWO ASPECTS OF EDUCATION</h3>

  <p class="first">Since our aim in these papers is to be severely elementary,
  to establish a very plain, firm outline of reconstructive policy, we will
  make no apology for insisting upon the all too frequently disregarded
  distinction of these two aspects of education, the technical and the liberal.
  Upon the former we do not propose to write further here. We believe that in
  the last decades there has already been set up an admirable and hopeful
  system of scientific and technical research and education in Great Britain,
  that requires little more than the stimulation, correlation, generous
  enlargement and greatly increased endowment that national economic
  syndication will give it, to meet the needs of the Empire fully. We will add
  nothing to the many things that are being said at the present time about the
  usefulness and urgent need of good teaching in Russian, chemistry, economic
  botany, or the like.</p>

  <p>These things will come naturally and in the way of business in a
  syndicating State, and they will come sufficiently in no other way. They are,
  therefore, questions of detail, very important detail no doubt, but detail,
  and our purpose in these letters is to avoid detail and to keep our outline
  clear. It is upon the other side of education, the liberal education of the
  citizen as distinguished from training and useful accomplishments, that
  opinion seems least formed, and upon which it is more necessary to attempt
  lucidity.</p>

  <p>A series of national critics from Matthew Arnold onward have attacked the
  defects or absence of a liberal education as the fundamental weakness of the
  British system. We are, as a people, charged with inaccessibility to general
  ideas, with want of imagination, and want of that foresight which demands
  imagination; we are told we are platitudinous, confused, and
  instinctive&mdash;if it were not that we were instinctive there would be
  little grace in us. It is one of the consolations of this war that Matthew
  Arnold is no longer with us to say, at a hundred disconcerting revelations,
  in atone of irritating mockery, 'I told you so.'</p>

  <p>They say we are aimless, having nothing to hold us together for any great
  purpose, that we are a nation adrift. The last of this series of sorrowful
  rather than angry critics, Mr. Clutton-Brock, tells us in his 'The Ultimate
  Belief':&mdash;</p>

  <p>'They [the Germans] have made their country the tidiest, the most
  efficient, the most powerful in the world, and an intolerable nuisance to all
  mankind. Clearly, then, their notion of goodness is not our notion; but we
  need to know what our notion is if we are to keep our minds free from the
  contagion of theirs. And we have made little effort to know what our notion
  is or to teach it to our children. We cannot teach it to them unless we know
  what it is, unless we know what we believe about the mind of man, about the
  purpose of his life, and about the nature of the universe. Without this
  knowledge our teaching must be dull and incoherent and unconvincing, and our
  children will rebel against it, as, indeed, they often do. There is in
  England a great deal of blind rebellion and wasteful reaction among the
  young.'</p>

  <p>And so on. There is no gainsaying it. It was true in the 'eighties, and it
  is still true to-day. And we need to draw together our chaotic thought and
  will into one Imperial will and understand, just as urgently as we need to
  draw together the individualistic chaos of our economic life into one
  systematic unity.</p><br>

  <h3>'THE STUPIDEST OF OPPOSITIONS'</h3>

  <p class="first">Now it is not our intention to take sides in what is
  probably the stupidest of all stupid oppositions&mdash;the opposition of
  natural science to 'the Latin and Greek classics'&mdash;as though either of
  these 'groups of subjects'&mdash;shall we call them?&mdash;constituted a
  liberal education. What all these educational critics and reformers are
  talking about is neither of these things; it is the lack of enough coherent
  philosophy, enough depth and breadth of vision, enough sense of history,
  enough curiosity or animation, in the minds of our people, and particularly
  of our ruling people. It is ridiculous to suppose that the substitution of an
  inaccurate knowledge of organic chemistry or mineralogy for an inaccurate
  knowledge of Latin and a pretence of Greek will make any change for the
  better in these respects. Compulsory elementary chemistry for the arts degree
  will be just as big a nuisance as the present compulsory smattering of Greek
  at Oxford and Cambridge. And it is quite beside the mark that the educational
  institutions of this country had made remarkable progress towards efficiency
  in the teaching of modern languages and chemistry and physics and manual
  training in the last twenty years. This may sharpen us and brighten us at
  points, but it will do nothing to unify the national will or to inspire our
  coordinated national institutions with a common understanding.</p>

  <p>What should constitute the education of the public man? This is something
  above and outside his attainments, his accomplishments, his business
  equipment, his knowledge of Russian or economic biology, or the petrol engine
  or what-not. These are secondary things. But what should make the man so that
  he will know how to rule and know how to serve? What is the backbone stuff?
  The answer to-day is surely not essentially different from the answer a Greek
  would have given in the time of Plato. He would have said nothing of the
  importance of compulsory Egyptian or Sanscrit, and equally nothing of a
  knowledge of simples or metal working. But he would have said that the
  backbone stuff must be a clear and critical knowledge of oneself in relation
  to God and to the universe. That, we submit, under modern conditions means
  for an Englishman a thorough study of philosophy and of history&mdash;not
  merely the history of England or of a part of Europe, but of the world from
  its problematical beginnings to the present, which means that he must know
  with some thoroughness the story that physical science, ethnology, and
  archaeology have to tell, as well as human history. No doubt such a general
  knowledge must be supplemented by a critical and intensive study of some
  special aspect of the world's process, by a more thorough treatment of
  history, through the classics, or through a modern history course, or through
  comparative anatomy and embryology; these are questions for the educationist;
  but that philosophy and history in some form, together with the social
  science that necessarily springs out of historical or biological teaching,
  constitute and alone can constitute the liberal education which must be the
  substance of a nation's culture seems to us scarcely to need arguing. It
  would be incredible to us, were it not obviously the fact, that anyone could
  accept the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos or the strange miscellaneousness
  demanded for a London degree or a degree course in physical science as any
  more of a liberal education than the qualification of a pharmaceutical
  chemist.</p><br>

  <h3>WHAT IS A LIBERAL EDUCATION?</h3>

  <p class="first">Now we would point out that here we are claiming very little
  more as a liberal education than what is already attempted in the Oxford
  final schools in <i>litterae humaniores</i> and modern history or in the
  Cambridge Classical Tripos Parts I. and 11. All these three comprehend
  philosophy,  history, and criticism. What we would?] put beside these
  leading courses is a biological science tripos that includes modern
  philosophy and a tripos in 'natural philosophy' that went into speculations
  upon the origin of things, and we would add to the present history school as
  alternative supplements and substitutes, syllabuses in Asiatic history,
  medieval history, the developments and varieties of Christianity, the Islamic
  story, economic history, ethnology, and archaeology. We do not believe that
  any course of study composed almost entirely of language study, or of
  mathematics, or of physics and chemistry, is to be regarded as a liberal
  education, though all these studies fall necessarily into place in one or
  other of these wider schemes. And we object altogether to the idea that
  bodies of faddists should be allowed to impose such tiresome compulsory
  futilities as mixed mathematics or botany or Greek upon a liberal education.
  Greek, Sanscrit, Russian, mathematics, botany, petrology, all must play their
  part in this or that school, but it is ridiculous to pretend that a liberal
  education is impossible without them, and that is what all these
  compulsory-subject people do pretend.</p>

  <p>We would like to repeat our conviction here that the antagonism of science
  versus the classics in education is perhaps the most mischievous and
  certainly the silliest of all confusions of issue that prevail at present. It
  is high time that this muddling and heating misrepresentation of the matter
  were laughed out of court.</p>

  <p>And having brought back into this discussion of education the distinction
  between what is technical and what is liberal, having shown that technical
  and scientific education, in its narrower sense, is really an aspect of
  economic organization, to be organized in relation to that and to be
  separated entirely in our thought from liberal education, and having laid
  bare again what everybody knows who is not confused into and lost among
  secondary questions to be the reality of a liberal education, we come to the
  question what classes in particular should have a liberal education.</p>

  <p>We submit that in a modern democratic community everybody should have a
  certain amount of liberal education quite over and above their merely
  occupational training, their French or Russian or chemistry or botany or
  mathematics or what not. Without a general liberal education we can have no
  massive national intelligence, no sense of a common purpose and adventure, no
  general willingness. Lacking this, the majority of homes in the community
  will be materialistic in the narrowest sense, unstimulating, and unproductive
  in the next generation of that sporadic ability upon which so much national
  progress has always depended and will always depend. But large sections of
  the public will necessarily have a not very deep or very critical liberal
  education, based rather on popular books and magazines and newspapers than
  upon thorough and sustained studies and thought. Where the quality of a
  nation's liberal education tells most is through those men and women whose
  specific function is in relation to the State as a whole, or in relation to
  the dealings of man and man, or in relation to the public mind; that is to
  say the politicians and lawyers, the churches and preachers, writers and
  journalists, the employers and organizers, the owners, every sort of
  determining and controlling person, the civil service and the medical
  profession, together with the women who are the wives and mothers, associates
  and counsellors of these people. These together constitute in its intenser
  form the national intelligence and the national will, and it is against these
  that the charges of Matthew Arnold and his successors have been aimed and are
  still valid.</p><br>

  <h3>FEMININE EDUCATION AND THE LAWYER MIND</h3>

  <p class="first">If one may attempt to concentrate vast clouds of criticism
  into a brief paragraph it is that the social life of those ostensibly
  educated classes who 'give' our thought and will as a State and as a
  community is wanting in coherence and vigour through the want of a really
  sound and generally prevalent liberal culture. Partly this is ascribable to a
  lamentable superficiality of feminine education in a community in which women
  take an unusually large share in political discussions, party conflicts,
  questions of appointments and the like; but much more is it due to the
  medieval organization and unsatisfactory general culture of the lawyers, who
  should be the natural medium between different types of men. The modem State
  needs politicians and lawyers who can take long views, who can think largely
  and constructively; in Great Britain our politicians and lawyers are too
  often men trained to think from hand to mouth, full of the 'shop' of court
  and legislature, and habitually resistant to ideas. They have cramped minds
  and cramping methods, and their tone is reflected in the general tone of the
  community. They bring exceptional natural abilities to bear upon obstructive,
  cautious, and delaying expedients. We cannot do without lawyers, but we
  cannot do with lawyers whose training and outlook antagonize them to large
  progressive and constructive adventures. This country can no more do with
  old-fashioned lawyers than it can do with old-fashioned business methods and
  old-fashioned guns, and so any scheme for a policy of Imperial reorganization
  must certainly fail if it does not include the vigorous promotion of liberal
  as well as technical education, and a thorough revision in the light of
  modern needs of the procedure, organization, and qualifications of the legal
  profession and all the circumstances of the politico-legal career.</p>

  <p>Social psychology is as necessary a study in the proper readjustment of a
  great Empire entering upon a new phase of economic existence as economics.
  The spirit of a profession changes with its institutions, and we have
  hitherto been regardless of the changes in the social atmosphere wrought by
  changes in the conditions under which this or that class has worked. The
  British lawyer has 'happened' just as the British civil servant and the
  British schoolmaster have 'happened,' It is time that the successors of
  Matthew Arnold put an end to mere criticisms of our national intellectual
  confusion and embarked upon that process of analysis that leads to tangible
  educational reforms. This is an infinitely more delicate and subtle task than
  economic reorganization, but it is as necessary a part of the effort that
  lies before us if our Empire is to remain united and make its full
  contribution to the rising destinies of man. Happy go lucky and wait and see
  are at an end in mental as in material things.</p>
