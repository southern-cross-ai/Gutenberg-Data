      <br>
  Vicky Van</strong></h2>
  <p>Victoria Van Allen was the name she signed to her letters and to her cheques,
    but Vicky Van, as her friends called her, was signed all over her captivating
    personality, from the top of her dainty, tossing head to the tips of her
    dainty, dancing feet.</p>
  <p>I liked her from the first, and if her &ldquo;small and earlies&rdquo; were
    said to be so called because they were timed by the small and early numerals
    on the clock dial, and if her &ldquo;little&rdquo; bridge games kept in active
    circulation a goodly share of our country&rsquo;s legal tender, those things
    are not crimes.</p>
  <p>I lived in one of the polite sections of New York City, up among the East
    Sixties, and at the insistence of my sister and aunt, who lived with me,
    our home was near enough the great boulevard to be designated by that enviable
    phrase, &ldquo;Just off Fifth Avenue.&rdquo; We were on the north side of
    the street, and, nearer to the Avenue, on the south side, was the home of
    Vicky Van.</p>
  <p>Before I knew the girl, I saw her a few times, at long intervals, on the
    steps of her house, or entering her little car, and half-consciously I noted
    her charm and her evident zest of life.</p>
  <p>Later, when a club friend offered to take me there to call, I accepted gladly,
    and as I have said, I liked her from the first.</p>
  <p>And yet, I never said much about her to my sister. I am, in a way, responsible
    for Winnie, and too, she&rsquo;s too young to go where they play Bridge for
    money. Little faddly prize bags or gift-shop novelties are her stakes.</p>
  <p>Also, Aunt Lucy, who helps me look after Win, wouldn&rsquo;t quite understand
    the atmosphere at Vicky&rsquo;s. Not exactly Bohemian&mdash;and yet, I suppose
    it did represent one compartment of that handy-box of a term. But I&rsquo;m
    going to tell you, right now, about a party I went to there, and you can
    see for yourself what Vicky Van was like.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How late you&rsquo;re going out,&rdquo; said Winnie, as I slithered
    into my topcoat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s after eleven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Little girls mustn&rsquo;t make comments on big brothers,&rdquo; I
    smiled back at her. Win was nineteen and I had attained the mature age of
    twenty-seven. We were orphans and spinster Aunt Lucy did her best to be a
    parent to us; and we got on smoothly enough, for none of us had the temperament
    that rouses friction in the home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Across the street?&rdquo; Aunt Lucy guessed, raising her aristocratic
    eyebrows a hair&rsquo;s breadth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I returned, the least bit irritated at the implication
    of that hairbreadth raise. &ldquo;Steele will be over there and I want to
    see him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This time the said eyebrows went up frankly in amusement, and the kind blue
    eyes beamed as she said, &ldquo;All right, Chet, run along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Though I was Chester Calhoun, the junior partner of the law firm of Bradbury
    and Calhoun, and held myself in due and consequent respect, I didn&rsquo;t
    mind Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s calling me Chet, or even, as she sometimes did, Chetty.
    A man puts up with those things from the women of his household. As to Winnie,
    she called me anything that came handy, from Lord Chesterton to Chessy-Cat.</p>
  <p>I patted Aunt Lucy on her soft old shoulder and Winnie on her hard young
    head, and was off.</p>
  <p>True, I did expect to see Steele at Vicky Van&rsquo;s&mdash;he was the club
    chap who had introduced me there&mdash;but as Aunt Lucy had so cleverly suspected,
    he was not my sole reason for going. A bigger reason was that I always had
    a good time there, the sort of a good time I liked.</p>
  <p>I crossed the street diagonally, in defiance of much good advice I have
    heard and read against such a proceeding. But at eleven o&rsquo;clock at
    night the traffic in those upper side streets is not sufficient to endanger
    life or limb, and I reached Vicky Van&rsquo;s house in safety.</p>
  <p>It was a very small house, and it was the one nearest to the Fifth Avenue
    corner, though the long side of the first house on that block of the Avenue
    lay between.</p>
  <p>The windows on each floor were brilliantly lighted, and I mounted the long
    flight of stone steps sure of a merry welcome and a jolly time.</p>
  <p>I was admitted by a maid whom I already knew well enough to say &ldquo;Evening,
    Julie,&rdquo; as I passed her, and in another moment, I was in the long,
    narrow living-room and was a part of the gay group there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Angel child!&rdquo; exclaimed Vicky Van herself, dancing toward me, &ldquo;did
    he come to see his little ole friend?&rdquo; and laying her two hands in
    mine for an instant, she considered me sufficiently welcomed, and danced
    off again. She was a will o&rsquo; the wisp, always tantalizing a man with
    a hope of special attention, and then flying away to another guest, only
    to treat him in the same way.</p>
  <p>I looked after her, a slim, graceful thing, vibrant with the joy of living,
    smiling in sheer gayety of heart, and pretty as a picture.</p>
  <p>Her black hair was arranged in the newest style, that covered her ears with
    soft loops and exposed the shape of her trim little head. It was banded with
    a jeweled fillet, or whatever they call those Oriental things they wear,
    and her big eyes with their long, dark lashes, her pink cheeks and curved
    scarlet lips seemed to say, &ldquo;the world owes me a living and I&rsquo;m
    going to collect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Not as a matter of financial obligation, be it understood.</p>
  <p>Vicky Van had money enough and though nothing about her home was ostentatious
    or over ornate, it was quietly and in the best of taste luxurious.</p>
  <p>But I was describing Vicky herself. Her gown, the skirt part of it, was
    a sort of mazy maize-colored thin stuff, rather short and rather full, that
    swirled as she moved, and fluttered when she danced. The bodice part, was
    of heavily gold-spangled material, and a kind of overskirt arrangement was
    a lot of long gold fringe made of beads. Instead of a yoke, there were shoulder
    straps of these same beads, and the sleeves weren&rsquo;t there.</p>
  <p>And yet, that costume was all right. Why, it was a rig I&rsquo;d be glad
    to see Winnie in, when she gets older, and if I&rsquo;ve made it sound rather&mdash;er&mdash;gay
    and festive, it&rsquo;s my bungling way of describing it, and also, because
    Vicky&rsquo;s personality would add gayety and festivity to any raiment.</p>
  <p>Her little feet wore goldy slippers, and a lot of ribbons criss-crossed
    over her ankles, and on the top of each slipper was a gilt butterfly that
    fluttered.</p>
  <p>Yet with all this bewildering effect of frivolity, the first term I&rsquo;d
    make use of in describing Vick&rsquo;s character would be Touch-me-not. I
    believe there&rsquo;s a flower called that&mdash;<em>noli me tangere</em>&mdash;or
    some such name. Well, that&rsquo;s Vicky Van. She&rsquo;d laugh and jest
    with you, and then if you said anything by way of a personal compliment or
    flirtatious foolery, she was off and away from your side, like a thistle-down
    in a summer breeze. She was a witch, a madcap, but she had her own way in
    everything, and her friends did her will without question.</p>
  <p>Her setting, too, just suited her. Her living room was one of those very
    narrow, very deep rooms so often seen in the New York side streets. It was
    done up in French gray and rose, as was the dictum of the moment. On the
    rose-brocaded walls were few pictures, but just the right ones. Gray enameled
    furniture and deep window-seats with rose-colored cushions provided resting-places,
    and soft rose-shaded lights gave a mild glow of illumination.</p>
  <p>Flowers were everywhere. Great bowls of roses, jars of pink carnations and
    occasionally a vase of pink orchids were on mantel, low bookcases or piano.
    And sometimes the odor of a cigarette or a burning pastille of Oriental fragrance,
    added to the Bohemian effect which is, oftener than not, discernible by the
    sense of smell.</p>
  <p>Vicky herself, detested perfumes or odors of any kind, save fresh flowers
    all about. Indeed, she detested Bohemianism, when it meant unconventional
    dress or manners or loud-voiced jests or songs.</p>
  <p>Her house was dainty, correct and artistic, and yet, I knew its atmosphere
    would not please my Aunt Lucy, or be just the right place for Winnie.</p>
  <p>Many of the guests I knew. Cassie Weldon was a concert singer and Ariadne
    Gale an artist of some prominence, both socially and in her art circle. Jim
    Ferris and Bailey Mason were actors of a good sort, and Bert Garrison, a
    member of one of my best clubs, was a fast rising architect. Steele hadn&rsquo;t
    come yet.</p>
  <p>Two tables of bridge were playing in the back part of the room, and in the
    rest of the rather limited space several couples were dancing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t we open the doors to the dining room, Vicky?&rdquo; called
    out one of the card players. &ldquo;The calorics of this room must be about
    ninety in the shade.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Open them a little way,&rdquo; returned Miss Van Allen. &ldquo;But
    not wide, for there&rsquo;s a surprise supper and I don&rsquo;t want you
    to see it yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They set the double doors a few inches ajar and went on with their game.
    The dining room, as I knew, was a wide room that ran all across the house
    behind both living-room and hall. It was beautifully decorated in pale green
    and silver, and often Vicky Van would have a &ldquo;surprise supper,&rdquo; at
    which the favors or entertainers would be well worth waiting for.</p>
  <p>Having greeted many whom I knew, I looked about for further speech with
    my hostess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s upstairs in the music room,&rdquo; said Cassie Weldon,
    seeing and interpreting my questing glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, lady, for those kind words,&rdquo; I called back over
    my shoulder, and went upstairs.</p>
  <p>The front room on the second floor was dubbed the &ldquo;music room,&rdquo; Vicky
    said, because there was a banjo in it. Sometimes the guests brought more
    banjos and a concert of glees and college songs would ensue. But more often,
    as to-night, it was a little haven of rest and peace from the laughter and
    jest below stairs.</p>
  <p>It was an exquisite white and gold room, and here, too, as I entered, pale
    pink shades dimmed the lights to a soft radiance that seemed like a breaking
    dawn.</p>
  <p>Vicky sat enthroned on a white divan, her feet crossed on a gold-embroidered
    white satin foot-cushion. In front of her sat three or four of her guests
    all laughing and chatting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he vowed he was going to get here somehow,&rdquo; Mrs. Reeves
    was saying.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; asked Vicky, though in a voice of little
    interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somers,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Reeves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never heard of him. Did you, Mr. Calhoun?&rdquo; and Vicky Van looked
    up at me as I entered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; Miss Van Allen. Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t care. Only as Mrs. Reeves says
    he is coming here tonight, I&rsquo;d like to know something about him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coming here! A man you don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; I drew up a chair
    to join the group. &ldquo;How can he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Steele is going to bring him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;He
    says&mdash;Norman Steele says, that Mr. Somers is a first-class all-around
    chap, and no end of fun. Says he&rsquo;s a millionaire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a millionaire more or less to me?&rdquo; laughed Vicky. &ldquo;I
    choose my friends for their lovely character, not for their wealth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ve selected all of us for that, dear,&rdquo; agreed
    Mrs. Reeves, &ldquo;but this Somers gentleman may be amiable, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Reeves was a solid, sensible sort of person, who acted as ballast for
    the volatile Vicky, and sometimes reprimanded her in a mild way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I love the child,&rdquo; she had said to me once, &ldquo;and she
    is a little brick. But once in a while I have to tell her a few things for
    the good of the community. She takes it all like an angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Vicky went on, &ldquo;Norman Steele
    has no right to bring anybody here whom he hasn&rsquo;t asked me about. If
    I don&rsquo;t like him, I shall ask some of you nice, amiable men to get
    me a long plank, and we&rsquo;ll put it out of a window, and make him walk
    it. Shall we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We all agreed to do this, or to tar and feather and ride on a rail any gentleman
    who might in any way be so unfortunate as to fall one iota short of Vicky
    Van&rsquo;s requirements.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Vicky, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll all please go
    downstairs, except Mrs. Reeves and Mr. Garrison and my own sweet self, I&rsquo;ll
    be orfly obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The sweeping gesture with which she sought to dismiss us was a wave of her
    white arms and a smile of her red lips, and I, for one, found it impossible
    to obey. I started with the rest, and then after the gay crowd were part
    way down stairs I turned back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please, mayn&rsquo;t I join your little class, if I&rsquo;ll be very
    good?&rdquo; I begged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want Bert Garrison to be left
    alone at the mercy of two such sirens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Van Allen hesitated. Her pink-tipped forefinger rested a moment on
    her curved lip. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, nodding her head. &ldquo;Yes,
    stay, Mr. Calhoun. You may be a help. Are you any good at getting theatre
    boxes after they&rsquo;re all sold?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my profession,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;I learned it
    from a correspondence school. Where&rsquo;s the theatre? Lead me to it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Metropolis Theatre,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;And
    I want to have a party there to-morrow night, and I want two boxes, and this
    awful, dreadful, bad Mr. Garrison says they&rsquo;re all sold, and I can&rsquo;t
    get any! What can you do about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll fix it. I&rsquo;ll go to the people who bought the
    boxes you want, and&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll say to them,
    exactly&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll fix up such a yarn that they&rsquo;ll beg me
    to take the boxes off their hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, will you, really?&rdquo; and the dazzling smile she gave me would
    have repaid a much greater Herculean task than I had undertaken. And, of
    course, I hadn&rsquo;t meant it, but when she thought I did, I couldn&rsquo;t
    go back on my word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best, Miss Van Allen,&rdquo; I said, seriously, &ldquo;and
    if I can&rsquo;t possibly turn the trick, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll
    buy the Metropolitan Opera House, and put on a show of my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t do that. But if
    you try and fail&mdash;why, we&rsquo;ll just have a little party here, a
    sort of consolation party, and&mdash;oh, let&rsquo;s have some private theatricals.
    Wouldn&rsquo;t that be fun!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More fun than the original program?&rdquo; I asked quickly, hoping
    to be let off my promise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;decidedly not! I want especially
    to have that theatre party and supper afterward at the Britz. Now you do
    all you can, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I promised to do all I could, and I had a partial hope I could get what
    she wanted by hook or crook, and then, as she heard a specially favorite
    fox-trot being dashed off on the piano downstairs, she sprang from her seat,
    and kicking the satin cushion aside, asked me to dance. In a moment we were
    whirling around the music room to the zipping music, and Mrs. Reeve and Garrison
    followed in our steps.</p>
  <p>Vicky danced with a natural born talent that is quite unlike anything acquired
    by lessons. I had no need to guide her, she divined my lead, and swayed in
    any direction, even as I was about to indicate it. I had never danced with
    anyone who danced so well, and I was profuse in my thanks and praise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I love it,&rdquo; she said simply, as she patted the gold fringes
    of her gown into place. &ldquo;I adore dancing, and you are one of the best
    partners I have ever had. Come, let us go down and cut into a Bridge game.
    We&rsquo;ll just about have time before supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pirouetting before me, she led the way, and we went down the long steep
    stairs.</p>
  <p>A shout greeted her appearance in the doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Vicky, we have missed you! Come over here and listen to Ted&rsquo;s
    latest old joke!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, come over here and hear this awful gossip Ariadne is telling
    for solemn truth. It&rsquo;s the very worst taradiddle she ever got off!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a place, Vicky Van, a nice cosy corner, &lsquo;tween
    Jim and me. Come on, Ladygirl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, thanks, everybody. I&rsquo;m going to cut in at this table. May
    I? Am I a nuisance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A Vicky-nuisance! They ain&rsquo;t no such animal!&rdquo; and Bailey
    Mason rose to give her his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I want you to stay, Mr. Mason. &lsquo;Cause
    why, I want to play wiz you. Cassie, you give me your place, won&rsquo;t
    you, Ducky-Daddles? and you go and flirt with Mr. Calhoun. He knows the very
    newest flirts! Go, give him a tryout.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Vicky Van settled herself into her seat with the happy little sigh of the
    bridge lover, who sits down with three good players, and in another moment
    she was breathlessly looking over her hand. &ldquo;Without,&rdquo; she said,
    triumphantly, and knowing she&rsquo;d say no word more to me for the present,
    I walked away with Cassie Weldon.</p>
  <p>And Cassie was good fun. She took me to the piano, and with the soft pedal
    down, she showed me a new little tone picture she had made up, which was
    both picturesque and funny.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go into vaudeville!&rdquo; I exclaimed, as she
    finished, &ldquo;your talent is wasted on the concert platform.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Vicky tells me,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Sometimes
    I believe I will try it, just for fun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it such fun, you&rsquo;ll stay in for earnest,&rdquo; I
    assured her, for she had shown a bit of inventive genius that I felt sure
    would make good in a little musical turn.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter2MrSomers"></a>Chapter 2 <br>
  Mr. Somers</strong></h2>
  <p>It was nearly midnight when Steele came, and with him was a man I had never
    seen before, and whom I assumed to be the Mr. Somers I had heard about.</p>
  <p>And it was. As Steele entered, he cast his eye around for Vicky, and saw
    her at the bridge table down at the end of the room. Her back was toward
    us, and she was so absorbed in the game she did not look round, if, indeed,
    she heard the noise of their arrival.</p>
  <p>The two men stopped near the group I was with and Steele introduced Mr.
    Somers.</p>
  <p>A little curiously I looked at him, and saw a large, self-satisfied looking
    man wearing an expansive smile and expensive apparel. Clothes the very best
    procurable, jewelry just inside the limits of good taste&mdash;he bore himself
    like a gentleman, yet there was an unmistakable air of ostentatious wealth
    that repelled me. A second look made me think Mr. Somers had dined either
    late or twice, but his greetings were courteous and genial and his manner
    sociable, if a little patronizing. He seemed a stranger to all present, and
    his eye roved about for the charming hostess Steele had told him of.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll reach Miss Van Allen presently.&rdquo; Steele laughed,
    in answer to the glance, &ldquo;if, indeed, we dare interrupt her game. Let&rsquo;s
    make progress slowly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No hurry,&rdquo; returned Somers, affably, beaming on Cassie Weldon
    and meeting Ariadne Gale&rsquo;s receptive smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m anchored
    here for the moment. Miss Weldon? Ah, yes, I&rsquo;ve heard you sing. Voice
    like a lark&mdash;like a lark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clearly, Somers was not much of a purveyor of small talk. I sized him up
    for a lumbering oldster, who wanted to be playful but didn&rsquo;t quite
    know how.</p>
  <p>He had rather an austere face, yet there was a gleam in his eye that belied
    the austerity. His cheeks were fat and red, his nose prominent, and he was
    clean shaven, save for a thick white mustache, that drooped slightly on either
    side of a full-lipped mouth. His hair was white, his eyes dark and deep-set,
    and he could easily be called a handsome man. He was surely fifty, and perhaps
    more. Had it not been for a certain effusiveness in his speech, I could have
    liked him, but he seemed to me to lack sincerity.</p>
  <p>However, I am not one to judge harshly or hastily, and I met him half way,
    and even helped him in his efforts at gay affability.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never been here before?&rdquo; I asked; &ldquo;Good
    old Steele to bring you to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, never before,&rdquo; and he glanced around appreciatively, &ldquo;but
    I shall, I hope, come often. Charming little nest; charming ladies!&rdquo; a
    bow included those nearest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; babbled Ariadne, &ldquo;fair women and brave
    men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brave, yes,&rdquo; agreed Somers, &ldquo;to dare the glances of such
    bright eyes. I must protect my heart!&rdquo; He clasped his fat hands pretty
    near where his heart was situated, and grinned with delight as Ariadne also &ldquo;protected&rdquo; her
    heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;two hearts in danger! I feel sure we
    shall be friends, if only because misery loves company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it really misery with you?&rdquo; and Ariadne&rsquo;s sympathy
    was so evidently profound, that Cassie Weldon and I walked away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give Ariad her innings,&rdquo; said the vivacious Miss
    Weldon, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll make up to the Somers kid later. Where&rsquo;d
    Vicky pick him up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know him at all. Norman Steele brought him unbeknownst.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! Why, Vick doesn&rsquo;t allow that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m told. Any way, Steele did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Vicky&rsquo;s such a good-natured darling, maybe she won&rsquo;t
    mind for once. She won&rsquo;t, if she likes the little stranger. He&rsquo;s
    well-meaning, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;s Ariadne. From her smile, I think she well means to sell
    him her latest &lsquo;Autumn In The Adirondacks,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Lady With
    A Handbag&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t be mean!&rdquo; but Cassie laughed. &ldquo;And I
    don&rsquo;t blame her if she does. Poor Ad paints above the heads of the
    public, so if this is a high-up Publican, she&rsquo;d better make sales while
    the sun shines.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s her work like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can see more of it in this house than anywhere else. Vicky is
    so fond of Ariadne and so sorry her pictures don&rsquo;t sell better, that
    she buys a lot herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does Miss Gale know Miss Van Allen does it out of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say charity! No, they&rsquo;re really good stuff, and
    Vicky buys &lsquo;em for Christmas gifts and bridge prizes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does she ever play for prizes? I thought she liked a bit of a stake,
    now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, at evening parties. But, often we have a dove game of an afternoon,
    with prizes and pink tea. Vicky Van isn&rsquo;t a gay doll, you know. She&rsquo;s&mdash;sometimes,
    she&rsquo;s positively domestic. I wish she had a nice husband and some little
    kiddies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give it up. She&rsquo;s never seen any man she loved, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;ll love this Somers person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid! Nothing less than a crown prince would suit Vicky
    Van. Look, she&rsquo;s turning to meet him. Won&rsquo;t he be bowled over!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I turned, and though there were several people between us, I caught a glimpse
    of Somers&rsquo; face as he was presented to Miss Van Allen. He was bowled
    over. His eyes beamed with admiration and he bowed low as he raised to his
    lips the dainty, bejeweled hand.</p>
  <p>Vicky, apparently, did not welcome this old-time greeting, and she drew
    away her hand, saying, &ldquo;not allowed. Naughty man! Express proper compunction,
    or you can&rsquo;t sit next me at supper!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; begged Somers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry! I&rsquo;ll
    never do it again&mdash;until after I sit next you at supper!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More brains than I thought,&rdquo; I said to Cassie, who nodded,
    and then Vicky Van rose from her chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take my place for a moment, Mr. Somers,&rdquo; she said, standing
    before him. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; she dropped her eyes adorably, &ldquo;I
    must see about the arrangement of seats at the supper table.&rdquo; With
    a merry laugh, she ran from the room, and through the long hall to the dining-room.</p>
  <p>Somers dropped into her vacant chair, and continued the Bridge game with
    the air of one who knows how to play.</p>
  <p>In less than five minutes Vicky was back. &ldquo;No, keep the hand,&rdquo; she
    said, as he rose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve played long enough. And supper will be
    ready shortly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Finish the rubber,&mdash;I insist&rdquo; Somers returned, and as
    he determinedly stood behind the chair, Vicky, perforce, sat down.</p>
  <p>He continued to stand behind her chair, watching her play. Vicky was too
    sure of her game to be rattled at his close scrutiny, but it seemed to me
    her shoulders shrugged a little impatiently, as he criticized or commended
    her plays.</p>
  <p>She had thrown a light scarf of gauze or tulle around when she was out of
    the room, and being the same color as her gown, it made her seem more than
    ever like an houri. She smiled up into Somers&rsquo; face, and then, coyly,
    her long lashes fell on her pink cheeks. Evidently, she had concluded to
    bewitch the newcomer, and she was making good.</p>
  <p>I drew nearer, principally because I liked to look at her. She was a live
    wire to-night! She looked roguish, and she made most brilliant plays, tossing
    down her cards with gay little gestures, and doing trick shuffles with her
    twinkling fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You could have had that last trick, if you&rsquo;d played for it,&rdquo; Somers
    said, as the rubber finished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; Vicky conceded. &ldquo;I saw, just too late, that
    I was getting the lead into the wrong hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t ever do that again,&rdquo; he said, lightly, &ldquo;never
    again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As he said the last word, he laid his finger tips on her shoulder. It was
    the veriest touch, the shoulder was swathed in the transparent tulle, but
    still, it roused Vicky. She glanced up at him, and I looked at him, too.
    But Somers was not in flirtatious mood. He said, &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; in
    most correct fashion. Had he then, touched her inadvertently? It didn&rsquo;t
    seem so, but his speech assured it.</p>
  <p>Vicky jumped up from the table, and ignoring Somers, ran out to the hall,
    saying something about looking after the surprise for the supper. To my surprise,
    Somers followed her, not hastily, but rather deliberately, and, quelling
    an absurd impulse to go, too, I turned to Norman Steele, who stood near.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this Somers?&rdquo; I asked him, rather abruptly. &ldquo;Is
    he all right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; said Steele, smiling. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a top-notcher.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In what respects?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every and all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve known him long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I tell you Cal, he&rsquo;s all right. Forget it. What&rsquo;s
    the surprise for supper? Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course not. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise if we all knew of
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Vicky&rsquo;s surprises are always great fun. Why the grouch,
    old man? Can&rsquo;t you chirrup?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; and I felt annoyed that he read in
    my face that I was put out. But I didn&rsquo;t like the looks of Somers,
    and I couldn&rsquo;t say so to the man who had brought him there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, please! Oh,&nbsp;<em>please!</em>&rdquo; shouted a hoarse, strange
    voice, and one scarcely to be heard above the hum of gay voices and peals
    of gay laughter, &ldquo;oh,&nbsp;<em>somebody</em>, please!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked across the room, and in the wide hall doorway stood a man, who
    was quite evidently a waiter. He was white-faced and staring-eyed, and he
    fairly hung on to a portiere for support, as he repeated his agonized plea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves, as everybody else stared at
    the man. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; She stepped toward him, and we all
    turned to look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not you&mdash;no, Madame. Some man, please&mdash;some doctor. Is
    there one here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some of the servants ill?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Reeves, kindly. &ldquo;Doctor
    Remson, will you come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The pleasant-faced capable-looking woman paused only until Doctor Remson
    joined her, and the two went into the hall, the waiter following slowly.</p>
  <p>In a moment I heard a shriek, a wild scream. Partly curiosity and partly
    a foreboding of harm to Vicky Van, made me rush forward.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Reeves had screamed, and I ran the length of the hall to the dining
    room. There I saw Somers on the floor, and Remson bending over him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s killed! He&rsquo;s stabbed!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Reeves,
    clutching at my arm as I reached her. &ldquo;Oh, what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stood just in the dining-room doorway, which was at the end of the long
    hall, as in most city houses. The room was but dimly lighted, the table candles
    not yet burning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep the people back!&rdquo; I shouted, as those in the living-room
    pressed out into the hall. &ldquo;Steele, keep those girls back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was an awful commotion. The men urged the women back, but curiosity
    and horror made them surge forward in irresistible force.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shut the door,&rdquo; whispered Remson. &ldquo;This man is dead.
    It&rsquo;s an awful situation. Shut that door!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Somehow, I managed to get the door closed between the dining-room and hall.
    On the inside were Remson, Mrs. Reeves, who wouldn&rsquo;t budge, and myself.
    Outside in the hall was a crowd of hysterical women and frightened men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; I asked, in a low voice, going nearer to the
    doctor and looking at Somers&rsquo; fast-glazing eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure. He was stabbed straight to the heart with&mdash;see&mdash;a
    small, sharp knife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her hands over her eyes, but peering through her fingers, Mrs. Reeves drew
    near. &ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;Oh, not really dead! Can&rsquo;t
    we do anything for him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Remson, rising to his feet, from his kneeling position. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
    dead, I tell you. Who did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That waiter&mdash;&rdquo; I began, and then stopped. Looking in from
    a door opposite the hall door, probably one that led to a butler&rsquo;s
    pantry or kitchen, were half a dozen white-faced waiters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in here,&rdquo; said Remson; &ldquo;not all of you. Which is
    chief?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am, sir,&rdquo; and a head waiter came into the room. &ldquo;What
    has happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A man has been killed,&rdquo; said the doctor, shortly. &ldquo;Who
    are you? Who are you all? House servants?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No sir,&rdquo; said the chief. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re caterer&rsquo;s
    men. From Fraschini&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m Luigi. We are here to serve supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you know of this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir,&rdquo; and the Italian looked truthful, though scared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been in and out of the dining-room all evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Setting the table, and such. But now it&rsquo;s all ready,
    and I was waiting Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s word to serve it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is Miss Van Allen?&rdquo; I broke in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; Luigi hesitated, and Doctor
    Remson interrupted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t ask these questions, Mr. Calhoun. We must call the
    police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Reeves, &ldquo;oh no! no! don&rsquo;t
    do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is my duty,&rdquo; said the doctor, firmly. &ldquo;And no one
    must enter or leave this room until an officer arrives. You waiters, stay
    there in that pantry. Close those doors to the other room, Mr. Calhoun, please.
    Mrs. Reeves, I&rsquo;m sorry, but I must ask you to stay here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; declared the lady. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
    not an officer of the law. I&rsquo;ll stay in the house, but not in this
    room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stalked out into the hall, and Doctor Remson went at once to the telephone
    and called up headquarters.</p>
  <p>The guests in the living room, hearing this, flew into a panic.</p>
  <p>Of course, it was no longer possible, nor, as I could see, desirable to
    keep them in ignorance of what had happened.</p>
  <p>After calling the police, Doctor Remson returned to his post just inside
    the dining-room door. He answered questions patiently, at first, but after
    being nearly driven crazy by the frantic women, he said, sharply, &ldquo;You
    may all do just as you like. I&rsquo;ve no authority here, except that the
    ethics of my profession dictate. That does not extend to jurisdiction over
    the guests present. But I advise you as a matter of common decency to stay
    here until this affair is investigated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But they didn&rsquo;t. Many of them hastily gathered up their wraps and
    went out of the house as quickly as possible.</p>
  <p>Cassie Weldon came to me in her distress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must go, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think
    I may? Why, it would interfere greatly with my work to have it known that
    I was mixed up in a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not mixed up in it, Miss Weldon.&rdquo; I began to speak
    a little sternly, but the look in her eyes aroused my sympathy. &ldquo;Well,
    go on,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I suppose you will testify if called on. Everybody
    knows where to find you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, slowly, &ldquo;but I hope I won&rsquo;t be
    called on. Why, it might spoil my whole career.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She slipped out of the door, in the wake of some other departing guests.
    After all, I thought, it couldn&rsquo;t matter much. Few, if any, of them
    were implicated, and they could all be found at their homes.</p>
  <p>And yet, I had a vague idea that we ought all to stay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall remain and face the music,&rdquo; I heard Mrs. Reeves saying. &ldquo;Where&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;Vicky?
    Do you suppose she knows about this? I&rsquo;m going up in the music room
    to see if she&rsquo;s there. You know, with all the excitement down here,
    those upstairs may know nothing of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall remain, too&rdquo; said Ariadne Gale. &ldquo;Why should anyone
    kill Mr. Somers? Did the caterer&rsquo;s people do it? What an awful thing!
    Will it be in the papers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<em>Will</em>&nbsp;it!&rdquo; said Garrison, who was standing near. &ldquo;Reporters
    may be here any minute. Must be here as soon as the police come. Where is
    Miss Van Allen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; and Ariadne began to cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves, gruffly, but not unkindly. &ldquo;Stay
    if you want to, Ariadne, but behave like a sensible woman, not a silly schoolgirl.
    This is an awful tragedy, of some sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean, of some sort?&rdquo; asked Miss Gale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean we don&rsquo;t know what revelations are yet to come. Where&rsquo;s
    Norman Steele? Where&rsquo;s the man who brought this Somers here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sure enough, where was Steele? I had forgotten all about him. And it was
    he who had introduced Somers to the Van Allen house, and no one else present,
    so far as I knew, was previously acquainted with the man now lying dead the
    other side of that closed door.</p>
  <p>I looked over the people who had stayed. Only a handful&mdash;perhaps half
    a dozen.</p>
  <p>And then I wondered if I&rsquo;d better go home myself. Not for my own sake,
    in any way; indeed, I preferred to remain, but I thought of Aunt Lucy and
    Win. Ought I to bring on them any shadow of trouble or opprobrium that might
    result from my presence in that house at that time? Would it not be better
    to go while I could do so? For, once the police took charge, I knew I should
    be called on to testify in public. And even as I debated with myself, the
    police arrived.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter3TheWaitersStory"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  The
    Waiter&rsquo;s
      Story</strong></h2>
  <p>Doctor Remson&rsquo;s police call had been imperative, and Inspector Mason
    came in with two men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? What&rsquo;s wrong here?&rdquo; the big burly
    inspector said, as he faced the few of us who had remained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in here, inspector,&rdquo; said the doctor, from the dining-room
    door.</p>
  <p>And from that moment the whole aspect of the house seemed to change. No
    longer a gay little bijou residence, it became a court of justice.</p>
  <p>One of the men was stationed at the street door and one at the area door
    below. Headquarters was notified of details. The coroner was summoned, and
    we were all for the moment under detention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is Miss Van Allen? Where is the lady of the house?&rdquo; asked
    Mason. &ldquo;Where are the servants? Who is in charge here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was ever a string of questions so impossible of answers!</p>
  <p>Doctor Remson told the main facts, but he was reticent. I, too, hesitated
    to say much, for the case was strange indeed.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Reeves looked gravely concerned, but said nothing.</p>
  <p>Ariadne Gale began to babble. That girl didn&rsquo;t know how to be quiet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess Miss Van Allen is upstairs,&rdquo; she volunteered. &ldquo;She
    was in the dining-room, but she isn&rsquo;t here now, so she must be upstairs.
    Shall I go and see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; thundered the inspector. &ldquo;Stay where you are. Search
    the house, Breen. I&rsquo;ll cover the street door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man he called Breen went upstairs on the jump, and Mason continued. &ldquo;Tell
    the story, one of you. Who is this man? Who killed him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As he talked, the inspector was examining Somers&rsquo; body, making rapid
    notes in a little book, keeping his eye on the door, and darting quick glances
    at each of us, as he tried to grasp the situation.</p>
  <p>I looked at Bert Garrison, who was perhaps the most favored of Miss Van
    Allen&rsquo;s friends, but he shook his head, so I threw myself into the
    breach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inspector,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that man&rsquo;s name is Somers.
    Further than that I know nothing. He is a stranger to all of us, and he came
    to this house to-night for the first time in his life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d he happen to come? Friend of Miss Van Allen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He met her to-night for the first time. He came here with&mdash;&rdquo; I
    paused. It was so hard to know what to do. Steele had gone home, ought I
    to implicate him?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on&mdash;came here with whom? The truth, now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I usually speak the truth&rdquo; I returned, shortly. &ldquo;He came
    with Mr. Norman Steele.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. Steele?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has gone. There were a great many people here, and, naturally,
    some of them went away when this tragedy was discovered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph! Then, of course, the guilty party escaped. But we are getting
    nowhere. Does nobody know anything of this man, but his name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nobody did; but Ariadne piped up, &ldquo;He was a delightful man. He told
    me he was a great patron of art, and often bought pictures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paying little heed to her, the inspector was endeavoring to learn from the
    dead man&rsquo;s property something more about him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No letters or papers,&rdquo; he said, disappointedly, as he turned
    out the pockets. &ldquo;Not unusual&mdash;in evening togs&mdash;but not even
    a card or anything personal&mdash;looks queer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look in his watch,&rdquo; said Ariadne, bridling with importance.</p>
  <p>Giving her a keen glance, the inspector followed her suggestion. In the
    back of the case was a picture of a coquettish face, undoubtedly that of
    an actress. It was not carefully fastened in, but roughly cut out and pressed
    in with ragged edges.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Temporary,&rdquo; grunted the inspector, &ldquo;and recently stuck
    in. Some chicken he took out to supper. He&rsquo;s a club man, you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Steele said so, and also vouched for his worth and character.&rdquo; I
    resented the inspector&rsquo;s attitude. Though I knew nothing of Somers,
    and didn&rsquo;t altogether like him, yet, I saw no reason to think ill of
    the dead, until circumstances warranted it.</p>
  <p>Further search brought a thick roll of money, some loose silver, a key-ring
    with seven or eight keys, eyeglasses in a silver case, handkerchiefs, a gold
    pencil, a knife, and such trifles as any man might have in his pockets, but
    no directly identifying piece of property.</p>
  <p>R. S. was embroidered in tiny white letters on the handkerchiefs, and a
    monogram R. S. was on his seal ring.</p>
  <p>His jewelry, which was costly, the inspector did not touch. There were magnificent
    pearl studs, a watch fob, set with a black opal and pearl cufflinks. Examination
    of his hat showed the pierced letters R. S., but nothing gave clue to his
    Christian name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somers,&rdquo; said the inspector, musingly. &ldquo;What club does
    he belong to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Mr. Steele belongs to
    several, but Mr. Somers does not belong to any that I do. At least, I&rsquo;ve
    never seen him at any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call in the servants. Let&rsquo;s find out something about this household.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As no one else moved to do it, I stepped to the door of the butler&rsquo;s
    pantry, and summoned the head waiter of the caterer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are the house servants?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any, sir,&rdquo; he replied, looking shudderingly
    at the grisly form on the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No servants? In a house of this type! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves, breaking her silence,
    at last. &ldquo;Miss Van Allen has a very capable woman, who is housekeeper
    and ladies&rsquo; maid in one. But when guests are here, the suppers are
    served from the caterer&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then call the housekeeper. And where is Miss Van Allen herself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not in the house,&rdquo; said the policeman Breen, returning
    from his search.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not in the house!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been all over&mdash;every room&mdash;every floor. She
    isn&rsquo;t in the house. There&rsquo;s nobody upstairs at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No housekeeper or maid?&rdquo; demanded Mason. &ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ve
    got away! Here, waiter, tell me all you know of this thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Italian Luigi came forward, shaking with terror, and wringing his fingers
    nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I d&mdash;don&rsquo;t know anything about it,&rdquo; he began, but
    Mason interrupted, &ldquo;You do! You know all about it! Did you kill this
    man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! Dio mio! No! a thousand no&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, unless you wish to be suspected of it, tell all you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A commotion at the door heralded the coroner&rsquo;s arrival, also a detective
    and a couple of plain clothes men. Clearly, here was a mysterious case.</p>
  <p>The coroner at once took matters in his own hands. Inspector Mason told
    him all that had been learned so far, and though Coroner Fenn seemed to think
    matters had been pretty well bungled, he made no comment and proceeded with
    the inquiries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure there&rsquo;s nobody upstairs?&rdquo; he asked Breen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Positive. I looked in every nook and cranny. I&rsquo;ve raked the
    whole house, but the basement and kitchen part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go down there, then, and then go back and search upstairs again.
    Somebody may be hiding. Who here knows Miss Van Allen the most intimately?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps I do,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;Or Miss Gale. We are
    both her warm friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m also her friend,&rdquo; volunteered Bert Garrison. &ldquo;And
    I can guarantee that if Miss Van Allen has fled from this house it was out
    of sheer fright. She never saw this man until to-night. He was a stranger
    to us all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the housekeeper?&rdquo; went on Fenn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think she must be somewhere about,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;Perhaps
    in the kitchen. Julie is an all round capable woman. When there are no guests
    she prepares Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s meals herself. When company is present
    the caterer always is employed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And there are no other servants?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not permanent ones,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;I believe
    the laundress and chore boy come by the day, also cleaning women and such.
    But I know that Miss Van Allen has no resident servant besides the maid Julie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This woman must be found,&rdquo; snapped the coroner. &ldquo;But
    we must first of all identify the body. Mason, call up the principal clubs
    on the telephone, and locate R. Somers. Also find Mr. Norman Steele. Now,
    Luigi, let&rsquo;s have your story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The trembling waiter stammered incoherently, and said little of moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Fenn, bluntly, &ldquo;is that your knife sticking
    in him? I mean, is it one belonging to Fraschini&rsquo;s service? Don&rsquo;t
    touch it, but look at it, you can tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luigi leaned over the dead man. &ldquo;Yes, it is one of our boning knives,&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;We always bring our own hardware.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, if you want to clear yourself and your men of doubt,
    tell all you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know this,&rdquo; and Luigi braced himself to the ordeal. &ldquo;I
    was waiting in the pantry for Miss Van Allen to send me word to serve supper,
    and I peeped in the dining-room now and then to see if it was time. I heard,
    presently, Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s voice, also a man&rsquo;s voice. I didn&rsquo;t
    want to intrude, so waited for a summons. After a moment or two I heard a
    little scream, and heard somebody or something fall. I had no thought of
    anything wrong, but thought the guests were unusually&mdash;er&mdash;riotous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s guests inclined to be riotous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir, oh, no,&rdquo; asseverated the man, while Mrs. Reeves and
    Ariadne looked indignant. &ldquo;And for that reason, I felt a little curious,
    so I pushed the door ajar and peeped in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw,&rdquo; Luigi paused so long that I feared he was going to
    collapse. But the coroner eyed him sternly, and he went on. &ldquo;I saw
    Miss Van Allen standing, looking down at this&mdash;this gentleman on the
    floor, and making as if to pull out the knife. I could scarcely believe my
    eyes, and I watched her. She didn&rsquo;t pull the knife, but she straightened
    up, looked around, glanced down at her gown, which&mdash;which was stained
    with blood&mdash;and then&mdash;she ran out into the hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where did she go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I couldn&rsquo;t see, as the door was but on
    a crack. Then I thought I ought to go into the dining-room, and I did. I
    looked at the gentleman, and I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. So I went into
    the hall, to the parlor door, and called for help, for a doctor or somebody.
    And then they all came out here. That&rsquo;s all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luigi&rsquo;s nerve gave way, and he sank into a chair with a sob. Fenn
    looked at him, and considerately left him alone for the time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can this be true?&rdquo; he said, turning to us. &ldquo;Can you suspect
    Miss Van Allen of this crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Bert Garrison and the women, at once. And, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said
    I. &ldquo;I am positive Miss Van Allen did not know Mr. Somers and could
    not have killed an utter stranger&mdash;on no provocation whatever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do not know what provocation she may have had,&rdquo; suggested
    Fenn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Mr. Coroner,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves very decidedly, &ldquo;I
    won&rsquo;t have Miss Van Allen spoken of in any such way. I assume you mean
    that this man, though a stranger, might have said or done something to annoy
    or offend Miss Van Allen. Well, if he had done so, Victoria Van Allen never
    would have killed him! She is the gentlest, most gay and light-hearted girl,
    and though she never tolerates any rudeness or familiarity, the idea of her
    killing a man is too absurd. You might as well suspect a dove or a butterfly
    of crime!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Mr. Coroner,&rdquo; said Garrison. &ldquo;That
    waiter&rsquo;s story is an hallucination of some sort&mdash;if it isn&rsquo;t
    a deliberate falsification. Miss Van Allen is a dainty, happy creature, and
    to connect her with anything like this&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;absurd!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to be found out, Mr. Garrison. Why did Miss Van Allen
    run away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t admit that she did run away&mdash;in the sense of flight.
    If she were frightened at this thing&mdash;if she saw it&mdash;she may have
    run out of the door in hysterics or in a panic of terror. But she the perpetrator!
    Never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;The poor child! If she did
    come out here&mdash;and saw this awful sight&mdash;why, I think it would
    unhinge her mind!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who is Miss Van Allen?&rdquo; asked Fenn. &ldquo;What is her occupation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t an occupation,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;She
    is a young lady of independent fortune. As to her people or immediate relatives,
    I know nothing at all. I&rsquo;ve known her a year or so, and as she never
    referred to such matters I never inquired. But she&rsquo;s a thorough little
    gentlewoman, and I&rsquo;ll defend her against any slander to my utmost powers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so will I,&rdquo; said Miss Gale. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of her
    fineness of character, and lovely nature&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But these opinions, ladies, don&rsquo;t help our inquiries,&rdquo; interrupted
    Fenn. &ldquo;What can you men tell us? What I want first, is to identify
    this body, or, rather to learn more of R. Somers, and to find Miss Van Allen.
    I can&rsquo;t hold an inquest until these points are cleared up. Mason, have
    you found out anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the inspector, returning from his long telephone
    quest. &ldquo;I called up four clubs. Norman Steele belongs to three of them,
    but this man doesn&rsquo;t seem to belong to any. That is, there are Somerses
    and even R. Somerses, but they all have middle names, and, too, their description
    doesn&rsquo;t fit this Somers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then Mr. Steele misrepresented him. Did you get Steele, Mason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, he wasn&rsquo;t at any of the clubs. I found his residence, a
    bachelor apartment house, but he isn&rsquo;t there, either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find Steele; find Miss Van Allen; find the maid, what&rsquo;s her
    name&mdash;Julia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Julie, she was always called,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;If
    Miss Van Allen went away, I&rsquo;ve no doubt Julie went with her. She is
    a most devoted caretaker of her mistress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An oldish woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Perhaps between thirty-five and forty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s she look like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Describe her, Ariadne, you&rsquo;re an artist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Julie,&rdquo; said Miss Gale, &ldquo;is a good sort. She&rsquo;s
    medium-sized, she has brown hair and rather hazel eyes. She wears glasses,
    and she stoops a little in her walk. She has perfect training and correct
    manners, and she is a model servant, but she gives the impression of watching
    over Miss Van Allen, whatever else she may be engaged in at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wears black?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; usually gray gowns, or sometimes white. Inconspicuous aprons
    and no cap. She&rsquo;s not quite a menial, but yet, not entirely a housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;English?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;English speaking, if that&rsquo;s what you mean. But I think she&rsquo;s
    an American. Don&rsquo;t you, Mrs Reeves?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;American? Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter4SomersRealName"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  Somers&rsquo; Real
      Name</strong></h2>
  <p>Detective Lowney, who had come with the coroner, had said little but had
    listened to all. Occasionally he would dart from the room, and return a few
    moments later, scribbling in his notebook. He was an alert little man, with
    beady black eyes and a stubby black mustache.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want a few words with that caterer&rsquo;s man,&rdquo; he said,
    suddenly, &ldquo;and then they&rsquo;d better clear away this supper business
    and go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We all turned to look at the table. It stood in the end of the dining-room
    that was back of the living-room. The sideboard was at the opposite end,
    back of the hall, and it was directly in front of the sideboard that Somers&rsquo; body
    lay.</p>
  <p>Lowney turned on more light, and a thrill went through us at the incongruity
    of that gay table and the tragedy so near it. As always at Vicky Van&rsquo;s
    parties, the appointments were dainty and elaborate. Flowers decorated the
    table; lace, silver, and glass were of finest quality; and in the centre
    was the contrivance known as a &ldquo;Jack Horner Pie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was to be the surprise,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;I knew
    about it. The pie is full of lovely trinkets and little jokes on the guests.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought those things were for children&rsquo;s parties,&rdquo; observed
    Fenn, looking with interest at the gorgeous confection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re really for birthdays,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves, &ldquo;and
    to-day is Vicky&rsquo;s birthday. That was part of her surprise. She didn&rsquo;t
    want it known, lest the guests should bring gifts. She&rsquo;s like a child,
    Vicky is, just as happy over a birthday party as a little girl would be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does Miss Van Allen look like?&rdquo; asked the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s pretty,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Reeves, &ldquo;awfully pretty,
    but not a raving beauty. Black hair, and bright, fresh coloring&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How was she dressed? Giddy clothes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In an evening gown,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Reeves, who resented the
    detective&rsquo;s off-hand manner. &ldquo;A beautiful French gown, of tulle
    and gold trimmings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Low-necked, and all that? Jewels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, as Mrs. Reeves disdained to answer. &ldquo;Full
    evening costume, and a necklace and earrings of amber set in gold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what I&rsquo;m getting at is,&rdquo; said Lowney, &ldquo;a
    woman dressed like that couldn&rsquo;t go very far in the streets without
    being noticed. We&rsquo;ll surely be able to trace Miss Van Allen. Where
    would she be likely to go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t
    go to my home, I live &lsquo;way down in Washington Square.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor to mine,&rdquo; chirped Ariadne, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s over on the
    west side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she left the house,&rdquo; declared the coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell us again, Luigi,&rdquo; asked Lowney, &ldquo;just where did
    the lady seem to go, when you saw her leave this room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, sir. I was looking through a small opening, as
    I pushed the door ajar, and I was so amazed at what I saw, that I was sort
    of paralyzed and didn&rsquo;t dare open the door further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go back to the pantry,&rdquo; commanded Fenn, &ldquo;and look in,
    just as you did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The waiter retreated to the post he had held, and setting the door a few
    inches ajar, proved that he could see body by the sideboard, but could not
    command a view of the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll represent Miss Van Allen,&rdquo; and Lowney stood
    over the body of Somers. &ldquo;Is this the place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A little farther to the right, sir,&rdquo; and Luigi&rsquo;s earnestness
    and good faith were unmistakable. &ldquo;Yes, sir, just there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, I walk out into the hall. Is this the way she went?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lowney went from the dining-room to the hall, and it was clear that his
    further progress could not be seen by the peeping waiter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, Fenn,&rdquo; the detective went on, &ldquo;from here, in
    the back of this long hall, Miss Van Allen could have left the house by two
    ways. She could have gone out at the front door, passing the parlor, or,
    she could have gone down these basement stairs, which are just under the
    stairs to the second story. Then she could have gone out by the front area
    door, which would give her access to the street. She could have caught up
    a cloak as she went.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; said Fenn, musingly, &ldquo;she could have run upstairs.
    The staircase is so far back in the hall, that the guests in the parlor would
    not have seen her. This is a very deep house, you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was true. The stairs began so far back in the long hall, that Vicky could
    easily have slipped upstairs after leaving the dining-room, without being
    seen by any of us in the living-room, unless we were in its doorway, looking
    out. Was anybody? So many guests had left, that this point could not be revealed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see her,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Reeves, &ldquo;and I
    don&rsquo;t believe she was in the dining-room at all. I don&rsquo;t care
    what that waiter says!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Madame,&rdquo; reiterated Luigi. &ldquo;It was Miss Van
    Allen. I know her well. Often she comes to Fraschini&rsquo;s, and always
    I take her orders. She came even this afternoon, to make sure the great cake&mdash;the
    Jack Horner, was all right. And she approved it, ah, she clapped her hands
    at sight of it. We all do our best for Miss Van Allen, she is a lovely lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Van Allen is one of your regular customers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One of our best. Very often we serve her, and always she orders our
    finest wares.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You provide everything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything. Candles, flowers, decorations&mdash;all&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And she pays her bills?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most promptly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By cheque?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And there are no servants here but the maid Julie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have often seen others. But I fancy they do not live in the house.
    Madame Julie superintends and directs us always. Miss Van Allen leaves much
    to her. She is most capable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When did you see this woman, this Julie, last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A short time before&mdash;before that happened.&rdquo; Luigi looked
    toward the body. &ldquo;She was in and out of the pantries all the evening.
    She admitted the guests, she acted as ladies&rsquo; maid, and she arranged
    the favors in the pie. It was, I should say, ten minutes or so since she
    was last in the pantry, when I peeped in at the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where was Julie then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I did not see her. Perhaps upstairs, or maybe
    in the front of the hall, waiting to bring me word to serve supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me something distinctive about this maid&rsquo;s appearance.
    Was she good-looking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, a good-looking woman. But nothing especial about her. She had
    many gold fillings in her teeth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something,&rdquo; and Lowney noted it with satisfaction. &ldquo;Go
    on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Luigi seemed to know nothing else that differentiated Julie from her
    sisters in service, and Lowney changed his questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How could Miss Van Allen get that knife of yours?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. It was, I suppose, in the pantry, with our
    other knives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is its use?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a boning knife, but doubtless one of our men used it in cutting
    celery for salad, or some such purpose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Inquiry showed that a man, named Palma, had used the knife for making a
    salad, and had left it in the butler&rsquo;s pantry an hour or so before
    the crime was committed. Any one could have taken the knife without its being
    missed, as the salad had been completed and put aside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In that case, Miss Van Allen must have secured the knife some little
    time before it was used, as Luigi was in the pantry just previously,&rdquo; observed
    Fenn. &ldquo;That shows premeditation. It wasn&rsquo;t done with a weapon
    picked up at the moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then it couldn&rsquo;t have been done by Miss Van Allen!&rdquo; exclaimed
    Mrs. Reeves triumphantly, &ldquo;for Vicky had no reason to premeditate killing
    a man she had never seen before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vicky didn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; wailed Ariadne. &ldquo;I know she
    didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She must be found,&rdquo; said Lowney. &ldquo;But she will be found.
    If she&rsquo;s innocent, she will return herself. If guilty, we must find
    her. And we will. A householder cannot drop out of existence unnoticed by
    any one. Does she own this house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not positive,
    but it&rsquo;s my impression that she does. Vicky Van never boasts or talks
    of her money or of herself. But I know she gives a good deal in charity,
    and is always ready to subscribe to philanthropic causes. I tell you she
    is not the criminal, and I don&rsquo;t believe she ever left this house in
    the middle of the night in evening dress! That child is scared to death,
    and is hiding&mdash;in the attic or somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose, Mrs. Reeves,&rdquo; said the coroner, &ldquo;you go with
    Mr. Lowney, and look over the house again. Search the bedrooms and store-rooms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; and Mrs. Reeves seemed to welcome an opportunity to
    help. She was a good-hearted woman, and a staunch friend of Vicky Van. I
    was glad she was on hand to stand up for the girl, for I confess things looked,
    to me, pretty dubious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come along, too, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
    no telling what we may find. Perhaps there&rsquo;s further&mdash;tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I knew what was in her mind. That if Vicky had done the thing, she might
    have, in an agony of remorse, taken her own life.</p>
  <p>Thrilled with this new fear, I followed Lowney and Mrs. Reeves. We went
    downstairs first. We examined all the basement rooms and the small, city
    back yard. There was no sign of Vicky Van or of Julie, and next we came back
    to the first floor, hunted that, and then on upstairs. The music room was
    soon searched, and I fell back as the others went into Vicky&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; said Lowney, &ldquo;we must make a thorough
    job of it this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The bedroom was, it seemed to me, like a fairy dream. Furniture of white
    enameled wicker, with pink satin cushions. Everywhere the most exquisite
    appointments of silver, crystal and embroidered fabrics, and a bed fit for
    a princess. It seemed profanation for the little detective to poke and pry
    around in wardrobes and cupboards, though I knew it must be done. He was
    not only looking for Vicky, but noting anything that might bear on her disappearance.</p>
  <p>But there was no clue. Everything was in order, and all just as a well-bred,
    refined woman would have her belongings.</p>
  <p>The bedroom was over the dining-room, and back of this, over the pantry
    extension, was Vicky Van&rsquo;s dressing-room.</p>
  <p>This was a bijou boudoir, and dressing-table, chiffonier, robe-chests, and
    jewel-caskets were all in keeping with the personality of their owner. The
    walls were panelled in pale rose color, and a few fine pictures were in absolute
    harmony. A long mirror was in a Florentine gilt frame, and a&nbsp;<em>chaise
    longue</em>, by a reading table, bespoke hours of ease.</p>
  <p>Ruthlessly, Lowney pried into everything, ran his arm among the gowns hanging
    in the wardrobe, and looked into the carved chests.</p>
  <p>Again no clue. The perfect order everywhere, showed, perhaps, preparation
    for guests, but nothing indicated flight or hiding. The dressing-table boxes
    held some bits of jewelry but nothing of really great value. An escritoire
    was full of letters and papers, and this, Lowney locked, and put the key
    in his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no
    harm done. And if the lady doesn&rsquo;t show up, we must examine the stuff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On we went to the third floor of the house. The rooms here were unused,
    save one that was evidently Julie&rsquo;s. The furnishings, though simple,
    were attractive, and showed a thoughtful mistress and an appreciative maid.
    Everything was in order. Several uniforms of black and of gray were in the
    cupboard, and several white aprons and one white dress. There were books,
    and a work-basket and such things as betokened the life of a sedate, busy
    woman.</p>
  <p>We left no room, no cupboard unopened. No hall or loft unsearched. We looked
    in, under and behind every piece of furniture, and came, at last, to the
    unescapable conclusion that wherever Vicky Van might be, she was not in her
    own house.</p>
  <p>Downstairs we went, and found Coroner Fenn and Inspector Mason in the hall.
    They had let Doctor Remson go home, also Garrison and Miss Gale. The waiters,
    too, had been sent off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You people can go, if you like,&rdquo; Fenn said, to Mrs. Reeves
    and myself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your addresses, and you can expect to
    be called on as witnesses. If we ever get anything to witness! I never saw
    such a case! No criminal to arrest, and nobody knows the victim! He must
    be from out of town. We&rsquo;ll nail Mr. Steele to-morrow, and begin to
    get somewhere. Also we&rsquo;ll look up Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s credits and
    business acquaintances. A woman can&rsquo;t have lived two years in a house
    like this, and not have somebody know her antecedents and relatives. I suppose
    Mr. Steele brought his friend here, and then, when this thing happened he
    was scared and lit out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe Steele did the killing,&rdquo; suggested Lowney.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; disagreed Fenn. &ldquo;I believe that Dago waiter&rsquo;s
    yarn. I cross-questioned him a lot before I let him go, and I&rsquo;m sure
    he&rsquo;s telling what he saw. I&rsquo;ll see Fraschini&rsquo;s head man
    to-morrow&mdash;or, I suppose it&rsquo;s to-morrow now&mdash;hello, who&rsquo;s
    that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another policeman came in at the street door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he said, looking about in amazement. &ldquo;You
    here, Mr. Fenn? Lowney? What&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Patrolman Ferrall, the officer on the beat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where you been?&rdquo; asked the coroner. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
    know what has happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; ever since midnight I been handling a crowd at a fire a couple
    blocks away. This is Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure it is, and a friend of hers named Somers has been bumped off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What? Killed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. What do you know of Miss Van Allen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, except that she lives here. Quiet young lady. Nothin&rsquo; to
    be said about her. Who&rsquo;s the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, except named Somers. R. Somers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never heard of him. Where&rsquo;s Miss Van Allen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Skipped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What! That little thoroughbred can&rsquo;t be mixed up in a shootin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t shot. Stabbed. With a kitchen knife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The coroner and Ferrall went toward the dining room, and, on an irresistible
    impulse of curiosity, I followed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Him!&rdquo; exclaimed Ferrall, as he caught sight of the dead man&rsquo;s
    features. &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t no Somers. That&rsquo;s Randolph Schuyler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure it is. Schuyler, the millionaire. Lives on Fifth Avenue, not
    far down from here. Who killed him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But look here. Are you sure this is Randolph Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure? Of course I&rsquo;m sure. His house is on my beat. I see him
    often, goin&rsquo; in or comin&rsquo; out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then we&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;got a big case on our hands!
    Mason!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The inspector could scarcely believe Ferrall&rsquo;s statement, but realized
    that the policeman must know.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he said, trying to think of a dozen things at once. &ldquo;Then
    Steele knew him, and introduced him as Somers on purpose. No wonder the clubs
    didn&rsquo;t know of R. Somers! R. S. on his handkerchiefs and all that.
    He used a false name &lsquo;cause he didn&rsquo;t want it known that Randolph
    Schuyler came to see Miss Van Allen! Oh, here&rsquo;s a mess! Where&rsquo;s
    that girl? Why did she kill him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Mrs. Reeves began to cry. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t
    know it&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Mr. Schuyler. She doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>know</em>&nbsp;Mr.
    Schuyler. I&rsquo;m sure she doesn&rsquo;t, because we were making lists
    for bazar patrons and she said she would ask only people she knew, and we
    tried to find somebody who knew Randolph Schuyler, to ask him, but we didn&rsquo;t
    know anybody who was acquainted with him at all. Oh, it can&rsquo;t be the
    rich Schuyler! Why would he come here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must get hold of Mr. Steele as soon as possible,&rdquo; said Fenn,
    excitedly. &ldquo;Breen, call up his home address again, and if he isn&rsquo;t
    there, go there and stick till he comes. Now, for some one to identify this
    body. Call up the Schuyler house&mdash;no, better go around there. Where
    is it, Ferrall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go straight out to the Avenue, and turn down. It&rsquo;s No.&mdash;only
    part of a block down. Who&rsquo;s going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You go, Lowney,&rdquo; said Fenn. &ldquo;Mason, will you go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Come on, Lowney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The coroner gave Mrs. Reeves and myself permission to go home, and I was
    glad to go. But Mrs. Reeves declared her intention of staying the night,
    what was left of it, in Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late for me to go down alone,&rdquo; she said, in
    her sensible way. &ldquo;And, too, I&rsquo;d rather be here, in case&mdash;in
    case Miss Van Allen comes home. I&rsquo;m her friend, and I know she&rsquo;d
    like me to stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter5TheSchuylerHousehold"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  The Schuyler Household</strong></h2>
  <p>As for me, I began to collect my senses after the shock of learning the
    true identity of the dead man. Though I had never met him, Randolph Schuyler
    was a client and friend of my partner, Charles Bradbury, and I suddenly felt
    a sort of personal responsibility of action.</p>
  <p>For one thing, I disliked the idea of Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s wife and family
    receiving the first tidings of the tragedy from the police. It seemed to
    me a friend ought to break the news, if possible.</p>
  <p>I said as much to Coroner Fenn, and he agreed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be an awful errand.
    In the middle of the night, too. If you&rsquo;re acquainted, suppose you
    go there with the boys, Mr. Calhoun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not personally acquainted, but Mr. Schuyler is my partner&rsquo;s
    client, though there&rsquo;s been little business of his with our firm of
    late. But, as a matter of humanity, I&rsquo;ll go, if you say so, and be
    of any help I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go, by all means. Probably they&rsquo;ll be glad of your advice and
    assistance in many ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I dreaded the errand, yet I thought if the police had had to go and tell
    Winnie and Aunt Lucy any such awful news, how glad they&rsquo;d be to have
    somebody present of their own world, even of their own neighborhood. So I
    went.</p>
  <p>As we had been told, the Schuyler house was only a few doors below the Avenue
    corner. Even as Mason rang the bell, I was thinking how strange that a man
    should go to a house where he desired to conceal his own name, when it was
    so near his own dwelling.</p>
  <p>And yet, I knew, too, that the houses on Fifth Avenue are as far removed
    from houses just off the Avenue, as if they were in a different town.</p>
  <p>Mason&rsquo;s ring was answered by a keen-eyed man of imperturbable countenance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wanted?&rdquo; he said, gazing calmly at the policemen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. Schuyler?&rdquo; asked the inspector, in a matter-of-fact
    way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s out,&rdquo; said the man, respectfully enough, but of
    no mind to be loquacious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He went to his club after dinner, and has not
    yet returned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you his valet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I wait up for him. He comes in with his key. I&rsquo;ve no idea
    when he will return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is his wife at home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Schuyler is at home.&rdquo; Clearly, this man was answering
    questions only because he recognized the authority that asked them. But he
    volunteered no information.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who else is in the family? Children?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Schuyler has no children. His two sisters are here, and Mrs.
    Schuyler. That is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are all in bed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Has anything happened to Mr. Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, there has. Mr. Schuyler is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; The imperturbable calm gave way, and the valet became
    nervously excited. &ldquo;What do you mean? Where is he? Shall I go to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We will come in,&rdquo; said Lowney, for until now, we had stood
    outside. &ldquo;Then we will tell you. Are any of the other servants about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir, they are all in bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;what is your name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cooper, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, Cooper, call the butler, or whoever is in general charge. And&mdash;summon
    Mrs. Schuyler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call Jepson, he&rsquo;s the butler, sir. And I&rsquo;ll
    call Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s maid, Tibbetts, if she&rsquo;s in. And the maid,
    Hester, who waits on the Misses Schuyler. Shall I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, get things started. Get Jepson as soon as you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is an awful affair,&rdquo; said Mason, as Cooper went off. We
    were in the hall, a great apartment more like a room, save that a broad staircase
    curved up at one side. The furnishings were magnificent, but in a taste heavily
    ornate and a little old-fashioned. There were carved and upholstered benches,
    but none of us cared to sit. The tension was too great.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep your eyes open, Lowney,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
    lots to be picked up from servants, before they&rsquo;re really on their
    guard. Get all you can about Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s evening habits from the
    man, Cooper. But go easy with the ladies. It&rsquo;s hard enough for them
    at best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The valet reappeared with Jepson. This butler was of the accepted type,
    portly and important, but the staggering news Cooper had evidently told him,
    had made him a man among men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he said, gravely. &ldquo;The master dead?
    Apoplexy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Jepson. Mr. Schuyler was killed by some one. We don&rsquo;t know
    who did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Killed! Murdered! My God!&rdquo; The butler spoke in a strong, low
    voice with no hint of dramatic effect. &ldquo;How will Mrs. Schuyler bear
    it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How shall we tell her, Jepson?&rdquo; Mason showed a consultant air,
    for the butler was so evidently a man of judgment and sense.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must waken her maid, and let her rouse Mrs. Schuyler. Then the
    other ladies, Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s sisters, we must&nbsp;<em>call</em>&nbsp;them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Jepson, do all those things, as quickly as you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the wait seemed interminable.</p>
  <p>At last the butler came back, and asked us up to the library, the front
    room on the floor above. Here a footman was lighting a fire on the hearth,
    for the house had the chill of the small hours.</p>
  <p>First came the two sisters. These ladies, though not elderly, were middle-aged,
    and perhaps, a few years older than their brother. They were austere and
    prim, of aristocratic features and patrician air.</p>
  <p>But they were almost hysterical in their excitement. A distressed maid hovered
    behind them with sal volatile. The ladies were fully attired, but caps on
    their heads and woolly wraps flung round them bore witness to hasty dressing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; cried Miss Rhoda, the younger of the two. &ldquo;What
    has happened to Randolph?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I introduced myself to them. I told them, as gently as I could, the bare
    facts, deeming it wise to make no prevarication.</p>
  <p>So raptly did they listen and so earnestly did I try to omit horrible details,
    and yet tell the truth, that I did not hear Mrs. Schuyler enter the room.
    But she did come in, and heard also, the story as I told it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can it not be,&rdquo; I heard a soft voice behind me say, &ldquo;can
    it not yet be there is some mistake? Who says that man is my husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I turned to see the white face and clenched hands of Randolph Schuyler&rsquo;s
    widow. She was holding herself together, and trying to get a gleam of hope
    from uncertainty.</p>
  <p>If I had felt pity and sorrow for her before I saw her, it was doubly poignant
    now.</p>
  <p>Ruth Schuyler was one of those gentle, appealing women, helplessly feminine
    in emergency. Her frightened, grief-stricken eyes looked out of a small,
    pale face, and her bloodless lips quivered as she caught them between her
    teeth in an effort to preserve her self-control.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am Chester Calhoun,&rdquo; I said, and she bowed in acknowledgment. &ldquo;I
    am junior partner in the firm of Bradbury and Calhoun. Mr. Bradbury is one
    of your husband&rsquo;s lawyers and also a friend, so, as circumstances brought
    it about, I came here, with Inspector Mason, to tell you&mdash;to tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Schuyler sank into a seat. Still with that air of determination to
    be calm, she gripped the chair arms and said, &ldquo;I heard you tell Miss
    Schuyler that Randolph has been killed. I ask you, may it not be some one
    else? Why should he be at a house where people called him by a name not his
    own?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had heard, then, all I had told the older ladies. For Mrs. Schuyler
    was not old. She must be, I thought at once, years younger than her husband.
    Perhaps a second wife. I was glad she had heard, for it saved repeating the
    awful narrative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has not been identified, Mrs. Schuyler,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;except
    by the policeman of this precinct, who declares he knows him well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I was glad to give her this tiny loophole of possibility of mistaken identity,
    and she eagerly grasped at it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must make sure,&rdquo; she said, looking at Inspector Mason.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s no room for doubt, ma&rsquo;am, but
    I&rsquo;m about to send the man, the valet, over to see him. Do you wish
    any one else to go&mdash;from the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Schuyler shuddered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to go,&rdquo; she said,
    piteously. &ldquo;For I can&rsquo;t think it is really Mr. Schuyler&mdash;and
    if it should be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no ma&rsquo;am, you needn&rsquo;t go. None of the family, I should
    say.&rdquo; Mason looked at the elder ladies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Miss Sarah, &ldquo;we couldn&rsquo;t think of
    it! But let Jepson go. He is a most reliable man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Schuyler, &ldquo;send Cooper and Jepson both.
    Oh, go quickly&mdash;I cannot bear this suspense!&rdquo; She turned to me,
    as the two men who had been hovering in the doorway, came in to take Mason&rsquo;s
    orders. &ldquo;I thank you, Mr. Calhoun. It was truly kind of you to come.
    Tibbetts, get me a wrap, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s own maid, who went on the errand at once.
    More servants had gathered; one or two footmen, a silly French parlor-maid
    or waitress, and from downstairs I heard the hushed voices of others.</p>
  <p>Tibbetts returned, and laid a fleecy white shawl about her mistress&rsquo; shoulders.
    Mrs. Schuyler wore a house dress of dull blue. Her hair of an ash-blonde
    hue, was coiled on top of her head; and to my surprise, when I noticed it,
    she wore a string of large pearls round her throat, and on her hands were
    two rings, each set with an enormous pearl.</p>
  <p>I must have been awkward enough to glance at the pearls, for Mrs. Schuyler
    remarked, &ldquo;I dressed so hastily, I kept on my pearls. I wear them at
    night sometimes, to preserve their luster.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she apparently forgot them, for without self-consciousness she turned
    to the detective and began asking questions. Nervously she inquired concerning
    minutest details, and I surmised that side by side with her grief at the
    tragedy was a very human and feminine dismay at the thought of her husband,
    stabbed to death in another woman&rsquo;s house!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who is Miss Van Allen?&rdquo; she asked over and over again, unsatisfied
    with the scant information Lowney could give.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And she lives near here? Just down the side street? Who&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she is anyone you ever heard of,&rdquo; I said
    to her. &ldquo;She is a pleasant young woman, and so far as I know, all that
    is correct and proper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why would she have Randolph Schuyler visiting her?&rdquo; flashed
    the retort. &ldquo;Is that correct and proper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; I said, for I felt a sort of loyalty to Vicky
    Van. &ldquo;You see, she was not acquainted with Mr. Schuyler until this
    evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did he go there, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Steele brought him&mdash;Norman Steele.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any Mr. Steele.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I began to think that Randolph Schuyler had possessed many acquaintances
    of whom his wife knew nothing, and I concluded to see Bradbury before I revealed
    any more of Schuyler&rsquo;s affairs.</p>
  <p>And then, Lowney began adroitly to put questions instead of answering them.</p>
  <p>He inquired concerning Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s habits and pursuits, his recreations
    and his social life.</p>
  <p>All three of the women gave responses to these queries, and I learned many
    things.</p>
  <p>First, that Randolph Schuyler was one manner of man at home and another
    abroad. The household, it was plain to be seen, was one of most conservative
    customs and rigidly straightbacked in its conventions.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Schuyler was not a second wife. She had been married about seven years,
    and had lived the last five of them in the house we were now in. She was
    much younger than her husband, and he had, I could see, kept her from all
    knowledge of or participation in his Bohemian tastes. They were the sort
    of people who have a box at the opera and are patrons of the best and most
    exclusive functions of the highest society. Mrs. Schuyler, after the first
    shock, recovered her poise, and though now and then a tremor shook her slight
    frame, she bore herself with dignity and calm.</p>
  <p>The two maiden ladies also grew quieter, but we all nervously awaited the
    return of the butler.</p>
  <p>At last he came.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the master, Madame,&rdquo; he said, simply, to his mistress
    as he entered the room. &ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The deferential gravity of his tone impressed me anew with the man&rsquo;s
    worth, and I felt that the stricken wife had a tower of strength in the faithful
    servitor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I left Cooper there, Madame,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;They&mdash;they
    will not bring Mr. Schuyler home tonight. In the morning, perhaps. And now,
    Madame, will you not go to rest? I will be at the service of these gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It seemed cruel to torture them further that night, and the three ladies
    were dismissed by Lowney, and, attended by their maids, they left us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Jepson,&rdquo; Lowney began, &ldquo;tell us all you know about
    Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s doings. I daresay you know as much as the valet does.
    Was Mr. Schuyler as a man of the world, different from his life in this house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jepson looked perturbed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not for me to say, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it is, my man. The law asks you, and it is for you to tell
    all you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; and the butler weighed his words, &ldquo;my master
    was always most strict of habit in his home. The ladies are very reserved,
    and abide by rules and standards, that are, if I may say so, out of date
    to-day. But, though Mr. Schuyler was by no means a gay man or a member of
    any fast set, yet I have reason to think, sir, that at times he might go
    to places where he would not take Mrs. Schuyler, and where he would not wish
    Mrs. Schuyler to know he had been himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Lowney. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got his
    number. Now, Jepson, had your master any enemies, that you know of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not that I know of. But I know nothing of Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s affairs.
    I see him go out of an evening, and I may notice that he comes in very late,
    but as to his friends or enemies, I know nothing at all. I am not one to
    pry, sir, and my master has always trusted me. I have endeavored not to betray
    that trust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This might have sounded pharisaical in a man of less sincerity of speech.
    But Jepson&rsquo;s clear, straightforward eyes forbade any doubt of his honesty
    and truth.</p>
  <p>Again I was glad that Mrs. Schuyler had this staunch helper at her side,
    for I foresaw troublous times in store for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you never heard of this Miss Van Allen? Never was in her house
    before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never, sir. I know nothing of the houses on the side blocks.&rdquo; I
    winced at this. &ldquo;Of course, I know the people who come to this house,
    but there is among them no Miss Van Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather not!&rdquo; I thought to myself. And then I sighed at the
    memory of Vicky Van. Had she killed this millionaire? And if so, why?</p>
  <p>I was sure Vicky had never met Randolph Schuyler before that evening. I
    had seen their meeting, and it was too surely the glance of stranger to stranger
    that had passed between them, to make a previous acquaintance possible. Vicky
    had been charming to him, as she always was to every one, but she showed
    no special interest, and if she did really kill him, it was some unguessable
    motive that prompted the deed.</p>
  <p>I thought it over. Schuyler, at the club, dined and wined, had perhaps heard
    Norman Steele extol the charms of Vicky Van. Interested, he had asked to
    be taken to Vicky&rsquo;s house, but, as it was so near his own, a sense
    of precaution led him to adopt another name.</p>
  <p>Then the inexplicable sequel!</p>
  <p>And the mysterious disappearance of Vicky herself.</p>
  <p>Though, of course, the girl would return. As Mrs. Reeves had said, doubtless
    she had witnessed the crime, and, scared out of her wits, had run away. Her
    return would clear up the matter.</p>
  <p>Then the waiter&rsquo;s story?</p>
  <p>Well, there was much to be done. And, as I suddenly bethought me, it was
    time I, myself went home!</p>
  <p>As I passed Vicky Van&rsquo;s house, on my way home, I saw lights pretty
    much all over it, and was strongly tempted to go in. But common sense told
    me I needed rest, and not only did I have many matters to attend to on the
    morrow, but I had to tell the story to Aunt Lucy and Winnie!</p>
  <p>That, of itself, would require some thought and tactful management, for
    I was not willing to have them condemn Vicky Van entirely, and yet, I could
    think of no argument to put forth for the girl&rsquo;s innocence.</p>
  <p>Time alone must tell.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter6VickysWays"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  Vicky&rsquo;s
      Ways</strong></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Ches-ter Cal-houn! Get up this minute! There&rsquo;s a reporter downstairs!
    A reporter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My sleepy eyes opened to find Winnie pounding my shoulder as it humped beneath
    the blanket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey? What?&rdquo; I grunted, trying to collect my perceptions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A&nbsp;<em>reporter!</em>&rdquo; If Winnie had said a Bengal tiger,
    she couldn&rsquo;t have looked more terrified.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great Scott! Win&mdash;I remember! Clear out, I&rsquo;ll be down
    in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I dressed in record time and went downstairs in three leaps.</p>
  <p>In the library, I found Aunt Lucy, wearing an expression that she might
    have shown if the garbage man had asked her to a dance.</p>
  <p>But Winnie was eagerly drinking in the story poured forth by the said reporter,
    who was quite evidently enjoying his audience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Chet, this is Mr. Bemis of&nbsp;<em>The Meteor</em>. He&rsquo;s
    telling us all about the&mdash;you know&mdash;what happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Winnie was too timid to say the word&nbsp;<em>murder,</em>&nbsp;and I was
    sorry she had to hear the awful tale from any one but myself. However, there
    was no help for it now, and I joined the group and did all I could to bring
    Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s eyebrows and nose down to their accustomed levels.</p>
  <p>But it&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;an awful story, make the best of it, and the
    truth had to be told.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is appalling,&rdquo; conceded Aunt Lucy, at length, &ldquo;but
    the most regrettable circumstance, to my mind, is your connection with it
    all, Chester.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Auntie, have a little heart for poor Mrs. Schuyler, and those
    old lady sisters. Also for the man himself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I have, Chet. I&rsquo;m not inhuman. But those things are in
    the papers every day, and while one feels a general sympathy, it can&rsquo;t
    be personal if one doesn&rsquo;t know the people. But, for you to be mixed
    up in such matters&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t mixed up in it, Aunt Lucy, except as I chose to mix
    myself. And I&rsquo;ve no doubt I should have gotten into it anyway. Mr.
    Bradbury will have a lot to do with it, I&rsquo;m sure. I&rsquo;m no better
    than he to mix in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In a business way, yes. But you were there socially&mdash;where a
    murder was committed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aunt Lucy could have shown no more horror of it all, if I had been the convicted
    criminal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, I&rsquo;m glad I was!&rdquo; I cried, losing patience a little. &ldquo;If
    I can be of any help to the Schuyler people or to Miss Van Allen, I shall
    be willing to do all I can.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Miss Van Allen is the&mdash;the murderer!&rdquo; and Aunt Lucy
    whispered the word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; I cried sharply. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
    know it at all, and there&rsquo;s no reason to condemn the girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I paused. Bemis was taking in my every word with a canny understanding of
    what I said, and also of what I didn&rsquo;t say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where do your suspicions tend, Mr. Calhoun?&rdquo; he said smoothly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frankly, Mr. Bemis, I don&rsquo;t know. I am an acquaintance of Miss
    Van Allen and I cannot reconcile the idea of crime with her happy, gentle
    nature. Nor can I see any reason to suspect the waiter who first told of
    the matter. But might not some person, some enemy of Mr. Schuyler, have been
    secreted in the house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A plausible theory,&rdquo; agreed Bemis, &ldquo;even an obvious one,
    but almost no chance of it. I&rsquo;ve seen the caterer&rsquo;s people, and
    they were in charge of the basement rooms and the dining-room all the evening.
    Unless it were one of the guests at the party, I think no intruder could
    have gotten in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I returned, uneasily, for I wished he would go, &ldquo;it
    isn&rsquo;t up to us to invent theories or to defend them. I will answer
    your necessary questions, but pardon me, if I remind you that I am a busy
    man and I haven&rsquo;t yet had my breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bemis took the hint, and after a string of definite and pertinent questions,
    he left.</p>
  <p>Winnie tried to detain him, but my curt courtesy made it difficult for him
    to linger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Chessy,&rdquo; cried my sister, as soon as Bemis had gone, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    awful, I know, but&nbsp;<em>isn&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;it exciting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Winnie,&rdquo; reproved Aunt Lucy. &ldquo;A girl of your age
    should know nothing of these things, and I want you to put it out of your
    mind. You can be of no help, and I do not want your nerves disturbed by the
    harrowing details.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Aunt Lucy,&rdquo; I put in, &ldquo;but this
    is going to be a celebrated case, and Winnie can&rsquo;t be kept in ignorance
    of its developments. Now be a good sort, Auntie&mdash;accept the inevitable.
    Try to realize that I must do what seems to me my duty, and if that brings
    us more or less into the limelight of publicity, it is a pity, but it can&rsquo;t
    be helped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I agree to all that, Chester, dear. But you are so mixed in it socially.
    Why did you ever get into that set?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a bad set, Aunt Lu. It isn&rsquo;t a fast set, by
    any means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t see Winnie or me there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, but a decent man goes to places where he wouldn&rsquo;t take
    his women people. Now, let up, Auntie. Trust your good-for-nothing nevvy,
    and just do all you can to help&mdash;by doing nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you, Chessy-Cat. I&rsquo;ll do exactly as you tell
    me, if you&rsquo;ll only let me know about it, and not treat me like a baby,&rdquo; said
    Winnie, who was wheedlesomely assisting my breakfast arrangements. She sugared
    and creamed my cereal, and, as I dispatched it, she buttered toast and poured
    coffee and deftly sliced off the top of a soft-boiled egg.</p>
  <p>I managed to eat some of these viands between answers to their rapid-fire
    volley of questions and at last I made ready to go down town.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And remember,&rdquo; I said, as I departed, &ldquo;if a lot of gossippy
    old hens come around here to-day&mdash;or your chicken friends&mdash;Winnie,
    don&rsquo;t tell them a thing. Let &lsquo;em get it from the papers, or apply
    to information, or any old way, but don&rsquo;t you two give out a line of
    talk! See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I kissed them both, and started off.</p>
  <p>Of course, I went over to Vicky Van&rsquo;s first. I had been on the proverbial
    pins and needles to get there ever since I woke to consciousness by reason
    of the sisterly pounding that brought me from the land of dreams.</p>
  <p>The house had an inhabited look, and when I went in, I was greeted by the
    odor of boiling coffee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come right down here,&rdquo; called Mrs. Reeves from the basement.</p>
  <p>I went down, passing the closed dining-room door with a shudder. Two or
    three policemen were about, in charge of things generally, but none whom
    I knew. They had been relieved for the present.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still here?&rdquo; I said, a little inanely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Reeves, who looked tired and wan. &ldquo;I
    stayed, you know, but I couldn&rsquo;t sleep any. I lay down on the music-room
    couch, but I only dozed a few minutes at a time. I kept hearing strange sounds
    or imagining I did, and the police were back and forth till nearly daylight.
    Downstairs, they were. I didn&rsquo;t bother them, but they knew I was in
    the house, if&mdash;if Vicky should come home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her face was wistful and her eyes very sad. I looked my sympathy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You liked her, I know,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;But everybody &lsquo;most,
    has turned against her. Since they found the man was Randolph Schuyler, all
    sympathy is for him and his widow. They all condemn Vicky.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can scarcely blame them,&rdquo; I began, but she interrupted,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do blame them! They&rsquo;ve no right to accuse that girl unheard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The waiter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I know, the waiter! Well, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s quarrel
    about it. I can&rsquo;t stay here much longer, though. I made coffee and
    got myself some breakfast&mdash;but, honest, Mr. Calhoun, it pretty nearly
    choked me to eat sandwiches that had been made for last night&rsquo;s surprise
    supper!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should think it would! Didn&rsquo;t any rolls come, or milk, you
    know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see any. Well, I&rsquo;ll go home this morning, but
    I shall telephone up here every little while. The police will stay here,
    I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, for a day or two. Do you think Vicky will come back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She&rsquo;ll have to, sooner or later. I tried
    to make myself sleep in her room last night, but I just couldn&rsquo;t. So
    I stayed in the music room, I thought&mdash;I suppose it was foolish&mdash;but
    I thought maybe she might telephone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d hardly do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s impossible to say&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;she
    might do. Oh, the whole thing is impossible! Think of it, Mr. Calhoun. Where
    could that girl have gone? Alone, at midnight, in that gorgeous gown, no
    hat or wrap&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;not positively. But if she had put on wraps and
    gone out by either door she would surely have been seen by some one in the
    house. I&rsquo;m just sure she didn&rsquo;t go out by the front street door,
    for we in the living-room must have noticed her. And she couldn&rsquo;t have
    gone out by the area door, for there were waiters all about, down here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We were sitting in the front basement room, a pleasant enough place, evidently
    a servants&rsquo; sitting room. Before Mrs. Reeves, on the table, were the
    remnants of her scarce tasted breakfast. As she had said, the tiny sandwiches
    and rich salad, which she had procured from the unused stores of the caterer&rsquo;s
    provision, did seem too closely connected with the tragedy to be appetizing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The kitchen is back of this?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and dumb waiters to the dining-room. I confess I&rsquo;ve looked
    about a bit. I&rsquo;m not a prying woman&mdash;but I felt I was justified.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You certainly are, Mrs. Reeves,&rdquo; I said, warmly, for she was
    thoroughly good-hearted, and a staunch friend of Vicky Van. &ldquo;Have you
    learned anything illuminating?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; but things are queer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Queer, how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t understand. A man couldn&rsquo;t. But it&rsquo;s
    this way. Lots of potted meats and jars of jam and cans of tea and coffee
    and cocoa in the pantry, but no fresh meat or green vegetables about. No
    butter in the icebox, and no eggs or bacon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what does that imply? I&rsquo;m no housekeeper, I admit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It looks to me as if Vicky was leaving this morning&mdash;I mean
    as if she had expected to go away to-day, and so had no stuff on hand to
    spoil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps this is her market day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s queer, that&rsquo;s what it is. You know sometimes
    Vicky does go away for days at a time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she a right to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course she has. I&rsquo;m thinking it out. Where does she go?
    And wherever it is, that&rsquo;s where she is now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Reeves&rsquo; triumphant air seemed to settle the question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But all that isn&rsquo;t queer, my dear lady,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We
    all know Vicky Van gads about a lot. I&rsquo;ve telephoned her myself twice,
    and she wasn&rsquo;t here. Once, Julie answered, and once there was no response
    of any sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose that&rsquo;s the case. She was going away on a visit
    to-day, maybe, and so had little food on hand to be disposed of. A good housekeeper
    would look after that. Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t be Vicky&rsquo;s doing,
    but Julie&rsquo;s. That housekeeper is a treasure. She could run a hotel
    if she wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, perhaps,&rdquo; I mused, aloud, &ldquo;Vicky ran away and went
    to the place, wherever it is, that she expected to visit to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. This is all merely conjecture. And, too,
    how could she, in that dress? No, she has gone to some friend in town. She
    must have done so. A hotel wouldn&rsquo;t take her in&mdash;why,&rdquo; Mrs.
    Reeves&rsquo; voice broke, &ldquo;you know that waiter said there&mdash;there
    was blood on Vicky&rsquo;s gown!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you believe that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If we believe him at all, why shouldn&rsquo;t we believe the whole
    tale? I don&rsquo;t know Vicky Van, you understand, except as a casual friend.
    I mean, I know nothing of her family, her past, or her personality, except
    as I&rsquo;ve seen her in a friendly way. I like her, thoroughly, but I can&rsquo;t
    honestly say that I know her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who does?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody. All her friends say the same thing. She is lovely and dear,
    but never confidential, or communicative regarding herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wherever she went, Julie must be with her,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I dare say that is so, but how on earth could&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;women
    get out of this house without its being known?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And yet, they did. Whether alone or together, they both got away
    last night. You don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re still concealed in the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, of course not; after the search we made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help thinking they&rsquo;ll turn up to-day. Julie,
    anyway. Why, Miss Van Allen must come back or send back for her valuables.
    I saw jewelry and money in the dressing-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but, of course, they&rsquo;re safe enough. They&rsquo;re all
    in care of the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We were interrupted by the entrance of a policeman and a woman who had come
    to work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She says,&rdquo; the policeman addressed Mrs. Reeves, &ldquo;that
    she was expected here to-day to clean. Now, we can&rsquo;t let her disturb
    things much, but she&rsquo;d better wash up a little, and throw away some
    of the supper stuff that won&rsquo;t keep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Everybody seemed to look to Mrs. Reeves as a sort of proxy housekeeper,
    and I wondered what they would have done without her. Though I suppose they
    would have managed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; was her glad response. &ldquo;Let her tidy up
    these breakfast things I&rsquo;ve used, and there&rsquo;s some cups and plates
    in the kitchen, for I gave those poor policemen some food &lsquo;long &lsquo;bout
    three o&rsquo;clock this morning. And she can throw out the melted ice cream,
    it&rsquo;s no good to anybody, and it surely isn&rsquo;t evidence!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I determined to ask the working-woman some questions, but the police forestalled
    me.</p>
  <p>Ferrall came down and joined us, and spoke to her at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mrs. Flaherty. Don&rsquo;t you do anything now, but
    just what you&rsquo;re told to do. And first, tell us a thing or two. How
    often do you come here? I&rsquo;ve seen you in and out, now and again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do be comin&rsquo; whin I&rsquo;m sint for; not of a reg&rsquo;lar
    day. Maybe wanst a week, maybe of&rsquo;ner. Thin agin, not for a fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as I said,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;Vicky often goes
    away for days at a time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shure she does that. Miss Van Allen is here to-day an&rsquo; gone
    to-morrow, but Miss Julie she looks after me wurruk, so she does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She engages you when you are needed?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. They&rsquo;s a tillyphone in me husband&rsquo;s shop, an&rsquo; if
    anny wan calls me, he lets me know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When did they tell you to come here to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Twas yisterday, sir. Miss Julie, she sinds wurrud for me to
    come this marnin&rsquo; to clane, as they do be havin&rsquo; a party last
    night. Ach, that this thrubble should come!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, now, Mrs. Flaherty, never mind your personal feelings. We&rsquo;re
    in a hurry.&rdquo; Ferrall was busy making notes of the information he was
    getting, and I could well understand, that any side-light on Vicky&rsquo;s
    home life was of importance. So I tarried to listen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long have you worked for Miss Van Allen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A matther av a year or more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You clean the rooms upstairs, sometimes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All over the house. Manny&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve shwept an&rsquo; vacuumed
    Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s own bedroom an&rsquo; boodore. An&rsquo; likewise
    the music room an&rsquo; parlure an&rsquo; all. Yis, sor, I&rsquo;m here
    frekint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What other servants does Miss Van Allen employ?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody that lives in, &lsquo;ceptin&rsquo; Miss Julie. But there&rsquo;s
    the laundry woman, as comes&mdash;though more often the wash goes out. Thin,
    there&rsquo;s a chore boy, as runs arrants; an&rsquo; sometimes a sewin&rsquo; woman;
    an&rsquo; often the caterer man&rsquo;s dagoes. Yis, an&rsquo; a boy, a Buttons
    you know, to open the dure for, say, an afternoon party. You see, Miss Van
    Allen is off visitin&rsquo; so much, she don&rsquo;t want steady help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where does she visit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I dunno. But go, she does, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
    good times she has. For she comes back, chipper an&rsquo; merry an&rsquo; glad
    to see her friends&mdash;an&rsquo; thin, all of a suddint, up an&rsquo; off
    agin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I knew that was Vicky Van&rsquo;s habit. All that the woman said corroborated
    my idea of the little butterfly&rsquo;s frivolous life. So, why should she
    keep permanent servants if she was at home only half the time? I knew the
    troubles Aunt Lucy had with her menials, and I approved of Vicky&rsquo;s
    wisdom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that explains the empty icebox,&rdquo; Mrs. Reeves was saying,
    nodding her head in satisfaction. &ldquo;Vicky meant to go off to-day, after
    the house was put in order, and she didn&rsquo;t want a lot of food left
    to spoil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yis, mum,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Flaherty. &ldquo;Shall I wash thim dishes
    now, mum?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she was allowed to set to work.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter7RuthSchuyler"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  Ruth Schuyler</strong></h2>
  <p>There were many calls on Vicky Van&rsquo;s telephone that morning. It seemed
    to me that the bell rang almost continually. The police people answered it,
    and one time, I was surprised to learn that the call was for me.</p>
  <p>I took up the receiver and heard Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I called up your home,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and your sister told
    me to try this number. Now, look here, Calhoun, I wish you&rsquo;d go to
    see Mrs. Schuyler. I&rsquo;ve talked with her over the telephone, and she
    asked me to come up there, but I&rsquo;ve got the Crittendon case on this
    morning, and I can&rsquo;t get away very well. So you go and see what you
    can do for her. She told me you were there last night, and she&rsquo;s willing
    to have you in my place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I agreed, feeling rather flattered that the rich man&rsquo;s widow should
    so readily accept me as Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s substitute.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re going there,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves,
    her eyes filling with tears, as I took leave of her. &ldquo;Of course, the
    Schuylers will pump you about Vicky, and try to make you say that she killed
    that man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must tell Mrs. Schuyler the truth,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but can&rsquo;t you give Vicky the benefit of the doubt? For
    there is a doubt. Why should she kill a man she never had seen before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps he wasn&rsquo;t a stranger to her, after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, I heard her say, before he came, that she didn&rsquo;t know
    him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You heard her say she didn&rsquo;t know Mr. Somers,&rdquo; I corrected. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    been thinking this thing over. Suppose Vicky did know Mr. Schuyler, and when
    Steele proposed bringing a Mr. Somers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re all wrong!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I saw them
    when they met, and I&rsquo;m sure they had never laid eyes on each other
    before. There was not the least sign of recognition. Besides, that isn&rsquo;t
    like Vicky&mdash;to have a millionaire and a married man for her friend.
    That girl is all right, Mr. Calhoun, and I don&rsquo;t want you to let Mrs.
    Schuyler think she isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps Mrs. Schuyler knows something about her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I doubt it. Anyway, you stand up for Vicky, as far as you can do
    so honestly. Won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can surely promise that,&rdquo; I replied, as I started on my errand.</p>
  <p>Approaching the Fifth Avenue residence, I looked at the house, which I had
    been unable to see clearly the night before.</p>
  <p>It was large and handsome, but not one of the most modern mansions. Four
    stories, it was, and as I glanced up I noticed that all the window shades
    were down. The floral emblem of death hung at one side of the wide entrance,
    and as I approached, the door silently swung open.</p>
  <p>A footman was in charge, and I was ushered at once to the library where
    I had been some hours earlier. It was not a cheerful room; the appointments
    were heavy and somber, though evidently the woods and fabrics were of great
    value. A shaded electrolier gave a dim light, for the drawn blinds precluded
    daylight.</p>
  <p>A soft step, and Mrs. Schuyler came into the room.</p>
  <p>Black garb was not becoming to her. The night before, in her blue house-dress,
    she had looked almost pretty, but now, in a black gown, without even a bit
    of relieving white at her throat, she was plain and very pathetic.</p>
  <p>Her face was pale and drawn, and her eyes showed dark shadows, as of utter
    weariness. She greeted me simply and glided to a nearby chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is kind of you to come, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; and the fine quality
    of her voice and inflection betokened New England ancestry, or training. &ldquo;As
    you were here last night&mdash;you seem more like a friend than a mere business
    acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am very glad, Mrs. Schuyler,&rdquo; and I spoke sincerely, &ldquo;that
    you look on me like that. Please tell me anything you wish to, and command
    me in any way I can serve you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The speech sounded a little stilted, I knew, but there was something about
    Ruth Schuyler that called for dignified address. She had the air of bewildered
    helplessness that always appeals to a man, but she had, too, a look of determination
    as to one who would do the right thing at any cost of personal unpleasantness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is all so dreadful,&rdquo; she began, and an insuppressible sob
    threatened her speech. But she controlled it, and went on. &ldquo;There is
    so much to be gone through with and I am so ignorant of&mdash;of law and&mdash;you
    know&mdash;of police doings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;and anything that you can
    be spared, rest assured you shall be. But there is much ahead of you that
    will be hard for you&mdash;very hard, and perhaps I can help you get ready
    for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will there be an inquest, and all that?&rdquo; she whispered the
    word half fearfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, there must be; though not for several days, probably. You know
    they can&rsquo;t find Miss Van Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Where can she be? I don&rsquo;t suppose they will ever find her.
    Why should she kill my husband? Have you any theory, Mr. Calhoun? How well
    did you know this&mdash;this person?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only fairly well. By which I mean, I have met her some half a dozen
    times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always in her own house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not always. I&rsquo;ve attended studio parties where she was present&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Bohemian affairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not exactly. Miss Van Allen is a delightful girl, bright and of merry
    spirits, but in no way fast or of questionable habits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they tell me; but pardon me, if I cannot believe
    a really nice, correct young woman would have a married man visiting her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But remember, Mrs. Schuyler, Miss Van Allen did not invite Mr. Schuyler
    to her house. As near as we can make out, Mr. Steele brought him, without
    Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s permission. And under an assumed name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A blush of shame stained her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I realize,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how that reflects against my husband.
    Must all this be made public, Mr. Calhoun?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fear it must. The law is inexorable in its demands for justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But if they can&rsquo;t find Miss Van Allen, how can they indict
    her? or whatever the term is. Why can&rsquo;t the whole affair be hushed
    up? Personally, I would far rather never find the girl&mdash;never have her
    punished, than to drag the Schuyler name through the horrors of a murder
    trial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I quite understand your position, but it will not be possible to
    evade the legal proceedings. Of course, if Miss Van Allen is never found,
    the affair must remain a mystery. But she will be found. A lady like that
    can&rsquo;t drop out of existence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, of course not. Why, her bills must be paid, her household effects
    looked after; is she in a house or an apartment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A house. I understand she owns it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then she must communicate with her business people&mdash;lawyer,
    bank or creditors. Can&rsquo;t you trace her that way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We hope to. As you say, she must surely return to attend to such
    matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And her servants? What do they say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I described the unusual menage that Vicky Van supported, and Mrs. Schuyler
    was interested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How strange,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She sounds to me like an adventuress!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t that. She has money enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where does she get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. But she is a quiet, self-reliant
    little person, and not at all of the adventuress type.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; and Mrs. Schuyler sighed. &ldquo;I
    don&rsquo;t care anything about her personality. She must be bad or she wouldn&rsquo;t
    have killed my husband. I&rsquo;m not defending him, but men don&rsquo;t
    go to the houses of complete strangers and get murdered by them! And I hope
    she will never be found, for it might bring out a story of scandal or shame
    that will always cling to Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s memory. But, of course, she
    will come back, and she will plead innocence and lay all blame on Mr. Schuyler.
    Can&rsquo;t we buy her off? I would pay a large sum to keep her story from
    the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, but that can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought you would help me&mdash;I&rsquo;m so disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tears gathered in her eyes, and her voice trembled. I wished Bradbury had
    had this job instead of myself, for I am soft-hearted where feminine appeal
    is concerned, and I didn&rsquo;t know quite what to say.</p>
  <p>But just then the two Schuyler sisters came into the library and I rose
    to greet them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Miss Rhoda, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all too awful! We
    can&rsquo;t believe it! I wish I had that girl here! You must find her, Mr.
    Calhoun&mdash;you must!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chimed in Miss Sarah; &ldquo;she must be brought to judgment.
    An eye for an eye and a life for a life. That&rsquo;s the Scripture law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so, Sarah,&rdquo; pleaded Ruth Schuyler. &ldquo;It
    won&rsquo;t bring Randolph back, to punish his murderer. And think of the
    awful publicity!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for that. Murder has been done and murder must
    be avenged. I&rsquo;m ashamed of you, Ruth, if you let any idea of personal
    distaste stand in the way of righteous law and order.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; agreed Rhoda. &ldquo;Spare no effort or expense, Mr.
    Calhoun, to find that wicked girl and have her arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I daresay you are right,&rdquo; and Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s acquiescence
    showed her to be more or less under the iron hand of the family opinion. &ldquo;Of
    course, if you feel that way, I shall raise no obstacle to the law&rsquo;s
    progress. Whatever you advise, Rhoda, I agree to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly you do. You are young, Ruth, and you are not a Schuyler.
    Why, the very name demands the strongest powers of the law. I only fear that
    the most desperate efforts may not succeed. What is your opinion, Mr. Calhoun?
    Can they find that woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The scorn of the last two words, as uttered by Rhoda Schuyler&rsquo;s sharp
    tongue, is not to be reproduced in print.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think most probably, yes, Miss Schuyler. I think she must return
    sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait for that!&rdquo; exclaimed Sarah. &ldquo;Send people
    to search for her. Scour the country. Don&rsquo;t let her get away beyond
    retrieval. Offer a reward, if necessary, but get her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A reward!&rdquo; repeated Rhoda. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it. Put
    it in the paper at once; a large reward for any information of Miss Van Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; I urged; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t decide on such measures
    too hastily. Might you not defeat your own purpose? Miss Van Allen doubtless
    will see the papers, wherever she may be. If she learns of the reward, she
    will hide herself more securely than ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; said Ruth, in her gentle voice. &ldquo;I
    am sure, Rhoda, we oughtn&rsquo;t to do anything like that just yet. Oh,
    how hard it is to know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve always deferred everything to Randolph. How can
    we get along without him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must,&rdquo; and Mrs. Schuyler set her pale lips together in an
    evident determination to be brave and strong. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Calhoun, what
    is there to be discussed in a business way? I mean regarding Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s
    business with you or Mr. Bradbury?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing at present,&rdquo; I returned, feeling sure the poor woman
    had quite enough on her mind. &ldquo;The will can be examined at your convenience,
    and any questions of securities or money can rest over for a time. Do you
    wish any ready cash? Or shall we look after any money matters?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, no. Such things are systematically arranged in the household.
    Jepson attends to bills and tradesmen. My greatest wish is for a secretary
    or some person to write notes and look after the flood of letters and telegrams
    that has already begun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I felt surprised, for I had assumed that the rich man&rsquo;s wife had a
    social secretary of her own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no one,&rdquo; she said, in response to my glance, &ldquo;Mr.
    Schuyler didn&rsquo;t wish me to have a secretary, and indeed I didn&rsquo;t
    need one. But now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, it is necessary now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Rhoda. &ldquo;I am surprised
    at you, Ruth! You know how Randolph objected to such things, and now, as
    soon as he is gone, you begin to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Rhoda,&rdquo; said Ruth, with gentle dignity. &ldquo;It was
    not necessary before, but it is now. You&rsquo;ve no idea what a task it
    will be. All our friends and many of Randolph&rsquo;s acquaintances will
    call or send messages and they must be acknowledged&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, pray, what else have you to do, but acknowledge them? Sarah
    and I will attend to our own. A great many, doubtless, but not too much of
    a task for us, when it is in memory of our dear brother!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and Ruth spoke calmly, &ldquo;we will wait for
    a day or two, Mr. Calhoun, and then, if, as I believe, the matter requires
    further consideration, we will discuss it again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clever woman, I thought to myself. She isn&rsquo;t altogether chummy with
    those old maid sisters, and yet she knows better than to have any open disagreement.
    I&rsquo;ll bet she gets her secretary when she gets ready for one! I&rsquo;ll
    be on the lookout for the right girl for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When will they bring my husband home?&rdquo; she continued, without
    waiting for comment on her decision about the secretary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some time to-day,&rdquo; I returned, looking commiseratingly at the
    harassed white face. &ldquo;Probably this afternoon. Can I take any message
    regarding the funeral arrangements?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; and Ruth Schuyler shuddered. &ldquo;Those details
    are so terrible&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Terrible, yes,&rdquo; said Miss Sarah, &ldquo;but they must be looked
    after. We will see the undertaker&rsquo;s men, Ruth. I think Rhoda and I
    will know better what is fit and proper for Randolph&rsquo;s burial ceremonies
    than you possibly can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I began to realize that the sisters had a family pride which did not include
    their brother&rsquo;s wife in their councils. Apparently she was, or they
    deemed her, of lesser birth or social standing. Personally, however, I greatly
    preferred the gentle kindliness of the widow to the aristocratic hauteur
    of the sisters.</p>
  <p>Ruth Schuyler made no objection to the proposition, and seemed relieved
    that her advice would not be required.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who is in the house where Mr. Schuyler was&mdash;where he died?&rdquo; she
    asked, hesitatingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only the police,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;unless Miss Van Allen
    has returned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were&mdash;were there many people there&mdash;last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clearly, she wanted to know more details of the occasion, but didn&rsquo;t
    like to show curiosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I informed her, &ldquo;quite a number. It was Miss Van
    Allen&rsquo;s birthday, and so, a sort of little celebration.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her birthday? How old was she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea. I should guess about twenty-two or twenty-three.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is she&mdash;is&mdash;what does she look like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The eternal feminine wanted to ask &ldquo;is she pretty?&rdquo; but Ruth
    Schuyler&rsquo;s dignity scarcely permitted the question. I noticed, too,
    that the sisters listened attentively for my reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, truthfully, &ldquo;she is pretty. She is small,
    with very black hair, and large, dark gray eyes. She is exceedingly chic
    and up-to-date as to costumes, and is of vivacious and charming manner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; sniffed Miss Rhoda, &ldquo;an actress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all! Victoria Van Allen is a well-bred lady if there ever
    was one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are a staunch friend, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; and Mrs. Schuyler looked
    her surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I speak only as I feel; I can&rsquo;t say surely that Miss Van Allen
    did not commit this crime, for I know there is evidence against her. But
    I can&rsquo;t reconcile the deed with her character, as I know it, and I,
    for one, shall wait further developments before I condemn her. But, of course,
    Mrs. Schuyler, my personal feelings in the matter have no weight in law,
    and I stand ready to obey whatever orders you may give in connection with
    a search for the missing girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I do want done, yet, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; and
    Ruth Schuyler glanced deferringly toward the sisters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; For once Sarah agreed with Ruth. &ldquo;After
    the funeral, we can set our minds to the finding of the criminal. Of course,
    the police will do all they can, meantime, to trace her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course. And such a plan is best. She may return&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To a house guarded by police?&rdquo; asked Ruth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly. If she is innocent, why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Innocent!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Rhoda with utmost scorn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some of her friends think her so,&rdquo; I observed. &ldquo;Mrs.
    Reeves, a lady who was at the party, stayed in the house all night, and is,
    I think, there still.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did she do that?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Schuyler, looking puzzled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She hoped Miss Van Allen would return, and she waited there to look
    after her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was kind. Who is this lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She lives down on Washington Square. I only know her slightly, but
    she is a warm-hearted and a most capable and sensible one. She refuses to
    believe that Vicky Van&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you call her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her friends call her Vicky Van. It&mdash;it sort of suits her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From what you say, I judge she is not the terror I thought her at
    first; but, all the same, she murdered my husband, and I cannot look on her
    as you seem to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor can I blame you. Your feelings toward her are entirely just,
    Mrs. Schuyler.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter8TheLetterBox"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  The Letter-Box</strong></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer case,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury to me, when I reached
    the office that afternoon. &ldquo;Of course, I know Randolph Schuyler was
    no saint, but I never supposed he was deep enough in any affair to have a
    woman kill him. And so near his own home, too! He might have had the decency
    to choose his lady acquaintances in more remote sections of the city.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the queerest part to me,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;What
    I can&rsquo;t understand is, why that girl stabbed him. She didn&rsquo;t
    know him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, now, Calhoun, she must have known him. She didn&rsquo;t know
    any Somers, we&rsquo;ll say, but she must have known Schuyler. A murder has
    to have a motive. She had provided herself with that knife beforehand, you
    see, and she got him out to the dining-room purposely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think it,&rdquo; I said, and I sighed. &ldquo;I know
    Vicky Van fairly well, and she wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say what a woman would or wouldn&rsquo;t do. But
    it&rsquo;s not our business to look after the criminal part of it, we&rsquo;ve
    got all we can handle, attending to the estate. And here&rsquo;s another
    thing. I wish you&rsquo;d do all that&rsquo;s necessary up at the house.
    I always got along all right with Randolph Schuyler, but I can&rsquo;t stand
    those sisters of his. His wife I have never met. But those old Schuyler women
    get on my nerves. So you look after them. You&rsquo;re more of a ladies&rsquo; man
    than I am, so you go there and talk pretty when they want legal advice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care such
    a lot for the sisters myself, but Mrs. Schuyler is a young thing, ignorant
    of her own rights, and those old maids boss her like fury. I&rsquo;m going
    to see that she has her own way in some few things, at least. She inherits
    half the fortune, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and the sisters a quarter each. That is, after some minor bequests
    and charitable donations are settled. Schuyler was a good sort&mdash;as men
    go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then men go pretty badly! He was a brute to his wife; I&rsquo;ve
    been told he ruled her with a rod of iron, and what he didn&rsquo;t bother
    her about, the old sisters did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s neither here nor there. Don&rsquo;t you try to be a
    peacemaker in that family. I know those two old ladies, and they&rsquo;d
    resent anything in the way of criticism of their treatment of their sister-in-law.
    And, if Schuyler didn&rsquo;t treat his wife handsomely, she&rsquo;s rid
    of him now, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cold-blooded thing, Bradbury,&rdquo; I informed him, &ldquo;and
    I am going to do all I can for that young widow. She&rsquo;ll have a lot
    of unpleasant publicity at best, and if I can shield her from part of it,
    so much the better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Calhoun. Do what you like, but don&rsquo;t get in on the
    detective work. I know your weakness for that sort of thing, and I know if
    you begin, you&rsquo;ll never let up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bradbury was right. I have a fondness for detective work&mdash;not the police
    part of it, but the inquiry into mystery, the deduction from clues and the
    sifting of evidence. I had no mind to miss the inquest, and I had a burning
    curiosity to know what had become of Vicky Van. This was not only curiosity,
    either. I had a high respect and a genuine liking for that little lady, and,
    as Mrs. Reeves had put it, I was only too willing to give her the benefit
    of the doubt.</p>
  <p>Though I couldn&rsquo;t feel any real doubt that she had killed Schuyler.
    As Bradbury said, she didn&rsquo;t know a Mr. Somers, but she may have known
    the millionaire Schuyler. I had never seen anything of a seamy side to Vicky&rsquo;s
    character; but then, I didn&rsquo;t know her so very well, and the man was
    dead, and who else&nbsp;<em>could</em>&nbsp;have killed him?</p>
  <p>I went around to the caterer&rsquo;s on my way uptown that afternoon, and
    asked him as to the reliability of Luigi and the probable truth of his story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That man,&rdquo; Fraschini told me, &ldquo;is as honest as the day.
    I&rsquo;ve had him longer than any of my other waiters, and he has never
    said or done anything to make me doubt his accuracy. I believe, Mr. Calhoun,
    that Luigi saw exactly what he said he saw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might he not have been mistaken in the identity of the woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not likely. I&rsquo;ll call him, and you can question him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was what I wanted, to question the waiter alone, and I welcomed the
    opportunity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it was Miss Van Allen,&rdquo; was the quiet response of the
    Italian to my inquiry. &ldquo;I cannot be mistaken. I had seen her many times
    during the evening. I, therefore, recognized the gown she wore, of light
    yellow gauzy stuff and an over-dress of long gold bead fringes. I saw her
    stand above the fallen body, looking down at it with a horrified face. I
    saw stains of blood on her gown&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;What part of her gown?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luigi thought a moment. &ldquo;On the lower flounces, as if her skirts had
    brushed against the&mdash;the victim, when she stooped over him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did she herself observe these stains?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; she looked at them, and looked frightened and then she ran to
    the hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you saw no other person near?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And heard nobody?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard only the voices from the parlor. There was much noise of
    laughter and talk there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No amount of questioning could change or add to Luigi&rsquo;s story. It
    was quite evident that he was telling just what he saw, and had no interest
    in coloring it to make it appear different in any way. He admired Miss Van
    Allen, he said she was a pleasant lady and not hard to please if her orders
    were faithfully carried out. He expressed no personal interest in the question
    of her guilt or innocence, he simply told what he had seen. I didn&rsquo;t
    altogether like his stolid indifference, it seemed impossible there should
    be so little humanity in a fellow-being, but I knew he was a good and conscientious
    waiter, and I concluded he was nothing more.</p>
  <p>I went home, and, of course, was met by Aunt Lucy and Winnie with a perfect
    storm of questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After dinner,&rdquo; I begged. &ldquo;Let me get a little rest and
    food, and then I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But after a few spoonfuls of soup, Winnie declared I was too nervous to
    eat and I might as well talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I will,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But, look here, you two. To begin
    with, I want you to understand that I&rsquo;m involved in this matter in
    a business way, and I&rsquo;m also interested in a personal way. And I don&rsquo;t
    want any silly talk about it&rsquo;s being unfortunate or regrettable that
    I should be. It&rsquo;s a business case, Aunt Lucy, as far as the settlement
    of Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s estate is concerned, and it&rsquo;s a personal affair
    that I&rsquo;m acquainted with Miss Van Allen; and I propose to make more
    or less effort to find some trace of that girl, and to see if there is any
    possible chance that she may not be the guilty one after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good for you, Lord Chesterton!&rdquo; cried Winnie. &ldquo;I always
    knew you were the soul of chivalry, and now you&rsquo;re proving it! What
    are you going to do&mdash;to find out things, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet, Win. But if you want to help me, you can
    do a lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, she won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; declared Aunt Lucy. &ldquo;If you
    have to do these things as a matter of business, I can&rsquo;t object. But
    I won&rsquo;t have Winnie dragged into it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No dragging, Aunt Lu, and nothing very desperate for Winnie to do.
    But, I&rsquo;d be jolly glad if both of you would just glance out of the
    window occasionally and see if you see anything going on at the Van Allen
    house, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll do that!&rdquo; Winnie cried. &ldquo;Nobody can see
    me, I&rsquo;ll keep behind our curtains, and I can see that house perfectly
    well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean all the time, child. But I do feel sure that Vicky
    Van will come back there, and if you glance out now and then, you might see
    her go in or out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s dark,&rdquo; said Aunt Lucy, who was becoming interested,
    in spite of her scruples.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to-night, or any night. But in the daytime. She&rsquo;s
    likely to come, if at all, in broad daylight, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t the police keeping guard on the house?&rdquo; inquired
    my aunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only the regular patrolman. He passes it every few hours, joggles
    the doorknob, and goes on. If Vicky is as clever as I think she is, she&rsquo;ll
    time that policeman, and sneak into the house between his rounds. It&rsquo;s
    only a chance, you know, but you might see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then I told them all I knew myself of the whole affair. And seeing that
    I was deeply into the turmoil of it all, and had grave responsibilities,
    Aunt Lucy withdrew all objections and sympathized with me. Also, she was
    impressed with my important business connections with the Schuyler family,
    and was frankly curious about that aristocratic household. I was asked over
    and over again as to their mode of living, the furniture and appointments
    of the house, and the attitudes of the widow and the sisters toward each
    other.</p>
  <p>It was late in the evening before I remembered some important papers Mr.
    Bradbury had given me to hand to Mrs. Schuyler, and as soon as I thought
    of them I telephoned to know if I might then bring them over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came back Ruth Schuyler&rsquo;s soft voice. &ldquo;I
    wish you would. I want to consult you about some other things also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The interview was less trying than that of the morning had been. Several
    matters of inheritance, insurance, and such things were discussed, and Mrs.
    Schuyler was more composed and calm.</p>
  <p>She looked better, too, though this was doubtless due, in part, to the fact
    that she wore a white house dress which was far more becoming than black
    to her colorless face and light hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said, at length, &ldquo;whether what
    I want to say should be said to you or to the detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me first,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I may be able to advise
    you. In any case, it will be confidential.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are kind,&rdquo; she said, and her grateful eyes smiled appreciatively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    this. I&rsquo;d rather not have that&mdash;that Miss Van Allen traced, if
    it can be prevented in any way. I have a special reason for this, which I
    think I will tell you. It is, that, on thinking it over I have become convinced
    that my husband must have known the young woman, and the acquaintance was
    not to his credit. For some reason, I think, she must have forbidden him
    the house, and that is why he went there under an assumed name. Mr. Lowney
    succeeded in getting Mr. Steele on the long distance telephone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, where is Steele?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In Chicago. Mr. Lowney says that he had to go there on the midnight
    train, and that is why he left the lady&rsquo;s house&mdash;Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s
    house, so suddenly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really? Well, I am surprised. But, go on, what else did Steele say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He said that Mr. Schuyler was with him at the club, and that he,
    Mr. Steele, said he was going to Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s party and Mr. Schuyler
    begged him to take him along, and introduce him as Mr. Somers. It seems he
    had asked Mr. Steele before to do this, but this time he was more insistent.
    So Mr. Steele did it. Of course, Mr. Calhoun, I asked Mr. Lowney minutely
    about all this, because I want to know just what circumstances led up to
    my husband&rsquo;s going to that house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, Mrs. Schuyler, you have every right to know. And did Steele
    say that was Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s first visit there or merely his first visit
    as Mr. Somers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Steele thought Mr. Schuyler had never been to the house before
    at all. But may he not have been mistaken? May not Mr. Schuyler have known
    the lady previously&mdash;oh, it is such a moil! But, in any case, Mr. Calhoun,
    it seems to me that further probing and searching will only pile up opprobrium
    on the name of Schuyler, and&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stand it. I am so unused
    to notoriety or publicity I can&rsquo;t face all the unpleasantness that
    must follow! Do help me to avoid it, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I certainly will, if I can. But I fear you ask the impossible, Mrs.
    Schuyler. The law will not be stopped in its course by personal inclinations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not. What is it, Tibbetts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The last question was addressed to her maid, who appeared at the doorway.
    The sad-faced woman looked at her mistress with a mingled air of deference
    and commiseration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The telephone, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I said you were
    busily engaged, but it is some young woman who begs to speak to you a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Schuyler excused herself and left the room, and Tibbetts, smoothing
    down her trim white apron, followed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another would-be secretary,&rdquo; my hostess said, as she returned. &ldquo;I
    don&rsquo;t know how a report that I wanted one travelled so quickly, but
    I&rsquo;ve had three offered since noon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do the Schuyler ladies still object?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; at least, they are willing. But I don&rsquo;t want any except
    a capable one. Not so much experienced, as quick-witted and intelligent.
    You may as well know, Mr. Calhoun, since you are to look after my affairs,
    that my late husband was of strictly plain habits. He was almost frugal in
    his ideas of how little womankind should be indulged in any luxuries or unnecessary
    comforts. This did not incommode his sisters for they were of the same mind.
    But I desired certain things which he saw fit to deny me. I make no complaint,
    I bear his memory no ill will, but I feel that now I may have some of these
    things. I am my own mistress, and while I have no wish to cast any reflection
    on Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s management of his own house, yet, it is now my house,
    and I must have the privilege of ordering it as I choose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It had come already, then. Ruth Schuyler and her Puritanical sisters-in-law
    had met the issue, and Ruth had stood up for her rights. I felt that I knew
    the woman well enough to know she would not have taken this stand so soon
    after her husband&rsquo;s death except that some discussion or disagreement
    had made it necessary for her to assert herself. I bowed in acquiescence,
    and said, &ldquo;I am sure, Mrs. Schuyler, there can be no objection to your
    doing exactly as you please. This house is entirely your own, half Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s
    fortune is yours, and you are responsible to nobody for your actions. If
    not intrusive, I will offer to look you up a suitable secretary. I have a
    young woman in mind, whom I think you would like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not easy to please,&rdquo; she said, smiling a little; &ldquo;I
    have a very definite idea of what I want. Who is your friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a friend, exactly. An acquaintance of my sister&rsquo;s, who
    is eligible for the post, if she suits you. Shall I send her round to see
    you to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, please. Your mention of her is enough recommendation. I want,
    Mr. Calhoun, to do more or less charitable work this winter. That was another
    of Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s whims, to attend to all charities himself, and to
    object to my giving anything personally. As I shall be quiet and unoccupied
    this winter, I plan to do some systematic work in a benevolent way. I know
    this sounds strange to you, that I should be planning these things so soon.
    But the truth is, I do plan them, purposely, because I don&rsquo;t want to
    think about the present horror. I need something to keep my mind from thinking
    of the awful tragedy or I shall go mad. It seemed to me not wrong to think
    about some work that should benefit others; and to do this, will give me
    an outlet for my energies and be helpful to the poor and suffering.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ruth Schuyler looked almost beautiful as her face glowed with enthusiasm
    on her subject. I realized how the nervous, highstrung woman must be torn
    with agony at the revelations of her husband&rsquo;s defects and the uncertainty
    of his honor and morality, and all in addition to the terrible experiences
    she was undergoing and must yet encounter.</p>
  <p>I went home filled with a desire to help her in every way I could, and though
    I went to my room at once, I could not think of sleep. I felt like planning
    ways to put the police off the track or finding some method of making them
    cease their hunt for Vicky Van.</p>
  <p>I went down to the library, and sat down for a smoke and a revery. And I
    sat there until very late, after two o&rsquo;clock, in fact, without getting
    any nearer a plan than I was at the start.</p>
  <p>It was nearly three, when I concluded that I could sleep at last. I stood
    by the front window a moment, looking over at Vicky Van&rsquo;s house, across
    the street, and a few doors from our own.</p>
  <p>As I looked at the darkened dwelling, I saw the front door slowly open.
    There was no one outside, it was being opened from inside. As I knew the
    body of Mr. Schuyler had been taken away, and the house had been deserted
    by all who had been there, and that it was in custody of the police, I looked
    curiously to see what would happen next.</p>
  <p>Out of the door came a slight, small figure. It was, I felt positive, Vicky
    Van herself! I couldn&rsquo;t mistake that sleek, black head&mdash;she wore
    no hat&mdash;or those short, full skirts, that she always wore. She looked
    about cautiously, and then with swift motions she unlocked the letter-box
    that was beside her front door, took out several letters, relocked the box
    and slipped back into the house again!</p>
  <p>Without stopping to think I opened my front door, and flew across the street.
    Mounting her steps, I rang the doorbell hard. There was no response, and
    I kept on ringing&mdash;a veritable bombardment. Then the door opened a very
    little bit&mdash;I could see it was on a night-chain&mdash;and Vicky&rsquo;s
    voice said, &ldquo;Please go away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;let me come in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you come in. Go away,&nbsp;<em>please.</em>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then the door closed, in my very face, and though I pleaded, &ldquo;Vicky,&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;let
    me in!&rdquo; there was no response.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter9TheSocialSecretary"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  The Social Secretary</strong></h2>
  <p>I stood staring at the closed door. What did it mean? Why was Vicky in there
    and why wouldn&rsquo;t she let me come in?</p>
  <p>Then, as I collected my wits, I laughed at myself. I knew why she was there&mdash;to
    get her mail. Doubtless there were important letters that she must have,
    and she had dared discovery to come at dead of night to get them. The patrolman
    was not in sight. She had looked out for this, of course. It was the merest
    chance that I had seen her, otherwise she would have escaped all observation.
    At three in the morning there are almost no people abroad in the quieter
    streets of the city, and Vicky had timed her visit well. Of course, she had
    her own keys, and I felt sure she had stealthily entered at the basement
    door, and waited her time to secure the letters from the mail-box.</p>
  <p>I looked at the mail-box, an unusual appendage to a private residence, but
    Vicky was away from home so much, it was doubtless necessary. I tried to
    look in at a window, but all shades were down and there were no lights inside.
    I wanted to ring the doorbell again, but a sense of delicacy forbade me.
    I was not a detective, and if I persisted, I might attract the attention
    of a passer-by or of the returning policeman, and so get Vicky into all sorts
    of trouble. I wasn&rsquo;t tracking the girl down. If she was a criminal,
    let the police find her, I had no desire to aid their efforts, but I did
    want to see Vicky Van. I wanted to offer her my help&mdash;not in escaping
    justice, exactly&mdash;but I wondered if I mightn&rsquo;t do some little
    errands or favors that would show my friendliness.</p>
  <p>I went slowly toward home, when I had an inspiration. Hastening into my
    own house, I flew to the telephone and called Vicky&rsquo;s number, which
    I knew well.</p>
  <p>I waited some time for a response, but at last I heard Vicky&rsquo;s voice
    say, &ldquo;Who is it, please?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An impulse of protection for her, not for myself, led me to withhold my
    name. Nor did I speak hers.</p>
  <p>I said, &ldquo;This is the man who just left your house. I called up to
    offer help, if I can render you any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good of you,&rdquo; she returned, in a heartfelt way. &ldquo;I
    appreciate such kindness, but you can do nothing&mdash;nothing, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At least, talk to me a few minutes. I&rsquo;m so anxious about you.
    You are not implicated in the&mdash;in the matter, are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; she murmured, in such a serious voice,
    that my heart sank. &ldquo;What I did&mdash;or didn&rsquo;t do&mdash;must
    always remain a mystery. I cannot tell you&mdash;anything. Don&rsquo;t ask.
    And, if you would help me, try your best to have inquiries stopped. Can you
    do this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fear not. But can&rsquo;t I see you&mdash;somewhere&mdash;and we
    can talk plainly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you want to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you do believe in me? Do you hold me blameless?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I hesitated at this. I couldn&rsquo;t lie to her, nor could I rid my mind
    of the conviction of her guilt I said, &ldquo;I will, if you assure me that
    is the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t do that&mdash;good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a minute. Did you know the expected guest was coming under an
    assumed name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you know any Somers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you know&mdash;the real man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had met him once, at a dance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you like him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I neither liked nor disliked. He was an object of utter indifference
    to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why did you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush! You can never know. I can&rsquo;t tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t. Please believe I want to befriend you.&rdquo; The
    agony and fear in Vicky&rsquo;s voice thrilled me, and I desired only to
    shield and protect her. She was so young and alone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is good to have a friendly voice speak to me. But you can only
    forget me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, let me do something definite. Some errand of trust, some matter
    of confidence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean it? Will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gladly! What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then if you will collect my mail from the box at the door, after
    a few days&mdash;say, three days&mdash;and put it aside for me. You saw me
    get it to-night, I suppose, and it is a dangerous thing for me to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you&mdash;I mean, where are you staying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask. I am safe. I see the newspapers and I know I am
    to be hunted down. So I must hide. I cannot face the inquiries&mdash;I fear
    arrest and&mdash;and punishment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her tones betrayed guilty fear, and I shuddered at the confirmation of my
    suspicions. But I would do what I could for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How shall I get your letters?&rdquo; I asked, and I honestly tried
    not to disclose my sudden knowledge of her guilt. But her quick ears caught
    my changed inflection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You believe me guilty!&rdquo; she said, and she stifled a sob. &ldquo;Yet,
    still, you will help me! God bless you! Listen, then, for I must stop this
    talking, it is too desperately dangerous. I will leave the key of the mail
    box&mdash;no, I will send it to you by mail, that will be the safest. Then
    will you get the letters and put them&mdash;where shall I say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mail them to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, that would never do. You can get into this house, can&rsquo;t
    you? The police will let you in at any time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I can probably manage that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then bring them with you, all of the three days&rsquo; mail at once,
    you understand, and put them in that great Chinese jar, in the music room.
    The one with the gold dragon on the cover. No one will look there for them.
    I will manage to come and get them very soon. Please don&rsquo;t spy on me,
    will you, Chester?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The use of my first name was, I knew, inadvertent and unconscious. It thrilled
    me. There was a marvellous fascination always about Vicky Van, and now, at
    the end of this my mysterious night telephone conversation, I felt its thrill
    and I agreed to her plea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; I said, and not till afterward did I realize the
    term I had used, &ldquo;I will not spy. But promise me that you will call
    on me for any help you may need. And tell me&mdash;are you alone or is Julie
    with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Julie is with me,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;She helps protect me,
    and with your friendship, too, I am blessed indeed. But this is good-bye.
    I shall leave New York in a few days never to return. I must have that mail,
    or I would go at once. If you will help me get that, you will do all there
    is left for any one to do for me in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her tone frightened me. &ldquo;Vicky!&rdquo; I cried, forgetting all caution. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;my
    dear, don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; but I could not put in words the fear that
    had suddenly come to me, and even as I stammered for speech, the click came
    that told me she had hung up the receiver.</p>
  <p>I cursed myself for my stupidity in speaking her name. Such a blunder! Why,
    it might have been overheard by anybody on the line. No wonder she left me.
    Doubtless I had driven her from her house.</p>
  <p>I flew to the window. Then I remembered I had promised not to spy, and I
    turned quickly away. If she were about to disappear silently and stealthily
    from that house, I must not know it.</p>
  <p>I went to my room, but not to sleep. Clearly, I was not to know untroubled
    slumber again very soon. I sat up and thought it all over.</p>
  <p>How strange that I should have &ldquo;spied&rdquo; on her just at the moment
    she was secretly getting her letters. But, I realized, I had looked at the
    house so often it would be stranger still if I had missed her!</p>
  <p>And she was to send me her box key, and I was to secrete her letters for
    her. Important indeed, those letters must be, that she should go to such
    lengths to get them. Well, I had constituted myself her knight errant in
    that particular, and I would fulfil the trust.</p>
  <p>Beneath the thrilling excitement of the night&rsquo;s occurrence, I felt
    a dull, sad foreboding. All Vicky had said or done pointed to guilt. Had
    she been innocent, she would have told me so, by word or by implication.
    She would have given me a tacit assurance of her guiltlessness, or would
    have cried out at the injustice of suspicion.</p>
  <p>But none of these things entered into her talk, or even into her voice or
    intonations. She had sounded sad, hopeless, despairing. And her last words
    made me fear she contemplated taking her own life.</p>
  <p>Poor little Vicky Van. Light-hearted, joy-loving Vicky. What was the mystery
    back of it all? What could it be? Well, at least, I would scrupulously perform
    the task she had set me, and I would do it well. I knew I could manage to
    get into the house by making up some story for the police. But I must wait
    for the promised key.</p>
  <p>With a glimmer of hope that the mailed parcel containing the key might give
    me a clue to Vicky&rsquo;s whereabouts, I at last went to sleep.</p>
  <p>Next morning at breakfast I said nothing of my night experiences. I told
    Winnie, however, that she needn&rsquo;t watch the Van Allen house, as I had
    heard that Vicky had left it permanently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;However could you hear that?&rdquo; exclaimed my wideawake sister. &ldquo;Have
    you had a wireless from the fugitive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something of the sort,&rdquo; I said, smilingly. &ldquo;And now,
    listen here, Win. How do you think that friend of yours, Miss Crowell, would
    like to be a social secretary for Mrs. Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d love it!&rdquo; cried Winnie. &ldquo;Does Mrs. Schuyler
    want one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and she wants her mighty quick. From what you&rsquo;ve said
    of the Crowell girl, I should think she&rsquo;d be just the one. Can you
    get her on the telephone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but not so early as this. I&rsquo;ll call her about ten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, you fix it up. I expect Mrs. Schuyler will pay proper
    salary to the right secretary. Of course, Miss Crowell is experienced?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; assured Win, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll
    love to go. Why, any secretary would be glad to go there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not just now, I should think,&rdquo; observed Aunt Lucy. &ldquo;The
    amount of work there must be something fearful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will be heavy, for a time,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;but it is only
    for Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s personal correspondence and business. I mean, the
    other two ladies would not expect to use her services.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Winnie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix it up with Edith
    Crowell, and if she can&rsquo;t go, I&rsquo;ll ask her to recommend somebody.
    Shall I send her there to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, as soon as she will go. And let me know&mdash;telephone the
    office about noon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Winnie promised, and I went away, my head in a whirl
    with the various and sundry matters I had to attend to.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t think I thought of the secretary matter again, until at noon,
    Winnie telephoned me that it was all right. I thanked her, and promptly forgot
    the episode.</p>
  <p>And so it was, that when I reached home that night, I had one of the surprises
    of my life.</p>
  <p>Winnie came to dinner, smiling, and rather excited-looking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Infant?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Have you accepted
    a proposal from a nice college lad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; and Win&rsquo;s head tossed. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll
    open your eyes when I tell you what I have accepted!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell it out, Angel Child. Relieve your own impatience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, if you please, I have accepted the post of social secretary
    to Mrs. Randolph Schuyler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Winifred Elizabeth Calhoun! You haven&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d arouse some slight interest,&rdquo; she said,
    and she calmly went on with her dinner.</p>
  <p>I looked at Aunt Lucy, who sat with a resigned expression, toying with her
    unused oyster-fork.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does she mean?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She has done just what she says,&rdquo; replied Aunt Lucy. &ldquo;But
    only for a few days. Miss Crowell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me tell!&rdquo; interrupted Winnie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my party!
    You see, Chet, Edith Crowell is wild to have the place, and is going to take
    it, but she can&rsquo;t go until the first of next week. And she doesn&rsquo;t
    want to lose the chance, so I went over and told Mrs. Schuyler about it.
    And then as she was simply swamped with letters and telegrams and telephones
    and callers, and goodness knows what all, I offered to help her out till
    Edith can get there. And she was so grateful&mdash;oh, I think she is a darling.
    I never saw anyone I liked and admired so much at first sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is charming,&rdquo; I conceded, &ldquo;but what a crazy scheme,
    Win! How did you persuade Aunt Lucy to agree?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I managed her,&rdquo; and Winnie bobbed her wise young head, cannily.</p>
  <p>It came to me in a moment. Though not exactly a tuft hunter, Aunt Lucy was
    deeply impressed by real grandeur and elegance. And it came to me at once,
    that Winnie&rsquo;s tales of the great house and the aristocratic people,
    had a strong influence on our aunt&rsquo;s views and had brought about her
    permission for Win to go there for a few days. And it was no harm. It wasn&rsquo;t
    as if Winnie were a regular secretary, but just to hold the place for Miss
    Crowell, was simply a kindly deed.</p>
  <p>And so, after dinner, I settled myself in our cosy library for a comfortable
    smoke, and bade Winnie tell me every single thing that had happened through
    the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it was thrilling!&rdquo; Winnie exclaimed. &ldquo;Part of the
    time I was at the desk in the library, and part of the time upstairs in Mrs.
    Schuyler&rsquo;s very own room. She was so kind to me, but she is nearly
    distracted and I don&rsquo;t wonder! The undertakers&rsquo; men were in and
    out, and those two old maids&mdash;his sisters, you know&mdash;were everlastingly
    appearing and disappearing. And they don&rsquo;t like Mrs. Schuyler an awful
    lot, nor she them. Oh, they&rsquo;re polite and all that, but you can see
    they&rsquo;re of totally different types. I like Mrs. Schuyler heaps better,
    but still, there&rsquo;s something about the old girls that&rsquo;s the real
    thing. They&rsquo;re Schuylers and also they&rsquo;re Salton-stalls, and
    farther back, I believe they&rsquo;re Cabots or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Schuyler, what is she?&rdquo; I asked, as Win paused for
    breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Nothing particular, I guess. Oh, yes, I learned
    her name was Ellison before she was married, but the sisters don&rsquo;t
    consult her about family matters at all. They do about clothes, though. And
    she knows a lot. Why, Chess, she&rsquo;s having the loveliest things made,
    if they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;mourning, and the sisters, they ask her about
    everything they order&mdash;to wear, I mean. And, just think! Mrs. Schuyler
    never wears any jewels but pearls! It&rsquo;s a whim, you know, or it was
    her husband&rsquo;s whim, or something, but anyway, she has oceans of pearls,
    and no other gems at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did she tell you so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but it came in the conversation, you know. She is no boaster.
    No sir-ee! She&rsquo;s the modestest, gentlest, sweetest little lady I ever
    saw. I just love her! Well, I answered a lot of letters for her, and she
    liked the way I did it, and she liked me, I guess, for she said she only
    hoped Miss Crowell would suit her as well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She knows you&rsquo;re my sister?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course. But that isn&rsquo;t why she likes me, old bunch of conceit!
    Though, I must admit, she likes you, Chet. She said you were not only kind,
    but you have a fair amount of intelligence&mdash;no, she didn&rsquo;t use
    those words, exactly, but I gathered that was what she meant. The funeral
    is to be tomorrow evening, you know. I had to write and telephone quite a
    good deal about that, though the sisters tended to it mostly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was there much said about&mdash;about the actual case&mdash;Winnie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean about the murder?&rdquo; Win&rsquo;s clear eyes didn&rsquo;t
    blink at the word; &ldquo;no, not much in my hearing. But Mrs. Schuyler wasn&rsquo;t
    in the room all the time. And I know Mr. Lowney&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he the
    detective?&mdash;was there once, and I think, twice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you see anyone else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only some of the servants. Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s own maid, her name
    is Tibbetts, is the sort you read about in English novels. A nice, motherly
    woman, with gray hair and a black silk apron. I liked her, but the maid who
    looks after the old sisters, I didn&rsquo;t like so well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind the maids, tell me more about Mrs. Schuyler. Does she
    think Vicky Van killed Mr. Schuyler? Since you&rsquo;re in this thing so
    deep Win, there&rsquo;s no use mincing matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should say not! Yes, of course, she thinks the Vicky person did
    the killing. How could she think anything else? And the two sisters are madly
    revengeful. As soon as the funeral is over, they&rsquo;re going to work to
    find that girl and bring her to justice! They say the inquest will help a
    lot. When will that be, Chess? Can I go to it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, of course not, Winnie?&rdquo; This from Aunt Lucy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    one thing for you to help Mrs. Schuyler out in an emergency, but you&rsquo;re
    not to get mixed up in a murder trial!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An inquest isn&rsquo;t a trial, Auntie,&rdquo; and Win looked like
    a wise owl, as she aired her new and suddenly acquired knowledge. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
    I go, Chess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see, Infant. Perhaps, if Mrs. Schuyler needs your services
    she may want you there with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, in that case&mdash;&rdquo; began Aunt Lucy, but Winnie was off
    again on one of her enthusiastic descriptions of the grand ways of the Schuyler
    household, and Aunt Lucy was quite willing to listen.</p>
  <p>As for me, I wanted the benefit of every possible sidelight on the whole
    business, and I, too, took in all Winnie&rsquo;s detailed narrations.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter10TheInquest"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  The Inquest</strong></h2>
  <p>The inquest was in progress. In the coroner&rsquo;s courtroom inquiry was
    being made in an endeavor to discover who was responsible for the death of
    Randolph Schuyler. The funeral of the millionaire had taken place, and the
    will had been read, and now the public awaited news of the action of the
    police in placing the crime and producing the criminal.</p>
  <p>The case had become a celebrated one, not only because of the prominence
    of the victim, but because of the mystery surrounding the young woman suspected
    of the deed of murder.</p>
  <p>Many voluntary witnesses had come forward with additional information regarding
    Victoria Van Allen, but none of these knew anything more of her relatives
    or progenitors than I did myself.</p>
  <p>Some of these were asked to testify at the inquest, but more were not so
    called on, as their testimony was in no way material or vital.</p>
  <p>I did not propose to attend all the sessions, myself, but I wanted to hear
    the opening queries and learn just how the case was to be managed.</p>
  <p>Doctor Remson told of his examination of Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s body and testified
    that death was practically instantaneous as a result of a single stab of
    the short, sharp knife. The knife was produced and identified. It had been
    carefully taken care of and had been photographed to preserve the faint fingermarks,
    which were on its handle, and which might or might not be the prints of the
    murderer&rsquo;s fingers.</p>
  <p>The caterer Fraschini told of his orders for the party supper, and of the
    sending of his best and most faithful waiters to attend to the feast.</p>
  <p>Luigi, the head waiter, again went over his story. I had heard this twice
    before, but I listened with deep interest, and I realized, that, granting
    the truth of his recital, there was no room for doubt of Vicky Van&rsquo;s
    guilt.</p>
  <p>I hadn&rsquo;t of course, told of seeing her take her mail from the box
    that night, nor of her talking to me over the telephone. Should absolute
    law and justice call for that information, I might give it up, but at present,
    I was awaiting developments.</p>
  <p>Vicky had sent me her mailbox key, and I had received it duly, by mail.
    It was not sent by parcel post, nor was it registered&mdash;these would have
    called for the sender&rsquo;s address&mdash;but, sent by ordinary first-class
    letter post, the flat little key came duly and promptly.</p>
  <p>I had not used it yet, the time was not ripe until that same night, and
    I intended to say nothing of it, until I had fulfilled my promise, if, indeed,
    I ever told of it.</p>
  <p>But Luigi&rsquo;s story as I heard it again made me shiver with apprehension.
    Surely, since he saw Vicky right there at the moment, bending over the victim,
    blood stains on her gown, there could be no loophole of innocence. Had the
    murderer been some one else, and had Vicky known it, she must have made an
    outcry&mdash;must have accused the guilty party. There was no one whom Vicky
    loved well enough to wish to shield. And, too, the guests were all in the
    big living-room; there was no one unaccounted for. If Luigi himself, or any
    of the caterer&rsquo;s men had by chance done the deed, Vicky wouldn&rsquo;t
    have run away! There was no sense in that. So I could see no possible theory
    but that of Vicky&rsquo;s actual guilt. Why she did it, was another story.
    She may have known Schuyler before, might have known him a long time, might
    have had her own reasons for wishing him dead; but all that was outside the
    issue of her criminality. There was no eyewitness of the stabbing itself,
    but Luigi&rsquo;s presence on the scene an instant later, left no room for
    question as to the hand that had held the knife.</p>
  <p>The jury seemed to think this. Gravely the men listened to what the Italian
    told, and their faces showed what they believed.</p>
  <p>Then came the guests of the party. One after another, they told the same
    story. All knew Vicky fairly well, as a pleasant acquaintance; all liked
    her as a good friend; all enjoyed her as a delightful hostess; and many told
    individual instances of Vicky&rsquo;s kind heart and helping hand. Not infrequently
    had she lent assistance, both financial and in other ways, to these friends
    of hers. Never, they all said, had they known her to do a mean or deceitful
    act or to say an unkind or malicious word.</p>
  <p>The men spoke of her as a gay, light-hearted butterfly girl, who was a coquette,
    but who stopped short of a real flirtation; the women gave her such commendation
    as is rarely given them to their own sex, and declared that Miss Van Allen
    was a simple, kindly, generous nature without a trace of the disposition
    which causes a woman to be dubbed a&nbsp;<em>cat</em>.</p>
  <p>Norman Steele was present. He explained his sudden departure from the party
    by the fact that he had to catch an owl train for Chicago. He said, further,
    that Randolph Schuyler had asked him to take him around to Vicky Van&rsquo;s,
    as he wanted to meet her. But he had asked Steele, especially, to introduce
    him as Mr. Somers. He had given no reason for this, and Steele had thought
    little of it. Randolph Schuyler was a man whom his friends obeyed, often
    without question. I understood this. Steele was no more of a toady to the
    millionaire than most men would be; but a request of Randolph Schuyler&rsquo;s
    was not to be thoughtlessly refused, so Steele acquiesced.</p>
  <p>He was reticent in further dilating on Schuyler&rsquo;s character. Said
    he often called on ladies who could not be called exclusive, but denied knowledge
    of definite cases or names.</p>
  <p>On the whole, Steele&rsquo;s evidence didn&rsquo;t get us anywhere. We already
    knew that Schuyler had gone to Vicky Van&rsquo;s under an assumed name. The
    reason for this had little, if anything, to do with what had followed. A
    connection of some sort, between Vicky and Mr. Schuyler must be traced, in
    order to arrive at her possible motive. A woman does not stab to kill a chance
    guest whom she has never met before!</p>
  <p>Bert Garrison came next. His talk ran mostly to eulogies of Vicky. The poor
    fellow was dead in love with her, and had been for many moons, but though
    Vicky favored him more than some others, yet she gave him no definite encouragement,
    as he himself ruefully admitted. But he made a desperate effort to show that
    a girl of Victoria Van Allen&rsquo;s high character and fine qualities would
    be incapable of a base deed.</p>
  <p>The coroner smiled a little at Garrison&rsquo;s vehemence, and let him run
    on for a time, in praise of the absent Vicky.</p>
  <p>At last, he said, &ldquo;And, why, then, Mr. Garrison, in your opinion has
    Miss Van Allen disappeared?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The disappearance is not of her own volition,&rdquo; declared Garrison; &ldquo;she
    has been taken away by somebody and held against her will, in order to make
    her appear guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was a new theory. I might have given it serious consideration had I
    not had speech with the girl herself. It couldn&rsquo;t be that Vicky was
    held captive, since she was at her own house two nights after the crime.
    But I could see that the jury, and even the coroner and detectives were interested
    in this idea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By whom could she possibly, or theoretically, he thus held?&rdquo; the
    coroner asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But assuming some intruder effected an entrance
    and stabbed Mr. Schuyler, if surprised during or after the act by the sudden
    appearance of Miss Van Allen in the dining room, he might in some way have
    gotten her out of the house, and still be keeping her in a hiding-place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was perhaps, a possibility, but I didn&rsquo;t see how any intruder could
    do all that, without being seen by the waiters. Unless, perchance, the waiters
    had been bribed to silence. And that, in the face of Luigi&rsquo;s earnest,
    and convincing testimony, I could not believe.</p>
  <p>It was a fantastic theory, evolved in the brain of Garrison, for the purpose
    of diverting suspicion from Vicky Van. However, it seemed to impress the
    coroner, and he made notes as he dismissed the witness.</p>
  <p>Cassie Weldon added one bit of new information. She said, though with evident
    reluctance, that she had caught a mere glimpse of somebody running upstairs,
    just before the waiter had come to call for help.</p>
  <p>Cassie had not wanted to testify at all. As she had intimated to me, it
    was detrimental to her work as a concert singer to be mixed up in this affair.
    But since she had to give her testimony, she apparently felt it her duty
    to tell the whole truth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How could you see the stairs from the living-room?&rdquo; asked the
    interested coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was near the door, and though I was not looking out into the hall,
    I had a vague, fleeting impression of somebody running upstairs. I paid no
    attention to it, of course, but I am sure somebody did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A man or a woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A woman. That is, I was conscious of a flutter of skirts, but I am
    not sure it was Miss Van Allen. I didn&rsquo;t see her clearly enough even
    to notice the color of her gown. It was merely a glimpse of some one flying
    round the newel post and up the stairs. It might have been a stranger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean, if there were some intruder, it may have been a woman,
    and not a man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I tell you. I can only say I know somebody ran
    upstairs. Further than that, I&rsquo;ve no idea concerning it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It must have been Miss Van Allen,&rdquo; said the coroner, decidedly; &ldquo;had
    it been any other woman, and had she stabbed Mr. Schuyler, Miss Van Allen
    would not have disappeared. Now, if this woman who ran upstairs was Miss
    Van Allen, she effected an escape from the upper stories. Is there a skylight
    exit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No one seemed to know, as no one had thought of Vicky Van leaving her house
    by such means.</p>
  <p>But to me, the idea was ridiculous. A girl, in elaborate evening gown, clambering
    out of a skylight trap-door, to where? Not to a neighbor&rsquo;s, for Vicky
    Van knew none of the nearby residents. I had heard her say so, myself. And
    had she descended into a strange household, and begged for shelter, it would
    have become known before this.</p>
  <p>Well, anyway, the detective Lowney immediately sent an order to have the
    skylight matter looked into and the proceedings went on.</p>
  <p>Ariadne Gale was closely questioned as to how she knew of the picture in
    the back of Randolph Schuyler&rsquo;s watch. But she declared that he had
    shown it to her during their conversation that evening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never saw the man before,&rdquo; said Ariadne, who unlike Cassie
    Weldon, rather enjoyed the publicity of the occasion. &ldquo;I chanced to
    be about the first girl he was introduced to, when he came into the house.
    And we had a chat, and when I chaffed him a bit on his dignity and awe-inspiring
    presence, he refuted it by showing me the picture in his watch. He said it
    was a little chorus girl he had taken out to supper the night before. I could
    see the picture had been merely tucked in temporarily, it wasn&rsquo;t neatly
    pasted in, as a watch-case picture usually is, and then I chaffed him on
    his fickleness. Our conversation was the merest foolery, and a moment after,
    he went over to be presented to Miss Van Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You think they had never met before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they had not. They looked at each other with the conventional
    politeness of strangers, I know Miss Van Allen well, and she is not one to
    dissemble or pretend. I am sure she had never laid eyes on that man before.
    She simply&nbsp;<em>couldn&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;have killed him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ariadne&rsquo;s further evidence amounted to nothing, nor did that of several
    other of the party guests who were called on.</p>
  <p>Except Mrs. Reeves. She knew more of Vicky&rsquo;s home life than any of
    the rest of us, but even she knew nothing of the girl&rsquo;s origin.</p>
  <p>She had first met her at one of Miss Gale&rsquo;s studio parties, and had
    taken a fancy to her at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where did&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;first meet her, Miss Gale,&rdquo; the
    coroner interrupted to ask.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She came to my studio to look at my pictures,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;She
    admired them, and bought one. She was so pleasant and so interested in my
    work that she came two or three times, and then I invited her to one of my
    little studio affairs. She quickly made friends, and she invited us to her
    house. I went there first about two years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; Mrs. Reeves resumed. &ldquo;And since then, I have
    been there frequently, and every time I saw the girl I liked her better.
    But she was always a bit of a mystery. I confess I tried at times, to learn
    something of her previous life. But she adroitly evaded my questions, and
    cleverly changed the subject. I think, however, from chance hints she let
    drop, that her home was somewhere in the Middle West.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An indefinite term,&rdquo; observed Coroner Fenn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where did Miss Van Allen go on her frequent absences from her home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t know, either. Often she&rsquo;d be away a week,
    and on her return would tell of a gay house party down on Long Island or
    a week-end trip up Westchester way, but I don&rsquo;t remember any definite
    place she visited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; piped up Ariadne. &ldquo;She often goes to Greenwich,
    Connecticut, and to Bronxville. I&rsquo;ve heard her tell of these trips.
    She has a wide circle of acquaintances and, of course, she&rsquo;s a favorite
    with all who know her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have a piece of evidence,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Reeves, &ldquo;which
    I daresay I ought to exhibit. It is a letter from Miss Van Allen, which I
    received only this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This caused a sensation. A letter from Vicky Van! Just received! I found
    myself trembling in my shoes. And I asked myself why. Was I afraid the girl
    would be caught? Did I want to shield a felon? And I had to admit to myself
    that I did. I wasn&rsquo;t in love with Vicky Van, but I had a tremendous
    interest in her, and I didn&rsquo;t want that little lone, helpless person
    haled before a court of justice. Vicky did seem terribly alone. Hosts of
    friends she had, but no one who was in any way responsible for her, or in
    a position to help her. Well, if she ever returned, voluntarily or perforce,
    she would find a friend and champion in one Chester Calhoun, of that I was
    certain!</p>
  <p>Mrs. Reeves handed her letter over to the coroner, and he read it out. It
    ran:</p>
  <p>My dear Mrs. Reeves: You have always been such a good friend to me that
    I&rsquo;m writing you just a line. You are everything that is good and kind,
    and now I&rsquo;m going to ask you as a final favor to forget Vicky Van at
    once and forever. I am going away and I shall never return. Don&rsquo;t think
    of me any more hardly than you must, but if you can keep any loving little
    memory of the hours we spent together, I want you to do so. And as a remembrance,
    I want you to have my little electric coupe. It is in Rennard&rsquo;s garage,
    and I have written him to turn it over to you. I shall miss our happy times
    together, but&mdash;I can never come back. Do not worry about me, I am safe.
    And I am your affectionate Vicky Van.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are sure this is from Miss Van Allen?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistaking
    that writing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nor was there. I knew Vicky&rsquo;s penmanship, and it was most peculiar.
    Never have I seen such a hand. Angular, slightly backhanded, and full of
    character, it would be difficult to imitate it, and, too, no one would have
    any reason to forge that letter to Mrs. Reeves. She had verified Vicky&rsquo;s
    statement, and found that a letter to the garage owner had instructed him
    to give up the car to Mrs. Reeves, and he had already done so, that very
    morning.</p>
  <p>The letters had both been mailed in New York the night before, the postmark
    showing that they were mailed in the district that included Vicky&rsquo;s
    residence.</p>
  <p>Was she, then, even now in hiding near her home? Or, had she sent the letters
    to be mailed by some one else? By Julie, perhaps, who, I felt sure, was with
    her mistress, wherever that might be.</p>
  <p>My leaping thoughts took in all this, and by degrees the slower going coroner,
    put it in words.</p>
  <p>Lowney, the detective, bristled with interest. A clue, he had, he thought,
    but what a clue! Two letters posted in the city. What did they show of the
    whereabouts of the missing girl?</p>
  <p>Lowney scrutinized the one to Mrs. Reeves. Ordinary paper, such as might
    be bought in any stationery or department store, no monogram or initial on
    it, nor was there any maker&rsquo;s name under the flap.</p>
  <p>But a dozen people present testified to Vicky&rsquo;s handwriting, and the
    coroner eagerly took possession of the letter.</p>
  <p>Sherlock Holmes, I thought to myself, would read that letter, look at it
    through his good old lens, smell it, and then walk out, and return in a half
    hour, with Vicky Van in tow!</p>
  <p>But for my part, I could see nothing illuminating in that plain paper and
    envelope, and the letter in the well-known penmanship.</p>
  <p>All I gathered was, that wherever Vicky was, she was not only safe but comfortable.
    The tenor of the note breathed leisure and composure. Clearly, she was not
    breathlessly hurrying from one place to another, or vigilantly eluding pursuit.
    She was at ease, with opportunity to indulge in thoughtful kindness to a
    friend, and to write at length about herself.</p>
  <p>At length, yes, but with no hint of her hiding-place nor any clue to it.
    Poor little Vicky! She seemed so alone&mdash;and yet&mdash;how did I know?
    She may have gone to friends or&mdash;somehow I hated to think that she had
    any man who was her legal&mdash;or even willing protector.</p>
  <p>Yet she said she was safe, and her letter showed no fear of the future.
    And then again I was stabbed by the thought that perhaps there was no earthly
    future for Vicky Van. I didn&rsquo;t want her to kill herself&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t
    want her to be found and arrested&mdash;what did I want? I wasn&rsquo;t sure
    in my own mind, save that I wanted her safety above all else. I suppose I
    believed her guilty&mdash;I could believe nothing else, but even so, I didn&rsquo;t
    want her brought to bay.</p>
  <p>I gave my own testimony, which was all true, and all frank, except that
    I said nothing of my nocturnal visit to Vicky&rsquo;s house or of our telephone
    conversation. If my conscience smote me I combated it with my chivalry, which
    would not allow me to betray a woman into the hands of the law.</p>
  <p>The later witnesses, who were mostly the working people whom Vicky employed
    by the day, told nothing of her or of her home life. They all spoke of her
    as a kind lady to work for, though, as a rule, they had not seen her, but
    had been engaged, directed and paid by the maid, Julie.</p>
  <p>It seemed to be tacitly assumed that wherever Vicky was Julie was with her.
    I had had this information from Vicky herself, but others took it for granted,
    in the absence of any reason to think the contrary.</p>
  <p>The whole day&rsquo;s session, to my mind, achieved little of useful information.
    Mrs. Reeves&rsquo; letter proved conclusively that Vicky was aware of the
    search being made for her, and showed her determination not to be found.
    It was Saturday, and when the inquest was adjourned until Monday morning,
    I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling that it might as well have been permanently
    adjourned, for all the further conclusions it would lead to.</p>
  <p>I went home at last, thrilling with the thought that that night I was to
    get Vicky&rsquo;s mail from her box and hide it where she had directed. I
    secretly hoped she might be in the house herself, waiting for it, but scarcely
    dared believe this would be the case.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter11ANoteFromVicky"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  A Note From Vicky</strong></h2>
  <p>Nor was it. I had secured a latch-key to the house, from the police, who
    were willing enough for me to search for possible clues, as I had told them
    I would do.</p>
  <p>At their wits&rsquo; end to locate Vicky Van, they welcomed my help and
    felt that as a friend of hers, I might learn more than a disinterested policeman
    could.</p>
  <p>So, well after midnight, watching my chance when the patrolman had just
    passed on his regular round, I went across the street.</p>
  <p>Easily I opened the mailbox and extracted a quantity of letters.</p>
  <p>Quietly, then, I opened the house door and went in.</p>
  <p>I had provided myself with a pocket flashlight, as I didn&rsquo;t want to
    illuminate the house, and I went at once to the music room, to perform my
    errand.</p>
  <p>How strange it seemed! The lovely room, with dainty white and gold furnishings,
    reminded me so forcibly of the bewitching girl who owned it all. A thousand
    questions rose in my mind. What would become of that bijou residence? The
    bric-a-brac and pictures, the rugs and furniture, while not magnificent,
    were of the best, and many of them costly. The great Chinese vase, into which
    I was to drop the letters was a gem of its kind, though not anything a connoisseur
    would covet.</p>
  <p>I raised the dragon-topped lid, and let the letters fall in. Replacing the
    lid, I still lingered. My errand was done, but I felt an impulse to stay.
    Everything spoke to me of Vicky Van. Where was she now? Making sure that
    the opaque blinds were drawn, I dared to turn on one tiny electric lamp.
    The faint light made the shadowed room lovelier than ever. Could a girl of
    such cultivated tastes and such refinement of character be a&mdash;a wrong-doer?
    I couldn&rsquo;t say murderer even to myself. Then my common sense flared
    up, and told me that crime is no respecter of persons. That women who had
    slain human beings were not necessarily of this or that walk of life. Granted
    a woman had a motive to kill a man, that motive lay in the impulses of her
    feminine nature, and revenge, jealousy, fear, love or hate&mdash;whatever
    the motive, it was of deep and over-powering and might find its root in equal
    likeliness in the breast of queen or beggarmaid. I could not say Vicky was
    incapable of crime&mdash;indeed, her gay, volatile manner might hide a deeply
    perturbed spirit. She was an enigma, and I&mdash;I must solve the riddle.
    I felt I should never rest, until I knew the truth, and if Vicky were a martyr
    to circumstances, or a victim to Fate, I must know all about it.</p>
  <p>Alone there, in the midnight hours, I resolved to devote my time, all I
    could spare, my energies, all I could command, and my life, so far as I might,
    to the discovery of the truth, and I might or might not reveal my findings
    as seemed to me best.</p>
  <p>Leaving the music room, I went back through the long hall, and passed the
    door of Vicky&rsquo;s bedroom. Reverently I looked inside. The very walls
    seemed crying for her to come back. Would she ever so do? I wandered on through
    the bedroom, and even looked in the dressing room. I felt no compunction.
    It was not from idle curiosity, rather, I walked as one at a shrine. The
    exquisitely feminine boudoir was a mute witness to a love of beauty and art.
    I used only my flashlight, but on an impulse, I turned on one light by the
    side of the long mirror. I looked in it, as Vicky must often have done when
    dressing for her parties, as, indeed, she must have done, when dressing that
    last fatal night and seeing my own grim reflection, I gravely nodded my head
    at myself, and whispered, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find the truth, old man, you
    see if we don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the ornate Florentine frame, with its branching arabesques, was a strand
    of the gold beads that had adorned Vicky&rsquo;s gown that night. I visualized
    her, whirling her skirts about before the mirror, with that quick, lithe
    grace of hers, and catching the fluttering fringe in the gilt protuberance.
    Perhaps she exclaimed in petulance, but, more likely, I thought, she laughed
    at the trivial accident. That was Vicky Van, as I knew her, to laugh at a
    mischance, and smile good-naturedly at an accident.</p>
  <p>I lifted the strand of little beads from the entangling frame, and put it
    away in my pocketbook, as a dear and intimate souvenir of the girl I had
    known. Then, with a final glance that was a sort of farewell, I glimpsed
    the pretty, cosy nest, and went downstairs.</p>
  <p>Here I paused again. Cassie Weldon had said she could see the staircase
    from the door of the living-room. I tried it. She was right. A person standing
    just inside the living-room door, could catch sight of a person on the stairs.
    And, as Cassie, said, she was not looking that way, but was partly conscious
    of some one running up the stairs. It might well be. She would naturally
    give the incident no thought at the moment&mdash;it was strange she had even
    remembered it. And it may have been Vicky. Then she might have descended
    by the rear staircase, there probably was one, I didn&rsquo;t know. And anyway,
    what mattered it how she had left the house? She had left it, and had not
    returned.</p>
  <p>I remembered the allusion to the skylight. In a jiffy, I had run upstairs
    clear to the highest story. There was a skylight, or scuttle, rather, and
    it was bolted on the inside.</p>
  <p>That settled that. Vicky Van had not climbed out that way, and I for one,
    never supposed she had.</p>
  <p>Strangely reluctant to leave the house, I went downstairs again, looked
    into the living-room, and passed on to the dining-room. I contemplated the
    sideboard, in front of which Randolph Schuyler had met his death. Many pieces
    of silver and glass stood upon it, and all was in order, as if it had been
    carefully looked after for the party occasion.</p>
  <p>Without consciously noting details, I chanced to observe that a small silver-handled
    carving fork, was lacking its knife. I had no knowledge of Vicky Van&rsquo;s
    table appurtenances, but the way the fork lay looked to me as if the knife
    had lain across it, and had been removed.</p>
  <p>I had no concern over it, for I knew the knife that had stabbed Schuyler
    was now in possession of the police, and this one had doubtless been used
    in preparation of the supper, if indeed, there was a knife belonging to the
    fork.</p>
  <p>It was a matter of no moment, but somehow it stuck in my mind. If Vicky
    or rather, if Julie had straightened up things on the sideboard in the process
    of tidying up for the party, would she not have laid the fork a different
    way, unless there had been a matching knife to lay across it? I suppose the
    whole question came into my mind, because at home, we had a beefsteak carving
    set that always lay crossed on the sideboard. A man gets accustomed to the
    sight of such household details, and they photographed on his memory.</p>
  <p>Well, anyway, I looked for that knife. I even went to the butler&rsquo;s
    pantry and looked, but I didn&rsquo;t see it. The pantry had been hastily
    evacuated by the caterer&rsquo;s men, and though tidied, it was not in spick
    and span condition. You see, having lived so long with two such homey bodies
    as Aunt Lucy and Win, I was not utterly unversed in domestic matters. The
    pantry was well equipped with modern utensils and implements, and all its
    appointments spoke of the taste and efficiency of its mistress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Vicky,&rdquo; I sighed to myself, &ldquo;poor, dear little Vicky
    Van!&rdquo; and then I went softly out of the front door and down the steps.</p>
  <p>I went slowly, and looked back several times, in a vague hope that Vicky
    might emerge from some nearby shadow and go into the house for her letters.
    But I saw no sign of such a happening, and went on home, my heart full of
    a gloomy foreboding that I would never see her again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going to work on Sunday, Winnie?&rdquo; I asked, as next morning,
    my sister appeared, garbed for the street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not regularly to work, but Mrs. Schuyler wants me to look after some
    matters of confidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oho, how important we are!&rdquo; I chaffed her. &ldquo;When does
    the Crowell lady come into her own?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not for another week. She isn&rsquo;t quite ready to come, and Mrs.
    Schuyler is willing to keep me on a while longer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame her,&rdquo; and I looked at my pretty, bright-faced
    sister with approval. &ldquo;I say, old girl, s&rsquo;pose I stroll over
    with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come along. Though I&rsquo;m not sure Mrs. Schuyler will see you.
    She usually sends me to receive callers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Little Miss Manage-It, I could even live through that. And
    perhaps I&rsquo;ll get a look-in with the fair sisters-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That, surely, if you wish. They&rsquo;re ready and eager to see visitors.
    I believe they love to go over the details of the whole affair with anyone
    who will listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Win, not as bad as that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s bad. They&rsquo;re bound to track
    down the Van Allen girl, and they hold the opinion that everybody they get
    hold of may be an important witness. They go over the reports from the inquest
    all the time, and can hardly wait till tomorrow to see what will come out
    next.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me for them,&rdquo; I responded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a good chat
    on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We went over to the Fifth Avenue house, and were admitted by the solemn
    and wise-eyed butler. I was shown to the library, while Winnie was directed
    to go to Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s room.</p>
  <p>But it was not long before we were all together in the library&mdash;widow,
    sisters, and all, for Lowney had made a discovery and he proposed to tell
    the family of it.</p>
  <p>Win and I were allowed to be present, and the detective showed his new find.</p>
  <p>It seems he had been searching the papers and letters of the late Mr. Schuyler.
    This had been not only permitted by the wife, but had been urged by the sisters,
    who hoped it might result in some further light on the mysterious Miss Van
    Allen. And it did. In the desk, in a secret compartment&mdash;which was not
    so secret but that the detective could open it&mdash;were a number of letters
    from feminine pens, and a number of receipted bills for jeweled trinkets,
    presumably sent to these or other ladies, for they were not of a sort affected
    by Ruth Schuyler or the two sisters. A blue enameled watch bracelet, and
    a rhinestone tiara were representative purchases entered on these bills.</p>
  <p>But the pile of letters sank into insignificance, when we learned the fact
    that there was a letter from Vicky Van among them!</p>
  <p>Regardless of Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s feelings, Lowney read the letter aloud.
    This was it:</p>
  <p>My Dear Mr. Schuyler:</p>
  <p>I enjoyed your supper party, and it was good of you to give me inside information
    about the stocks. But I must beg of you to cease your further attentions
    to me, as I cannot number on my list of calling acquaintances the husband
    of another woman. I am, perhaps, rather prudish in my view of life, but this
    is one of my inviolable rules.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Very truly yours, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victoria Van Allen.</p>
  <p>I knew that before. Vicky Van, living alone and unchaperoned, save for the
    ubiquitous Julie, flouted convention in many ways, but it was as she said,
    her inviolable rule to receive no married man without his wife at her parties.
    Nor was there often occasion for her to use this stipulation. The young people
    whom I had met at her house, had always been maids and bachelors, and now
    and then, a young married couple who playfully enacted a chaperon part. Mrs.
    Reeves, a widow, was probably the oldest of the crowd, but she was well under
    forty.</p>
  <p>It was quite true, no married man, and indeed, no man of the type or age
    of Randolph Schuyler, had ever, to my knowledge, enjoyed the friendship of
    Vicky Van. But not for a minute, did I think that she would go so far as
    to kill him for daring to enter her house! That was unthinkable.</p>
  <p>And yet, it seemed so to Lowney, and, apparently, to the sisters of the
    dead man.</p>
  <p>She declared that the letter proved that Randolph had intruded on her acquaintance,
    and she had objected from coyness or coquetry; and that when he persisted,
    she was so enraged that she flew into a passion and wilfully ended his life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think that,&rdquo; said Ruth Schuyler, wearily. &ldquo;It
    seems more to me as if that letter exculpates the girl. She was quite evidently
    not in love with my husband, and she honestly tried to make him understand
    her scruples. So I can&rsquo;t think she killed him. I did think so at first,
    of course, but on thinking things over, and in the light of this letter,
    I begin to believe her innocent. What date does the letter bear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no date,&rdquo; said Lowney, looking at the paper. &ldquo;It
    was not in an envelope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then how did it reach my husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, it came in an envelope, I suppose, but I found none
    with it. So we can&rsquo;t tell where it was sent, here or to one of his
    clubs or to his office address.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not here, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Schuyler. &ldquo;Probably
    to his club. You are quite welcome to the letter, Mr. Lowney. Make what use
    you think best of it. If it serves to establish Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s innocence,
    I shall be rather glad. But if it seems to throw further suspicion on her,
    then justice must be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, it throws suspicion on that woman!&rdquo; declared Miss
    Rhoda Schuyler, with a vindictive glance at the letter in Lowney&rsquo;s
    hand. &ldquo;The hussy, to write to Randolph at all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I interposed, unable to stand this unjust speech, &ldquo;Mr.
    Schuyler must have made advances to her first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She lured him on. I&rsquo;ve heard you say yourself, Mr. Calhoun,
    that this Van Allen person is a siren, a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, now, Miss Rhoda,&rdquo; I began, but the other sister chimed
    in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course she is! Of course, the wrong was mostly hers. And she killed
    Randolph, I know it! Why, the waiter man saw her! Go ahead, Mr. Lowney, hunt
    her down, and bring her to account. I never shall sleep peacefully until
    my brother&rsquo;s death is avenged! I cannot understand, Ruth, how you can
    be so indifferent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A flush rose to Ruth Schuyler&rsquo;s cheek, and, enlightened anew to her
    husband&rsquo;s character by that letter, I began to feel a different sort
    of sympathy for the widow.</p>
  <p>Randolph Schuyler had been unfaithful, he had been domineering and tyrannical,
    and I knew he had not allowed his wife to have the comforts and luxuries
    she desired, although he was enormously wealthy.</p>
  <p>A social secretary, for instance. Most women of Ruth Schuyler&rsquo;s rank
    in society had that necessary assistant, yet, during Schuyler&rsquo;s life
    his wife was forbidden the favor.</p>
  <p>Winnie had told me this, and had told me much more, that proved how unjust
    and unkind Randolph Schuyler had been. The sisters, too, shared his views,
    and as a consequence, the household was run on old-fashioned lines that ill
    accord with the ways of to-day.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Schuyler had in no way complained, Win told me, but it was easily seen
    how matters stood. It fell to Winnie&rsquo;s lot to order many things from
    the shops&mdash;stationery, mourning apparel, and house needs. These, my
    sister said, were ordered with the most perfect taste, but with a lavishness,
    which was indubitably unusual to Ruth Schuyler.</p>
  <p>The sisters exclaimed at the extravagance, but Ruth, though listening politely,
    serenely went her own way, and carried out her own plans. In the matter of
    fresh flowers, she was like a child, Win said, and she enjoyed the blossoms
    she ordered as if she had hungered for them for years. Winnie was growing
    deeply attached to her employer, if that word is applicable, and Ruth Schuyler
    was fond of Win.</p>
  <p>But I am digressing. Mrs. Schuyler replied to her sister-in-law&rsquo;s
    speech by saying, gently, &ldquo;I am not indifferent, Sarah, but it seems
    to me we have no real evidence against the girl, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No real evidence! When she was caught red-handed! Or nearly caught!
    If that stupid waiter had had sense enough to jump and grab her, we would
    have had no search to make at all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be so, Sarah, you may be right. But until you do find her
    don&rsquo;t condemn her utterly. From what Mr. Calhoun has told me of her
    and from the tone of that letter she wrote to Randolph, I can&rsquo;t make
    it seem possible that she killed a man she knew so slightly. And yet, it
    may be she did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Lowney, &ldquo;the note proves that she had
    seen Mr. Schuyler before, anyway. Then, when he came to her house as Mr.
    Somers, she was naturally annoyed, as she had asked him not to do so. And
    all that is against the girl, I say. But it remains to be seen what the coroner&rsquo;s
    jury will think of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll see it in its true light,&rdquo; declared Rhoda Schuyler. &ldquo;Of
    course, she was angry when he came to her house after being forbidden, unless
    the sly thing wrote the note just to lure him on, but in any case, she was
    alone with him, she used the knife on him and she ran away. What more evidence
    do you need? Now, to find her. That&rsquo;s a task I shall never give up
    or neglect until I&rsquo;ve accomplished it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you are right, Rhoda,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;if the girl is
    guilty. I hope she will be found, for I&rsquo;m sure the truth could then
    be learned, whether she is guilty or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you come, now, Mrs. Schuyler,&rdquo; said Tibbetts, from the
    doorway. &ldquo;The flowers have arrived.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ruth, beckoning to Winnie, rose, and the two left the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly idiotic,&rdquo; said Sarah, &ldquo;the way she orders flowers!
    Fresh ones every day!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But hasn&rsquo;t she a right to spend her own money as she likes?&rdquo; I
    defended.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A legal right, perhaps,&rdquo; was the retort, &ldquo;but not a moral
    right to disregard her husband&rsquo;s wishes so utterly.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter12MoreNotes"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  More Notes</strong></h2>
  <p>Next morning at breakfast, there was but one topic of conversation. Indeed,
    little else had been talked of for days but the Schuyler case and all its
    side issues.</p>
  <p>Winnie held forth at length on the martyrdom Ruth Schuyler had suffered
    because of the cruelty of her late husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t really ugly, you know,&rdquo; explained Win, &ldquo;and
    I don&rsquo;t say she&rsquo;s glad he&rsquo;s dead. But he thwarted her in
    every little way that she wanted to enjoy herself. They had a box at the
    opera, and a big country house and all that, but he wouldn&rsquo;t let her
    go to matinees or have a motor of her own or buy anything until he had passed
    judgment on it. She even had to submit her costume designs to him, and if
    he approved the dressmaker made them up. And he wouldn&rsquo;t let her have
    fashionable clothes. They had to be plain and of rich heavy materials, such
    as the sisters wear. Mr. Schuyler was under the thumb of those two old maids,
    and Rhoda, especially, put him up to all sorts of schemes to bother Ruth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you call her Ruth?&rdquo; I asked, in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, she told me I might. She&rsquo;s lovely to me, and I&rsquo;m
    so glad to do all I can for her. Honest, Chet, she lived an awful life with
    that man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see her,&rdquo; said Aunt Lucy. &ldquo;All you&rsquo;ve
    said about her, Winnie, makes me a bit curious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you shall, Auntie, some time. She&rsquo;s a real friend of mine
    now, and even after Edith Crowell goes there as secretary, she says I must
    often go to see her as her friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s charming,&rdquo; I declared. &ldquo;Every time I see
    her I&rsquo;m more impressed with her gentle dignity. And I don&rsquo;t know
    how she can be so decent to those two old women.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; agreed Win, as Aunt Lucy asked, &ldquo;Is she pretty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is she, Winnie?&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, she is and she isn&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s so colorless, you know.
    Her hair is that flat ashy blonde, and she&rsquo;s so pale always. Then her
    eyes and lashes are so light, and&mdash;well, ineffective. But her expression
    is so sweet, and when once in a while she laughs outright, she&rsquo;s very
    attractive. And she&rsquo;s such a thoroughbred. She never errs in taste
    or judgment. She knows just what to reply to all the queer letters of condolence
    that come to her, and just how to talk to the people who call. And that&rsquo;s
    another thing. She hasn&rsquo;t any friends of her own age. She knows only
    the people who belong to the most exclusive set, and they&rsquo;re nearly
    all the age of the old sisters. But Mrs. Schuyler is lovely to them. And
    in her soft pretty black gowns she looks a whole lot better than she ever
    did in the ones she wore while he was alive. I&rsquo;ve seen them in her
    wardrobe, and I&rsquo;ve seen her try on some that she was going to give
    away, and they&rsquo;re sights! Elegant, you know, but not the thing for
    her. Now, that she can select her own, she has beauties.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She certainly must be glad, then, to be freed from such a tyrant,&rdquo; said
    Aunt Lucy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you think that!&rdquo; insisted Winnie, earnestly. &ldquo;She
    may feel, so, &lsquo;way down in her deepest heart, but she won&rsquo;t admit
    it, even to herself. And, of course, no matter how much she didn&rsquo;t
    love him, she wouldn&rsquo;t want him taken off&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;way!
    No, she&rsquo;s perfectly all right, and she mourns that man just as sincerely
    as any woman could mourn a man who didn&rsquo;t understand her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked at Win in amazement. Little sister was growing up, it seemed. Well,
    the experience would do her no harm. Ruth Schuyler&rsquo;s influence could
    work only for good, and a taste of real life would give a wider outlook than
    Win could get at home.</p>
  <p>I went down to the coroner&rsquo;s courtroom. The inquest was proceeding
    in its usual discursive way, and I sat down to listen for a while. The coroner
    was hearing reports from detectives who had interviewed the market men and
    shopkeepers where Vicky Van had bought wares.</p>
  <p>It was just what might be expected from any householder&rsquo;s record.
    Vicky had always paid her bills promptly, usually by check on a well-known
    bank. Sometimes, if the bills were small they were paid in cash. In such
    case Miss Van Allen herself or the maid brought the money; if checks, they
    were sent by mail. The garage man reported a similar state of affairs. His
    monthly bills were promptly paid, and Miss Van Allen had found no fault with
    his service. She was away from home frequently, but when at home, she used
    her motor car often and was kind to the chauffeur who drove her. This chauffeur
    told of taking her to the shops, to the theatre, to friends&rsquo; houses
    and to picture galleries&mdash;but had never been directed to any place where
    a lady might not go.</p>
  <p>The bank people said that Miss Van Allen had had an account with them for
    years, but as their depositors were entitled to confidential dealings they
    would say little more. They stated, however, that Miss Van Allen was a most
    desirable patron and never overdrew her account or made trouble of any sort.</p>
  <p>There was nothing to be gleaned from this kind of testimony. We all knew
    that Vicky was a good citizen and all this was merely corroboration. What
    was wanted was some hint of her present whereabouts.</p>
  <p>Lowney had tried to get at this by the use of an address book he had found
    in Vicky Van&rsquo;s desk. He had telephoned or called on many of the people
    whose addresses were in the book, but all said over and over what we already
    knew.</p>
  <p>Personally, I felt sure that Vicky was staying with some friend not far
    from her own house. It could well be, that somebody cared enough for the
    girl to hide her from the authorities. This, however, argued her guilty,
    for otherwise, a true friend would persuade her that the wiser course would
    be to disclose herself to the public.</p>
  <p>However, nothing transpired to bear out my opinion, and as the list of witnesses
    dwindled, no progress was made toward a solution of the mystery. And so,
    when at last, an open verdict was returned, with no mention of Vicky&rsquo;s
    name, I was decidedly relieved, but I didn&rsquo;t see how it could have
    been otherwise.</p>
  <p>I dropped in at the Schuyler house on my way home. I was beginning to feel
    on a very friendly footing there, and, partly owing to Winnie&rsquo;s graphic
    powers of narration, I took an increasing interest in Ruth Schuyler.</p>
  <p>As Win had said, she looked charming, although pathetic in her black robes.
    She permitted herself a touch of white at the turned-in throat, and a white
    flower was tucked in her bodice. A contrast, indeed, to the severe garb of
    the spinster sisters, who looked like allegorical figures of hopeless gloom.</p>
  <p>But their manner was more of militant revenge, and, having heard the verdict
    of the coroner&rsquo;s jury, they were ready to take up the case themselves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; they called out, as I entered the library, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
    just the man we want to see. Now, that the coroner has finished his task,
    we will take the matter up. Mr. Lowney, I suppose, will continue the search
    for Miss Van Allen, but we fear he will not be successful. So, we have determined
    to send for the great detective, Fleming Stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stone!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;why, he won&rsquo;t work with the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he can work without them,&rdquo; declared Rhoda, with asperity. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    heard wonderful stories of that man&rsquo;s success, and we&rsquo;re going
    to engage him at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very expensive,&rdquo; I began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No matter. We&rsquo;re going to find our brother&rsquo;s murderer
    if it takes every penny of our fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you think of this plan, Mrs. Schuyler?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not been consulted,&rdquo; she said, with a slight smile. &ldquo;Since
    Mr. Randolph&rsquo;s sisters choose to adopt it, I have no reason to object.
    I know nothing of Mr. Stone, but if he is really a great detective, he will
    not condemn that girl unheard. And if she is proved guilty, of course the
    claims of justice must be met. Do you know him, Mr. Calhoun?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not personally. I&rsquo;ve often heard of him, and he&rsquo;s a wonder.
    If you want to find Miss Van Allen, you can&rsquo;t do better than to get
    him on the trail. If he can&rsquo;t find her, nobody can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say,&rdquo; put in Sarah. &ldquo;And if he doesn&rsquo;t
    find her, at least we&rsquo;ve the satisfaction of knowing we&rsquo;ve done
    all we could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We thought of offering a reward for information of Miss Van Allen,&rdquo; added
    Rhoda, &ldquo;but if we&rsquo;re going to get Mr. Stone, wouldn&rsquo;t it
    be better to consult him about that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think it would,&rdquo; I judged.</p>
  <p>Just then Winnie came into the room. She had been writing notes, and she
    held a lot of unopened letters in her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Ruth,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what do you think! Here&rsquo;s
    the mail, Jepson just gave it to me, and there&rsquo;s a letter for you from
    Miss Van Allen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried everybody at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; declared Winnie, &ldquo;I know the hand, it&rsquo;s the
    same as was on that letter to Mr. Schuyler. It&rsquo;s such a queer hand,
    you can&rsquo;t forget it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She handed all the letters to Ruth, the one she referred to on top.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Schuyler turned pale as she looked at the envelope. I glanced at it,
    too, and without doubt, it was Vicky Van&rsquo;s writing.</p>
  <p>It had been mailed in New York that same morning, and delivered just now,
    about five o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You open it, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; said Ruth, as if she shrank from
    the task.</p>
  <p>I took it gravely, for it seemed to me to portend trouble for little Vicky.
    Was she giving herself up, or what?</p>
  <p>Win handed me a letter-opener, and I slit the envelope.</p>
  <p>As they breathlessly awaited my words, I read:</p>
  <p>To Mrs. Randolph Schuyler: Dear Madam: It is useless to look for me. To-day
    I am leaving New York forever. The mystery of Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s death
    will never be solved, the truth never learned. I alone know the secret and
    it will die with me. You may employ detectives from now till doomsday but
    you will discover nothing. So give up the search, for you will never find
    Victoria Van Allen.</p>
  <p>There was a pause as I finished reading. Myself, I was thrilled by a certain
    phrase in the letter. Vicky said, &ldquo;the secret will die with me.&rdquo; Again,
    I felt that she was intending to bring about her own death, and that speedily.
    Would we know it if she did? I was thinking deeply, when Miss Rhoda, spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe that girl means to kill herself, and I should think she
    would!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you think that?&rdquo; and Ruth looked up with a startled
    face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It sounds so, and it would be the natural outcome of her remorse
    at her dreadful deed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think she must be guilty,&rdquo; said Winnie, her dear little countenance
    drawn with grief, as she studied the letter for herself.</p>
  <p>None of us said much more. We all were stunned in a way, by this unexpected
    development, and had to readjust our theories.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Miss Rhoda said, decidedly, &ldquo;I shall consult Mr.
    Stone, anyway. I&rsquo;ve written him, and though I&rsquo;ve not mailed the
    letter yet, I shall send it off to-night. Then when he comes to talk it over
    we can see what he says and abide by his judgment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea, Rhoda,&rdquo; and Ruth Schuyler nodded
    assentingly; &ldquo;I, too, want justice, and if Fleming Stone thinks he
    can find Miss Van Allen, let him do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was six o&rsquo;clock then, and Win and I went home, leaving the Schuyler
    ladies to their own discussions.</p>
  <p>Ruth Schuyler&rsquo;s hand lingered a moment in mine, as I bade her adieu,
    and she said, wistfully, &ldquo;I wish you would tell me just what you think
    we had better do. I am so unaccustomed to judging for myself in any important
    matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think it is wise to get Mr. Stone,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;In
    any case it can do no harm, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not,&rdquo; and she gave me one of her rare smiles
    of appreciation. &ldquo;I am glad you are looking after us, instead of Mr.
    Bradbury,&rdquo; she said further, and I sincerely responded that I was glad,
    too.</p>
  <p>Another surprise awaited me at home. On the hall table lay my own mail,
    and as I picked it up, and ran the letters over, there was one from Vicky
    Van.</p>
  <p>I hastily concealed it from Winnie&rsquo;s sharp eyes, for I had no notion
    what it might divulge, and hurried with it up to my own room.</p>
  <p>Impatiently I tore it open and raced through its contents.</p>
  <p>Dear Mr. Calhoun:</p>
  <p>Thank you deeply for attending to my errand. Owing to your kindness I received
    the letters I wanted. Now, will you do me one last favor? Come again to the
    house tonight, and take a small parcel which you will find in the Chinese
    jar in the music room. Keep this for me and if I do not ask you for it within
    a year, destroy it unopened. I wish I could be more frank with you, you have
    proved yourself such a staunch friend, but I cannot control circumstances
    and so I must bear my fate. I do not know what Mrs. Schuyler will think of
    it, but I have written her a letter. When you see her, try to make her realize
    it is useless to hunt for me. Since I can keep hidden for this length of
    time, my retreat is not likely to be discovered. And now, my kindest of friends,
    good-bye.</p>
  <p>Vicky Van.</p>
  <p>I stood, staring at the letter. I read it through a dozen times. Of course,
    I would do her bidding, but my heart rebelled at the finality of the lines.
    I knew I would never hear from Vicky Van again. As she said, since we hadn&rsquo;t
    traced her yet, we never could.</p>
  <p>I wondered where she could possibly be. And Julie, too. Somebody was shielding
    them both. They couldn&rsquo;t be disguised or anything of that sort, for
    they had left the house at dead of night, without luggage or&mdash;and I
    hadn&rsquo;t thought of this before&mdash;without money! How could they have
    found shelter, save in some friend&rsquo;s house?</p>
  <p>Of course, Vicky could have snatched up a purse as she ran. Perhaps that
    was what she flew upstairs for. And then, maybe, she went down the back stairs&mdash;but
    no, the waiters must have seen her that way. And Luigi was in the front hall
    a moment after Vicky disappeared.</p>
  <p>Aside from my personal interest, I hated to think I should never know just
    how she did get away. For now, I had no hope that Fleming Stone or anyone
    else could ever find the girl. She was too canny to be taken, after her successful
    concealment so far.</p>
  <p>I went downstairs after a time, but I said nothing of my letter to Aunt
    Lucy or Win.</p>
  <p>They were eagerly discussing the latest news, and Aunt Lucy was saying, &ldquo;Yes,
    I&rsquo;ve heard of Mr. Stone, and they do say he&rsquo;s a marvel. I hope
    he&rsquo;ll find the girl, if only to learn the mystery of her disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll find her,&rdquo; assured Winnie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    heard a lot about him over there and he&rsquo;s a wizard! But I think he&rsquo;ll
    have a long chase.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meantime, what becomes of the house?&rdquo; queried Aunt Lucy. &ldquo;What
    does, Chet? Can anyone go in it who likes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I returned, a little shortly, for I foresaw Aunt Lucy
    had that absurd feminine desire to pry into another person&rsquo;s home. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    in charge of the police, and they won&rsquo;t let anyone in, without some
    very good reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you get in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I might,&rdquo; I admitted unwillingly, &ldquo;if I had
    any business there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, do get up some business, Chet,&rdquo; begged Winnie, &ldquo;and
    get the keys and let Auntie and me go with you! Oh, do! I&rsquo;d love to
    see that girl&rsquo;s things!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Winnie, you&rsquo;re positively lowbred to show such curiosity!&rdquo; I
    exclaimed, angrily&mdash;the more so, that I had the house key in my pocket
    at that moment. But I was glad I had not told them of Vicky Van&rsquo;s letter
    to me!</p>
  <p>I waited until well past midnight, and then, after seeing the post patrol
    pass Vicky&rsquo;s door, I softly went out of my own house, and across the
    street.</p>
  <p>I walked calmly up the steps of Vicky&rsquo;s home, and sadly put the latchkey
    in the door&mdash;for the last time. I felt as if I were performing funeral
    rites, and I entered and closed the door behind me, softly, as one does in
    the house of death.</p>
  <p>I went up the stairs, in the gloom. It was not black darkness, for a partly
    raised blind gave me a glimmer of light from the street. Into the music room
    I went, and by my pocket flashlight, I took the lid from the Chinese jar.
    But there was no parcel inside!</p>
  <p>Amazed, I threw the light down into the big vase, but it was utterly empty.</p>
  <p>There was no use looking elsewhere for the parcel&mdash;I knew Vicky well
    enough to know that she would do exactly as she had said. Or, since she hadn&rsquo;t,
    I was sure that she would not have left that parcel in any other hiding-place.</p>
  <p>I put the flashlight back in my pocket, and started downstairs.</p>
  <p>Slowly I descended, for I still felt a little uncertain what to do. Should
    I wait for a short time, or go back home and return again later?</p>
  <p>I reached the foot of the stairs, and concluded to go home, and then think
    out my next step.</p>
  <p>As I passed the living-room door, I heard a low voice whisper my name.</p>
  <p>I turned sharply. In the doorway, I could dimly discern a cloaked figure. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she
    said, softly, and beckoned to me.</p>
  <p>It was Vicky Van!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter13FlemingStone"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  Fleming
    Stone</strong></h2>
  <p>Vicky had said &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; but it was an unnecessary precaution,
    for I was too stunned to articulate. I peered at her in the darkness and
    then, unable to control my desire for certainty I flashed my little pocket
    light on her for an instant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she whispered, putting her hands up before her
    face.</p>
  <p>But I had seen. It was really Vicky Van, her smooth black hair looped over
    her ears, her scarlet mouth, and soft pink cheeks, flushed with excitement
    of the moment, and her long dark lashes, which suddenly fell beneath the
    blinding flare of the light, all were those of the runaway girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; she said, hastily, &ldquo;let me do the
    talking. I want you to help me, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, I will,&rdquo; and all sense of law and justice fled before
    the wave of pity and solicitude for the trembling suppliant who thus appealed
    to me.</p>
  <p>Her voice was indistinct and a little hoarse, as if she was laboring under
    great mental and nerve strain, and she was so alone, so unprotected, that
    I couldn&rsquo;t help promising any assistance in my power.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any parcel in the big vase,&rdquo; I said, in
    a low voice, as she seemed to hesitate about going on with her explanation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, here it is,&rdquo; and she handed me a little box, &ldquo;Just
    put it away safely for the present. And now, this is what I want to ask of
    you. Don&rsquo;t let them engage that Mr. Stone, to hunt me down, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, how can I help it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; and she sounded so disappointed; &ldquo;I
    hoped you could persuade Mrs. Schuyler not to have him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Mrs. Schuyler doesn&rsquo;t want him, either!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    those two sisters who insist on getting him. And I never could turn their
    wills, try as I might.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t Mrs. Schuyler want him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not sure that she really objects to the plan, but,
    I mean she didn&rsquo;t seem as anxious as the other two. You see, little
    girl, the widow of Randolph Schuyler isn&rsquo;t so bitter against you as
    the two sisters are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good of her,&rdquo; and Vicky&rsquo;s voice was wistful. &ldquo;But,
    you know I must remain in hiding&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to leave New York?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am. And at once. But if that Mr. Stone gets on my trail, he&rsquo;ll
    find me, as sure as fate. And so I risked this interview to try to persuade
    you to use your influence against his coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; I returned, heartily. &ldquo;But I
    feel that I ought to tell you that I doubt my power to dissuade the Schuyler
    sisters from their determination. And, too, how did you know they thought
    of getting him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I see all the papers, you know, and in one of them a reporter
    gave a personal interview with the Schuyler people, and they hinted at getting
    that man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Vicky sighed wearily, as if her last hope was gone. I was full of questions
    I wanted to ask her, but it seemed intrusive and unkind to quiz her. And
    yet, one thing I felt I must say. I must ask her what she knew of the actual
    crime.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I blurted out, &ldquo;who did kill Randolph Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again I felt her tremble, and her voice quivered as she whispered back, &ldquo;It
    must have been some enemy of his, who got in at the window, or something
    like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My heart fell. This was the sort of thing she would say if she were herself
    the guilty one. I had hoped for a more sincere, even if despairing, answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I must send you away,&rdquo; she breathed in my ear. We were
    standing just inside the room, and Vicky held her hand on a chair-back for
    support. There was the faintest light from the street, enough for us to distinguish
    one another&rsquo;s forms, but no more. Vicky wore a street gown of some
    sort, and a long cloak. On her head was a small hat, and a black net veil.
    This was tied so tightly that it interfered a little with her speech, I thought,
    though when I had looked at her face by my flashlight, the veil had not been
    of sufficient thickness to conceal her features at all. I&rsquo;ve often
    wondered why women wear those uncomfortable things. She kept pulling it away
    from her lips as she talked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want my address book,&rdquo; she went on, hurriedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    looked all over for it, and it&rsquo;s gone. Did the detective take it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think he did,&rdquo; I replied, remembering Lowney&rsquo;s search.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get it back for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, child, what do you think I am? A magician?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, but I thought you could manage somehow to get it,&rdquo; her
    voice showed the adorable petulance that distinguished Vicky Van; &ldquo;and
    then, you could send it to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; I cried, eagerly. &ldquo;Where shall I address you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that. But you can bring it here and leave
    it in the Chinese jar, and I will get it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you come in and go out of this house without being seen?&rdquo; I
    demanded. &ldquo;By the area door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; and she spoke lightly. &ldquo;And perhaps by a
    window, and maybe by means of an aeroplane and down through the skylight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the skylight is fastened on the inside,
    and has been ever since&mdash;ever since that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then I don&rsquo;t come that way. But if you&rsquo;ll get that
    book and put it in the big vase, I&rsquo;ll come and get it. When will it
    be there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy to think I can get it,&rdquo; I returned, slowly, &ldquo;but
    if I can I will. Give me a few days&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A week, if you like. Shall we say a week from to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next Monday? Yes. If I can get it at all, I can have it by then.
    How shall I let you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t let me know, for I know now you will get it. Steal
    it from Mr. Lowney, if you can&rsquo;t get it otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But if Fleming Stone is on your trail, will you come for the book?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; she spoke gravely. &ldquo;I must have the book. It
    means everything to me. I&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;have it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you shall, if I can manage it. It is your book, it has proved
    of no value as evidence, you may as well have it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I may as well have it. And now, Mr. Calhoun, will you go, please,
    or do you intend to turn me over to the police?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vicky!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;how can you say such a thing? Of course
    I&rsquo;ll go, if you bid me. But let me wait a minute. You know you wrote
    to Ruth Schuyler&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ruth? Is that one of the old sisters?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Ruth is the widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I wrote to her. I didn&rsquo;t know her first name. I wrote
    because I thought it was she who is making the desperate search for me, and
    I hoped I could influence her to stop it. That&rsquo;s all. I have no interest
    in Randolph Schuyler&rsquo;s widow, except as she affects my future, but
    can you do anything by working in the other direction? I mean can you dissuade
    Fleming Stone from coming, by asking him not to? You can bribe him perhaps&mdash;I
    have money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I doubt if I could do anything like that. But I&rsquo;ll try,
    I&rsquo;ll try every way I can, and, if I succeed&mdash;how shall I let you
    know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll know. If he takes up the matter, it will probably
    get into the papers, and if I see nothing of it, I&rsquo;ll conclude you
    succeeded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I&mdash;I want to see you again, Vicky&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t. Why, you don&rsquo;t know this minute but
    what I stabbed that man, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t, Vicky&mdash;tell me you didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that. I can&rsquo;t tell you anything. I am
    the most miserable girl on God&rsquo;s earth!&rdquo; and I heard tears in
    Vicky&rsquo;s voice, and a sob choked her utterance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now go,&rdquo; she said, after a moment, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand
    any more. Please go, and do what you can for me, without getting yourself
    into trouble. Go, and don&rsquo;t look back to see how I make my exit, will
    you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, I won&rsquo;t do that. Your confidences are safe with me,
    Vicky, and I will do all in my power to help you, in any way I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then go now,&rdquo; she said, and a gentle pressure of her hand on
    my arm urged me toward the door.</p>
  <p>I went without another word, and neither while in the street, nor after
    gaining my own house, did I look back for another glimpse of Vicky Van.</p>
  <p>And yet, try as I would, maneuver as I might, I couldn&rsquo;t prevent the
    arrival of Fleming Stone.</p>
  <p>The Schuyler sisters were determined to have the great detective, and though
    Mrs. Schuyler wasn&rsquo;t so anxious, yet she raised not the slightest objection,
    and after some persuasion, Stone agreed to take the case.</p>
  <p>I was present at his first call to discuss details and was immensely interested
    in my first sight of the man.</p>
  <p>Tall, well-formed, and of a gravely courteous manner, he impressed me as
    the most magnetically attractive man I had ever seen. His iron-gray hair
    and deep-set, dark eyes gave him a dignity that I had never before associated
    with my notions of a detective.</p>
  <p>The Schuyler sisters were frankly delighted with him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ll run down the murderer of my brother,&rdquo; Miss
    Rhoda exulted, while Miss Sarah began to babble volubly of what she called
    clues and evidence.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone listened politely, now and then asking a direct question and
    sometimes turning to Ruth Schuyler for further information.</p>
  <p>As I watched him closely, it occurred to me that he really paid little attention
    to what the women said, he was more engaged in scanning their faces and noting
    their attitudes. Perhaps I imagined it, but I thought he was sizing up their
    characters and their sympathies, and intended looking up his clues and evidence
    by himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The first thing to do,&rdquo; he declared, at last, &ldquo;is to
    find Miss Van Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was what I had feared, and remembering my promise to Vicky I said, &ldquo;I
    think that will be impossible, Mr. Stone. She wrote she was leaving New York
    forever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But a householder like that can&rsquo;t go away forever,&rdquo; Stone
    said, &ldquo;she must look after her goods and chattels, and she must pay
    her rent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, she owns the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must pay the taxes, then. Must sell it, or rent it or do something
    with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would seem so,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;And yet, if one is wanted
    for murder one would sacrifice household goods and the house itself in order
    to escape being caught.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; and Stone nodded his head. &ldquo;But, still, I fancy
    she would return for something. Few women could leave their home like that,
    and not have some valuables or some secret papers or something for which
    they must return. I venture to say Miss Van Allen has already been back to
    her house, more than once, on secret errands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was the man a clairvoyant? How could he know that Vicky had done this very
    thing? But I realized at once, that he knew it, not from cognizance of facts,
    but from his prescience of what would necessarily follow in such a case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She has her keys, of course?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police have charge of the keys,&rdquo; I said, a little lamely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Stone said, impatiently, &ldquo;but there are doubtless
    more keys than the ones they have. I should say, that Miss Van Allen took
    at least the key of one door with her, however hurried her flight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; I conceded. &ldquo;But, granting she has been
    back and forth on the errands you suggest, it is not likely she will keep
    it up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, it is not. And especially if she learns I am on the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How could she know that?&rdquo; Ruth Schuyler asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Miss Van Allen is a most clever and ingenious young
    woman,&rdquo; Stone replied, &ldquo;and I feel sure she knows all that is
    going on. She gets information from the papers, and, too, she has that dependable
    maid, Julie. That woman, probably disguised, can do much in the way of getting
    information as to how matters are progressing. You see, I&rsquo;ve followed
    the case all the way along, and the peculiarities and unique conditions of
    it are what induced me to take it up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall we offer a reward, Mr. Stone, for the discovery of the hiding
    place of Miss Van Allen?&rdquo; asked Rhoda, eagerly. &ldquo;I want to use
    every possible means of finding her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not yet, Miss Schuyler. Let us try other plans first. But I must
    enjoin utter secrecy about my connection with the matter. Not the fact that
    I am at work on it, but the developments or details of my work. It is a most
    unusual, a most peculiar case, and I must work unimpeded by outside advice
    or interference. I may say, I&rsquo;ve never known of a case which presented
    such extraordinary features, and features which will either greatly simplify
    or greatly impede my progress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just what do you mean by that last remark, Mr. Stone?&rdquo; asked
    Ruth Schuyler, who had been listening intently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean that the absolutely mysterious disappearance of the young
    woman will either be of easy and simple solution, or else it will prove an
    insoluble mystery. There will be no half-way work about it. If I can&rsquo;t
    learn the truth in a short time, I fear I never can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How strange,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Do you often feel thus about the
    beginning of a case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very rarely, almost never. And never have I felt it so strongly as
    in this instance. To trace that girl is not a matter of long and patient
    search, it&rsquo;s rather a question of a bit of luck or a slight slip on
    her part, or&mdash;well&mdash;of some coincidence or chance discovery that
    will clear things at one flash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re depending on luck?&rdquo; exclaimed Rhoda, in a
    disappointed tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, not that,&rdquo; and Stone smiled. &ldquo;At least, I&rsquo;m
    not depending entirely on that. If luck comes my way, so much the better.
    And now, please let me see the notes Miss Van Allen has written.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>None was available, however, except the one to Ruth Schuyler. For the one
    to Randolph Schuyler was in Lowney&rsquo;s possession, and the one I had
    had from Vicky, and which was even then in my pocket, I had no intention
    of showing.</p>
  <p>It was not necessary, however, for Fleming Stone said one was enough to
    gather all that he could learn from her chirography.</p>
  <p>He studied it attentively, but only for a moment. Then he said, &ldquo;A
    characteristic penmanship, but to me it only shows forcefulness, ingenuity
    and good nature. However, I&rsquo;m not an expert, I only get a general impression,
    and the traits I&rsquo;ve mentioned are undoubtedly to be found in the lady&rsquo;s
    nature. Are they not?&rdquo; and he turned to me, as to one who knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;so far as I know Miss Van Allen.
    But my acquaintance with her is limited, and I can only agree superficially.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone eyed me closely, and I began to feel a little uncomfortable under
    his gaze. Clearly, I&rsquo;d have to tell the truth, or incur his suspicion.
    Nor did I wish to prevaricate. I felt friendly toward poor little Vicky,
    and yet, I had no mind to run counter to the interest of Ruth Schuyler. The
    two sisters I didn&rsquo;t worry about, and indeed, they could look out for
    themselves. But Ruth Schuyler was in a position to demand justice, and if
    that justice accused Vicky Van, I must be honest and fair to both in my testimony.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone proceeded to question the women, more definitely and concisely
    now, and by virtue of his marvellous efficiency, he so shaped his inquiries,
    that he learned details with accuracy and rapidity.</p>
  <p>It would never have occurred to me to ask the questions that he put, but
    as he went on, I saw their pertinence and value.</p>
  <p>With Ruth&rsquo;s permission he called several of the servants and asked
    them a few things. Nothing of moment transpired, to my mind, but Stone was
    interested in a full account of where each servant was and what he was doing
    on the night of the murder. Each gave a straightforward and satisfactory
    account, and I realized that Stone was only getting a sense of the household
    atmosphere, and its relations to Mr. Schuyler himself.</p>
  <p>Tibbetts, the middle-aged maid of Ruth Schuyler, told of the shock to her
    mistress when the news was brought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Schuyler had retired,&rdquo; said Tibbetts, &ldquo;at about
    ten o&rsquo;clock, Mr. Schuyler was out, and was not expected home until
    late. I attended her, and after she was in bed, I went to bed myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m told you do not live here,&rdquo; commented Stone, though
    in a disinterested way, and at the same time making notes of some other matters
    in his notebook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have a room around on Third Avenue,&rdquo; replied Tibbetts. &ldquo;I
    like a little home of my own, and when Mrs. Schuyler permits me, I go &lsquo;round
    there to sleep, and sometimes I go in the daylight hours. But on that night
    I happened to be staying here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tibbetts is rather a privileged character,&rdquo; interposed Ruth. &ldquo;She
    has been with me for many years, and as she likes a little place of her own,
    I adopted the plan of which she has told you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that night you were here?&rdquo; said Stone, to the maid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I slept in Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s dressing room, as I always
    do when I&rsquo;m here. Then when Jepson told me the&mdash;the awful news,
    I awoke Mrs. Schuyler and told her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;I read all about that in the inquest
    report.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter14WallsHaveTongues"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  Walls Have
    Tongues</strong></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone, after he had learned all he desired
    from the Schuyler household, &ldquo;now, if you please, I would like to go
    over the Van Allen house. You have the keys, Mr. Calhoun?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have a latchkey to the street door.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;the
    rooms are not locked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know why exactly, but I hated to have him go through Vicky
    Van&rsquo;s house. Of course, it must have been because she had begged me
    not to let Stone get into the case at all. But I hadn&rsquo;t been able to
    prevent that, the two Schuyler sisters being determined to have him. And
    I had no desire to impede justice or stand in the way of law and order, but,
    somehow or other, I felt the invasion of Vicky&rsquo;s home would bring about
    trouble for the girl, and my mind was filled with vague foreboding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We will go with you,&rdquo; announced Miss Rhoda. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    wanted to see that house from the first. You&rsquo;ll go, Ruth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; and Ruth Schuyler shrank at the idea. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    no wish to see the place where my husband was killed! How could you think
    of it? If I could do any good by going&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Mrs. Schuyler,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone, &ldquo;you could do
    no good, and I quite understand why you would rather not go. The Misses Schuyler
    and Mr. Calhoun will accompany me, and we will start at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go?&rdquo; asked Winnie, who had come in recently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    just crazy to see that house. You don&rsquo;t mind my going, do you, Ruth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, indeed, child. I&rsquo;m perfectly willing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Stone raised no objection, so Winnie went with us.</p>
  <p>It was nearly five o&rsquo;clock, full daylight, though the dusk was just
    beginning to fall. We went round to Vicky Van&rsquo;s and I opened the door
    for the party to enter.</p>
  <p>The house had begun to show disuse. There was dust on the shining surfaces
    of the furniture and on the polished floors. The clocks had all stopped and
    the musty chill of a closed house was in the atmosphere.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; cried Winnie, &ldquo;what a creepy feeling! And this
    house is too pretty to be so neglected! Why, it&rsquo;s a darling house.
    Look at that heavenly color scheme!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Winnie had darted into the living-room, with its rose and gray appointments,
    and we all followed her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch anything, Miss Calhoun,&rdquo; cautioned Stone,
    and Win contented herself with gazing about, her hands clasped behind her.</p>
  <p>The Schuyler sisters sniffed, and though they said little, they conveyed
    the idea that to their minds the bijou residence savored of reprehensible
    frivolity.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone lived up to his reputation as a detective, and scrutinized
    everything with quick, comprehensive glances. We went through the long living-room,
    and into the dining-room, whose pale green and silver again enchanted Winnie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The walls are exquisite,&rdquo; Stone agreed, looking closely at
    the panels of silk brocade, framed with a silver tracery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If walls have ears, they must burn at your praise,&rdquo; I said,
    in an effort to speak lightly, for Stone&rsquo;s face had an ominous look,
    as if he were learning grave truths.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walls not only have ears, they have tongues,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;These
    walls have already told me much of Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, how?&rdquo; cried Winnie, &ldquo;do tell us how you deduce and
    all that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked hastily at Stone, thinking he might be annoyed by Winnie&rsquo;s
    volatile speech.</p>
  <p>But he said kindly, &ldquo;To the trained eye, Miss Calhoun, much is apparent
    that escapes the casual observer. But you can understand that the taste displayed
    in the wall decoration, shows a refined and cultured nature. A woman of the
    adventuress type would prefer more garish display. Of course, I am generalizing,
    but there is much to bear me out. Then, I see, by certain tiny marks and
    cracks, that these walls have lately been done over, and that they were also
    redecorated another time not long before. This proves that Miss Van Allen
    has money enough to gratify her whims and she chooses to spend it in satisfying
    her aesthetic preferences. Further, the walls have been carefully cared for,
    showing an interested and capable housekeeperly instinct and traits of extreme
    orderliness and tidiness. Cleverness, even, for here, you see, is a place,
    where a bit of the plaster has been defaced by a knock or scratch, and it
    has been delicately painted over with a little pale green paint which matches
    exactly. It is not the work of a professional decorator, so reason tells
    me that probably Miss Van Allen herself remedied the defect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed Winnie, &ldquo;I can see all that
    myself, now you tell me, but I never should have thought of it! Tell me more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then the pictures, which are so well chosen and placed, that they
    seem part of the walls, are, as you notice, all figure pieces. There are
    no landscapes. This, of course, means that Miss Van Allen is not distinctly
    a nature lover, but prefers humanity and society. This argues for the joy
    of living and the appreciation of mental pleasures and occupations. No devotee
    of nature would have failed to have pictures of flowers or harmonizing landscapes
    on these walls. So, you see, to be edified by the tongues of walls, you must
    not only listen to them but understand their language.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then Stone began taking in the rest of the dining-room&rsquo;s contents.
    The table, hastily cleared by the caterer&rsquo;s men, was empty of the china
    and glass which they had supplied, but still retained the candlesticks and
    epergnes that were Vicky Van&rsquo;s own. These were of plated silver, not
    sterling, which fact Stone noted. The lace-trimmed linen, however, was of
    the finest and most elaborate sort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An unholy waste of money!&rdquo; declared Rhoda Schuyler, looking
    at the marvellous monogram of V. V. A. embroidered on the napkins.</p>
  <p>But I gazed sadly at the table, only partially dismantled, which had been
    so gaily decked for Vicky&rsquo;s birthday supper.</p>
  <p>Scanning the sideboard, Stone remarked the absence of the small carving
    knife. I told him I, too, had observed that, and that I had made search for
    it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ask the caterer&rsquo;s people if they took it by mistake?&rdquo; said
    the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I admitted, ashamed that I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it,
    and I promised to do so.</p>
  <p>As Stone stood, silently contemplating the place where Randolph Schuyler
    had met his death, I stepped out into the hall. I had no conscious reason
    for doing so, but I did, and chancing to glance toward the stairs, I with
    difficulty repressed an exclamation.</p>
  <p>For half-way up the staircase, I saw Vicky Van!</p>
  <p>I was sure it was no hallucination, I positively saw her! She was leaning
    over the banister, listening to what Stone was saying. Suddenly, even as
    I looked, she ran upstairs and disappeared.</p>
  <p>Was she safe? Could she escape? Perhaps by a back staircase, or could she
    manage to elude us and slip away somehow?</p>
  <p>Then I was conscience-stricken. Was I conniving at the escape of a guilty
    person? Did I want to do this? I didn&rsquo;t know. Something told me I must
    tell Stone of her presence, and yet something else made it impossible for
    me to do so.</p>
  <p>I turned back to the dining-room, and Miss Sarah was saying, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    the spot, then, that&rsquo;s where Randolph was killed by that awful woman!
    Mr. Stone you&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;get her! An eye for an eye&mdash;a
    life for a life! She must pay the penalty of her guilt!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Winnie was listening, and tears stood in her eyes. Like Ruth Schuyler, from
    whom she doubtless took a cue, Win wasn&rsquo;t so ready to condemn Vicky
    Van unheard, as the two sisters were. She looked steadily at Fleming Stone,
    as if expecting him to produce Vicky then and there, and I quivered with
    the thought of what would happen if he knew that even at that moment Vicky
    was under the same roof with ourselves!</p>
  <p>But Stone completed his survey of the dining-room, and as a matter of course,
    started next up the stairs. I pushed ahead a little, in my eagerness to precede
    him, but a vague desire to protect Vicky urged me on. I stood in the upper
    hall as the rest came up, and I imagined that Stone gave me a curious glance
    as he noted my evident embarrassment.</p>
  <p>But Winnie dashed into the music room, and the Schuyler sisters quickly
    followed. Trust a woman to feel and show curiosity about her neighbor&rsquo;s
    home!</p>
  <p>Again Stone examined the walls, but the immaculate white and gold sides
    of the music room said nothing intelligible to me, and if they spoke to him
    he did not divulge the message. The women exclaimed at the beautiful room,
    and, as Stone&rsquo;s examination here was short, we all filed back to Vicky&rsquo;s
    bedroom.</p>
  <p>I heard no sound of her, and I breathed more freely, as we did not find
    her in bedroom or in the boudoir beyond. She had, then, succeeded in getting
    away, and trusted to me not to betray her presence there.</p>
  <p>The boudoir or dressing-room, all pink satin and white enameled wicker called
    forth new exclamations from Winnie, and even Rhoda Schuyler expressed a grudging
    admiration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;beautiful,&rdquo; she conceded. &ldquo;I
    wish Ruth had come, after all. She loves this sort of furniture. Don&rsquo;t
    you remember, Sarah, she wanted Randolph to do up her dressing-room in wicker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but he didn&rsquo;t like it, he said it was gim-crackery. And
    the Circassian walnut of Ruth&rsquo;s room is much handsomer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course it is. Ruth has a charming suite. Oh, do look at the dresses!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone had flung open a wardrobe door, and the costumes disclosed,
    though not numerous, were of beautiful coloring and design. Winnie, unable
    to resist the temptation, fingered them lovingly, and called my attention
    to certain wonderful confections.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did she wear the night of the crime?&rdquo; Stone asked, and
    I told him. Having Win for a sister, I am fairly good at describing women&rsquo;s
    clothes, and I drew a vivid word picture of Vicky&rsquo;s gold fringed gown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heavenly!&rdquo; exclaimed Winnie, although she had had me describe
    the gown to her on the average of twice a day for a week. &ldquo;I wish I
    could see it! Some day, Chet, I&rsquo;m going to have one like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fringe?&rdquo; said Stone, curiously, &ldquo;do women wear fringe
    nowadays?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I responded. &ldquo;But it was a long fringe of gilt
    beads that really formed an overdress to the tulle skirt. Stay, I&rsquo;ve
    a piece of it,&rdquo; and I took out my pocketbook. &ldquo;See, here it is.
    I found it caught in those gilded leaves at the lower corner of the mirror
    frame&mdash;that long dressing-mirror.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They all looked at the mirror, which hung flat against the wall; its foliated
    Florentine frame full of irregular protuberances.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Winnie, nodding her head, &ldquo;I know just
    how she stood in front of it, whirling around to see her gown from all sides,
    like this.&rdquo; Win whirled herself around, before the glass, and succeeded
    in catching a bit of her own full skirt on the frame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You little goose!&rdquo; I cried, as the fabric tore, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t
    need a demonstration at the expense of your frock!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone was studying the strand of gold fringe. It was composed of
    tiny beads, of varying shapes, and had already begun to ravel into shreds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep this,&rdquo; he said, and willy-nilly, I lost my
    little souvenir of Vicky Van. But, of course, if he considered it evidence,
    I had to give it up, and the fact of doing so, partly salved my conscience
    of its guilty feeling at concealing the fact of Vicky&rsquo;s presence in
    her own house just then.</p>
  <p>And, too, I said to myself, Mr. Stone is out to find her. Surely a detective
    of his calibre can accomplish that without help of an humble layman! So I
    kept my own counsel, and further search, of the next story, and later, of
    the basement rooms, gave no hint of Vicky&rsquo;s presence or departure.</p>
  <p>Indeed, I began to wonder if I had really seen her. Could she have been
    so clearly in my mind, that I visualized her in a moment of clairvoyance?
    My reason rebelled at this, for I knew I saw her, as well as I knew I was
    alive. She had on the same little hat in which I had last seen her. She had
    on no cloak, and her tailor-made street dress was of a dark cloth. I couldn&rsquo;t
    be sure how she got away, for the basement door we found bolted on the inside,
    but she must have warily evaded and eluded us and slipped here and there
    as we pursued our course through the house, and then have gone out by the
    front door when we were, say, on the upper floors.</p>
  <p>Returning to Vicky&rsquo;s boudoir, where her little writing-desk was, Fleming
    Stone began to run over the letters and papers therein.</p>
  <p>It was locked, but he picked the flimsy fastening and calmly took up the
    task with his usual quick-moving, efficient manner.</p>
  <p>I stayed with him, and the three women wandered back over the house again.
    He ran through letters with glancing quickness, flipped over sheafs of bills,
    and examined pens, ink and paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much that&rsquo;s characteristic about a desk,&rdquo; he
    said, as he observed the penwiper, stamps, pin-tray, and especially the pencils. &ldquo;Indeed,
    I feel now that I know Miss Van Allen as well, if not better than you do
    yourself, Mr. Calhoun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In that case, then, you can&rsquo;t believe her guilty,&rdquo; I
    flashed back, for the very atmosphere of the dear little room made me more
    than ever Vicky&rsquo;s friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you see,&rdquo; and he spoke a bit sadly, &ldquo;what I know
    of her is the real woman. I can&rsquo;t be deceived by her wiles and coquetries.
    I see only the actual traces of her actual self.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I knew what he meant, and there was some truth in it. For Vicky was a mystery,
    and I was not by any means sure, that she didn&rsquo;t hoodwink us when she
    chose to. Much as I liked and admired the girl, I was forced to believe she
    was not altogether disingenuous. And she was clever enough to hoodwink anybody.
    But if Stone&rsquo;s deductions were to be depended on, they were doubtless
    true evidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is she guilty?&rdquo; I sighed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that, yet, but I&rsquo;ve found nothing that absolutely
    precludes her guilt. On the contrary, I&rsquo;ve found things, which if she
    is guilty, will go far toward proving it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This sounded a bit enigmatical, but Stone was so serious, that I grasped
    his general meaning and let it go at that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; he said, divining my thoughts, &ldquo;that things
    may or may not be evidence according to the guilt or innocence of the suspect.
    If you find a little boy in the pantry beside an empty jampot, you suspect
    him of stealing jam. Now, if lots of other circumstances prove that child
    did take the jam, the empty pot is evidence. But, if circumstances develop
    that convince you the child did not have any jam whatever, that day, then
    the jampot is no evidence at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you have found empty jampots?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have. But, so far, I&rsquo;m not sure that they are condemnatory
    evidence. Though, in justice to my own work, I must add, that they have every
    appearance of being so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You already like Vicky Van, then,&rdquo; I said, quickly, moved to
    do so, by a certain note of regret in his voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No man could help liking a woman who possesses her traits. She has
    delightful taste and tastes. She is most charitable, her accounts show sums
    wisely expended on worthy charities. And letters from friends prove her a
    truly loyal and lovable character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such a girl&nbsp;<em>couldn&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;kill a man!&rdquo; I
    broke out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. There is no one incapable of crime. But such
    a nature would require very strong provocation and desperate conditions.
    These granted, it is by no means impossible. Now, I am through for to-day,
    but, if you please I will keep the key of the house. As the case is now in
    my hands, you will not object?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, a little reluctantly. For suppose Vicky should
    give me another commission or ask me to perform another errand in the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have a transparent face, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; and Fleming Stone
    smiled quizzically. &ldquo;Why do you want to keep the key?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My aunt is most desirous of seeing this house,&rdquo; I deliberately
    prevaricated, &ldquo;and I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But I didn&rsquo;t deceive the astute detective. &ldquo;No, that isn&rsquo;t
    it,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think you are
    in touch with Miss Van Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if I am?&rdquo; I flared up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;it is, as you imply, none of
    my business. But I want to know your attitude, and if it is antagonistic
    to my work, I am sorry, but I will conduct my course accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Stone,&rdquo; I confessed, &ldquo;I am not antagonistic, but
    I do know a little about Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s movements that I haven&rsquo;t
    told. I cannot see that it would assist you in any way to know it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; and Fleming Stone spoke heartily. &ldquo;Your
    assurance of that is sufficient. Now, are we working together?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I hesitated. Then I suddenly thought of Ruth Schuyler. I owed her a business
    fealty, and somehow I liked to feel that I also owed her a personal allegiance,
    and both these demanded my efforts to avenge the death of her husband, irrespective
    of where the blow might fall.</p>
  <p>So I said, honestly, &ldquo;We are, Mr. Stone. I will help you, if I can,
    and if at any time I think my withheld information will help you, I will
    make it known. Is that satisfactory?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Entirely so,&rdquo; and the handshake that Stone gave me was like
    a signed and sealed bond, to which I tacitly but none the less truthfully
    subscribed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter15Fibsy"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  Fibsy</strong></h2>
  <p>Next morning as I started for my office, I found myself combating a strong
    impulse to call in at Ruth Schuyler&rsquo;s. I had no errand there, and I
    knew that if she required my services she would summon me. It was no longer
    incumbent on me to try to unravel the murder mystery. Fleming Stone had that
    matter in charge, and his master-mind needed no assistance from me.</p>
  <p>And yet, I wanted to stop at the Fifth Avenue house, if only for a moment,
    to reassure myself of Ruth&rsquo;s well-being. Though above me in social
    rank, the little widow seemed to me a lonely and pathetic woman, and I knew
    she had begun to depend on me for advice and sympathy. Of course, she could
    turn to Fleming Stone, but, in a way, he was adviser of the Schuyler sisters,
    and I knew Ruth hesitated to intrude on his time.</p>
  <p>I was still uncertain whether to call or not, and as I walked along the
    few feet between my own house and the Avenue, I crossed the street as I reached
    Vicky Van&rsquo;s house, and naturally looked at it as I passed.</p>
  <p>And after I had passed the flight of brownstone steps, and was going along
    by the iron fence, I turned to look at the area door. This was my performance
    every morning, and always without thought of seeing anything of importance.</p>
  <p>But this time the area door stood half-way open, and looking out was a boy,
    a red-headed chap, with a freckled face and bright, wise eyes.</p>
  <p>I turned quickly and went in at the area gate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I demanded, &ldquo;and what are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Fibsy,&rdquo; he said, as if that settled it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fibsy who?&rdquo; I asked, but I dropped my indignant tone, for the
    lad seemed to be composedly sure of his rights there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, jest Fibsy. That&rsquo;s me name, because, if you want to know,
    because I&rsquo;m a natural born liar and I fib for a living.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was impudent without being offensive; his wide smile was good-natured
    and the twinkle in his eye a friendly one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got yer number,&rdquo; he said, after a comprehensive survey of
    my person, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re C. Calhoun. Ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I sure am,&rdquo; I agreed, meeting his taste for the vernacular, &ldquo;and
    now for your real name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Terence McGuire,&rdquo; he smiled, and with a quick gesture he snatched
    off his cap. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon in, if you like. I&rsquo;m F. Stone&rsquo;s
    right-hand man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; I cried, in amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yep, that&rsquo;s what. I&rsquo;m&mdash;well, I like to call myself
    his caddy. I follow him round, and hold his clues for him, till he wants
    one, then I hand it out. See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not entirely. But I gather you&rsquo;re in Mr. Stone&rsquo;s employ.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet I am! And I&rsquo;m on me job twenty-four hours a day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what is your job just now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, since eight A.M. I&rsquo;ve been holdin&rsquo; up this door,
    waitin&rsquo; for yer honor to pass by. An&rsquo; I got you, didn&rsquo;t
    I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; I stepped inside and the boy closed the
    door. We went into the front basement room, where there was a lighted gas
    stove.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I camp here, &lsquo;count o&rsquo; the heats. There&rsquo;s no use
    gettin&rsquo; up the steam fer the few casual callers that drops in at present.
    Now, Mr. Calhoun, I don&rsquo;t want to be stuffy nor nuthin&rsquo;, but
    Mr. Stone said I might ask you some few things, if I liked an&rsquo; you
    can answer or not, as you like. This ain&rsquo;t no orficial investigation,
    but I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;re as intrusted as anybody in findin&rsquo; this
    here Victoria Van Allen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in finding the murderer of Mr. Schuyler,&rdquo; I
    replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; maybe they ain&rsquo;t one an&rsquo; the same. That&rsquo;s
    so.&rdquo; He spoke thoughtfully and scanned my face with a quizzical glance. &ldquo;But,
    of course, Mr. Stone&rsquo;ll find out. Now, Mr. Calhoun, if you don&rsquo;t
    mind, will you give me a line on that maid person, that Julia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Julie, she is called.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Julie goes. Is she a young thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; just this side of middle-aged. Probably thirty-five or so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good looker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, about average. Brown hair, brownish eyes&mdash;really, I never
    noticed her closely enough to think about her appearance. She is, I&rsquo;m
    sure, a good servant and devoted to Miss Van Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you know anything special? Anything that would pick
    her out from a lot of other good servants?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In appearance, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of anything. Let me see. She wears glasses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What sort?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Just ordinary glasses, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spectacles or nose-riders?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. Spectacles, I think. And she has a great many
    gold-filled teeth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Front ones?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that is, they&rsquo;re very noticeable when she speaks to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s sumpum. Is she quick and spry-like, or poky?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I smiled at the boy&rsquo;s eagerness. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s rather alert,&rdquo; I
    said, &ldquo;but, of course, quiet and respectful. I never looked at her
    with any personal interest, so I can only give you my general impressions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; and the boy looked very serious, &ldquo;wherever
    Miss Van Allen is, that Julie&rsquo;s there, too. And when Miss Van Allen
    wants errands done, of course, she sends Julie. And, of course, said Julie
    is disguised. I dope out all this has to be so. For Miss Van Allen has mailed
    letters and&mdash;oh, well, of course she could mail letters in lots of ways,
    but sumpum tells me, that she depends on Miss Julie as an errand girl. So,
    I want to find out the look of the Julie person, and see if I can&rsquo;t
    track her down, and so get at Miss Van Allen. Vicky Van, I believe her friends
    call her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They do,&rdquo; said I, looking sternly at the boy, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
    say right here, that I&rsquo;m one of her friends, and I won&rsquo;t stand
    for any impertinence or any remarks of any sort about that lady. If she is
    suspected of this crime, let the law take its course, but until there is
    some direct evidence, don&rsquo;t you dare to connect her name with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only obeying Mr. Stone&rsquo;s orders. And, take it from
    me, Mr. Calhoun, I ain&rsquo;t so fresh as to make remarks about a lady.
    I&rsquo;m a prevaricator of the truth, but only when it&rsquo;s abserlutely
    necessary. And on the other hand, I&rsquo;m a born protector of women. Why,
    I&rsquo;d be only too tickled to find a gentleman suspect. Or, at least,
    to clear Miss Van Allen from all s&rsquo;picion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you feel such a kindly interest in the lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This house, for one reason. You see, I&rsquo;ve been all over it,
    at Mr. Stone&rsquo;s orders, and I ree&rsquo;lize what a nice lady she is.
    I don&rsquo;t have to see her, to understand her tastes and her &lsquo;complishments.
    Why, jest the books on her centre tables and the records for her phonograph
    spell her out for me, in words of one syllable. And, though I&rsquo;m hunting
    for her, it isn&rsquo;t with a solid hunch that&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s the knife-sticker.
    Not by no means. But find her I&rsquo;ve gotto! Because F. Stone says for
    me to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked at the boy more curiously. He was a strange admixture of street
    boy and sleuth. His quick, darting eyes were never still, but warily alert
    to catch the meaning of any sound or motion on my part. I felt as if he read
    me through, and would not have been surprised to have him tell me he knew
    of my recent communications with Vicky. But I only said, &ldquo;You are,
    then, Mr. Stone&rsquo;s right-hand man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I put it that way, yes. But really, I&rsquo;m his apprentice, and
    I&rsquo;m learning his trade. I study his methods, and I add some gumption
    of my own, and if I can help him, I&rsquo;m glad and happy. And anyway, I&rsquo;m
    learning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And this talk about your lying? Is that straight goods?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If it is, how can you believe what I tell you?&rdquo; he asked, whimsically. &ldquo;But,
    I used to be a fierce liar. Then, gettin&rsquo; in with F. Stone, made me
    see it&rsquo;s wrong to lie&mdash;usuerly, that is. So I don&rsquo;t, now&mdash;leastways,
    not much. Only when it&rsquo;s jest the only thing to do to save game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How does Mr. Stone know when you&rsquo;re telling the truth, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good land, I don&rsquo;t lie to him! I wouldn&rsquo;t, and if I did,
    it wouldn&rsquo;t be any use. He&rsquo;d see through me, quicker&rsquo;n
    scat! But, honest, I wouldn&rsquo;t. You see, he&rsquo;s my idol, yes sir,
    my idol, that&rsquo;s what that man is! Well, Mr. Calhoun, as you&rsquo;ve
    told me all you can pry loose from your stock of infermation, you an&rsquo; me
    may as well make our adooses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know I haven&rsquo;t revealed all I know of the case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I read from your mobile counternance that you&rsquo;re keepin&rsquo; sumpum
    back, but it don&rsquo;t matter. F. Stone&rsquo;ll nail it, when he gets
    good an&rsquo; ready. What I wanted from you was mostly the speakin&rsquo; likeness
    of the Julie dame. An&rsquo; I guess I got it. Oh, say, one other thing.
    Who among Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s friends is an artist?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Gale is one. Miss Ariadne Gale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. And will you gimme her address?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I did so, and then I went away, thinking Fleming Stone a queer sort of detective
    to have for assistant such an illiterate, uncultured boy as Fibsy. The name
    was enough to condemn him! But as I thought the little chap over, I realized
    that his talk had been clear-headed and to the point, besides showing sagacity
    and perspicacity.</p>
  <p>It was growing late, but after this interview I felt I must see Ruth for
    a few minutes, so called at the Schuyler house.</p>
  <p>She greeted me cordially and seemed glad to see me. Winnie was still acting
    as secretary for her, but the rush of notes of condolence was over, and as
    Ruth was not, of course, giving or accepting social invitations, there was
    not so much work for Win as at first. But the two had become fast friends,
    and Winnie told me how they sat together chatting often for pleasant half
    hours at a time.</p>
  <p>I told Ruth about the strange boy at Vicky Van&rsquo;s house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about him. Mr. Stone
    picked him up somewhere and he uses him as a sort of outside scout. He has
    all confidence in him, though I believe the little chap rejoices in the name
    of Fibber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fibsy,&rdquo; I corrected. &ldquo;He is certainly a bright youth.
    And he plans to hunt down Miss Van Allen by means of her maid, Julie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are they together?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We only suppose so. It seems probable, that Miss Van Allen would
    want the help, if not the protection of her servant. Julie is a most capable
    woman, and devoted to her mistress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard so. I have a kind, thoughtful woman, too, and I
    should miss her terribly were I without her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, but your Tibbetts is a servant, and nothing more. This Julie
    was a real friend to Miss Van Allen, and looked after her in every way. Housekeeper,
    maid, nurse, and general bodyguard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Van Allen must have needed such a person, since, as I am
    told, she lived alone. My sisters-in-law are quite in love with the Van Allen
    house. Both they and Winnie have been singing its praises this morning. It
    seems your Vicky Van is a lady of most refined tastes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She certainly is. I can&rsquo;t help thinking if you and she had
    known each other, in favorable circumstances, you would have been friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be. I have never felt sure that she is the guilty one, but
    I have changed my mind about not wanting her to be found. I do want that
    she should be. Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s sisters have shown me that to hesitate
    at or neglect any means of hunting her out would be wrong. And so, I am glad
    we have Mr. Stone and I hope he will succeed in his search.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What changed your mind, especially?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I realized that it would be disloyalty to my husband&rsquo;s memory
    to let his possible slayer go free. The girl must be found, and then if she
    can be freed of suspicion, very well, but the case must be investigated fully.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dare say you are right. Mr. Schuyler was a man of importance and
    influence, and aside from that, every deed of blood calls for revenge. I
    honor you for deciding as you have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is justice that moves me, more than my personal inclination,&rdquo; Ruth
    went on. &ldquo;I will not deny, Mr. Calhoun, that in some ways, my husband&rsquo;s
    death has freed me from certain restrictions that hampered and galled me.
    I shouldn&rsquo;t mention this to you, but I know the sisters have told you
    that I have, in many ways, gone counter to Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s wishes, since
    I have been my own mistress. It is true. He and I disagreed greatly on matters
    of the household and matters of my personal comfort and convenience. Now
    that I can do so, I am arranging my life differently. It is natural that
    I should do this, but the Schuyler ladies think that I have begun indecently
    soon. I say this, not by way of apology, but because I want you to understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ruth looked very sweet and wistful, as she seemed to make a bid for my sympathy.
    I was impressed anew by the soft pallor of her face and the sweet purity
    of her gray eyes. I contrasted her with Vicky Van. One, the embodiment of
    life and gayety, the other a gentle, dovelike personality, which, however,
    hinted sometimes at hidden fires. I believed that Ruth Schuyler had been
    so repressed, so dominated by her brute of a husband, that her nature had
    never expanded to its own possibilities.</p>
  <p>And, like a blinding flash of lightning, the knowledge came to me that I
    loved her! It was no uncertain conviction. The fact sprang full-armed, to
    my brain, and my heart swelled with the bliss of it.</p>
  <p>I scarcely dared look at her. I couldn&rsquo;t tell her&mdash;yet. I had
    no reason to think she cared for me, other than as the merest acquaintance,
    yet, then and there, I vowed to myself that she should care.</p>
  <p>I thought of Vicky Van&mdash;poor little Vicky. She had interested me&mdash;did
    interest me, but in only a friendly way. Indeed, my interest in her was prompted
    by sympathy for her luckless position and the trust she had reposed in me,
    I would hold her trust sacred. I would never play false to Vicky Van. But
    henceforth and forever my heart and soul belonged to my liege lady, my angel-faced
    Ruth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Mr. Calhoun?&rdquo; I heard her saying, and I
    looked up to see her smiling almost gayly at me. &ldquo;Your thoughts seem
    to be a thousand miles away!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, not so far as that,&rdquo; I protested. Somehow, I felt buoyantly
    happy. I had no wish to tell her of my love, at present I was quite content
    to worship her in secret, and I exulted in a sort of clairvoyant knowledge
    that I should yet win her. I smiled into her dear eyes, as I continued: &ldquo;They
    were really round the corner in Vicky Van&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To my delight she pouted a little. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk of something
    else,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt Miss Van Allen is charming,
    and her home a perfect gem, but I own up I&rsquo;m not anxious to discuss
    her all the time and with every one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You shall be exempt from it with me,&rdquo; I promised. &ldquo;Henceforth
    her name is taboo between us, and you shall choose our subjects yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s talk about me. Now, you know, Mr. Calhoun, I never
    see Mr. Bradbury, so you must be my legal adviser in all my quandaries. First,
    and this is a serious matter, I don&rsquo;t want to continue to live with
    the Schuyler ladies. We are diametrically opposed on all matters of opinion,
    and disagree on many matters of fact.&rdquo; Ruth smiled, and I marveled
    afresh at the way her face lighted up when she indulged in that little smile
    of hers. &ldquo;Nor,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;do they want to live with
    me. So, it ought to be an easy matter to please us all. As to the house and
    furnishings, they are all mine, but if the sisters prefer to live here, and
    let me go elsewhere, I am willing to give them the house and its contents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t care for this type of residence,&rdquo; I
    said, &ldquo;indeed, Miss Schuyler said yesterday, as we looked over Vicky
    Van&rsquo;s house, that it was just the sort of thing you liked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t think I would like her house! I supposed it was
    a plain little affair. Harmonious and pretty, Winnie says, but she didn&rsquo;t
    give me the impression it was elaborate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t. And it wouldn&rsquo;t be as grand as your home
    ought to be. But mention of the girl is not allowed, I believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She smiled again, and resumed: &ldquo;Well, I want you to sound the Schuyler
    sisters, and find out their wishes. When I speak to them, they only say for
    me to wait until after the mystery is solved and all this horrid publicity
    and notoriety at an end. But I want to go away from them now. I want Mr.
    Stone to do his work, and I hope he will find that girl and all that, but
    I can&rsquo;t stand it to live in this atmosphere of detectives and reporters
    and policemen any longer than I must. Would it do for me to go to some quiet
    hotel for a while? I could take Tibbetts, and just be quietly by myself,
    while the Schuylers continue to live in this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I thought it over. I understood perfectly how she hated to be questioned
    continually as to her life with her late husband, for I was beginning to
    realize that that life had been a continuous tragedy. Nothing much definite,
    but many sidelights and stray hints had shown me how he had treated her,
    and how patiently she had borne it. And, now he was gone, and I, for one,
    didn&rsquo;t blame her that she wanted to get away from the scenes of her
    slavery to him. For it had been that. He had enforced his ideas and opinions
    upon her, until she had been allowed to do nothing and to have nothing as
    she wished.</p>
  <p>And now, she desired only peace and quietness somewhere, anywhere, away
    from the two who represented Randolph Schuyler&rsquo;s tyranny and carping
    criticism without his right to obtrude them on her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will speak to them,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure we
    can arrange some mode of life for you which will give you rest and freedom
    of judgment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, if you only can!&rdquo; she murmured, as she held out a friendly
    hand.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter16AFutileChase"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  A Futile
    Chase</strong></h2>
  <p>It was Sunday afternoon, and we were in conclave in the Schuyler library.
    Fleming Stone was summing up his results of the past few days and, though
    it was evident he had done all that mortal man could do, yet he had no hint
    or clue as to where Vicky Van might be.</p>
  <p>And, he held, that nothing else was of consequence compared to this knowledge.
    She must be found, and whether that could be done quickly, by search or by
    chance, or whether it would take a long time of waiting, he could not say.
    He felt sure, that she must disclose herself, sooner or later, but if not,
    and if their search continued unavailing, then he held out no hope for success.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a unique case,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in my experience.
    All depends on finding that woman. If she is innocent, herself, she knows
    who did it. And, if she is the guilty one, she is clever enough to remain
    hidden. It may be she is miles away, out of the country, perhaps. She has
    had ample time to make arrangements to go abroad, or to any distant place.
    Her guilt seems to me probable, because she has literally abandoned her house
    and her belongings. An innocent woman would scarcely leave all those modern
    and valuable furnishings unless for some very strong reason. But as to finding
    her&mdash;a needle in a haystack presents an easy problem by contrast!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doubtless she is hiding in the house of some friend,&rdquo; suggested
    Ruth, thoughtfully. &ldquo;It seems to me she must have been taken in and
    cared for by some one who loved her, that night she disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; agreed Stone. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been
    to see all her friends that I can find out about. I&rsquo;ve called on a
    score of them, finding their addresses in her address book that Mr. Lowney
    gave me. Of course, they may have been deceiving me, but I feel safe in asserting
    that she is not under the protection of any one I interviewed. She returned
    to her house last Monday night, the police believe, for the purpose of getting
    her mail. This shows a daring almost unbelievable! That mail must have been
    of desperate importance to her. She has not been to the house since, they
    feel sure, and since I have been on the case she could not have entered,
    for I have kept it under strict surveillance. I think she will never return
    to it. Presumably she got the letters she was so anxious for. Her mail, that
    has arrived the last few days, I have not opened, but the envelopes show
    mostly tradesmen&rsquo;s cards, or are indubitably social correspondence.
    There seem to be no letters from lawyers or financial firms. However, if
    nothing develops, I shall open the letters. This case, being unprecedented,
    necessitates unusual proceedings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed in you, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; said Rhoda Schuyler,
    testily; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose you were superhuman, but I did think,
    with your reputation and all, you would be able to find that woman. I&rsquo;ve
    heard say that nobody could absolutely vanish in New York City, and not be
    traced.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t regret my so-far failure a bit more than I do, Miss
    Schuyler, but I feel no shame or embarrassment over it. Nor am I ready to
    admit myself beaten. I have a theory, or, rather a conviction that there
    is one and only one explanation of this strange affair. I am not quite ready
    to expound this, but in a day or two I shall find if it is the true solution,
    and if so I shall soon find Miss Van Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew you would,&rdquo; and Sarah Schuyler nodded her head, in satisfaction. &ldquo;I
    told Rhoda to give you more time and you would not disappoint us. All right,
    Mr. Stone, use all the time you need. But no Schuyler must remain unavenged.
    I want to see that woman killed&mdash;yes, killed, for her murder of my brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sarah Schuyler looked like a figure of Justice herself, as, with flashing
    eyes she declared her wrath. And it was her right. Her brother&rsquo;s blood
    called out for vengeance. But the more gentle-souled Ruth shuddered and shrank
    from this stern arraignment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Sarah,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;not killed! Don&rsquo;t condemn
    a woman to that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not, Ruth? If a woman can kill, a woman should be killed. But
    she won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; she added, bitterly. &ldquo;No jury ever convicts
    a woman, no matter how clearly her guilt is proven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just then Fibsy appeared. He was a strange little figure, and showed a shy
    awkwardness at the grandeur of his surroundings. He bobbed a funny little
    curtsy to Ruth, whom he already adored, and with an embarrassed nod, included
    the rest of us in a general greeting.</p>
  <p>Then to Fleming Stone he said, in an eager, triumphant tone, &ldquo;I got &lsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got what?&rdquo; asked Ruth, smiling at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got pictures of Miss Van Allen, and Julie, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Ruth, interested at once; &ldquo;let me see them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fibsy glanced at her and then at Stone, and handed a parcel to the latter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my boss,&rdquo; the boy said, as if by way of apology
    for slighting her request.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone opened the parcel and showed two sketches.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Gale made them,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I sent Fibsy over
    there to induce her to give us at least a hint of Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s
    personal appearance. The boy could wheedle it from her, when I couldn&rsquo;t.
    See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He handed the pictures to Miss Rhoda, for he, too, respected authority,
    but we all gathered round to look.</p>
  <p>They were the merest sketches. A wash of water-color, but they showed merit.
    As the only one present who knew Vicky Van, I was asked of the truth of their
    portraiture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fairly good,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;yes, more than that. This of Vicky
    shows the coloring of her face and hair and the general effect of her costume,
    more than her actual physiognomy. But it is certainly a close enough likeness
    to make her recognizable if you find her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And this was true. Ariadne had caught the sidelong glance of Vicky Van&rsquo;s
    dark-lashed eyes, and the curve of her scarlet lips. The coloring was perfect,
    just Vicky&rsquo;s vivid tints, and the dark hair, looped over her ears,
    was as she always wore it. Ariadne had drawn her in the gown she had worn
    that fatal evening, and the women eagerly scrutinized the gorgeous costume.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No wonder those long strands of fringe caught in that scraggly mirror
    frame!&rdquo; exclaimed Winnie, who never missed a point.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;If she whirled around as you did,
    Miss Calhoun, it&rsquo;s a wonder she didn&rsquo;t spoil her whole gown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The pose and the figure were not exactly Vicky&rsquo;s. Ariadne wasn&rsquo;t
    much on catching a likeness or a physical effect. But the color and atmosphere
    were fine, and I told this to Stone, who agreed that it was a decided help
    in the search.</p>
  <p>Julie&rsquo;s portrait was the same. Not a real likeness of the woman, but
    an impressionist transcript of her salient points. The gray gown and white
    apron, the thick-rimmed glasses, the parted lips, showing slightly protruding
    teeth, the plainly parted brown hair, all were the real Julie; and yet, except
    for these accessories I&rsquo;m not sure I could have recognized the subject
    of the sketch. However, as I told Stone, it certainly was a helpful indication
    of the sort of woman he was to look for, and even in disguise, the physical
    characteristics must show.</p>
  <p>The detective was positive that wherever Vicky Van and Julie were, or whatever
    they were doing, they were in all probability disguised, and thoroughly so,
    or they must have been discovered ere this.</p>
  <p>To my amusement, Fibsy and Ruth were holding a tete-a-tete conversation.
    The kind-hearted woman had, doubtless, felt sorry for the boy&rsquo;s shyness,
    and had drawn him into chat to put him at his ease.</p>
  <p>She had succeeded, too, for he was animated, and had lost his self-consciousness
    under the charm of her smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll bet your birthday comes in the spring,&rdquo; he was
    saying, as I caught the tenor of their talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; said Ruth, looking surprised. &ldquo;How did you
    guess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause you&rsquo;re just like a little spring flower&mdash;a
    white crocus or a bit of arbutus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then, noting my attention, the boy was covered with confusion and blushed
    to the tips of his ears. He rose from where he sat, and shuffled awkwardly
    around the great room, devoting exaggerated attention to some books in the
    glassed cases, and twirling his fingers in acute embarrassment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You scared him away,&rdquo; chided Ruth, under her breath, as our
    glances met. &ldquo;He and I were getting positively chummy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why was he talking of your birthday? I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. He said I was born in the spring,
    because I&rsquo;m like a flower! Really, that child will grow up a poet,
    if he doesn&rsquo;t look out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are like a flower,&rdquo; I murmured back. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m
    glad your birthday is in spring. I mean to celebrate it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then I thought of poor Vicky Van&rsquo;s birthday, so tragically ended,
    and I quickly changed the subject.</p>
  <p>Armed with the pictures, Fleming Stone and his young assistant spent the
    next day on a still hunt.</p>
  <p>And in the evening Stone came over to see me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A little quiet confab,&rdquo; he said, as we secluded ourselves in
    my sitting-room and closed the door, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to a score of
    places, and invariably they recognize Miss Van Allen and her maid, but all
    say they&rsquo;ve not seen her since the tragedy. I went to shops, offices,
    the bank and places where she would be likely to need to go. Also, her friends&rsquo; houses.
    But nothing doing. The shops have heard from her, in the way of paid bills,
    checks and such matters, but I learned absolutely nothing that throws any
    light on her whereabouts. Now, Mr. Calhoun, the very thoroughness of her
    disappearance, the very inviolable secrecy of her hiding-place proves to
    me that she isn&rsquo;t hiding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; I said, smiling, &ldquo;you talk like a real
    story-book detective. Cryptic utterances of that sort are impressive to the
    layman, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; and he looked annoyed, &ldquo;if you knew anything
    about detective work, you&rsquo;d know that the most seemingly impossible
    conditions are often the easiest to explain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, explain. I&rsquo;ll be glad to hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will. And, in return, Mr. Calhoun, I&rsquo;m going to ask you if
    you don&rsquo;t think, that all things considered, you ought to tell me what
    you are keeping back? You won&rsquo;t mind, will you, if I say that I have
    deduced, from evidence,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;that your interests are
    largely coincident with those of Mrs. Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on,&rdquo; I said, shortly, but not annoyed at his perspicacity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, I assure you that Mrs. Schuyler is most desirous of locating
    Miss Van Allen. She is not so revengeful or vituperative as the sisters of
    her husband, but she feels it is due to her husband&rsquo;s memory to find
    his slayer, if possible. Now suppose you tell me what you know, and I promise
    to keep it an inviolate confidence except so far as it actually helps the
    progress of the wheels of justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do want to do what is best for Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s interests,&rdquo; I
    said, after I had thought a moment. &ldquo;But, I must confess, I have a
    certain sympathy and pity for Victoria Van Allen. I cannot believe her guilty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then tell me frankly the truth. If you are right, and she is not
    the murderer, the truth can&rsquo;t harm her. And if she is the guilty person,
    you are compounding a felony, in the eyes of the law, to withhold your information.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone spoke a little sternly, and I realized he was right. If Vicky were
    untraceably hidden, all I could tell wouldn&rsquo;t hurt her. And, too, I
    couldn&rsquo;t see that it would, anyway. Moreover, as Stone said, I was
    making myself amenable to the law, by a refusal to tell all I knew, and since
    I was so aware of my own devotion to Ruth Schuyler, I felt I had no right
    to do anything that she would disapprove. And, I knew that a touch of feminine
    pique in her disposition would resent any consideration of Vicky over her
    own claims!</p>
  <p>Therefore, I told Fleming Stone all I knew of Victoria Van Allen, both before,
    during and after the occasion of her birthday party.</p>
  <p>He listened, with his deep eyes fixed on my face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most extraordinary!&rdquo; he said, at last, after I had finished. &ldquo;I
    never heard of such daring! To enter her own house when it was watched by
    the police&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only the post patrol, then,&rdquo; I reminded him. &ldquo;She could
    easily manage between his rounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know. But you&rsquo;ve put the whole thing in different
    focus. Tell me more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no more to tell, but I went over my story again, amplifying and
    remembering further details, until we had spent the whole evening. He egged
    me on by questions and his burning, eager eyes seemed to drink in my words
    as if they were so much priceless wisdom.</p>
  <p>And I told him, too, that I had promised to put Vicky&rsquo;s address book
    in the Chinese jar for her that very evening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, promptly. &ldquo;She meant
    to meet you there, I&rsquo;m sure, but I&rsquo;m also sure she changed her
    mind about that, when she learned of my advent. However, we&rsquo;ll keep
    your promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Acting at his instructions, I went with him over to Vicky Van&rsquo;s. It
    was about midnight, and as he had the address book with him, he kept possession
    of it.</p>
  <p>We went in the house, and in the dark, felt our way up to the music room.
    Stone put the book in the jar, and motioned for me to hide behind a sofa.
    He himself took up his vigil behind a window-curtain, of heavy brocade.</p>
  <p>He had planned all this, before we left my house, and no word was spoken
    as we took our places. His hope was that Vicky would come into the house
    late and go straight for her book and quickly out again. He had directed
    me to wait until she had really abstracted the book from the jar and then,
    as she was leaving the room, spring after her and stop her.</p>
  <p>I obeyed orders implicitly, and, as Stone had warned me, we had a bit of
    a wait. I grew cramped and tired, and at last I gave up all hope of Vicky&rsquo;s
    appearance.</p>
  <p>And then, she came!</p>
  <p>Silently, absolutely without sound, she glided in from the hall. My eyes,
    now accustomed to the semi-gloom of the room, could discern her figure as
    it approached the great vase. Softly, she raised the cover, she abstracted
    the book, and with noiseless touch was replacing the cover, when she threw
    back her head, as if she sensed our presence. I had made no move, nor had
    I heard a breath of sound from Stone, but Vicky knew some one was present.
    I knew that by her startled movement. She gave a stifled scream, and pushing
    the great jar off on the floor, where it crashed to pieces, she rushed out
    of the room and down stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After her, Calhoun! Fly!&rdquo; shouted Stone, and as he flung back
    the heavy curtains the street lights illuminated the scene. But as we avoided
    the broken fragments we bumped together and lost a few seconds in our recovery
    from the impact.</p>
  <p>This gave Vicky a start, and we heard the street door slam as we raced down
    the stairs. Here, too, we lost a second or two, for I stepped back to give
    Stone space just as he did the same for me, and when we had reached the foot
    of the stairs, leaped through the hall, wrenched open the door and dashed
    down the steps to the pavement, we saw the flying figure of Vicky Van round
    the Fifth Avenue corner, and turn South.</p>
  <p>After her we ran, as fast as mortal man can run, I verily believe, and when
    we reached the Avenue there was no one in sight!</p>
  <p>Stone stood stock-still, looking down the street.</p>
  <p>The Avenue was lighted, as usual, and we could see a block and more in both
    directions, but no sign of Vicky. Nor was there a pedestrian abroad, or a
    motor. The Avenue was absolutely uninhabited, as far as our eyes could reach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d she go?&rdquo; I panted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Into some house, or, maybe, hiding in an area. We must search them
    all, but very warily. She&rsquo;s a witch, a wonder-woman, but all the same,
    the earth didn&rsquo;t open and swallow her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We searched every area way on the block. One of us would go in and explore
    while the other stood guard. The third house was the Schuyler residence,
    but Stone also searched thoroughly in its basement entrance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All dark and locked up,&rdquo; he reported, as he came out from there. &ldquo;And,
    of course, she wouldn&rsquo;t seek sanctuary there! But I&rsquo;ve wondered
    if she isn&rsquo;t concealed in one of these nearby houses, as she has such
    ready access to her own home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But it was impossible. Every basement entrance was locked and bolted for
    the night and all the windows were dark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s given us the slip,&rdquo; said Stone, in deep chagrin. &ldquo;But
    perhaps she crossed the street. Maybe she didn&rsquo;t run down this side
    very far. Let&rsquo;s go over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We crossed and looked over the stone wall of the park. Surely Vicky Van
    had not had time to scramble over that wall before we reached the corner.
    It had been not more than a few seconds after we saw her flying form turn
    down the Avenue, and she couldn&rsquo;t have crossed the street and scaled
    the wall in that time!</p>
  <p>Where was she? What had become of her?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ring up the houses and inquire,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
    justified in doing that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;If she was expected they won&rsquo;t
    give her away, and if she isn&rsquo;t there, they&rsquo;d be pretty angry
    at our intrusion. I&rsquo;ll admit, Calhoun, I&rsquo;ve never been so mystified
    in my life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor I!&rdquo; I emphatically agreed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter17TheGoldFringedGown"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  The Gold-Fringed
    Gown</strong></h2>
  <p>After that night Fleming Stone became more desperately in earnest in his
    search for Vicky. It seemed as if the sight of her, the realization that
    she was a real woman and not a myth, had whetted his eagerness to discover
    her hiding place and bring her to book.</p>
  <p>He established himself in her house, and both he and Fibsy practically lived
    there, going out for their meals or picnicking in the basement room. This
    room became his headquarters, and a plain clothes man was on duty whenever
    Stone and Fibsy were both absent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Though I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll ever come back again,&rdquo; Stone
    declared, gloomily. &ldquo;She was desperately anxious for that address book,
    and so she got it, through my stupidity. I might have known she&rsquo;d make
    a dash for the street door. I should have had that exit guarded. But I&rsquo;ve
    seen her, and I&rsquo;ll get her yet! At any rate she hasn&rsquo;t left the
    country, or hadn&rsquo;t last night, whatever she may do to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was the day after Vicky had given us the slip. It was midafternoon, and
    I had gone to see Stone, on my return from my office. I was sadly neglecting
    my own business nowadays, but Mr. Bradbury looked after it, and he sanctioned
    my devotion to the Schuyler cause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Randolph Schuyler was an important citizen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
    his murderer must be apprehended if possible. Do all you can, Calhoun, for
    humanity&rsquo;s sake and the law&rsquo;s. Take all the time you want to,
    I&rsquo;ll see to your important business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So, though I went downtown every morning, I came back at noon or soon after
    and plunged afresh into the work of finding Vicky Van.</p>
  <p>There was little I could do, but Stone consulted and questioned me continually
    as to Vicky&rsquo;s habits or pursuits, and I told him frankly all I knew.</p>
  <p>Also I managed to make business matters loom up so importantly as to necessitate
    frequent calls on Ruth Schuyler, and I spent most of my afternoon hours in
    the Fifth Avenue house.</p>
  <p>And Ruth was most kind to me. I couldn&rsquo;t say she showed affection
    or even especial interest, but she turned to me as a confidant and we had
    many long, pleasant conversations when the subject of the mystery was not
    touched upon.</p>
  <p>Though she never said a word against Randolph Schuyler, I couldn&rsquo;t
    help learning that, aside from the horror of it, his death was to her a blessed
    relief. He had not been a good man, nor had he been a good husband. On the
    contrary, he had blighted Ruth&rsquo;s whole life by thwarting her every
    innocent desire for gayety or pleasure.</p>
  <p>For instance, she spoke of her great enjoyment of light opera or farce comedy,
    but as Mr. Schuyler didn&rsquo;t care for such entertainment he had never
    allowed her to go. He had a box at the Grand Opera, and Ruth loved to go,
    but she liked lighter music also.</p>
  <p>This was not told complainingly, but transpired in the course of a conversation
    at which Fibsy chanced to be present.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; he said, looking at Ruth commiseratingly, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t
    you never heard &lsquo;The Jitney Girl&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Prince of Peoria&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ruth shook her head, smiling at the boy&rsquo;s amazement. There was a subtle
    sympathy between these two that surprised me, for Ruth Schuyler was fastidious
    in her choice of friends. But he amused her, and he was never really impertinent&mdash;merely
    naive and unconventional.</p>
  <p>Well, on the day I speak of, Stone and I sat in the basement room awaiting
    Fibsy&rsquo;s return. He was out after certain information and we hoped much
    from it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I gotta bunch o&rsquo; dope,&rdquo; he announced, as he suddenly
    appeared before us. &ldquo;Dunno &lsquo;s it&rsquo;ll pan out much, but listen &lsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
    spill a earful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I had learned that Fibsy, or Terence, as we ought to call him, was trying
    to discard his street slang, and was succeeding fairly well, save in moments
    of great excitement or importance. And so, I hoped from his slangy beginning,
    that he had found some fresh data.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I chased up that chore boy first,&rdquo; he related, &ldquo;an&rsquo; he
    didn&rsquo;t know anything at all. Said Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s a lovely lady,
    but he &lsquo;most never saw her, the Julie dame did all the orderin&rsquo; an&rsquo; payin&rsquo; s&rsquo;far&rsquo;s
    he was concerned. Good pay, but irregular work. She&rsquo;d be here a day
    or two, an&rsquo; then like&rsquo;s not go &lsquo;way for a week. Well, we
    knew that before. Then, next, I tracked to his lair the furnace man. Same
    story. Here to-day an&rsquo; gone to-morrer, as the song says. &lsquo;Course,
    he ain&rsquo;t only a stoker, he&rsquo;s really an odd job man&mdash;ashes,
    sidewalks, an&rsquo; such. Well, he didn&rsquo;t help none&mdash;any, I mean.
    But,&rdquo; and the shock of red hair seemed to bristle with triumph, &ldquo;I
    loined one thing! That Julie has been to the sewing woman and the laundress
    lady and shut &lsquo;em up! Yes, sir! that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s done!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell it all,&rdquo; said Stone, briefly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I struck the seamstress first. She wouldn&rsquo;t tell a thing,
    and I said, calmly, &lsquo;I know Julie paid you to keep your mouth shut,
    but if you don&rsquo;t tell, the law&rsquo;ll make you!&rsquo; That scared
    her, and she owned up that Julie was to see her &lsquo;bout a week ago and
    give her fifty dollars not to tell anything at all whatsomever about Miss
    Van Allen! Some girl, that Vicky Van!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Julie went there herself!&rdquo; I cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yep. The real Julie, gold teeth and all. But I quizzed the needle
    pusher good and plenty, and she don&rsquo;t know much of evidential value.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was always funny when Fibsy interlarded his talk with legal phrases,
    but he was unconscious of any incongruity and went on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, as I dope it out, she&rsquo;s accustomed to sit in Miss
    Van Allen&rsquo;s boodore a-sewin&rsquo; an&rsquo; might have overheard some
    gossip or sumpum like that, an&rsquo; Miss Van Allen was afraid she&rsquo;d
    scatter it, an&rsquo; so she sent Julie to shut her up. I don&rsquo;t believe
    the woman knows where Miss Van is now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must see her,&rdquo; said Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. She won&rsquo;t get away. She&rsquo;s a regular citizen,
    an&rsquo; respectable at that. Well, then, the laundress. To her also Julie
    had likewise went. An&rsquo; to her also Julie had passed the spondulicks.
    Now, I don&rsquo;t understand that so well, for laundresses don&rsquo;t overhear
    the ladies talkin&rsquo;, but, anyway, Julie told her if she wouldn&rsquo;t
    answer a question to anybody, she&rsquo;d give her half a century, too. And
    did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doubtless the laundress knew something Miss Van Allen wants kept
    secret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doubtless, sir,&rdquo; said Fibsy, gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; mused Stone, &ldquo;that it would
    help us any to learn all those women know. If Miss Van Allen thought they
    could help us find her, she would give them more than that for silence or
    get them out of the city altogether.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is Miss Van Allen, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fibsy asked the question casually, as one expectant of an answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the city, Fibs, living as somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yep, that&rsquo;s so. Over on the West side, say, among the artist
    lady&rsquo;s studio gang?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe so. But she has full freedom of action and goes about as she
    likes. Julie also. They come here whenever they choose, though I don&rsquo;t
    think they&rsquo;ll come while we&rsquo;re here. It&rsquo;s a queer state
    of things, Calhoun. What do you make of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Vicky is disguised. Her personality is too
    pronounced and so is Julie&rsquo;s. I think some friend is caring for them.
    Not Ariadne Gale, of that I&rsquo;m sure. But it may be Mrs. Reeves. She
    is very fond of Vicky and is clever enough to hide the girl all this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police have searched her house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, but Mrs. Reeves and Vicky could connive a plan that would
    hoodwink the police, I&rsquo;m pretty certain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look into that,&rdquo; and Stone made a note of it. &ldquo;About
    that carving knife, Fibsy. Did the caterers take it away by mistake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir; I &lsquo;vestergated that, an&rsquo; they didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That knife is an important thing, to my mind,&rdquo; the detective
    went on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; eagerly agreed Fibsy. &ldquo;It may yet cut the
    Gorgian knot! Why, Mr. Stone, the sewing lady knew that knife. She was here
    to lunching a few days before the moider, an&rsquo; she says she always sat
    at the table in the dining room to eat, after Miss Van Allen got through.
    An&rsquo; she says that knife was there, &lsquo;cos they had steak, an&rsquo; she
    used it herself. I described the fork puffeckly, an&rsquo; she reckernized
    it at onct.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bright boy!&rdquo; I exclaimed in involuntary tribute
    to this clever bit of work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m &lsquo;ssociated with Mr. Stone,&rdquo; said Fibsy, with
    a quiet twinkle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was clever,&rdquo; agreed Stone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, myself,
    that the absence of that small carving knife means something, but I can&rsquo;t
    fit it in yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We went up to the dining-room to look again at the carving fork, still in
    its place on the sideboard. I was always thrilled at a return to this room&mdash;always
    reminded of the awful tableau I had seen there.</p>
  <p>The long, slender fork lay in its place. Though it had been repeatedly examined
    and puzzled over, it had been carefully replaced.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; I offered, &ldquo;why a carving-knife
    should figure in the matter at all when the crime was committed with the
    little boning-knife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why the missing carving-knife ought to be a clue,&rdquo; said
    Stone, &ldquo;because its connection with the case is inexplicable. Now,
    where is that knife? Fibsy, where is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone&rsquo;s frequent appeals to the boy were often in a half-bantering
    tone, and yet, rather often, Terence returned an opinion or a bit of conjecture
    that turned Stone&rsquo;s cogitations in a fresh direction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; he said, this time, &ldquo;that knife is in
    this house. It&rsquo;s gotter be. That lady left the house in a mighty hurry
    but all the same she didn&rsquo;t go out a brandishin&rsquo; of a carvin&rsquo;-knife!
    Nor did she take it along an drop it in the street or an ash can for it&rsquo;d
    been found. So, she siccreted it summer, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s still in the
    house&mdash;unless&mdash;yes, unless she has taken it away since. You know,
    Mr. Stone, the Van Allen has been in this house more times than you&rsquo;d
    think for. Yes, sir, she has.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lots o&rsquo; ways. Frinst&rsquo; on Sat&rsquo;day, I noticed a clean
    squarish place in the dust on a table in the lady&rsquo;s bedroom, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
    where a book was. That book disappeared durin&rsquo; Friday night. I don&rsquo;t
    remember seein&rsquo; the book, I didn&rsquo;t notice it, to know what book
    it was, but the clean place in the dust couldn&rsquo;t get there no other
    way. Well, all is, it shows Miss Vick comes an&rsquo; goes pretty much as
    she likes&mdash;or did till you&rsquo;n me camped out here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you think she left the knife here that night, and has since
    returned and taken it away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I donno,&rdquo; Fibsy scowled in his effort to deduce the truth. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
    look!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He darted from the room and up the stairs. Stone rose to follow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That boy is uncanny at times,&rdquo; he said, seriously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    only too glad to follow his intuitions, and not seldom; he&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We went upstairs, and then on up to the next floor. Fibsy was in Vicky Van&rsquo;s
    dressing room, staring about him. He stood in the middle of the floor, his
    hands in his pockets, wheeling round on one heel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They say she ran upstairs &lsquo;fore she flew the coop,&rdquo; he
    murmured, not looking at us. &ldquo;That Miss Weldon said that. Well, if
    she did, she natchelly came up here for a cloak an&rsquo; bonnet. I&rsquo;ll
    never believe that level-headed young person went out into the cold woild
    in her glad rags, an&rsquo; no coverin&rsquo;. Well, then, say, she lef&rsquo; that
    knife here, locked up good an&rsquo; plenty. Where&mdash;<em>where</em>,
    I say, would she siccrete it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He glared round the room, as if trying to wrest the secret from its inanimate
    contents.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Stone says that walls have tongues. I believe it, an&rsquo; I
    know these walls are jest yellin&rsquo; the truth at me, an&rsquo; yet, I&rsquo;m
    so soul-deef I can&rsquo;t make out their lingo! Well, let&rsquo;s make a
    stab at it. Mr. Stone, I&rsquo;ll lay you that knife is in some drawer or
    cubbid in this here very room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe, Fibsy,&rdquo; said Stone, cheerfully. &ldquo;Where shall we
    look first?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All over.&rdquo; And Fibsy darted to a wardrobe and began feeling
    among the gowns and wraps hanging there. With a touch as light as a pickpocket&rsquo;s
    he slid his lightning-like fingers through the folds of silk and tulle, and
    turned back with a disappointed air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frisked the whole pack; nothin&rsquo; doin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;But
    don&rsquo;t give up the ship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We didn&rsquo;t. Having something definite to do, we did it thoroughly,
    and two men and a boy fingered every one of Vicky Van&rsquo;s available belongings
    in an amazingly short space of time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now for this chest,&rdquo; said Fibsy, indicating a large low box
    on rollers that he pulled out from under the couch.</p>
  <p>It was locked, but Stone picked it open, and threw back the cover. At the
    bottom of it, beneath several other gowns, we found the costume Vicky had
    worn the night of the murder!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My good land!&rdquo; ejaculated Fibsy, &ldquo;the gold-fringed rig!
    Ain&rsquo;t it classy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone lifted out the dress, heavy with its weight of gold beads, and held
    it up to view. On the flounces were stains of blood! And from the wrinkled
    folds fell, with a clatter to the floor, the missing carving-knife!</p>
  <p>I stooped to pick up the knife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Scuse me, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; cried Fibsy, grasping my hand, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
    touch it! Finger prints, you know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right, boy!&rdquo; and Stone nodded, approvingly. &ldquo;Pick it
    up, Fibsy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yessir,&rdquo; and taking from his pocket a pair of peculiar shaped
    tongs, Terence carefully lifted the knife and laid it on the glass-topped
    dressing table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probly all smudged anyway,&rdquo; he muttered, squinting closely
    at the knife. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s sure some marks on it! Gee, Mr. Stone,
    there&rsquo;s sumpum doin&rsquo;!&rdquo; His eyes shone and his skinny little
    fingers trembled with excitement of the chase.</p>
  <p>Stone studied the gold-fringed dress. The blood stains on the flounces,
    though dried and brown, were unmistakable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wonderful woman!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ve got
    this dress, and what of it? She put it here, not caring whether we got it
    or not. She&rsquo;s gone for good. She&rsquo;ll never be taken. This proves
    it to my mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the knife?&rdquo; I asked, thrilling with interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There you are again. If Miss Van Allen put that there for us to discover,
    the marks on it are of no use. Perhaps some she had put there purposely.
    You see, I&rsquo;m inclined to grant her any degree of cleverness from what
    I know of her ability so far. She is a witch. She can hoodwink anybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except F. Stone, Esquire,&rdquo; amended Fibsy. &ldquo;You pussieve,
    Mr. Calhoun, the far-famed detective, is already onto her coives!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone looked up to smile at the boy&rsquo;s speech, but he returned his
    gaze to the golden-trimmed gown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is improbable that she took
    this off before she left the house that night. I opine she threw a big cloak
    round her and rushed out to the house of some friend. Likely she found a
    taxicab or even commandeered some waiting private car for her flight. You
    know, we are dealing with no ordinary criminal. Now, if I am right, she brought
    this gown back here on some of her subsequent trips. As to the knife, I don&rsquo;t
    know. I see no explanation as yet. Since she stabbed her victim with another
    knife&mdash;why in the world hide this one up here? What say, Fibsy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Way past me. Maybe she was usin&rsquo; both knives, an&rsquo; the
    other one turned the trick, an&rsquo; when she got up here she seen she had
    this one still in her grip, an&rsquo; she slung it in this here chest to
    hide it. I ain&rsquo;t sure that&rsquo;s the c&rsquo;reck answer, but it&rsquo;ll
    do temp&rsquo;rar&rsquo;ly. I say, Mr. Stone, I got an awful funny thing
    to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be the first funny thing you&rsquo;ve asked me, Terence.
    What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s pretty near eatin&rsquo; time, an&rsquo;&mdash;aw,
    pshaw, I jest can&rsquo;t dare to say it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go ahead, old chap, I can&rsquo;t do more than annihilate you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I wanna go to the Schuylerses to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To dinner!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. An&rsquo; not to the kitchen eats, neither. I wanta set
    up to their gran&rsquo; table with their butlerses an&rsquo; feetmen, an&rsquo; be
    a nonnerd guest. Kin I, Mr. Stone? Say, kinni?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone looked at the eager, flushed face. He knew and I did, too,
    that there was something back of this request. But it couldn&rsquo;t be anything
    of vital importance to our mystery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I understand,&rdquo; said Stone, suddenly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
    taken a desperate fancy to Mrs. Schuyler and you want to further the acquaintance.
    But it isn&rsquo;t often done that way, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, now, don&rsquo;t kid me, Mr. Stone. Either lemme go or shut down
    on it, one o&rsquo; the six! But it&rsquo;s most nessary, I do assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe she won&rsquo;t have you. Why should those grand ladies allow
    a boy of your age at their dinner-table?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because you ask &lsquo;em, sir.&rdquo; Fibsy&rsquo;s tone was full
    of a quiet dignity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll ask them,&rdquo; and Stone went away to the
    telephone.</p>
  <p>Fibsy stood, looking raptly at the gold gown, and now and then his eyes
    turned toward the knife on the dressing-table. The table was covered with
    silver toilet implements, and save for its unfitting suggestion, the knife
    was unnoticeable among the other trinkets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Stone, returning. &ldquo;Mrs. Schuyler
    sends a cordial invitation for all three of us to dine with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Much obliged, I&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo; said Fibsy, unsmilingly.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter18FibsyDinesOut"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  Fibsy
    Dines Out</strong></h2>
  <p>That dinner at Ruth Schuyler&rsquo;s was memorable. And, yet, it was in
    no way markedly unusual. The service was perfect, as might be expected in
    that well-ordered household, and the guests were well behaved. Fibsy, thanks
    to Fleming Stone&rsquo;s thoughtful kindness, was arrayed in the proper dinner
    garb of a schoolboy, and his immaculate linen and correct jacket seemed to
    invest him in a mantle of politeness that sat well on his youthful buoyancy
    and enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>I glanced round the table. It was a strange combination of people. Fleming
    Stone was the sort of man who is at ease anywhere, and I, too, am adaptable
    by nature. But the Schuyler sisters were very evidently annoyed at the idea
    of receiving as an equal the youth whom they regarded as a mere street arab.</p>
  <p>Fibsy had become a firm friend of Ruth&rsquo;s, but he couldn&rsquo;t seem
    to like the other ladies, and he with difficulty refrained from showing this.</p>
  <p>The Misses Schuyler were impressive in their heavy and elaborate mourning,
    and to my mind Ruth looked far more appropriately dressed.</p>
  <p>She wore a black and white striped chiffon, with touches of black silk,
    and the effect, with her pale face and fair hair was lovely. A breastknot
    of valley lilies added to the loveliness, and I allowed my eyes to feast
    on her fairness. I had thought Ruth was not what could be called a pretty
    woman, certainly she was not beautiful; but that night her charm appealed
    to me more strongly than ever, and I concluded that her air of high-bred
    delicacy and infinite fineness were more to be desired than mere beauty.</p>
  <p>Fibsy, too, devoured her with his eyes, though discreetly, and when he thought
    he was not observed.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone devoted himself to the sisters; probably, I concluded, because
    he was in their employ, and so owed them his attention.</p>
  <p>Ruth wore her beautiful pearls, and referred to the fact, half-apologetically,
    saying that Mr. Schuyler had liked always to see them on her, and she felt
    privileged to continue to use them, even in her mourning period.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You like only poils&mdash;pearls, don&rsquo;t you, Mrs. Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fibsy&rsquo;s slip of pronunciation was due to his slight embarrassment
    at his novel surroundings, but he valiantly corrected himself and ignored
    it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I like other gems,&rdquo; Ruth replied, &ldquo;but Mr. Schuyler preferred
    pearls, and gave me such beauties that I have grown very fond of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember, Ruth,&rdquo; said Sarah, reminiscently, &ldquo;how you
    used to beg Randolph for sapphires and diamonds instead. You even wanted
    semi-precious stones&mdash;turquoises and topaz. Oh, I remember. But Randolph
    taught you that pearls were the best taste for a young matron and you grudgingly
    acquiesced.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, not grudgingly, Sarah,&rdquo; and Ruth flushed at the reprimand
    in her sister&rsquo;s voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, grudgingly. Even unwillingly. In fact, all Randolph&rsquo;s
    decisions you fought until he made you surrender. You know how you wanted
    gay-colored gowns until he made you see that grays and mauves were better
    taste.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind my peccadilloes,&rdquo; said Ruth, lightly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
    talk of something less personal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about the weather,&rdquo; suggested Fibsy, who was
    not conducting himself on the seen and not heard plan. &ldquo;The park is
    fine now. All full o&rsquo; red an&rsquo; gold autumn leaves. Have you noticed
    it, Mrs. Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not especially,&rdquo; and Ruth smiled at him, in appreciation of
    his conversational help. &ldquo;I must walk over there to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rsquo;m. An&rsquo; why don&rsquo;t you go for a long motor;
    ride up Westchester way? The scenery&rsquo;s great!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know, have you been there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not just lately, but I was last fall. Do you remember the big trees
    just at the turn of the road by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Ruth was not listening to the child. Stone had said something that claimed
    her attention.</p>
  <p>However, Fibsy was unabashed. With no trace of forwardness, but with due
    belief in his security of position as a guest, he continued to chatter to
    Ruth, and rarely addressed any one else.</p>
  <p>He has something up his sleeve, I thought, for I was beginning to have great
    faith in the lad&rsquo;s cleverness.</p>
  <p>He sat at Ruth&rsquo;s left hand, Stone being in the seat of the honor guest,
    and as that left me between the two sisters, I was doomed to participate
    in their chatter. But I was opposite my hostess and could enjoy looking at
    her in the intervals of conversation.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, I chanced to look up and I saw Fibsy&rsquo;s comical little face
    drawn with grimaces as he sang a snatch of a popular song.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart goes twirly-whirly &nbsp;&nbsp;When I see my pearlie
    girlie, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, what is that next line? With her&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With her ring-around-a-rosy curls!&rdquo; supplemented Ruth, her
    own face breaking into laughter, as, caught by the infection of Fibsy&rsquo;s
    waggish gayety, she rounded out the phrase.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Fibsy, eagerly, &ldquo;and</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her teeth like little shining pearls, &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, she&rsquo;s
    my queen of all the girls, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My little twirly-whirly, pearlie
    Girlie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ruth and Fibsy finished the silly little song in concert, and Stone clapped
    his hands in applause.</p>
  <p>Rhoda sniffed and Sarah acidly remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can you, Ruth? I wish you&rsquo;d be a little more dignified.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Quickly the light went out of Ruth&rsquo;s eyes. She looked reproved, and
    though she didn&rsquo;t resent it, a patient sadness came into her eyes,
    and I resolved that I would do all I could to get it arranged that she should
    live apart from the two carping, criticizing sisters.</p>
  <p>After dinner we had coffee in the library. Again, Fleming Stone took it
    upon himself to entertain the Misses Schuyler, and I drifted toward Ruth.
    She sat down on a sofa and motioned Fibsy to sit beside her. I drew a chair
    up to them and thanked a kind fate that let us all leave the table at once,
    dispensing with a more formal tarrying of the men.</p>
  <p>After the coffee there were liqueurs. I glanced at Fibsy to see if he accepted
    a tiny glass from the butler&rsquo;s tray.</p>
  <p>He did, and, moreover, he examined the contents with the air of a connoisseur.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oo de vee de Dantzic,&rdquo; he remarked, holding up his glass and
    gazing at the gold flecks in it.</p>
  <p>We all smiled at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your favorite cordial, Terence?&rdquo; asked Stone, affably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yessir. Don&rsquo;t you love it, Mrs. Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, and then, &ldquo;why, no, I don&rsquo;t love
    it, child. But one gets accustomed to something of the sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you like it better than Cream de mint or Benediction?&rdquo; he
    persisted.</p>
  <p>Ruth laughed outright. &ldquo;How do you know those names, you funny boy,&rdquo; she
    said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read &lsquo;em on the big signboards,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;They
    have the biggest billboards in New York for one of these lickures. I forget
    which one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These are what I like,&rdquo; said Ruth, smiling, as the footman
    passed a small bowl of sugared rose-leaves and crisp green candied mint leaves. &ldquo;Take
    some, Terence. They&rsquo;re better for you than liqueurs. Help yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are good,&rdquo; and Fibsy obeyed her. &ldquo;They taste like
    goin&rsquo; into a florist&rsquo;s shop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So they do,&rdquo; agreed Ruth, herself taking a goodly portion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish,&rdquo; said Rhoda. &ldquo;I think these things are silly.
    Randolph would never allow them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Rhoda, there&rsquo;s no harm in a few candies,&rdquo; protested
    Ruth, and then she changed the subject quickly, for she evaded a passage
    at arms with the sisters whenever possible.</p>
  <p>The talk, however, soon drifted to the never forgotten subject of the murder.
    The sisters mulled over all they had heard or learned during the day and
    begged Stone to propound theories or make deductions therefrom.</p>
  <p>Stone obeyed, as that was what he was employed for.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think Miss Van Allen is masquerading as somebody else,&rdquo; he
    affirmed. &ldquo;I believe she is in some house not very far from this neighborhood,
    under the care of some friend and accompanied and looked after by her maid
    Julie. I believe she is in touch with all that goes on, not only from the
    newspapers but by means of some spy system or secret investigation. But the
    net is drawing round her. I cannot say just how, but I feel sure that we
    shall yet get her. It was a grievous mischance that I let her escape last
    night, but I shall have another chance at her, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then you&rsquo;ll arrest her,&rdquo; said Rhoda, with a snap
    of her thin lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dare say. Lowney tells me the finger prints on the little knife
    with which Mr. Schuyler was killed are clear and unmistakable, but we have
    not yet found out whose they are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And can you?&rdquo; said Ruth, anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If we find Miss Van Allen,&rdquo; said Stone, &ldquo;we can at least
    see if they are her&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Fibsy contemptuously, &ldquo;why did&rsquo;n&rsquo; youse
    tell me before that you had the claw prints? I kin get Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s
    all right, all right!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; said I, for Fibsy had lapsed into the careless speech
    that meant business.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Over to her house. Why, they&rsquo;re all over. I&rsquo;ve only gotto
    photygraph some brushes an&rsquo; things on her dressin&rsquo; table to get
    all the prints you want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; agreed Stone. &ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t
    give us what we want. Nobody doubts that Miss Van Allen held the knife that
    stabbed Mr. Schuyler, and to prove it would be a certain satisfaction. But
    what we want is the woman herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was then that I noticed Ruth&rsquo;s maid, Tibbetts, hovering in the
    hall outside the library door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may go home, Tibbetts,&rdquo; Ruth said to her, kindly. &ldquo;These
    gentlemen will stay late and I&rsquo;ll look after them myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tibbetts went away, and Ruth said, explanatorily, &ldquo;My maid is a treasure.
    I&rsquo;d like to have her live here, but she is devoted to her own little
    roof tree and I let her off whenever possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I knew Tibbets had a home over on Second or Third Avenue, and I thought
    it kind of Ruth to indulge her in this. But after a change of domicile herself
    perhaps Ruth would arrange differently for her maid. And, too, as Winnie
    had often told me of Ruth&rsquo;s cleverness and efficiency in looking after
    herself and her belongings, I well knew she could get along without a maid
    whenever necessary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever trace that picture in Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s watch?&rdquo; Ruth
    asked, a few moments later.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It was just as we supposed. A little vaudeville
    actress whom Mr. Schuyler had taken out to supper gave it to him, and he
    stuck it in his watch case, temporarily. Her name is Dotty Fay and she seemed
    to know little about Mr. Schuyler and cared less. Merely the toy of an evening,
    she was to him, and merely a chance that the picture was in his watch the
    night of his visit to Vicky Van&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We had come to discuss the personal matters of Randolph Schuyler thus freely,
    for we were all at one in our search for the truth, and there were no secrets
    or evasions among us.</p>
  <p>Ruth sighed, but I knew her dear face so well now that I realized it was
    not from personal sorrow, but a general regret that a man of Schuyler&rsquo;s
    ability and power should have been such a weakling, morally. I knew she had
    never loved her husband, but she had been a faithful and dutiful wife, and
    no word or hint of blame had ever escaped her lips regarding him. She had
    been a martyr, but I hadn&rsquo;t learned this from her. The sisters, though
    unconsciously, told me much of the deprivation and narrowness of Ruth&rsquo;s
    life. Schuyler had ruled her with a rod of iron, and she had never rebelled,
    though at times her patience was nearly worn out.</p>
  <p>Later in the evening Fibsy asked for some phonograph music, expressing his
    great delight in hearing a really fine instrument and good records.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I doubt if you&rsquo;ll care for our selections,&rdquo; Ruth remarked,
    as she looked over the cabinet of records. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re almost all
    classical or old-fashioned songs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I like the classical kind,&rdquo; Fibsy said, endeavoring to be agreeable. &ldquo;Please
    play the gayest you have, though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But there were few &ldquo;gay&rdquo; ones in the collection. Wagner&rsquo;s
    operas and Beethoven&rsquo;s solemn marches gave forth their noble numbers
    and Fibsy sat, politely listening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No ragtime, I s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo; he said, after a particularly
    depressing fugue resounded its last echoes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Ruth glanced at him. &ldquo;Mr. Schuyler didn&rsquo;t
    care for rag time&mdash;on the phonograph,&rdquo; she added, perhaps remembering
    Dotty Fay.</p>
  <p>We stayed late. Several times Stone proposed our departure, but Ruth urged
    us to remain longer or began some subject of interest that held us in spite
    of ourselves. I had never seen her so entertaining. Indeed, I had never before
    seen her in what might be called a society setting. She was a charming hostess,
    and the occasion seemed to please her, for there was a pink flush on her
    cheeks and an added brightness to her gray eyes that convinced me anew of
    the joy she could take in simple pleasures.</p>
  <p>She singled out Fibsy for her especial attentions, and the boy accepted
    the honor with a gentle grace that astounded me. When talking to her he lost
    entirely his slang and uncouth diction and behaved as to the manner born.
    He was chameleonic, I could see, and he unconsciously took color from his
    surroundings.</p>
  <p>And sometimes I caught him gazing at Ruth with a strange expression that
    mingled amazement and sadness, and I couldn&rsquo;t understand it at all.</p>
  <p>Again, I would find Ruth&rsquo;s eyes fixed on me with a beseeching glance
    that might mean anything or nothing.</p>
  <p>As a whole the atmosphere seemed surcharged with a nameless excitement,
    almost a terror, as if something dire were impending. Once or twice I saw
    Stone and Terence exchange startled glances, but they rarely looked at each
    other.</p>
  <p>There was something brewing, of that I was sure. But whatever it was it
    did not affect the Schuyler sisters. They were eager to talk, anxious to
    hear, but they felt nothing of the undercurrent of mysterious meaning that
    affected the rest of us.</p>
  <p>I was glad when the time came to go. It was very late, nearly midnight,
    and I marveled to see that Ruth showed no sign of weariness. The sisters
    had been frankly yawning for some time, but Ruth&rsquo;s eyes were unnaturally
    bright, and her pale cheeks showed a tiny red spot on either side.</p>
  <p>She shook hands nervously and her voice trembled as she said good-night.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone and the boy were moved, I could see that, but they made their
    adieux without reference to future meeting or further work on the mystery.</p>
  <p>We went away, and as we turned the corner, I started to cross the street
    to go to my home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come into the Van Allen house a few minutes, Calhoun,&rdquo; said
    Stone, gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We went in at Vicky Van&rsquo;s. Stone&rsquo;s manner was ominous. He and
    Fibsy both were silent and grave-looking.</p>
  <p>We went in at the street door, into the hall and then to the living-room.</p>
  <p>Stone and I sat down, and Fibsy darted out to the dining-room, back to the
    hall and up the stairs, flashing on lights as he went.</p>
  <p>In silence Stone lighted a cigar and offered me one, which I took, feeling
    a strange notion that the end of the world was about to come.</p>
  <p>In another moment Fibsy came slowly down stairs, walked into the living-room,
    where we were, gave one look at Stone, and then threw himself on a divan,
    buried his face in the cushions and burst into tears. His thin little frame
    shook with sobs, great, deep, heart-rending, nerve-racking sobs, that made
    my own heart stand still with fear.</p>
  <p>What could it all mean? What ailed the boy?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, Stone,&rdquo; I begged, &ldquo;what is it? What has upset
    him so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has found Vicky Van,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone. &ldquo;And it
    has broken his heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Don&rsquo;t keep me in this suspense! Where is
    Vicky? Upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Stone, &ldquo;not now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Explain, please,&rdquo; I said, beginning to get angry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Fibsy, &ldquo;no, Mr. Stone, let me t-t-tell. W-wait
    a minute, I&rsquo;ll tell. Oh,&nbsp;<em>oh</em>, I knew it all day, b-b-but
    I couldn&rsquo;t believe it! I&nbsp;<em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;believe
    it! Why, Mr. Calhoun, Vicky Van is&mdash;is&mdash;why, Mrs. Schuyler is Vicky
    Van!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter19ProofsAndMoreProofs"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  Proofs And
    More Proofs</strong></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;You are absolutely crazy!&rdquo; I said, laughing, though the laugh
    choked in my throat, as I looked at Stone. &ldquo;You see, Fibsy, you&rsquo;re
    gone dotty over this thing, and you&rsquo;re running round in circles. I
    know both Mrs. Schuyler and Miss Van Allen, and they&rsquo;ve nothing in
    common. There couldn&rsquo;t be two people more dissimilar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it&mdash;that&rsquo;s how I know,&rdquo; wailed
    the boy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I first caught on. You see&mdash;oh, tell
    him, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The boy is right,&rdquo; said Stone, slowly. &ldquo;And the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t be right! It&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; I fairly shouted,
    as thoughts came flashing into my mind&mdash;dreadful thoughts, appalling
    thoughts!</p>
  <p>Ruth Schuyler and Vicky Van one person! Why, then, Ruth killed&mdash;No!
    a thousand times NO! It couldn&rsquo;t be true! The boy was insane, and Stone
    was, too. I&rsquo;d show them their own foolishness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop a minute, Stone,&rdquo; I said, trying to speak calmly. &ldquo;You
    and the boy never knew Vicky Van. You never saw her, except as she ran along
    the street for a few steps at midnight. And Terence didn&rsquo;t see her
    then. It&rsquo;s too absurd, this theory of yours! But it startled me, when
    you sprung it. Now, Fibsy, stop your sobbing and tell me what makes you think
    this foolish thing, and I&rsquo;ll relieve your mind of any such ideas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; and Fibsy mopped his
    eyes with his wet handkerchief. He was a strange little figure, in his new
    clothes, but with his red hair tumbled and his eyes big and swollen with
    weeping. &ldquo;I know you can&rsquo;t believe it, but you listen a bit,
    while I tell Mr. Stone some things. Then you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Terence,&rdquo; said Stone; &ldquo;go ahead. What about the
    prints?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They prove up,&rdquo; and Fibsy&rsquo;s woe increased afresh. &ldquo;They
    ain&rsquo;t no shadder of doubt. The very reason I know they&rsquo;re the
    same is &lsquo;cause they&rsquo;re so unlike. Yes, I&rsquo;ll explain&mdash;wait
    a minute&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again a crying spell overwhelmed him, and we waited.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, regaining self-control, &ldquo;now I&rsquo;ve
    spilled all my tears I&rsquo;ll out with it. The first thing that struck
    me was the abserlute unlikeness of those two ladies. I mean in their tastes
    an&rsquo; ways. Why, fer instance, an&rsquo; I guess it was jest about the
    very first thing I noticed, was the magazines. In here, on Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s
    table, as you can see yourself, is&mdash;jest look at &lsquo;em! Vogue, Vanity
    Fair, Life, Cosmopolitan, an&rsquo; lots of light-weight story magazines.
    In at Schuylers&rsquo; house is Atlantic Monthly, Harper&rsquo;s, Century,
    The Forum, The North American Review, and a lot of other highbrow reading.
    An&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;that the magazines in here
    are gayer an&rsquo; lighter, an&rsquo; in there heavier an&rsquo; wiser;
    but there isn&rsquo;t a single duplicate! Now, Miss Vicky Van likes good
    readin&rsquo;, you can see from her books an&rsquo; all, so why don&rsquo;t
    she take Harper&rsquo;s an&rsquo; Century? &lsquo;Cause she has &lsquo;em
    in her other home&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, wait, child,&rdquo; I cried, getting bewildered; &ldquo;you
    don&rsquo;t mean Vicky Van lives sometimes in this house and sometimes in
    the Schuyler house as its mistress!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s jest what I do mean. I know it sounds like I was batty,
    but let me tell more. Well, it seemed queer that there shouldn&rsquo;t be
    any one magazine took in both houses, but, of course, that wasn&rsquo;t no
    real proof. I only noticed it, an&rsquo; it set me a thinkin&rsquo;. Then
    I sized up their situations. Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s dignified an&rsquo; quiet
    in her ways, simple in her dress, wears only poils, no other sparklers whatever.
    Vicky Van&rsquo;s gay of action, likes giddy rags, and adores gorgeous jewelry,
    even if it ain&rsquo;t the most realest kind. Now, wait&mdash;don&rsquo;t
    interrup&rsquo; me, Lemme talk it out. &lsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s killin&rsquo; me,
    an&rsquo; I gotter get it over with. Well, all Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s things&mdash;furnicher,
    I mean&mdash;is big an&rsquo; heavy an&rsquo; massive, an&rsquo; terrible
    expensive. Yes, I know her husband made her have it that way. But never mind
    that. Vicky Van&rsquo;s furnicher is all gay an&rsquo; light an&rsquo; pretty
    an&rsquo; dainty colorin&rsquo; and so forth. And the day the old sister-in-laws
    was in here they said, &lsquo;How Ruth would admire to have things like these! &lsquo;Member
    how she begged Randolph to do up her boodore in wicker an&rsquo; pink silk?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s
    what they said! Oh, well, I got a bug then that the two ladies I&rsquo;m
    talkin&rsquo; about was just the very oppositest I ever did see! Then, another
    thing was the records. The phonygraft in here is full of light opery and
    poplar music like that. Not a smell o&rsquo; fugues and classic stuff. An&rsquo; in
    at Schuyler&rsquo;s, as we seen to-night, there&rsquo;s no gay songs, no
    comic operas, no ragtime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Terence,&rdquo; I broke in, &ldquo;that all proves nothing!
    The Schuylers don&rsquo;t care for ragtime and Vicky Van does. You mustn&rsquo;t
    distort those plain facts to fit your absurd theory!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, his eyes burning as they glared into mine. &ldquo;An&rsquo; Mr.
    Schuyler he wouldn&rsquo;t never let his wife go to the light operas or vodyville,
    an&rsquo; she hadn&rsquo;t any records, so how&mdash;<em>how</em>, I ask
    you, comes it that she&rsquo;s so familiar with the song about &lsquo;My
    Pearlie Girlie&rsquo; that she joined in the singin&rsquo; of it with me
    at the dinner table to-night? That&rsquo;s what clinched it. Mrs. Schuyler,
    she knew that song&rsquo;s well as I did, and she picked it up where I left
    off and hummed it straight to the end&mdash;words&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;music!
    How&rsquo;d she know it, I say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, she might have picked that up anywhere. She goes to see friends,
    I&rsquo;ve no doubt, who are not so straight-laced as the Schuylers, and
    they play light tunes for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not likely. I&rsquo;ve run down her friends, and they&rsquo;re all
    old fogies like the sister dames or like old man Schuyler himself. The old
    ladies are nearly sixty and Mr. Schuyler was fifty odd, and all their friends
    are along about those ages, and Mrs. Schuyler, she ain&rsquo;t got any friends
    of her own age at all. But, as Vicky Van, she has friends of her own age,
    yes, an&rsquo; her own tastes, an&rsquo; her own ways of life an&rsquo; livin.&rsquo; An&rsquo; she&rsquo;s
    got the record of &lsquo;My Pearlie Girlie.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, Calhoun,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone. &ldquo;I know
    it&rsquo;s all incredible, but it&rsquo;s true. I couldn&rsquo;t believe
    it, myself, when Fibsy hinted it to me&mdash;for it&rsquo;s his find&mdash;to
    him belongs all the credit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Credit!&rdquo; I groaned. &ldquo;Credit for fastening this lie, this
    base lie&mdash;oh, you are well named Fibsy!&mdash;on the best and loveliest
    woman that ever lived! For it is a lie! Not a word of truth in it. A distorted
    notion of a crazy brain! A&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold on, Calhoun,&rdquo; remonstrated Stone, and I dare say I was
    acting like a madman. &ldquo;Listen to the rest of this more quietly or take
    your hat and go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone spoke firmly, but not angrily, and I sat still.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, here&rsquo;s some more things,&rdquo; Fibsy continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    gone over this house with a eye that sees more&rsquo;n Mr. Stone&rsquo;s
    lens, an&rsquo; it don&rsquo;t magnerfy, neither. I spotted a lot of stuff
    in the pantry and storeroom. It&rsquo;s all stuff that keeps, you know; little
    jugs an&rsquo; pots of fine eatin&rsquo;&mdash;imported table delicacies&mdash;that&rsquo;s
    what they call &lsquo;em. Well, an&rsquo; among &lsquo;em was lickures an&rsquo; things
    like that. And boxes of candied rose leaves an&rsquo; salted nuts&mdash;oh,
    all them things. An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s why I wanted to go to dinner at Mrs.
    Schuyler&rsquo;s an&rsquo; see if she liked to eat those things. An&rsquo; she
    did! She had the rose leaves an&rsquo; she had the kind o&rsquo; lickure
    that&rsquo;s down in the pantry cupboard in this house. An&rsquo; she said
    it was her fav&rsquo;rite, an&rsquo; the old girls said she never used to
    have those things when her husband was runnin&rsquo; the house&mdash;an&rsquo; oh,
    dear, can&rsquo;t you see it all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I see it,&rdquo; said Stone, but I still shook my head doggedly
    and angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it!&rdquo; I declared. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing
    to all this but a pipe dream! Why shouldn&rsquo;t two women like&nbsp;<em>Eau
    de vie de Dantzic</em>&nbsp;as a liqueur? It&rsquo;s very fashionable&mdash;a
    sort of fad, just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t only this thing or that thing, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; said
    Fibsy, earnestly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the pilin&rsquo; up of all &lsquo;em.
    An&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t through yet. Here&rsquo;s another point. Miss Van
    Allen, she ain&rsquo;t got any pitchers of nature views&mdash;no landscapes
    nor woodsy dells in this whole house. She jest likes pitchers of people&mdash;pretty
    girls, an&rsquo; old cavalier gentlemen, an nymps, an&rsquo; kiddy babies&mdash;but
    all human, you know. Now, Mrs. Schuyler,&nbsp;<em>she</em>&nbsp;don&rsquo;t
    care anythin&rsquo; special for nature, neither. I piped up about the beauty
    scenery out Westchester way an&rsquo; over in the park, an&rsquo; it left
    her cold an&rsquo; onintrusted. But she has portfolios of world masterpieces,
    or whatever you call &lsquo;em, over to that house, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;re
    all figger pieces.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And her writing desk,&rdquo; prompted Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yessir, that checked up, too. You know, Mr. Calhoun, they ain&rsquo;t
    nothin&rsquo; more intim&rsquo;tly pers&rsquo;nal than a writin&rsquo; desk.
    Well, Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s has a certain make of pen, an&rsquo; a certain
    number and kind of pencils. An&rsquo; Mrs. Schuyler, she uses the same identical
    styles an&rsquo; numbers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And notepaper, I suppose,&rdquo; I flung back, sarcastically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir, but that helps prove. The note paper in the two houses is
    teetumteetotally different! That was planned to be different! Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s
    is a pale gray, plain paper. Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s is light pink, to match
    her boodore, I s&rsquo;pose. An&rsquo; it has that sort of indented frame
    round it, that&rsquo;s extry fashionable, an&rsquo; a wiggly gold monogram,
    oh&mdash;quite a big one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I well remembered Vicky&rsquo;s stationery, and the boy described it exactly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Proves nothing!&rdquo; I said, contemptuously, but I listened further.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Fibsy said, wearily pushing back his shock of red
    hair. &ldquo;Well, then, how&rsquo;s this? On Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s desk
    the pen wiper is a fancy little contraption, but it&rsquo;s clean-I mean
    it&rsquo;s never had a pen wiped on it. Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s desk hasn&rsquo;t
    got any pen wiper. On each desk is a pencil sharpener, of the same sort.
    On each desk is a little pincushion, with the same size of tiny pins, like
    she was in the habit of pinnin&rsquo; bills together or sumpum like that.
    On each desk the blotter is in the same place and is used the same way. There&rsquo;s
    a lot of pussonality &lsquo;bout the way folks use a blotter. Some uses both
    sides, some only one side. Some has their blotters all torn an&rsquo; sorta
    nibbled round the edges, an&rsquo; some has &lsquo;em neat and trim. Well,
    the blotters on these two desks is jest alike&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Fibsy,&rdquo; I cried in triumph, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the
    handwriting of these two ladies, over and over again, and they&rsquo;re not
    a bit alike!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; and Fibsy nodded. &ldquo;But, Mr. Calhoun, did
    you know that Miss Van Allen always writes with her left hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, and I don&rsquo;t believe she does!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yessir. I went to the bank an&rsquo; they said so. An&rsquo; I asked
    the sewin&rsquo; woman, an&rsquo; she said so. An&rsquo; I asked the caterer
    people an&rsquo; they said so. And the inkstand is on the left-hand side
    of Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s desk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, then she is left-handed, but that proves nothing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir, Miss Van Allen ain&rsquo;t left-handed. You know she ain&rsquo;t
    yourself. You&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; noticed it if she had been. But she
    writes left-handed, &lsquo;cause if she didn&rsquo;t she&rsquo;d write like
    Mrs. Schuyler!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, rubbish!&rdquo; I began, but Fleming Stone interrupted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait, Calhoun, don&rsquo;t fly to pieces. All Terence is saying is
    quite true. I vouch for it. Listen further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t no use goin&rsquo; further,&rdquo; said Fibsy, despondently. &ldquo;Mr.
    Calhoun knows I&rsquo;m right, only he can&rsquo;t bring himself to believe
    it, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t blame him. Why, even now, he&rsquo;s sizin&rsquo; up
    the case an&rsquo; everything he thinks of proves it an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; disproves
    it. But anyway, the prints prove it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prints?&rdquo; I said, half dazedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yessir. I photographed a lot o&rsquo; finger prints in both houses,
    an&rsquo; the Headquarters people fixed &lsquo;em up for me, magnerfied &lsquo;em,
    you know, an&rsquo; printed &lsquo;em on little cards, an&rsquo; as you can
    see, they&rsquo;re all the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I glanced at the sheaf of cards the boy had and Fleming Stone took them
    to scrutinize.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got those prints from all sorts of places,&rdquo; Fibsy went on. &ldquo;Off
    of the glass bottles and things in the bathrooms and off of the hair brushes
    and such things, an&rsquo; off of the envelopes of letters, an&rsquo; off
    the chairbacks an&rsquo; any polished wood surfaces, an&rsquo; I got lots
    of &lsquo;em in both houses, an&rsquo; the police people picked out the best
    an&rsquo; cleanest an&rsquo; fixed &lsquo;em up, an&rsquo; there you are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They seemed to think this settled the matter. But I would not be convinced.
    Of course, I&rsquo;d been told dozens of times that no two people in the
    world have finger prints alike, but that didn&rsquo;t mean a thing to me.
    It might be, I told them, that Vicky Van and Ruth Schuyler were friends,
    that Ruth had withheld this fact, and that&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Stone, &ldquo;not friends, but identical&mdash;the
    same woman. And, listen to this. Mrs. Schuyler heard us say this evening
    that Fibsy could photograph the brushes and such things over here to get
    Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s finger prints, and what does she do? She sends Tibbetts
    over to scrub and wipe off those same brushes, also the mirrors, chairbacks
    and all such possible evidence. A hopeless task&mdash;for the woman couldn&rsquo;t
    eradicate all the prints in the house. And, also, it was too late, for Fibsy
    had already done his camera work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know she did all that?&rdquo; and I glowered at the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because Fibsy just told me he found evidences of this cleaning up,
    and, too, because Mrs. Schuyler purposely kept us over there longer than
    we intended to stay. You know how, when we proposed to say good-night, she
    urged us to stay longer. That was to give her maid more time for the work.
    Now, Mr. Calhoun, go on with your objections to our conclusions. It helps
    our theory to answer your refutations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her letters,&rdquo; I mumbled, scarce able to formulate my teeming
    thoughts. &ldquo;Vicky Van sent a letter to Ruth Schuyler&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, she did. Wrote it herself, with her left hand, and mailed
    it to her other personality, in order to make the police give up the search.
    And, too, the letter from Miss Van Allen, found in Randolph Schuyler&rsquo;s
    desk after his death, was written and placed there by Mrs. Schuyler for us
    to find.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t allow these libels.
    You&rsquo;ll be saying next that Ruth Schuyler killed her husband!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She did,&rdquo; asserted Fleming Stone, gravely. &ldquo;She did kill
    him, in her character as Vicky Van. Don&rsquo;t you see it all? Schuyler
    came here as Somers, never dreaming that Vicky Van was his own wife in disguise.
    Or, he may have suspected it, and may have come to verify his suspicion.
    Any way, when she saw and recognized him, whether he knew her or not, she
    lured him out to the dining room and stabbed him with the caterer&rsquo;s
    knife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; I said. I was not ranting now, I was stunned by the
    revelations that were coming so thick and fast. I couldn&rsquo;t believe
    and yet I couldn&rsquo;t doubt. Of one thing I was certain, I would defend
    Ruth Schuyler to the end of time. I would defend her against Vicky Van&mdash;why,
    if Ruth was Vicky Van&mdash;where was this moil to end! I couldn&rsquo;t
    think coherently. But I suddenly realized that what they told me was true.
    I realized that all along there were things about Ruth that had reminded
    me of Vicky. I had never put this into words, never had really sensed it,
    but I saw now, looking back, that they had much in common.</p>
  <p>Appearance! Ah, I hadn&rsquo;t yet thought of that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;the two are not in the least alike,
    physically!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Van Allen wore a black wig,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;A most
    cleverly constructed one, and she rouged her cheeks, penciled her eyelashes
    and reddened her lips to produce the high coloring that marked her from Mrs.
    Schuyler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I thought this over, dully. Yes, they were the same height and weight, they
    had the same slight figure, but it had never occurred to me to compare their
    physical effects. I was a bit near-sighted and I had never taken enough real
    personal interest in Vicky to learn to love her features as I had Ruth&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Fleming Stone was saying, though I scarce listened, &ldquo;you
    are the only person that I have been able to find who knows both Miss Van
    Allen and Mrs. Schuyler. No one else has testified who knows them both. So
    much depends on you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get nothing from me!&rdquo; I fairly shouted. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
    not the same woman at all. You&rsquo;re all wrong, you and your lying boy
    there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your vehemence stultifies your own words,&rdquo; said Stone, quietly; &ldquo;it
    proves your own realization of the truth and your anger and fury at that
    realization. I don&rsquo;t blame you. I know your regard for Mrs. Schuyler,
    I know you have always been a friend of Miss Van Allen. It is not strange
    that one woman attracts you, since the other did. But you&rsquo;ve got to
    face this thing, so be a man and look at it squarely. I&rsquo;ll help you
    all I can, but I assure you there&rsquo;s nothing to be gained by denial
    of the self-evident truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, man,&rdquo; I said, trying to be calm, &ldquo;the whole thing
    is impossible! How could Mrs. Randolph Schuyler, a well-known society lady,
    live a double life and enact Miss Van Allen, a gay butterfly girl? How could
    she get from one house to the other unobserved? Why wouldn&rsquo;t her servants
    know of it, even if her family didn&rsquo;t? How could she hoodwink her husband,
    her sisters-in-law, and her friends? Why didn&rsquo;t people see her leaving
    one house and entering the other? Why wasn&rsquo;t she missed from one house
    when she was in the other?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All answerable questions,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;You know Miss
    Van Allen went away frequently on long trips, and was in and out of her home
    all the time. Here to-day and gone to-morrow, as every one testifies who
    knew her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was true enough. Vicky was never at home more than a few days at a
    time and then absent for a week or so. Where? In the Fifth Avenue house as
    Ruth Schuyler? Incredible! Preposterous! But as I began to believe at last,
    true.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; I repeated; &ldquo;how could she manage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walls have tongues,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;These walls and this
    house tell me all the story. That is, they tell me this wonderful woman did
    accomplish this seemingly impossible thing. They tell me how she accomplished
    it. But they do not tell me why.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no question about the why,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;If
    Ruth Schuyler did live two lives it&rsquo;s easily understood why. Because
    that brute of a man allowed her no gayety, no pleasure, no fun of any sort
    compatible with her youth and tastes. He let her do nothing, have nothing,
    save in the old, humdrum ways that appealed to his notion of propriety. But
    he himself was no Puritan! He ran his own gait, and, unknown to his wife
    and sisters, he was a roue and a rounder! Whatever Ruth Schuyler may have
    done, she was amply justified&mdash;-&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even in killing him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t kill him! Look here, Mr. Stone, even if all you&rsquo;ve
    said is true, you haven&rsquo;t convicted her of murder yet. And you shan&rsquo;t!
    I&rsquo;ll protect that woman from the breath of scandal or slander&mdash;and
    that&rsquo;s what it is when you accuse her of killing that man! She never
    did it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen,&rdquo; and Fleming Stone&rsquo;s deep gray
    eyes showed a sad apprehension. &ldquo;But nothing can be done to-night.
    Can there, Terence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Stone, not to-night. No, by no means, not to-night! It wouldn&rsquo;t
    do!&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s earnestness seemed to me out of all proportion
    to his simple statement, but I could stand no more and I went home, to spend
    the night in a dazed wonder, a furious disbelief, and finally an enforced
    conviction that Vicky Van and Ruth Schuyler were one and the same.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter20TheTruthFromRuth"></a>Chapter 20<br>
  The Truth From
    Ruth</strong></h2>
  <p>Next morning I was conscious of but one desire, to get to Ruth and tell
    her of my love and faith in her, and assure her of my protection and assistance
    whatever happened.</p>
  <p>Whatever happened! The thought struck me like a knell. What could happen
    but her arrest and trial?</p>
  <p>But as I went out of my own door&mdash;I left the house early, for I couldn&rsquo;t
    face Aunt Lucy and Winnie&mdash;I suddenly decided it would be better to
    see Stone first and learn if anything had transpired since I left him.</p>
  <p>I rang the bell at Vicky Van&rsquo;s house with a terrible feeling of impending
    disaster, that might be worse than any yet known.</p>
  <p>Fibsy let me in. I wanted to hate that boy and yet his very evident adoration
    of Ruth Schuyler made me love him. I knew all that he had discovered had
    been as iron entering his soul, but his duty led him on and he dared not
    pause or falter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We may as well tell him,&rdquo; he said to Stone, and the detective
    nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But come downstairs with us and have a cup of coffee first,&rdquo; Stone
    said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll need it, as you say you&rsquo;ve had no breakfast.
    Fibsy makes first-rate coffee, and I can tell you, Calhoun, you&rsquo;ve
    a hard day before you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you learned anything further?&rdquo; I managed to stammer out
    as we went down to the basement room that they used as a dining-room now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; as I told you, walls have tongues, and the walls have given
    up the secret of how Mrs. Schuyler managed her two-sided existence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But he would not tell me the secret until I had been fortified with two
    cups of steaming Mocha, which fully justified his praise of Fibsy&rsquo;s
    culinary prowess.</p>
  <p>Fibsy himself said nothing beyond a brief &ldquo;good morning,&rdquo; and
    the lad&rsquo;s eyes were red and his voice shook as he spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; Stone said, as we finished breakfast, &ldquo;that
    there must be some means, some secret means of communication between the
    two houses, the Schuyler house and this. You see, the Schuyler house, fronting
    on Fifth Avenue, three doors from the corner, runs back a hundred feet, and
    abuts on the rear rooms of this house, which runs back from the side street.
    In a word, the two houses form a right angle, and the back wall of the Schuyler
    house is directly against the side wall of the rear rooms of this house.
    Therefore, I felt sure there must be an entrance from one house to the other,
    not perceivable to an observer. And, of course, it must be in Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s
    own rooms; it couldn&rsquo;t be in their dining-room or halls. A few questions
    made me realize that Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s boudoir was separated from Mrs.
    Schuyler&rsquo;s bath room by only the partition wall of the houses. And
    I said that wall must speak to me. And it did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We were now on our way upstairs, Stone ready at last to let me into the
    secret he had discovered.</p>
  <p>We went to Vicky&rsquo;s boudoir, and he continued: &ldquo;You know you
    found the strand of gilt beads caught in this mirror frame. We all assumed
    Miss Van Allen had flirted it there as she dressed for her party, but I reasoned
    that it might have caught there as she escaped to the Schuyler house the
    night of the murder. Yes, she did escape this way&mdash;look.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone touched a hidden spring and the mirror in the Florentine frame slid
    silently aside into the wall, leaving an aperture that without doubt led
    into the next house. The frame remained stationary, but the mirror slid away
    as a sliding door works, and so smoothly that there was absolutely no sound
    or jar.</p>
  <p>I saw what was like a small closet, about two feet deep and perhaps three
    feet wide. At the back of it, that is, against the walls of the adjoining
    room in the other house, we could see the shape of a similar door, and the
    secret was out. There was no need to open that other door to know that it
    led to Ruth Schuyler&rsquo;s rooms. There was yet more telltale evidence.
    In the little cupboard between the houses was a small safe. This Stone had
    opened and in it was the black wig of Vicky Van and also a brown wig which
    I recognized at once as Julie&rsquo;s well-remembered plainly parted front
    hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, Tibbetts is Julie,&rdquo; said Fibsy, in such a heart-broken
    and despairing voice that I felt the tears rush to my own eyes.</p>
  <p>Vicky&rsquo;s wig! The loops of sleek black hair, the soft loose knot behind,
    the delicate part, all just as it crowned her little head&mdash;Ruth&rsquo;s
    head! Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t stand it! It was too fearful!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This other door,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;opens into Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s
    bathroom. That I know. You see, she had to have this entrance from some room
    absolutely her own. Her bathroom was safe from interruption, and when she
    chose she slipped through from one house to the other and back at will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; I insisted, shaking my head. &ldquo;If
    she came in here as Ruth Schuyler why wasn&rsquo;t she seen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because, before she was seen, she had made herself over into Victoria
    Van Allen. She had donned wig and make-up, safe from interruption, here in
    her boudoir. This make-up she removed before returning to the Schuyler house
    in her role of Mrs. Schuyler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is too unbelievable!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; it is diabolically clever, but quite understandable. Julie and
    Tibbetts are the same. This confidential woman looked after her mistress&rsquo; safety
    on both sides. She remained when Vicky Van disappeared. She looked after
    everything, took care of details, attended to tradesmen and all such matters,
    and when ready followed Mrs. Schuyler into the other house, or went from
    here to her rooms a few blocks away and later came from them. When there
    were to be parties, Julie left the Schuyler house early, came here and made
    preparations, and then as late as ten or eleven o&rsquo;clock maybe, Mrs.
    Schuyler came in from her home, when her own household thought her abed and
    asleep. She could go back in the early morning hours, with no one the wiser.
    Or, if she chose and she did when her husband was out of town, she could
    pretend she had gone away for a visit and stay here for days at a time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I began to see. Truly the wall&rsquo;s tongue had spoken. If this awful
    theory of Stone&rsquo;s were true, it could only be managed in this way.
    I remembered how long and how often Vicky Van was absent from her home. I
    remembered that sometimes she was late in arriving at her own parties, although
    she always came down from upstairs in her party regalia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did you come to suspect Tibbetts?&rdquo; I asked, suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her teeth,&rdquo; said Fibsy. &ldquo;I saw that Tibbetts had false
    teeth, anyway, an&rsquo; I says, why can&rsquo;t Julie&rsquo;s gold teeth
    be false, too? And they are. They&rsquo;re in the safe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What marvelous precautions they had taken! To think of having a set of teeth
    for the maid Julie that should appear so different from those of Tibbetts!
    Surely this thing was the result of long and careful planning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her glasses, too,&rdquo; went on Fibsy. &ldquo;You see, they made
    her different from Tibbetts in appearance. That was all the disguise Tibbs
    had, the gold teeth, the big rimmed specs and the brown scratch&mdash;wig,
    you know. But it was enough. Nobody notices a servant closely, and these
    things altered her looks sufficient. Miss Van Allen, now, she had a wig an&rsquo; a
    lot of colorin&rsquo; matter an&rsquo; her giddy clothes. Nothin&rsquo; left
    to reckernize but her eyes, an&rsquo; they were so darkened by the long dark
    lashes and brows that she fixed up that it made her eyes seem darker. I got
    all this from the pitchers the artist lady made. You see, she caught the
    color likeness but not the actual features. So I sized up the resemblance
    of the real women. Oh, Mr. Stone, what are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our duty, Terence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then I put forth my plea, that I might be allowed to go and see Ruth first;
    that I might prepare her for the disclosures they would make, the discoveries
    they would announce.</p>
  <p>But Stone denied me. He said they would do or say nothing that would unnecessarily
    hurt her feelings, but they must accompany me. Indeed, he implied, that it
    might be as well for me not to go.</p>
  <p>But I insisted on going, and we three went on our terrible errand.</p>
  <p>Ruth received us in the library. She saw at once that her secret was known,
    and she took it calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said, quietly, to Stone. &ldquo;I am sorry.
    I hoped to hide my secret and let Victoria Van Allen forever remain a mystery.
    But it cannot be. I admit all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait, Ruth,&rdquo; I cried out. &ldquo;Admit nothing until you are
    accused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am accused,&rdquo; she responded, with a sad smile. &ldquo;I heard
    you talking in the passage between the rooms. In my bathroom I could hear
    you distinctly. There is there a mirror door also. It looks like an ordinary
    mirror and has a wide, flat nickel frame, matching the other fittings. Yes,
    I had the sliding doors built for the purposes which you have surmised. Shall
    I tell you my story?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and let us hear it, too,&rdquo; came from the doorway, and the
    two sisters appeared, agog with excitement and curiosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Ruth, quietly. &ldquo;Sit down, please, I want
    you to hear it. Most of it you know, Sarah and Rhoda, but I will tell it
    briefly to Mr. Stone, for I want not leniency, but justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I seated myself at Ruth&rsquo;s side, and though I said no word I knew that
    she understood that my heart and life were at her disposal and that whatever
    she might be about to tell would not shake my love and devotion. It is not
    necessary to use words when a life crisis occurs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was an orphan,&rdquo; Ruth said, &ldquo;brought up by a stern and
    Puritanical old aunt in New England. I had no joy or pleasures in my childhood
    or girlhood days. I ran away from home to become an actress. Tibbetts, my
    old nurse, who lived in the same village, followed me to keep an eye on me
    and protect me in need. I was a chorus girl for just one week when Randolph
    Schuyler discovered me and offered to marry me if I would renounce the stage
    and also gay life of any sort and become a dignified old-fashioned matron.
    I willingly accepted. I was only seventeen and knew nothing of the world
    or its ways. As soon as we were married he forbade me any sort of amusement
    or pleasure other than those practised by his elderly sisters. I submitted
    and lived a life of slavery to his whims and his cruelty for five years.
    He had agreed to let me have Tibbetts for my maid, as he deemed her a staid
    old woman who would not encourage me in wayward desires. Nor did she. But
    she realized my thraldom, my lonely, unhappy life, and knew that I was pining
    away for want of the simple innocent pleasures that my youth and light-hearted
    nature craved. I used to beg and plead for permission to have a few young
    friends or to be allowed to go to a few parties or plays. But Mr. Schuyler
    kept me as secluded as any woman in a harem. He gave me no liberty, no freedom
    in the slightest degree.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had been married about four years when I rebelled and began to
    think up a scheme of a dual existence. I had ample time in the long lonely
    hours to perfect my plans, and I had them arranged to the minutest detail
    long before I put them in operation. Why, I practised writing with my left
    hand and acquired a different speaking voice for a year before I needed such
    subterfuges. Had I been able to persuade my husband to give me even a little
    pleasure or happiness I would willingly have given up my wild scheme. But
    he wouldn&rsquo;t; so once when he was away on a long trip, I had the passage
    between the two houses made.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had previously bought the other house, under the name of Van Allen,
    for I had money of my own, left me by an uncle that Mr. Schuyler knew nothing
    about. Of course, this money came to me after I was married or I never should
    have wed Randolph Schuyler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tibbetts&rsquo; cousin, an expert carpenter, did the work, and, as
    he afterward went to England to live, I had no fear of discovery that way.
    Indeed, there was little fear of discovery in any way. I was expected to
    spend much of my time in my own rooms&mdash;and my bedroom, dressing room
    and bath form a little suite by themselves and can be locked off from the
    rest of the house. So, when I retired to my rooms for the night I could go
    through into the other house and become Vicky Van at my pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe such baseness!&rdquo; declared Rhoda Schuyler, &ldquo;such
    ingratitude to a husband who was so good to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t good to me,&rdquo; said Ruth, quietly, &ldquo;nor
    was I ungrateful. Randolph Schuyler spoiled my life; he denied me everything
    I asked for, every innocent pleasure and amusement. So, I found them for
    myself. I did nothing wrong. As Victoria Van Allen I had friends and pleasures
    that suited my age and my love of life, but there never was anything wrong
    or guilty in my house&mdash;-&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until you killed your husband!&rdquo; interrupted Sarah.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until the night of Randolph Schuyler&rsquo;s appearance at Vicky
    Van&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; Ruth went on. &ldquo;I had been told of a Mr. Somers
    who wanted to know me, but I had no idea it was my husband masquerading under
    a false name. He came there with Mr. Steele. Of course, I recognized him,
    but he did not know me at once. I sat, playing bridge, and wondering how
    I could best make my escape. I saw that he didn&rsquo;t know me and then,
    suddenly as I sat, holding my cards, and he stood beside me, he noticed a
    tiny scar on my shoulder. He made that scar himself, one night, when he hit
    me with a hot curling iron.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; I cried, unable to repress an exclamation of horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I was curling my hair with the tongs and he became angry at
    me for some trivial reason, as he often did, and he snatched up the iron
    and hit my shoulder. It made a deep burn and he was very sorry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whenever he saw it afterward he said, &lsquo;Never again!&rsquo; meaning
    he would never strike me again. Then, when he noticed the scar that night,
    although I had put on a light scarf to cover it, he said &lsquo;Never again!&rsquo; in
    that peculiar intonation, and I knew then that he knew Victoria Van Allen
    was his own wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ran out to the dining-room and he followed me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you stabbed him!&rdquo; cried Rhoda; &ldquo;stabbed your husband!
    Murderess!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny it,&rdquo; said Ruth, slowly. &ldquo;The jury
    must decide that. I must be tried, I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Ruth!&rdquo; I cried, in agony. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk
    like that! You shall not be tried! You didn&rsquo;t kill Schuyler! If you
    did it was in self-defence. Wasn&rsquo;t it? Didn&rsquo;t he try to kill
    you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he did. He snatched the little carver from the sideboard and
    attacked me,&mdash;and I&mdash;and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it, Ruth&mdash;keep still!&rdquo; I ordered, beside
    myself with my whirling thoughts. The little carving-knife!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you defended yourself with the caterer&rsquo;s knife&mdash;&rdquo; began
    Stone, but Fibsy wailed, &ldquo;No! No! It wasn&rsquo;t Mrs. Schuyler! I&rsquo;ve
    got the prints from the caterer&rsquo;s knife and they ain&rsquo;t Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s
    at all! She didn&rsquo;t kill him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and Tibbetts appeared in the library
    doorway. &ldquo;I did it myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; and Fibsy&rsquo;s eyes gleamed satisfaction; &ldquo;she
    did! It&rsquo;s her fingermarks on the knife that stabbed old Schuyler. They&rsquo;re
    plain as print! Nobody thought of matching up those marks with Tibbetts&rsquo;s
    mitt! But I&rsquo;ll bet she did it to save Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; and Tibbetts came into the room and stood facing us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell your story,&rdquo; said Stone, abruptly, as he looked at the
    white-faced woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; and Tibbetts looked fondly at Ruth as the latter&rsquo;s
    piteous glance met hers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve loved and watched over Mrs. Schuyler
    all her life. I&rsquo;ve protected her from her husband&rsquo;s brutality
    and helped her to bear his cruelty and unkindness. When she conceived the
    plan of the double life I helped her all I could, and I got my cousin to
    do the work on the houses that made it all possible. Then, I was Julie, and
    I devoted my life and energies to keeping the secret and allowing my mistress
    to have some pleasure out of her life. And she did.&rdquo; Tibbets looked
    affectionately, even proudly, at Ruth. &ldquo;The hours she spent in that
    house as Victoria Van Allen were full of simple joys and happy occupation.
    She had the books and pictures and furniture that she craved. She had things
    to eat and things to wear that she wanted. She went to parties and she had
    parties; she went to the theatre and to the shops, and wherever she chose,
    without let or hindrance. It did my heart good to see her enjoy herself in
    those innocent ways.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then Mr. Schuyler came. I knew the man. I knew that he came because
    he had heard of the charm and beauty of Vicky Van. He had no idea he would
    find her his own wife! When he did discover it I knew he would kill her.
    Oh, I knew Randolph Schuyler! I knew nothing short of murder would satisfy
    the rage that possessed him at the discovery. I prepared for it. I got the
    little boning-knife from the pantry, and as Mr. Schuyler lifted the carver
    and aimed it at Ruth&rsquo;s breast I drove the little knife into his vile,
    wicked, murderer&rsquo;s heart. And I&rsquo;m glad I did it! I glory in it!
    I saved Ruth&rsquo;s life and I rid the world of a scoundrel and a villain
    who had no right to live and breathe on God&rsquo;s earth! Now, you may take
    me and do with me as you will. I give myself up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was the truth. On the carving-knife appeared, plain as print, the finger
    marks of Randolph Schuyler, proved a hundred times by prints photographed
    from his own letters, toilet articles, and personal belongings in his own
    rooms. In his mad fury at the discovery of Ruth masquerading as Vicky Van,
    and in his sudden realization of all that it meant, he clutched the first
    weapon he saw, the little carver, to end her life and gratify his madness
    for revenge. Just in time, the watching Tibbets had intervened, stabbed Schuyler,
    and then ran upstairs, to escape through the hidden doors to the other house.</p>
  <p>Ruth, stunned at the sight of the blow driven by Tibbetts, and dazed by
    her own narrow escape from a fearful death, picked up the carver that dropped
    from Schuyler&rsquo;s lifeless hand and ran upstairs, too.</p>
  <p>She had, she explained afterward, a hazy idea that she was picking up the
    knife that Tibbetts had used, so bewildered was she at the swift turn of
    events. And as she stooped over Schuyler in her frenzy the waiter had seen
    her and assumed she was the murderer. This, too, explained the blood on the
    flounces of her gown&mdash;it had brushed the fallen figure of her husband
    and became stained at the touch.</p>
  <p>The two women had, of course, slipped through the connecting mirror doors
    into the Schuyler house, and long before the alarm was brought there they
    were rehabilitated and ready to receive the news.</p>
  <p>Then Ruth&rsquo;s quandary was a serious one. Innocent herself, she could
    not tell of her double life without making the whole affair public and incriminating
    Tibbetts, whom she loved almost as a mother and who had saved Ruth&rsquo;s
    life by a fraction of a second. An instant&rsquo;s delay and Schuyler&rsquo;s
    knife would have been driven into Ruth&rsquo;s heart.</p>
  <p>So, for Tibbetts&rsquo; sake, Ruth, perforce, kept the secret of Vicky Van.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was not ashamed of it,&rdquo; she told us, frankly. &ldquo;There
    was nothing really wrong in my living two lives. My husband denied me the
    pleasure and joy that life owed me, so I found it for myself. I never had
    a friend or committed a deed or said a word as Victoria Van Allen that all
    the world mightn&rsquo;t hear or know of. And I should have owned up to the
    whole scheme at once except that it would bring out the knowledge of Tibbetts&rsquo; act.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wished not to go back to the other house at all and should not
    have done so for myself. But I had reasons&mdash;connected with other people.
    A friend, whom I love, had asked the privilege of having certain letters
    sent her in my care, that is, in care of Miss Van Allen, and I had to go
    in once or twice to rescue those and so prevent a scandal that would ensue
    upon their discovery. For her sake I risked going back there at night. Also,
    I wanted my address book, for it has in it many addresses of people who are
    my charity beneficiaries. Mr. Schuyler never allowed me to contribute to
    any charitable cause, and I have enjoyed giving help to some who need and
    deserve it. These addresses I had to have, and I have them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Stone was right. The walls had tongues. He first noticed a little
    defect in the green paint in the living room, which I had retouched. Winnie
    told me of this, and I realized how clever Mr. Stone is. So, I threw away
    the paint I had used, which was in here, and I carefully thought out what
    else was incriminating and removed all I could from the other house. Fibsy
    noticed when I took a book from a table, but that book I wanted, because&mdash;&rdquo; she
    blushed&mdash;&rdquo;because Mr. Calhoun had given it to me and I wasn&rsquo;t
    sure I could get it any other way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the walls told all, and at the last I knew it was only a question
    of time when Mr. Stone or Terence would discover the doors. I suppose the
    strand of beads that caught as I escaped that night gave a hint, but they
    would have found them anyway. They are wonderful doors&mdash;in their working,
    I mean. No complicated mechanism, but merely so well made and adjusted that
    a touch opens or closes them, and absolutely silently. No one in this house
    ever dreamed the bathroom mirror was anything but a mirror. And in the other
    house the elaborate Florentine frame precluded all idea of a secret contrivance.
    The two feet of thickness of the house walls made a tiny cupboard, where
    I had that small safe installed, that we might put our wigs and such definitely
    incriminating bits of evidence in hiding, also Vicky&rsquo;s jewelry. But
    I always changed my costumes from one character to the other in Vicky Van&rsquo;s
    dressing-room, and so ran little or no chance of discovery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In a futile endeavor to distract attention from Victoria Van Allen
    I wrote a note to Ruth Schuyler and also wrote the one found in Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s
    desk. I did these things in hopes that the detectives would cease to watch
    for the return of Miss Van Allen, but it turned out differently. I assumed,
    of course, if search could be diverted from that house into other channels
    there would be a possibility of Tibbetts never being suspected. I am sorry
    she has confessed. I do not want her to be tried. She saved my life, and
    I would do anything to keep her from harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Tibbetts was tried and was acquitted. A just jury, knowing all of the
    facts, declared it was a case of justifiable homicide, and the verdict was &ldquo;Not
    guilty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Schuyler sisters were finally convinced that Ruth&rsquo;s life had been
    endangered by their brother&rsquo;s rage, and, though they condemned Tibbetts
    in their hearts, they said little in the face of public opinion.</p>
  <p>As for me, I couldn&rsquo;t wait until a conventional time had elapsed before
    telling my darling of my love for her own sweet self and, as I now realized,
    for Vicky Van also. I spent hours listening to the details of her double
    life; of the narrow escapes from discovery, and the frequent occasions of
    danger to her scheme. But Tibbetts&rsquo; watchful eyes and Ruth&rsquo;s
    own cleverness had made the plan feasible for two years, and it was only
    because Ruth had found her dear heart was inclining too greatly toward me
    that she had begun to think it her duty to give up her double life. She had
    recently decided to do so, for she was not willing to let our mutual interest
    ripen into love while she was the wife of another man.</p>
  <p>And so, if it hadn&rsquo;t all happened just as it did, I should never have
    won my darling, for she was about to give up the Van Allen house and I never
    should have had occasion to meet Mrs. Randolph Schuyler.</p>
  <p>It is all past history now, and Ruth and I are striving to forget even the
    memories of it. We live in another city, and Tibbetts is our faithful and
    beloved housekeeper.</p>
  <p>And often Ruth says to me: &ldquo;I know you love me, Chet, but sometimes
    I can&rsquo;t help feeling a little jealous of the girl you cared for&mdash;that,
    what&rsquo;s her name? Oh, yes, Vicky Van!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vicky Van was all right,&rdquo; I stoutly maintain. &ldquo;I never
    knew a more charming, sweeter, prettier, dearer little girl than Vicky!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But she was awfully made up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s where you score an advantage. The only thing about
    Vicky I disapproved of was her paint and powder. Thank heaven, my wife has
    a complexion that&rsquo;s all her own.&rdquo; And I kissed the soft, pale
    cheek of my own Ruth.</p>

Prout Has A Fare</b></h2>
  <p>Our  Pilgrim band of stern and rock-bound forefathers left us a goodly heritage in  New England. And, even though we may not still in awed tones call it holy  ground, yet the soil where first they trod calls forth a certain respect and  admiration not compelled by any other group of these United States.</p>
  <p>To  be sure they didn&#8217;t tread all of it. Lots and lots of square miles of ground  and lofty soil are still untrodden to any great extent, especially the northern  parts of the northern states.</p>
  <p>Maine,  with its great, beautiful Aroostook County, whose far-flung potato farms have a  charm all their own, and whose glistening white farmhouses have their barns  hitched on behind like majestic trains of cars&#8212;the exquisite tidiness of Maine  as a state far outranks all her twelve original sisters.</p>
  <p>In  New Hampshire the white paint is less immaculate, the state less tidily cleared  up, but the woods against a stormy sky their giant branches toss, and the  rocking pines of the forest roar their eternal welcome. Timid little lakes  nestle confidingly among the hills and the White Mountains cluster in majestic  serenity.</p>
  <p>And  then comes Vermont, beautiful, careless Vermont, forgetful of her white paint,  heedless of her broken-down fences, conscious only of her green Green Mountains  and the sounding aisles of her dim woods.</p>
  <p>East  of the Green Mountain Range, in northern Vermont, is wide, rolling country,  with here and there a handful of small hills dumped down as though they had  been flung at the Range and fell short of their mark. Among them are valleys  and lakes, vistas and scenery, verdure and foliage,&#8212;all that goes to make  Vermont what her beautiful name means.</p>
  <p>And  villages. These are not always as picturesque as they should be, but man&#8217;s  place in nature is frequently out of harmony with his surroundings.</p>
  <p>What  should be a quaint little hamlet with an old white-spired church and a few  clustering cottages, is more often a Four Corners or a few rods or perches of a  stupid-looking Main Street, totally lacking in pride, prosperity, or paint.</p>
  <p>Farm-houses  are shabby and fences dilapidated, yet, after all, there are sites and  spots&#8212;oh, the sites and spots of Vermont!</p>
  <p>If  one wanted to build ten thousand homes, he could find a satisfying site or spot  for each and have as many left over.</p>
  <p>In  our forefathers&#8217; days, the soil where first they trod was considered the very  thing for highroads, but now the broad white ribbon of concrete that tangles  itself among the green hills is exceedingly convenient, without marring the  picture.</p>
  <p>And  the towns that chance to impinge on or straddle that road are up to date and  almost a part of the living, bustling world outside.</p>
  <p>But  the towns reached by the lesser roads, the older roads,&#8212;they have no animal  spirits and lead a mere vegetable life.</p>
  <p>Unless  a great country house has been built on a site or a spot nearby, these little  villages have none at all to praise and very few to love.</p>
  <p>Hilldale  was one of the prettiest of these villages and was in fairly good repair. This  was owing to the fact that it had offered an unsurpassed site for a gentleman&#8217;s  country house.</p>
  <p>The  gentleman had materialized, and so, later, did the house.</p>
  <p>It  had happened forty years ago. Vicissitudes had removed the gentleman but the  house remained&#8212;remained empty for years, and at last, five years ago, had been  bought, furnished, and occupied.</p>
  <p>Yet  the fact of the house, half a mile from the village street, so influenced and  stimulated the villagers that unconsciously they lived up to it and gloried in  its possession as in an invisible jewel held in trust.</p>
  <p>For  the house was invisible, by reason of those same dim woods and rocking pines,  and moreover, because of high and strong stone walls.</p>
  <p>Yet  it was there and it was theirs, so Hilldale plumed itself and went about its  business.</p>
  <p>Off  the main travelled road of traffic, it was also off the main line of the  railroad and was reached by a tiny spur, whose trains, not impressed by the  great house, ran with a debonair disregard of timetables or schedules.</p>
  <p>And  so, when one of these trains pulled up with a grinding jerk, and the leisurely,  easy-going conductor sang out, &#8220;Hilldale!&#8221; John Haydock, who had risen, almost  fell over backward by reason of the sudden stop.</p>
  <p>The  train was nearly an hour late, and though still well up in the heavens, the  November sun was secretly preparing for a quick swoop down and out. The air was  damp and raw, with a feeling that portended snow.</p>
  <p>Beautiful  Vermont had lost her green, but was bravely substituting a glory of red and  russet and gold that clad her hills and dales with a blaze of autumn beauty.</p>
  <p>John  Haydock shivered as he stepped to the station platform, then drew up his  overcoat collar, and appreciatively lapped up the beauty of the scene even  while he looked about at conditions.</p>
  <p>He  saw a phlegmatic looking man standing near an elderly Ford, and with admirable  sagacity deduced a local taxi driver.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  want to go to Homer Vincent&#8217;s,&#8221; Haydock said, half expecting the man would  drawl out &#8220;Wal, why don&#8217;t ye, then?&#8221; after the approved manner of Vermont  natives in fiction.</p>
  <p>But  the influence of the house wouldn&#8217;t allow that, and the man merely gave a sort  of grunt that seemed to mean &#8220;All right,&#8221; or &#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Moreover,  he showed a gleam of curiosity in his hard, weather-beaten blue eyes, and moved  with alacrity as he took the stranger&#8217;s bag.</p>
  <p>But  he said nothing as he held the car door open for his passenger, and then took  his own place at the wheel.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  it far from the village?&#8221; Haydock asked. The driver rolled a blue eye around at  him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t  never been there, eh?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s about halfa mile,&#8212;good halfa mile.  I ain&#8217;t never been in the house myself. Druv up to the entrance now, naginn,&#8212;just  now, naginn. Great place!&#8221;</p>
  <p>He  spoke in an awe-struck voice, as one might of some masterpiece of God or man,  and Haydock said, involuntarily:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  it such a beautiful house?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  it? <i>Is it!</i> Well, you&#8217;ll soon see!&#8221;</p>
  <p>They  had left the village now, and were passing along a wooded country road,  beautiful with its pines and hemlocks among the bright autumn leaves. A few  roads branched to right or left, but the Ford car clattered straight ahead.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Vincent get over his broken leg?&#8221; Haydock asked. &#8220;Can he walk all right?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yep,  mostly. Has a little limp&#8212;you&#8217;d hardly notice it, though. Course we don&#8217;t see  him hardly ever.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Recluse?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  quite that,&#8212;but sticks to his home mostly. Miss Vincent, now, she&#8217;s more  sociably inclined.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss  Rosemary?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  no, I didn&#8217;t mean her,&#8212;I meant the old lady,&#8212;Mr. Vincent&#8217;s sister. Miss  Rosemary, now, she&#8217;s here, there, and everywhere. Ridin&#8217; a horse, drivin&#8217; a  car, walkin&#8217;, skatin&#8217; and they do say they&#8217;re goin&#8217; to keep an airoplane.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Really?  How up to date they are.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  they are, an&#8217; they ain&#8217;t. Yes, sir, they are, &#8216;n&#8217; they ain&#8217;t. The old man, now&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  do you call Mr. Homer Vincent an old man?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thasso.  He can&#8217;t be mor&#8217;n fifty,&#8212;&#8217;n&#8217; yet, he somehow seems old.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;To  look at?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  no; though &#8216;s I said, I don&#8217;t often see him. But if he&#8217;s passin&#8217; in his motor  car, he don&#8217;t look out an&#8217; nod at people,&#8212;see, an&#8217; he don&#8217;t seem to be smilin&#8217;&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Grumpy?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  so much that as&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Indifferent?  Preoccupied?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  more like it. Thinkin&#8217; &#8216;bout his own affairs, seemin&#8217;ly. An&#8217; they do say he  does himself mighty well. And why shouldn&#8217;t he,&#8212;seein&#8217;s he has plenty of money.  Why shouldn&#8217;t he, I say?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  he married?&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  driver turned fully around, leaving the temperamental Ford to its own sweet  will for a moment.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Homer  Vincent married!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I should say not! Him married!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s  so strange about that? Lots of men marry.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  they do. Oh, well,&#8212;no, Mr. Vincent, he ain&#8217;t married.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  does he do? Any business?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Land,  no; he&#8217;s got more money&#8217;n he knows what to do with. He just enjoys himself, one  way &#8216;n&#8217; another,&#8212;just one way &#8216;n&#8217; another. Miss Vincent, now, Miss Anne, she  rides about, stylish like, an&#8217; makes fashionable calls on the minister an&#8217; a  few families of the town. They been here five years now, an&#8217; yet mighty few people  knows &#8216;em atall.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  didn&#8217;t build his fine house?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Land,  no. It was built long ago, by a man named Lamont,&#8212;long about eighteen-eighty it  was begun. Took years to build it, o&#8217; course.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  it so elaborate, then?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  it? Look, here&#8217;s the beginnin&#8217; of the stone wall now. See?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good  heavens, what a wall!&#8221; and Haydock stared at the high, massive, tessellated  structure of carefully hewn and laid blue dolomite, that seemed to extend  interminably.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yep,  that&#8217;s it,&#8221; and the speaker wagged his head in deep pride of ownership. For  Hilldale felt that it owned the place individually as well as collectively; and  this in utter disregard of any opinion Mr. Vincent might hold on the matter.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s  an inventor, you know,&#8221; Haydock was further informed, as they neared the gates.  &#8220;But I don&#8217;t think he invents anything.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  great iron gates stood open but gave access only to a long avenue shaded by  almost perfect specimens of the beautiful &#8220;wine-glass&#8221; elm.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  kinda ellum tree&#8217;s just about gone now,&#8221;&#8212;said Haydock&#8217;s guide. &#8220;Mighty few  left in all New England. Fine ones, these. Now, here begins the poplar row. See&#8217;m,&#8212;not  Lombardy,&#8212;they&#8217;re North Carolina poplars. I guess Mr. Vincent set these out.  They ain&#8217;t long-lived. Well, here we come to the wooded drive. The rest of the  way to the house is right through a jungle. I&#8217;d hate it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  jungle was a grove, rather sparse than thick, of pine, spruce, hemlock, and  larch, and its shadows were dank and black.</p>
  <p>An  occasional white birch, slender and ghostly, instead of lightening the gloom,  rather added to it, and the rays of the now setting sun could scarcely  penetrate the murk.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  very cheerful,&#8221; was Haydock&#8217;s comment.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  here, sir, is the tree that gives the place its name.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  is its name?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Greatlarch,&#8212;that&#8217;s  what they call it, Greatlarch,&#8212;&#8217;count o&#8217; that big tree there. See?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Haydock  looked and saw the tallest larch tree he had ever seen. It was enormous, a most  magnificent specimen. Surely the name was well chosen.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  a hummer,&#8221; he agreed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yep;  nothin&#8217; like in these parts,&#8212;an&#8217; I don&#8217;t believe, nowhere.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t either!&#8221; said Haydock, regardless of negatives in his enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  you see, sir, we come to the entrance proper. This stone gateway&#8217;s where I  leave you. Want me to wait?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221;  and Haydock dropped his sociable manner and became again a stranger. &#8220;What do I  owe you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;One  dollar, sir. Don&#8217;t want me to wait? You stayin&#8217; here?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Haydock  looked at him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  not sure just what I shall do. Have you a telephone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir; call 87 Hilldale&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  your name?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Prout.  Mr. Vincent knows me. Tell him you want Prout,&#8212;that is, if you do want me. To  take you back,&#8212;you know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I gathered that was what you meant. Good day, Prout.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  entrance was a massive arch with a tower on either side.</p>
  <p>It  seemed to include guard-rooms and connected with what was doubtless a porter&#8217;s  lodge.</p>
  <p>Haydock  stared at the heavy stone-work, the beautiful design, and the hint of green  velvety lawn through the arch.</p>
  <p>He  wished the daylight would linger, but it was even now almost gone. The gathering  dusk gave the scene an eerie aspect, the great larch whispered as its long  branches slowly tossed about, and the pines responded with a murmur of their  own.</p>
  <p>Seeing  no one, Haydock stepped through the deep, wide archway, and then stood still,  spellbound at what he saw.</p>
  <p>A  pile of gray stone, red-tiled roofs, tall chimneys, towers, turrets, dormers,&#8212;a  perfect example of a French chateau of the period of the Renaissance.</p>
  <p>Haydock  knew enough of architecture to realize that he was gazing at a masterpiece. He  had no idea there was such a building in America. Perfect in every detail,  exquisitely set in the midst of rolling lawns, well-placed shrubbery, and noble  old trees, with half glimpses, in the fading light, of terraces and gardens  beyond.</p>
  <p>Deeply  impressed, he approached the entrance, a recessed portico on the north side of  the house.</p>
  <p>Outer  doors of massive oak stood open, and he entered a vestibule wainscoted and  paved with richly hued marble.</p>
  <p>Wrapt  in contemplation of the detail work, he pushed an electric bell, and was still  unheeding when the door opened and a butler faced him inquiringly.</p>
  <p>He  felt a slight thrill of disappointment, for, without knowing it, he had  subconsciously looked for a lackey in gold lace or at least a powdered and  plushed footman.</p>
  <p>But  this man, beyond all question a butler, and a knowing one, gave Haydock an  appraising glance, and in a tone nicely poised between deference and inquiry,  said:</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  wish to see&#8212;&#8221; The voice trailed off to nothingness, but the barrier form of the  butler gave way no inch of vantage.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Homer Vincent,&#8221; said Haydock, suddenly recovering his wits, and speaking with a  firm decision.</p>
  <p>&#8220;By  appointment?&#8221; But the severity of the butler&#8217;s manner perceptibly decreased and  he even stepped back from the threshold.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  not by appointment,&#8221; and John Haydock came under the portal and into the  beautiful entrance hall. Again he was nearly swept off his feet by what he saw.  Marble walls and floors, painted friezes, vistas of rooms opening one from  another&#8212;surely he was transported to some Arabian Nights&#8217; Dream.</p>
  <p>And  again he was recalled to equanimity by that calm, cool voice:</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  name shall I give Mr. Vincent?&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  after the merest instant of hesitation, Haydock said:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell  him Henry Johnson wishes to see him,&#8212;on business, private, personal, and  important.&#8221;</p>
  <p>This  speech was accompanied by a straight, sharp glance at the man, and the visitor,  half turning, began to give himself up to contemplation of his surroundings.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir. Will you step in the reception room, sir?&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  reception room, in a large circular tower, was at the right as one entered the  house, and to this Haydock went.</p>
  <p>The  butler disappeared, and Haydock studied the room.</p>
  <p>It  was of the period known as Perpendicular Gothic, and the side walls, delicately  paneled in old oak, reached to the richly ornamented and domed ceiling.</p>
  <p>The  chimney-piece, which curved with the circular wall of the room, was of the rare  Italian marble known as Red of Vecchiano, and it was Haydock&#8217;s study of this  that was interrupted by the entrance of his host.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  like it?&#8221; Homer Vincent said in a tone of slight amusement. &#8220;It is the only bit  of that stone ever brought to this country.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Turning,  Haydock saw a moderately tall man with moderately broad shoulders. His hands  were in his pockets, and the smile that had sounded in his voice was  perceptible on his strong, well-cut lips.</p>
  <p>He  stood erect, his head thrown a trifle back, as if sizing up the situation.</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  you like, I&#8217;ll show you the whole house,&#8221; he offered. &#8220;It&#8217;s worth seeing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  now, Haydock looked at him as if sizing him up. Seemingly he had forgotten the  house in his interest in its owner.</p>
  <p>He  saw a strong face, which, though now smiling with courtesy, yet looked as if,  on occasion, it could be hard, even severe.</p>
  <p>This  may have been imagination, for Homer Vincent&#8217;s whole manner and attitude  betokened only a friendly welcome.</p>
  <p>But  Haydock noted the firm curve of the chin, the straight line of the lips, and  the haughty, aristocratic effect of the Roman nose, and concluded, offhand, that  Homer Vincent was a power.</p>
  <p>The  dark hair was thickly streaked with gray, and the deep-set gray eyes were of a  peculiar penetration. And yet, important though the man doubtless was, he had  an air of indolence, of impatience under annoyance, that was unmistakable and  impossible to ignore.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,&#8221;  he said, shortly, &#8220;well, Mr. Henry Johnson, what do you want to see me about?&#8221;</p>
  <p>With  a cautionary glance out through the doorway, Haydock leaned toward him and  whispered two words in his ear.</p>
  <p>Vincent  permitted himself a slight raising of the eyebrows,&#8212;an unusual concession to  interest or surprise.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  do right to be discreet,&#8221; he said; &#8220;let us go to my own private room,&#8212;it is  just across the hall.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He  led the guest across toward the circular room in the opposite turret,  corresponding with the reception room.</p>
  <p>And  this time Haydock couldn&#8217;t restrain his exclamations.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let  the business wait a few moments,&#8221; said Vincent, almost gleefully. &#8220;I admit I am  proud of my home; let me show you a little of it.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  see, it was built many years ago by one Lamont, an eccentric millionaire. It is  an exact copy of one of the finest of the French chateaux. Moreover, it is  built of the most magnificent marbles ever perhaps collected under one roof.  Just the walls of this hall show French Griotte, Porte Venere, Verde Martin,  and here you see American Black,&#8212;from Glens Falls. The floor is Morial marble  from Lake Champlain.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ahead  of you, looking toward the back of the house, you see the Atrium, copied  faithfully from the Erectheum at Athens. We will not go there now,&#8212;nor to the  Organ wing, where I have one of the largest and finest pipe organs in the  world. We will go now into my own private room, and you shall tell me all about  this matter you speak of.&#8221;</p>
  <p>They  crossed the hall, Haydock scarce able to tear his eyes from the cabinets,  paintings, and rare pieces of furniture. The tall chimney-piece of the hall,  Vincent said, was of Bois de Orient marble from Africa.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  all these rare marbles?&#8221; Haydock cried.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  was Lamont&#8217;s fad,&#8221; Vincent replied. &#8220;And I&#8217;m glad he did it, for it saved my  having to collect them. I bought the place complete, though totally  unfurnished. It has been my pleasure to collect suitable furnishings and I have  enjoyed the task.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  should say so!&#8221; and Haydock stared about the room they entered, which was  Vincent&#8217;s very own.</p>
  <p>Circular  in form, it was finished in rare woods with a mantel of Siena marble and  bronze, which showed figures of Hercules in statuary marble. The furniture,  while not over-ornate, was in keeping with the character of the room. In the  center was a great flat-topped desk, carved and inlaid, and at this the two men  sat down.</p>
  <p>It  was after an hour&#8217;s conversation that Vincent said: &#8220;I will send for my  sister,&#8212;we must consult with her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>A  bell brought the imperturbable, yet eagerly solicitous butler, whose name,  Haydock now learned, was Mellish.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go  to Miss Anne,&#8221; Vincent directed; &#8220;ask her to join me here if she will be so  good. Tell her I have a caller here. And, by the way, Mr. Johnson, will you not  stay the night? Then we can talk at our leisure and, also, I can show you over  the house, which I feel sure will interest you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Haydock  looked at his host questioningly, decided he meant his invitation sincerely,  and accepted.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I have no evening togs with me,&#8221; he demurred.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  matter, we will be informal. I am myself not overly given to conventions and my  niece is dining out. Mellish, take Mr. Johnson&#8217;s bag to the south guest room,  and make him comfortable there.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mellish  departed, and after informing Miss Vincent, went about his other errands.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Man  here,&#8221; he announced a little later to his wife, who was also the Vincents&#8217;  cook. &#8220;Nicish chap, but addle-pated. So took up with the house he don&#8217;t know  what he&#8217;s saying.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;They&#8217;re  often took like that,&#8221; returned Mrs. Mellish, placidly. &#8220;Where&#8217;s he put?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  the south room.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;H&#8217;m;  master must set a pile by him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know about that. I&#8217;m not sure they ever met before.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Too  bad Miss Rosemary&#8217;s out,&#8212;she likes a stranger here now and then.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Miss Rosemary wouldn&#8217;t look at him. He&#8217;s not her sort,&#8221; said Mellish.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky2"></a>Chapter 2 <br>
The Guest At Greatlarch</b></h2>
  <p>The  organ hall at Greatlarch was a massive west wing, with transepts looking north  and south. The hall, as large as a small church, was Corinthian in design, with  side walls of antique oak, marvellously carved and gilded, that had been  brought from England in panels. High above the antique oak cornice rose the  vaulted, coffered ceiling and at the east end was a balcony that might be  reached from the second story. A rose window in the third story also looked  down into the beautiful room.</p>
  <p>In  the semicircular west end was the great organ, and at its keyboard sat Homer  Vincent, his capable hands caressing the keys with a gentle yet an assured  touch. He usually spent the hour before dinner at the organ, and those who knew  him could divine his mood from the music they heard.</p>
  <p>Tonight  his mood was variable, uncertain. He struck slow, close harmonies in a  desultory fashion, his fine head bowed a trifle as if in deep thought. Then, suddenly,  he would lift his head, and the organ would peal forth a triumphant strain,  like a song of victory. Or some crashing chords would resound for a moment, to  be followed by a silence or by a return to the slow, meditative harmonies.</p>
  <p>Sometimes  he would play works of the masters and again he would drift into improvisations  of his own.</p>
  <p>As  the dinner hour drew near, Anne Vincent came from her room on a mezzanine  floor, and went directly to the gallery that overlooked the organ room.</p>
  <p>A  slight little lady, a spinster of forty-seven, she had enough pretensions to  good looks to warrant her pride in dress. Her hair would have been gray, but  for discreet applications of a certain concoction. It would have been straight,  but for the modern invention known as a permanent wave. And so, she presented  to the world a beautifully coifed head of dark-brown hair, whose frantic frizz  was persuaded to lie in regular, though somewhat intractable waves. Her eyes  were gray, like her brother&#8217;s, but more bright and piercing. Her air was alert,  observant and interested. Where Homer Vincent showed utter indifference to the  universe at large, his sister manifested interest, even curiosity, toward all  mundane matters.</p>
  <p>Her  slight figure was youthful, her manner animated, and her clothes were in  exquisite taste and bore the labels of the best modistes.</p>
  <p>Tonight  she wore a Georgette gown of a pale apricot color, simply made, but with  delicate, floating draperies that betokened the skilled hand of an artist. Her  only ornament was a large and perfect ruby, set in finely wrought gold work.</p>
  <p>With  a light step she tripped down the short mezzanine stairs to the upper front  hall. This was no less beautiful than the hall below. It was flanked on either  side by four Corinthian columns with gilded capitals, and the panelled ceiling  was modelled after one in the Ducal Palace at Venice.</p>
  <p>Save  for the Tower rooms on either side, this hall took up the entire front of the  house, and from it a balcony rested on the portico above the main entrance.</p>
  <p>Through  the hall Miss Anne went, her high-heeled slippers making no sound on the rugs,  which were skins of polar bears.</p>
  <p>Through  to the balcony above the organ room she passed and stood, one slim hand on the  carved balustrade, looking down at her brother.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Poor  Homer,&#8221; she thought to herself; &#8220;he doesn&#8217;t know what to do. But of course Mr.  Johnson is right in the matter,&#8212;and of course he knows&#8212;my! it means a lot of  money! Well, Homer has plenty&#8212;if he will only think so. A strange man, that Mr.  Johnson&#8212;now I think I like him,&#8212;and then&#8212;I don&#8217;t&#8212;I wish I&#8212;but, of course,&#8212;my  heavens! here he comes now!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Anne  Vincent looked up with a smile as Haydock joined her on the balcony.</p>
  <p>The  man was still rolling his eyes about as if in a very ecstasy of delight in what  he saw.</p>
  <p>This  was his first glimpse of the organ, as after their talk Vincent had sent him to  his room to tidy up for dinner.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  regret my informal attire&#8212;&#8221; he began, as he joined Miss Anne, but she brushed  aside his apology.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  all right,&#8221; she said; &#8220;we&#8217;re always informal when we&#8217;re alone. Now I should  like elaborate dress every night, but my brother and my niece wouldn&#8217;t hear to  such a thing. So you&#8217;re quite all right, Mr. Johnson. What do you think of the  organ?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  have no adjectives left, Miss Vincent. The whole place stuns me, I can scarcely  believe I am in America,&#8212;I feel transported to the France of the Renaissance.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  are familiar with the history of that period?&#8221; She looked at him curiously.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221;  he replied, honestly enough. &#8220;No, I am not. But I know this is all of that era,  and anyway, it so overwhelms me, I can&#8217;t quite analyze my emotions.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I felt like that when we first came here. But five years have made me feel at  home in this atmosphere. Your room, Mr. Johnson, is just above my own. It looks  out on the south gardens and I am sure you noticed the lagoon and the Greek  Temple?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course I did, though the twilight view made me only more anxious to see it all  by daylight.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Which  you can do in the morning. My niece will be here then, and she will show you  the grounds. That Greek Temple is a Mausoleum.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  wondrously beautiful one!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  is it not? And now, dinner is served,&#8212;come Mr. Johnson,&#8221; and then, &#8220;Come,  Homer,&#8221; she called to her brother at the organ.</p>
  <p>Vincent  met them in the lower hall, and ushered them into the Atrium. This, perhaps the  most imposing feature of the house, was a pure and perfect example of Greek  Ionic architecture.</p>
  <p>From  the floor of native white marble, rose sixteen monolithic columns with gilded  capitals and bases of Bois de Orient and Vert Maurin marble. The side walls  were of Rose of Ivory marble quarried in the Atlas mountains of North Africa.</p>
  <p>These  details Homer Vincent told his guest as they passed through the great room, and  drew his attention to the tall plate-glass windows that formed the whole  southern end.</p>
  <p>Between  the Ionic columns of the semicircular south portico could be seen the lagoon  with its fountain, and at its far end gleamed the pure white of the Greek  Temple against a dark setting of pines and larches.</p>
  <p>Johnson  sighed as they turned to the dining room, another marvel of Italian  Renaissance, in antique English oak, with tall chimney-piece of French Griotte  and Belgium Black marbles.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  wonder,&#8221; Haydock said, whimsically, as they took their seats, &#8220;if the native marble  of Vermont resents the presence of these imported strangers.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  have thought that, too,&#8221; and Miss Anne&#8217;s eyes twinkled, &#8220;I am sure it is the  case.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;They  dislike one another,&#8221; Vincent said, taking up the jest. &#8220;The Italian and  African marbles scorn the Vermont stone, however pure and white. But they are  silent about it, for the most part. In our living room is a chimney-piece of  Porte Venere or &#8216;Black and Gold&#8217; marble from Spezia, which, with its gold  bronze ornaments is one of the handsomest and most expensive features of the  house. You will forgive my descanting on these things, Mr. Johnson, but I own  up that this house is my hobby, and I am a bit daft over it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; declared Haydock, with honest enthusiasm. &#8220;And I am glad to hear  these details. Of course, I am especially interested, because of&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am going to ask of you,&#8221; Vincent interrupted him, &#8220;not to discuss during dinner  the business on which you came here. It is,&#8221; he smiled, &#8220;bad for our digestion  to think deeply while eating, and too, I want you to do justice to the art of  my cook.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  dinner, indeed, as well as the service of it, was entirely in harmony with the  surroundings, and though there was no unnecessary pomp or ceremony, the details  were perfect and correct.</p>
  <p>Mellish,  like a guardian spirit, hovered about, and two waitresses under his  jurisdiction were sufficient to insure the comfort of the party.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am sorry your niece is not at home,&#8221; Haydock said, as Rosemary&#8217;s name was  casually mentioned.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  shall see her tomorrow,&#8221; Vincent promised. &#8220;This evening we must have another  confab in my study as to our business, and I trust we shall settle it to the  satisfaction of all. Mr.&#8212;er&#8212;Johnson, you must remain here for a time as our  guest.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thank  you,&#8221; Haydock said, simply. &#8220;I trust I may do so.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He  looked at Miss Anne, as if expecting a confirmation of the invitation, but she  said nothing.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  suppose,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that, having your sister and your niece, you have not felt  the need of a wife as chatelaine of this wonder-home.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent smiled.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  afraid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;no wife would put up with my vagaries. I&#8217;m not an easy man  to live with&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  now, Homer,&#8221; his sister protested, &#8220;you sha&#8217;n&#8217;t malign yourself. If my brother  is a bit spoiled, Mr. Johnson, it is because my niece and I pet and humor him.  It is our pleasure to do so. You see, my brother is a very remarkable man.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  my sister is blindly prejudiced in my favor,&#8221; Vincent tossed back. &#8220;We are a  very happy family, and perhaps the more so that each of us follows his or her  own sweet will.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Although  no outward change took place on the features of the blank-countenanced Mellish,  yet could one have seen into his brain, there was indication of unseemly  derision and unholy mirth.</p>
  <p>For,  as a matter of fact, every one at Greatlarch, whether family, guest, or  servant, followed the sweet will of Homer Vincent.</p>
  <p>At  least, he did if he knew what was good for himself.</p>
  <p>Yet  Vincent was no tyrant. He was merely a man whose only desire in life was  creature comfort; whose only pursuit was his own pleasure; whose only ambition  was to be let alone.</p>
  <p>His  sister and niece might do what they would, so long as they did not interfere  with his plans. His servants might have much liberty, many indulgences, if they  would but attend perfectly to his wants or needs. Guests could have the freedom  of the place, if they kept out of his way when not wanted.</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent was not so much selfish as he was self-indulgent,&#8212;self-centered. He was  scholarly and loved his books; musical, and loved his organ; artistic and  aesthetic, and loved his house and his collections; he was of an inventive turn  of mind, and loved to potter about in his various workrooms and laboratories,  without being bothered as to what he was doing.</p>
  <p>In  return for these favors he gave his sister and niece pretty much a free hand to  do as they chose, checking them now and then in the matter of expenditures. For  though the Vincent fortune was large, it was not inexhaustible, and the upkeep  of the place was enormous. Yet it must be kept up in a manner to please Homer  Vincent&#8217;s ideas of comfort, even though this necessitated curtailing the  hospitalities toward which Miss Anne and Rosemary inclined.</p>
  <p>Homer  was kindly by nature; he really disliked to deny Anne anything she wanted, but,  as he said, they couldn&#8217;t entertain all Hilldale all the time, especially as  they had no desire to accept return hospitalities.</p>
  <p>And  if Miss Anne did have such an undesirable desire, she kept it to herself, for  she adored her clever brother.</p>
  <p>Her  other brother, the father of Rosemary, had died five years before, an event  which resulted in the girl&#8217;s coming to live with these relatives.</p>
  <p>The  household was harmonious,&#8212;if and when the two women sank their own wills in the  will of Homer Vincent. Otherwise not.</p>
  <p>Not  that there was ever any friction, or unpleasantness.</p>
  <p>Vincent  had a way of attaining his end without such. And, perhaps through habit,  perhaps following the line of least resistance, both the older woman and the  girl willingly capitulated when conditions required it.</p>
  <p>For  Rosemary loved her Uncle Homer, and Miss Anne fairly worshipped him.</p>
  <p>It  went without saying, therefore, that Vincent&#8217;s hint that business matters  should not be discussed at the table, was effectual.</p>
  <p>Haydock  acquitted himself fairly well. The interest he felt in the business which had  brought him thither, and the absorbing entertainment of this beautiful home,  filled his mind to the exclusion of all else. And since the first subject was  for the moment taboo, he pursued the other with zest.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  man who built this was a genius,&#8221; he declared.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  was built,&#8221; Vincent informed him, &#8220;by a prominent firm of New York architects,  but as they faithfully copied an old French chateau, they had little need for  originality. Of course it was a folly. These great palaces often are. After  getting it, the owner found he hadn&#8217;t sufficient fortune left to keep it up. So  it came into the market, and years later I was fortunate enough to get it at a  great bargain. Probably I paid not half of the original building cost.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Lack  of funds wasn&#8217;t the only reason that Mr. Lamont wanted to sell it,&#8221; Miss Anne  said, with a glance at her brother.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221;  and Homer Vincent looked grave. &#8220;There is a tragedy connected with the place,  but I try not to let it affect my nerves or even linger in my memory. I wish  you would do the same, Anne.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  it doesn&#8217;t get on my nerves, Homer, but I can&#8217;t put it out of my memory,  altogether. I am reminded of it too often.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;May  I hear the story?&#8221; asked Haydock, looking from one to the other.</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  you wish,&#8221; Vincent said, a little unwillingly; &#8220;but it&#8217;s not a cheerful one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Anything  connected with this wonderful place must be of interest,&#8221; Haydock declared, and  Anne Vincent began the tale.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  a ghost story,&#8221; she said, her eyes showing a sort of horrified fascination. &#8220;You  see, Mrs. Lamont, the wife of the former owner, was murdered in her bed&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  Anne,&#8221; her brother interrupted, &#8220;we don&#8217;t know that she was&#8212;it may have been a  suicide.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221;  Miss Anne declared, positively, &#8220;she was murdered, and her ghost still haunts  the place.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Have  you seen it?&#8221; Haydock asked. He had deep interest in the occult.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  haven&#8217;t seen it,&#8212;but I&#8217;ve heard of it,&#8221; she replied, in a whisper. &#8220;What do you  suppose it does? It plays the harp&#8212;the Wild Harp!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  come now, Anne, don&#8217;t bore Mr. Johnson with your fairy tales.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent was in the best possible humor. He had had a dinner that exactly suited  him, perfectly served, and now as he pushed back his chair a little, he was  raising a cigar to his lips, knowing that at the instant it reached them a  lighted match, in Mellish&#8217;s careful hand, would touch the other end of it.  Knowing, too, that an ash-tray would materialize on the exact spot of the  tablecloth that he wished it, and that, simultaneously, his coffee cup would be  removed.</p>
  <p>These  things were necessary to Homer Vincent&#8217;s happiness, and his thorough drilling  of Mellish had made them immutable.</p>
  <p>He  had instructed the butler long ago to measure carefully with a yardstick the  exact distances between the four table candlesticks as well as their distance  from the edge of the table.</p>
  <p>Yet  Vincent was no &#8220;Miss Nancy,&#8221; no feminine or effeminate fusser in woman&#8217;s  domain. All details of housekeeping were left to Miss Anne, whom he had also  trained. But the most infinitesimal derelictions from exact order and routine  were noticed and reproved by Homer Vincent and rarely indeed did the same error  occur twice.</p>
  <p>In  fact, after his five years of occupancy, he had his home in perfect running  order, as he conceived perfection.</p>
  <p>Banquets  were never given, house guests were rare, callers infrequent, because none of  these things contributed to the comfort of Homer Vincent. His tranquil days  were occupied with his pleasant avocations indoors, varied by motor trips,  horseback rides, or country rambles.</p>
  <p>His  stables and garage boasted the finest horses and cars, and in addition he was  seriously contemplating an aeroplane. Indeed, he had already ordered plans  drawn for a hangar.</p>
  <p>All  of his belongings were at the service of his sister and niece at such times as  he did not himself require them. It was their duty to find out when these times  were.</p>
  <p>But  the two women had no trouble about this. Vincent was not unreasonable, and both  Miss Anne and Rosemary were astute enough to read him pretty well.</p>
  <p>He  required Anne to be always present to preside at his table. To be sure, he did  the presiding himself, but he wished her at the head of the board always. This  precluded her accepting invitations which did not include him or which he was  not inclined to accept. However, the placid lady was more than willing to defer  to his preferences.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  was allowed more freedom in these matters and went to visit her girl friends as  often as she chose. Having them to visit her was another matter, and only to be  suggested with the greatest discretion and careful choice of opportunity.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  Miss Anne was saying, &#8220;and, do you know, Mr. Johnson, my room,&#8212;my bedroom is  the one she had, and the one that is said to be haunted by her ghost!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Really,  Miss Vincent? And are you not timid&#8212;?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  a bit! You see, it is the loveliest room in the house,&#8212;except brother&#8217;s, and I  would be silly to refuse it because of a foolish superstition.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  below my room, you said, I think?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  facing south,&#8212;looking out on the lagoon and fountain and on down to that  beautiful marble Temple&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is a tomb!&#8221; finished Vincent. &#8220;Any other woman would be scared to death to look  out on that view, but I believe my sister enjoys it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  surely do, Homer. Often I look out there on moonlight nights and feel sorry for  the poor lady. And&#8212;&#8221; her voice fell, &#8220;sometimes I hear her&#8212;playing on her  harp&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  come now, Anne, you&#8217;ll get Mr. Johnson so wrought up he won&#8217;t dare sleep in his  own room, which of course has the same outlook!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  not superstitious,&#8221; Haydock averred. &#8220;In fact, I should like to hear the  ghostly harp&#8212;though I cannot say I&#8217;d welcome a spook visitor!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let  us look out in that direction,&#8221; said Vincent, rising. His idea of Anne&#8217;s  presiding was to have her ready to arise at his signal, not the other way.</p>
  <p>He  led them back through the Atrium and on out to the great semicircular portico  that was the southern entrance.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  chilly,&#8221; he said, as he opened a long plate-glass door. &#8220;Better stay inside,  Anne. Just a moment, Mr. Johnson, unless you think it too cold?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  I like it,&#8221; and Haydock stepped out into the crisp night air.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Feels  like snow,&#8221; said Vincent. &#8220;Now, of course, tomorrow you can see this in the  sunlight, but in this dim murk, with the shadows so deep and black, it is a  picturesque sight, is it not?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  wonderful!&#8221; Haydock exclaimed, looking across the black water of the lagoon,  where the dimly seen fountain did not obscure the faint gleam of white marble  that was the Mausoleum.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  like to keep that thing there?&#8221; he asked, curiously.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  not?&#8221; and Vincent shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;Since it doesn&#8217;t worry the ladies,  and I have no fear of spooks, why should I have it removed? It is exquisite,  the Temple. The model, as you can scarcely see now, is that of the Parthenon.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  did the story of the haunting come about?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Since  it is supposed that the lady was murdered, it would be more strange if such a  story did not arise. It was long ago, you know. I&#8217;ve been here five years, but  before that the house stood empty for nearly twenty years. In that time many  legends found credence, and many ghostly scenes were reported. Apparitions flitting  round the tomb are the most common reports, but strains of a wild harp also are  vouched for. Indeed, my sister thinks she has heard them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Have  you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent hesitated, and then said, &#8220;There have been times when I thought I did.  But of course it was imagination,&#8212;stimulated by the weird aspect of the place.  Look at that thicket back of the Temple. Even now, you can seem to see moving  shadows.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  is behind there?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is a sort of undergrowth of low pines and birches, scrub oaks and elms, a  tangle,&#8212;almost a jungle, of vines and canebrakes&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Swampy?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  quite that,&#8212;though mucky after a long rainy spell. I threaten now and then to  have it all cleared out and drained,&#8212;but I haven&#8217;t got at it yet. It is more or  less fenced off,&#8212;you can just see the low stones&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  they look like gravestones.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent  smiled. &#8220;They do. That adds to the spookiness. Do you know the villagers,  before I came here, called the place Spooky Hollow?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  a good name, too!&#8221; Haydock shivered. The atmosphere of gloom was beginning to  tell on his nerves. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll seek the bright lights! It&#8217;s fairly creepy out  here!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent  turned toward the house, his slight limp showing itself a little as he crossed  the tiled terrace.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is all most wonderful,&#8221; Haydock summed up, as they re-entered, &#8220;but it does not  make me forget my mission here&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let  that wait, my dear sir, until we are by ourselves.&#8221;</p>
  <p>For  the ubiquitous Mellish was in silent waiting to open the door wider for them,  to close it, and to stand at attention for orders.</p>
  <p>Haydock  perceived the man was a bodyservant of his master rather than a mere butler.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  now,&#8221; Vincent said, &#8220;we will again seek my own private room, and settle the business.  After that, I trust we shall all sleep contented and serene. Come, Anne, we  want your advice and opinions.&#8221; Miss Vincent joined them, and as they passed  into Homer Vincent&#8217;s Tower room, Mellish, looking a little regretful, returned  to his domestic duties.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky3"></a>Chapter 3 <br>
Rosemary</b></h2>
  <p>&#8220;That  man up there is a queer bird,&#8221; Mellish declared to his wife, as he joined her  in the kitchen.</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  how?&#8221; Mrs. Mellish inquired, with slight interest.</p>
  <p>The  main kitchen at Greatlarch was a spacious room with walls of pure white marble.  Spotless all its appointments and speckless Mrs. Mellish had them kept.</p>
  <p>Of  a truth she dwelt in marble halls, and having plenty of vassals and serfs at  her side, she secured the immaculate tidiness in which her soul delighted, and  which, incidentally, Mr. Vincent exacted.</p>
  <p>No  oversight of Susan Mellish was necessary. Cook she was, but also she was queen  of her own domain and life below stairs went on with no more friction or  dissension than above. In the household, Homer Vincent&#8217;s motto was: &#8220;Peace at  Any Price,&#8221; and if an underling disturbed it, there was a rapid substitution.</p>
  <p>Nor  was there any ripple in the smooth-flowing current of the family life. Homer  Vincent saw to that. Not that the man was domineering. On the contrary, he was  a loving and kind brother and uncle. His tastes were simple, even though  luxurious. He asked only smooth-running household machinery and no interference  in his own pursuits.</p>
  <p>Anne  Vincent was nominally housekeeper, and indeed she kept up a careful oversight,  but Susan Mellish was so thoughtful, so capable, so meticulously watchful of  details there was little or nothing for Miss Anne to do.</p>
  <p>The  whole household worshipped the master, and he repaid them by liberal wages and  comfortable living.</p>
  <p>The  servants&#8217; quarters included delightful sitting-rooms and dining-room, and their  sleeping-rooms were most pleasant and beautifully appointed.</p>
  <p>A  feature of the house was Homer Vincent&#8217;s own suite. Above his Tower room on the  first floor was his smoking-room on the second floor. Back of this followed his  bedroom and elaborate bath. Next, his library, with large open terrace that in  winter became a sun parlor.</p>
  <p>These  rooms, of rarest marbles and woods, with French panels of paintings, mirrors,  and rich brocades, were appointed in perfect taste. No gimcrackery ornaments,  but dignified furniture and a few fine paintings and vases.</p>
  <p>The  library was a joy. Comfort and beauty of the highest degree were combined with  utilitarian bookracks and tables.</p>
  <p>These  rooms ran along the whole east side of the house, ending with the library and  terrace, which looked down toward the Temple as well as off to the east.</p>
  <p>They  were directly above the lower Tower room, the dining-room and breakfast-room  and the family living-room. The other side was taken up by the reception room,  the great organ wing, and, back of that, the drawing-room. Between the two  sides were the wide entrance hall, and the wonderful Atrium.</p>
  <p>Above  the Atrium, at the south end, was Miss Vincent&#8217;s room, on a mezzanine floor,  and above that, on a second mezzanine, was John Haydock&#8217;s room.</p>
  <p>The  floor above held six large guest rooms and the servants&#8217; bedrooms were higher  still. However, electric elevators did away with the discomforts of stair  climbing, and the many floors, cellars, and sub-cellars were easy of access.</p>
  <p>And  the two Mellishes, with Miss Anne watchfully observing, held the reins of  government of this establishment, and so great was their efficiency, so true  their system and method, that a jar of any sort was exceedingly rare, and, because  of its rarity, was fully and promptly forgiven by Homer Vincent.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  a queer bird,&#8221; Mellish repeated, shaking his head. &#8220;He&#8217;s that dark, now.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Dark?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  heard me! Yes, I said dark. Dark complected, dark eyes, dark hair, dark hands,  and dark clothes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  dressed up?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  but that isn&#8217;t it, he&#8217;s almost dark enough to be a Creolian.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mellish  was a good butler, but made an occasional slip in his diction. One can&#8217;t know  everything.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Susan, he&#8217;s not our sort, and I know it. He&#8217;s peculiar,&#8212;that&#8217;s what he  is,&#8212;peculiar.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So&#8217;s  the master.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah,  that&#8217;s different. The Vincent peculiarities are of the right sort. This man,  now,&#8212;well, Susan, he was so took up with the place, he could scarce eat his  dinner.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Small  wonder. The place is a fair marvel to those who&#8217;ve not seen it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  isn&#8217;t that. I&#8217;ve seen guests before, who were overwhellumed by it. But this  chap,&#8212;he, why he had an appraising glance for it,&#8212;yes, sir, appraising,&#8212;that&#8217;s  the word.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mellish,  you&#8217;re daft. Appraising, was he? Like he meant to buy it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Susan&#8217;s  ironic scorn would have withered any one but her husband.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Susan,  you&#8217;re a witch. That&#8217;s it exactly. Not that he meant such a thing, he&#8217;s a poor  man. I&#8217;m thinking,&#8212;but that was the way he looked at it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Drop  him, Mellish. You&#8217;ve no sense tonight. Are you dismissed?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.  Mr. Vincent said he&#8217;d not need me more. They&#8217;re shut in the Tower room, Miss  Anne and all. They&#8217;re talking business. I can&#8217;t make that felly out.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did  he look sinister?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  a woman you are for the word, Susan! No, it wasn&#8217;t that,&#8212;he looked  more&#8212;er&#8212;determined,&#8212;yes, that&#8217;s what that man is,&#8212;determined.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Determination  can&#8217;t move the master. I&#8217;m bound he&#8217;ll be a match for anybody&#8217;s determination.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  it isn&#8217;t a clash of wills&#8212;or that. But there&#8217;s a matter between them of some  sort,&#8212;and Miss Anne&#8217;s in it, too.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you&#8217;re eaten alive with curiosity, that&#8217;s what you are, man! Now, get about  your business. And see to it the plumber is ordered in the morning. There&#8217;s a  trickle in the cold storage room sink,&#8212;it only needs a washer,&#8212;and the hothouse  hamper didn&#8217;t come today,&#8212;send Dickson to the station for it at sunup&#8212;and be  sure to speak to Carson about his flirting with Francine&#8212;it won&#8217;t do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>As  she talked, Susan was busily engaged in mixing and kneading the breakfast  rolls. This was a duty that could be entrusted to no lesser artist in baking,  for Susan&#8217;s rolls were nothing short of perfection, but it required all her  care and attention to keep them so.</p>
  <p>In  upon this engrossed couple drifted Francine, the pert little French maid, who,  though Miss Anne&#8217;s exclusive property, also looked after Rosemary now and then.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  man!&#8221; she exclaimed, with a shrug of her slender shoulders, &#8220;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, but he is the beast!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  did you see him?&#8221; and Mellish whirled on her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There,  there, now, old man, don&#8217;t lose any temper! Miss Anne rang for me to get her a  scarf. They&#8217;re all in the Tower room, and they&#8217;re talking most&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Angrily?&#8221;  demanded Susan, whose curiosity was more aroused than she would admit to her  husband.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  not so much that,&#8212;as,&#8212;oh,&#8212;la, la,&#8212;excitement,&#8212;all talking at  once,&#8212;argument&#8212;see?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  are they talking about?&#8221; This from Mellish,&#8212;who asked to know.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  I can&#8217;t say. When I entered all converse stopped. But I could see  the&#8212;atmosphere, the attitudes,&#8212;and the dark man&#8212;oh, he is a terror! Such a low  voice&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  you couldn&#8217;t hear him through the closed door!&#8221; and Mellish glared at her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;<i>Non, Monsieur!</i> Are you not desolate that  I could not?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pretty  Francine was a saucy piece and dearly loved to ballyrag the dignified butler.  But both the Mellishes liked her, though they kept a wary eye on her coquettish  ways with certain servants of the other sex.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  he threatening them?&#8221; Susan asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  quite that&#8212;but&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you know absolutely nothing at all of what is going on!&#8221; Mellish spoke sharply.  &#8220;You&#8217;re only pretending you do. Stop discussing your betters and get about your  work.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  no work to do until Miss Anne wishes to retire. She will ring for me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  go and read your book. Or get some sewing. But don&#8217;t you dare go outside the  door!&#8221; Thus Susan admonished her, knowing full well the girl&#8217;s secret intention  of slipping out for a few moments to join Carson, the chauffeur, in a stolen  interview.</p>
  <p>So  Francine dawdled about until the bell rang and then presented her demure self  at the door of the Tower room.</p>
  <p>Apparently  the matter, whatever it was, had been most amicably settled, for the three were  smiling and contented looking as Francine scanned their faces.</p>
  <p>John  Haydock was a dark man,&#8212;not like a Creole at all, but merely markedly a  brunette. His otherwise unnoticeable face wore a look of satisfaction, and as  he stepped out into the hall, he had again that expression that could, perhaps,  be called appraising. Yet small wonder, for his deep and enthusiastic interest  in the house led him to examine its various beauties and marvels, and few could  do so without involuntary thought of the great outlay involved.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  will go with my sister to her room,&#8221; Vincent was saying, &#8220;and you must amuse  yourself a few moments. Then I will rejoin you for a good-night cigar, and then  we will ourselves retire early.&#8221;</p>
  <p>As  was his nightly custom, Homer Vincent escorted his sister to her room. Francine  followed, and paused at the door, with her usual discretion.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come  on in, Francine,&#8221; Vincent decreed. &#8220;I&#8217;m not chatting with Miss Anne tonight.  Get to rest, dear, and try to forget this whole matter. As you know, I&#8217;m only  anxious to do what is wise and right. You shall cast the final decision as to  all details and tomorrow we will draw up contracts and all that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  good you are, Homer; and though it was a long confab I do not feel so very  tired. Fix my powder, dear, and go back to Mr. Johnson. He is a&#8212;not quite our  sort,&#8212;is he, Homer?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  quite, dear,&#8212;but he is a good business man, I judge, and he seems honest.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Miss  Vincent required a small dose of opiate each night, and fearing lest she should  mistake the quantity prescribed, or that Francine might be careless, Homer  Vincent himself each night measured out the portion for her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  you are,&#8221; he said, as he carefully gauged the dose. &#8220;Give it to her when she&#8217;s  ready, Francine. Good night, Anne, dear.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He  left his sister in Francine&#8217;s capable hands and went down to rejoin his guest.  It was a mark of respect, if not of liking, that he took John Haydock up to his  own library for their smoke.</p>
  <p>Though  sybaritic in many ways, Vincent did not employ a valet. His preference was to  have Mellish arrange his bedroom and night things, and then to retire by  himself whenever it pleased him to do so. Like his sister, he was a poor  sleeper, and often prowled round the house, upstairs and down, during many of  the small hours.</p>
  <p>On  the soft rugs his footfalls disturbed nobody, or if they did, no one was  alarmed, so, in this, as in all other matters, Vincent pleased himself.</p>
  <p>On  this night, when at last he was alone in his own bedroom he bethought himself  of some matters he wished to attend to, that necessitated his going downstairs  to his private room. He had not yet begun to undress, and as he went down the  stairs and through the hall, where a dim light burned all night, he met the  night watchman, Hoskins. This was by no means an unusual occurrence, for  Hoskins came on every night at midnight, and made certain prescribed routes  through the premises.</p>
  <p>Vincent  gave the man a pleasant nod and went on his way. Though this Tower room was  sacred to his use, it was by no means kept locked or difficult of access.  Indeed, the door usually stood open, though in the room itself were two wall  safes, concealed by decorative hangings and also a secret panel which was so  cleverly hidden as to be perhaps impossible of discovery.</p>
  <p>It  is at this point that Rosemary comes into this story.</p>
  <p>She  comes in a motor-car, out of which she steps softly, as the car reaches the  wooded part of the driveway.</p>
  <p>Unafraid,  because she knows Hoskins is not far away, and because this is by no means her  first experience of the sort, she makes her way silently toward the house.</p>
  <p>She  cannot be seen gliding through the shadows, and she takes good care she shall  not be heard.</p>
  <p>Reaching  the stone arch of the entrance, she slips through, and pauses to reconnoitre.  No lights are on save those in her uncle&#8217;s suite, and one in his Tower room  below.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Aha,&#8221;  thinks the sagacious young woman, &#8220;up yet,&#8212;the old Prowler, is he? Well, we&#8217;ll  see what we&#8217;ll do about it. I don&#8217;t want to hang around long tonight!&#8221;</p>
  <p>As  may be gathered, Rosemary had overstayed her allowed time, and greatly desired  to get into the house and up to her room unnoticed. For Homer Vincent was a bit  strict about his niece&#8217;s behavior, and if truth be told, his restrictions were  rather necessary and all for Rosemary&#8217;s good.</p>
  <p>Not  that the girl was wilful or wayward, but at twenty-one, the hour of midnight  seems to strike very early in the evening, and usually just when the fun is at  its height. Yet it was a Medo-Persian law that Rosemary should be in the house  by twelve o&#8217;clock&#8212;and to give her just due, she almost always was.</p>
  <p>But  tonight had been a gay and pleasant party, and she had been tempted to remain  beyond the hour.</p>
  <p>The  afternoon&#8217;s portent of snow had been fulfilled, and though the squall had been  short, it was severe, and now, though it was not snowing, there was enough  fallen snow and cold dampness to make any tarrying outside exceedingly  uncomfortable.</p>
  <p>So  Rosemary crept to the great window that was at the southern exposure of the  Tower room, and peeped in at her uncle.</p>
  <p>Wrapped  in her fur motor coat, a brown toque spilling its plumes down one side of her  pretty, eager face, Rosemary shivered as she picked her way through the soft  wet snow, but nodded in satisfaction as she saw her uncle&#8217;s very evident  absorption in whatever matter claimed his attention.</p>
  <p>About  to turn away, she paused a moment to notice him as he opened a secret panel.  She had known of the existence of this, but had never before seen it opened.</p>
  <p>Fascinated,  she saw him searching among its contents, though she could discern nothing  definitely. The window had a thin film of curtain material, and she really saw  little beyond the moving silhouette and the furniture of the room. Moreover, it  suddenly came to her that she was rudely spying upon another&#8217;s movements in a  way she had no right to do, and blushing to herself in the darkness, she turned  quickly away.</p>
  <p>Rosy  from the icy air, her cheeks glowed; and curled up by the dampness, her  red-brown hair made little tendrils that blew across her face. She smuggled  into her fur collar and even welcomed the warmth of the long russet plume that  fell over one ear.</p>
  <p>Carefully  she slipped back again to the great front door, which she well knew Hoskins had  not yet locked for the night. Turning the knob slowly, the opening door made no  sound, and in a moment Rosemary was inside.</p>
  <p>And  it was just at that moment that Homer Vincent elected to return to his bedroom.  But the girl quickly stepped behind one of the great columns, and stood in its  protecting shadow while her uncle went up the stairs.</p>
  <p>She  thought he limped a little more than usual, as he sometimes did when tired, and  a wave of regret swept through her tender heart that she had disobeyed his  orders.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  never do it again,&#8221; she resolved. &#8220;Uncle Homer is too good to me for me to  slight his wishes. I&#8217;m a wicked old thing!&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  a healthy, girlish hunger was more in evidence with her just then than her  feeling of conscience-stricken remorse, and she turned her silent steps toward  the dining-room. Here Mellish usually left for her some tempting bit of food on  a tray in a cold cupboard, and investigating, Rosemary found a little mold of  jellied chicken, with two buttered finger-rolls and a plate of fruit.</p>
  <p>Snapping  on a small table light, she sat down to enjoy her little feast.</p>
  <p>Hoskins,  passing, looked in and smiled at her. It was not the first time he had smiled  at such a scene.</p>
  <p>Soon  Rosemary finished her lunch, and gathering up her fur coat, went softly  upstairs.</p>
  <p>She  paused at the door of her Aunt&#8217;s room. Sometimes, if Miss Anne were awake, she  liked to have Rosemary come in and tell her of the party. But the sound of  heavy asthmatic breathing proved Miss Anne asleep, and the girl went on to her  own rooms.</p>
  <p>Her  boudoir was the Tower room over the reception room and her bedroom was next  back of that. Everything was in readiness and it was but a short time before  Rosemary slumbered as soundly, if not as audibly, as her aunt.</p>
  <p>Hoskins  went his rounds stolidly. He was a good and faithful watchman, largely because  he had not the brains required for any higher calling. His route he  meticulously followed, punching his time clocks as required, and throwing the  flash of his electric lantern in dark corners.</p>
  <p>His  orders took him outside and around the house as well as through the lower  floors. The upper floors he was not required to patrol.</p>
  <p>As  usual, he found no disturbing element and trudged around his appointed path  like a patient ox. He had long since ceased to wonder at the beauty and  grandeur of Greatlarch,&#8212;to him it was merely the home of his employer.</p>
  <p>He  repeatedly tracked the soft wet snow in his journeys round the house, removing  his damp overshoes when making his inside rounds.</p>
  <p>His  shift ended at seven o&#8217;clock, and at that hour he gladly went into the kitchen,  where a hot breakfast awaited him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nasty  mess underfoot,&#8221; he confided to the maid who served him. &#8220;Don&#8217;t go out today,  my dear, lessen you have to.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  sun&#8217;s out bright,&#8221; she demurred, looking from the window.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  and that makes it all the wuss. Meltin&#8217; an&#8217; thawin&#8217;&#8212;sloppy weather, my dear.&#8221;</p>
  <p>As  Hoskins&#8217; &#8220;my dears&#8221; were matters of habit rather than real affection, the girl  paid but slight attention and went about her business.</p>
  <p>The  routine of breakfast preparations went on. The Mellishes appeared on the stroke  of seven-thirty, as was their wont. They gravely inspected the work of their  underlings and then set about their own superior duties.</p>
  <p>All  was in readiness at eight, though it was an entirely uncertain question as to  when the family would appear.</p>
  <p>They  were subject to moods or whims, sometimes having breakfast together and again  having trays carried to any rooms that pleased them.</p>
  <p>Mellish  opined, however, that this morning would see the family congregated in the  breakfast-room because of the presence of a guest.</p>
  <p>And  shortly after eight Homer Vincent appeared.</p>
  <p>Though  always impatient at a delay not of his own causing, he showed no irritation and  said to Mellish he would wait for Mr. Johnson to come down.</p>
  <p>Then  Rosemary appeared. Such a pretty Rosemary, her brown eyes smiling, her animated  little face showing a frank curiosity.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good  morning,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;who&#8217;s here? Francine says there&#8217;s a guest.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  but he isn&#8217;t down yet. A Mr. Johnson, who came to see Antan and myself on some  business affair.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Rosemary  had a funny little way of pronouncing Aunt Anne, and as it sounded like Antan,  the nickname had become habitual.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nice?&#8221;  she asked, briefly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rather,&#8221;  her uncle returned. &#8220;Good business chap, fairly good looking, decent manners,  but no particular charm.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t  sound much,&#8221; Rosemary observed; &#8220;may I begin my breakfast?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  let&#8217;s wait a few moments. I told him eight o&#8217;clock, he&#8217;ll surely be down in a  few moments.&#8221; And then Francine burst into the room, breathless and wild-eyed  with wonder.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  what do you think?&#8221; she cried, quite forgetting her formalities. &#8220;Miss Anne&#8212;I  cannot rouse her and her door is bolted!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent looked at her coldly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Remember  your manners, Francine,&#8221; he said in a tone of reproach. &#8220;Your information does  not warrant such carelessness of address. Is Miss Vincent still sleeping?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  just it, sir, I do not know. Always I hear her bell by eight o&#8217;clock at latest.  Now, I go and tap, but she answers not,&#8212;nor do I hear her moving about inside  her chamber.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did  you not go in?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  the door is locked,&#8212;bolted on the inside. Always she bolts it at night, but the  bolt is always off before this time in the day!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Francine  was a trim little figure, her plain black dress and white cap and apron well  becoming her. She was excitable, but this time her concern was deeper than mere  excited curiosity. Plainly, she was alarmed.</p>
  <p>Vincent  saw this, and spoke more kindly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Run  up again, Francine, and rattle the door. I will go with you, if you wish.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  do, sir, I did rattle at the door, and there was no response. And I did not  hear her breathing&#8212;she&#8212;she breathes deeply, you know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>This  was a discreet allusion to Miss Anne&#8217;s asthma, which at times was distinctly in  evidence.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Francine,  I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re needlessly excited; however, Mellish will go up and see&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  butler turned slowly toward the door, and Vincent said:</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  matter, Mellish, I&#8217;ll go myself,&#8221; and then, noting Rosemary&#8217;s frightened  glance, he added, &#8220;we&#8217;ll all go.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He  led the way to Miss Anne&#8217;s bedroom, the great south room on the mezzanine above  the hall.</p>
  <p>The  short flight of steps ended in a broad landing, the bedroom door in its center.  The door had been a heavy one of carved antique oak. But Miss Anne had disliked  it, saying it was like a prison door. So her brother had had it removed and  replaced by a light swing door, covered with rose-colored velour and studded  round its edges with brass-headed nails.</p>
  <p>This  door had a small bolt on the inside, but it was only to insure privacy, not at  all a protection from possible marauders.</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent tapped at this door, calling &#8220;Anne&#8212;Anne, dear!&#8221;</p>
  <p>There  was no response and Vincent pressed his ear to the door.</p>
  <p>The  others watched, breathlessly, and Rosemary shrank back in nameless dread while  Francine fluttered and gave voice to voluble French expletives.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Be  quiet, Francine!&#8221; Vincent commanded, and Mrs. Mellish, who had joined the  group, gave the French girl an admonitory shake.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  shall break in the door,&#8221; Vincent said; &#8220;it&#8217;s a flimsy thing. Stand back,  Rosemary. Mellish, push here, as I strike.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  combined strength of the two men easily forced the door, and Mellish fell into  the room first. Vincent, following, hurried to his sister&#8217;s bed. The beautiful  room, built for the first mistress of the house, had a raised dais, a sort of  low platform for the bed to stand on. Also, from the ceiling depended an  elaborate cornice that surrounded the space designed for the bed and from which  hung voluminous curtains of silk brocade.</p>
  <p>In  the shadowy gloom of these curtains lay Miss Anne, and as her brother reached  the bedside and pushed away the hangings to see his sister, he cried out in a  horrified voice, &#8220;Keep back! Mellish, keep back Miss Rosemary!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Waving  a warning hand at them, Vincent leaned over the still form and then turned  round, his hands clenched and horror on his face.</p>
  <p>&#8220;My  sister is dead!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;She&#8212;she&#8212;oh, take that child away!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  will not be taken away, Uncle Homer,&#8221; Rosemary cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a baby! Let me  know the truth! What has happened?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Breaking  away from the restraining arms of Mrs. Mellish, unheeding Mellish&#8217;s effort to  stop her, she ran to the bedside and herself looked inside the long curtains.</p>
  <p>She  saw a white, dead face, staring eyes and a nightdress stained with crimson  drops.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky4"></a>Chapter 4 <br>
A Mysterious Death</b></h2>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Antan!&#8221; Rosemary cried, starting back in horror. &#8220;Oh, Uncle Homer, what is it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent  put his arm round the terrified girl and they both gazed on the dreadful sight.  Both were white-faced and trembling, and though Homer Vincent strove hard for  composure, it was a few moments before he could even speak.</p>
  <p>Then,  still holding Rosemary close, he spoke to the others.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mellish,&#8221;  he said, &#8220;Miss Vincent is dead. She has been killed. That&#8217;s all my brain can take  in at present. I am stunned&#8212;I am heartbroken,&#8221;&#8212;and the man&#8217;s enforced calm gave  way as he sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.</p>
  <p>Then  Mrs. Mellish stepped nearer to the bed, gave one glance at the awful sight and  turned shuddering away.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Leave  the room,&#8221; she said to the trembling Francine. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be flying into hysterics  in a minute. I know you. Leave the room.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  shall I do? Where shall I go?&#8221; the French girl cried. &#8220;My place is here&#8212;beside  my mistress.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She&#8217;s  right,&#8221; and Mellish showed surprised approval of Francine&#8217;s self-control. &#8220;You  stay in this room, Francine, and don&#8217;t you get to blubbering. Keep your head,  and you can be of good service. Mr. Vincent, shall I call a doctor?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  yes,&#8212;do, Mellish. Poor Anne is dead, but&#8212;yes, I&#8217;d like you to call Doctor  McGee. And&#8212;and Mellish, I suppose we ought to notify&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  nothing, sir, until Doctor McGee comes. He&#8217;ll know just what to do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mellish  departed to telephone the Doctor, and Homer Vincent, lifting his bowed head,  rose and began to assume his usual place at the helm.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t seem to think,&#8221; he said, as he brushed his hand across his brow. &#8220;Rosemary,  who could have done such a thing? Who could harm such a dear lady?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I don&#8217;t know, Uncle,&#8212;did&#8212;did somebody kill her?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Unless  she took her own life&#8212;she wouldn&#8217;t do that, would she, Rosemary?&#8221;</p>
  <p>It  was strange the way the strong and self sufficient man seemed to appeal to his  niece. Mrs. Mellish regarded him solicitously. She had never before seen Homer  Vincent troubled.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  now, sir,&#8221; she said, in kindly fashion, &#8220;you can do nothing for the poor lady  now. Come down to the breakfast-room, sir, and take a cup of coffee and a bite  of breakfast. Come now, Miss Rosemary, let Melly fix you out.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  girl often called Mrs. Mellish thus, to distinguish her from her husband.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221;  exclaimed Vincent, suddenly, &#8220;that man, that Mr. Johnson! He must be already  down in the breakfast-room, and no one to look after him! Run down to him,  Melly.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come  you, too, sir. And Miss Rosemary. The man must be told,&#8212;best you should do it,  Mr. Vincent.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  and Homer Vincent rose, with a determination to do his part, however hard it  might be. &#8220;Rosemary, will you come with me, or will you have your breakfast  taken to your rooms?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  go with you, Uncle. Perhaps I can help. Who is Mr. Johnson?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s  a man who came yesterday on business, and I asked him to stay the night. I  asked him to stay on, but I hope he&#8217;ll go this morning.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  he surely will,&#8212;when he hears&#8212;Uncle Homer, I can&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; she looked  again at the silent, pitiful figure on the bed, where Francine was lightly  laying a fine handkerchief over the face of poor Anne Vincent.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  all right,&#8221; Vincent said, slowly, &#8220;but don&#8217;t touch the body otherwise,  Francine. It&#8212;it isn&#8217;t right to do so.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir,&#8221; and the maid nodded, comprehendingly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come  now, sir,&#8221; Mrs. Mellish urged him, and with a backward glance of grief and  bewilderment, Vincent followed Rosemary from the room.</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Johnson was not in the breakfast-room. &#8220;He has overslept,&#8221; Vincent said,  glancing at the clock. &#8220;For I told him breakfast at eight and he said he would  be prompt. I shouldn&#8217;t send for him, otherwise,&#8212;but&#8212;as things are, don&#8217;t you  think, Melly, you&#8217;d better call him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir; shall I tell him&#8212;what&#8217;s happened, sir?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;no,&#8212;well,  tell him that there is trouble in the household, you might say sudden  illness&#8212;oh, I don&#8217;t care what you say, Melly, but can&#8217;t you hint that he&#8217;d  better go right after breakfast?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir, surely,&#8221; and Mrs. Mellish went on her somber errand.</p>
  <p>Uncle  and niece took their places in the bright and cheery breakfast-room. The  weather had cleared, and the sun shone with a glowing warmth as of Indian  Summer.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Eat  your breakfast, Rosemary,&#8221; Vincent said, &#8220;that will best help you to meet the  trying times before you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Habit  is a compelling thing, and Homer Vincent went about his own breakfast  methodically, as usual, chipping his egg with his customary care and attention.  It was characteristic of the man that even in the nervous stress and strain of  the occasion, he gratified his physical appetite with apparent relish. Yet this  was purely a matter of habit, and indeed, he was almost unaware of what he was  eating or even that he was eating.</p>
  <p>The  girl, however, could eat nothing. Her excitement was so great, her nerves so  wrought up, that she found it impossible to swallow a mouthful.</p>
  <p>&#8220;At  least drink a cup of coffee, dear child,&#8221; her uncle urged, as he solicitously  proffered cream and sugar.</p>
  <p>At  this moment Mrs. Mellish returned, her round face showing a look of amazement.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  gentleman isn&#8217;t in his room, sir,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  he&#8217;s out in the grounds,&#8221; interrupted Vincent, impatiently. &#8220;Go and hunt him,  Mellish.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Now,  Mrs. Mellish&#8217;s place wasn&#8217;t in the dining-rooms at all at breakfast, a maid  assisted the butler. But today the maids were demoralized and Melly was trying  to help things along all she could.</p>
  <p>The  news of the tragedy had, of course, flown like wildfire through the servants&#8217;  halls and they were even now in huddled groups in corridors and pantries.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,  Mr. Vincent,&#8221; Melly resumed, &#8220;the gentleman didn&#8217;t sleep in his bed! It hasn&#8217;t  been touched since it was turned down for him last night.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What?&#8221;  Vincent stared at her incredulously.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir; his hat and coat&#8217;s there, but his clothes ain&#8217;t&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  then he&#8217;s spent the whole night prowling round the house. He was daft over it  and hated to go to bed. I left him wandering round the upper floors. I hope he  didn&#8217;t go out on the leads and fall over. What a bother he is! But go and find  him Mrs. Mellish. Get some one to help, if you like,&#8212;but get Mr. Johnson! He&#8217;s  maybe fallen asleep in some Tower room.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Mellish departed and Rosemary asked, &#8220;Who is this man, Uncle?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;An  ordinary person, dear. I never saw him before,&#8212;he came to see me in regard to a  business proposition, and your Aunt and I grew interested and promised to  decide the matter today.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Tears  filled his eyes as he realized there was no today for poor Anne Vincent.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  why wouldn&#8217;t he go to bed?&#8221; Rosemary persisted. &#8220;Do you mean he spent the whole  night wandering round the house?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know, child, but he was mad about the place and most curious to visit  every nook and cranny of it. I showed him about a lot, then, as he seemed  inclined to explore for himself, I told him to do so.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  room did he have?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  south room, above your Aunt&#8217;s. He&#8217;s a decent chap, but not quite our own sort.  Ah, Mellish, did you get the doctor?&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  butler shook his head. &#8220;No, sir, he&#8217;s away on an important case, out of town,  sir. Shall I call some one else?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I don&#8217;t know what to say or do&#8212;&#8221; and Vincent seemed to be at his wits&#8217; end.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  wish I could help you, Uncle,&#8221; Rosemary said, gently; &#8220;you have such an awful  burden to bear. Shall I call Bryce over&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  I am indeed in trouble, Rosemary, but I can bear my own burdens. I ask no help,  at present. But when the time comes, I shall get help&#8212;skilled help&#8212;to solve the  mystery of your aunt&#8217;s death and to bring the murderer to justice.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent&#8217;s  voice rang out sternly and Rosemary marvelled at the fiery depths of his eyes.</p>
  <p>He  seemed to pull himself together anew, and said: &#8220;I think, Mellish, you&#8217;d better  call up the County Physician. He must be notified anyway, and if he gets here  before Doctor McGee, it will do no harm. We must have some medical man, as soon  as we can. Call Doctor Archer&#8212;and then, Mellish, for Heaven&#8217;s sake find that  man Johnson. It&#8217;s unpardonable for him to act like this!&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  calm, even-tempered man was getting nervously upset. Nor could it be wondered  at, for in all his life before equability and composure had never deserted him.  But never had there been such provocation. For a man who lived but for his own  pleasure, whose every thought and act were definitely directed toward the  achievement of his own comfort and happiness, for a man like this to be brought  suddenly face to face with a tragedy that tore his very heartstrings was enough  of itself to shatter his nerves.</p>
  <p>But  when, in addition, he must meet the terrible situation, must even assume  direction of the horrible events consequent upon it, must stifle and suppress  his own grief in order to preserve sufficient calm to take charge of the  proceedings,&#8212;this was overwhelming, and Homer Vincent almost sank beneath the  blow.</p>
  <p>But  he was made of strong fiber, he was possessed of an indomitable will and  ability to cope with an emergency.</p>
  <p>Conquering  his jumping nerves, he said: &#8220;We must all help, Rosemary. You must try to take  your Aunt&#8217;s place so far as you can; look after the household matters, assist  Melly, and be ready to see visitors,&#8212;for as soon as the news spreads there will  be many callers.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Rosemary  shuddered. &#8220;Must I see them, Uncle? I&#8217;d hate it&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Some  we can refuse to see. But many must be met,&#8212;and I thought, dear child, you&#8217;d do  that to help me. I have many painful matters to see to myself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course, I will, then,&#8212;and&#8212;if I could have Bryce&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Rosemary, just this once,&#8212;I beg of you, don&#8217;t bring up that subject&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent  looked so distressed that his niece said quickly, &#8220;No, I won&#8217;t,&#8212;but&#8212;if you only  would&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>She  was interrupted by the return of Mellish. Having summoned Doctor Archer, he had  himself taken up the command of the search for the missing guest.</p>
  <p>&#8220;We  can&#8217;t find that man anywhere,&#8221; he declared, looking completely mystified. &#8220;As  my wife says, he didn&#8217;t sleep in his bed, and what&#8217;s more, it doesn&#8217;t look to  me as if he was in his room at all after dinner. There&#8217;s nothing put about, no  chair out of place, no cigar ashes or that,&#8212;his night things all undisturbed,  just as the maid laid them out. It&#8217;s mighty queer, sir,&#8212;ay, it&#8217;s mighty queer!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;His  hat and coat are up there&#8212;in his room?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  he hasn&#8217;t left the place,&#8212;then he must be somewhere about.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir,&#8212;it would seem so, sir. But he isn&#8217;t,&#8212;he just isn&#8217;t. We&#8217;ve looked  everywhere. We&#8217;ve called out, and we&#8217;ve rang bells, and we&#8217;ve searched the  whole place. He&#8217;s nowhere about&#8212;alive.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent  started at the last word.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  do you mean?&#8221; he cried.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing,  sir, only whoever done for poor Miss Anne may have done for him, too.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  so,&#8221; and Homer Vincent dropped his face in his hands as if this new phase of  trouble was more than he could bear.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mellish,&#8221;  he said, at last, &#8220;I can&#8217;t take it all in. It&#8217;s too much for me. I must have  help&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Uncle Homer,&#8221; and Rosemary spoke involuntarily, &#8220;if you&#8217;d only let Bryce&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hush,  Rosemary, don&#8217;t add to my troubles. No, much as I hate it, much as I dread it,  I see I must call in the police. We&#8217;d better wait, I think, until Doctor Archer  comes, but I am sure he will send for them at once. It is inevitable.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  police! Oh, no, Uncle Homer!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  fear it must be so, Rosemary. And, dear, until they come is the only time we  may have to ourselves. I mean, once they start investigations, the whole house  will be upset and they will be entirely in charge.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  awful! Must we have them?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  he spoke abruptly. &#8220;Oh, Rosemary, I can&#8217;t stand this another minute! I shall go  to the organ,&#8212;Mellish, when the Doctor comes let me know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>No  one was surprised, a few moments later, to hear the long, low, mournful notes  that pealed through the stricken house. It was the habit of Homer Vincent to  find solace in music if anything troubled him, but never before had his  troubles been more than some slight, momentary disturbance of a trifling sort.</p>
  <p>And  as he played, he recovered his poise, he regained his courage, he felt enabled  to cope with the, trials that he must endure.</p>
  <p>One  who knew him could judge from the deep, dirge-like strains or the troubled  crashing chords, which phase of the tragedy was at the moment uppermost in his  mind, the death of his sister, or the imminent horror of the consequent and  necessary investigations.</p>
  <p>The  servants were in a state of chaotic excitement. The two Mellishes had their  hands full to keep quiet and decorum in their domain.</p>
  <p>Francine,  however, showed her best side, and proved that she had a fine and efficient  nature.</p>
  <p>She  put Miss Anne&#8217;s rooms in order, weeping silently as she disposed of the  clothing the poor lady would never wear again. She was careful to disturb  nothing that might be useful as evidence, for Francine fully realized the  gravity of the case, and wanted to help, if only by letting things alone.</p>
  <p>She  found Rosemary in her room, weeping her very heart out in an agony of woe.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Poor  child,&#8221; thought Francine, &#8220;not a soul to go to for sympathy or comfort!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mayn&#8217;t  I send for someone, Miss Rosemary?&#8221; she offered. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like Miss Eaton,  or&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Francine,&#8221; the girl looked at her fiercely; &#8220;you know well there&#8217;s only one  person I want to see,&#8212;and I&#8217;m not allowed to see him!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221;  and Francine nodded, understandingly: &#8220;but don&#8217;t stir up your uncle about that.  He&#8217;s got all he can stagger under.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  have I!&#8221; Rosemary cried out. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you suppose I&#8217;m as much broken up by Antan&#8217;s  death as Uncle Homer is? Don&#8217;t you suppose I want somebody to comfort and love  me even more than he does? He has his music&#8212;that always quiets and soothes him,  while I&#8212;I have nothing&#8212;nobody!&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  lovely face, torn with emotion and grief, was mutinous; the scarlet lips were  trembling, while the white, tear-stained cheeks and the stormy eyes showed  rebellion seething in Rosemary&#8217;s heart.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  wait,&#8221; counseled Francine. &#8220;All is now so&#8212;so excitement, so&#8212;tornado!&#8221; In  moments of stress, Francine forgot her English. &#8220;After a little, after some  small few of days, the trouble will clear somewhat,&#8212;the suddenness will be  forgotten,&#8212;Monsieur will find himself, and, who knows, mademoiselle, all may be  well for you&#8212;and yours.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Francine  had never before spoken with such familiarity, but Rosemary did not resent it.  She was too stunned, too helpless, to resent anything.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell  me about that man, Francine,&#8221; she said; &#8220;did you see him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  when Miss Anne called me to get her a wrap. Oh, he was dreadful!&#8221; A French  shrug betokened how dreadful.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  how? In what way?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  black, so sneering,&#8212;so dictating,&#8212;yet not a gentleman.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  in the world did he want? I wish Uncle Homer would tell me about him. Where do  you suppose he is, Francine?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is not hard to guess.&#8221; The French girl smiled a sardonic little grin,&#8212;like a  wise sibyl.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  what do you mean? What do you think?&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  then came a peremptory summons for both girls to appear below.</p>
  <p>Doctor  Archer had arrived, and, almost simultaneously, the local police.</p>
  <p>The  Law was represented by Lane, the Sheriff of the county, and two eager-eyed  detectives, who were so flabbergasted by the beauty and grandeur of their  surroundings that they seemed able to detect little else.</p>
  <p>Doctor  Archer, the County Medical Examiner, was in charge, and was firing questions  right and left. He had never before had such an opportunity to stand in the  limelight and was making the most of it.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  lady was murdered,&#8221; he informed his hearers, in a deep bass voice; &#8220;most foully  murdered. She was stabbed with some sort of dagger or long-bladed knife.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Carving-knife?&#8221;  asked Brewster, one of the detectives, and Rosemary smothered a shriek.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  necessarily,&#8221; replied Archer, &#8220;a long-bladed jackknife might have been used, or  a regular dagger. Anyway, it required a long blade, for it went in her chest  and pierced her heart. It was just one swift, deft blow, and death was  instantaneous. Now, Sheriff, what do you make of that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Murderous  intent,&#8221; answered Lane promptly. &#8220;Murderer concealed in the room, like as not,  all afternoon.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah,  h&#8217;m, and how did he get out?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Door  locked?&#8221; and Lane looked up quickly. He had not heard all the details yet.</p>
  <p>They  were gathered in the living-room, a delightful room on the first floor, back of  the dining-room. It looked out on the terrace, and on over the lagoon and  fountain to the Greek Temple that was a Mausoleum.</p>
  <p>Lane  was an artist at heart, a lover of the beautiful, and like many other visitors,  he was overcome with the sights about him.</p>
  <p>They  were to visit the room of the tragedy later, but Vincent had requested that the  preliminary inquiries be made in some other place.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  Archer said, &#8220;door locked on the inside.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Windows?&#8221;  asked Brown, the other and lesser detective.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  must look into those things for yourselves,&#8221; Archer said. &#8220;I&#8217;m merely making my  medical report. Then we&#8217;ll get a line on the time and all that and then we&#8217;ll  go upstairs and take a look about.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent cringed at the matter-of-fact tone and the business-like air of the  men, and Rosemary, shocked at the whole proceeding, shivered so that Mrs.  Mellish went and sat by her side and held her hand.</p>
  <p>Grateful  for even this human sympathy, Rosemary forced herself to listen to the  inquiries now being made.</p>
  <p>Francine,  composed and alert, answered readily all that was asked of her.</p>
  <p>So  far as could be gathered, she was the last person known to have seen Miss  Vincent alive.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell  us all about it,&#8221; Brewster said, listening eagerly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s  not much to tell,&#8221; the French maid averred. &#8220;Miss Vincent spent a time after  dinner in the Tower room of Mr. Vincent, her brother. There was also a Mr.  Johnson with them, a dinner guest of the house. Miss Vincent left them and came  up to her room at about half-past ten. Mr. Vincent came with her as he always  does, to say good night and to measure her medicine. After Mr. Vincent had gone  downstairs again, I assisted Miss Vincent to get ready for the bed, and I gave  her her drops, arranged the coverlets, and put out the lights, all but the ones  she wished kept burning. Then I said good night, and left her to herself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  had then gone to bed?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no; it was always her custom to sit up and read for a time. I left her sitting  in her armchair, her reading light at her side, her books on a small table.  Always I leave her thus at night. Then, when she tires of her books, she arises  from her chair, locks her door, puts out her reading light and goes to bed.  This, monsieur, is her invariable routine.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  seemed well, in her usual spirits?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  seemed well, but much er&#8212;preoccupied. As if in deep&#8212;serious thought over  something.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Over  the discussion with her brother and the strange gentleman, perhaps?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  may be. She said no word of what was in her mind.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Was  she irritable? Cross?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss  Vincent was never that. No, she was most courteous and kind, as always, but  deeply thoughtful. When I left her, she said merely &#8216;good night,&#8217; not adding, &#8216;sleep  well, Francine,&#8217; as is most usual.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  this only indicates thoughtfulness, not disturbance or worry,&#8212;eh?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  it seemed to me. Also, she seemed rather satisfied with her thoughts, as if,  after all, the matter was satisfactorily adjusted.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  gathered quite a bit from her manner,&#8221; Archer remarked, dryly.</p>
  <p>Francine  caught his tone and flared up at once.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know&#8212;knew Miss Vincent very well, mon sieur! I knew well her moods and the  phases of her mind. It was not much that I should read her satisfaction from  her air and manner! Surely I could tell that she was contented and not worried  or disturbed! That is not so amazing!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221;  said Archer.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky5"></a>Chapter 5 <br>
Where Was Johnson?</b></h2>
  <p>On  the whole, Francine made a good impression. Though pert and saucy of  appearance, she laid aside all such attitudes now, and seemed desirous only to  be helpful and dutiful.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Snappy  chit, but devoted to her mistress,&#8221; was the way Brewster summed her up in his  mind, and Brown contented himself with musing: &#8220;Full of pep, but honestly  grieved.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Brewster  and Brown were themselves honest, hard-working detectives. Far from brilliant,  woefully inexperienced, they felt that now at last their chance had come, and  they were firmly resolved to make good.</p>
  <p>Brewster  was big and burly, and of a slow-going mind, while Brown was small, wiry, and  active, with what he considered a hair-trigger intellect. They had often  rejoiced in the fact, as they saw it, that they thus complemented one another,  and they felt that their team work would be admirable should they ever get a  chance to try it out. And now their time had come.</p>
  <p>Eagerly  they listened to Archer&#8217;s inquiries, carefully they remembered the answers, and  frequently gave each other astute glances, indicative of great mental activity.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,&#8221;  said Lane, &#8220;let&#8217;s take up next thing we know of Miss Vincent. Did any one hear  any sound from her or from her room during the night?&#8221; All present,&#8212;and several  of the servants had gathered in the doorway,&#8212;declared they had heard no sounds  from Miss Vincent&#8217;s room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  is a night watchman?&#8221; Archer asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  replied Mellish, who saved his master in every way he could. &#8220;But if he had  heard or seen anything unusual, he would have reported it first thing this  morning.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Leave  that for the moment, then. Now, who went first to Miss Vincent&#8217;s door this  morning?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps  I did,&#8221; said Francine.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  do you say perhaps?&#8221; demanded Lane.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because  how can I tell?&#8221; returned Francine, wide-eyed at such stupidity. &#8220;Any one might  have been there before me&#8212;indeed, some one must have been there before me&#8212;the  villain who killed my dear lady.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very  well,&#8221; said Lane, &#8220;go ahead. What time did you go there?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;At  something after eight, monsieur. Always Miss Vincent rings for me earlier than  that,&#8212;about seven-thirty, maybe. This morning she did not do so, and I waited  until eight, then I went and hovered near her door, wondering at her sleeping  so late. I listened closely, and hearing no sound, I ventured to turn the knob,  but the door was locked and would not open. I called softly,&#8212;then louder, and  then, listening intently, I heard no sound of Miss Vincent moving about, and I  feared she was indisposed, and I greatly desired to get in to give her  assistance, if need be.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  did you do?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,  naturally, I ran down the stairs for help. Forgetting my discipline, I ran into  the breakfast room, where were Mr. Vincent and Miss Rosemary, and I told them  of the unusual condition,&#8212;and though not alarmed, Mr. Vincent was concerned,  and with Mellish, we all came upstairs, and broke in the door.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  broke it in?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mellish  and I together,&#8221; Homer Vincent answered for himself. &#8220;The door is a light,  temporary structure; my sister preferred it to the original heavy oak door. We  burst it in,&#8212;in fact, it opened so easily Mellish was thrown to the floor. I  went quickly to my sister&#8217;s bed, and the first glance told me the truth. I saw  in an instant that she had been killed,&#8212;murdered. I admit I almost lost my  consciousness. My senses reeled, and I fell back involuntarily. But I quickly  pulled myself together, for my young niece was present, and forced myself to  lean over the body and discover if life was surely extinct. It was,&#8212;the flesh  was cold to my touch. I ordered Mellish to hold my niece back, as I wanted to  spare her the awful sight. But she insisted on looking at her aunt, and for a  moment we gazed together on the terrible scene. I think there is no more to  tell. Finding I could do nothing for my poor sister, assuring myself that she  was positively beyond human aid, I fear I gave way to selfish grief for a few  moments. Then I roused myself to a sense of duty, and ever since I have been  trying to do what is right and wise in the matter.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I am all unversed in the course the law should take, or the manner of efforts  that should be made to find the murderer and avenge the crime. Will you,  therefore, gentlemen, take the case in charge, and do or advise me to do,  whatever is right and best. Let one thing be understood. The murderer must be  found. Spare no time, pains, or expense. I stand ready to do anything I can,  but as I said, I am ignorant of the proper procedure, and I desire to relegate  the work to more experienced hands.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  think, do you not, Doctor Archer, that the criminal can be found and brought to  justice?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is not quite in my province, Mr. Vincent. The inquiry is my duty, but the real  detective work must be done by men skilled in such things.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Brewster  and Brown looked duly important and capable, but they offered no hint of their  conclusions so far.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  you think, Mr. Vincent,&#8221; Lane asked, in his ponderous way, &#8220;that your sister&#8217;s  death could have been a suicide?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  should say positively not,&#8221; Vincent replied, slowly, &#8220;except for the fact that  she died in a locked room. I can see no way that a murderer could escape and  leave that door locked behind him. Yet, so far from probability is the idea of  suicide, that I am forced to believe it was a murder, however impossible such a  theory may seem. But all this business of theorizing and of deducing and  collecting evidence is so foreign to my nature and to my experience, that I  cannot pretend to decide any such questions.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  weapon was used? Was any found?&#8221; asked Brewster, looking at Vincent.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he replied, looking in his turn at Doctor Archer. &#8220;Did you find  any, Doctor?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221;  and Archer looked stern. &#8220;There was none in evidence. Was any such thing  removed before my arrival?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course not,&#8221; said Vincent; &#8220;who would do such a thing as that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did  you see any knife or dagger, Mellish? or you, Francine?&#8221; Archer asked of the  servants.</p>
  <p>But  every one present denied having seen any weapon of any sort.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,&#8221;  said Brewster, &#8220;it must have been murder.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  the door was locked,&#8221; Brown reminded him, &#8220;so it must have been suicide.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Those  statements are both true, superficially,&#8221; Lane said, &#8220;but since they contradict  each other, either or both may be untrue. One must be. Such points can only be  settled after much more investigation than has yet been made. Shortly we will  adjourn to the scene of the crime and gather what evidence we may up there.  Just now, I&#8217;d like some more information regarding this stranger, this Mr.  Johnson who visited here last night, and who, I understand, is now missing.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  one of the strangest features,&#8221; said Lane. &#8220;Please tell us all about him, Mr.  Vincent.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Rosemary,  who had sat quietly listening to the talk, now showed signs of curiosity. She  wished herself to learn more of this strange visitor, but the conversation  about her aunt had filled her soul only with horror and grief.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  Vincent was of a self-contained, self-repressed nature. Though her uncle was  kind, even generous to her in many ways, yet their tastes were not congenial,  and their ways more utterly dissimilar.</p>
  <p>Indeed,  this mutual sorrow that had just come to them had seemed to draw them together  more closely than they had ever been before.</p>
  <p>And  though Rosemary had earlier that morning inquired concerning the mysterious Mr.  Johnson, she had received no satisfaction, and now she hoped to learn details.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  had hoped not to be obliged to tell you of his business here,&#8221; Vincent said  slowly, &#8220;but his strange disappearance seems to make it advisable that I should  do so. Yet,&#8221; he still hesitated, &#8220;I cannot convince myself that the man is  really missing. I can&#8217;t help thinking he is about the place or in the house  somewhere. He was so intensely interested in the architecture of this house, he  was so eager to go into every nook and cranny of it, may it not be possible  that he has fallen asleep in some unused room, or even, perhaps, met with an  accident while climbing from one place to another?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Are  there such dangerous places?&#8221; asked Lane.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes; at least, they might be dangerous to an adventurous stranger. You see,  there are upwards of fifty rooms in the house, and there are turret rooms, to  enter which one must step out on the leads; also, there are dark dungeon-like  rooms down in the sub-cellar where if one were to stumble and fall, perhaps  breaking a leg or even spraining an ankle, his cries might not be heard by the  household.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  think Mr. Johnson, a transient guest, would go down in your sub-cellar alone,  at night, in utter darkness?&#8221; and Lane looked astounded.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  merely suggest it,&#8221; Vincent said, looking harassed, &#8220;because he was apparently  out of his bedroom all night, and because he showed such extraordinary interest  in the construction of the house.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very  well, Mr. Vincent, if you wish to wait until further search can be made for the  gentleman before revealing the secret of his errand here, we will wait. You had  better send some of your people to look over the house at once. But in the  meantime, I will ask you for the details of his arrival, and a description of  the man.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  came here yesterday afternoon,&#8221; Vincent began, slowly. &#8220;He sent in no card, but  told my butler his name was Henry Johnson, and he wished to see me on important  and private business. I rarely see callers who are not known to me, but I was  not busy at the moment, and I had him shown in. His errand was really a simple  business proposition, which involved a large investment of money if I saw fit  to take it up. I called my sister down to consult with us, as her fortune is  about the same as my own, and we usually made our investments together. I will  tell you the full details of this business plan later,&#8212;if Mr. Johnson cannot be  found. If he does turn up, I feel sure he would prefer the matter kept  confidential.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  Mr. Johnson proved to be a fairly agreeable guest, though not at all  distinguished in any way. As we had not come to final decisions, I invited him to  remain overnight. Also, as my sister and I had just about concluded to accept  his propositions, and as the man was so enthralled with Greatlarch, I invited  him to remain here a week and enjoy the beauties of the place.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  was with you all the evening?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;After  dinner he sat with us in my own private room until our plans were pretty well  made regarding the venture he proposed. Then my sister grew weary, and  concluded to retire, all three of us agreeing to draw up contracts and settle  the business finally in the morning.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you went upstairs with your sister?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  as I always do. The doctor prescribes a certain sleeping draught for her, which  must be carefully measured. I have no doubt of her carefulness and accuracy,  but to be on the safe side, I have always measured the medicine myself.  Moreover, my sister appreciated my little courtesy of escorting her to her  room, so I have always made it a practice. Sometimes I remain for a little  chat, but last night, having a guest, I went downstairs again after saying good  night.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  rejoined Mr. Johnson?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  I found him wandering about the halls, rapt in admiration of the choice  marbles, of which, it seems, he is a connoisseur. I led him about through many  of the rooms, even going with him nearly to the top of the house,&#8212;there are  nine stories, counting the basements. As we came down from the upper floors, we  reached the room destined for his use. It is one of the south rooms.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  duly admired it, and after asking him if he had everything he wanted for the night,  and being assured that he had, I bade him good night and left him there;  telling him, however, that if he wished to prowl about he was at liberty to do  so. In this house, no one is surprised or alarmed to hear footfalls during the  small hours. We are all wakeful, and frequently go up or down stairs on various  trifling errands.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you heard Mr. Johnson prowling about in the night?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  I can&#8217;t say that I did. Yet he may have done so, for the rugs are thick and  soft, and with care one may make no noise.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  the last you saw of this man was when you left him in his bedroom?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  that was the last I saw of him. He was in good spirits, for he had achieved his  purpose in coming here. He was satisfied with the agreement we had come to,  and he looked forward to the morning, when we would sign the final contracts,  and also, when he would remain as my guest for a time.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  then, this morning, he has disappeared?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  is not here, certainly, but I can&#8217;t think it is a mysterious disappearance. He  may have gone for a very early morning walk, and met with some untoward  accident. Or he may have remembered some important business matter, and walked  down to the village to telegraph or something of that sort. I only suggest  these things, because they are to my mind more probable than that the man has  voluntarily or purposely gone away. Yet there may be a mystery about it, and it  may be we shall never see him again. Those things I trust the detectives will  delve into.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent  leaned back in his chair, looking not so much physically wearied with the  conversation as mentally and nervously exhausted by the strain of the  situation.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  does Johnson look like?&#8221; Lane asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Describe  him, Mellish,&#8221; Homer Vincent said, feeling he could delegate this task to  another.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,&#8221;  the butler said, speaking slowly, but concisely; &#8220;he is a medium-size man, and  a medium-weight man. He&#8217;s well enough shaped, but he has no carriage&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Carriage?&#8221;  interrupted Lane.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir, carriage, I said. Meaning he don&#8217;t bear himself with any  distinguishment,&#8212;as a gentleman should.&#8221;</p>
  <p>A  gleam of amusement passed across Vincent&#8217;s face at this, but he immediately  resumed his look of weary sadness.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  but what he knew how to behave proper; he was all right at the table, and  that,&#8212;but I should say he is not really an aristocrat.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  be too severe, Mellish,&#8221; Vincent admonished him; &#8220;I think Mr. Johnson had good  manners.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good  manners, yes,&#8221; Mellish granted, &#8220;but, well, he was lacking in cultural  background.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Some  of the hearers stared at this phrase from the butler&#8217;s lips, but those of the  household knew Mellish&#8217;s trick of picking up phrases overheard at his master&#8217;s  table and, later, using them, either rightly or wrongly, in his own  conversation.</p>
  <p>Vincent  smiled outright, and even Rosemary&#8217;s sorrowful face showed amused appreciation.</p>
  <p>Lane  repeated the phrase in bewilderment.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Cultural  background!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;what do you mean?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  I say,&#8221; returned the unabashed Mellish. &#8220;Mr. Johnson, I feel sure, is not  accustomed to mingle in the best of social circles; he has no phrases or  allusions in his speech that betoken the college man or the student of life and  literature.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps  you&#8217;d better confine yourself to his physical description, Mellish,&#8221; Vincent  suggested. &#8220;and omit your opinion of his mentality.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir. Then, Mr. Johnson is a very dark-faced man,&#8212;dark hair, eyes, and skin. He  wears a small black moustache, and under it his white teeth gleam like those of  some ferocious animal. His countenance is what may be called sinister,&#8212;yes, sir,&#8212;sinister.  In a word, Mr. Henry Johnson has the face of a murderer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Mellish gave a sudden gasp, Rosemary turned white, and Homer Vincent stared at  his butler.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  a murderer,&#8221; Mellish repeated; &#8220;and he&#8217;s the villain what did for our Miss  Anne! How can it be otherwise? In comes a stranger, has secret dealings with  master and Miss Anne,&#8212;him all the time looking like a murderer, if ever man  did! Comes morning, he&#8217;d fled, his bed not touched, his hat and coat left  behind him, and the dear lady dead in her bed! What else could be the  exclamation?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mellish&#8217;s  habit of miscalling a word provoked no smile this time, for everybody was  startled at his idea, and was turning it over mentally, with, deep interest.</p>
  <p>At  last, Doctor Archer said coldly, &#8220;Can any one suggest a motive for such a deed  on the part of Mr. Johnson?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  and I can&#8217;t think of him as the criminal,&#8221; said Vincent, thoughtfully. &#8220;And  yet, if Johnson never appears again, it does seem a way to look.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course it&#8217;s a way to look!&#8221; Brown cried eagerly. &#8220;The only way to look, as yet.  Who else could get into the house, with the night watchman on duty? Who else is  a possible suspect in a house of devoted servants and loving relatives? Why  else would Johnson disappear? What else would explain his unused bed? A man  doesn&#8217;t wander about the whole night, admiring house decorations, however  beautiful!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  true, Brown,&#8221; said Brewster, slowly, &#8220;but we must get more data before we  assume anything. This man&#8217;s room, now. Much could doubtless be learned from examination  of his belongings. Had he any luggage?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  kit-bag,&#8221; Mellish informed. &#8220;A new one, not overly large. I laid out his night  things,&#8212;right and proper enough, but not elaborate or fine. And all new.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  always suspicious,&#8221; declared the quick-witted Brown. &#8220;When a man has a lot of  new things, it means he wants to conceal his identity.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  Johnson didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Vincent told them. &#8220;He told his name and address  straightforwardly enough; he had to, for us to come to a business agreement.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  that&#8217;s so,&#8221; and Brown looked a little crestfallen. &#8220;Go on, Mellish, as to his  kit. Anything more personal than clothing and toilet things?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  as I recollect. But the room hasn&#8217;t been touched, sir; you can go up and deduce  it whenever you wish.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mellish  was sure of his word this time.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s  go now, Brewster,&#8221; cried Brown; &#8220;the chap may come back any minute.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  two detectives went up to the room in question, while the others remained  downstairs.</p>
  <p>The  windows were not wide, but owing to the thickness of the stone wall they were  very deep.</p>
  <p>Brown  leaned far out of one, and drawing back into the room, informed Brewster that  nobody could get in or out by that means. The room was on the third floor, and  the stone wall was unscalable.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  Pighead,&#8221; Brewster returned, amiably, &#8220;nobody has suspected Friend Johnson of  making his exit otherwise than by this door; why the fuss about the window?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  how did he get out of the house by the front door without being seen by the  watchman? If he could have made any other getaway, it would simplify matters a  lot.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  hope to simplify matters yet, my son. This is a stupendous case&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  talk like that parrot-tongued butler! Stupendous is a silly word. But the case  is a corker! I&#8217;ll admit that!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  that&#8217;s what I meant by stupendous. Now, as you can see for yourself, there&#8217;s  absolutely nothing to be learned from this bag or its contents. It isn&#8217;t  unpacked at all,&#8212;just as the man left it. Nothing in it but a change of  underclothing, a pair of socks, a timetable, a clothesbrush&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Here  are a few things on the dresser,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;But nothing personal. See, the  brushes are plain black rubber, without monogram or initials. Here in the top  drawer, we see three or four clean handkerchiefs, a necktie, and a pair of  gloves. Doubtless the good Mellish put these here, by way of arranging his  wardrobe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  of course. Not a thing marked, not a thing personal or different from hundreds  of other men&#8217;s belongings.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s  his hat and coat. Old Sherlock would size him up perfectly just from the hat  alone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  I can&#8217;t; I don&#8217;t see anything but a plain black Derby, this season&#8217;s style,  new,&#8212;like everything else!&#8212;and bought at Knox&#8217;s in New York. Small help in  that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  his coat is no better. New, too, bought at Rogers, Peet and Co.&#8217;s, also in New  York. Does the chap hail from New York?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know. Mr. Vincent can tell us that. But I&#8217;ll say Johnson is the one to  look to as a potential murderer, at any rate. Think so?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  but he doesn&#8217;t seem to be a man of any forceful personality, so far.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  the beauty of it! You see, if he is the murderer he would come here all togged  out in clothes and things, new and unmarked, just to prevent the disclosure of  his identity.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Something  in that, by Jove! Now, if we can circumvent his bright idea,&#8212;I mean, find some  purely personal thing that he has overlooked, we&#8217;ll hoist him with his own  petard!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  here&#8217;s the thing! See, an atomizer,&#8212;isn&#8217;t that what you call these little  sprayers? It was on the washstand.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Brewster  looked at the glass container and its black rubber spray with interest.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good  as far as it goes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the bottle of medicine that belongs with  it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  see any. Well, I&#8217;ll leave it where I found it. Let&#8217;s go back downstairs.&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky6"></a>Chapter 6 <br>
The Wild Harp</b></h2>
  <p>Mellish  had detailed two of the servants to search the house and grounds thoroughly for  the missing Johnson.</p>
  <p>This  was easily done, for the men were familiar with all the unused rooms and all  the dark passages and dungeon-like spaces in the cellar and sub-cellar.</p>
  <p>They  returned with the report that there was positively no one concealed in the  house and no sign of any one about the grounds.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  clear enough to me,&#8221; said Doctor Archer. &#8220;that the missing man is the criminal  we are in search of. Had he met with an accident, he would have been found,  even though injured or dead. As it is, he has evidently disappeared of his own  volition and intentionally. What can we assume, then, but that he is the  murderer and has fled?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,  Mr. Vincent,&#8221; Lane said, &#8220;I think you should now tell us all you know about the  man and what business brought him here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Willingly,&#8221;  Homer Vincent answered, &#8220;but,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I cannot conceive why he should have  killed my sister,&#8212;or how he accomplished it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is for us to discover,&#8221; Lane said, a little pompously. &#8220;But, first, Doctor  Archer, how long do you judge Miss Vincent had been dead when you arrived?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is the most surprising part of it,&#8221; Archer replied. &#8220;It is not often possible  to affirm positively as to that matter, but allowing a wide margin of  probability, I feel sure that death occurred not more than three hours before I  made the examination of the body.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent  looked at the speaker with an amazed face.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,&#8221;  he exclaimed, &#8220;that would mean that my sister was&#8212;was killed only about an hour  before we broke into her room!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is my report,&#8221; Archer said, decidedly. &#8220;As I say, it is hard to tell with  certainty, but death must have occurred as late as seven o&#8217;clock this morning.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,&#8221;  said Mellish, who in the stress of the occasion was joining in the  conversation, &#8220;then, that man, that murderer, waited till Hoskins went off  duty, and then he killed Miss Anne and immejitly made himself scarce! You&#8217;ll  never see him again!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  why,&#8212;<i>why</i> would he kill her?&#8221; Vincent  persisted. &#8220;However, if he did,&#8212;he&#8217;s the man we want and he must be found. I&#8217;ll  tell you all I know about him. In fact, I have told you all, except the nature  of his business here. It was this. He claims to have discovered or invented a way  to make what are known as synthetic rubies. This is not unheard of among  chemists and the results of attempts, so far, are well known to lapidaries and  to jewelers. But Johnson declared that his process was so far above and beyond  all others in point of merit and value, that if he could make and market his  wares it would mean a revolution in the jewel business and a colossal fortune  for the inventor and his backer. For, of course, his plan was for me to finance  the project, he putting his knowledge and experience against my money  investment. Then he proposed we divide evenly the profits. This, in a nutshell,  is the gist of his business here. I am not one who is easily persuaded to  invest in an unknown venture, but the way he talked proved to me that he knew  his subject thoroughly, and the proofs he showed of success already attained,  made me give the matter deep consideration.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  called my sister in to the discussion, not only because I wished to give her an  opportunity to share in the undertaking if she chose, but also because I place  great reliance on her good judgment and sound advice. Somewhat to my surprise,  she was enthusiastic over the plan, and wanted to put in a large sum of money.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Does  it, then, require such an outlay to attain the desired end?&#8221; asked Archer,  greatly interested.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  and I was convinced of it by the statistics and verified data that Mr. Johnson  showed me. He also had with him two rubies which he had himself manufactured,  and which a leading jewelry firm had declared genuine stones. I have those  still in my possession, in my safe, and I will show them to you, whenever you  like. My sister was entranced with their beauty and luster. After our afternoon  confab, my sister wore down to dinner a fine and perfect ruby of her own, for the  purposes of comparison. I could see no difference in the real and the false.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  you decided to finance his project, Mr. Vincent?&#8221; Brewster asked, respectfully.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  had practically so decided, but we were to confer further this morning, and if  we agreed on certain unsettled points in the contract, I was quite ready to  sign it and so was my sister. It meant a large outlay of money for laboratories  and materials, but we were firmly assured we would get it back many times over.  That, Doctor Archer, was the business that brought Henry Johnson to my door,  and if I hesitated to make it public, it was because I felt a certain duty to  him. Since he has so surely disappeared, and since there is a reason to believe  him a criminal, of course, I am absolved from my promise of secrecy.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  is Miss Vincent&#8217;s ruby?&#8221; asked Brown suspiciously; &#8220;maybe he took that with  him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent looked startled.</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  had it on when I bade her good night,&#8221; he said, thinking back; &#8220;she always  cares for it herself&#8212;call Francine, Mellish.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  maid appeared, and Vincent asked her concerning the jewel.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;Miss Vincent had it on last evening. When disrobing, she  put it in her wall safe, as usual. Is it not there?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go  and see,&#8221; directed Vincent. &#8220;You can open it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, Miss Vincent trusted me with the combination.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  just go along,&#8221; Brown said, and the two left the room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am frightened to go in,&#8221; said Francine, crossing herself as they reached the  threshold.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss  Anne&#8212;she is there&#8212;and yet&#8212;not there!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  she can&#8217;t hurt you! Come along. Are you superstitious?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No&#8212;yes,  I am! And last night, the Wild Harp played! Did you know that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s  the Wild Harp?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  a spirit harp, played by phantom fingers. The fingers, monsieur, of the dead  lady&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss  Vincent?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no, no,&#8212;the lady who was long time ago dead&#8212;in this very room&#8212;this same room,  monsieur, and again a deed of blood!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  see; you mean Mrs. Lamont.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Madame Lamont,&#8212;she was murdered, or, she killed herself,&#8212;it is not known  which,&#8212;and of a truth, often she plays the Wild Harp, and always there follows  disaster.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,  interesting. And where is the harp? In the music room?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  monsieur, it is out in the dismal&#8212;the black thicket. Back of the Temple that is  her tomb. There is the Wild Harp, there, among the desolation&#8212;the somber  shadows, the soughing pines, where the gloom is deepest, there the Lady Lamont  walks by herself and moans, or plays wailing strains on the Wild Harp.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell  me more about this some other time, Francine. We&#8217;re sent on an errand, you  know. Come on in; don&#8217;t be foolish.&#8221;</p>
  <p>With  shuddering glances toward the still figure on the bed, Francine followed the  detective into the room.</p>
  <p>A  guard stationed outside the door said nothing and made no move.</p>
  <p>At  Brown&#8217;s command, Francine tried to open the small safe in the wall, but her fingers  trembled so, she could scarce control them.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  a baby you are!&#8221; cried Brown, though his glance at the pretty French girl was  not severe. &#8220;Tell me the letters, I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  it is my trust,&#8221; and whirling the dial. Francine at last threw open the safe  door.</p>
  <p><i>&#8220;Mon Dieu,</i> it is gone!&#8221; she cried; &#8220;the great ruby is gone! All  else is here, yes, here is the diamond cross and the emerald bracelet&#8212;only the ruby  is missing. The beast! The murderous beast! I knew he was the bad one! His  blackness&#8212;ugh!&#8221;</p>
  <p>More  by gestures than by words did Francine express her detestation of the man and  her distress at the discovery of the loss.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  sure, Francine?&#8221; Brown persisted.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, always the ruby reposed in this case, see! Now, the case is empty!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  I&#8217;m not overly surprised. Johnson is certainly the villain! Come on, we must go  down and report.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Francine  closed and locked the safe, and, dabbing at her eyes with a minute handkerchief  drawn from her foolish little apron pocket, she went obediently downstairs.</p>
  <p>Brewster  heard of the stolen ruby with a certain feeling of satisfaction. It was all in  keeping that the maker of synthetic rubies should purloin a real one&#8212;even at  the price of becoming a murderer thereby.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Johnson&#8217;s  your man,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;All we&#8217;ve got to do now, is to nab him. And that&#8217;s not  so hard as you may think. Mr. Vincent has his address, and sooner or later the  man must return to his home,&#8212;even if secretly. We&#8217;ll get him!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t understand it&#8212;&#8221; Vincent looked bewildered, &#8220;How did he do it? How did he  get the safe open? How did he kill my sister? It is all too unbelievable,&#8212;too  mysterious&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is!&#8221; declared Rosemary, her attitude of sorrowful dejection suddenly giving way  to a burst of indignation; &#8220;that was to be my ruby! Antan left it to me in her  will,&#8212;she told me so!&#8221;</p>
  <p>No  one thought the girl mercenary, or criticized her for this speech. It was  natural that the news of the theft should call forth such regret from the one  whose property it was meant to be.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Poor  child,&#8221; said her uncle, &#8220;that is true. My sister did intend for you to have the  jewel. Will troubles never end, Rosemary?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Uncle, I fear they have only just begun. I&#8212;I heard the Harp last night&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>She  stopped as a shade of annoyance crossed her uncle&#8217;s face.</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent always frowned at mention of the mysterious harp. He declared there  could be no truth in the tales about it, that no sounds were ever heard from  the dense thicket that the townsfolk had dubbed &#8220;Spooky Hollow.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Nor  was it an inappropriate name. On either side of the marble Temple were  beautiful pine trees and larches, and a background of these threw out the  shining whiteness in fine relief. But further back still, was a deep thicket of  lower growth, dwarfed trees, tangled shrubs and vines, marshy swamp ground,  that, after a long rain, showed dark pools of ooze and murky patches of soggy  ground.</p>
  <p>Lower  than the rest of the estate, it sloped still farther downward to a deep ravine,  which, filled with a wild growth, was so picturesque, and also so difficult of  access, that Homer Vincent had put off clearing it out to a future time that  had not yet arrived.</p>
  <p>The  unhindered growth of the trees and the rank and luxuriant undergrowth had, of  course, taken place during the long years that the house stood vacant, and it  was also during this period that the term Spooky Hollow came into use.</p>
  <p>Many  stories were current of weird sounds heard from the Hollow, of ghostly shapes  seen flitting there, of mysterious lights flaring for a moment, now and then.</p>
  <p>Many  of the townspeople pooh-poohed these stories, but there were many more who  believed the reports.</p>
  <p>When  the Vincents first came, it had been hard to persuade servants to remain with  them. But enormous wages and tempting conditions had brought many permanent  retainers and Mrs. Mellish&#8217;s wise government and kindly heart had secured  others, so that now a vacancy on the staff was besieged by applicants.</p>
  <p>Yet  tales persisted of hauntings and apparitions, prominent among them being the  stories of a phantom harp that was played upon only on dark nights, and that  gave forth long, wailing strains as of a soul in anguish.</p>
  <p>As  it was a fact that Mrs. Lamont met a violent death in her room, the same one  Anne Vincent had occupied, it was not strange that this harp music was  attributed to her restless spirit.</p>
  <p>Anne  Vincent herself had taken no interest in the ghost stories, her hard-headed  practicality refusing to credit a word of them.</p>
  <p>But  she had reluctantly admitted having heard the Harp once or twice, though  afterward declaring it must have been her imagination.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  was uncertain whether she believed in the spooks of Spooky Hollow or not. She  had heard, or had thought she heard, the Wild Harp, but she was never inclined  to talk on the subject and indeed, except among the servants, it was not often  discussed at Greatlarch.</p>
  <p>And  so, when Rosemary declared she had heard the Harp the night of her aunt&#8217;s  death, Homer Vincent looked at her in astonishment.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rosemary,&#8221;  he said, &#8220;I beg of you&#8212;at such a time&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,  Uncle, I did&#8212;I did hear it just after I came in&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;At  what time did you come in?&#8221; he asked, and then poor Rosemary wished she had not  spoken.</p>
  <p>But  he was quite evidently awaiting an answer, so the girl said, falteringly, &#8220;I&#8217;m  afraid I was a little late,&#8212;I didn&#8217;t mean to be.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  late?&#8221; asked Vincent, inexorably.</p>
  <p>&#8220;After  midnight,&#8221; and the girl&#8217;s appealing eyes seemed to beg him not to reprimand her  then and there.</p>
  <p>Nor  did he. With a slight sigh, he merely said, &#8220;You know my wishes, Rosemary. I am  sorry you so persistently disregard them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  came home at midnight, Miss Vincent?&#8221; said Brewster, hoping to glean  information of some sort.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  I dined with a friend over on Spruce Hill Road, and she sent me home in her  motor. I left the car at our avenue and walked to the house.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  order to conceal the fact of your late return,&#8221; observed Vincent.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Uncle,&#8221; Rosemary admitted, and her brown eyes fell before his reproachful gaze.</p>
  <p>But  Brewster went on: &#8220;Tell me, Miss Vincent,&#8221; he said, &#8220;did you see or hear  anything unusual when you entered the house?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing  at all,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I had my own night key, but I did not use it, as Hoskins  had not yet locked the front door.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Brown  looked at her closely.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss  Vincent,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you did not come directly into the house. You walked around  the northwest Tower and back before coming in at the front door.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  girl&#8217;s face expressed utter amazement.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is quite true,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but how ever did you know it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Rosemary&#8217;s  face betokened merely surprise, not alarm, but Brown continued to quiz her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  paused at the window of that Tower, and stood there some moments. Why did you  do that?&#8221; His eyes narrowed as he looked at her, and his voice was curiously  tense.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  rather resented this catechism, and then she quickly realized that the  detectives had a right to question her, and moreover, that she must tell the  truth.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell  me how you know I did that, and I&#8217;ll tell you why I did it,&#8221; she returned.</p>
  <p>Susceptible  young Brown was fascinated by the charm of the appealing eyes, and the piquant  little face, animated now by curiosity.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  a difficult bit of deduction,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I saw footprints in the snow along the  front portico and round the Tower when I came this morning. They were made by  slender, feminine shoes, and I think now they were yours.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  daresay,&#8221; said Rosemary, indifferent now that the mystery was explained. &#8220;Well,  I stepped around there because I saw by the light that my uncle was probably  there, and I wanted to size up my chance of getting into the house unnoticed.&#8221;  Homer Vincent looked at her with disapproval, but Brown suppressed a chuckle.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  really afraid of the old man,&#8221; he silently decided. &#8220;Guess his bark is worse&#8217;n  his bite.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  was your uncle doing?&#8221; asked Brewster, casually.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  was looking over some papers,&#8212;and he had something in his hand that glittered&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  two synthetic rubies that Mr. Johnson left with me,&#8221; Vincent explained. &#8220;I will  answer queries pertaining to myself, if you please.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Brewster  felt a little abashed. Homer Vincent had a gift of making people feel abashed  when he chose.</p>
  <p>&#8220;May  I see those rubies, Mr. Vincent?&#8221; asked Lane.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Certainly,  I&#8217;ll fetch them,&#8221; and Vincent left the room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did  it look like a ruby, the object your uncle was holding?&#8221; Brewster inquired of  Rosemary.</p>
  <p>The  girl looked at him and instinctively disliked his manner.</p>
  <p>&#8220;My  uncle prefers that questions about himself should be addressed to him,&#8221; she  said, coolly, and again Brown had hard work to repress a smile of amusement at  his colleague&#8217;s discomfiture.</p>
  <p>The  two detectives worked harmoniously and in unison, but there was a slight  feeling of rivalry that was, perhaps, not to be wondered at. Moreover, both of  them were greatly impressed with the gravity of the case, the magnificence of  the house, and not least, by the winning personality of Rosemary Vincent.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  proceed with your own story, Miss Vincent,&#8221; Brewster said, a little curtly. &#8220;After  looking in on your uncle, did you at once enter the house?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I thought from his manner he was meaning to stay where he was for some time. So  I went back to the front door, and softly opened it and slipped in. Well, of  all things, if Uncle Homer didn&#8217;t start that very minute to go upstairs! I was  so afraid he&#8217;d see me, I scuttled behind one of the big pillars in the hall,  and waited till he passed me. I scarcely dared breathe! But he didn&#8217;t hear me,&#8212;he went on up the staircase, and&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you followed after a discreet interval.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  yes,&#8212;but in that interval I went to the dining-room and ate a bit of luncheon  that Mellish had left there for me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>A  smile of respectful affection crossed the face of the butler as he regarded the  girl.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you had just come from a dinner party!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  but dinner was at seven-thirty, and since then, we had danced till after  midnight, and had no other refreshments.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  see. Well, then after your supper, you went upstairs?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Rosemary  suddenly saw she was practically on the witness stand.</p>
  <p>This  did not disturb her, it only served to make her more careful of her statements.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  she said, slowly. &#8220;I went upstairs, and as it is my habit to stop in my aunt&#8217;s  room to say good night, if she is awake, I listened at her door. But her  regular, deep breathing told me that she was asleep, so I went on to my own  apartments.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  did not know Mr. Johnson was in the house?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  I had no way of knowing that&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  saw the night watchman as you came in?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  as I came in, but while I was in the dining-room, Hoskins looked in. We nodded  at each other and he went on.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;May  I see Hoskins?&#8221; Lane asked, abruptly. Mellish went to summon the watchman, who,  though usually asleep at this hour, was still in the servants&#8217; sitting-room,  gossiping over events.</p>
  <p>He  came back with Mellish, and was ready, even anxious, to answer questions.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir,&#8221; he informed them, &#8220;I saw Miss Rosemary a eatin&#8217; of her little supper, and  I went on about my business.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did  you see Mr. Johnson walking about the house or grounds through the night?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  I did not, or I&#8217;d reported it, you may be sure.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  it necessary to report the wanderings if a guest of the house?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  I&#8217;ve never seen this Mr. Johnson they tell of, and if I&#8217;d a seen him outside  the house, I&#8217;d hardly taken him for a guest. We ain&#8217;t never had such guests as  that. But if I&#8217;d a seen him a walkin&#8217; about inside, like as not I&#8217;d a supposed  he was a visitor and let it go at that. You can&#8217;t tell just what you&#8217;d do in  such cases, less&#8217;n you&#8217;re there on the spot.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  you saw no sign of anybody at all?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir. After Miss Rosemary went upstairs, I saw and heard no human bein&#8217; till the  stroke of seven sent me in to breakfast. That is, no human, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  mean to say you saw or heard something supernatural?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  it, sir, the Wild Harp. She broke loose long about two or three o&#8217;clock, and  such a wailin&#8217; sound you never heard!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hoskins,&#8221;  Homer Vincent spoke, as he came into the room again, &#8220;you are too sensible to  talk like that. There is no truth in those stories of a Wild Harp.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Have  it your own way, sir,&#8221; and Hoskins cheerfully accepted the mild rebuff.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  are the rubies, gentlemen,&#8221; Vincent said, laying two gleaming crimson stones on  the table.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  beauties!&#8221; cried Doctor Archer. &#8220;Do you mean to tell me these are synthetic?  Made by that man, Johnson?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  he affirmed. Of course, there&#8217;d be no sense in his making a false statement of  that sort.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Uncle, they&#8217;re wonderful!&#8221; exclaimed Rosemary. &#8220;Can&#8217;t I have one of these now  that Antan&#8217;s ruby is gone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Miss Rosemary, don&#8217;t think about foolish gewgaws with your poor aunt lying dead  up above us!&#8221; Mrs. Mellish showed a horrified surprise on her round, rosy face.  &#8220;And you gentlemen may search all you wish, you may do all the detective stunts  you can pull off, never will you see that Johnson man again, and never will you  learn any more about poor Miss Anne&#8217;s death than you know this minute! For I  heard the Wild Harp last night, and it was a funeral dirge it played. The dear  lady was killed by a haunt, that she was! Who else could get into her locked  room? Who else could sperrit away Mr. Johnson? Tell me that now! She chose for  her own the haunted room,&#8212;and she paid the penalty,&#8212;did poor Miss Anne!&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky7"></a>Chapter 7 <br>
Uncle And Niece</b></h2>
  <p>The  dreary November afternoon passed, and the shadows lengthened and deepened the  gloom that hung over Greatlarch.</p>
  <p>The  Avenue trees waved their long branches as a soughing wind swept through them.  The pines sang and whistled and the dense tangle down behind the Mausoleum was  black and eerie, more than ever justifying its name of Spooky Hollow. Mrs.  Mellish stood staring out of a rear window, almost certain she could hear faint  strains of the Wild Harp.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come  away, now, Susan,&#8221; commanded her spouse. &#8220;It&#8217;s no spook music you&#8217;ll hear,  savin&#8217; that which you make in your own ears&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hush  your blether, Mellish,&#8212;I want no coddlin&#8217; from you.&#8221; And then, with true  feminine inconsistency, she turned to her husband and threw herself into his  arms, sobbing convulsively.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Therey,  therey, now, Soodie, cry an ye want to, it&#8217;ll do ye good,&#8221; and he patted her  shoulder and smoothed her hair, and comforted her by his strong protecting  arms.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  Miss Rosemary,&#8221; Susan said, wiping her eyes. &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand it to see the child  so gone-like. She wanders about, her eyes wide and staring, and that full of  sadness!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  loved her Antan,&#8212;that she did,&#8221; and Mellish nodded his gray head. &#8220;There&#8217;s a  terrible moil, Susan. Who killed Miss Anne?&#8212;answer me that now!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  mortal hand,&#8221; and Mrs. Mellish gazed solemnly into space. &#8220;Never could a human  hand do it, you see, for the door was locked, and the poor lady in there alone.  Comes the ghost of the other lady who met her death in that very room, and,&#8212;the wicked, evil thing,&#8212;she killed our Miss Anne! Or where&#8217;s the knife? How  could a human, mortal villain kill her and leave no weepon? Or how get out  through a locked door? Answer me that, Mellish, now!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  I can&#8217;t. Yet &#8216;twas no spook, of that I&#8217;m certain!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Susan  Mellish held up her finger, listening.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hark  at the organ, now,&#8221; she said; &#8220;Master&#8217;s fair crazy with his grief!&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  great organ pealed and rolled its melodies through the house. Fugues and dirges  of the greatest masters were played with a strong, sure touch and a powerful,  agonizing sorrow, like the cry of a lost soul.</p>
  <p>One  funeral march after another sounded as Homer Vincent strove to quiet his  perturbed spirit by the aid of his one great passion&#8212;music.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  stood in the Atrium, looking through the plate-glass doors down across the  terrace, across the lagoon to the white Mausoleum and to the black Spooky  Hollow beyond it.</p>
  <p>She  had put on a black dress, of plain and simple cut, and her white arms shone in  the dusk as she leaned them up against the window and hid her face upon them.</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  he doesn&#8217;t stop that music,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;I shall go crazy! I never heard him  play so like one inspired! It is heartrending, crucifying, yet it has a  triumphant note,&#8212;like the triumph of Death. Poor Uncle Homer, he must be almost  beside himself with grief,&#8212;I know by the way he plays. And he has no other  solace&#8212;I wish he would let me talk to him,&#8212;I&#8217;d like to talk about Antan&#8212;but he  doesn&#8217;t want me to mention her name&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  then, through the long shadowy room, lighted only by a faint radiance from the  Entrance Hall, came softly a footfall, and Rosemary turned to see Lulie Eaton,  her friend whom she had visited the night before.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rosemary,&#8221;  and Lulie put her arms round her, &#8220;I want you to go home with me, and stay a  few days. At least, until the funeral. Won&#8217;t you? It will be so much better for  you, and&#8212;your uncle won&#8217;t mind, will he?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Rosemary hesitated; &#8220;it&#8217;s good of you, Lulie,&#8212;I&#8217;d be glad to  go,&#8212;if I ought to&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course you ought to,&#8212;you owe it to yourself to get out of this atmosphere&#8212;oh,  have they found out anything&#8212;about&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;About  Antan? No, not a thing. The detectives are at their wits&#8217; end, Uncle Homer is  nearly distracted&#8212;listen to that awful music&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is desperately sad, but, what a wonderful performer he is!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes,&#8212;there, now he is improvising,&#8212;that means he&#8217;s a little easier in his  mind,&#8212;let&#8217;s go and ask him if I may go with you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  two girls went to the organ room, the high walls and domed ceiling giving back  the music and making the place seem more than ever like a church.</p>
  <p>With  a feeling of awe, almost of fear, they tiptoed toward the silent figure on the  organ bench.</p>
  <p>The  light was low, the branches of the tall trees waved against the windows with  weird sounds.</p>
  <p>Seeing  the girls, Vincent paused, slowly trailing his softly touched chords off to  nothingness.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  is it, Rosemary?&#8221; he said, wearily pushing back the thick hair from his brow. &#8220;How  do you do, Miss Eaton?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Lulie  Eaton dared her request.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Mr. Vincent,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve come to take Rosemary home with me for a few  days,&#8212;mayn&#8217;t she go?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  she chooses.&#8221; Homer Vincent spoke coldly, and again his hands hovered above the  keys.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Uncle,&#8221; Rosemary cried, &#8220;I won&#8217;t go if you don&#8217;t want me to, Uncle Homer.  Indeed. I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Would  you like to be left alone in this house. Rosemary?&#8221; Vincent asked, as, barely  touching the keys, he made them sound like a faint echo of a sweet, sad strain.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No!&#8221;  and the girl shuddered at the thought.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yet  you would leave me&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I didn&#8217;t know you cared to have me here, Uncle. You don&#8217;t like to have me  mention Antan, you don&#8217;t even talk to me&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;My  dear, there is some grief too deep for words,&#8212;yet human companionship is a help  and a comfort, even though ordinary conversation is out of the question. And  you can help by looking after the house. Can you not fill Antan&#8217;s place to a  degree? Can you not order the meals and give out supplies,&#8212;or, whatever your  Aunt did?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Rosemary  smiled a little at his idea of her Aunt&#8217;s duties. For, she thought, Miss  Vincent did none of these things, the two Mellishes arranged all such details.  But Vincent was not the sort of man who knew what was going on in the domestic  department.</p>
  <p>However,  Rosemary sensed the fact that her uncle wanted her to stay by him, if only as a  moral support, and though she would have preferred to go with Lulie, yet she  felt a certain pride in the idea that he wanted her at home.</p>
  <p>Not  exactly afraid of her uncle, Rosemary never could quite conquer a feeling of  awe of him, and a dread of running counter to his will in any way. But she had  long ago learned that if conditions were right, if there was no flaw in the  arrangements that made for his creature comfort, she need never look for any  but the kindest and most courteous treatment from him. But if any of his orders  were not fulfilled accurately, if any meal was a moment late, any course  imperfectly cooked or served, any book or smoking-stand moved one iota from its  accustomed place, then, as Rosemary had often had occasion to notice, his  sister or his niece received, however undeserved, a portion of his reprimand.</p>
  <p>So  Rosemary declined to go with her friend, and after a short visit, Lulie went  off alone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  were you two girls talking about?&#8221; Vincent asked, as he left the organ and  joined Rosemary in the living-room.</p>
  <p>The  lights were on, now, and the beautiful room was warm and cheerful.</p>
  <p>But  the girl seemed struck dumb. She blushed and remained silent, raising her  troubled eyes to her uncle&#8217;s face only to drop them again in confusion.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can read your thoughts the same as if you had spoken, my dear,&#8221; her uncle said,  a tinge of displeasure in his tone. &#8220;You talked of young Collins. Has he been  here to see you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Uncle, not since you forbade it.&#8221; Rosemary&#8217;s tone was gentle, her voice steady,  but in her golden-brown eyes there shone a sudden light, that was rebellious,  almost mutinous.</p>
  <p>Vincent  caught this gleam, and said, in real irritation, &#8220;I do think, Rosemary, at this  time, when I am in such deep grief, you might be less selfishly inclined to  brood sullenly over your own petty grievances. You know my dislike for Bryce  Collins, you know I will not hear of your marrying him; why not, then, give  over thinking about it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did  you ever love anybody, Uncle?&#8221; she asked, quietly, mentally adding, &#8220;except  yourself!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent  gave her a curious glance, and then said, sadly, &#8220;I loved your Aunt Anne. She  was my dear sister, and now that she has been so terribly taken away from  me,&#8212;away from us, I should think, Rosemary, that you would turn your thoughts  to your great loss, even if you have no sympathy or sorrow for mine.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Uncle, don&#8217;t talk to me like that! I do feel sorry for you, I do grieve for  Antan,&#8212;oh, I can&#8217;t realize she&#8217;s gone! What shall I do without her?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  very grave question, my child. But now, we must make some necessary  arrangements for the funeral. My sister must be buried with the dignity and  beauty befitting her life. And you must help, for there are many details to be  looked after.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Uncle, anything I can do to help or to lessen your load of care and  responsibility, I am glad to undertake.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  the way to talk, my dear child. Now, listen and I&#8217;ll tell you what you can do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  when the talk was over, Rosemary found herself weighted down with her share of  the errands and arrangements necessary for the obsequies that Homer Vincent  deemed appropriate for his sister.</p>
  <p>Not  that he desired any ostentation or display.</p>
  <p>But  his directions as to the music, the flowers, the clergyman&#8217;s address, the  luncheon to be prepared for guests from a distance, and the thousand and one  things that he mentioned seemed to Rosemary to make a task both burdensome and  difficult.</p>
  <p>However,  she relied on the Mellishes for much help, and she was so glad to be of some  real assistance to her uncle, that she willingly promised all he asked.</p>
  <p>And  then they drifted into a discussion of the terrible circumstances, as  mysterious this minute as they had been early in the morning when the discovery  had been made.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Uncle,&#8221;  Rosemary cried, &#8220;who killed Antan,&#8212;and how? I must know those two things or I  shall go out of my mind! I can&#8217;t conceive of any possible explanation, can you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Rosemary, I can&#8217;t. It is as great a mystery as it is a tragedy,&#8212;and I can&#8217;t say  any more than that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Uncle, we can&#8217;t say more than that. But somebody killed her,&#8212;that we know. How,  then, did he get out of the room, and what did he do with the knife?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Those,  Rosemary, are the unanswerable questions. And I must say I don&#8217;t believe these  dunder-headed detectives that are on the job can ever solve the mystery. Do  you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I don&#8217;t know anything about such things, Uncle dear. But they do seem unable to  discover anything or to suggest anything. Tell me more about that Johnson man,  Uncle. Was he a&#8212;a gentleman?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  no, Rosemary, not as we look upon a gentleman. Yet he had decent manners and  presentable appearance. I wish I had never seen him!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  you think he killed Antan?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  can I say I think so, when I can&#8217;t imagine his motive for such a deed. Unless,  of course, he stole her ruby. Too bad, dear,&#8212;that gem was to have been yours.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I know. But, Uncle, when a strange man comes here, and acts in such an  extraordinary manner,&#8212;not going to bed at all,&#8212;and then mysteriously disappears,  and we find Antan dead,&#8212;isn&#8217;t there logical reason to think maybe he did it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  certainly is, Rosemary, and I shall never rest till we find that man! It must  be possible to find him. He can&#8217;t have dropped out of existence. But that&#8217;s  where I thought the detectives would do better work. I supposed they would get  on his trail somehow, almost immediately. I thought detectives could always  trace a fugitive,&#8212;always find a skulking, hiding villain. But they seem not to  know which way to turn!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I noticed that. And that Mr. Lane knows even less, I should say.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  he&#8217;s a numskull. But the little detective, that one called Brown, seems rather  alert, and wide-awake, yet he can&#8217;t get anywhere, apparently; unless they do  something soon, I shall call in a more expert detective.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can  you do that? Right over their heads, I mean?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  most certainly shall. My sister&#8217;s death must be avenged, if any effort of mine  can accomplish it. But I do admit it seems a problem impossible of solution.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  facts are so irreconcilable,&#8221; the girl said, musingly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see any  conceivable way the deed could have been done, and the room left locked and the  weapon missing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rosemary,  there&#8217;s only one explanation. But I am not yet quite able to believe in it.&#8221;  Vincent&#8217;s voice was low and his direct gaze was so piercing, that the girl was  startled. She felt an uncanny, a sinister presentiment of his meaning.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Uncle Homer,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you don&#8217;t mean&#8212;you can&#8217;t mean Mrs. Lamont&#8212;&#8221; She  looked over her shoulder, and out the window toward the Temple where once had  rested the mortal remains of that other victim.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  always been a practical hard-headed unbeliever in spiritualism,&#8221; Vincent said,  slowly, &#8220;but I am so staggered by this thing, so puzzled to think of any  possible explanation, however improbable, that, as I say, I see no other way to  look but toward the supernatural. Yet I will not as yet put myself on record as  going over to the spiritualistic belief, only, unless we can unearth some  evidence, find some clues, I cannot say what I may do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Uncle  Homer,&#8221; and Rosemary&#8217;s face looked wondering, &#8220;I heard the Harp last night.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  imagined it, dear. How could you hear what doesn&#8217;t exist?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I did,&#8212;I&#8217;m sure of it. It was between two and three o&#8217;clock. I was wakeful, and  I was tempted to get up and go to some south window. But I didn&#8217;t, and yet,  even in my own room, which is north, I heard faintly the low wailing strains of  the Wild Harp. Have you never heard it, Uncle?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  have sometimes thought I did, child, but I put it down to imagination. Leave me  now, Rosemary,&#8212;I am very weary, and I must think over some matters by myself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>So  Rosemary went in search of the two Mellishes and they discussed the  arrangements for the funeral services of Anne Vincent.</p>
  <p>To  Rosemary&#8217;s own surprise, but not to Mrs. Mellish&#8217;s, it soon transpired that the  girl was not at all wise or experienced in household matters. Anne Vincent had  been the guiding spirit, the directing hand of the establishment, and though  she had occasionally called on her niece for some slight assistance, it was  always mere routine work, and carefully under the elder woman&#8217;s own  supervision.</p>
  <p>So  when the cook began to ask about how many chickens and hams should be prepared  for the cold luncheon, and what sweets should be provided, Rosemary found  herself quite at sea, and told Mrs. Mellish and her husband to get whatever  they deemed best.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  all very well,&#8221; and Melly shook her head; &#8220;all very well, Miss Rosemary,&#8212;but  your uncle won&#8217;t like it a bit, if you don&#8217;t fill your aunt&#8217;s place. Many&#8217;s the  little thing she did for him, many&#8217;s the time she looked out for him and stood  between him and some bit of a bother. Be careful now, Miss Rosemary, to do such  things yourself. Keep a constant watch on your uncle. See that everything is  ready to his hand when he reaches out his hand to get it&#8212;meaning, of course,  such as is outside the duties of me and Mellish.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know what you mean, Melly. What am I to do? Darn his socks,&#8212;that sort of  thing?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That,  of course, Miss&#8212;and his buttons and all. But hand him a paper or a book that he&#8217;s  glancing about for,&#8212;offer to play Russian Bank with him, when he&#8217;s in just the  mood for it,&#8212;gather from his symptoms what sort of food he&#8217;ll want for  dinner,&#8212;that&#8217;s the way Miss Anne looked after him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good  gracious, Melly, I can&#8217;t do those things! Why, I don&#8217;t know how to play that  stupid old card game! And I didn&#8217;t know he had symptoms!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  must learn, then, Miss Rosemary.&#8221; Mellish himself spoke now, and very  seriously. &#8220;Your uncle is a good man and a kind man if he is comfortable. If  not,&#8212;oh, well, Miss, you know him!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course I do. And I know you two look out for all his real wants. I&#8217;ll do  anything I can, of course, but I guess he&#8217;ll have to diagnose his own symptoms,  and select his special foods himself. As to this luncheon, Melly, order  whatever you think best. Be sure to have enough, that&#8217;s all, for relatives and  friends will come from all the country round. And, Melly, I don&#8217;t know much  about ordering and such things. Antan never let me help her much or tried to  teach me anything about housekeeping.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  should know, Miss Rosemary. It&#8217;s right every young lady should be a  housekeeper, such as your aunt, rest her soul, was. Now, if you&#8217;ll let me, I&#8217;ll  teach you, and you&#8217;ll soon learn, for you&#8217;ve a quick wit and handy fingers.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, Melly, and we&#8217;ll begin after all this trouble has cleared up a little.  Melly, who killed Antan?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  Ghost Lady, Miss Rosemary. Didn&#8217;t I hear her playin&#8217; on her Wild Harp&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  so did I, Melly. What time did you hear it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  it might be say two or three o&#8217;clock of the mornin&#8217;, Miss.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  the very time I heard it! Melly, how could a ghost kill anybody, with a dagger?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Likewise,  Miss Rosemary, how could a human kill anybody with a dagger, and go away leaving  the door locked behind him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mellish,  who had mysteriously disappeared, returned and whispered to the girl.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  opine, Miss Rosemary,&#8221; he said, softly, &#8220;if you was to step out this little  back door now,&#8212;just step out, you know,&#8212;you might&#8212;well, just step out now. I  opine you won&#8217;t be sorry.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Having  more than a suspicion of what Mellish was opining about, Rosemary stepped out  of the small door that gave on an areaway.</p>
  <p>As  she had hoped, there stood the tall, thin form of Bryce Collins.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221;  she whispered, &#8220;you ought not to have come&#8212;how did you dare?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  felt I must see you, Rosemary; it&#8217;s too utterly absurd to be forbidden the  house,&#8212;for no reason at all&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know it, Bryce,&#8212;but Uncle Homer is terribly upset anyway, and if he sees you&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  won&#8217;t see me. I just want a few minutes with you, dear. Can&#8217;t we go  inside,&#8212;somewhere?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  I don&#8217;t dare. Melly has just been telling me I must look after Uncle Homer as  Antan used to. And, surely, I can&#8217;t allow anything that he has so positively  forbidden. He&#8217;d&#8212;oh, I don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;d do!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  would he do, dear? Fly in a passion?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  I&#8217;ve never seen him do that. But he&#8217;d be so displeased, he&#8217;d reprove me so&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rosemary,  it&#8217;s idiotic for a girl twenty-one years old to be so afraid of anybody! Your  uncle is not your father, and even if he were&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  talk like that, Bryce. He&#8217;s the same as a father to me. Ever since my own dear  father died, five years ago, Uncle Homer has done all for me that a father  could do, and more than a great many fathers do. I&#8217;ve seen the other  girls,&#8212;their fathers aren&#8217;t half as good to them as Uncle is to me. And now  Antan is gone, I owe it to him to be obedient and to observe all his commands.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  you love me, dear?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Bryce  Collins was a tall, slender man, but his physique showed strength, and his  bearing was that of an assured, determined nature.</p>
  <p>His  deep blue eyes were honest and straightforward, and his smooth-shaven face  showed a chin that betokened will power to the point of stubbornness. And  Collins was stubborn. He clung to an opinion or a determination like a puppy to  a root, and he never gave up.</p>
  <p>Now,  at twenty-six, he was an insistent suitor of Rosemary Vincent, but his plea was  denied by her uncle.</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent gave no reason for his decision,&#8212;it was not his habit to give reasons,&#8212;but  he declared it was final. To Rosemary he said she was too young to think of  marriage yet, and he preferred that she should never marry. He hinted that he  and his sister Anne had been much happier in their lives than their brother,  Rosemary&#8217;s father, who had married young. In any case, he told the girl she  must give up all thought of Bryce Collins, and, unable to do otherwise,  Rosemary had submitted to his decree.</p>
  <p>And  as the girl was by no means of a sly or deceitful nature, she obeyed the spirit  of her uncle&#8217;s dictum as well as the letter.</p>
  <p>That  is, she did so, as far as she could; but Collins, with his indomitable will and  his firm determination, would not let her give him up finally, unless she would  tell him she did not care for him.</p>
  <p>This  Rosemary could not do, for she loved Bryce, and hoped against hope, that some  day her uncle would relent</p>
  <p>Now,  in view of the tragedy that hung over the house, Rosemary was more than ever  afraid to have Collins&#8217; presence known, and yet, never before had she felt so  strong a wish, a need, for his presence.</p>
  <p>And  his gentle tone, his whispered question, seemed to take away all her power of  resistance.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  she said, &#8220;I love you,&#8221; and eagerly he clasped her in his waiting arms.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Bless  her heart! Whatever is coming to her?&#8221; and wiping her eyes, Melly turned from  the window, where she had been watching the pair.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky8"></a>Chapter 8 <br>
Spooky Hollow</b></h2>
  <p>Twenty-four  hours had elapsed since the funeral of Anne Vincent, and the mystery of her  death was no nearer solution than it had been the moment her body was found.</p>
  <p>None  of the relatives or friends who had attended the simple but beautiful services  had been asked to tarry at the house.</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent had no desire to have them do so, and though several had dropped hints  betokening their wish to stay on for a visit, they had met with no responsive  invitation and had reluctantly taken their departure.</p>
  <p>He  sent for Brewster and Brown and asked for their report.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  have to confess, Mr. Vincent,&#8221; Brewster said, &#8220;that we are up against it. We are  convinced that the strange visitor, Mr. Johnson, is responsible for the death  of your sister, but we can form no theory that will fit the facts. We have  examined the bedroom, and we find there is absolutely no means of entrance or  exit, save that one door. The windows have patent ventilators that admit air  without leaving possible space for an intruder. The lock of the door is burst  in such a fashion as to show clearly that it was locked on the inside and could  only be opened by force. We have tried every possible suggestion of suicide,  and find that theory untenable, because there is no weapon in evidence. Miss  Vincent could not have killed herself and then disposed of the dagger, for the  death blow was instantly fatal,&#8212;we have the doctor&#8217;s assurance for that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am very sure,&#8221; Homer Vincent said, &#8220;that my sister did not kill herself. She  had no motive for such a deed,&#8212;I left her that evening in the best of spirits  and she was looking forward to the matter we were to confer about the next day.  And, as you say, it could not have been suicide, as there has been no weapon  found. I assume you made a thorough search of the bedding&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, I attended to that myself. No, suicide is out of the question.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  suppose,&#8212;&#8221; Vincent spoke a little diffidently. &#8220;I suppose you hard-headed  detectives wouldn&#8217;t consider the&#8212;er,&#8212;the supernatural for a moment.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir!&#8221; declared Brown, &#8220;not for a moment! I&#8217;ve been a detective too long to  suspect a spook as long as there are human beings upon this earth. Miss Vincent  was murdered by a knife held in a hand of flesh and blood! The motive was  robbery,&#8212;robbery of her valuable ruby. The criminal is, of course, the man  named Johnson, the ruby manufacturer. I can reconstruct the crime as it must  have been&#8212;but, I confess, I can&#8217;t see how it could have been so!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  do you mean by &#8216;reconstruct the crime&#8217;?&#8221; Vincent asked, curiously.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  I mean, that evening, after you left Mr. Johnson in his room, he came out of  it, later,&#8212;probably walked round the house a bit, reconnoitering, and laid his  plans to murder Miss Vincent as soon as the first faint light of dawn gave him  opportunity. He did this, and then slipped out of the house, while the watchman  was at his breakfast and the other servants about their work.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Logical  enough,&#8221; Vincent said, &#8220;except for the seemingly impossible feat of getting in  and out of that locked room.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  you have it, Mr. Vincent,&#8221; Brewster exclaimed. &#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8212;<i>seemingly</i> impossible feat. It wasn&#8217;t  impossible, because he did it,&#8212;he had to do it, there&#8217;s no other explanation.  Now, the thing is to find out how he did it, and the only way to do that is to  catch him and ask him. Nobody knows but himself, so he must do the explaining.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  sounds plausible, Mr. Brewster. Now, can you find him? He has four days&#8217; start.  May he not be far away by this time,&#8212;perhaps out at sea?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  true, Mr. Vincent, but all we can do is to hunt him down. Perhaps he can be  found even if he is on an ocean steamer. Indeed, that would be one of the  easiest hiding places to track down. But, and this is not an easy thing to  say,&#8212;we can&#8217;t do it. Mr. Brown and I have done all we could, so far, but for a  big hunt like this must be, we require the machinery, the facilities of a  larger police department, of more experienced investigators.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  daresay,&#8221; Vincent nodded in agreement. &#8220;In fact, I had thought of proposing the  plan of putting the matter up to some one else. Whom do you suggest?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  Burlington police. Not only have they a well-equipped Detective Bureau, but  they have one man in especial, whose forte seems to be delving into mysteries  that defy solution by others. His name is Prentiss, but so keen is he, so  sharp-sighted, he is called the Burlington Hawkeye.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent gave an involuntary smile. &#8220;Why, that is a celebrated paper of quite  another Burlington!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  it&#8217;s only a nickname. Well, what do you say, sir? Shall we call him in?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;By  all means. As I told you, I wish to spare no effort, no expense, in my endeavor  to avenge my sister&#8217;s death. I suppose this man will come in the interests of  the Police, but if it is any better or more advisable to engage him personally,  I will do so.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll  see about that, sir. If he succeeds, you can, of course, give him an  honorarium. He is a wizard,&#8212;I&#8217;ll say that for him, but I can&#8217;t see him solving  this case,&#8212;it&#8217;s too strange!&#8221;</p>
  <p>However,  when Prentiss arrived, he gave the impression that he certainly could solve  that case or any other.</p>
  <p>Not  that the man was bumptious or unduly conceited, but he had an air of  self-reliance, of self-assuredness, that carried weight by its mere physical  effect.</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent regarded him with curiosity, that turned to respect and then to entire  satisfaction.</p>
  <p>He  had a long talk with him, and Prentiss earnestly declared his ability to find  the murderer.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s  a mystery,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I am here to solve it. There&#8217;s a seeming impossibility,&#8212;I  am here to explain it. There&#8217;s a missing man,&#8212;I am here to find him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>If  Vincent thought the man too sure of himself or his powers, he did not say so,  and merely nodded approval of such determination.</p>
  <p>The  Burlington Hawkeye was not an impressive-looking man, in fact, he was rather  inconspicuous. Medium height, average figure, unimportant coloring, his  appearance was saved from absolute nonentity by his piercing, darting eyes.  These eyes were of the color sometimes called beryl or topaz. Also, they were a  trifle prominent, and were so quick of motion, so glinting of shine, that they  made remarkable an otherwise negligible face.</p>
  <p>He  shot a glance of inquiry at Vincent, as if to ask his recognition of his  powers.</p>
  <p>But  Homer Vincent was not accustomed to bestow praise.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am glad to learn of your enthusiasm,&#8221; he conceded, &#8220;and I am ready and willing  to do anything at all I can to help you. But I must ask that you will not  disturb me unnecessarily. While I am most anxious to have the mystery of my  sister&#8217;s death solved, most eager to find that man Johnson, yet I am not at all  interested in the details of the search, nor do I want uncertain or partial  reports. When you have learned beyond doubt some important fact, acquaint me  with it, but do not come to me with trifling discoveries that may or may not  mean anything. Am I clear?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Mr. Vincent, perfectly so. I understand. In fact, I have been told you are a  recluse and wish no unnecessary communications with your fellow-men.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is perhaps an exaggerated way to put it,&#8221; Vincent observed, calmly, &#8220;yet for  your own edification, it is perhaps the best way. Yes, you may look upon me in  that light, Mr. Prentiss. However, that does not mean that I do not want to be  told of anything you may discover of real importance. And if you are uncertain  as to the value of your news, refer it to Mellish, my butler. He is entirely in  my confidence, and often stands between me and what you have termed my  fellow-men.&#8221;</p>
  <p>If  Prentiss had expected to jar the calm of Homer Vincent by his outspokenness, he  must have been disappointed, for Vincent seemed rather pleased than otherwise  at the implication of retirement.</p>
  <p>Sensing  this, the detective resolved to get all the information possible at this time,  for it might prove difficult to get future interviews.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Will  you describe Johnson, please?&#8221; he asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  is a very dark man, both as to hair and skin. He is as good-looking as the  average citizen and has an air of business alertness and executive ability.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  is his business?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Aside  from this plan of manufacturing synthetic rubies, I know of none. It is  probable he has some other calling, for he appeared a well-dressed, well-set-up  man, as if accustomed to a competency but not wealth. He put his business  proposition to my sister and myself with a straightforward manner and a fair  and equal arrangement of profits.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  were to finance the thing?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  and my sister wished also to take a share in it. She had a fortune equal to my  own, and was anxious to invest in this new scheme.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  disposition did your sister make of her fortune?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  left no will. Neither she nor I have ever made one. We agreed that as whichever  of us died first would legally inherit the estate of the other, a will was  unnecessary for either of us.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  Miss Rosemary Vincent?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  question of her inheritance has not yet been brought up. It is true that my  sister intended our niece should have her great ruby,&#8212;but alas! that gem is  missing. It may be, however, that if you find Johnson you can recover the ruby.  In that case, it will, of course, belong to my niece. As to my niece&#8217;s fortune  or prospects, we need not take up that subject at this time. Sufficient to say  that she is under my care, and I shall guard and protect her interests. Now,  Mr. Prentiss, I will ask you to excuse me from further conversation. Mellish  will show you the room Mr. Johnson occupied; it is still untouched, I think. He  will also show you my sister&#8217;s room and the rest of the house and grounds. Or  he will depute some one to do so. You may command him in any way you choose.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thank  you, Mr. Vincent. I can&#8217;t help hoping for success in this investigation. It is  conceded among our profession that the more strange and bizarre conditions  appear, the more impossible the correlation of facts seems to be,&#8212;the easier of  solution a mystery is. This may or may not be literally true, but at any rate  it is true in part.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  most certainly have contradictory conditions in this case; you surely have  strange and bizarre situations. Go to it, then, Mr. Prentiss, and advise me  when you have achieved some definite success.&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  the Burlington Hawkeye was not so easily shaken off.</p>
  <p>&#8220;One  more thing, Mr. Vincent,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What about this Wild Harp? Have you ever  heard it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  should be sorry to put myself on record as a believer in the supernatural,&#8221;  Vincent looked as if the matter were distasteful to him, &#8220;but I will say this  much. If there are occult forces, if there are deeds done without the  intervention of human agency, then, Mr. Prentiss, then I must say this looks  like such a case. But, mind you, I do not say that there are. I do not state  that I believe my sister met her death by supernatural means,&#8212;but I own I  cannot explain the circumstances by any natural procedure. Also, I think you  ought to know that the place is reputed haunted, and that the room my sister  occupied was the room of a previous mistress of the house, who was also found  dead in her bed there. It is said that her spirit has haunted this place ever  since her death, but of these tales I am no sponsor. I merely mention them  because I think you ought to hear of them from me, rather than from the silly  townspeople. They have dubbed the place &#8216;Spooky Hollow&#8217; and they claim to have  seen ghostly figures and to have heard ghostly voices.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;This  brings us back to the Wild Harp. Have you ever heard it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent hesitated. Then he said, &#8220;Mr. Prentiss, I am no authority on the  subject. The truth is, music is my passion. Not only do I play on my organ  frequently, but when I am not playing I seem to hear the strains of my favorite  compositions. They ring in my ears to such an extent that I am as conscious of  them as when I am actually hearing them. And so, if I say that I have heard, or  think I have heard, this so-called Wild Harp, you must remember that I am also  willing to admit that it may easily be only my memories of music I have played,  or that it is some of the harmony with which my brain is always teeming.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  see&#8212;and yet you are willing to say that at times you have thought or imagined  that you heard the Harp music?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I am willing to say that. But I insist that you do not lay too much stress upon  it in your deductions. For I object to being set down as a spiritualist when I  am far from certain that I really do believe at all in such things.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  see. Now, one thing more, Mr. Vincent. Will you describe to me this woodland  down back of the Temple&#8212;the part of your estate that they definitely call  Spooky Hollow? What is it like?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is a densely wooded area, full of low, tangled underbrush and containing, also,  tall pines, larches, and spruces. There are, too, some white birches, which, I  make no doubt, are the shapes the frightened townsfolk have diagnosed as  spooks.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Doubtless  that is true. And the ground&#8212;is it wet&#8212;swampy?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  little marshy, I believe. I&#8217;ve never been down in it, but I think it is wet,  and I purpose having it drained and reclaimed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  it damp enough, marshy enough, to have bogs or quagmires? I&#8217;m wondering, you  see, if Johnson could have wandered down there and could have gone into the  swamp and have been sucked in by the quaking bog.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent  looked up in surprise.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I don&#8217;t think the swamp is as bad as that! Hardly of the quicksand variety,&#8212;if  that is what you mean. But ask Mellish about it, he will know the details of it  far better than I do. And I scarcely think Johnson would have gone out of  doors,&#8212;I mean to walk about. He was entranced with my house, and wished to  examine its architecture and marbles. But I can&#8217;t think he went outside until,  his fell aim accomplished, he went out to run away.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  left coat and hat behind him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  that is one of the strange features of the case.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Had  he an umbrella?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent  pondered. &#8220;I really don&#8217;t know. If so, doubtless Mellish took it from him and  cared for it. Can you gather nothing from his hat or coat? I thought such  things carried meanings for detectives.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Possibly.  I haven&#8217;t examined them yet. Now, Mr. Vincent, you don&#8217;t know of any other  possible reason for Mr. Johnson to kill your sister except robbery? Could he  have been an old-time suitor of hers, or a crank, an anarchist, or even a  homicidal maniac? Did his conversation hint any such thing?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  never thought of such explanations,&#8221; and Vincent looked bewildered. &#8220;No, of  course he was not an old beau,&#8212;ridiculous! My sister never saw him before,&#8212;of  that I am positive. Nor did he seem like an anarchist,&#8212;or a homicide. He was  normal in manner and conversation. I object to talking of business affairs at the  dinner-table. I do not think it good for digestion. But our conversation was on  usual, ordinary subjects. Mr. Johnson did not seem an educated man, in a  cultural sense, but he seemed a thorough man of the world, of fairly wide  experiences, and good judgment.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  said nothing of his life or affairs, outside the ruby business?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  our talk was impersonal. He knew little of music, and I know of no subject that  specially interested him. I&#8217;m sorry, Mr. Prentiss, but I can tell you nothing  definite concerning his personality. If I could, I should have told it long ago.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course, of course. Well, Mr. Vincent, I will go about my work. By the way, you  have confidence in all your servants?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Absolute  confidence in Mellish, my butler, and his wife, who is my cook. Also in  Francine, the little French girl who was maid to my sister, and who also  attends on my niece. She may seem like a shallow-pated little thing, but she  was devoted to Miss Vincent and truly mourns for her now.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  yes, I will talk with her. Good morning, Mr. Vincent.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah,  one moment, Mr. Prentiss. I shall not ask you to make your home at Greatlarch  while you are conducting your investigations. It would not please me to know of  your continued presence here. But, pray feel free to come and go as you like,  and refer all questions to Mellish.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Assenting  to this, the Burlington Hawkeye took his leave of the master of the house and  went in search of the servants.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Umbrella,  sir? yes, sir,&#8221; said Mellish, in response to the inquiry of Prentiss. &#8220;Mr. Johnson  did carry an umbrella and I did take it from him that day, and never again did  it occur to my rememory! I put it, of course, in the coat room, in the umbrella  cupboard, and there, I make me no doubt, it still is. I&#8217;ll see, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>In  a moment, Mellish returned, bringing triumphantly a good-looking and carefully-rolled  umbrella.</p>
  <p>Prentiss  looked at it with interest.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  can learn a lot from an umbrella,&#8221; he said. &#8220;First, I deduce a careful, tidy  sort of person, accustomed to take good care of his belongings. A knob handle,  not a crook, denotes a fastidious or particular person. Nine out of ten  umbrellas have crook handles.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  they now, sir?&#8221; asked Mellish, much interested.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  good quality silk,&#8221; Prentiss went on, &#8220;black, fairly new, made by&#8212;&#8221; He opened  it and read the name of a well-known New York haberdasher.</p>
  <p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,  we ought to trace it through that firm&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Trace  an umbrella, sir, as any one might buy&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah,  but you see our man had this marked. See, H. J., the initials intertwined. Now,  if we can trace up that order&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll  find out that Henry Johnson had his umbrella marked there, but how will that  tell you where to look for him now?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Every  bit of information we can get is important when hunting a missing man. Put it  away, Mellish,&#8212;or suppose we take it up to the room Johnson had when he was  here. Yes, that will be best.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  two went up to the room Johnson had occupied. But as he had only tidied up for  dinner, not having evening clothes with him, there was little to notice and but  few things disturbed at all.</p>
  <p>Prentiss  went over the scanty array of clothing in the bag.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come  now, Mellish, you&#8217;re by way of being a valet, wouldn&#8217;t your master take more  than that when going on a journey?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  he would, sir. Mr. Vincent&#8217;s overnight bag holds as much as a small trunk.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  so, and I deduce our friend here didn&#8217;t expect to stay the night.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maybe  so, sir. Maybe he thought he could do up the business in a short time.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  strange he left no papers, no letters, or memoranda of any kind.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Vincent has all the papers about the ruby construction business, sir. Mr.  Johnson left all those with Mr. Vincent that night.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  but I mean other papers. You&#8217;ve not cleared out any, Mellish?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no, sir. Not a thing in this room has been disturbed. Orders, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  that turned-down bed is just as the housemaid left it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Exactly,  sir. But she&#8217;d be for tidying up his brushes and that, at the same time. So as  one of the brushes is out of line, and there&#8217;s a towel or so rumpled up in the  bathroom, I take it the man was in his room after the confab with Mr. Vincent  in the evening.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, and beside, Mr. Vincent brought him up to his room, you know, and said  good night to him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did  he now? That&#8217;s a deal for the master to do for any guest!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Vincent not given to putting himself out for anybody?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  he is not. Mr. Vincent prefers that people put themselves out for him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  a good master, eh?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never  a better. Given that things go right.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  place will go on just the same, now that the lady is not here?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes; leastways, I suppose so. My wife, now, she can run the house as Mr.  Vincent wants it, and I doubt not Miss Rosemary will help look after things.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss  Rosemary? She&#8217;s a niece?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir; her father, Mr. Vincent&#8217;s brother, died five years since, and Miss  Rosemary then came here to live.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  has money of her own?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  take it she has, sir. She never lacks for anything she wants. But money is not  talked of in this house. They are no purse-proud upstarts. Mr. Vincent wants  only what&#8217;s comfortable and to his wishes, naught for show or ostentationary  purposes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  fine. And Miss Anne was the same?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  very same, sir. Though whatever Mr. Vincent was, of course Miss Anne would be.  And Miss Rosemary, too.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.  And, now, Melish, what about the Wild Harp?&#8221;</p>
  <p>A  slight smile hovered on the man&#8217;s features.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  sir, I&#8217;d not say as there is any truth in them stories. They are what you might  call&#8212;imaginatious,&#8212;yes, sir, merely imaginatious.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  some people have heard the weird strains.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;They  think they have, sir,&#8212;but, well, you know yourself, it couldn&#8217;t be. How could a  harp be for making music, when there&#8217;s no harp there and no hand to pull its  strings?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  a phantom harp,&#8212;and a phantom hand to touch the strings&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nay,  nay, sir. Nothing of the sort. All old woman&#8217;s tales. All made-up yarns,&#8212;that&#8217;s  what they are.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  all made up about the visitations of Mrs. Lamont&#8217;s spirit?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course, sir. Take it truly, sir, you waste your time a looking for the spooks  of Spooky Hollow.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,  Mellish, then who killed Miss Anne?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  was that Johnson, sir. Yes, sir, he&#8217;s the villain, the criminal, the anathema  maharajah!&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  Mellish&#8217;s solemn face and tense, strained voice kept Prentiss from laughing at  his queer, mistaken words.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky9"></a>Chapter 9 <br>
A Living Tragedy</b></h2>
  <p>The  Burlington Hawkeye bided his time to obtain an interview with Rosemary when he  could see her alone. He felt considerable curiosity about the girl and wanted  to learn some personal facts concerning her.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  Vincent had been what is sometimes called buffeted by Fate. But the buffetings  had been so gentle and the girl so well protected, she had never felt them  definitely.</p>
  <p>She  still had delightful memories of a childhood spent in Paris, of a devoted  mother and doting father, who might easily have spoiled her had she been of a  less loving and lovable disposition. Naturally obedient and dutiful, always  sunshiny and happy, her life was uneventful until, when she was ten years old,  her mother died.</p>
  <p>But  the broken-hearted child was so petted and entertained by her father that her  life again became happy and her mother merely a beloved memory.</p>
  <p>Moreover,  her father, soon after his wife&#8217;s death, was sent by his business firm to  America to establish a branch business in Seattle.</p>
  <p>This  pleased Carl Vincent, who was glad to return to his native land, although in a  hitherto unfamiliar portion of it.</p>
  <p>He  grew to like the Seattle climate and people, and contentedly remained there,  bringing up his daughter in kindly and well-conditioned circumstances.</p>
  <p>Carl  Vincent became a very rich man, but of this Rosemary had no knowledge or  thought. Vincent deemed it best to keep the girl to her simple tastes and ways,  and though their home was delightfully appointed, it was by no means  magnificent or of a grandeur commensurate with Vincent&#8217;s income.</p>
  <p>Then,  when his daughter was sixteen years old, Carl Vincent was killed in a motor  accident.</p>
  <p>The  tragedy was a terrible one, and the girl was not even allowed to see her dead  father.</p>
  <p>Immediately  Homer Vincent went out to Seattle, from his home in Burlington, Vermont, where  he was then living.</p>
  <p>He  tenderly cared for the orphaned girl and took her back home with him as soon as  the business matters consequent on his brother&#8217;s death could be completed.</p>
  <p>Anne  Vincent, whom Rosemary lovingly called Antan, welcomed her niece warmly, and  again Rosemary&#8217;s acute grief was diverted by the scenes and experiences of her  new home.</p>
  <p>She  deeply mourned her father, but Rosemary Vincent was an eager, vivid spirit, a  life and laughter-loving girl, and she quickly became a favorite among the  young people and neighbors.</p>
  <p>Then,  six months later, Homer Vincent bought the huge mansion of Greatlarch, and the  three moved there.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  loved the house as much as her uncle did. Her Paris memories made her  appreciate the full charm of the old French chateau, and her own beauty-loving  nature made her feel at home in the marble halls.</p>
  <p>Uncle  and aunt were kind and loving to their niece, but Rosemary found her freedom a  bit curtailed. Her father had let her do everything she wished, for she had  never desired the unadvisable, in his opinion.</p>
  <p>But  Uncle Homer was more stringent in his commands The girl could have her own way  in many instances, but if her ways interfered in the slightest with Homer  Vincent&#8217;s personal inclinations, Rosemary must give them up.</p>
  <p>She  did not openly rebel; in fact, she felt she owed willing obedience to her kind  uncle, but at times her patience gave out, and her disappointments made her  petulant.</p>
  <p>Especially  in the matter of young visitors at Greatlarch. Rosemary wanted dances and house  parties, and girl friends for long visits. But these were banned by Uncle  Homer, because the laughter and chatter of a lot of young people disturbed the  restful calm that he wished to pervade the household.</p>
  <p>It  had been tried a few times, with results embarrassing to the guest and  heartbreaking to Rosemary.</p>
  <p>Aunt  Anne had interceded for her niece, had begged her brother to indulge the girl,  at least occasionally, but Vincent was firm. It was his house, therefore, his  castle. He had a right to order it as he chose, and it was Rosemary&#8217;s duty to  obey.</p>
  <p>His  calm air of finality, which was never absent from him, made his rules adamant,  and Rosemary gave up the struggle and succumbed to a solitary life in her home,  though getting much enjoyment from social gayeties elsewhere.</p>
  <p>Though,  here again, she was handicapped by her uncle&#8217;s insistence on her early  homecoming. This brought about a slyness and secrecy, quite foreign to Rosemary&#8217;s  nature, but developed by her love of dancing and of young society.</p>
  <p>And  by the help of Hoskins and the connivance of the two Mellishes, all of whom  adored her, Rosemary managed to stay at most parties until they were over.</p>
  <p>Another  thorn in her flesh was the trouble about Bryce Collins.</p>
  <p>Though  Homer Vincent had no definite objection to the young man, he expressed his  strong disapproval of Rosemary&#8217;s marriage with any one. Of this stand he gave  no explanation, his usual manner being such that explanations never seemed  necessary. His word was law, unquestionable and immutable.</p>
  <p>Yet  Vincent was not a stern or awe-inspiring personality. If things were going as  he wished,&#8212;and they usually were,&#8212;he was not only amiable, but charming and  entertaining.</p>
  <p>He  was subject to moods, which must be observed and humored by his household. He  made laws which must be obeyed. He gave orders which must be carried out. These  things done, Homer Vincent was the most gracious of hosts, the most generous of  brothers and uncles.</p>
  <p>And  all this, the Burlington Hawkeye learned from Rosemary Vincent when he asked  her to go for a brisk walk with him, around the grounds of Greatlarch.</p>
  <p>The  girl, with her responsive disposition, liked Prentiss at once. He had an  ingratiating manner, and a pleasant air of courteous deference. The stare of  his slightly prominent eyes was often veiled by lowered lashes, and under the  influence of his discreet but leading questions, Rosemary told him all about  her life, past, present, and future, so far as she knew it.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  your father was the brother of Mr. and Miss Vincent?&#8221; he asked, interestedly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  their youngest brother. And the dearest man! Dad had the best traits of Uncle  Homer and Antan, and none of their faults.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  he was very rich, wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  yes,&#8212;I suppose so. I never thought much about that. I&#8217;ve always had all the  money I wanted, but I&#8217;m not an extravagant person.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you must be an heiress. You must inherit your father&#8217;s fortune, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  suppose so. Probably he left it to the three of us.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  you mean to say you don&#8217;t know? Don&#8217;t know anything about your own finances?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Rosemary  laughed outright.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  that strange?&#8221; she said; &#8220;well, then, it&#8217;s true. I don&#8217;t know a thing about  money matters&#8212;but I do know this. Antan&#8217;s great ruby was to be mine, and now  that horrid Johnson man has stolen it! Oh, don&#8217;t think I am heartless to think  of it, but you know how I do mourn dear Antan, and it seems awful that he  should have taken the ruby, too!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Are  you fond of jewels?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  specially, but that stone was a favorite of mine,&#8212;and it is a wonderful stone,&#8212;it  has a history&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss  Vincent, do you believe in hauntings,&#8212;in,&#8212;well, in spooks?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I do and I don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s too absurd to think a ghost killed Antan,&#8212;and yet, how  could a mortal get in&#8212;and get out?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  just granting that a mortal could do that,&#8212;suppose a skeleton key or something  like that,&#8212;whom would you suspect?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  that Mr. Johnson, of course. He was a clever burglar,&#8212;he just took that means  of hoodwinking Uncle Homer,&#8212;the ruby-making business, I mean.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  it would seem so. But why didn&#8217;t he steal anything else? Wasn&#8217;t there other  jewelry of your aunt&#8217;s about?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  daresay; but nothing to compare in value to that. Why, do you know that a ruby  is worth three times as much as a diamond of the same size? And Antan&#8217;s ruby  was enormous!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  did she get it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Bought  it herself,&#8212;soon after I came here to live.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  Miss Vincent, I truly think, now that you and your uncle are left alone, you  ought to have some sort of a financial settlement. From what you tell me, I am  sure you have an independent fortune, and it ought to be settled upon you. Aren&#8217;t  you of age?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Twenty-one  last birthday.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  you should see to it at once. Doubtless your uncle is going to attend to it  shortly, but don&#8217;t let him delay.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  Mr. Prentiss?&#8221; the girl asked, curiously &#8220;I am well provided for. All my bills  are paid without question, all my wants supplied unhesitatingly.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  well, perhaps it&#8217;s a matter of no immediate importance. You may as well wait  until after this awful mystery is solved.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Will  it ever be solved? Can you find that Johnson man? Where can he be? Where do you  think, Mr. Prentiss? They call you a Hawkeye, has your sharp eyesight yet  discerned anything?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know that Mr. Johnson has five or six days&#8217; start of me, and that in that time  he could get to the ends of the earth,&#8212;with his ruby!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  call it his ruby,&#8212;it&#8217;s mine,&#8212;and I hope you are going to get it back for me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  girl&#8217;s topaz-colored eyes looked into those of Prentiss. Her eyes were not  unlike his own in tints, but while his were round and staring, hers were  deep-set and expressive. Her long lashes were golden-brown, like her hair, and  her whole face was suggestive of the russet and gold glory of an autumn day.  Her clear, olive skin was tanned by a summer in the sun, and her red-brown hair  showed golden light in its clustering curls that shone like copper or deepened  to dusky bronze.</p>
  <p>Her  principal characteristic was an effect of vivid life. Her glance was direct,  her face animated, her lithe, graceful gestures indicative of vitality and enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>Perception  and responsiveness shone in her eyes and her scarlet, sensitive lips quivered  with a bewildering charm.</p>
  <p>A  fleeting, evanescent dimple showed only when she was deeply amused, but whoever  once saw it used every effort to bring it forth again.</p>
  <p>Though  too intelligent not to have a subconsciousness of her own beauty, Rosemary was  not vain or conceited over it.</p>
  <p>She  accepted it as she did food or sunlight, and gave it no more definite thought.  Full of the joy of living, absorbed in her daily duties and pleasures, she went  her way like a wise butterfly, taking no heed of the morrow in the occupations  of the day.</p>
  <p>Her  trivial troubles were those caused by her uncle&#8217;s restrictions on her freedom,  and her only real trouble, and that just dawning, was his refusal to recognize  Bryce Collins as her possible suitor.</p>
  <p>The  pair were in love with that first flush of youthful affection that is none the  less real because of its ignorance and inexperience.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  had liked other boys, had felt an interest in other young men, but until she  knew Bryce Collins, she had never felt the personal attachment, the mating  thrill, that is the precursor of true love.</p>
  <p>Moreover,  she admired Collins from an intellectual viewpoint. She appreciated his  mentality, and liked his casual traits. She adored his big, strong manliness,  and she was beginning to love him with a sense of reciprocation of his own  affection for her.</p>
  <p>Their  love was dawning, budding, just ready to spring into full light, to burst into  full blossom, when it was thwarted by Homer Vincent&#8217;s decree against it.</p>
  <p>Nor  was Bryce Collins ready to submit tamely to the dictum. He openly rebelled,  while Rosemary, uncertain of the wisdom of defying her uncle, was waiting to  see what would happen.</p>
  <p>Antan  had been her niece&#8217;s ally, in secret, but Anne Vincent would never dream of  opposing her brother&#8217;s decisions.</p>
  <p>And  now, even Antan&#8217;s support was gone, and Rosemary began to think she must do  something definite about it all.</p>
  <p>Her  nature felt a strong distaste to secret meetings with Collins. Her father had  brought her up to strict honesty and a hatred of deceit. Her little evasions  about late homecoming or casual meetings with Bryce at other girls&#8217; houses, she  condoned to herself as trifles. But now a real dilemma confronted her.</p>
  <p>She  was left the only helpmeet in her uncle&#8217;s home; the only overseer and  housekeeper for him to depend on in the matter of his small habits and peculiar  comforts. If she were to desert him, he would be left entirely to the care of  paid servants, and after all he had done for her, Rosemary&#8217;s soul rebelled at  the thought of ingratitude.</p>
  <p>And  yet,&#8212;there was Bryce,&#8212;growing dearer and more lovable every day. And with her  growing love, came growing womanhood, growing desire for her chosen mate, for  her own life partner.</p>
  <p>And  perhaps egged on by her talk with Prentiss, Rosemary decided to have a talk  with her uncle.</p>
  <p>She  found him in his own Tower room, and to her satisfaction his mood was a  composed and apparently pliable one.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  want a talk, Uncle Homer,&#8221; she said, as he held a chair for her. &#8220;A serious  talk.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Rosemary  was glancing about the room, and a sudden thought struck her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Uncle  Homer,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;what were you hiding in a secret panel the night,&#8212;the  night Antan died?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent&#8217;s face showed his amazement.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  do you mean?&#8221; he asked, blankly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  when I came home,&#8212;oh, I was late,&#8212;you were putting something away in a secret  panel, in this room. Some papers and also something that shone like gold.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  Rosemary, even if I was doing that, it doesn&#8217;t really concern you, and in fact,  I don&#8217;t remember the circumstance. But what is your serious talk about? Bryce  Collins?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Uncle,&#8221; and the girl bravely stated her case. Fortified by the advice of  Prentiss, she asked concerning her own financial affairs, and declared that,  being of age, she had a right to know these things.</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent drew a long sigh, and regarded his niece with a look that was both sad  and sympathetic.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  glad, in a way, Rosemary, that you have brought up this subject. I&#8217;ve been  trying to get up my courage to broach it to you for a long time, but I couldn&#8217;t  bear to disturb your happy, girlish content.&#8221;</p>
  <p>From  his tone, rather than his words, Rosemary sensed trouble, and she looked up  quickly to find her uncle regarding her with real sorrow in his deep gray eyes.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  is it, Uncle Homer?&#8221; she cried, paling in an intuitive premonition of an  unpleasant disclosure of some sort. &#8220;Don&#8217;t condemn Bryce unheard!&#8221; for the poor  child could think of no other ill news.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Rosemary, what I have to tell you now is in no way connected with young  Collins, though it may have a bearing on your friendship for him. Child, I don&#8217;t  know how to begin.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  it so very disagreeable?&#8221; she asked, wonderingly. &#8220;Then get it over quickly,&#8212;I&#8217;ll  be brave.&#8221; And she had need of bravery, for this was the tale he told,&#8212;the  secret he revealed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,  to put it baldly,&#8212;plainly, Rosemary,&#8212;you are not&#8212;you are not really the child  of your supposed parents. You are adopted.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What!&#8221;  There seemed to be nothing else to say, and Homer Vincent did not repeat his  statement, for he knew she had heard.</p>
  <p>Her  mind raced, her quick perceptions realized everything in one blinding flash.</p>
  <p>Not  her parents&#8217; child! Merely an adopted daughter! Whose?</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  look like that, Rosemary, listen to the story.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  it can make no difference. What are details? If I am not the daughter of my  dear father&#8212;and my angel mother&#8212;who am I?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Her  cry rang out, like the shriek of a lost soul. Her emotional nature was stirred  to its depths for the first time in her happy young life.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go  on,&#8221; she cried, inconsistently; &#8220;tell me the rest! Who am I?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Try  to be quiet, dear, and let me tell you. My brother Carl married a lovely woman  named Mary Leslie. A little child was born to them, but died almost immediately.  My sister-in-law, sadly stricken, wanted to adopt a baby in its place. My  brother approved of this, and so, Rosemary, they took you from an orphan  asylum. And they brought you up as their own child, they loved and cared for  you, and, as they never had any other children, they lavished real parental  devotion on you, as no one knows better than you do yourself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I do know it!&#8221; and Rosemary moaned between her interlaced fingers. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t  believe it, Uncle! I can&#8217;t sense it! Not the daughter of my dear, dear father!  Why, he loved me so&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  that&#8217;s what I said,&#8212;they both loved you like a real child of their own,&#8212;I know  they did.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  else knew of this? Antan?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  of course she knew it, but no one else at all. That is, except the asylum  authorities. Your parents,&#8212;for I shall continue to call them so,&#8212;lived in Paris  at that time, and you were taken from a small and exclusive orphanage&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  you know who I was? Did they know? Oh, Uncle, I can&#8217;t stand it! It&#8217;s too  dreadful&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Dear  Rosemary, don&#8217;t overrate the thing. It is a shock to you, of course, but  remember I&#8217;ve known it all your life,&#8212;so did your Aunt Anne,&#8212;so, of course, did  your parents. Did it make any difference in our love for you? In our treatment  of you? Never. And it will make no difference now. The only difference is that  you know it yourself, and I deem it wise that you do know. As I said, I&#8217;ve been  thinking for some time that I ought to tell you,&#8212;it is your right to know&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;My  right! I have no rights! I have no birthright, even&#8212;no name! Uncle, I can&#8217;t  stand it! I shall kill myself&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hush,  Rosemary,&#8221; Vincent commanded, sternly. &#8220;Never say a thing like that again. You&#8217;re  over-excited now,&#8212;you are stunned at this news,&#8212;but you will get used to  it,&#8212;you must get used to it. You have your life to live&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  have no life to live! I have no name&#8212;no hope&#8212;no&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Unless  you can calm yourself, my dear, I must ask you to leave me until you attain  some degree of composure. I want to talk to you about several things, about  your prospects, about your future, but I cannot talk with a girl who rants and  screams in nervous paroxysms.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Forgive  me, Uncle,&#8221; and Rosemary&#8217;s habit of obedience came to her aid. &#8220;I will try to  be calm,&#8212;I will talk rationally,&#8212;but&#8212;I mean, I will if I can.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  poor child strove vainly for composure, but her quivering sobs were persistent,  and her tears would not stop.</p>
  <p>Ignoring  them then, Homer Vincent continued. &#8220;I will take this opportunity to tell you  some further truths, Rosemary, for I don&#8217;t want to repeat a scene like this if we  can help it. Let us, therefore, talk it all over now, and do try,&#8212;make an  earnest effort to stop that convulsive crying.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Uncle. Tell me, first of all, do you know who I am?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Rosemary, I do not. Your father,&#8212;as I said, I will continue to call my brother  by that name,&#8212;kept no record of your birth. I know this, because at his death I  took charge of all his papers, both concerning business matters and private  affairs, and there was no document of any sort pertaining to your adoption. But  I have personal letters from my brother and from his wife, telling my sister  and myself all about the matter. You can read them for yourself, and it will  comfort you to read how they loved you from the first, and how delighted they  were with their little new daughter. Never for one moment, Rosemary, forget the  love they showered upon you, or the debt of gratitude you owe them and their  memory for the happy and beautiful life they gave you. Also, if it pleases you  to recognize it, your Aunt Anne and I, myself, have always endeavored to show  you the same love and affection as if you were really our niece.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  did, Uncle, you both did,&#8212;and I do realize it, and I am grateful.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Try  to show it now, my dear, by less agitation. This scene is wearing me out,&#8212;I am  in a nervous state, naturally, since your aunt&#8217;s death, and I cannot bear much  more. But what I must tell you, Rosemary, is that you are virtually penniless.  My brother left no will, and, of course, his estate reverted to your Aunt Anne  and myself, as his natural heirs. He assumed I would provide for you, and I  have done so, and I always shall. But, Rosemary, I do not wish you to continue  to live here. When your aunt was with us, it was quite different. Now, I am not  able to meet the conditions consequent upon having a young lady in the house.  You are young and fond of young society. I am getting old, and I need rest and  quiet in my home I am sure you can see for yourself that it would be impossible  for us to remain together happily. And I am sure you would not wish to stay  here, unwanted. So, Rosemary, dear, we will at some early date talk over your  plans, and see about settling you somewhere by yourself. Of course, you cannot  expect the luxurious life you have led here, but I will give you what I  consider a sufficient allowance for a young girl, and doubtless you will like  to take up some light occupation that will bring you in an additional sum. You  are not a Vincent, as I have told you, and so you have no real claim on me. But  I will willingly give you an allowance and I trust you will find a little home  for yourself. This is why I had to forbid you all thought of marrying young  Collins. They are an aristocratic old family, and his people, of course, would  not hear of his alliance with&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  say it! I am a nameless orphan, but I never shall foist myself on the family of  Bryce Collins&#8212;or on anybody else!&#8221;</p>
  <p>And,  white-faced and trembling, biting her scarlet lips in agony, Rosemary walked  out of the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky10"></a>Chapter 10 <br>
How Collins Felt About It</b></h2>
  <p>Rosemary  walked alone in the south gardens. These beautiful terraced plots lay either  side of the lagoon, and ended only at the broken stone fence that bounded  Spooky Hollow.</p>
  <p>This  fence, not unusual in New England, was merely a succession of flat, unevenly  shaped stones, most of them pointed, standing in a ragged row between the  gardens and the swampy jungle of undergrowth. They had a slight appearance of  old and neglected gravestones, and their grim, gaunt shapes added to the eerie  aspect of the place.</p>
  <p>One  had fallen over to a horizontal position and Rosemary went and sat upon it.</p>
  <p>The  girl was stunned. Not yet did she feel grief, sorrow, or despair at her uncle&#8217;s  revelations; not yet could she look ahead or plan for her future; she couldn&#8217;t  even realize the situation. She was dazed, bewildered,&#8212;her mind a senseless  blank.</p>
  <p>Wrapped  in her long fur coat, a small fur hat drawn down over her brow, she nestled  into the deep coat-collar and tried to collect her wits, to marshal her  thoughts, to make some plans.</p>
  <p>But  she could not think coherently. Her memories raced back to the dear, kind  father&#8212;who was not her father! to the loving, beautiful mother&#8212;who was not her  mother! Oh, it couldn&#8217;t be true,&#8212;it must be an awful dream! Then the dear  Antan, who had died&#8212;not her aunt&#8212;not Antan at all! Uncle Homer not her  uncle&#8212;Greatlarch not her home&#8212;</p>
  <p>Wonderful  Greatlarch! Rosemary loved every tower and turret of the splendid old pile.  Every bit of marble and wood-carving was her joy and delight. And she was put  out of Greatlarch&#8212;put out because she had no right there&#8212;no claim or  inheritance in its ownership.</p>
  <p>It  was too incredible, she could not believe it!</p>
  <p>And  then the tears came, and poor Rosemary buried her face in her fur sleeves&#8217; and  her whole slender frame shook with convulsive, heartrending sobs.</p>
  <p>She  tried to stop but it was impossible, so she let herself go and cried until she  was physically exhausted from her wild bursts of grief.</p>
  <p>Everything  swept away at once! Home, relatives, parents, even her name! She was a  homeless, nameless orphan,&#8212;a wanderer on the face of the earth!</p>
  <p>She  knew her Uncle Homer well enough to understand his attitude.</p>
  <p>He  had always objected to the presence of her young friends in the house. He hated  anything that obtruded to the slightest degree on his even routine of life, and  many a time Antan had stood between Rosemary and Uncle Homer&#8217;s displeasure.</p>
  <p>And  now, without his sister&#8217;s presence, Rosemary was not surprised at his desire to  have her out of his house.</p>
  <p>That  was bad enough,&#8212;to leave Greatlarch was a tragedy of itself,&#8212;but it was lost  sight of when she remembered the other and worse misfortune that had come to  her.</p>
  <p>What  could she do? But her brain still refused to plan. Every fresh realization of  her parents, her birth, brought the tears anew, and it seemed to Rosemary she was  at the end of her endurance.</p>
  <p>She  could have borne the shock of her parentage if she could have remained at  Greatlarch with Uncle Homer. She could have borne to leave Greatlarch if she  could have gone forth as Rosemary Vincent, in truth. But the two blows were too  much for her, and she bent under them like one of the slender white birches  before the chill autumn wind.</p>
  <p>As  she sat, motionless, her face hidden, her whole body shivering with cold and  quivering with agony, she heard faint strains of music.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  Wild Harp,&#8221; she thought, but so great was her apathy, she paid little attention  to it.</p>
  <p>Subconsciously,  she heard the weird, wailing sounds, an incoherent melody, eerie as a banshee&#8217;s  cry.</p>
  <p>It  was twilight, the early twilight of the late November afternoon, and as  Rosemary glanced uneasily toward the Hollow, she imagined the Harp strains came  from there.</p>
  <p>It  was almost like an olian harp, but that makes only accidental harmonies. This,  though disconnected and fragmentary, had a certain sequence of notes that  betokened an intelligent agency of some sort.</p>
  <p>Abstractedly  she gazed into the deepening shadows of the Hollow, and a sudden determination  came to her to walk into it, and&#8212;never to come out. If a supernatural agency  was in there, was making that weird music, perhaps it might attack her and put  an end to a life that had become unbearable. Better so, she thought, and half  rose to go, when a man&#8217;s voice sounded through the gathering gloom.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss  Vincent!&#8221; Prentiss exclaimed, &#8220;out here all alone? You&#8217;ll catch your death of  cold!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  wish I might,&#8221; she said, mournfully, scarcely noting or caring that she was  speaking to a new and casual acquaintance.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  now, my child,&#8221; Prentiss said, puzzled, but seeing her agitation, and quickly  deciding that kindliness was his cue, &#8220;don&#8217;t despair so utterly. Your dear  auntie was much to you, but you have much left in life&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  have nothing left! I have no life&#8212;no name&#8212;no home!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why&#8212;what  do you mean?&#8221; Prentiss was utterly astounded. He couldn&#8217;t imagine what she  meant, and wondered if the tragedy had turned her brain.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  hesitated a moment, but the situation was too strong for her.</p>
  <p>She  had no one to turn to for advice or help. She had put away all thought of Bryce  Collins from her forever. She would never face him with her terrible story, she  would never want to hear his pitying sympathy. She was a nameless, homeless  girl, not fit to be the wife of any man with a name and a heritage.</p>
  <p>Nor  would she ever willingly see Lulie Eaton again. Lulie had been a dear friend,  but Rosemary knew her well enough to realize that her friendship never would  stand the strain of Uncle Homer&#8217;s story.</p>
  <p>The  Mellishes would stand by her through thick and thin,&#8212;of that Rosemary was  certain. But they were only servants, and Uncle Homer&#8217;s servants. What could  they do for her?</p>
  <p>And  so, the impulse to speak freely to Prentiss was strong. He was an intelligent,  experienced man of the world. He might tell her what to do.</p>
  <p>So  Rosemary did tell him, and he listened attentively. She gave him the facts of  her parentage, as her uncle had related them, and she admitted her utter  helplessness and bewilderment.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  poor child!&#8221; Prentiss exclaimed. &#8220;You dear child&#8212;&#8221; and he restrained a sudden  impulse to take her in his arms and comfort her.</p>
  <p>For  Rosemary was very lovely in her abandonment of grief. Her imploring eyes,  gazing through tear-wet lashes, her quivering lips, beseeching help, her little  hands nervously clasping one of his own, would have thrilled a far less  impressionable man than the Burlington Hawkeye.</p>
  <p>But  he quickly saw that the girl was utterly unconscious of his personality,  utterly oblivious to the fact that she was appealing to his impulses, and that  she was merely pouring out her woe to him, because he happened to be there, and  she must speak or go mad.</p>
  <p>He  said quietly, &#8220;Suppose we go in the house, and sit by a comfortable fire to  discuss these things. If you are going to leave Greatlarch, you may as well  enjoy its comforts while you can. Come, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>And,  like a trusting child, Rosemary went with him.</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent was playing the organ as they entered.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  listened a moment, and then nodded her head in satisfaction. At least, he was  in a calm frame of mind. Close harmonies rolled through the dimly lighted  house, and Rosemary led Prentiss to the pleasant living-room, snapped on the  lights, and rang for Mellish to mend the fire.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  bring tea, mayn&#8217;t he?&#8221; suggested Prentiss, and Rosemary agreed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,&#8221;  the detective said, &#8220;would it be better to call in your uncle and discuss your  future plans? Or shall we just talk them over by ourselves?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;By  ourselves,&#8221; she said, promptly. &#8220;If Uncle Homer wants to, he will join us  without being called.&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  their talk was desultory, and without definite result.</p>
  <p>As  a matter of fact, Prentiss did not believe Vincent would really send the girl  away. He thought it was more likely a threat, in order to get her to agree to  have less company and fewer intrusions upon his own retirement and solitude.</p>
  <p>A  strange man, Prentiss deemed Homer Vincent, but, after all, a just and kind  one. Not a man who would really turn away his brother&#8217;s child, even though she  were only an adopted daughter.</p>
  <p>An  adopted child, he argued, who had lived all her life with her adopted parents  and their family connections, was entitled to recognition of some sort And  though he knew Vincent&#8217;s solitary habits and eccentric disposition, yet he felt  sure he would provide properly for Rosemary either in his home or out of it.</p>
  <p>He  had sympathized with her and did still, but he felt certain she was exaggerating  the case, and that while she must realize she was not a Vincent, yet she would  doubtless get used to that in time and pick up her life and happiness again.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Forget  it for a time, Miss Rosemary,&#8221; he said, as the advent of tea and hot crumpets  absorbed his own attention. &#8220;At least, you&#8217;ll stay here for the present,&#8212;while  I&#8217;m tracking down this Johnson man.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Have  you any clue to his whereabouts?&#8221; the girl asked, half-heartedly.</p>
  <p>She  was interested in the search for Johnson, but her own troubles had obliterated  all thought of him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  quite that, but I&#8217;m going down to New York to look up the jewelry firms whose  cards he left with your uncle. Surely they can tell me all about him,&#8212;I mean  his home and habits, and that will help us to find him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  if he has run away,&#8212;which, of course, he has,&#8212;and if he has sold that valuable  ruby,&#8212;which, of course, he has,&#8212;he has money enough to take him anywhere, and  he has doubtless gone out beyond civilization, and so, how can you ever find  him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  all true, but missing men are often found, and no criminal is quite clever  enough to cover all his tracks. Besides, he can&#8217;t sell that ruby at present. It&#8217;s  too large and important to offer to a pawnbroker or to a &#8216;fence,&#8217; as they are  called. Still, he probably has money enough for his escape. I&#8217;m banking on his  overlooking some trace or some clue that will lead me to him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Have  you any real clues?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes. The business cards, the synthetic rubies,&#8212;surely they can be traced to the  laboratory where they were made. Then there&#8217;s the hat and coat and umbrella&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  know, Mr. Prentiss, it&#8217;s too absurd to think of that man running away without  his hat or coat. The umbrella he might easily forget, but not the others.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  he didn&#8217;t forget them, as I see it. He was probably frightened away. Perhaps he  heard the watchman on his rounds, or thought he heard some one near him. And he  ran off hurriedly, without stopping for anything.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  could he get away? The grounds are locked and guarded.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,  Miss Rosemary, he did get away. We&#8217;ve searched the place too thoroughly to  allow of his concealment here. Now, as we know he did get away, it&#8217;s futile to  guess how he did it. The thing is to find him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I see that. And I hope you will recover my ruby. That, at least, is my own, and  I don&#8217;t want that horrid man to have it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  surely make a try for that,&#8221; Prentiss said, glad to note her interest in it.</p>
  <p>And  then, to Rosemary&#8217;s intense surprise, Homer Vincent and Bryce Collins came into  the room together.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Will  you give us some tea?&#8221; asked Vincent, in a pleasant tone, and still stupefied  at Collins&#8217; appearance, Rosemary tilted the teakettle over a fresh cup.</p>
  <p>&#8220;We&#8217;re  going to have a conclave,&#8221; Vincent said, as he took an easy chair, and the  ubiquitous Mellish, suddenly appearing, set a small table beside him for his  cup. &#8220;Mr. Collins called to see you, Rosemary, and I received him; and I have  told him the story of your birth, as I have already told it to you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  I don&#8217;t believe a word of it!&#8221; Bryce Collins declared.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  wish I needn&#8217;t,&#8221; Vincent said, a little sadly. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather, indeed, that  Rosemary were my own niece. I have always loved her as such,&#8212;and this  disclosure was bound to come sooner or later. I often talked it over with my  sister, and we agreed that we never could let Rosemary marry without  acquainting the man of her choice with the truth of her birth. It wouldn&#8217;t be  fair to him or to her. I think now, it would have been better if Rosemary had  known all her life that she was an adopted daughter of my brother and his wife.  But they preferred to let her grow up in ignorance of the fact, and this is the  result.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  glad they did!&#8221; Rosemary burst out. &#8220;At least I&#8217;ve had twenty-one years of  happiness,&#8212;even if I am miserable the rest of my days.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you needn&#8217;t be, Rosemary,&#8221; Vincent said: &#8220;as you well know, many children are  adopted, and lead the happiest of lives. That this knowledge has come to you  just now, is because of my brother&#8217;s plan of keeping you in ignorance during  his life, and my sister&#8217;s disinclination to tell you during her life. I, too,  would have spared you the knowledge, except, as I said, that Mr. Collins came  to me, and asked for your hand in marriage. I could not honorably let him marry  you under your assumed name,&#8212;so, what could I do, but tell him the truth?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is not the truth,&#8221; Bryce Collins reiterated. Vincent looked at him curiously.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t follow your thought, Bryce,&#8221; he said; &#8220;why do you say that when I tell  you the facts as they are?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because  Rosemary is all Vincent,&#8221; Collins declared. &#8220;Those topaz eyes of hers are just  like her Aunt Anne&#8217;s were. Her nose is shaped like your own, Mr. Vincent, and  she has the manner and ways of her aunt in many particulars.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  wish your arguments could carry weight,&#8221; Homer Vincent said, looking kindly at  Rosemary; &#8220;but let me call your attention to the fact that Mr. Prentiss here  has eyes of that same peculiar color, and he is not related to the Vincents.  Also, Rosemary&#8217;s manners and ways are of course modeled on those of her aunt,  with whom she has lived for five years, and also, doubtless, she learned  Vincent traits and habits from my brother, with whom she lived thirteen years.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,&#8221;  Rosemary exclaimed, &#8220;I&#8217;m twenty-one, Uncle Homer. You make me out only  eighteen!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  were three years old when you were adopted, Rosemary,&#8221; Vincent said; &#8220;you lived  in the asylum the first three years of your life.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Bryce  Collins looked serious.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Will  you give me the dates, sir?&#8221; he said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Certainly.  Suppose we all go into my Tower room, where are all the papers and documents referring  to the matter. Mr. Prentiss, will you not come, too? Your advice may be useful.&#8221;</p>
  <p>As  the other two left the room, Collins drew Rosemary to him, and whispered, &#8220;Trust  me, dear. I&#8217;ll straighten out this moil. You are a Vincent, I&#8217;m sure of it! And  I&#8217;ll prove it, too!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Rosemary&#8217;s  heart fell. She was glad of Bryce&#8217;s comforting tone, but his words meant  nothing. She knew the story was true. She knew Homer Vincent was telling the  facts and there was no denying them. And she would have preferred Bryce&#8217;s assurance  of his love for her, whatever her name might really be, to his protestations of  unbelief of the story.</p>
  <p>The  four, seated in the Tower room, watched with interest as Homer Vincent opened  the sliding panel and took out some bundles of papers and letters.</p>
  <p>&#8220;This  is not exactly a secret panel,&#8221; he said, noting the curious glances, &#8220;but it is  a private hiding-place. One has only to press this embossed ornament on the  panel, and it slides open&#8212;as you see.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  Burlington Hawkeye fastened his alert eyes on the slide, but Collins paid  little attention to it. He was eagerly awaiting a sight of the papers.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  are no articles of adoption or anything of that sort,&#8221; Vincent said; &#8220;it is  possible my brother had some, but at his death all his personal effects were  put into my hands, and I searched in vain for some such documents. But I have  here letters from him and from his wife, which tell in full detail of the  adoption of little Rosemary.</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  may be seen from his marriage certificate, which I have here, my brother was  married in 1904. Here is a letter from him and one from his bride telling my  sister and myself of his marriage. We did not attend the wedding as he was  travelling in France at the time, and was married in Paris.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Here  is a whole packet of letters from both of them, written in the year following.  You may read them at your leisure, Rosemary, and indeed, they are at the  disposal of any one interested. They tell of the happiness of the young couple,  and of their joy in anticipation of the advent of a child.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Later  here are the letters that tell of the birth of a daughter in 1905. And sad  letters follow, telling of the early death of the baby. Soon after that,&#8212;here  is the letter,&#8212;they decided to adopt a little one in hope of easing the heart  of the sorrowing mother.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Visiting  the asylum, they were struck by the beauty and charm of a child of three  years,&#8212;our Rosemary. My sister-in-law preferred a child older than a mere  infant, and, too, they thought she showed a vague likeness to the Vincents.  This explains, Bryce, the resemblance you have noted.</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  the little girl was taken into their home, at first on trial, and then gladly  adopted permanently. I daresay it was because of the temporary arrangement at  first, that papers of adoption were not formally made out. Or it may be that my  brother did not wish them. At any rate, there were none drawn up, and the  little Rosemary simply grew up as the real daughter of her adopted parents. I  do not mean that my brother and his wife pretended she was their own child, or  wished to deceive anybody. But she was as a daughter to them, and when, at her  mother&#8217;s death, Rosemary and her father went to live in Seattle, he said  nothing about her adoption and she passed as his own. All this I learned from  his letters, which were regular though not frequent throughout his life. Then,  when his sudden death occurred, in a frightful motor accident, I went out there  at once, settled up his estate and brought Rosemary home with me.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Knowing  she was ignorant of the truth, my sister and I never told her. Often we talked  it over, often had anxious and worried hours wondering what was our duty, and  how best to tell Rosemary what she must eventually know.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  then my sister was taken from me, and I had to face our family problem alone.  There was but one way open to me. Rosemary has grown to be a woman. No longer a  child, the truth was her due, and she had to have it. No woman would want to be  allowed to marry a man in ignorance of such a truth. No man should be allowed  to marry a woman under such a delusion. Tell me, Rosemary, tell me, Bryce, tell  me, Mr. Prentiss, did I not do right, did I not do my duty, however hard a  task, when I told Rosemary the truth?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent&#8217;s face was troubled, his voice shook a little, but he looked squarely in  the faces of one after another as he awaited their answers.</p>
  <p>Rosemary,  sobbing, could not respond. Bryce Collins, convinced at last, was speechless  with surprise and consternation.</p>
  <p>So  the Burlington Hawkeye answered. He spoke slowly and cautiously.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  suppose, Mr. Vincent, there was no other way to proceed. You are sure of all  you have told us?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  are the letters.&#8221; Homer Vincent spoke wearily, as if worn out by the harrowing  scene. &#8220;As you can see, they are written and posted in Paris on the dates I have  mentioned. Good heavens, man, do you suppose I trumped up this yarn? The  letters bear their truth stamped on their face! I have scores more of my  brother&#8217;s letters, you may compare them&#8212;but,&#8221; his voice dropped to a quieter  key, &#8220;you have only to read those letters from my sister-in-law, to realize  that they are from a heartbroken mother mourning the loss of her own baby, and  later from a cheerful-hearted woman glad in the possession of her adopted  little one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t remember anything about being in the asylum,&#8221; Rosemary said, slowly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t  children remember their experiences at three years old?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  never did,&#8221; Vincent said. &#8220;Your aunt and I frequently quizzed you when you  first came here, to see how far back you could remember. And you never spoke of  anything that happened before you lived with my brother.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  Rosemary said, &#8220;I remember such questionings by you and Antan.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Prentiss  had been reading the letters hastily, but with deep absorption.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course it&#8217;s true,&#8221; he said, throwing down the last one. &#8220;Those letters are too  positively genuine to admit of the slightest doubt. But would you not think  that Mr. Carl Vincent would have made some provision for his adopted daughter  in his will?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  have no doubt he meant to do so,&#8221; Vincent returned. &#8220;But he, like many another  man, postponed the matter, and then death overtook him without warning. But no  one can say that my sister and myself treated Rosemary as other than our own  niece. We have indulged her every whim; given her every luxury, and surrounded  her with all the joys and comforts of a beautiful home. If now, that my sister  is no longer here, and I, myself, am in advancing years,&#8212;if now, I feel that I  cannot have the responsibility of the ordering of the life of a vivacious young  lady,&#8212;it can scarcely be wondered at. And, since I am willing to make generous  provision for her maintenance, and since she is not really a blood-relative of  mine, I feel that I should not be too severely criticized for consulting my own  well-being in the matter.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  you always have done and always will do!&#8221; blurted out Collins. &#8220;You are a  selfish, self-indulgent, self-centered man, Mr. Vincent! You have no sympathy  nor consideration for the helpless girl you thrust from your roof! You!&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  a moment, Mr. Collins. What about yourself? Do you want to marry the nameless  girl you thought was my niece? Do you want to give your children a nameless  mother? Where now are your protestations of love and devotion to Rosemary?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Collins  put a strong, protecting arm round the sobbing girl beside him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;My  love and devotion are stronger than ever,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I do want to marry  her&#8212;and at once. It matters not to me who her parents were&#8212;she is my love&#8212;my  Rosemary!&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky11"></a>Chapter 11 <br>
A Run Over To France</b></h2>
  <p>But  if Bryce Collins was willing to stand by his love and loyalty to his  sweetheart, Rosemary was by no means acquiescent.</p>
  <p>She  positively refused to marry Bryce or to be engaged to him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  will not do,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;Your mother would never agree, and I would never  marry you against her wishes. Oh, Bryce, can&#8217;t you see it as I do? I should be  utterly miserable as your wife, unrecognized,&#8212;or even unwillingly recognized by  your people. I, who have always considered myself a Vincent, whose fine line of  stainless names has been my inspiration as well as my pride, now to find myself  not only no Vincent, but of no known parentage whatever! Bryce, you can&#8217;t  realize what that means to me. My parents may have been anybody&#8212;anybody at all!  I may have in my veins the blood of ignorant, low-bred people, even criminals!  It is appalling,&#8212;I can&#8217;t bear to think of it. But I must think of it,&#8212;I must  face it, and plan my life accordingly. I shall never marry, of that I am  certain. It would be unfair to my husband, unfair to my children. I would be  willing to stay right here with Uncle Homer, and never have any company or go  anywhere. But he won&#8217;t have me. Nobody wants me. I am an outcast, a wanderer on  the face of the earth.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Rosemary  did not say this by way of appealing to Collins&#8217; sympathy, nor was it a mere  dramatic cry on her part. She was thinking aloud more than talking to him, and  she really felt her utter friendliness, loneliness, and homelessness. It was a  cry from her very soul, and it went straight to Collins&#8217; heart.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rosemary,&#8221;  he said, and his thin, dark face was strong with purpose,&#8212;&#8220;I am going to find  your parents. I want you anyway, dear,&#8212;nameless or a Princess Royal,&#8212;it&#8217;s all  the same to me. You are my own Rosemary. But I know, for your own sake, this  thing must be cleared up. And for mine,&#8212;for ours, Rosemary. I know you too well  to believe you are of anything but gentle birth. Such features and mental  traits as yours never belonged to an ignorant or low-born ancestry. I can&#8217;t  help thinking you are a Vincent&#8212;maybe they adopted a cousin or distant  relative&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Bryce, that&#8217;s impossible. Uncle Homer is most clannish and loyal to his  kindred. If I had the slightest claim to the Vincent name, he would stand by  me. And he is standing by me. We must remember, Bryce, that he had to tell me  about this,&#8212;he couldn&#8217;t let me marry you under a name not my own. Could he?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Rosemary, he couldn&#8217;t. I do see that. But his putting you out of the house&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  don&#8217;t know him, Bryce. Uncle Homer is a peculiar man, but his strange ways are  simple, after all. He only asks to be let alone, to enjoy himself in his own  way.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  isn&#8217;t that infernally selfish?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  so much so as you think. He loves his books, his music, his collections of  curios and pictures, and he wants to enjoy them unbothered by people about,  especially young people. He frequently has guests of his own age, and he is a  charming and courteous host. Now, if I were really his niece, really a Vincent,  I might resent his not wanting me here. But when he is so fond of solitude, and  freedom from interruption, when I am not the slightest relation to him, when he  says he is willing to give me a fair allowance,&#8212;why should he feel any further  responsibility for me, or any obligation to let me remain at Greatlarch?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  you put it, Rosemary, it is logical enough, but in all these years he must have  learned to love you&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah,  Bryce, that&#8217;s the worst of it. He didn&#8217;t and it has been my own fault. Antan  loved me, because she sympathized with my gay disposition and love of social  life. But Uncle Homer didn&#8217;t like my everlasting running about, as he called  it, and,&#8212;here&#8217;s the trouble,&#8212;I took no pains to please him, or to give up my  inclinations to his. I was the selfish one, I thought only of my gayeties, my  dances, and my friends, and I ignored Uncle&#8217;s wishes, and even deceived him  often as to my doings. Oh, I was more to blame than he, that he didn&#8217;t love me  as Antan did. And as I sowed the wind, now I am reaping the whirlwind.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Rosemary&#8217;s  lovely, wistful eyes looked into Collins&#8217; own and she shook her head in utter  disapproval of her own past conduct.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell  him you&#8217;ll do differently now. Tell him you&#8217;ll stay at home and look after his  comforts and order his household for him&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  doesn&#8217;t want me or need me,&#8221; Rosemary said, the sad tears filling her eyes. &#8220;Mellish  and Melly can do everything he wants, they know his ways, and they are devotion  itself. The few little things I could do in their absence would not compensate  to Uncle for the bother of having me around. He doesn&#8217;t want me, Bryce, that&#8217;s  all. And as there is no reason why he should have me here, of course I must go.  But where can I go?</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  think I am whining&#8212;or playing the martyr. I hate such a spirit. And I am going  to brace up and bear this thing bravely,&#8212;but, oh, Bryce, it is so hard to bear,  and it came to me so suddenly,&#8212;it was so undreamed of! Don&#8217;t despise me for  giving way to my despair.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Despise  you! My darling&#8212;I love you more every minute!&#8221;</p>
  <p>They  were alone in the living-room, Homer Vincent at the organ on the other side of  the house. They could hear the low strains of mournful music now and then, and  Rosemary knew his soul was troubled.</p>
  <p>But  so was her own, and while Bryce Collins&#8217; love was a solace, yet the very fact  that she must thrust that love away from her made her grief the more poignant.</p>
  <p>He  led her into the embrasure of a south window and took her in his arms.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rosemary,&#8221;  he said, and her lifted face showed white and drawn in the moonlight, &#8220;sweetheart,  I am yours. My heart is devoted to you and to your service. If you will marry  me at once, I will brave my parents&#8217; displeasure, I will marry you under the  name of Rosemary Vincent, and we will go away and establish a home of our own,  where no one shall ever know more about you than that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Bryce, it can&#8217;t be done that way. No minister would marry me by a name to which  I have no right. Oh, I wish Uncle had told me long ago. I wish my father had  told me&#8212;Bryce, he couldn&#8217;t have been more like a real father if I had been born  his child! He loved me with a true fatherly affection&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  we know he was not your father, dear. There&#8217;s no getting away from those  letters. Is there?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  I&#8217;ve read them all over and over. They&#8217;re true as Gospel.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,  let&#8217;s face facts. If you won&#8217;t,&#8212;if you can&#8217;t marry me now, we must find a nice,  snug home for you, and I shall set about finding out your history.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  can&#8217;t do that, Bryce.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t  I? Well, I can make a pretty big stab at it! Do you happen to know, my little  love, that your future husband has quite some persistency? Quite some of what is  known as bulldog stick-to-it-ativeness! And what I set out to do, I most  generally sometimes always accomplish! So, dear little girl, try to possess  your soul in patience till your ardent cavalier can run over to France and back  and then we&#8217;ll see what we shall see!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;To  France! You can&#8217;t mean it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I do mean it, and if you&#8217;ll go, I&#8217;ll take you with me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Bryce, we can&#8217;t marry. On that point I&#8217;m positive.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  then, it&#8217;s merely a postponed wedding. Don&#8217;t you dare fall in love with any one  else while I&#8217;m gone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>For  answer Rosemary put her soft arms round his neck and kissed him voluntarily. It  was the first time she had ever done so, and Collins clasped her close.</p>
  <p>&#8220;My  little girl,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;my darling little girl, with your love to look  forward to, with you to win, I can do anything! accomplish any task. I shall go  to the asylum where you were adopted, and I haven&#8217;t the slightest doubt that I  can trace your parentage. Of course they have records, and I shall insist on  seeing them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  afraid, Bryce,&#8212;afraid of what you may find out&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  will ask you, mademoiselle, to have more respect for my future wife! I allow no  one, not even you, to imply the least disparagement of her birth or breeding.  So, kindly refrain from such comment! When I return from my quest I will  announce to you the details of her illustrious lineage!&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  Rosemary was not comforted by Collins&#8217; gay chatter. She had a foreboding that  his investigation, if he really made one, might bring to light more and worse  facts than those already known. For, poor Rosemary thought, people don&#8217;t put  their children in orphan asylums if everything is all right and proper.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  awful, Bryce,&#8221; she said, &#8220;not to have the least idea whether you&#8217;re the child  of decent people, or scum of the earth!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  talk like that, dear. The suspense, the uncertainty is awful,&#8212;oh, I appreciate  your feelings, darling, but these conditions we have to face, and we must face  them bravely. Now, I shall get from Mr. Vincent all the addresses of the asylum  in question and the various residences of your adopted parents while they  remained in France, and then, if necessary, I shall follow up your father&#8217;s  removal to Seattle, and go there to learn what I can.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  never can trace it, Bryce, you can&#8217;t delve into matters so far back, as you  might do if the dates were later. The war, doubtless, caused the loss of lots  of records and statistics, and you never can get the truth from those old  archives.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  my little Cassandra, no more of these dismal forebodings. No more cold water to  be thrown on my projects,&#8212;if you please. And I&#8217;ll tell you another thing. After  I get you all straightened out as to vital statistics, I&#8217;m going to devote my  energies to tracking down the murderer of your aunt. I don&#8217;t believe those  addle-pated policemen will ever get anywhere. Oh, yes, I know that Burlington  man is alert and promises well. But if he doesn&#8217;t succeed in getting at the  bottom of the mystery, I will! Now, my little love, do you begin to realize  what a determined man you&#8217;ve got to put up with for the rest of your life? Just  as soon as I get matters fixed up to my liking you&#8217;ll be wooed and married and  to a tyrant worse than any feudal lord you ever read about in mediaeval  history!&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  Rosemary was not deceived by his banter. She knew he meant it all, but she knew  the obstacles in his path, and without unnecessary doubt she clearly foresaw  the opposition his plans would receive from his own people.</p>
  <p>Bryce  Collins had an independent fortune left him by his grandfather, but it was not  large enough to preclude his having a business of his own. Nor did he mean to  go through life without working and earning. But now, fired with enthusiasm  over these new plans of his, he proposed to use his inheritance and postpone  his business career, which, naturally, would not seem wise to his parents.</p>
  <p>And  Collins was a devoted son, and on the best of terms with his family. Also his  mother admired Rosemary, and was glad at the hope of an alliance between her  son and the Vincent family. But in view of the new developments, Bryce Collins  well knew the quick turn that his mother&#8217;s inclinations would take.</p>
  <p>With  his volatile nature, however, he put from him all unpleasant anticipations, and  gave himself up to the joy of being with Rosemary and of comforting her by his  presence and by his love, in spite of her forebodings.</p>
  <p>When  Collins detailed his plans to Homer Vincent, he was given a patient and  thoughtful hearing.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  propose to go to France and to Seattle both?&#8221; Vincent asked, for the young man&#8217;s  enthusiastic statements were a bit incoherent.</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  necessary, sir. You see, I must get at the truth of things. I mean I must find  out who were the real parents of Rosemary.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  not afraid of what that discovery may mean&#8212;to you&#8212;and to her?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  thought about that, Mr. Vincent, and it seems to me the truth, however  disappointing, will be better than ignorance. If Rosemary is of decent and  legitimate birth, I don&#8217;t care how lowly her origin. If, however, she is of  disgraceful ancestry, then I shall take her away from here to some distant  place, and try to make her forget it all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Bryce  Collins&#8217; young face was somber and his strong jaw was sternly set in his  intensity of purpose.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  are taking a fine stand, Collins,&#8221; Homer Vincent said, &#8220;and I admire your pluck  and your loyalty to Rosemary. But my advice would be to let sleeping dogs lie.  Aside from the fact that a trip to France at this late date would in all  probability be a wild-goose chase, there is also an even chance that your  discoveries, if you make any, will be disappointing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  is your advice, then, sir?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know what to say. But, though I&#8217;m not at all sure it&#8217;s right, I would be  willing to ignore the whole matter of Rosemary&#8217;s birth and, if you are willing,  let her marry you as Rosemary Vincent, my niece.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Does  no one else know the truth?&#8221; Collins was thinking quickly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only  the detective, Prentiss. I believe, in her frenzied surprise the girl told him.  But I&#8217;m sure we can pledge him to secrecy. You understand, Collins, I never  would have let her marry you as my niece without telling you both the truth.  But since you know it, if you care to adopt such a course, I will do my part. I  will give her a wedding, small and quiet, of course, as the house is in  mourning, and I will never divulge the secret of her adoption.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Collins  thought this over.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know what to say, Mr. Vincent,&#8221; he said, at last. &#8220;I confess I am tempted  to do this thing. It is the line of least resistance, and quite the simplest  way out of our difficulty. But, beside the question of Rosemary and myself, we  must think of our possible children. You know as well as I do that, while in  America ancestry and lineage is not looked upon as it is in England, yet if, in  time to come, there should be discovered any stigma on my wife&#8217;s name, is it a  fair deal to the innocent babes who may be born to us?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is a question for your own consideration, Bryce.&#8221; Vincent spoke gravely. &#8220;I  feel strongly about family ties myself. I admit I have never felt toward  Rosemary as I should have felt toward a child of my brother&#8217;s own. But it is  too hard on her to tell her these things. She is a sweet, sensitive nature,&#8212;a  dear girl in every way. But she is not my kin. Yet, as I said, I will keep her  secret, if you wish me to.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No!&#8221;  and Collins&#8217; face took on a look of even sterner determination. &#8220;No, I cannot  do it. I love Rosemary too well, too deeply, not to try, at least, to vindicate  her claim to honor and right. I shall go on my quest,&#8212;at most, it will not take  me more than about a month, and I shall find out something,&#8212;or learn that  nothing can be found out. In the latter case, I will, perhaps, give your  proposition further consideration. I will ask you to keep the secret until my  return. Can you&#8212;will you do this?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  will if I can. But since Prentiss knows it, it is in danger of further  publicity. What is your project, in detail?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  planned nothing further than to go to that asylum from which Rosemary was  taken. You have the address of that, have you not?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  and all the addresses of my brother&#8217;s residences in Paris and some suburban  towns. They moved two or three times. You will, of course, return here before  going to Seattle, if you conclude to go there?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  and I hope I shall not have to go out there. But I know there is no use in  writing to these places, or sending any sort of an emissary. Only my own  desperate determination can accomplish my ends, if indeed I can accomplish them  at all. Now, another thing. May not Rosemary stay here with you until my  return? I cannot think you will turn her from your door.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  isn&#8217;t exactly turning her out,&#8221; Vincent said, looking troubled. &#8220;But,&#8212;well, as  man to man. Collins, I may as well admit that I&#8217;m what is knows as a  woman-hater. I loved my dear sister, but I have never cared for any other  woman, and I long for a home without a woman in it,&#8212;except as a servant This  may seem strange to you,&#8212;perhaps it is strange. But you must realize that alone  in my home I can pursue my own avocations, I can have things just as I want  them, I can have the uninterrupted solitude that I love; when, with Rosemary  here, the whole atmosphere is changed, the whole house on a different basis.  This is really not unreasonable; I am aging, I am a bit eccentric, I have  suffered a terrible tragedy, and I have no real responsibility toward my  brother&#8217;s adopted child, outside of her financial maintenance; and, so, I hold  that it is not my bounden duty to keep Rosemary here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is all true, but won&#8217;t you consent, even to keep her here until my return? You&#8217;ve  promised to keep her secret until then&#8212;if you can. Surely to send her away  would rouse suspicion against her of some sort. I am sure she will agree to  annoy you by her presence as little as possible. She can keep out of your way&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  don&#8217;t make me out an ogre!&#8221; Vincent exclaimed. &#8220;Of course, she can stay  here&#8212;for a month or two. As I have had her here for five years&#8212;but, you see,  Bryce, it was very different when my sister was here. She stood between me and  any nuisance the girl might have been. She kept Rosemary in a sort of  subjection, which I see now, with her aunt&#8217;s restraint missing, has utterly  vanished. She permeates the household,&#8212;unconsciously, of course, but breezily,  noisily, as any young girl would. I can&#8217;t deny her the visits of her young  friends entirely, yet when they come they are laughing and chattering all over  the house, and it annoys me frightfully. Absurd, you would say. But you can&#8217;t  realize the difference between the viewpoint of an enthusiastic young fellow  and a world-weary, hermit-souled old man.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  far from an old man, Mr. Vincent, but I do understand what you mean, and I can  see it from your point of view. And I realize that if Rosemary were really your  niece, things would be very different. However, I&#8217;m going to hold you to your  agreement that she may stay here a month or so, until I can run over to Paris  and back. Then&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Collins,  I&#8217;m not sure I ought to say this,&#8212;and yet, it&#8217;s only fair to warn you of even a  remote possibility. You know, those detectives have no theory, no idea of how  my sister&#8217;s murder was accomplished. Nor have I, for that matter. But since we  know it was accomplished, since some murderer did, somehow, gain access to that  locked room, and get out again, we must assume some diabolically clever  criminal. Now, you must not overlook the possibility that it may have been some  one of Rosemary&#8217;s relatives,&#8212;some one who has watched over her career,  secretly, meaning to profit in some wicked way by the girl&#8217;s good fortune. This  may seem far-fetched, but what theory does not seem so? At any rate, suppose  the murderer of my sister should turn out to be some evil-minded relative of  Rosemary&#8217;s real parents, do you want to delve into the matter?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I do. Even though there is a possibility of what you suggest, I deem it so  remote a one that it is almost negligible. I have determined to go to France; I  shall tell my people it is merely a travel tour, they will raise no objection.  And I will ask you to preserve Rosemary&#8217;s secret, in so far as you can. Your  definite request will ensure Prentiss&#8217; silence, I am certain. And, Mr. Vincent,  if your hinted theory should prove true, at least you will have achieved the  solution of the mystery of Miss Anne&#8217;s terrible death. It is one of my  strongest desires to avenge her memory, and once the matter of Rosemary&#8217;s birth  is settled, I shall turn my attention to the murder tragedy, if it has not by  that time been discovered.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  are a determined man, Bryce, and while I admire your indomitable perseverance,  I wish I felt more faith in your success. I doubt your making any discoveries  at all in France, but if you are bent on going, I will give you all those old  addresses, and letters, if you want them, to various people who may help you in  your search. In all probability the asylum will have the old records of  Rosemary&#8217;s adoption by my brother, but will they have the statistics to prove  who her own parents were? Still, as I said, I will give you all these  documents, if you are bent on going.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am bent on going,&#8221; said Bryce Collins.</p>
  <p>And  go he did. Obstacles fell before him like grain before the reaper. His  determination was so strong, his will so powerful, that he made his departure  possible and speedy.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  knew his errand, and imbued with his own hopefulness, she bade him Godspeed.</p>
  <p>But  she did not know she remained at Greatlarch only on sufferance and because of  Collins&#8217; insistent plea to her uncle.</p>
  <p>Vincent  treated her kindly but with no words of love or sympathy. Indeed, his words  were few and his manner self-absorbed and often seeming utterly oblivious to  her presence.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  did not resent this. She quite understood her uncle&#8217;s attitude toward her, she  well knew his distaste for her presence. And she felt, at times, that she would  gladly go away. But the charm of the place, and her great love for it, held her  there, as well as her ignorance of the world and her feeling of inability to  face its unknown and perhaps unfriendly possibilities.</p>
  <p>She  wrote notes to Lulie Eaton and a few other girl friends, asking them not to  come to see her for the present. And she gave Mellish orders to admit none of  the young men who came to call on her.</p>
  <p>She  was determined to think things out for herself, but she could not do this all  at once. It was all so new and unaccustomed,&#8212;this thinking for herself. All her  life her plans had been made for her, in important matters. She had willingly  acquiesced in all Antan&#8217;s advices, knowing that the aunt who loved her would  give all the liberty and pleasure that could be hers.</p>
  <p>And  now, she had no one to whom to turn for advice or for information. Even  Prentiss, who was friendly, was away on his investigations in New York.</p>
  <p>There  remained only the two Mellishes and little Francine.</p>
  <p>Reduced  to the society of servants or none at all, Rosemary did talk over her affairs  with good Susan Mellish.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never  fear, dearie,&#8221; that kind woman said; &#8220;it&#8217;ll all come out right. Your uncle is  for now that worrited there&#8217;s no doing anything with him. But these detective  men, they&#8217;ll find out the wicked villain and they&#8217;ll hang him high! Or, what&#8217;s  more belike, they&#8217;ll find there was no mortal murderer, and then they&#8217;ll know  where to look!&#8221;</p>
  <p>For  Mrs. Mellish was strong in her belief that the hand that slew Anne Vincent was  the phantom hand of the dead Mrs. Lamont.</p>
  <p>And  there were those who agreed with her.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky12"></a>Chapter 12 <br>
A Nameless, Homeless Waif</b></h2>
  <p>Although  Prentiss had gone to New York in search of information concerning Johnson, the  local police of Hilldale were by no means idle.</p>
  <p>They  searched and researched the premises of Greatlarch, both in the house and about  the grounds. The room that Johnson had occupied they studied over and over, in  their efforts to learn something further of the man&#8217;s personality. They left  his few belongings where they found them, deducing nothing beyond the general  facts of a business man on a hasty trip.</p>
  <p>The  entire absence of letters or personal papers was peculiar in itself, but there  was no conclusion to be drawn from it. The fact that his clothing was new and  unmarked was thought to be a suspicious circumstance, but it led to no definite  suspicion.</p>
  <p>It  was a favorite remark among the detectives that Sherlock Holmes could have  deduced the whole man from his few articles of luggage, but Sherlock Holmes was  not there, and the men who were there only looked at the things blankly and  without inspiration.</p>
  <p>The  same with Miss Anne Vincent&#8217;s room.</p>
  <p>Day  after day they surveyed the beautiful appointments there. Again and again they  drew back the heavy silk hangings that fell round the head of the bed and  scanned the bed anew. The sheets with their crimson stains had been removed,  but were still kept at the Police Station as possible evidence.</p>
  <p>The  wall safe, from which the great ruby had presumably been stolen, was examined  frequently, and all the details of Miss Anne&#8217;s personal belongings had been  studied to no avail whatsoever.</p>
  <p>There  were the two rooms, one above the other, the rooms, all agreed, of victim and  criminal, yet from neither room could a single fact be deduced that was of  helpful significance.</p>
  <p>Police  reconstruction of the crime,&#8212;for they took no cognizance of suicide or of  spooks,&#8212;set forth that Johnson had spent the entire night in preparation for  his crime, and in waiting for dawn to bring his chosen moment. That he had, as  soon as the watchman went indoors, unlocked Miss Anne&#8217;s door with some clever  sort of key, had killed the lady, stolen the ruby, and then, relocking the door  with his patent contraption, had easily made his way out of the front door,  when the family were still asleep and the servants busy in the kitchen  quarters.</p>
  <p>Almost  superhuman cleverness they conceded this criminal, but, they argued, only such  diabolical ingenuity could have perpetrated such a mysterious crime.</p>
  <p>Their  decisions were arrived at by elimination. There was no other suspect, there was  no other means of procedure. The only thing to do was to catch the man. This,  they hoped, Prentiss would accomplish.</p>
  <p>But  the Burlington Hawkeye returned from an unsuccessful search.</p>
  <p>His  report, given to Homer Vincent, in the presence of Brewster and Brown, was  disappointing in the extreme.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  isn&#8217;t any Henry Johnson,&#8221; he declared, looking both crestfallen and defiant at  once. &#8220;I went to the address you gave me, Mr. Vincent,&#8212;the address he gave you,  and they declared they never had heard of him there. Then I visited those two  jewelry firms, of which he left you the cards, and they said they had never  heard of any Henry Johnson in connection with ruby manufacturing. They spoke of  a Mr. Markham or Markheim who made synthetic rubies, but that was of no  interest to me. I begged them to search their books and records to find Johnson&#8217;s  name. They were most obliging but utterly unsuccessful.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  else did you do?&#8221; Brewster asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  lots of things. I went to the stores where he must have bought his coat and  hat, but I couldn&#8217;t trace any sale. This is not to be wondered at, of course. I  only tried it on a chance. But that umbrella, now. That is a new one. I wish I  had taken it with me. However, I went to the store it came from and asked what  monograms they had put on umbrellas recently. Not an H. J. amongst them! As I  say, I didn&#8217;t really hope to find out these things, but I took a chance.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  did well, Mr. Prentiss,&#8221; Homer Vincent assured him. &#8220;Where there&#8217;s nothing to  find out, you can&#8217;t, of course, find out anything. But I&#8217;m surprised that the  jewelry firms repudiated all knowledge of him. Do you suppose he was entirely a  fake? Do you suppose he came here merely to rob and murder, and that the ruby  story was all made up?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do suppose just that, Mr. Vincent,&#8221; Brewster declared. &#8220;And probably his name  wasn&#8217;t Johnson at all&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s  the umbrella,&#8221; put in Prentiss.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know,&#8221; Brewster assented, &#8220;but that may have been made for a Hiram Judkins or a  Hugh Jennings.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  so,&#8221; said Vincent, thoughtfully. &#8220;Or perhaps he stole the umbrella somewhere.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  the umbrella gets us nowhere,&#8221; and Prentiss sighed. &#8220;I feel as if I&#8217;d  accomplished nothing, and yet it is something to have learned that the Johnson  name was assumed&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  necessarily,&#8221; objected Brown. &#8220;You see, he may be named Henry Johnson all  right, and yet have made up all the ruby business.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  he came here with intent to rob and murder, he most certainly didn&#8217;t announce  his true name,&#8221; Brewster declared, and his words carried conviction.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,&#8221;  Vincent summed up, &#8220;we have a criminal with a definite purpose, who came under  an assumed name, and carried out his plans successfully to the smallest detail.  I remember, now, his asking me rather particularly as to the watchman&#8217;s rounds  and all that. But, of course, I never suspected anything wrong.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course not,&#8221; Prentiss said. &#8220;Now I&#8217;d like to see that butler of yours again.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221;  said Vincent, and rang for Mellish.</p>
  <p>That  worthy came in, and contrary to his habitual calm, he exhibited a hint of  suppressed excitement.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Will  you look what Hoskins found, sir,&#8221; he said, holding out his hand toward  Vincent.</p>
  <p>As  all could see, he held a long amber and ivory cigarette-holder.</p>
  <p>It  was one of those extremely long ones that are affected by the ultrafashionable.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  was this found?&#8221; Vincent asked, looking at it attentively, and then passing it  over to Prentiss.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hoskins  found it, sir, out in the grounds. Or maybe the gardener found it and gave it  to Hoskins. But it&#8217;s the one Mr. Johnson used, sir, and I opine he lost it as  he hurried on his way.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  remember it?&#8221; Prentiss inquired of the butler.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, sir. I noticed it when Mr. Johnson used it at the table, sir. After  dinner, he took no cigar, but took a cigarette, which he fitted into that  outlandish thing, sir!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mellish&#8217;s  scorn of the eccentric implement was evident on his face.</p>
  <p>&#8220;They&#8217;re  quite fashionable now,&#8212;I&#8217;ve seen them in use,&#8221; said Brown, with an air of wide  experience. &#8220;And see, here&#8217;s the H. J. monogram again! The fellow&#8217;s initials  must be H. J. whether his name is Henry Johnson or not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Unless  he stole this thing and the umbrella from the same party,&#8221; argued Prentiss. &#8220;Wonder  if we could trace the cigarette-holder. It looks rather valuable, and a  specialty shop, where such a thing was doubtless bought, might remember the  buyer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Keep  it carefully,&#8221; Brewster admonished him; &#8220;it&#8217;s a good bit of evidence,&#8212;maybe a  real clue! Where was it found, exactly?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know the precise spot,&#8221; Mellish said; &#8220;but I opine it was somewhere on  the east lawn. The gardener is working there to-day.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Would  that be on his way out of the grounds?&#8221; Brown inquired.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  might be,&#8221; Vincent returned, slowly. &#8220;Or, he may have been walking about  outside&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Killing  time until the dawn broke!&#8221; Brown exclaimed. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sure we can get a line  from that thing. It&#8217;s most unusual,&#8212;not common at all&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  go down to New York then, on this errand,&#8221; Prentiss said; &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go  right back there.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; Brown agreed, rather liking the idea.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  I thought, Mr. Vincent,&#8221; Prentiss continued, &#8220;you might recall some more data  about the synthetic rubies. You see, even if he faked that whole ruby  proposition, at least he must have known enough about the matter to make a good  showing before you and your sister. You would have known if he had been a mere  layman. He couldn&#8217;t have made you believe he was an expert without knowing a  good deal about the processes and all that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  true,&#8221; Vincent agreed. &#8220;But, knowing little or nothing of the subject myself, I  daresay I was not in a position to be critical of his explanations and  descriptions.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  opine,&#8221; Mellish said, speaking deferentially but with a look of pride at his  master, &#8220;that Mr. Vincent is not so ignorant of these things. You remember, sir,  there was another gentleman here not more than a month ago, who also wanted to  interest you in the making of imitation rubies.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  yes, that&#8217;s so,&#8221; Vincent said; &#8220;I had forgotten that. But I daresay the market  is full of such things. The process, recently invented,&#8212;or perhaps I should say  discovered,&#8212;has doubtless been taken up by various would-be lapidaries. Well,  does all this get you anywhere, Mr. Prentiss?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We  have only one goal, sir, the whereabouts of the man who called himself Henry  Johnson, whether that is his true name or not. I think no one can doubt he  killed Miss Vincent, even though we cannot yet determine his exact method. But  given this mysterious visitor, his mysterious disappearance, and the immediate  discovery of the robbery and murder, we cannot think otherwise than that he is  the criminal. He may not have intended murder, in the beginning. He may have  used the ruby chatter to induce Miss Vincent to exhibit her splendid jewel,&#8212;of  which he must have known,&#8212;and then, when he endeavored to steal it and make  away, very possibly she awoke and would have made an outcry, had he not  silenced her. Burglars often commit murder because of a sudden danger of  exposure.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is all true, Mr. Prentiss,&#8221; Vincent agreed; &#8220;I had not thought of that sequence  of events at my sister&#8217;s bedside. It may well have been just as you suggest.  Granting his ability to get in and out of that room,&#8212;and you have suggested an  explanation of that,&#8212;I feel sure there can be no doubt of Johnson&#8217;s guilt Now,  we must find him. It is imperative. Can any one suggest any further or more  far-reaching plan?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is hard to circumvent such fiendish ingenuity as that man has showed.&#8221; Brown  spoke vindictively. &#8220;We have, of course, inquired at all the near-by railway  stations. I assumed he might have walked to some one of them and boarded a  train there. But we find no trace of such a thing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;More  likely,&#8221; Brewster said, &#8220;he walked to a near-by town, and after a rest and a  breakfast walked on to another, and so on, until he was far enough away to take  a train without fear of detection. In a large town he could do that, but not in  one of our small villages.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  are many ways he could escape,&#8221; said Vincent, looking wearied, as if tired of  their futile conversation. &#8220;He could lie low for hours anywhere, and then go on  by night. Or he could beg a ride in a passing motor, or in a farmer&#8217;s cart, At  any rate, he did get away, he did get beyond our ken, and if we find him, it  will not be by simple search, but by some deduction or conclusion based on some  bit of evidence. I know little of these things myself, but I supposed  detectives worked from small clues.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We  are supposed to,&#8221; Prentiss declared, frankly, &#8220;but I must confess there are  fewer clues in evidence in this case than in any I ever saw before.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s  this,&#8221; and Brown held up the long cigarette-holder.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  agreed Vincent, &#8220;there&#8217;s that. Now, that&#8217;s just the sort of thing I mean. Can&#8217;t  you experts gather anything from that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  gather that he had sharp teeth,&#8221; Brown said, smiling a little, &#8220;for the amber  mouthpiece is a good deal scratched.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  did have strong teeth,&#8221; Vincent remarked, &#8220;and very white ones. But I can&#8217;t see  how that will help you to find him. Perhaps, after all, you may have to give it  up, and put it down among the unsolved mysteries of history.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  yet,&#8221; Prentiss declared. &#8220;I&#8217;m by no means ready to lie down on the job, and if  Mr. Brown will run down to the city and try to trace the fancy cigarette  doodaddle, I&#8217;ll try some few little man&#339;uvres I have in mind up here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Try  all you like, gentlemen,&#8221; Vincent directed them. &#8220;Use every effort, call upon  me for whatever money you need. I will refuse no sum in reason to bring about  the discovery of my sister&#8217;s assassin. But, I must ask you to report to me only  when you have some worthwhile news. This interview to-day was, of course,  necessary, but until you have equally important information, continue your  search by yourselves, or report to me through Mellish here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  detectives, of course, agreed, and the interview was brought to a close.</p>
  <p>At  dinner that night, Rosemary asked her uncle what the detectives had  accomplished.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very  little,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;They have concluded Henry Johnson killed your aunt,  which we were practically certain of all along. They have learned, they think,  that Henry Johnson was an assumed name, which is an obvious conclusion. They  have practically admitted that they have doubts of being able to find him,  which is no surprise to me. The murderer in this, as in most cases, is far  cleverer than the detectives, and can, of course, easily outwit them. A  criminal who can plan and carry out such a scheme as this man has done is no  ordinary evildoer. He is a genius in crime, and such are not usually  apprehended. Now, let us drop the subject, Rosemary, for I have had all I can  stand of it for one day.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  subject remained dropped between the two, for there were no new developments to  bring the detectives for another report to Vincent.</p>
  <p>They  were continuing their efforts to find Johnson, they were hunting for new clues  or evidence, but all their endeavors were futile.</p>
  <p>Even  Brown&#8217;s assiduous hunt for the shop where the cigarette-holder had been bought  was to no avail. Such holders he found, but could get hold of no dealer who had  monogrammed that one.</p>
  <p>Days  at Greatlarch followed one another in much the same routine as before the  tragedy. The household routine, that is. The two Mellishes and their  under-servants admirably kept up the high standards that Miss Anne had  instilled in the <i>mnage,</i> but the  family, as represented by Homer Vincent and Rosemary, was far from a happy one.</p>
  <p>Each  day, it seemed to the girl, her uncle grew more and more reserved, more  absorbed in his books and music. She did not resent this, in a way it was a  relief not to have to entertain him, but Rosemary was very lonely and very sad.</p>
  <p>It  was on one of their silent evenings, when Vincent mused over a book and  Rosemary tried to interest herself in a bit of needlework, that he said:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Child,  have you any belief in spiritualism?&#8221; His tone was gentler, more interested,  than common, and Rosemary hesitated before she answered. She didn&#8217;t want to  express herself contrary to his own views, and yet the girl had never felt any  faith in the supernatural.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Table-tipping  or spooks?&#8221; she said, trying to turn it off lightly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  be flippant. I mean this idea of Mrs. Lamont returning to the scene of her  tragic death.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  that. No, Uncle, I can&#8217;t say I do believe she does that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  yet it may be. Why may not the souls of the dead return?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  they may, but I&#8217;ve never seen any evidence of it, have you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  would you say if I said, Yes, I have?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;d  say, Tell me all about it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  subject was a distasteful one to Rosemary, but she would willingly have talked  on any topic, so glad was she to have her uncle talk to her at all.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  a queer thing happened last night,&#8221; he began. &#8220;I was wakened out of a sound  sleep by a sort of light in my room. A strange, hovering light, that seemed to  sway and waver and at last shaped itself into the semblance of a human form.  Rosemary, it was your Aunt Anne.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  child, it surely was. I felt no fear; she waved a gentle hand as she came  nearer to me. &#8216;Brother,&#8217; she said, &#8216;it is all right. Do not seek my slayer, I am  happy in my new life.&#8217; And then, Rosemary, she seemed to vanish slowly, and as  the phantom shape was nearly gone, I heard a few more fleeting words, that  sounded like a promise to play the Wild Harp tonight.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tonight!  Antan! Oh, Uncle Homer! You believe it was really her spirit?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  the harp plays tonight and I hear it&#8212;I shall have to believe,&#8221; he replied, in a  solemn tone.</p>
  <p>And  that night the Wild Harp did play. Rosemary was awakened soon after midnight by  the low, wailing strains. She wondered if her uncle heard it, too.</p>
  <p>She  lay in her bed listening to the weird music, and wondering if it could be  possible her dead aunt was responsible for it.</p>
  <p>She  could not believe it, nor could she believe it was the work of the spirit of  Mrs. Lamont.</p>
  <p>But  then, she asked herself, what is it? What can it be?</p>
  <p>She  rang a bedside bell which brought Francine to her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  is it, mademoiselle?&#8221; asked the French girl. &#8220;What is it that I can do for you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Listen,  Francine, do you hear the Wild Harp?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, ma&#8217;am. Is it not beautiful&#8212;so faint, so sweet!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  is playing it, Francine?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Rosemary  fully expected the girl would assert it to be a phantom that made the  harmonies. But, to her surprise, Francine said, &#8220;Of a truth, I do not know,&#8212;but  I think it is Mr. Mellish.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nonsense!  Go to bed!&#8221; and Rosemary had to smile at the girl&#8217;s foolishness.</p>
  <p>But  the next morning she referred to it before her uncle.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Rosemary, I heard it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I believe it was the spirit of your aunt  who made the music. Do not you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Uncle, to be truthful, I do not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  Rosemary regretted her frankness, for Homer Vincent turned grim and moody and  scarcely spoke again that day.</p>
  <p>But  at last came the news of Bryce Collins&#8217; arrival in New York, and Rosemary&#8217;s  heart beat high with hope and joy.</p>
  <p>His  letters had given no hints as to the results of his quest, but he had written  that he had results, which he would detail on his return.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  eagerly desired to accept this as an omen of favorable news, but her  forebodings were not happy ones and she felt an undercurrent of despair that  grew stronger as the time of his homecoming drew near.</p>
  <p>And  when at last she saw him, when he came to Greatlarch, and, taking her in his  arms, kissed her gently, she knew in her heart that his tidings were not happy  ones.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell  it at once, Bryce,&#8221; Homer Vincent said, curtly. &#8220;I know from your manner you  bring no good news.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do not,&#8221; Collins said, his face dark with sorrow and his eyes sad and somber. &#8220;Yes,  I will tell you at once, but do not hurry me, Mr. Vincent. I will tell you as  it happened to me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  found the asylum?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  with no trouble at all. But it was not at the address you gave me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah,  they have moved?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps  so; but they told me they had never been at the other address. However, I found  them. They have full and complete records,&#8212;they willingly let me study them.  The present head of the institution is not, of course, the one who was there  when Rosemary was left there. Nor is he the immediate successor. They have had  several in his place, as the years went by.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  found the entry of Rosemary&#8217;s admission to the asylum?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I did. And I learned,&#8212;this is the strange part,&#8212;that she was placed there by  your brother Carl.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Before  his marriage?&#8221; Homer Vincent fairly blurted out the words.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  two years before.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  that means&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  is no use blinking the facts. It means that Rosemary is the child of your  brother Carl, but was not born in wedlock.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;An  illegitimate daughter of my brother&#8212;then a Vincent after all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  a nameless, homeless waif,&#8221; Rosemary moaned, and as she swayed from her chair,  Collins ran to catch her fainting form and held her in his arms.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  all right,&#8221; she said, struggling to preserve her self-control; &#8220;only it seems  this last blow is more than I can bear. Uncle Homer, I will leave your house  tomorrow. You shall not be burdened with the disgrace of a nameless child,&#8212;a  child of shame!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  was her mother?&#8221; Vincent asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is not known,&#8221; Collins replied. &#8220;The records so far back are imperfect. And I  could find no one who remembered the circumstance. All the attendants are  changed since that time. It was by the merest chance I came across the book  that contained the entry of her admission. There was no mistake about that. She  was left there by Carl Vincent, an American citizen travelling for pleasure.  Her birth-date was given and her name stated as Rosemary Vincent.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  two years later, my brother and his wife adopted this child,&#8212;the daughter of my  brother!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Three  years later. After he had been married a year.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  cannot stand it,&#8221; Rosemary cried, and without another word, she fled from the  room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  is no doubt about this?&#8221; Vincent asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  the slightest,&#8221; replied Collins, hopelessly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  is to be done?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do not know.&#8221;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky13"></a>Chapter 13 <br>
A Vincent After All</b></h2>
  <p>After  the news brought home from France by Bryce Collins and after a day&#8217;s reflection  on the matter, Homer Vincent called Rosemary to him in his Tower room.</p>
  <p>The  girl gave him a curious glance. Her own attitude in the matter had changed. She  was still downcast and despairing because of her illegitimate birth and her nameless  condition. But she had most loving memories of her father, and it was a deep  consolation to know he was really her father even though she had no  acknowledged mother.</p>
  <p>Rosemary&#8217;s  life had been a sheltered one. During her first years with her adopted mother,  during the succeeding term of years with her father, and, later, with the  Vincents at Greatlarch, the girl had been kept carefully from companions save  such as her elders deemed wise for her.</p>
  <p>She  had never attended public schools, never mixed with uneducated or unrefined  people, and really knew little of the gossip or scandals of society.</p>
  <p>Anne  Vincent had never talked with her of immoral conditions or events, and  Rosemary, while blankly wondering just how bad it was to be illegitimate, was  yet gladdened at heart by the realization that at any rate she was a Vincent.</p>
  <p>But  she was destined to a rude awakening when Homer Vincent told her in a few words  how hopeless and irremediable was her fate.</p>
  <p>He  was not unkind in his manner, he was rather pitying and sympathetic. But he  explained that she could never hope to marry, that to transmit such a stigma to  children would be out of the question, and, moreover, no man, knowing the  truth, would be willing to marry her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Bryce  would,&#8221; she said, her red lips quivering with emotion, but her little head held  high, in a sort of bravado.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  he would not. You&#8217;ll see. He said he would when he thought you were adopted by  my brother, and born of respectable though humble parents. That&#8217;s what he went  to France to see about, and thereby learned the whole unpleasant truth. No,  Rosemary, neither Bryce Collins nor any other self-respecting young man will  marry a girl who was born out of wedlock.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Rosemary&#8217;s  despair returned. Her long dark lashes drooped over her sad eyes and her whole  figure relaxed into an attitude of utter dejection.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  can I do?&#8221; she murmured, her voice tragically sad.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  will be cared for,&#8221; Vincent replied. But he sighed deeply and looked at the  girl as if she were indeed an unwelcome responsibility.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  see,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;now that I am led to believe that you are the child of my  brother, I cannot turn you away. When I thought you merely his adopted child  and the offspring of unknown parents, I had no real family interest in your  welfare. But if you are my brother&#8217;s child, you are a Vincent, even though not  a legitimate member of the family.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  so, I propose to keep you here with me,&#8212;at least so long as I find you  tractable and amenable to my wishes. I think you will not expect to hold your  position as a daughter of the house, but neither shall I allow you to be  slighted or scorned in any way. If you have good common sense, Rosemary, you  will accept the anomalous position that is now yours and you will be thankful  that you have a home and a protector here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I do! Oh, Uncle Homer, how good you are to me. I can never thank you&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There,  there, no histrionics, if you please. You can easily thank me, by the mere  observance of my wishes. You know those already,&#8212;you know, that though I may be  eccentric, my odd ways are not really very dreadful. You know all I want is a  quiet, peaceful home, and if you devote your life,&#8212;as you probably will prefer  to do,&#8212;to some such pursuit as study or philanthropic effort, you will make no  disturbance in the household and you will have ample time to look after such  matters as tend toward my peculiar desires and exactions.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Rosemary  looked thoughtful. She fully realized her position, fully appreciated her uncle&#8217;s  kindness and generosity, but she was young and of a pleasure-loving, vivid  temperament. She could not foresee happiness in this humdrum existence he  proposed. It was all very well for Antan, who was of a quiet, indolent nature.</p>
  <p>But  for Rosemary to be at home day in and day out, occupied in household duties or  philanthropic pursuits,&#8212;whatever they were,&#8212;did not sound appealing.</p>
  <p>In  fact, the previous plan, of living by herself, seemed more attractive.</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  much money have I?&#8221; she asked, almost abruptly.</p>
  <p>Vincent  looked at her, and shook his head.</p>
  <p>&#8220;None  at all, Rosemary,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but what I give you. Your father left no will,  and, of course, as an illegitimate child you have no inheritance claim. Your  Aunt Anne&#8217;s ruby, which would have been a small fortune in itself, has been  stolen, so what I choose to give you constitutes your sole source of income.  But I shall not be mean or small in this matter, if you agree to my plans. If,  however, you are thinking of asserting your independence, I may as well tell  you at once, that I shall not contribute to your support except here at  Greatlarch. You must admit, my dear, that you are a little inconsistent. Last  week you were in tears at the thought of leaving this place, now, when I offer  you a home here, you are contemplating going off by yourself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  do you know I am?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  knew by your expression of rebellious discontent at the sort of life you must  accept if you remain here. I knew by your sudden inquiry about finances. I know  you would prefer independence and a home by yourself to a home with me under  the restrictions that I must make. But you are not in a position to dictate.  You may choose,&#8212;but I must tell you, Rosemary, you will make a great mistake if  you attempt to go out into the world, nameless and penniless.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent  spoke very gravely, and Rosemary&#8217;s mutinous red lips curved downward into an  expression of surrender.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  think I&#8217;m ungrateful, Uncle Homer,&#8221; she said, slowly. &#8220;But you must remember I&#8217;m  crushed under this sudden blow. You must remember that I&#8217;ve lost parents, home,  fortune, reputation, everything in the world, at one blow,&#8212;and I must think  things over before I can see my way clear. What is it Kipling says:</p>
  <p>&#8220; &#8216;If  you can see the things you gave your life to broken,<br>
    Yet stoop and build them up with worn-out tools&#8212;&#8217; &#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  all very well, Rosemary, for hifalutin ethical poppycock. But, I&#8217;ll tell you,  my girl, that if you know what&#8217;s good for yourself, you&#8217;ll gladly accept a home  here, under the protection of my name, rather than face any sort of career out  in the cold, hard world. You&#8217;ve no idea, Rosemary, what slights, what scorn,  you would receive! Good heavens, child, I don&#8217;t believe you realize at all what  a terrible misfortune has come to you!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I do, Uncle,&#8212;indeed I do. But sometimes I feel I am so hopeless, so dishonored,  it might be better to strive to live a new life&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Fine  talk! That&#8217;s what all the younger generation harp on nowadays. Live a new  life&#8212;live your own life&#8212;well, Rosemary, do what you choose. But if you choose  to go out from under my roof, it is on the understanding that I will never take  you back again. Think well before you throw away a home like this!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent  glanced round the beautiful room and out into the great hall, and Rosemary&#8217;s  eyes followed.</p>
  <p>Her  deep love for the place welled up in her heart, and with an uncontrollable sob,  she caught her uncle&#8217;s hand in hers, and cried:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  you are right! I never could be happy away from here&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  with the conditions you have to face,&#8221; he returned, gravely. &#8220;Let us consider  it settled then, and you may take your place as head of the household, in so  far as ordering meals and presiding at table is concerned. What you do not  know, Melly will show you, and I myself will instruct you in some of the  matters your dear aunt used to look after.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Rosemary  went away from her uncle with a heart full of conflicting thoughts. She knew  her best plan, as he had said, was to stay at Greatlarch under the conditions  he imposed. She knew the world would be hard on her, would look down upon her,  and as a member of her uncle&#8217;s household she would at least run no chance of  scornfully pointed fingers.</p>
  <p>But  Rosemary&#8217;s whole nature rebelled at the restrictions she would be under, and  the vision of her future seemed far from bright.</p>
  <p>It  is said stone walls do not a prison make, but as the girl saw it, they would come  very near doing so.</p>
  <p>Yet  the alternative was no more desirable. What could she do, alone in an  inhospitable world, without money, name, or friends?</p>
  <p>And  as to marrying Bryce Collins, Rosemary firmly put aside all thought of it. Even  if he asked her to do so, she would not take advantage of his offer, she would  not go to him a nameless bride.</p>
  <p>There  was no way open, the girl concluded, but to stay on at Greatlarch, and try to  do exactly as her uncle wished her to.</p>
  <p>She  would have a home,&#8212;a beautiful home that she loved,&#8212;and she would try to adjust  herself to the new conditions and get along without young companionship or  society.</p>
  <p>She  would forget Bryce Collins, forget Lulie and the other girls, and take up what  her uncle called philanthropic work.</p>
  <p>She  was a bit hazy as to what this meant,&#8212;visiting the poor and old, she  supposed,&#8212;or making flannel petticoats for orphan babies.</p>
  <p>She  wondered who had made flannel petticoats for her when she was an orphan baby,  as she must have been the first three years of her life.</p>
  <p>Those  first three years! It seemed to her sometimes that she could dimly recall  scenes that must have been asylum scenes. She seemed to see rows of cots and  numberless babies, but she couldn&#8217;t be sure that this was not mere imagination  and not memory.</p>
  <p>Well,  it didn&#8217;t matter. She had been an orphan baby, and now she was something still  worse, an orphan girl and an illegitimate child.</p>
  <p>But  when Bryce Collins came that evening, he cheered her by his very presence. He  was so strong and masterful, so determinedly hopeful, so eagerly anxious to do  something, anything, to bring about new developments that might point to  brighter days.</p>
  <p>Also,  he was more than ever resolved to solve the mystery of Miss Anne&#8217;s death.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  knows?&#8221; he said, &#8220;that may have some bearing on your parentage, Rosemary.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  how?&#8221; asked Homer Vincent, interestedly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine,&#8221; Collins admitted, &#8220;but  there seems no motive&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  motive, when the murderer took away a hundred thousand dollar ruby!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  did he take it? May not Miss Anne have hidden it elsewhere? I can&#8217;t seem to see  a burglar taking that one stone and leaving the other jewels.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  the ruby is a fortune in itself. He needed nothing more to make him independent  for life.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know,&#8212;but what can he do with it? Those enormous stones are famous. Every  jeweler in the country,&#8212;in the world, knows of that ruby. He would be spotted  the moment he offered it for sale.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  suppose so,&#8221; Vincent said; &#8220;and yet, I&#8217;ve heard those people have what they  call &#8216;fences&#8217; who dispose of stolen jewels in some manner. And, anyway, the man  must have taken it, for I&#8217;ve looked everywhere among my sister&#8217;s belongings and  all through her rooms and there is no possible hiding place where the stone can  be. No, Bryce, that Henry Johnson stole the jewel and killed my sister. As I  see it, Anne woke up and he killed her lest she scream and alarm the household.  Now, the thing is to find him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  exactly it,&#8221; assented Collins, &#8220;and I&#8217;m going to do it. You said, Mr. Vincent,  that you would spend any amount of money to find the murderer, which, of  course, means to find Henry Johnson. Now, I heard on board ship, coming home,  of a wonderful detective,&#8212;Stone, his name is, who can, without doubt, solve  this mystery. Murder cases are his special forte, and though I understand he is  expensive, yet I know you said&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  did say so, at first, Bryce, but I&#8217;ve already spent a lot on detectives. And  what have they done? What have Brewster and Brown done? Nothing. What has  Prentiss done? Nothing. And quite aside from the money I&#8217;ve paid and still have  to pay them, I am tired of having these investigators around my house. They  examine the rooms over and over again. But they learn nothing from them. They  quiz my servants over and over again. But they deduce nothing from their stories.  The man Johnson has disappeared and the detectives are not able to find him.  That&#8217;s the case in a nutshell. Now why should I spend any more money, or be put  to any further inconvenience when there is no probability that a new man would  or could do any more than the others have done?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  this Stone is a wizard,&#8212;why, he&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know that wizard type. They come in and look around, and say the murder was  done by a man five feet nine inches high, who wore a number seven hat and  smoked a Havana Perfecto cigar. And then they waste days in futile attempts to  find that man,&#8212;and never find him. No, I have decided not to spend any more on  the case, and&#8212;I have a reason&#8212;a secret reason why I prefer not to delve further  into the mystery.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know what that reason is,&#8221; Rosemary cried. &#8220;Bryce, Uncle Homer has gone over to  the spiritualists! He has messages from Aunt Anne and I&#8217;ve no doubt his secret  reason is connected with&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  quite right, Rosemary,&#8221; Vincent spoke very seriously, &#8220;my reason is that my  sister&#8217;s spirit has communicated with me, and she has asked me to refrain from  further investigations.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did  she tell you who killed her?&#8221; Collins asked, not showing his true feelings in  regard to these supernatural communications.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8212;not  exactly, but she said the murderer would never be caught, and for my own peace  of mind and&#8212;for Rosemary&#8217;s, it would be better to let the matter rest.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you fancy that it may be some of Rosemary&#8217;s relatives&#8212;on her mother&#8217;s side&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  put it into words, Collins. You know yourself it may be that the Johnson person  was some such relative,&#8212;and it may be as well never to find him&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rubbish!  I don&#8217;t believe for a minute anything of that sort, and I refuse to listen to  such absurd theories. Now, look here, Mr. Vincent, here&#8217;s my platform. I  propose to marry Rosemary in any case. She is my affianced wife&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Bryce,&#8221; and Rosemary&#8217;s tone was as decided as his own, &#8220;no, I will never  consent to marry you, a nameless, shameful, illegitimate girl! I would  not,&#8212;could not be happy, knowing that I brought you only ignominy and disgrace.  I will never marry you or any one. The fact that my father was a Vincent does  not make me one, since I was not born in wedlock. I am an unhappy girl,&#8212;but I  am fortunate in having Uncle Homer,&#8212;for I shall always call him that,&#8212;give me a  home. I will continue to live here with him and you must not think it strange  if I ask you not to come to see me any more. I am going to try to forget you  and all my young friends&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  Rosemary, let up on that rigmarole. I am going to take hold of this matter and  fight it to a finish. If Mr. Vincent won&#8217;t employ this Stone, I will do so  myself. I have some of my money left, and if it isn&#8217;t enough, I&#8217;ll get busy and  earn more. I have one or two ideas that I haven&#8217;t divulged yet, and if Stone  takes any interest in them, they may be of use to him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t think, Bryce, that you ought to keep from me any knowledge or ideas that  you may have discovered.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  Mr. Vincent, they&#8217;re hardly definite enough to be called ideas,&#8212;they&#8217;re merely  vague impressions&#8212;for instance, here&#8217;s one. The detectives say that Johnson  could have locked that bedroom door behind him by the use of a little  instrument that burglars use, which can turn a key from the other side of the  lock. Now, I&#8217;ve looked up that matter, and while there is such an implement  known, it is very hard to come by, and only found in the kit of the most expert  and experienced burglars. This man Johnson, as I make it out, wasn&#8217;t a burglar.  He was merely a business man, here on a business errand. If his cupidity was  aroused by the sight of Miss Anne&#8217;s great ruby, is it likely that he would  chance to have in his pocket that rare and peculiar tool that would lock the  door after he had committed the crime? Also, why did he want to lock the door?  He made his escape at once. He knew breakfast wouldn&#8217;t be until eight o&#8217;clock,  and he committed the murder, they say, at seven or thereabouts. Why waste time  locking a door when every minute was precious in making an escape? And how  happen to have the implement needed, when, so far as we can gather, he had no  other burglar&#8217;s tools?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  may have had a whole kit, and taken it away with him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  when he arrived, Mellish says, he had only the one bag which, as we now know,  contained his night things and a change of underclothing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  not arguing the case, Bryce, nor am I reconstructing the crime, as they call  it, or guessing how it may have been done. To me the case is simply this.  Johnson killed my sister, stole her jewel, and made his escape. How he did it,  I do not know. But as I truly believe it is the wish of my dead sister that I  should make no further effort to discover any more about it, I propose to cease  my investigations. If you persist in calling in further detective service, it  will be at your own expense and on your own responsibility, and, I may add,  greatly against my wishes and, in fact, under my disapproval.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sorry,  Mr. Vincent, but I&#8217;m going to employ this Stone, if I can get him. And not only  regarding the murder, I can&#8217;t help a certain feeling, maybe a forlorn hope,  that he may help me in the search for Rosemary&#8217;s mother. I admit I want to  know, if possible, who her mother was. Not, understand, for my own sake  alone,&#8212;but for her sake. However, I want it understood that our sake is one and  the same henceforth. I know Rosemary says she will not marry me, but if she  doesn&#8217;t it will not be for lack of importunity and insistence on my part. But  that is a future consideration. First, I&#8217;m going to pursue my own  investigations as I see fit, and then I will consult with you as to Rosemary&#8217;s  future. I take it you do not,&#8212;you cannot forbid me to look into this mystery  further?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t forbid you, Bryce, but I can and do most earnestly request you to leave  it alone. You may laugh if you will at spiritual revelations, but older and  wiser minds than yours do not laugh at them. If I have been persuaded that I  have had visitations from the spirit of my dear sister, it is no more  incredible than that great and good men have also been so convinced. I ask of  you, I beg of you, not to try further to elucidate a mystery, the victim of  which has requested that it be forgotten.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And,  quite aside from that, remember I am an older man than you, and I can see the  futility of renewed search. Indeed, I am convinced that, as a layman, I can see  better than a detective the utter impossibility of finding a man as clever and  determined as Johnson must necessarily be. Doubtless he has so changed his  appearance and demeanor by this time that no one could recognize him; in  addition to which he has in all probability fled to the very ends of the earth.  These obvious conclusions present themselves to the clear-seeing mind of a  layman, while the detective instinct is roused by the mystery and by the call  of the chase. If you look at it calmly, you must agree that I am right.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  may be, Mr. Vincent, and I understand that is the way it looks to you. But I am  on the other side, I admit. To me, there seem to be other avenues to  explore,&#8212;other clues to follow up.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  clues, for instance?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Few,  if any, definite clues, I admit; but hints, theories, possibilities,&#8212;oh, I am  sure such a man as Fleming Stone would have suggestions to make and ways to try  out.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Uncle  Homer,&#8221; said Rosemary, suddenly, &#8220;what was that shiny thing you were hiding in  the secret panel as I looked in the window at you that night?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good  heavens, child, what do you mean? I wasn&#8217;t hiding anything!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  what were you putting in there, then? It shone and glittered, and it wasn&#8217;t  those two imitation rubies,&#8212;for it wasn&#8217;t red&#8212;it was bright like gold.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Like  gold? I don&#8217;t know what it could have been&#8212;for I have nothing made of gold  there. You may come into my room, if you like, and look over all the contents  of that hiding-place. There is nothing there but some valuable papers,  including all the letters and papers concerning my brother Carl. Come along,  both of you, and I will show you the way to open it for yourselves.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  three went to Vincent&#8217;s Tower room, and he showed them both exactly how to  manipulate the tiny knob, hidden in the carved design, that opened the panel.</p>
  <p>The  hiding-place thus revealed was quite large, and held many bundles of papers.  These Vincent touched as he named them.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  glad this subject came up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;for it is better some one should know the  secret of this panel. My sister knew, and now, it is well you young people  should know, for if anything happens to me, you will find all my effects here.  This is my will,&#8212;as you see, I have left the bulk of my property to Rosemary. I  have, of course, left goodly bequests to the two Mellishes, who have served me  long and faithfully. Also, to Hoskins and a few other servants. And some  trifles to a few friends. The residuary is for Rosemary, who, though not  legally a Vincent, is the child of my dear brother,&#8212;and,&#8212;I will refer to this  matter for what I trust may be the last time,&#8212;I daresay, if we knew all the  circumstances we might judge my brother more leniently than the world would if  the matter became known. So, if Rosemary does as I wish her to, and lives here  quietly with me, she will eventually have a fortune of her own.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s  that key, Uncle?&#8221; Rosemary asked, more interested just then in the contents of  the opened recess than in her future financial prospects.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  the key of the wine cellar, child,&#8221; and her uncle smiled. &#8220;In these days, it is  wiser to keep such things locked up, for though Mellish is impeccable some of  the newer servants may not be. Why, Rosemary, this is doubtless what you saw  glistening that night. I perhaps moved it as I hunted for a paper,&#8212;I don&#8217;t  remember precisely.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  that was it. It shone like brass and that has a brass tag.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  and now run away, you two. I am very tired tonight. Collins, think twice before  you run counter to my expressed desires. I do not like to have my advice  utterly ignored.&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky14"></a>Chapter 14 <br>
Fleming Stone on the Case</b></h2>
  <p>Bryce  Collins did think twice before he made up his mind to run counter to Homer  Vincent&#8217;s advice, but as his second thoughts coincided with his first ones, he  carried out his plan of employing the celebrated detective, Fleming Stone, to  investigate the mystery of the death of Anne Vincent, and to endeavor to  recover the stolen ruby.</p>
  <p>On  receiving word from Stone that he would come to Hilldale, Collins told Vincent  of his expected arrival.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very  well,&#8221; Vincent returned, &#8220;I have no real objection, of course, since you are  willing to assume the expenses of the investigation. As I told you, I have  spent all I care to on the work, and, moreover, I am convinced that my dear  sister has advised me to do nothing further.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Collins  wondered at this, to him, utter foolishness, but he remembered that, as Vincent  had told him, greater minds than his own had gone over to spiritualism, and  there was no reason why Homer Vincent should not do so.</p>
  <p>Now  and then, Vincent would tell Rosemary or Bryce Collins that his sister had told  him she would play on the Wild Harp, and always at the appointed hour they  could hear,&#8212;or imagined they heard, faint strains from the direction of the  Temple.</p>
  <p>Collins  pooh-poohed at this, but he was obliged to admit that he did hear the sounds.  Mrs. Mellish, a firm believer in the supernatural, often heard them, whether  others did or not, but the old butler only shook his head with a patronizing  grin, that seemed to pity such foolishness.</p>
  <p>Francine,  who was very quick of hearing, declared the sounds came frequently.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  I can tell,&#8221; she volunteered, &#8220;when it is that my adored Miss Anne touches the  strings, and when it is the music made by the dead Madame Lamont.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  it was into this moil of inexplicable circumstances, into this jumble of  supernaturalism and crime, into this mystery of robbery and murder, that  Fleming Stone was expected to throw himself and, by the skill of his  experienced wisdom and judgment, solve the mystery and expose the criminal.</p>
  <p>The  police had become apathetic in the matter.</p>
  <p>One  and all they agreed that nothing could be done until the missing man, Henry  Johnson, was found. And as there was not the slightest trace of him, as there  was positively no clue or bit of evidence to show which way to search, the  police contented themselves with vague promises and hints of discoveries that  they could not yet make public.</p>
  <p>They  had done their best. They had worked on numerous theories, had gone off on  several wild-goose chases, had quizzed many people, but no definite conclusions  were forthcoming, except that Henry Johnson was the criminal and Henry Johnson  could not be found.</p>
  <p>The  few things he had left behind him were now at Police Headquarters; the room  that had been assigned to him at Greatlarch had been cleaned and put in order,  as also had Miss Anne&#8217;s room.</p>
  <p>So,  Homer Vincent advised Collins, there was no occasion, as he could see, for the  new detective to be a guest at his house. Indeed, he must refuse to have Stone  quartered there, as he felt sure he could not stand such an intrusion on his  home routine.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  he may consider himself free to come and go as he chooses,&#8221; Vincent conceded; &#8220;he  may make all the investigations he desires, he may question my servants or  myself, or Rosemary, all he wants to. But, I beg of you, Bryce, do make him  hurry up the thing. Don&#8217;t have him dawdling here for weeks, accomplishing  nothing. It&#8217;s six weeks and more now, since my sister&#8217;s death,&#8212;nothing has been  done,&#8212;nothing will be done to solve the mystery. But I shall put no obstacle in  the way of any one&#8217;s effort, only, do make the man work as expeditiously as  possible.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Collins  understood the distaste of Homer Vincent for the thought of the dreary  repetitions of question and answer that they all knew by rote, but which  Fleming Stone must ask and learn for himself.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  appreciate your feelings, Mr. Vincent,&#8221; Bryce assured him, &#8220;and I will do all I  can to facilitate Stone&#8217;s work and to save you all unnecessary participation in  the whole business. If you wish, I&#8217;ll take him over the house, take him to the  servants and all that. You need only answer the questions he wishes to put  directly to you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good  for you, Bryce. Save me all the annoyance you can. Rosemary will help you, and  the two Mellishes. Of course, he&#8217;ll want to poke about all over the house. Let  him do so, but keep him away from me, whenever you can.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Bryce  Collins agreed, and relieved that Vincent was even fairly affable about it, he  went off to the station to meet the detective.</p>
  <p>It  was nearing the Christmas holidays now, and though Vincent had given no hint of  his recognition of that fact, yet Collins knew that he would be grateful if  Stone could make his investigations and announce either success or failure  before the Christmastide should arrive.</p>
  <p>Not  that there would be any celebration at Greatlarch this year, but Vincent&#8217;s  nature leaned toward religious observances, and Collins knew the season would  be a sacred one to him.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  took little interest in the advent of Fleming Stone. She had no hope that any  one would ever find Johnson now. She felt that as six weeks had elapsed, no  further search could result in a discovery of the missing man. And she was so  disheartened at her own sad fate that, while she mourned her aunt and missed  her sorely, yet the avenging of her tragic death meant less to the girl than  the tragedy of her own life.</p>
  <p>Night  after night she cried herself to sleep, now resolving she would never marry,  and then almost yielding to the temptation of consenting to Bryce&#8217;s plea that  they be married at once.</p>
  <p>But  she knew Bryce&#8217;s mother, and she was not brave enough to face the angry scorn  of that haughty and aristocratic dame.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Collins had learned of Rosemary&#8217;s refusal to marry her son, and thoroughly  approved of the girl&#8217;s decision. But should Rosemary change her mind, Mrs.  Collins was quite ready to put up a fight.</p>
  <p>Bryce  Collins was of a sanguine, hopeful nature. His strong will and his unflinching  determination were supplemented by a sublime optimism that never gave way until  forced to do so by absolutely unconquerable circumstances.</p>
  <p>And,  quite aside from his firm belief in Stone&#8217;s ability to find the murderer, he  also was sure that the detective could be of help in discovering the mother of  Rosemary. And he had a blind faith in that mother.</p>
  <p>For  Rosemary&#8217;s sake even more than his own, he wanted to prove her mother of gentle  birth,&#8212;perhaps a young and innocent girl led into error because of ignorance  or too blind confidence in her lover. Perhaps she had been deceived by Carl  Vincent&#8212;tricked by a false marriage, or,&#8212;Bryce couldn&#8217;t always formulate his  hopes, but at any rate he meant to have Stone look up the matter thoroughly. It  might necessitate another trip to France, but this thought was no impediment to  Collins&#8217; flights of fancy.</p>
  <p>He  was musing on these things when the train came to a stop at the station and a  tall, good-looking man stepped off, who was, Collins felt sure, the detective.</p>
  <p>He  was accompanied by a red-headed, eager-faced boy, whose alert blue eyes darted  comprehendingly about.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  our man, F. S.,&#8221; the boy said, &#8220;that&#8217;s Mr. Collins&#8212;aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  Collins said, smiling at the lad, whose cap sat saucily aslant on his thick red  hair, but who pulled it quickly off as the two men greeted one another, and  Fleming Stone added, &#8220;and this is my young assistant, McGuire.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How&#8217;re  you, Mr. Collins?&#8221; the boy responded, &#8220;and to people I like I&#8217;m Fibsy. I like  you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thank  you, Fibsy,&#8221; Bryce smiled at him. &#8220;I hope I shall like you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  bet you will. Where do we go from here?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Bryce  Collins conducted them to the village inn, which was so near by that they  walked the short distance.</p>
  <p>He  had already engaged rooms for them, and very soon they were in a private  sitting-room and Collins was earnestly telling Stone the principal facts of the  case.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know a good deal from the newspaper accounts,&#8221; the detective said; &#8220;what I want  to learn is the knowledge they seemed so carefully to withhold. Who was this  Johnson man? Why did they never pick him up again? Where is he now?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  just the point of the whole thing, Mr. Stone. Get Johnson,&#8212;and you&#8217;ve done it  all. He&#8217;s the murderer beyond all doubt&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  did he get in and out of the locked room?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  the question. But get Johnson and he can answer that himself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course. Perfectly true. Now, to get a missing man, we have to trace him. Did he  leave any indicative clues?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  he did not! He went like a wraith&#8212;he dissolved like a mist&#8212;no one saw him go,  no one has seen him since. He made no tracks, he left no clues.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  come, now, I&#8217;ll bet he left clues. Only, those who saw them failed to recognize  them as such.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  what I think, Mr. Stone,&#8221; Collins spoke eagerly. &#8220;I believe that&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  of course there are no signs of those clues now,&#8221; Fibsy said, with a deep sigh.  &#8220;Six weeks must have obliterated all the footprints and fingerprints there were  in the first place.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t think anybody thought of fingerprints,&#8221; Collins said, looking at Fibsy  with dawning respect. He had thought him merely Stone&#8217;s clerical assistant, or  perhaps valet, and was amazed at the boy&#8217;s intelligent gaze and perspicacious  remark.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  much chance for &#8216;em, anyway,&#8221; Fibsy went on. &#8220;No use getting Johnson&#8217;s  fingerprints, if you can&#8217;t get the mitt that made &#8216;em! No use in getting the  prints of the family and friends,&#8212;or even the servants. No s&#8217;picion of the  butler person is there?&#8221;</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&#8220;Good  gracious, no,&#8221; and Collins smiled at the bare thought of suspecting Mellish.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  offence to His Nibs,&#8221; Fibsy offered, &#8220;but you know, quite frequently sometimes  it is Friend Butler.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hush  up, Fibs,&#8221; Stone admonished. &#8220;Now, Mr. Collins, I have, I think, all the  information you can give me. The rest I must get for myself. Can I go to the  house this afternoon? After I&#8217;ve had some luncheon here?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  surely. You&#8217;ll find Mr. Vincent a reserved and perhaps curt man, but you can  depend absolutely on his sense of justice and his willingness to have you  investigate his premises. He prefers to be left out of it all himself, as much  as possible. But I assure you that he is ready to do his part, and usually, his  bark is worse than his bite.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Gruff  old codger?&#8221; asked Fibsy.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  a bit of it!&#8221; and Collins smiled. &#8220;A most polished gentleman. But bored by  people and weary of the futile efforts of detectives.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We&#8217;re  accustomed to that type,&#8221; the boy said, winking at Stone; &#8220;they come off their  perch, though, when F. Stone really gets busy. Will this guy mind my goin&#8217;  along?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  think not,&#8212;but I assume you&#8217;d go just the same if he did.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sure  I would. F. Stone can&#8217;t do a thing without his little Fibsy by his side. He&#8217;s  that dependent on me, you wouldn&#8217;t believe!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  the cheerful nickname?&#8221; Collins couldn&#8217;t help liking the boy.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  just it! &#8216;Cause I&#8217;m such a cheerful liar. Why, it&#8217;s no more trouble for me to  tell a whopper than for F. Stone to tell the gospel truth!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  now, McGuire, keep quiet. You&#8217;re too chatty this morning.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Gotta  stop!&#8221; and the lad made a wry face. &#8220;When he calls me McGuire, he means  business. No more funny chatter from this baby. All right,&#8212;here&#8217;s where I shut  up.&#8221; And from then on, the boy made no remark, but his sharp eyes showed  perception and comprehension and his wise little head nodded now and then, as  Collins discussed the matter somewhat further with Fleming Stone.</p>
  <p>That  afternoon the pair of detectives went to Greatlarch.</p>
  <p>Collins  was there before them and introduced them to Homer Vincent and Rosemary.</p>
  <p>Fibsy  was very quiet, acknowledging his presentation by a respectful nod of his red  head, but Fleming Stone was a little more self-assertive than was usual for  him.</p>
  <p>Fibsy  looked at his chief in silent wonder as Stone shook hands a little effusively  with Homer Vincent, and said, &#8220;How do you do, my dear?&#8221; to Rosemary.</p>
  <p>It  was quite foreign to Stone&#8217;s custom to be so familiar, and when he followed it  up by settling himself, unasked, in an easy chair, Fibsy&#8217;s self-addressed &#8220;Gee!&#8221;  was almost audible.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wonderful  house, Mr. Vincent,&#8221; was Stone&#8217;s appreciative comment, as he gazed around him.</p>
  <p>They  were in the reception room, which was also a Tower room, opposite the room that  Vincent used for his own.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  the host replied, a bit curtly, and waited for further speech from his guest.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  Stone&#8217;s manner changed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am here, Mr. Vincent,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to discover, if I can, who killed your sister.  But I am told by Mr. Collins, that you do not wish to pursue this inquiry  further, because of supernatural revelations you have had. Is this true?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Quite  true, Mr. Stone.&#8221; Vincent spoke courteously but wearily, as if wishing to be  done with the interview. &#8220;I daresay you do not believe in the occult&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Pardon  me, do you consider the occult and the supernatural synonymous terms?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t care to go into the technical definitions of those terms,&#8221; Vincent  returned; &#8220;my belief in the revelations I have received from the spirit of my  dead sister is not based on study or research into these questions. It is  solely based on the evidence of my own senses and an inner conviction that my  senses in no way deceived me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am interested,&#8221; Stone said; &#8220;how were these messages received, may I ask?  Through the assistance of a Ouija Board or a human medium?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Neither,  sir. The messages were spoken to me by my sister&#8217;s voice in the dead of night&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  sure you were awake?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  wide awake as I am this minute. She spoke low but clearly to me, and begged me,  for her sake, to desist from these futile delvings into what must ever remain a  mystery. Now, Mr. Stone, I am not asking you to desist nor am I desirous of  hindering your search,&#8212;only I do want you to understand my attitude, and be  good enough to leave me out as a factor of your plans.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  will do so, Mr. Vincent, as far as I can, without too much hampering my own  work. If, however, you give me your permission to examine the house, and  grounds,&#8212;to interview your servants&#8212;and to ask you a question or two, if and  when necessary, I think I may safely promise you immunity from annoyance.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thank  you,&#8221; and Vincent looked relieved. &#8220;I will then, if you please, excuse myself  now, and leave you to your own procedure. Touch the bell for my butler, and he  will arrange for your interviews with the other servants.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent rose and left the room, his slight limp appearing a little more in  evidence than usual.</p>
  <p>After  Vincent&#8217;s departure, the detective sat a moment in deep thought.</p>
  <p>Bryce  Collins put this down to a desire to appear profound and weighted down by care.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  thought it was merely the habit of any detective to sit and ponder at  intervals.</p>
  <p>But  Fibsy knew at once that, somehow, somewhere, Stone had seen or heard something  indicative. Something had demanded immediate and serious thought. Not for  worlds would the boy have spoken then. Nothing would have induced him to blurt  out some of his saucy speeches. He watched the play of Stone&#8217;s features, he  gazed eagerly in his face for a sign of what was passing in his mind. But  though grave and preoccupied, the detective&#8217;s face gave no hint of the trend  his thoughts were taking.</p>
  <p>After  a few moments, however, he roused himself and with a brisk air turned to  Collins.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  for an examination of the house,&#8221; he said; &#8220;though I fear I may become so  engrossed in the marvels of architecture and decoration as to forget my main  business here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  what Mr. Johnson did,&#8221; Rosemary said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  didn&#8217;t see him?&#8221; and Stone turned to her quickly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221;  Rosemary was almost frightened at his suddenness, &#8220;no, the butler told me. He  said Mr. Johnson was overcome with admiration and wonder. Indeed, he must have  been, to have wandered about nearly all night.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  do you suppose he wandered?&#8221; Stone said, musingly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure, but he couldn&#8217;t have been in his room long, as it was so  undisturbed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221;  Stone sighed deeply, &#8220;if I&#8217;d only been here at once. I suppose all the rooms he  might have visited that night, in his tour of admiration, have since been swept  and garnished, dusted and polished to the last degree!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  they have,&#8221; said Rosemary. &#8220;The detectives looked them all over and said Mr.  Johnson left no clues.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ugh-h-h!&#8221;  Fibsy&#8217;s grunt was one of utter disdain for the detectives who could find  nothing to detect. Without a word, he conveyed the idea that Fleming Stone  would have found plenty of evidence from those cursorily examined rooms.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s  one clue they found,&#8221; Rosemary said. She was anxious to help and she was deeply  interested in the new detective.</p>
  <p>Aside  from his chivalrous courtesy, Fleming Stone had great charm when he chose to  exercise it, and feeling exceedingly sorry for the girl, whose story Collins  had already told him, he paid her such pleasant and deferential attention that  she was glad to offer any information.</p>
  <p>From  a table-drawer she took the long-handled cigarette-holder which had been found  out in the grounds.</p>
  <p>&#8220;This  is known to be Mr. Johnson&#8217;s,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and as it was found outside, we  assume he strolled round the grounds.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t  it a cold, snowy night?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  after midnight. I came home about twelve&#8212;or, nearer one,&#8212;and it had stopped  snowing, though it was cold. But not too cold for a walk.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yet  remember he had on no hat or overcoat.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  he may have had,&#8221; Collins interposed &#8220;He wore none when he went away, after the  crime. But he may have strolled round the grounds before that, with his hat and  coat on, and then he dropped his cigarette-holder.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Odd  thing to do,&#8221; Stone observed. &#8220;Yet he may have thought he slipped it in his  pocket and it fell to the ground. You&#8217;re sure it is his?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Mellish recognized it as the one he used after dinner,&#8221; Rosemary answered him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let  me see Mellish,&#8221; Stone said, abruptly, and the butler was called.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  I don&#8217;t want a lot of information, Mellish,&#8221; Stone said, pleasantly. &#8220;Just tell  me anything you can remember of Mr. Johnson&#8217;s conversation at dinner that  evening he dined here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mellish  looked blank. Evidently he had expected quite different inquiries.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  now, sir, I&#8217;m not sure I can remember much of that. I opine it&#8217;s as evidence  you want this, and I must have a care that I do not undervalue its importance.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone  suppressed a smile at the rather grandiloquent air of the speaker and Fibsy  stared at him, fascinated.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  it is important,&#8221; Stone assured him, &#8220;so tell it as accurately as you can. What  subjects did the visitor choose for conversation?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  sir, he didn&#8217;t do much of the choosing. I should say Mr. Vincent selected the  topics of dissertation. And, as I recollect, two or three times, Mr. Johnson  began a sentence, and Mr. Vincent would say, &#8216;No, no, we must not discuss  business at the table.&#8217; It is a sovereignal rule of Mr. Vincent, sir, never to  talk on business or any serious matters at meal-times. He held that table-talk  must ever be light and agreeable,&#8212;yes, sir, light and agreeable.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you think the subject of Mr. Johnson&#8217;s business with Mr. Vincent was not an  agreeable subject?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I wouldn&#8217;t say that, sir. I opine it was agreeable enough, but of a serious  nature,&#8212;yes, sir, of a serious nature.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  what did Mr. Johnson start to say, when Mr. Vincent asked him not to introduce  the subject? Anything regarding rubies?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir&#8212;it was more in the line of remingincence,&#8212;yes, sir, remingincence. Once, I  recollect, Mr. Johnson said, &#8216;You see, I was his confidential clerk&#8212;&#8217; he said  that just as I was entering the room with my tray, and I heard that much, and  then Mr. Vincent said, &#8216;No, no, my friend, no reference to business just now,  if you please,&#8217; or something like that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never  mind the exact words of Mr. Vincent, but try to remember more of the speeches  of Mr. Johnson. You see, Mellish, it is most important that we get a line on  what sort of a gentleman he was. And I don&#8217;t want to trouble Mr. Vincent in  these matters unless necessary.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir, I see. Well, Mr. Johnson was remarking on the beauty of the house, you  see, and he said, quite impressive like, &#8216;but it doesn&#8217;t make me forget my real  errand here,&#8212;I am here for a purpose,&#8212;&#8217; and then again Mr. Vincent told him to  wait till after dinner to discuss the business that brought him here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Any  more?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  he spoke of a trust&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  you think he meant a great jewel trust? Or Jewelers&#8217; Union?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no, sir! Not at all. He meant a trust had been given to him&#8212;a sacred trust, he  called it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  then that had nothing to do with the business in hand.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  I don&#8217;t know, sir. Mr. Vincent shut him off again, just the same way.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps  it referred to Miss Anne&#8217;s ruby. Was that a trust to her for any one else?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  that I know of, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky15"></a>Chapter 15 <br>
A Few Deductions</b></h2>
  <p>Fleming  Stone and his red-headed assistant sat in their little parlor at the Hilldale  inn.</p>
  <p>They  had not said much as yet about the Vincent mystery, but each was thinking  deeply.</p>
  <p>At last,  Stone, with a straightforward glance at the boy, said:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Find  Henry Johnson.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Find  Henry Johnson,&#8221; Fibsy repeated, but he added a prolonged wink, that left him  with one blue eye staring wide open and the other optic tightly closed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Meaning?&#8221;  asked Stone, meditatively, gazing at this expressive facial contortion.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Meaning,&#8221;  returned Fibsy, his closed eye once more opening to the world at large, &#8220;that  Mr. Henry Johnson is going to be hard to find&#8212;very hard to find.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Meaning,  again?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  that a man who has been tee-tum-tee-totally missing for something over six  weeks, isn&#8217;t going to be picked up overnight, is he, now, F. Stone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps  not, Fibs, but the first move on our chess-board is to find him. Now, for a  systematic search, let&#8217;s first observe his clothing,&#8212;which is, I believe, at  the Police Station.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Eccentric  guy, Henry,&#8212;isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; and Fibsy&#8217;s blue eyes stared out over his tightly closed  fists, on which his cheeks rested.</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  how?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  to his occupation all through the night. Say, he pulled off his robbery and  murder stunt at seven A.M., which is what the doctors put the time at. Then, as  Mr. Vincent left his visitor at about eleven, that man was so interested in the  beautiful house that he prowled around it for eight mortal hours! Going some,&#8212;F.  Stone,&#8212;going some!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, but what else did he do? We know he didn&#8217;t go to bed. He may have lain  down on some sofa or couch for a nap,&#8212;and, remember the cigarette-holder,&#8212;that  proves he went for a walk round the grounds.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Out  back to that Spooky Hollow place, I s&#8217;pose. Investigatin&#8217; the Spooky Harp and  the Spooky Lady who plays on it. Well, I reckernize all that, but I still say  he was a long time a pokin&#8217; around especially as the night watchman never  caught a peek of him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  it must be that he did drop down on some convenient couch for a nap. Lord  knows, there are plenty of them here and there, all over that house. I saw a  dozen.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Mr. Vincent is of a home comforts type. Why, the swivel chair in his private  office room is all cushioned and upholstered.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  Johnson may have taken his doze in a chair. But it makes little difference  where he spent the night, the point is, where is he now? and can we trace him  from the clothes and clues he left behind him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  can, F. Stone. That&#8217;s your business, isn&#8217;t it? Why, the man is as good as  caught already!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  will do, McGuire, this is no time for foolery. Come along now to the  Headquarters, and for Heaven&#8217;s sake, keep your eyes open. The trails are very  stale, and we shall be hard put to it to read much from them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  when Stone was given the hat and coat of the missing man, his eyes lighted up  with expectancy. &#8220;This hat tells us a lot,&#8221; he said, and Brown and Brewster,  who had come to listen to the celebrated detective&#8217;s deductions, drew nearer.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is brand-new, it shows that Mr. Johnson has a large head, that he is slightly  bald, that he had just had a hair-cut, that, though this is a Derby, he usually  wore a soft hat,&#8212;that he didn&#8217;t like this hat at all,&#8212;and that may be the  reason he didn&#8217;t wear it when he went away. It also tells us that Mr. Johnson  is of a pronounced brunette type, with dark hair and eyes, and of a strong,  vigorous vitality. But these descriptive bits are of little use, for we already  know the appearance and personality of the man. We are not trying to discover  who owns this hat, but where he is.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  the same, your deductions are mighty interesting,&#8221; Brown said, his eyes shining  with curiosity. &#8220;And, though it may seem a, b, c to you, won&#8217;t you tell us how  you got those facts?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone  answered this categorically, saying, &#8220;His head must be large, because this hat  is seven and a half, and yet it shows signs on the sweat-band of having been  pulled down hard, to fit on his head. He had a recent hair-cut, because a few  short hairs are caught in the tiny bow of silk braid inside the hat, and he was  probably bald, because there is a faint odor of a certain lotion that I know is  used in many barber shops as a hair stimulant. He was accustomed to a soft hat,  for on each side of this crown you may see rubbed places, where he has  absent-mindedly grasped it in one hand as one does a soft hat. I feel sure he  didn&#8217;t like a hat that was too tight for him, and was stiff and uncomfortable  compared to a Fedora, yet it doesn&#8217;t seem quite plausible to assume that as the  reason for his leaving it behind him. I think it more likely, that he wore this  hat when out strolling round the grounds, but he did not have it on when he  committed the crime, and that he hastened away after that, in such a hurry, or  in such a distraction of mind, that he did not then return to his room for his  hat.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course the deductions as to his personal appearance are based on these few  short, strong black hairs, which naturally connote a brunette type and the dark  eyes and physical vigor that accompany that coloring.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,  as I say, these traits of Mr. Johnson are known to Mr. Vincent, and so are of  no further importance. What we want is some clue that may suggest his possible  destination on leaving Greatlarch. Let me see the coat.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  coat proved to be an ordinary, fairly expensive overcoat,&#8212;new, and of good  style. There was nothing in the pockets but a handkerchief, also new, and  unmarked, a pair of new gloves, that had not even been tried on, and, in a  small pocket, evidently meant for the purpose, less than a dollar in silver,  doubtless to be handy for car-fare or tips.</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  just as we found it,&#8221; Brewster told him, and Stone looked regretfully at the  gloves.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  can anybody learn from new gloves?&#8221; he said, dejectedly, &#8220;except the size of  his hands and the type of his haberdashery, which is in no way helpful. But why  did the man have this entire new outfit merely to come up here on a business  errand? The fact that all his things are so very new is a peculiar circumstance  in itself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s  his umbrella,&#8221; Brewster said; &#8220;this isn&#8217;t so new. You see it has his monogram  on the handle.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  monogrammed umbrella is an unusual thing for any one,&#8221; Stone said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Probably  given him by his Sunday-school class,&#8221; Fibsy put in.</p>
  <p>&#8220;More  likely by a rich maiden aunt,&#8221; Brown suggested. &#8220;Makers of synthetic rubies are  not apt to be of a religious tendency. However, it&#8217;s a fine umbrella.&#8221;</p>
  <p>It  was, and Stone examined it closely. Of thick, rich black silk, it had a  silver-mounted handle, which showed an H and a J intertwined in an elaborate  monogram.</p>
  <p>The  ribs were of the best, and aside from the maker&#8217;s name, there seemed no other  details to note.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Observe  the monogram, McGuire,&#8221; Stone said, quietly, passing it to the boy.</p>
  <p>Gravely,  Fibsy scrutinized the chased letters, and his round, freckled face drew itself  into a frown of perplexity.</p>
  <p>A  quick glance at Stone showed him that there was something to be learned from  the monogram, but, for once, Terence McGuire was dense or ignorant.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t see it, F. Stone,&#8221; he said, in a chagrined tone. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  nothing. Just get the monogram fixed in your mind,&#8212;carry away a mental picture  of it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>So  Fibsy looked hard at the deeply engraved H and the long, slender J that ran  down through the middle of it, after the manner of monograms, and then declared  he knew it so well he could draw it in the dark, with his eyes shut and both  hands tied behind him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  about the monogram, Mr. Stone?&#8221; Brewster asked, but Stone only shook his head,  saying: &#8220;perhaps nothing, perhaps a signboard pointing to the truth. As soon as  I find out which, I&#8217;ll tell you. At any rate the umbrella, though well  preserved and cared for, is not a brand-new one. Where&#8217;s his bag?&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  kitbag was brought, but if the audience expected any sensational deductions by  Fleming Stone, they were disappointed. He ran over carelessly the few black  rubber-backed brushes and the few new, unmarked pieces of underwear. He glanced  at the necktie and handkerchiefs. All new, and all of fairly good quality, without  being elaborate or expensive.</p>
  <p>The  atomizer interested him rather more.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t  there a bottle of lotion to go with this?&#8221; he asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  what we wondered,&#8221; said Brown, eagerly, glad to have his thoughts coincide with  those of the great detective.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s  almost nothing in it,&#8221; Stone went on, &#8220;and from the odor I gather it&#8217;s an  antiseptic preparation,&#8212;doubtless for some catarrhal affection. Where&#8217;s the  vial? There must be one, and it may have a chemist&#8217;s name on it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  isn&#8217;t any bottle, Mr. Stone, and there was none in his room or his bathroom. He  must have forgotten to bring it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  forgot to bring anything indicative of his identity!&#8221; Stone said. &#8220;For a man on  a short business trip, he had fewer personal articles of property than any one  I ever saw! It would almost seem as if he were desirous of hiding his identity.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yet  there&#8217;s no rhyme or reason to that,&#8221; put in Brewster, &#8220;he sent his name in to  Mr. Vincent, and his umbrella bears witness that it was his real name.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  brought him up from the station to Mr. Vincent&#8217;s house?&#8221; asked Stone, suddenly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Prout,  the taxi driver,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;The Vincent butler told me so.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Has  Prout been interviewed?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Mr. Stone, I questioned him myself,&#8221; Brewster stated; &#8220;he said nothing of  interest. Merely described the man as we&#8217;ve already had his description, said  he came up on the New York train&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  a New York timetable in his bag,&#8221; Brown interposed. &#8220;And it is the only scrap  of paper he seemed to possess.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  took his money and papers with him,&#8221; Stone said; &#8220;but can I see this Prout for  myself, Mr. Brewster?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, I&#8217;ll send for him at once.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  when Prout arrived, he gave, practically, the same description of the brunette  Johnson, that Stone had already heard.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell  me of his manner,&#8221; Stone said; &#8220;was he business-like?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Lord, yes. Spry and sort of up-and-coming, he was. Wanted to know a lot about  Mr. Vincent, he did.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  had never seen him before?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  they say he hadn&#8217;t, and I dunno&#8217;s he had,&#8212;no, sir, I dunno&#8217;s he had. But he did  ask me right first-off if Mr. Vincent&#8217;s leg had healed yet.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  noticed Mr. Vincent limped a little,&#8221; Stone said, &#8220;what&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  broke his leg some few years ago, sir, and they&#8217;ve never been quite the same  length since. Jest a mite of a limp,&#8212;as you could see. But this man musta known  that, &#8216;cause he asked me right outen a clear sky, did Mr. Vincent&#8217;s leg get  well. So, I says to myself, he&#8217;s an old friend. Well, sir, then he asked me was  Mr. Vincent married! Ho, ho,&#8212;to think of Homer Vincent bein&#8217; married! Why there  ain&#8217;t an unlikelier marryin&#8217; man on the footstool than Homer Vincent! That  there ain&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  Johnson could scarcely be an old friend without knowing that,&#8221; Stone observed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  jest it! And yet, he knew of Mr. Vincent&#8217;s brother and his sister and his  niece.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  sure? He didn&#8217;t gather the facts of these relationships from something you  said?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  he didn&#8217;t. For I said somethin&#8217; about Miss Vincent and he said did I mean Miss  Rosemary.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  he knew of the niece. What else did he say?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  much else. Oh, yep, I spoke of Mr. Vincent as the old man,&#8212;not meanin&#8217; no  disrespect, but jest in a manner o&#8217; speakin&#8217;, an&#8217; he says, sharp like. &#8216;Why do  you call him an old man?&#8217; an&#8217; I says. &#8216;Thasso, he can&#8217;t be more&#8217;n fifty.&#8217; An&#8217;  he can&#8217;t neither.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;This  is all interesting, Mr. Prout, but it only proves that Mr. Johnson knew some  things about Mr. Homer, which he might easily have learned from hearsay. There&#8217;s  nothing, so far, to indicate that they had ever met before.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  dessay that&#8217;s so,&#8212;an&#8217; yet, somehow, he gimme the impression that he had seen  the man. Maybe he hadn&#8217;t, though,&#8212;maybe he hadn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Vincent said he was an entire stranger,&#8221; Brewster stated; &#8220;I see no reason to  doubt his word.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Me  nuther,&#8221; said Prout. &#8220;An&#8217; when I told Mr. Johnson that Mr. Vincent was an  inventor, he was surprised and interested.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  would be,&#8221; said Stone, &#8220;because of his interest in the manufacture of his  rubies. But I didn&#8217;t know Homer Vincent was an inventor.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  he just putters about, making up odd tricks,&#8221; Brown said, smiling. &#8220;He isn&#8217;t an  inventor by way of patenting things, or manufacturing them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  line do his inventions take?&#8221; Stone inquired.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mostly  electrical,&#8221; Brewster informed him. &#8220;Little contraptions to make bells ring in  his house where he wants them. Speaking-tubes from his rooms to the servants&#8217;  quarters. I&#8217;ve seen them in use. They&#8217;re a little more elaborate and ingenious  than other folks have. And they say he rigs them up himself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  Mr. Prout,&#8221; Stone addressed him, &#8220;I think you have given me about all the  information you can, and I thank you. Now, one more question. Merely as an  observer of human nature, would you say that your fare that day was a man bent  on a sinister errand, I mean on an errand of evil intent,&#8212;or merely on a matter  of business?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Prout  considered.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  sir,&#8221; he said, at last, &#8220;it&#8217;s sorter hard to tell. But, while I wouldn&#8217;t wanta  say that Mr. Johnson was on any such devilish errand as he carried out before  he left, yet I will say that he had a more personal interest in Mr. Vincent and  his home and his family than I&#8217;d expect from a man comin&#8217; on a plain matter o&#8217;  business. He was sorta excited an&#8217; eager-like,&#8212;more&#8217;n you&#8217;d expect from a agent  for a jewelry house.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  see,&#8212;he anticipated some pleasure or profit from his visit beside the business  proposition he was to make.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  it, sir. And without meanin&#8217; to do more&#8217;n I oughter in the way o&#8217; deducin&#8217;&#8212;or  whatever you call it,&#8212;I might make a guess that he was a bit interested in Miss  Rosemary.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fleming  Stone&#8217;s heart gave a sudden thump. Bryce Collins had told him that Mr. Vincent  had hinted that the murderer might be some of the girl&#8217;s disreputable  kinsfolk,&#8212;on her mother&#8217;s side. Suppose this were true!</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  did you think that?&#8221; he asked, sharply.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  come now, I didn&#8217;t exactly think it,&#8212;only just the way he said Miss Rosemary&#8217;s  name, made me think he might be sweet on her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  that!&#8221; Stone was relieved. &#8220;But how could he know the girl, when he didn&#8217;t know  her uncle?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t say he did know her&#8212;only, I sorta imagined he sounded interested in her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Probably  it was imagination,&#8221; and Stone declared the whole interview, at an end.</p>
  <p>As  he and Fibsy left the place, the detective proposed that Prout drive them out  to the Vincent home, and as they went the trio chatted casually of the whole  matter. But no detail of importance could Stone gain further, and when they  reached their destination, he discarded the idea of the taxi driver as a source  of information.</p>
  <p>Before  entering the house, Stone took a short walk round the grounds.</p>
  <p>He  found the place where, as he had been told, the cigarette-holder had been  picked up.</p>
  <p>It  was perhaps twenty-five or thirty feet from the broken stone fence that marked  off the dark glade known as Spooky Hollow.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  wonder at the name? Do you?&#8221; Fibsy said, shuddering at the dark and dense gloom  of the tangled underbrush in the thicket.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  it&#8217;s an eerie place,&#8221; and Stone gazed thoughtfully into its depths. &#8220;I don&#8217;t  want to get all messed up, but I wish, Terence, you&#8217;d go in there some time, and  see just what&#8217;s inside. Probably nothing at all, and yet, you might get a  pointer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, F. S., I&#8217;ll tend to that same errand soon&#8217;s I can. Or shall I go right  now, immejit?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  tomorrow will do. Wear your oldest clothes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir. What&#8217;m I to look for?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t think of anything,&#8221; Stone smiled. &#8220;But it seems a place to be explored,  that&#8217;s all. A place called Spooky Hollow is suggestive of spooks, isn&#8217;t it? You  might find a few.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220; &#8216;Tis  the same as done, sir,&#8221; and Fibsy nodded his red shock in a promissory way.</p>
  <p>In  the house they found Bryce Collins and Rosemary, in what seemed to be a  desperate controversy.</p>
  <p>The  girl&#8217;s lovely face was tear-stained and her lips quivered, as she greeted  Stone.</p>
  <p>Fibsy&#8217;s  tender heart was torn, for beauty in distress was one thing he could not bear  to see. At heart the boy was a squire of dames, and his first sight of Rosemary  had enlisted his whole-hearted sympathy in her cause.</p>
  <p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve  been looking at Spooky Hollow,&#8221; said Stone, by way of a casual remark to dispel  the awkwardness of the scene.</p>
  <p>Rosemary  controlled her voice and responded, &#8220;It&#8217;s a shame to use that name for such a  lovely place, don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do,&#8221; Stone agreed, &#8220;unless there are really spooks out there. In that case, it&#8217;s  appropriate. Are there, Miss Vincent?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  never seen any,&#8221; she gave a half smile and then her face turned very serious. &#8220;But  I have heard the Wild Harp, Mr. Stone,&#8212;how do you explain that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell  me of it,&#8212;describe it exactly, will you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  there&#8217;s little to tell&#8212;it&#8217;s just a wave of faint music that sounds now and  then.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Like  an olian harp?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No&#8212;not  exactly. It&#8217;s more like&#8212;well, I may as well say that it sounds more like  ghostly music than anything else I can think of.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  do you know how ghostly music sounds?&#8221; and Stone smiled at her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  I don&#8217;t&#8212;of course,&#8212;but it&#8217;s so faint and sweet and&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  there an air&#8212;a tune?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  not a definite tune&#8212;more like a wailing strain, that has no beginning or end.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  that makes it ghostly?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  you&#8217;re laughing at me, Mr. Stone,&#8221; and Rosemary&#8217;s color returned to her cheeks,  and she was again her own charming self.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Indeed,  I&#8217;m not. And, I&#8217;m told that this Harp plays at certain times, in accordance  with advices from the spirit world.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  not quite that!&#8221; Rosemary looked surprised. &#8220;But they say when it does sound,  it forbodes disaster.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  it sounded the night of your aunt&#8217;s death?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I heard it myself, between two and three.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Will  you call your butler, Miss Vincent?&#8221; Mellish appeared in answer to a summons,  and Fleming Stone turned to him at once.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mellish,&#8221;  he said, &#8220;have you ever heard this Wild Harp?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Though  he tried to suppress it, a faint smile came to the face of the butler.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  sir,&#8212;I may say I have. But, if you&#8217;re thinking seriously as to its being of a  supernatural persuasion,&#8212;I opine sir, as it isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,  and what do you opine causes the music?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  not free of speech, not free to say, sir,&#8212;but &#8216;tis my notion that those who  hear it have the imagination strongly developed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah,  you think it is a freak of their fancy?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  that, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  and now, Mellish, I want to check up on something you said. You know we&#8217;re  trying every possible way to find Henry Johnson.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir, I am aware of your endeavors in that direction.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very  well. Now, you know he came here to see Mr. Vincent about making rubies?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir,&#8212;that&#8217;s no secret, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  it is not. Mr. Vincent told it himself. But the making of rubies is not so  common a business but that we ought to be able to trace a man who makes it his  calling.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Common  a business it may not be, but Mr. Johnson is the second man, within a month or  so, to come here to see Mr. Vincent about it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Doubtless  the same man&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no, sir, the other man was quite different&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  mean, probably from the same firm of manufacturers.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  may be. The other man&#8217;s name was Markham,&#8212;or something like that&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never  mind that now,&#8221; Stone spoke a little impatiently, &#8220;what I want to know is about  the Wild Harp. But, not now, Mellish, it&#8217;s later than I thought. I&#8217;ll see you  about that tomorrow. You may go now.&#8221;</p>
  <p>As  the butler left the room, Stone said to Bryce Collins, &#8220;I suppose, Mr. Collins,  I am to make my report of my findings to you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  yes, Mr. Stone,&#8212;but if you have any developments of importance to tell of, it  might be a good idea to ask Mr. Vincent if he wants to hear them. He&#8212;well, I  don&#8217;t want to seem to neglect him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  true, call him, if you like.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent came at the summons. He looked anxious to hear the report and was most  courteous and gracious to Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  haven&#8217;t learned very much,&#8221; Fleming Stone said, &#8220;but I have found out these  things. The man who came here the day Miss Vincent died was not named Henry  Johnson. His initials were not H. J. He didn&#8217;t come to see about synthetic  rubies; he didn&#8217;t murder Miss Vincent, and he didn&#8217;t steal her famous jewel.&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky16"></a>Chapter 16 <br>
Fibsy Explores</b></h2>
  <p>Rosemary  and Bryce Collins looked at the detective in blank amazement. Fibsy sat  listening, open-minded and receptive. He knew that if Fleming Stone said the  missing man&#8217;s name was not Henry Johnson, it wasn&#8217;t. But he had no data on  which to hazard a guess as to what the right name might be, so he waited.</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent, however, showed a decided interest in Stone&#8217;s statements.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  you know,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am not surprised to learn that the man used an assumed  name. I suspected it from his little start of surprise when I called him  Johnson, now and then. Just as a man would, if he were using the wrong name,  and forgot it occasionally. But I don&#8217;t understand why you say those are not  his initials on the umbrella. Of course, it might be somebody else&#8217;s umbrella&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Mr. Vincent,&#8221; Stone said, &#8220;it is his umbrella all right. But the initials on it  are J. H. and not H. J.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now  how in the world do you know that?&#8221; Collins exclaimed. &#8220;How can you tell?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because  the H is a trifle larger. Monograms are invariably made with the initial of the  surname larger than the initial of the Christian name, and the H in this case,  though nearly the same size as the J, is, in fact, a little larger and more  prominent. See for yourself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone  left the room a moment and returned with the umbrella, which he had borrowed  from the police and left in the coat room of Greatlarch.</p>
  <p>They  all scrutinized the engraved letters and were forced to the conclusion that  Stone was right.</p>
  <p>&#8220;This  complicates matters,&#8221; Vincent said, thoughtfully. &#8220;He told me his name was  Johnson and that he lived at the Walford, in New York. Perhaps that was also a  fictitious address. And you think his errand about the synthetic rubies was  also faked, Mr. Stone? Then he came purposely to murder my sister&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent was staggered by the thoughts that rushed to his mind consequent upon  these new disclosures of Stone&#8217;s.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  Mr. Stone says that man didn&#8217;t kill Antan!&#8221; put in Rosemary. &#8220;Do you know who  did, Mr. Stone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  positively,&#8221; said Stone. &#8220;I shall have to go down to New York and see what I  can do&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps  he had an accomplice,&#8221; suggested Vincent. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of that before.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  I hadn&#8217;t, either,&#8221; Stone said. &#8220;Perhaps he had. At any rate, I will go down to  New York tomorrow, and I will ask you all to say nothing to any one of my  findings. I speak confidentially to you here, because Mr. Collins is my  employer, and Mr. Vincent and Miss Rosemary are the ones chiefly interested in  avenging the murder.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Aside  from the identity of the murderer, Mr. Stone, how do you explain the locked  door?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  hard to explain, Mr. Vincent. The doctors state the murder was committed not  more than an hour or so before the body was discovered. That makes it about  seven o&#8217;clock or after. But I have talked with the little maid, Francine. and  she vows no one was in or near Miss Vincent&#8217;s room after six, that morning. She  says her room is next to that her mistress occupied and that she was awake from  six o&#8217;clock on. She declares no intruder could have made his way in without her  hearing him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,&#8221;  Vincent spoke seriously, &#8220;then do you still discard my suggestion of possible  supernatural forces, Mr. Stone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  most certainly do, Mr. Vincent. Had the lady been killed by shock or fright,  there might be a reason to consider an apparition or a phantom visitant, but  not even a spook from Spooky Hollow could stab its victim to the heart with a  real dagger.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course not,&#8221; and Homer Vincent sighed and shook his head.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go  on, then,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Now that you have a definite proposition to work on  and a hope of discovering the criminal, I renew my offer of funds for the  enterprise. Go to New York, Mr. Stone, use every endeavor to find out the real  name of the man who called himself Johnson, and send all your bills to me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thank  you, Mr. Vincent,&#8221; Bryce Collins said, gratefully. &#8220;You take a load off my  shoulders! I&#8217;m willing enough to stand all the expense, but I haven&#8217;t your  resources, and mine are running low.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  all right, Bryce,&#8212;the thing must be pushed through. And since Mr. Stone seems  sanguine, I can only hope his quest will succeed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  then, with a murmured word of excuse, Vincent left the room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s  often like that,&#8221; Rosemary said, looking affectionately after him. &#8220;He gets  weary and sad at this continual discussion of Antan&#8217;s murder. Now, he&#8217;ll go and  play the organ.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Which  is just what Vincent did. Soon, they could hear muted strains of soft music  rolling through the house.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  he&#8217;s sad,&#8221; Rosemary reiterated, as she listened a moment to the chords. &#8220;Not  worried or revengeful, so much as deeply sorrowful. I can always tell by what  he plays.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fibsy,  always interested in an unfamiliar phase of human behavior, went softly out  into the marble vestibule that led to the organ room.</p>
  <p>Stepping  up into the balcony that overlooked the great church-like room, the boy  listened to the music Homer Vincent produced.</p>
  <p>Without  musical education Fibsy had a natural appreciation of harmony, and as he raptly  listened he felt almost as if he could read what was in the mind of the player.  At least, he sensed the tragedy that filled the soul of the man at the  keyboard, and realized in part, at any rate, what he suffered.</p>
  <p>Fleming  Stone, alone with the two young lovers, was so gentle, so sympathetic, that  before they knew it they were pouring out to him all the details of the other  tragedy of Rosemary&#8217;s birth.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  must be looked into,&#8221; Stone said, with decision. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure, Miss Vincent, you  would rather know the worst, than to live in ignorance of the truth.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  but the girl hesitated. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. Suppose my mother was&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  look at it like that. Your own refinement and good taste point to an ancestry  of the right sort of people. Don&#8217;t let yourself think otherwise.&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  this speech was not entirely sincere. Stone, always sympathetic in sorrow,  merely said what he could to comfort the girl at the moment. After the murder  business was settled, he proposed to take up the matter of Rosemary&#8217;s  parentage. But he could not attend to both at once and he hated to have her grieve  unnecessarily.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  your uncle is right, to a degree,&#8221; he said, after she and Collins had told the  details of Vincent&#8217;s restrictions. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know him as well as you do, but I  can see he is a high-minded gentleman with a right appreciation of his family  responsibilities. Also, I see how dependent he is for happiness on the creature  comforts of life. A door left open or slammed shut, a delayed answer to his  summons, an intrusion on his hours of privacy,&#8212;any such things would, I am  sure, annoy him to distraction, when another type of man wouldn&#8217;t even notice  them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  just exactly Uncle Homer!&#8221; Rosemary cried. &#8220;You read him perfectly!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  I can read you too, my dear,&#8221; Stone smiled at her. &#8220;You love life and young  society and parties and attentions from the young men. You&#8217;d love to entertain  lavishly in this beautiful home,&#8212;to fill these great rooms with gay and merry  guests, to have all sorts of wonderful clothes and jewels,&#8212;come, now, wouldn&#8217;t  you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  indeed!&#8221; and Rosemary flushed with pleasure at his mere suggestion of such  delights. &#8220;But I know I oughtn&#8217;t to think of such things and I ought to be  deeply grateful to Uncle Homer because he lets me stay here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is true, Rosemary.&#8221; Stone spoke very gravely. &#8220;It might well have been his way  to ask you to live elsewhere. And since he offers you a home here with  stipulations, you should obey him, however unpleasant to you his restrictions  are.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know it,&#8221; but the girl&#8217;s lip quivered a little and her golden-brown eyes filled  with tears at thought of her stained name as well as her uncongenial life.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  sure your uncle has no further knowledge of your mother than he has told you?&#8221;  Stone inquired. &#8220;He&#8217;s not the sort of man to conceal some fact that he thinks  might make you even more sad than you are now?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  I don&#8217;t think so,&#8212;do you, Bryce?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir, I don&#8217;t. Mr. Vincent has been frank and outspoken in all of our  discussions of the subject. I feel grateful to him, as Rosemary does, but I  think he might allow her a little more freedom. However, as soon as I can  persuade her to consent, I mean to marry her, and take her far away from all  people who know her at all. We shall start a new life for ourselves&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  we will not!&#8221; Rosemary said, decidedly. &#8220;I shall never marry anybody. An  illegitimate child has no right to marry.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell  me again,&#8221; Stone said to her, &#8220;of your homecoming that night. You saw no sign  of a guest in the house?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  but that is not strange. I didn&#8217;t look in the general coat room, of course, and  he had left none of his belongings anywhere else.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  went around first, and peeped in at your uncle&#8217;s window. Why did you do that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Partly  to see if he was likely to hear me come in&#8212;it was late&#8212;and partly because I saw  from the driveway a very bright light in that room. An unusually bright light,  so that I thought the room was afire.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  caused it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  only that uncle&#8217;s open fire chanced to be blazing brightly. Then I saw him, and  saw he was so engrossed in his papers and letters that I could take the chance  of slipping in unobserved, and I did.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you saw him putting away something glittering?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  that was the key of the wine cellar. I suppose that he had Mellish get out some  special wine for his visitor.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  my child, I will do all I can for you later on, but now the case of your aunt  will demand all my attention. I want a little talk with your uncle before I go,  but perhaps we&#8217;d better not call him from the organ. I also want to talk with  the maid who assisted your butler in serving at the table the night Mr. Johnson  was here. Will you call her, please, and leave us together?&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  waitress, Katie, was summoned; and, a trifle shy, she came in and stood before  the detective.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sit  down, Katie,&#8221; he said, kindly. &#8220;Now, I&#8217;m not going to ask you anything of great  importance, just try to remember anything Mr. Johnson may have said at the  table that night. Anything at all. I don&#8217;t suppose you pay much attention to  the talk of the guests as you wait on them, but you may recollect something he  said&#8212;try now.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t remember a thing,&#8221; the girl declared, and she was so positive, Stone  wondered at first if some one had forbidden her to speak.</p>
  <p>But  he discarded that idea when Katie, under the influence of his encouraging  smiles, began to recollect a stray word or two.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  said the house was pretty&#8212;&#8221; she vouchsafed at last, with a timid air.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  Stone egged her on. &#8220;And did he say anything about his own home&#8212;where he lived?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes,&#8212;he said he came from New York,&#8212;but I don&#8217;t think he lived there, because  he said, &#8216;what fine hotels there are in New York.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;To  be sure. And maybe he mentioned the one he was staying at&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  he did that! He said he left his trunk at the Vandermore, and that was why he  didn&#8217;t have any evening clothes to wear here. He said he didn&#8217;t expect to stay here  overnight&#8212;but he was glad he did because he liked the house so much.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  crazy over the house, wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  he was, sir. And he said, if he ever had a voice in the matter he&#8217;d cut out a  lot of trees,&#8212;he thought there were too many.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,  did he expect to buy the house?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no, sir, he was just joking,&#8212;you could tell that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course. Anything else?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir, but one time I heard him mention Miss Rosemary&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  if he knew her?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir, more as if he wanted Mr. Vincent or Miss Vincent to tell him something  about her. More as if he had heard of her&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  see. Most natural, I&#8217;m sure. Well, Katie, you gathered he had never been here  before?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no sir, I&#8217;m sure he hadn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  run along,&#8212;Katie. If you think of anything more you heard the gentleman say,  you can let me know. Tell Mellish to bring you to me, in such a case.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir,&#8212;thank you, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>With  a shy little curtsey, Katie went away, and Stone went in search of the master  of the house.</p>
  <p>The  organ music had stopped so Stone was not surprised to find Vincent in his Tower  room.</p>
  <p>The  detective was really as much impressed and interested as the mysterious Johnson  in the architecture and decoration of the house, but he felt he had no time to  waste in idle enjoyment of its beauties.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wonderful  place,&#8221; he said to his host, as he entered, after a knock at the closed door. &#8220;You  found many secret hiding-places or sliding panels, perhaps?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Several,&#8221;  Vincent told him. &#8220;Not so very secret, though. See, the one in this room opens  by merely pressing this knob. And the knob is not hard to discern if any one  looks closely for it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  true,&#8221; and Stone watched as Vincent turned the little knob and the panel slid  smoothly and noiselessly back.</p>
  <p>It  exposed a recess with two or three shelves,&#8212;merely a concealed cupboard, large  enough to contain half a dozen good-sized boxes which evidently held papers of  value.</p>
  <p>&#8220;This  is my safe-deposit vault, Mr. Stone,&#8221; Vincent said, smiling. &#8220;I have no other.  I&#8217;m a man of simple habits, and all my papers or documents of any importance  are in here. They are of no value to any one but myself&#8212;I mean they are of no  money value. My stocks and bonds are at my banker&#8217;s. But here I keep my will,  my deeds to this house, and my private correspondence.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  the papers regarding Miss Rosemary&#8217;s parentage,&#8221; Stone said. &#8220;May I see those?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221;  and Vincent gave him the large bundles of his brother&#8217;s letters.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is a distressing subject,&#8221; Vincent said. &#8220;I have always known that Rosemary was  Carl&#8217;s adopted daughter, but I did not know, until young Collins learned it in  France, that she is also his illegitimate child. I feel that I have my share of  sorrow, Mr. Stone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  surely have, Mr. Vincent, and I realize the shock it was to you to learn this  truth about your brother, just after the awful tragedy of your sister&#8217;s death.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.  And that is one reason why I cannot consent to have guests and laughter and  gayety about my home. Rosemary is not without sensibilities, not without  appreciation of the depth of my sorrow, but she is young and she is of an  exceptionally volatile, light-hearted disposition. And, though, of course, she  does not wish entertainment and frivolities now, yet she does want the  companionship of her young friends, and I confess their very presence wears on  my nerves so that I have to beg her to refrain from asking them here. You may  not understand it, Mr. Stone, but I am a peculiar man, and the life of a hermit  best suits my tastes and inclinations.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do understand, Mr. Vincent, and I see clearly that you could not live with any  degree of peace and contentment with young visitors about.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  if Rosemary were my own niece,&#8212;I mean a legitimate Vincent, the case would be  different. But as things are, I feel that I am not overstepping my rights to  insist on conducting my household as I wish.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  certainly are not. I feel deeply sorry for you and your niece both. I could  wish you had never learned the truth of her parentage.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  heartily wish that, too, but in a way it brings her nearer to me to know that  she was Carl&#8217;s daughter, even though born out of wedlock.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is a hard case, any way you look at it,&#8221; and then Stone went back to his  quarters at the inn.</p>
  <p>Late  that afternoon, Fibsy told of his investigation of the jungle known as Spooky  Hollow.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Gee!  it&#8217;s some place!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I put on my old clothes, for I got  well muddied up!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  did you find?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mud,  muck, and morass,&#8221; returned the boy, succinctly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  you know what morass means?&#8221; Stone asked, smiling.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  bet I do. I lived near one at home, when I was a kid. It&#8217;s a sort of swamp that&#8217;s  mighty hard to walk on, and if it&#8217;s morassy enough it sucks you down in, and  you&#8217;re a goner! That&#8217;s what a morass is.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did  you see any reason to think Mr. Johnson might have been sucked in?&#8221; Stone spoke  seriously.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  F. S., no reason to think so. Of course, he mighta done so,&#8212;but I can&#8217;t see it.  Why, even if he went strolling about the grounds and got stuck in the swamp,  even got sucked in and sank down outa sight,&#8212;why, of course that would have  been in the evening like,&#8212;and if he had done that, he couldn&#8217;t have killed the  lady. It&#8217;s unpossible he could have done any strolling about after he killed  her,&#8212;&#8217;long about seven o&#8217;clock in the morning. After that murder he had all he  could do to hasten off to hide himself. And, anyway, I don&#8217;t know&#8217;s the morass  is as bad as that. I tested it,&#8212;I took off my coat&#8212;it was my old one,&#8212;and I  wrapped up a big stone in it. Then I flung it out into the softest-looking  spot.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  happened?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  went down,&#8212;it was sucked in. But that was, after all, only a small bundle  compared to a whole man. And, too, if he had found himself sinking, in a place  like that, he&#8217;d a set up a yell, wouldn&#8217;t he? And somebody&#8217;d heard him, wouldn&#8217;t  they? No, I can&#8217;t connect up friend Johnson&#8217;s disappearance with that quagmirey  place. I don&#8217;t say a man couldn&#8217;t sink there, but I say there&#8217;s no theory of  the crime that would take him out there after the lady was dead.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  perfectly true. And even if he strolled round the grounds late that night, it  must have been before midnight, or the watchman would have seen him. And, too,  I can imagine his strolling in the gardens, but late at night a man doesn&#8217;t  venture into such a messy place as you make out Spooky Hollow to be. See any  spooks there?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  a sign of one. It isn&#8217;t such a bad place, you know. Except for a few mucky  holes, it&#8217;s fairly good going, and the tangle of vines and low evergreens is  wild and weird in the extreme.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone  suppressed a smile at the boy&#8217;s diction, for he knew he was trying to improve  his English, and if occasionally he erred on the side of stilted speech, it was  wiser not to notice it.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  heard the Wild Harp?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir, I didn&#8217;t, though I listened out for it. Also, I looked good for wires,&#8212;for  I&#8217;ve been thinking it might be some rigged-up contraption. But nary sign of  wires or olian harp strings or anything but trees and shrubs and scrubs and  general rank undergrowth.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  McGuire, how do you size up the whole thing?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fibsy  was flattered,&#8212;doubly so, at being called by his surname, and by having his  opinion seriously asked.</p>
  <p>He  considered before speaking and then said:</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  no use, F. Stone,&#8212;I can&#8217;t size it up at all. It&#8217;s too many for me. I&#8217;ve  sometimes had glimmerings of wit about deducing things, but this time, I&#8217;m up a  stump for fair. But of one thing I am sure. That there wild and wicked harp  must play, for so many people have heard it. From His Nibs and Miss Rosy Posy,  down to the lowest and littlest of the servant-girls, most of them have heard  it at one time or another.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Except  old Mellish. He vows he never has, and there&#8217;s a twinkle in his eye whenever he  speaks of it. So, leave that Harp to me. I&#8217;m going to find out about it,&#8212;and,  oh, gee! what a dunderhead I am! Why I&#8217;ve got it now! I see through the Wild  Harp! Well, I <i>am</i> a dumb-bell, that&#8217;s  what I am!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Suppose  you stop your careful estimation of yourself and tell me your astounding  discovery.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  just yet,&#8212;oh, give me a chance to make sure. But I&#8217;ll tell you this, F. Stone,  that harp is played by human fingers, and those same fingers are on the mitt of  that dough-faced butler! That&#8217;s who&#8217;s responsible for them wailings and  goings-on of that phantom harp! Phantom, indeed! If Mellish is a phantom!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  you think he manipulates the Harp. What for, may I ask?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,&#8221;  Fibsy was very serious, &#8220;I should say as he rigged it up at first to tease his  wife. She&#8217;s a scary sort of thing, and terribly afraid of ghosts. And having  Spooky Hollow ready-made for him as you may say, I take it he just fixed up the  harp arrangement for fun.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  after Miss Vincent&#8217;s death, you think he kept on with his joke?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t see any other way out. Some people have a perverted sense of humor, sir,  and he may have thought it added to the dramatic side of things to have the  harp wailing and moaning out there.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  how did he work it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  what I&#8217;m going to figger out. I can do it, I know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  go to it, Fibs. Now, I&#8217;m leaving for New York to-night, and I want you to stand  by till I return. Don&#8217;t do anything definite, but keep your eyes and ears open  and learn anything you can.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir, and I&#8217;ll get next to the Harp player, and mark my word, it&#8217;ll turn out to  be Mellish.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very  well, look into it, if you like. But I can&#8217;t feel that the Harp-playing,  whether Mellish&#8217;s work or not, has any real bearing on the case. Here&#8217;s an  address that will always reach me,&#8212;I may have to go further than New York. Go  over to Greatlarch now and then, to keep in touch with what they are all doing.  Otherwise, just hold the fort till I get back.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Mr. Stone, but for the land&#8217;s sake, do write me or wire me if you get on to  anything. For I&#8217;m burning alive with curiosity.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  am I, Fibsy,&#8221; said Stone.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky17"></a>Chapter 17 <br>
Finch&#8217;s Story</b></h2>
  <p>The  first thing Fleming Stone did, on reaching New York, was to visit the two  jewelers whose addresses were on the cards given him by Homer Vincent.</p>
  <p>As  he had expected, they both denied all knowledge of any one named Henry Johnson,  and declared he must have been an impostor.</p>
  <p>Both,  also, referred to a man named Markheim, who had a secret process for  manufacturing what are known as synthetic rubies. This man, they said, was an  honest and honorable person, who made no claim for his goods beyond just what  they were. He wanted to make imitation rubies and sell them for imitation rubies,&#8212;that  was all.</p>
  <p>At  Stone&#8217;s request they willingly gave him Markheim&#8217;s address, and the detective  went at once to see him.</p>
  <p>He  found the inventor a quiet, reserved, almost sullen sort of a man, but he  roused to a real pitch of fury, when Stone told him of Henry Johnson&#8217;s errand  to Greatlarch in the interests of ruby manufacturing.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  does he mean?&#8221; Markheim cried out. &#8220;He cannot make rubies! Has he my knowledge?  Has he my secret? Why, sir, he is a terrible impostor!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  other men than you may have a formula,&#8212;may have invented a process&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nevertheless,  he is an impostor. The fact that he used those two jewelers&#8217; names, proves  that! Those men gave me their cards as references out of their good will and  confidence in my honesty. That&#8217;s all they vouched for,&#8212;my honesty and good  faith. I told Mr. Vincent that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did  you see Miss Vincent?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No.  I saw no lady there,&#8212;only Mr. Homer Vincent, the owner of that great and  wonderful house,&#8212;Greatlarch, the place is called.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8212;now,  we must admit there&#8217;s a queer proposition here. How did this Mr. Johnson get  hold of those two cards&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  any one can get jewelers&#8217; cards! Pick them up from the counter, or&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  is it not strange that he selected the very two that you used?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is a coincidence, to be sure,&#8212;but they are first-class and representative  firms,&#8212;it could be he would choose those&#8212;yet,&#8212;yes, it is strange. Still, it is  so. He gave the names to Mr. Vincent&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  did Mr. Vincent treat you, Mr. Markheim? I mean, was he interested in your  project?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  at all. He treated me most politely, even courteously, but he would have none  of my business. He said his money was all invested in the sort of securities he  liked best, and he would not think of making any changes. Moreover, he said he  didn&#8217;t wish to enter into any business proposition. He said such things wearied  him, the financial details bored him, and he far preferred stocks or bonds  where there was no responsibility or work involved. But he was very nice about  it, and after our chat he invited me to remain for luncheon and I did so. My!  what a house! I never saw its like! And the luncheon! It was fine&#8212;without being  too elaborate or magnificent. I enjoyed myself, I can tell you!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  remember the butler?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  somewhat. He seemed a character in his way,&#8212;but his principal thought,&#8212;I may  say his life-work, is quite evidently to smooth the path of his master and keep  it free of all thorns or obstacles to his comfort&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  are a good deal of a character-reader. Mellish is just as you describe. Now,  how did you size up Mellish&#8217;s master?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  a first-class fine gentleman. The real thing, you understand. No shoddy or <i>nouveau riche</i> there. A gentleman of the  old school, scholarly, refined, musical, and used to the very best of  belongings and surroundings.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you saw no ladies at luncheon?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  now that you mention it, I remember Mr. Vincent spoke of a sister and, I think,  a niece, who were out for luncheon that day.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.  Well, Mr. Markheim, I am obliged to you for this interview. Oh, by the way, you  left two rubies with Mr. Vincent?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  I did not. I had a few with me, and I showed them to him, but I didn&#8217;t leave  any with him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  didn&#8217;t forget them,&#8212;or leave them by mistake?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  sure I did not. My rubies are of small worth compared to real stones, but also,  they have considerable market value, and I certainly did not leave any around  carelessly. I left the two cards only. One was a bit soiled&#8212;the other quite  fresh.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;H&#8217;m.  Now, one last question. Do you know any one who could possibly be interested in  marketing synthetic rubies, even though he did not himself manufacture them? I  don&#8217;t mean Henry Johnson,&#8212;but, say, some one whose initials are J. H.?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir. I don&#8217;t know of any one except myself who is interested in such things in  my way. My process is my own invention and I have carefully guarded my secret.  I suppose there are others on the same quest but I know none by name, nor do I  think any one has the idea that I have. And I shall yet succeed. I have a  patron who is about ready to finance my work, and I mean to make good.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  hope you will, Mr. Markheim, I sincerely do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>As  Fleming Stone went away from the interview, his thoughts ran swiftly over the  situation.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  very strange that two men should approach Homer Vincent on the same subject so  near together. It&#8217;s even more strange that they gave the same two  references,&#8212;that they both gave the jewelers&#8217; cards. Why didn&#8217;t one of them  merely give the firms&#8217; names? But perhaps he did. Perhaps Johnson only  mentioned them as well-known jewelers, and Vincent, having their cards, gave  them up as memoranda. At any rate, Markheim is an honest man,&#8212;and, so far as I  can see now, Johnson is a fraud. Yet maybe he only wanted to conceal his real  name until he learned if Mr. Vincent would put his money in the business. Of  course, these inventors with secrets keep mighty close about their affairs. But  I still suspect Johnson&#8212;as he called himself&#8212;of double dealing somehow, and I  must track him down. Guess I&#8217;ll try the Vandermore next.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  room clerk at the big hotel was not anxious to help in the search for an  unknown name with initials J. H., but impressed by the hint of a police  investigation, he turned over to Stone the lists of names for the dates he  mentioned.</p>
  <p>Allowing  that the man had registered a few days before he went up to Vermont, Fleming  Stone set resolutely to work and found no less than six names during those days  whose initials were J. H.</p>
  <p>But  running down those names was fairly easy, though tedious, and a few hours&#8217; time  showed him that two were respectable citizens of Boston, one was a visiting  Englishman and one a San Francisco millionaire.</p>
  <p>This  left him with a James Harrison, of Mobile, Alabama, and a John Haydock, of  Chicago.</p>
  <p>A  hasty telegram discovered Mr. Harrison to be a clergyman attending a  convention, and Stone was left with only one more chance for success in his  search.</p>
  <p>Following  a sudden flash of inspiration, he went to the Bureau of Missing Persons.</p>
  <p>To  be sure, Haydock, if he were the man, need not be missing from his own  home,&#8212;but then again, he might.</p>
  <p>The  officials at the Bureau were most kind and helpful, and after a look at some  out-of-town records, told Stone that John Haydock was a Chicago broker, was  mysteriously missing, and the police had been searching for him several weeks  with no iota of success.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s  my man!&#8221; Stone cried, &#8220;now, where is he?&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  he said this only to his inner consciousness, not yet ready to let the New York  or Chicago police in on the job; He had his own interests in the case to look  out for, and as it was a most unusual and peculiar case, he concluded to carry  it a little farther by himself.</p>
  <p>Getting  all possible details of Haydock, Stone made for a long-distance telephone and  called the office of John Haydock, in Chicago.</p>
  <p>At  last he was in touch with one Robert Finch, who said he was the chief and  confidential clerk of John Haydock and was eager for news of him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Will  you come to New York?&#8221; Stone asked, &#8220;or must I go out to Chicago?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  come right over,&#8221; Finch promised. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the better plan. My, I&#8217;m  excited at even hearing some word of Mr. Haydock! I can hardly wait to reach  you,&#8212;but I realize you can&#8217;t say much over the telephone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  Stone was not so elated as the Chicago man was. It was a hundred to one that  John Haydock should be the man he was after. Finch had said Haydock was a  broker and had no interest in jewels or precious stones.</p>
  <p>But  Haydock&#8217;s interest might have been a secret one. Stone began to think now, that  Haydock was not the ruby manufacturer, but merely the representative of an  inventor. In this case, the broker would, naturally, keep the matter secret  even from his confidential clerk.</p>
  <p>At  any rate, Fleming Stone determined to try very hard to connect the missing  Chicago man with the H. J. of the umbrella.</p>
  <p>Too  impatient to wait for Finch&#8217;s word on that subject, Stone went to the  haberdashery where the umbrella had been bought.</p>
  <p>They  could not trace the purchaser, as Stone had not the umbrella with him, but they  declared the monogram had not been put on by them.</p>
  <p>Also,  as Stone described and drew a rough sketch of the letters they entirely agreed  with him that the order of the two letters was J. H. and not H. J.</p>
  <p>This  satisfied Stone that the caller at Greatlarch used a fictitious name, whatever  else his claims to honesty might be.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  a clever duck, too,&#8221; Stone mused; &#8220;used a name with the letters the other way,  so his umbrella would seem to be marked right. Shows an ingenious mind,&#8212;and so,  probably a crook mind. The fact that he&#8217;s a well-known Chicago broker, is no  real guarantee of his honesty and integrity. And I&#8217;ve checked up some of those  rash statements I made to Mr. Vincent and young Collins. Let me see; I said the  man who called was not Henry Johnson, his initials were not H. J., and his  business was not about making synthetic rubies.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  think that&#8217;s all right, so far. But I said, further, that he didn&#8217;t murder Miss  Anne, nor steal her ruby. Some work to prove that! Guess I&#8217;ll await the Finch  person and see where he lands me up.&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  his waiting hours were fraught with wild and hazy conjectures.</p>
  <p>Where  had John Haydock hidden himself? Why had he gone to Greatlarch on a secret  errand? Did his whole ruby proposition merely cloak some other and greater  intention? Did he go there with the sole purpose of killing Anne Vincent,&#8212;and  if so, why?</p>
  <p>Again  came the idea of his being an old lover of the lady,&#8212;perhaps he had sworn to  kill her, because of&#8212;pshaw! all too melodramatic. Miss Vincent, as he pictured  her from all he had heard, was a mild and inoffensive lady, with no dark past,&#8212;yet,  who could tell as to other people&#8217;s dark pasts? And the stranger had known Miss  Vincent before,&#8212;the man Prout had disclosed that fact. Then, say it was the  theft of the ruby that took him there. Ah, that was a little more plausible.  Say he knew Miss Vincent of old, say he knew of the great ruby, and so, he went  there, using an assumed name, and taking his time to compass his design.  Probably he had no intention of murder, but that was necessary to save his own  skin.</p>
  <p>Stone  had said that the man who called himself Johnson didn&#8217;t commit the murder or  steal the ruby,&#8212;but&#8212;the detective had learned a few things since then.</p>
  <p>The  next day Finch came. Stone had rooms for them both at the Vandermore, and as  soon as the young man could get freshened up and eat some luncheon, they started  in on their confab.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Begin  at the beginning,&#8221; asked Stone. &#8220;Tell me all you know of John Haydock, from  your very first acquaintance.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  won&#8217;t be a very long tale,&#8221; Robert Finch replied, as he lighted his cigar. &#8220;About  three years ago, I chanced to hear, through a friend, that Mr. Haydock wanted a  clerk. I applied for the position and got it. I tried my best to make good and  did. He advanced my salary several times and looked upon me as his trustworthy  and confidential clerk. I gave him my best efforts, and since his  disappearance, I have carried on the business just as he always did. It&#8217;s  largely routine work, or I couldn&#8217;t have left the office just now. But I have  an excellent and able assistant who will look after things and I felt my duty  was here, to find John Haydock if possible. Where is he?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  no idea. But we&#8217;ll come to that later. Tell me more about the man. Describe  him, please. Was he dark?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Dark?  I should say he was. I never knew a darker white man. But that did not mean he  was anything but white in his dealings. As honest as the day, just, rather than  generous, and so silent and reserved about his own affairs as to be considered  secretive. He never chatted with me. He talked over the necessary business  matters, he was pleasant, amiable, courteous,&#8212;but never chummy or confidential.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right so far. Now tell me about the day he went away. Where did he say he was  going?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;To  New York. Said he had worked hard and had earned a vacation. Said he would be  gone maybe a week, but not more. Said I needn&#8217;t write unless something of  unusual importance turned up, which wasn&#8217;t likely, for I know as much about the  business as he does.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  did he take for luggage?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know. He rarely went off on vacation trips, but when he did he took  little luggage. Probably a large suitcase and an ordinary overnight bag.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  mean a suitcase too big to cart around much?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  that&#8217;s what I mean. He&#8217;d check that somewhere and go around with a kitbag. At  least, that&#8217;s only my supposition, but it&#8217;s probably about right.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you never heard from him after he left you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  one word.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t  that surprise you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;For  a week or so it didn&#8217;t, and after that, you bet it did! Why, I&#8217;ve been more and  more surprised each day! And surprised isn&#8217;t the word! I&#8217;m utterly dumfounded,  flabbergasted, stunned, shocked, down and out! I don&#8217;t know where I am at! And  if you can give me a hint or a clue, I&#8217;ll follow it to the ends of the earth.  Why, quite aside from my business acquaintance with him, I&#8217;m fond of the man.  As I said, he&#8217;s not very friendly in a chummy way, but he&#8217;s a strong, staunch,  loyal heart, and I&#8217;m grieving quite as much as I&#8217;m wondering.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  have no doubts then of his integrity of soul?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  come now, integrity of soul means a lot. I don&#8217;t know Mr. Haydock well enough  to talk like that about him. But I&#8217;ve no doubt of his business honesty or his  honorable dealing toward me. After that, I know too little of him to discuss  him. Why, you&#8217;ve no idea how reticent he was as to himself,&#8212;personally, I  mean.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  did he come from? Where was he born?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  haven&#8217;t the slightest idea. It isn&#8217;t that I was afraid to ask him of such  matters, but we never met outside of business hours and as he was not  informatively inclined, it would have been silly for me to pester him with  questions.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  see. And you&#8217;ve no idea whether he lived in Chicago all his life or&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, I know that much. He came to live in Chicago about five years ago&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;From  where?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  know that, except I have a dim idea it was from the West.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Was  he like a Westerner?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  specially. He looked more like a foreigner, with his dark hair and sallow skin.  But he was one hundred per cent American, as far as I could see.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  details about him don&#8217;t seem to get us anywhere. Did you ever surmise that he  had any secrets in his life? Any hobby he was following up, or any love affair?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  never heard or saw anything to base any such supposition or surmise on,&#8221; Robert  Finch replied, slowly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  holding back something,&#8221; Stone said, intuitively.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  that&#8217;s the exact truth. His only hobby that I can think of was writing in his  diary. He rarely did any of it at the office, but the few times he did, he  worked at it like a man engrossed in his occupation.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  is his diary?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  always kept it locked up&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you know where.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  I do, I shall not tell, until I have more reason than I have now to think I  shall never see Mr. Haydock again. What sort of a confidential clerk should I  be if I gave up his private papers because he went away and stayed a few weeks  without writing to me? And, now, Mr. Stone, suppose you tell me what you know,  and why you want to find him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Robert  Finch was a good-looking, earnest-faced young man, of a type to be found by  hundreds in the great business offices of our cities. But he was rather above  the average in his appearance of sincerity and fealty to his trust. Stone sized  him up for a faithful custodian of his employer&#8217;s secrets if he knew them, or  of his private papers if he had them.</p>
  <p>In  as few words as possible the detective told Finch the story of the man who went  to Greatlarch, and called himself Henry Johnson. He told of the various matters  that pointed to this man&#8217;s really being John Haydock, and, though at first  unwilling to believe it, Finch was finally convinced that it must be true.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  umbrella!&#8221; he exclaimed as Stone described it minutely; &#8220;I know it well! I  ought to, for I gave it to him myself, more than a year ago, on his birthday. I  thought he&#8217;d like it,&#8212;and I guess he did, only&#8212;well, he seemed to think I was a  bit presumptuous to do it. He made me feel a little ashamed and I never offered  him a present again. However, he often carries it, and I think he likes it&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Would  he use plain black rubber-backed brushes, and only moderately fine underwear?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  exactly. He had money enough, and he was not at all parsimonious, but he  was&#8212;well, I think, frugal is the word. He was always well dressed but not at  all extravagant.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  the things in his kitbag were brand-new,&#8221; Stone vouchsafed.</p>
  <p>Finch  smiled. &#8220;Probably found himself at low tide when he started away. Didn&#8217;t like  to go to a decent hotel with ragged things in his bag, so he stocked up. Yes, I  have to confess it all sounds like Haydock, and as your people mention his dark  coloring, I can&#8217;t see any reason to doubt that it was he who went to Greatlarch  and who introduced himself as Henry Johnson. Why, I cannot imagine.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  never heard him speak of any one named Vincent?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never.  But I never heard him speak of anybody outside our business lists.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  did he do evenings?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  lived in a good bachelor apartment, and he went into good society. He was  moderate in everything. He went to the theatre and concerts now and then, he  went to dinners and all that, but he wasn&#8217;t what you&#8217;d call a regular society  man. I daresay lots of his evenings he spent quietly by himself. But I never  asked him, of course, I&#8217;m judging only by my general knowledge of him and from  such few remarks as he might casually drop while we talked business.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  do you suppose he got hold of this ruby idea?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know. But if somebody put it up to him as a good money-making scheme and  if he thought it was, I can imagine his going up there to interest a  millionaire&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  using a false name?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Possibly.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  stealing a real ruby and murdering a good lady?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No&#8212;&#8221;  Finch spoke cautiously, &#8220;I can&#8217;t say I imagine his doing that&#8212;I can only repeat  I don&#8217;t know the man, and I can&#8217;t say what he would or wouldn&#8217;t do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mellish,  the butler,&#8212;who, by the way, is no common personality,&#8212;says that the man he  calls Henry Johnson has the face of a murderer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Finch  smiled. &#8220;Is there such a thing,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;as the face of a murderer? As I  said, Haydock&#8217;s face is as dark as a Spaniard&#8217;s, but that doesn&#8217;t imply a dark  heart. I&#8217;ve been told a murderer oftenest has a clear bright blue eye.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  been told that, too; in fact, I&#8217;m ready to say there is no such thing as the  typical face of a murderer. And I believe that Mellish founded his suspicion on  the fact of this man&#8217;s very dark effect.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  about suspecting the butler himself of the theft and of the murder? Is he  entirely free from suspicion?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  think so. There&#8217;s no clue or evidence against him. In fact there&#8217;s none against  anybody but Haydock,&#8212;as I shall now call him, for I am convinced of his  identity. But it does seem to be a clear case against him. He appears from  nowhere, gives a wrong name, offers a business proposition which is clearly a  faked one, spends the night, and before dawn disappears. Almost as soon as he  is gone, a murdered woman is found, and an enormous gem is missing. He is never  seen again and his whereabouts cannot be traced. What&#8217;s the answer?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  looks black,&#8221; conceded Finch. &#8220;You know the Chicago police have been hunting  him, but of course they never traced him to Vermont.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  that proves he went there secretly. Had he gone with no attempt at concealment,  he could easily have been traced. I&#8217;m sorry, Mr. Finch, but every detail we  learn from one another seems to draw the net still tighter round the man who  was your employer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  how do you think he got away? Aside from the locked door,&#8212;and I cannot see how  he had a mechanical device handy to turn that key from the outside, when he  could not have foreseen the exact circumstances that would come to him,&#8212;aside  from that, how did he get away from Hilldale, on a cold winter night, without  hat or coat&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  that he might have managed easily,&#8212;the getting out of Hilldale, I mean. But I  don&#8217;t yet understand that locked door. And I do think that the solving of the  mystery hangs on that.&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Spooky18"></a>Chapter 18 <br>
The Terrible Truth</b></h2>
  <p>Robert  Finch willingly accepted Stone&#8217;s invitation to return to Greatlarch with him.  The clerk felt that he must do all in his power to ferret out the mystery of  his employer&#8217;s disappearance, and surely his way lay in the direction of Hilldale.</p>
  <p>On  the journey up, Stone had told his companion of Fibsy, his young assistant, so  Finch was not surprised to see the red-headed lad waiting for them on the steps  of the inn.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  have some finds,&#8221; announced Fibsy. &#8220;Have you any, F. Stone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  yes, Terence, I think I may say I have,&#8212;though I haven&#8217;t yet quite made out  what they mean.&#8221;</p>
  <p>After  the three were settled down in Stone&#8217;s sitting-room, and after Stone had told  the boy a general sum-up of what he had learned from Finch and from the  jewelers, Fibsy took his turn at recital.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  sir,&#8221; he announced, &#8220;I found out who plays that Spook Harp, and as I just felt  sure, F. Stone, it&#8217;s none other than Friend Butler.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mellish!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  same. He has a wireless telephone&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;From  the house?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yep,  from the house, and, well, I can&#8217;t &#8216;zackly explain it, but it&#8217;s this way. He  connected a phonograph with a wireless sending set in his workshop, and then he  transmits the music to a large horn connected with an amplifier which is  concealed in a tree down in that Spooky Hollow.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  understand,&#8221; Stone said, &#8220;you needn&#8217;t try to explain the details of the  mechanism, Fibs; I see how it is done. But&#8212;Mellish never contrived that himself!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  what I think, F. S. I think His Nibs is at the back of it&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Vincent! Nonsense! More likely that chauffeur, he&#8217;s a clever mechanician.  However, I&#8217;ve felt all along that the Wild Harp had nothing to do with the real  mystery or the tragedy; so work on that, Terence, if it amuses you, but if you&#8217;ve  any news of real importance, let&#8217;s have it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  sir, I have. I found the bottle that belongs to that atomizer thing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  did! Now that&#8217;s something worth while. Let&#8217;s see it&#8221;</p>
  <p>Proudly  the boy produced a small vial. It was half full of an antiseptic preparation,  and its label bore the address of a Chicago chemist.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  his,&#8221; Robert Finch said at once. &#8220;That&#8217;s Mr. Haydock&#8217;s&#8212;I&#8217;ve often seen him use  it in his atomizer, during business days, when his catarrh troubled him. Where  did it come from?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone  looked at Fibsy.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now  that&#8217;s the queer part,&#8221; the boy said. &#8220;I burgled Greatlarch, you see&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How?&#8221;  Stone asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  took a chance when Mr. Vincent was playing on his big organ so hard he wouldn&#8217;t  have noticed the German army if they&#8217;d marched through him! Yes, sir, he was  just absorbed,&#8212;he was what you call it? improverising, yes, that&#8217;s it,  improverising. And I slipped into his Tower room, it&#8217;s never locked, and I  investigated that panel. You know he told us himself how to open that panel.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  McGuire.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  sir, I felt sure there was more to it than he told us about. And there was. By  pokin&#8217; around good and plenty, I found another little weeny knob and I pressed  it, and there was another secret panel,&#8212;you know&#8212;inside the first one, way at  the back part.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  this bottle was in there?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Lord, no, sir, that bottle wasn&#8217;t in there! I got my yarn mixed up, I&#8217;m that  excited! No, sir, that bottle was in Mr. Vincent&#8217;s own little medicine chest in  his bathroom, just a settin&#8217; there.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  Mr. Vincent&#8217;s chest, then what has it to do with the Johnson man?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  it&#8217;s a bottle of stuff that could belong to that atomizer thing. It&#8217;s a Chicago  prescription, so maybe it ain&#8217;t Mr. Vincent&#8217;s, and it was sorta hidden away at  the back, so I take it, it was meant to be concealed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;McGuire,  your zeal has run away with you.&#8221; Fleming Stone smiled good-naturedly. &#8220;More  likely, one of the housemaids saw this on Mr. Johnson&#8217;s washstand, and thinking  it belonged to Mr. Vincent, she put it in his bathroom.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maybe,  sir,&#8221; Fibsy&#8217;s freckled face fell, &#8220;only, Mr. Vincent hasn&#8217;t one snipjack of  catarrhal trouble,&#8212;I asked Mellish,&#8212;and the other man had. And there&#8217;s the  Chicago label.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  what are you getting at? You can&#8217;t mean that Mr. Vincent concealed this thing,  purposely&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  somebody did. That Chicago bottle, that just fits up with the atomizer, has no  right to be in the back part of Mr. Vincent&#8217;s medicine chest&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  so, Fibs,&#8221; and Stone looked more thoughtful. &#8220;Well, what was in the back part  of the inner secret cupboard?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  in there, sir, there was nothing but a lot of keys and tags and such things.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  do you mean by such things?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  there was a key to what is most likely a safety deposit box,&#8212;you know how they  look. Then there was the key to the wine closet,&#8212;I know, for it was labeled.  And a key to the big organ,&#8212;a duplicate, I suppose. And an old-fashioned watch- key,&#8212;oh, quite a lot of keys, mostly tagged with brass tags or pasteboard  labels.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Any  of definite importance to us?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  was, sir. That one, though, wasn&#8217;t a key at all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go  on.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  was a check,&#8212;a metal trunk check, from the Hotel Vandermore.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  any one can have a check from any hotel, can&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  F. Stone, I thought it was a check Johnson had for his trunk, you know, and he  brought it up here, and&#8212;somehow he&#8212;it had got hidden away in there,&#8212;and I sent  for it&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  didn&#8217;t! Fibs, you&#8217;re crazy! Whom did you send?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  sent Prout, the taxi man&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good  Lord, child, I&#8217;ll never dare go off and leave you again! It&#8217;s probably a  suitcase with Mr. Vincent&#8217;s dress clothes, that he keeps in New York to go to a  party now and then. Lots of men do that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  Terence McGuire was so evidently on the verge of tears, that Stone tried to  cheer him up.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never  mind, old chap,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the blame. If it&#8217;s Mr. Vincent&#8217;s property,  as it must be, I&#8217;ll tell him! sent for it in an overzealous endeavor to find a  clue!&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  Fibsy would not be comforted. He felt he had done a crazy, unpardonable act,  and Stone knew he would brood over it for a time.</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, little chum,&#8221; the detective said, &#8220;you sit here awhile, and think out  some more bright clues to follow up, and I&#8217;ll take a run over to Greatlarch.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Though  this speech sounded sarcastic to Finch, it comforted Fibsy, for he knew when  his chief jollied him to that extent he was not displeased with him. So he sat  thinking, while the other two started off for the Vincent home.</p>
  <p>First  of all, Stone went for the butler, as that worthy admitted the pair.</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  you&#8217;re the Spook that plays the Harp, are you, Mellish?&#8221; he said, and though  his tone was light, he spoke in earnest.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  yes, sir,&#8212;and yet, I may say I see no harm in it&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  harm, of course, Mellish, but you never rigged up that contraption alone. Who  did it for you? The chauffeur?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  he! He hasn&#8217;t brains enough to play a jews&#8217;-harp. No, sir, I&#8212;I just did it by  myself&#8212;to tease my old woman, you see.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you turn it on and off as you like?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir,&#8212;see, here&#8217;s the thing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Deeply  interested, Stone and Finch followed the butler into a small entry, where, sure  enough, was rigged up a rather elaborate bit of mechanism.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mellish,&#8221;  said Stone, sternly, &#8220;you never did that yourself in this world! Moreover, only  a very ingenious inventor could have done it. And I know who it was. It was  Homer Vincent! He&#8217;s the man who rigged up the wireless and the phonograph, and  he&#8217;s the man who makes the records on his organ! Too easy, Mellish,&#8212;own up.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  sir,&#8212;I may not be free of speech&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  heard you use that phrase before. I know now what you mean by it. You mean you&#8217;re  not free to tell&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir, that&#8217;s it. My master, he&#8217;s a man of strict orders, and I am not allowed to  babble, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Your  master is a strange jumble of talents,&#8221; and Finch looked curiously at the wires  and strings of the device.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Vincent is a man of luxuriant temperament, sir,&#8221; and Mellish raised his hand as  if to ward off further remarks. &#8220;And nothing disturbs him more than to have me  chatter. So, if you will excuse me, gentlemen,&#8212;&#8221; and Mellish simply faded away.</p>
  <p>As  Stone had supposed, he found Homer Vincent in his Tower room, and unannounced,  he led Finch there.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know you will be glad to meet this man, Mr. Vincent,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for he is the  confidential clerk of the man we have been calling Henry Johnson, but whose  name, as it turns out, is John Haydock.&#8221; Vincent looked up interestedly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Take  seats, gentlemen,&#8221; he said, pleasantly, and then acknowledged Stone&#8217;s more  definite introduction of Robert Finch.</p>
  <p>&#8220;John  Haydock,&#8221; he repeated, and it was plain to be seen from his manner that the  name meant nothing to him. &#8220;And why did your employer, my dear sir, come to me  under an assumed name?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  what I&#8217;m here to find out,&#8221; returned Finch, not so much bluntly as determinedly.  &#8220;Suppose, Mr. Vincent, we all put our cards on the table, and see what  conclusions we can come to.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;By  all means, Mr. Finch. Only, I may say, I have already put all my cards on the  table. If I haven&#8217;t, ask any questions you like.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  do that, then,&#8221; Stone said, quickly. &#8220;Why did you not tell us that you were  responsible for the music of the Wild Harp?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent  gave a little smile.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  true, Mr. Stone, I haven&#8217;t been quite frank about that. But it is a case of in  for a penny, in for a pound. I rigged up that thing merely for the amusement  and bewilderment of my friends and my servants. There were stories of hauntings  and weird sounds and sights in the wild garden they have named Spooky Hollow,  and I thought I&#8217;d just give them a jolt now and then. And, later, when it began  to affect my household and family, I still kept on, to surprise and astound  them. Mellish helped me, he turned on the instrument when I ordered him to. And  he enjoyed his wife&#8217;s thrills at the seemingly supernatural music.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,  Mr. Stone, when tragedy came to me, I didn&#8217;t feel like revealing the secret of  my joking deceit, so I let the matter rest, even using it now and then when I  felt inclined, I am a strange man, Mr. Stone, many call me a freak or an  eccentric But, really, all I ask is to be let alone, all I wish to do is to  enjoy myself in my own way, which never interferes with the doings of any one  else. I am perhaps a slave to my creature comforts, I own I like luxurious  living and beautiful appointments, but surely those are innocent hobbies if a man  can afford them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Entirely  so,&#8221; Stone said; &#8220;now, Mr. Vincent, we are striving to find this Haydock, as we  now call him. You never heard of John Haydock?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never,  Mr. Stone. Who is he?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  Chicago broker. Will you please let me see those cards he brought you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Certainly,  here they are.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone  scrutinized them and noted that one was considerably soiled, the other  comparatively fresh.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Vincent,&#8221; he said, &#8220;these cards were given you by Mr. Markheim, who came first  to see you about synthetic rubies. Not by Mr. Johnson, as he then called  himself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  daresay,&#8221; Vincent spoke disinterestedly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember saying that Johnson  left the cards here. I only said Johnson gave those references, and I gave the  cards to the detectives as a memorandum of the jewelers&#8217; addresses.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  see. Now, as John Haydock was not interested in making rubies, so Mr. Finch  tells me, and as he gave you a wrong name, do you not think the man&#8217;s motive in  coming here was something other than ruby making?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good  heavens, man, of course I think so. He came here to kill my sister, to steal  her ruby, and perhaps to kill me, too! Of course, his ruby story was a blind!  Probably in order to induce my sister to exhibit her wonderful jewel.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I think he knew you before he came, Mr. Vincent.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Impossible,  or he would never have given the wrong name.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps  you knew him by both names.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  never knew him by either name. He was a total stranger to me. They say he knew  of my broken leg, some years since. That he knew of my sister and my niece.  These things may all be so, but he never knew me, nor did I know him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  here we are!&#8221; and a young voice announced the arrival of Fibsy, accompanied by  Prout, the taxi man, lugging an enormous suitcase.</p>
  <p>They  were followed by Rosemary and young Collins, who were anxious to learn the  cause of the excitement</p>
  <p>Prout  set down the suitcase, which bore the initials J. H., and Finch said, at once, &#8220;That  is Mr, Haydock&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Aha,&#8221;  said Fibsy, with a side wink at Stone, knowing full well that if the thing  turned out to be of importance, Stone would be the first to praise him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  locked,&#8221; said Stone, &#8220;call your butler, please, Mr. Vincent.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Homer  Vincent pressed a button, and Stone dismissed the taxi man, saying he would be  paid for his time and trouble later on.</p>
  <p>&#8220;We  don&#8217;t want him about,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this may be of importance as evidence.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Without  asking permission, he ordered Mellish to bring a wrench and hammer, and in a  few moments the suitcase was opened.</p>
  <p>It  appeared to be filled with the ordinary clothing of a plain business man, and  nothing of interest was seen until near the bottom they found a small thick  book.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is Mr. Haydock&#8217;s diary,&#8221; Finch said. &#8220;Give it to me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Without  a word, Stone handed it over, but he gave a look at Finch that said volumes.</p>
  <p>In  a moment Finch was absorbed in the contents. &#8220;I feel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that though  this is not meant for other eyes than his own, yet because of the stigma  already cast upon him, and his inability to speak for himself, this diary,&#8212;some  parts of it at least, should be read aloud&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;By  all means,&#8221; said Homer Vincent, seeming truly interested at last, &#8220;let us hear  it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  portions that Finch read were written during the days just preceding Haydock&#8217;s  late departure from Chicago for New York.</p>
  <p>And  to the amazement of everybody, he had gone to New York, and from there to  Hilldale, to see Rosemary Vincent!</p>
  <p>It  transpired that five years ago, at the time of Carl Vincent&#8217;s death, Haydock  had been Carl Vincent&#8217;s clerk. He had seen and admired Rosemary, though she had  never specially noticed him. He was eight or ten years older than the girl, but  he had never outgrown the infatuation that he felt for her. He determined to  work hard and earn a fortune, and when this was accomplished, he proposed to go  in search of Rosemary and try to win her for his own.</p>
  <p>All  this he did, and the diary detailed his journey to New York, his outfitting  himself with new clothing, and his departure for Vermont.</p>
  <p>He  had left the diary in his large suitcase, checked at his hotel, and it was the  check for this that Fibsy had found in Homer Vincent&#8217;s second secret panel and  had sent down to the hotel by Prout.</p>
  <p>The  advent of John Haydock was explained There was no further doubt about that. For  nobody could question the sincerity of those entries in the diary that told of  his never-forgotten admiration and his hopes of yet winning sweet Rosemary  Vincent.</p>
  <p>The  tears came to the girl&#8217;s eyes as she heard the simple, homely tribute to her  charms. She almost wished she could see and thank the man who admired and loved  her like that.</p>
  <p>Bryce  Collins looked stupefied. Who was this man coming to seek his Rosemary? But  even these thoughts were quickly supplanted by Fleming Stone&#8217;s stern query, &#8220;How  came the check for this suitcase in your secret cupboard, Mr. Vincent?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Bless  my soul, I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; and the man looked utterly bewildered. &#8220;I can only  suspect some of my servants&#8212;or some intruder&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  same one that put the Chicago man&#8217;s bottle of medicine in your bathroom, maybe,&#8221;  suggested Fibsy.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s  another reference to your father, Miss Vincent,&#8221; Finch said, as he skimmed  through the diary.</p>
  <p>The  item referred to some papers of Carl Vincent&#8217;s that Haydock had only recently  found. He mentioned coming across an old box, that he had thought contained  merely old check-books, but on turning them out, he had discovered underneath a  packet of papers which he thought would be of interest to Rosemary and he  proposed to take them to her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  are they?&#8221; asked the girl, looking wonderingly about.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  what I&#8217;d like to know,&#8221; her uncle said. &#8220;I, too, am interested in anything  pertaining to my brother, Rosemary.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Uncle, of course you are. Oh, where do you suppose Mr. Haydock is? Uncle, the  man that wrote that diary, never could have killed Antan!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  doesn&#8217;t seem so, certainly,&#8221; said Vincent, seeming nonplussed. &#8220;Mr. Stone, here&#8217;s  a big problem for you now. Can you work it out?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can,&#8221; cried Fibsy, &#8220;at least, I can help. I can tell you where Mr. Haydock  is,&#8212;probably.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  lad looked solemn, and Stone gazed at him curiously. Was he getting greater  than his master? This was no feeling of jealousy or rivalry on the part of the  older detective. He loved the boy, and took pride in all his successes. But he  was afraid, in his eagerness and intrepidity, Fibsy might over-reach himself.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s  down in Spooky Hollow,&#8221; he said, with such a lugubrious face that they all felt  horrified.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sure,  McGuire?&#8221; asked Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir, I ain&#8217;t quite sure,&#8212;but I don&#8217;t see where else he can be. First off,&#8221; he  looked round solemnly at his hearers, &#8220;there&#8217;s a fearful quagmire down in that  hollow. It&#8217;s about six feet from the east border. And, you remember, that  cigarette-holder was found on the east lawn.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s  that got to do with it?&#8221; exclaimed Collins.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  now,&#8221; Fibsy went on, too earnest to note the interruption, &#8220;I tried tying up a  stone in my coat, and it sunk in the place. Yesterday after dark, I&#8212;&#8221; he seemed  to hesitate to tell of his deed,&#8212;&#8221; I bought a whole pig of the butcher, as big  a one as I could manage, and I pushed that in. It went down in the quicksand of  that swamp in less time than it takes to tell it! The muck is all dark-brown  and quivering. The approach to it is slippery and treacherous, but there it is.  Now listen here. After Mr. Vincent left that man to go to bed that night where&#8217;d  he go? He never prowled the house all night long. He went out in the grounds  and he&#8212;he fell into that place. As he went down, he flung his cigarette-holder  as far as he could, as a sort of guide to where he met his death.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  why he had no hat or coat,&#8221; Stone said, musingly. &#8220;Probably stepped down off  the verandah, not meaning to stay out long.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Poor  fellow!&#8221; said Vincent, &#8220;how horrible. I had no idea that pit was as bad as  that! I&#8217;ve been intending to have it drained and dried; I shall certainly do  so. At least, we can avert another such tragedy.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,  do not avoid the issue, gentlemen. Did not Haydock necessarily come to his  death after he had killed my sister?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Vincent,&#8221; Stone said, &#8220;you know I told you the man who came to see you was not  named Johnson, was not initialled H. J., did not come to discuss making rubies,  did not kill your sister, and did not steal her ruby. To all of those  statements I adhere.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  do? Then find the murderer! Find the man who killed my sister! Can you do that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  think I can,&#8221; and Stone nodded his head, thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Listen,  please, all of you. This murder of Miss Vincent is in every respect the worst I  have ever known&#8212;the most fiendishly contrived and the most brutally carried out.  The murderer is&#8212;Homer Vincent.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Vincent  stared at the speaker, but smiled a little indulgently, as one might at a  harmless maniac.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,&#8221;  Fibsy spoke in an awed whisper, &#8220;then he&#8217;s a double-dyed dastard, for he  murdered John Haydock!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What?&#8221;  cried Finch.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  he did. Out there beside the quagmire is a piece of planking that has  footprints on it. Those are Mr. Vincent&#8217;s prints, but Lord, there&#8217;s enough else  to prove everything!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  is indeed,&#8221; Stone added, &#8220;and here is the motive. After you found the second  secret panel, McGuire, I thought there might be a third. There is. The tiniest  speck of a pinhead knob, when pressed sideways, opens a third concealed recess,  and in it I have found,&#8212;first, Miss Vincent&#8217;s ruby, now Miss Rosemary&#8217;s  property, and what is even more valuable to her,&#8212;is this.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He  gave her a folded paper, while Homer Vincent sat as if turned to stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  fiend!&#8221; he said to Stone, &#8220;you devil incarnate!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Keep  those epithets for yourself,&#8221; the detective said, coolly. &#8220;Are you going to  confess?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am.&#8221; Homer Vincent&#8217;s voice rang out. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell the truth for the last  time in my life. I did kill John Haydock, because he knew the secret of my  niece&#8217;s birth&#8212;knew that she is the legitimate daughter of my brother and his  wife, Mary Leslie. They were married twice, really. The first time, secretly,  because her mother objected. Her little girl was born and baptized, also  secretly, but entirely legally, in France, and put in an asylum there, because  Mary&#8217;s mother would not have forgiven them had she known of it.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Later  the mother died, and my brother and his wife were married again, publicly.  Then, when their baby was born and died, they adopted from the asylum the  little Rosemary, who was their own legitimate child. But, when my brother died,  five years ago, and left me trustee of Rosemary&#8217;s fortune, I was tempted and  fell. I took it all myself, bought this splendid house, and have lived here in  the luxury I love ever since.</p>
  <p>&#8220;When  Haydock came,&#8212;yes, the ruby story I made up entirely myself,&#8212;Haydock never  spoke to me of rubies,&#8212;he talked only of Rosemary&#8217;s parentage, so I,  remembering the other ruby man, pretended Johnson came on the same business. He  told me himself that he sent in his name as Johnson, for fear I would refuse to  see Haydock. Lord, I had forgotten him entirely! Well, when he told me that he  knew all about Rosemary, and threatened to expose the whole story unless I  forced her to marry him, I couldn&#8217;t see any way to keep my beautiful home and  to save the girl from a loveless marriage except by putting Haydock out of the  way.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  was not difficult. We strolled in the garden, went down to inspect Spooky  Hollow, and&#8212;I pushed him in. He struggled like fury,&#8212;flinging his arms about.  You know the more they struggle, the quicker they sink.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  your sister?&#8221; said Stone, hardly able to overcome his repugnance at speaking to  this creature, scarce human he seemed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,&#8221;  Vincent looked reminiscent. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to&#8212;but she declared she was going to  tell the truth about the girl. I couldn&#8217;t have that,&#8212;can&#8217;t you understand&#8221;&#8212;he  spoke almost pettishly&#8212;&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t live elsewhere than in this house,&#8212;and of  course I couldn&#8217;t live here if Rosemary took all her money. I have no money at  all. I spent all mine for this place; it is what my brother left that runs the  establishment.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  did you kill your sister?&#8221; asked Stone, his dark eyes fixed inexorably on  Vincent&#8217;s face.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  you will never know,&#8221; and, with a smile of diabolical cunning, Vincent slipped  into his mouth a small object which Stone knew to be a poison tablet.</p>
  <p>But  it was too late to stop him, and Stone thought pityingly of Rosemary. Perhaps  that death for her uncle was easiest for the niece.</p>
  <p>And  while there was yet life in the body of the wicked man, Stone shouted the truth  at him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do know. You stabbed her yourself, after the door was burst open. You gave her  extra sleeping drops to be sure of her sleeping late in the morning. When they  couldn&#8217;t waken her, you broke through the door, rushed in, and bending over the  living woman, stabbed her to the heart, and with the protection of her long,  heavy bed-curtains, you were able to draw out the knife unseen. The knife you  probably threw into the quicksand. Also, you stole her ruby! Am I right?&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  with a smile, still horrible, even demoniacal, the dying man murmured, &#8220;You are  right&#8221; He never spoke again.</p>
  <p>At  a gesture from Stone, Bryce Collins led Rosemary away.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  cry so, dearest,&#8221; he said, tenderly. &#8220;Such a fiend isn&#8217;t worth your tears.  Come, I will take you at once to my mother&#8212;oh, darling, just think, there is no  reason, now, why she won&#8217;t receive you!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thank  God for my birthright,&#8221; said the girl, reverently. &#8220;And,&#8221; she added, looking  into his eyes, &#8220;for your love, dear heart&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;My  beloved,&#8221; he whispered, as he held her close, &#8220;as you know, I wanted you with  any name or no name, but I am glad,&#8212;glad, dear, that we can give our children a  goodly heritage. Bless you, my Rosemary, my darling.&#8221;</p>

The Letter That Said Come</b></h2>
  <p>As  the character of a woman may be accurately deduced from her handkerchief, so a  man&#8217;s mental status is evident from the way he opens his mail.</p>
  <p>Curtis  Keefe, engaged in this daily performance, slit the envelopes neatly and laid  the letters down in three piles. These divisions represented matters known to  be of no great interest; matters known to be important; and, third, letters  with contents as yet unknown and therefore of problematical value.</p>
  <p>The  first two piles were, as usual, dispatched quickly, and the real attention of  the secretary centred with pleasant anticipation on the third lot.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Gee  whiz, Genevieve!&#8221;</p>
  <p>As  no further pearls of wisdom fell from the lips of the engrossed reader of  letters, the stenographer gave him a round-eyed glance and then continued her  work.</p>
  <p>Curtis  Keefe was, of course, called Curt by his intimates, and while it may be the  obvious nickname was brought about by his short and concise manner of speech,  it is more probable that the abbreviation was largely responsible for his habit  of curtness.</p>
  <p>Anyway,  Keefe had long cultivated a crisp, abrupt style of conversation. That is, until  he fell in with Samuel Appleby. That worthy ex-governor, while in the act of  engaging Keefe to be his confidential secretary, observed: &#8220;They call you Curt,  do they? Well, see to it that it is short for courtesy.&#8221;</p>
  <p>This  was only one of several equally sound bits of advice from the same source, and  as Keefe had an eye single to the glory of self-advancement, he kept all these  things and pondered them in his heart.</p>
  <p>The  result was that ten years of association with Lawyer Appleby had greatly  improved the young man&#8217;s manner, and though still brief of speech, his curtness  had lost its unpleasantly sharp edge and his courtesy had developed into a  dignified urbanity, so that though still Curt Keefe, it was in name only.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s  the pretty letter all about, Curtie?&#8221; asked the observant stenographer, who had  noticed his third reading of the short missive.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll  probably answer it soon, and then you&#8217;ll know,&#8221; was the reply, as Keefe  restored the sheet to its envelope and took up the next letter.</p>
  <p>Genevieve  Lane produced her vanity-case, and became absorbed in its possibilities.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  wish I didn&#8217;t have to work,&#8221; she sighed; &#8220;I wish I was an opera singer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;&#8216;Cromwell,  I charge thee, fling away ambition,&#8217; murmured Keefe, his eyes still scanning  letters; &#8216;by that sin fell the angels,&#8217; and it&#8217;s true you are angelic, Viva, so  down you&#8217;ll go, if you fall for ambition.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  you talk! Ambition is a good thing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only  when tempered by common sense and perspicacity&#8212;neither of which you possess to  a marked degree.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Pooh!  You&#8217;re ambitious yourself, Curt.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;With  the before-mentioned qualifications. Look here, Viva, here&#8217;s a line for you to  remember. I ran across it in a book. &#8216;If you do only what is absolutely correct  and say only what is absolutely correct&#8212;you can do anything you like.&#8217; How&#8217;s  that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t see any sense in it at all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No?  I told you you lacked common sense. Most women do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221;  and Genevieve tossed her pretty head, patted her curly ear-muffs, and proceeded  with her work.</p>
  <p>Samuel  Appleby&#8217;s beautiful home graced the town of Stockfield, in the western end of  the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Former Governor Appleby was still a  political power and a man of unquestioned force and importance.</p>
  <p>It  was fifteen years or more since he had held office, and now, a great desire  possessed him that his son should follow in his ways, and that his beloved  state should know another governor of the Appleby name.</p>
  <p>And  young Sam was worthy of the people&#8217;s choice. Himself a man of forty, motherless  from childhood, and brought up sensibly and well by his father, he listened  gravely to the paternal plans for the campaign.</p>
  <p>But  there were other candidates, and not without some strong and definite influences  could the end be attained.</p>
  <p>Wherefore,  Mr. Appleby was quite as much interested as his secretary in the letter which  was in the morning&#8217;s mail.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Any  word from Sycamore Ridge?&#8221; he asked, as he came into the big, cheerful office  and nodded a kindly good-morning to his two assistants.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  and a good word,&#8221; returned Keefe, smiling. &#8220;It says: &#8216;Come.&#8217;&#8221; The secretary&#8217;s  attitude toward his employer, though deferential and respectful, was marked by  a touch of good-fellowship&#8212;a not unnatural outgrowth of a long term of  confidential relations between them. Keefe had made himself invaluable to  Samuel Appleby and both men knew it. So, as one had no desire to presume on the  fact and the other no wish to ignore it, serenity reigned in the well-ordered  and well-appointed offices of the ex-governor.</p>
  <p>Even  the light-haired, light-hearted and light-headed Genevieve couldn&#8217;t disturb the  even tenor of the routine. If she could have, she would have been fired.</p>
  <p>Though  not a handsome man, not even to be called distinguished looking, Samuel Appleby  gave an impression of power. His strong, lean face betokened obdurate  determination and implacable will.</p>
  <p>Its  deep-graven lines were the result of meeting many obstacles and surmounting  most of them. And at sixty-two, the hale and hearty frame and the alert,  efficient manner made the man seem years younger.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  know the conditions on which Wheeler lives in that house?&#8221; Appleby asked, as he  looked over the top of the letter at Keefe.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  it&#8217;s this way. But, no&#8212;I&#8217;ll not give you the story now. We&#8217;re going down  there&#8212;to-day.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  whole tribe?&#8221; asked Keefe, briefly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  all three of us. Be ready, Miss Lane, please, at three-thirty.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir,&#8221; said Genevieve, reaching for her vanity-box.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  now, Keefe, as to young Sam,&#8221; Appleby went on, running his fingers through his  thick, iron-gray mane. &#8220;If he can put it over, or if I can put it over for him,  it will be only with the help of Dan Wheeler.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  Wheeler willing to help?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Probably  not. He must be made willing. I can do it&#8212;I think&#8212;unless he turns stubborn. I  know Wheeler&#8212;if he turns stubborn&#8212;well, Balaam&#8217;s historic quadruped had nothing  on him!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Does  Mr. Wheeler know Sam?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  and it wouldn&#8217;t matter either way if he did. It&#8217;s the platform Wheeler stands  on. If I can keep him in ignorance of that one plank&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know it&#8212;confound it! He opposed my election on that one point&#8212;he&#8217;ll oppose Sam&#8217;s  for the same reason, I know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  do I come in?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  a general way, I want your help. Wheeler&#8217;s wife and daughter are attractive,  and you might manage to interest them and maybe sway their sympathies toward  Sam&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  they&#8217;ll stand by Mr. Wheeler?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Probably&#8212;yes.  However, use your head, and do all you can with it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  where do I come in?&#8221; asked Genevieve, who had been an interested listener.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  don&#8217;t come in at all, Miss. You mostly stay out. You&#8217;re to keep in the  background. I have to take you, for we&#8217;re only staying one night at Sycamore  Ridge, and then going on to Boston, and I&#8217;ll need you there.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir,&#8221; and the blue eyes turned from him and looked absorbedly into a tiny  mirror, as Genevieve contemplated her pleasant pink-and-whiteness.</p>
  <p>Her  vanity and its accompanying box were matters of indifference to Mr. Appleby and  to Keefe, for the girl&#8217;s efficiency and skill outweighed them and her diligence  and loyalty scored one hundred per cent.</p>
  <p>Appleby&#8217;s  fetish was efficiency. He had found it and recognized it in his secretary and  stenographer and he was willing to recompense it duly, even generously.  Wherefore the law business of Samuel Appleby, though carried on for the benefit  of a small number of clients, was of vast importance and productive of  lucrative returns.</p>
  <p>At  present, the importance was overshadowed by the immediate interest of a  campaign, which, if successful would land the second Appleby in the gubernatorial  chair. This plan, as yet not a boom, was taking shape with the neatness and  dispatch that characterized the Appleby work.</p>
  <p>Young  Sam was content to have the matter principally in his father&#8217;s hands, and  things had reached a pitch where, to the senior mind, the coperation of Daniel  Wheeler was imperatively necessary.</p>
  <p>And,  therefore, to Wheeler&#8217;s house they must betake themselves.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  do you know about the Wheeler business, kid?&#8221; Keefe inquired, after Mr. Appleby  had left them.</p>
  <p>Genevieve  leaned back in her chair, her dimpled chin moving up and down with a pretty  rhythm as she enjoyed her chewing-gum, and gazed at the ceiling beams.</p>
  <p>Appleby&#8217;s  offices were in his own house, and the one given over to these two was an  attractive room, fine with mahogany and plate glass, but also provided with all  the paraphernalia of the most up-to-date of office furniture. There were good  pictures and draperies, and a wood fire added to the cheer and mitigated the  chill of the early fall weather.</p>
  <p>Sidling  from her seat, Miss Lane moved over to a chair near the fire.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  take those letters when you&#8217;re ready,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know a single  thing about any Wheeler. Do you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  definitely. He&#8217;s a man who had an awful fight with Mr. Appleby, long ago. I&#8217;ve  heard allusions to him now and then, but I know no details.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I,  either. But, it seems we&#8217;re to go there. Only for a night, and then, on to  Boston! Won&#8217;t I be glad to go!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll  only be there a few days. I&#8217;m more interested in this Wheeler performance. I  don&#8217;t understand it. Who&#8217;s Wheeler, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Dunno.  If Sammy turns up this morning, he may enlighten us.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Sammy  did turn up, and not long after the conversation young Appleby strolled into  the office.</p>
  <p>Though  still looked upon as a boy by his father, the man was of huge proportions and  of an important, slightly overbearing attitude.</p>
  <p>Somewhat  like his parent in appearance, young Sam, as he was always called, had more  grace and ease, if less effect of power. He smiled genially and impartially; he  seemed cordial and friendly to all the world, and he was a general favorite.  Yet so far he had achieved no great thing, had no claim to any especial record  in public or private life.</p>
  <p>At  forty, unmarried and unattached, his was a case of an able mentality and a  firm, reliable character, with no opportunity offered to prove its worth. A  little more initiative and he would have made opportunities for himself; but a  nature that took the line of least resistance, a philosophy that believed in a  calm acceptance of things as they came, left Samuel Appleby, junior, pretty  much where he was when he began. If no man could say aught against him, equally  surely no man could say anything very definite for him. Yet many agreed that he  was a man whose powers would develop with acquired responsibilities, and  already he had a following.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hello,  little one,&#8221; he greeted Genevieve, carelessly, as he sat down near Keefe. &#8220;I  say, old chap, you&#8217;re going down to the Wheelers&#8217; to-day, I hear.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  this afternoon,&#8221; and the secretary looked up inquiringly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  I&#8217;ll tell you what. You know the governor&#8217;s going there to get Wheeler&#8217;s aid in  my election boom, and I can tell you a way to help things along, if you agree.  See?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  yet, but go ahead.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  it&#8217;s this way. Dan Wheeler&#8217;s daughter is devoted to her father. Not only filial  respect and all that, but she just fairly idolizes the old man. Now, he recips,  of course, and what she says goes. So&#8212;I&#8217;m asking you squarely&#8212;won&#8217;t you put in  a good word to Maida, that&#8217;s the girl&#8212;and if you do it with your inimitable  dexterity and grace, she&#8217;ll fall for it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  mean for me to praise you up to Miss Wheeler and ask her father to give you the  benefit of his influence?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  clearly you do put things! That&#8217;s exactly what I mean. It&#8217;s no harm, you  know&#8212;merely the most innocent sort of electioneering&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rather!&#8221;  laughed Keefe. &#8220;If all electioneering were as innocent as that, the word would  carry no unpleasant meaning.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  you&#8217;ll do it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course I will&#8212;if I get opportunity.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  you&#8217;ll have that. It&#8217;s a big, rambling country house&#8212;a delightful one, too&#8212;and  there&#8217;s tea in the hall, and tennis on the lawn, and moonlight on the verandas&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hold  up, Sam,&#8221; Keefe warned him, &#8220;is the girl pretty?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t  seen her for years, but probably, yes. But that&#8217;s nothing to you. You&#8217;re  working for me, you see.&#8221; Appleby&#8217;s glance was direct, and Keefe understood.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course; I was only joking. I&#8217;ll carry out your commission, if, as I said, I get  the chance. Tell me something of Mr. Wheeler.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  he&#8217;s a good old chap. Pathetic, rather. You see, he bumped up against dad once,  and got the worst of it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Sam  Appleby hesitated a moment and then said: &#8220;I see you don&#8217;t know the story. But  it&#8217;s no secret, and you may as well be told. You listen, too, Miss Lane, but  there&#8217;s no call to tattle.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  go home if you say so,&#8221; Genevieve piped up, a little crisply.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sit still. Why, it was while dad was governor&#8212;about fifteen years ago, I  suppose. And Daniel Wheeler forged a paper&#8212;that is, he said he didn&#8217;t, but  twelve other good and true peers of his said he did. Anyway, he was convicted  and sentenced, but father was a good friend of his, and being governor, he  pardoned Wheeler. But the pardon was on condition&#8212;oh, I say&#8212;hasn&#8217;t dad ever  told you, Keefe?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,  maybe I&#8217;d better leave it for him to tell. If he wants you to know he&#8217;ll tell  you, and if not, I mustn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  goodness!&#8221; cried Genevieve. &#8220;What a way to do! Get us all excited over a  thrilling tale, and then chop it off short!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go  on with it,&#8221; said Keefe; but Appleby said, &#8220;No; I won&#8217;t tell you the condition  of the pardon. But the two men haven&#8217;t been friends since, and won&#8217;t be, unless  the condition is removed. Of course, dad can&#8217;t do it, but the present governor  can make the pardon complete, and would do so in a minute, if dad asked him to.  So, though he hasn&#8217;t said so, the assumption is, that father expects to trade a  full pardon of Friend Wheeler for his help in my campaign.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  a good plan,&#8221; Keefe nodded his satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,&#8221;  Sam went on, &#8220;the trouble is that the very same points and principles that made  Wheeler oppose my father&#8217;s election will make him oppose mine. The party is the  same, the platform is the same, and I can&#8217;t hope that the man Wheeler is not the  same stubborn, adamant, unbreakable old hickory knot he was the other time.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  so, you want me to soften him by persuading his daughter to line up on our  side?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  that, Keefe. And you can do it, I am sure.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  try, of course; but I doubt if even a favorite daughter could influence the man  you describe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let  me help,&#8221; broke in the irrepressible Genevieve. &#8220;I can do lots with a girl. I  can do more than Curt could. I&#8217;ll chum up with her and&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  Miss Lane, you keep out of this. I don&#8217;t believe in mixing women and politics.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  Miss Wheeler&#8217;s a woman.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  I don&#8217;t want her troubled with politics. Keefe here can persuade her to coax  her father just through her affections&#8212;I don&#8217;t want her enlightened as to any  of the political details. And I can&#8217;t think your influence would work half as  well as that of a man. Moreover, Keefe has discernment, and if it isn&#8217;t a good  plan, after all, he&#8217;ll know enough to discard it&#8212;while you&#8217;d blunder ahead  blindly, and queer the whole game!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  well,&#8221; and bridling with offended pride, Genevieve sought refuge in her little  mirror.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  don&#8217;t get huffy,&#8221; and Sam smiled at her; &#8220;you&#8217;ll probably find that Miss  Wheeler&#8217;s complexion is finer than yours, anyway, and then you&#8217;ll hate her and  won&#8217;t want to speak to her at all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Miss  Lane flashed an indignant glance and then proceeded to go on with her work.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t  Wheeler tried for a pardon all this time?&#8221; Keefe asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Indeed  he has,&#8221; Sam returned, &#8220;many times. But you see, though successive governors  were willing to grant it, father always managed to prevent it. Dad can pull  lots of wires, as you know, and since he doesn&#8217;t want Wheeler fully pardoned,  why, he doesn&#8217;t get fully pardoned.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  he lives under the stigma.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Lots  of people don&#8217;t know about the thing at all. He lives&#8212;well&#8212;he lives in  Connecticut&#8212;and&#8212;oh, of course, there is a certain stigma.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  your father will bring about his full pardon if he promises&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let  up, Keefe; I&#8217;ve said I can&#8217;t tell you that part&#8212;you&#8217;ll get your instructions in  good time. And, look here, I don&#8217;t mean for you to make love to the girl. In  fact, I&#8217;m told she has a suitor. But you&#8217;re just to give her a little song and  dance about my suitability for the election, and then adroitly persuade her to  use her powers of persuasion with her stubborn father. For he will be  stubborn&#8212;I know it! And there&#8217;s the mother of the girl . . . tackle Mrs.  Wheeler. Make her see that my father was justified in the course he took&#8212;and  besides, he was more or less accountable to others&#8212;and use as an argument that  years have dulled the old feud and that bygones ought to be bygones and all  that.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Try  to make her see that a full pardon now will be as much, and in a way more, to  Wheeler&#8217;s credit, than if it had been given him at first&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t see that,&#8221; and Keefe looked quizzical</p>
  <p>&#8220;Neither  can I,&#8221; Sam confessed, frankly, &#8220;but you can make a woman swallow anything.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Depends  on what sort of woman Mrs. Wheeler is,&#8221; Keefe mused.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know it. I haven&#8217;t seen her for years, and as I remember, she&#8217;s pretty keen,  but I&#8217;m banking on you to put over some of your clever work. Not three men in  Boston have your ingenuity, Keefe, when it comes to sizing up a situation and  knowing just how to handle it. Now, don&#8217;t tell father all I&#8217;ve said, for he  doesn&#8217;t especially hold with such small measures. He&#8217;s all for the one big slam  game, and he may be right. But I&#8217;m right, too, and you just go ahead.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right,&#8221; Keefe agreed. &#8220;I see what you mean, and I&#8217;ll do all I can that doesn&#8217;t  in any way interfere with your father&#8217;s directions to me. There&#8217;s a possibility  of turning the trick through the women folks, and if I can do it, you may count  on me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good!  And as for you, Miss Lane, you keep in the background, and make as little  mischief as you can.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  not a mischief-maker,&#8221; said the girl, pouting playfully, for she was not at all  afraid of Sam Appleby.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Your  blue eyes and pink cheeks make mischief wherever you go,&#8221; he returned; &#8220;but don&#8217;t  try them on old Dan Wheeler. He&#8217;s a morose old chap&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  should think he would be!&#8221; defended Genevieve; &#8220;living all these years under a  ban which may, after all, be undeserved! I&#8217;ve heard that he was entirely  innocent of the forgery!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Have  you, indeed?&#8221; Appleby&#8217;s tone was unpleasantly sarcastic. &#8220;Other people have  also heard that&#8212;from the Wheeler family! Those better informed believe the man  guilty, and believe, too, that my father was too lenient when he granted even a  conditional pardon.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  just think&#8212;if he was innocent&#8212;how awful his life has been all these years! You  bet he&#8217;ll accept the full pardon and give all his effort and influence and any  possible help in return.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hear  the child orate!&#8221; exclaimed Sam, gazing at the enthusiastic little face, as  Genevieve voiced her views.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  think he&#8217;ll be ready to make the bargain, too,&#8221; declared Keefe. &#8220;Your father  has a strong argument. I fancy Wheeler&#8217;s jump at the chance.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maybe&#8212;maybe  so. But you don&#8217;t know how opposed he is to our principles. And he&#8217;s a man of  immovable convictions. In fact, he and dad are two mighty strong forces. One or  the other must win out&#8212;but I&#8217;ve no idea which it will be.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  exciting!&#8221; Genevieve&#8217;s eyes danced. &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad I&#8217;m to go. It&#8217;s a pretty  place, you say?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wonderful.  A great sweep of rolling country, a big, long, rambling sort of house, and a  splendid hospitality. You&#8217;ll enjoy the experience, but remember, I told you to  be good.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  will remember,&#8221; and Genevieve pretended to took cherubic.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore2"></a>Chapter 2 <br>
North Door And South Door</b></h2>
  <p>For  Samuel Appleby to pay a visit to Daniel Wheeler was of itself an astounding  occurrence. The two men had not seen each other since the day, fifteen years  ago, when Governor Appleby had pardoned the convicted Wheeler, with a  condition, which, though harsh, had been strictly adhered to.</p>
  <p>They  had never been friends at heart, for they were diametrically opposed in their  political views, and were not of similar tastes or pursuits. But they had been  thrown much together, and when the time came for Wheeler to be tried for  forgery, Appleby lent no assistance to the case. However, through certain  influences brought to bear, in connection with the fact that Mrs. Wheeler was  related to the Applebys, the governor pardoned the condemned man, with a  conditional pardon.</p>
  <p>Separated  ever since, a few letters had passed between the two men, but they resulted in  no change of conditions.</p>
  <p>As  the big car ran southward through the Berkshire Hills, Appleby&#8217;s thoughts were  all on the coming meeting, and the scenery of autumn foliage that provoked wild  exclamations of delight from Genevieve and assenting enthusiasm from Keefe left  the other unmoved.</p>
  <p>An  appreciative nod and grunt were all he vouchsafed to the girl&#8217;s gushing  praises, and when at last they neared their destination he called her attention  to a tall old sycamore tree standing alone on a ridge not far away.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  the tree that gives the Wheeler place its name,&#8221; he informed. &#8220;Sycamore Ridge  is one of the most beautiful places in Connecticut.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  are we in Connecticut?&#8221; asked Miss Lane. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know we had crossed the  border. What a great old tree! Surely one of the historic trees of New England,  isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Historic  to the Wheelers,&#8221; was the grim reply, and then Mr. Appleby again relapsed into  silence and spoke no further word until they reached the Wheeler home.</p>
  <p>A  finely curved sweep of driveway brought them to the house, and the car stopped  at the south entrance.</p>
  <p>The  door did not swing open in welcome, and Mr. Appleby ordered his chauffeur to  ring the bell.</p>
  <p>This  brought a servant in response, and the visiting trio entered the house.</p>
  <p>It  was long and low, with many rooms on either side of the wide hall that went  straight through from south to north. The first room to the right was a large  living-room, and into this the guests were shown and were met by a  grave-looking man, who neither smiled nor offered a hand as his calm gaze  rested on Samuel Appleby.</p>
  <p>Indeed,  the two men stared at one another, in undisguised curiosity. Each seemed to  search the other&#8217;s face for information as to his attitude and intent.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  Dan,&#8221; Appleby said, after the silent scrutiny, &#8220;you&#8217;ve changed some, but you&#8217;re  the same good-looking chap you always were.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Wheeler  gave a start and pulled himself together.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thank  you. I suppose I should return the compliment.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you can&#8217;t conscientiously do it, eh?&#8221; Appleby laughed. &#8220;Never mind. Personal  vanity is not my besetting sin. This is my secretary, Mr. Keefe, and my  assistant, Miss Lane.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah,  yes, yes. How are you? How do you do? My wife and daughter will look after the  young lady. Maida!&#8221;</p>
  <p>As  if awaiting the call, a girl came quickly in from the hall followed by an older  woman. Introductions followed, and if there was an air of constraint on the  part of the host the ladies of the family showed none. Sunny-faced Maida  Wheeler, with her laughing brown eyes and gold brown hair, greeted the visitors  with charming cordiality, and her mother was equally kind and courteous.</p>
  <p>Genevieve  Lane&#8217;s wise and appraising eyes missed no point of appearance or behavior.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perfect  darlings, both of them!&#8221; she commented to herself. &#8220;Whatever ails the old guy,  it hasn&#8217;t bitten them. Or else&#8212;wait a minute&#8212;&#8221; Genevieve was very observant&#8212;&#8221;perhaps  they&#8217;re putting on a little. Is their welcome a bit extra, to help things  along?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Yet  only a most meticulous critic could discern anything more than true hospitality  in the attitude of Mrs. Wheeler or Maida. The latter took Genevieve to the room  prepared for her and chatted away in girlish fashion.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  place is so wonderful!&#8221; Genevieve exclaimed, carefully avoiding personal talk. &#8220;Don&#8217;t  you just adore it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes. I&#8217;ve loved Sycamore Ridge for nearly fifteen years.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Have  you lived here so long?&#8221; Genevieve was alert for information. It was fifteen  years ago that the pardon had been granted.</p>
  <p>But  as Maida merely assented and then changed the subject, Miss Lane was far too  canny to ask further questions.</p>
  <p>With  a promptness not entirely due to chance, the stenographer came downstairs  dressed for dinner some several minutes before the appointed hour. Assuming her  right as a guest, she wandered about the rooms.</p>
  <p>The  south door, by which they had entered, was evidently the main entrance, but the  opposite, or north door, gave on to an even more beautiful view, and she  stepped out on the wide veranda and gazed admiringly about. The low ridge  nearby formed the western horizon, and the giant sycamore, its straight  branches outlined against the fading sunset, was impressive and a little weird.  She strolled on, and turned the corner the better to see the ridge. The veranda  ran all round the house, and as she went on along the western side, she suddenly  became aware of a silent figure leaning against a pillar at the southwest corner.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is so quiet it frightens me,&#8221; she said to Daniel Wheeler, as she neared him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  you feel that way, too?&#8221; he asked, looking at her a little absently. &#8220;It is the  lull before the storm.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  that sunset doesn&#8217;t mean rain,&#8221; Genevieve exclaimed, smiling, &#8220;unless your  Connecticut blue laws interpret weather signs differently from our  Massachusetts prophets. We <i>are</i> in  Connecticut, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  and Wheeler sighed unaccountably. &#8220;Yes, Miss Lane, we are. That sycamore is the  finest tree in the state.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can well believe it. I never saw such a grandfather of a tree! It&#8217;s all full of  little balls.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  buttonballs, they are called. But note its wonderful symmetry, its majestic  appearance&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  strength! It looks as if it would stand, there forever!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  you think so?&#8221; and the unmistakable note of disappointment in the man&#8217;s tone  caused Genevieve to look up in astonishment. &#8220;Well, perhaps it will,&#8221; he added  quickly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no, of course it won&#8217;t really! No tree stands forever. But it will be here long  after you and I are gone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Are  you an authority on trees?&#8221; Wheeler spoke without a smile.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hardly  that; but I was brought up in the country, and I know something of them. Your  daughter loves the country, too.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes&#8212;we all do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  tone was courteous, but the whole air of the man was so melancholy, his  cheerfulness so palpably assumed, that Genevieve felt sorry for him, as well as  inordinately curious to know what was the matter.</p>
  <p>But  her sympathy was the stronger impulse, and with a desire to entertain him, she  said, &#8220;Come for a few steps in the garden, Mr. Wheeler, won&#8217;t you? Come and  show me that quaint little summer-house near the front door. It is the front  door, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s hard to tell.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  the north door <i>is</i> the front door,&#8221;  Wheeler said slowly, as if repeating a lesson. &#8220;The summer-house you mention is  near the front door. But we won&#8217;t visit that now. Come this other way, and I&#8217;ll  show you a Japanese tea-house, much more attractive.&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  Genevieve Lane was sometimes under the spell of the Imp of the Perverse.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  no,&#8221; she begged, smilingly, &#8220;let the Japanese contraption wait; please go to  the little summer-house now. See, how it fairly twinkles in the last gleams of  the setting sun! What is the flower that rambles all over it? Oh, do let&#8217;s go  there now! Come, please!&#8221;</p>
  <p>With  no reason for her foolish insistence save a whim, Genevieve was amazed to see  the look of fury that came over her host&#8217;s face.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Appleby  put you up to that!&#8221; he cried, in a voice of intense anger. &#8220;He told you to ask  me to go to that place!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  Mr. Wheeler,&#8221; cried the girl, almost frightened, &#8220;Mr. Appleby did nothing of  the sort! Why should he! I&#8217;m not asking anything wrong, am I? Why is it so dreadful  to want to see an arbor instead of a tea-house? You must be crazy!&#8221;</p>
  <p>When  Miss Lane was excited, she was quite apt to lose her head, and speak in  thoughtless fashion.</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Wheeler didn&#8217;t seem to notice her informality of speech. He only stared at  her as if he couldn&#8217;t quite make her out, and then he suddenly seemed to lose  interest in her or her wishes, and with a deep sigh, he turned away, and fell  into the same brooding posture as when she had first approached him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come  to dinner, people,&#8221; called Maida&#8217;s pretty voice, as, with outstretched hands  she came toward them. &#8220;Why, dads, what are you looking miserable about? What  have you done to him, Miss Lane?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maida,  child, don&#8217;t speak like that! Miss Lane has been most kindly talking to me,  of&#8212;of the beauties of Sycamore Ridge.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, then, and forgive me, Miss Lane. But you see, the sun rises and sets for  me in one Daniel Wheeler, Esquire, and any shadow on his face makes me  apprehensive of its cause.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Only  for an instant did Genevieve Lane&#8217;s sense of justice rise in revolt, then her  common sense showed her the better way, and she smiled pleasantly and returned:</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t blame you, Miss Wheeler. If I had a father, I should feel just the same  way, I know. But don&#8217;t do any gory-lock-shaking my way. I assure you I didn&#8217;t  really scold him. I only kicked because he wouldn&#8217;t humor my whim for visiting  the summer-house with the blossoms trailing over it! Was that naughty of me?&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  though Genevieve listened for the answer, none came.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come  on in to dinner, daddy, dear,&#8221; Maida repeated. &#8220;Come, Miss Lane, they&#8217;re  waiting for us.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Dinner  was a delightful occasion.</p>
  <p>Daniel  Wheeler, at the head of his own table, was a charming host, and his melancholy  entirely disappeared as the talk ran along on subjects grave or gay, but of no  personal import.</p>
  <p>Appleby,  too, was entertaining, and the two men, with Mrs. Wheeler, carried on most of  the conversation, the younger members of the party being by what seemed common  consent left out of it.</p>
  <p>Genevieve  looked about the dining-room, with a pleased interest. She dearly loved  beautiful appointments and was really imagining herself mistress of just such a  house, and visioning herself at the head of such a table. The long room  stretched from north to south, parallel with the hall, though not adjoining.  The table was not in the centre, but toward the southern end, and Mr. Wheeler,  at the end near the windows, had Keefe and Miss Lane on either side of him.</p>
  <p>Appleby,  as guest of honor, sat at Mrs. Wheeler&#8217;s right, and the whole effect was that  of a formal dinner party, rather than a group of which two were merely office  employs.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is one of the few remaining warm evenings,&#8221; said Mrs. Wheeler, as she rose from  the table, &#8220;we will have our coffee on the veranda. Soon it will be too cool  for that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Which  veranda?&#8221; asked Genevieve of Maida, as they went through the hall. &#8220;The north  one, I hope.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Your  hopes must be dashed,&#8221; laughed the other, &#8220;for it will be the south one. Come  along.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  two girls, followed by Keefe, took possession of a group of chairs near Mrs.  Wheeler, while the two older men sat apart, and soon became engrossed in their  own discussions.</p>
  <p>Nor  was it long before Samuel Appleby and his host withdrew to a room which opened  on to that same south veranda, and which was, in fact, Mr. Wheeler&#8217;s den.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  Sam,&#8221; Keefe heard the other say, as he drew down the blind, &#8220;we may as well  have it out now. What are you here for?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Outwardly  placid, but almost consumed with curiosity, Curt Keefe changed his seat for one  nearer the window of the den. He hoped to hear the discussion going on inside,  but was doomed to disappointment, for though the murmuring of the voices was  audible, the words were not distinct, and Keefe gathered only enough  information to be sure that there was a heated argument in progress and that  neither party to it was inclined to give in a single point.</p>
  <p>Of  course, he decided, the subject was the coming election campaign, but the  details of desired bargaining he could not gather.</p>
  <p>Moreover,  often, just as he almost heard sentences of interest, the chatter of the girls  or some remark of Mrs. Wheeler&#8217;s would drown the voices of the men in the room.</p>
  <p>One  time, indeed, he heard clearly: &#8220;When the Sycamore on the ridge goes into  Massachusetts&#8212;&#8221; but this was sheer nonsense, and he concluded he must have  misunderstood.</p>
  <p>Later,  they all forgathered in the living-room and there was music and general  conversation.</p>
  <p>Genevieve  Lane proved herself decidedly entertaining, and though Samuel Appleby looked a  little amusedly at his stenographer, he smiled kindly at her as he noticed that  she in no way overstepped the bounds of correct demeanor.</p>
  <p>Genevieve  was thinking of what Keefe had said to her: &#8220;If you do only what is absolutely  correct and say what is only absolutely correct, you can do whatever you like.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She  had called it nonsense at the time, but she was beginning to see the truth of  it. She was careful that her every word and act should be correct, and she was  most decidedly doing as she liked. She made good with Mrs. Wheeler and Maida  with no trouble at all; but she felt, vaguely, that Mr. Wheeler didn&#8217;t like  her. This she set about to remedy.</p>
  <p>Going  to his side, as he chanced to sit for a moment alone, she smiled ingratiatingly  and said:</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  wonder if you can imagine, sir, what it means to me to see the inside of a  house like this?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Bless  my soul, what do you mean?&#8221; asked Wheeler, puzzled at the girl&#8217;s manner.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  like a glimpse of Fairyland,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;You see, I&#8217;m terribly ambitious&#8212;oh,  fearfully so! And all my ambitions lead to just this sort of a home. Do you  suppose I&#8217;ll ever achieve it, Mr. Wheeler?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Now  the girl had truly wonderful magnetic charm, and even staid old Dan Wheeler was  not insensible to the note of longing in her voice, the simple, honest  admission of her hopes.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course you will, little one,&#8221; he returned, kindly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that whatever  one wants, one gets, provided the wish is strong enough.&#8221; He spoke directly to  her, but his gaze wandered as if his thoughts were far away.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  you really believe that?&#8221; Genevieve&#8217;s big blue eyes begged an affirmation.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  didn&#8217;t say I believed it&#8212;I said I have heard it.&#8221; He smiled sadly. &#8220;Not quite  the same&#8212;so far as I&#8217;m concerned; but quite as assuring to you. Of course, my  belief wouldn&#8217;t endorse the possibility.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  would for me,&#8221; declared Genevieve. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lots of confidence in other people&#8217;s  opinions&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Anybody&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Anybody  whom I respect and believe in.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Appleby,  for instance?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, indeed! I&#8217;d trust Mr. Appleby&#8217;s opinions on any subject. Let&#8217;s go over  there and tell him so.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Samuel  Appleby was sitting at the other end, the north end of the long room. &#8220;No,&#8221;  said Wheeler, &#8220;I&#8217;m too comfortable here to move&#8212;ask him to come here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Genevieve  looked at him a little astonished. It was out of order, she thought, for a host  to speak thus. She pressed the point, saying there was a picture at the other  end of the room she wished to examine.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Run  along, then,&#8221; said Wheeler, coolly. &#8220;Here, Maida, show Miss Lane that etching  and tell her the interesting details about it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  girls went away, and soon after Keefe drifted round to Wheeler&#8217;s side.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  know young Sam Appleby?&#8221; he asked, casually.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221;  Wheeler said, shortly but not sharply. &#8220;I daresay he&#8217;s a most estimable chap.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s  all of that. He&#8217;s a true chip of the old block. Both good gubernatorial timber,  as I&#8217;m sure you agree.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  makes you so sure, Mr. Keefe?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Curt  Keefe looked straight at him. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;I&#8217;m quite ready to admit  that the wish was father to the thought.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  do you call that an admission?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221;  Keefe readily returned, &#8220;it is usually looked upon as a confession that one has  no reason for a thought other than a wish.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  why is it your wish?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because  it is the wish of my employer,&#8221; said Keefe, seriously. &#8220;I know of no reason,  Mr. Wheeler, why I shouldn&#8217;t say that I hope and trust you will use your  influence to further the cause of young Appleby.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  makes you think I can do so?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;While  I am not entirely in Mr. Appleby&#8217;s confidence, he has told me that the campaign  would be greatly aided by your willingness to help, and so I can&#8217;t help hoping  you will exercise it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Appleby  has told you so much, has he? No more?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  more, I think, regarding yourself, sir. I know, naturally, the details of the  campaign so far as it is yet mapped out.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you know why I do not want to lend my aid?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know you are not in accordance with the principles of the Appleby politics&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  I am not! Nor shall I ever be. Nor shall I ever pretend to be&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Pretend?  Of course not. But could you not be persuaded?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;By  what means?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know, Mr. Wheeler,&#8221; and Keefe looked at him frankly. &#8220;I truly don&#8217;t know  by what means. But I do know that Mr. Appleby is here to present to you an  argument by which he hopes to persuade you to help young Sam along&#8212;and I  earnestly desire to add any word of mine that may help influence your decision.  That is why I want to tell you of the good traits of Sam Appleby, junior. It  may be I can give you a clearer light on his character than his father could do&#8212;that  is, I might present it as the opinion of a friend&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  not exaggerate his virtues as a father might do? I see. Well, Mr. Keefe, I  appreciate your attitude, but let me tell you this: whatever I do or don&#8217;t do  regarding this coming campaign of young Appleby will be entirely irrespective  of the character or personality of that young man. It will all depend on the  senior Appleby&#8217;s arrangements with me, and my ability to change his views on  some of the more important planks in his platform. If he directed you to speak  to me as you have done, you may return that to him as my answer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You,  doubtless, said the same to him, sir?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course I did. I make no secret of my position in this matter. Samuel Appleby  has a hold over me&#8212;I admit that&#8212;but it is not strong enough to make me forget my  ideas of right and wrong to the public. No influence of a personal nature  should weigh against any man&#8217;s duty to the state, and I will never agree to  pretend to any dissimulation in order to bring about a happier life for myself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  need you subscribe to the objectionable points to use your influence for young  Sam?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tacitly,  of course. And I do not choose even to appear to agree to principles abhorrent  to my sense of justice and honesty, thereby secretly gaining something for  myself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Meaning  your full pardon?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Wheeler  turned a look of surprise on the speaker.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  thought you said you hadn&#8217;t Appleby&#8217;s full confidence,&#8221; he said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nor  have I. I do know&#8212;as do many men&#8212;that you were pardoned with a condition, but  the condition I do not know. It can&#8217;t be very galling.&#8221; And Keefe looked about  on the pleasant surroundings.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  think not? That&#8217;s because you don&#8217;t know the terms. And yet, galling though  they are, hateful though it makes my life, and the lives of my wife and  daughter, we would all rather bear it than to deviate one iota from the path of  strict right.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  must admire you for that, as must any honorable man. But are there not degrees  or shadings of right and wrong&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Keefe, as an old man, I take the privilege of advising you for your own good.  All through your life I beg you remember this: Anyone who admits degrees or  shadings of right or wrong&#8212;is already wrong. Don&#8217;t be offended; you didn&#8217;t  claim those things, you merely asked the question. But, remember what I said  about it.&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore3"></a>Chapter 3 <br>
One Last Argument</b></h2>
  <p>Adjoining  the bedroom of Samuel Appleby at Sycamore Ridge was a small sitting-room, also  at his disposal. Here, later that same evening he sat in confab with his two  assistants.</p>
  <p>&#8220;We  leave to-morrow afternoon,&#8221; he said to Keefe and Miss Lane. &#8220;But before that,  we&#8217;ve much to do. So far, we&#8217;ve accomplished nothing. I am a little discouraged  but not disheartened. I still have a trump card to play, but I don&#8217;t want to  use it unless absolutely necessary.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  you were inclined to take us further into your confidence, Mr. Appleby,&#8221; Keefe  began, and the older man interrupted:</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  just what I propose to do. The time has come for it. Perhaps if you both know  the situation you may work more intelligently.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sure  we could!&#8221; exclaimed Genevieve. She was leaning forward in her chair, clasping  her knees, her pretty evening frock disclosing her babyishly soft neck and  arms; but without a trace of self-consciousness, she thought only of the  subject they were discussing.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s  something queer,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see through it. Why does Mr. Wheeler  act so polite most of the time, and then do some outrageous thing, like&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Like  what?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Like  refusing to cross the room&#8212;or&#8212;why, he declined point-blank to go with me to the  north arbor, yet was perfectly willing to take me to the Japanese tea-house!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  just the point of the whole thing,&#8221; said Appleby, seriously; &#8220;here&#8217;s the  explanation in a nutshell. Years ago, Daniel Wheeler was pardoned for a crime  he had committed&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  did commit it, then?&#8221; interrupted Keefe.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  was tried and convicted. He was sentenced. And I, being governor at the time,  pardoned him on the one condition, that he never again set foot inside the  boundaries of the State of Massachusetts.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Whee!&#8221;  exclaimed Genevieve; &#8220;never go to Boston!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nor  anywhere else in the state. But this is the complication: Mrs. Wheeler, who is,  by the way, a distant connection of my own family, inherited a large fortune on  condition that she live in Massachusetts. So you see, the situation was  peculiar. To keep her inheritance, Mrs. Wheeler must live in Massachusetts. Yet  Mr. Wheeler could not enter the state without forfeiting his pardon.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  a mess!&#8221; cried Genevieve, but Keefe said: &#8220;You planned that purposely, Mr.  Appleby?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course,&#8221; was the straightforward reply.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  I don&#8217;t see how you can expect Mr. Wheeler&#8217;s help in the campaign.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;By  offering him a complete pardon, of course.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  go on with the story,&#8221; demanded Genevieve. &#8220;What did they do about the  Massachusetts business?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  you see,&#8221; returned Appleby, &#8220;this house is built on the state line between  Massachusetts and Connecticut. It is carefully planned and built, and all the  rooms or parts of rooms that Mr. Wheeler uses or enters are on the Connecticut  side, yet the house is more than half in Massachusetts, which secures the  estate to Mrs. Wheeler.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  I never!&#8221; Genevieve exclaimed. &#8220;So that&#8217;s why he can&#8217;t go to the north arbor&#8212;it&#8217;s  in Massachusetts!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course it is. Also, he never goes into the northern end of the dining-room or  the living-room.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Or  hall.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Or  hall. In fact, he merely is careful to keep on his own side of a definitely  drawn line, and therefore complies with the restrictions. His den and his own  bedroom and bath are all on the south side, while Mrs. Wheeler has a sitting-room,  boudoir, and so forth, on the north side. She and Maida can go all over the  house, but Mr. Wheeler is restricted. However, they&#8217;ve lived that way so long,  it has become second nature to them, and nobody bothers much about it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  people know?&#8221; asked Keefe. &#8220;The neighbors, I mean.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes; but, as I say, it makes little confusion. The trouble comes, as Miss Lane  suggested, when Wheeler wants to go to Boston or anywhere in Massachusetts.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yet  that is a small thing, compared with his freedom,&#8221; observed Keefe; &#8220;I think he  got off easy.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  with Wheeler it isn&#8217;t so much the deprivation as the stigma. He longs for a  full pardon, and would do most anything to have it, but he refuses to stand for  Sam&#8217;s election, even with that for a bribe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  can&#8217;t pardon him now that you aren&#8217;t governor, can you, Mr. Appleby?&#8221; asked  Genevieve.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can arrange to have it done. In fact, the present governor is ready and even  anxious to pardon him, but I hold the key to that situation, myself. You two  needn&#8217;t know all the details, but now you know the principal points, and I  expect you to utilize them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  willing enough,&#8221; and Genevieve rocked back and forth thoughtfully, &#8220;and I may  think of a way&#8212;but, for the moment, I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Get  chummy with Maida,&#8221; suggested Appleby.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let  me do that,&#8221; Keefe interrupted. &#8220;Without undue conceit, I believe I can  influence the young lady, and I think Miss Lane, now that she knows the truth,  can jolly up Mr. Wheeler to good effect.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,  good gracious! What do you want to do?&#8221; and Genevieve giggled. &#8220;Say I entice  the old gentleman over the line&#8212;then his pardon is canceled and he&#8217;s a  criminal&#8212;then you agree to ignore the lapse if he meets your wishes&#8212;is that the  idea?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Appleby  smiled. &#8220;A little crude, Miss Lane. And beside, you couldn&#8217;t get him over the  line. He&#8217;s too accustomed to his limitations to be caught napping, and not even  your charms could decoy him over intentionally.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Think  so? Probably you&#8217;re right. Well, suppose I try to work through Maida. If I  could persuade Mr. Wheeler that she suffers from the stigma of her father&#8217;s  incomplete pardon&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  that&#8217;s it. This thing can&#8217;t be accomplished by brutal threats, it must be done  by subtle suggestion and convincing hints.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  my idea,&#8221; agreed Keefe. &#8220;If I can talk straight goods to Miss Wheeler and make  her see how much better it would be for her father in his latter years to be  freed from all touch of the past disgrace, she might coax him to listen to you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  right. Now, you know what you&#8217;re here for; just do what you can&#8212;but don&#8217;t make  a mess of things. I&#8217;d rather you did nothing than to do some fool thing!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Trust  us!&#8221; Genevieve encouraged him, as she rose. &#8220;Me and Curt may not put over a big  deal, but we won&#8217;t do anything silly.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  two men smiled as the girl, with a pleasant good-night, went away to her own  room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;She&#8217;s  true blue,&#8221; said Keefe.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  she is,&#8221; Appleby nodded. &#8220;All her frivolity is on the surface, like her powder  and paint. At heart, that child has only my interests. I quite appreciate it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  hope you think the same of me, Mr. Appleby.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do, Keefe. More, I trust you with my most confidential matters. I&#8217;ll own I want  this business here to come out in my favor. I can&#8217;t push Wheeler too hard&#8212;so I  ask your help. But, as I hinted, I&#8217;ve one rod yet in pickle. If necessary, I&#8217;ll  use it, but I&#8217;d rather not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course I hope you won&#8217;t have to, but, I&#8217;ll admit I don&#8217;t see much chance of  succeeding with the present outlook.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;To-morrow  morning will tell. If we can&#8217;t work the thing through by noon, say&#8212;I&#8217;ll spring  my last trap. Good-night, Keefe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good-night,  Mr. Appleby.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Without  apparent coercion the morning hours brought about a cozy session on the south  veranda with Miss Lane and Daniel Wheeler in attendance, while at the same  time, Keefe and Maida wandered over the beautiful park of the estate.</p>
  <p>Keefe  had gently guided the conversation into confidential channels, and when he  ventured to sympathize with the girl in regard to her father&#8217;s deprivation he  was surprised at her ready acceptance of it.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  you know, don&#8217;t you, Mr. Keefe!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;But you don&#8217;t know all it  means to me. You see&#8221;&#8212;she blushed but went steadily on&#8212;&#8221;you see, I&#8217;m engaged  to&#8212;to a man I adore. And&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  tell me if you&#8217;d rather not,&#8221; he murmured.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  it&#8217;s a relief to tell&#8212;and, somehow&#8212;you seem so wise and strong&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go  on then&#8212;please.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  kind voice helped her and Maida resumed: &#8220;Well, Jeff&#8212;Mr. Allen, lives in  Boston, and so&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  it would be very awkward if your father couldn&#8217;t go there.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  only that&#8212;but I&#8217;ve made a vow never to step foot into Massachusetts until my  father can do so, too. Nothing would induce me to break that vow!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  even your lover?&#8221; said Keefe, astonished.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  my father is more to me than any lover.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  you don&#8217;t truly love Mr. Allen.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, I do&#8212;I do! But father is my idol. I don&#8217;t believe any girl ever adored her  father as I do. All my life I&#8217;ve had only the one object&#8212;to make him forget&#8212;as  far as possible, his trouble. Now, if I were to marry and leave him&#8212;why, I  simply couldn&#8217;t do it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t  Mr. Allen live in Connecticut?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  his business interests are all in Boston, and he can&#8217;t be transplanted. Oh, if  father could only do what Mr. Appleby wants him to, then we could all be happy.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t  you persuade him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  tried my best. Mother has tried, too. But, you see, it&#8217;s a matter of principle,  and when principle is involved, we are all in the same boat. Mother and I would  scorn any wrongdoing quite as much as father does.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you&#8217;ll give up your life happiness for a principle?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course. Wouldn&#8217;t you? Wouldn&#8217;t every decent person? I couldn&#8217;t live at all, if  I were knowingly doing wrong.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  your&#8212;&#8221; Keefe stopped abruptly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know what you were going to say,&#8221; Maida spoke sadly; &#8220;you were going to say my  father did wrong. <i>I</i> don&#8217;t believe he  did.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  you know?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know in my own heart. I know he is incapable of the crime he was charged with.  I&#8217;m sure he is shielding some one else, or else some one did it of whom he has  no knowledge. But my father commit a crime? Never!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  you care to tell me the details?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know why I shouldn&#8217;t. It was long ago, you know, and dad was accused of  forgery. It was proved on him&#8212;or the jury thought it was&#8212;and he was convicted&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  sentenced?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  to a long prison term. But Governor Appleby pardoned him with that mean old  proviso, that he never should step into Massachusetts!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Was  your mother then the heir to the Massachusetts property?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  but Mr. Appleby knew she would be. So, when she did inherit, and had to live in  Massachusetts to hold the estate, Mr. Appleby thought he had dad where he  wanted him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Were  they foes?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Politically,  yes. Because dad did all he could to keep Mr. Appleby from being governor.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  didn&#8217;t succeed?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  but almost. So, then, Mr. Appleby did this pardon trick to get even with  father, and I think it turned out more serious than he anticipated. For mother  took up the feud, and she got lawyers and all that and arranged to have the  house built on the line between the states!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Was  the estate she inherited on both sides of the line?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no; but it was near the southern border of Massachusetts, and she bought enough  adjoining land to make the arrangement possible.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  the house isn&#8217;t on the ground she inherited?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  quite, but the lawyers decided it so that she really complies with the terms of  the will, so it&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Was  your mother the only heir?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  far as we can find out. I believe there was another branch of the family, but  we haven&#8217;t been able to trace it, so as the years go by, we feel more and more  confident there&#8217;s no other heir. Of course, should one turn up, his claim would  be recognized.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Further  talk quickly convinced Keefe that there was no hope of persuading Maida Wheeler  to influence or advise her father in any direction other than his idea of  right. No amount of urging or arguing would make Wheeler see his duty other  than he now saw it, or make Maida endeavor to change his views. With a sigh  over his failure, Keefe deftly turned the talk in other channels, and then they  strolled back to the house.</p>
  <p>As  was to be expected, Genevieve had made no progress with her part of the plan.  Her talk with Mr. Wheeler had availed nothing. He was courteous and kind; he  was amused at her gay, merry little ways; he politely answered her questions,  both serious and flippant, but absolutely nothing came of it all.</p>
  <p>Samuel  Appleby had a short but straightforward conversation with Mrs. Wheeler.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  Sara,&#8221; he said, &#8220;remember I&#8217;m your old friend as well as your relative.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t call you a relative,&#8221; she returned, calmly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  family connection, then; I don&#8217;t care what you call it. And I&#8217;m going to speak  right out, for I know better than to try sophistries. If you can get Dan to  play my game regarding my son&#8217;s campaign, I&#8217;ll see that Dan gets full pardon,  and at once. Then Maida can marry young Allen and you can all go to Boston to  live.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sam  Appleby, I&#8217;d rather never see Boston again, never have Dan see it, than to have  him agree to endorse principles that he does not believe! And Dan feels the  same way about it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  don&#8217;t you consider your daughter? Will you condemn Maida to a broken-hearted  life&#8212;?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maida  must decide for herself. I think Jeffrey Allen will yet persuade her to leave  her father. She is devoted to Dan, but she is deeply in love with Jeff and it&#8217;s  only natural she should go with him. Any other girl would do so without a  second thought. Maida is unusual, but I doubt if she can hold out much longer  against her lover&#8217;s pleading.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  think she will. Maida has your own unbreakable will.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  be it, then. The child must choose for herself. But it doesn&#8217;t alter the stand  Dan and I have taken.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing  can alter that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing,  Samuel Appleby.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  remains to be seen. Have I your permission to talk to Maida, alone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Certainly.  Why not? If you can persuade her to marry Jeff, I&#8217;ll be only too glad. If you  find her determined to stand by her father, then the case remains as it is at  present.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  so, as Maida returned from her walk with Keefe, she was asked to go for another  stroll with Samuel Appleby.</p>
  <p>She  assented, though with no show of pleasure at the prospect.</p>
  <p>But  as they started off, she said: &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to have a talk with you, Mr. Appleby.  I want to appeal to your better nature.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good!  That&#8217;s just what I want&#8212;to appeal to yours. Suppose you word your appeal first.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mine  is simple to understand. It is only that having had your way and having spoiled  my father&#8217;s life for fifteen years, I ask you, in the name of humanity and  justice, to arrange matters so that his latter years of life shall be free from  the curse you put upon him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  didn&#8217;t put it upon him&#8212;he brought it on himself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  never committed that crime&#8212;and you know it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  do you mean by that?&#8221; Appleby gave her a startled glance.</p>
  <p>Had  Maida seen this glance, she might have been enlightened. But her eyes were cast  down, and she went on: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know it surely, but I am positive in my own  heart father never did it. However, that&#8217;s past history. All I ask now is his  full pardon&#8212;which, I know, you can bring about if you want to.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  I will, willingly and gladly, if your father will grant my request.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;To  put your son in as governor with the same political views that prevented my  father from voting for you! You know he can&#8217;t do that!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  yet you expect me to favor him!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  don&#8217;t you see the difference? Your pardon will mean everything to father&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  to you!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  but that&#8217;s a secondary consideration. I&#8217;d ask this for father just the same, if  it meant disaster for me!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  believe you would!&#8221; and Appleby gazed admiringly at the sweet, forceful face,  and the earnest eyes.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course I should! As I say, it means life&#8217;s happiness to him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  his consent means just as much to me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  it doesn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s just it. Even though father doesn&#8217;t definitely help you in  your son&#8217;s election, he will do nothing to hinder. And that&#8217;s much the same.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  far from being the same. His positive and definite help is a very different  matter from his negative lack of interference. It&#8217;s the help I want. And I do  want it! Do you suppose I&#8217;d come here and urge it&#8212;beg for it&#8212;if I didn&#8217;t think  it absolutely necessary?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  I suppose not. But I know he never will grant it, so you may as well give up  hope.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  know that, do you, Maida?&#8221; Appleby&#8217;s voice was almost wistful.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  most certainly do,&#8221; and the girl nodded her head positively.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  listen to me. I have one argument yet unused. I&#8217;m going to use it now. And with  you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maida  looked up in alarm. Appleby&#8217;s face was stern, his tone betokened a final, even  desperate decision.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  not with me,&#8221; she cried; &#8220;I&#8212;I&#8217;m only a girl&#8212;I don&#8217;t know about these things&#8212;let&#8217;s  go where father is.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  you are the one. In your hands must rest your father&#8217;s fate&#8212;your father&#8217;s  future. Sit here, beneath the old sycamore&#8212;you know about the tree?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  of course.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never  mind that now; I&#8217;ve only a few moments, but that&#8217;s time enough. You know,  Maida, how your mother holds this estate?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;she  must live in Massachusetts. Well, we do. The lawyers said&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  isn&#8217;t the point; this is it. There is another heir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve  always thought it possible.&#8221; Maida spoke coolly, though a dull fear clutched  her heart.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  more than a possibility, it&#8217;s a fact. I know it&#8212;and I know the heir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  is it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never  mind for the moment. Suffice it to say that he doesn&#8217;t know it himself&#8212;that no  one knows it but me. Now, you and I know. No one else does. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
  <p>His  keen gaze at her made her understand.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8212;&#8221;  she faltered.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  do understand,&#8221; he asserted. &#8220;You sense my proposition before I make it. And  you have it right&#8212;you&#8217;re a smart girl, Maida. Yes, I suggest that you and I  keep our secret, and that in return for my silence you persuade your father to  meet my wishes. Then, he shall be fully pardoned, and all will be well.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  criminal! You dishonest and dishonorable man!&#8221; she cried, her eyes blazing, her  cheeks reddening with her righteous indignation.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There,  there, my girl, have a care. You haven&#8217;t thought it all out yet. Doubtless you&#8217;re  going to say that neither your father nor mother want to remain here, if my  statement is true.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course I say that! They won&#8217;t want to stay a minute! Who is the heir? Tell me!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  have you thought what it will mean to them to leave this place? Have you  realized that your father has no business interests nor can he find any at his  age? Do you remember that your mother has no funds outside the estate she  inherited? Do you want to plunge them into penury, into pauperism, in their  declining years?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;if  honesty requires it&#8212;&#8221; but the sweet voice trembled at the thought.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Honesty  is a good thing&#8212;a fine policy&#8212;but you are a devoted daughter, and I remind you  that to tell this thing I have told you, means disaster&#8212;ruin for you and your  parents. Young Allen can&#8217;t support them&#8212;they are unaccustomed to  deprivation&#8212;and,&#8221; he lowered his voice, &#8220;this heir I speak of has no knowledge  of the truth. He misses nothing, since he hopes for nothing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maida  looked at him helplessly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  must think,&#8221; she said, brokenly. &#8220;Oh, you are cruel, to put this responsibility  on me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  know why I do it. I am not disinterested.&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore4"></a>Chapter 4 <br>
The Big Sycamore Tree</b></h2>
  <p>At  the south door the Appleby car stood waiting.</p>
  <p>Genevieve  was saying good-bye to Maida, with the affection of an old friend.</p>
  <p>&#8220;We&#8217;re  coming back, you know,&#8221; she reminded, &#8220;in two or three days, and please say you&#8217;ll  be glad to see me!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course,&#8221; Maida assented, but her lip trembled and her eyes showed signs of  ready tears.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Cheer  up,&#8221; Genevieve babbled on. &#8220;I&#8217;m your friend&#8212;whatever comes with time!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  am I,&#8221; put in Curtis Keefe. &#8220;Good-bye for a few days, Miss Wheeler.&#8221;</p>
  <p>How  Maida did it, she scarcely knew herself, but she forced a smile, and even when  Samuel Appleby gave her a warning glance at parting she bravely responded to  his farewell words, and even gaily waved her hand as the car rolled down the  drive.</p>
  <p>Once  out of earshot, Appleby broke out:</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  played my trump card! No, you needn&#8217;t ask me what I was, for I don&#8217;t propose to  tell you. But it will take the trick, I&#8217;m sure. Why, it&#8217;s got to!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  must be something pretty forcible, then,&#8221; said Keefe, &#8220;for it looked to me  about as likely as snow in summertime, that any of those rigid Puritans would  ever give in an inch to your persuasions.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Or  mine,&#8221; added Genevieve. &#8220;Never before have I failed so utterly to make any  headway when I set out to be really persuasive.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  did your best, Miss Lane,&#8221; and Appleby looked at her with the air of one  appraising the efficiency of a salesman. &#8220;I confess I didn&#8217;t think Wheeler  would be quite such a hardshell&#8212;after all these years.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s  just like concrete,&#8221; Keefe observed. &#8220;They all are. I didn&#8217;t know there were  such conscientious people left in this wicked old world!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;They&#8217;re  not really in the world,&#8221; Appleby declared. &#8220;They&#8217;ve merely vegetated in that  house of theirs, never going anywhere&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  come now, Mr. Appleby,&#8221; and Genevieve shook her head, &#8220;Boston isn&#8217;t the only  burg on the planet! They often go to New York, and that&#8217;s going some!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  really often&#8212;I asked Wheeler. He hasn&#8217;t been for five or six years, and though  Maida goes occasionally, to visit friends, she soon runs back home to her father.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; Keefe said, &#8220;they&#8217;re by no means mossbacks or hayseeds. They&#8217;re  right there with the goods, when it comes to modern literature or up-to-date  news&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, they&#8217;re a highbrow bunch,&#8221; Appleby spoke impatiently; &#8220;but a recluse like  that is no sort of a man! The truth is, I&#8217;m at the end of my patience! I&#8217;ve got  to put this thing over with less palaver and circumlocution. I thought I&#8217;d give  him a chance&#8212;just put the thing up to him squarely once&#8212;and, as he doesn&#8217;t see  fit to meet me half-way, he&#8217;s got to be the loser, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  seems to be the loser, as it is.&#8221; This from Keefe.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  nothing to what&#8217;s coming to him! Why, the idea of my sparing him at all is  ridiculous! If he doesn&#8217;t come down, he&#8217;s got to be wiped out! That&#8217;s what it  amounts to!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wiped  out&#8212;how?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Figuratively  and literally! Mentally, morally and physically! That&#8217;s how! I&#8217;ve stood all I  can&#8212;I&#8217;ve waited long enough&#8212;too long&#8212;and now I&#8217;m going to play the game my own  way! As I said, I played a trump card&#8212;I raised one pretty definite ruction just  before we left. Now, that may do the business&#8212;and, it may not! If not, then  desperate measures are necessary&#8212;and will be used!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good  gracious, Mr. Appleby!&#8221; Genevieve piped up from her fur collar which nearly  muffled her little face. &#8220;You sound positively murderous!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Murder!  Pooh, I&#8217;d kill Dan Wheeler in a minute, if that would help Sam! But I don&#8217;t  want Wheeler dead&#8212;I want him alive&#8212;I want his help&#8212;his influence&#8212;yet, when he  sits there looking like a stone wall, and about as easy to overthrow, I declare  I <i>could</i> kill him! But I don&#8217;t intend  to. It&#8217;s far more likely he&#8217;d kill me!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;  exclaimed Keefe. &#8220;Why should he? And&#8212;but you&#8217;re joking.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  at all. Wheeler isn&#8217;t of the murderer type, or I&#8217;d be taking my life in my hands  to go into his house! He hates me with all the strength of a hard, bigoted, but  strictly just nature. He thinks I was unjust in the matter of his pardon, he  thinks I was contemptible, and false to our old-time friendship; and he would  be honestly and truly glad if I were dead. But&#8212;thank heaven&#8212;he&#8217;s no murderer!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course not!&#8221; cried Genevieve. &#8220;How you do talk! As if murder were an everyday  performance! Why, people in our class don&#8217;t kill each other!&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  placid assumption of equality of class with her employer was so consistently  Miss Lane&#8217;s usual attitude, that it caused no mental comment from either of her  hearers. Her services were so valuable that any such little idiosyncrasy was  tolerated.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course we don&#8217;t&#8212;often,&#8221; agreed Appleby, &#8220;but I&#8217;d wager a good bit that if Dan  Wheeler could bump me off without his conscience knowing it&#8212;off I&#8217;d go!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; said Genevieve, musingly&#8212;&#8221;but I do believe that girl  would do it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What?&#8221;  cried Keefe. &#8220;Maida!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  she&#8217;s a lamb for looks, but she&#8217;s got a lion&#8217;s heart&#8212;if anybody ever had one!  Talk about a tigress protecting her cubs; it would be a milk-and-water  performance beside Maida Wheeler shielding her father&#8212;or fighting for him&#8212;yes,  or killing somebody for him!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rubbish!&#8221;  laughed Appleby. &#8220;Maida might be willing enough, in that lion heart of hers&#8212;but  little girls don&#8217;t go around killing people.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know it, and I don&#8217;t expect her to. But I only say she&#8217;s capable of it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Goethe  says&#8212;(Keefe spoke in his superior way)&#8212;&#8217;We are all capable of crime, even the  best of us.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  remember that phrase,&#8221; mused Appleby. &#8220;Is it Goethe&#8217;s? Well, I don&#8217;t say it&#8217;s  literally true, for lots of people are too much of a jellyfish makeup to have  such a capability. But I do believe there are lots of strong, forcible people,  who are absolutely capable of crime&#8212;if the opportunity offers.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  it,&#8221; and Genevieve nodded her head wisely. &#8220;Opportunity is what counts. I&#8217;ve  read detective stories, and they prove it. Be careful, Mr. Appleby, how you  trust yourself alone with Mr. Wheeler.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  will do,&#8221; he reprimanded. &#8220;I can take care of myself, Miss Lane.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Genevieve  always knew when she had gone too far, and, instead of sulking, she tactfully  changed the subject and entertained the others with her amusing chatter, at  which she was a success.</p>
  <p>At  that very moment, Maida Wheeler, alone in her room, was sobbing wildly, yet  using every precaution that she shouldn&#8217;t be heard.</p>
  <p>Thrown  across her bed, her face buried in the pillows, she fairly shook with the  intensity of her grief.</p>
  <p>But,  as often happens, after she had brought her crying spell to a finish&#8212;and  exhausted Nature insists on a finish&#8212;she rose and bathed her flushed face and  sat down to think it out calmly.</p>
  <p>Yet  the more she thought the less calm she grew.</p>
  <p>For  the first time in her life she was face to face with a great question which she  could not refer to her parents. Always she had confided in them, and matters  that seemed great to her, even though trifling in themselves, were invariably  settled and straightened out by her wise and loving father or mother.</p>
  <p>But  now, Samuel Appleby had told her a secret&#8212;a dreadful secret&#8212;that she must not  only weigh and decide about, but must&#8212;at least, until she decided&#8212;keep from her  parents.</p>
  <p>&#8220;For,&#8221;  Maida thought, &#8220;if I tell them, they&#8217;ll at once insist on knowing who the  rightful heir is, they&#8217;ll give over the place to him&#8212;and what will become of  us?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Her  conscience was as active as ever it was, her sense of right and wrong was in no  way warped or blunted, but instinct told her that she must keep this matter  entirely to herself until she had come to her own conclusion. Moreover, she  realized, the conclusion must be her own&#8212;the decision must be arrived at by  herself, and unaided.</p>
  <p>Finally,  accepting all this, she resolved to put the whole thing out of her mind for the  moment. Her parents were so intimately acquainted with her every mood or shade  of demeanor, they would see at once that something was troubling her mind,  unless she used the utmost care to prevent it. Care, too, not to overdo her  precaution. It would be quite as evident that she was concealing something, if  she were unusually gay or carefree of manner.</p>
  <p>So  the poor child went downstairs, determined to forget utterly the news she had  heard, until such time as she could be again by herself.</p>
  <p>And  she succeeded. Though haunted by a vague sense of being deceitful, she behaved  so entirely as usual, that neither of her parents suspected her of pretense.</p>
  <p>Moreover,  the subject of Samuel Appleby&#8217;s visit was such a fruitful source of conversation  that there was less chance of minor considerations.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never  will I consent,&#8221; her father was reiterating, as Maida entered the room. &#8220;Why,  Sara, I&#8217;d rather have the conditional pardon rescinded, rather pay full penalty  of my conviction, than stand for the things young Sam&#8217;s campaign must stand  for!&#8221;</p>
  <p>A  clenched fist came down on the table by way of emphasis.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  dad,&#8221; said Maida, gaily, &#8220;don&#8217;t thump around like that! You look as if you&#8217;d  like to thump Mr. Appleby!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  I should! I wish I could bang into his head just how I feel about it&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  he knows!&#8221; and Mrs. Wheeler smiled. &#8220;He knows perfectly how you feel.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,  truly, mother, don&#8217;t you think dad could&#8212;well, not do anything wrong&#8212;but just  give in to Mr. Appleby&#8212;for&#8212;for my sake?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maida&#8212;dear&#8212;that  is our only stumbling-block. Your father and I would not budge one step, for  ourselves&#8212;but for you, and for Jeffrey&#8212;oh, my dear little girl, that&#8217;s what  makes it so hard.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;For  us, then&#8212;father, can&#8217;t you&#8212;for our sake&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maida  broke down. It wasn&#8217;t for her sake she was pleading&#8212;nor for the sake of her  lover. It was for the sake of her parents&#8212;that they might remain in comfort&#8212;and  yet, comfort at the expense of honesty? Oh, the problem was too great&#8212;she hadn&#8217;t  worked it out yet.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t think,&#8221; her father&#8217;s grave voice broke in on her tumultuous thoughts. &#8220;I  can&#8217;t believe, Maida, that you would want my freedom at the cost of my seared  conscience.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  oh, no, father, I don&#8217;t&#8212;you know I don&#8217;t. But what is this dreadful thing you&#8217;d  have to countenance if you linked up on the Appleby side? Are they pirates&#8212;or  rascals?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  from their own point of view,&#8221; and Dan Wheeler smiled. &#8220;They think we are! You  can&#8217;t understand politics, child, but you must know that a man who is heart and  soul in sympathy with the principles of his party can&#8217;t conscientiously cross  over and work for the other side.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I know that, and I know that tells the whole story. But, father, think what  there is at stake. Your freedom&#8212;and&#8212;ours!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know that, Maida dear, and you can never know how my very soul is torn as I try  to persuade myself that for those reasons it would be right for me to consent.  Yet&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>He  passed his hand wearily across his brow, and then folding his arms on the table  he let his head sink down upon them.</p>
  <p>Maida  flew to his side. &#8220;Father, dearest,&#8221; she crooned over him, as she caressed his  bowed head, &#8220;don&#8217;t think of it for a minute! You know I&#8217;d give up anything&#8212;I&#8217;d  give up Jeff&#8212;if it means one speck of good for you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know it, dear child, but&#8212;run away, now, Maida, leave me to myself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Understanding,  both Maida and her mother quietly left the room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  sorry, girlie dear, that you have to be involved in these scenes,&#8221; Mrs. Wheeler  said fondly, as the two went to the sitting-room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  talk that way, mother. I&#8217;m part of the family, and I&#8217;m old enough to have a  share and a voice in all these matters. But just think what it would mean, if  father had his pardon! Look at this room, and think, he has never been in it!  Never has seen the pictures&#8212;the view from the window, the general coziness of  it all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know, dear, but that&#8217;s an old story. Your father is accustomed to living only  in his own rooms&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  not to be able to go to the other end of the dining-room or living-room, if he  chooses! It&#8217;s outrageous!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Maida, I quite agree&#8212;but no more outrageous than it was last week&#8212;or last year.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  it is! It grows more outrageous every minute! Mother, what did that old will  say? That you must live in Massachusetts?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;you  know that, dear.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course I do. And if you lived elsewhere, what then?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  forfeit the inheritance.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  what would become of it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  default of any other heirs, it would go to the State of Massachusetts.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  there are no other heirs?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  ails you, Maida? You know all this. No, there are no other heirs.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  sure?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  sure as we can be. Your father had every possible search made. There were  advertisements kept in the papers for years, and able lawyers did all they  could to find heirs if there were any. And, finding none, we were advised that  there were none, and we could rest in undisturbed possession.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Suppose  one should appear, what then?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,  little girl, we&#8217;d give him the keys of the house, and walk out.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  would we walk to?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  no idea. In fact, I can&#8217;t imagine where we could walk to. But that, thank  heaven, is not one of our troubles. Your father would indeed be desperately  fixed if it were! You know, Maida, from a fine capable business man, he became  a wreck, because of that unjust trial.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Father <i>never</i> committed the forgery?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course not, dear.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  did?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We  don&#8217;t know. It was cleverly done, and the crime was purposely fastened on your  father, because he was about to be made the rival candidate of Mr. Appleby, for  governor.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know. And Mr. Appleby was at the bottom of it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Your  father doesn&#8217;t admit that&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  must have been.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hush,  Maida. These matters are not for you to judge. You know your father has done  all he honestly could to be fully pardoned, or to discover the real criminal,  and as he hasn&#8217;t succeeded, you must rest content with the knowledge that there  was no stone left unturned.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,  mother, suppose Mr. Appleby has something more up his sleeve. Suppose he comes  down on dad with some unexpected, some unforeseen blow that&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maida,  be quiet. Don&#8217;t make me sorry that we have let you into our confidence as far  as we have. These are matters above your head. Should such a thing as you hint  occur, your father can deal with it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I want to help&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you can best do that by not trying to help! Your part is to divert your father,  to love him and cheer him and entertain him. You know this, and you know for  you to undertake to advise or suggest is not only ridiculous but disastrous.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, mother, I&#8217;ll be good. I don&#8217;t mean to be silly.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  are, when you assume ability you don&#8217;t possess.&#8221; Mrs. Wheeler&#8217;s loving smile  robbed the words of any harsh effect. &#8220;Run along now, and see if dad won&#8217;t go  for a walk with you; and don&#8217;t refer to anything unpleasant.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maida  went, and found Wheeler quite ready for a stroll</p>
  <p>&#8220;Which  way?&#8221; he asked as they crossed the south veranda.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Round  the park, and bring up under the tree, and have tea there,&#8221; dictated Maida, her  heart already lighter as she obeyed her mother&#8217;s dictum to avoid unpleasant  subjects.</p>
  <p>But  as they walked on, and trivial talk seemed to pall, they naturally reverted to  the discussion of their recent guests.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Appleby is an old curmudgeon,&#8221; Maida declared; &#8220;Mr. Keefe is nice and  well-behaved; but the little Lane girl is a scream! I never saw any one so  funny. Now she was quite a grand lady, and then she was a common little piece!  But underneath it all she showed a lot of good sense and I&#8217;m sure in her work  she has real ability.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Appleby  wouldn&#8217;t keep her if she didn&#8217;t have,&#8221; her father rejoined; &#8220;but why do you call  him a curmudgeon? He&#8217;s very well-mannered.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, he is. And to tell the truth, I&#8217;m not sure just what a curmudgeon is.  But&#8212;he&#8217;s it, anyway.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  gather you don&#8217;t especially admire my old friend.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Friend!  If he&#8217;s a friend&#8212;give me enemies!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Fie,  fie, Maida, what do you mean? Remember, he gave me my pardon.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  a high old pardon! Say, dad, tell me again exactly how he worded that letter  about the tree.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  told you a dozen times! He didn&#8217;t mean anything anyhow. He only said, that when  the big sycamore tree went into Massachusetts I could go.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  a crazy thing to say, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  was because we had been talking about the play of <i>Macbeth</i>. You remember, &#8216;Till Birnam Wood shall come to Dunsinane.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, and then it did come&#8212;by a trick.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  the men came, carrying branches. We&#8217;d been talking about it, discussing some  point, and then&#8212;it seemed clever, I suppose&#8212;to Appleby, and he wrote that about  the sycamore.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Meaning&#8212;never?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Meaning  never.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  Birnam Wood did go.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only  by a trick, and that would not work in this case. Why, are you thinking of  carrying a branch of sycamore into Massachusetts?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maida  returned his smile as she answered: &#8220;I&#8217;d manage to carry the whole tree in, if  it would do any good! But, I s&#8217;pose, old Puritan Father, you&#8217;re too  conscientious to take advantage of a trick?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t  say, till I know the details of the game. But I doubt Appleby&#8217;s being unable to  see through your trick, and then&#8212;where are you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  wouldn&#8217;t matter. Trick or no trick, if the big sycamore went into Massachusetts,  you could go. But I don&#8217;t see any good plan for getting it in. And, too,  Sycamore Ridge wouldn&#8217;t be Sycamore Ridge without it. Don&#8217;t you love the old  tree, dad?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course, as I love every stick and stone about the place. It has been a real  haven to me in my perturbed life.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Suppose  you had to leave it, daddy?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  think I&#8217;d die, dear. Unless, that is, we could go back home.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t  this home?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  the dearest spot on earth&#8212;outside my native state.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There,  there, dad, don&#8217;t let&#8217;s talk about it. We&#8217;re here for keeps&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Heaven  send we are, dearest! I couldn&#8217;t face the loss of this place. What made you  think of such a thing?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I&#8217;m thinking of all sorts of things to-day. But, father, while we&#8217;re talking of  moving&#8212;couldn&#8217;t you&#8212;oh, couldn&#8217;t you, bring yourself, somehow, to do what Mr.  Appleby wants you to do? I don&#8217;t know much about it&#8212;but father, darling, if you <i>only could!&#8221;</i></p>
  <p>&#8220;Maida,  my little girl, don&#8217;t think I haven&#8217;t tried. Don&#8217;t think I don&#8217;t realize what  it means to you and Jeff. I know&#8212;oh, I <i>do</i> know how it would simplify matters if I should go over to the Appleby side&#8212;and  push Sam&#8217;s campaign&#8212;as I could do it. I know that it would mean my full pardon,  my return to my old home, my reunion with old scenes and associations. And more  than that, it would mean the happiness of my only child&#8212;my daughter&#8212;and her  chosen husband. And yet, Maida, as God is my judge, I am honest in my assertion  that I <i>can&#8217;t</i> so betray my honor and spend  my remaining years a living lie. I can&#8217;t do it, Maida&#8212;I <i>can&#8217;t</i>.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  the calm, sorrowful countenance he turned to the girl was more positive and  final than any further protestation could have been.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore5"></a>Chapter 5 <br>
The Bugle Sounded Taps</b></h2>
  <p>Although  the portions of the house and grounds that were used by Wheeler included the  most attractive spots, yet there were many forbidden places that were a real  temptation to him.</p>
  <p>An  especial one was the flower-covered arbor that had so charmed Genevieve and  another was the broad and beautiful north veranda. To be sure, the south piazza  was equally attractive, but it was galling to be compelled to avoid any part of  his own domain. However, the passing years had made the conditions a matter of  habit and it was only occasionally that Wheeler&#8217;s annoyance was poignant.</p>
  <p>In  fact, he and his wife bore the cross better than did Maida. She had never  become reconciled to the unjust and arbitrary dictum of the conditional pardon.  She lived in a constant fear lest her father should some day inadvertently and  unintentionally step on the forbidden ground, and it should be reported.  Indeed, knowing her father&#8217;s quixotic honesty, she was by no means sure he  wouldn&#8217;t report it himself.</p>
  <p>It  had never occurred&#8212;probably never would occur, and yet, she often imagined some  sudden emergency, such as a fire, or burglars, that might cause his impulsive  invasion of the other side of the house.</p>
  <p>In  her anxiety she had spoken of this to Samuel Appleby when he was there. But he  gave her no satisfaction. He merely replied: &#8220;A condition is a condition.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Curtis  Keefe had tried to help her cause, by saying: &#8220;Surely a case of danger would  prove an exception to the rule,&#8221; but Appleby had only shaken his head in  denial.</p>
  <p>Though  care had been taken to have the larger part of the house on the Massachusetts  side of the line, yet the rooms most used by the family were in Connecticut.  Here was Mr. Wheeler&#8217;s den, and this had come to be the most used room in the  whole house. Mrs. Wheeler&#8217;s sitting-room, which her husband never had entered,  was also attractive, but both mother and daughter invaded the den, whenever  leisure hours were to be enjoyed.</p>
  <p>The  den contained a large south bay window, which was Maida&#8217;s favorite spot. It had  a broad, comfortable window-seat, and here she spent much of her time, curled  up among the cushions, reading. There were long curtains, which, half-drawn,  hid her from view, and often she was there for hours, without her father&#8217;s  knowing it.</p>
  <p>His  own work was engrossing. Cut off from his established law business in Massachusetts,  he had at first felt unable to start it anew in different surroundings. Then,  owing to his wife&#8217;s large fortune, it was decided that he should give up all  business for a time. And as the time went on, and there was no real necessity  for an added income, Wheeler had indulged in his hobby of book collecting, and  had amassed a library of unique charm as well as goodly intrinsic value.</p>
  <p>Moreover,  it kept him interested and occupied, and prevented his becoming morose or  melancholy over his restricted life.</p>
  <p>So,  many long days he worked away at his books, and Maida, hidden in the window-seat,  watched him lovingly in the intervals of her reading.</p>
  <p>Sitting  there, the morning after Samuel Appleby&#8217;s departure, she read not at all,  although a book lay open on her lap. She was trying to decide a big matter,  trying to solve a vexed question.</p>
  <p>Maida&#8217;s  was a straightforward nature. She never deceived herself. If she did anything  against her better judgment, even against her conscience, it was with open eyes  and understanding mind. She used no sophistry, no pretence, and if she acted  mistakenly she was always satisfied to abide by the consequences.</p>
  <p>And  now, she set about her problem, systematically and methodically, determined to  decide upon her course, and then strictly follow it.</p>
  <p>She  glanced at her father, absorbed in his book catalogues and indexes, and a great  wave of love and devotion filled her heart. Surely no sacrifice was too great  that would bring peace or pleasure to that martyred spirit.</p>
  <p>That  he was a martyr, Maida was as sure as she was that she was alive. She knew him  too well to believe for an instant that he had committed a criminal act; it was  an impossibility for one of his character. But that she could do nothing about.  The question had been raised and settled when she was too young to know anything  about it, and now, her simple duty was to do anything she might to ease his  burden and to help him to forget.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And,&#8221;  she said to herself, &#8220;first of all, he must stay in this home. He positively <i>must</i>&#8212;and that&#8217;s all there is about that.  Now, if he knows&#8212;if he has the least hint that there is another heir, he&#8217;ll get  out at once&#8212;or at least, he&#8217;ll move heaven and earth to find the heir, and then  we&#8217;ll have to move. And where to? That&#8217;s an unanswerable question. Anyway, I&#8217;ve  only one sure conviction. I&#8217;ve got to keep from him all knowledge or suspicion  of that other heir!</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maybe  it isn&#8217;t true&#8212;maybe Mr. Appleby made it up&#8212;but I don&#8217;t think so. At any rate, I  have to proceed as if it were true, and do my best. And, first of all, I&#8217;ve got  to hush up my own conscience. I&#8217;ve too much of my father&#8217;s nature to want to  live here if it rightfully belongs to somebody else. I feel like a thief  already. But I&#8217;m going to bear that&#8212;I&#8217;m going to live under that horrid  conviction that I&#8217;m living a lie&#8212;for father&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maida  was in earnest. By nature and by training her conscience was acutely sensitive  to the finest shades of right and wrong. She actually longed to announce the  possibility of another heir and let justice decide the case. But her filial  devotion was, in this thing, greater even than her conscience. Her mother, too,  she knew, would be crushed by the revelation of the secret, but would insist on  thorough investigation, and, if need be, on renunciation of the dear home.</p>
  <p>Her  mental struggle went on. At times it seemed as if she couldn&#8217;t live beneath the  weight of such a secret. Then, she knew she must do it. What was her own peace  of mind compared with her father&#8217;s? What was her own freedom of conscience  compared with his tranquillity?</p>
  <p>She  thought of telling Jeffrey Allen. But, she argued, he would feel as the others  would&#8212;indeed, as she herself did&#8212;that the matter must be dragged out into the  open and settled one way or the other.</p>
  <p>No;  she must bear the brunt of the thing alone. She must never tell any one.</p>
  <p>Then,  the next point was, would Mr. Appleby tell? He hadn&#8217;t said so, but she felt  sure he would. Well, she must do all she could to prevent that. He was to  return in a day or two. By that time she must work out some plan, must think up  some way, to persuade him not to tell. What the argument would be, she had no  idea, but she was determined to try her uttermost.</p>
  <p>There  was one way&#8212;but Maida blushed even at the thought.</p>
  <p>Sam  Appleby&#8212;young Sam&#8212;wanted to marry her&#8212;had wanted to for a year or more. Many  times she had refused him, and many times he had returned for another attempt  at persuasion. To consent to this would enable her to control the senior  Appleby&#8217;s revelations.</p>
  <p>It  would indeed be a last resort&#8212;she wouldn&#8217;t even think of it yet; surely there  was some other way!</p>
  <p>The  poor, tortured child was roused from her desperate plannings by a cheery voice,  calling:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maida&#8212;Maida!  Here&#8217;s me!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Jeffrey!&#8221;  she cried, springing from the window-seat, and out to greet him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Dear!&#8221;  he said, as he took her in his arms. &#8220;Dear, dearer, dearest! <i>What </i>is troubling you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Trouble?  Nothing! How can I be troubled when you&#8217;re here?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you are! You can&#8217;t fool me, you know! Never mind, you can tell me later. I&#8217;ve  got three whole days&#8212;how&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Splendid!  How did it happen?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Old  Bennett went off for a week&#8217;s rest&#8212;doctor&#8217;s orders&#8212;and he said, if I did up my  chores, nice and proper, I could take a little vacation myself. Oh, you peach!  You&#8217;re twice as beautifuller as ever!&#8221;</p>
  <p>A  whirlwind embrace followed this speech and left Maida, breathless and laughing,  while her father smiled benignly upon the pair.</p>
  <p>It  was some hours later that, as they sat under the big sycamore, Jeffrey Allen  begged Maida to tell him her troubles.</p>
  <p>&#8220;For  I know you&#8217;re pretty well broken up over something,&#8221; he declared.</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  do you know?&#8221; she smiled at him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  my girl, I know every shadow that crosses your dear heart.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  I wear my heart on my sleeve, then?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  don&#8217;t have to, for me to see it. I recognize the signs from your face, your  manner, your voice&#8212;your whole being is trembling with some fear or some  deeply-rooted grief. So tell me all about it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  Maida told. Not the last horrible threat that Samuel Appleby had told her  alone, but the state of things as Appleby had presented it to Daniel Wheeler  himself.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  so you see, Jeff, it&#8217;s a deadlock. Father won&#8217;t vote for young Sam&#8212;I don&#8217;t mean  only vote, but throw all his influence&#8212;and that means a lot&#8212;on Sam&#8217;s side. And  if he doesn&#8217;t, Mr. Appleby won&#8217;t get him pardoned&#8212;you know we hoped he would  this year&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  dear; it would mean so much to us.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  and to dad and mother, too. Well, there&#8217;s no hope of that, unless father throws  himself heart and soul into the Appleby campaign.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  he won&#8217;t do that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course not. He couldn&#8217;t, Jeff. He&#8217;d have to subscribe to what he doesn&#8217;t  believe in&#8212;practically subscribe to a lie. And you know father&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  and you, too&#8212;and myself! None of us would want him to do that, Maida!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t  necessity <i>ever</i> justify a fraud, Jeff?&#8221;  The question was put so wistfully that the young man smiled.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nixy!  and you know that even better than I do, dear. Why, Maida, what I love you most  for&#8212;yes, even more than your dear, sweet, beauty of face, is the marvellous  beauty of your nature, your character. Your flawless soul attracted me first of  all&#8212;even as I saw it shining through your clear, honest eyes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Jeffrey,&#8221; and Maida&#8217;s clear eyes filled with tears, &#8220;I&#8217;m not honest, I&#8217;m not  true blue!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  nobody on this green earth is! Don&#8217;t say such things, dear. I know what you  mean, that you <i>think</i> you want your  father to sacrifice his principles, in part, at least, to gain his full pardon  thereby. See how I read your thoughts! But, you don&#8217;t really think that; you  only think you think it. If the thing came to a focus, you&#8217;d be the first one  to forbid the slightest deviation from the line of strictest truth and honor!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Jeff, do you think I would?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course I think so&#8212;I know it! You are a strange make-up, Maida. On an impulse, I  can imagine you doing something wrong&#8212;even something pretty awful&#8212;but with even  a little time for thought you <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> do a wrong.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What!&#8221;  Maida was truly surprised; &#8220;I could jump into any sort of wickedness?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  didn&#8217;t quite put it that way,&#8221; Jeff laughed, &#8220;but&#8212;well, you know it&#8217;s my  theory, that given opportunity, anybody can yield to temptation.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nonsense!  It&#8217;s a poor sort of honor that gives out at a critical moment!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  at all. Most people can resist anything&#8212;except temptation! Given a strong  enough temptation and a perfect opportunity, and your staunchest, most conscientious  spirit is going to succumb.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t believe that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  don&#8217;t have to&#8212;and maybe it isn&#8217;t always true. But it often is. Howsomever, it  has no bearing on the present case. Your father is not going to lose his  head&#8212;and though you might do so&#8221;&#8212;he smiled at her&#8212;&#8221;I can&#8217;t see you getting a  chance! You&#8217;re not in on the deal, in any way, are you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  except that Mr. Appleby asked me to use all my influence with father.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Which  you&#8217;ve done?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  but it made not the slightest impression.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course not. I say, Maid, young Sam isn&#8217;t coming down here, is he?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  that I know of,&#8221; but Maida couldn&#8217;t help her rising color, for she knew what  Allen was thinking.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  let him try it, that&#8217;s all! Just let him show his rubicund countenance in these  parts&#8212;if he wants trouble!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Does  anybody ever <i>want</i> trouble?&#8221; Maida  smiled a little.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  of course they do! Sometimes they want it so much that they borrow it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  not doing that! I&#8217;ve had it offered to me&#8212;in full measure, heaped up, pressed  down, and running over.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Poor  little girl. Don&#8217;t take it so hard, dearest. I&#8217;ll have a talk with your father,  and we&#8217;ll see how matters really stand. I doubt it&#8217;s as bad as you fear&#8212;and  anyway, if no good results come our way, things are no worse than they have  been for years. Your father has lived fairly contented and happy. Let things  drift, and in another year or two, after the election is a thing of the past,  we can pick up the pardon question again. By that time you and I will be&#8212;where  will we be, Maida?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know, Jeff&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  we&#8217;ll be together, anyway. You&#8217;ll be my wife, and if we can&#8217;t live in Boston&#8212;we  can live out of Boston! And that&#8217;s all there is about that!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll  have to come here to live. There&#8217;s enough for us all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Settle  down here and sponge on your mother! I see it! But, never you mind, lady fair,  something will happen to smooth out our path. Perhaps this old tree will take  it into its head to go over into Massachusetts, and so blaze a trail for your  father&#8212;and you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  very likely. But I&#8217;ve renewed my vow&#8212;Jeff; unless father can go into the state, <i>I</i> never will!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, sweetheart. Renew your vow whenever its time limit expires. I&#8217;m going to  fix things so no vows will be needed&#8212;except our marriage vows. Will you take  them, dear?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;When  the time comes, yes.&#8221; But Maida did not smile, and Jeff, watching her closely,  concluded there was yet some point on which she had not enlightened him.  However, he asked no further question, but bided his time.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Guess  I&#8217;ll chop down the old tree while I&#8217;m here, and ship it into Massachusetts as  firewood,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Fine  idea,&#8221; Maida acquiesced, &#8220;but you&#8217;d only have your trouble for your pains. You  see, the stipulation was, &#8216;without the intervention of human hands.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, we&#8217;ll chop it down by machinery, then.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  wish the tree promise meant anything, but it doesn&#8217;t. It was only made as a  proof positive how impossible was any chance of pardon.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  now a chance of pardon has come.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  but a chance that cannot be taken. You&#8217;ll be here, Jeff, when they come back.  Then you can talk with Mr. Appleby, and maybe, as man to man, you can convince  him&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Convince  nothing! Don&#8217;t you suppose I&#8217;ve tried every argument I know of, with that old  dunderhead? I&#8217;ve spent hours with him discussing your father&#8217;s case. I&#8217;ve  talked myself deaf, dumb and blind, with no scrap of success. But, I don&#8217;t mind  telling you, Maida, that I might have moved the old duffer to leniency if it  hadn&#8217;t been for&#8212;you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Me?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  you know well enough young Sam&#8217;s attitude toward you. And old Appleby as good  as said if I&#8217;d give up my claim on your favor, and give sonny Sam a chance,  there&#8217;d be hope for your father.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;H&#8217;m.  Indeed! You don&#8217;t say so! And you replied?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  didn&#8217;t reply much of anything. For if I&#8217;d said what I wanted to say, he would  have been quite justified in thinking that I was no fit mate for a Christian  girl! Let&#8217;s don&#8217;t talk about it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>That  night Maida went to her room, leaving Allen to have a long serious talk with  her father.</p>
  <p>She  hoped much from the confab, for Jeff Allen was a man of ideas, and of good,  sound judgment. He could see straight, and could advise sensibly and well. And  Maida hoped, too, that something would happen or some way be devised that the  secret told her by Appleby might be of no moment. Perhaps there was no heir,  save in the old man&#8217;s imagination. Or perhaps it was only someone who would  inherit a portion of the property, leaving enough for their own support and  comfort.</p>
  <p>At  any rate, she went to bed comforted and cheered by the knowledge that Jeff was  there, and that if there was anything to be done he would do it.</p>
  <p>She  had vague misgivings because she had not told him what Appleby had threatened.  But, she argued, if she decided to suppress that bit of news, she must not  breathe it to anybody&#8212;not even Jeff.</p>
  <p>So,  encouraged at the outlook, and exhausted by her day of worriment, she slept  soundly till well into the night.</p>
  <p>Then  she was awakened by a strange sound. It gave her, at first, a strange  impression of being on an ocean steamer. She couldn&#8217;t think why, for her  half-awake senses responded only to the vague sense of familiarity with such a  sound.</p>
  <p>But  wide awake in a moment, she heard more of it, and realized that it was a bugle  to which she listened&#8212;the clear, though not loud, notes of a bugle. Amazed, she  jumped from her bed, and looked out of a window in the direction of the sound.</p>
  <p>She  saw nothing, and heard the last faint notes die away, as she listened.</p>
  <p>There  was no further sound, and she returned to bed, and after a time fell asleep  again.</p>
  <p>She  pondered over the occurrence while dressing next morning, wondering what it  meant.</p>
  <p>Downstairs  she found only Jeffrey in the dining-room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hear  anything funny in the night, Maida?&#8221; he asked her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  a bugle,&#8221; she returned. &#8220;Did you hear it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course I did. Who plays the thing around here?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  one, that I know of. Wasn&#8217;t it rather strange?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rath-er!  I should say so. Made me think of the old English castles, where spooks walk  the parapets and play on bugles or bagpipes or some such doings.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  those silly stories! But this was a real bugle, played by a real man.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  do you know?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;By  the sound.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Spook  bugles sound just the same.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  do <i>you</i> know?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  could they be heard if they didn&#8217;t? Here&#8217;s your father. Good-morning, Mr.  Wheeler. Who&#8217;s your musical neighbor?&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  Daniel Wheeler did not smile.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go  up to your mother, Maida, dear,&#8221; he said; &#8220;she&#8212;she isn&#8217;t well. Cheer her up all  you can.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s  the trouble?&#8221; Allen asked, solicitously, as Maida ran from the room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  strange thing, my boy. Did you hear a bugle call last night?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir; it sounded &#8216;taps.&#8217; Is there a camp near by?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  nothing of the sort. Now&#8212;well, to put it frankly, there is an old tradition in  Mrs. Wheeler&#8217;s family that a phantom bugler, in that very way, announces an  approaching death.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good  Lord! You don&#8217;t mean she believes that!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  does, and what can I say to disprove her belief? We all heard it. Who could  have done such a trick?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know who, but somebody did. That bugle was played by a pair of good,  strong human lungs&#8212;not by a spirit breath!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  sounded so, but that doesn&#8217;t affect Mrs. Wheeler&#8217;s belief. If I could produce  the bugler, and get him to admit it, she might believe him, but otherwise, she&#8217;s  sure it was the traditional bugler, and that earthly days are numbered for some  one of our little family.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  don&#8217;t believe this foolishness, sir?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t; my nature rejects the very idea of the supernatural. Yet, who could or  would do it? There&#8217;s no neighbor who would, and I know of no one round here who  knows of the tradition.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  pshaw, it&#8217;s the merest casual occurrence. A Boy Scout, like as not&#8212;or a gay  young chap returning from a merry party. There are lots of explanations, quite  apart from spooks!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  hope you can persuade Mrs. Wheeler of that. She is nervously ill, and will hear  of no rational explanation for the bugle call.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Beg  her to come down to breakfast, do; then we&#8217;ll all jolly her up until she loses  her fears.&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  though Allen&#8217;s attempt was a brave one and ably seconded by Mrs. Wheeler&#8217;s  husband and daughter, they made not the slightest progress toward relieving her  fears or disabusing her mind of her conviction.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore6"></a>Chapter 6 <br>
The Other Heir</b></h2>
  <p>A  general air of vague foreboding hung over the Wheeler household. Mrs. Wheeler  tried to rally from the shock of the inexplicable bugle call, but though she  was bright and cheerful, it was fully evident that her manner was forced and  her gayety assumed.</p>
  <p>Maida,  solicitous for her mother, was more than ever resolved not to disclose the news  of another possible heir to the estate, though the more she thought about it,  the more she felt sure Samuel Appleby had spoken the truth.</p>
  <p>She  decided that he had learned of the other heir, and that he was none too honest  to be willing to keep the fact a secret, if, in turn, he could serve his own  ends. She did not need to be told that if she would look on young Sam with  favor, her father would perforce lend his aid to the campaign. And, in that  case, she knew that the other heir would never be mentioned again.</p>
  <p>And  yet, the price&#8212;the acceptance of young Sam, was more than she could pay. To  give up Jeff Allen, her own true love, and marry a man of such a different type  and calibre as Sam Appleby was&#8212;it was too much! And Jeff would have something  to say about that! Yet, she must decide for herself. If she made the supreme  sacrifice, it must be done as if of her own volition. If her parents or her  lover guessed that she was acting under compulsion, they would put an end to  the project.</p>
  <p>But  could she, even if willing to sacrifice herself, could she ask Sam Appleby to  take her? Yet she knew this would be the easiest thing in the world. A mere  hint to Mr. Appleby that she approved of his son would bring the younger man  down to the house at once and matters would then take care of themselves.</p>
  <p>But  could she do it? She looked at Jeff, as he sat talking to her father, his  strong, fine face alight with the earnestness of their discussion. He was a man  of a thousand&#8212;her own Jeffrey. No, she could not break his heart&#8212;she had no  right to do that. It would be a crime to blot out the joy and happiness from  the eager young face.</p>
  <p>And  then she looked at the other dear face. Her father, worn and aging, but still  in rugged health. Could she let the inevitable happen, and see him turned out  of the home that he loved&#8212;the home that had so long been his sanctuary, his  refuge from the cold injustice of his fellow-men?</p>
  <p>And  her mother, almost ill from her fright and foreboding. To add the disaster of  poverty and homelessness&#8212;no, she couldn&#8217;t do that!</p>
  <p>And  so poor Maida wondered and worried; her thoughts going round in a circle, and  coming back to the two men she loved, and knew she must break one heart or the  other.</p>
  <p>At  one moment her duty to her parents seemed preminent. Then, again, she realized  a duty to herself and to the man who loved her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know <i>what</i> to do,&#8221; she thought,  piteously; &#8220;I&#8217;ll wait till Mr. Appleby comes back here, and then I&#8217;ll tell him  just how I&#8217;m placed. Perhaps I can appeal to his better nature.&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  Maida Wheeler well knew that however she might appeal to Samuel Appleby, it  would be in vain. She knew from the very fact that he came to her home, and  made the offers and threats that he did make, that his mind was made up, and no  power on earth could move him from his decision. He had a strong case, he  probably thought; the offer of full pardon to Dan Wheeler, and the offer to  Maida to keep quiet about another heir, would, he doubtless thought, be  sufficient to win his cause.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  an awful man he is,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I wish he were dead! I know I oughtn&#8217;t to  wish that, but I do. I&#8217;d kill him myself if it would help father. I oughtn&#8217;t to  say that&#8212;and I don&#8217;t suppose I really would do it, but it would simplify  matters a lot! And somebody said, &#8216;We are all capable of crime&#8212;even the best of  us.&#8217; Well, of course I wouldn&#8217;t kill the old man, but he&#8217;d better not give me a  real good chance!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  are you thinking about, little girl?&#8221; asked Allen, turning to her.</p>
  <p>Maida  looked at him and then at her father, and said, deliberately:</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  was just thinking how I&#8217;d like to kill Samuel Appleby.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Senior,  junior, or both?&#8221; laughed Allen, who thought little of her words, save as a jest.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Senior,  I meant, but we may as well make it a wholesale slaughter.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,  Maida,&#8221; her father looked grieved. &#8220;Don&#8217;t speak flippantly of such subjects.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  father, why not be honest? Wouldn&#8217;t you like to kill him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  child&#8212;not that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you&#8217;d be glad if he were dead! There, you needn&#8217;t answer. But if you were  absolutely honest, you&#8217;d have to admit it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  admit it,&#8221; said her mother, wearily. &#8220;Samuel Appleby has spoiled all our  lives&#8212;is still spoiling them. He does it for his own selfish interests. He has  ruined the happiness of my husband, myself, my daughter, and my prospective  son-in-law. Is it any wonder that we should honestly wish he were dead? It may  not sound Christian&#8212;but it is an honest expression of human nature.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is, Mrs. Wheeler,&#8221; and Allen&#8217;s face looked more pained than shocked. &#8220;But, all  the same, we oughtn&#8217;t to talk like that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  indeed,&#8221; agreed Wheeler. &#8220;Please, Maida, darling, don&#8217;t say such things. And,  Sara, if you must say them, say them to me when we are alone. It&#8217;s no sort of  talk for these young people&#8217;s ears.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  I said it before mother did!&#8221; Maida broke out. &#8220;And I mean it! I&#8217;m at the end  of my rope. If that man is to hound us and torture us all our lives, I can&#8217;t  help wishing him dead.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There,  there, daughter, please don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  won&#8217;t, dad. I&#8217;ll never say it again. But I put myself on record, and if the  rest of you were honest, you&#8217;d do the same thing!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  we&#8217;d like to kill him?&#8221; asked Allen, smiling at the idea.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  didn&#8217;t say that&#8212;I said we wish him dead. If a nice, convenient stroke of  lightning came his way, or&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maida,  hush!&#8221; her father spoke sternly; &#8220;I won&#8217;t allow such talk! It isn&#8217;t like you,  my child, and it isn&#8217;t&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t  good form, I s&#8217;pose!&#8221; she interrupted. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll let up, dads, and I am a  little ashamed of myself. Mother, maybe the phantom bugler was announcing the  death of old Appleby!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hush,  Maida! What has got into you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  incorrigible, I guess&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  are!&#8221; and Allen smiled fondly at her. &#8220;Come out for a walk in the sunshine with  me, and get these awful thoughts out of your brain.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know I&#8217;m a criminal,&#8221; said Maida, as they walked down a garden path; &#8220;but I can&#8217;t  help it. I&#8217;ve more to bear than you know of, Jeff, and you must make allowance.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do, sweetheart. And I know how you&#8217;re troubled, and all that, but don&#8217;t say  such dreadful things. I know you don&#8217;t mean them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  I don&#8217;t&#8212;at least, I don&#8217;t think I do. But I won&#8217;t say them any more. I think I  lost my head&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Forget  it. You&#8217;re upset and nervous and your mother&#8217;s worry reflects itself on you. Is  there really a bugler tradition?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  over here. There was one connected with mother&#8217;s family long ago, in England, I  believe. Of course, it was just one of those old spook yarns that most old  houses have over there. But mother always remembered it. She has told everybody  who ever visited here about it, and I think she always expected to hear the  thing. Queer, though, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  very. It&#8217;s explainable by natural means, of course. Probably we&#8217;ll never know  who it was, but it was no phantom, be sure of that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  well, it doesn&#8217;t matter, except that it has upset mother so dreadfully. But she&#8217;ll  get over it&#8212;if nothing happens.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing  will happen&#8212;if by that you mean a death in the family. More likely a marriage  will take place!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  ours, Jeff. I think that bugler sounded the death-knell of our hopes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maida!  What is the matter with you? Why are you talking like that? I know you&#8217;ve  something on your mind that you haven&#8217;t told me yet. Something pretty serious,  for it makes you say the strangest things! Tell me, darling, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t, Jeff. I mean, there isn&#8217;t anything. Wait till those people come back  again. You&#8217;ll be here, won&#8217;t you? They&#8217;re coming to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  bet I will! I&#8217;ll see what I can do with old curmudgeon. You know I&#8217;m argumentative.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  won&#8217;t do any good with Appleby. What he wants is help from dad. If he doesn&#8217;t  get that, he&#8217;ll punish us all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  he can&#8217;t get that, for your dad won&#8217;t give it. So it looks as if we must all  take our punishment. Well, we&#8217;re prepared.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  wouldn&#8217;t speak so lightly if you knew everything!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  why I ask you to tell me everything. Do, Maida, I&#8217;m sure I can help you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wait  till they come,&#8221; was all Maida would say in response to his repeated requests.</p>
  <p>And  at last they came.</p>
  <p>Smiling  and hearty, Samuel Appleby rentered the Wheeler home, apparently as  self-assured and hopeful as when he left it.</p>
  <p>Keefe  was courteous and polite as always and Genevieve Lane was prettier than ever by  reason of some new Boston-bought clothes.</p>
  <p>Allen  was introduced to the newcomers and sized up by one glance of Samuel Appleby&#8217;s  keen eyes. Privately he decided that this young man was a very formidable rival  of his son. But he greeted Allen with great cordiality, which Jeff thought it  best to return, although he felt an instinctive dislike for the man&#8217;s  personality.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come  along with me, Maida,&#8221; and with daring familiarity, Genevieve put her hand  through Maida&#8217;s arm and drew her toward the stairs. &#8220;I have the same room, I s&#8217;pose,&#8221;  she babbled on; &#8220;I&#8217;ve lots of new things I want to show you. And,&#8221; she added as  they entered the room, and she closed the door, &#8220;I want a talkfest with you  before the others begin.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  about?&#8221; asked Maida, feeling the subject would be one of importance.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  it&#8217;s just this. And don&#8217;t be too shocked if I speak right out in meetin&#8217;. I&#8217;ve  determined to marry into this bunch that I&#8217;m working for.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Have  you?&#8221; laughed Maida. &#8220;Are they equally determined?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  not joking&#8212;I&#8217;m in dead earnest. A poor girl has got to do the best she can for  herself in this cold world. Well, I&#8217;m going to corral one of the three: old man  Appleby, young man Appleby, or Curt Keefe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Which  one, for choice?&#8221; Maida still spoke lightly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m in earnest, but I am. Well, I&#8217;d rather have young Sam. Next, I&#8217;d  choose his father; and, lastly, I&#8217;m pretty sure I could nail Curtie Keefe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maida  couldn&#8217;t help her disapproval showing in her face, but she said: &#8220;It isn&#8217;t just  the way I&#8217;d go about selecting a husband, but if it&#8217;s your way, all right. Can  I help you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  you mean that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  yes, if I can do anything practical.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  you can! It&#8217;s only to keep off the grass, regarding young Sam.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  mean not to try to charm him myself?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  about that. And I&#8217;ll tell you why I say this. It seems old Appleby has about  made up his mind that you&#8217;re the right and proper mate for young Appleby. Oh,  you needn&#8217;t draw yourself up in that haughty fashion&#8212;he&#8217;s good enough for you,  Miss!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  didn&#8217;t say he wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; and Maida laughed in spite of herself at Genevieve&#8217;s  manner. &#8220;But, truly, I don&#8217;t want him. You see I&#8217;m engaged to Mr. Allen.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know it, but that cuts no ice with Pa Appleby. He plans to oust Mr. Allen and  put his son in his place.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  he does, does he?&#8221; Maida&#8217;s heart sank, for she had anticipated something like  this. &#8220;Am I to be consulted?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  look here, Maida Wheeler. You needn&#8217;t take that attitude, for it won&#8217;t get you  anywhere. You don&#8217;t know Mr. Appleby as I do. What he says goes&#8212;<i>goes</i>, understand?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maida  went white. &#8220;But such a thing as you speak of won&#8217;t go!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  not sure it won&#8217;t, if he so ordains it,&#8221; Miss Lane said, gravely. &#8220;But I just  wanted your assurance that you don&#8217;t hanker after Sammy-boy, so I can go ahead  and annex him myself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  defiance of Mr. Appleby&#8217;s intents?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  may be able to circumvent him. I&#8217;m some little schemer myself. And he may die.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yep.  He has an unsatisfactory heart, and it may go back on him at any minute.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  a thing to bank on!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  may happen all the same. But I&#8217;ve other irons in the fire. Run along, now; I&#8217;ve  work to do. You&#8217;re a dear girl, Maida, and the time may come when I can help  you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  round, rosy-cheeked face looked very serious, and Maida said, gratefully: &#8220;I  may be very glad of such help, Genevieve.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Then  she went away.</p>
  <p>Samuel  Appleby was lying in wait for her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Here  you are, my girl,&#8221; he said, as she came downstairs. &#8220;Come for a ramble with me,  won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>And,  knowing that the encounter was inevitable, Maida went.</p>
  <p>Appleby  wasted no time in preliminaries.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  got to go home to-morrow morning,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to have this matter of  your father&#8217;s help in the campaign settled before I go.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  thought it was settled,&#8221; returned Maida, calmly. &#8220;You know he will never give  you the help you ask. And oh, please, Mr. Appleby, won&#8217;t you give up the  question? You have ruined my father&#8217;s life&#8212;all our lives; won&#8217;t you cease  bothering him, and, whether you let him get his full pardon or not, won&#8217;t you  stop trying to coerce his will?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  I will not. You are very pleading and persuasive, my girl, but I have my own ax  to grind. Now, here&#8217;s a proposition. If you&#8212;I&#8217;ll speak plainly&#8212;if you will  consent to marry my son, I&#8217;ll get your father&#8217;s full pardon, and I&#8217;ll not ask  for his campaign support.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maida  gasped. All her troubles removed at once&#8212;but at such a price! She thought of  Allen, and a great wave of love surged over her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I can&#8217;t&#8212;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; she moaned. &#8220;What <i>are</i> you, Mr. Appleby? I love my chosen mate, my <i>fianc</i>,  Jeffrey Allen. Would you ask me to give him up and marry your son, whom I  esteem highly, but do not love?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Certainly;  I ask just that. You are free to say yes or no!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,  I say no. There <i>must</i> be some other  way! Give me some other chance, even though it be a harder one!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, I will.&#8221; Mr. Appleby&#8217;s face was hard now, his lips set in a straight  line; he was about to play his last card. &#8220;All right, I will. Here it is. The  other heir, of whom I spoke to you the other day, is Curtis Keefe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Keefe!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;but  wait&#8212;he doesn&#8217;t know it. I hit upon a clue in his chance reference to his  mother&#8217;s family, and unknown to him I investigated genealogies and all that,  and it is positive, he is the heir to all this estate, and not your mother.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  sure?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  absolutely certain. But, remember, he doesn&#8217;t know it. He has no idea of such a  thing. Now, if you&#8217;ll marry Sam, Keefe shall <i>never</i> know. I&#8217;ll burn all the papers that I have in evidence. You  and I will forget the secret, and your father and mother can rest in  undisturbed possession here for the rest of their lives.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you wouldn&#8217;t insist on father&#8217;s campaign work?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  you marry my son, I rather think your father will lend his aid&#8212;at least in some  few matters, without urging. But he shall not be urged beyond his wishes, rest  assured of that. In a word, Maida, all that you want or desire shall be yours  except your choice of a husband. And I&#8217;ll wager that inside of a year, you&#8217;ll  be wondering what you ever saw in young Allen, and rejoicing that you are the  wife of the governor instead!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t do it&#8212;oh, I <i>can&#8217;t!</i> And, then,  too, there&#8217;s Mr. Keefe&#8212;and the heirship!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Keefe and the airship!&#8221; exclaimed Curtis Keefe himself, as he came round the  corner and met them face to face. &#8220;Am I to go up in an airship? And when?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Appleby  flashed a quick glance at Maida, which she rightly interpreted to mean to let  Keefe rest unenlightened as to his error.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  not the Mr. Keefe we meant,&#8221; said Appleby, smiling at his secretary. &#8220;There are  others.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  then Appleby walked away, feeling his best plan was to let Maida think things  over.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  Keefe is going up in an airship?&#8221; Curt insisted, his curiosity aroused.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Maida, listlessly. &#8220;Mr. Appleby was telling me some airship  yarn. I didn&#8217;t half listen. I&#8212;I can&#8217;t bear that man!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t blame you for that, Miss Wheeler. But we&#8217;re going away to-morrow, and he&#8217;ll  be out of your way.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  he has me in a trap. He has arranged it so&#8212;oh, what am I saying!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  go on, if you feel you might regret it. Of course, as Mr. Appleby&#8217;s  confidential secretary, I know most of his affairs. May I say that I&#8217;m very  sorry for you, and may I offer my help, if you can use me in any way?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  kind you are, Mr. Keefe. But if you know the details of the matter, you know  that I am in a fearful dilemma. Oh, if only that man were out of existence!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Miss Wheeler,&#8221; and Keefe looked undisguisedly shocked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t mean anything wrong,&#8221; Maida&#8217;s eyes were piteous, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t know what  to do! I&#8217;ve no one to confide in&#8212;no way to turn for help&#8212;for advice&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  Miss Wheeler, you have parents, friends&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  one that I can speak to! Forgive me, Mr. Keefe, but I am nearly out of my mind.  Forgive me, if I ask you to leave me&#8212;will you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course, you poor child! I ought to have sensed that I was intruding!&#8221;</p>
  <p>With  a courteous bow, he walked away, leaving Maida alone on the seat beneath the  old sycamore.</p>
  <p>She  thought long and deeply. She seemed to grow older and more matured of judgment  as she dealt with the big questions in her mind.</p>
  <p>After  a long time she came to her decision. Torn and wracked with emotions, she  bravely faced the many-sided situation, and made up her mind. Then she got up  and walked into the house.</p>
  <p>That  afternoon, about five o&#8217;clock, Appleby and Wheeler sat in the latter&#8217;s den,  talking over the same old subject. Maida, hidden in the window-seat, was  listening. They did not know she was there, but they would not have cared. They  talked of nothing she did not already know.</p>
  <p>Appleby  grew angry and Wheeler grew angry. The talk was coming to a climax, both men  were holding on to their tempers, but it was clear one or the other must give  way soon.</p>
  <p>Jeffrey  Allen, about to go in search of Maida, saw a wisp of smoke curling from the  garage, which from his seat on the north veranda was in plain view.</p>
  <p>He  ran toward the smoke, shouting &#8220;Fire!&#8221; as he ran, and in a few minutes the  garage was ablaze. The servants gathered about, Mrs. Wheeler looked from her  bedroom window, and Keefe joined Allen in attempts to subdue the flames.</p>
  <p>And  with the efficient help of two chauffeurs and other willing workers the fire  was soon reduced to a smouldering heap of ashes.</p>
  <p>Allen  ran, then, to the den, to tell them there that the danger was past.</p>
  <p>He  entered to see Samuel Appleby dead in his chair, with a bullet through his  heart. Daniel Wheeler stood beside him, gazing distractedly at the dead man.  Maida, white and trembling, was half hidden as she stood just inside the  curtains of the window.</p>
  <p>Not  realizing that there was no hope of life, Allen shouted for help, and tore open  Appleby&#8217;s coat to feel his heart.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s  quite dead,&#8221; he said, in an awe-stricken tone. &#8220;But, we must get a doctor at  once!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  telephone,&#8221; spoke up Genevieve&#8217;s quiet voice, and with her usual efficiency,  she found the number and called the doctor.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now  the police?&#8221; she went on, as if such matters belonged to her province.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221;  said Curtis Keefe, who stood by his late employer, taking charge, by common  consent.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  killed him?&#8221; said Genevieve, in a hushed tone, as she left the telephone.</p>
  <p>All  looked from one to another, but nobody replied.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Wheeler came to the doorway.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  knew it!&#8221; she cried; &#8220;the phantom bugler!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  the phantom bugler didn&#8217;t kill him,&#8221; said Genevieve, &#8220;and we must find out who  did!&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore7"></a>Chapter 7 <br>
Inquiries</b></h2>
  <p>Late  the same evening the Wheeler family and their guests were gathered in the  living-room. Much had been done in the past few hours. The family doctor had  been there, the medical examiner had been called and had given his report, and  the police had come and were still present.</p>
  <p>Samuel  Appleby, junior&#8212;though no longer to be called by that designation&#8212;was expected  at any moment.</p>
  <p>Two  detectives were there, but one, Hallen by name, said almost nothing, seeming  content to listen, while his colleague conducted the questioning of the  household.</p>
  <p>Burdon,  the talkative one, was a quick-thinking, clear-headed chap, decided of manner  and short of speech.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  look here,&#8221; he was saying, &#8220;this was an inside job, of course. Might have been  one of the servants, or might have been any of you folks. How many of you are  ready to help me in my investigations by telling all you know?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  thought we had to do that, whether we&#8217;re ready to or not,&#8221; spoke up Genevieve,  who was not at all abashed by the presence of the authorities. &#8220;Of course, we&#8217;ll  all tell all we know&#8212;we want to find the murderer just as much as you do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Keefe  looked at her with a slight frown of reproof, but said nothing. The others paid  no attention to the girl&#8217;s rather forward speech.</p>
  <p>In  fact, everybody seemed dazed and dumb. The thing was so sudden and so awful&#8212;the  possibilities so many and so terrible&#8212;that each was aghast at the situation.</p>
  <p>The  three Wheelers said nothing. Now and then they looked at one another, but  quickly looked away, and preserved their unbroken silence.</p>
  <p>Jeffrey  Allen became the spokesman for them. It seemed inevitable&#8212;for some one must  answer the first leading questions; and though Curtis Keefe and Miss Lane were  in Appleby&#8217;s employ, the detective seemed more concerned with the Wheeler  family.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Bad  blood, wasn&#8217;t there, between Mr. Appleby and Mr. Wheeler?&#8221; Burdon inquired.</p>
  <p>&#8220;They  had not been friends for years,&#8221; Allen replied, straightforwardly, for he felt  sure there was nothing to be gained by misrepresentation.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Huh!  What was the trouble, Mr. Wheeler?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Daniel  Wheeler gave a start. Then, pulling himself together, he answered slowly: &#8220;The  trouble was that Mr. Appleby and myself belonged to different political  parties, and when I opposed his election as governor, he resented it, and a  mutual enmity followed which lasted ever since.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did  you kill Mr. Appleby?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Wheeler  looked at his questioner steadily, and replied: &#8220;I have nothing to say.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  all right, you don&#8217;t have to incriminate yourself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  didn&#8217;t kill him!&#8221; cried Maida, unable to keep still. &#8220;I was there, in the  room&#8212;I could see that he didn&#8217;t kill him!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  did then?&#8221; and the detective turned to her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8212;I  don&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t see who did it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Are  you sure, Miss? Better tell the truth.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  tell you I didn&#8217;t see&#8212;I didn&#8217;t see anything! I had heard an alarm of fire, and  I was wondering where it was.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  didn&#8217;t get up and go to find out?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No&#8212;no,  I stayed where I was.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  were you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  the window-seat&#8212;in the den.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Meaning  the room where the shooting occurred?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.  My father&#8217;s study.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  from where you sat, you could see the whole affair?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  might have&#8212;if I had looked&#8212;but I didn&#8217;t. I was reading.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thought  you were wondering about the fire?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  Maida was quite composed now. &#8220;I raised my eyes from my book when I heard the  fire excitement.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  sort of excitement?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  heard people shouting, and I heard men running. I was just about to go out  toward the north veranda, where the sounds came from, when I&#8212; I can&#8217;t go on!&#8221;  and Maida broke down and wept.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  must tell your story&#8212;maybe it&#8217;d be easier now than later. Can&#8217;t you go on, Miss  Wheeler?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s  little to tell. I saw Mr. Appleby fall over sideways&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t  you hear the shot?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No&#8212;yes&#8212;I  don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Maida looked at her father, as if to gain help from his  expression, but his face showed only agonized concern for her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Dear  child,&#8221; he said, &#8220;tell the truth. Tell just what you saw&#8212;or heard.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  didn&#8217;t hear anything&#8212;I mean the noise from the people running to the fire so  distracted my attention, I heard no shot or any sound in the room. I just saw  Mr. Appleby fall over&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  not giving us a straight story, Miss Wheeler,&#8221; said the detective, bluntly. &#8220;Seems  to me you&#8217;d better begin all over.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Seems  to me you&#8217;d better cease questioning Miss Wheeler,&#8221; said Curtis Keefe, looking  sympathetically at Maida; &#8220;she&#8217;s just about all in, and I think she&#8217;s entitled  to some consideration.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;H&#8217;m.  Pretty hard to find the right one to question. Mrs. Wheeler, now&#8212;I&#8217;d rather not  trouble her too much.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Talk  to me,&#8221; said Allen. &#8220;I can tell you the facts, and you can draw your deductions  afterward.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Me,  too,&#8221; said Keefe. &#8220;Ask us the hard questions, and then when you need to,  inquire of the Wheelers. Remember, they&#8217;re under great nervous strain.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  then,&#8221; Burdon seemed willing to take the advice, &#8220;you start in, Mr. Keefe. You&#8217;re  Mr. Appleby&#8217;s secretary, I believe?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  we were on our way back to his home in Stockfield&#8212;we expected to go there  to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  got any theory of the shooting?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  nothing to found a theory on. I was out at the garage helping to put out a  small fire that had started there.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How&#8217;d  it start?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know. In the excitement that followed, I never thought to inquire.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell  your story of the excitement.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  was at the garage with Mr. Allen, and two chauffeurs&#8212;the Wheelers&#8217; man and Mr.  Appleby&#8217;s man. Together, and with the help of a gardener or two, we put the  fire out. Then Mr. Allen said: &#8216;Let&#8217;s go to the house and tell them there&#8217;s no  danger. They may be worried.&#8217; Mr. Allen started off and I followed. He preceded  me into the den&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  you tell what you saw there, Mr. Allen.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  saw, first of all,&#8221; began Jeffrey, &#8220;the figure of Mr. Appleby sitting in a  chair, near the middle of the room. His head hung forward limply, and his whole  attitude was unnatural. The thought flashed through my mind that he had had a  stroke of some sort, and I went to him&#8212;and I saw he was dead.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  knew that at once?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  judged so, from the look on his face and the helpless attitude. Then I felt for  his heart and found it was still.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  a doctor?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  but I&#8217;ve had enough experience to know when a man is dead.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right. What was Mr. Wheeler doing?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing.  He stood on the other side of the room, gazing at his old friend.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  Miss Wheeler?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She,  too, was looking at the scene. She stood in the bay window.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  see. Now, Mr. Keefe, I believe you followed close on Mr. Allen&#8217;s heels. Did you  see the place&#8212;much as he has described it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;&#8221;  Keefe looked thoughtful. &#8220;Yes, I think I can corroborate every word of his  description.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right. Now, Miss Lane, where were you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  was at the fire. I followed the two men in, and I saw the same situation they  have told you of.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Genevieve&#8217;s  quiet, composed air was a relief after the somewhat excited utterances of the  others.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  did you do?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am accustomed to wait on Mr. Appleby, and it seemed quite within my province  that I should telephone for help for him. I called the doctor&#8212;and then I called  the police station.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  don&#8217;t think you took a great deal on yourself?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Genevieve  stared at him. &#8220;I do not think so. I only think that I did my duty as I saw it,  and in similar circumstances I should do the same again.&#8221;</p>
  <p>At  this point the other detective was heard from.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  would like to ask,&#8221; Hallen said, &#8220;what Mrs. Wheeler meant by crying out that it  was the work of a &#8216;phantom burglar&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  burglar&#8212;bugler,&#8221; said Mrs. Wheeler, suddenly alert.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Bugler!&#8221;  Hallen stared. &#8220;Please explain, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  is a tradition in my family,&#8221; Mrs. Wheeler said, in a slow, sad voice, &#8220;that  when a member of the family is about to die, a phantom bugler makes an  appearance and sounds &#8216;taps&#8217; on his bugle. This phenomenon occurred last night.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no! Spooks! But Mr. Appleby is not a member of your family.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  but he was under our roof. And so I know the warning was meant for him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  well, we can&#8217;t waste time on such rubbish,&#8221; interposed Burdon, &#8220;the bugle call  had nothing to do with the case.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  do you explain it, then?&#8221; asked Mrs. Wheeler. &#8220;We all heard it, and there&#8217;s no  bugler about here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Cut  it out,&#8221; ordered Burdon. &#8220;Take up the bugler business some other time, if you  like&#8212;but we must get down to brass tacks now.&#8221;</p>
  <p>His  proceedings were interrupted, however, by the arrival of young Samuel Appleby.</p>
  <p>The  big man came in and a sudden hush fell upon the group.</p>
  <p>Daniel  Wheeler rose&#8212;and put out a tentative hand, then half withdrew it as if he  feared it would not be accepted.</p>
  <p>Hallen  watched this closely. He strongly suspected Wheeler was the murderer, but he  had no intention of getting himself in bad by jumping at the conclusion.</p>
  <p>However,  Appleby grasped the hand of his host as if he had no reason for not doing so.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  sorry, sir, you should have had this tragedy beneath your roof,&#8221; he said.</p>
  <p>Hallen  listened curiously. It was strange he should adopt an apologetic tone, as if  Wheeler had been imposed upon.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Our  sorrow is all for you, Sam,&#8221; Dan Wheeler returned, and then as Appleby passed  on to greet Maida and her mother, Wheeler sank back in his chair and was again  lost in thought.</p>
  <p>The  whole scene was one of constraint. Appleby merely nodded to Genevieve, and  spoke a few words to Keefe, and then asked to see his father.</p>
  <p>On  his return to the living-room, he had a slightly different air. He was a little  more dictatorial, more ready to advise what to do.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  circumstances are distressing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I know, Mr. Wheeler, you will  agree with me that we should take my father back to his home as soon as  possible.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  will be done to-morrow morning&#8212;as soon as the necessary formalities can be  attended to. Now, anything I can do for you people, must be done to-night.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  can do a lot,&#8221; said Burdon. &#8220;You can help us pick out the murderer&#8212;for, I take  it, you want justice done?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;yes,  of course.&#8221; Appleby looked surprised. &#8220;Of course I want this deed avenged. But  I can&#8217;t help in the matter. I understand you suspect some one of the&#8212;the  household. Now, I shall never be willing to accuse any one of this deed. If it  can be proved the work of an outsider&#8212;a burglar or highwayman&#8212;or intruder of  any sort, I am ready to prosecute&#8212;but if suspicion rests on&#8212;on anyone I know&#8212;I  shall keep out of it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  can&#8217;t do that, Mr. Appleby,&#8221; said Hallen; &#8220;you&#8217;ve got to tell all you know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I don&#8217;t know anything! I wasn&#8217;t here!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  know about motives,&#8221; Hallen said, doggedly. &#8220;Tell us now, who bore your father  any ill-will, and also had opportunity to do the shooting?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  shan&#8217;t pretend I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re driving at,&#8221; and Appleby spoke sternly,  &#8220;but I&#8217;ve no idea that Mr. Daniel Wheeler did this deed. I know he and my  father were not on friendly terms, but you need more evidence than that to accuse  a man of murder.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll  look after the evidence,&#8221; Hallen assured him. &#8220;All you need tell about is the  enmity between the two men.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;An  enmity of fifteen years&#8217; standing,&#8221; Appleby said, slowly, &#8220;is not apt to break  out in sudden flame of crime. I am not a judge nor am I a detective, but until  Mr. Wheeler himself confesses to the deed, I shall never believe he shot my  father.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Wheeler  looked at the speaker in a sort of dumb wonder.</p>
  <p>Maida  gazed at him with eyes full of thankfulness, and the others were deeply  impressed by the just, even noble, attitude of the son of the victim of the  tragedy.</p>
  <p>But  Hallen mused over this thing. He wondered why Appleby took such an unusual  stand, and decided there was something back of it about which he knew nothing  as yet. And he determined to find out.</p>
  <p>&#8220;We  can get in touch with you at any time, Mr. Appleby?&#8221; he asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, of course. After a few days&#8212;after my father&#8217;s funeral, I will be at your  disposal. But as I&#8217;ve said, I know nothing that would be of any use as evidence.  Do you need to keep Mr. Keefe and Miss Lane for any reason?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; the detective said. &#8220;Not longer than to-morrow, anyhow. I&#8217;ll  take their depositions, but they have little testimony to give. However, you&#8217;re  none of you very far away.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  you can always get us at Stockfield. Mr. Keefe will probably be willing to stay  on and settle up my father&#8217;s affairs, and I know we shall be glad of Miss Lane&#8217;s  services for a time.&#8221; Appleby glanced at the two as he spoke, and they nodded.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  we&#8217;re going to stay right here,&#8221; and Burdon spoke decidedly. &#8220;Whatever the  truth of the matter may be, it&#8217;s clear to be seen that suspicion must naturally  point toward the Wheeler family, or some intruder. Though how an intruder could  get in the room, unseen by either Mr. Wheeler or his daughter, is pretty  inexplicable. But those things we&#8217;re here to find out. And we&#8217;ll do it, Mr.  Appleby. I&#8217;m taking it for granted you want the criminal found?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh&#8212;I  say, Mr.&#8212;er&#8212;Burdon, have a little common decency! Don&#8217;t come at me with  questions of that sort, when I&#8217;m just about knocked out with this whole fearful  occurrence! Have a heart, man, give me time to realize my loss, before you talk  to me of avenging it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  right,&#8221; said Curt Keefe. &#8220;I think Mr. Appleby deserves more consideration.  Suppose we excuse him for the night.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Somewhat  reluctantly the detective was brought to consent, and then Daniel Wheeler asked  that he and his wife and daughter also be excused from further grilling that  night.</p>
  <p>&#8220;We&#8217;re  not going to run away,&#8221; he said, pathetically. &#8220;We&#8217;ll meet you in the morning,  Mr. Burdon, but please realize our stunned condition at present.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;My  mother must be excused,&#8221; Maida put in. &#8220;I am sure she can stand no more,&#8221; and  with a solicitous care, she assisted Mrs. Wheeler to rise from her chair.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I am ill,&#8221; the elder woman said, and so white and weak did she look that no one  could doubt her word.</p>
  <p>The  three Wheelers went to their room, and Genevieve Lane went off with them,  leaving Allen and Keefe, with Sam Appleby, to face the two detectives&#8217; fire of  questions.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  vamoose, too, Sam,&#8221; Keefe advised. &#8220;There&#8217;s no use in your staying here and  listening to harrowing details. Mr. Allen and I will have a talk with the  detectives, and you can talk to-morrow morning, if you wish.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right,&#8221; and Appleby rose. &#8220;But, look here, Keefe. I loved and respected my  father, and I revere his memory&#8212;and, yes, I want justice done&#8212;of course, but,  all the same, if Wheeler shot dad, I don&#8217;t want that poor old chap prosecuted.  You know, I never fully sympathized with father&#8217;s treatment of him, and I&#8217;d  like to make amends to Wheeler by giving him the benefit of the doubt&#8212;if it can  be done.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  can&#8217;t be done!&#8221; declared Burdon, unwilling to agree to this heresy. &#8220;The law  can&#8217;t be set aside by personal sympathy, Mr. Appleby!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  I only said, if it can be,&#8221; and the man wearily turned and left the room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  then,&#8221; said Keefe, &#8220;let&#8217;s talk this thing out. I know your position, Allen, and  I&#8217;m sorry for you. And I want to say, right now, if I can help in any way, I  will. I like the Wheelers, and I must say I subscribe to the ideas of Sam  Appleby. But all that&#8217;s up to the detectives. I&#8217;ve got to go away to-morrow, so  I&#8217;m going to ask you, Mr. Burdon, to get through with me to-night. I&#8217;ve lots to  do at the other end of the route, and I must get busy. But I do want to help  here, too. So, at any rate, fire your questions at me&#8212;that is, if you know what  you want to ask.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  ask one, right off, Mr. Keefe,&#8221; and Hallen spoke mildly but straightforwardly. &#8220;Can  you give me any fact or suggest to me any theory that points toward any one but  Mr. Daniel Wheeler as the murderer of Samuel Appleby?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Curtis  Keefe was dismayed. What could he reply to this very definite question? A  negative answer implicated Wheeler at once&#8212;while a &#8220;yes,&#8221; would necessitate the  disclosure of another suspect. And Keefe was not blind to the fact that Hallen&#8217;s  eyes had strayed more than once toward Maida Wheeler with a curious glance.</p>
  <p>Quickly  making up his mind, Keefe returned: &#8220;No fact, but a theory based on my  disbelief in Mr. Wheeler&#8217;s guilt, and implying the intrusion of some  murderous-minded person.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Meaning  some marauder?&#8221; Hallen looked disdainful.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Some  intruder,&#8221; Keefe said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know who, or for what reason, but I don&#8217;t think  it fair to accuse Mr. Wheeler without investigating every possible alternative.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  are several alternatives,&#8221; Burdon declared; &#8220;I may as well say right out, that  I&#8217;ve no more definite suspicion of Mr. Wheeler than I have of Mrs. Wheeler or  Miss Wheeler.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What!&#8221;  and Jeffrey Allen looked almost murderous himself.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  get excited, sir. It&#8217;s my business to suspect. Suspicion is not accusation. You  must admit all three of the Wheeler family had a motive. That is, they would,  one and all, have been glad to be released from the thrall in which Mr. Appleby  held them. And no one else present had a motive! I might suspect you, Mr.  Allen, but that you were at the fire at the time, according to the direct  testimony of Mr. Keefe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, we were at the fire, all right,&#8221; Allen agreed, &#8220;and I&#8217;d knock you down for  saying to me what you did, only you are justified. I would far rather be  suspected of the murder of Mr. Appleby than to have any of the Wheelers  suspected. But owing to Keefe&#8217;s being an eye-witness of me at the time, I can&#8217;t  falsify about it. However, you may set it right down that none of the three  Wheelers did do it, and I&#8217;ll prove it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go  to it, Allen,&#8221; Keefe cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ll help.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  two loyal friends of the Wheeler family,&#8221; said Hallen in his quiet way, &#8220;but  you can&#8217;t put anything over. There&#8217;s no way out. I know all about the governor&#8217;s  pardon and all that. I know the feud between the two men was beyond all hope of  patching up. And I know that to-night had brought about a climax that had to  result in tragedy. If Wheeler hadn&#8217;t killed Appleby&#8212;Appleby would have killed  Wheeler.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Self-defence?&#8221;  asked Allen.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir, not that. But one or the other had to be out of the running. I know the  whole story, and I know what men will do in a political crisis that they wouldn&#8217;t  dream of at any other time. Wheeler&#8217;s the guilty party&#8212;unless&#8212;well, unless that  daughter of his&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221;  cried Allen. &#8220;I won&#8217;t stand for it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  only meant that the girl&#8217;s great love and loyalty to her father might have made  her lose her head&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  she didn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; said Allen, more quietly. &#8220;Oh, I say, man, let&#8217;s try to find  this intruder that Mr. Keefe has&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Has  invented!&#8221; put in Burdon. &#8220;No, gentlemen, they ain&#8217;t no such animile! Now, you  tell me over again, while I take it down, just what you two saw when you came  to the door of that den, as they call it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  so Allen and Keefe reluctantly, but truthfully, again detailed the scene that  met their eyes as they returned from the fire they had put out.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  case is only too plain,&#8221; declared Burdon, as he snapped a rubber band over his  notebook. &#8220;Sorry, gentlemen, but your story leaves no loophole for any other  suspect than one of the three Wheelers. Good-night.&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore8"></a>Chapter 8 <br>
Confession</b></h2>
  <p>Before  Sam Appleby left the next morning, he confided to Keefe that he had little if  any faith in the detective prowess of the two men investigating the case.</p>
  <p>&#8220;When  I come back,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I may bring a real detective, and&#8212;I may not. I want to  think this thing over first&#8212;and, though I may be a queer Dick, I&#8217;m not sure I  want the slayer of my father found.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  see,&#8221; and Keefe nodded his head understandingly.</p>
  <p>But  Jeffrey Allen demurred. &#8220;You say that, Mr. Appleby, because you think one of  the Wheeler family is the guilty party. But I know better. I know them so well&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  as well as I do,&#8221; interrupted Appleby, &#8220;and neither do you know all the points  of the feud that has festered for so many years. If you&#8217;ll take my advice, Mr.  Allen, you&#8217;ll delay action until my return, at least.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  detectives won&#8217;t do that,&#8221; objected Jeffrey.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  detectives will run round in circles and get nowhere,&#8221; scoffed Appleby. &#8220;I  shall be back as soon as possible, and I don&#8217;t mind telling you now that there  will be no election campaign for me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What!&#8221;  exclaimed Curtis Keefe. &#8220;You&#8217;re out of the running?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Positively!  I may take it up again some other year, but this campaign will not include my  name.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;My  gracious!&#8221; exclaimed Genevieve, who knew a great deal about current politics. &#8220;Who&#8217;ll  take your place?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  dark horse, likely,&#8221; returned Appleby, speaking in an absorbed, preoccupied  manner, as if caring little who fell heir to his candidacy.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t agree with you, Mr. Appleby,&#8221; spoke up Jeff Allen, &#8220;as to the inefficiency  of the two men on this case. Seems to me they&#8217;re doing all they can, and I can&#8217;t  help thinking they may get at the truth.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, if they get at the truth, but it&#8217;s my opinion that the truth of this  matter is not going to be so easily discovered, and those two bunglers may do a  great deal of harm. Good-bye, Maida, keep up a good heart, my girl.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  group on the veranda said good-bye to Sam Appleby, and he turned back as he  stepped into the car to say:</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  be back as soon as the funeral is over, and until then, be careful what you  say&#8212;all of you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He  looked seriously at Maida, but his glance turned toward the den where Mr.  Wheeler sat in solitude.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  heard him,&#8221; stormed Burdon, as the car drove away, and the detective came  around the corner of the veranda. &#8220;I heard what he said about me and Hallen.  Well, we&#8217;ll show him! Of course, the reason he talks like that&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  tell us the reason just now,&#8221; interrupted Keefe. &#8220;We men will have a little  session of our own, without the ladies present. There&#8217;s no call for their  participation in our talk.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  right,&#8221; said Allen. &#8220;Maida, you and Miss Lane run away, and we&#8217;ll go to the den  for a chat.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  not there,&#8221; objected Burdon. &#8220;Come over and sit under the big sycamore.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  so, beneath the historic tree, the three men sat down for a serious talk. Hallen  soon joined them, but he said little.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  leaving myself, soon after noon,&#8221; said Keefe. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back in a day or two,  but there are matters of importance connected with Mr. Appleby&#8217;s estate that  must be looked after.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  should think there must be!&#8221; exclaimed Burdon. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you can leave  to come back very soon.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Keefe  reddened slightly, for the real reason for his intended return was centred in  Maida Wheeler&#8217;s charm, to which he had incontinently succumbed. He knew Allen  was her suitor, but his nature was such that he believed in his own powers of  persuasion to induce the girl to transfer her affections to his more desirable  self.</p>
  <p>But  he only looked thoughtfully at Burdon and said: &#8220;There are matters here, also,  that require attention in Mr. Appleby&#8217;s interests.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,&#8221;  Burdon went on, &#8220;as to the murder, there&#8217;s no doubt that it was the work of one  of the three Wheelers. Nobody else had any reason to wish old Appleby out of  the world.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  forget me,&#8221; said Allen, in a tense voice. &#8220;My interests are one with the  Wheelers. If they had such a motive as you ascribe to them&#8212;I had the same.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  waste time in such talk,&#8221; said Curt Keefe. &#8220;I saw you, Allen, at the fire  during the whole time that covered the opportunity for the murder.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course,&#8221; agreed Burdon, &#8220;I&#8217;ve looked into all that. And so, as I say, it must  have been one member of the Wheeler family, for there&#8217;s no one else to suspect.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Including  Mrs. Wheeler,&#8221; quietly put in Hallen.</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  absurd!&#8221; flared out Allen. &#8220;It&#8217;s bad enough to suspect the other two, but to  think of Mrs. Wheeler is ridiculous!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  at all,&#8221; said Burdon, &#8220;she had the same motive&#8212;she had opportunity&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  do you know?&#8221; asked Keefe.</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  ran down from her room at that very moment,&#8221; stated Burdon. &#8220;I have the testimony  of one of the upstairs maids, and, also, I believe Miss Wheeler saw her mother  in the den.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Look  here,&#8221; said Hallen, in his slow, drawling tones, &#8220;let&#8217;s reconstruct the  situation. You two men were at the fire&#8212;that much is certain&#8212;so you can&#8217;t be  suspected. But all three of the Wheelers had absolute opportunity, and they had  motive. Now, as I look at it&#8212;one of those three was the criminal, and the other  two saw the deed. Wherefore, the two onlookers will do all they can to shield  the murderer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Keefe  stared at him. &#8220;You really believe that!&#8221; he said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sure  I do! Nobody else had either motive or opportunity. I don&#8217;t for one minute  believe in an outsider. Who could happen along at that particular moment, get  away with the shooting, and then get away himself?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  it could have been done,&#8221; mused Keefe, and Allen broke in eagerly:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course it could! There&#8217;s nothing to prove it impossible.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  two say that, because you want it to be that way,&#8221; said Burdon, smiling at the  two young men. &#8220;That&#8217;s all right&#8212;you&#8217;re both friends of the family, and can&#8217;t  bear to suspect any one of them. But facts remain. Now, let&#8217;s see which of the  three it most likely was.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  old man,&#8221; declared Hallen, promptly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221;  cried Allen. &#8220;Mr. Wheeler is incapable of a deed like that! Why, I&#8217;ve known him  for years&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  talk about incapable of anything!&#8221; said Burdon. &#8220;Most murderers are people whom  their friends consider &#8216;incapable of such a deed.&#8217; A man who is generally  adjudged &#8216;capable&#8217; of it is not found in polite society.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s  the weapon,&#8221; asked Keefe, abruptly, &#8220;if Mr. Wheeler did it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s  the weapon, whoever did it?&#8221; countered Burdon. &#8220;The weapon hasn&#8217;t been found,  though I&#8217;ve hunted hard. But that helps to prove it one of the family, for they  would know where to hide a revolver securely.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  it was Mr. Wheeler, he&#8217;d have to hide it in the den,&#8221; said Allen. &#8220;He never  goes over to the other side of the house, you know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  isn&#8217;t in the den,&#8221; Hallen spoke positively; &#8220;I hunted that myself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  seem sure of your statement,&#8221; said Keefe. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you have overlooked it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Positively  not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  he couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; concurred Burdon. &#8220;Hallen&#8217;s a wonderful hunter. If that revolver  had been hidden in the den, he&#8217;d have found it. That&#8217;s why I think it was Mrs.  Wheeler, and she took it back to her own rooms.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  not Mrs. Wheeler!&#8221; groaned Jeff Allen. &#8220;That dear, sweet woman couldn&#8217;t&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Incapable  of murder, I s&#8217;pose!&#8221; ironically said Burdon. &#8220;Let me tell you, sir, many a  time a dear, sweet woman has done extraordinary things for the sake of her  husband or children.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  what motive would Mrs. Wheeler have?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  same as the others. Appleby was a thorn in their flesh, an enemy of many years&#8217;  standing. And I&#8217;ve heard hints of another reason for the family&#8217;s hating him,  besides that conditional pardon business. But no matter about that now. What I  want is evidence against somebody&#8212;against one of three suspects. Until I get  some definite evidence I can&#8217;t tell which of the three is most likely the one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Seems  to me the fact that Mrs. Wheeler ran downstairs and back again is enough to  indicate some pretty close questioning of her,&#8221; suggested Hallen.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  please,&#8221; begged Allen, &#8220;she&#8217;s <i>so</i> upset and distracted&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course she is. But that&#8217;s the reason we must ask her about it now. When she  gets calmed down, and gets a fine yarn concocted, there&#8217;ll be small use asking  her anything!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;d  tackle the old man first,&#8221; said Hallen; &#8220;I think, on general principles, he&#8217;s  the one to make inquiries of before you go to the ladies. Let&#8217;s go to him now.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;&#8221;  proposed Burdon, &#8220;let&#8217;s send for him to come here. This is away from the house,  and we can talk more freely.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  go for him,&#8221; offered Allen, seeing they were determined to carry out their  plan.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  much!&#8221; said Burdon. &#8220;You&#8217;re just aching to put a flea in his ear! You go for  him, Hallen.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  detective went to the house, and returned with Daniel Wheeler at his side.</p>
  <p>The  suspected man stood straight and held himself fearlessly. Not an old man, he  was grayed with care and trouble, but this morning he seemed strong and alert  as any of them.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Put  your questions,&#8221; he said, briefly, as he seated himself on one of the many  seats beneath the old sycamore.</p>
  <p>&#8220;First  of all, who do you think killed Samuel Appleby?&#8221;</p>
  <p>This  question was shot at him by Burdon, and all waited in silence for the answer.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  killed him myself,&#8221; was the straightforward reply.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  settles it,&#8221; said Hallen, &#8220;it was one of the women.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  do you mean by that?&#8221; cried Wheeler, turning quickly toward the speaker.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  mean, that either your wife or daughter did the deed, and you are taking the  crime on yourself to save her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;&#8221;  reasserted Dan Wheeler, &#8220;you&#8217;re wrong. I killed Appleby for good and sufficient  reason. I&#8217;m not sorry, and I accept my fate.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wait  a minute,&#8221; said Hallen, as Keefe was about to protest; &#8220;where was your  daughter, Miss Maida, when you killed your man?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8212;I  don&#8217;t know. I think she had gone to the fire&#8212;which had just broken out.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  not sure&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  had been with you, in the den?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  I know. She had. She had been sitting in her favorite window-seat, in the large  bay, and was there while you and Mr. Appleby were talking together. Also, she  did not leave the room to go to the fire, for no one saw her anywhere near the  burning garage.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  to that, I can&#8217;t say,&#8221; went on Wheeler, slowly, &#8220;but she was not in the den, to  my knowledge, at the time of the shooting.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very  well, let that pass. Now, then, Mr. Wheeler, if you shot Mr. Appleby, what did  you afterward do with your revolver?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8212;I  don&#8217;t know.&#8221; The man&#8217;s face was convincing. His frank eyes testified to the  truth of his words. &#8220;I assure you, I don&#8217;t know. I was so&#8212;so bewildered&#8212;that I  must have dropped it&#8212;somewhere. I never thought of it again.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  if you had merely dropped it, it must have been found. And it hasn&#8217;t been.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Somebody  else found it and secreted it,&#8221; suggested Hallen. &#8220;Probably Mr. Wheeler&#8217;s wife  or daughter.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps  so,&#8221; assented Wheeler, calmly. &#8220;They might have thought to help me by secreting  it. Have you asked them?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  and they deny all knowledge of it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  do I. But surely it will be found.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  must be found. And, therefore, it is imperative that the rooms of the ladies as  well as your own rooms, sir, be thoroughly searched.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right&#8212;go ahead and search!&#8221; Wheeler spoke sharply. &#8220;I&#8217;ve confessed the crime,  now waste no time in useless chattering. Get the evidence, get the proofs, and  let the law take its course.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  will not leave the premises,&#8221; put in Hallen, and his tone was that of command  rather than inquiry.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  most certainly shall not,&#8221; declared Wheeler. &#8220;But I do ask you, gentlemen, to  trouble and annoy my wife and daughter as little as possible. Their grief is  sufficient reason for their being let alone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221;  grunted Burdon. &#8220;Well, sir, I can promise not to trouble the ladies more than  is necessary&#8212;but I can&#8217;t help feeling necessity will demand a great deal.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Wheeler was next interviewed, and the confab took place in her own sitting-room.</p>
  <p>None  of her family was allowed to be present, and the four men filed into the room  with various expressions of face. The two detectives were stolid-looking, but  eagerly determined to do their work, while Allen and Keefe were alertly  interested in finding out some way to be of help to Mrs. Wheeler.</p>
  <p>She  received the men quietly, even graciously, sensing what they had come for.</p>
  <p>&#8220;To  start with, Mrs. Wheeler,&#8221; said Burdon, frankly but not unkindly, &#8220;who do you  think killed Mr. Appleby?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh&#8212;I  don&#8217;t know&#8212;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she wailed, losing her calm and becoming greatly  agitated.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  were you when the shot was fired?&#8221; asked Hallen.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know&#8212;I didn&#8217;t hear it&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  you were up in your own room?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  suppose so&#8212;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  were up there when the fire broke out?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;I  think I was&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you must know, Mrs. Wheeler&#8212;that is, you must know where you were when you  first heard of the fire&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  yes; I was up in my bedroom.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  who told you of the fire?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;My  maid&#8212;Rachel.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  then what did you do?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8212;I&#8212;I  don&#8217;t remember.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  ran downstairs, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t remember&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  you did!&#8221; Burdon took up the reins. &#8220;You ran downstairs, and just as you got  down to the den you saw&#8212;you saw your husband shoot Mr. Appleby!&#8221;</p>
  <p>His  harsh manner, as he intended, frightened the nervous woman, and reduced her to  the verge of collapse.</p>
  <p>But  after a gasping moment, she recovered herself, and cried out: &#8220;I did not! I  shot Mr. Appleby myself. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so agitated.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  knew it!&#8221; exclaimed Burdon. &#8220;Mr. Wheeler&#8217;s confession was merely to save his  wife. Now, Mrs. Wheeler, I believe your story, and I want all the particulars.  First, why did you kill him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Be&#8212;because  he was my husband&#8217;s enemy&#8212;and I had stood it as long as I could.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;H&#8217;m.  And what did you do with the weapon you used?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  threw it out of the window.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  it dropped on the lawn?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  dropped; I threw it far out&#8212;as far as I could.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I see. Out of which window?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why&#8212;why,  the one in the den&#8212;the bay window.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  your daughter&#8212;Miss Maida&#8212;was sitting in the bay window.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  she was not,&#8221; Mrs. Wheeler spoke emphatically now. &#8220;She was not in the room at  all. She had gone to the fire.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  is that so? And then&#8212;what happened next?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why&#8212;nothing.  I&#8212;I ran upstairs again.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Appalled  at what you had done?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  appalled&#8212;so much as&#8212;as&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Unnerved?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  unnerved. I fell on my bed, and Rachel looked after me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah,  yes; we will interview Rachel, and so save you further harrowing details. Come  on, men, let&#8217;s strike while these irons are hot.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  four filed from the room, and Burdon spoke in a low tone, but excitedly:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come  quickly! There goes Miss Maida across the lawn. We will take her next. The  maid, Rachel, can wait.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Inwardly  rebelling, but urged on by the others, Jeff Allen went along, and as Burdon  stopped Maida, on her quick walk across the lawn, Jeff put his arm through that  of the girl, and said: &#8220;Do as they tell you, dear. It&#8217;s best to have this  matter settled at once.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Again  the party grouped themselves under the old sycamore, and this time Maida was  the target for their queries.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell  me all you know of the case,&#8221; she said, peremptorily; &#8220;then I&#8217;ll tell you what  I know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We  know that the murder was committed by one of you three Wheelers,&#8221; said Burdon,  brutally. &#8220;Now, both your parents have confessed to being the criminal&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What?&#8221;  Maida cried, her face white and her eyes big and frightened.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  ma&#8217;am, just that! Now, what have you to say? Are you going to confess also?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course I am! For I am the real criminal! Can&#8217;t you see that my father and  mother are both trying to shield me? I did it, because of that awful man&#8217;s hold  on my father! Take my confession, and do with me what you will!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s  a state of things!&#8221; cried Burdon, truly surprised at this new development.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  girl is telling the truth,&#8221; exclaimed Curtis Keefe, not because he really thought  so but his quick mind told him that it would be easier to get a young girl  acquitted than an older person, and he saw the plausibility of the detectives&#8217;  theory that it must have been one of the three Wheelers.</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right,&#8221; Burdon went on, &#8220;then, Miss Wheeler, enlighten us as to details. Where&#8217;s  the weapon?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t have to tell you anything except that I did it. Do I, Jeffrey? Do I, Mr.  Keefe?&#8221; She looked at these two for help.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Miss Wheeler,&#8221; Keefe assured her, &#8220;you needn&#8217;t say a word without legal advice.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,  Maida,&#8221; Jeffrey groaned, &#8220;you didn&#8217;t do it&#8212;you know! You couldn&#8217;t have!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I did, Jeff.&#8221; Maida&#8217;s eyes were glittering, and her voice was steady. &#8220;Of  course I did. I&#8217;d do anything to save father from any more persecution by that  man! And there was to be more! Oh, don&#8217;t let me talk! I mustn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  you mustn&#8217;t,&#8221; agreed Keefe. &#8220;Now, Burdon, you&#8217;ve got three confessions! What  are you going to do with them?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Going  to find out which is the true one,&#8221; answered Burdon, with a dogged expression. &#8220;I  knew all the time it was one of the three, and I&#8217;m not surprised that the other  two are willing to perjure themselves to save the criminal.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Also,  there may have been collusion,&#8221; suggested Hallen.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course,&#8221; the other agreed. &#8220;But we&#8217;ll find out. The whole thing rests among the  three. They must not be allowed to escape&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  no intention of running away!&#8221; said Maida, proudly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  one will run away,&#8221; opined Hallen, sagaciously. &#8220;The criminal will stand by the  other two, and the other two will stand by him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Or  her, as the case may be,&#8221; supplemented Burdon.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Her,&#8221;  Maida assured him. &#8220;In the first place, my mother was upstairs in her own room,  and my father was not in the den at the time. I was there alone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, your father was in the den,&#8221; cried Jeffrey, imploringly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221;  said Maida, not catching his meaning.</p>
  <p>But  Hallen caught it.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  was Mr. Wheeler?&#8221; he asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8212;I  don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Maida said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  if he wasn&#8217;t in the den, and if he wasn&#8217;t upstairs, maybe he was in the big  living-room, looking out at the fire.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;yes,  I think he was!&#8221; Maida agreed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,&#8221;  Hallen went on, &#8220;then, Mr. Wheeler broke his parole&#8212;and is due for punishment.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no,&#8221; Maida moaned, seeing where her statements had led. &#8220;I&#8212;I guess he was in  the den&#8212;after all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  I guess you&#8217;re making up as you go along,&#8221; opined Mr. Hallen.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore9"></a>Chapter 9 <br>
Counter-Confessions</b></h2>
  <p>Before  Keefe went away, young Allen had a serious talk with him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  want to ask your advice,&#8221; Allen said; &#8220;shall I confess to that crime?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Man  alive, what are you talking about?&#8221; Keefe cried, astounded at the suggestion.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Talking  sense,&#8221; Jeffrey stoutly asserted. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe any one of those three did  it&#8212;they&#8217;re saying they did to shield one another&#8212;and so&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  so, you want to get into the game!&#8221; Keefe smiled at him. &#8220;You&#8217;re very young, my  boy, to think such crude methods would get over, even with such muffs as those  two booby sleuths! No, Allen, don&#8217;t add another perjury that can be of no  possible use. You didn&#8217;t do the killing, did you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course not! But neither did the Wheelers!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  one of them?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Certainly  not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  did, then?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know; but you yourself insisted on some marauder.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only  to get suspicion away from the family. But there&#8217;s no hope of finding any  evidence of an outside job. You see, I&#8217;ve made some inquiries myself, and the  servants&#8217; tales make it pretty sure that no intruder could have been here. So,  the Wheelers are the only suspects left.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  am I not as good for a suspect as they are&#8212;if I make due confession?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Allen, you&#8217;re not. You&#8217;re in love with Miss Maida&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  engaged to her!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right; don&#8217;t you see, then, the absurdity of expecting any one to believe that  you, a decent, law-abiding young citizen, would commit a murder which would  positively render impossible a marriage with the girl you love?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  didn&#8217;t think of that!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course you didn&#8217;t. But that would make it unlikely that those detectives would  believe your tale for a moment. No, it&#8217;s ridiculous for any more people to  confess to this murder. Three avowed criminals are quite enough for the crime!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  none of them really did it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  you harp on that string! Now, look here, Allen, I&#8217;m as loath to believe it as  you are, but we must face facts. Those three people had motive and opportunity.  Moreover, they&#8217;re a most united family, and if any one thought either of the  other two guilty, that one is quite capable of falsely avowing the crime.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;I  see that&#8221;&#8212;Allen spoke impatiently. &#8220;What I want to know is, what we&#8217;re going to  do about it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  I can&#8217;t advise you. I have to get away now, but, as I said, I&#8217;ll return. I&#8217;ve  more than a little taste for investigation myself, and when I come back, I&#8217;ve  no doubt I can hel&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But&#8212;Keefe&#8212;I  don&#8217;t want you to help&#8212;to investigate&#8212;if it&#8217;s going to prove anything on any of  the Wheelers.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you believe them innocent!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  but crime has been fastened on the innocent.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Look  here, Allen, you do believe them innocent&#8212;but you fear your belief is a  mistaken one!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;God  help me, I do fear that, Keefe! Oh, what can we do?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  a bad lookout! All I can say now, is, to preserve a non-committal demeanor, and  keep things stationary as much as you can. Maybe when I come back, we can&#8212;well,  at least muddle things so&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Complicate  the evidence! So that it won&#8217;t indicate&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Be  careful now! You know what compounding a felony means, don&#8217;t you? Oh, Allen,  you&#8217;re so young and impulsive, and the Wheelers are so emotional and  indiscreet, I wonder what will happen before I get back!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Somebody  ought to be in charge here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  some good lawyer, or some level-headed person who would hold back those fool  detectives, and look out for the interests of the Wheelers.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  wish you could stay.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  wish so, too, but I&#8217;ll do all I can to return quickly. And Mr. Wheeler ought to  be able to look after his own affairs!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know he ought to&#8212;but he isn&#8217;t. Also, I ought to, but I&#8217;m not!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes  you are, Jeffrey,&#8221; cried Maida, who had happened along in time to hear the  young man&#8217;s depreciation of himself.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hello,  Maida,&#8221; he turned to her. &#8220;What did you mean by making up that string of  falsehoods?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  talk about it, Jeff,&#8221; and the girl&#8217;s face went white. &#8220;If you do, I shall go  mad!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t wonder, Miss Wheeler,&#8221; said Keefe, sympathetically. &#8220;Now, as I&#8217;ve just  told Allen, I&#8217;m coming back as soon as I can make it, and until I do, won&#8217;t you  try to hold off those men? Don&#8217;t let them pound you and your parents into  admissions better left unmade. I&#8217;m not asking you any questions, I&#8217;ve no right  to, but I beg of you to keep your own counsel. If you are shielding someone,  say as little as possible. If you are guilty yourself, say nothing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;&#8216;Guilty  herself!&#8217; You&#8217;ve no right to say such a thing!&#8221; Allen cried out.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course I have,&#8221; Keefe returned, &#8220;when I heard Miss Wheeler avow the crime! But  I must go now. Here&#8217;s the car. Good-bye, both of you, and&#8212;Miss Wheeler, if I  may advise, don&#8217;t confide too much&#8212;in anybody.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  last words were spoken in an aside, and if Allen heard them he gave no sign. He  bade Keefe good-bye with a preoccupied air, and as others joined them then, he  waited till the car started, and then took Maida&#8217;s arm and led her away, toward  the garden.</p>
  <p>Miss  Lane, of course, went with Keefe, and as the girls parted Maida had suddenly  felt a sense of loneliness.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  liked Genevieve a lot,&#8221; she said to Allen, as they walked away.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  didn&#8217;t,&#8221; he returned.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Jeff, you are so quick to take prejudices against people. I don&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m  specially fond of Genevieve, but she was kind to me, and now I do seem so  alone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Alone,  Maida? When you have your parents and me? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t tell you, exactly, but I seem to want someone&#8212;someone with wide experience  and educated judgment&#8212;to whom I can go for advice.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t  I do, dear?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  kind enough and loving enough&#8212;but, Jeff, you don&#8217;t know things! I mean, you  haven&#8217;t had experience in&#8212;in criminal cases&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come  on, Maida, let&#8217;s have it out. What about this criminal case of ours? For it&#8217;s  mine as much as it&#8217;s yours.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no, it isn&#8217;t, Jeff. You&#8217;ve nothing to do with it. I must bear my burden  alone&#8212;and&#8212;I must ask you to release me from our engagement&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Which  I will never do! How absurd! Now, Maida mine, if you won&#8217;t speak out, I must. I  know perfectly well you never killed Mr. Appleby. I know, too, that you saw  either your father or mother kill him and you&#8217;re trying to shield the criminal.  Very right, too, except that you mustn&#8217;t keep the truth from me. How can I help  you, dear, unless I know what you&#8217;re doing&#8212;or trying to do? So, tell me the  truth&#8212;now.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t tell you more than I have, Jeff,&#8221; Maida spoke with a long-drawn sigh. &#8220;You  must believe me. And as a&#8212;a murderer, I never, of course, shall marry.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maida,  you&#8217;re a transparent little prevaricator! Don&#8217;t think I don&#8217;t realize the awful  situation, for I do, but I can&#8217;t&#8212;I won&#8217;t let you sacrifice yourself for either  of your parents. I don&#8217;t ask you which one it was&#8212;in fact, I&#8217;d rather you  wouldn&#8217;t tell me&#8212;but I do ask you to believe that I know it wasn&#8217;t you. Now,  drop that foolishness.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Jeffrey,&#8221;  and Maida spoke very solemnly, &#8220;don&#8217;t you believe that I could kill a man? If  he was so cruel, so dangerous to my father&#8212;my dear father, that I couldn&#8217;t  stand it another minute, don&#8217;t you believe I&#8217;d be capable of killing him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve  spoken of that before, Maida, and I think I said I believed you would be  capable, in a moment of sudden, intense anger and excitement&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  then, why do you doubt my word? I told the detectives&#8212;I tell you, that the  moment came&#8212;I saw my father, under stress of terrible anger&#8212;in immediate,  desperate danger from Samuel Appleby. I&#8212;I shot&#8212;to kill&#8212;&#8221; the girl broke down  and Jeffrey took the slender, quivering form in his arms.</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, sweetheart,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;don&#8217;t say another word&#8212;I understand. I don&#8217;t  blame you&#8212;how could you think I would! I just want to help you. How can I best  do that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  Maida could not tell him. Her tears, once started, came in torrents. Her whole  frame shook with the intensity of her sobs, and, unable to control herself at  all, she ran from him into the house and up to her own room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  did you find out?&#8221; Burdon asked, coming out from behind a nearby clump of  shrubbery.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  sneak, you cad!&#8221; Allen cried, but the detective stopped him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  look here, Mr. Allen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;re here to do our duty, said duty being to  discover the perpetrator of a pretty awful crime. You may be so minded as to  let the murderer go scot-free, even help him or her to make a getaway, but I  can&#8217;t indulge in any such philanthropic scheme. Mr. Appleby&#8217;s been foully  murdered, and it&#8217;s up to the law to find out the killer and see justice done.  My job is not a pleasant one, but I&#8217;ve got to see it through, and that&#8217;s all  there is about that! Now, this case is what we call open-and-shut. The murderer  is sure and positively one of three people&#8212;said three people being known to us.  So, I&#8217;ve just got to use all my powers to discover which of the three I&#8217;m  really after, and when I find that out, then make my arrest. But I&#8217;ve no desire  to nab the wrong one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Which  one do you think it is?&#8221; demanded Allen, angrily.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  got no right nor reason to <i>think</i> it&#8217;s  either one. I&#8217;ve got to find out for sure, not just think it. So, I ask you  what you learned just now from Miss Wheeler, and why did she run to the house,  weeping like a willow tree?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  found out nothing that would throw any light on your quest, and she wept  because her nerves are strained to the breaking point with worry and exhaustion.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  I don&#8217;t wonder!&#8221; the detective spoke sympathetically. &#8220;But all the same, I&#8217;m  obliged to keep on investigating, and I must ask you what she said to you just  now.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Allen  thought over the conversation he had had with Maida. Then he said: &#8220;I am  telling the truth when I say there was no word said between us that would be of  any real use to you. Miss Wheeler is my <i>fiance,</i> and I tried to comfort her, and also to assure her anew of my faithfulness and devotion  in her trouble.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  what did she say?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Without  remembering her words exactly, I think I can state that she said nothing more  than to reiterate that she had killed Mr. Appleby. But I want to state also, that  I believe she said it, as she said it to you, to shield some one else.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Her  parents&#8212;or, one of them?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is the reasonable supposition. But I do not accuse either of the elder  Wheelers. I still suspect an intruder from outside.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course you do. . . . Anybody in your position would. But there was none such.  It was one of the three Wheelers, and I&#8217;ll proceed to find out which one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  how do you propose to find out?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  the one that did it is very likely to give it away. It&#8217;s mighty difficult to be  on your guard every minute, and with one guilty, and two shielding, and all  three knowing, which is which, as I&#8217;ve no doubt they do, why, it&#8217;s a cinch that  one of the three breaks down through sheer overcarefulness pretty soon.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  true enough,&#8221; Allen agreed, ruefully. &#8220;Is that your only plan?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  except to look up the weapon. It&#8217;s a great help, always, to find the revolver.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hoping  to find the criminal&#8217;s initials on it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  no, they don&#8217;t mark firearms in real life, as they do in story-books. But to  find the weapon gives a lot of evidence as to where it was fired from, and what  was done with it afterward, and to whom it belongs. Not that the owner is  always the murderer. More often the reverse is true. But the weapon we want and  want pretty badly. By the way, I&#8217;m told that young Appleby is out of the  running for governor now that his father isn&#8217;t here to help him through.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;More,  I take it, because of his grief for his father&#8217;s untimely end.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Be  that as it may, he&#8217;ll withdraw his name from the candidates.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  told you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  heard Mr. Keefe telling Miss Lane.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  hear a lot, Burdon.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do, Mr. Allen. It&#8217;s my business to do so. Now, here&#8217;s another thing. About that  garage fire.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  what about it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  was a mighty mysterious fire, that&#8217;s all. Nobody knows how it started, or  where.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;They  must know where!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  exactly. It seemed to start in the vicinity of Mr. Appleby&#8217;s own car. But there  was nothing inflammable around that part of the garage.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  what does that prove or indicate? Anything prejudicial to the Wheelers?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  so far as I can see. Only it&#8217;s queer, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps  Mr. Appleby kept tobacco and matches in his car.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps  so. Anyway, that&#8217;s where the fire originated, and also about where it stopped.  They soon put it out.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Glad  they did. I can&#8217;t see that the fire has any bearing whatever on the murder.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Neither  can I, Mr. Allen. But Hallen, now, he thinks it has.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  how?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t say. Hallen doesn&#8217;t know himself. But he says there&#8217;s a connection.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  may be. But unless it&#8217;s a connection that will free the Wheelers from  suspicion, it doesn&#8217;t interest me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Allen  left the detective, who made no effort to detain him, and went to the den for a  talk with Mr. Wheeler.</p>
  <p>But  that gentleman, locked in the room, declared through the closed door that he  would see nobody.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sorry,  Jeff,&#8221; he said, in a kindly tone, &#8220;but you must excuse me at present. Give me  the day to myself. I&#8217;ll see you late this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
  <p>As  it was already noon, Allen made no further attempt at an interview and went in  search of Mrs. Wheeler. It seemed to him he must talk to some of the family,  and he hadn&#8217;t the heart to disturb Maida, who might be resting.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Wheeler&#8217;s maid said that her mistress would see him in a few minutes. And it  was only a few minutes later that the lady came downstairs and greeted Allen,  who awaited her in the living-room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  are we going to do?&#8221; she exclaimed to him. &#8220;Do help us, Jeff. Did I do right?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  lying to save some one you love? Yes, I suppose so.&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  Sara Wheeler had very acute hearing. Even as they spoke, she heard a slight  movement on the porch outside, and realized at once that a detective was  listening to her every word.</p>
  <p>Allen  couldn&#8217;t be sure whether this changed her mental attitude or whether she continued  as she had meant to when she began.</p>
  <p>But  she said: &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mean that! I mean, did I do right to confess my crime at  once? You know they would discover it sooner or later, and I thought it would  save time and trouble for me to own up immediately.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Dear  Mrs. Wheeler, don&#8217;t quibble with me. I know you didn&#8217;t do it&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, I did, Jeff. Who else could it have been? And, too, you know about the  bugler, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  that&#8217;s what made me do it. You see, I thought if a death occurred, that would  be the death the bugler was heralding, and if it wasn&#8217;t Mr. Appleby it might  have been Dan himself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She  leaned forward as she spoke, her voice dropped to a mere whisper, and her large  eyes took on a glassy stare, while her white face was drawn and set with an  agonized expression as of a dreadful memory.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you killed Appleby for that reason?&#8221; cried Allen.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no&#8212;I killed him because&#8212;because&#8221;&#8212;her mind seemed to wander&#8212;&#8221;oh, yes,&#8221; she  resumed, &#8220;because he was a menace to Dan. To my husband.&#8221;</p>
  <p>For  the first time Allen began to doubt her sanity. Her eyes were wild, her fingers  nervously interlaced and her speech was jerky and stammering.</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  menace, how?&#8221; he asked, softly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  different ways,&#8221; Mrs. Wheeler returned, in so low a voice that the listener outside  could scarcely hear. &#8220;Through me, because of something he knew; through  Maida&#8212;because of&#8212;of something he wanted; and, of course, through Dan himself,  because of that old conditional pardon.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  do you mean about Maida?&#8221; Allen caught at the thing that most impressed him. &#8220;Did  old Appleby want to marry Maida?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  he did. Of course, neither her father nor I would hear of such a thing, but Mr.  Appleby was an insistent man&#8212;insistent and inexorable&#8212;and he wanted Maida&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mother  dear, I want you to come away now,&#8221; and Maida came into the room. &#8220;Come, you  have talked too long. It does no good, to you or to any one else. Did you call  her down, Jeffrey?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  and Allen deeply regretted his act. &#8220;But I want to talk to somebody, Maida.  Will you take your mother away&#8212;and return?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I will,&#8221; and the girl left the room, guiding the slow footsteps of her mother.</p>
  <p>When  she came back, Allen took her out under the old sycamore.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  Maida,&#8221; he said, gently, &#8220;the truth. No matter what it is, you must tell me. We  are here alone, that eavesdropping detective can&#8217;t overhear us, and you must  tell me whom you are shielding and the full details for the crime.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t tell you all the details, Jeff,&#8221; the girl returned, &#8220;they include a  secret that is not mine to divulge.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  can divulge anything in a crisis like this, Maida.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  I cannot. Before he&#8212;before he died, Mr. Appleby told me something that I will  never tell, unless my conscience makes me do so.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t  it a matter of conscience already?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know, Jeff; truly, I can&#8217;t tell. But much as I am bound by my principles  of right, and you know, dear, I <i>am</i> conscientious, I would willingly throw them all to the winds if they interfered  with my parents&#8217; happiness, well-being or safety.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let  me get this straight, Maida. You would stifle your conscience, would act  directly against its dictates for the sake of your parents?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Jeffrey; right or wrong, that&#8217;s what I should do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  am I that I should judge you, dear? I know well your lifelong submission to  your conscience, even when your inclinations were strong the other way. Now, if  you have thrown over principle, honor, conscience and right, for what you  consider a stronger motive, I can only accept your decision. But I wish you  would confide in me more fully. Do you mean in regard to Mr. Appleby?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course I mean in regard to Mr. Appleby. And I&#8217;m going to ask you, Jeff, to  believe what I tell you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course I&#8217;ll do that, Maida.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  you won&#8217;t want to. But I ask you to believe it implicitly and to act accordingly.  Do you promise me this?&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  girl&#8217;s face was turned to his, her great, sorrowful eyes were full of dumb  agony and showed unshed tears, but her voice was clear and strong as of one  whose purpose was unshakable.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  dear,&#8221; and Jeffrey took her hands in his and looked deep into her eyes, whose  blank despair haunted him long after, &#8220;yes, Maida, I promise.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  then, I killed Mr. Appleby, and you must do whatever you think best for us all.  What shall we do first, Jeffrey?&#8221;</p>
  <p>And  with the clutch of an icy dread at his heart, Allen replied, brokenly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t  know, Maida, darling, but I will find out what is best, and we will do it&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore10"></a>Chapter 10 <br>
The Phantom Bugler</b></h2>
  <p>The  day after the funeral of Samuel Appleby, Keefe returned to Sycamore Ridge.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  came, Mr. Wheeler,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to offer you my services. I express no opinion as  to who killed Mr. Appleby, but I do know that his son is going to use every  means to discover his father&#8217;s murderer, and I can&#8217;t help thinking you&#8217;d be  wise to let me take up your case.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  a criminal lawyer?&#8221; asked Dan Wheeler, quietly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir; as a friend and adviser. If you find you need a criminal lawyer, I&#8217;ll  suggest one&#8212;and a good one. But I mean, I&#8217;d like to help you in a general way,  by consultation and advice. You, if you will pardon me, have lived so long out  of the modern world that you are unfitted to cope with this whole situation. I  speak frankly&#8212;because I am deeply interested&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  why are you so deeply interested, Mr. Keefe?&#8221; Wheeler&#8217;s tone was kindly but his  glance was sharp at his would-be benefactor.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  may as well own up,&#8221; Keefe said, &#8220;I am hard hit by your daughter. Oh, yes, I  know she is engaged to young Allen, and I&#8217;ve no hope she would ever throw him  over for me, but I&#8217;m anxious to serve her in any way I can&#8212;and I feel pretty  sure that I can be of help to you and your family.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well  spoken, young man. And your promises are right. I am out of touch with the  world, and I should be glad indeed of the advice of an experienced man of  business. But, first of all, will you tell me who <i>you</i> think killed Appleby?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  will, sir. I&#8217;ve no idea it was any of you three people, who have all confessed  to the deed, in order to shield one another.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Whom  then do you suspect?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;An  outside intruder. I have held to this theory from the start, and I am sure it  is the true one. Moreover, I think the murderer is the man who blew the bugle&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  phantom bugler!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  phantom, but a live man. Phantoms do not blow on bugles except in old English  legends. A bugle sounded in New England and heard by several people, was blown  by human lungs. Find your bugler and you&#8217;ve found your murderer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  wonder if you can be right!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Wheeler  fell into a brown study and Keefe watched him closely. His bugler theory was  offered in an effort to find out what Wheeler thought of it, and Wheeler&#8217;s  response ought to show whether his own knowledge of the murder precluded the  bugler or not.</p>
  <p>Apparently  it did, for he sighed and said: &#8220;Of course the person who sounded that bugle  was a live person, but I cannot think it had any connection with Mr. Appleby&#8217;s  death. Even granting somebody might have been wicked enough to try to frighten  my wife, yet there is no reason to think any one wishing to kill Samuel Appleby  would know of the old legend in Mrs. Wheeler&#8217;s family.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;True  enough. But it is possible, and, in my opinion, that is the only direction to  look.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  what direction? How can you find out who blew that bugle?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know yet, but I shall try to find out. As a matter of fact very little  inquiry has been made. Those two detectives, while intelligent enough, don&#8217;t  have a very wide horizon. They&#8217;ve concluded that the assassin was&#8212;well, was  named Wheeler&#8212;and they&#8217;re only concerned to discover the first name. Forgive my  plain speaking, but to save yourself and the other two, we must be outspoken.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  yes&#8212;pray don&#8217;t hesitate to say anything you think. I am in a terrible position,  Mr. Keefe&#8212;more terrible than you can know, and while I am willing to make any  sacrifice for my dear ones&#8212;it may be in vain&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  two men had been alone in the den, but now were joined by Burdon and young  Allen.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Glad  to see you back, Mr. Keefe,&#8221; Burdon said; &#8220;usually we detectives don&#8217;t hanker  after outside help, but you&#8217;ve a good, keen mind, and I notice you generally  put your finger on the right spot.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, Burdon, we&#8217;ll work together. Now, Mr. Wheeler, I&#8217;m going to ask you to  leave us&#8212;for there are some details to discuss&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>Dan  Wheeler was only too glad to be excused, and with a sigh of relief he went away  to his upstairs quarters.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  it&#8217;s this way,&#8221; Keefe began; &#8220;I&#8217;ve been sounding Mr. Wheeler, but I didn&#8217;t get  any real satisfaction. But here&#8217;s a point. Either he did or didn&#8217;t kill Mr.  Appleby, but in either case, he&#8217;s in bad.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  do you mean?&#8221; asked Allen.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  I&#8217;ve inquired about among the servants and, adding our own testimony, I&#8217;ve  figured it out that Mr. Wheeler was either the murderer or he was over the line  on the other side of the house, and in that case has broken his parole and is  subject to the law.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  do you prove that?&#8221; inquired Burdon, interestedly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;By  the story of Miss Wheeler, who says her father was not in the den at all at the  time Mr. Appleby was shot. Now, as we know, Mrs. Wheeler ran downstairs at that  time, and she, too, says her husband was not in the den. Also she says he was  not in the living-room, nor in the hall. This leaves only her own sitting-room,  from which Mr. Wheeler could see the fire and into which he was most likely to  go for that purpose.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  wouldn&#8217;t go in that room for any purpose,&#8221; declared Allen.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  ordinarily, but in the excitement of a fire, men can scarcely refrain from  running to look at it, and if he was not in the places he had a right to be, he  must have been over on the forbidden ground. So, it comes back to this: either  Mr. Wheeler was the murderer, and his wife and daughter have perjured  themselves to save him, or he was in a place which, by virtue of the  conditions, cancels his pardon. This, I take it, explains Mr. Wheeler&#8217;s present  perturbed state of mind&#8212;for he is bewildered and worried in many ways.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,&#8221;  said Allen, &#8220;where does all this lead us?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  leads us,&#8221; Keefe returned, &#8220;to the necessity of a lot of hard work. I&#8217;m willing  to go on record as desiring to find a criminal outside of the Wheeler family.  Or to put it bluntly, I want to acquit all three of them&#8212;even if&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Even  if one of them is guilty?&#8221; said Burdon.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  yes&#8212;just that. But, of course I don&#8217;t mean to hang an innocent man! What I want  is to get a verdict for persons unknown.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  with you,&#8221; said Allen. &#8220;It&#8217;s all wrong, I know, but&#8212;well, I can&#8217;t believe any  of the Wheelers really did it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  do believe it, though!&#8221; Keefe turned on him, sharply. &#8220;And what&#8217;s more, you  believe the criminal is the one of the three whom you least want it to be!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Keefe&#8217;s  meaning was unmistakable, and Allen&#8217;s flushed and crestfallen face betrayed his  unwilling assent. Unable to retort&#8212;even unable to speak, he quickly left the  room.</p>
  <p>Keefe  closed the door and turned to Burdon.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  was a test,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure whether Allen suspects Miss Wheeler&#8212;or not&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  sure acts as if he does,&#8221; Burdon said, his face drawn with perplexity. &#8220;But, I  say, Mr. Keefe, haven&#8217;t you ever thought it might have been Jeffrey Allen  himself?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  did the shooting?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  he had all the motives the others had&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  not opportunity. Why, he was at the garage fire&#8212;where I was&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  but he might have got away long enough for&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nonsense,  man, nothing of the sort! We were together, fighting the flames. The two  chauffeurs were with us&#8212;the Wheelers&#8217; man, and Mr. Appleby&#8217;s. We used those  chemical extinguishers&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know all that&#8212;but then&#8212;he might have slipped away, and in the excitement you  didn&#8217;t notice&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  a chance! No, take my word for it, the three Wheelers are the exclusive  suspects&#8212;unless we can work in that bugler individual.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  too many for me,&#8221; Burdon sighed. &#8220;And Hallen, he&#8217;s at his wit&#8217;s end. But you&#8217;re  clever at such things, sir, and Mr. Appleby, he&#8217;s going to get a big detective  from the city.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  don&#8217;t seem to mind being discarded!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir. If anybody&#8217;s to fasten a crime on one of those Wheelers, I don&#8217;t want to  be the one to do it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Look  here, Burdon, how about Wheeler&#8217;s doing it in self-defence? I know a lot about  those two men, and Appleby was just as much interested in getting Wheeler out  of his way as <i>vice versa</i>. If Appleby  attacked and Wheeler defended, we can get him off easy.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maybe  so, but it&#8217;s all speculation, Mr. Keefe. What we ought to get is evidence&#8212;testimony&#8212;and  that&#8217;s hard, for the only people to ask about it are&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Are  the criminals themselves.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  suspected criminals&#8212;yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  are others. Have you quizzed all the servants?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t take much stock in servants&#8217; stories.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  wrong there, my man. That principle is a good one in ordinary matters, but when  it comes to a murder case, a servant&#8217;s testimony is as good as his master&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Burdon  made no direct response to Keefe&#8217;s suggestion, but he mulled it over in his  slow-going mind, and as a result, he had a talk with Rachel, who was ladies&#8217;  maid to both Maida and her mother.</p>
  <p>The  girl bridled a little when Burdon began to question her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nobody  seemed to think it worth while to ask me anything,&#8221; she said, &#8220;so I held my  tongue. But if so be you want information, you ask and I&#8217;ll answer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  doubt if she really knows anything,&#8221; Burdon thought to himself, judging from  her air of self-importance, but he said:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell  me anything you know of the circumstances at the time of the murder.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Circumstances?&#8221;  repeated Rachel, wrinkling her brow.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  for instance, where was Mrs. Wheeler when you heard the shot?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  didn&#8217;t say I heard the shot.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t  you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go  on, then; don&#8217;t be foolish, or you&#8217;ll be sorry for it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  then, Mrs. Wheeler was downstairs&#8212;she had just left her room&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Here,  let me get this story straight. How long had she been in her room? Were you  there with her?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  we had been there half an hour or so. Then, we heard noise and excitement and a  cry of fire. Mrs. Wheeler rushed out of her room and ran downstairs&#8212;and I  followed, naturally.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  and what did you see?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing  special&#8212;I saw a blaze of light, through the front door&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  north door?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course&#8212;the one toward the garage&#8212;and I saw the garage was on fire, so I thought  of nothing else&#8212;then.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then?  What did you think of later?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  remembered that I saw Mr. Wheeler in the living-room&#8212;in the north end of  it&#8212;where he never goes&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  know about his restrictions?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  yes, sir. The servants all know&#8212;we have to. Well, it was natural, poor man,  that he should go to look at the fire!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  sure of this, Rachel?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sure,  yes; but don&#8217;t let&#8217;s tell, for it might get the master in trouble.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;On  the contrary it may get him out of trouble. To break his parole is not as  serious a crime as murder. And if he was in the north end of the living-room he  couldn&#8217;t have been in the den shooting Mr. Appleby.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  true enough. And neither could Mrs. Wheeler have done it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  not?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well&#8212;that  is&#8212;she was right ahead of me&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did  you keep her in sight?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  I was so excited myself, I ran past her and out to the garage.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  was there?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Allen and Mr. Keefe and the two chauffeurs and the head gardener and well, most  all the servants. The men were fighting the fire, and the women were standing  back, looking on.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yelling,  I suppose.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  they were mostly quiet. Cook was screaming, but nobody paid any attention to  her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  fire was soon over?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  it was a little one. I suppose that chauffeur of Mr. Appleby&#8217;s dropped a match  or something&#8212;for our servants are too well trained to do anything of the sort.  We&#8217;re all afraid of fire.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  the fire amounted to little, as you say. Curious it should occur at the time of  the murder.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Curious,  indeed, sir. Do you make anything out of that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t  see anything in it. Unless the murderer started the fire to distract attention  from himself. In that case, it couldn&#8217;t have been any of the Wheelers.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  it couldn&#8217;t. They were all in the house.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss  Maida&#8212;did you see her at the time?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  caught a glimpse of her as I ran through the hall.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  was she?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  the den; standing near the bay window.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  we&#8217;ve pretty well planted the three. Mrs. Wheeler on the stairs, Mr. Wheeler,  you say, in the living-room, where he had no right to be, and Miss Maida&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Miss Maida didn&#8217;t do it! She couldn&#8217;t! That lovely young lady!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There,  Rachel, that will do. You&#8217;ve given your testimony, now it&#8217;s not for you to pass  judgment. Go about your business, and keep a quiet tongue. No babbling&#8212;you  understand?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir,&#8221; and the maid went away, her attitude still one of importance, and her  face wearing a vague smile.</p>
  <p>Meantime  Curtis Keefe was having a serious talk with Maida.</p>
  <p>His  attitude was kindly and deferential, but he spoke with a determined air as he  said:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss  Wheeler, you know, I am sure, how much I want to help you, and how glad I will  be if I can do so. But, first of all I must ask you a question. What did Mr.  Appleby mean when he said to you something about Keefe and the airship?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maida  looked at him with a troubled glance. For a minute she did not speak, then she  said, calmly: &#8220;I am not at liberty to tell you what we were talking about then,  Mr. Keefe, but don&#8217;t you remember Mr. Appleby said that you were not the Keefe  referred to?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know he said that, but&#8212;I don&#8217;t believe it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am not responsible for your disbelief,&#8221; she drew herself up with a dignified  air. &#8220;And I must ask you not to refer to that matter again.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  take that attitude,&#8221; he begged. &#8220;At least tell me what Keefe he did mean. There  can be no breach of confidence in that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  do you want to know?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because  I know Mr. Appleby had a big airship project under consideration. Because I  know he contemplated letting me in on the deal, and it was a most profitable  deal. Had he lived, I should have asked him about it, but since he is dead, I  admit I want to know anything you can tell me of the matter.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Involuntarily  Maida smiled a little, and the lovely face, usually so sad, seemed more  beautiful than ever to the man who looked at her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  do you smile?&#8221; he cried, &#8220;but whatever the reason, keep on doing so! Oh, Maida,  how wonderful you are!&#8221;</p>
  <p>A  glance of astonishment made him quickly apologize for his speech.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,&#8221;  he said, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help it. Forgive me, Miss Wheeler, and, since you can  smile over it, I&#8217;m more than ever anxious to know about the airship deal.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  I can tell you nothing,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;because I know nothing of any such  matter. If Mr. Appleby was interested in an airship project, I know nothing of  it. The matter he mentioned to me was, I am positively certain, not the deal  you speak of.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  believe that. Your face is too honest for you to speak an untruth so convincingly.  And now assure me that I am not the Keefe he referred to, and I will never open  the subject again.&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  this Maida could not say truthfully, and though she tried, her assertion was  belied by drooping eyes and quivering lips.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  were not,&#8221; she uttered, but she did not look at him, and this time Curtis Keefe  did not believe her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  was,&#8221; he said calmly, but he made no further effort to get the whole truth from  her. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you can&#8217;t confide fully in me, but I shall doubtless learn all  I want to know from Mr. Appleby&#8217;s papers.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8212;you  have them in charge?&#8221; Maida asked, quite evidently agitated at the thought.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  of course, I&#8217;m his confidential secretary. That&#8217;s why, Miss Wheeler, it&#8217;s  better for you to be frank with me&#8212;in all things. Has it never occurred to you  that I&#8217;m the man who can best help you in this whole moil of troubles?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  no,&#8221; she said, slowly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it ever has.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  realize it now. Truly, dear Miss Wheeler, I am not only the one who can best  help you, but I am the only one who can help you at all&#8212;please try to see that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  should I want help?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;For  half a dozen very good reasons. First, I suppose you know that you are in no  enviable position regarding the death of Mr. Appleby. Oh, I know you didn&#8217;t  kill him&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I did!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  you did, you couldn&#8217;t take it so calmly&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  dare you say I take it calmly? What do you know about it? Just because I don&#8217;t  go about in hysterics&#8212;that&#8217;s not my nature&#8212;is no sign that I&#8217;m not suffering  tortures&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  poor, sweet child&#8212;I know you are! Oh, little girl, dear little girl&#8212;can&#8217;t  you&#8212;won&#8217;t you let me look out for you&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  words were right enough, but the tone in which they were uttered, the look that  accompanied them, frightened Maida. She knew at once how this man regarded her.</p>
  <p>Intuition  told her it was better not to resent his speech or meaning, so she only said,  quietly:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Look  out for me&#8212;how?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Every  way. Give yourself to me&#8212;be my own, own little Maida&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Keefe, stop! You forget you are talking to an engaged girl&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  did forget&#8212;please forgive me.&#8221; In a moment he was humble and penitent. &#8220;I lost  my head. No, Miss Wheeler, I ask no reward, I want to help you in any and every  way&#8212;remembering you are to be the bride of Mr. Allen.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only  after I&#8217;m acquitted of this crime. They never convict a woman, do they, Mr.  Keefe?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re banking on! And safely, too. No, Miss Wheeler, no judge or  jury would ever convict you of murder. But, all the same, it&#8217;s a mighty  unpleasant process that brings about your acquittal, and I advise you not to go  through with it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I&#8217;ve got to. I&#8217;ve confessed my crime; now they have to try me&#8212;don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  innocent baby. Unless&#8212;look here, you&#8217;re not&#8212;er&#8212;stringing me, are you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  does that mean?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  mean, you didn&#8217;t really do the job, did you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  did.&#8221; The calm glance of despair might have carried conviction to a less  skeptical hearer, but Keefe only looked puzzled.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t quite make you out,&#8221; he declared; &#8220;either you&#8217;re a very brave heroine&#8212;or&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Or?&#8221;  queried Maida.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Or  you&#8217;re nutty!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maida  laughed outright. &#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; she said, and her laughter became a little  hysterical. &#8220;I <i>am</i> nutty, and I own up  to it. Do you think we can enter a plea of insanity?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Keefe  looked at her, a new thought dawning in his mind.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  might not be at all a bad plan,&#8221; he said, slowly; &#8220;are you in earnest?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know. Honestly, I think of so many plans, and discard them one after the  other. But I don&#8217;t want to be convicted!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you shan&#8217;t! There are more persons in this world than the three Wheelers! And  one of them may easily be the murderer we&#8217;re seeking.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Which  one?&#8221; asked Maida.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  Phantom Bugler,&#8221; returned Keefe.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore11"></a>Chapter 11 <br>
Fleming Stone</b></h2>
  <p>Next  day brought the advent of two men and a boy to Sycamore Ridge.</p>
  <p>Samuel  Appleby, determined to discover the murderer of his father and convinced that  it was none of the Wheeler family, had brought Fleming Stone, the detective, to  investigate the case. Stone had a young assistant who always accompanied him,  and this lad, Terence McGuire by name, was a lively, irrepressible chap, with  red hair and freckles.</p>
  <p>But  his quick thinking and native wit rendered him invaluable to Stone, who had  already hinted that McGuire might some day become his successor.</p>
  <p>The  Wheeler family, Jeffrey Allen, Curtis Keefe, and Burdon, the local detective,  were all gathered in Mr. Wheeler&#8217;s den to recount the whole story to Fleming  Stone.</p>
  <p>With  grave attention, Stone listened, and young McGuire eagerly drank in each word,  as if committing a lesson to memory. Which, indeed, he was, for Stone depended  on his helper to remember all facts, theories and suggestions put forward by  the speakers.</p>
  <p>Long  experience had made Fleming Stone a connoisseur in &#8220;cases,&#8221; and, by a  classification of his own, he divided them into &#8220;express&#8221; and &#8220;local.&#8221; By this  distinction he meant that in the former cases, he arrived quickly at the  solution, without stop or hindrance. The latter kind involved necessary stops,  even side issues, and a generally impeded course, by reason of conflicting  motives and tangled clues.</p>
  <p>As  he listened to the story unfolded by the members of the party, he sighed, for  he knew this was no lightning express affair. He foresaw much investigation  ahead of him, and he already suspected false evidence and perhaps bribed  witnesses.</p>
  <p>Yet  these conclusions of his were based quite as much on intuition as on evidence,  and Stone did not wholly trust intuition.</p>
  <p>Samuel  Appleby was the principal spokesman, as he was the one chiefly concerned in the  discovery of the criminal and the avenging of his father&#8217;s death. Moreover, he  was positive the deed had not been done by any one of the Wheeler family, and  he greatly desired to prove himself right in this.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you were not here at the time, Mr. Appleby,&#8221; Stone said, &#8220;and I must get the  story from those who were. Mr. Keefe, you came with Mr. Appleby, senior, and,  also, as his confidential secretary you are in a position to know of his mental  attitudes. Had he, to your knowledge, any fear, any premonition of evil  befalling him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  at all,&#8221; answered Keefe, promptly. &#8220;If he had, I do not know of it, but I think  I can affirm that he had not. For, when Mr. Appleby was anxious, he always showed  it. In many ways it was noticeable, if he had a perplexity on his mind. In such  a case he was irritable, quick-tempered, and often absent-minded. The day we  came down here, Mr. Appleby was genial, affable and in a kindly mood. This, to  my mind, quite precludes the idea that he looked for anything untoward.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  did he impress you, Mr. Wheeler?&#8221; Stone went on. &#8220;You had not seen him for some  time, I believe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  for fifteen years,&#8221; Dan Wheeler spoke calmly, and with an air of determined  reserve. &#8220;Our meeting was such as might be expected between two long-time  enemies, but Appleby was polite and so was I.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  came to ask a favor of you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rather  to drive a bargain. He offered me a full pardon in return for my assistance in  his son&#8217;s political campaign. You, I am sure, know all this from Mr. Appleby,  the son.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I do; I&#8217;m asking you if Mr. Appleby, the father, showed in his conversation  with you, any apprehension or gave any intimation of a fear of disaster?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Stone,&#8221; returned Wheeler, &#8220;I have confessed that I killed Mr. Appleby; I hold,  therefore, that I need say nothing that will influence my own case.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  you see, Mr. Wheeler, this case is unusual&#8212;perhaps unique, in that three people  have confessed to the crime. So far, I am preserving an open mind. Though it is  possible you and your wife and daughter acted in collusion, only one of you  could have fired the fatal shot; yet you all three claim to have done so. There  is no conclusion to be drawn from this but that one is guilty and the other two  are shielding that one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Draw  any conclusion you wish,&#8221; said Wheeler, still imperturbably. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve no  objection to replying to the question you asked me. Sam Appleby said no word to  me that hinted at a fear for his personal safety. If he had any such fear, he  kept it to himself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  knew of your enmity toward him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course. He did me an unforgivable injustice and I never pretended that I did  not resent it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you refused to meet his wishes regarding his son&#8217;s campaign?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  most certainly did, for the same reasons I opposed his own election many years  ago.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  all those details I have from Mr. Appleby, junior. Now, Mr. Appleby does not  believe that his father was killed by any member of your family, Mr. Wheeler.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can  he, then, produce the man whom he does suspect?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  he suspects no one definitely, but he thinks that by investigation, I can find  out the real criminal.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  may as well save your time and trouble, Mr. Stone. I am the man you seek, I  freely confess my crime, and I accept my fate, whatever it be. Can I do more?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  if you are telling the truth, go on, and relate details. What weapon did you  use?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;My  own revolver.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  is it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  threw it out of the window.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Which  window?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The&#8212;the  bay window, in my den.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  this room?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  window there?&#8221; Stone pointed to the big bay.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  were sitting there at the time of the shot, were you not, Miss Wheeler?&#8221; Stone  turned to Maida, who, white-faced and trembling, listened to her father&#8217;s  statements.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  was sitting there before the shot,&#8221; the girl returned, speaking in quiet,  steady tones, though a red spot burned in either cheek. &#8220;And then, when Mr.  Appleby threatened my father, I shot him myself. My father is untruthful for my  sake. In his love for me he is trying to take my crime on himself. Oh, believe  me, Mr. Stone! Others can testify that I said, long ago, that I could willingly  kill Mr. Appleby. He has made my dear father&#8217;s life a living grave! He has  changed a brilliant, capable man of affairs to a sad and broken-hearted  recluse. A man who had everything to live for, everything to interest and  occupy his mind, was condemned to a solitary imprisonment, save for the company  of his family! My father&#8217;s career would have been notable, celebrated; but that  Samuel Appleby put an end to fifteen years ago, for no reason but petty spite  and mean revenge! I had never seen the man, save as a small child, and when I learned  he was at last coming here, my primitive passions were stirred, my sense of  justice awoke and my whole soul was absorbed in a wild impulse to rid the world  of such a demon in human form! I told my parents I was capable of killing him;  they reproved me, so I said no more. But I brooded over the project, and made  ready, and then&#8212;when Mr. Appleby threatened my father, talked to him brutally,  scathingly, fairly turning the iron in his soul&#8212;I could stand it no longer, and  I shot him down as I would have killed a venomous serpent! I do not regret the  act&#8212;though I do fear the consequences.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maida  almost collapsed, but pulled herself together, to add:</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is the truth. You must disregard and disbelieve my father&#8217;s noble efforts to  save me by trying to pretend the crime was his own.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone  looked at her pityingly. McGuire stared fixedly; the boy&#8217;s eyes round with  amazement at this outburst of self-condemnation.</p>
  <p>Then  Stone said, almost casually: &#8220;You, too, Mrs. Wheeler, confess to this crime, I  believe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am the real criminal,&#8221; Sara Wheeler asserted, speaking very quietly but with a  steady gaze into the eyes of the listening detective. &#8220;You can readily  understand that my husband and daughter are trying to shield me, when I tell  you that only I had opportunity. I had possessed myself of Mr. Wheeler&#8217;s pistol  and as I ran downstairs&#8212;well knowing the conversation that was going on, I shot  through the doors as I passed and running on, threw the weapon far out into the  shrubbery. It can doubtless be found. I must beg of you, Mr. Stone, that you  thoroughly investigate these three stories, and I assure you you will find mine  the true one, and the assertions of my husband and daughter merely loving but  futile attempts to save me from the consequences of my act.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fleming  Stone smiled, a queer, tender little smile.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is certainly a new experience for me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when a whole family insist on  being considered criminals. But I will reserve decision until I can look into  matters a little more fully. Now, who can give me any information on the  matter, outside of the identity of the criminal?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Jeffrey  Allen volunteered the story of the fire, and Keefe told of the strange bugle  call that had been heard.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  heard it, Mr. Keefe?&#8221; asked Stone, after listening to the account.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  I was with Mr. Appleby on a trip to Boston. I tell it as I heard the tale from  the household here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Whereupon  the Wheeler family corroborated Keefe&#8217;s story, and Fleming Stone listened  attentively to the various repetitions.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  find that bugler, and you&#8217;ve got your murderer,&#8221; Curtis Keefe said, bluntly. &#8220;You  agree, don&#8217;t you, Mr. Stone, that it was no phantom who blew audible notes on a  bugle?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  most certainly agree to that. I&#8217;ve heard many legends, in foreign countries, of  ghostly drummers, buglers and bagpipers, but they are merely legends&#8212;I&#8217;ve never  found anyone who really heard the sounds. And, moreover, those things aren&#8217;t  even legends in America. Any bugling done in this country is done by human  lungs. Now, this bugler interests me. I think, with you, Mr. Keefe, that to  know his identity would help us&#8212;whether he proves to be the criminal or not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s  the criminal,&#8221; Keefe declared, again. &#8220;Forgive me, Mr. Stone, if my certainty  seems to you presumptuous or forward, but I&#8217;m so thoroughly convinced of the  innocence of the Wheeler family, that perhaps I am overenthusiastic in my  theory.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  theory doesn&#8217;t depend on enthusiasm,&#8221; returned Stone, &#8220;but on evidence and  proof. Now, how can we set about finding this mysterious bugler&#8212;whether phantom  or human?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  thought that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re here to do,&#8221; Sam Appleby said, looking helplessly at  Fleming Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;We  are,&#8221; piped up Terence McGuire, as Stone made no reply. &#8220;That&#8217;s our business,  and, consequentially, it shall be done.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  boy assumed an air of importance that was saved from being objectionable by his  good-humored face and frank, serious eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just start in and get busy  now,&#8221; he went on, and rising, he bobbed a funny little bow that included all  present, and left the room.</p>
  <p>It  was mid-afternoon, and as they looked out on the wide lawn they saw McGuire  strolling slowly, hands in pockets and seemingly more absorbed in the birds and  flowers than in his vaunted &#8220;business.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps  McGuire needs a little explanation,&#8221; Stone smiled. &#8220;He is my right-hand man,  and a great help in detail work. But he has a not altogether unearned  reputation for untruthfulness. Indeed, his nickname is Fibsy, because of a  congenital habit of telling fibs. I advise you of this, because I prefer you  should not place implicit confidence in his statements.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,  Mr. Stone,&#8221; cried Maida, greatly interested, &#8220;how can he be of any help to you  if you can&#8217;t depend on what he says?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  he doesn&#8217;t lie to me,&#8221; Stone assured her; &#8220;nor does he tell whoppers at any  time. Only, it&#8217;s his habit to shade the truth when it seems to him advisable. I  do not defend this habit; in fact, I have persuaded him to stop it, to a  degree. But you know how hard it is to reform entirely.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  won&#8217;t affect his usefulness, since he doesn&#8217;t lie to his employer,&#8221; Appleby  said, &#8220;and, too, it&#8217;s none of our business. I&#8217;ve engaged Mr. Stone to solve the  mystery of my father&#8217;s death, and I&#8217;m prepared to give him full powers. He may  conduct his investigations on any plan he chooses. My only stipulation is that  he shall find a criminal outside the Wheeler family.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  difficult and somewhat unusual stipulation,&#8221; remarked Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  difficult?&#8221; Dan Wheeler said, quickly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because,  with three people confessing a crime, and no one else even remotely suspected,  save a mysterious and perhaps mythical bugle-player, it does not seem an easy  job to hunt up and then hunt down a slayer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; begged Appleby, almost pleadingly, &#8220;for it must be done.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll  see,&#8221; Stone replied. &#8220;And now tell me more about the fire in the garage. It  occurred at the time of the shooting, you say? What started it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  nobody knew what started it.</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  could we know?&#8221; asked Jeff Allen. &#8220;It was only a small fire and the most it  burned was the robe in Mr. Appleby&#8217;s own car and a motor coat that was also in  the car.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Whose  coat?&#8221; asked Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mine,&#8221;  said Keefe, ruefully. &#8220;A bit of bad luck, too, for it was a new one. I had to  get another in place of it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you think the fire was the result of a dropped cigarette or match by Mr.  Appleby&#8217;s chauffeur?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know,&#8221; returned Keefe. &#8220;He denies it, of course, but it must have been  that or an incendiary act of some one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maybe  the bugler person,&#8221; suggested Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221;  assented Keefe, though he did not look convinced.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  think Mr. Keefe thinks it was the work of my own men,&#8221; said Dan Wheeler. &#8220;And  it may have been. There&#8217;s one in my employ who has an ignorant, brutal spirit  of revenge, and if he thought Samuel Appleby was inimical to me, he would be  quite capable of setting fire to the Appleby car. That may be the fact of the  case.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  may be,&#8221; agreed Stone. &#8220;Doubtless we can find out&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How?&#8221;  asked Allen. &#8220;That would be magician&#8217;s work, I think.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  detective has to be a magician,&#8221; Stone smiled at him. &#8220;We quite often do more  astounding tricks than that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go  to it, then!&#8221; cried Appleby. &#8220;That&#8217;s the talk I like to hear. Questions and  answers any of us can put over. But the real detecting is like magic. At least,  I can&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s done. Duff in, Mr. Stone. Get busy.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  group dispersed then, Fleming Stone going to his room and the others straying  off by twos or threes.</p>
  <p>Burdon,  who had said almost nothing during the confab, declared he wanted a talk with  the great detective alone, and would await his pleasure.</p>
  <p>So  Burdon sat by himself, brooding, on the veranda, and presently saw the boy,  Fibsy, returning toward the house.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come  here, young one,&#8221; Burdon called out.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nixy,  old one,&#8221; was the saucy retort.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  not?&#8221; in a conciliatory tone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;&#8216;Cause  you spoke disrespectful like. I&#8217;m a detective, you know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, old pal; come here, will you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fibsy  grinned and came, seating himself on a cushioned swing nearby.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Whatcha  want?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only  a line o&#8217; talk. Your Mr. Stone, now, do you think he&#8217;ll show up soon, or has he  gone for a nap?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Fleming  Stone doesn&#8217;t take naps,&#8221; Fibsy said, disdainfully; &#8220;he isn&#8217;t that sort.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  he&#8217;ll be down again shortly?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Dunno.  Maybe he&#8217;s begun his fasting and prayer over this phenomenal case.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Does  he do that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  do I know? I&#8217;m not of a curious turn of mind, me havin&#8217; other sins to answer  for.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know. Mr. Stone told us you have no respect for the truth.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did  he, now! Well, he&#8217;s some mistaken! I have such a profound respect for the truth  that I never use it except on very special occasions.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  this one?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is not! Don&#8217;t believe a word I say just now. In fact, I&#8217;m so lit up with the  beauties and glories of this place, that I hardly know what I am a-saying! Ain&#8217;t  it the show-place, though!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  it is. Looky here, youngster, can&#8217;t you go up and coax Mr. Stone to see me&#8212;just  a few minutes?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nope;  can&#8217;t do that. But you spill it to me, and if it&#8217;s worth it, I&#8217;ll repeat it to  him. I&#8217;m really along for that very purpose, you see.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I haven&#8217;t anything special to tell him&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I see! Just want the glory and honor of chinning with the great Stone!&#8221;</p>
  <p>As  this so nearly expressed Burdon&#8217;s intention, he grinned sheepishly, and Fibsy  understood.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  go, old top,&#8221; he assured him. &#8220;F. Stone will send for you if he thinks you&#8217;ll  interest him in the slightest degree. Better wait for the sending&#8212;it&#8217;ll mean a  more satisfactory interview all round.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  then, let&#8217;s you and me chat a bit.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oho,  coming round to sort of like me, are you? Well, I&#8217;m willing. Tell me this: how  far from the victim did the shooter stand?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  doctor said, as nearly as he could judge, about ten feet or so away.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221;  and Fibsy looked thoughtful. &#8220;That would just about suit all three of the  present claimants for the honor, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  and would preclude anybody not inside the room.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Unless  he was close to the window.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sure.  But it ain&#8217;t likely, is it now, that a rank outsider would come right up to the  window and fire through it, and not be seen by anybody?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  it isn&#8217;t. And, of course, if that had happened, and any one of the three  Wheelers had seen it, they would be only too glad to tell of it. I wonder they  haven&#8217;t made up some such yarn as that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  don&#8217;t know the Wheelers. I do, and I can see how they would perjure themselves&#8212;any  of them&#8212;and confess to a crime they didn&#8217;t commit, to save each other&#8212;but it  wouldn&#8217;t occur to them to invent a murderer&#8212;or to say they saw some one they  didn&#8217;t see. Do you get the difference?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Being  an expert in the lyin&#8217; game, I do,&#8221; and Fibsy winked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  isn&#8217;t only that. It&#8217;s not only that they&#8217;re unwilling to lie about it, but they  haven&#8217;t the&#8212;the, well, ingenuity to contrive a plausible yarn.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  being lying experts, just as I said,&#8221; Fibsy observed. &#8220;Well, we all have our  own kind of cleverness. Now, mine is finding things. Want to see an example?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right. How far did you say the shooter person stood from his victim?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;About  ten feet&#8212;but I daresay it might be two or three feet, more or less.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  they can judge closer&#8217;n that by the powder marks. The truth wouldn&#8217;t vary more&#8217;n  a foot or so, from their say. Now, s&#8217;posin&#8217; the shooter did throw the revolver  out of the bay window, as the three Wheelers agree, severally, they did do,  where would it most likely land?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  that clump of rhododendrons.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yep;  if they threw it straight ahead. I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;ve looked there for it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  raked the place thoroughly.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right. Now if they slung the thing over toward the right, where would it land?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;On  the smooth lawn.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you didn&#8217;t find it there!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No.  What are you doing? Stringing me?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no, sir; oh, no! Now, once again. If they chanced to fling said revolver far to  the left, where would it land?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why&#8212;in  that big bed of ferns&#8212;if they threw it far enough.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Looked  there?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  I haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;C&#8217;mon,  let&#8217;s take a squint.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fibsy  rose and lounged over toward the fern bed, Burdon following, almost certain he  was being made game of.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore12"></a>Chapter 12 <br>
The Garage Fire</b></h2>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  watch me,&#8221; he said, and with a quick thrust of his arm down among the ferns, he  drew forth a revolver, which he turned over to Burdon.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Land  o&#8217; goodness!&#8221; exclaimed that worthy. &#8220;Howja know it was there?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Knew  it must be&#8212;looked for it&#8212;saw it,&#8221; returned the boy, nonchalantly, and then,  hearing a short, sharp whistle, he looked up at the house to see Fleming Stone  regarding him from an upper window.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Found  the weapon, Fibs?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Mr. Stone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right. Bring it up here, and ask Mr. Burdon to come along.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Delighted  at the summons, Burdon followed the boy&#8217;s flying feet and they went up to Stone&#8217;s  rooms. A small and pleasant sitting-room had been given over to the detective,  and he admitted his two visitors, then closed the door.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Doing  the spectacular, Terence?&#8221; Stone said, smiling a little.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  one grandstand play,&#8221; the boy confessed. As a matter of fact, he had located  the pistol sometime earlier, but waited to make the discovery seem sensational.</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right; let&#8217;s take a look at it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Without  hesitation, Burdon pronounced the revolver Mr. Wheeler&#8217;s. It had no initials on  it, but from Wheeler&#8217;s minute description, Burdon recognized it beyond  reasonable doubt. One bullet had been fired from it, and the calibre corresponded  to the shot that had killed Samuel Appleby.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  it&#8217;s the right gun, all right,&#8221; Burdon said, &#8220;but I never thought of looking  over that way for it. Must have been thrown by a left-handed man.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  not necessarily,&#8221; said Stone. &#8220;But it was thrown with a conscious desire to  hide it, and not flung away in a careless or preoccupied moment.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  what do you deduce from that?&#8221; asked Burdon, quite prepared to hear the  description of the murderer&#8217;s physical appearance and mental attainments.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing  very definite,&#8221; Stone mused. &#8220;We might say it looked more like the act of a  strong-willed man such as Mr. Wheeler, than of a frightened and nervously  agitated woman.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  either of those two women did it,&#8221; Burdon offered, &#8220;she wasn&#8217;t nervous or  agitated. They&#8217;re not that sort. They may go to pieces afterward, but whatever  Mrs. Wheeler or Maida undertake to do, they put it over all right. I&#8217;ve known &#8216;em  for years, and I never knew either of them to show the white feather.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  it was not much of an indication, anyway,&#8221; Stone admitted, &#8220;but it does prove a  steady nerve and a planning brain that would realize the advisability of  flinging the weapon where it would not be probably sought. Now, as this is Mr.  Wheeler&#8217;s revolver, there&#8217;s no use asking the three suspects anything about it.  For each has declared he or she used it and flung it away. That in itself is  odd&#8212;I mean that they should all tell the same story. It suggests not collusion  so much as the idea that whoever did the shooting was seen by one or both of the  others.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  you believe it was one of the three Wheelers?&#8221; asked Burdon.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t say that, yet,&#8221; returned Stone. &#8220;But they must be reckoned with. I want  to eliminate the innocent two and put the guilt on the third&#8212;if that is where  it belongs.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  if not, which way are you looking?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Toward  the fire. That most opportune fire in the garage seems to me indicative of a  criminal who wanted to create a panic so he could carry out his murderous  design with neatness and despatch.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  that lets out the women?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  if, as you say, they&#8217;re of the daring and capable sort.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  they are! If Maida Wheeler did this thing, she could stage the fire easily  enough. Or Mrs. Wheeler could, either. They&#8217;re hummers when it comes to  efficiency and actually doing things!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  surprise me. Mrs. Wheeler seems such a gentle, delicate personality.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yep;  till she&#8217;s roused. Then she&#8217;s full of tiger! Oh, I know Sara Wheeler. You ask  my wife what Mrs. Wheeler can do!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell  me a little more of this conditional pardon matter. Is it possible that for  fifteen years Mr. Wheeler has never stepped over to the forbidden side of his  own house?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perfectly  true. But it isn&#8217;t his house, it&#8217;s Mrs. Wheeler&#8217;s. Her folks are connected with  the Applebys and it was the work of old Appleby that the property came to Sara  with that tag attached, that she must live in Massachusetts. Also, Appleby  pardoned Wheeler on condition that he never stepped foot into Massachusetts.  And there they were. It was Sara Wheeler&#8217;s ingenuity and determination that planned  the house on the state line, and she has seen to it that Dan Wheeler never  broke parole. It&#8217;s second nature to him now, of course.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I&#8217;m told that he did step over the night of the murder. That he went into the  sitting-room of his wife&#8212;or maybe into the forbidden end of that long  living-room&#8212;to see the fire. It would be a most natural thing for him to do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  natural, no, sir.&#8221; Burdon rubbed his brow thoughtfully. &#8220;Yet he might &#8216;a&#8217; done  it. But one misstep like that ought to be overlooked, I think.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  would be by his friends&#8212;but suppose there&#8217;s an enemy at work. Suppose, just as  a theory, that somebody is ready to take advantage of the peculiar situation,  that seems to prove Dan Wheeler was either outside his prescribed territory&#8212;or  he was the murderer. To my way of thinking, at present, that man&#8217;s alibi is his  absence from the scene of the crime. And, if he was absent, he must have been  over the line. I know this from talks I&#8217;ve had with the servants and the family  and guests, and I&#8217;m pretty confident that Wheeler was either in the den or in  the forbidden north part of the house at the moment of the murder.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  don&#8217;t you know which it was?&#8221; asked Burdon, bluntly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because,&#8221;  said Stone, not resenting the question, &#8220;because I can&#8217;t place any dependence  on the truth of the family&#8217;s statements. For three respectable, God-fearing  citizens, they are most astonishingly willing, even eager, to perjure  themselves. Of course, I know they do it for one another&#8217;s sake. They have a  strange conscience that allows them to lie outright for the sake of a loved  one. And, it may be, commit murder for the sake of a loved one! But all this I  shall straighten out when I get further along. The case is so widespread, so  full of ramifications and possible side issues, I have to go carefully at  first, and not get entangled in false clues.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Got  any clue, sir? Any real ones?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Meaning  dropped handkerchiefs and broken cuff-links?&#8221; Stone chaffed him. &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s  the pistol. That&#8217;s a material clue. But, no, I can&#8217;t produce anything else&#8212;at  present. Well, Terence, what luck?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fibsy,  who had slipped from the room at the very beginning of this interview, now  returned.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  puzzlin&#8217;&#8212;that&#8217;s what it is, puzzlin&#8217;,&#8221; he declared, throwing himself astride of  a chair. &#8220;I&#8217;ve raked that old garage fore and aft, but I can&#8217;t track down the  startings of that fire. You see, the place is stucco and all that, and besides  the discipline of this whole layout is along the lines of p&#8217;ison neatness!  Everybody that works at Sycamore Ridge has to be a very old maid for keeping  things clean! So, there&#8217;s no chance for accumulated rubbish or old rags or  spontaneous combustion or anything of the sort. Nextly, none of the three men  who have any call to go into the garage ever smoke in there. That&#8217;s a Mede and  Persian law. Gee, Mr. Wheeler is some efficient boss! Well, anyway, after the  fire, though they tried every way to find out what started it, they couldn&#8217;t find  a thing! There was no explanation but a brand dropped from the skies, or a  stroke of lightning! And there was no storm on. It wouldn&#8217;t all be so sure, but  the morning after, it seems, Mr. Allen and Mr. Keefe were doin&#8217; some sleuthin&#8217;  on their own, and they couldn&#8217;t find out how the fire started. So, they put it  up to the garage men, and they hunted, too. It seems nothing was burnt but some  things in Mr. Appleby&#8217;s car, which, of course, lets out his chauffeur, who had  no call to burn up his own duds. And a coat of his was burned and also a coat  of Mr. Keefe&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  were those coats doing in an unused car?&#8221; asked Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  they were extra motor coats, or raincoats, or something like that, and they  always staid in the car.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where,  in the car?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  asked that,&#8221; Fibsy returned, &#8220;and they were hanging on the coat-rail. I thought  there might have been matches in the pockets, but they say no. There never had  been matches in those coat pockets, nor any matches in the Appleby car, for  that matter.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  the fire is pretty well mixed up in the murder,&#8221; declared Stone. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s up  to us to find out how.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ex-cuse  me, Mr. Stone,&#8221; and Burdon shook his head; &#8220;you&#8217;ll never get at it that way.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ex-cuse  me, Mr. Burdon,&#8221; Fibsy flared back, &#8220;Mr. Stone <i>will</i> get at it that way, if he thinks that&#8217;s the way to look. You  don&#8217;t know F. Stone yet&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hush  up, Fibs; Mr. Burdon will know if I succeed, and, perhaps he&#8217;s right as to the  unimportance of the fire, after all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  see,&#8221; Burdon went on, unabashed, &#8220;Mr. Keefe&#8212;now, he&#8217;s some smart in the  detective line&#8212;he said, find your phantom bugler, and you&#8217;ve got your murderer!  Now, what nonsense that is! As if a marauding villain would announce himself by  playing on a bugle!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yet  there may be something in it,&#8221; demurred Stone. &#8220;It may well be that the  dramatic mind that staged this whole mysterious affair is responsible for the  bugle call, the fire, and the final crime.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  that case, it&#8217;s one of the women,&#8221; Burdon said. &#8220;They could do all that, either  of them, if they wanted to; but Dan Wheeler, while he could kill a man on  provocation&#8212;it would be an impulsive act&#8212;not a premeditated one. No, sir!  Wheeler could see red, and go Berserk, but he couldn&#8217;t plan out a complicated  affair like you&#8217;re turning this case into!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  not turning it into anything,&#8221; Stone laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m taking it as it is presented  to me, but I do hold that the phantom bugler and the opportune fire are  theatrical elements.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  theatrical element, too, is the big sycamore,&#8221; and Burdon smiled. &#8220;Now, if that  tree should take a notion to walk over into Massachusetts, it would help out  some.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s  that?&#8221; cried Fibsy. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  the Wheelers have got a letter from Appleby, written while he was still  governor, and it says that when the big sycamore goes into Massachusetts,  Wheeler can go, too. But it can&#8217;t be done by a trick. I mean, they can&#8217;t transplant  the thing, or chop it down and take the wood over. It&#8217;s got to go of its own  accord.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mere  teasing,&#8221; said Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir, just that. Appleby had a great streak of teasing. He used to tease  everybody just for the fun of seeing them squirm. This whole Wheeler business  was the outcome of Appleby&#8217;s distorted love of fun. And Wheeler took it so  seriously that Appleby kept it up. I&#8217;ll warrant, if Wheeler had treated the  whole thing as a joke, Appleby would have let up on him. But Dan Wheeler is a  solemn old chap, and he saw no fun in the whole matter.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t blame him,&#8221; commented Stone. &#8220;Won&#8217;t he get pardoned now?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir, he won&#8217;t. Some folks think he will, but I know better. The present  governor isn&#8217;t much for pardoning old sentences&#8212;he says it establishes  precedent and all that. And the next governor is more than likely to say the  same.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  hear young Mr. Appleby isn&#8217;t going to run.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir, he ain&#8217;t. Though I daresay he will some other time. But this death of his  father and the mystery and all, is no sort of help to a campaign. And, too,  young Appleby hasn&#8217;t the necessary qualifications to conduct a campaign,  however good he might be as governor after he got elected. No; Sam won&#8217;t run.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  will?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Dunno,  I&#8217;m sure. But there&#8217;ll be lots ready and eager for a try at it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  suppose so. Well, Burdon, I&#8217;m going down now to ask some questions of the  servants. You know they&#8217;re a mine of information usually.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Kin  I go?&#8221; asked Fibsy.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  now, son. You stay here, or do what you like. But don&#8217;t say much and don&#8217;t  antagonize anybody.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  me, F. Stone!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  don&#8217;t shock anybody, then. Behave like a gentleman and a scholar.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yessir,&#8221;  Fibsy ducked a comical bow, and Burdon, understanding he was dismissed, went  home.</p>
  <p>To  the dining-room Stone made his way, and asked a maid there if he might see the  cook.</p>
  <p>Greatly  frightened, the waitress brought the cook to the dining-room.</p>
  <p>But  the newcomer, a typical, strong-armed, strong-minded individual, was not at all  abashed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  is it you do be wantin&#8217;, sor?&#8221; she asked, civilly enough, but a trifle  sullenly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only  a few answers to direct questions. Where were you when you first heard the  alarm of the garage fire?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  was in me kitchen, cleanin&#8217; up after dinner.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  did you do?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  ran out the kitchen door and, seein&#8217; flames, I ran toward the garage.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Before  you ran, you were at the rear of the house&#8212;I mean the south side, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sor, I was.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  passed along the south veranda?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  along it,&#8221; the cook looked at him wonderingly&#8212;&#8221;but by the end of it, like.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  did you see any one on the veranda? Any one at all?&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  woman thought hard. &#8220;Well, I sh&#8217;d have said no&#8212;first off&#8212;but now you speak of  it, I must say I do have a remimbrance of seein&#8217; a figger&#8212;but sort of vague  like.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  mean your memory of it is vague&#8212;you don&#8217;t mean a shadowy figure?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sor. I mean I can&#8217;t mind it rightly, now, for I was thinkin&#8217; intirely of the  fire, and so as I was runnin&#8217; past the end of the verandy all I can say is, I  just glimpsed like, a person standin&#8217; there.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Standing?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  he might have been moving&#8212;I dunno.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Are  you sure it was a man?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  not. I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; it was, but yet, I couldn&#8217;t speak it for sure.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  you went on to the fire?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sor.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  thought no more about the person on the veranda?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sor. And it niver wud have entered me head again, savin&#8217; your speakin&#8217; of it  now. Why&#8212;was it the&#8212;the man that&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  probably not. But everything I can learn is of help in discovering the criminal  and perhaps freeing your employers from suspicion.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  I wish that might be! To put it on the good man, now! And worse, upon the  ladies&#8212;angels, both of them!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  are fond of the family, then?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am that! I&#8217;ve worked here for eight years, and never a cross word from the  missus or the master. As for Miss Maida&#8212;she&#8217;s my darlint.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;They&#8217;re  fortunate in having you here,&#8221; said Stone, kindly. &#8220;That&#8217;s all, now, cook,  unless you can remember anything more of that person you saw.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217;  more, sor. If I do, I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Thinking  hard, Stone left her.</p>
  <p>It  was the most unusual case he had ever attempted. If he looked no further for  the murderer than the Wheeler family, he still had enough to do in deciding  which one of the three was guilty. But he yearned for another suspect. Not a  foolish phantom that went around piping, or a perhaps imaginary prowler  stalking on the piazza, but a real suspect with a sound, plausible motive.</p>
  <p>Though,  to be sure, the Wheelers had motive enough. To be condemned to an absurd  restriction and then teased about it, was enough to make life gall and wormwood  to a sensitive man like Wheeler.</p>
  <p>And  who could say what words had passed between them at that final interview?  Perhaps Appleby had goaded him to the breaking point; perhaps Wheeler had stood  it, but his wife, descending the stairs and hearing the men talk, had grown  desperate at last; or, and Stone knew he thought this most plausible of all,  perhaps Maida, in her window-seat, had stood as long as she could the  aspersions and tauntings directed at her adored father, and had, with a reckless  disregard of consequences, silenced the enemy forever.</p>
  <p>Of  young Allen, Stone had no slightest suspicion. To be sure, his interests were  one with the Wheeler family, and moreover, he had hoped for a release from  restrictions that would let the Wheelers go into Massachusetts and thereby make  possible his home there with Maida.</p>
  <p>For  Maida&#8217;s vow that she would never go into the state if her father could not go,  too, was, Allen knew, inviolable.</p>
  <p>All  this Stone mulled over, yet had no thought that Allen was the one he was  seeking. Also, Curtis Keefe had testified that Allen was with him at the fire,  during the time that included the moment of shooting.</p>
  <p>Strolling  out into the gardens, the detective made his way to the great tree, the big  sycamore.</p>
  <p>Here  Fibsy joined him, and at Stone&#8217;s tacit nod of permission, the boy sat down  beside his superior on the bench under the tree.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s  this about the tree going to Massachusetts?&#8221; Fibsy asked, his freckled face  earnestly inquiring.</p>
  <p>&#8220;One  of old Appleby&#8217;s jokes,&#8221; Stone returned. &#8220;Doubtless made just after a reading  of &#8216;Macbeth.&#8217; You know, or if you don&#8217;t, you must read it up for yourself,  there&#8217;s a scene there that hinges on Birnam Wood going to Dunsinane. I can&#8217;t  take time to tell you about it, but quite evidently it pleased the old wag to  tell Mr. Wheeler that he could go into his native state when this great tree  went there.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Meaning  not at all, I s&#8217;pose.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course. And any human intervention was not allowed. So though Birnam Wood <i>was</i> brought to Dunsinane, such a trick  is not permissible in his case. However, that&#8217;s beside the point just now. Have  you seen any of the servants?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Some.  But I got nothing. They&#8217;re willing enough to talk, but they don&#8217;t know  anything. They say I&#8217;d better tackle the ladies&#8217; maid, a fair Rachel. So I&#8217;m  going for her. But I bet I won&#8217;t strike pay-dirt.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  may. Skip along, now, for here comes Miss Maida, and she&#8217;s probably looking for  me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fibsy  departed, and Maida, looking relieved to find Stone alone, came quickly toward  him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  see, Mr. Stone,&#8221; she began, &#8220;you must <i>start</i> straight in this thing. And the only start possible is for you to be convinced  that I killed Mr. Appleby.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you must admit, Miss Wheeler, that I am not <i>too</i> absurd in thinking that though you say you did it, you are saying it to shield  some one else&#8212;some one who is near and dear to you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know you think that&#8212;but it isn&#8217;t so. How can I convince you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only  by circumstantial evidence. Let me question you a bit. Where did you get the  revolver?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;From  my father&#8217;s desk drawer, where he always keeps it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  are familiar with firearms?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;My  father taught me to shoot years ago. I&#8217;m not a crack shot&#8212;but that was not  necessary.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  premeditated the deed?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;For  some time I have felt that I wanted to kill that man.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Your  conscience?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  very active. I deliberately went against its dictates for my father&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you killed Mr. Appleby because he hounded your father in addition to the long  deprivation he had imposed on him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  not that alone. Oh, I don&#8217;t want to tell you&#8212;but, if you won&#8217;t believe me  otherwise, Mr. Stone, I will admit that I had a new motive&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  new one?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  a secret that I learned only a day or so before&#8212;before Mr. Appleby&#8217;s death.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  secret was Appleby&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  that is, he knew it. He told it to me. If any one else should know it, it would  mean the utter ruin and desolation of the lives of my parents, compared to  which this present condition of living is Paradise itself!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;This  is true, Miss Wheeler?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Absolutely  true. <i>Now</i>, do you understand why I  killed him?&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore13"></a>Chapter 13 <br>
Sara Wheeler</b></h2>
  <p>Fleming  Stone was deeply interested in the Appleby case.</p>
  <p>While  his logical brain could see no possible way to look save toward one of the  three Wheelers, yet his soul revolted at the thought that any one of them was  the criminal.</p>
  <p>Stone  was well aware of the fact that the least seemingly guilty often proved to be a  deep-dyed villain, yet he hesitated to think that Dan Wheeler had killed his  old enemy, and he could not believe it was a woman&#8217;s work. He was impressed by  Maida&#8217;s story, especially by the fact that a recent development had made her  more strongly desirous to be rid of old Appleby. He wondered if it did not have  something to do with young Appleby&#8217;s desire to marry her, and determined to  persuade her to confide further in him regarding the secret she mentioned.</p>
  <p>But  first, he decided to interview Mrs. Wheeler. This could not be done offhand, so  he waited a convenient season, and asked for a conference when he felt sure it  would be granted.</p>
  <p>Sara  Wheeler received the detective in her sitting-room, and her manner was calm and  collected as she asked him to make the interview as brief as possible.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  are not well, Mrs. Wheeler?&#8221; Stone asked, courteously.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am not ill, Mr. Stone, but naturally these dreadful days have upset me, and the  horror and suspense are still hanging over me. Can you not bring matters to a  crisis? Anything would be better than present conditions!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  some member of your family would tell me the truth,&#8221; Stone said frankly, &#8220;it  would help a great deal. You know, Mrs. Wheeler, when three people insist on  being regarded as the criminal, it&#8217;s difficult to choose among them. Now, won&#8217;t  you, at least, admit that you didn&#8217;t shoot Mr. Appleby?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I did,&#8221; and the serene eyes looked at Stone calmly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can  you prove it&#8212;I mean, to my satisfaction? Tell me this: where did you get a  pistol?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  used Mr. Wheeler&#8217;s revolver.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  did you get it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;From  the drawer in his desk, where he always keeps it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone  sighed. Of course, both Maida and her mother knew where the revolver was kept,  so this was no test of their veracity as to the crime.</p>
  <p>&#8220;When  did you take it from the drawer?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Sara  Wheeler hesitated for an instant and from that, Stone knew that she had to  think before she spoke. Had she been telling the truth, he argued, she would  have answered at once.</p>
  <p>But  immediately she spoke, though with a shade of hesitation.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  took it earlier in the day&#8212;I had it up in my own room.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  where did you conceal it there?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In&#8212;in  a dresser drawer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And,  when you heard the alarm of fire, you ran downstairs in consequence&#8212;but you  paused to get the revolver and take it with you!&#8221;</p>
  <p>This  sounded absurd, but Sara Wheeler could see no way out of it, so she assented.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Feeling  sure that you would find your husband and Mr. Appleby in such a desperate  quarrel that you would be called upon to shoot?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8212;I  overheard the quarrel from upstairs,&#8221; she faltered, her eyes piteous now with a  baffled despair.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  you went down because of the quarreling voices&#8212;not because of the fire-alarm?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Unable  to meet Stone&#8217;s inexorable gaze, Mrs. Wheeler&#8217;s eyes fell and she nervously  responded: &#8220;Well, it was both.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  see here,&#8221; Stone said, kindly; &#8220;you want to do anything you can, don&#8217;t you, to  help your husband and daughter?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  of course!&#8221; and the wide-open eyes now looked at him hopefully.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  will you trust me far enough to believe that I think you will best help them by  telling the truth?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I can&#8217;t!&#8221; and with a low moan the distracted woman hid her face in her hands.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Please  do; your attitude proves you are concealing important information. I am more  than ever sure you are not the guilty one&#8212;and I am not at all sure that it was  either of the other two.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  who could it have been?&#8221; and Sara Wheeler looked amazed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  we don&#8217;t know. If I had a hint of any direction to look I&#8217;d be glad. But if you  will shed what light you can, it may be of great help.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Even  if it seems to incriminate my&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  can incriminate them more than their own confessions?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Their  confessions contradict each other. They can&#8217;t both be guilty.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you don&#8217;t know which one is?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;N&#8212;no,&#8221;  came the faltering reply.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  that admission contradicts your own confession. Come now, Mrs. Wheeler, own up  to me that you didn&#8217;t do it, and I&#8217;ll not tell any one else, unless it becomes  necessary.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  will tell you, for I can&#8217;t bear this burden alone any longer! I did go downstairs  because of the alarm of fire, Mr. Stone. Just before I came to the open door of  the den, I heard a shot, and as I passed the door of the den, I saw Mr.  Appleby, fallen slightly forward in his chair, my husband standing at a little  distance looking at him, and Maida in the bay window, also staring at them  both.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  did you do? Go in?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  I was so bewildered, I scarcely knew which way to turn, and in my fear and  horror I ran into my own sitting-room and fell on the couch there in sheer  collapse.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  stayed there?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Until  I heard voices in the den&#8212;the men came back from the fire and discovered  the&#8212;the tragedy. At least, I think that&#8217;s the way it was. It&#8217;s all mixed up in  my mind. Usually I&#8217;m very clear-headed and strong nerved, but that scene seemed  to take away all my will-power&#8212;all my vitality.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t wonder. What did you do or say?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  had a vague fear that my husband or daughter would be accused of the crime, and  so, at once, I declared it was the work of the phantom bugler. You&#8217;ve heard  about him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.  You didn&#8217;t think it was he, though, did you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  wanted to&#8212;yes, I think I did. You see, I don&#8217;t think the bugler was a phantom,  but I do think he was a criminal. I mean, I think it was somebody who meant  harm to my husband. I&#8212;well&#8212;I think maybe the shot was meant for Mr. Wheeler.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone  looked at her sharply, and said: &#8220;Please, Mrs. Wheeler, be honest with me,  whatever you may pretend to others. Are you not springing that theory in a  further attempt to direct suspicion away from Mr. Wheeler?&#8221;</p>
  <p>She  gave a gesture of helplessness. &#8220;I see I can hide nothing from you, Mr. Stone!  You are right&#8212;but may there not be a chance that it is a true theory after all?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Possibly;  if we can find any hint of the bugler&#8217;s identity. Mr. Keefe says, find the  bugler and you&#8217;ve found the murderer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know he does, but Keefe is&#8212;as I am&#8212;very anxious to direct suspicion away from  the Wheeler family. You see, Mr. Keefe is in love with my daughter&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  who isn&#8217;t? All the young men fall down before her charms!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is so. Although she is engaged to Mr. Allen, both Mr. Keefe and Mr. Sam Appleby  are hopeful of yet winning her regard. To me it is not surprising, for I think  Maida the very flower of lovely girlhood, but I also think those men should  recognize Jeffrey Allen&#8217;s rights and cease paying Maida such definite  attentions.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is hard to repress an ardent admirer,&#8221; Stone admitted, &#8220;and as you say, that is  probably Keefe&#8217;s intent in insisting on the finding of the bugler. You do not,  then, believe in your old legend?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do and I don&#8217;t. My mind has a tendency to revere and love the old traditions of  my family, but when it comes to real belief I can&#8217;t say I am willing to stand  by them. Yet where else can we look for a criminal&#8212;other than my own people?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Please  tell me just what you saw when you looked into the den immediately after you  heard the shot. You must realize how important this testimony is.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do,&#8221; was the solemn reply. &#8220;I saw, as I told you, both my husband and my  daughter looking at Mr. Appleby as he sat in his chair. I did not know then  that he was dead, but he must have been dead or dying. The doctors said the  death was practically instantaneous.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  from their attitude or their facial expression could you assume either your  husband or daughter to have been the guilty one?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can only say they both looked stunned and horrified. Just as one would expect  them to look on the occasion of witnessing a horrible tragedy.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Whether  they were responsible for it or not?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.  But I&#8217;m not sure the attitude would have been different in the case of a  criminal or a witness. I mean the fright and horror I saw on their faces would  be the same if they had committed a crime or had seen it done.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone  considered this. &#8220;You may be right,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I daresay absolute horror would  fill the soul in either case, and would produce much the same effect in  appearance. Now, let us suppose for a moment, that one or other of the two did  do the shooting&#8212;wait a moment!&#8221; as Mrs. Wheeler swayed uncertainly in her  chair. &#8220;Don&#8217;t faint. I&#8217;m supposing this only in the interests of you and yours.  Suppose, I say, that either Mr. Wheeler or Miss Wheeler had fired the weapon&#8212;as  they have both confessed to doing&#8212;which would you assume, from their  appearance, had done it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Controlling  herself by a strong effort, Sara Wheeler answered steadily, &#8220;I could not say.  Honestly, to my startled eyes they seemed equally horrified and stunned.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course they would. You see, Mrs. Wheeler, the fact that they both confess it,  makes it look as if one of them did do it, and the other having witnessed the  deed, takes over the blame to save the guilty one. This sounds harsh, but we  have to face the facts. Then, if we can get more or different facts, so much  the better.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  suggesting, then, that one of my people did do it, and the other saw it done?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  suggesting that that might be the truth, and so far as we can see now, is the  most apparent solution. But I&#8217;m not saying it is the truth, nor shall I relax  my efforts to find another answer to our problem. And I want to tell you that  you have helped materially by withdrawing your own confession. Every step I can  take toward the truth is helpful. You have lessened the suspects from three to  two; now if I can eliminate another we will have but one; and if I can clear  that one, we shall have to look elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is specious argument, Mr. Stone,&#8221; and Sara Wheeler fixed her large, sad eyes  upon his face. &#8220;For, if you succeeded in elimination of one of the two, it may  be you cannot eliminate the third&#8212;and then&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  then your loving perjuries will be useless. True, but I must do my duty&#8212;and  that means my duty to you all. I may tell you that Mr. Appleby, who employed  me, asked me to find a criminal outside of your family, whether the real one or  not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  put it that way!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  did; and while I do want to find the outside criminal, I can&#8217;t find him if he  doesn&#8217;t exist.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course not. I daresay I shall regret what I&#8217;ve told you, but&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you couldn&#8217;t help it, I know. Don&#8217;t worry, Mrs. Wheeler. If you&#8217;ve no great  faith in me, try to have a hopeful trust, and I assure you I will not betray  it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  Mr. McGuire,&#8221; Stone said to his adoring satellite, a little later, &#8220;there&#8217;s one  out.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mother  Wheeler?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  you young scamp; how did you know?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Saw  you hobnobbing with her&#8212;she being took with a sudden attack of the confidentials&#8212;and,  anyhow, two of &#8216;em&#8212;at least&#8212;has got to cave in. You can ferret out which of &#8216;em  is George Washingtons and which isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  here&#8217;s the way it seems to stand now. Mind, I only say seems to stand.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yessir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  father and daughter&#8212;both of whom confess to the shooting, were seen in the room  immediately after the event. Now, they were on opposite sides of the room, the  victim being about midway between them. Consequently, if one shot, the other  was witness thereto. And, owing to the deep devotion obtaining between them,  either father or daughter would confess to the crime to save the other.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,&#8221;  Fibsy summed up, &#8220;Mr. Wheeler and Maida don&#8217;t suspect each other; one did it,  and both know which one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well  put. Now, which is which?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;More  likely the girl did the shooting. She&#8217;s awful impulsive, awful high strung and  awful fond of her father. Say the old Appleby gentleman was beratin&#8217; and oratin&#8217;  and iratin,&#8217; against Friend Wheeler, and say he went a leetle too far for Miss  Maida to stand, and say she had that new secret, or whatever it is that&#8217;s eatin&#8217;  her&#8212;well, it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me overly, if she up and shot the varmint.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Having  held the pistol in readiness?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  nec&#8217;ess&#8217;rily. She coulda sprung across the room, lifted the weapon from its  customed place in the drawer, and fired, all in a fleetin&#8217; instant o&#8217; time. And  she&#8217;s the girl to do it! That Maida, now, she could do anything! And she loves  the old man enough to do anything. Touch and go&#8212;that&#8217;s what she is! Especially  go!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  all right. Yet, maybe it was the other way. Maybe, Wheeler, at the end of his  patience, and knowing the &#8216;secret,&#8217; whatever it may be, flung away discretion  and grabbed up his own pistol and fired.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Coulda  been, F. Stone. Coulda been&#8212;easily. But&#8212;I lean to the Maida theory. Maida for  mine, first, last, and all the time.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;For  an admirer of hers, and you&#8217;re not by yourself in that, you seem cheerfully  willing to subscribe to her guilt.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  I ain&#8217;t! But I do want to get the truth as to the three Wheelers. And once I  get it fastened on the lovely Maida, I&#8217;ll set to work to get it off again. But,  I&#8217;ll know where I&#8217;m at.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  suppose we fasten it on the lovely Daniel?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  a serious proposition, F. Stone. For, if he did it, he did it. And if Maida did  it&#8212;she didn&#8217;t do it. See?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  very clearly; but never mind, you needn&#8217;t expound. It doesn&#8217;t interest me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fibsy  looked comically chagrined, as he often did when Stone scorned his ideas, but  he said nothing except:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Orders,  sir?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Terence. Hunt up Rachel, the maid, and find out all she knows. Use your  phenomenal powers of enchantment and make her come across.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;&#8216;Tis  the same as done, sir!&#8221; declared the boy, and he departed at once in search of  Rachel.</p>
  <p>He  sauntered out of the north door and took a roundabout way to the kitchen  quarters.</p>
  <p>Finally  he found the cook, and putting on his best and most endearing little boy  effects, he appealed for something to eat.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  but what I&#8217;m well treated at the table,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but, you know what boys are.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do that,&#8221; and the good-natured woman furnished him with liberal pieces of pie  and cake.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Great,&#8221;  said Fibsy, eating the last crumb as he guilefully complimented her culinary  skill, &#8220;and now I&#8217;ve got to find a person name o&#8217; Rachel. Where might she be?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  might be &#8216;most anywhere, but she isn&#8217;t anywhere,&#8221; was the cryptic reply.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  for?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  she&#8217;s plain disappeared, if you know what that means.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Vamoosed?  Skipped? Faded? Slid? Oozed out?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  all those. Anyway, she isn&#8217;t on the place.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Since  when?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  I saw her last about two hours ago. Then when Mrs. Wheeler wanted her she wasn&#8217;t  to be found.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  hasn&#8217;t sence ben sane?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  so. And as you are part and parcel of that detective layout that&#8217;s infestin&#8217;  the house an&#8217; grounds, I wish you&#8217;d find the hussy.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  why, what langwitch! Why call her names?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She&#8217;s  a caution! Get along now, and if you can&#8217;t find her, at least you can quit  botherin&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right. But tell me this, before we part. Did she confide to your willin&#8217; ears  anything about the murder?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Uncanny  you are, lad! How&#8217;d you guess it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  a limb of Satan. What did she tell you? and when?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only  this morning; early, before she flew off.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t  very well have told you after she started.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  impidence now. Well, she told me that the night of the murder, as she ran from  here to the garage, she saw on the south veranda a man with a bugle pipe!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  pipe dream!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  dunno. But she told it like gospel truth.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  what did she say?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Said  she saw a man&#8212;a live man, no phantom foolishness, on the south veranda, and he  carried a bugle.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did  he play on it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  just carried it like. But she says he musta been the murderer, and by the same  token it&#8217;s the man I saw!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oho,  you saw him, too?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  I told your master, I saw him, but not plain, as I ran along to the fire.  Rachel, now, she saw him plain, so he musta been there. Well, belike, he was  the murderer and that sets my people free.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Important  if true, but are you both sure? And why, oh, why does the valuable Rachel  choose this time to vanish? Won&#8217;t she come back?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  knows? She didn&#8217;t take any luggage&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  did she go?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nobody  knows. She walked, of course&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  she couldn&#8217;t have gone far.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  well, she could walk to the railway station. It&#8217;s only a fairish tramp. But <i>why</i> did she go?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  ask <i>you</i> why.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  I don&#8217;t know. But I suppose it was because she didn&#8217;t want to be questioned  about the man who shot.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What!  You didn&#8217;t say she saw him shoot!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I did. Or I meant to. Anyway that&#8217;s what Rachel said. The man with the bugle  shot through the window and that&#8217;s what killed Mr. Appleby.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  come now, this is too big a yarn to be true, especially when the yarner lights  out at once after telling it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  Rachel has her faults, but I never knew her to lie. And if it was the man I  saw&#8212;why, that proves, at least, there was a man there.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you didn&#8217;t see him clearly.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I saw him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  he must be reckoned with. Now, Cookie, dear, we <i>must</i> find Rachel. We must! Do you hear? You help me and I bet we&#8217;ll  get her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I&#8217;ve no idea where she went&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course you haven&#8217;t. But think; has she any friends or relatives nearby?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Are  there any trains about the time she left?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know what time she left, but there&#8217;s been no train since nine-thirty, and  I doubt she was in time for that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  took no luggage?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  I&#8217;ll vouch for that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  she&#8217;s likely in the neighborhood. Is there any inn or place she could get a  room and board?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  land, she hasn&#8217;t gone away to stay. She&#8217;s scart at something most likely, and  she&#8217;ll be back by nightfall.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  may and she may not. She must be found. Wait, has she a lover?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  they do say Fulton, the chauffeur, is sweet on her, but I never noticed it  much.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  said he was?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mostly  she said it herself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  ought to know! Me for Fulton. Good-bye, Cookie, for the nonce,&#8221; and waving a  smiling farewell, Fibsy went off toward the garage.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore14"></a>Chapter 14 <br>
Rachel&#8217;s Story</b></h2>
  <p>&#8220;Hello,  Fult,&#8221; Fibsy sang out gaily to the chauffeur, and received a pleasant response,  for few could resist the contagious smile of the round, freckled face of the  boy.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hello,  Mr. Fibsy,&#8221; the other returned, &#8220;how you getting on with your detective work?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Fine;  but I want a little help from you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Me?  I don&#8217;t know anything about anything.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  then tell me what you don&#8217;t know. That fire now, here in the garage, the night  of the murder, did you ever find out how it started?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fulton&#8217;s  face took on a perplexed look and he said: &#8220;No, we didn&#8217;t&#8212;and it&#8217;s a queer  thing. It must have been started by some one purposely, for there&#8217;s no way it  could have come about by accident.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Spontaneous  combustion?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Whatever  made you think of that? And it couldn&#8217;t have been from old paint rags, or such,  for there&#8217;s nothing like that about. But&#8212;well, here&#8217;s what I found.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fulton  produced a small bottle. It was empty and had no label or stopper, and Fibsy  looked at it blankly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  is it?&#8221; he asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never  see one like it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  have you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I have. I was in the war, and bottles like that contained acid which, when  combined with another acid, caused spontaneous combustion.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Combined&#8212;how?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  they used to saturate some cloth or old clothes with the other acid, and throw  them about. Then, when the time came they threw a little bottle like that,  filled with acid, and with only a paper stopper, in among the clothes. The acid  slowly ate out the paper stopper, and then the two acids caused combustion. So,  by the time the fire started, the man who was responsible for it was far away  from the scene.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Whew!  And you think that happened here?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s  the bottle. The fire began in Mr. Appleby&#8217;s car. Two coats and a rug were  burned&#8212;now, mightn&#8217;t they have been sprinkled with the other acid&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course that&#8217;s what happened! Why haven&#8217;t you told this before?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  only found the bottle this morning. It had been kicked under a bench, and the  sweeper found it. Then I fell a-thinking, for it&#8217;s the very same sort of bottle  I saw used over there. Somebody who knew that trick did it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  whoever did it is either Mr. Appleby&#8217;s murderer, or an accomplice.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  think the two crimes are connected, then?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t  a doubt of it. You&#8217;re a clever chap, Fulton, to dope this out&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  there was no other explanation. Anything else hinted at carelessness of my  management of this place, and that hurt my pride, for I like to think this  garage the pink of perfection as to cleanliness and order.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Wheeler is fortunate in having such a man as you. Now, one more thing, Fulton;  where is Rachel?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rachel!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  your blush gives you away. If you know where she is, tell me. If she&#8217;s done  nothing wrong it can do no harm to find her. If she <i>has </i>done anything wrong, she <i>must</i> be found.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t  know where she is, Mr. Fibsy&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Call  me McGuire. And if you don&#8217;t know where she is, you know something about her  disappearance. When did she go away?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  saw her last night. She said nothing about going away, but she seemed nervous  and worried, and I couldn&#8217;t say anything to please her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t  you form any idea of where she might have gone? Be frank, Fulton, for much  depends on getting hold of that girl.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can only say I&#8217;ve no idea where she is, but she may communicate with me. In  that case&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  that case, let me know at once,&#8221; Fibsy commanded, and having learned all he  could there, he went off to think up some other means of finding the lost  Rachel.</p>
  <p>Meantime  Sam Appleby was taking his departure.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  have to go,&#8221; he said, in response to the Wheelers&#8217; invitation to tarry longer; &#8220;because  Keefe is coming down to-morrow. One of us ought to be in father&#8217;s office all  the time now, there&#8217;s so much to attend to.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  is Mr. Keefe coming here?&#8221; asked Maida.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr.  Stone wants to see him,&#8221; Appleby informed her. &#8220;You know, Keefe is more or less  of a detective himself, and Mr. Stone thinks he may be helpful in finding the  criminal. Miss Lane is coming also, she begged to, mostly, I think, because she  took such a liking to you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  liked her, too,&#8221; returned Maida; &#8220;she&#8217;s a funny girl but a sincere, thorough  nature.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  she is. Well, they&#8217;ll only stay over a day or two, I can&#8217;t spare them longer.  Of course, they may be of help to Mr. Stone, and they may not. But I don&#8217;t want  to miss a trick in this investigation. What a queer little chap that boy of  Stone&#8217;s is!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Fibsy?&#8221;  and Maida smiled. &#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s a case! And he&#8217;s my devoted slave.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  who isn&#8217;t?&#8221; exclaimed Appleby. &#8220;Oh, Maida, do give me a little encouragement.  After this awful business is all over, mayn&#8217;t I come back with a hope that you&#8217;ll  smile on me?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  talk that way, Sam. You know I&#8217;m engaged to Jeffrey.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no, you&#8217;re not. I mean, it can be possible for you to change your mind. Girls  are often engaged to several men before they marry.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  not that sort,&#8221; and Maida smiled a little sadly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Be  that sort, then.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  seem to forget that I may be openly accused of crime at any moment. And a crime  that hits you pretty closely.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  say such things, dear. Neither you nor any of your people are responsible for  the dreadful thing that happened to father&#8212;or, if you are, I never want to know  it. And I do want you, Maida dear&#8212;so much&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hush,  Sam; I won&#8217;t listen to anything like that from you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  now, but later on,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;Tell me that I may come back, Maida dear.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course you may come here, whenever you like, but I hold out no hope of the sort  you ask for.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  shall hope all the same. I&#8217;d die if I didn&#8217;t! Good-bye, Maida, for this time.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He  went away to the train, and later, came Keefe and Genevieve Lane.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221;  the girl cried, &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad to be back here again, Maida. My, but you&#8217;re  prettier than ever! If you&#8217;d only touch up those pale cheeks&#8212;just a little  bit&#8212;here, let me&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>She  opened her ever-ready vanity box, and was about to apply a touch of rouge, but  Maida sprang away from her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  no, Genevieve, I never use it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Silly  girl! You don&#8217;t deserve the beauty nature gave you, if you&#8217;re not willing to  help it along a little yourself! How do you do, Mrs. Wheeler and Mr. Wheeler?&#8221;</p>
  <p>She  greeted them prettily, and Keefe, too, exchanged greetings with the family.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Anything  being done?&#8221; he asked, finally. &#8220;Has Mr. Stone discovered anything of  importance?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing  very definite, I fear,&#8221; returned Daniel Wheeler. He spoke wearily, and almost  despairingly. Anxiety and worry had aged him, even in the last few days. &#8220;I do  hope, Keefe, that you can be of assistance. You have a keen eye for details,  and may know or remember some points that escaped our notice.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  hoping I can help,&#8221; Keefe returned with a serious face. &#8220;Can I see Stone  shortly?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  now. Come along into the den, he&#8217;s in here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  two men went to the den, where Stone and Fibsy were in deep consultation.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very  glad to see you, Mr. Keefe,&#8221; Fleming Stone acknowledged the introduction. &#8220;This  is McGuire, my young assistant. You may speak frankly before him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  I have anything to speak,&#8221; said Keefe. &#8220;I don&#8217;t really know anything I haven&#8217;t  told, but I may remind Mr. Wheeler of some points he has forgotten.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  let&#8217;s talk it all over,&#8221; Stone suggested, and they did.</p>
  <p>Keefe  was greatly surprised and impressed by the story of the cook&#8217;s having seen a  man on the south veranda at the time of the shooting.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  she didn&#8217;t see him clearly,&#8221; Fibsy added.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t  she describe him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  she didn&#8217;t see him plain enough. But the maid, Rachel, told cook that she saw  the man, too, and that he carried a bugle. Cook didn&#8217;t see the bugle.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Naturally  not, if she only saw the man vaguely,&#8221; said Wheeler. &#8220;But, it begins to look as  if there must have been a man there and if so, he may have been the criminal.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let  us hope,&#8221; said Keefe, earnestly. &#8220;Now, can you find this man, Mr. Stone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve  got to find him,&#8221; Stone returned, &#8220;whether we can or not. It&#8217;s really a  baffling case. I think we&#8217;ve discovered the origin of the fire in the garage.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He  told the story that Fibsy had learned from the chauffeur, and Keefe was greatly  interested.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  are the acids?&#8221; he asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know the exact names,&#8221; Stone admitted, &#8220;but they are of just such powers  as Fulton described, and the thing is plausible. Here&#8217;s the bottle.&#8221; He offered  the little vial for inspection and Keefe looked at it with some curiosity.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  theory being,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that the murderer first arranged for a fire in our  car&#8212;in Mr. Appleby&#8217;s car&#8212;and then waited for the fire to come off as planned.  Then, at the moment of greatest excitement, he, being probably the man the  servants saw&#8212;shot through the bay window and killed Mr. Appleby. You were  fortunate, Miss Maida, that you weren&#8217;t hit first!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I was in no danger. I sat well back in the window-seat, and over to one side,  out of range of a shot from outside. And, too, Mr. Keefe, I can scarcely  discuss this matter of the shot from outside, as I am, myself, the confessed  criminal.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Confessing  only to save me from suspicion,&#8221; said her father, with an affectionate glance. &#8220;But  it won&#8217;t do any good, dear. I take the burden of the crime and I own up that I  did it. This man on the veranda&#8212;if, indeed, there was such a one, may have been  any of the men servants about the place, startled by the cry of fire, and  running to assure himself of the safety of the house and family. He, doubtless,  hesitates to divulge his identity lest he be suspected of shooting.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  all right,&#8221; declared Fibsy, &#8220;but if it was one of your men, he&#8217;d own up by this  time. He&#8217;d know he wouldn&#8217;t be suspected of shooting Mr. Appleby. Why should he  do it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  should anybody do it, except myself?&#8221; asked Dan Wheeler. &#8220;Not all the  detectives in the world can find any one else with a motive and opportunity.  The fact that both my wife and daughter tried to take the crime off my  shoulders only makes me more determined to tell the truth.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you&#8217;re not telling the truth, dad,&#8221; and Maida looked at him. &#8220;You know I did  it&#8212;you know I had threatened to do it&#8212;you know I felt I just could not stand  Mr. Appleby&#8217;s oppression of you another day! And so&#8212;and so, I&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go  on, Miss Wheeler,&#8221; urged Stone, &#8220;and so you&#8212;what did you do?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  ran across the den to the drawer where father keeps his pistol; I took it and shot&#8212;then  I ran back to the window-seat&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  did you do with the pistol?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Threw  it out of the window.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Toward  the right or left?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Try  to think. Stand up there now, and remember which way you flung it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Reluctantly,  Maida went to the bay window, and stood there thinking.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said, at last. &#8220;I can&#8217;t remember.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said Keefe. &#8220;I think we can prove that it was none of the  Wheelers, but there was a man, an intruder, on the veranda who shot. Even if we  never find out his identity, we may prove that he was really there. Where is  this maid who saw him clearly? Rachel&#8212;is that her name?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  a pretty thing, too!&#8221; Fibsy spoke up. &#8220;She has flew the coop.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Gone!  Where?&#8221; Keefe showed his disappointment.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nobody  knows where. She just simply lit out. Even her lover doesn&#8217;t know where she is.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  is her lover?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Fulton,  the chauffeur. He&#8217;s just about crazy over her disappearance.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  she&#8217;ll return,&#8221; surmised Stone. &#8220;She became frightened at something and ran  off. I think she&#8217;ll come back. If not, we&#8217;ll have to give chase. We must find  her, as she&#8217;s the principal witness of the man on the veranda. Cook is not so  sure about him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  could he have been?&#8221; Keefe said. &#8220;Doubtless some enemy of Mr. Appleby, in no  way connected with the Wheelers.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Probably,&#8221;  agreed Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;We  found the pistol, you know, Mr. Keefe,&#8221; remarked Fibsy.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  did! Well, you have made progress. Where was it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  the fern bed, not far from the veranda railing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  where the man would have thrown it!&#8221; exclaimed Keefe.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Or  where I threw it,&#8221; put in Daniel Wheeler.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;d  like to see the exact place it was found,&#8221; Keefe said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come  on, I&#8217;ll show you,&#8221; offered Fibsy and the two started away together.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Here  you are,&#8221; and Fibsy showed the bed of ferns, which, growing closely together,  made a dense hiding place.</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  wonder you ever found it,&#8221; said Keefe. &#8220;How&#8217;d you happen to?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I just snooped around till I came to it. I says to myself, &#8216;Either the murderer  flung it away or he didn&#8217;t. If he did, why it must be somewheres,&#8217; and it was.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  see; and does Mr. Stone think the finding of it here points to either of the  Wheelers?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  necess&#8217;rily. You see, if the man we&#8217;re looking for did the shooting, he&#8217;s the  one who threw the pistol in this here fern bed. And, you know yourself, it&#8217;s  more likely a man threw this farther than a woman.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss  Wheeler is athletic.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know, but I&#8217;m convinced that Miss Wheeler didn&#8217;t do the deed. Ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I can&#8217;t think she did it, of course. But it&#8217;s all very mysterious.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  mysterious a bit. It&#8217;s hard sleddin&#8217;, but there ain&#8217;t much mystery about it.  Why, look a-here. If either the father or daughter did it, they both know which  one it was. Therefore, one is telling the truth and one isn&#8217;t. It won&#8217;t be hard  to find out which is which, but F. Stone, he&#8217;s trying to find some one that&#8217;ll  let the Wheelers both out.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  that&#8217;s his idea? And a mighty good one. I&#8217;ll help all I can. Of course, the  thing to do is to trace the pistol.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  it was Mr. Wheeler&#8217;s pistol, all right.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  was!&#8221; Keefe looked dismayed. &#8220;Then how can we suspect an outsider?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  he could have stolen Mr. Wheeler&#8217;s pistol for the purpose of casting suspicion  on him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  that&#8217;s so. Now to find that Rachel.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  do find her,&#8221; Maida cried, overhearing the remark as she and Genevieve crossed  the lawn toward Keefe and Fibsy.</p>
  <p>The  lad had not yet seen Miss Lane and he frankly admired her at once. Perhaps a  sympathetic chord was struck by the similarity of their natures. Perhaps they  intuitively recognized each other&#8217;s gay impudence, for they engaged in a clash  of words that immediately made them friends.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maybe  Rachel&#8217;d come back if she knew you were here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;d admire  to wait on such a pretty lady.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  tell her that you saw me,&#8221; Genevieve said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll be glad to have her back.  She&#8217;s a first-class ladies&#8217; maid.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  then she only waits on first-class ladies?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  that&#8217;s why she&#8217;s so fond of me. Do hunt her up.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  cutie, just for you, I&#8217;ll do that same. Where shall I go to look for her?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  should I know? But you keep watch of Fulton, and I&#8217;ll bet he gets some word  from her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  they&#8217;re sweethearts. Now, how do sweethearts get word to each other? You ought  to know all about sweethearting.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Genevieve, demurely.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Pshaw,  now, that&#8217;s too bad. Want me to teach you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;if  you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Saunter  away with me, then,&#8221; and the saucy boy led Miss Lane off for a stroll round the  grounds.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Honest,  now, do you want to help?&#8221; he asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I do,&#8221; she asserted. &#8220;I&#8217;m downright fond of Maida, and though I know she didn&#8217;t  do it, yet she and her father will be suspected unless we can find this other  person. And the only way to get a line on him, seems to be through Rachel. Why  do you suppose she ran away?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t  imagine. Don&#8217;t see how she could get scared.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  what would scare her? I think she&#8217;s at some neighbor&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s  you and me go to all the neighbors and see.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right. We&#8217;ll go in the Wheelers&#8217; little car. Fulton will take us.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  we get permission?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nixy.  They might say no, by mistake for a yes. Come on&#8212;we&#8217;ll just hook Jack.&#8221;</p>
  <p>To  the garage they went and easily persuaded Fulton to take them around to some of  the neighboring houses.</p>
  <p>And  at the third one they visited they found Rachel. A friend of hers was a maid  there, and she had taken Rachel in for a few days.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  did you run off?&#8221; queried Fulton.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; and Rachel shuddered. &#8220;It all got on my nerves. Who&#8217;s over there  now?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  the family, and the detectives and Mr. Keefe,&#8221; Fulton answered. &#8220;Will you come  home?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  will,&#8221; Fibsy answered for her. &#8220;She will get right into this car and go at  once&#8212;in the name of the law!&#8221; he added sternly, as Rachel seemed undecided.</p>
  <p>Fibsy  often used this phrase, and, delivered in an awe-inspiring tone, it was usually  effective.</p>
  <p>Rachel  did get into the car, and they returned to Sycamore Lodge in triumph.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good  work, Fibs,&#8221; Stone nodded his approval. &#8220;Now, Rachel, sit right down here on  the veranda, and tell us about that man you saw.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  girl was clearly frightened and her voice trembled, but she tried to tell her  story.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s  nothing to fear,&#8221; Curtis Keefe said, kindly. &#8220;Just tell slowly and simply the  story of your seeing the man and then you may be excused.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She  gave him a grateful look, and seemed to take courage.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  I was passing the veranda&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Coming  from where and going where?&#8221; interrupted Stone, speaking gently.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  I&#8212;I was coming from the&#8212;the garage&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where  you had been talking to Fulton?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, go on.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  I was going&#8212;going to go up to Mrs. Wheeler&#8217;s room. I thought she might want me.  And as I went by the veranda, I saw the man. He was a big man, and he carried a  bugle.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  didn&#8217;t blow on it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  sir. Just waved it about like.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  didn&#8217;t see that he had a pistol?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8212;I  couldn&#8217;t say, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course you couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Keefe. &#8220;Men with pistols don&#8217;t brandish them until  they get ready to shoot.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you saw this man shoot?&#8221; went on Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir,&#8221; Rachel said; &#8220;I saw him shoot through the bay window and then I ran away.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Whereupon,  she repeated the action at the conclusion of her statement, and hurried away.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221;  said Fleming Stone.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore15"></a>Chapter 15 <br>
The Awful Truth</b></h2>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  Fibs,&#8221; said Stone, as the two sat alone in conclave, &#8220;what about Rachel&#8217;s  story?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  know, F. Stone, how I hate to doubt a lady&#8217;s word, but&#8212;not to put too fine a  point upon it, the fair Rachel lied.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  think so, too, eh? And just why?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Under  orders. She was coached in her part. Told exactly what to say&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;By  whom?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  you know as well as I do. You&#8217;re just leading me on! Well, he coached her, all  right, and she got scared before the performance came off and that&#8217;s why she  ran away.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I agree to all that. Keefe, of course, being the coach.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yessir.  He doing it, to save the Wheelers. You see, he&#8217;s so desperately in love with  Miss Maida, that it sort of blinds his judgment and cleverness.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  how?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  you know his is love at first sight&#8212;practically.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Look  here, Terence, you know a great deal about love.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yessir,  it&#8212;it comes natural to me. I&#8217;m a born lover, I am.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Had  much experience?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  yet. But my day&#8217;s coming. Well, never mind me&#8212;to get back to Friend Keefe. Here&#8217;s  the way it is. Miss Wheeler is sort of engaged to Mr. Allen, and yet the matter  isn&#8217;t quite settled, either. I get that from the servants&#8212;mean to gossip, but  all&#8217;s fair in love and sleuthing. Now, Mr. Keefe comes along, sees the lovely  Maida, and, zip! his heart is cracked! All might yet be well, but for the wily  Genevieve. She has her cap set for Keefe, and he knows it, and was satisfied it  should be so, till he saw Miss Wheeler. Now, the fat&#8217;s in the fire, and no  pitch hot.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  do pick up a lot of general information.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  necess&#8217;ry, sir.&#8221; The red-head nodded emphatically. &#8220;These sidelights often  point the way to the great and shinin&#8217; truth! For, don&#8217;t you see, Mr. Keefe,  being so gone on Miss Maida, naturally doesn&#8217;t want her or her people suspected  of this crime&#8212;even if one of them is guilty. So he fixes up a cock-and-bull  story about a bugler man&#8212;on the south veranda. This man, he argues, did the  shooting. He gets Rachel&#8212;he must have some hold on her, bribery wouldn&#8217;t be  enough&#8212;and he fair crams the bugler yarn down her throat, and orders her to  recite it as Gospel truth.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  she gets scared and runs away.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Exactly.  You see it that way, don&#8217;t you, Mr. Stone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  earnest little face looked up to the master. Terence McGuire was developing a  wonderful gift for psychological detective work, and sometimes he let his  imagination run away with him. In such cases Stone tripped him up and turned  him back to the right track. Both had an inkling that the day might eventually  come when Stone would retire and McGuire would reign in his stead. But this  was, as yet, merely a dream, and at present they worked together in unison and  harmony.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Fibsy&#8212;at least, I see it may have been that way. But it&#8217;s a big order to put  on&#8212;to Mr. Keefe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know, but he&#8217;s a big man. I mean a man of big notions and projects. Anybody can  see that. Now, he&#8217;s awful anxious Miss Wheeler and Mr. Wheeler shall be cleared  of all s&#8217;picion&#8212;even if he thinks one of &#8216;em is guilty. He doesn&#8217;t consider  Mrs. Wheeler&#8212;I guess nobody does now.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Probably  not. Go on.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  so Keefie, he thinks if he can get this bugler person guaranteed, by a reliable  and responsible witness&#8212;which, of course, Rachel would seem to be&#8212;then, Mr.  Keefe thinks, he&#8217;s got the Wheelers cleared. Now, Rachel, getting cold feet  about it all, goes back on Keefe&#8212;oh, I could see it in his face!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  he looked decidedly annoyed at Rachel&#8217;s failure of a convincing performance.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  did so! Now, Mr. Stone, even if he bolsters up Rachel&#8217;s story or gets her to  tell it more convincingly&#8212;we know, you and I, that it isn&#8217;t true. There wasn&#8217;t  any man on the south veranda.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sure,  Terence?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yessir,  I&#8217;m pretty sure. For, what became of him? Where did he vanish to? Who was he?  There never was any bugler&#8212;I mean as a murderer. The piper who piped some  nights previous had nothing to do with the case!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sure,  Terence?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  come now, Mr. Stone&#8212;I was sure, till you say that at me, so dubious like&#8212;and  then I&#8217;m not so sure.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  go on with your theory, and let&#8217;s see where you come out. You may be on the  right track, after all. I&#8217;m not sure of many points myself yet.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right. To my mind, it comes back to a toss-up between Miss Maida and her  father, with the odds in favor of the old gentleman. Agree?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  might, if I understood your English. The odds in favor of Mr. Wheeler indicating  his guilt or innocence?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;His  guilt, I meant, F. Stone. I can&#8217;t think that sweet young lady would do it, and  this isn&#8217;t because she is a sweet young lady, but because it isn&#8217;t hardly  plausible that she&#8217;s put the thing over, even though she was willing enough to  do so.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  seems so to me, too, but we can&#8217;t bank on that. Maida Wheeler is a very  impulsive girl, very vigorous and athletic, and very devoted to her father. She  worships him, and she has been known to say she would willingly kill old Mr.  Appleby. These things must be remembered, Fibsy.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  so. But I&#8217;ve noticed that when folks threaten to kill people they most  generally don&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  also noticed that. But, striking out Maida&#8217;s name, leaves us only Mr. Wheeler.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  ain&#8217;t he the one? Ain&#8217;t he the down-trodden, oppressed victim, who, at last,  has opportunity, and who is goaded to the point of desperation by the arguments  of his enemy?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  grow oratorical! But, I admit, you have an argument.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;&#8216;Course  I have. Now, say we&#8217;ve got to choose between Miss Wheeler and Mr. Wheeler, how  do we go about it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  we find out how Mr. Appleby was sitting, how Mr. Wheeler was facing at the  moment, and also Miss Maida&#8217;s position. Then, we find out the direction from  which the bullet entered the body, and then we can tell who fired the shot.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve  done all that, Fibs,&#8221; Stone returned, with no note of superiority in his voice.  &#8220;I found out all those things, and the result proves that the bullet entered  Mr. Appleby&#8217;s body from the direction of Miss Maida, in the bay window, and  directly opposite from what would have been its direction if fired by Mr.  Wheeler, from where he stood, when seen directly after the shot.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fibsy  looked dejected. He made no response to this disclosure for a moment, then he  said:</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, F. Stone. In that case I&#8217;m going over to Mr. Keefe&#8217;s side, and I&#8217;m going  to hunt up the bugler.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A  fictitious person?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maybe  he ain&#8217;t so fictitious after all,&#8221; and the red-head shook doggedly.</p>
  <p>A  tap at the door of Stone&#8217;s sitting-room was followed by a &#8220;May I come in?&#8221; and  the entrance of Daniel Wheeler.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  time has come, Mr. Wheeler,&#8221; Stone began a little abruptly, &#8220;to put all our  cards on the table. I&#8217;ve investigated things pretty thoroughly, and, though I&#8217;m  not all through with my quest, I feel as if I must know the truth as to what  you know about the murder.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  have confessed,&#8221; Wheeler began, but Stone stopped him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  won&#8217;t do,&#8221; he said, very seriously. &#8220;I&#8217;ve proved positively that from where you  stood, you could not have fired the shot. It came from the opposite direction.  Now it&#8217;s useless for you to keep up that pretence of being the criminal, which,  I&#8217;ve no doubt, you&#8217;re doing to shield your daughter. Confide in me, Mr.  Wheeler, it will not harm the case.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;God  help me, I must confide in somebody,&#8221; cried the desperate man. &#8220;She did do it! I  saw Maida fire the shot! Oh, can you save her? I wouldn&#8217;t tell you this, but I  think&#8212;I hope you can help better if you know. You&#8217;d find it out anyway&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course I should. Now, let us be strictly truthful. You saw Miss Maida fire the  pistol?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  I was sitting almost beside Appleby; he was nearer Maida than I was, and she  sat in the bay window, reading. She sits there much of the time, and I&#8217;m so  accustomed to her presence that I don&#8217;t even think about it. We were talking  pretty angrily, Appleby and I, really renewing the old feud, and adding fuel to  its flame with every word. I suppose Maida, listening, grew more and more  indignant at his injustice and cruelty to me&#8212;those terms are not too  strong!&#8212;and she being of an impulsive nature, even revengeful when her love for  me is touched, and I suppose she, somehow, possessed herself of my pistol and  fired it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  were not looking at her before the shot?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no; the shot rang out, Appleby fell forward, and even as I rose to go to his  aid, I instinctively turned toward the direction from which the sound of the  shot had come. There I saw Maida, standing white-faced and frightened, but with  a look of satisfied revenge on her dear face. I felt no resentment at her act,  then&#8212;indeed, I was incapable of coherent thought of any sort. I stepped to  Appleby&#8217;s side, and I saw at once that he was dead&#8212;had died instantly. I cannot  tell you just what happened next. It seemed ages before anybody came, and then,  suddenly the room was full of people. Allen and Keefe came, running&#8212;the  servants gathered about, my wife appeared, and Maida was there. I had a strange  undercurrent of thought that kept hammering at my brain to the effect that I  must convince everybody that I did it, to save my girl. I was clear-headed to  the extent of planning my words in an effort to carry conviction of my guilt,  but that effort so absorbed my attention that I gave no heed to what happened  otherwise.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thank  you, Mr. Wheeler, for your kindness. I assure you you will not regret it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  going to save her? You can save my little girl? Oh, Mr. Stone, I beg of you&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  agonized father broke down completely, and Stone said, kindly:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Keep  up a good heart, Mr. Wheeler. That will help your daughter more than anything  else you can do. I assumed that if one of you were guilty the other was  shielding the criminal, but your story has straightened out the tangle  considerably.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Lemme  ask something, please,&#8221; broke in Fibsy. &#8220;Say, Mr. Wheeler, did you see the  pistol in Miss Maida&#8217;s hands?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t say I did or didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Wheeler replied, listlessly. &#8220;I looked only at her  face. I know my daughter&#8217;s mind so well, that I at once recognized her  expression of horror mingled with relief. She had really desired the death of  her father&#8217;s enemy, and she was glad it had been accomplished! It&#8217;s a terrible  thing to say of one&#8217;s own child, but I&#8217;ve made up my mind to be honest with  you, Mr. Stone, in the hope of your help. I should have persisted in my own  story of guilt, had I not perceived it was futile in the face of your clear-sighted  logic and knowledge of the exact circumstances.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  did wisely. But say nothing to any one else, for the present. Do not even talk  to Miss Maida about it, until I have time to plan our next step. It is still a  difficult and a very delicate case. A single false move may queer the whole  game.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  think, then, you can save Maida&#8212;oh, do give a tortured father a gleam of hope!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  shall do my best. You know they rarely, if ever, convict a woman&#8212;and, too, Miss  Wheeler had great provocation. Then&#8212;what about self-defence?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Appleby  threatened neither of us,&#8221; Wheeler said. &#8220;That can&#8217;t be used.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  we&#8217;ll do everything we can, you may depend on that,&#8221; Stone assured him. And  Wheeler went away, relieved at the new turn things had taken, though also newly  concerned for Maida&#8217;s safety.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nice  old chap,&#8221; said Fibsy to Stone. &#8220;He stuck to his faked yarn as long as the  sticking was good, and then he caved in.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Open  and shut case, Terence?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Open&#8212;but  not yet shut, F. Stone. Now, where do we go from here?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  go where you like, boy. Leave me to grub at this alone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Without  another word Fibsy left the room. He well knew when Stone spoke in that serious  tone that great thoughts were forming in that fertile brain and sooner or later  he would know of them. But at present his company was not desired.</p>
  <p>The  boy drifted out on the terraced lawn and wandered about among the gardens. He,  too, thought, but he could see no light ahead.</p>
  <p>&#8220;S&#8217;long  as the old man saw her,&#8221; he observed to himself, &#8220;there&#8217;s no more to be said. He  never&#8217;d say he saw her shoot, if he hadn&#8217;t seen her. He&#8217;s at the end of his  rope, and even if they acquit the lady I don&#8217;t want to see her dragged through  a trial. But where&#8217;s any way of escape? What can turn up to contradict a  straight story like that? Who else can testify except the eye-witness who has  just spoken? I wonder if he realized himself how conclusive his statement was?  But he trusted in F. Stone to get Maida off, somehow. Queer, how most folks  think a detective is a magician, and can do the impossible trick!&#8221;</p>
  <p>In  a brown study he walked slowly along the garden paths, and was seen by Keefe  and Maida, who sat under the big sycamore tree.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Crazy  idea, Stone bringing that kid,&#8221; Keefe said, with a laugh.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  but he&#8217;s a very bright boy,&#8221; Maida returned. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been surprised at his wise  observations.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Poppycock!  He gets off his speeches with that funny mixture of newsboy slang and detective  jargon, and you think they&#8217;re cleverer than they are.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221;  agreed Maida, not greatly interested. &#8220;But what a strange story Rachel told. Do  you believe it, Mr. Keefe?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I do. The girl was frightened, I think; first, at the information she tried to  divulge, and second, by finding herself in the limelight. She seems to be shy,  and I daresay the sudden publicity shook her nerves. But why shouldn&#8217;t her  story be true? Why should she invent all that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure. But it didn&#8217;t sound like Rachel&#8212;the whole thing, I mean.  She seemed acting a part.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nonsense!  You imagine that. But never mind her, I&#8217;ve something to tell you. I know&#8212;Maida,  mind you, I know what Mr. Appleby meant by the speech which I took to be &#8216;Mr.  Keefe and the airship.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maida&#8217;s  face went white.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no!&#8221; she cried, involuntarily. &#8220;Oh, no!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  Keefe went on, &#8220;and I know now he said heirship. Not strange I misunderstood,  for the words are of the same sound&#8212;and, then I had no reason to think of  myself in connection with an heirship!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And&#8212;and  have you now?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I have. I&#8217;ve been over Mr. Appleby&#8217;s papers&#8212;as I had a right to do. You know I  was his confidential secretary, and he kept no secrets from me&#8212;except those he  wanted to keep!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go  on,&#8221; said Maida, calm now, and her eyes glistening with an expression of  despair.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Need  I go on? You know the truth. You know that I am the rightful heir of this whole  place. Sycamore Ridge is mine, and not your mother&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;  The word was scarce audible. Poor Maida felt as if the last blow had fallen.  She had seared her conscience, defied her sense of honor, crucified her very  soul to keep this dreadful secret from her parents for their own sake, and now  all her efforts were of no avail!</p>
  <p>Curtis  Keefe knew that the great estate was legally his, and now her dear parents  would be turned out, homeless, penniless and broken down by sorrow and grief.</p>
  <p>Even  though he might allow them to stay there, they wouldn&#8217;t, she knew, consent to  any such arrangement.</p>
  <p>She  lifted a blanched, strained face to his, as she said: &#8220;What&#8212;what are you going  to do?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just  what you say,&#8221; Keefe replied, drawing closer to her side. &#8220;It&#8217;s all up to you,  Maida dear. Don&#8217;t look offended; surely you know I love you&#8212;surely you know my  one great desire is to make you my wife. Give your consent; say you will be  mine, and rest assured, dearest, there will be no trouble about the &#8216;heirship.&#8217;  If you will marry me, I will promise never to divulge the secret so long as  either of your parents live. They may keep this place, and, besides that,  darling, I will guarantee to get your father a full pardon. I&#8212;well, I&#8217;m not  speaking of it yet&#8212;but I&#8217;ll tell you that there is a possibility of my running  for governor myself, since young Sam is voluntarily out of it. But, in any  case, I have influence enough in certain quarters&#8212;influence increased by  knowledge that I have gleaned here and there among the late Mr. Appleby&#8217;s  papers&#8212;to secure a full and free pardon for your father. Now, Maida, girl, even  if you don&#8217;t love me very much yet, can&#8217;t you say yes, in view of what I offer  you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  can you torture me so? Surely you know that I am engaged to Mr. Allen.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  didn&#8217;t know it was a positive engagement&#8212;but, anyway,&#8221; his voice grew hard, &#8220;it  seems to me that any one so solicitous for her parents&#8217; welfare and happiness  as you have shown yourself, will not hesitate at a step which means so much  more than others you have taken.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I don&#8217;t know what to do&#8212;what to say&#8212;let me think.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  dear, think all you like. Take it quietly now. Remember that a decision in my  favor means also a calm, peaceful and happy life insured to your parents.  Refusal means a broken, shattered life, a precarious existence, and never a  happy day for them again. Can you hesitate? I&#8217;m not so very unpresentable as a  husband. You may not love me now, but you will! I&#8217;ll be so good to you that you  can&#8217;t help it. Nor do I mean to win your heart only by what I shall do for you.  For, Maida dearest, love begets love, and you will find yourself slowly  perhaps, but surely, giving me your heart. And we will be so happy! Is it yes,  my darling?&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  girl stared at him, her big brown eyes full of agony.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  forget something,&#8221; she said, slowly. &#8220;I am a murderess!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hush!  Don&#8217;t say that awful word! You are not&#8212;and even if you were, I&#8217;ll prove you are  not! Listen, Maida, if you&#8217;ll promise to marry me, I&#8217;ll find the real  murderer&#8212;not you or your father, but the real murderer. I&#8217;ll get a signed  confession&#8212;I&#8217;ll acquit you and your family of any implication in the deed, and  I&#8217;ll produce the criminal himself. Now, will you say yes?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  can&#8217;t do all that,&#8221; she said, speaking in an awestruck whisper, as if he had  proposed to perform a miracle.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8212;I swear it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,  if you can do that, you ought to do it, anyway! In the interests of right and  justice, in common honesty and decency, you ought to tell what you know!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maida,  I am a man and I am in love with you. That explains much. I will do all I have  promised, to gain you as my bride&#8212;but not otherwise. As to right and  justice&#8212;you&#8217;ve confessed the crime, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  you confess it to me, now? Do you say to me that you killed Samuel Appleby?&#8221;</p>
  <p>There  was but a moment&#8217;s pause, and then Maida said, in a low tone: &#8220;Yes&#8212;I confess it  to you, Mr. Keefe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,  do you see what I mean when I say I will produce the&#8212;murderer? Do you see that  I mean to save you from the consequences of your own rash act&#8212;and prove you, to  the world at large, innocent?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Keefe  looked straight into Maida&#8217;s eyes, and her own fell in confusion.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can  you do it?&#8221; she asked, tremulously.</p>
  <p>&#8220;When  I say I will do a thing, I&#8217;ve already proved to my own satisfaction that I can  do it. But, I&#8217;ll do it only at my own price. The price being you&#8212;you dear,  delicious thing! Oh, Maida, you&#8217;ve no idea what it means to be loved as I love  you! I&#8217;ll make you happy, my darling! I&#8217;ll make you forget all this horrible  episode; I&#8217;ll give you a fairyland life. You shall be happier than you ever  dreamed of.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But&#8212;Jeffrey&#8212;oh,  I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then&#8212;Miss  Wheeler, you must take the consequences&#8212;all the consequences. Can you do that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221;  Maida said, after an interval of silence. &#8220;I can&#8217;t. I am forced to accept your  offer, Mr. Keefe&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  may not accept it with that address.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Curtis,  then. Curtis, I say, yes.&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore16"></a>Chapter 16 <br>
Maida&#8217;s Decision</b></h2>
  <p>&#8220;Maida,  it cannot be. I shall never let you marry Mr. Keefe when I know how you love  Jeffrey.&#8221; Sara Wheeler spoke quietly, but her agonized face and tear-filled  eyes told of her deep distress. Though not demonstrative, she loved her  daughter, her only child, with an affection that was almost idolatry, and she  had been glad of the idea of Maida&#8217;s marriage to Jeffrey, for she knew of his  sterling worth, and she knew the depth and sincerity of their attachment.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  say you won&#8217;t let me, mother,&#8221; Maida spoke in a dull, sad tone&#8212;a tone of calm  despair. &#8220;It must be so. I&#8217;m not saying I love him&#8212;I&#8217;m not saying much about it  all&#8212;but I tell you solemnly&#8212;it must be. And you must not raise a single word of  objection&#8212;if you do, you will only make my hard lot harder.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,  dear, you must explain. I am your mother&#8212;I&#8217;ve always had your confidence, and I  ought to be told why you are doing this thing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  just the trouble, mother. I can&#8217;t tell you. And because of the confidence that  has always been between us, you must trust me and believe that I am doing  right&#8212;and doing the only possible thing. Oh, it is all hard enough, without  having to argue about it. Why, my will power may give out! My soul strength may  break down! Mother! don&#8217;t&#8212;don&#8217;t combat me! Don&#8217;t tempt me aside from the only  straight line of duty and of right!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Child,  you are not doing right! You cannot have a duty of which I know nothing! Of  which your father knows nothing! Maida, my little girl, what is this thing that  has warped your sense of right and wrong? Has Curtis Keefe won your heart away  from Jeffrey&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No&#8212;oh,  no! Never that! But it would be a wrong to Jeffrey for me to marry him&#8212;it would  be a wrong to&#8212;to all of us! By marrying Mr. Keefe I can make everything  right&#8212;and&#8212;&#8221; she suddenly assumed an air of cold, stern determination. &#8220;Mother,  my mind is made up. You cannot change it, nor can you help me by trying. You  only make it harder for me, and I beg of you to stop. And then&#8212;you know,  mother&#8212;I killed Mr. Appleby&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hush,  Maida, you never did! I know you didn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  it was either I or father! You don&#8217;t believe he did, do you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;God  help me! I don&#8217;t know what to believe! But I tried to say I did it&#8212;only I  couldn&#8217;t carry it out&#8212;nor can you, dear.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nor  can father, then. Oh, mother, I did do that shooting! I did! I did!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Every  assertion like that makes me more certain you didn&#8217;t,&#8221; and Mrs. Wheeler fondly  caressed the head that lay on her breast. Maida was not hysterical, but so  deeply troubled that she was nervously unstrung and now gave way to torrents of  tears, and then ceased crying and bravely announced her plans.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Please,  mother darling, don&#8217;t talk about that. Suppose I tell you that even that matter  will be all set right if I marry Curtis Keefe&#8212;and by no other means. Even Mr.  Stone can&#8217;t find any other suspect than us three Wheelers. He doesn&#8217;t at all  believe in the &#8216;bugler.&#8217; Nobody does.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only  as a last chance to free father and me. Mother it&#8217;s an awful situation. Worse,  far worse than you know anything about. Won&#8217;t you trust me to do what I know to  be right&#8212;and when I tell you I must marry Mr. Keefe, won&#8217;t you believe me? And  not only believe me but help me. Help me in every way you can&#8212;for God knows I  need help.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  can I do, darling,&#8221; asked Sara Wheeler, awed by the look of utter hopelessness  on Maida&#8217;s face.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Stand  by me, mother. Urge father not to oppose this marriage. Help me to tell  Jeffrey&#8212;you tell him, can&#8217;t you, mother? I can&#8217;t&#8212;oh, I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Again  Sara Wheeler broke out into protestations against this sacrifice of her loved  daughter, and again Maida had to reaffirm her decision, until, both worn out,  they separated, Sara promising to do just as Maida wished in all things.</p>
  <p>And  in fulfillment of this promise, Sara told young Allen.</p>
  <p>As  she expected, he was stunned by the news, but where she had supposed he would  show anger or rage, he showed only a deep sympathy for Maida.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Poor  little girl,&#8221; he said, the quick tears springing to his eyes; &#8220;what dreadful  thing can that man have held over her to force her to this? And what is the  best way for me to go about remedying the situation? You know, Mrs. Wheeler,  Maida wouldn&#8217;t talk like that unless she had arrived at a very desperate crisis&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  she killed Mr. Appleby&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  never did! No power on earth can make me believe that! Why, when Maida&#8217;s own  confession doesn&#8217;t convince me, what else could? No; there&#8217;s some deep mystery  behind that murder. I mean something far deeper and more mysterious than any of  us yet realize. I think Mr. Stone is on track of the solution, but he cannot  have made much progress&#8212;or, if he has, he hasn&#8217;t told of it yet. But, I&#8217;m not a  detective&#8212;nor is any needed when Mr. Stone is on the case, but I am out to  protect and clear my Maida&#8212;my darling. Poor child, how she is suffering! Where  is she?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  go to her, Jeff. At least, not just now. She begged that you wouldn&#8217;t&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  I must&#8212;I&#8217;ve got to!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  for her sake&#8212;Jeffrey dear, for our Maida&#8217;s sake, leave her alone for the  present. She is so worried and anxious, so wrought up to the very verge of  collapse, that if you try to talk to her she will go all to pieces.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  that&#8217;s all wrong. I ought to soothe her, to comfort her&#8212;not make her more  troubled!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  ought to, I know, but you wouldn&#8217;t. Oh, it isn&#8217;t your fault&#8212;it isn&#8217;t that you  don&#8217;t love her enough&#8212;not that she doesn&#8217;t love you enough&#8212;in fact, that&#8217;s just  the trouble. Try to see it, Jeff. Maida is in the clutch of circumstances. I  don&#8217;t know the facts, you don&#8217;t; but it is true that the kindest thing we can  do for her just now is to leave her alone. She will do right&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  she sees it, yes! But she sees wrong, I know she does! The child has always  been overconscientious&#8212;and I&#8217;m positive that whatever she is up to, it&#8217;s  something to save her father!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Jeff&#8212;then you believe he is&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  Mrs. Wheeler, don&#8217;t <i>you</i> know whether  your husband killed Mr. Appleby or not?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know! Heaven help me&#8212;how can I know? The two of them, shielding each  other&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wait  a minute, if they are shielding each other&#8212;they&#8217;re both innocent!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  it isn&#8217;t that way. Mr. Wheeler said to me, at first: &#8216;Of course, either Maida  or I did it. We both know which one did it, but if we don&#8217;t tell, no one else  can know.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  see that point; but I should think, knowing both so closely as you do, you  could discern the truth&#8212;and&#8221;&#8212;he gazed at her steadily&#8212;&#8221;you have.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;I  have. Of course, as you say, in such intimacy as we three are, it would be  impossible for me not to know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And&#8212;it  was Maida?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Jeffrey.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  are you certain?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Her  father saw her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Saw  her shoot?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,  I&#8217;m glad you told me. I&#8217;m going to marry her at once, and have all rights of  her protection through the trial&#8212;if it comes to that. Nothing else could have  convinced me of her act! Poor, dear little Maida. I&#8217;ve known her capability for  sudden, impulsive action but&#8212;oh, well, if Mr. Wheeler saw her&#8212;that&#8217;s all there  is to be said. Now, dear Mrs. Wheeler, you must let me go to my Maida!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,  Jeffrey, I only told you that to persuade you to let her alone. Let her have  her own way. She says that to marry Curtis Keefe will save her from  prosecution&#8212;even from suspicion. She says he can free her from all implication  in the matter.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;By  a fraud?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  won&#8217;t have it! If Maida did that shooting she had ample excuse&#8212;motive, rather.  Not a man on a jury would convict her. And I&#8217;d rather she&#8217;d stand trial and&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no, Jeffrey, don&#8217;t talk like that! I&#8217;d consent to anything to save that girl  from a trial&#8212;oh, you can&#8217;t mean you want her tried!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rather  than to see her married to any man but me, I&#8217;d&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wait,  Jeff. We mustn&#8217;t be selfish. I&#8217;m her mother, and much as I&#8217;d hate to see her  marry Keefe, I&#8217;d far prefer it&#8212;for her sake, than&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No!  a thousand times, no! Why, I won&#8217;t give her up! Keefe is a fine man&#8212;I&#8217;ve  nothing against him&#8212;but she&#8217;s my Maida&#8212;my own little sweetheart&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  for that reason&#8212;for your own sake&#8212;you&#8217;re going to claim her?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  isn&#8217;t only for my own sake&#8221;&#8212;Jeff spoke more humbly; &#8220;but I know&#8212;I know how she  loves me. To let her marry another would be to do her a grievous wrong&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  if she wants to&#8212;look there!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Wheeler pointed from the window, and they saw Maida walking across the lawn in  deep and earnest conversation with Curtis Keefe. He was tall and handsome and  the deferential air and courteous attitude all spoke in his favor. Maida was  apparently listening with interest to his talk, and they went on slowly toward  the old sycamore and sat down on the bench beneath it.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Our  trysting-place!&#8221; Jeffrey murmured, his eyes fastened on the pair.</p>
  <p>It  did not require over-close observation to see that Maida was listening willingly  to Keefe. Nor was there room for doubt that he was saying something that  pleased her. She was brighter and more cheerful than she had been for days.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  see,&#8221; said Sara Wheeler, sadly. &#8220;And he is a worth-while man. Mr. Appleby  thought very highly of him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t!&#8221; said Allen, briefly, and unable to stand any more, he left the room.</p>
  <p>He  went straight to the two who were sitting under the big tree, and spoke  directly:</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  does this mean, Maida? Your mother tells me you&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let  me answer,&#8221; spoke up Keefe, gaily; &#8220;it means that Miss Wheeler has promised to  marry me. And we ask your congratulations.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Are  you not aware,&#8221; Jeff&#8217;s face was white but his voice was controlled and steady, &#8220;that  Miss Wheeler is my fiance?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hardly  that,&#8221; demurred Keefe. &#8220;I believe there was what is called an understanding,  but I&#8217;m assured it has never been announced. However, the lady will speak for  herself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go  away, Jeff,&#8221; Maida pleaded; &#8220;please, go away.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  until you tell me yourself, Maida, what you are doing. Why does Mr. Keefe say  these things?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is true.&#8221; Maida&#8217;s face was as white as Allen&#8217;s. &#8220;I am going to marry Mr. Keefe.  If you considered me bound to you, I&#8212;hereby break it off. Please go away!&#8221; the  last words were wrung from her in a choked, agonized voice, as if she were at  the end of her composure.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  going,&#8221; Allen said, and went off in a daze.</p>
  <p>He  was convinced of one thing only. That Maida was in the power of something or  some person&#8212;some combination of circumstances that forced her to this. He had  no doubt she meant what she said; had no doubt she would really marry Keefe&#8212;but  he couldn&#8217;t think she had ceased to love him&#8212;her own Jeffrey! If he thought  that, he was ready to die!</p>
  <p>He  walked along half blindly, thinking round in circles, always coming back to the  possibility&#8212;now practically a certainty&#8212;of Maida being the murderer, and  wondering how Keefe meant to save her from the clutches of the law. He was  perturbed&#8212;almost dazed, and as he went along unseeingly, Genevieve Lane met  him, turned and walked by his side.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s  Curtie Keefe doing with your girl?&#8221; she asked, for the rolling lawn was so free  of trees, the pair beneath the sycamore could be plainly seen.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know!&#8221; said Allen, honestly enough, as he looked in the good-humored face  of the stenographer.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t want him making love to her,&#8221; Miss Lane went on, pouting a little, &#8220;first,  because she&#8217;s altogether too much of a belle anyway; and second&#8212;because&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>She  paused, almost scared at the desperate gaze Allen gave her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  hope you mean because you look upon him as your property,&#8221; he said, but without  smiling.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  just why do you hope that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because  in that case, surely you can get him back&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  what an aspersion on Miss Wheeler&#8217;s fascinations!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hush;  I&#8217;m in no mood for chaffing. Are you and Keefe special friends?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Genevieve  looked at him a moment, and then said, very frankly: &#8220;If we&#8217;re not, it isn&#8217;t my  fault. And&#8212;to tell you the bald truth, we would have been, had not Miss Wheeler  come between us.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Are  you sure of that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  rude you are! But, yes&#8212;I&#8217;m practically sure. Nobody can be sure till they&#8217;re  certain, you know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  try to joke with me. Look here, Miss Lane, suppose you and I try to work  together for our respective ends.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Meaning  just what, Mr. Allen?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Meaning  that we try to separate Keefe and Maida&#8212;not just at this moment&#8212;but seriously  and permanently. You, because you want him, and I, because I want her. Isn&#8217;t it  logical?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  but if I could get him back, don&#8217;t you suppose I would?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  don&#8217;t get the idea. You&#8217;re to work for me, and I for you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh&#8212;I  try to make Maida give him up&#8212;and you&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  but we must have some pretty strong arguments. Now, have you any idea why Maida  has&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Has  picked him up with the tongs? I have a very decided idea! In fact, I know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  do! Is it a secret?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is. Such a big secret, that if it leaked out, the whole universe, so far as it  affects the Wheeler family, would be turned topsy-turvy!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Connected  with the&#8212;the death of Mr. Appleby?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not  with the murder&#8212;if that&#8217;s what you mean. But it was because of the death of Mr.  Appleby that the secret came to light.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can  you tell me?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8212;but do I want to?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What  would make you want to?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why&#8212;only  if you could do what you sort of suggested&#8212;make Mr. Keefe resume his attentions  to poor little Genevieve and leave the lovely Maida to you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  how can I do that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Dunno,  I&#8217;m sure! Do you want me to tell you the secret, and then try to get my own  reward by my own efforts?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  I don&#8217;t know what I want! I&#8217;m nearly distracted. But&#8221;&#8212;he pulled himself  together&#8212;&#8221;I&#8217;m on the job! And I&#8217;m going to accomplish something&#8212;a lot! Now, I&#8217;m  not going to dicker with you. Size it up for yourself. Don&#8217;t you believe that  if you told me that secret&#8212;confidentially&#8212;except as it can be used in the  furtherance of right and happiness for all concerned&#8212;don&#8217;t you believe that I  might use it in a way that would incidentally result in a better adjustment of  the present Keefe-Wheeler combination?&#8221; He nodded toward the two under the  sycamore.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221;  Genevieve said, slowly and thoughtfully, &#8220;I thought of telling Mr. Stone&#8212;but&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell  me first, and let me advise you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  will; I have confidence in you, Mr. Allen, and, too, it may be a good thing to  keep the secret in the family. The truth is, then, that Mrs. Wheeler is not  legally the heir to this estate.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  is, if she lives in Massachusetts, and the house is so built&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  fiddlesticks! I don&#8217;t mean that part of it. The estate is left with the proviso  that the inheritor shall live in Massachusetts&#8212;but, what I mean is, that it isn&#8217;t  left to Mrs. Wheeler at all. She thought it was, of course&#8212;but there is another  heir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  there? I&#8217;ve often heard them speak of such a possibility but they never could  find a trace of one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  know it, and they&#8217;re so honest that if they knew of one they&#8217;d put up no fight.  I mean if they knew there is a real heir, and that Sara Wheeler is not the  right inheritor.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  is?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Curtis  Keefe!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no! Miss Lane, are you sure?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  am. I discovered it from Mr. Appleby&#8217;s private papers, since his death.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Does  Keefe know it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course; but he doesn&#8217;t know I know it. Now, see here, Mr. Allen, get this. Mr.  Appleby knew it when he came down here. He&#8212;this is only my own theory, but I&#8217;ll  bet it&#8217;s the right one&#8212;he had discovered it lately; Keefe didn&#8217;t know it. My  theory is, that he came down here to hold that knowledge as a club over the  head of Mr. Wheeler to force him to do his, Appleby&#8217;s, bidding in the campaign  matters. Well, then&#8212;he was killed to prevent the information going any farther.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Killed  by whom?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Genevieve  shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;I can&#8217;t say. Any one of the three Wheelers might have  done it for that reason.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  you&#8217;re wrong. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Wheeler would have. They&#8217;d give up the place  at once.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Your  mental reservation speaks for itself! That leaves Maida! Suppose she knew it  and the rest didn&#8217;t. Suppose, in order to keep the knowledge from her parents&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  go on!&#8221; he begged. &#8220;I see it&#8212;maybe it was so. But&#8212;what next?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Next&#8212;alas,  Curt Keefe has fallen a victim to Maida&#8217;s smiles. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s making more  trouble than anything else. I&#8217;m positive he is arguing that if she will marry  him he will keep quiet about his being the heir. Then, her parents can live  here in peace for the rest of their lives.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  begin to see.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  knew you would. Now, knowing this, and being bound to secrecy concerning it,  except, as you agreed, if it can serve our ends, where do we go from here?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Allen  looked at her steadily. &#8220;Do you expect, Miss Lane, that I will consent to keep  this secret from the Wheelers?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll  have to,&#8221; she returned, simply. &#8220;Maida knows it, therefore it&#8217;s her secret now.  If she doesn&#8217;t want her parents told&#8212;you can&#8217;t presume to tell them!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Allen  looked blank. &#8220;And you mean, she&#8217;d marry Keefe, to keep the secret from her  parents?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Exactly  that; and there&#8217;d be no harm in keeping the secret that way, for if Curt Keefe  were her husband, it wouldn&#8217;t matter whether he was the rightful heir or not,  if he didn&#8217;t choose to exercise or even make known his rights.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  see. And&#8212;as to the&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  murder?&#8221; Genevieve helped him. &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know. If Maida did it&#8212;and I can&#8217;t  see any way out of that conclusion, Curt will do whatever he can to get her off  easily. Perhaps he can divert suspicion elsewhere&#8212;you know he made up that  bugler man, and has stuck to him&#8212;maybe he can get a persons unknown verdict&#8212;or  maybe, with money and influence, he can hush the whole thing up&#8212;and,  anyway&#8212;Maida would never be convicted. Why, possibly, the threat of Mr.  Appleby&#8212;if he did threaten&#8212;could be called blackmail. Anyhow, if there&#8217;s a  loophole, Curtis Keefe will find it! He&#8217;s as smart as they make &#8216;em. Now, you  know the probabilities&#8212;almost the inevitabilities, I might say, what are we  going to do about it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Something  pretty desperate, I can tell you!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Fine  talk, but what&#8217;s the first step?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  you want to know what I think?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  sure do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,  I say, let&#8217;s take the whole story to Fleming Stone&#8212;and at once.&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore17"></a>Chapter 17 <br>
Maida And Her Father</b></h2>
  <p>Genevieve  hesitated. Although she had thought of doing this herself, yet she was not  quite sure she wanted to.</p>
  <p>But  Allen insisted.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come  with me or not, as you choose,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but I&#8217;m going to tell Stone. A secret  like that must be divulged&#8212;in the interests of law and justice and&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Justice  to whom?&#8221; asked Genevieve.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  to all concerned.&#8221; Allen stopped to think. &#8220;To&#8212;to Keefe, for one,&#8221; he  concluded, a little lamely.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  and to yourself for two!&#8221; Genevieve exclaimed. &#8220;You want the secret to come out  so Maida won&#8217;t marry Curt to keep it quiet! Own up, now.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Allen  couldn&#8217;t deny this, but back of it was his instinctive desire for justice all  round, and he doggedly stuck to his determination of laying the matter before  Fleming Stone.</p>
  <p>Genevieve  accompanied him, and together they sought Stone in his sitting-room.</p>
  <p>Fibsy  was there and the two were in deep consultation.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come  in,&#8221; Stone said, as his visitors appeared. &#8220;You have something to tell me, I  gather from your eager faces.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We  have,&#8221; Allen returned, and he began to tell his story.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let  me tell it,&#8221; Miss Lane interrupted him, impatiently. &#8220;You see, Mr. Stone, Mr.  Allen is in love with Miss Wheeler, and he can&#8217;t help coloring things in her  favor.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you&#8217;re in love with Mr. Keefe,&#8221; Stone said, but without a smile, &#8220;and you can&#8217;t  help coloring things in his favor.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  girl bridled a little, but was in no way embarrassed at the assertion.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Take  your choice, then,&#8221; she said, flippantly. &#8220;Who do you want to tell you the  secret we&#8217;re ready to give away?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Both,&#8221;  Fibsy spoke up. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s a worth-while yarn, and we&#8217;ll hear both sides&#8212;if  you please. Ladies first; pipe up, Miss Lane.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The  actual secret can be quickly told,&#8221; the girl said, speaking a little shortly. &#8220;The  truth is, that Mrs. Wheeler is not the legal heir to this estate of Sycamore  Ridge&#8212;but, Mr. Keefe is.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Curtis  Keefe!&#8221; Stone exclaimed, and Fibsy gave a sharp, explosive whistle.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  said Genevieve, well pleased at the sensation her words had produced.</p>
  <p>Not  that her hearers made any further demonstration of surprise. Stone fell into a  brown study, and Fibsy got up and walked up and down the room, his hands in his  pockets, and whistling softly under his breath.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well!&#8221;  the boy said, finally, returning to his chair. &#8220;Well, F. Stone, things is  changed since gran&#8217;ma died! Hey?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In  many ways!&#8221; Stone assented. &#8220;You&#8217;re sure of this, of course?&#8221; he asked  Genevieve. &#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  I learned it from Mr. Appleby&#8217;s papers&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Private  papers?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  of course. He didn&#8217;t have &#8216;em framed and hanging on his wall. You see, Mr.  Keefe, being Mr. Appleby&#8217;s confidential secretary, had access to all his papers  after the old gentleman died.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;His  son?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course, young Sam is the heir, and owns everything, but he kept Curt on, in the  same position, and so, Curt&#8212;Mr. Keefe went over all the papers. As stenographer  and general assistant, I couldn&#8217;t very well help knowing the contents of the  papers and so I learned the truth, that Mr. Keefe, who is of another branch of  the family, is really the principal heir to the estate that is now in Mrs.  Wheeler&#8217;s possession. I can&#8217;t give you all the actual details, but you can, of  course, verify my statements.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course,&#8221; mused Stone. &#8220;And Mr. Keefe hasn&#8217;t announced this himself&#8212;because&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  it,&#8221; Genevieve nodded assent to his meaning glance. &#8220;Because he wants to marry  Maida, and if she&#8217;ll marry him, he&#8217;ll keep quiet about the heirship. Or,  rather, in that case, it won&#8217;t matter, as the elder Wheelers can live here if  it&#8217;s the property of their son-in-law. But, if not, then when Mr. Keefe walks  in&#8212;the Wheeler family must walk out. And where would they go?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can take care of them,&#8221; declared Allen. &#8220;Maida is my promised wife; if she  consents to marry Keefe, it will be under compulsion. For she knew this secret,  and she dared not tell her people because it meant poverty and homelessness for  them. You know, Mr. Wheeler is incapable of lucrative work, and Mrs. Wheeler,  brought up to affluence and comfort, can&#8217;t be expected to live in want. But I  can take care of them&#8212;that is, I could&#8212;if they could only live in Boston. My  business is there, and we could all live on my earnings if we could live  together.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  boy&#8212;for young Allen seemed scarcely more than a boy&#8212;was really thinking aloud  as he voiced these plans and suggestions. But he shook his head sadly as he  realized that Daniel Wheeler couldn&#8217;t go to Boston, and that a marriage between  Keefe and Maida was the only way to preserve to them their present home.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Some  situation!&#8221; remarked Fibsy. &#8220;And the secret is no secret really, for if Miss  Wheeler doesn&#8217;t marry Mr. Keefe, he&#8217;ll tell it at once. And if she does, the  whole matter doesn&#8217;t matter at all! But I think she will, for what else can she  do?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Jeffrey  Allen looked angrily at the boy, but Fibsy&#8217;s funny little face showed such a  serious interest that it was impossible to chide him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  think she won&#8217;t!&#8221; Allen said, &#8220;but I&#8217;m not sure just yet how I&#8217;m going to  prevent it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  won&#8217;t have to,&#8221; said Stone; &#8220;Miss Wheeler will prevent it herself&#8212;or I miss my  guess!&#8221; He looked kindly at the young man, but received only a half smile in  return.</p>
  <p>&#8220;If  we all do our share in the matter, perhaps we can arrange things,&#8221; Genevieve  said, speaking very seriously. &#8220;I&#8217;ve something to say, for I am engaged to  Curtis Keefe myself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Does  he think you are?&#8221; Stone said, rather casually.</p>
  <p>Miss  Lane had the grace to blush, through her rouge, but she declared: &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t  want to,&#8221; and added, &#8220;but he ought to. He has made love to me, and he once  asked me to marry him. But since then he has said he didn&#8217;t mean it. I don&#8217;t  suppose I&#8217;ve enough evidence for a breach of promise suit, but&#8212;oh, well,&#8221; and  she tossed her pretty head, &#8220;I&#8217;ve not the least doubt that if Miss Wheeler were  out of the question&#8212;say, safely married to Mr. Allen, I&#8217;d have no trouble in  whistling my Curtie back.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  bet you wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221; Fibsy looked at her admiringly. &#8220;If I were only a few years  older&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hush,  Terence,&#8221; said Fleming Stone, &#8220;don&#8217;t talk nonsense.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Immediately  Fibsy&#8217;s face became serious and he turned his attention away from the  fascinating Genevieve.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  all this is aside the question of the murderer, Mr. Stone,&#8221; said Allen. &#8220;How  are you progressing with that investigation?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Better  than I&#8217;ve disclosed as yet,&#8221; Stone returned, speaking slowly; &#8220;recent  developments have been helpful, and I hope to be ready soon to give a report.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  expect Mr. Appleby down?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  to-night or to-morrow. By that time I hope to be ready to make an arrest.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maida!&#8221;  cried Jeffrey, the word seeming wrung from him against his will.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Forgive  me, if I do not reply,&#8221; said Stone, with an earnest glance at the questioner. &#8220;But  I&#8217;d like to talk to Miss Wheeler. Will you go for her, Mr. Allen?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;d&#8212;I&#8217;d  rather not&#8212;you see&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  I see,&#8221; said Stone, kindly. &#8220;You go, Fibs.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  go,&#8221; offered Genevieve, with the result that she and McGuire flew out of the  room at the same time.</p>
  <p>&#8220;All  right, Beauteous One, we&#8217;ll both go,&#8221; Fibsy said, as they went along the hall  side by side. &#8220;Where is the lady?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Donno;  but we&#8217;ll find her. I say, Terence, come down on the veranda just a minute,  first.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Leading  him to a far corner, where there was no danger of eavesdroppers, Genevieve made  another attempt to gain an ally for her own cause.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  say,&#8221; she began, &#8220;you have a lot of influence with your Mr. Stone, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  heaps!&#8221; and Fibsy&#8217;s sweeping gesture indicated a wide expanse of imagination,  at least.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  fooling; I know you have. Now, you use that influence for me and I&#8217;ll do  something for you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll  you do?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t know; nothing particular. But, I mean if, at any time I can help you in  any way&#8212;I&#8217;ve influence, too, with big men in the financial and business world.  I haven&#8217;t always worked for the Applebys, and wherever I&#8217;ve been I&#8217;ve made  friends that I can count on.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  you mean a tip on the stock market or something of that sort?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  or a position in a big, worth-while office. You&#8217;re not always going to be a  detective&#8217;s apprentice, are you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  bet I am! Watcha talking about? Me leave F. Stone! Not on your fleeting  existence! But, never mind that part of the argument, I&#8217;ll remember your offer,  and some day, when I have a million dollars to invest, I&#8217;ll ask your advice  where to lose it. But, now, you tell me what you want.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only  for you to hint to Mr. Stone that he&#8217;d better advise Miss Wheeler not to marry  Mr. Keefe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So&#8217;s  you can have him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never  mind that. There are other reasons&#8212;truly there are.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  then, my orders are to advise F. Stone to advise M. Wheeler not to wed one C.  Keefe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s  just it. But don&#8217;t say it right out to him. Use tact, which I know you  have&#8212;though nobody&#8217;d guess it to look at you&#8212;and sort of argue around, so he&#8217;ll  see it&#8217;s wiser for her not to marry him&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Miss  Lane stamped her foot impatiently. &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying why. That&#8217;s enough for me to  know. You&#8217;ll get along better not knowing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Does  he know she&#8217;s the&#8212;the&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t wonder you can&#8217;t say it! I can&#8217;t, either. Yes, he knows she&#8217;s&#8212;it&#8212;but he&#8217;s  so crazy about her, he doesn&#8217;t care. What is there in that girl that gets all  the men!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  her sweetness,&#8221; said Fibsy, with a positive nod of his head, as if he were simply  stating an axiom. &#8220;Yep, Keefe is clean gone daffy over her. I don&#8217;t blame  him&#8212;though, of course my taste runs more to&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  you dare!&#8221; cried Genevieve, coquettishly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;To  the rouged type,&#8221; Fibsy went on, placidly. &#8220;To my mind a complexion dabbed on  is far more attractive than nature&#8217;s tints.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Miss  Lane burst into laughter and, far from offended, she said:</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  a darling boy, and I&#8217;ll never forget you&#8212;even in my will; now, to come back to  our dear old brass tacks. Will you tip a gentle hint to the great Stone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  lord, yes&#8212;I&#8217;ll tip him a dozen&#8212;tactfully, too. Don&#8217;t worry as to my discretion.  But I don&#8217;t mind telling you I might as well tip the Washington monument. You  see, F. S. has made up his mind.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  to the murderer?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  is it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t  an idea&#8212;and if I had, I&#8217;d say I hadn&#8217;t. You see, I&#8217;m his trusty.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  well, in any case, you can put in a word against Mr. Keefe, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  Genevieve had lost interest in her project. She realized if Mr. Stone had  accomplished his purpose and had solved the murder mystery he would be apt to  take small interest in the love affairs of herself or Maida Wheeler, either.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  won&#8217;t think much of his cherished trusty, if you don&#8217;t do the errand he sent  you on,&#8221; she said, rather crossly.</p>
  <p>Fibsy  gave her a reproachful glance. &#8220;This, from you!&#8221; he said, dramatically. &#8220;Farewell,  fair but false! I go to seek a fairer maiden, and I know where to find her!&#8221;</p>
  <p>He  went flying across the lawn, for he had caught a glimpse of Maida in the  garden.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss  Wheeler,&#8221; he said, as he reached her, &#8220;will you please come now to see Mr.  Stone? He wants you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221;  she replied, and turning, followed him.</p>
  <p>Genevieve  joined them, and the three went to Stone&#8217;s rooms.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss  Wheeler,&#8221; the detective said, without preamble, &#8220;I want you to tell me a few  things, please. You&#8217;ll excuse me if my questions seem rather pointed, also, if  they seem to be queries already answered. Did you kill Mr. Appleby?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  said Maida, speaking wearily, as if tired of making the assertion.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  know no one believes that statement?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  can&#8217;t help that, Mr. Stone,&#8221; she said, with a listless manner.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  is, no one but one person&#8212;your father. He believes it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Father!&#8221;  exclaimed the girl in evident amazement.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  he believes you for the best of all possible reasons: He saw you shoot.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What,  Mr. Stone? My father! Saw me shoot Mr. Appleby!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  he says so. That is not strange, when, as you say, you fired the pistol from  where you stood in the bay window, and Mr. Wheeler stood by or near the victim.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But&#8212;I  don&#8217;t understand. You say, father says he <i>saw</i> me?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  he told me that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maida  was silent, but she was evidently thinking deeply and rapidly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;This  is a trap of some sort, Mr. Stone,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;My father didn&#8217;t see me  shoot&#8212;he couldn&#8217;t have seen me, and consequently he couldn&#8217;t say he did! He  wouldn&#8217;t lie about it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  he said, at one time, that he did the shooting himself. Was not that an  untruth?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  a quite different sort. He said that in a justifiable effort to save me. But  this other matter&#8212;for him to say he saw me shoot&#8212;when he didn&#8217;t&#8212;he couldn&#8217;t&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  couldn&#8217;t he, Miss Wheeler? Why was it so impossible for your father to see you  commit that crime, when he was right there?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because&#8212;because&#8212;oh,  Mr. Stone, I don&#8217;t know what to say! I feel sure I mustn&#8217;t say anything, or I  shall regret it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Would  you like your father to come here and tell us about it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;&#8212;or,  yes. Oh, I don&#8217;t know. Jeffrey, help me!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Allen  had sat silently brooding all through this conversation. He had not looked at Maida,  keeping his gaze turned out of the window. He was sorely hurt at her attitude  in the Keefe matter; he was puzzled at her speech regarding her father; and he  was utterly uncertain as to his own duty or privilege in the whole affair. But  at her appeal, he turned joyfully toward her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  Maida,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;let me help you. Do get your father here, now, and settle  this question. Then, we&#8217;ll see what next.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Call  him, then,&#8221; said Maida, but she turned very white, and paid no further  attention to Allen. She was still lost in thought, when her father arrived and  joined the group.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  said, Mr. Wheeler,&#8221; Stone began at once, &#8220;that you saw your daughter fire the  shot that killed Mr. Appleby?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  did say that,&#8221; Daniel Wheeler replied, &#8220;because it is true. And because I am  convinced that the truth will help us all better than any further endeavor to  prove a falsehood. I did see you, Maida darling, and I tried very hard to take  the blame myself. But it has been proved to me by Mr. Stone that my pretence is  useless, and so I&#8217;ve concluded that the fact must come out, in hope of a better  result than from concealment. Do not fear, my darling, no harm shall come to  you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you said you did it, father, and mother said she did it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  of course, I told your mother the truth, and we plotted&#8212;yes, plotted for each  of us to confess to the deed, in a wild hope of somehow saving our little girl.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you saw me shoot, father?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,  yes, dear&#8212;that is, I heard the shot, and looked up to see you standing there  with consternation and guilt on your dear face. Your arm had then dropped to  your side, but your whole attitude was unmistakable. I couldn&#8217;t shut my eyes to  the evident fact that there was no one else who could have done the deed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There  must have been, father&#8212;for&#8212;I didn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  knew you didn&#8217;t! Oh, Maida!&#8221; With a bound Allen was at her side and his arm  went round her. But she moved away from him, and went on talking&#8212;still in a  strained, unnatural voice, but steadily and straightforwardly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No;  I didn&#8217;t shoot Mr. Appleby. I&#8217;ve been saying so, to shield my father. I thought  he did it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maida!  Is it possible?&#8221; and Daniel Wheeler looked perplexed. &#8220;But, oh, I&#8217;m so glad to  hear your statement.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  who did do it, then?&#8221; Miss Lane asked, bluntly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  cares, so long as it wasn&#8217;t any of the Wheelers!&#8221; exclaimed Jeffrey Allen,  unable to contain his gladness. &#8220;Oh, Maida&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>But  again she waved him away from her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t understand, Mr. Stone,&#8221; she began; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where these disclosures  will lead. I hope, not back to my mother&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Maida,&#8221; said her father, &#8220;there&#8217;s no fear of that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Reassured,  Maida went on. &#8220;Perhaps I can&#8217;t be believed now, after my previous insistence  on my guilt, but God knows it is the truth; I am utterly innocent of the crime.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  believe it,&#8221; said Fleming Stone. &#8220;There was little evidence against you, except  your own confession. Now you&#8217;ve retracted that it only remains for me to find  the real criminal.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can  you,&#8221; cried Fibsy excitedly, &#8220;can you, F. Stone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t  you know which way to look, Terence?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do&#8212;and I don&#8217;t&#8212;&#8221; the boy murmured; &#8220;oh, lordy! I do&#8212;and&#8212;I don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  there&#8217;s another matter to be agreed upon,&#8221; said Maida, who had not at all  regained her normal poise or appearance. Her face was white and her eyes  blurred with tears. But she persisted in speech.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  want it understood that I am engaged to marry Mr. Keefe,&#8221; she said, not looking  at Jeffrey at all. &#8220;I announce my engagement, and I desire him to be looked  upon and considered as my future husband.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maida!&#8221;  came simultaneously from the lips of her father and Allen.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  that is positive and irrevocable. I have my own reasons for this, and one of  them is&#8221;&#8212;she paused&#8212;&#8221;one very important one is, that Mr. Keefe knows who shot  Mr. Appleby, and can produce the criminal and guarantee his confession to the  deed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221;  Fibsy remarked, explosively, and Fleming Stone stared at the girl.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  used this as an argument to persuade you to marry him, Miss Wheeler?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  don&#8217;t put it that way, Mr. Stone, but I have Mr. Keefe&#8217;s assurance that he will  do as I told you, and also that he will arrange to have a full and free pardon  granted to my father for the old sentence he is still suffering under.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  Maida, I don&#8217;t wonder you consented,&#8221; said Miss Lane, her round eyes wide with  surprise. &#8220;And I suppose he&#8217;s going to renounce all claim to this estate?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  said Maida, calmly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Anything  else?&#8221; said Allen, unable to keep an ironic note out of his voice.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  put in Fibsy, &#8220;he&#8217;s going to be governor of Massachusetts.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  my heavens and earth!&#8221; gasped Genevieve, &#8220;what rubbish!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rubbish,  nothing!&#8221; Fibsy defended his statement. &#8220;You know he&#8217;s after it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  felt sure he would, when Sam Appleby gave up the running&#8212;but&#8212;I didn&#8217;t know he  had taken any public steps.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never  mind what Mr. Keefe is going to do, or not going to do,&#8221; said Maida, in a tone  of finality, &#8220;I expect to marry him&#8212;and soon.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,&#8221;  said Stone, in a business-like way, &#8220;I think our next one to confer with must  be Mr. Keefe.&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sycamore18"></a>Chapter 18  <br>
A Final Confession</b></h2>
  <p>Inquiry  for Keefe brought the information that he had gone to a nearby town, but would  be back at dinner-time.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Appleby was also expected to arrive for dinner, coming from home in his motor  car.</p>
  <p>But  in the late afternoon a severe storm set in. The wind rose rapidly and gained great  velocity while the rain fell steadily and hard. Curtis Keefe arrived, very wet  indeed, though he had protecting clothing. But a telephone message from Sam  Appleby said that he was obliged to give up all idea of reaching Sycamore Ridge  that night. He had stopped at a roadhouse, and owing to the gale he dared not  venture forth again until the storm was over. He would therefore not arrive  until next day.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Lucky  we got his word,&#8221; said Mr. Wheeler. &#8220;This storm will soon put many telephone  wires out of commission.&#8221;</p>
  <p>When  Keefe came down at the dinner hour, he found Maida alone in the living-room,  evidently awaiting him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;My  darling!&#8221; he exclaimed, going quickly to her side, &#8220;my own little girl! Are you  here to greet me?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  she said, and suffered rather than welcomed his caressing hand on her shoulder.  &#8220;Curtis, I told them you would tell them who killed Mr. Appleby.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So  I will, dearest, after dinner. Let&#8217;s not have unpleasant subjects discussed at  table. I&#8217;ve been to Rushfield and I&#8217;ve found out all the particulars that I  hadn&#8217;t already learned, and&#8212;I&#8217;ve got actual proofs! Now, who&#8217;s a cleverer  detective than the professionals?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then  that&#8217;s all right. Now, are you sure you can also get father freed?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  hope to, dear. That&#8217;s all I can say at present. Do you take me for a magician?  I assure you I&#8217;m only an ordinary citizen. But I&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you promised&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  my little love, I did, and I well know that you promised because I did! Well, I  fancy I shall keep every promise I made you, but not every one as promptly as  this exposure of the criminal.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But  you&#8217;ll surely fix it so father can go into Massachusetts&#8212;can go to Boston?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  rather! I expect&#8212;though you mustn&#8217;t say anything about it&#8212;but I&#8217;ve an idea that  you may yet be a governor&#8217;s wife! And it wouldn&#8217;t do then to have your father  barred from the state!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Maida  sighed. The hopes Keefe held out were the realization of her dearest  wishes&#8212;but, oh, the price she must pay! Yet she was strong-willed. She  determined to give no thought whatever to Jeffrey, for if she did she knew her  purpose would falter. Nor did she even allow herself the doubtful privilege of  feeling sorry for him. Well she knew that that way madness lay. And, thought  the poor child, sad and broken-hearted though Jeff may be, his sadness and heartbreak  are no worse than mine. Not so bad, for I have to take the initiative! I have  to take the brunt of the whole situation.</p>
  <p>The  others assembled, and at dinner no word was said of the tragedy. Save for Maida  and Jeffrey Allen, the party was almost a merry one.</p>
  <p>Daniel  Wheeler and his wife were so relieved at the disclosure of Maida&#8217;s innocence  that they felt they didn&#8217;t care much what happened next. Fibsy flirted openly  with Genevieve and Fleming Stone himself was quietly entertaining.</p>
  <p>Later  in the evening they gathered in the den and Keefe revealed his discoveries.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  felt all along,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that there was&#8212;there must have been a man on the  south veranda who did the shooting. Didn&#8217;t you think that, Mr. Stone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  did at times,&#8221; Stone replied, truthfully. &#8220;I confess, though my opinion changed  once or twice.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  at the present moment?&#8221; insisted Keefe.</p>
  <p>&#8220;At  the present moment, Mr. Keefe, your attitude tells me that you expect to prove  that there was such a factor in the case, so I would be foolish indeed to say I  doubted it. But, to speak definitely&#8212;yes, I do think there was a man there, and  he was the murderer. He shot through the window, past Miss Wheeler, and most  naturally, her father thought she fired the shot herself. You see, it came from  exactly her direction.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;&#8221;  agreed Keefe, &#8220;and moreover, you remember, Rachel saw the man on the  veranda&#8212;and the cook also saw him&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;the  cook saw him!&#8221; Fibsy put in, and though the words were innocent enough, his  tone indicated a hidden meaning.</p>
  <p>But  beyond a careless glance, Keefe didn&#8217;t notice the interruption and went on,  earnestly:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  the man the servants saw was the murderer. And I have traced him, found him,  and&#8212;secured his signed confession.&#8221;</p>
  <p>With  unconcealed pride in his achievement, Keefe took a folded paper from his pocket  and handed it to Daniel Wheeler.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why  the written confession? Where is the man?&#8221; asked Stone, his dark eyes alight  with interest.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221;  muttered Fibsy, under his breath, &#8220;going some!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Genevieve  Lane stared, round-eyed and excited, while Allen and the Wheelers breathlessly  awaited developments.</p>
  <p>&#8220;John  Mills!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Wheeler, looking at the paper. &#8220;Oh, the faithful old man!  Listen, Stone. This is a signed confession of a man on his death-bed&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No  longer that,&#8221; said Keefe, solemnly, &#8220;he died this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  signed this just before he died?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Mr. Wheeler. In the hospital. The witnesses, as you see, are the nurses there.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The  paper merely stated that the undersigned was the slayer of Samuel Appleby. That  the deed was committed in order to free Daniel Wheeler from wicked and unjust  molestation and tyranny. The signature, though faintly scrawled, was perfectly  legible and duly witnessed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  was an old servant of mine,&#8221; Wheeler said, thoughtfully, &#8220;and very devoted to  us all. He always resented Appleby&#8217;s attitude toward me&#8212;for Mills was my butler  when the trouble occurred, and knew all about it. He has been an invalid for a  year, but has been very ill only recently.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Since  the shooting, in fact,&#8221; said Keefe, significantly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  must have been a hard task for one so weak,&#8221; Wheeler said, &#8220;but the old fellow  was a true friend to me all his life. Tell us more of the circumstances, Mr.  Keefe.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  did it all by thinking,&#8221; said Keefe, his manner not at all superior, nor did he  look toward Fleming Stone, who was listening attentively. &#8220;I felt sure there  was some man from outside. And I thought first of some enemy of Mr. Appleby&#8217;s.  But later, I thought it might have been some enemy of Mr. Wheeler&#8217;s and the  shot was possibly meant for him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Wheeler  nodded at this. &#8220;I thought that, too,&#8221; he observed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,  then later, I began to think maybe it was some friend&#8212;not an enemy. A friend,  of course, of Mr. Wheeler&#8217;s. On this principle I searched for a suspect. I  inquired among the servants, being careful to arouse no suspicion of my real  intent. At last, I found this old Mills had always been devoted to the whole  family here. More than devoted, indeed. He revered Mr. Wheeler and he fairly  worshipped the ladies. He has been ill a long time of a slow and incurable  malady, and quite lately was taken to the hospital. When I reached him I saw  the poor chap had but a very short time to live.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you suspected him of crime with no more evidence than that?&#8221; Fleming Stone  asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  daresay it was a sort of intuition, Mr. Stone,&#8221; Keefe returned, smiling a  little at the detective. &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t wonder you feel rather miffed to have  your thunder stolen by a mere business man&#8212;and I fear it&#8217;s unprofessional for  me to put the thing through without consulting you, but I felt the case  required careful handling&#8212;somewhat psychological handling, indeed&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very  much so,&#8221; Stone nodded.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  so,&#8221; Keefe was a little disconcerted by the detective&#8217;s demeanor, but others  set it down to a very natural chagrin on Stone&#8217;s part.</p>
  <p>Fibsy  sat back in his chair, his bright eyes narrowed to mere slits and darting from  the face of Keefe to that of Stone continually.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  so,&#8221; Keefe went on, &#8220;I inquired from the servants and also, cautiously from the  members of the family, and I learned that this Mills was of a fiery, even  revengeful, nature&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  was,&#8221; Mr. Wheeler nodded, emphatically.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  sir. And I found out from Rachel that&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rachel!&#8221;  Fibsy fairly shot out the word, but a look from Stone made him say no more.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Rachel, the maid,&#8221; went on Keefe, &#8220;and I found that the man she saw on the  veranda was of the same general size and appearance as Mills. Well, I somehow  felt that it was Mills&#8212;and so I went to see him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;At  the hospital?&#8221; asked Wheeler.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  some days ago. He was then very weak, and the nurses didn&#8217;t want me to arouse  him to any excitement. But I knew it was my duty&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course,&#8221; put in Stone, and Keefe gave him a patronizing look.</p>
  <p>&#8220;So,  against the wishes of the nurses and doctors, I had an interview alone with  Mills, and I found he was the criminal.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He  confessed?&#8221; asked Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  and though he refused to sign a written confession, he agreed he would confess  in the presence of Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Stone. But&#8212;that was only this  morning&#8212;and the doctor assured me the man couldn&#8217;t live the day out. So I  persuaded the dying man to sign this confession, which I drew up and read to  him in the presence of the nurses. He signed&#8212;they witnessed&#8212;and there it is.&#8221;</p>
  <p>With  evident modesty, Keefe pointed to the paper still in Wheeler&#8217;s hands, and said  no more.</p>
  <p>For  a moment nobody spoke. The storm was at its height. The wind whistled and  roared, the rain fell noisily, and the elements seemed to be doing their very  worst.</p>
  <p>Genevieve  shuddered&#8212;she always was sensitive to weather conditions, and that wind was  enough to disturb even equable nerves.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  this same Mills was the phantom bugler?&#8221; asked Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;he  told me so,&#8221; returned Keefe. &#8220;He knew about the legend, you see, and he thought  he&#8217;d work on the superstition of the family to divert attention from himself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Genevieve  gasped, but quickly suppressed all show of agitation.</p>
  <p>Fibsy  whistled&#8212;just a few notes of the bugle call that the &#8220;phantom&#8221; had played.</p>
  <p>At  the sound Keefe turned quickly, a strange look on his face, and the Wheelers,  too, looked startled at the familiar strain.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Be  quiet, Terence,&#8221; Stone said, rather severely, and the boy subsided.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,  Mr. Keefe,&#8221; Fleming Stone said, &#8220;you must not think&#8212;as I fear you do&#8212;that I  grudge admiration for your success, or appreciation of your cleverness. I do  not. I tell you, very sincerely, that what you have accomplished is as fine a  piece of work as I have ever run across in my whole career as detective. Your  intuition was remarkable and your following it up a masterpiece! By the way, I suppose  that it was Mills, then, who started the fire in the garage?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  it was,&#8221; said Keefe. &#8220;You see, he is a clever genius, in a sly way. He reasoned  that if a fire occurred, everybody would run to it except Mr. Wheeler, who  cannot go over the line. He hoped that, therefore, Mr. Appleby would not go  either&#8212;for Mr. Appleby suffered from flatfoot&#8212;at any rate, he took a chance  that the fire would give him opportunity to shoot unnoticed. Which it did.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  certainly did. Now, Mr. Keefe, did he tell you how he set that fire?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  he did not,&#8221; was the short reply. &#8220;Moreover, Mr. Stone, I resent your mode of  questioning. I&#8217;m not on the witness stand. I&#8217;ve solved a mystery that baffled  you, and though I understand your embarrassment at the situation, yet it does  not give you free rein to make what seem to me like endeavors to trip me up!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Trip  you up!&#8221; Stone lifted his eyebrows. &#8220;What a strange expression to use. As if I  suspected you of faking his tale.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  speaks for itself,&#8221; and Keefe glanced nonchalantly at the paper he had brought.  &#8220;There&#8217;s the signed confession&#8212;if you can prove that signature a fake&#8212;go ahead.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221;  said Daniel Wheeler, decidedly; &#8220;that&#8217;s John Mills&#8217; autograph. I know it  perfectly. He wrote that himself. And a dying man is not going to sign a lie.  There&#8217;s no loophole of doubt, Mr. Stone. I think you must admit Mr. Keefe&#8217;s  entire success.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do admit Mr. Keefe&#8217;s entire success,&#8221; Stone&#8217;s dark eyes flashed, &#8220;up to this  point. From here on, I shall undertake to prove my own entire success, since  that is the phrase we are using. Mr. Wheeler, your present cook was here when  John Mills worked for you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She  was, Mr. Stone, but you don&#8217;t need her corroboration of this signature. I tell  you I know it to be Mills&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Will  you send for the cook, please?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Half  unwillingly, Wheeler agreed, and Maida stepped out of the room and summoned the  cook.</p>
  <p>The  woman came in, and Stone spoke to her at once.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  that John Mills&#8217; signature?&#8221; he asked, showing her the paper.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It  is, sir,&#8221; she replied, looking at him in wonder.</p>
  <p>A  satisfied smile played on Keefe&#8217;s face, only to be effaced at Stone&#8217;s next  question.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  was John Mills the person you saw&#8212;vaguely&#8212;on the south veranda that night of  Mr. Appleby&#8217;s murder?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  he was not!&#8221; she cried, emphatically. &#8220;It was a man not a bit like Mills, and  be the same token, John Mills was in his bed onable to walk at all, at all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That  will do, Mr. Wheeler,&#8221; and Stone dismissed the cook with a glance. &#8220;Now, Mr.  Keefe?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As  if that woman&#8217;s story mattered,&#8221; Keefe sneered, contemptuously, &#8220;she is merely  mistaken, that&#8217;s all. The word of the maid, Rachel, is as good as that of the  cook&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh,  no, it isn&#8217;t!&#8221; Stone interrupted, but, paying no heed to him, Keefe went on; &#8220;and  you can scarcely doubt the signature after Mr. Wheeler and your friend the cook  have both verified it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Though  his demeanor was quiet, Keefe&#8217;s face wore a defiant expression and his voice  was a trifle blustering.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do not doubt the signature,&#8221; Stone declared, &#8220;nor do I doubt that you obtained  it at the hospital exactly as you have described that incident.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Keefe&#8217;s  face relaxed at that, and he recovered his jaunty manner, as he said: &#8220;Then you  admit I have beaten you at your own game, Mr. Stone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,  Mr. Keefe, but I have beaten you at yours.&#8221;</p>
  <p>A  silence fell for a moment. There was something about Stone&#8217;s manner of speaking  that made for conviction in the minds of his hearers that he said truth.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wait  a minute! Oh, wait a minute!&#8221; It was Genevieve Lane who cried out the words,  and then she sprang from her chair and ran to Keefe&#8217;s side.</p>
  <p>Flinging  her arms about him, she whispered close to his ear.</p>
  <p>He  listened, and then, with a scornful gesture he flung her off.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No!&#8221;  he said to her; &#8220;no! a thousand times, no! Do your worst.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  shall!&#8221; replied Genevieve, and without another word she resumed her seat.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  went on Stone, this interruption being over, &#8220;your ingenious &#8216;success&#8217; in the  way of detecting is doomed to an ignominious end. You see, sir,&#8221; he turned to  Daniel Wheeler, &#8220;the clever ruse Mr. Keefe has worked, is but a ruse&#8212;a  stratagem, to deceive us all and to turn the just suspicion of the criminal in  an unjust direction.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Explain,  Mr. Stone,&#8221; said Wheeler, apparently not much impressed with what he deemed a  last attempt on the part of the detective to redeem his reputation.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,  Mr. Stone,&#8221; said Keefe, &#8220;if my solution of this mystery is a ruse&#8212;a stratagem&#8212;what  have you to offer in its place? You admit the signed confession?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  admit the signature, but not the confession. John Mills signed that paper, Mr.  Keefe, but he is not the murderer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who  is, then?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  are!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Keefe  laughed and shrugged his shoulders, but at that moment there was such a blast  of wind and storm, accompanied by a fearful crash, that what he said could not  be heard.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Explain,  please, Mr. Stone,&#8221; Wheeler said again, after a pause, but his voice now showed  more interest.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  will. The time has come for it. Mr. Wheeler, do you and Mr. Allen see to it,  that Mr. Keefe does not leave the room. Terence&#8212;keep your eyes open.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Keefe  still smiled, but his smile was a frozen one. His eyes began to widen and his  hands clenched themselves upon his knees.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Curtis  Keefe killed Samuel Appleby,&#8221; Stone went on, speaking clearly but rapidly. &#8220;His  motive was an ambition to be governor of Massachusetts. He thought that with  the elder Appleby out of the way, his son would have neither power nor  inclination to make a campaign. There were other, minor motives, but that was  his primary one. That, and the fact that the elder Appleby had a hold on Mr.  Keefe, and of late had pressed it home uncomfortably hard. The murder was long  premeditated. The trip here brought it about, because it offered a chance where  others might reasonably be suspected. Keefe was the man on the veranda, whom  the cook saw&#8212;but not clearly enough to distinguish his identity. Though she did  know it was not John Mills.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But&#8212;Mr.  Stone&#8212;&#8221; interrupted Wheeler, greatly perturbed, &#8220;think what you&#8217;re saying! Have  you evidence to prove your statements?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  have, Mr. Wheeler, as you shall see. Let me tell my story and judge me then. A  first proof is&#8212;Terence, you may tell of the bugle.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  went, at Mr. Stone&#8217;s orders,&#8221; the boy stated, simply, &#8220;to all the shops or  little stores in this vicinity where a bugle might have been bought; I found  one was bought in a very small shop in Rushfield and bought by a man who  corresponded to Mr. Keefe&#8217;s description, and who, when he stopped at the shop,  was in a motor car whose description and occupants were the Appleby bunch.  Well, anyway&#8212;Miss Lane here knows that Mr. Keefe bought that bugle&#8212;don&#8217;t you?&#8221;  He turned to Genevieve, who, after a glance at Keefe, nodded affirmation.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  so,&#8221; Stone went on, &#8220;Mr. Keefe used that bugle&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How  did he get opportunity?&#8221; asked Wheeler.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll  tell you,&#8221; offered Genevieve. &#8220;We all staid over night in Rushfield, and I  heard Mr. Keefe go out of doors in the night. I watched him from my window. He  returned about three hours later.&#8221;</p>
  <p>It  was clear to all listening, that when Genevieve had whispered to Keefe and he  had told her to do her worst, they were now hearing the &#8220;worst.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So,&#8221;  Stone narrated, &#8220;Mr. Keefe came over here and did the bugling as a preliminary  to his further schemes. You admit that, Mr. Keefe?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  admit nothing. Tell your silly story as you please.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  will. Then, the day of the murder, Mr. Keefe arranged for the fire in the  garage. He used the acids as the man Fulton described, and as Keefe&#8217;s own coat  was burned and his employer&#8217;s car he felt sure suspicion would not turn toward  him. When the fire broke out&#8212;which as it depended on the action of those acids,  he was waiting for, Keefe ran with Mr. Allen to the garage. But&#8212;and this I have  verified from Mr. Allen, Keefe disappeared for a moment, and, later was again  at Allen&#8217;s side. In that moment&#8212;Mr. Wheeler, that psychological moment, Curtis  Keefe shot and killed Samuel Appleby.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  Mills?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  part of the diabolically clever scheme. Mills was dying; he was leaving a large  family without means of support. He depended, and with reason, on hope of your  generosity, Mr. Wheeler, to his wife and children. But Curtis Keefe went to him  and told him that you were about to be dispossessed of your home and fortune,  and that if he would sign the confession&#8212;knowing what it was&#8212;that he, Keefe,  would settle a large sum of money on Mrs. Mills and the children at once. And  he did.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  fiend! You devil incarnate!&#8221; cried Keefe, losing all control. &#8220;How do you know  that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  found it all out from Mrs. Mills,&#8221; Stone replied; &#8220;your accomplices all  betrayed you, Mr. Keefe. A criminal should beware of accomplices. Rachel turned  state&#8217;s evidence and told how you bribed her to make up that story of the  bugler&#8212;or rather, to relate parrot-like&#8212;the story you taught to her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  all up,&#8221; said Keefe, flinging out his hands in despair. &#8220;You&#8217;ve outwitted me at  every point, Mr. Stone. I confess myself vanquished&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And  you confess yourself the murderer?&#8221; said Stone, quickly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  do, but I ask one favor. May I take that paper a moment?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221;  said Stone, glancing at the worthless confession.</p>
  <p>Keefe  stepped to the table desk, where the paper lay, but as he laid his left hand  upon it, with his right he quickly pulled open a drawer, grasped the pistol  that was in it, and saying, with a slight smile: &#8220;A life for a life!&#8221; drew the  trigger and fell to the floor.</p>
  <p>From  the gruesome situation, its silence made worse by the noise of the storm  outside, Daniel Wheeler led his wife and daughter. Jeffrey Allen followed  quickly and sought his loved Maida.</p>
  <p>Reaction  from the strain made her break down, and sobbing in his arms she asked and  received full forgiveness for her enforced desertion of him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  couldn&#8217;t do anything else, Jeff,&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;I had to say yes to him for dad&#8217;s  sake&#8212;and mother&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course you did, darling; don&#8217;t think about it. Oh, Maida, look! The wind has  torn up the sycamore! Unrooted it, and it has fallen over&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Over  into Massachusetts!&#8221; Maida cried; &#8220;Jeffrey, think what that means!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why&#8212;why!&#8212;&#8221;  Allen was speechless.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes;  the sycamore has gone into Massachusetts&#8212;and father can go!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is  that real, Maida&#8212;is it truly a permission?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of  course it is! We&#8217;ve got Governor Appleby&#8217;s letter, saying so&#8212;written when he  was governor, you know! Jeffrey&#8212;I&#8217;m so happy! It makes me forget that awful&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do  forget it all you can, dearest,&#8221; and beneath her lover&#8217;s caresses, Maida did  forget, for the moment at least.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s  the only inexplicable thing about it all, Fibs,&#8221; Fleming Stone observed, after  the case was among the annals of the past, &#8220;that the old sycamore fell over and  fell the right way.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mighty  curious, F. Stone,&#8221; rejoined the boy, with an expressionless face.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You  didn&#8217;t help it along, did you? You know the injunction was, &#8216;without intervention  of human hands.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I  didn&#8217;t intervent my hands, Mr. Stone,&#8221; said the boy, earnestly, &#8220;honest I didn&#8217;t.  But&#8212;it wasn&#8217;t nominated in the bond that I shouldn&#8217;t kick around those old  decaying roots with my foot&#8212;just so&#8217;s if it <i>should</i> take a notion to fall it would fall heading north!&#8221;</p>

    Miss Lucy Carrington</b></h2>
  <p>&#8220;Garden Steps&#8221; was one of the show-places of  Merivale Park, Long Island. In summer it was an enchanting spot, and the  dazzling white marble steps which led to the sunken gardens justified their  right to give the place its name. Other stone steps gave on terraces and flower  banks, others still led to the Italian landscape gardens, and a few rustic  steps of a wooden stile transported one to an old-fashioned garden, whose  larkspur and Canterbury bells were the finest of their sort.</p>
  <p>The house seemed an integral part of this  setting. Its wide verandahs, or more often loggias, were so lavishly furnished  with flowering plants, its windows so boxed with them, that the whole effect  was that of a marvellously well-planned horticultural exhibition.</p>
  <p>But all this was of the summer. In winter&#8212;for it  was an all-round-the-year home&#8212;only the varied and extraordinary collection of evergreens  shared with the steps the honor of making picturesque and beautiful the view  from the house windows.</p>
  <p>And now, in January, one of the all too seldom  enjoyed white snow storms had glorified the whole estate. Wind-swept drifts  half hid, half disclosed the curving marble balustrades, and turned the steps  to snowy fairyland flights.</p>
  <p>And, for it was night, a cold, dear, perfect  winter night, a supercilious moon looked down, a little haughtily and  condescended to illumine the scene in stunning, if a bit theatric, fashion.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ripping picture, eh?&#8221; said Gray Haviland, as he  held back the heavy curtain for the golden-haired young woman at his side to  look out.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t it a wonderful sight!&#8221; And as Anita  Frayne took a step forward, toward the casement, Haviland let the curtain fall  behind him and the two were alone in the deep embrasure of the wide bay-window.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not nearly such a wonderful sight as you are!&#8221;  Haviland swung her round to face him, and stood gazing at the pretty, doll-like  face that half laughed, half frowned into his own.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Me! I&#8217;m not like a moonlit landscape!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re just a golden morsel of summer  sunshine&#8212;&#8221; Haviland&#8217;s eulogy was interrupted by a petulant voice calling  shrilly:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where are you two? I hear you talking; come on.  I&#8217;m waiting.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, Lord! come on,&#8221; and, holding the curtain  aside, he let Anita pass and then followed her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Here we are, Cousin Lucy, all ready for the  fray. Good evening, Count.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Count Charlier bowed Frenchily, and Anita gave  him the bright, flashing smile that she kept on hand for mankind in general,  and which was quite different from that she used on special occasions or for  special friends.</p>
  <p>Annoyed at the duration of this delaying smile,  Miss Lucy Carrington tapped impatiently on the bridge table, and looked her  impatience most unmistakably.</p>
  <p>Mistress of Garden Steps, wealthy, well-born, of  assured social position, capable and efficient, Miss Carrington lacked the one  gift of Fate for which she would have bartered all else. She was not beautiful,  and had not even enough pretension to good looks to think herself beautiful. Plain  features, graying hair&#8212;dyed red&#8212;big, prominent light-blue eyes, and a pasty,  pudgy complexion left no hope for the miracles worked by beauty doctors to  avail in her case. Her figure was short and dumpy, the despair of her  staymakers, and her taste in dress ran to the extremes in coloring and fashion.</p>
  <p>Passionately fond of all beauty, Miss Carrington  felt keenly her own lack of it, and to this lack she attributed the fact that  she was a spinster. Those who knew her felt there might be other reasons why  her suitors had been few, but, as a matter of fact, the acidity of her  disposition was a direct result of her disappointed, loveless life, and even  yet, though nearing fifty, Miss Lucy Carrington had by no means laid aside all thoughts  of matrimonial adventure.</p>
  <p>Heiress to immense wealth, there had been  fortune-seekers who asked her hand, but Lucy Carrington would none of these.  Aristocratic and high-minded, she had unerring perception of motives, and the  men who had been willing to marry her face as well as her fortune had been of such  unworth that the lady scorned them.</p>
  <p>But now, looming on her hopes&#8217; horizon was a  welcome possibility. Count Henri Charlier, a visitor of a neighbor, seemingly  admired the mistress of Garden Steps and had fallen into the habit of frequent  calling. Courteous and polished of manner, he flattered Miss Carrington in such  wise that his attitude was acceptable if not indubitably sincere. Her closest  scrutiny and most challenging provocation failed to surprise any admission of  her lack of perfection in his eyes, and his splendid physique and brilliant  mind commanded her complete approval and admiration. There had been hints that  his title could not be read entirely clear, but this was not sufficient to  condemn him in Miss Carrington&#8217;s eyes.</p>
  <p>To be sure, the Count had as yet said no word  that could be construed as of definite intention, but there had been certain  signs, deemed portentous by the willing mind of the lady in question.</p>
  <p>Bridge was Miss Carrington&#8217;s favorite diversion,  and, as the Count also enjoyed it, frequent evenings were devoted to the game.</p>
  <p>It was, perhaps, a mistake that Miss Carrington  should have allowed this, for her temper, always uncertain, lost all restraint  when she suffered ill-luck at cards. A poor hand always brought down violent  objurgation on the head of her partner and sarcastic comment or criticism on  her adversaries. These exhibitions of wrath were not good policy if she wished  to charm the French visitor, but, as he invariably kept his own temper, his  irate hostess made little effort to curb hers.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What are you doing, Anita?&#8221; cried Miss  Carrington, petulantly, as they settled themselves at the table. &#8220;You know I  always play with the blue cards, and you are dealing them!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sure enough! Pardon me, Lady Lucy, I will take  the red ones.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then, pray, wait till I make them up. There.  No, let the Count cut them! Have you no notion of bridge rules? You are quite  the most inattentive player! Will you kindly concentrate on the game?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; and Anita Frayne smiled as she  deftly dealt the red cards. &#8220;I hope you have a good hand.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You hope I have a good hand! A strange idea for  an adversary!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But I know you like to win,&#8221; and Miss Frayne  hastily gathered up her own cards.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I do not like to have you want me to win! That&#8217;s  babyish. I like to win by superior skill, not merely by lucky cards!&#8221;</p>
  <p>This was an awful whopper, and all at the table  knew it, but it was ignored and the game began.</p>
  <p>Miss Carrington&#8212;Lady Lucy, as she liked to be  called&#8212;did not hold good hands. On the contrary, she had a run of bad luck that  made her more and more irate with each hand dealt. Miss Frayne, who was her <i>protge </i>and social secretary, watched  with growing apprehension the red spots that appeared in Miss Carrington&#8217;s  cheeks, infallible danger signals of an impending outbreak.</p>
  <p>It came.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Another handful of blanks!&#8221; Miss Carrington  exclaimed, angrily, and flung the offending thirteen cards across the wide  room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There now, Cousin Lucy,&#8221; said Gray Haviland,  determined to keep the peace if possible, &#8220;that was a clever idea! It will  certainly change your luck! I&#8217;ll collect the pasteboards, and we&#8217;ll start  fresh.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Easily, the big, good-looking young chap  sauntered across the room and gathered up the cards, chatting meanwhile. &#8220;You  don&#8217;t lose your deal, you know; so try again, Cousin Lucy, and good luck to  you!&#8221;</p>
  <p>In angry silence Miss Carrington dealt again,  and examined her hand. &#8220;Nothing above a nine spot!&#8221; she declared, throwing  them, backs up, on the table.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Too bad!&#8221; murmured Miss Frayne, carelessly  picking up the hand. &#8220;Why, you didn&#8217;t look closely! Here&#8217;s an ace and two  queens and&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;They&#8217;re nothing! How dare you dispute my word?  I say the hand is worthless!&#8221; She fairly snatched the cards from the girl and  turned them face down again.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But mad&#8217;moiselle,&#8221; began the Count, &#8220;if you  have an ace and two queens, I could have played a no-trump hand grand,&#8212;ah,  splendid!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, <i>you</i> could have played it! You want to play all the open hands! You want me to sit  here a dummy, a figure-head, every time!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now, now, Lady Lucy&#8212;&#8221; and Anita Frayne laughed  pleasantly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Be quiet! You&#8217;re worse yet! You want to deal me  good hands to humor me! I believe you would cheat to do it! I don&#8217;t want good  cards that way!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; begged the Count, seeing Anita flush, &#8220;do  not tell the young lady she cheats! Do not do that!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell her what I choose! Gray, say  something! You sit there like a mummy, while these people are insulting me  right and left! Tell Anita that I am right in not wishing her to deal me good  cards purposely.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But she didn&#8217;t,&#8221; declared Haviland; &#8220;you know  she didn&#8217;t. Why, she couldn&#8217;t, even if she wanted to!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, yes, she could!&#8221; and Miss Carrington gave a  disagreeable sneer. &#8220;She&#8217;s quite clever enough for any deceit or treachery.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Stop, Cousin Lucy! I can&#8217;t let you talk so  about Miss Frayne in my presence!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t, can&#8217;t you? And, pray, what right  have you to defend her? Go away, both of you! I&#8217;ll play with you no longer. Go  away and send Pauline and Mr. Illsley in here. They, at least, will play fair.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Anita Frayne rose without a word. Haviland rose  too, but talking volubly. &#8220;Let up, Cousin Lucy,&#8221; he said sternly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve no  right to treat Miss Frayne so. You ought to apologize to her for such rudeness.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Apologize!&#8221; Miss Carrington fairly shrieked; &#8220;she&#8217;ll  do the apologizing, and you, too, my foolish young cousin. You little know what&#8217;s  going to happen to me! To-morrow you may sing another song!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Haviland looked at her in astonishment; the  Count, thoughtfully. The same idea was in both their minds. Could she mean that  she was expecting the Count to propose to her that evening?</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing nice can happen to you unless you learn  to control that temper of yours,&#8221; and Haviland swung away after Anita.</p>
  <p>He found her in the next room, nestled in the  corner of a big davenport, weeping into a sympathetic sofa-cushion.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go and find the others,&#8221; she whispered, as he  came near her. &#8220;Make them go and play with her!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Obediently, Haviland went. In the glassed  sun-parlor he found Pauline Stuart, Miss Carrington&#8217;s niece, and Stephen  Illsley, one of the most favored of Pauline&#8217;s many suitors.</p>
  <p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake, people,&#8221; he began, &#8220;do go  and play bridge with the Lady of the Manor! She&#8217;s in a peach of a fury, and you&#8217;ll  have to take your life in your hands, but <i>go!&#8221;</i></p>
  <p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Pauline, bluntly; &#8220;It&#8217;s Anita&#8217;s  turn to-night. She said she&#8217;d do it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She did! But she came off second best, and she&#8217;s  weeping buckets on the best Empire embroidery sofa-cushions! I&#8217;m going to  comfort her, but you must go and keep the gentle Lucy from pulling the house  down about our ears! She&#8217;s sure queering herself with his nibs! He can&#8217;t admire  her sweet, flower-like soul after this night&#8217;s exhibition.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go a bit, but I suppose we&#8217;ll  have to,&#8221; and Pauline smiled at her guest.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, go on,&#8221; said Haviland, as he turned to  leave them; &#8220;and, for Heaven&#8217;s sake, give her all the good cards. Can you  manage that, Illsley?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I am afraid not. Her eyes are too sharp.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, if her luck stays bad, get her to play  mumble-peg or something, instead of bridge.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Haviland disappeared and Pauline rose  unwillingly. &#8220;I do so hate to play with Aunt Lucy,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but it must be  done. Are you willing to sacrifice yourself?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;For you? Always!&#8221; And the two went to the  cardroom.</p>
  <p>Pauline Stuart, tall, dark, graceful, was a  striking-looking girl. Only twenty-four, she carried herself with the dignity  and poise of a duchess, and her heavy, dark brows gave her face an expression  of strength and will-power that contrasted forcibly with the delicate Dresden  china beauty of Anita Frayne. The two girls were not especially friendly, though  never definitely at odds. Anita was envious of the more fortunate Pauline. The  latter, Miss Carrington&#8217;s niece, would inherit a goodly part of her aunt&#8217;s  large fortune, while the humble position of the secretary commanded only a  liberal, not munificent, salary.</p>
  <p>The girls, however, were at one in their dread  of Miss Lucy&#8217;s ebullitions of temper and their resentment of the biting  sarcasms and angry diatribes she flung at them in her frequent spasms of fury.</p>
  <p>Illsley, a well-set-up chap of good address,  followed Pauline into her aunt&#8217;s presence.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You waited long enough,&#8221; grumbled Miss  Carrington. &#8220;Sit down. It&#8217;s your deal now, Pauline.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Matters went well for a time. Miss Lucy held  good cards, and once or twice she triumphed through a mistake of her  adversaries, which she fortunately did not discover was made on purpose.</p>
  <p>Count Charlier&#8217;s little bright black eyes darted  inquiringly from aunt to niece, but he made no comment. All four played well,  and when at last Miss Carrington made a grand slam her joy was effervescent.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good play,&#8221; she flattered herself. &#8220;You must  admit, Count, that it was clever of me to take that difficult <i>finesse</i> just at that critical point.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Clever indeed, mademoiselle. You have the  analytical mind; you should have been a diplomat. Also, Fortune favors you. You  are beloved of the fickle goddess.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let us hope so,&#8221; and for a moment Miss  Carrington looked grave.</p>
  <p>And then, with the perversity of that same  goddess, the card luck changed. Pauline and Illsley held all the high cards,  Miss Lucy and the Count only the low ones.</p>
  <p>Storm signals showed. Whiter grew the stern, set  face; tighter drew the thin, wide lips; and rigid muscles set themselves in the  angry, swelling throat. Then, as she scanned a hand of cards, all below the  ten, again they went in a shower across the room, and she cried, angrily: &#8220;A Yarborough!&#8221;  reverting to the old-fashioned term.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never mind, Aunt Lucy,&#8221; and Pauline tried to  laugh it off; &#8220;this is not your lucky night. Let&#8217;s give up bridge for to-night.  Let&#8217;s have some music.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes! because you love music and hate bridge! It  makes no difference what <i>I</i> want. My  wishes are never considered. You and Anita are just alike! Selfish, ungrateful,  caring for nothing but your own pleasure. Mr. Illsley, don&#8217;t you think young  girls should pay some slight attention to the wishes of one who does everything  for them? Where would either of them be but for me? Are you not sorry for me?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why,&#8212;I&#8212;you must excuse me, I am not sure I  understand&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, you understand, perfectly well. You know  the girls slight me and snub me every chance they get. But it will not always  be thus. To-morrow&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come, Aunt Lucy,&#8221; pleaded Pauline, &#8220;let us have  some music. You know there are some new records, just arrived to-day. Let us  hear them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Are there new records? Did you get the ones I  wanted?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Some of them. We couldn&#8217;t get them all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, no, of course not! But if <i>you</i> had wanted certain records they would  have been found!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But, Auntie Lucy, we couldn&#8217;t get them if they  aren&#8217;t made, could we? Gray tried his best.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, tried his best! He forgot to ask for them,  so he says he &#8216;tried his best,&#8217; to excuse his carelessness. If Anita had wanted  them&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>The starting of the music drowned further flow  of the lady&#8217;s grievances.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades2">Chapter</a> 2<br>
    A Clash Of Tongues</b></h2>
  <p>True to its reputation for calming the impulses  of the turbulent spirit, the music soothed Miss Carrington&#8217;s ruffled temper,  and she waxed amiable and even gay. Enthroned on her favorite red velvet chair,  resplendent in an elaborately decorated gown of sapphire blue satin, with her  bright auburn locks piled high and topped by an enormous comb of carved tortoise-shell,  she dominated the little group and gave orders that must be obeyed.</p>
  <p>She wore, among other jewels, a magnificent rope  of pearls. So remarkable were these, that the Count, who had never seen them  before, ventured to refer to them.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Miss Carrington, &#8220;they are  wonderful. Practically priceless, I assure you. It took my agent years to  collect them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And you grace an informal home evening with  these regal gems?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not usually, no. But you know, Count Charlier,  pearls must be worn frequently to preserve their lustre. Laid away a long time,  they grow dead and dull-looking.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You keep them here? Is it safe, think you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t keep them here all the time. Indeed, I  got these from the Safe Deposit only this morning. I shall return them there in  a few days. While here, I shall wear them all I can to liven them up.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You brought a lot of your other jewels, didn&#8217;t  you, Aunt Lucy?&#8221; said Pauline, casually; &#8220;why did you? Are you going to a ball?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No: I wish to&#8212;to look them over and plan to  have some reset.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But are they safe?&#8221; inquired the Count again; &#8220;do  you not fear thieves?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, we never have such things as robbery in Merivale  Park. It is a quiet, well-behaved neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But you have a safe?&#8221; went on the Count; &#8220;you  take at least that precaution?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I have a safe in my boudoir. There is  really no danger. Count Charlier, would you like to hear me sing? Find one of  my records, Gray.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Miss Carrington&#8217;s singing voice had been a fine  one and was still fair. She sometimes amused herself by making records for her  phonograph, and Gray Haviland managed the mechanical part of it.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Which one, Lady Lucy?&#8221; he asked, as he rummaged  in the record cabinet.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Any of those pretty love songs,&#8221; and Miss  Carrington glanced coyly at the Count.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a fine one,&#8221; and Haviland placed a disk  in the machine.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; he said, smiling; &#8220;don&#8217;t miss the  introduction.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The needle touched the record, and Miss Lucy&#8217;s  laugh rang out, so clear and true, it was difficult to believe it was a  recorded laugh and not a sound from the lady herself. Then the recorded voice  said: &#8220;This song is one of Carr&#8217;s favorites, I&#8217;ll sing it for him.&#8221; And then,  with only a few seconds&#8217; interval, Miss Carrington&#8217;s voice sang, &#8220;Believe me,  if all those endearing young charms.&#8221;</p>
  <p>It was well sung, and a perfect record, so that  the incident of the singer listening to her own voice was interesting in  itself.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Capital!&#8221; applauded the Count, as it was  finished. &#8220;It is indeed pleasant to preserve one&#8217;s songs thus. May I not some  time record my own amateur attempt?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Delighted to have you, Count,&#8221; said Haviland,  cordially. &#8220;Come over some morning, and we&#8217;ll do up a lot of records.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Since when have you been master here, Gray?&#8221;  said Miss Lucy, with fine scorn. &#8220;I will give the invitations to my own house,  if you please! Count Charlier, if you will come to-morrow afternoon I will  instruct Mr. Haviland to make the records.&#8221;</p>
  <p>It was not so much the words as the manner of  their utterance that was offensive, and Haviland set his lips in stifled anger.  It was not at all unusual, this sort of rebuff, but he could not endure it as  patiently as the two girls did. Haviland was a second cousin of Miss  Carrington, and, while he lived with her in the capacity of a business  secretary and general man of affairs, the post was a sinecure, for the services  of her lawyer and of her social secretary left little for Haviland to do. His salary  was a generous one and he was substantially remembered in her will, but he  sometimes thought the annoying and irritating fleers he had to accept  smilingly, were worth more than he was receiving. He was continually made to  feel himself a dependent and an inferior.</p>
  <p>These trials also fell to the lot of the two  girls. Pauline, although her aunt&#8217;s heiress to the extent of half the fortune,  the other half to go to an absent cousin, was by no means treated as an equal  of Miss Carrington herself. It seemed to give the elder lady delight to  domineer over her niece and in every possible way make her life uneasy and  uncomfortable. As to the social secretary, Miss Frayne, she was scolded for  everything she did, right or wrong.</p>
  <p>Often had the three young people declared intentions  of leaving Garden Steps, but so far none of them had made good the threat.</p>
  <p>Vanity was the key-note of Lucy Carrington&#8217;s  nature, and, knowing this, they could, if they chose, keep her fairly  sweet-tempered by inordinate flattery often administered. This proceeding hurt  their self-respect, jarred their tempers, and galled their very souls, but it  was that or dismissal, and thus far they had stayed. Matters were nearing a  crisis, however, and Haviland&#8217;s patience was so sorely strained that he was secretly  looking for another position. Anita Frayne, whose pretty blonde doll-face  belied a very fiery disposition, was on the verge of a serious break with her  employer, and Pauline Stuart continually assured herself that she could not go  on this way.</p>
  <p>Pauline was the orphaned daughter of Lucy&#8217;s  sister, and had lived with her aunt for many years. Carrington Loria, the son  of another sister, was engaged in antiquarian research in Egypt, where he had  been since his graduation as an engineer. He, too, was an orphan and had lived  with Lucy in his younger days, and he and Pauline were equal heirs to their  aunt&#8217;s wealth.</p>
  <p>The father of the three Carrington sisters,  having become angered at his two daughters who married against his wishes, had  left his entire fortune to Lucy, his only remaining child. Thus her niece and  nephew were her only direct heirs, and, save for some comparatively small  bequests, the Carrington estate would eventually be theirs.</p>
  <p>Pauline well knew that if she left her aunt&#8217;s  roof it meant complete disinheritance, for Lucy Carrington was proud of her  beautiful niece, and, too, was fond of her in her own way. But the ungovernable  temper of the lady made her home an almost unbearable abiding-place.</p>
  <p>Since childhood years Carrington Loria had lived  there only during his college vacations; but had been back occasionally for  short visits from his now permanent Egyptian occupation. He had always come  laden with gifts of Oriental products, and the rooms at Garden Steps showed  many rare specimens of cunning handiwork and rich fabrics and embroideries.</p>
  <p>To break the awkward pause that followed Miss  Carrington&#8217;s rude speech to Gray Haviland, Pauline picked up an antique scarab  from a side table and drew the Count&#8217;s attention to its inscription.</p>
  <p>He expressed a polite interest, but cast furtive  glances at his hostess, as if afraid of a further outbreak.</p>
  <p>Nor were his fears unjustified. Miss Carrington  administered a scathing reproach to Pauline for intruding herself upon the  Count&#8217;s attention, and bade her put aside the scarab and hold her tongue.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak to me like that, Aunt Lucy; I am  not a child!&#8221; And Pauline, unable to control herself longer, faced her angry  aunt with an air of righteous wrath.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll speak to you as I choose, miss! It is for  you to mend your tone in addressing me! If you don&#8217;t, you may have cause to  regret it. Count Charlier came here to see me, and I refuse to countenance your  clumsy attempts to engage his interest in your silly babble!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But&#8212;I insist&#8212;&#8221; stammered the greatly  embarrassed Count, &#8220;allow me, madame, let me say, I call on you all&#8212;all&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort!&#8221; declared Miss Lucy; &#8220;you  came, Count, to play bridge with us. Our opponents behaved so rudely and played  so badly it was impossible for us to continue the game. Nor can we enjoy music  in this inharmonious atmosphere. Let us stroll in the conservatory, you and I.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She rose, trailing her heavy silks and flashing  her sparkling jewels, and the Count, a little hesitatingly, followed her. They  crossed the great hall, and, going through a reception room and the delightful  sun-parlor, came to the warm, heavily-scented conservatory.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Poor old Charlier!&#8221; said Haviland, as the pair  disappeared; &#8220;he&#8217;s in for it now! Do you suppose the palms and orchids will  bring him up to the scratch? &#8216;Nita, I&#8217;ll bet you a box of gloves against a box  of simple little cigarettes that he doesn&#8217;t propose to the lady to-night?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Done!&#8221; cried Miss Frayne, who was sparkling  again, now that the dread presence was removed. &#8220;I doubt he can help himself.  She has him at her mercy. And he&#8217;s too good-mannered to disappoint her wish.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll propose,&#8221; said Pauline, with an air of  conviction. &#8220;He&#8217;s a typical fortune-hunter, that man. Indeed, I am not sure he&#8217;s  a Count at all. Do you know, Mr. Illsley?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I know almost nothing of the man, save that he&#8217;s  a guest of the Frothinghams. That&#8217;s not entirely in his favor, I think.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Right you are!&#8221; agreed Haviland. &#8220;Those people  are,&#8212;well, they&#8217;re to be queried. But I say, Polly, if the two do hit it off,  it&#8217;s grinding poverty for us, eh?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It may be a blessed relief, Gray. She&#8217;ll give  us something, of course, and send us away from here. I, for one, shouldn&#8217;t be  sorry to go. She is getting too impossible!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She is!&#8221; put in Anita; &#8220;every day she pounds us  worse! I&#8217;d like to kill her!&#8221;</p>
  <p>The fierce words and would-be menacing glance of  the little blonde beauty were about as convincing as a kitten declaring himself  a war lord, and even the stately Pauline smiled at the picture.</p>
  <p>&#8220;She ought to be killed,&#8221; declared Haviland, &#8220;and  I say this dispassionately. I wouldn&#8217;t do it, because killing is not in my  line, but the eternal fitness of things requires her removal to another sphere  of usefulness. She makes life a burden to three perfectly good people, and some  several servants. Not one would mourn her, and&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, stop, Gray!&#8221; cried Pauline; &#8220;don&#8217;t talk in  that strain! Don&#8217;t listen to him, Mr. Illsley. He often says such things, but  he doesn&#8217;t mean them. Mr. Haviland loves to talk at random, to make a  sensational hearing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort, Polly. I do mean it. Lucy  Carrington is a misery dispenser, and such are not wanted in this nice little  old world.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But perhaps,&#8221; Pauline looked thoughtful, &#8220;the  fault is in us. We don&#8217;t like her, and so we see nothing good in what she does.  Now, Carrington Loria adores her. She had a letter from him to-day&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, Loria adores her!&#8221; interrupted Haviland, &#8220;because  he doesn&#8217;t live with her! She sends him love-letters and money, and he doesn&#8217;t  know the everlasting torture of living under her roof, year in and year out!  But he caught on a little the last time he was here. He said,&#8212;well, in his quaint  Oriental fashion, he said, &#8216;Gee! she&#8217;s the limit!&#8217; that&#8217;s what he said.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, she is,&#8221; pouted Anita. &#8220;I can&#8217;t do a  thing to suit her. To-day I wrote a letter over six times before she was  satisfied. And every change she wanted made was so foolish she wanted it  changed back again. She nearly drove me crazy!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But I have to put up with her morning, noon,  and night,&#8221; sighed Pauline. &#8220;You have your hours off, Anita, but I never do.  She even wakens me in the night to read to her, or to help her plan her new  gowns.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It is awfully hard for you,&#8221; began Mr. Illsley,  and then all stopped short, for the object of their discussion returned to the  room.</p>
  <p>It was plain to be seen Miss Carrington was in a  state of suppressed excitement. She giggled almost hysterically, and tapped the  Count playfully on the arm with her fan, as she bade him say good-night and go.</p>
  <p>The interested ones watching her could not learn  whether the Count had declared himself or not. The presumption was negative,  for, had he done so, surely Miss Carrington would have told the good news.</p>
  <p>Charlier himself was distinctly non-committal.  Debonair as always, he made his adieux, no more demonstrative to his hostess  than to the others, and went away. Illsley followed, and the household  dispersed. The clock struck midnight as the ladies went upstairs.</p>
  <p>Following custom, they all three went to Miss  Lucy&#8217;s boudoir. It was by way of reporting for to-morrow&#8217;s orders, and was a  duty never neglected.</p>
  <p>The exquisite apartment, from which opened the  bedroom and bath, was softly lighted and fragrant with flowers.</p>
  <p>&#8220;How do you like Count Henri Charlier?&#8221; Miss  Carrington quickly demanded of her satellites.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Charming,&#8221; said the voluble Anita. &#8220;Just a  typical French nobleman, isn&#8217;t he? And how he adores our Lady Lucy!&#8221;</p>
  <p>The whole speech rang false, but the vanity of  the lady addressed swallowed it as truest sincerity. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she returned, &#8220;he  is infatuated, I have reason to think. But&#8212;we shall see what we shall see! Curb  your impatience, girls! You shall know all in due time.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can I do anything for you, Auntie, to-night or  to-morrow?&#8221; asked Pauline, and, though she tried to speak with enthusiasm, her  tone did sound perfunctory.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not if you offer in that manner,&#8221; and Miss  Carrington looked at her niece coldly. &#8220;One would think, Pauline, that it must  be an irksome task to do the smallest favor for your aunt and benefactor! Do  you feel no pleasure in doing what trifles you can for one who does everything  for you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I would feel a pleasure, Aunt Lucy, if you were  kinder to me. But&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Kinder!&#8221; shrieked her aunt; &#8220;kinder! Girl, have  you taken leave of your senses? I give you a home, fine dresses, money,  everything you can want, and you ask me to be kinder to you! Go! never let me  see you again, after that speech!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, auntie, don&#8217;t! I didn&#8217;t mean&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t mean to exasperate me beyond  endurance? No, of course you meant to stop short of that! But you have done it.  I mean this, Pauline: to-morrow you go elsewhere to live. No longer will I give  a home to such a monster of ingratitude!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But, Miss Carrington&#8221;&#8212;and Anita Frayne&#8217;s soft  voice implored gently&#8212;&#8221;don&#8217;t be hasty. Pauline didn&#8217;t mean&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What!&#8221; and Lucy Carrington turned on her, &#8220;you  take her part? Then you go, too! I want no ingrates here. Leave me, both of  you. This night is your last beneath this roof! You are two unworthy girls, to  scorn and slight the hand that has fed and clothed you and given you luxury and  comfort such as you will never see again! Go, I&#8217;ve done with you! Send me Estelle.  She, at least, has some small affection for me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The two girls left the room. The scene was not  without precedent. Before this they had been ordered to leave the house  forever, but always forgiveness and reinstatement had followed. This time,  however, the Lady Lucy had been rather more in earnest, and the girls looked at  each other uncertainly as they turned toward their rooms.</p>
  <p>Anita summoned Estelle, the French maid, and  then told her to hasten immediately to Miss Carrington.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t undress me,&#8221; said the mistress as the  maid appeared; &#8220;I&#8217;m not retiring at once. Get me out of this gown and give me a  neglige and slippers.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, mademoiselle,&#8221; and Estelle deftly obeyed  orders and brought a white boudoir gown edged with swans-down.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not that!&#8221; cried Miss Carrington. &#8220;Bring the  gold-embroidered one,&#8212;the Oriental.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah, the green one, from Monsieur Loria?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, the one my nephew sent me at Christmas  time. My, but it&#8217;s handsome, isn&#8217;t it, Estelle?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Gorgeous!&#8221; declared the maid, and she spoke  truly. Young Loria knew his aunt&#8217;s taste, and he had sent her a typical  Egyptian robe, of pale green silk, heavy with gold embroideries. In it Miss  Carrington looked like one attired for a masquerade.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Shall I take down mademoiselle&#8217;s hair?&#8221; asked  Estelle, lingering.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No. I want to be alone. I will read awhile. You  need not return. I will do for myself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There is your glass of milk, ma&#8217;mzelle, on the  bed-table.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Silly! I suppose I can see it for myself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. And you will have your tea at eight  in the morning?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of course, my tea at eight. As always. You  might remember that much yourself. But nobody remembers things for <i>my</i> comfort.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Pardon, but sometimes it is eight, and, again,  it must be half-past.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Eight! Now, will you go? You are most  exasperating! Why do you stand there like a gibbering idiot?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The jewels, mademoiselle; the pearls? Shall I  not put them in safety?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No! I will put them in the safe myself. Where  is the key?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There, mademoiselle, on your dresser. But if I  might&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You mayn&#8217;t do anything except to get out and  stay out! Do you hear? Shall I never be obeyed?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, mademoiselle; good-night.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The soft tone was fully belied by the evil glare  of the French girl&#8217;s eyes, but that was not seen by Miss Lucy Carrington.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>Chapter <a name="Blades3">3</a><br>
    The Tragedy</b></h2>
  <p>The house faced the east, and, built on an  English model, was far wider than deep. A broad hall ran through the centre  from front to back, and on either side there were successive rooms whose  windows looked out on equally beautiful scenes, both front and back. On the  right of the hall, as one entered, was the long living room, and beyond it, the  library and music room. The other side of the hall was a reception room,  opening into the sun parlor, and on to the conservatory, and back of these, the  dining room and smaller breakfast room.</p>
  <p>Breakfast was served at nine, and the members of  the family were usually all present. Miss Carrington, herself, made a point of  being on time partly from habit, and also because it gave her opportunity to  chide those who were late.</p>
  <p>When she was not in her place, on the morning  after the stormy bridge game, Pauline expressed surprise, and Haviland echoed  her words.</p>
  <p>But Anita said scornfully, &#8220;She went to bed in  an awful tantrum and probably didn&#8217;t sleep well.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Miss Frayne was looking her prettiest, and her  roseleaf face with its fluffy golden halo, was like a Greuze picture. She wore  a frivolous little house gown of blue crpe de chine that just matched her forget-me-not  eyes. Not especially appropriate garb for a secretary, but Miss Carrington  preferred her household to be well-dressed, and really commanded pretty tints  and fabrics for the two girls. Pauline was in white serge, of rather severe  cut, but which suited her as no frills and flounces could. Her black hair was  smoothly parted and coiled low over her ears, and her clear ivory-tinted skin  was flushed faintly pink from the glow of the big, crackling wood fire.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s most unusual,&#8221; went on Pauline, after a  few moments more had passed, and the Lady Lucy had not appeared. &#8220;I&#8217;m going up  to see if she is ill,&#8212;or&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Or merely in a tantrum extraordinary!&#8221; said  Anita, her blue eyes full of laughing disrespect for her employer.</p>
  <p>&#8220;&#8216;Nita,&#8221; said Haviland, as Pauline disappeared, &#8220;hold  your breakfast napkin up in front of your face, quick!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said the girl, wonderingly, as she did  his bidding.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because, if you hadn&#8217;t, I should have flown at  you and kissed you! And I mustn&#8217;t now, for Haskins is approaching with muffins.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Down came the shielding napkin and only the  arrival of the muffin-laden Haskins saved the lovely laughing face from  Haviland&#8217;s impetuous caress.</p>
  <p>The old butler fussed about, and several minutes  passed, when Pauline called from above stairs, &#8220;Gray! Come here, at once!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Desperate case!&#8221; and Haviland rose, and  unhurriedly left the room, pinching Anita&#8217;s little ear as he passed her.</p>
  <p>Another moment and Miss Frayne heard an  exclamation from Haviland that made her rise from the table and go flying  upstairs herself.</p>
  <p>The door of Miss Lucy&#8217;s boudoir was open, and  entering, she saw Pauline and Haviland with horror-stricken faces, gazing at a  terrible sight.</p>
  <p>Miss Lucy Carrington, seated before her  dressing-table, her face white and ghastly, her large eyes staring wide&#8212;staring  horribly,&#8212;but, without doubt, unseeing. Nor was this all of the strangeness of  the sight. She was robed in an embroidered Oriental-looking gown, and wore many  jewels. Her red-dyed hair, dressed elaborately, as she had worn it the night before,  was still crowned with the enormous comb of carved tortoise-shell, but the comb  was broken to bits. One portion, still standing upright, rose above the  disordered coiffure, but the rest, in broken scraps, lay scattered over the  puffs of hair,&#8212;over the white hands clasped in her lap,&#8212;and on the floor at her  feet.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; whispered Anita,  shuddering, &#8220;is she&#8212;is she dead?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Haviland, briefly. He stood,  hands in pockets, gazing at the startling figure.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who?&#8212;What?&#8212;&#8221; Anita&#8217;s eyes riveted themselves on  something else.</p>
  <p>Around the neck of Miss Lucy was,&#8212;yes, it <i>was</i>&#8212;a snake!</p>
  <p>With a low scream, Anita flung herself into  Haviland&#8217;s arms, but he put her gently away from him.</p>
  <p>Aghast at this repulse, Anita put her hand  across her eyes and turned to leave the room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mind where you go, &#8216;Nita!&#8221; called out Haviland,  and the girl stopped just in time to save herself from stepping into a mass of <i>dbris</i>.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;why, it&#8217;s Miss Lucy&#8217;s tray!&#8221;</p>
  <p>It was. The silver tray that had held the  breakfast tea was on the floor, and near it a jumbled heap of silver and broken  china that had once been a costly Sevres set. Dainty white serviettes were  stained with the spilled tea and a huge wet spot was near the overturned silver  teapot.</p>
  <p>Hastily Anita ran from the room, but she sank  down on a couch in the hall just outside the door, utterly unable to go  further.</p>
  <p>Fascinated by the beady eyes of the green snake,  Pauline stared at it, with clenched hands. Haviland stepped nearer and lightly  touched it.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is it&#8212;is it alive?&#8221; gasped Pauline.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s paper,&#8221; replied Haviland quietly. &#8220;A paper  snake, a toy,&#8212;you know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But who put it there? Aunt Lucy is deathly  afraid of snakes! Did fright kill her? Gray, is she&#8212;murdered?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, Pauline, she has been killed. But could it  be&#8212;fright? Impossible!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not for her! You don&#8217;t know her horror of  snakes. Why, going through the Japanese department of a shop, I&#8217;ve seen her  turn white and fairly fly from the counter where those paper things were  displayed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But what else killed her? There is no wound, no  shot, no blood.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Get the doctor, Gray! Don&#8217;t wait a minute.  Telephone at once.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He can do nothing, Pauline. She is dead.&#8221;  Haviland spoke like a man in a daze.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But no matter, we must call him. Shall I?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, I will.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go into her bedroom,&#8212;use that telephone by her  bedside.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Obediently, Haviland went on to the adjoining  room, the soft rugs giving forth no sound of his footfalls.</p>
  <p>The door was ajar, and as he opened it, he  called, &#8220;Come here, Pauline; look, the night lights are burning, and the bed  untouched. She hasn&#8217;t been to bed at all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of course she hasn&#8217;t. She has her hair as it  was last evening. But her comb is broken.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Broken! It&#8217;s smashed! It&#8217;s in tiny bits! She  has been hit on the head,&#8212;don&#8217;t touch her, Pauline! You mustn&#8217;t! I&#8217;ll call Dr.  Stanton. You go out of the room. Go and find Anita.&#8221;</p>
  <p>But Pauline staid. Turning her back to the still  figure in the chair, she gazed curiously at the upset tray on the floor. She  stooped, when Haviland&#8217;s voice came sharply from the next room. &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch a  thing, Pauline!&#8221; he cried, as he held his hand over the transmitter.</p>
  <p>She looked up, and then as she saw him turn back  to speak into the instrument, she stooped swiftly and picking up something from  the floor she hurried from the room.</p>
  <p>She found Anita on the couch in the hall, and speaking  somewhat sharply, Pauline said, &#8220;Where&#8217;s Estelle?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mercy! I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; and Anita&#8217;s blue eyes  stared coldly. &#8220;How should I know anything about Estelle?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But she must have brought that tray an hour  ago. Did she upset it, or who?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Pauline, why do you act as if I knew anything  about this matter. Is it because <i>you</i> do?&#8221;</p>
  <p>The blue eyes, cold like steel, and the dark  ones, flashing fire from their shadows, looked steadily at each other.</p>
  <p>Gray Haviland came hurriedly out to the hall.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The doctor will be here at once,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and  he will call the coroner.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Coroner!&#8221; screamed Anita; and ran away to her  own room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let her alone,&#8221; said Pauline, contemptuously; &#8220;but  Gray, we must nerve ourselves up to this thing. Don&#8217;t you think we ought to&#8212;to  put away the jewels? It&#8217;s wrong to let any one come into a room where a fortune  in jewels is displayed like that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But Doctor Stanton said to touch nothing,&#8212;nothing  at all. You see, Pauline, in a murder case,&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, I know; &#8216;nothing disturbed till the Coroner  comes,&#8217; and all that. But this is different, Gray. Doctor Stanton didn&#8217;t know  there are two hundred thousand dollars&#8217; worth of jewelry on that&#8212;that&#8212;on her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How do you know so exactly?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not exact, but she has told me times enough  that the rope of pearls cost one hundred thousand, and that corsage ornament  she is wearing and her rings and ear-rings are easily worth the same sum. I  tell you there will be policemen here, and it isn&#8217;t right to throw temptation  in their way.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; and Anita&#8217;s voice spoke again as she  reappeared in the doorway, &#8220;besides, Pauline, they are all yours now, and you  should be careful of them!&#8221;</p>
  <p>The tone more than the words conveyed a veiled  insolence, and Pauline accepted it for such. With a sudden determined movement,  she went swiftly to her aunt&#8217;s side, and unfastened the long rope of pearls,  the wonderful glittering sunburst, and a large diamond and emerald crescent  that held together the glistening silk folds. The rings and ear-rings she could  not bring herself to touch.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It is only <i>right</i>,&#8221;  she contended, as if trying to persuade herself, &#8220;these are too valuable to  risk; no one could fail to be tempted by them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you finish your task?&#8221; said Anita,  smiling unpleasantly, &#8220;why leave so much?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No one would attempt to take the rings or  ear-rings,&#8221; said Pauline, steadily, &#8220;and that scarab bracelet is not of great  value.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I thought that was a most valuable antique that  her nephew sent her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She thought so, too,&#8221; said Pauline, carelessly,  &#8220;but Carr told me it was an imitation. Not one expert in a hundred can tell the  difference, anyway.&#8221;</p>
  <p>As Pauline placed the mass of gems in the safe,  the doctor came. &#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; cried the bewildered man, coming into the  room. &#8220;Miss Carrington&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>Words failed him as he saw the astounding sight.  For surely, no one had ever before seen a murdered woman, sitting before her  dressing-table, staring but smiling, and garbed as for a fancy-dress ball!</p>
  <p>Doctor Stanton touched the icy-cold hand, felt  for the silent heart, and then turned his attention to the disheveled hair and  broken comb.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Fractured skull,&#8221; he said, as his skilled  fingers thridded the auburn tresses. &#8220;Killed by a sudden, swift blow on the  head with a heavy, blunt,&#8212;no, with a soft weapon; a black-jack or sandbag.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A burglar!&#8221; exclaimed Pauline.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of course; who else would deal such a blow? It  was powerful,&#8212;dealt by a strong arm&#8212;it has driven bits of this broken shell  stuff into the brain. But it was the force of the concussion that killed her.  Here is a deep dent,&#8212;and yet.&#8212;Tell me the circumstances. Why is she rigged out  like this?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no idea,&#8221; answered Pauline, taking the  initiative. &#8220;When I left her last night, she had on an evening gown. But this  neglige is not unusual; it is one of her favorites. Though why she has on that  spangled scarf, I can&#8217;t imagine.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She seems to have been posing before the  mirror, rather than engaged in making a toilette.&#8221; Dr. Stanton was a pompous  middle-aged man of fussy manner. He did not again touch the body, but he  stepped about, noting the strange conditions and commenting on them. &#8220;This  paper snake,&#8212;tight round her neck! What does that mean?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What <i>can</i> it mean?&#8221; returned Pauline. &#8220;She had an intense hatred,&#8212;even <i>fear</i> of snakes; I&#8217;ve never seen it  before. Could it have been placed there to frighten her to death?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No; she didn&#8217;t die of fright. See, her  expression is placid,&#8212;even smiling. But the shattered comb and dented skull  have but one explanation,&#8212;a stunning blow. Did she have on the comb last  evening?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes; it is a favorite one with her. An heirloom,  from a Colonial ancestor. It encircled the entire back of her head, when whole.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;At what time was she killed?&#8221; asked Gray  Haviland. He had stood, till now, a silent listener to the conversation between  Pauline and the Doctor.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, many hours ago,&#8221; returned Stanton; &#8220;six or  eight at least. Evidently she was preparing for bed, and trying the effect of  some new finery.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Those things are not new,&#8221; put in Anita; &#8220;she  has had them all a long time. But she must have been admiring herself, for when  we found her she had on all her finest jewels.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What?&#8221; cried Dr. Stanton; &#8220;where are they?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I took most of them off,&#8221; replied Pauline,  quietly, &#8220;and put them in the safe. If the police people must come, I am not  willing to have a fortune in jewels here to tempt their cupidity. And I have a  right. It is no secret that my cousin Carrington and I are her heirs. But that  snake perplexes me beyond all else. If you knew her aversion to them,&#8212;even pictured  ones&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I do know it,&#8221; returned the doctor; &#8220;I have  often heard her say so. Ah,&#8221; as he stepped carefully about, &#8220;she <i>was</i> adorning herself; see, here is powder  scattered on the floor. She used this powder-puff, shaking it over the rug and  floor.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I saw that the first thing!&#8221; cried Pauline,  excitedly; &#8220;and there was a&#8212;&#8221; she stopped, looking in amazement at the white  dust on the floor. For where she had seen a distinct footprint, as of a  stockinged foot, there was now merely a blurred whirl! Some one had obliterated  that footprint!</p>
  <p>&#8220;A what?&#8221; asked the doctor, sharply.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing. A&#8212;a lot of powder spilled,&#8212;I was going  to say.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Gray Haviland looked at her. &#8220;Tell the truth,  Pauline,&#8221; he said.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; she replied, with a calm quite  equalling his own. &#8220;Must we have the Coroner, Dr. Stanton?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, yes, of course; I will telephone at once.  There will be police and detectives,&#8212;oh, it is a terrible case! Nothing must be  touched, nothing! If there is <i>any</i> clue to this mystery, do not let it be disturbed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But you say it was without doubt a burglar who  did it,&#8221; said Anita, her wide eyes gleaming blue.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It must have been.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then why were none of her jewels stolen?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Bless my soul!&#8221; and Dr. Stanton looked as if a  bomb had exploded at his feet. &#8220;Sure enough! It cannot have been a burglar!  Who, then? What other motive than robbery&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It <i>was</i> a burglar,&#8221; declared Pauline, &#8220;and he was&#8212;he was frightened away by&#8212;by a noise&#8212;or  something&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not likely!&#8221; said Anita, &#8220;with all those gems  in easy reach!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The Coroner and the police must get here at  once!&#8221; and the doctor wiped his perspiring brow. &#8220;Never have I seen such an  inexplicable state of affairs! Was&#8212;was Miss Carrington indisposed at all last  evening? Did she say or do anything unusual?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; began Pauline, but Anita  interrupted; &#8220;Yes, she did! She said, &#8216;You little know what&#8217;s going to happen  to me! To-morrow you may sing another tune!&#8217;&#8220;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What did she mean by that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no idea. Could it mean suicide?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No!&#8221; thundered the doctor; &#8220;her skull was  fractured by some one bent on wilful murder! As there is no robbery, we must  look for a deeper motive and a cleverer villain than any professional burglar!&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades4">Chapter 4</a><br>
    A Paper Snake</b></h2>
  <p>On the third floor was the bedroom of the maid,  Estelle, and before its locked door stood Pauline and Anita, demanding  admittance. There was no response from inside, until Pauline said sternly, &#8220;Unless  you open this door at once, Estelle, the police will force it open.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The key turned, the door moved slowly ajar, and  Estelle&#8217;s face appeared, wearing an expression of amazement.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What is it you say, Miss Pauline? The police?  Why?&#8221;</p>
  <p>The maid was making a very evident effort to  appear composed, and was succeeding wonderfully well. Her eyes were reddened  with weeping,&#8212;a condition which a hasty dabbing of powder had not concealed.  She was nervously trembling, but her air of injured innocence, if assumed, was admirable.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Estelle,&#8221; and Pauline loomed tall and  magnificent as an accusing angel, &#8220;what do you know of your mistress&#8217; death?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Estelle gave a shriek and threw herself on her  bed in apparent hysterics.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t begin that!&#8221; ordered Pauline, &#8220;sit up  here and tell the truth.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,&#8221; and the maid sat up, sobbing, &#8220;I know  nothing. How can I?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nonsense! You took the tea-tray to her at eight  o&#8217;clock. What did you see?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Estelle shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;I saw Miss  Carrington sitting before her mirror. She, I assumed, was engrossed in reverie,  so I set down the tray on a tabouret and departed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You noticed nothing amiss?&#8221; said Anita, staring  at the girl.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No; I scarce looked at the lady. She reproved  me harshly last night, and I had no wish to annoy her. I set down the tray with  haste and silently departed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You set it down? Who, then, overturned it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Overturned? Is it then upset?&#8221; Estelle&#8217;s manner  was the impersonal one of the trained servant, who must show surprise at  nothing, but it was a trifle overdone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Estelle, stop posing. Wake up to realities.  Miss Carrington is dead! Do you hear? Dead!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah! <i>Mon  Dieu!</i> Did it then kill her?&#8221; and Estelle&#8217;s calm gave way and she screamed  and moaned in wild hysterics.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What can we do with her?&#8221; asked Anita,  helplessly; &#8220;she must know all about the&#8212;the&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The murder,&#8221; said Pauline calmly. &#8220;But she will  tell us nothing. It is useless to question her. The Coroner will attend to it,  anyway.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The Coroner,&#8221; and Anita looked frightened. &#8220;Will  he question all of us?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of course he will. And, Anita,&#8221; Pauline whirled  on her suddenly, &#8220;what are you going to say was the errand that took you to  Aunt Lucy&#8217;s room after one o&#8217;clock last night?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I! Nothing of the sort! I was not in her room  after we left it together.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I saw you. Don&#8217;t trouble to deny it,&#8221; and  Pauline dropped her eyelids as one bored by a conversation.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You did!&#8221; and Anita&#8217;s flower face turned rosy  pink and her blue eyes blazed with an intensity that Pauline&#8217;s dark ones could  never match. &#8220;Be careful, Pauline Stuart, or I shall tell what <i>I</i> know! You <i>dare</i> to make up such a story! It was <i>I</i> who saw <i>you</i> come from  your aunt&#8217;s room at a late hour! What have you to say now?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing&#8212;to you,&#8221; and Pauline swept from the  room and returned slowly down the stairway to the second floor.</p>
  <p>The sight of two police officers in the hall  gave her a sudden start. How had they appeared, so soon? And how dreadful to  see them in the palatial home that had heretofore housed only gentle-mannered  aristocrats and obsequious liveried servants! The men looked ill at ease as  they stood against the rich background of tapestry hangings and tropical palms,  but their faces showed a stern appreciation of their duty, and they looked at Pauline  with deferential but acute scrutiny.</p>
  <p>Not noticing them in any way, the girl, her head  held high, went straight to her aunt&#8217;s room. Sergeant Flake was in charge, and  he refused her admission.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Coroner&#8217;s orders, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said; &#8220;he&#8217;ll be  here himself shortly, and then you can see him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come away, Pauline,&#8221; and Haviland appeared and  took her by the arm; &#8220;where&#8217;s Anita?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I left her in Estelle&#8217;s room. Oh Gray, that  girl&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; and gripping her firmly, Haviland led  her to a small sitting room and shut the door. &#8220;Now listen, Pauline; mind what  I say. Don&#8217;t give the least bit of information or express the slightest notion  of opinion except to the chief authorities. And not to them until they ask you.  This is a terrible affair, and a mighty strange one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who did it, Gray?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never you mind. Don&#8217;t even ask questions. The  very walls have ears!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who upset that breakfast tray?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Estelle, of course.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She says she didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She lies. Everybody will lie; why, Pauline, you  must lie yourself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it! I have no reason to!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You may find that you have. But, at least,  Pauline, I beg of you, that you will keep your mouth shut. There will be  developments soon,&#8212;there must be,&#8212;and then we will know what to do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The two returned to the boudoir. At first glance  it seemed to be full of men. The beautiful room, with its ornate but harmonious  furnishings and appointments of the Marie Antoinette period, was occupied with  eager representatives of the law and justice hunting for any indication of the ruthless  hand that had felled the owner of all that elegance.</p>
  <p>Coroner Scofield was receiving the report of  Doctor Moore, who had arrived with him.</p>
  <p>Dr. Moore agreed with Dr. Stanton that the  deceased had been struck with a heavy weapon that had fractured the skull, but  he admitted the wounds showed some strange conditions which could only be  explained by further investigation.</p>
  <p>The Coroner was deep in thought as he studied  the face of the dead woman.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It is most mysterious,&#8221; he declared; &#8220;that face  is almost smiling! it is the face of a happy woman. Clearly, she did not know  of her approaching fate.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The blow was struck from behind,&#8221; informed Dr.  Moore.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Even so, why didn&#8217;t she see the approach of the  assailant in the mirror? She is looking straight into the large glass,&#8212;must  have been looking in it at the moment of her death. <i>Why</i> receive that death blow without a tremor of fear or even a  glance of startled inquiry?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Inspector Brunt stood by, gravely, and for the  most part silently, watching and listening.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That might imply,&#8221; he said, slowly, &#8220;that if  she did see the assailant, it was some one she knew, and of whom she had no  fear.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Gray Haviland looked up suddenly. A deep red  spread over his face and then, seeing himself narrowly watched by the  detectives present, he set his lips firmly together and said no word.</p>
  <p>Pauline turned white and trembled, but she too  said nothing.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why is she sitting in this large easy chair?&#8221;  went on the Coroner; &#8220;Is it not customary for ladies at their dressing tables  to use a light side-chair?&#8221;</p>
  <p>This showed decidedly astute perception, and the  Inspector looked interestedly at the chair in question, which he had not  especially noticed before.</p>
  <p>Being tacitly appealed to by the Coroner&#8217;s  inquiring eyes, Pauline replied: &#8220;It is true that my aunt usually sat at her  dressing-table in a small chair,&#8212;that one, in fact,&#8221; and she pointed to a  dainty chair of gilded cane. &#8220;I have no idea why she should choose the heavy,  cushioned one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It would seem,&#8221; the Coroner mused, &#8220;as if she  might have sat down there to admire the effect of her belongings rather than to  arrange her hair or toilette.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Absorbedly, all present watched Coroner Scofield&#8217;s  movements.</p>
  <p>It was true, the quietly reposeful attitude of  the still figure leaning back against the brocaded upholstery, and so evidently  looking in the great gold-framed mirror, was that of one admiring or  criticising her own appearance. Added to this, the fact of her bizarre costume  and strange adornments, it seemed certain that Miss Carrington had come to her  death while innocently happy in the feminine employment of dressing up in the elaborate  finery that she loved.</p>
  <p>But the snake!</p>
  <p>Carefully Coroner Scofield removed the  inexplicable thing. He held it up that all might see. A Japanese paper snake, a  cheap toy, such as is found together with fans and lanterns in the Oriental department  of large shops.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Could this have been placed round her neck  after death?&#8221; Scofield inquired of the doctors.</p>
  <p>The two physicians agreed, that though that was  possible, yet the appearance of the flesh beneath it seemed to indicate its  having encircled the throat during life.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; cried Pauline, excitedly. &#8220;Aunt Lucy <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> have sat there and <i>smiled</i>, with a snake anywhere near her!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That would seem so,&#8221; and Dr. Stanton nodded his  head. &#8220;I well know of my late patient&#8217;s aversion to snakes. It amounted almost  to a mania! It is not an uncommon one, many women feel the same, though seldom  to so great an extent.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That deepens the mystery,&#8221; said Coroner  Scofield; &#8220;unless, indeed, the snake was put on after the crime. But that is  even more mysterious. I shall now remove these valuable jewels, and give them  to&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>He looked inquiringly at Haviland and Pauline,  and the latter immediately responded: &#8220;Give them to me, Mr. Scofield. I am now  mistress here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Haviland said nothing, but he looked at Pauline  as if in disapproval.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is this of great worth?&#8221; inquired Scofield, as  he carefully removed the scarf from the shoulders it surrounded.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only moderately so,&#8221; returned Pauline. &#8220;It is a  Syrian scarf and was sent to her by her nephew who lives in Egypt. It is not new,  he sent several to us about a year ago.&#8221;</p>
  <p>She took the long, heavy, white and silver  drapery, and laid it in a nearby wardrobe. Then the Coroner unfastened the  large pearls from their place as eardrops, and taking up one lifeless hand  removed its rings. All these he handed to Pauline without a word.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What is this?&#8221; he exclaimed suddenly; and  opening the curled-up fingers of the other hand he drew forth a crumpled gray  object. It was a glove, of soft sude, and so tightly had it been held that it  was deeply creased.</p>
  <p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s glove!&#8221; said the Coroner, smoothing it  out. &#8220;Will the wonders of this case never cease?&#8221;</p>
  <p>He scrutinized it, but remarking only that it  was of medium size and superior quality, he laid it carefully aside for the  time.</p>
  <p>From the same arm he removed the scarab  bracelet, also handing that to Pauline.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The lady was fond of Oriental jewelry,&#8221; he  observed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned Haviland, before Pauline could  speak. &#8220;Her nephew sent or brought home much of it. But, as we informed you,  Miss Carrington was also wearing pearls and diamonds of enormous value,  compared to which these trinkets are as nothing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But scarabs, I am told, are of great price.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Some are,&#8221; returned Haviland. &#8220;That bracelet,  however, is not genuine, nor of great value.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Then the Coroner, with delicate touch, removed  the bits of broken tortoise-shell from the puffs of hair, and carefully laid  them together on a small silver tray he appropriated from the dressing-table  litter.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Inspector Brunt, in his grave,  slow way, &#8220;that it will be wise to photograph the whole picture from several  points of view before the autopsy is performed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Arrangements had been made for this, and  Detective Hardy, a young man from Headquarters, stepped forward with his  camera.</p>
  <p>As those who were asked to left the room,  Pauline and Gray went out together, and met Anita just outside in the hall.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, tell me, Gray! Who did it? What does it all  mean?&#8221; she cried, and grasped him by the arm.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell her about it, Gray,&#8221; said Pauline, and  leaving the two together, she went swiftly along the hall to her own room.</p>
  <p>The alert eyes of the guarding policemen  followed her, but also they followed the movements of every one else, and if  they had, as yet, any suspicions, no one knew of them.</p>
  <p>Meantime, the gruesome work of photography went  on.</p>
  <p>Surely never was such a strange subject for the  camera! Denuded of her jewels, but still robed in her gorgeous dressing-gown,  and still leaning back in her luxurious arm-chair, with that strange smile of  happy expectancy, Miss Lucy Carrington presented the same air of regal authority  she had always worn in life. Her eyes were widely staring, but there was no  trace or hint of fear in her peaceful attitude of repose.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no solution!&#8221; said Inspector Brunt,  deeply thoughtful. &#8220;No one could or would crack a skull like that, but an  experienced and professional burglar and housebreaker. And such a one could  have but one motive, robbery, and the jewels were not stolen!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Inside job,&#8221; observed Scofield, briefly, his  eyes on his work.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maybe the burglar was frightened away at the  critical moment.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No. Whatever frightened him would be known to  some member of the family.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Maybe it is.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hey? Have you a theory?&#8221; and the Coroner looked  up suddenly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Anything but! There&#8217;s no <i>possible</i> theory that will fit the facts.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Except the truth.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, except the truth. But it will be long  before we find that, I&#8217;m afraid. It strikes me it&#8217;s at the bottom of an  unusually deep well.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;d <i>better</i> find it. It&#8217;d be a nice how d&#8217;y&#8217; do for you to fall down on <i>this</i> case!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no falling down been done yet. And it  may well be that the very fact of there being such strange and irreconcilable  conditions shall prove a help rather than a hindrance.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And then, all being in readiness, the lifeless  form of Miss Carrington, once the proud domineering autocrat, now laid low, was  borne to a distant room, for the autopsy that might cast a further light on the  mystery of her tragic death.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades5">Chapter 5</a><br>
    A Man&#8217;s Glove</b></h2>
  <p>Inspector Brunt and the young detective, Hardy,  were interviewing the members of the household in the library, and the task was  not an easy one. The two girls were distinctly at odds, and Gray Haviland,  whether authoritatively or not, persisted in assuming a major rle.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; Haviland said, &#8220;that it is the  most remarkable mystery that has ever occurred in the experience of you police  people. Now, I think the wisest plan is to call in a big detective,&#8212;no offence,  Mr. Hardy,&#8212;but I mean a noted fellow, like Stone, say, and let him get at the  root of the crime.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I think, Gray,&#8221; and Pauline looked very  haughty, &#8220;that any such suggestion would come better from me. I am now mistress  of the place, and it is for me to say what we shall do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; and Haviland looked no whit  abashed, &#8220;but you know Carr Loria is equally in authority, even if he isn&#8217;t  here, and you see&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that Carr&#8217;s absence gives <i>you</i> any authority!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But it does, in a way. As Miss Lucy&#8217;s man of  affairs, I ought to look out for the interests of her heirs, at least, for the  absent one. I&#8217;m sure Loria would want to do everything possible to find the  murderer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Has this nephew been notified yet?&#8221; asked  Inspector Brunt.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned Pauline; &#8220;we&#8217;ve telephoned a  cablegram to the city to be sent to him in Egypt. But I don&#8217;t know when he will  get it, nor when we&#8217;ll get a response.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;His permanent address is Cairo, but he is off  in the desert, or somewhere, so much that sometimes he is away from  communication for weeks at a time. Still I&#8217;ve sent it, that&#8217;s all I can do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What did you tell him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I made it rather long and circumstantial. I  told him of Aunt Lucy&#8217;s death, and that she was killed by a blow on the head by  a burglar, which fractured her skull. I asked him if he would come home or if  we should go there. You see, we were intending to sail for Egypt in February.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who were?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Myself, my aunt, Miss Frayne and Mr. Haviland.  Carrington Loria has been begging us to make the trip, and at last Aunt Lucy  decided to go. Our passage is engaged, and all plans made.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And now&#8212;?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now, I do not know. Everything is uncertain.  But if the burglar can be found, and punished, I see no reason why I, at least,  shouldn&#8217;t go on and make the trip. The others must please themselves.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline looked at Anita and at Haviland with a  detached air, as if now they were no longer members of the household, and their  plans did not concern her.</p>
  <p>Not so Haviland. &#8220;Sure I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; he cried; &#8220;I  fancy Carr will be mighty glad to keep me on in the same capacity I served Miss  Carrington. He&#8217;ll need a representative in this country. I doubt he&#8217;ll come  over,&#8212;there&#8217;s no need, if I look after all business matters for him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What does he do in Egypt?&#8221; asked the Inspector,  who was half engrossed looking over his memoranda, and really took slight  interest in the absent heir.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s excavating wonderful temples and things,&#8221;  volunteered Anita, for Pauline and Gray were looking, amazed, at a man who came  into the room. He was the detective who had been left in charge of the boudoir,  and he carried a strange-looking object.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> it?&#8221; cried Pauline.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a black-jack.&#8221; replied the detective. &#8220;I  found it, Inspector, just under the edge of the tassel trimmin&#8217; of the lounge.  The fellow slung it away, and it hid under the fringe, out of sight.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Gravely, Inspector Brunt took the weapon. It was  rudely made, of black cloth, a mere bag, long and narrow, and filled with bird  shot.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the weapon!&#8221; declared Brunt. &#8220;A man  could hit a blow with that thing that would break the skull without cutting the  skin. Yes, there is no further doubt that Miss Carrington was murdered by a  burglar. This is a burglar&#8217;s weapon; this it was that crushed the shell comb to  fragments, and fractured the skull, leaving the body sitting upright, and unmutilated.  Death was, of course, instantaneous.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But the jewels!&#8221; said Detective Hardy,  wonderingly; &#8220;why&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t <i>know </i>why!&#8221; said Brunt, a little testily; &#8220;that is for you detectives to find  out. I have to go by what evidence I find. Can I find a broken skull and a  black-jack in the same room and not deduce a burglarious assault that proved  fatal? The thief may have been scared off or decided he didn&#8217;t want the loot,  but that doesn&#8217;t affect the certainty that we have the weapon and therefore the  case is a simple one. That burglar can be found, without a doubt. Then we shall  learn <i>why</i> he didn&#8217;t steal the jewels.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But the snake?&#8221; said Pauline, looking  wonderingly at the Inspector; &#8220;the burglar must have been a maniac or an  eccentric to put that snake round my aunt&#8217;s neck after he killed her,&#8212;and nothing  will ever make me believe that she allowed it there while alive!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say,&#8221; put in Haviland; &#8220;the whole  affair is so inexplicable,&#8212;excuse me, Mr. Brunt, but I can&#8217;t think it such a  simple case as you do,&#8212;that I think we should engage expert skill to solve the mysteries  of it all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That must come later,&#8221; and Inspector Brunt  resumed his usual gravity of manner which had been disturbed by the discovery  of the black-jack. &#8220;Will you now please give me some detailed information as to  the circumstances? Is the house always securely locked at night?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very much so,&#8221; answered Haviland; &#8220;Miss  Carrington was not overly timid, but she always insisted on careful precautions  against burglary. She had a house full of valuable furniture, curios, and art  works besides her personal belongings. Yes, the house was always supposed to be  carefully locked and bolted.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Whose duty is it to look after it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The butler Haskins, and his wife, who is the  cook, had all such matters in charge.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I will interview them later. Now please tell  me, any of you, why Miss Carrington was arrayed in such peculiar fashion, last  evening.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine,&#8221; said Pauline. &#8220;My aunt was  not a vain woman. I have never known her to sit before a mirror, except when  necessary, to have her hair dressed. It is almost unbelievable that she should  deliberately don those jewels and scarf and sit down there as if to admire the  effect. Yet it had that appearance.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But she wore the jewels during the evening, did  she not?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not all of them. She wore her pearls, because,  as she told us, and as I have often heard her say, pearls must be worn  occasionally to keep them in condition. But she added a large number of  valuable gems&#8212;or, some one did,&#8212;after we left her last night.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Whom do you mean by we?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss Frayne and myself. We were in her room, to  say good-night to her, and we left at the same time.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;At what time?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;About quarter past twelve, I should think, wasn&#8217;t  it, Anita? We went upstairs about midnight, and were with my aunt ten or  fifteen minutes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Were your good-nights amicable?&#8221; asked the  Inspector, and Pauline looked up in surprise. Then, recollecting the last words  of her aunt, she shut her lips obstinately and made no reply.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Indeed, they were not!&#8221; declared Miss Frayne; &#8220;Miss  Carrington told both Miss Stuart and myself that it would be our last night  beneath this roof! That to-day we must seek some other home, for she would  harbor us no longer!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah! And why did she thus treat you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There was no especial reason,&#8221; and Anita&#8217;s  lovely blue eyes looked straight at the Inspector with a pathetic gaze, &#8220;she  was in a tantrum, as she frequently was.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t mean it,&#8221; put in Pauline, hastily.</p>
  <p>&#8220;She did!&#8221; asseverated Anita; &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard her  threaten to send us away before, but never so earnestly. She meant it last  night, I am sure. And, too, she knew something would happen to her last night,&#8212;she  said so.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What? what&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do hush, Anita!&#8221; said Pauline; &#8220;those foolish  words meant nothing!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Proceed, Miss Frayne,&#8221; and the Inspector spoke  sternly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;She did,&#8221; went on Anita. &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember the  exact words, but she said I little knew what was going to happen to her, and  she said &#8216;to-morrow you may sing another song!&#8217; Surely such words meant  something!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If they did,&#8221; said Pauline, angrily, &#8220;they  merely meant that she was going to dismiss you to-day!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; and Anita glanced at her, &#8220;she  distinctly said something would happen to her,&#8212;not to me.&#8221;</p>
  <p align="center">&#8220;You know better than to  take things she said in a temper, seriously! If we are to repeat idle conversations,  suppose I say that I heard you say last evening that you&#8217;d like to kill her!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t!&#8221; shrieked Anita.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You did,&#8221; declared Pauline, calmly; &#8220;and Gray  said she ought to be killed, too. I know you didn&#8217;t mean to kill her, but I&#8217;ve  just as much right to quote your foolish words as you have to quote hers.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said Haviland; &#8220;let up, Polly! You  two are always at each other! As there is no question as to who killed poor  Miss Lucy, why rake up our foolish words spoken under the intense provocation  of her exhibition of temper,&#8212;which was specially trying last night. Inspector, can  we tell you anything more of importance?&#8221;</p>
  <p>So far the Inspector had been almost silent, and  appeared to be learning some points from the conversation not addressed to him.  Now, he changed his manner, and began briskly to ask questions.</p>
  <p>&#8220;This glove,&#8221; he said, holding it out, &#8220;was, as  you know, found clasped in her hand. Is it yours, Mr. Haviland?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the young man, as, after a close  examination of the glove he handed it back; &#8220;no, it is a size smaller than I  wear, and it is of a different make from mine.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Have you any idea whose it can be? It is highly  improbable the burglar left it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no idea,&#8221; and Haviland shrugged his  shoulders. &#8220;But if it was not left by the intruder, where could it possibly  have come from? It is a man&#8217;s glove.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Could it be one of Cousin Carr&#8217;s?&#8221; said  Pauline. &#8220;Aunt Lucy was awfully fond of anything of his. She kept one of his  caps in her drawer for months, after he left the last time.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Haviland; &#8220;it isn&#8217;t Loria&#8217;s. He  wears larger gloves than I do. My theory points to a sort of gentleman burglar,  a &#8216;Raffles,&#8217; you know, and I think he talked with Miss Lucy, before he struck  that blow, and disarmed her mind of fear.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What an extraordinary idea!&#8221; and Pauline looked  thoughtful.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But how else explain the glove?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And the snake? Did your gentleman burglar  persuade her to wear that paper thing? Never! Gray, you&#8217;re absurd!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Another thing,&#8221; went on Inspector Brunt,  returning the glove to his roomy pocket-book; &#8220;In the bedroom we noticed a  glass of milk and beside it an empty plate. Was it the lady&#8217;s habit to have a  night lunch?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Anita; &#8220;but she rarely ate it. In  case of insomnia, she had ready a light repast, but she almost never touched  it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The glass of milk is still untouched,&#8221; said  Brunt, &#8220;but the plate is empty. What did it contain?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A sandwich, I think,&#8221; said Anita. &#8220;That is what  Estelle usually prepared for her. She will know,&#8212;Estelle, the maid.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss Carrington&#8217;s lady&#8217;s maid?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes; though not hers exclusively. She was  expected to act as maid for Miss Stuart and myself also, at such times as Miss  Carrington didn&#8217;t require her services.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And she, then, brought the breakfast tray, that  is upset on the floor?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes; Miss Lucy always had an early cup of tea,  before she dressed for breakfast with the family.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And the maid took it to her this morning? Did  she not then discover the&#8212;the tragedy?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She says not!&#8221; cried Pauline; &#8220;but I&#8217;m sure she  did! She says she saw Miss Lucy at the mirror, and thinking her engrossed,  merely left the tray on the tabouret and went away.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ridiculous!&#8221; exclaimed Haviland; &#8220;What does  Estelle mean by such lies? Of course she saw Miss Carrington&#8217;s strange  appearance, of course she was frightened out of her wits, and of course she  dropped the tray and ran. But why not say so? And why not give an immediate  alarm? She took that tray, probably, about eight. Pauline went up at nine. What  was Estelle doing all that time? Why didn&#8217;t she go in to dress Miss Carrington?  I tell you, Mr. Inspector, there&#8217;s a lot of queer work to be explained, and with  all due respect to the force, I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;ll need expert service if you&#8217;re  going to get anywhere. And I&#8217;m sure, too, that if we can get word to Carrington  Loria and back, he&#8217;ll say spare no trouble or expense to avenge his aunt&#8217;s  murder. He is equally heir with you, Pauline, and he ought to be consulted.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The will hasn&#8217;t been read yet,&#8221; said Miss  Stuart; &#8220;we can&#8217;t assume anything until that is done.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Pshaw! you know perfectly well half of the bulk  of the estate is yours and half Carr&#8217;s. I have a small slice and Miss Frayne a  bit. The older servants have small legacies, and there are a few charities.  That, Mr. Brunt, is the gist of the will. Do you not agree with me, that as I  was the man of business for the late Miss Carrington, I am justified, in the absence  of Mr. Loria, in continuing my services, at least, until we can get definite  directions from him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Those matters are outside my province, Mr. Haviland.  Miss Carrington&#8217;s legal advisers will doubtless come here soon, and such things  will be decided by them. Now, here&#8217;s another point. I noted in the course of  our investigation in the boudoir a quantity of powder fallen on the floor near  the dressing table, in such relation to it that it would seem Miss Carrington  was using the face powder as she sat there. Was this her habit?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Her habit? Yes;&#8221; said Anita, &#8220;Miss Carrington  was in the habit of using face powder,&#8212;even cosmetics. It is not strange then, that  such a proceeding was part of her night toilette.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, not at all,&#8221; agreed Mr. Brunt. &#8220;But where  the powder was thickest, on the hard floor, near the rug, was a muddled spot,  as if some one had wiped out or swept up a mark or print. Can any of you explain  this?&#8221;</p>
  <p>No one spoke, and the stern voice went on. &#8220;I  remember, Miss Stuart, that you began to say something bearing on this while we  were in that room, and you suddenly stopped, appearing confused. I ask you why?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline hesitated, bit her lip, looked at Gray  and then at Anita, and finally said, &#8220;I may as well tell. It is nothing. When I  went to my aunt&#8217;s room, and found what I did find,&#8212;I was so excited and nervous  I scarce knew what I did. But I remember seeing a footprint in that powder, and  in obedience to an impulsive instinct I&#8212;I obliterated it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;With what?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;With my handkerchief. I merely slapped at it,  and the light powder flew about it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why did you do this?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I had no real reason. I was not  thinking of what I was doing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then you did not have a desire to shield some  one from possible suspicion?&#8221; The words were shot at her so swiftly that  Pauline gasped.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Suspicion! What do you mean? Was it not the  work of a burglar?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Was the impression of a foot that you saw, the  foot of a man or a woman?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How can I tell? It was large, but as it was a  bare or stockinged foot I could not judge. Might not the burglar have removed  his boots, before entering the room?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He might, indeed, and that is just what he did  do. For more prints of that stockinged foot have been discovered on the stairs,  and there is no doubt that the tracks are those of the assailant of Miss  Carrington. With your permission, Miss Stuart, I will now go to interview the  servants. May I ask you to await me here, all of you? I shall not be very long.&#8221;</p>
  <p>As the Inspector and the detectives left the  room, Haskins appeared to announce Mrs. Frothingham and Count Henri Charlier.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades6">Chapter 6</a> <br>
    A Neighbor&#8217;s Call</b></h2>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, is it not terrible? What <i>can</i> I say to comfort you!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Frothingham&#8217;s distressed tones and her air  of eager, intense sympathy met with little response from Pauline.</p>
  <p>Haviland had been called from the room on an  errand and Anita&#8217;s willingness to receive the neighbor&#8217;s condolences did not  seem acceptable. The overdressed, forward-mannered widow continued to direct her  attention entirely to Pauline, and that young woman merely surveyed her visitor  coolly and replied in monosyllables.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; she said, and her icy air would have  deterred a less determined intruder.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I simply couldn&#8217;t help running over as soon as  I heard the dreadful news. For we are neighbors after all, though not so very  well acquainted; and neighbors have a camaraderie of their own, I think.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said Pauline, and her eyelids fell  slightly, with an expression of boredness.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; Mrs. Frothingham rattled on; &#8220;and  I said to our dear Count, we must run over at once, there may be something we  can do for the saddened ones.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thank you;&#8221; and had a marble statue been given  vocal powers the effect would have been much the same.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Dear friend,&#8221; continued the unabashed visitor, &#8220;I  know how overcome you must be&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I am not overcome at all,&#8221; said Pauline,  rising, and determined to hear no more; &#8220;and I must beg to be excused, Mrs.  Frothingham, as I have many matters to attend to this morning.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah, yes, of course, you have. We will not  detain you. The Count and I merely called for a moment to inquire&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, I quite understand. Miss Frayne will be  pleased to answer your inquiries. Thank you both, and&#8212;good-morning.&#8221;</p>
  <p>With a polite but distant bow, Pauline left the  room, and as Count Charlier sprang to hold the door open for her, he, after a  moment&#8217;s hesitation, followed her out.</p>
  <p>&#8220;A moment, I beg, Miss Stuart,&#8221; he said as they  reached the hall; &#8220;You are offended at Mrs. Frothingham&#8217;s intrusion, but have I  not a right to call? Was I not such a friend of Miss Carrington as to justify  this tribute of respect to her memory?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Certainly, Count,&#8221; and Pauline grew a shade  kinder, &#8220;but I am not sufficiently acquainted with your friend to receive her  visits.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah, no. That is conceded. But, I pray you, tell  me of the sad affair. I have heard no details,&#8212;that is, unless you would rather  not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, I am not unwilling. You were a good friend  of Aunt Lucy&#8217;s&#8212;she was fond of you, and I am glad to talk to some one. Let us  sit here.&#8221; Pauline indicated a recessed seat in the hall and the pair sat  there. She recounted briefly the story of the tragedy and the Count was duly sympathetic.  Pauline watched him closely, and discerned great interest but little grief or  sorrow.</p>
  <p>&#8220;A burglar, of course,&#8221; said the Count hearing  of the cruel weapon. &#8220;How <i>could</i> any  one attack the charming lady! And the marvelous jewels she wore! They were, of  course, stolen?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No; that&#8217;s the strange part. They were not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah, how splendid!&#8221; and his absorbed air of  satisfaction gave Pauline a thrill of disgust at his cold-bloodedness. &#8220;And now  they are all yours? Those magnificent gems?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The property, most of it, is divided between my  cousin and myself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Your cousin? Mr. Haviland?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No; he is but a distant connection. I mean my  first cousin, Mr. Loria, now in Egypt.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I have heard Miss Carrington refer to  him. He will come home?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I do not know. We have cabled of course. Count  Charlier, do you remember hearing my aunt say, last evening, that she expected  something to happen to her?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I remember, Miss Stuart.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Have you any idea what she meant?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I? But how could I know?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Answer my question, please.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The Count&#8217;s eyes fell, and he shifted his feet  about uneasily. At last he said: &#8220;It is not pleasant to say such things, but  since you ask, I may be permitted to assume that the late Miss Carrington had a  regard for my humble self.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And she expected, she&#8212;hoped that her regard  might be returned?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It may be so.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And that last night you might tell her so?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You honor me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did you tell her so?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I did not, Miss Stuart. What might have  happened had she lived I cannot say, but I did not, last evening, say any word  to Miss Carrington of my aspiration to her hand.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did you say anything that could have been taken  as a hint that some time, say, in the near future, you might express such an  aspiration?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I may have done so.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thank you, Count Charlier. I had perhaps no  right to ask, but you have answered my rather impertinent questions  straightforwardly, and I thank you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline rose, as if to end the interview. In the  doorway appeared Anita. &#8220;Pauline,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I wish you would come back and  listen to Mrs. Frothingham&#8217;s story. It seems to me of decided importance.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You have something to tell me?&#8221; asked Pauline,  returning to the library and looking at the unwelcome neighbor with patient  tolerance.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Stuart. Now, it may be nothing,&#8212;nothing,  I mean, of consequence, that is, you may not think so, but I&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Suppose you let me hear it and judge for  myself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes. Well, it&#8217;s only this. I was wakeful last  night, or rather early this morning, and looking from my bedroom window, which  faces this house, I saw a man climb out of a window on the first floor and  skulk away among the shrubbery.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;At what time was this?&#8221; and Pauline looked  interested at last.</p>
  <p>&#8220;About four o&#8217;clock. He was to all appearances a  burglar&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How could you tell? Was it not dark at that  hour in the morning?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No; the moon is past full, you know, and it  shone brightly in the western sky.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Enough for you to discern the man clearly?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I took a field-glass to assist my vision. He  stealthily climbed out and skirting the bushes made his way swiftly toward the  great gates.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;This is indeed an important bit of information,  Mrs. Frothingham; I dare say you ought to tell it to the police who are here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t! I&#8217;m so timid about such things!  But,&#8212;if you would go with me, Miss Stuart&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss Frayne will go with you,&#8221; said Pauline,  coolly; &#8220;You will find a policeman in the hall who will direct you where to  find the Inspector.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Without another word Pauline bowed in a way to  include the lady and the Count also, and went away to her own room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Stuck-up thing!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Frothingham,  and Anita nodded her golden head in agreement.</p>
  <p>Inspector Brunt instructed Hardy to hear the  story of Mrs. Frothingham, and he devoted his own attention to Count Charlier,  of whom he had heard as being a friend of Miss Carrington&#8217;s.</p>
  <p>He quizzed the Frenchman rather pointedly as to  his friendship with the unfortunate lady and the Count became decidedly ill at  ease.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why do you ask me so much?&#8221; he objected; &#8220;I was  a friend, yes; I may have aspired to a nearer relation, yes? That is no crime?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not at all, Count,&#8221; said Mr. Brunt; &#8220;I only  want to find out if Miss Carrington&#8217;s strange reference to something about to  happen to her could have had any reference to you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It might be so; I cannot say. But all that has  no bearing on the poor lady&#8217;s death.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No. At what time did you go away from here,  Count Charlier?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;At about midnight.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You went directly home?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;To Mrs. Frothingham&#8217;s, where I am a house  guest, yes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And you retired?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And remained in your bed till morning?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But of a certainty, yes! What are you implying?  That I had a hand in this affair?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, no; be calm, my dear sir. I ask you but one  question. Is this your glove?&#8221;</p>
  <p>The Inspector took the glove from his pocket and  offered it to the Count.</p>
  <p>The Frenchman took it, examined it minutely and  without haste.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; he said, returning it; &#8220;that is not  my property.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thank you, that is all,&#8221; and the Inspector put  the glove back in his pocket.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There is no doubt as to the main facts,&#8221; said  the Inspector, a half hour later, as, with the members of the family he summed  up what had been found out from all known sources. &#8220;The assailant was most  certainly a burglarious intruder; the weapon, this &#8216;black-jack&#8217;; the motive,  robbery. Why the robbery was not achieved and what is the meaning of the unexplained  circumstances of the whole affair, we do not yet know. They are matters to be  investigated, but they cannot greatly affect the principal conditions. You may  be thankful, Miss Stuart, that the sad death of your aunt was undoubtedly  painless; and also that the thief did not succeed in his attempt to purloin the  valuable gems.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The Inspector&#8217;s speech might seem cold-hearted,  but Brunt was a practical man, and he was truly glad for himself that in addition  to finding the murderer he did not also have to recover a fortune of rare  jewels.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;as to the maid, Estelle. I  have talked with her, but she is so hysterical and her stories so  contradictory, that I am inclined to the opinion that she has some sort of  guilty knowledge or at least suspicion of the intruder. The man was  stocking-footed, and it is a pity, Miss Stuart, that you erased that footprint  on the floor! But it would have been of doubtful use, I dare say. We have found  faint tracks of the powder on the steps of the staircase, and though the last  ones are almost indiscernible they seem to lead through the butler&#8217;s pantry,  and to an exit by that window. But the window was found fastened this morning,  so, if it was used as a means for the burglar&#8217;s getaway, it must have been fastened  afterward by some person inside. Could this person have been the maid, Estelle?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sure it could!&#8221; exclaimed Haviland, who was an  interested listener. &#8220;That girl is a sly one! I caught her this morning, trying  to take away that glass of milk. I told her to let it alone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked the Inspector.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because I thought if she wanted to get it away,  there must be some reason for her to want it! What was it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; and Anita looked scornfully at Gray;  &#8220;naturally, Estelle would do up the rooms, and would, of course, remove the  remains of Miss Lucy&#8217;s night luncheon.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s just it!&#8221; said Haviland,  triumphantly: &#8220;she didn&#8217;t take the plate that had had sandwiches on it! If she  had, I should have thought nothing of it. But she took the glass of milk, in a  furtive, stealthy way, that made me look at her. She turned red, and trembled,  and I told her to set the glass down. She pretended not to hear, so I told her again.  Then she obeyed. But she glared at me like a tigress.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, rubbish!&#8221; said Anita. &#8220;She was annoyed at  being interfered with in her work, and perhaps fearful of being censured.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Haviland, &#8220;then there&#8217;s no  harm done. If that girl is entirely innocent, what I said won&#8217;t hurt her. But  she looked to me as if on a secret errand and a desperate one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What puzzles me is,&#8221; mused the Inspector, &#8220;why  she persists in saying that she left the tray in good order in the room,&#8212;though  it was discovered an hour later, upset,&#8212;when we know that Miss Carrington had been  dead since, at least, two or three o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Look here, Inspector,&#8221; and Haviland frowned, &#8220;if  the murder was committed at two or three o&#8217;clock, how is it that Mrs.  Frothingham saw the intruder escaping at four or later?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There is a discrepancy there,&#8221; admitted Brunt, &#8220;but  it may be explained away. The doctors cannot be sure until the autopsy is  completed of the exact hour of death, and, too, the lady next door may have  made an error in time.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll inform you that Estelle did upset  that tray herself,&#8221; said Pauline with an air of finality.</p>
  <p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; and Inspector Brunt peered at  her over his glasses.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It was while Gray was telephoning for the  doctor,&#8221; said Pauline, reminiscently, &#8220;that I looked carefully at that overturned  tray.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said Haviland, &#8220;I told you not to  touch anything.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I know that, but I did. I picked up from the <i>dbris</i>, this;&#8221; and Pauline held up to  view a tiny hairpin of the sort called &#8216;invisible.&#8217;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It is Estelle&#8217;s,&#8221; she said; &#8220;see, it is the  glistening bronze color of her hair. Anita has gold-colored ones, and I do not  use these fine wire ones. I use only shell. Moreover, I know this is Estelle&#8217;s,&#8212;don&#8217;t  you, Anita?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It may be.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It is. And its presence there, on the tray,  proves that she let the tray fall in her surprise at seeing Aunt Lucy, and in  her trembling excitement loosened and dropped this hairpin. Doubtless, she  flung her hand up to her head&#8212;a not unusual gesture of hers&#8212;and so dislodged  it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Brunt looked closely at the speaker. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got  it all fixed up, haven&#8217;t you, Miss Stuart?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline flushed slightly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t &#8216;fix it up,&#8217;  as you call it, but I did gather, from what I saw, that the truth must be as I  have stated; and in my anxiety to learn anything possible as to the mystery of  this crime, I secured what may or may not be a bit of evidence. As Mr. Haviland  has said, if Estelle is entirely innocent of any complicity in the matter, these  things can&#8217;t hurt her. But it would scarcely be possible for her to have been  so careless as to drop a hairpin on the tray without noticing it, if she were  not startled and flurried by something that took her mind and eyes entirely  away from her duties.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I think you are purposely making a great deal  out of nothing,&#8221; remarked Anita; &#8220;it seems unfair, to say the least, to condemn  the poor girl on such trifling evidence.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The talk was interrupted by the entrance of the  Coroner and the two doctors.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It is found,&#8221; said Coroner Scofield, &#8220;that the  cause of Miss Carrington&#8217;s death was not the blow on the head.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The Inspector looked his amazement, and the  others sat with receptively blank countenances waiting further disclosures.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; went on Scofield, &#8220;we find in the stomach  unmistakable traces of poison.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Poison!&#8221; It was Anita&#8217;s frightened whisper; &#8220;who  would poison her?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What kind of poison?&#8221; asked Brunt.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Aconitine; deadly and sure. It leaves little  trace, but certain tests reveal it beyond all doubt. That is why we have been  so long. The tests are difficult of performance. But, it is over, and we report  that Miss Lucy Carrington was poisoned by aconitine, administered either by her  own hand or another.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, she never would poison herself!&#8221; cried  Anita; &#8220;who did it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And the blow on the head?&#8221; said Inspector  Brunt, looking deeply perplexed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Her death, from poison, occurred at or near two  o&#8217;clock,&#8221; asserted the Coroner; &#8220;the blow on the head was given after life had  departed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Incredible!&#8221; said Brunt.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It is, indeed, Inspector. But those are the  facts. The heavy blow fractured the skull, but left no bruise or mark, nor was  there any blood from the cut scalp. In addition we have the poison found in the  system, and the death symptoms of quiet, placid dissolution which are  consequent always on that particular poison.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Could it have been self-administered?&#8221; asked  Brunt.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not by Miss Carrington,&#8221; said Doctor Stanton,  decidedly. &#8220;The lady has been my patient for years, and she had an absolute  abhorrence of all sorts of drugs or medicines. She made more fuss over taking a  simple powder than a spoiled child. I have often prescribed for her, knowing full  well she would not take my prescriptions because of her detestation of taking  medicine. When remedies have been really necessary, I have had to administer  them while with her, and a difficult task it was. Moreover, my patient was not  of the temperament or disposition to seek death for herself, nor had she any  reason to do so. No; the case is murder; the poison was administered by some  one who wished for her death and deliberately set out to accomplish it,&#8212;and  succeeded.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is the action of this poison instantaneous?&#8221;  asked Brunt.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No; death ensues about a half hour to an hour  after the dose is taken into the system.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then, we gather that the poison was taken in  the neighborhood of one o&#8217;clock, last night.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed the Coroner, &#8220;about one o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;About one o&#8217;clock!&#8221; whispered Anita, in an  awe-struck, gasping way, and her great blue eyes stared dazedly into the dark  ones of Pauline.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades7">Chapter 7</a><br>
    The Inquest</b></h2>
  <p>Next morning the inquest was proceeding. The  great living-room at Garden Steps was crowded with listeners, drawn hither by  sympathy, interest or curiosity. And each class found ample to satisfy its  motive. The mere fact of being within that exclusive home, within those  heretofore inaccessible doors, was enough to thrill and delight many, and observation  and scrutiny were as well repaid as was the listening to the astounding  revelations that were poured into their ears.</p>
  <p>Coroner Scofield&#8217;s jury was composed of  intelligent men, who were eagerly receptive to the appalling facts narrated to  them and the curiously bizarre bits of evidence that became known as the  witnesses were questioned.</p>
  <p>Dr. Stanton told of his being called to the  house, and his discoveries and conclusions. He admitted that he assumed death  was caused by the blow on the head, but claimed that it was a pardonable error  in view of the fact that such a blow had been given. He affirmed, and Dr. Moore  corroborated it, that the autopsy showed that death was caused by aconitine  poison, administered, either by the deceased or another, at an hour not earlier  than one o&#8217;clock, and probably soon thereafter. The terrible blow that had  fractured the skull had been given after life had been for some time extinct.</p>
  <p>Dr. Stanton asserted emphatically his late  patient&#8217;s detestation of drugs or medicines of any sort, adducing thereby the  extreme improbability of the poison having been self-administered. Moreover,  the temperament and disposition of the late Miss Carrington entirely evinced a  love of life and desire to prolong it by means of any device or assistance the  doctor might give.</p>
  <p>Pauline was called next, and a little flutter of  excitement in the audience greeted her appearance.</p>
  <p>Exceedingly dignified, but of a sweet, gracious  mien, she at once received the silent approval of the crowd. Her black gown,  its collar of sheer white organdy slightly open at the throat, well suited her  pale, beautiful face and her dark hair and eyes. To-day, her eyes seemed fathomless.  At times, gazing intently at the Coroner until they almost disconcerted him;  and then, hidden by veiling lids, whose long lashes fell suddenly, as if to  conceal further disclosures.</p>
  <p>On the whole, Pauline was not a satisfactory  witness. She told, in most straightforward way, of leaving the breakfast table  to go to her aunt&#8217;s room and of finding there the dead body. She told clearly  all the circumstances of the upset tray, the spilled powder and the eccentric garb  of Miss Carrington herself. But questions as to her opinion of these facts  brought little response.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You left Miss Carrington at half-past twelve?&#8221;  asked Coroner Scofield.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not so late, I think,&#8221; returned Pauline; &#8220;probably  at quarter or twenty minutes past twelve,&#8212;I am not sure.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How was she then dressed?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In the gown she had worn during the evening.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And her jewels?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;When I left my aunt, she was wearing her pearls  and the other jewelry she had worn with her evening dress. Some brooches and  rings and bracelets.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But not so much as she had on when you  discovered her in the morning?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not nearly so much.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How do you account for this?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t account for it. To me it is exceedingly  mysterious.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And the paper snake round her neck?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I have no idea by whom such a thing could have  been brought to my aunt. But I am positive she never put it on herself. Nor can  I think she would allow it to come near her if she were alive,&#8212;or conscious,&#8212;or,  had power to scream for help. Any one knowing my aunt&#8217;s fear and horror of anything  reptilian will agree to this.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It seems evident,&#8221; said the Coroner,  thoughtfully, &#8220;that some intruder entered Miss Carrington&#8217;s room, at or near  one o&#8217;clock. That this intruder in some manner induced Miss Carrington to  swallow the poison, whether conscious of her act or not. That the intruder  subsequently, and for some reason, placed the snake round the neck of the  victim, and, later still, brutally gave her a stunning blow with the black-jack  which was found, and thereby fractured her skull. Granting these assumptions, can  you, Miss Stuart, give us any information that would lead to discovery of the  hand that wrought this havoc?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not any,&#8221; and Pauline raised her great eyes a  moment to Scofield&#8217;s face and slowly dropped them again.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then can you not express an opinion or suggest  a theory that might account for such strange happenings, at least, in part?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Pauline, slowly; &#8220;I have no idea, nor  can I imagine why my aunt should be so elaborately arrayed and seated in an  easy chair in front of her mirror. It is contrary to all her customs or habits.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Could she have been killed first and could the  jewels and adornments have been added afterward?&#8221; asked the Coroner of the  doctors.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Dr. Moore; &#8220;the whole condition of  the body and clothing make such a theory practically impossible.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Quite impossible,&#8221; added Dr. Stanton; &#8220;and,  too, what would be the sense of such a proceeding?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We are establishing the facts of the  proceedings, not the sense of them,&#8221; returned the Coroner, a little testily,  for he was at his wits&#8217; end even to make a beginning in this strange case.</p>
  <p>&#8220;At least,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;we have the facts and  the approximate time of the crime; have you, Miss Stuart, any suspicion of who  the murderer can be?&#8221;</p>
  <p>The question was shot out suddenly. If its  intent was to startle the witness, it certainly succeeded. Pauline Stuart  turned even whiter than she had been, and she caught her breath quickly and  audibly as she flashed a frightened glance at Gray Haviland. It was by no means  an accusing glance, though many who saw it, eager for a direction in which to  cast their suspicions, took it for such.</p>
  <p>But Pauline controlled herself immediately. &#8220;Certainly  not,&#8221; she said coldly. &#8220;That is, I can have no suspicion of the murderer&#8217;s  identity. It was, of course, a midnight intruder, of the criminal class. I have  no individual acquaintances who use or possess the weapon that was employed in  this crime.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The black-jack is an auxiliary only. The poison  may have been administered by one not versed in the ways of professional  criminals. You admit that, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It is no doubt true,&#8221; said Pauline, icily, &#8220;that  poison may be given by a person not belonging to the criminal classes. I fail  to see, however, how that fact affects the matter in hand.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It may well affect it. Since Miss Carrington  was killed by a deadly poison, we must conclude that the black-jack assault was  made with the intention of concealing the poisoning and making it appear that  the blow caused the death. There seems to me no other way to account for the conditions  that confront us.&#8221;</p>
  <p>A silence followed this. Its truth was patent to  everybody. Clearly, the poisoner had delivered the blow, for no one else would  attack a victim already dead. And a plausible reason would be the hope that the  poisoning would pass unnoticed in view of the other apparent cause of death.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And it points to the work of an amateur,&#8221; went  on Scofield; &#8220;a professional criminal would know that the autopsy would  disclose the earlier crime.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline lost her nerve. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything  about it!&#8221; she cried, and sank back into her seat, her face buried in her  hands.</p>
  <p>Coroner Scofield was a man of tact. &#8220;It is  entirely natural, Miss Stuart,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that this thought should overcome  you. But we must realize the fact that the theory of a professional burglar is  practically untenable, because nothing was stolen. A burglar&#8217;s motive could be  only robbery, and this did not take place. Nor can we think that a burglar was frightened  away, before he could appropriate the jewels. For, after giving the poison, and  before the blow was given, sufficient time elapsed for a successful getaway to  be made. Nor would the burglar have been at pains to cover up his poisoning  work, for having achieved his end, he would have secured his booty and made  escape. So, it is evident that the motive, not being robbery, is as yet  unknown, and may be obscure and complicated.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What could it have been?&#8221; asked Pauline, her  composure regained, her voice low and even.</p>
  <p>Scofield looked at her. &#8220;It is said, Miss  Stuart, that the only motives for murder are love, revenge or gain. Can you  imagine any one of these directed toward your aunt?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline replied tranquilly. Evidently she had  fully recovered her poise. &#8220;I can think of no one who could have killed my aunt  for love; it is improbable that she has ever done any one such wrong as to call  for such a deed in revenge; as to gain, if you mean pecuniary gain, all the legatees  mentioned in her will may be said to have that motive.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline&#8217;s manner and tones were so impersonal,  so scathingly ironic as to amount to a disclaimer for all the legatees. Her way  of suggesting it made it seem so far removed from possibility that it was far  more emphatic than any denial could have been.</p>
  <p>But Coroner Scofield was as unmoved as his  witness.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; he said coolly; &#8220;and therefore  inquiries must be made. Did you, Miss Stuart, after leaving your aunt soon  after midnight see or hear anything unusual or suspicious?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What do you mean by unusual or suspicious?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I mean did you see or hear anything, anything  at all, that you could not explain to yourself as being in any way connected  with the tragedy we are investigating?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Before answering, Pauline looked in turn at all  the members of the household. Haviland slowly turned his head as if to look at  something across the room, and as slowly brought it back to its previous position.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I did not,&#8221; said Pauline, looking straight at  the Coroner.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That is all,&#8221; said Scofield, briefly, and the  next witness was called.</p>
  <p>This was the maid, Estelle. Her eyes were red  with weeping, but she was not hysterical now, or incoherent. She answered  tersely questions as to Miss Carrington&#8217;s habits and as to her words and  actions during the maid&#8217;s last interview with her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I left her at about quarter of one,&#8221; the  witness deposed; &#8220;I had given her the Oriental neglige, of which she is fond.  I offered to take down her hair and put away her jewels, but she declined those  services, and bade me leave her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She was wearing, when you left her, only the  jewels she had worn during the evening?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only those, sir. When I changed her evening  gown for the boudoir robe, she bade me replace such jewels as I had already  taken off her. She kept on her rings, bracelets and her long rope of pearls  while I changed her costume.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And then she dismissed you for the night?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where was she then? Sitting before the mirror?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, sir. She stood in the middle of the floor.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Was she in an amiable mood?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She was not. Because I offered to assist her  further, she ordered me from the room in anger.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah, in anger! Was Miss Carrington often angry  with you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Indeed, yes; as she was with everybody.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Confine your answers to your own experience.  You prepared a night luncheon for your mistress?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; and now Estelle&#8217;s voice trembled and  her eyes rolled apprehensively.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Two small sandwiches and a glass of milk.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What sort of sandwiches?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Caviare, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah, yes. And why did you put a large dose of  bromide in the glass of milk?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did it kill her?&#8221; and Estelle screamed out her  query. Pauline and Anita looked at one another. It was the same question Estelle  had asked of them.</p>
  <p>&#8220;An overdose of bromide may be fatal,&#8221; parried  the Coroner, not answering the question directly. &#8220;Why did you do it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; and the French girl shrugged  her shoulders; &#8220;why should I poison my mistress? She was quick-tempered, but I  was used to that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be stupid,&#8221; said the Coroner; &#8220;the  bromide didn&#8217;t poison Miss Carrington, for, in the first place, she didn&#8217;t take  it. The glass of milk was found next morning untouched, though the sandwiches  were gone. Therefore, the bromide in the milk was found. Why did you put it in?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;<i>I</i> didn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; reiterated the maid. &#8220;Look higher up for that!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I mention no names, but somebody must have done  it, if bromide was found in that milk.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But you tried to get the glass away next  morning, without being seen.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who says I did?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never mind that; you were seen. Why?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, sir, if I thought anybody was going to  get into trouble because of it, I was only too glad to help, if I could, by  removing it before it was noticed.&#8221; Estelle spoke slowly, as if weighing her  words, and her furtive glances at Pauline bore only one significance. It was  palpably apparent that she suspected Miss Stuart of the deed, and out of  kindness had tried to remove the incriminating evidence.</p>
  <p>Pauline stared at her with a glance that went  through her or over her or around her, but gave not the slightest attention to  the speaker.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did you put bromide in your aunt&#8217;s glass of  milk, Miss Stuart?&#8221; asked the Coroner, and Pauline said, calmly, &#8220;Certainly  not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mr. Scofield sighed. It was a difficult matter  to get at the truth when the witnesses were clever women, in whose veracity he  had not complete confidence.</p>
  <p>He gave up Estelle for the moment, and called  Gray Haviland.</p>
  <p>The young man&#8217;s appearance gave every promise of  frankness and sincerity. He detailed the circumstances precisely as Pauline had  told them. He denied having heard or seen anything suspicious during the night.  He referred to the Coroner&#8217;s list of motives for crime, and added that he agreed  with Miss Stuart that the present case could scarcely be ascribed to love or  revenge. If the murder was committed for gain, it was, of course, a formal  necessity to question all the beneficiaries of Miss Carrington&#8217;s will, but he  was sure that all such inheritors were quite willing to be questioned. For his  part, he believed that the criminal was some enemy of Miss Carrington, unknown  to her immediate household, and he suggested that such a one be searched for.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got that glove,&#8221; he reminded, &#8220;that was  found clasped in the hand of the murdered woman. Why not trace that; or  endeavor to learn in some way the reason for the many peculiar circumstances;  or discover, at least, a way to look for further evidence; rather than to  vaguely suspect those who lived under Miss Carrington&#8217;s roof?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I am not asking your assistance in conducting  this inquiry, Mr. Haviland,&#8221; and the Coroner spoke shortly; &#8220;but pursuing my  own plan of obtaining evidence in my own way. Will you kindly answer questions without  comment on them?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, all right; fire away. Only remember, that  we relatives and friends are just as much interested in clearing up this  mystery as you are, and we want to help, if we can be allowed to do so  intelligently.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Asked again if he saw or heard anything unusual  in the night, Haviland replied, &#8220;You said &#8216;suspicious&#8217; the other time. I did  see something <i>unusual</i>. I saw Estelle  go stealthily downstairs at three A.M. That&#8217;s unusual, but I don&#8217;t go so far as  to call it suspicious.&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades8">Chapter 8</a><br>
    Anita&#8217;s Story</b></h2>
  <p>Instead of showing surprise at this statement,  the Coroner broke the breathless silence that followed it, by saying:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Will you please explain what you mean by &#8216;stealthily?&#8217;&#8220;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just what I say,&#8221; returned Haviland, bluntly. &#8220;She  went slowly, now and then pausing to listen, twice drawing back around a corner  and peeping out, and then coming forth again; she wore no shoes and carried no  light; she went down the big staircase in the manner I have described, and  after about ten minutes, returned in the same fashion. That&#8217;s what I mean by stealthily.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What was your errand?&#8221; asked Scofield of  Estelle.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing. I didn&#8217;t go,&#8221; she replied, coolly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;She tells an untruth,&#8221; said Gray, calmly. &#8220;She  did go, just as I have described. But it was doubtless on an innocent errand. I  have no idea she was implicated in Miss Carrington&#8217;s death. I am sure it is of  casual explanation,&#8212;or, I was sure, until Estelle denied it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How was it you chanced to see her?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I was wakeful, and I was prowling around to  find something to read. I went out in the hall and got a magazine from the  table, and had returned to my room and was just closing the door, when I saw a  white figure glide across the hall. She passed through a moonlit space or I  could not have seen her. She was wrapped in a light or white kimono thing, and  I should never have thought of it again if it were not for what has happened.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You knew it to be this Estelle?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes; her red hair was hanging in a braid.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;&#8216;Tisn&#8217;t red!&#8221; snapped Estelle, but Mr. Scofield  silenced her with a frown.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, auburn, then,&#8221; said Haviland, easily. &#8220;You  may as well own up, Estelle; what did you go down for?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t go,&#8221; repeated the maid, obstinately,  and no cross-questioning could prevail on her to admit otherwise.</p>
  <p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; and Haviland shrugged his shoulders;  &#8220;I suppose it doesn&#8217;t matter, as the crime was committed about one o&#8217;clock. It&#8217;s  up to you, Mr. Coroner, to find some person who acted suspiciously nearer that  time. And, by the way, as man of business of this estate, unless some worthwhile  evidence is forthcoming pretty soon, I&#8217;m going to round up a detective or two  who will get somewhere.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Give us a little more time, Mr. Haviland,&#8221; said  Scofield, suavely, &#8220;this inquest is only begun.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, get it over with, and then, if the truth  hasn&#8217;t come to light, I&#8217;ll take a hand.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Miss Frayne was called next, and Anita, with a  look of importance on her pretty face, came forward.</p>
  <p>Her evidence, at first, was merely a repetition  of that already heard, and she corroborated Pauline&#8217;s recital of the scene as  the two girls bade Miss Carrington good-night.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And then?&#8221; prompted the Coroner.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then I went to my room, but I didn&#8217;t retire. I  sat thinking over what Miss Carrington had said to me. And as I thought about  it, I concluded that this time I was really dismissed from her secretaryship.  And that made me feel very sorry, for it is a good position and I&#8217;ve no wish to  lose it. So,&#8212;after a time, I began to think I would go to Miss Carrington&#8217;s  room and if she were still up, I would beg her forgiveness.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Forgiveness for what?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;For any fancied grievance she might have  against me. I have always tried to please her, but she was, er,&#8212;difficult, and  it was not easy to do the right thing at all times.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did you go to her room?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I went to the door&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;At what time?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Soon after one o&#8217;clock. Not more than five or  ten minutes after.&#8221;</p>
  <p>There was a rustle of excitement. The poison was  said to be administered at about one! Did this fair doll-like girl know the  secret of the tragedy?</p>
  <p>&#8220;Proceed, Miss Frayne; tell the story of  anything you saw at that time.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I saw nothing. But I heard a great deal.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The door of Miss Carrington&#8217;s room was closed,  and I was about to tap at it, when I heard talking inside. I paused, and I  listened, in order to discover if her maid was still with her, or some one  else. If it had been Estelle, I should have tapped for admittance. But it was  not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I cannot say. The voice I heard distinctly was  that of Miss Carrington herself. Her voice was high-pitched, and of what is  called a carrying sort. The things she said were so strange, I lingered,  listening, for I was so surprised I couldn&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;First, I heard her say, quite plainly, &#8216;Your  face is the most beautiful I have ever seen! I wish mine were as beautiful.&#8217; I  assumed, then, she must be talking to Miss Stuart, for surely she would not say  that to her maid. Then she said, &#8216;But, to-morrow, I shall be forever freed from  this homely face of mine.&#8217;&#8220;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss Frayne, this is very singular! Are you  sure you heard correctly?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I am sure. But there is more. She next said, &#8216;To-morrow  you will be glad!&#8212;<i>glad!&#8217;</i> It was  almost a scream, that. And she went on, &#8216;To-morrow all these jewels will be  yours,&#8212;if you&#8212;ah, but <i>will</i> you?&#8217; and  then her voice trailed off faintly, and I could hear no more.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You heard nothing more at all?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes; I waited,&#8212;oh, I admit I was eavesdropping,  but it was so strange I couldn&#8217;t help it,&#8212;there was silence. It may well be  some one else was replying to her, but I could not make out any other person&#8217;s  words. A low voice would not be audible like a high-pitched one. But after a  moment, Miss Carrington resumed; she said, &#8216;I shall change my will. Not Carr&#8217;s half,  that must stand. But the other half shall never go to a niece who has no  affection for me!&#8217; Again I heard nothing, for the responses were inaudible.  Then Miss Carrington said, in a musing tone: &#8216;I have already willed you ten  thousand dollars of those United States bonds, but&#8212;&#8217; And then, after quite a  long pause, Miss Carrington cried out, not loudly, but tensely, &#8216;Henri, Henri! <i>you</i> are the mark I aim at!&#8217; That frightened  me so, I ran swiftly back to my room, and locked the door.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You assumed Henri to be Count Charlier?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I had no other construction to put upon the  words.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You thought the gentleman was in Miss Carrington&#8217;s  room?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t think that! And yet, it sounded as  if she were speaking to him, not of him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;This is a very strange story, Miss Frayne. Have  you mentioned these things you overheard to any one before this?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No. I have thought them over, and concluded it  was best to tell the story first to you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And quite right. It is, then, your opinion that  there was another person in Miss Carrington&#8217;s room, to whom she was speaking?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It seemed so to me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But you did not hear this other person&#8217;s voice?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Anita paused a moment and then said: &#8220;Not  distinctly.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did you hear it at all?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I cannot say. When I did not hear Miss  Carrington&#8217;s voice clearly, there were sounds that might have been another  person or her own voice speaking more inaudibly.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Might it not be that she was merely talking to  herself,&#8212;soliloquizing?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It could not have been that. She spoke  definitely and decidedly <i>to</i> some one  when she said &#8216;Your face is beautiful,&#8217; and when she said, &#8216;I have willed you  ten thousand dollars,&#8217; indeed, every thing she said was as if spoken to some  hearer; not as one who talks to herself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;After you regained your room, did you leave it  again?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, I did not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;H&#8217;m. Now, are you positive, Miss Frayne, that  all these speeches were said just as you have repeated them? It is a great  strain on the memory to repeat accurately a conversation as long as the one you  have just rehearsed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The speeches I heard are burned into my brain.  I could not forget them if I would. I may have erred in some minor or  unimportant words, but the most of what I heard is precisely as I have repeated  it. Indeed, so thoroughly was I amazed at it all, I wrote it down as soon as I  reached my room. I had then no thought of&#8212;of what was going to happen, but Miss  Carrington had made peculiar remarks during the evening about something happening  to her, and in connection with that the words I heard seemed so remarkable,&#8212;not  to say uncanny,&#8212;that I made a note of them. This is not an unusual habit with  me. I often make notes of conversations, as it has been useful in my services  as secretary.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;As how?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If a caller in a social or business way had  conversation with Miss Carrington, and I was present, I often made a record, in  case she asked me later just what had been said.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I see. And how do you interpret the words, &#8216;Henri,  you are the mark I aim at?&#8217;&#8220;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I can only think that Miss Carrington was in  favor of considering a marriage between herself and the Count.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You made use of the word &#8216;uncanny.&#8217; Do you  imagine that Miss Carrington had any foreboding of her approaching doom?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;When I heard her say, &#8216;To-morrow I will be  forever freed from this homely face of mine,&#8217; and &#8216;to-morrow all these jewels  will be yours,&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t help thinking,&#8212;after the discovery of her death,&#8212;that  she must have anticipated it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did her voice sound like the despairing one of  a person about to die?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;On the contrary, it sounded full of life and  animation.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did she seem angry with the person to whom she  was speaking?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;At times, yes. And, again, no. Her voice showed  varying emotions as she talked on.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Her speech was not continuous, then?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not at all. It was broken, and in snatches.  But, remember, I could not hear all of what she said, and the other person or  persons not at all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did you not catch a word from the other voice?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I cannot say. Much, in a low tone, that I could  not hear clearly, might have been Miss Carrington&#8217;s voice or another&#8217;s. The  door was closed, and as soon as I realized there was some one there, not  Estelle, I had no thought of knocking, and I soon went away. I ought to have  gone away sooner, and would have done so, but I was so amazed and puzzled I  stayed on involuntarily.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Your story, Miss Frayne, is very extraordinary.  Can you suggest, from what you heard, who might have been in the room with Miss  Carrington?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I can not, nor do I wish to. I have told you  what I heard, it is for you to make deductions or discoveries.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I wish to say a word, Mr. Coroner,&#8221; and Pauline  Stuart, with her dark eyes blazing, rose to her feet. &#8220;I am sorry to say this,  but I must ask you to hesitate before you put too much faith in the amazing  tale you have just listened to. I am sure Miss Frayne could not have heard all that  nonsense! It is impossible, on the face of it, that my aunt should have  received any one in her room after her maid left her. It is incredible that she  should have made all those ridiculous and meaningless remarks! And it is  despicable for any woman to imply or hint that Miss Carrington was receiving a  gentleman caller! I am surprised that you even listened to what must be the  ravings of a disordered mind!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline looked at Anita like an avenging  goddess. But the darts of scorn from her dark eyes were met and returned in  kind from the big blue ones of the secretary.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I resent your tone and your words,&#8221; said Anita,  deliberately; &#8220;but since you choose to adopt that attitude, I will go on to say  what I had intended not to reveal, that I saw you coming from your aunt&#8217;s room,  after the conversation I have told of took place.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; said the Coroner; &#8220;you said that  immediately after hearing the alleged conversation you went at once to your  room, and did not leave it again.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nor did I. But a few minutes later, unable to  restrain my curiosity, I opened my door, and looked out. My position then  commanded a full view of the hall, and I saw Miss Stuart go from her aunt&#8217;s  room to her own.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline looked at the speaker. Coldly her glance  swept back to the Coroner, and she said: &#8220;I deny that I was in my aunt&#8217;s room  after leaving it at midnight in company with Miss Frayne. But she forces me to  tell that <i>I</i> saw <i>her</i> going away from it at exactly quarter past one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How do you fix the time so accurately?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I was sitting in the upper hall,&#8212;it is really a  sitting-room, at the bay-windowed end,&#8212;looking at the moon. I, too, had been  disturbed at my aunt&#8217;s attitude, and her threats to send me away to-day, and I  had gone to the hall window-seat, a favorite haunt of mine, and had sat there  for a half hour or more.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Could any one going through the hall see you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Probably not, as the draperies are heavy, and I  was in the deep window-seat. I was thinking I would go to my room, and then I  saw Miss Frayne come from my aunt&#8217;s room and go to her own.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Are you sure she came from the room?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She was closing the door, her hand was on the  knob. She did not see me, I am sure, for I drew back in the window and watched  her. And just then I heard the hall clock chime the quarter after one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t see Miss Frayne when she went to  Miss Carrington&#8217;s room?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No; I suppose I was then looking out of the  deep window.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nor did you hear her?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, the rugs are thick and a light foot-fall  makes no sound.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What did you next do?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I went&#8212;I went straight to my own room.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The slight hesitation told against Pauline. All  through her testimony, all through her arraignment of Anita,&#8212;for it amounted to  that,&#8212;she had been cool, calm and imperturbable. But now a momentary hesitation  of speech, added perhaps, to the circumstantial story of Anita Frayne, caused a  wave of doubt,&#8212;not enough to call suspicion,&#8212;but a questioning attitude to form  in the minds of many of the audience.</p>
  <p>To whom, if not Miss Stuart, could Miss  Carrington&#8217;s remarks about beauty have been addressed? It was well known that  Miss Lucy adored beauty and had all her life lamented her own lack of it. This  was no secret woe of the poor lady&#8217;s. To any one who would listen, she would  complain of her hard lot in having all the gifts of the gods except good looks.  To whom else would she say &#8216;To-morrow all these jewels will be yours,&#8212;if you&#8212;ah,  but <i>will</i> you?&#8217;</p>
  <p>And yet, after all, it did not make sense. Was  it not far more likely to be a figment of Miss Frayne&#8217;s clever mind, for what  purpose who might say?</p>
  <p>At any rate, their stories were contradictory  and moreover were garbled.</p>
  <p>The jurymen sighed. The case had been mysterious  enough before, now it was becoming inexplicable.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades9">Chapter 9</a><br>
    Further Testimony</b></h2>
  <p>Count Henri Charlier was being questioned, and  he was distinctly ill at ease. His French <i>savoir  faire</i> was not proof against definite inquiries as to his intentions regarding  the late Miss Carrington, and indefinite allusions concerning his movements on  the night of her death.</p>
  <p>He had related, straightforwardly enough, his  visit at Garden Steps that evening and his departure at or about midnight. He  denied his engagement of marriage, but admitted that he had paid Miss  Carrington such attentions as might lead her to suspect an attachment.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You did not return to this house after leaving  on Tuesday night?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Most assuredly not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You were not in Miss Carrington&#8217;s boudoir at one  o&#8217;clock or thereabouts?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Count Charlier&#8217;s black eyes snapped. But by a  successful effort he controlled his indignation, and said, simply, &#8220;I was not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But she was heard to address you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Impossible, as I was not there.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She distinctly declared that you were the mark  she aimed at. What construction do you put upon those words?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It is not for me to boast of my attraction for  a lady.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Count Charlier simpered a little, and Gray  Haviland looked at him with a frown of undisguised scorn. Haviland had never liked  the Count, indeed, he even doubted his right to the title, and especially had  he feared a marriage between him and Miss Lucy. And, granting that this feeling  was partly due to a consideration of his own interests, Haviland also distrusted  the Frenchman and doubted Miss Lucy&#8217;s happiness as his wife.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did Miss Carrington leave you a bequest of ten  thousand dollars in United States bonds?&#8221; went on the Coroner.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8212;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; and the Count stammered in an  embarrassed way.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You do know!&#8221; shouted Haviland; &#8220;the will has  been read, and you know perfectly well that such a bequest was left to you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why did you deny the knowledge?&#8221; asked  Scofield, sternly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&#8212;I&#8217;m not sure&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You are sure!&#8221; stormed Gray. &#8220;Now where were  you when Miss Carrington spoke those words to you? If not in her boudoir, then  on the balcony outside the window, perhaps.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Absurd,&#8221; said the Coroner.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Gray; &#8220;that window opens on a  balcony enclosed by glass. It is easily reached from outside by a small  staircase, mostly used in summer, but always available. How could Miss  Carrington speak to the Count concerning the bonds and concerning her  infatuation for himself, which is no secret, unless he were there before her?  And how could he be in the room&#8212;in her boudoir&#8212;unknown to the servants? Moreover,  Mr. Coroner, I believe the glove found in Miss Carrington&#8217;s hand to be the  property of Count Charlier.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But no!&#8221; cried the witness, excitedly; &#8220;I have  repeatedly disclaimed that glove. It is not mine, I know not whose it is. I  know nothing of this sad affair, whatever. If the money is left to me, as I  have been told, it is a&#8212;a surprise to me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Surprise nothing!&#8221; murmured Haviland, but he  said no more to the Count.</p>
  <p>&#8220;If my story might be told now,&#8212;&#8221; ventured Mrs.  Frothingham.</p>
  <p>After a moment&#8217;s hesitation, Coroner Scofield  decided to let her tell it, as having a possible bearing on Count Charlier&#8217;s  testimony.</p>
  <p>The rather stunning-looking widow was  fashionably dressed, and she fluttered with an air of importance as she took  the stand. She related again the story she had told of the supposed burglar,  whom she saw leaving the living-room by way of a window, at four o&#8217;clock on  Wednesday morning.</p>
  <p>&#8220;How can you be so sure it was a burglar?&#8221; asked  Scofield.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, he looked like one. All huddled up, you  know, and his face buried between a high coat collar and a drawn-down cap. And  he walked slyly,&#8212;sort of glided among the shrubs and trees, as if avoiding  notice. No man on legitimate business would skulk like that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Might it not have been Count Charlier?&#8221; asked  the Coroner, bluntly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; and Mrs. Frothingham gave a  little shriek. &#8220;The Count is a slim and elegant figure; this was a stocky,  burly man; a marauder, I know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; said the Coroner, wearily. &#8220;It may  be that a burglar was concealed in the house, or let in by a servant, and that  he attacked Miss Carrington as she was seated at her dressing table. It seems  impossible that he should have administered poison to her, however, and the conjoined  circumstances may indicate collusion between&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Between whom?&#8221; asked Inspector Brunt.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; confessed Scofield. &#8220;Every way I  try to think it out, I ran up against an impassable barrier.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say,&#8221; began Haviland; &#8220;it is a  most involved case. I shall cable Carrington Loria for authority to employ an  expert detective.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why cable him?&#8221; asked Pauline; &#8220;I am equally in  authority now. Carr and myself each receive half the residuary estate of Aunt  Lucy, and, of course, I am as anxious to find the&#8212;the murderer, as Carr can  possibly be.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, somebody will have to authorize it who is  willing to pay for it. As man of business in this home, I am willing to attend  to all such matters, but I must have authority.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You seem to me a little premature, Mr.  Haviland,&#8221; commented the Inspector. &#8220;Perhaps when the inquest is concluded, it  may not be necessary to call on any other detective than our own Mr. Hardy.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; agreed Haviland; &#8220;but unless you  people all wake up, you&#8217;re not going to get anywhere. I admit the getting is  difficult, but that&#8217;s just the reason a wise sleuth should be called in before  the trails grow cold.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And then the Coroner returned to his task of  questioning Mrs. Frothingham.</p>
  <p>The widow was not definitely helpful. Her  statements were often contradictory in minor details, and when she corrected  them they seemed to lose in weight. She stuck to the main points, however, that  by the help of a strong field-glass she had discerned, in the bright moonlight,  a man leave by way of the French window, at four o&#8217;clock, and had seen him make  his way stealthily out by the great entrance gates of the place.</p>
  <p>Cross-questioning on this brought no variations,  and the jurymen wagged their heads in belief of her story.</p>
  <p>But her accounts of her own doings on Tuesday  evening were vague and indefinite.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I was in my own home all the evening,&#8221; she said  at one time; and again, &#8220;I went out for a short walk at eleven o&#8217;clock.&#8221; This  last in refutation of Haskins, the Carrington butler, who deposed to having  seen the lady walk across the lawns of Garden Steps.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where did you walk?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, just around my own place; and for a moment  I strolled over here because the Steps looked so beautiful in the moonlight.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You were alone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I was. I have no house guests at present, save  the Count; and as my brother, who lives with me, is on a Western trip, I was  alone, and I walked about to kill time until Count Charlier should return after  his bridge game over here.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did you walk near the house, while on the  Garden Steps&#8217; estate?&#8221; asked Scofield, scenting a possible espionage of her  titled visitor.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; and the witness bristled with  indignation; &#8220;why should I! I was not really an acquaintance of Miss  Carrington, merely a neighbor.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Beg pardon, ma&#8217;am, but I saw you on the  conservatory verandah,&#8221; said Haskins, in a deprecatory way.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That is not true, Mr. Coroner,&#8221; said the lady,  glancing scornfully at the butler. &#8220;I beg you will not accept a servant&#8217;s  statement in preference to mine!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You are sure of this, Haskins?&#8221; said the  Inspector gravely.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Sure, sir.&#8221; and the man looked  doggedly certain, though a little scared.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And you deny it?&#8221; went on Scofield to Mrs.  Frothingham.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I most certainly do! How absurd for me to be  over here, and how more than absurd for me to deny it if I were!&#8221;</p>
  <p>This seemed sensible. Why should she deny it?  And mightn&#8217;t the butler be mistaken? Or deliberately falsifying?</p>
  <p>If there were collusion or criminal assistance  by any of the servants, surely the word of all of them must be mistrusted  unless proven.</p>
  <p>And, too, what could have brought Mrs.  Frothingham to the verandah of a home where she was not an accepted guest? Or,  could she have been spying on the Count?</p>
  <p>For it had slowly entered the Coroner&#8217;s not very  alert mind that perhaps the volatile widow had her own plans for the Count&#8217;s  future, and Miss Carrington did not figure in them. The manner of the witness  bore out this theory. She was self-conscious and at times confused. She  frequently looked at the Count and then quickly averted her gaze. She blushed  and stammered when speaking his name or referring to him. In a word, she acted  as a woman might act in regard to a man of whom she was jealous. And the  situation bore it out. If Mrs. Frothingham had matrimonial designs on her  distinguished guest, would she not naturally resent his visits to a rich  neighbor? Mrs. Frothingham was not rich, and she may well have been afraid of  Miss Carrington&#8217;s charm of gold, which could cause many a man to overlook  anything else that might be lacking.</p>
  <p>Coroner Scofield was getting more and more tangled  in the mazes of this extraordinary case. He was practically at his wits&#8217; end.  At last he blurted out: &#8220;It is impossible, it seems, to get a coherent, or even  plausible story from a woman! Is there any man present, who knows any of the  details of the happenings of Tuesday evening and night?&#8221;</p>
  <p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence at this rather  petulant speech, and then Stephen Illsley rose, and speaking very gravely,  said:</p>
  <p>&#8220;It seems to be my unpleasant duty to tell what  little I know of these matters.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The relieved Coroner heard this with  satisfaction. Accepting his good fortune, he prepared to listen to Illsley&#8217;s  testimony.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I was spending the evening here,&#8221; the witness  began, &#8220;and during my visit I was in the various rooms. At a late hour, perhaps  something after eleven,&#8212;I was crossing the hall, and I saw Mrs. Frothingham on  the stairway.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;On the stairway!&#8221; exclaimed the Coroner, in  amazement.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned Illsley, his grave eyes resting  on the face of the widow, who stared at him as if stricken dumb. &#8220;Yes, I saw  her distinctly. She was evidently coming downstairs, one hand rested on the  banister, and she was looking upward at the ceiling.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did she see you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I think not. If so, she made no sign. But she  was not looking my way, and I went on into the reception room, where I was  going in search of a scarf Miss Stuart had left there. When I recrossed the  hall, the lady had disappeared.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did not this seem to you a strange  circumstance?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I had no right to any opinion on the subject.  It was not my affair what guests were at the house I was visiting, or what they  might be doing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But Mrs. Frothingham asserts she was not an  acquaintance of Miss Carrington.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I did not know that, then; and even so, it gave  me no right to speculate concerning the lady&#8217;s presence there. Nor should I  refer to it now, except that in view of the subsequent tragedy it is due to  every principle of right and justice that all truths be known as to that evening.  Mrs. Frothingham will, of course, recall the episode and can doubtless explain  it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I should like to hear the explanation!&#8221; said  Pauline, with flashing eyes. &#8220;As mistress here now, I am interested to know why  a stranger should wander about this house at will.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Frothingham sat silent. Her face showed not  so much consternation or dismay as a cold, calculating expression, as if  debating just what explanation she should offer.</p>
  <p>At last she spoke. &#8220;I may as well own up,&#8221; she  said, and laughed nervously. &#8220;I <i>was</i> on the verandah, as the vigilant butler noticed. I did step inside the hall, as  I had so often heard of the rare tapestries and paintings, and, in my <i>ennui</i>, I thought it no harm to take a  peep. The great door was ajar, and I was a little chilled by my walk across the  lawns. I said to myself, if I meet any one I will merely beg a few moments&#8217;  grace and then run away. Yes, I did take a step or two up the stair, to look at  a picture on the landing. It was all innocent enough, perhaps not in the best  of taste, but I was lonely, and the light and warmth lured me. In a moment I  had slipped out and run away home, laughing over my escapade like a foolish  child.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Her light laugh rippled out as she concluded her  story. She looked ingenuous and truthful, but the Coroner distrusted feminine  fairy-tales, and this was a little too fanciful to be true.</p>
  <p>Moreover, Mrs. Frothingham was looking at him  sharply from the corner of her eye. Clearly, she was watching him to see how he  took it.</p>
  <p>He didn&#8217;t take it very well. The acknowledged  presence of an outsider in the house, for a not very plausible reason, was  illuminating in his estimation. She had been on the stairway. Had she been to  Miss Carrington&#8217;s room? True, she said she went only to the landing,&#8212;but pshaw,  women had no regard for the truth! Had she and Count Charlier planned between  them to&#8212;bah, <i>why</i> did this woman want  to kill her neighbor? Even if she were jealous of the Count&#8217;s attention, would  she go so far as crime? No, of course not! He must question her further. And yet,  what good would that do, if she would not tell the truth?</p>
  <p>Well, she was in the house at half-past eleven,  that much was certain, for Stephen Illsley&#8217;s story and her own and also the  butler&#8217;s testimony all coincided as to that.</p>
  <p>And then, Detective Hardy, who had just returned  from a short errand, made a startling statement. He declared that the glove  which had been found clasped tightly in the dead fingers of the late Miss  Carrington did belong to Count Henri Charlier.</p>
  <p>Mr. Hardy had been searching the Count&#8217;s  wardrobe, and though he did not find the mate to that particular glove, he  found many others, some worn and some entirely unused, but all of the same size  and made by the same firm as the one now in the Coroner&#8217;s possession!</p>
  <p>Thus cornered Count Charlier reluctantly  admitted that it was his glove.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I denied it,&#8221; he thus excused himself, &#8220;because  I have no idea how it came into Miss Carrington&#8217;s possession, and I did not  wish to implicate her in an affair with my unworthy self.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; thought Gray Haviland, fixing his  attention on the Count and on the flustered Mrs. Frothingham; &#8220;a precious pair  of adventurers! I expect Scofield is right, we won&#8217;t need an expert detective.&#8221;</p>
  <p>There was more of the inquest. But its  continuance brought out no developments not already here transcribed. There was  much cross-questioning and probing; there was much rather futile effort to make  all the strange details fit any one theory; there was variance of opinion; and  there was more or less dissension.</p>
  <p>But as a final result, the Coroner&#8217;s jury  brought in a verdict that Miss Lucy Carrington met her death by poison  administered by a person or persons unknown, who thereafter, probably for the  purpose of diverting attention from the poison, struck her a blow on the head.  The jury in their deliberation felt that Count Henri Charlier was implicated.  But not having sufficient evidence to make a charge, suggested to the detective  force that he be kept under surveillance.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades10">Chapter 10</a><br>
    Bizarre Clues</b></h2>
  <p>It was Saturday. The funeral of Miss Carrington  had been held the day before and the imposing obsequies had been entirely in  keeping with her love of elaborate display in life. The casket was of the  richest, the flowers piled mountain high, the music, the most expensive  available; for the young people in charge had felt it incumbent on them to  arrange everything as Miss Lucy would have desired it.</p>
  <p>It was a pathetic commentary on the character of  the dead woman that while all who mourned her felt the shock and horror of her  death, they were not deeply bowed with sorrow. Pauline, as nearest relative,  would naturally grieve most, but for the moment her affections were lost sight of  in the paralyzing effects of the sudden tragedy.</p>
  <p>Anita Frayne had practically &#8220;gone to pieces.&#8221;  She was nervous, and jumped twitchingly if any one spoke to her.</p>
  <p>Gray Haviland was reticent, an unusual thing for  him, and devoted most of his time to matters of business connected with the  estate.</p>
  <p>Estelle, the maid, had succumbed to a nervous  break-down, and had been taken to a nearby sanatorium, where she indulged in  frequent and violent hysterics.</p>
  <p>The household was in a continual excitement.  Lawyers and detectives were coming and going, neighbors were calling, and  reporters simply infested the place.</p>
  <p>Pauline and Anita, though outwardly polite, were  not on good terms, and rarely talked together.</p>
  <p>But this morning the two girls and Haviland were  called to a confab by Hardy, the detective.</p>
  <p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve arrested the Count,&#8221; Hardy began, and  Anita screamed an interruption:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Arrested Count Charlier! Put him in jail?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned the detective. &#8220;I found the  other one of that pair of gloves, the mate to the one in the lady&#8217;s hands,&#8212;where,  do you suppose?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rolled up in a pair of socks, in the Count&#8217;s  chiffonnier drawer; of course, to hide it, as it is not at all easy to destroy  a thing like that while visiting.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said Pauline, earnestly; &#8220;it is  hard. I&#8217;ve often noticed that, when I&#8217;ve wanted to burn a letter or anything.  You can&#8217;t do it, unknown to the servants or somebody.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rubbish!&#8221; said Anita, &#8220;It would have been easy  for the Count to dispose of a glove if he had wanted to. But he didn&#8217;t. He  never committed that crime! If a glove was found, as you say, somebody else put  it there to incriminate an innocent man. It&#8217;s too absurd to fasten the thing on  Count Charlier! Do you suppose he went to the boudoir and gave Miss Carrington poison,  and then shook hands good-evening, and left his glove in her grasp? Nonsense!  The glove in her dead hand was put there by the criminal to implicate the  Count, and the glove in the rolled-up socks for the same purpose and by the  same person!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;By Jove, Miss Frayne! You may be right!&#8221; cried  Hardy. &#8220;Somehow I can&#8217;t see the Count&#8217;s hand in this thing, and yet&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And yet, he did it!&#8221; put in Haviland. &#8220;Have  they really jailed him? I&#8217;m glad.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said Pauline, and her face was  white; &#8220;Did he&#8212;did he&#8212;c-confess?&#8221; The girl&#8217;s voice trembled, and she could  scarcely pronounce the words.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not he,&#8221; said Hardy; &#8220;he seemed dazed, and  declared his innocence,&#8212;but he was not convincing. He takes it very hard and  talks wildly and at random. But you know what Frenchmen are; liable to go off  their heads at any time.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But look at it,&#8221; reasoned Anita; &#8220;<i>why</i> would the Count kill Miss Carrington?  Why, he thought of marrying her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not much he didn&#8217;t!&#8221; and Hardy smiled a little.  &#8220;I size it up this way. Matters had gone so far that he had to propose to the  lady or clear out. He didn&#8217;t want to clear out for then she would take back the  little matter of ten thousand dollars already marked for him in her will. Moreover,  he couldn&#8217;t realize that tidy little sum, which he very much wants, so long as  she lived. To be sure, he would have had far more, had he married her, but that  was not in &#8216;his nibs&#8217;&#8217; plans. So he resorted to desperate measures. He&#8217;s a  thorough villain, that man! Outwardly, most correct and honorable, but really,  an adventurer, as is also his friend, the dashing young widow.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr. Hardy,&#8221; and Pauline spoke calmly, now, &#8220;do  you <i>know</i> these things to be true of  Count Charlier, or are you assuming them?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, Miss Stuart, I know human nature pretty  well, especially male human nature, and if I&#8217;m mistaken in this chap, I&#8217;ll be  surprised. But also, I&#8217;ve set afoot an investigation, and we&#8217;ll soon learn his  record, antecedents and all that. At present, no one knows much about him; and what  Mrs. Frothingham knows she won&#8217;t tell.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It was very strange for Aunt Lucy to give him  that money&#8212;&#8221; began Pauline musingly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; broke in Gray, &#8220;I know all about  that. Miss Carrington had a certain bunch of bonds that amounted to just fifty  thousand dollars. In one of her sudden bursts of generosity, and she often had  such, she decided to give those bonds to five people. I mean, to devise them in  her will, not to give them now. Well, four were Miss Stuart and Carr Loria, Miss  Frayne and myself. And then, she hesitated for some time, but finally announced  that the fifth portion should be named for the Count. I was there when the  lawyer fixed it up, and Miss Carrington turned to me and said, laughingly, &#8216;I  may change that before it comes due!&#8217; Oh, she was always messing with her will.  I&#8217;m glad there&#8217;s a tidy bit in it for me, as it is. Her demise <i>might</i> have taken place when I was for  the moment cut out.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Was there ever such a time?&#8221; asked Hardy.</p>
  <p>&#8220;There sure was! Only last month, she got firing  mad with me, and crossed me off without a shilling. Then she got over her mad  and restored me to favor.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You and Miss Frayne have other bequests than  those particular bonds you mentioned?&#8221; asked the detective.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, we have each ten thou&#8217; beside, which was  all right of the old lady, eh, Anita?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;None too much, considering what I have stood  from her capricious temper and eccentric ways,&#8221; returned the girl.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Your own temper is none too even,&#8221; said  Pauline, quietly; &#8220;I&#8217;d rather you wouldn&#8217;t speak ill of my aunt, if you please.&#8221;</p>
  <p>What might have been a passage at arms was  averted by the appearance of a footman with a cablegram.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from Carr!&#8221; exclaimed Pauline, as she tore  it open, and read:</p>
  <p>Awful news just received. Shall I come home or  will you come here? Let Haviland attend all business. Love and sympathy.</p>
  <p>Carrington Loria.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in Cairo,&#8221; commented Haviland, looking at  the paper; &#8220;that&#8217;s lucky. If he had been off up the Nile on one of his  excavating tours, we mightn&#8217;t have had communication for weeks. Well, he  practically retains me as business manager, at least for the present. And Lord  knows there&#8217;s a lot to be done!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand, Gray, why you look upon  Carr as more in authority than I am,&#8221; said Pauline, almost petulantly; &#8220;I am an  equal heir, and, too, I am here, and Carr is the other side of the world.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, Polly. I don&#8217;t know why, myself. I  suppose because he is the man of the family.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t make any difference. I think from  now on, Gray, it will be proper for you to consider me the head of the house as  far as business matters are concerned. You can pay Carr his half of the  residuary in whatever form he wants it. I shall keep the place, at least for  the present.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t Mr. Loria come back to America?&#8221; asked  Hardy.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I scarcely think so,&#8221; replied Pauline. &#8220;There&#8217;s  really no use of his doing so, unless he chooses. And I&#8217;m pretty sure he won&#8217;t  choose, as he&#8217;s so wrapped up in his work over there, that he&#8217;d hate to leave  unless necessary.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t he feel a necessity to help  investigate the murder?&#8221; urged Hardy.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; and Pauline looked thoughtful. &#8220;You  see what he says; when he asks if he shall come home, he means do I want him  to. If I don&#8217;t request it, I&#8217;m fairly sure he won&#8217;t come. Of course, when he  learns all the details, he will be as anxious as we that the murderer should be  found. But if I know Carr, he will far rather pay for the most expensive detective  service than come over himself. And, too, what could he do, more than we can?  We shall, of course, use every effort and every means to solve the mysteries of  the case, and he could advise us no better than the lawyers already in our  counsel.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all true,&#8221; said Haviland; &#8220;and I think  Loria means that when he puts me in charge of it all. But after a week or so we&#8217;ll  get a letter from him, and he&#8217;ll tell us what he intends to do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I shall cable him,&#8221; said Pauline, thoughtfully,  &#8220;not to come over unless he wants to. Then he can do as he likes. But he needn&#8217;t  come for my benefit. The property must be divided and all that, but we can  settle any uncertainties by mail or cable. And, I think I shall go on the trip  as we had planned it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You do!&#8221; said Gray, in amazement. &#8220;Go to Egypt?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, I don&#8217;t see why not. I&#8217;d like the trip,  and it would take my mind off these horrors. Our passage is booked for a  February sailing. If necessary I will postpone it a few weeks, but I see no  reason why I shouldn&#8217;t go. Do you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Haviland, slowly.</p>
  <p>Hardy seemed about to speak and then thought  better of it, and said nothing.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of course I shall not go,&#8221; began Anita, and  Pauline interrupted her with:</p>
  <p>&#8220;You go! I should say not! Why should you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I, if I choose?&#8221; returned Anita,  and her pink cheeks burned rosy. &#8220;I am my own mistress, I have my own money. I  am as free to go as you are.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of course you are,&#8221; said Pauline, coldly. &#8220;Only  please advise me on what steamer you are sailing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That you may take another,&#8221; and Anita laughed  shortly. &#8220;But I may prefer to go on the one you do. Aren&#8217;t you rather suddenly  anxious to leave this country?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline faced her. &#8220;Anita Frayne,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if  you suspect me of crime, I would rather you said so definitely, than to fling  out these continual innuendoes. Do you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t say that Pauline. But there are,&#8212;there  certainly are some things to be explained regarding your interview with your  aunt on Tuesday night. You know, I heard you in her room.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Your speech, Anita, is that of a guilty  conscience. As you well know, I saw you come from her room at the hour you  accuse me of being there.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let up, girls,&#8221; said Haviland; &#8220;you only make  trouble by that sort of talk.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But when an innocent man is arrested, Pauline  ought to tell what she knows!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I have told, and it seems to implicate you!&#8221;</p>
  <p>The impending scene was averted by Haviland, who  insisted on knowing what word should be sent to Loria.</p>
  <p>&#8220;May as well get it off,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it takes  long enough to get word back and forth to him, anyway. What shall I say for  you, Polly?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell him to come over or not, just as he  prefers, but that I shall be quite content if he does not care to come; and  that I shall go to Egypt as soon as I can arrange to do so. Put it into shape  yourself,&#8212;you know more about cabling than I do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Haviland went away to the library, and Hardy  followed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Look here, Mr. Haviland,&#8221; said the latter, &#8220;what  do these ladies mean by accusing each other of all sorts of things? Did either  of them have any hand in this murder?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not in a thousand years!&#8221; declared Gray,  emphatically. &#8220;The girls never loved each other, but lately, even before the  death of Miss Lucy, they have been at daggers drawn. I don&#8217;t know why, I&#8217;m  sure!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But what do you make of this story of Miss  Frayne&#8217;s about hearing Miss Stuart in her aunt&#8217;s room?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t hear her. I mean she didn&#8217;t hear  Miss Stuart; what she heard was Miss Carrington talking to herself. The old  lady was erratic in lots of ways.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why do you all say the old lady? She wasn&#8217;t  really old.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;About fifty. But she tried so hard to appear  young, that it made her seem older.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She was in love with the Count, of course?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes; as she was in love with any man she could  attach. No, that&#8217;s not quite true. Miss Lucy cared only for interesting men,  but if she could corral one of those, she used every effort to snare him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is the illustrious Count interesting?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She found him so. And, yes, he always  entertained us. She made that bequest to attract his attention and lure him on.  And then&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, and then?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, then he couldn&#8217;t withstand the temptation  and he shuffled her off, to make sure of the money now.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You think he killed her, then?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who else? Those girls never used a black-jack&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But the poison?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Had it been poison alone, there might be a  question. But that stunning blow has to be remembered. And neither Miss Stuart  nor Miss Frayne can be thought of for a moment in connection with that piece of  brutality.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But the snake? The queer costume?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The costume wasn&#8217;t so queer&#8212;for a boudoir garb.  The snake <i>is</i> inexplicable,&#8212;unless the  man has a disordered mind, and used insane methods to cover his tracks. Then  there&#8217;s the glove, you can&#8217;t get around that!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That glove might have been put in her hand by  anybody.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so! By a professional burglar, say! I  really believe&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, let up on that professional burglar  business! No burglar is going off without his loot, when he has uninterrupted  time enough to kill a person twice, with poison and then, to hide that, with a  fractured skull! How do you explain, even in theory, those two murderous  attacks?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good Lord, man, <i>I</i> don&#8217;t know! It&#8217;s all the most inexplicable muddle. I don&#8217;t see  how any of the things could happen, but they <i>did</i> happen! You&#8217;re the detective, not I! Aren&#8217;t you ever going to  discover anything?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I may as well own up, Mr. Haviland, I am beyond  my depth. There is a belief among detectives that the more bizarre and amazing  the clues are, the easier the deduction therefrom. But I don&#8217;t believe that.  This case is bizarre enough, in all conscience, yet what can one deduce from  that paper snake and that squeezed-up glove? It was all up in a little wad, you  know, not at all as if it were carelessly drawn from a man&#8217;s hand, or pulled  off in a struggle.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There was no struggle. The features were  composed, even almost smiling.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I know it. That proves it was no burglar. Well,  I&#8217;m up a tree. I wish you felt inclined to call in Fleming Stone. He&#8217;s the only  man on this continent who could unravel it all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I want to get him, but Miss Stuart won&#8217;t hear  of it. I&#8217;d have to have either her authority or Loria&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But Mr. Loria gave you full swing, in that  cable.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, for ordinary business matters. But this is  different. I&#8217;d have to have assurance that he&#8217;d pay the bills before I engaged  Stone. I&#8217;ve heard he&#8217;s some expensive.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that, too. But, by Jove, I&#8217;d like to  work with him! Or under him. I say, I wish you could bring it about.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I might cable Loria on my own, and not mention  it to Miss Stuart until I get the permission.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do. For as you say, the two ladies cannot  possibly be involved, and I, for one, don&#8217;t believe that nincompoop Count ever  pulled off such a complicated affair all by himself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What about the widow he&#8217;s visiting?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah, there you have it! Those two are in it, but  there&#8217;s more mystery yet.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have it straightened out,&#8221; said  Haviland, thoughtfully. &#8220;In a way, I feel responsible to Loria, since he has  put me in charge. And if he wants me to get Stone, I&#8217;ll be glad to do so. As  you say, it can&#8217;t affect the girls,&#8212;that stuff Anita made up was only to bother  Pauline. You see, Pauline came back at her with a counter accusation. They&#8217;re  both unstrung and upset, and they scarcely know what they&#8217;re saying.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s that French maid.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, Estelle. She&#8217;s a negligible quantity. She&#8217;s  hysterical from sheer nervousness, and she lies so fast she can hardly keep up  with herself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, think it over, and if you see your way  clear to call in Stone, I&#8217;ll be mighty glad. If the Frenchman <i>is</i> the guilty party, Stone will nail him  and prove it beyond all doubt. And if not, we surely don&#8217;t want an innocent man  to swing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That we don&#8217;t,&#8221; agreed Haviland.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades11">Chapter 11</a><br>
    Fleming Stone</b></h2>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, I have often heard the idea expressed that  the more bizarre the clues appear, the easier the solution of the mystery. And  this is frequently true.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone looked from one to another of the  interested group of listeners. They sat in the library,&#8212;Pauline, Anita, Gray  Haviland and the young detective, Hardy.</p>
  <p>Haviland had carried out his plan of cabling  Carrington Loria for authority to employ Mr. Stone, and had received a reply to  use his own judgment in all such matters and charge the expense to Loria&#8217;s  account.</p>
  <p>Pauline had been opposed to the idea of calling  Fleming Stone to the case, but as she seemed unable to put forth any valid  objections, Haviland had insisted until she gave her consent. So arrangements  had been quickly made, and the great Detective had reached Garden Steps on Wednesday  afternoon, just a week after the discovery of the murder.</p>
  <p>Previously unacquainted with Stone, the whole  household was interested in his personality, and this preliminary conversation  was by way of introduction.</p>
  <p>A man of nearly fifty, Fleming Stone was tall  and well proportioned, with a carriage and bearing that gave an impression of  strength. His clear-cut face and firm jaw gave the same character indications  as are seen in portraits of Lincoln, but his features were far more harmonious  than those of our rugged-faced president.</p>
  <p>Stone&#8217;s hair, thick and dark, was slightly  grayed at the temples, and his deep-set eyes were now lustrous, and again,  shadowed, like the water of a dark pool. His lean jaw and forceful mouth made  his face in repose somewhat stern, but this effect was often banished by his  delightful smile, which softened his whole countenance and gave him a distinct  air of friendliness.</p>
  <p>His manner was full of charm, and even Pauline  became fascinated as she watched him and listened to his talk.</p>
  <p>Fully at ease and skilfully directing the  conversation, while he seemed merely sharing it, Stone was studying and  classifying the new elements with which he had to deal. Not yet had he inquired  as to the details of the case in hand, he was discussing detective work in  general, much to the gratification of Tom Hardy, who listened as a pupil at the  feet of Gamaliel.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; went on Stone, settling back sociably in  his easy chair, while the others unconsciously fell into more informal  postures, &#8220;Yes, bizarre effects do often point the way to a successful quest.  Why, once, a man was found dead, with his feet in a tub of cold water. It was  discovered that his feet had been immersed after death had taken place.  Obviously the tub of water had been used as a blind, to fog up the case. But  the very character of the clue led at once to a man who was known as a &#8216;cold water  fiend,&#8217; and a fiend indeed he was. He was the murderer. You see, he was clever,  but not clever enough. He had wit enough to think of the queer circumstance of  the tub of water, but not enough to realize that the clue would lead directly  to his own undoing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Everybody looked thoughtful, but it was Hardy  who spoke; &#8220;Yes, Mr. Stone,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but that clue was put there on purpose.  Do you think these strange effects connected with Miss Carrington&#8217;s murder were  deliberately arranged?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That I can&#8217;t tell now, Mr. Hardy. In fact, I  have not heard a connected and circumstantial account of the discoveries, as  yet. Suppose we go over the case, leisurely, and let me get a complete account  by means of a general conversation. I will ask questions, or you may volunteer information,  as seems most enlightening. Tell me first of the character and characteristics  of Miss Carrington. Was she timid, or fearful of burglars?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Haviland. &#8220;She was careful to  have the house locked up at night by the servants, but she had no burglar  alarms or anything of that sort.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If a marauder had appeared, would she have been  likely to scream out in affright?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; volunteered Anita. &#8220;She  would more likely demand to know what he wanted and order him out.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yet the black-jack clearly indicates a burglar,&#8221;  went on Stone; &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine an ordinary citizen, of any calling, owning or  using such a weapon.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Have you examined the thing?&#8221; asked Haviland.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No; I should like to see it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Tom Hardy at once produced it, having brought it  with him from Police Headquarters for the purpose.</p>
  <p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; said Fleming Stone, as he fingered the  not very alarming-looking affair. In fact, it was merely a long, narrow bag,  made of dark cloth and filled with shot. The bag was tied tightly at one end  with a bit of twine to prevent the escape of the contents.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Home-made affair,&#8221; Stone went on. &#8220;Made  probably by a professional burglar, but an amateur murderer. See, it is merely  a bit of heavy cloth, out from an old coat sleeve or trouser leg, sewed up in a  bungling manner to make a bag. It is stitched with coarse black thread and the  stitches are drawn hard and firm, evidently pulled through by a strong hand.  Then, filled with shot, it is tied with a bit of old fish-line, which also is pulled  and knotted by muscular fingers. And&#8212;&#8221; Stone paused abruptly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And&#8212;&#8221; prompted Anita, breathlessly, her eyes  fixed on the speaker.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nothing much,&#8221; and Stone smiled; &#8220;only I should  say the burglar lived in a house recently remodeled.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Hardy nodded in satisfaction. This was the sort  of deduction he was looking for. Next he hoped for the color of the man&#8217;s hair,  and the sort of cigar he smoked. But he was doomed to disappointment.</p>
  <p>&#8220;We seem to have drifted from the subject of  Miss Carrington,&#8221; Stone said. &#8220;The evening before her death was she in her  usual spirits? Evidently no premonition of her fate?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; said Gray, &#8220;she remarked  during the evening that something would happen to her that night which would  surprise and astound us all. She said distinctly that &#8216;to-morrow everything  would be different.&#8217;&#8220;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What did you understand her to mean by that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t understand it at all. It was most  mysterious. Nor do we yet know what she meant. For surely she had no thought of  dying. She spent the evening playing cards and listening to music, and  conversation with the family and guests, quite as usual.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In amiable mood?&#8221; asked Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Pauline, taking up the talk; &#8220;on  the contrary she was exceedingly irritable and ill-tempered.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You saw her after she went to her room for the  night?&#8221; and Stone turned his whole attention to Pauline.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes; Miss Frayne and I always went to her room  with her, to say good-night and to receive possible orders or suggestions for  the next day&#8217;s occupations.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And you say she was unamiable?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That is a mild word,&#8221; and Pauline smiled a  little. &#8220;She was in a high temper, and she told us both that we were to leave  this house the next day.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You both left her in that mood?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, we were obliged to do so. She dismissed us  peremptorily and ordered us from the room.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And you saw her next, Miss Stuart, when?&#8221; asked  Fleming Stone gently.</p>
  <p>Pauline hesitated for a perceptible instant,  then she said, with a slight air of bravado, &#8220;next morning.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I have been told the main facts,&#8221; went on  Stone, &#8220;but I want to learn certain details. Please tell me, Miss Stuart,  exactly how she then appeared.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t!&#8221; and Pauline flung her face into  her hands with a short, sharp cry.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I should think you <i>couldn&#8217;t!&#8221;</i> exclaimed Anita, and her voice was distinctly accusing.</p>
  <p>This seemed to rouse Pauline, and she looked up  haughtily at the speaker. &#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder <i>you</i> think so!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;But since you ask, Mr. Stone, I will do the best I can.  My aunt was seated at her dressing-table, but not in her usual chair,&#8212;or  indeed, as if she were in any way attending to her toilette,&#8212;but in an easy  chair, more as if she were sitting there in contemplation.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Was she given to such indications of vanity?&#8221;  asked Stone, in a gentle way.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not at all. My aunt was not a beautiful woman,  and she had no illusions about her personal appearance. I have never known her  to look at herself in a mirror more than was necessary for her dressing. Her  maid will tell you this.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go on, please, Miss Stuart.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;When I saw my aunt, she was sitting placidly,  even smilingly,&#8212;and I did not, for a moment, imagine she was not alive. Then I  noticed her large tortoise-shell comb was broken to bits, and I noticed, too,  her rigid, staring face. The next few moments are a confused memory to me, but  I know I touched her hand and felt it cold, then I called to Mr. Haviland and  he came.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell me of your aunt&#8217;s garb. I understand it  was most unusual.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only in the accessories. The gown she had on  was a neglige of Oriental make and fabric, elaborate, but one of which she was  fond and which she had worn several times. Round her shoulders was a scarf, one  of those heavy Syrian ones, of net patterned with silver. Then, she had on quantities  of jewelry. Not only her pearls, and a few pins, which she had worn during the  evening, but she had added many brooches and bracelets and rings of great value.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She was wearing, let us say, a hundred thousand  dollars&#8217; worth of jewelry?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Far more than that. Her pearls alone are worth  that amount. Her diamond sunburst is valued at fifty thousand dollars and her  emerald brooch is equally valuable. My aunt believed in gems as an investment,  and though she usually kept them in a safe deposit vault, she had recently  taken them from there, and had them all in the house.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A strange proceeding?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very. I have never known such a thing to occur  before unless for some especial social occasion.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And the paper snake, of which I have been told&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That is the strangest part of all! My aunt was  not only afraid of live snakes, but she had also a perfect horror of any  picture or artificial representation of them. She could never, in her right  mind, have placed that paper snake about her own neck, nor would she have  allowed any one else to do it, without screaming out in horror. Yet, the  doctors declare it must have been placed round her neck before death.  Therefore, it is to me entirely unexplainable.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is not that a bizarre clue that should make the  case an easy one?&#8221; asked Anita, with an inquiring glance at Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It may be so,&#8221; he replied, with a thoughtful  look at her. &#8220;Where could such a snake have come from?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It was brought by the burglar, of course,&#8221; said  Pauline, quickly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that; but where could it be  bought?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, at Vantine&#8217;s or any Japanese shop,&#8221; said  Pauline, &#8220;or at some of the department stores.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Could you, by inquiry, find out if Miss  Carrington purchased it herself at any of those places?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I could inquire; but I am sure, Mr. Stone, that  Aunt Lucy never bought such a thing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It would simplify matters somewhat if you would  kindly find out,&#8221; and Stone nodded at her, as if to stamp this suggestion a  definite request.</p>
  <p>The conversation went on, and no one noticed  that so deftly did Fleming Stone guide it that only facts were brought out. No  sooner did any one begin to formulate an opinion or theory than he skilfully  turned the subject or changed the drift of the discussion.</p>
  <p>He gathered from facial expressions and manners  much that he wanted to know, he learned the attitudes of the various members of  the household toward each other, and he came to the conclusion that as Gray  Haviland had engaged him, and as he stood as business head of the estate by authority  of Carrington Loria, to Haviland should his reports be made.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tell me more of Mr. Loria,&#8221; Stone said, at  last, after many matters had been discussed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He and I are children of Miss Carrington&#8217;s two sisters,&#8221;  said Pauline. &#8220;Our parents all died when we were young children and Aunt Lucy  brought us both up. Carr, as we call him, lived with us, except for his college  terms, until four years ago. Then he had an opportunity to go to Egypt and  engage in excavation and ancient research work. He is absorbed in it, and has  been home only twice in the four years. It was planned that my aunt and I  should go to Egypt next month on a pleasure trip, and both he and we looked  forward eagerly to it. Miss Frayne was to accompany us, and Mr. Haviland also.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is it your intention to abandon the trip?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Speaking for myself, Mr. Stone, no,&#8221; and  Pauline looked determined. &#8220;I cannot answer for the others, but it seems to me  that such a visit to my cousin would be not only right and proper for me, but  the only way for me to find relief and distraction from these dreadful scenes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t go, I assume,&#8221; said Stone, gently, &#8220;until  the murderer of your aunt is apprehended with certainty?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I cannot say,&#8221; and suddenly Pauline flushed  rosily and looked distinctly embarrassed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rather not!&#8221; declared Anita, with an unpleasant  glance, and Fleming Stone made haste to introduce a new phase of the subject.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades12">Chapter 12</a><br>
    Estelle&#8217;s Story</b></h2>
  <p>At the invitation of Haviland, Fleming Stone was  a house guest at Garden Steps. Pauline had raised objections to this, but with  Carr Loria&#8217;s authority back of him, Gray had insisted, and Pauline unwillingly consented.</p>
  <p>Stone himself recognized the fact that Pauline  disliked him, or at any rate disliked having him on the case, but he ignored it  and showed to her the same gracious manner and pleasant attitude that he showed  to all. Anita, on the other hand, seemed charmed with Stone. She lost no opportunity  to talk with him, and she used every endeavor to attract his attention to  herself. In fact, she tried to flirt with him, and much to the surprise of the  others, Stone seemed ready to meet her advances and respond to them.</p>
  <p>The morning after his arrival, breakfast over,  Stone announced his intention of making a thorough examination of Miss  Carrington&#8217;s rooms, and asked that he be permitted to go alone for the purpose.</p>
  <p>&#8220;If Mr. Hardy comes, send him up,&#8221; he ordered,  as Haviland unlocked the door to give him admittance.</p>
  <p>Stone passed through the boudoir to the bedroom  and from that to the elaborate dressing-room and bath. Quickly he noted the  obvious details. Everything had been left practically untouched, and his rapid,  trained gaze took in the bed, turned down but not slept in; the toilet accessories  laid ready in the bathroom; and the fresh, unused towels, that proved the  unfortunate victim had not prepared to retire, but had, for some reason, donned  her jewels at that unusual hour.</p>
  <p>Back to the boudoir Stone went and made there  more careful scrutiny. Carefully he examined the white dust of powder on the  floor. At Hardy&#8217;s orders, this had not been swept away, and Stone stood, with  folded arms, looking at it. He saw the place where the powder had been smeared about,&#8212;he  had been told of this,&#8212;but he saw other places where faint footprints were to  his keen eye discernible. Not sufficiently clear to judge much of their  characteristics, but enough to show that a stockinged foot had imprinted them.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, what do you make of the tracks?&#8221; asked  Hardy, coming in upon his meditations.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Their tale is a short one but clear,&#8221; returned  Stone, smiling a greeting to the younger detective. &#8220;As you see, they go out of  the room only, they don&#8217;t come in.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Proving?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That the intruder came in at the door,  accomplished his dreadful purpose, and then, stepped around here in front of  his victim,&#8212;here where the powder is spilt, and then went straight out of the  room. Why did he do this?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He heard something to frighten him off?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He saw something that frightened him. I doubt  if he heard anything. But he dropped his black-jack and fled. Did you bring the  photographs of the scene?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, here they are.&#8221; Hardy handed over a sheaf  of the gruesome pictures, and Stone scanned them eagerly. Yet their  gruesomeness lay largely in the idea that the subject of them was not a living  person,&#8212;for in appearance they were by no means unpleasant to look at. The face  of Miss Carrington was serene and smiling, her wide-open eyes, though staring,  were filled with a life-like wonder, not at all an expression of fright or terror.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; volunteered Hardy, &#8220;she was sitting  here, admiring herself, and happily smiling, when the villain sneaked up behind  her and gave her that crack over the head.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But she was already dead when she was hit on  the head.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So the doctors think, but I believe they&#8217;re  mistaken. Why, there&#8217;s no theory that would account for hitting a dead person!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And yet, that is what happened. No, Hardy, the  doctors are not mistaken about the hour of death, and about the poison in her  system and all that. But the most obvious and most important clue, for the  moment, is that black-jack. Just where was it found?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Right here, Mr. Stone, under the edge of this  couch. Hidden on purpose, of course.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, I think not. Dropped by the burglar,  rather, when he was startled by something unexpected. You see, he doubtless  stood here, where the powder is dusted about, and to drop the thing quickly, it  would fall or be flung just there where it was found.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, but what scared him, if he didn&#8217;t hear  anything?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Something that frightened him so terribly that  he fled without taking the jewels he had come for! Something that made him make  quick, straight tracks for the door and downstairs and out, by the way he had  entered.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good lord! Say, Mr. Stone, you think it was  that make-believe Count, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why make-believe?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, somehow, I feel sure he&#8217;s a fake. He&#8217;s not  the real thing,&#8212;or <i>I&#8217;m</i> greatly  mistaken!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let me see that glove found in her hand. Have  you it with you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Hardy had brought some of the exhibits held by  the police, and, taking the glove from his bag, he handed it to Fleming Stone.</p>
  <p>Stone looked at the glove hastily, but, raising  it to his nose, smelled of it very carefully.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, returning it, &#8220;no, the Count is  not the man who wielded the black-jack. I&#8217;m fairly certain of that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m blessed if I can see how you know by  smelling! By the way, Mr. Stone, I suppose you heard all about the conversation  that Miss Frayne related as taking place in this room after one o&#8217;clock that  night?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve read the full account of it. What do  you think about it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, I think it was the Count, talking to Miss  Carrington before he killed her. He has a very low voice, and speaks almost  inaudibly always. Then, you see, he is down in her will for ten thousand  dollars of those bonds, and he&#8217;s very fond of pearls,&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? Who said he was fond of pearls?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, maybe you didn&#8217;t hear about that. Why, Miss  Frayne remembered afterward, that another sentence she heard Miss Carrington  say was, &#8216;I know how very fond you are of pearls.&#8217; She forgot that speech in  her evidence, but found it afterward in the written account she had of what she  overheard at the door. And his Countship is fond of pearls. He talked a lot  about those the lady wore that last evening. He says himself pearls are a hobby  with him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So you really think the Count was in this room  that night?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Surely I do. It&#8217;s no insult to the lady&#8217;s  memory to say so. She had a right to receive him in her boudoir if she chose to  do so. It&#8217;s no secret that she was trying to annex him, and he was not entirely  unwilling. You see,&#8212;the way I dope it out,&#8212;she had him up here to show off her stunning  jewels, and so tempt him on to a declaration that she couldn&#8217;t seem to work him  up to otherwise. You know she said, &#8216;To-morrow these may all be yours, if you  will only&#8212;&#8217; or some words to that effect. What could all that mean, except as I&#8217;ve  indicated? And she said, &#8216;You are the game I&#8217;m after,&#8217;&#8212;those weren&#8217;t the words,  I know, but it meant that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;However, I can&#8217;t think the Count struck that  awful blow that fractured her skull. Villain he may be, even a murderous one,  but that black-jack business, to my mind, points to a lower type of brain, a  more thick-skinned criminal.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone spoke musingly, looking about the room as  he talked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Could it be,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;that she was talking  to herself? or, say, to a picture,&#8212;a photograph of somebody? I don&#8217;t see any  photographs about.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Both men looked around, but there were no  portraits to be seen.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Funny,&#8221; said Hardy: &#8220;most women have photographs  of their family or relatives all over the place. Not even one of Miss Stuart or  of her nephew, Loria.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, nor any of absent friends or school-mates.&#8221;  Stone looked over all the silver paraphernalia of the dressing-table and other  tables for even a small framed photograph that might have escaped notice, but  found none. On the walls hung only gilt-framed water colors or photographs of  famous bits of art or architecture in dark wood frames. Many of these were of old  world masterpieces, Italian cathedrals or Egyptian temples. Others were a  well-known Madonna, a Venus of Milo, and one at which Hardy exclaimed, &#8220;She&#8217;s a  sure enough peach! Who&#8217;s she?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Cleopatra, starting on her Nile trip,&#8221;  said Stone, smiling at Hardy&#8217;s evident admiration.</p>
  <p>&#8220;&#8216;Tis, eh? Then Loria brought it to her. He&#8217;s  daffy over anything Egyptian. And he&#8217;s mighty generous. The house is full of  the stuff he brings or sends over; and it&#8217;s his money, Mr. Stone, that pays  your damages. Miss Stuart, now, she&#8217;s none too free-handed, they say.&#8221;</p>
  <p>But Fleming Stone paid little heed to this  gossip. He was studying the photographs of the dead lady as being of far more  interest than pictures on the boudoir walls.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that maid?&#8221; he said suddenly; &#8220;the one  who brought the breakfast tray&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in the sanatorium,&#8221; returned Hardy; &#8220;we  told you that, Mr. Stone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I know. But where? Can I see her?  Now, at once!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose so. It&#8217;s right near here. A  small private affair, only a few patients. They needn&#8217;t really have sent her,  but she carried on so, Miss Stuart wouldn&#8217;t have her about any longer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come, let us go there.&#8221; As he spoke, Fleming  Stone left the room, and without waiting for the hurrying Hardy, ran  downstairs, and was in the hall, getting into his great coat when the other joined  him.</p>
  <p>So great was Hardy&#8217;s faith in his superior, and  so anxious was he to watch his methods, that he donned his own overcoat without  a word, and the two set forth.</p>
  <p>It was only a short walk, and on the way, Stone  looked about in every direction, asking innumerable questions about the  neighboring houses and their occupants.</p>
  <p>After passing several large and handsome  estates, they came to a district of less elaborate homes, and after that to a  section of decidedly poorer residences. At one of these, Stone stared hard, but  not till they were well past it, did he inquire who lived there.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Dunno,&#8221; replied Hardy; &#8220;it&#8217;s a sort of  boarding-house, I think, for the lower classes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; said Stone, and they went on.</p>
  <p>At the sanatorium they found Estelle. She was not  hysterical now, but was in a sort of apathetic mood, and listless of manner.</p>
  <p>Stone spoke to her with polite address, and a  manner distinctly reassuring.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It will be much better for you, Estelle,&#8221; he  said, pleasantly, &#8220;if you will speak the truth. Better for you, and better for&#8212;you  know whom.&#8221;</p>
  <p>His significant tone roused her, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know  who you mean,&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you do! somebody whose name begins  with H, or B, or S.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know any one beginning with S,&#8221; and  Estelle frowned defiantly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But some one with&#8212;&#8221; Stone leaned forward, and  in the tense pause that followed, Estelle&#8217;s lips half formed a silent &#8216;B&#8217;.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; went on Stone, as if he had not paused. &#8220;If  you will tell the whole truth, it will be better for Bates in the long run.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Estelle began to tremble. &#8220;What do you know?&#8221;  she cried out, and showed signs of hysteria.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I know a great deal,&#8221; said Stone, gravely, &#8220;and,  unless assisted by what you know, my knowledge will bring trouble to your  friend.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What do you want me to tell you?&#8221; and Estelle,  now on her guard, spoke slowly and clearly, but her fingers were nervously  twining themselves in and out of her crumpled handkerchief.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only your own individual part in the  proceedings. The rest we will learn from Bates himself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How do you know it was Bates?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We have learned much since you left Garden  Steps,&#8221; and now Stone spoke a little more sternly. Hardy looked at him in  wonder. Who was this Bates, clearly implicated in the murder, and known to  Estelle?</p>
  <p>&#8220;You see, Mr. Haviland saw you go down to open  the window for him to come in,&#8221; Stone went on, as casually as if he were  retailing innocent gossip. &#8220;Did you go down again and close it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t said I opened it yet,&#8221; and Estelle  flashed an irate glance at her questioner.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, but you will do so when you realize how  necessary it is. I tell you truly, when I say that only your honesty now can  save your friend Bates from the electric chair.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Estelle shuddered and began to cry violently.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That only makes matters worse,&#8221; said Stone  patiently. &#8220;Listen to me. This is your only chance to save Bates&#8217; life. If I go  to the police with what I know, they will convict him of the murder beyond all  doubt. If you tell me what I ask,&#8212;I think, I hope, between us, we can prove  that he did not do it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t he?&#8221; and Estelle looked up with hope  dawning in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&#8220;<i>I</i> think not. Now there&#8217;s no time to waste. Tell me what I ask or you will lose  your chance to do so. You opened the living-room window for Bates to come in,  at about three o&#8217;clock?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted the girl.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And went down and closed and fastened it at&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Five o&#8217;clock,&#8221; came in lowest tones.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not knowing that Miss Carrington was dead?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, <i>No!&#8221;</i></p>
  <p>&#8220;For Bates went there only to steal the jewels?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And so, when you took the breakfast tray, and found  the lady&#8212;as you did find her&#8212;you were frightened out of your wits, and dropped  the tray?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And so, to shield Bates, who you thought had  killed her, you lied right and left, even trying to incriminate Miss Stuart?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Have you seen Bates since?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And until now you have thought he killed your  mistress?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Another thing, Estelle; you put bromide in the  glass of milk in order that Miss Carrington might sleep soundly, and not hear  Bates come in?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t drink that milk!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But you fixed it, thinking she would?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all. Come on, Hardy.&#8221; and somewhat  unceremoniously, Stone took leave, and made for the nearest telephone station.</p>
  <p>After that, matters whizzed. Stone had called  the Police Headquarters and asked that an officer be sent with a warrant for  the arrest of Bates.</p>
  <p>&#8220;How do you know where he is?&#8221; asked Hardy,  nearly bursting with curiosity.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure, but at least I know where to  start looking for him,&#8221; Stone replied, as the two went back the way they had  come.</p>
  <p>Stone stopped at the boarding-house he had  noticed on the way to the sanatorium, and rang the bell.</p>
  <p>Sure enough, Bates lived there and Bates was at  home.</p>
  <p>At Stone&#8217;s first questions he broke down and  confessed to the assault with the black-jack.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t kill her!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;she was  already dead! Oh, my God! can I ever forget those terrible, staring eyes! The  saints forgive me! I was half crazy. There she was, dead, and yet smiling and  happy looking! Oh, sir, what does it all mean?&#8221;</p>

    Bates, The Burglar</b></h2>
  <p>Brought before the magistrate, Bates told a  coherent though amazing story.</p>
  <p>It seems he was Estelle&#8217;s lover, and had long  ago persuaded her to let him know when Miss Carrington had a quantity of  jewelry in the house, that he might essay a robbery. The plan was simple.  Estelle had promised to slip downstairs at three o&#8217;clock and raise a window for  his entrance, and later, but before any one else was about, she was to slip  down and lock it again. In the meantime, they assumed, the burglary would be quietly  accomplished, their supposition being that Miss Carrington would be asleep in  her bedroom, and the boudoir easy of access.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You entered by the window, then, at what time?&#8221;  asked Stone, who was doing most of the questioning.</p>
  <p>&#8220;At quarter of four in the morning,&#8221; replied  Bates, and all noted that this was shortly before the hour when Mrs.  Frothingham saw through her field-glass a man leaving by the same window.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You went directly up the stairs?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes; Estelle had often told me the lay of the  rooms, and I went straight to the lady&#8217;s boodore.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You carried with you a &#8216;black-jack.&#8217; Did you  have murder in your heart?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That I did not! I took that, thinkin&#8217; if the  lady woke up and screamed, I&#8217;d just give her a tap that would put her to sleep  without hurtin&#8217; her at all, at all. I&#8217;m no murderer, Sir, and I&#8217;m confessin&#8217; my  attempt at burglary, and&#8212;and assault, so I won&#8217;t be accused of a greater crime.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Bates, it&#8217;ll be better for you to  be perfectly truthful. Now, what did you see when you entered the room?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I had stepped inside and shut the door before I  saw anything, and then, I turned to see the lady&#8217;s face, but in the mirror. I  was behind her, and in the glass I saw her smilin&#8217; face, and of course, I  thought she was alive, and that she saw me. I knew she&#8217;d scream in a minute,  and the sight of all the jewels gleamin&#8217; on her neck drove me fair crazy with greed,  I suppose, and I up with my sandbag, and hit her head, not meanin&#8217; to hit hard  enough to kill her, but only to knock her unconscious-like.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The blow smashed the big comb she was wearin&#8217;  but she didn&#8217;t move nor fall over. She was leanin&#8217; back in her big chair, and  she jest sat there, and kept on smilin&#8217;. My knees shook like the ague, for I  thought it was magic, or that my eyes was deceivin&#8217; me. There was no sound  anywhere, and I stood starin&#8217; at that smilin&#8217; face and she starin&#8217; back at me!  I nearly screamed out myself! But I bucked up, and thinkin&#8217; that she was struck  unconscious so quick, her face didn&#8217;t change, I made to take off some of the  jewels I was after. I touched her neck and it was cold! The lady was dead! Had  been dead some time, I was sure, &#8216;cause she was so cold and stiff. I trembled  all over, but my only thought then was to get out. Not for a million dollars  would I touch them sparklers! There ain&#8217;t often a burglar who is ghoul enough  to rob a corpse! Leastways, <i>I&#8217;m</i> not.  I wouldn&#8217;t. I wouldn&#8217;t! I&#8217;m a tough and a bad egg generally, but I wouldn&#8217;t steal  from no corpse! Not I!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So you left the house at once?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That I did, as fast as my tremblin&#8217; legs could  get me downstairs. I was clean daft. I couldn&#8217;t make it out and I didn&#8217;t try. I  thought it was the Devil&#8217;s own work, somehow, but how, I didn&#8217;t know. My mind  was full, makin&#8217; my escape. I ran like the old boy was after me, and reachin&#8217;  home, I hid under me bedclothes and groaned all night. Full a week went by, and  I begun to breathe easy, thinkin&#8217; I&#8217;d never be suspected of a hand in it, when  up comes this gentleman, and says I done it. Well, I&#8217;ve told the truth now, and  I&#8217;m relieved to get it off my chest.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Bates heaved a deep sigh, as of a man eased of a  great burden. His whole story bore the stamp of truth, and his manner of  telling was straightforward and earnest. Nor was there reason for doubt. Though  a startling tale, it entirely explained many of the strange conditions that had  seemed so bewildering. It would never have occurred to Bates nor to any one to  make up such a yarn, and what else could have deterred him from the  contemplated robbery but the superstition that makes even the most hardened  criminals refuse to steal from a dead person? Therefore, the narrative was  accepted as probably true, and Bates was taken to the Tombs to await further  proceedings against him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a wonder!&#8221; said Gray Haviland, as, that  same afternoon, he discussed the matter with Fleming Stone. &#8220;Would you mind  telling me how you went straight to the criminal and walked him off to jail?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That was practically a bit of luck,&#8221; and Stone  smiled. &#8220;It was the black-jack that gave me the clue. If the fellow hadn&#8217;t  dropped that in his fright, we might never have traced him. Though we would  perhaps have found him eventually, through the maid, Estelle. She is not good  at keeping things secret. However, he did drop the weapon, and it led straight  to him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But how?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, the thing smelled strongly of creosote.  Now, it was made from a bit of old cloth that looked like a piece of some  discarded garment,&#8212;a man&#8217;s coat, say. If the odor had been camphor or moth  balls, I should have assumed a garment laid away in storage, but creosote is  not used for that purpose. So I deduced a house recently remodeled by use of a  certain kind of shingles. I know that the odor of those shingles clings to everything  in the house for months. It is almost ineradicable. So I looked about for a  house lately reshingled.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why not a new house?&#8221; asked Hardy, who was  present.</p>
  <p>&#8220;A point well taken,&#8221; said Stone, nodding  approval, &#8220;but in a new house the odor often is dispelled before the people  move in. In a remodeled house, the furnishings stay there during the work and  so are deeply impregnated with that unmistakable smell of creosote. At any  rate, I worked on that, and when I found that a newly shingled old house was a boarding-house  of the type Bates would be likely to live in, I went there to see, and found  him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, but how did you know there was such a  person as Bates? Where did you get his name?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;From your cook,&#8221; returned Stone, simply. &#8220;I  concluded there was no doubt that Estelle had let the man in and relocked the  window afterward. So I deduced a friend of the girl&#8217;s so dear to her that she  would do this for him. I asked the cook, Mrs. Haskins, as to Estelle&#8217;s admirers  and learned that there were two, Bates and Higgins. Mrs. Haskins couldn&#8217;t say  which one Estelle more favored, so I decided to try both. Bates&#8212;the cook told me&#8212;lived  in a boarding-house near here, and Higgins over in New York. So when I asked  Estelle a few leading questions I pretended to greater knowledge than I really  had. I spoke of a name beginning with either B, H, or S. She fell into the trap  and said quickly that she knew no one initialed S. Then I said, &#8216;but beginning  with&#8212;&#8217; and waited; she said no name, but involuntarily her lips form a silent &#8216;B,&#8217;  and I knew she had Bates in mind. The rest was easy. Bates, the boarding-house  and the shingles formed a combination too indicative to be merely coincidence. And  so we found him. And I, for one, believe his story. I know the strong superstition  that imbues those people concerning a corpse, and the unexpected discovery that  he had attacked one was enough to make that man beside himself. Indeed, it&#8217;s a  wonder that he didn&#8217;t himself make an outcry in his terror and fright.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I have heard of your prowess in these matters,&#8221;  said Haviland, &#8220;but I didn&#8217;t look for such quick work as this. Why, you hadn&#8217;t  even interviewed Estelle when you came to your conclusions about Bates.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, but remember, I have seen a full account of  all the evidence, not only at the inquest, but all that has been gathered by  the police and by Mr. Hardy here. Last night I read all this carefully, and it  was enlightening on these points that led up to to-day&#8217;s work. But, now, I don&#8217;t  mind telling you, Mr. Haviland, that a much more difficult and complicated  problem faces us, to discover who gave to Miss Carrington the poison that  killed her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Have you any suspicions?&#8221; and Gray looked the  Detective straight in the eyes.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I have not, as yet,&#8221; and Fleming Stone returned  the steady gaze. &#8220;Have you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Gray Haviland hesitated. Then he said: &#8220;I would  rather not answer that question, Mr. Stone. If I should have suspicions, and  they should be unjust or ill-founded, is it not better to leave them  unmentioned, even to you? You are here to discover the criminal. I can not  think my suspicions, if I have any, could help you, but they might easily  hinder you by wrong suggestion.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very well, Mr. Haviland, just as you please.  But I assume you will tell me frankly anything you may know or learn in the way  of direct evidence bearing on the matter?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That, certainly.&#8221; But though Haviland&#8217;s words  were a definite promise, his tone and manner seemed hesitant, and a trifle  vague.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Am I to have the privilege of working with you,  Mr. Stone?&#8221; inquired Hardy, his heart beating tumultuously lest he receive a  negative answer.</p>
  <p>&#8220;If you care to. And if you are willing to work  in my way. I am somewhat impatient of interference or questioning. But, if you  want to assist in investigating, under my absolute orders, I shall be glad to  have you do so.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Nothing was further from Hardy&#8217;s mind than to  interfere or to show any undue curiosity concerning the work or methods of the  great Detective. He was more than content to watch silently, to run errands,  and to make himself useful in any way desired by his superior. He said this, and  Stone nodded indulgently.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I shall begin with this matter of the arrest of  Count Charlier,&#8221; said Stone, as he looked over his note-book. &#8220;Either that man  is the guilty party or he is not. If not, he must be released. If so, it must  be proven. What do you know of his history, Mr. Haviland?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very little, Mr. Stone. In the first place, I  doubt his right to the title he assumes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You do? And why?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Haviland looked a little embarrassed. &#8220;I&#8217;m not  sure I know why. But he doesn&#8217;t act like a real Count.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes? And how do real Counts act, I mean in ways  that differ from this man&#8217;s habits?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re having fun with me, Mr. Stone,&#8221; and Gray  blushed like a school-boy. &#8220;But I mean it. It&#8217;s this way. I&#8217;m not a Count, but  if I wanted to pretend I was, I&#8217;d act just as Count Charlier does. There!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good! That&#8217;s definite, at least. Now make it a  little more so by describing some of these actions.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; and Haviland&#8217;s brow wrinkled, &#8220;well, to  begin with, his manners are too slick and polished.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A traditional trait of Frenchmen.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, if real. But his seem artificially,  purposely,&#8212;oh, <i>fakely</i> polished! Have  you seen him, Mr. Stone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, not yet.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;When you do, you&#8217;ll see what I mean. He has  shifty eyes, and he rubs his hands together, and if he&#8217;s standing, he half bows  with every sentence he utters, and he smirks instead of smiling, and his whole  attitude is a fifty-fifty of apology and bumptiousness.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Bravo! You&#8217;ve given a graphic picture of him at  all events. I&#8217;ll reserve further consideration of his personality until I have  seen him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You believe implicitly all that story of Bates,  do you, Mr. Stone?&#8221; and Haviland looked dubiously at the Detective.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, I do, at present. If anything turns up to  disprove any part of it I may have to revise my ideas. But just now, it seems  to me that Bates told the simple truth. To be sure, he only told it because he  feared an accusation of murder, and he knew that to confess to the lesser crime  would go far to help him deny the greater.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You may be right. But might there not be  collusion between Friend Count and Bates?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Collusion?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just that,&#8221; and Gray shook his head doggedly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve  a vague idea that Frenchy is mixed up in this thing somehow. Now, he couldn&#8217;t  possibly have administered the poison, himself, personally, nor could he have struck  the blow personally, but couldn&#8217;t he have hired the man Bates to do it for him?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;On the face of things, Mr. Haviland, does that  look plausible? Is the Count, as you describe him, a man who would engage a  burglar of the Bates type to commit a brutal crime? Again, if Bates were merely  the Count&#8217;s tool, would he not, when caught, pass the blame on to his employer?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He sure would! You are right, Mr. Stone, those  two never hooked up together! It&#8217;s out of the question. But as Estelle and  Bates are in cahoots, why didn&#8217;t she give Miss Carrington the poison, herself?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, she did fix the bromide, hoping to make  her mistress sleep soundly. But the lady never took it. Now, if the maid had  given or expected to give the poison, why the bromide at all?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But, look here,&#8221; broke in Hardy, &#8220;mightn&#8217;t it  be that Estelle did do the poisoning and arranged the bromide as a blind, to  put us off the track, exactly as it has done?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s small use speculating about that  poison,&#8221; said Stone thoughtfully, &#8220;we must go at that systematically. We must  find out where it was bought and by whom. People can&#8217;t go round buying deadly  poison without a record being made of the sale. We must inquire of druggists, until  we find out these facts.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no druggist about here who would sell  aconitine,&#8221; said Hardy, &#8220;it doubtless was bought in New York.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That, of course, adds to the difficulty of  tracing the sale, but it must be done. Mr. Hardy, I will ask you to do all you  can to find out about that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You want to look up a French apothecary,&#8221;  advised Haviland. &#8220;That Count is at the bottom of this, as sure as shootin&#8217;,  and he&#8217;s full clever enough to hide his tracks mighty closely. Why, that man is  a fortune-hunter and an adventurer, and he wanted that ten thousand dollars,  and he poisoned Miss Lucy to get it! That&#8217;s what he did! And he was on deck  that night, after the jewels, that&#8217;s where he was! It was he in that room  talking, it was he who left his glove there,&#8212;of course, he didn&#8217;t know it,&#8212;and  now you&#8217;ve got him under lock and key, I hope you&#8217;ll keep him there, and not  let this Bates discovery get him the slip. If the two were not working  together, then, surely they are incriminated separately, and you want to look  into the case of little old Mr. Count!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You may be right, Mr. Haviland,&#8221; and Fleming  Stone smiled at him, &#8220;but I think you are assuming a lot because of your  prejudice against the Frenchman. Was he very attentive to Miss Carrington? Had  he proposed marriage to her?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That we don&#8217;t know. Of course, we had all been  afraid he would&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why afraid?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, we didn&#8217;t want my cousin to marry an  adventurer. Of course, he only wanted her fortune, and as her business manager,  I had a right to interfere, or at least, to look after her interests enough to  prevent that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But was she not a capable woman, who could be  supposed to know her own mind?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ordinarily, yes. But, there&#8217;s no use mincing  matters. Miss Carrington greatly desired to marry. However, she paid no  attention to men whom she did not consider interesting. There were several such,  and she sent them packing. The Count, though, she took to at once, partly  because of his title and partly because,&#8212;well, he has a way with him. He  flattered her, and she took the bait like a hungry fish!&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades14">Chapter 14</a><br>
    Who Gave The Poison?</b></h2>
  <p>Though Fleming Stone&#8217;s acumen and quick  perception had led to a swift apprehension of Bates, his next steps were not  taken so rapidly. He spent much time in the boudoir of Miss Carrington, as if  striving to make the walls tell what their traditional ears had heard.</p>
  <p>The upset breakfast tray had been removed, but  nothing else disturbed. Estelle had owned up, after Bates&#8217; arrest, that she did  drop the tray, in her fright at the sight of the dead lady, and that she  afterward denied it lest she be suspected of wrong-doing.</p>
  <p>The plate that had contained sandwiches was  still on the bedside table, but the glass of milk, with bromide in, had been  carried away.</p>
  <p>Stone looked at the empty plate, and wondered.  Had the poison been placed in the sandwiches? By Estelle? By anybody else? Who  had had opportunity? Estelle had brought the sandwiches and milk to the  bedroom, according to her usual custom, when she prepared the bed for the  night. A tiny serviette had been over the sandwiches, and was still there  beside the plate. Stone looked at it. A mere wisp of fine linen, with a  monogrammed corner. The few wrinkles in it showed clearly to Stone&#8217;s sharp eyes  the dainty touch of fingers that had held the caviare sandwich. It undoubtedly  denoted that Miss Carrington had eaten the sandwich. Had any one merely removed  it, the napkin would have been uncreased. He had been told that she rarely ate  this night luncheon, though it was always placed for her. Why had she partaken  of it on that particular night? Had some one advised her to? Or urged it? Had  the Count really visited her in the boudoir, and having previously arranged the  poisoned sandwich, made sure that it would perform its deadly mission? Could he  have entered the room unknown to the rest of the household?</p>
  <p>Stone went to the window. Yes, that matter was  easy enough. A balcony outside the long French window was connected with the  lower verandah by a spiral staircase. Any one could run up the steps and be  admitted to the boudoir in perfect secrecy. Stone wondered for a moment why  Bates hadn&#8217;t entered that way, and quickly realized that for a marauder to  appear at the window would have frightened Miss Carrington and caused an  outcry. The entrance of the Count, however, whether expected or not, would be easily  effected.</p>
  <p>If the Count were really guilty, the  circumstances were all explicable. Suppose Miss Carrington had made the  appointment. Would she not, in her vanity, have donned the beautiful boudoir  gown and the jewels to appear attractive in his eyes? And, supposing she had  playfully caught his glove as he removed it, and had half-unconsciously  continued to hold it. Then the conversation alleged to have been overheard by  Miss Frayne would have been addressed to him, and the remarks would be, at  least, intelligible.</p>
  <p>The snake? Ah, yes, the snake. As to that there  was no hint, no clue of any sort. But then, the thing was so inexplicable, that  the explanation <i>must </i>be easy. A clue  so strange, so bizarre, must lead somewhere. That could be left to the future.  Now, he must decide on his first steps.</p>
  <p>The decision took him to call on Doctor Stanton,  and the physician welcomed him warmly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Glad to see you, Mr. Stone,&#8221; he said; &#8220;sit  down, sir, sit down. I&#8217;ve been wanting a talk with you ever since I heard of  your arrival. So you&#8217;ve ferreted out the burglar already! Great work, great  work indeed! And now for the real murderer. You see, sir, I&#8217;m up to the minute  in my information regarding this case.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Glad to know it,&#8221; returned Stone. &#8220;Now, Doctor  Stanton, I hope you can help me. I don&#8217;t mind admitting the thing has its  baffling aspects. The burglar was easily traced, and easily disposed of. The  real work, as you say, is just beginning. Will you, sir, tell me all you know  of the poison that killed Miss Carrington?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Surely, Mr. Stone. The autopsy showed a fatal  dose of aconitine. Aconite, as you of course know, is the herb, wolfsbane, of  the Hellebore tribe, all the species of which are poisonous. Aconitine is an  intensely poisonous alkaloid obtained from aconite. Taken in a moderate  quantity, it acts as a powerful sedative, but the dose absorbed by Miss  Carrington was undoubtedly fatal within half or three-quarters of an hour.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And she died at what time?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;About two o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Proving she took the poison at about quarter or  half after one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes; thereabouts. It is not possible to fix  these hours precisely, but the poison was administered positively between one  and two.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Administered? You do not think then, that she  took it herself?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Most certainly not! Miss Carrington has been in  my care, professionally, for many years. I knew her very well, and I know  nobody more opposed to medicine in any form or drugs of any sort. It was a most  difficult task to persuade her to take even the simplest remedy, and then she  had to be assured over and over again that it was harmless. No, Mr. Stone,  nothing could have made her take that dose of her own accord, nor could any one  have persuaded her to take it, consciously. It was, without doubt, given to her  secretly, by the clever ruse of the murderer. Of course it could not have been an  accident. The marvelous part is, to my mind, how any one secured the poison. It  is not an easy matter to buy aconitine.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then that ought to make it easier to trace. If  the public could easily procure it at will, there would be greater difficulty  in running down the purchaser.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That is so; and yet, I think your search will  be a hard one. How shall you go about it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;By canvassing the drug shops of the city, and  of the small towns as well.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It may be you can trace the sale. But if it was  bought under promise of secrecy, and if that secrecy were well paid for&#8212;?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;True, there is the difficulty. But what&#8217;s a  detective for if not to find out secrets?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Quite right. May your quest succeed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And now, a little more about the action of this  poison. What are the immediate effects of a fatal dose?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In a few moments there occurs a tingling  numbness of lip and tongue and pharynx. The numbness increases and affects all  the muscles and death ensues inside of an hour. This paralyzing effect renders  it impossible for the victim to cry out, and there are no convulsions. The body  remains calm and undisturbed, and the eyes open. A dilatation of the pupil  takes place, but the expression on the face remains as in life. This is why Miss  Carrington continued to look happy and smiling&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And proves that when she took the poison she  was happy and smiling, and therefore in no way terrorized or frightened into  it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Exactly so. And that indicates that she didn&#8217;t  know she was taking it,&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Or, that it was administered by some one she  knew and loved and had all confidence in.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It would seem so,&#8221; and Doctor Stanton&#8217;s fine  old face showed a sad apprehension.</p>
  <p>&#8220;How was it taken,&#8212;in what medium?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That we can&#8217;t tell to a certainty. There were  traces of the sandwiches discovered at the autopsy, but, though the poison  could have been given her, concealed in a sandwich filling, it is improbable.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because the white granules or powder, which are  soluble in water, would be more easily discerned in solid food.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But, on the other hand, it could be  unostentatiously placed in a sandwich, with little fear of detection; but to  prevail on her to swallow a solution,&#8212;it is bitter, is it not?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, slightly so. I admit, I cannot imagine any  one inducing Miss Carrington to swallow such a draught. Therefore, it may well  be, it was placed in a sandwich. The filling, they tell me, was caviare, which  would disguise the bitterness.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And does not all this, if true, point to some  one exceedingly familiar with all the details of Miss Carrington&#8217;s affairs?  Some one who knew of her nightly sandwich? And, also, does it not imply the  presence of some one who could and did insure her consumption of that sandwich?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It would indeed seem so, Mr. Stone; but when it  comes to discussing such a question as that, I must ask to be allowed to retire  from the field. It is my duty to tell all I know, from my medical experience,  but further than that I am not obliged to express any opinions or voice any suspicions.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You know, however, that Count Charlier is held  pending investigation?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, I know it. I have no opinion to express.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone rather admired this gentleman of  the old school, whose courtesy was evident, but equally so his determination to  say only what justice demanded of his profession.</p>
  <p>And then, like a flash, the reason came to him.  Doctor Stanton suspected, or at least feared to suspect some member of the  Carrington household.</p>
  <p>Of course, this was not a new idea to Fleming  Stone. He had mentally gone over the possibility of every one in the family and  all of the servants at Garden Steps, but so far he had held his mind open for  impressions rather than to formulate theories himself.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then, to sum up, doctor,&#8221; he said, as he rose  to go, &#8220;you assure me that you consider it out of the question that Miss Carrington  took the aconitine herself, say, as a headache cure, or something, intending  only a small curative dose?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Absolutely impossible, sir,&#8221; exclaimed the old  gentleman, almost angrily; &#8220;to begin with, Miss Carrington never had headaches,  and if she had she would have borne any amount of suffering from them before  she would have touched a drug or a medicinal remedy of any sort. And, aside from  all that, how could she get aconitine? It is not to be bought for the asking at  any druggist&#8217;s! No, sir, my conscience makes me insist on that point, Miss  Carrington never took that poison knowingly,&#8212;either by accident or design. It  was given to her, without her knowledge, by a very, very clever villain.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Again, then, could it have been given her  innocently, by mistake? I mean, if some one, her maid, or any friend, had  wanted to give her a sedative, and meant only a light dose, but by error in  quantity&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, sir! Not a chance! The amount given was too  great to be an error. And every one in that house knows better than ever to  have attempted to give medicine in any form or degree or for any purpose to  Miss Lucy Carrington.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It was crime, then,&#8221; said Fleming Stone, &#8220;black  crime. And as such, it must be discovered and punished.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Doctor Stanton, but he spoke with  deep sadness and as one who feared where or toward whom such discoveries might  lead.</p>
  <p>From the doctor&#8217;s house Stone went to see the  Count.</p>
  <p>That elegant gentleman was highly irate at being  detained against his will in such plain quarters as The Tombs furnished, but he  was not as belligerent or vindictive as Stone expected to find him.</p>
  <p>Hasty work on the part of the detectives from  the District Attorney&#8217;s office had resulted in his imprisonment, but the later  development of Bates&#8217; share in the matter made it extremely probable that the  Count might soon be released from custody.</p>
  <p>Pleasantly enough the two men conversed, and  Count Charlier gave the impression of one glad of help from an outside source.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It is such absurdity,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;to think I  would in any way wish harm to the lady. Why, I admired her above all, and it  was my hope that she would do me the honor to accept my hand.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Honestly, Count Charlier?&#8221; and Stone looked at  him with a man-to-man glance that caused the Count to hesitate in his protestations.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, I was considering the matter in my own  mind. You know, Mr. Stone, it is a great responsibility, this seeking a wife.  And Miss Carrington was not&#8212;not in her first youth. Of a fact, her years  outnumbered my own. So, I asked myself was it wise, was it altogether just to  the lady to&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never mind all that, Count,&#8221; said Stone, a  little impatiently, &#8220;just give me a few details of that evening, so far as your  actions were concerned. You were at the house till midnight?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Illsley and I left together. We had  spent the evening there at cards and music.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You had had any private conversation with Miss  Carrington during the evening?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, we walked alone in the conservatory for a  time,&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You proposed marriage?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not exactly that,&#8212;but I may have hinted at such  an event.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And the lady seemed agreeable?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Entirely so. If I may say it, she met my  advances half-way, and I could not misunderstand her feeling toward my unworthy  self.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She spoke to you of money matters? Of her will?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, to my surprise, she told me she had  bequeathed to me ten thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Was not this a strange bequest to a casual  acquaintance?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, we were more than casual acquaintances. I  have known Miss Carrington for two or three months.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Which? two or three?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps nearer two,&#8221; and the Count showed a  slight embarrassment.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do your friends often leave you large sums of  money on such short acquaintance?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It has never happened before,&#8221; and now the  Count&#8217;s dignity was touched and he spoke shortly and coolly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then, of course, it struck you as peculiar,&#8221;  and Stone&#8217;s smile assumed an acquiescence.</p>
  <p>But the Count returned: &#8220;Not at all. Miss  Carrington was an unusual woman, and I never expected her behavior to be  entirely conventional. When she told me of this I was simply and honestly  grateful, as I should have been to any one who showed me such a kindness.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You were glad to get the money, then?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, indeed!&#8221; the Count exclaimed, with  sparkling eyes, then realizing his slip, he hastily added: &#8220;that is, I was glad  of the knowledge that it would come to me some day. Surely I did not want the  lady to die, that I might receive it, but I was pleased to know she thought  enough of me to make the direction.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What did she mean by saying &#8216;To-morrow all will  be different&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That I do not know. Could she have meant&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She did say it, then? You admit she said it to  you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Breathlessly, Fleming Stone waited the answer.  Miss Carrington had said this to the person who was with her behind her closed  door at one o&#8217;clock! Could the Count be going to incriminate himself?</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not to me only. She said it to all who were  present. It was while we were playing bridge.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She said it again to the man who killed her!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of that I know nothing,&#8221; said Count Charlier,  politely.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Bother!&#8221; said Fleming Stone, inaudibly.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades15">Chapter 15</a><br>
    Pauline&#8217;s Purchase</b></h2>
  <p>Alone, Fleming Stone wrestled with the problem  of the giving of that poison.</p>
  <p>The library at Garden Steps had been turned over  to him for a study and no one entered the room unless summoned. Stone sat at  the mahogany table-desk, but his eyes rested unseeingly on the beautiful  fittings of polished silver and glass. On a memorandum block he wrote down the  names of possible and probable suspects. To be sure, he thought, every one in the  house might be deemed possible, as well as some who were not in the house. But  each one must be taken into consideration.</p>
  <p>To begin with the most important, Miss Stuart.  It was possible that she poisoned her aunt, but so improbable as to make it  exceedingly unlikely. True, she was heir to half the fortune, but well-bred,  well-nurtured young women do not commit crime to inherit their money sooner.  Except for that conversation reported by Anita Frayne, there was not a shred of  evidence against Miss Stuart. And Stone did not place implicit confidence in  that story of the talk behind closed doors. He had discovered that the two  girls were not friendly and he knew Anita capable of making up or coloring a  tale to suit herself. Pauline had told him that she was in the hall-window-seat  at one o&#8217;clock that night and had seen Anita coming from Miss Carrington&#8217;s  room. Or, to put it more carefully, she had seen her with her hand on the  door-knob, in the act of closing the door after her. This Pauline had told to  Stone, with an air of such verity and truthfulness that he was fain to believe  her. However, in all honesty, he had to admit to himself, that Miss Stuart <i>could</i> have given the poison in some  secret way, had she so desired. The same was true, though, of Miss Frayne, of  Haviland and of the various house-servants. But where could any of them get it?</p>
  <p>Again there were the Count and Mrs. Frothingham  to be considered. In fact, there were too many suspects to decide among,  without further evidence.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Any luck?&#8221; Stone asked of Hardy, who came in to  report.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, Mr. Stone. I&#8217;ve raked the drug shops  thoroughly, and there&#8217;s no trace of a sale of aconitine. It&#8217;s practically  impossible to buy such a substance. I mean, for the ordinary customer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yet somebody did.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I suppose so. But doesn&#8217;t it limit the field of  search to realize that it couldn&#8217;t have been a servant or either of the young  ladies?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why neither of the young ladies?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But how could they get it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why not as well as any one else? And somebody  did.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then somebody stole it. Nobody bought it. I&#8217;m  positive of that, now I&#8217;ve learned how impossible it is to make such a  purchase. And how could those girls steal it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Hardy, but my point is, why  couldn&#8217;t they steal it if anybody could? You&#8217;re denying their ability to steal  the poison, because you don&#8217;t want to suspect them. And neither do I, but we  must look this thing squarely in the face. Somebody managed to get that  aconitine and administer it to Miss Carrington secretly, and it is for us to  find out who did it,&#8212;<i>who could</i> do it,  in the face of almost insuperable obstacles. But it is futile to say this one  or that one could or couldn&#8217;t do it. Now, since you&#8217;ve found no trace of the  poison sale, let&#8217;s start from some other point. Surely, this case, with its  unique circumstances, offers many ways to look for evidence. What strikes me  most forcibly is the costume of the lady. Not so much the gown,&#8212;I believe she  was fond of elaborate boudoir robes,&#8212;but the array of jewelry, the glittering  scarf and the snake. Most of all, the snake. That, of itself, ought to point directly  to the true solution, and I believe it does, only we&#8217;re too blind to see it. I&#8217;m  going to work on that snake clue, and to help, I wish you&#8217;d go at once to all  the possible shops where it might have been bought. It may not be traceable and  then, again, it may. And, the strange fact of her sitting idly before the  mirror when she died! Whoever gave her the poison was there on the spot, must  have been,&#8212;for it&#8217;s sure enough that she didn&#8217;t take it herself, according to  the doctor&#8217;s statements. Well, if the murderer was right there with her, and  she not only made no outcry but continued to look smiling and happy, it was surely  some one she knew and in whom she had all confidence. Perhaps this person urged  her to eat the sandwich,&#8212;oh, pshaw, that&#8217;s all plausible enough,&#8212;but, the  snake! That&#8217;s the bizarre clue that must lead somewhere. And it shall! I&#8217;ll  ferret out the mystery of that paper snake or my name&#8217;s not Stone! Go to it,  Hardy! Rake the Japanese shops and department stores, but find out who bought  it. It isn&#8217;t old. I observed it was fresh and new. Those flimsy paper things  show handling mighty quickly. Find out who bought the thing, and we&#8217;ve a start  in the right direction.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Hardy went off on his errand and Stone went over  to have a talk with Mrs. Frothingham.</p>
  <p>The widow was amiable but non-committal. She was  highly incensed at the arrest of the Count, but felt confident he would be  liberated in a few days. She replied warily to Stone&#8217;s questions, but admitted  her presence in the house on the fatal evening.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she said, in a confidential way, &#8220;I  was lonely. The Count had gone so often of late to Garden Steps, and I was  never invited, that I think I was a little jealous.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of Miss Carrington?&#8221; asked Stone, quickly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Frothingham, frankly; &#8220;and of  Miss Stuart, and of the Count&#8217;s intimacy over there. I had never even been in  the house. So I went over there and looked in the windows. I saw them playing  cards and later strolling about the rooms. The great door stood a little ajar  and I cautiously stepped inside. It was vulgarly curious, but it was no crime. As  I stood in the hall I saw some one approaching, and stepped up a few steps of  the staircase. It was all so beautiful that I looked at the tapestries and  decorations. I remember thinking that if any one challenged me, I should tell  the truth, and say that I came in to look, as a neighbor ought to have a right  to do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never mind the ethics of the case, Mrs.  Frothingham, stick to facts. Did you go upstairs?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, indeed, only up four or five steps, just to  the turn of the staircase.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But Mr. Illsley saw you coming down.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only those few steps. He couldn&#8217;t have seen me  coming from the top of the stair, for I didn&#8217;t go up so far.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You spoke of being jealous of Miss Stuart. Why?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because Count Charlier is in love with her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;With Miss Stuart?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes; he was making up to Miss Carrington for  her money, but he is really in love with Miss Stuart.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Frothingham shook her head doggedly, as if  determined to tell this, even though it should redound to the Count&#8217;s  discredit. And it did.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Fleming Stone, &#8220;that adds motive to  the theory of the Count&#8217;s guilt. If he is in love with Miss Stuart, might he  not have been tempted to put Miss Carrington out of the way, that Miss Stuart  should inherit the fortune, and be the bride of his choice?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Indeed, yes, that is a possibility,&#8221; and  Fleming Stone saw at last, that this woman either suspected the Count&#8217;s guilt  or wished to make it appear so.</p>
  <p>Again, the sudden thought struck him, suppose  she was so jealous of the Count&#8217;s attentions to Miss Carrington, that she went  to Garden Steps with the intent of killing the lady. Suppose she did go  upstairs, although she denied it, and put the poison in the sandwich. Surely,  she had opportunity. Surely, she would now deny it.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone sighed. He hated a case where the  principal witnesses were women. One never could tell when they were lying. A  man, now, was much more transparent and his evidence more easily weighed.</p>
  <p>However, if this woman desired to turn suspicion  toward Count Charlier, it was either because she suspected him, or was  implicated herself. In either case, her word was not worth much, and Stone soon  took his leave to hunt a more promising field.</p>
  <p>Returning to Garden Steps, he found that Pauline  had received a letter from her cousin in Egypt.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; she said, as she handed Stone the  letter to read, &#8220;that my cousin Carr will think we are not accomplishing much.  Read the letter, Mr. Stone, and if you say so, I will ask Mr. Loria to come  home.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Glad to read the letter from this half heir to  the Carrington fortune, Stone took the sheet. It ran:</p>
  <p>Dear Polly:</p>
  <p>The awful shock of Aunt Lucy&#8217;s death leaves me  without words to tell you what I feel for you in your dark hours. What <i>can</i> I say in the face of such a horror?  I wish I were there with you to help you bear it all. For on you comes the  brunt of the publicity and all the harrowing details that must be attended to.  If you say so, I will return to America at once. But unless I can be of definite  assistance or real comfort to you, personally, I would rather not go over just  now. I&#8217;m just starting on a wonderful piece of work here. No less than excavating&#8212;but  I won&#8217;t take time to tell of it now. I&#8217;ll write you about it later, if I don&#8217;t  go to you. This is a short note to catch the mail, and reach you as soon as  possible. Remember, as I write, I have only your first two cables, and know  nothing of details. I eagerly await your letters. Why don&#8217;t you follow out your  plan of coming over here in February? Leave all business matters in Haviland&#8217;s  hands, and get away from the scene of the tragedy. Of course, as I cabled Gray,  get the best possible detective experts on the case. Spare no expense, and  charge all to me. Surely, we want to find and punish the slayer of Aunt Lucy,  and I repeat, if you, for any reason, want me to, I will come over at once.  Cable, and I will take the next steamer. If you don&#8217;t do this, do write me long  letters and tell me everything that is happening. Poor Aunt Lucy. I know your  life with her wasn&#8217;t all a bed of roses, but I know how saddened you are now,  and my heart goes out to you. Dear Polly, command me in any way. I am entirely  at your service here or there. If you come over here, I advise Haviland to stay  there and look after things. I know the bulk of Aunt Lucy&#8217;s fortune is divided  between you and me, and I want Gray to see to all matters connected with my  share. When he gets around to it, he can send me some money to further this  work I am engaged on here. But let me know if you want me to come to you. With  all loving sympathy and affection,</p>
  <p>Carr.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone pondered over this letter. He had  felt a certain curiosity concerning this absent cousin, who was heir to half  the great fortune, and so would have had a possible motive for a crime that  would secure his inheritance to him at once. But there was no possible way of  connecting a man in Egypt with a deed committed in the victim&#8217;s boudoir. Vague thoughts  of Loria&#8217;s employing somebody to do the deed for him formed themselves in Stone&#8217;s  mind, but were soon dismissed as untenable. The man Bates could not be a tool  of anybody, and beside, he didn&#8217;t kill the lady. The poison did that. The Count  couldn&#8217;t be a tool of any one. He was too evidently his own master, and whether  guilty or not, was entirely on his own initiative. Oh, the whole idea was  absurd. The letter itself was sufficient exoneration for Loria. He was absorbed  in his research work and though thoughtful enough of Pauline&#8217;s wishes, he was  apparently not anxious to have his plans over there interrupted. He wrote like  a good all round chap, and Fleming Stone could find no peg on which to hang a  suspicion in his case.</p>
  <p>&#8220;A good letter,&#8221; he commented, returning it to  Pauline; &#8220;what&#8217;s your cousin like?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In looks? A little like me, but bigger and  darker. He&#8217;s a fine-looking man, and a kind-hearted one. I shall advise him not  to come home, for I know how interested he is in his work, and he can do no  good here. Can he, Mr. Stone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Frankly, Miss Stuart, I don&#8217;t see how he can. I  may as well admit to you, the case seems to me a most baffling one. The assault  with the black-jack is, of course, accounted for, but we have made no progress  in the matter of discovering the poisoner. I feel that the solution of the mystery  is closely connected with that paper snake. Can you give me any idea where the  thing could have come from? Do you think Miss Carrington bought it herself?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I am sure she did not,&#8221; returned Pauline, but  her voice and intonation were such that Stone turned quickly to look at her.  She had gone pale, and her eyes looked frightened. &#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; she went on,  hurriedly, &#8220;Aunt Lucy would never buy such a thing. She hated snakes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I know that, but she must have gotten it  somewhere. It is easier to think she put it round her throat herself than to  think she let some one else do it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; and now Pauline looked  angry. &#8220;It is incredible that she should have put that thing round her own  neck! What could have induced her to do it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There seems to be no theory to fit the facts,&#8221;  said Stone, wearily, &#8220;so we must try to get some facts that may suggest a  theory. You think, Miss Stuart, that you saw Miss Frayne leaving Miss  Carrington&#8217;s room late that night?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I know I saw her with her hand on the  door-knob,&#8221; returned Pauline steadily, and just then Anita herself burst into  the room. &#8220;That is a falsehood!&#8221; she cried, and her big blue eyes flashed  angrily; &#8220;how could you see me, when you were yourself in Miss Carrington&#8217;s  room?&#8221;</p>
  <p>This was what Stone had wanted, to get these two  girls at variance; and he helped along by saying, &#8220;Were you, Miss Stuart?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; cried Pauline.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You were!&#8221; Anita flung back. &#8220;Miss Carrington  was talking to you! She said she wished her face was as beautiful as yours! To  whom else could she have said that? Surely not to the Count! One doesn&#8217;t call a  man beautiful. And we all know that Miss Carrington admired your looks and lamented  her own lack of beauty.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All that applies equally well to yourself,&#8221; and  Pauline gazed steadily at the blonde beauty of Anita. &#8220;Why wasn&#8217;t all that  speech addressed to your own attractive face, and you repeat it to incriminate  me?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Here was an idea. Stone wondered if it could be  that Anita was in the boudoir and to turn suspicion from herself tried to pretend  she had heard Pauline in there.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And she said you were fond of pearls!&#8221; went on  Pauline. &#8220;Your admiration for my aunt&#8217;s pearls is an open secret!&#8221;</p>
  <p>It was. Often had Anita said how much she  preferred the soft lustre of pearls to the dazzling sparkle of other gems.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And she left you ten thousand dollars in her  will,&#8221; continued Pauline, more as if thinking these things over aloud than as  if accusing Anita of crime.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wait, Miss Stuart,&#8221; cried Stone; &#8220;what are you  doing? Implying that Miss Frayne had anything to do with the tragedy?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I am implying nothing. I am trying to see how  far the accusations she makes against me will fit her own case. You remember  she said my aunt proposed to leave my share of the fortune to some one else,  but Carr&#8217;s share must remain untouched. Well, to whom else could she think of  giving my share, but to this scheming girl who tried her best to get my  portion, but did not succeed?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Anita struggled to reply, but words would not  come. So furious that she could not articulate, she gurgled hysterically, when  into the room came Haviland and Hardy. Both looked exceedingly grave, and Gray  went at once to Pauline and put his hand kindly on her shoulder. Then he  suddenly caught sight of Anita and her evident distress, and leaving Pauline he  went over to the other and put his arms gently round her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What is it, Anita?&#8221; he said. &#8220;What has upset  you so?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Pauline!&#8221; was all Anita could say, when she was  interrupted by Hardy.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let me speak first,&#8221; he said, for he saw there  was dissension between the two girls. &#8220;I have made a discovery. At Mr. Stone&#8217;s  directions I have been investigating shops where the paper snake might have  been bought, and I have learned that one was bought at Vantine&#8217;s recently by  Miss Stuart.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Fleming Stone gravely, &#8220;did you buy  one, Miss Stuart?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline hesitated. She was white as chalk, and  her lips quivered.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of course she did!&#8221; screamed Anita, greatly  excited; &#8220;she did, and she was in there talking to Miss Carrington, just as I  said! And she put that thing round her neck to frighten her! And then she gave  her the poison, and then she came away and left her to die! All alone by  herself! The fiend!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There, there, Anita, hush,&#8221; and Haviland tried  to soothe the frantic exclamation of the girl.</p>
  <p>Pauline stood waiting, in silence. At last she  said, &#8220;When you remove that ranting woman, I will answer your question, Mr.  Stone.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll answer it now!&#8221; cried Anita. &#8220;In my  presence, and at once.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I think you must answer, Miss Stuart,&#8221; said  Stone, gently. &#8220;Did you buy a paper snake?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; said Pauline, and added in a low tone, &#8220;A  long time ago,&#8212;this can&#8217;t be the same one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The date of the sale is about a week before the  death of Miss Carrington,&#8221; went on Hardy, merciless in his statements.</p>
  <p>&#8220;For what purpose did you purchase it?&#8221; asked  Stone, a little sternly.</p>
  <p>Pauline now drew herself up, proudly. &#8220;I bought  it,&#8221; she said, in clear, distinct tones, &#8220;because my aunt instructed me to get  it for her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>There was a silence; and then, &#8220;Oh, come now,  Pauline, you can&#8217;t expect us to swallow that!&#8221; Gray Haviland said, with a  tolerant smile at her. &#8220;Try again.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the truth,&#8221; said Pauline, but her voice  trembled, and with a half-stifled exclamation of despair, she ran out of the  room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Stop, Pauline, where are you going?&#8221; cried Haviland  as he ran after her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch me!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to cable  Carr to come home! He&#8217;s the only one who can help me! You&#8217;re so wrapped up in  Anita that you can&#8217;t tell truth from falsehood. Carr will know what to do,&#8212;and  I shall send for him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wait, Miss Stuart,&#8221; said Fleming Stone,  gravely; &#8220;you may cable Mr. Loria, if you choose, but for a few moments I must  claim your attention. It is, to my mind, of the greatest importance to learn  the details of the purchase of that paper snake, and I must ask you to tell us  the circumstances of your aunt&#8217;s request for it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There is little to tell,&#8221; said Pauline, in a  hesitant way. &#8220;It was one day when I was going over to New York that Aunt Lucy  just said, casually, to get her one of those Japanese paper snakes from Vantine&#8217;s,  and I did.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough!&#8221; cried Anita. &#8220;Miss Carrington <i>never</i> sent for a snake! <i>never</i> in the world! You&#8217;ll be saying  next she told you to get her some aconite to poison herself with!&#8221;</p>

    The Two Girls</b></h2>
  <p>&#8220;Miss Stuart,&#8221; and Fleming Stone&#8217;s voice, though  gentle, had a ring of decision, &#8220;if I am to go on with this case, I must insist  on your entire confidence, and absolute,&#8212;&#8221; he hesitated over the word, &#8220;truthfulness.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The two were alone. After the altercation  between Pauline and Anita, Stone had requested the others to leave them, and he  determined to get at the truth of this marvelous statement about the purchase  of the snake.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I understand, and you are quite right,&#8221;  murmured Pauline, her manner quiet, her tone even, but in the dark eyes raised  to his Fleming Stone saw fear,&#8212;definite, unmistakable fear.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then explain, for I am sure you can, why you  suppressed the fact of your own purchase of that paper snake until forced to  admit it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I was afraid.&#8221; The beautiful face was of a  creamy pallor and the scarlet lips quivered. But this evident agitation on Miss  Stuart&#8217;s part did not deter Stone from his probing queries.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why were you afraid? Afraid of what?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Afraid that if you knew I bought the snake you  would think I was in some way connected with&#8212;with the crime&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you see that to attempt to conceal  the fact of your purchase makes any such suspicion more imminent?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You <i>don&#8217;t</i> think I would&#8212;would&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to <i>think</i> anything about it, Miss Stuart. I want to <i>know</i>, and I want you to tell me all  about your aunt&#8217;s strange request for you to buy a thing she so feared and  abhorred.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it myself. But Aunt Lucy was  full of vagaries and would often ask me to buy strange or outlandish things for  her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But not of a <i>reptilian</i> nature?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, she had never done such a thing before.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Did she give no reason for the request? Make no  apology or explanation?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No. I was just leaving her, when she called me  back, and said, &#8216;Won&#8217;t you stop in at some Japanese shop, and get me a paper  snake?&#8217; and I exclaimed in surprise at the request. Then she lost her temper  and said she supposed she knew what she wanted and for me to get it without further  to-do. So I did.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And when you brought it to her?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She merely took it and laid it in a desk  drawer, without even unwrapping the parcel. I never saw it again till I saw it  round her neck.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And you do not think she placed it there  herself?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I am sure she did not. The only reason I can  ascribe for her wanting it, is that she might have thought her dread of them a  foolish whim and determined to accustom herself to the sight of them by means  of the harmless toy. That&#8217;s all I know about that snake, Mr. Stone. But the truth,  as I have told it to you, is so strange, so almost unbelievable, that I knew it  would only serve to attract suspicion to me, so I denied it. You know Miss  Frayne is only waiting to pounce on it as complete evidence of my guilt.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You and she are not good friends?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We have never been really friendly, though  always polite on the surface of things. But she is jealous of me, and tried in  every possible way to undermine my aunt&#8217;s faith and trust in me, and even  plotted to have me disinherited and my fortune bequeathed to herself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;An ambitious plan!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She is ambitious. She intends to marry Mr.  Haviland, and she intended to have my half of the Carrington money.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suspect her of the crime!&#8221; and  Fleming Stone looked up quickly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Suspect is too strong a word. But to me there  seems room for grave inquiries. I was in the hall at the time she declares I  was in my aunt&#8217;s room,&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wait a moment, Miss Stuart, isn&#8217;t this a sort  of deadlock? You say you were in the hall, Miss Frayne says you were in the  boudoir. Why should I believe one in preference to the other?&#8221;</p>
  <p>There was infinite sadness in Pauline&#8217;s eyes as  she looked at her questioner. &#8220;That is so,&#8221; she said, slowly; &#8220;why should you?  I have only my unsupported word. Nor has Anita any witness. But, Mr. Stone, I  thought a Detective always looked first of all for the motive. What reason  could I have for&#8212;for killing my aunt?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You put it plainly, Miss Stuart, and I will  reply in an equally straightforward vein. The first thing we detectives think  of is, who will benefit by the crime? Naturally, money benefit is first thought  of. The greatest money benefit comes to you and your cousin in Egypt. The  nature of the crime makes it impossible that he could have committed it. There is,  however, a possibility of your own connection with it, so we must question you.  But there are others who benefit in a pecuniary way by the death of Miss  Carrington, so they too must be questioned. You surely see the justice and the  necessity of all this investigation?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, yes, and it seems to me also justice that  you investigate the story of Miss Frayne. She, too, has only her own  unsupported word as to that conversation she relates. May she not have made it  all up?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She has a witness, Miss Stuart, a credible  witness. Mr. Haviland has told me that he saw Miss Frayne at the door of the  boudoir at about quarter past one.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Gray saw her! He didn&#8217;t tell me this. Mr.  Stone, I hate to speak ill of another woman, but Miss Frayne can really wind  Gray Haviland round her finger, and I have no doubt she has persuaded him to  give this evidence, whether&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Whether it is true or not?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, that is what I meant, though I hated to  say it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss Stuart, it is often hard to tell when a  man speaks the truth, but I have no reason to disbelieve Mr. Haviland&#8217;s  statement. He told quite circumstantially of being up and down all night. He  was restless and wandered about in several rooms during the small hours. You  know he told of seeing the maid on the stairs. And he gives me the impression  of a truthful witness who would not lie outright, even at the behest of a woman  in whom he is interested.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then they are going to suspect me?&#8221; Pauline&#8217;s  voice was so full of despair that Fleming Stone caught his breath as he looked  at her. Her great eyes were wide with fear, her hands were clenched and her whole  body tense with horrified suspense.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Give me some good reasons why you can not be  suspected,&#8221; he cried, eagerly leaning forward in his chair. &#8220;Give me some proof  that you were in the hall at that moment, or that you were in your own room, or&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That proves, Mr. Stone, that you <i>do</i> suspect me! Your assumption that I could  have been in my own room shows that you do not believe I was in the hall,&#8212;as I  was.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t Miss Frayne see you there?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How do you know she didn&#8217;t? Why do you accept  her words as truth, yet disbelieve mine?&#8221; Pauline had risen now and stood  before him. Her tall slimness, her wonderful grace and her beautiful, angry  countenance made an alluring picture. &#8220;I was not in favor of your taking this  case, Mr. Stone, and I am even less so, now, that you refuse to believe what I  say! I shall cable at once for my cousin to return. I do not wish Gray Haviland  and Anita Frayne to arrange all this to suit themselves. I am mistress here, in  Mr. Loria&#8217;s absence, and if my authority is doubted I want him here to stand up  for me!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just a moment, Miss Stuart. You are not  entirely just to me. It is necessary for me to question you, but you must see  that your innocence&#8212;of which I have no doubt&#8212;will be more easily established by  a policy of frankness on your part, than by futile anger toward Miss Frayne or  Mr. Haviland. The incident of the paper snake, as explained by you, is not  necessarily incriminating, and if you will wait a few days before calling your  cousin home, I think very likely you will prefer not to do so. I understand  that you do not wish him to come home, unless he can be of assistance to you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, that is his desire, to stay over there  unless I want him. But, Mr. Stone,&#8221; and now the lovely face was almost smiling,  &#8220;if you mean what you said, that <i>you</i> do not doubt my innocence, then I will not send for Mr. Loria. I am content to  let it all rest in your hands.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The girl&#8217;s beauty now was dazzling. Color showed  in her cheeks, her eyes shone, and the curve of her exquisite red lips was almost  a smile. Stone looked at her in amazement. He had spoken truly, he had not  doubted her innocence, but this sudden elation on her part puzzled him. What  did it mean? Only, as she meant it to seem, that if he believed in her  innocence it could be easily proved? Well, he would accept that diagnosis of  her attitude, but he would move warily. This case was unlike any other he had ever  engaged in, so he must attack it in a different way. And first of all, he must  decide which of these two women was speaking the truth. Yet, how could he  decide? If Pauline had been in that room when Anita listened at the door, she  would, of course, try to prove that she was elsewhere. But, in such a case, why  not say she was in her own room? It wasn&#8217;t plausible that she should confess to  being in the hall, if she were really in the boudoir. That, then, was in  Pauline&#8217;s favor. But the conversation detailed by Anita? That must be further  analyzed.</p>
  <p>These thoughts flew through Stone&#8217;s quick-moving  brain as he stood looking at his beautiful hostess.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Puzzling it out, Mr. Stone?&#8221; and Pauline&#8217;s  smile was a full-fledged one now; &#8220;perhaps I can help you. If you&#8217;ll accept my  assistance without doubting my word, I&#8217;m sure we can do wonders in a detective  way.&#8221;</p>
  <p>This was not in Pauline&#8217;s favor. It was too much  like bargaining with him to believe her innocent. Then, too, though all  unconscious of it, Stone was influenced by the wonderful charm of the girl.  Though her lips were smiling a little, her great dark eyes still held that look  of fear, that hunger for protection, that desire for some one on whom to lean.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And I won&#8217;t send for my cousin just yet,&#8221; she  went on. &#8220;It&#8217;s too bad to call him home when he&#8217;s so busy over there. You know,  Mr. Stone, that Mr. Loria is a wonderful man. His achievements in excavation  have brought him fame and glory. And you mustn&#8217;t think he&#8217;s heartless because  he doesn&#8217;t return at once. You know it was all arranged for us to go over there  next month and he had made all sorts of plans for us and for himself. He can&#8217;t leave  his work at a moment&#8217;s notice, unless, as he says, I have need of him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Was he fond of his aunt?&#8221; inquired Stone,  casually.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He was her idol. To Aunt Lucy the sun rose and  set in Carr. She was perfectly crazy to go on this trip to Egypt, in order to  be with him. He was fond of her, yes. More so than I was, because she was  always kind and good-natured to him, while she was always unpleasant to me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why was she?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Well, I suppose I may as well  tell you, one reason was because she was always envious of any one whom she  considered better-looking than she was herself. This may sound strange to you,  Mr. Stone, but it was the key-note of my aunt&#8217;s existence. She adored beauty in  every way,&#8212;pictures, clothes, everything,&#8212;but she was so sensitive about her  own plainness, that a younger or prettier face made her, at times, irritable  and even cruel. She would never engage a servant with any pretensions to good  looks. Therefore, as she chose to consider Miss Frayne and myself of comely  personal appearance, she was unkind to us both.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And Mr. Loria? Is he not handsome?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, yes, very. But Aunt Lucy liked handsome  men. Carr Loria is like a picture. His father was of Italian descent, and Carr  has the clear olive skin and dark beauty of that race. Gray Haviland is  good-looking, too, but it was only feminine prettiness that stirred up Aunt  Lucy&#8217;s ire.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why did she ever engage such an angel-face as  Miss Frayne?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone watched closely for a sign of  irritation at this speech, and saw it. Pauline&#8217;s smile faded, and she said,  abruptly:</p>
  <p>&#8220;Do you think her so beautiful?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She has the perfect blonde fairness usually  typified by the celestial white-robed creatures on the old canvases.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, Anita <i>is</i> a perfect example of a blonde. Why, she is the daughter of an old school-mate  of my aunt&#8217;s, and so that&#8217;s why Aunt Lucy took her, and then she proved such an  efficient secretary and such a patient, meek thing to scold, that she kept her  position.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss Frayne doesn&#8217;t seem so extraordinarily  meek to me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, indeed! She&#8217;s not meek at all. But she  always was to Miss Carrington. That, of course, to keep the position, which was  both easy and lucrative. Easy, that is, except for my aunt&#8217;s temper. That was vented  on poor Anita, morning, noon and night.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That, then, might give us a motive for Miss  Frayne&#8217;s desire to be rid of her cruel mistress and to get the inheritance that  she knew would come to her at Miss Carrington&#8217;s death.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline shuddered. &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of such a  thing, Mr. Stone, but, if anybody in this house is to be suspected of the awful  thing, it can be no one but Anita. She tried, I know, to supplant me in my aunt&#8217;s  affection, and to have my inheritance, or part of it, transferred to herself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You know this?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes. For some time she has been making insinuations  and telling my aunt tales about me,&#8212;untrue ones,&#8212;that would make Aunt Lucy  angry at me. I tell you this, Mr. Stone, because I want you to know Anita  Frayne as she really is.&#8221;</p>
  <p>There was the ring of sincerity in the tone,  there was a look of truth in the big, dark eyes, and there was a most appealing  expression on the lovely face that gazed into his own, but Fleming Stone turned  from the speaker with a polite but decided gesture of dismissal, saying, &#8220;Please  ask Miss Frayne to come here a few moments.&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades17">Chapter 17</a><br>
    The Overheard Conversation</b></h2>
  <p>Awaiting the arrival of Anita Frayne, Stone  thought rapidly. Forming his judgments, as always, more by impressions than by  words, he found himself believing in Pauline Stuart. She had bought the paper  snake, she had lied about it, but many women would have done the same. Knowing  that the purchase of the toy meant definite suspicion, wouldn&#8217;t any innocent  girl have feared and dreaded that exposure? If she had been guilty, she would scarcely  have dared deny the facts of buying it, lest it be proved against her, and make  matters worse. Again, it was impossible to connect that magnificent woman with  crime! If she were connected with it, it could only be as the criminal herself.  There was no theory that admitted of her being an accomplice, or a tool. Stay,  there was that Loria man. Stone couldn&#8217;t rid himself of a vague idea of  implicating the distant nephew by means of an accomplice on the spot. But the  notion was not logical. If Pauline had killed her aunt under her cousin&#8217;s instructions,  she was just as much a murderer as if she had done it entirely of her own initiative.  And if the two cousins had conspired or worked in collusion, it was Stone&#8217;s  duty to fasten the deed on Pauline, as the available one of the pair. Stone ran  over in his mind the letter from Loria. It gave no hint of greed or cupidity in  his nature. He was engrossed in the pursuit of his hobby, archology, and was  only willing to leave his work if that would definitely please his cousin, on  whom, he fully appreciated, the responsibilities of the occasion would fall. He  fully trusted Gray Haviland to look after all business affairs, so he was not a  suspicious or over-careful nature. He asked no immediate money and only desired  some, in the course of time, to further his work. Whatever might be the truth,  there was no reason to cast a glance of suspicion toward Carrington Loria. His  opinion of Pauline&#8217;s possible guilt Stone held in abeyance, and Miss Frayne  entering, he greeted her with punctilious politeness and a confidential air,  tending to put her at ease.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss Frayne,&#8221; he began, &#8220;the situation is a  grave one. I am forced to the conclusion, tentatively at least, that Miss  Carrington was deliberately poisoned by some one in her own household. It may  have been a servant, but it is difficult to imagine how or why a servant could accomplish  the deed. At any rate, I must first consider the members of the family, and in  so doing, I must request absolute truth and sincerity from all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve no reason to equivocate, Mr.  Stone,&#8221; and Anita&#8217;s voice was almost flippant. &#8220;All I&#8217;ve told about what I  heard at Miss Carrington&#8217;s door is absolutely true, and I can repeat it word  for word.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It seems strange you have it so accurately at  your tongue&#8217;s end.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not at all. I went to my room and wrote it down  as soon as I heard it. I often make such memoranda. They are frequently useful  later.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone mused. This seemed a strange thing  to do, at least in view of the later events, but then, if Miss Frayne had been  the guilty one, and had made up all this story of overheard conversation,  surely she would not have done anything so peculiar as to make that detailed memorandum;  or if she did, would not have told of it.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I have, of course, a copy of that memorandum,&#8221;  continued Stone; &#8220;what I want is for you to tell me again why you think it  could not have been entirely a soliloquy on the part of Miss Carrington.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;For two reasons. First, I have lived with the  lady for four years, and never have I known her to talk to herself or soliloquize  aloud. Of course, this does not prove that she never did so, but I know it was  not her habit. Second, nobody in soliloquy ever would use that definite intonation  which is always used in speaking <i>to</i> a  person. You know yourself, Mr. Stone, that a soliloquy is voiced slowly,  mumblingly, and usually in disjointed or partially incoherent sentences. The  talk I heard was in clear concise speeches unmistakably addressed to somebody  present. She could not in a soliloquy use that direct form of address, even if talking  to some one in her imagination. She would not keep it up, but would go off in a  reverie or drop into impersonal thought. I wish I could make this more clear to  you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You do make it clear, Miss Frayne. I know just  what you mean. I quite agree that one could easily tell the difference between  a spoken soliloquy and remarks addressed to a hearer. But you heard no replies?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;None at all. But I hold that is not peculiar,  for while Miss Carrington&#8217;s voice was especially high and carrying, an  ordinarily low voice would not be audible through that closed door. You can  prove that by simple experiment.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; said Fleming Stone. &#8220;I have tried it,  and as you say, an ordinary voice in a low tone is not audible. But Miss  Carrington&#8217;s must have been raised unnecessarily, to allow of its being heard.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone watched Anita&#8217;s face as she listened to  this. But she only replied, with a shrug of indifference, &#8220;I can&#8217;t say as to  that. I heard every word clearly, that&#8217;s all I can tell.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Suppose she had been talking to a picture of  some one, say a photograph of Miss Stuart or of Mr. Loria, or of Count  Charlier, would her tone of voice then be explicable?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps. But she would have had to imagine  vividly the person there before her. And, again, Miss Carrington had no such  photographs in her rooms. All her family photographs are in this library, in  frames or cases. She was methodical in such matters. She has series of pictures  of Miss Stuart and of Mr. Loria from their childhood to now, but they are all  in order in the cases over there.&#8221; Anita made a slight motion of her hand  toward a mahogany cabinet. &#8220;No, Mr. Stone, whomever or whatever Miss Carrington  was talking to, it was not a photograph of any of her relatives or friends. As  you know, there was none discovered in her room, so what could she have done  with it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, Miss Frayne. But hasn&#8217;t the theory  of a living person in there also inexplicable points? If somebody was there, it  was, of course, some one well known and whose presence in the house was unquestionably  correct. But her remarks, as I read them from your notes, imply different auditors.  Granting for a moment that Miss Stuart was there, why would Miss Carrington  say, &#8216;Henri, Henri, you are the mark I aim at&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I admit that must have been a soliloquy, or an  apostrophe to the man she wanted to marry, though he was not present.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You have no thought, then, that Count Charlier  was present?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Certainly not! The idea is absurd. Miss Stuart  was in there with her aunt, and I&#8217;m sure it was some remark of Pauline&#8217;s, which  I, of course, did not hear, that made Miss Carrington speak of the Count as if  to him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How, then, do you account for the presence of  Count Charlier&#8217;s glove?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss Stuart put it there as a blind.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And how did Miss Stuart get it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Easily. The Count had been spending the evening  here. He may have left his glove by mistake,&#8212;or&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Or&#8212;?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Or Pauline may have abstracted it purposely  from his coat-pocket during the evening with a prearranged plan to do all just  as she did do.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss Frayne! you can&#8217;t mean to assert your  belief that Miss Stuart so far planned the crime as to intend to cast suspicion  on Count Charlier by means of that glove!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why not? If Pauline Stuart is responsible for  her aunt&#8217;s death, I assure you, Mr. Stone, she is quite clever enough to  prearrange all details, and to plan so adroitly that suspicion should fall on  some one else. Miss Stuart is far more crafty and deep than you can have any  idea of! I have known her for four years, and I can tell you she is far from  ingenuous!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Suppose we leave the question of Miss Stuart  out of the discussion, and continue our first line of thought. Had Miss  Carrington ever spoken to you of changing her will?&#8221;</p>
  <p>As was his frequent experience, Fleming Stone&#8217;s  quick question caught his witness unaware, and she stumbled a little in her  speech, as she replied: &#8220;N&#8212;no. Why should she?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only because her frequent quarrels with Miss  Stuart might have made her wish to leave less of her fortune to her niece. And  in the conversation you overheard, Miss Carrington touched on this subject.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, she did. But except for that reference,  spoken to her unknown companion, I have never heard anything of such an  intention on her part.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re fond of pearls, Miss Frayne?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, I know what you&#8217;re getting at now. That  speech Miss Lucy made about fondness for pearls. Of course, I am. Who isn&#8217;t? I  often told Miss Carrington that I admired her pearls far more than all her  diamonds or other glittering stones. But I wouldn&#8217;t commit a crime for all the  pearls in the world! And, if I had, why didn&#8217;t I steal the pearls?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Anita&#8217;s voice rang out triumphantly as she put  this question, but Fleming Stone said quietly: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t accused you of crime,  Miss Frayne, but since you ask that, let me remind you, that if the crime were  done with intent of robbery, the reason that the robbery was never accomplished  is the same that kept the man Bates from stealing. Few people can bring themselves  to take valuables from a dead body. However, I cannot think the poisoning was  done with any idea of direct robbery, but for the gain that would come by the  bequests of the will.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then your search is limited by the list of  inheritors?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It is, Miss Frayne.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then, Mr. Stone, how can you overlook or  undervalue the weight of evidence against Pauline Stuart? Remember, she bought  that snake herself. Miss Lucy never told her to buy it, <i>never</i> in this world! Pauline feared her aunt would disinherit her&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; the question was shot at  her, and Anita fairly jumped as she heard it.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why&#8212;why, you know I heard reference made to it  that night when&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;When you overheard that conversation; yes, go  on.&#8221; Fleming Stone had gained his point, which was to prove that Anita <i>did</i> know of the proposed change in the  will before that time, and to his own belief he had proved it.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, I cannot doubt now that Pauline knew her  aunt intended to change her will, and so she was so desperate at the idea of  losing her fortune, she&#8212;I cannot bear to put it in words&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She poisoned the lady,&#8221; said Fleming Stone,  very gravely.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Anita&#8217;s voice choked, but she enunciated  the word. &#8220;Mr. Stone, you must think me dreadful to hold these suspicions, but  you asked me to be frank&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And I wish you to be so. I am here, Miss  Frayne, to discover the poisoner of Miss Carrington. It is my duty to get all  possible light on the matter from any one I can. It is the duty of those whom I  question to tell all they know, truthfully and straightforwardly. If these  truths implicate or seem to implicate a member of the household, none the less must  the investigation be carried on and the case be pushed to its inevitable  conclusion. The great danger lies in mistaking opinions or imaginations for  facts. Now you are telling facts as to the words you overheard, but you are  giving only opinions as to whom those words were addressed.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That is so,&#8221; and Anita&#8217;s gaze was a wondering  one. &#8220;But, Mr. Stone, since the <i>fact</i> of that person in the room is undiscoverable, one can&#8217;t help forming an  opinion. Haven&#8217;t you one?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I have.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, what is it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I think those words were spoken to some  inanimate object, not to a person. Suppose the remark thought to be said to  Count Charlier was addressed to his glove, which she was undoubtedly holding at  the time.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I never thought of that, because I have assumed  that Pauline put that glove in her hand after&#8212;after it was all over, to  implicate the Count. And, any way, that&#8217;s only that one remark,&#8212;or two. To what  inanimate object was she talking when she said &#8216;To-morrow all these jewels may  be yours&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That I cannot answer. That whole conversation  is most mysterious.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Indeed it is, Mr. Stone, under any other  hypothesis than that of the presence of Pauline Stuart in her aunt&#8217;s room at  the time!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;May I come in?&#8221; and Gray Haviland&#8217;s  good-natured face appeared, as he knocked and opened the door almost  simultaneously.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Stone, &#8220;and I will ask you, Miss  Frayne, to leave us. I am getting to work in earnest now, and I want to push  things a little.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone watched the effect of this speech on Anita  and was not surprised to see her look at him with startled eyes, as she  unwillingly went through the door he held open for her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s doing?&#8221; asked Haviland, in his breezy  way; and Stone replied, frankly: &#8220;Lots. Those two girls are sworn foes, aren&#8217;t  they?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of late they have seemed to be. The break came  a month or more before Miss Carrington died. Two beauties never can remain  friends.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;They are both beautiful women,&#8221; agreed Stone. &#8220;Which  do you think had a hand in the tragedy?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good Lord! Neither of them! What are you talking  about? That Count man is responsible for the whole thing, Bates and all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I know you think so, Mr. Haviland, but I can&#8217;t  agree with you. Now, look here, we&#8217;ve got to face things squarely. Take the  story Miss Frayne tells, about that mysterious conversation. If it were all a  figment of her brain,&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What! Man, you&#8217;re crazy! Anita Frayne make that  all up out of the solid! Never, in a thousand years! If she said that talk was  talked, it <i>was</i> talked, and that&#8217;s all  there is about that! Why or by whom it was talked, is another matter, and as I  understand it, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re here to find out. And, between you and me and  the arc light, I don&#8217;t believe you ever will find out.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No! And this is no aspersion on your powers. I  believe that fool Count was in there, and as he&#8217;ll never admit it, and you&#8217;ll  never believe it, how can it be proved?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never mind that, now. Prepare yourself, Mr.  Haviland, for some unwelcome questions. You don&#8217;t want to, but I must insist on  your answering them. Which do you consider the more truthful and honest of the  two young women I&#8217;ve just been talking to?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nixie! You can&#8217;t get an answer to that question  out of me! Why, I&#8217;d be a cad to say anything but that they are both impeccably  truthful and honest.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So you would, in ordinary circumstances. But  you must realize, Mr. Haviland, that I&#8217;m here for the definite purpose of  solving the mystery of a terrible crime, and I can only do it by inquiry and  investigation. If you really refuse to help me I must learn what I want to know  in other ways.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But, hang it, man,&#8221; and Haviland, impressed by  Stone&#8217;s manner, considered the question; &#8220;I do think they&#8217;re both truthful,&#8212;that  is, one of them&#8212;Oh, I can&#8217;t say it! I can&#8217;t talk against a woman!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be obliged to tell all you know, sooner  or later. If you tell me now, I truly believe it will be better all round.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8212;now wait, I&#8217;ve got to think this  thing out; I believe,&#8212;why, blessed if I don&#8217;t believe either of them would lie  if she was in a tight place! There! you&#8217;ve made me say a nice, honorable thing,  haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; and Haviland looked utterly disgusted with Stone and with himself  too.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades18">Chapter 18</a><br>
    Fled!</b></h2>
  <p>The days went by, leaving the mystery unsolved.  Count Charlier was released from custody, there not being sufficient evidence  to hold him. Bates was in jail awaiting the action of the Grand Jury, but it  was recognized that he was not the murderer of Miss Carrington.</p>
  <p>Search for the poisoner had so far been  fruitless, and the newspapers were clamoring for the arrest of somebody. But  the Police Detectives were at their wits&#8217; end, and even Fleming Stone was  baffled.</p>
  <p>For hours, Stone sat thinking over the many  peculiar features of the case. It was not in embarrassment that he felt himself  unable as yet to trace the criminal, it was rather with a sensation of  curiosity that he wondered what point he had overlooked. There must be some  clue, some definite indication of what way to look, but so far he had not  perceived it.</p>
  <p>So interested was he in the search that he took  no note of the passing of time or the growing impatience of those who watched  him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this way, Hardy,&#8221; he would say to the  younger detective, &#8220;the mystery centres about that paper snake. When we find  out the reason for Miss Carrington&#8217;s sending for that thing, we&#8217;ve the whole story.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You believe, then, that she did send for it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of course; why not?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve only Miss Stuart&#8217;s word for that; and it  doesn&#8217;t seem as if Miss Carrington would&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nonsense! It doesn&#8217;t seem, you mean, as if Miss  Stuart would&#8212;Why, man, what possible sense <i>could</i> there be in Miss Stuart&#8217;s buying that snake on her own account? If she set out  to poison her aunt,&#8212;which she didn&#8217;t,&#8212;she could have managed it in a dozen ways  without lugging in that paper reptile. In fact, it never would have occurred to  her to do so. <i>Why</i> would she do it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In an attempt to frighten the lady to death?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rubbish! The first effect of such a fright  would be a fearful outcry on Miss Carrington&#8217;s part, and immediate discovery of  the plot. Moreover, if Miss Stuart bought that snake for any such purpose, she  would have bought it secretly; at some little, obscure shop, not at a  well-known emporium. No, sir, the snake is the key to the puzzle, but how? That  is the question. You see, the doctors are pretty sure that the thing was put round  the lady&#8217;s neck before she died. Therefore she was either unconscious at the  time, or,&#8212;she was willing.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never! Everybody says her fear of the things  would never let her have it put on her willingly.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I know they say so, but they may be mistaken. I&#8217;m  beginning to evolve a theory that will fit the facts, queer as they are. But my  theory needs a whole lot of other facts to back it up, and those facts I can&#8217;t  seem to find.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Does your theory implicate Miss Stuart?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It does not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I thought not.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You thought quite right. It does not implicate  Miss Stuart, because she is in no way responsible for her aunt&#8217;s death. But she  may have knowledge, or she may think she has, that is leading her to shield somebody  else.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Whom?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. She is rather a puzzling creature.  Is she&#8212;is she in love with that cousin of hers?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Haviland?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, the one in Egypt.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, Loria. I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure. You read his  letter to her, it wasn&#8217;t in any sense a love-letter.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, but it was evidently a letter written with  the idea of other people reading it, because of the circumstances. Of course,  he wouldn&#8217;t put any intimate talk in it. And it was typewritten, so I couldn&#8217;t  judge anything of the man from his chirography.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Does handwriting mean much to you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, indeed. It is a wonderful expression of  character. But I don&#8217;t suppose it would declare his adoration of a lady, unless  he put it in words also.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t connect Loria with the crime in any  way, do you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how I can, unless in collusion or  through the assistance of Miss Stuart. And I&#8217;m not ready to do that. I&#8217;m  working now on that conversation overheard by Miss Frayne.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You accept that whole, then?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, for the simple reason that she would not  have invented all that talk. Even if she were in the room herself, and the  remarks were addressed to her, she might be trying to lay the blame elsewhere;  to create that conversation out of her own brain is too preposterous. You see,  Hardy, these things must be weighed in the balance of probability. If Miss  Frayne had set out to invent a lot of stuff which she merely pretended to  overhear, she would have had two sides to the conversation. It is that unusual  effect of one voice only that gives her story the stamp of truth.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But there must have been another voice, even though  inaudible to her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the point. There may have been,&#8212;probably  was. But if the story was her own invention, she never would have thought of  representing that second voice as inaudible. Now, either she did hear Miss  Carrington say those things, or she didn&#8217;t. I believe she did, because if she hadn&#8217;t,  she must have invented the tale, and if she had invented it, it would have been  different. Likewise, Miss Stuart&#8217;s snake story. If it were not true that her  aunt asked her to buy that snake, Miss Stuart must have made up that yarn. And  if she had made it up, it would have been different. That&#8217;s always my test for  the truth of an amazing statement. If the teller were falsifying, would he tell  it that way? If so, then it is probably a lie: if not, then probably it is a  true bill. Now they say Miss Carrington had a high, shrill voice. Did you ever  hear it, Hardy?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No. I never knew the lady. But I&#8217;ve heard a  record of it on the phonograph, and it is high, and rather thin.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;On the phonograph? How does that happen?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Gray Haviland is a dabster at that sort of  thing, and he has people sing for him and make records frequently. And once I  heard that they had a record of the dead woman&#8217;s singing, and I asked to hear  it, merely out of curiosity or a general interest. And it contained some spoken  words too, and her speaking voice is high and shrill, just such as would carry through  a closed door. You can, of course, hear the record, if you care to.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I do care to. I&#8217;ll make a note of that. Now,  here&#8217;s another thing. Miss Stuart has declared that she obliterated a footprint  which was noticeable in that powder scattered by the dressing-table.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, I know it. And Haviland states that it was  he who wiped out that print! What do you make of that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That Haviland did do it, and Miss Stuart fibbed  about it to shield Haviland.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, so it&#8217;s Haviland you think Miss Pauline is  shielding?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I think it may be; at any rate, she suspects  some one dear to her and&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re &#8216;way off, Mr. Stone! If you&#8217;ll excuse my  saying so, Miss Stuart has pulled the wool over your eyes until you don&#8217;t know  where you&#8217;re at.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone gasped. Pulled wool over his eyes!  Over the eyes, the gimlet eyes, the all-seeing eyes of Fleming Stone! What  could the man mean? And this so-called wool pulled by a woman! What unheard-of absurdity!</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr. Hardy,&#8212;&#8221; he began.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I know. Nothing of the sort, and all  that. But it&#8217;s true, Mr. Stone. Miss Stuart is a siren from Sirenville. She can  make any man think black is white if she chooses. And she has been bullied and  cowed by that old aunt of hers for years, and for my part, I don&#8217;t blame her  for getting to the end of her rope. If she&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Stop! Mr. Hardy, I know you think you&#8217;re right,  but you are not! Do you hear, you are not! And I&#8217;ll prove it to you, and that  soon! I&#8217;ll ferret out this thing, and I&#8217;ll do it on this new theory of mine  whether you believe it or not!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Hardy looked at the man in amazement. He had  expected a different mode of procedure from this talented sleuth. He had looked  for a quiet, even icy, demeanor, and magical and instantaneous solution of all  mystery. And here was the great man, clearly baffled at the queerly tangled web  of evidence, and, moreover, caught in the toils of a woman whom Hardy fully believed  to be the criminal herself.</p>
  <p>But he only said quietly, &#8220;What way does your  theory point, Mr. Stone? I may be able to help you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t, Hardy, because you&#8217;re so determined  to find Miss Stuart guilty that you couldn&#8217;t see it as I do. You consider the  strange features of this case&#8212;and Lord knows they <i>are</i> strange!&#8212;separately, whereas they must be looked at as a whole.  The gown, the quantity of jewelry, the smiling face, the glove, the overheard  conversation,&#8212;all these points are to be considered as of one import,&#8212;as  leading to one conclusion. And you think of them as implicating&#8212;separately,  mind you&#8212;Miss Stuart, Miss Frayne, and the noble Count. Now, all those queer points  are not only connected, but identical in their significance. But never mind  that. Here&#8217;s the place to begin. Miss Carrington was poisoned. She didn&#8217;t  poison herself. Who did?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr. Stone, you have put it tersely. I entirely  agree that all we are seeking is the answer to that last question of yours.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I will yet give it to you,&#8221; and Fleming Stone  spoke solemnly rather than boastingly. &#8220;The poison, the aconitine, was taken by  Miss Carrington as she sat there at her own dressing-table. She took it  willingly, smilingly,&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, because she didn&#8217;t know she was taking it.  When she ate the sandwich&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;The poison wasn&#8217;t in the sandwich. She took  that poison in water. The tumbler and spoon that were used are even now on the  glass shelf in her bath-room.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You know this?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I know that in the glass that now stands there  a chemist has found a slight trace of aconite. I took the glass myself to be  tested, with that result. This is not a great discovery, it merely proves that  the poison was administered in water, not in a sandwich.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But it also means that it was given to her by  some one who could persuade her to take the solution, unquestioningly,&#8212;not  under compulsion.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It would seem so.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And that points to Miss Stuart.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not necessarily. Hardy, I refuse to discuss  these things with you if you avow everything to condemn her. Why does what I  have just told you point to Miss Stuart any more than any one else in the  house? Why not Miss Frayne? Or Haviland?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Pshaw! Nobody suspects Gray Haviland.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But why not? If you&#8217;re merely suspecting here  and there without definite reason, why not include him on your list? And here&#8217;s  another thing. Whoever mixed that poison in the glass of water, afterward  rinsed the glass and returned it to its place in the bath-room? This was either  done at the time, that is, before the lady died, or later on, after death had ensued.  In either case, it opens up a field of conjecture.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t with me,&#8221; said Hardy, bluntly. &#8220;There&#8217;s  no room for conjecture. It simply piles up the proof against Miss Stuart, and  all your skill and even your will can&#8217;t get her off.&#8221;</p>
  <p>A low moan was heard and a sound as of a falling  body. Stone sprang to the door, and flinging it open, disclosed Pauline lying  on the floor where she had just fallen. With a low exclamation, Stone picked  her up and carried her to a couch. In a moment she sat up and cried, &#8220;What do you  mean, Mr. Hardy? Do you think I killed Aunt Lucy?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There, there, Miss Stuart, don&#8217;t ask foolish  questions,&#8221; and Hardy, deeply embarrassed, stood at bay. It was one thing to  assert his suspicions to Fleming Stone, and quite another to have them  overheard by this beautiful and indignant girl.</p>
  <p>&#8220;How dare you!&#8221; Pauline went on. &#8220;I was at the  door and I heard all you said. No, I am not ashamed of listening, I&#8217;m glad I  did. Now I know what I have to fight against! And you, Mr. Stone, do you think  me a murderer?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline cringed not at all. She looked more like  an avenging goddess, as she confronted the two men, and her blazing eyes and  frowning face challenged their replies.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I do not, Miss Stuart,&#8221; said Stone, quietly,  but Pauline responded, &#8220;How do I know? If you did, you&#8217;d say you didn&#8217;t! I have  no friend, no one to stand up for me. I shall send for Carr. He will defend me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>With a disdainful glance round, she left the  room. The two men looked at one another.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Guilty,&#8221; said Hardy.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; said Stone, and then the two went their  different ways.</p>
  <p>Hardy&#8217;s way led to the Police Headquarters, and  his report there, which included Stone&#8217;s story of the tested glass, was heard  with interest.</p>
  <p>He demanded Miss Stuart&#8217;s immediate arrest,  claiming that only she could have persuaded her aunt to swallow the poisoned  draught.</p>
  <p>Inspector Brunt was not quite willing to order  arrest, but he set machinery at work which he hoped would bring decisive  results of some sort.</p>
  <p>It did.</p>
  <p>That same evening, Pauline went to Fleming  Stone. The two were alone. Standing before him, in all her somewhat tragic  beauty, Pauline asked: &#8220;You don&#8217;t think me guilty, Mr. Stone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>He looked deep in the great, dark eyes that  seemed to challenge his very soul, and after a moment&#8217;s steady glance, he  replied, &#8220;I know you are not, Miss Stuart.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Can you prove it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I hope to.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That means nothing. Are you sure you can?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone looked troubled. Never before in  his career had he been unable to declare his surety of success; but with those  compelling eyes upon him he couldn&#8217;t deny a present doubt.</p>
  <p>Shaking himself, as if to be freed from a spell,  he said, at last, &#8220;Miss Stuart, I am <i>not</i> sure. I am convinced of your innocence, but the only theory of guilt that I can  conceive of is so difficult, so almost impossible of proof, and so lacking in  plausibility, that it seems hopeless. If determination and desperate effort can  do it, you shall be exonerated. But there are many circumstances not in your  favor. These I shall overcome, eventually. But, to be honest, until I can get a  clue or a link of some sort to join my purely imaginative theory to some  tangible fact, I can do little. I am working day and night in my efforts to  find this connection I seek, but it may take a long time. Meanwhile&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Meanwhile, I may be arrested?&#8221; Pauline&#8217;s voice  was a mere whisper; her face was drawn and white with fear. To Stone she did  not look like a guilty woman, but like an innocent girl, frightened at thought  of unjust suspicion and terrorized by imagination of the unknown horrors that  might come to her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, help me!&#8221; she moaned, &#8220;Mr. Stone, can&#8217;t you  help me?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Pauline!&#8221; he exclaimed, taking her hands in  his; &#8220;Pauline! Go!&#8221; he cried, tensely: &#8220;I will save you, but until I do, keep  away from me! You unnerve me! I cannot think!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I understand!&#8221; and Pauline slowly drew her  hands from his. &#8220;I will keep away from you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone let her go. He closed the door after her,  locked it, and threw himself into a chair. What had he done? Full well he knew  what he had done. Hardy was right. He had fallen in love with Pauline Stuart!  He realized it, quietly, honestly, as he would have realized any incontrovertible  fact. His subconsciousness was that of a deep, still gladness; but, strangely  enough, his surface thought was that since he had fallen in love with her, so  undeniably, so irrevocably, she <i>must</i> be innocent.</p>
  <p>Then on the heels of this thought, came another,  equally logical: if he deemed her innocent, was it not only because he loved  her?</p>
  <p>It was only after an hour of deep thought that  Fleming Stone pulled himself together and realized with a conquering assurance,  that he could go on with the case, and do his duty. If, as he was confident, he  could prove his vague theory to be fact, then his love for Pauline would help him  to good work and triumphant conclusions. If, instead, his further investigations  showed his theory to be false, then he must push on, and if&#8212;it couldn&#8217;t be, but  if&#8212;well,&#8212;he could always drop the case. But,&#8212;and of this he was certain,&#8212;his  heart should not only be kept from interfering with the work of his head but it  should help and encourage such desperately clever work that success must come.</p>
  <p>Pauline did not appear at dinner that night, and  on inquiry, Stone was told she had gone over to New York for a day or two.</p>
  <p>This, then, was what she had meant when she  said, &#8220;I will keep away from you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The next day came District Attorney Matthews to  interview Miss Stuart. Her absence from home annoyed him and he asked for her  New York address. This no one knew, as she had not informed any of them where  she was staying in the city, and Mr. Matthews went off in a state of angry excitement.  But the household at Garden Steps was even more excited.</p>
  <p>For this was the first sign of a definite action  against Pauline. What it meant or how far it would go, no one could say.</p>
  <p>And then, that afternoon, came a letter from  Pauline herself. It had been mailed in New York that morning and contained the  surprising news that Pauline had sailed at noon that day for Alexandria.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Get her back!&#8221; roared Haviland, as he read the  letter. &#8220;Wireless the steamer and make her get picked up by some incoming ship!  Don&#8217;t think of expense! She musn&#8217;t run off like that! It&#8217;s equivalent to  confession of the crime!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; demanded Fleming Stone. &#8220;How dare you  say that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true!&#8221; cried Anita. &#8220;Why else would  Pauline run away? She knew she was on the verge of arrest and she fled to Carr  Loria. He will hide her from her pursuers.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;He can,&#8221; said Haviland, thoughtfully: &#8220;maybe it&#8217;s  as well she&#8217;s gone there. Of course, she did it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of course, she didn&#8217;t!&#8221; and Fleming Stone&#8217;s  voice trembled in its very intensity. &#8220;And I shall prove to a lot of  dunder-headed police that she didn&#8217;t, but it will make my work much harder if  you two insist on Miss Stuart&#8217;s guilt. Why do you want to railroad her into  conviction of a crime she never dreamed of?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then who did it?&#8221; demanded Anita. &#8220;To whom <i>was</i> Miss Lucy speaking when she said  those things I heard?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If you harp on that string much longer,&#8221; said  Stone, looking at her, &#8220;one might almost be justified in thinking she said them  to you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Anita, in a low, awed voice, and  looking straight at Fleming Stone, &#8220;no, she did not say them to me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And Stone knew she spoke the solemn truth.</p>
  <p>But she had not spoken the truth when she said  she saw Pauline Stuart coming from the boudoir of her aunt.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades19">Chapter 19</a><br>
    Letters From The Fugitive</b></h2>
  <p>Pauline&#8217;s flight was deemed by many a confession  of guilt. The District Attorney declared his intention of cabling a command to  hold her for examination at Alexandria. Or, he said, perhaps it would be better  to intercept her course at Gibraltar or Naples.</p>
  <p>The people at Garden Steps paid little attention  to these suggestions, so absorbed were they in planning for themselves.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Poor child,&#8221; said Haviland, &#8220;she ran away in  sheer panic. You don&#8217;t know Pauline as we do, Mr. Stone; she is brave in the  face of a present or material danger. When a gardener&#8217;s cottage burned, she was  a real heroine, and saved a tiny baby at risk of her own life. But always a vague  fear or an intangible dread throws her into a wild, irresponsible state, and  she loses her head utterly. Now, I may as well own up that I do think Polly  committed this deed. I think that she had stood Aunt Lucy as long as she  possibly could, and you&#8217;ve no idea what the poor child had to put up with. I  think that when Lady Lucy threatened to send Pauline away, homeless and  penniless, this panic of fear overcame her and she gave that poison, on an  impulse,&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But,&#8221; interrupted Stone, &#8220;that would imply her  having the poison in readiness. She couldn&#8217;t procure it at a moment&#8217;s notice.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Haviland, thoughtfully; &#8220;but,  even so, it&#8217;s my belief that that&#8217;s the way it all happened. How Pauline got  the stuff I&#8217;ve no idea, but there&#8217;s no other explanation that fits the facts.  Aunt Lucy&#8217;s aversion to drugs or medicines could have been overcome by few  people, but Pauline could have wheedled her into taking it by some misrepresentation  of its healing qualities or something like that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It must have been under some such  misapprehension that she took it,&#8221; said Stone. &#8220;For I&#8217;m convinced she took it  dissolved in a glass of water, and therefore, was conscious of the act, though  not of the nature of the dose. But couldn&#8217;t Miss Stuart have given it  innocently by mistake, as a headache powder, or&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss Carrington never had headaches,&#8221; returned  Anita, &#8220;and, any way, Pauline couldn&#8217;t make such a mistake. It isn&#8217;t as if Miss  Carrington had a medicine cabinet like other people, where drugs might get  mixed up. No, Mr. Stone, there was no mistake.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You think Miss Stuart administered the poison  purposely, to kill her aunt?&#8221;</p>
  <p>It would have been a brazen soul indeed, that  could have spoken falsely under the piercing gleam in Fleming Stone&#8217;s eyes  then.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I am forced to think that,&#8221; replied Anita,  quietly. &#8220;And you know I was present when Miss Carrington denounced Pauline and  told her to leave this house the next day. And I also heard Miss Carrington  when she said, later, that half her fortune should not go to a niece who  treated her as Pauline did&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Would she have used those words in speaking to  Miss Stuart?&#8221; asked Stone, pointedly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Surely she would. Why not?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never mind all that, &#8216;Nita,&#8221; said Haviland. &#8220;Polly&#8217;s  gone,&#8212;run away,&#8212;and it&#8217;s up to us to do all we can to help her. If her flight means  she&#8217;s guilty, never mind, we must stand up for her, and deny anything that  incriminates her. If she did poison Aunt Lucy, we don&#8217;t want her convicted of  it. She&#8217;ll go straight to Loria, and he&#8217;ll look out for her all right. But if  we find anybody&#8217;s going to head her off at Naples, or anywhere, we must warn  her and help her to thwart their plans.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Accessory after the fact&#8212;&#8221; began Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said Haviland. &#8220;You bet we&#8217;ll be  accessories after the fact, to help Polly out! Why, Mr. Stone, if she did this  thing, the best possible plan for her was to vamoose, just as she did do. Carr  Loria can hide her in Egypt, so nobody can find her, and after a while&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr. Haviland,&#8221; and Stone&#8217;s eyes gleamed, &#8220;I am  surprised at your attitude. How can you so easily take Miss Stuart&#8217;s guilt for  granted?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No other way out. Now, look here, Mr. Stone,  neither Miss Frayne nor I did this thing. We weren&#8217;t tied to Miss Carrington&#8217;s  apron strings. We could walk off and leave her if we chose. But Miss Stuart  couldn&#8217;t. Her life was a perfectly good hell on earth. I know all about it, a  lot more, even, than Miss Frayne does. I don&#8217;t quite say I don&#8217;t blame Polly,  but I do say I quite understand it. She is an impulsive creature. She&#8217;ll stand an  awful lot and then fly all to pieces at some little thing that sets her nerves  on edge. She&#8217;s clever as the Devil, and if she procured that aconite, long ago,  say, it was in anticipation of some time when she&#8212;well, when she just reached  the limit. And it happened to come that night. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wrong, Mr. Haviland, all wrong!&#8221; and Stone&#8217;s  face was positively triumphant. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found an additional hint, in what you&#8217;ve  just said, and I&#8217;m convinced I&#8217;m on the right track! One more question, Miss  Frayne, about that conversation you so luckily overheard.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Luckily?&#8221; said Anita, her great blue eyes  showing alarm in their startled gaze.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Surely! Most fortunate, to my mind. Indeed, it  may well be that that carefully exact memorandum of yours may be the means of  clearing Miss Stuart of all suspicion. Now, tell me this. You heard only Miss Carrington&#8217;s  voice, as if speaking to somebody. Did it sound as if she spoke always to the  same person, or to more than one at the different times?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, it did sound as if she spoke to different  persons, but it couldn&#8217;t have been so. Surely, if there had been more than one  I must have heard some other words than her own.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never mind your own surmises. You say, it  seemed as if she addressed more than one person. Why?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because she used a different intonation. At  times angry, at times loving. But this is only an impression, as I now look  back in memory. I haven&#8217;t thought about this point before.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nor need you think of it again. You have told  me all I want to know, and I assure you it will be of no use for you to mull  this over or give it another thought.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want you to think, Mr. Stone,&#8221; and  Anita began to cry, &#8220;that I want to suspect Pauline&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I am not considering your wishes in the matter,&#8221;  said Stone, coldly. &#8220;If you do not want to think Miss Stuart implicated in this  matter, your words and actions are unintelligible to me, but they are equally unimportant,  and I have neither time nor thoughts to waste on them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>With this somewhat scathing speech, Stone went  away, leaving the angry Anita to be comforted by Haviland.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What did he mean?&#8221; she cried, her cheeks pink  with anger, and her blue eyes shining through tears. &#8220;Gray, does he suspect me?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, Anita, of course not. But he&#8217;s on a trail.  Perhaps it wasn&#8217;t Polly after all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But it had to be! It was somebody in the house,  and it wasn&#8217;t you or me or any of the servants.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, you listen to me, girl. If they quiz you  any more about that talkfest you butted into, don&#8217;t you color the yarn to make  it seem against Polly. I won&#8217;t have it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How cross you are! But I never did, Gray. I  never made it seem to be evidence against Pauline.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You never did anything else!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you love me any more?&#8221; and the soft lips  quivered as an appealing glance was raised to his face. Her eyes, like  forget-me-nots in the rain, were so beautiful, Haviland clasped the lovely face  in both his hands, and said as he held it: &#8220;I won&#8217;t love you, &#8216;Nita, if you go  back on our Polly. I&#8217;m surprised at your attitude toward her just now, and I  warn you I won&#8217;t stand any more of it. I&#8217;m forced to think she did this thing,  but I intend to admit that to nobody but you and Stone. If he can find the real  criminal, and it isn&#8217;t Polly, I&#8217;ll bless him forever. But you know, as well as  I do, why he is clinging to that forlorn hope. It&#8217;s because he&#8217;s&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Of course, I know! Because he&#8217;s in love with  her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes; and it&#8217;s a remarkable thing for him to  fall head over heels in love at first sight, like that.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, of course, she is handsome,&#8221; and Anita&#8217;s  grudging admission was real praise.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You bet she is! And old Stone fell for her in a  minute! Now there&#8217;s the old adage of &#8216;Love will find a way,&#8217; and if Fleming  Stone has any magic ability, or whatever these wizard detectives claim, he&#8217;s  going to work it to the limit to prove Polly innocent. And I hope to goodness  he succeeds. Great Scott! I wouldn&#8217;t suspect the girl if there was a glimpse of  a gleam of any other way to look. But, you hear me, Anita! Don&#8217;t you say a word,  true or false, that will help on the case against Pauline Stuart! I won&#8217;t stand  for it! And don&#8217;t you say you saw her coming from that room, when you <i>know</i> you didn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
  <p>The postman came just then, and brought with him  two letters addressed in Pauline&#8217;s dashing hand.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, what do you know about that!&#8221; exclaimed  Gray, half glad and half scared at the sight. &#8220;One for me, and one for F. S.  Here, Anita, take Mr. Stone&#8217;s to him, while I eat up mine.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it! I want to see what&#8217;s in yours,  first,&#8221; and Anita stood by Gray&#8217;s side to look over his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&#8220;All right, then,&#8221; and they read together:</p>
  <p>Dear Gray:</p>
  <p>I couldn&#8217;t help it. You see, I was so frightened  at what you all said, that I didn&#8217;t know what to do. I came over to New York,  with a vague idea of asking Mr. Price to help me. I stayed with Ethel all  night, and somehow things seemed to look so black, I couldn&#8217;t think of anything  but to go to Carr. I went down to the steamer office to see about changing my  tickets for an earlier date, or something, and I found the <i>Catalonia</i> sailed to-day. I&#8217;m scratching this off to go back by the pilot.  I had about two hours to get ready, so I bought a trunk and some clothes, went  to the bank and got a letter of credit, and here I am. I don&#8217;t know yet whether  I&#8217;m glad or sorry to be here. But I know I could not stand it at Garden Steps  another minute, with you and Anita both against me! Mr. Stone doesn&#8217;t believe I  did it, but he is doubtful of being able to prove my innocence, so I&#8217;m going to  Carr, and you can address me in his care. He&#8217;s my nearest relative, and it&#8217;s  right for me to go there. I cabled him from New York to expect me, and to meet  me at Alexandria. I&#8217;d write more, but it&#8217;s most time for the pilot to go, and I  want to send a word to Mr. Stone. Of course, you will look after all my bills  and affairs till further notice.</p>
  <p>Pauline.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; said Gray, &#8220;Think of that poor  child going off like that, because she thought you and I were against her!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked Anita, an angry gleam  in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No! never!&#8221; shouted Gray. &#8220;If Pauline is guilty  a thousand times, I&#8217;m not against her! I&#8217;m <i>for</i> her, Anita, for her, first, last and all the time! Come on, now, let&#8217;s take Mr.  Stone his letter.&#8221;</p>
  <p>They found Stone in the boudoir, the room where  the ghastly crime had been committed. He spent many hours here of late; it  seemed necessary for the furthering of his theory, and yet, whenever any one  was admitted to his presence there, he was found sitting staring at the room  and its furnishings, as if waiting for the inanimate objects to speak.</p>
  <p>&#8220;A letter? From Miss Stuart?&#8221; he said, eagerly. &#8220;I  hoped for one, by the pilot.&#8221;</p>
  <p>He opened it, and after a glance handed it over  to Haviland.</p>
  <p>It said, only:</p>
  <p class="letter">My dear Mr. Stone:</p>
  <p class="letter">Thank you for your belief in me, and forgive me  for running away. And, please,&#8212;oh, I beg of you, <i>please</i> drop the case entirely. Your further investigation and  discovery can only bring sorrow and anguish to my already distracted soul. I  have no time to write more, but assume that I have put forth any or every  argument that could persuade you, and at once cease all effort to learn who is  responsible for the death of my aunt.</p>
  <p class="letter">Sincerely yours,</p>
  <p class="letter">Pauline Stuart.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades20">Chapter 20</a><br>
    In The Boudoir</b></h2>
  <p>Apparently, Fleming Stone paid little attention  to this letter from Pauline. Really, every word engraved itself on his heart,  as he read the lines, and when he gave the paper to Gray Haviland, it was only  because he knew he would never need to refresh his memory as to the message Pauline  had sent him.</p>
  <p>Stone also read the letter she had written to  Gray, and his deep eyes clouded with pain at some of the lines. But he returned  it to Haviland without comment, and then courteously dismissed the pair.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s bothered to death,&#8221; said Gray, as they  went downstairs.</p>
  <p>&#8220;So&#8217;m I,&#8221; responded Anita. &#8220;But nobody cares  about me, it&#8217;s all Pauline,&#8212;whether she&#8217;s a&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Let up on that, &#8216;Nita!&#8221; and Gray spoke  warningly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you call Pauline names in my hearing!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Anita, pouting, flounced away to her own room.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone remained in Miss Lucy Carrington&#8217;s  boudoir. He sat on a window-seat, and looked out across the wide gardens and  the innumerable steps. There was not much snow now. Merely great wind-swept  stretches, dotted with evergreen trees, and the carved stone of the terrace  railings and balustrades.</p>
  <p>Long, Stone mused over Pauline&#8217;s letter. For a  time, he gave himself up to thoughts of her in which consideration of crime had  no part. He knew he loved her, loved her with all the strength and power of his  great nature; with all the affection and devotion of his big heart; and with all  the passion and adoration of his deep soul. He knew she was not averse to him.  Knew almost, with his marvelous power of knowledge, that she cared for him, but  he knew, too, that if he let his mind dwell on such alluring thoughts or  visions, he could not work. And work, he must. Ay, work as he had never before,  with an incentive he had never had before. And Fleming Stone&#8217;s mind was  troubled to know whether this love for Pauline would help or hinder this work  he must do. And he resolved, with all his mighty will-power, that it should  help, that he would control this surging emotion, so new to him, and would force  it to aid and assist his efforts, and to triumph over all doubts or obstacles.</p>
  <p>Again he concentrated his whole mentality on the  room and its contents. He swore to wrest from the silent witnesses the story of  the crime. This was not his usual method of procedure. On the contrary, he  almost invariably learned his points from questioning people, from observing suspects,  or quizzing witnesses. But, he realized the difference in essence between this  case and any other in which he had ever engaged. He had no more questions to  ask. He knew all any one could or would tell him. He knew all the facts, all  the theories, all the evidence, all the testimony. And none of it was worth a  picayune to him, except negatively. This case must be, and should be, solved by  the application of his highest mental powers, by the most intense thought and,  doubtless, by most brilliant and clever deduction from hints not facts, from  ideas, not visible clues. To work, then! To the work that <i>must</i> bring success!</p>
  <p>Leaving the window-seat, Stone walked round the  room, and finally drew up in front of the mirror the easy chair in which Miss  Carrington had sat when she received the blow given by Bates. Whether she had  sat here while taking the poison, no one knew. If Stone&#8217;s theory was right, she  had not.</p>
  <p>By referring to the photographs taken of Miss  Carrington after her death, Stone was able to reconstruct the scene correctly.</p>
  <p>He placed the easy chair just as it had been  when she sat in it. He assumed the position she showed in the photographs, and  gazed at himself in the mirror, as she must necessarily have done.</p>
  <p>Slowly, he went over that conversation reported  by Anita Frayne. Never, for a moment, had he doubted the truth of that report.  He was sure Miss Carrington had really said all the things Anita repeated, and  the clear and indubitable explanation of those remarks would mean, he was sure,  the solution of the mystery.</p>
  <p>By way of interviewing his silent witnesses, he  endeavored to reconstruct, in thought, Miss Carrington&#8217;s movements that night.  Pauline and Anita had left her, all three of them angry, at a little after twelve.  Later, Estelle had left her,&#8212;that was about quarter to one. Then she had on her  embroidered robe and some jewels. She was not then sitting at the  dressing-table. Nor had she then, presumably, taken the poison. For the doctors  insisted that she had swallowed the poison very near the hour of one, but after  it rather than before, and had placed the hour of her death at two. So, Stone  reasoned, Miss Carrington must have taken that aconite at pretty nearly the  very time Anita heard her talking. It seemed to Stone incredible that there  could have been a person present to whom Miss Carrington could have addressed  those remarks, and who could have given or allowed her to take the deadly  draught.</p>
  <p>The idea that Pauline could have been this  person was not among Fleming Stone&#8217;s catalogue of possibilities.</p>
  <p>Moreover, the fact of the one voice strongly  impressed him. Another voice, however low, must have at some point of the  conversation risen to an audible sound to a listener with normal hearing. Also,  Anita had asserted that the speeches of Miss Carrington did sound as if  addressed to different persons. It was not likely there were two or more  intruders or visitors there at once, and slowly but surely Fleming Stone  decided, once for all, that Miss Carrington was alone in that room at that  time. This meant, not exactly soliloquy, the mode of address contradicted that,  but it meant, to him, at least, that she was addressing some inanimate object  or objects as if they were sentient.</p>
  <p>His task was to discover those objects. His  first thought was, as he sat in the easy chair before the mirror, that the lady  had spoken to her own reflection. But the speeches, of which he had a  memorandum, precluded this hypothesis. She would not say to herself &#8220;You are so  fond of pearls,&#8221; or &#8220;You have a beautiful face.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Abandoning that supposition, Stone methodically  searched for something that might have been addressed.</p>
  <p>Clearly,&#8212;that is, if he were on the right track,&#8212;the  words &#8220;Henri, you are the mark I aim at!&#8221; could have been spoken to the Count&#8217;s  glove, which she held in her hand. In the same vein, assuming that the glove,  to her, represented the Count himself, might have been said the speech about the  ten thousand dollars, and the remark that he loved pearls.</p>
  <p>Accepting these possibilities as facts, Stone  went on to discover more. His method was to repeat to himself her very words  and strive to see or sense something to which they might have been addressed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You have the most beautiful face I ever saw,&#8221;  he quoted softly and then, scanning the room, went on: &#8220;I only wish mine were  as beautiful.&#8221;</p>
  <p>His eyes lighted on the picture of Cleopatra,  which hung above the mirror of the dressing-table.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; he cried, with instant conviction. &#8220;She  looked at that beautiful face and then in the mirror, at her plain features,  and she involuntarily cried out for the beauty denied her! Poor woman, to live all  her lonely, hungry life, surfeited with wealth yet unable to buy the fairness  she craved!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Not doubting for an instant the truth of his  conclusion, Stone checked off that speech and passed on to the next on his  list. If he could account for them all, he would be sure Lucy Carrington met  her death alone, and therefore by her own hand. Of course, she did not  knowingly poison herself, but if persuaded that the prepared draught was some innocent  remedy&#8212;oh, well, that was aside the point for the moment.</p>
  <p>But, quoting the phrase, &#8220;To-morrow I shall be  forever free from this curse of a plain face,&#8212;to-morrow these jewels may all be  yours,&#8221;&#8212;even his ingenuity could suggest no meaning but a foreknowledge of  approaching death. What else could free her from her hated lack of beauty? What  but death could transfer her fortune of jewels to another? Of course it might be  that marriage with her would give the jewels to Count Charlier, but the two  speeches were consecutive, and the implication was all toward the fate that was  even then almost upon her.</p>
  <p>The remark about ten thousand dollars was unimportant,  as she had recently willed that sum to five different people, and the reference  to a change in her will that should cut out Pauline might have been merely a burst  of temper. At any rate, Stone ascribed little importance to it then. He felt  that he had learned enough to assume positively that Miss Carrington was not  talking to a human being when Anita Frayne heard her voice. Then, he  conjectured, as the maid was free of all suspicion on the poisoning matter, and  as the two girls had left the room at a little after twelve, the weight of  evidence was in favor of the poison being self-administered, no matter for what  reason or intent. Granting this, there must be some trace of the container of  the aconite, before it was placed in the glass. This must be found. If not, it  proved its removal by some one, either before or after the poisoning actually  occurred.</p>
  <p>Eagerly, almost feverishly, Stone searched.  Exhaustive search had long ago been made, but again he went over all the  possible places. The ornate waste-basket beneath the dressing-table still held  its store of dainty rubbish. This had been ordered to remain undestroyed. Stone  knew the contents by heart, but in hope of an overlooked clue, he again turned  the contents out on a towel. Some clippings of ribbon, a discarded satin flower,  two or three used &#8220;powder-leaves,&#8221; a couple of hairpins and a torn letter were  the principal items of the familiar lot. Nothing that gave the least  enlightenment.</p>
  <p>Stone got up and wandered around. What had that  poison been in before it was put in that glass?</p>
  <p>The ever-recurring thought that some one might  have brought it to the boudoir after preparing it elsewhere, he would not  recognize. A sort of sixth sense convinced him that if he kept on looking he  must find that clue.</p>
  <p>He went into the bedroom. The beautiful  appointments, replicas of Marie Antoinette&#8217;s, seemed to mock at his quest. &#8220;We  know,&#8221; they seemed to laugh at him, &#8220;we know all about it, but we will never  tell!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Untouched since Estelle&#8217;s deft hand had turned  back its silken coverlets, the bed seemed waiting for some fair occupant. With  a sigh at the pathos of it, Stone suppressed an involuntary thought of the  incongruity of that gilded, lace-draped nest, and its pitifully unbeautiful  owner. There was a profusion of embroidered pillows, and across the satin puff  lay a fairy-like night-robe of gossamer texture, and coquettish ribbons. A peignoir  of pink crpe lay beside it, and on the floor a pair of brocade <i>mules</i> waited in vain for feet that would  never again slip into their furred linings.</p>
  <p>There was nothing helpful here, and with a sigh  Stone went on to the bath-room. Fit for a princess, the shining white and  gleaming silver showed careful readiness. Embroidered towels, delicate soaps  and perfumes were in place&#8212;all showed preparation, not use.</p>
  <p>&#8220;If I were searching traces of Estelle, now,&#8221;  groaned Stone, despairingly, to himself, &#8220;I could find thousands. But Miss  Carrington didn&#8217;t come in here at all. But, whoever rinsed that glass did!&#8221; The  thought caused Stone to start with eagerness. It was the fact of the glass  being out of line with the other appointments of the wash-stand that had first  attracted his attention to it. After the test, the glass had been returned to  its place, now in strict position between a silver cup and a flask of violet  water.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Spoon in it,&#8221; mused Stone. &#8220;Shows carelessness  on the part of whoever put it there. Don&#8217;t believe a spoon was in a glass,  generally, in this celestial bath-room. If&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>His ruminations were cut short by a shock of  surprise. Under the wash-stand was a small waste-basket. Had this been  overlooked by the searchers? Not surprising, for thorough search had not been  made in bedroom or bath-room, as in the room where death had taken place.</p>
  <p>Stone mechanically looked over the contents of  the little basket. There was only a scant handful of papers. But carefully  spreading a towel on the floor he turned the basket upside down. Tremblingly he  fingered the papers. The first was the wrapper that had contained a cake of  French soap. At a glance, Stone saw the corresponding soap in its silver dish. Estelle  had doubtless placed it there, casting away its paper.</p>
  <p>But among the scraps was another paper&#8212;two more.  They were,&#8212;they surely <i>were</i> in  creases like the folds of a powder paper!</p>
  <p>With lightest touch, Stone unfolded them. There  was one, about four inches square, that had been folded as if to contain a  powder. This was white, and of a texture like writing paper. The other was of a  paraffin paper, exactly the same size and shape, and in similar creases. Also there  was a bunchy ball of tin-foil, that, when smoothed out, proved to be of  identical shape and size with the other two.</p>
  <p>There was no room for doubt. These were  unquestionably the wrappers of the aconitine! Stone detected on the inside of  the paraffin paper traces of the powder itself, and knew that a test would  prove his discovery a true find.</p>
  <p>Now, then, where did he stand? To his own mind,  what he had found proved that Miss Carrington had herself gone to her  bath-room, opened the powder, thrown the papers carelessly in the basket, and  then, mixing the stuff with water, had taken it then and there and rinsed the  glass and set it back on the shelf. It was all natural and plausible.</p>
  <p>But, he well knew, others would say that,  remembering her detestation of medicaments, Miss Lucy Carrington never did such  a thing. Also, they would say, some one else, some one of whom Miss Lucy felt  no fear, had mixed the draught, and had administered it, by means of some yet undiscovered  but plausible misrepresentation.</p>
  <p>And only too well he knew whose name would be  associated with the deed!</p>
  <p>Heavy of heart, he returned to the boudoir and  sat in the easy chair, before the mirror.</p>
  <p>New thoughts came surging. It was sure, now,  that Miss Carrington took the aconitine in a glass of water, in her own  apartments,&#8212;one of them,&#8212;and took it, if not knowingly or willingly, at least  without any great objection or disturbance. Clinging to his theory that she was  alone, Stone visualized her taking the draught by herself. Assume for the moment,  an intended headache cure,&#8212;but no! If she took the aconitine alone and  voluntarily, she knew it was poison, for she said &#8220;To-morrow I shall be freed  forever from this homely face.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Did it all come back, then, to suicide? No, not  with that glad face, that happy smile, that joyful look of anticipation. A  suffering invalid, longing for death, might thus welcome a happy release, but  not life-loving Lucy Carrington.</p>
  <p>It was too bewildering, too inexplicable. Again  and again Stone scanned the powder papers. They told nothing more than that  they were the powder papers. That was positive, but what did it prove? To whom  did it point?</p>
  <p>Frowning, Stone studied his own face in the  mirror before him. Desperately, he repeated again all the sentences on Anita&#8217;s  list.</p>
  <p>At one of them he paused, even in the act of  repetition.</p>
  <p>He stared blankly into his own mirrored eyes, a  dawning light beginning to flame back at him. Then, a little wildly, he glanced  around,&#8212;up, down, and back to his almost frenzied, reflected face.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he muttered, through his clinched teeth,  for Stone was not a man given to strong expletives, &#8220;it is! I&#8217;ve got it at  last! The powder, the pearls,&#8212;the snake! My Heavens! the <i>snake!</i> Oh, Pauline, my love, my love&#8212;but who? who? Have I  discovered this thing only to lead back to her? I <i>won&#8217;t</i> have it so! I am on the right track at last, and I&#8217;ll follow  it to the end&#8212;the end, but it shall <i>not</i> lead, I <i>know</i> it will not&#8212;to my heart&#8217;s  idol, my beautiful Pauline!&#8221;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades21">Chapter 21</a><br>
    Fleming Stone&#8217;s Theory</b></h2>
  <p>Alone in the library, Fleming Stone and  Detective Hardy were in counsel.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to show you this thing as I see it,  Mr. Hardy,&#8221; said Stone. &#8220;I frankly admit it&#8217;s all theory, I haven&#8217;t a particle  of human testimony to back it, but it seems to me the <i>only</i> solution that will fit all points of the mystery. And I shall  ask you to consider it confidential for the present, until I can corroborate it  by unmistakable proofs.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Hardy nodded assent, his eyes fixed on the  speaker in a sort of fascination.</p>
  <p>This young detective had not been at all idle of  late, but his work had amounted to nothing definite, and though he was himself  convinced that Pauline Stuart was responsible for her aunt&#8217;s death, he seldom  exploited that view before Stone, having learned that it was an unwelcome  subject.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the theory in a very small nutshell,&#8221;  said Stone, &#8220;but remember, you&#8217;re not to mention it to any one until I give you  permission. Miss Lucy Carrington took that powder, thinking it a drug that  would make her beautiful.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;A charm? a philter?&#8221; Hardy&#8217;s eyes seemed to  bulge in his excitement.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure whether it was a fake magic  affair, say, from a clairvoyant or fortune-teller, or whether it was a plain  swindle from a beauty doctor or something of that sort. You know such people  play on the credulity of rich patrons and get enormous sums and a promise of  secrecy for a so-called beauty producer.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But why would the beauty doctor or the  clairvoyant person give a patient poison?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t. They gave a harmless powder, and  some evil-minded person added the aconite, secretly, knowing of the beauty  scheme.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Who did it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s yet to be discovered, but it will be  easier if we can trace the one who sold her the nostrum. Now, listen while I  reconstruct the scene. Miss Carrington, having dismissed her maid, goes to her  bath-room, and takes the powder dissolved in water. These powder papers, which  I found in her bath-room waste-basket, carry out that idea.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Hardy stared at the papers, but did not interrupt  the speaker.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then, joyfully waiting the effect of the charm,  she sits in front of the mirror to watch her features become beautiful. This is  why she said to her own reflection, &#8216;To-morrow I shall be freed forever from  this homely face!&#8217; She gazed at the picture of Cleopatra above her  dressing-table, and said &#8216;Yours is the most beautiful face I have ever seen. I  wish mine were as beautiful.&#8217; The remarks concerning Count Charlier were  addressed to the glove which she held in her hand, a sentimental part of the  whole performance.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mighty interesting, Mr. Stone, but pretty  fantastic, so far.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone gave his slow, grave smile, that  always betokened a surety of his own statements. &#8220;Wait a bit, Hardy, before you  condemn this notion. I haven&#8217;t finished yet. Now Cleopatra figures pretty  strongly in this scheme. Look at these photographs taken after death. They show  the lady exactly as she looked when she sat there. See, she is gazing at the picture  of Cleopatra, too intently to be merely a casual glance. And, what do you think  of this? She gazed at Cleopatra, and, holding the Count&#8217;s glove, her mind and  heart full of the Count, who would adore her when she achieved this looked-for  beauty, she said, &#8216;You are the Mark I aim at!&#8217; meaning, as Cleopatra had her Mark  Antony, she, Lucy Carrington, aimed at the Mark of her choice,&#8212;the Count.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s true, Mr. Stone, you are the wizard  of the ages! How did you dope it out? What&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now, wait a minute. This isn&#8217;t the pipe dream  you think it. But listen while I tell the rest in my own way.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Listen! I should think I would! Go on.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You know, these fakers give out these charms  with all sorts of fool directions to impress the duped customer. As I say, I&#8217;m  not sure yet whether it was a professional of the clairvoyant type, or a  regular beauty doctor. But in either case, I&#8217;ve no doubt that Miss Carrington paid  him enough to compensate for giving up his practice and leaving for parts  unknown. For after the charm failed to work, of course she would expose the  fraud.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But the poison&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Never mind that for the moment, Mr. Hardy.  Surely, if we can discover for certain how and why the dose was taken, it will  go far to help us trace the criminal who added the deadly element to the  powder. Now, continuing the Cleopatra idea, I am sure that the clever clairvoyante,&#8212;we&#8217;ll  assume that&#8217;s what she was,&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;She?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Merely to designate this faker person. Somehow  I seem to see her as one of those crystal-gazing, frowsy-headed kimonoed  females, who prey on the credulity of rich and foolish women,&#8212;well, let&#8217;s call  her that for the present, this clever clairvoyante somehow conceived the idea  of offering to make Miss Carrington as beautiful as Cleopatra. Perhaps she had  been here to see Miss Carrington on the subject, and that beautiful picture of Cleopatra  put it into her head. But, assuming something of this sort, assume further that  she directed Miss Carrington to robe herself, in a general way, like the queen  in the picture. Note the pearls! Wouldn&#8217;t this explain Miss Carrington&#8217;s  getting her pearls from the bank for this occasion? And wouldn&#8217;t it explain her  speech, &#8216;You love pearls,&#8217; as being addressed to Cleopatra, to whom she was  talking!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Go on, Mr. Stone! <i>Go</i> on!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I will go on! Wouldn&#8217;t that explain, as nothing  else on this green earth can, the purchase of a paper snake by the woman who  feared and abhorred the reptiles! Supposing the fool clairvoyante had told her  that to become like Cleopatra she must have a semblance of a snake at her  throat, as Cleopatra had the asp!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good Heavens!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I tell you, Mr. Hardy, nothing else would  account for that snake! And any one of these things might seem the result of a  lunatic imagination by itself, but taken all together, the theory holds water!  Why think of the Oriental scarf, the embroidered robe, the mass of jewels in  addition to the significant pearls, and the scarabs! All point to the type of Cleopatra.  If there had been a picture on the wall, say, of Helen of Troy, and Miss  Carrington had been rigged up in a Greek costume, with a fillet in her hair,  and sandals on her feet,&#8212;or if the picture had shown the Goddess of Liberty,  and we had found Miss Carrington draped in an American flag, could any one have  denied the significance? There can be no doubt,&#8212;no doubt in this world, Hardy,  that the costume, the jewels and the snake all point to a connection with the  picture of Cleopatra, and if so, what other connection is possible than the one  I&#8217;ve blocked out? Answer me that! And, finally, the speech to the Count, whose  glove she fondled, &#8216;You are the Mark I aim at.&#8217; A pleasantry of wording inevitably  suggested by the thought of the man Cleopatra charmed and the man Miss  Carrington desired to charm. And a play on words too, not at all unnatural to  her, for I&#8217;m told she was both witty and clever in conversation.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr. Stone, I am carried away by your arguments.  I can&#8217;t deny their plausibility, but I am bewildered. How did you fathom this  remarkable plan?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Simply because there is no other plan that will  fit the facts. I believe Miss Carrington did say all those things Miss Frayne  relates. I believe she was alone in the room when she said them. Therefore,  they must have had some meaning, and the meanings I have just ascribed to them  must be the true ones.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;They must be&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And I will further satisfy you that they are.  Here is a memorandum I found in Miss Carrington&#8217;s desk. It is, as you see, a  list of items. Read it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Hardy&#8217;s eyes stared more widely than ever as he  read:</p>
  <p>Green and gold boudoir robe. Jewels, especially  pearls. Scarabs. Scarf. Snake. Something belonging to H.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now, that,&#8221; and Fleming Stone spoke in low,  even tones, without a hint of boasting or pride in his achievement, &#8220;is a list  in Miss Carrington&#8217;s own writing, and is undeniably a list of things to be worn  on the occasion which she hoped would mean a delightful change to the beauty  she so desired to be, but which, instead, was a change to the cold stillness of  death. I found that, after reaching my own conclusions about the Cleopatra  business. If I had found it before, I would have known it must refer to her  costume, but I couldn&#8217;t have gleaned from it the conclusions I had already come  to. Now, Hardy, are you convinced?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I am, Mr. Stone. And I am also puzzled. From  all this knowledge, we start fresh, as it were, and we&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wait a minute, Hardy. Let&#8217;s go slowly. Now,  here are two ways to look at this thing. I told you about the clairvoyante  first, because that first came to my mind as the inevitable explanation. But,  suppose, instead of a professional clairvoyante or beauty doctor, some friend  or&#8212;&#8221; Stone set his teeth, but went on steadily, &#8220;or some one in the household,  planned all this scheme, and pretended to get a powder that would accomplish  this transformation, gave it to the unsuspecting lady to take by herself, and in  reality this powder was the aconite.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Hardy jumped. &#8220;Then Miss Stuart&#8212;&#8221; he began.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; and Stone&#8217;s face was white and his voice  like cutting steel, &#8220;<i>Why </i>Miss Stuart?  Why not Miss Frayne, who listened at the door? Why not Estelle, who knew all  her mistress&#8217; secrets? Why not Haviland, who is openly enjoying his present  responsible position as man of affairs? Why not Count Charlier, whose crafty  cunning shows on his face? Of course, <i>also,</i> why not Miss Stuart, but why <i>necessarily</i> Miss Stuart?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, she has run away, you know&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So she has, because of unjust and unfounded  suspicions! When clues point directly to her, I shall admit them, but when they  may equally well point to half a dozen others, I shall patiently investigate  them and learn the truth. Now, I ask of you, Hardy, as man to man, <i>not</i> to favor Miss Stuart unduly, but to  give her a fair show, and remember her lonely position and her timid nature.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Hardy looked furtively at Fleming Stone, whose  eyes were downcast and fastened on some papers he was holding.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Count on me, Mr. Stone. I am at your orders. I  subscribe to your theories, and I will do exactly what you tell me, and no more  or less.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good, Hardy, and thank you. Now, look at these  papers. They are the ones that contained the fatal powder. See, this paraffin  one was inside; then one of tin-foil, then one of rather heavy writing-paper.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t look altogether like a  clairvoyante&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why not? It does to me. They are mighty careful  to do up their goods in an elaborate manner to impress their customers. But, mind  you, I don&#8217;t for a moment suspect this clairvoyante individual of intended  murder. Either the aconite was added to the parcel from the clairvoyante, or  the whole affair was concocted by the murderer and under pretense of its having  come from the clairvoyante.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; Hardy was clearly beyond his depth.</p>
  <p>&#8220;So,&#8221; went on Stone, &#8220;we must deduce what we can  from these papers. What do you see peculiar about them?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Just plain little old nothing,&#8221; Hardy declared  after a good scrutiny. &#8220;I see, as you remarked, three papers, folded similarly,  and of nearly the same size. What do you see?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not much more,&#8221; confessed Stone, gazing  discontentedly at the papers. &#8220;And yet, there must be something to notice. Here&#8217;s  one point. These papers, if tampered with, I mean if anything was added to  their contents, were manipulated very carefully. You know how difficult it is  to unfold and refold a powder-paper without making it look messy. These, I  would be willing to assert, have never been refolded, or, as I say, if they  were, it was done very carefully.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t much of a clue,&#8221; and Hardy smiled.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; returned Stone. &#8220;It at least  indicates a possible elimination of the clairvoyante and an indication of the  murderer preparing the powder alone. At any rate, Hardy, I&#8217;ve told you all this  in order to ask your help. Will you go and see what you can round up in the way  of the clairvoyante of our dreams? Go to all you can find in New York City.  That is the prominent ones. Get a line on beauty doctors, and generally look up  this sort of thing. And keep it all under your hat.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All right, Mr. Stone,&#8221; and Hardy was off at  once.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone put away the papers, and sat for  more than an hour in a brown study. It must be admitted that a photograph of  Pauline Stuart, which stood on a near-by table, held his eyes much of the time.  And his gaze, as it rested on the lovely face, was now tender and now sad.</p>
  <p>At last he rang for a servant. To the footman  who replied, he made a request that a chamber-maid be sent to him.</p>
  <p>The girl came, wondering.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mary?&#8221; said Fleming Stone, inquiringly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Jane, sir,&#8221; returned the maid, quietly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Stone. &#8220;You have intelligence,  Jane, as shown by your calm rejoinder. Now, I want you to go to the various  bedrooms or dressing-rooms of all the members of the family and of all the  servants, and bring me all the manicure scissors you can find. I assume that  some of the servants might possibly have them?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, sir, some of them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very well. Get all you can possibly find, and  be very, <i>very</i> careful to remember  which ones are whose. Understand?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then go. If anybody questions you, say Mr.  Stone ordered it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Jane returned with many pairs of the kind of  scissors asked for by the Detective. Absorbedly, Stone took them from her, and  one by one he used them to snip at a sheet of paper from the library desk.</p>
  <p>At each test, he asked Jane whose the scissors  were, and sometimes he wrote the name beside the cut and sometimes not. One  pair in especial seemed to interest him. &#8220;Whose are these?&#8221; he asked.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Those, sir, I took from Miss Carrington&#8217;s  dressing-table.&#8221; Jane gave a slight shudder as if at the recollection of the  tragedy of that table.</p>
  <p>&#8220;But these are of a different patterned handle  from the rest of that dressing-table&#8217;s silver.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir, as to that. They were there  and I brought them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very well, Jane. Take them all back to their  places. Mind now, don&#8217;t mix them.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, sir. Thank you, sir.&#8221;</p>
  <p>A strange excitement seemed to seize upon  Fleming Stone. Abruptly he left the room, and, flinging on his overcoat in the  hall, he snatched his hat and went away, almost on a run. His steps took him to  the garage and in a few moments he was in a swift little runabout being driven  to the sanatorium where Estelle was still staying.</p>
  <p>After a call there, he hurried to Police  Headquarters. Thence, after a rather long call, to a telegraph office, to one  or two shops and then back to Garden Steps.</p>
  <p>Here he put several servants at work for him,  packing his effects and such matters, then summoning Gray Haviland to the  library, he said; &#8220;I&#8217;m sailing for Egypt this afternoon. May I ask you to make  no further investigations till my return?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Egypt!&#8221; gasped Gray. &#8220;Good Heavens, man! what  for?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In the interest of my work for you,&#8221; returned  Stone, gravely.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Rubbish! You&#8217;re chasing Pauline! We&#8217;ll never  see either of you again!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone smiled. &#8220;I do love her, Haviland,  I make no denial of that fact. And I do hate to have her alone in a strange  land. So, if I can be of any help to her, an ocean or two to cross shall not keep  me from her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And your detective work?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Will not suffer by my absence. I&#8217;ve been to the  Police and to the District Attorney and they approve my plans as I&#8217;ve outlined  them so far. The rest must wait my return.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ah, and when will you be back?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly, but I will keep you  informed of my whereabouts. Say good-by to Miss Frayne for me, and please  excuse me now, as I&#8217;ve heaps to do. By the way, where is that record of Miss  Carrington&#8217;s song that I have heard of? Play it for me, will you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Thought you were in such a hurry!&#8221; laughed  Haviland, but granted the request.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; commented the Detective, as he  heard it on the phonograph. &#8220;It is a perfectly-made record. If you don&#8217;t mind,  I&#8217;ll take possession of it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Gray, carelessly, and in  another half hour Fleming Stone was on his way to the pier where the <i>Macedonia</i> was making ready to sail.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades22">Chapter 22</a><br>
    Pauline In Cairo</b></h2>
  <p>On the first of March, about mid-afternoon, the <i>Catalonia</i> steamed into the harbor of  Alexandria. Pauline, at the rail, watched the clearing outlines of mosques and  minarets, as the beautiful city became visible. It was a glistening, dazzling  strip, between the deep blue of the sea and the azure of the sky, and,  breathless with delight, she gazed at the shining sunlit picture.</p>
  <p>Then the Arab pilot came aboard, and soon  Pauline found herself in a shore-boat, swiftly making for the quay. She knew  Loria would meet her at Alexandria, she had had a telegram at Naples to that  effect, and she thrilled with pleasure at thought of seeing wonderful Egypt  with him. Landing, she was bewildered by the crowd of strange-looking people, natives,  tourists, officials and porters, all shouting, running and getting in each  other&#8217;s way. Luggage was everywhere, and the game seemed to be to present any  piece of it to anybody except the owner. Pauline fell to laughing at the antics  of a black man robed in white and a brown man robed in yellow fighting for  possession of a small portmanteau, while its timid and bewildered owner  desperately hung on to it herself.</p>
  <p>Three or four Arabs gathered round Pauline  herself, each asserting his claim to all the virtues of a perfect dragoman. In  more or less intelligible English, each insisted he had been sent to her  personally by Effendi This or That, of marvelous wealth and power. Greatly  interested, she listened to their arguments, until, encouraged, they became so insistent  that she was frightened. Seeing this, they waxed threatening, even belligerent,  in their determination to be engaged, and just as one laid his brown, long  fingers on her arm, and she drew back in a panic of fear, she saw Carr Loria&#8217;s  smiling face coming to her through the crowd.</p>
  <p>With a wave of his hand and a few short  commands, he sent the bothersome Arabs flying, and greeted Pauline with  affectionate enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Polly, dear! but I&#8217;m glad to see you! Have you  had a good trip? But such questions must wait a bit. Where are your checks? Do  you see your boxes?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one, and some hand things. Here is&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; and Loria took the little sheaf of  papers she produced from her handbag. &#8220;Ahri, look after these.&#8221;</p>
  <p>A tall Arab glided to Loria&#8217;s side, and took the  checks. &#8220;Ahri is my dragoman and body-servant and general factotum,&#8221; said  Loria, by way of introduction. &#8220;This lady, Ahri, is my cousin, Miss Stuart. Her  word is law.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Loria. Miss Stoort is queen of all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The man made a salaam of obeisance and turned  away to look after the luggage.</p>
  <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a wonder, that Ahri,&#8221; said Carrington  Loria, looking after the retreating Arab. &#8220;But be very haughty with him, Polly.  He presumes upon the least encouragement. Treat him like the dust under your  feet, and he&#8217;ll adore you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy enough,&#8221; and Pauline smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;m  scared to death of these brown and black men. But your servant is so grand of  costume.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s a very high-class affair. Handsome  chap and fond of dress. But he&#8217;s invaluable to me. Speaks almost perfect  English, and knows everything there is to know,&#8212;and then some. Knows, too,  everybody who has ever been in Cairo or ever thought of coming here. And he  possesses the proud distinction of being the only dragoman here-abouts who hasn&#8217;t  a letter of recommendation from Hichens. You haven&#8217;t that, have you, Ahri?&#8221; for  the Arab had just reappeared.</p>
  <p>A marvelous set of white teeth gleamed in the  sunlight, as the response came quickly: &#8220;I had one, Mr. Loria, but I sold it.  They are of use to others; Ahri needs none.&#8221; His self-conceit was superb, and  he spoke with the air of a prince. But warned by Loria, Pauline gave him no  answering smile, rather a patronizing nod, and Ahri&#8217;s respect for the newcomer  went up several points.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come along, girlie,&#8221; commanded Carrington and  he took Pauline&#8217;s arm as he hurried her to the boat-train.</p>
  <p>Watchful Ahri showed them to the compartment he  had secured for them, and soon they were on their way to Cairo.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now, tell me everything,&#8221; said Carr Loria, as  they sat alone. &#8220;This is a three-hour trip and I want to know the whole story.  Just think, Pauline, I&#8217;ve had only a few letters, and they were&#8212;well,&#8212;they were  almost contradictory in some ways. So tell me all, from the beginning.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline did, and by the time they reached Cairo,  Loria knew as much as she of the death of their aunt and the subsequent search  for the murderer.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it strange,&#8221; he mused, &#8220;that that Bates  person should go in to kill her, the very night somebody else had the same  intention?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, but, Carr, Bates didn&#8217;t start out to kill  her, you know; he went to steal the jewels, and he knew they were all in the  house that night, because Estelle told him so. Now, of course, whoever gave her  the poison, must have known it too&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. Why didn&#8217;t somebody want to  put her out of the way to get a bequest? Not necessarily the Count gentleman,  but maybe one of the servants. Maybe that Estelle? Didn&#8217;t she receive a legacy  in Aunt Lucy&#8217;s will?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, but nobody has thought of suspecting her.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t see why not. I thought of her first clip.  I don&#8217;t think that Stone paragon amounts to much. Hey, what are you blushing  about? Sits the wind in that quarter?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tease me, Carr. I <i>do</i> like him better than any man I ever saw, but&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And so you ran away and left him! Out with it,  Polly. Tell your old Uncle Dudley the story of your life!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to tell, Carr, about Mr. Stone.  But I came to you, because some people suspect me,&#8212;<i>ME</i>&#8212;of&#8212;of killing Aunt Lucy&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Pauline! They don&#8217;t! Who suspects you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All the police people, and Gray and Anita  Frayne,&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;They do! You poor little girl! I&#8217;m glad you  came to me. I&#8217;ll take care of you. But, Polly, whom do <i>you</i> suspect? Honest, now, who is in your mind?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Carr. I can&#8217;t seem to think. But  when they fastened it on me, I was so frightened, I just flew. Why, just think,  every one at Garden Steps was suspicious of me! I could see it even in the  servants&#8217; eyes. I couldn&#8217;t stand it, and I was afraid&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, dear, go on,&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, I was afraid Mr. Stone would think so,  and I couldn&#8217;t bear that, so I just ran off on impulse. I regretted it lots of  times on the trip over,&#8212;and then at other times I was glad I came. Are you  glad?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sure, Polly. I wanted you to stick to your plan  of coming over, you know. Yes, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here. Now, we&#8217;ll soon be in  Cairo, and you&#8217;ll love it,&#8212;all the strange sights and experiences. You&#8217;ll live  at Shepheard&#8217;s for the present. I&#8217;ve engaged a chaperon for you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;How thoughtful you are, Carr.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, of course, a beautiful young woman can&#8217;t  live alone in Cairo, and also of course, you couldn&#8217;t live with me. So, Mrs.  MacDonald will look after you, but she won&#8217;t in any way bother you. Whenever  you need a duenna, she&#8217;ll be right at your elbow, and when you don&#8217;t want her  about, she is self-effacing. You&#8217;ll like her, too, she&#8217;s not half-bad as a companion.&#8221;</p>
  <p>At Cairo, Ahri handed them from the train. Again  Polly was impressed with the Arab&#8217;s dignified bearing and rich costume. His  long galabeah, shaped like a well-fitting bathrobe, was of white corded silk,  exquisitely embroidered. Collarless, it gave glimpses of other silken  vestments, and over it he wore a correct English topcoat, short and  velvet-trimmed. From his tarbush to his English shoes and silk hose, he was  perfectly garbed and groomed, while the scarab ring on his little finger was  the only bit of jewelry visible.</p>
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; laughed Loria, following her  glance. &#8220;Wait till you see him in all the glory of his burnoose and other  contraptions. Here, Ahri, take this duffel, too. And, now, Polly-pops, you&#8217;ll  see Cairo.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The ride to the hotel was like a moving picture  in color. The street crowds were rushing by, a flare of bright-hued raiment and  dark-skinned faces. Everywhere, baubles were for sale. Street vendors carried  them on their heads, in their arms, or thrust them forth with eager hands.</p>
  <p>Post-cards, jewelry, scarfs, and fans.  Fly-whisks with dangling beads. Embroideries, carved ivories, brasses,  sweetmeats, fruits and newspapers, all were successively and collectively  offered for immediate, almost compulsory sale.</p>
  <p>&#8220;And I want to buy every one!&#8221; declared Pauline,  entranced at the sight of the catch-penny toys.</p>
  <p>&#8220;All in good time, honey. To-morrow, Ahri shall  take you to the bazaars, with or without Mrs. MacDonald, as you choose, and you  can get a bushel of foolishness if you want to. Everybody has to cure that  first mad desire to buy rubbish, by yielding to it. You soon get enough.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then I may go alone with Ahri to the shops?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, anywhere, by daylight, except to social  affairs. There, or to any in-door entertainment, you must take her. But she&#8217;ll  know all these things. Abide always by her decision.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t you be with me, Carr? You speak as if  I will be much without you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully busy, Pauline; I&#8217;ll tell you all  about it this evening. Then you&#8217;ll understand. Here we are at Shepheard&#8217;s. Did  you ever see such a horde of freaks?&#8221;</p>
  <p>It was just about dusk. The last rays of the  Egyptian sunset were lingering, as if for Pauline to get one glimpse of the  picture by their rainbow lights. Many were at tea on the broad Terrace; the  scarlet-coated band crashed their brasses; and Pauline entered the hotel, her  whole being responding to the strange thrill that Cairo gives even to the most phlegmatic  visitor or jaded tourist.</p>
  <p>Later, at dinner, she met Mrs. MacDonald, a  correct, tactful and diplomatic widow, who looked forward with pleasure to the  chaperonage of the beautiful girl to whom she was introduced.</p>
  <p>At Loria&#8217;s advice, Pauline had put on evening  dress; and she made a striking picture, in black tulle, devoid of all jewelry  or ornament save a breast-knot of purple orchids her cousin had sent to her  rooms.</p>
  <p>At dinner, conversation was general, and the  trio was made a quartet by the addition of an English friend of Loria&#8217;s whom he  ran across in the hotel lobby. Later, after they had had their coffee in the  great hall, Mrs. MacDonald and the Englishman strolled away and the cousins  were left alone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;How beautiful you have grown, Pauline,&#8221; Carr  said, his eyes resting on her piquant face, crowned with its mass of soft, dark  hair.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Speak for yourself, John,&#8221; she returned smiling  up into the handsome, sunburned face of the man who scrutinized her. &#8220;You have  acquired not only a becoming tan, but a new air of distinction.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Glad you think so, girlie. Thanks a whole lot.  How do you like the MacDonald?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Very much so far. She won&#8217;t try to boss me,  will she?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not unless you make it necessary; but you must  remember that English etiquette obtains in Cairo, and you mustn&#8217;t try to be  unconventional, except as Mrs. MacDonald approves.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, I won&#8217;t disgrace you, Carr, I&#8217;ve common  sense, I hope. Now tell me about yourself.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m deep in a new project, Polly, a wonderful  one. It&#8217;s an enormous undertaking, but I shall put it through all right.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What is it? Excavation?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;In a way. But here&#8217;s the story. Mind, now, it&#8217;s  a dead secret. Don&#8217;t mention it to Mrs. Mac. I trust you with it, but it must  go no further. Well, in a word, I&#8217;ve come into possession of an old papyrus,  that tells of a treasure&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, Carr, are you a treasure-seeker?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now, wait till I tell you. This papyrus is  authentic, and it&#8217;s nothing more nor less than an account of a great hoard of  jewels and gold sunk, purposely, by an old Egyptian king to save them from  seizure. You wouldn&#8217;t understand all the reasons that prove this is a true  bill, but it is, and so you must take my word for it. All right. The old duffer  saw fit to sink this stuff in the Nile, at a certain spot, designated in this papyrus  thing, and all I&#8217;ve got to do is to dig her up, and there you are!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Carr Loria&#8217;s face lighted up with the enthusiasm  of the true archologist, and Pauline caught the spirit, too, as she exclaimed,  &#8220;How splendid! How do you get down to it,&#8212;if it&#8217;s under the Nile?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big scheme, Polly!&#8221; and Loria&#8217;s eyes  sparkled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to have a coffer-dam, an enormous one,&#8212;and, oh, and a whole  lot of paraphernalia, and it will cost like fury, but the end justifies the expense,&#8212;and  then, think of the glory of it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Have you got a right to do all this? Can  anybody dig wherever he likes in Egypt?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, you little goose! But I&#8217;ve managed all that  part. I won&#8217;t tell even you about it, but I&#8217;ve&#8212;well, I&#8217;ve fixed it up. Now,  listen here, Pollypops, you&#8217;re to tell just simply <i>nobody</i> a word of all this,&#8212;not one, littlest, leastest mite of a  word! See?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;All right, Carr, of course I won&#8217;t tell, if you  say not to. But will you be away from us? Out of Cairo?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Off and on. I&#8217;ll be back and forth, you know.  This place is up the Nile a bit, and, of course, I have to be there much of the  time. But you&#8217;ll be all right. I know heaps of people, jolly sort, too, and  Mrs. Mac will take you round, and you&#8217;ll have the time of your sweet young  life!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I shall. But, Carr, have you forgotten  all about America, and Aunt Lucy and&#8212;and Fleming Stone?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No, Pauline, I haven&#8217;t forgotten those things.  But, I own up, aside from the awful circumstances, I&#8217;m not terribly wrought up  over Aunt Lucy&#8217;s death. Poor old thing, she wasn&#8217;t so awfully happy, you know,  and Lord knows, she didn&#8217;t make anybody else happy. Then, too, you must realize  that as I wasn&#8217;t there, through the dreadful time, as you were, I can&#8217;t feel  the same thrill and horror of it. In fact, I try to forget it all I can, as I  can&#8217;t do anybody any good by mulling over it. So, if you want to please me, old  girl, you&#8217;ll refer to it as little as you can.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you care who killed her? Don&#8217;t you  want to find out the murderer and bring him to justice?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I want that done, Polly, but <i>I</i> don&#8217;t want to do it. That&#8217;s why I put it  all in Haviland&#8217;s hands; that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t want to go to America, unless, as  I told you at first, unless <i>you</i> needed me. I can&#8217;t pay proper attention to my work here if I have any such  worriment as that on my shoulders. And I tell you, Pauline, this chance that  has come to me is the chance of a lifetime, the chance of a century! It means  fortune, fame and glory for me. It means&#8212;oh Pauline, it means <i>everything!&#8221;</i></p>
  <p>&#8220;All right, Carr, I won&#8217;t interfere in anyway  with your work. I&#8217;ll do as you tell me, but&#8212;but if they continue to suspect me,&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Suspect you! My <i>dear</i> girl! Let &#8216;em try it! I&#8217;ll see to that! Don&#8217;t you fear. If  anything bothers you, just leave it to me! Ah, here come our truants. Now,  Polly, for my sake, leave all those subjects for the present, and be your own  dear entertaining self.&#8221;</p>
  <p>And Pauline granted his request, and was so  attractive and charming that the Englishman straightway fell over head and  heels in love and Mrs. MacDonald was torn between throes of admiration and  envy.</p>

    Two Wills</b></h2>
  <p>For a few days Loria staid in Cairo, and devoted  all his time to the amusement and entertainment of Pauline. Together they  visited the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids. Together they made trips to Old  Cairo and to the Ostrich Farm. Together they saw the Little Petrified Forest.  But the immediate sights of Cairo, the tombs, mosques and bazaars, Loria told her,  she could visit with Mrs. MacDonald or with their dragoman, after he and Ahri  had gone on their trip up the Nile.</p>
  <p>Pauline was happy. At Carr&#8217;s request she had  endeavored to put out of her mind the horrors she had been through. Frightened  at the suspicions directed toward herself, fearing that she could not  successfully combat them,&#8212;and, for another reason,&#8212;she had fled to Egypt, and  her cousin&#8217;s protection. This other reason she had almost dismissed from her  mind, and she gave herself up to the enjoyment of the novelty and interest of  her present situation.</p>
  <p>After their sight-seeing each day, they returned  for tea on the Terrace at Shepheard&#8217;s or went to Ghezireh Palace for it, or to  the house of some friend. Dinner was always a pleasant affair, and they had  frequent guests and were often invited out.</p>
  <p>As Pauline was wearing mourning, no large social  affairs were attended, and under Mrs. MacDonald&#8217;s guidance the girl pursued her  happy way.</p>
  <p>Nearly a week after Pauline&#8217;s arrival, Loria  told her that the next day he must leave her, and go up the Nile to attend to  his work there. They were in the sitting room of Pauline&#8217;s pleasant suite at  the hotel, and Mrs. MacDonald promised to cherish most carefully her charge in  Loria&#8217;s absence.</p>
  <p>&#8220;How long shall you be away, Carr?&#8221; asked  Pauline.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s uncertain, Polly. Perhaps only a few days  this time, perhaps a week. I&#8217;ll be back and forth, you know, and you&#8217;re bound  to find enough to interest you. Keep me advised of any news from America. You  can always reach me by mail or wire, or telephone if need be. And, here&#8217;s another  matter, Pauline. You know, this work I&#8217;m up against is more or less dangerous.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Dangerous, how?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s blasting and danger of cave-ins  and such matters,&#8212;but don&#8217;t feel alarmed, I&#8217;ll probably come through all right.  Only, I want to make my will, so if anything should happen, you&#8217;ll be my heir  without any fuss about it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t talk about such things, Carr. You  frighten me.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nonsense, don&#8217;t take it like that. Now, see  here. You know my way. Touch and go is my motto. So, I&#8217;ve asked a lawyer chap  to come here to-night and fix up things. Suppose you make your will, too. Then  it will seem more like a business matter, and not as if either of us expects to  die soon. Who&#8217;s your heir to be, Polly?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve never thought about it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But you ought to. You see, now you&#8217;re <i>some</i> heiress, and it isn&#8217;t right not to  have a will made,&#8212;on general principles. To be sure, you may marry,&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think I ever will, Carr!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nonsense, Pollypops, of course you will. But  you must take your time and select a good chappie. Now, how does this strike  you? Jeffries, my lawyer, is coming here, right away. Suppose we each make a  will, leaving all our worldly goods to each other. Then, later, when you decide  on your life mate, you can change and rearrange as you like.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But I haven&#8217;t any fortune yet. Aunt Lucy&#8217;s  estate isn&#8217;t all settled, is it?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No matter about that. It will be, in course of  time. I have every confidence in Haviland, he&#8217;s as honest a chap as ever  breathed. He&#8217;ll fix up all our interests over there, in apple-pie order and don&#8217;t  you forget it! Humor me in this thing, Polly, and believe I know more of  business affairs than you do, and it&#8217;s best to do as I say.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline was easily persuaded, and as the  arrangement was conceded to be merely temporary, she agreed. Jeffries came. The  two wills were drawn, signed and witnessed, all in correct form. Loria, in his,  bequeathed to Pauline all he might die possessed of, and except for a few  charities and minor bequests, Pauline left her fortune to Carr. The business  was soon over, and Loria took both documents, saying he would put them in his  Safe Deposit box for the present, as Pauline had no place for valuable papers.</p>
  <p>The next day, Loria, accompanied by the  invaluable Ahri, went away to the site of his projected enterprise. This affair  was conducted with such strict secrecy that even the location was not known to  many. Actual work had not yet been begun, but negotiations and preparations of  vast importance were being made, and secret conclaves were held by those most interested.  Pauline had been emphatically adjured to give not the least hint to any one  whatever of the project, and she had promised faithfully to obey Carr&#8217;s  injunctions.</p>
  <p>The next afternoon, a telegram from Fleming  Stone announced his arrival at Alexandria and his immediate appearance in  Cairo.</p>
  <p>Addressed to her, in Loria&#8217;s care, Pauline  received it duly, for her mail was brought to her at Shepheard&#8217;s, and Carr&#8217;s  forwarded to him wherever he might be. She had had a cable from Haviland, but  no American letters had yet reached her. Stone, having sailed just a week after  Pauline&#8217;s departure from New York, was arriving eight days after her own advent  at Cairo.</p>
  <p>The girl&#8217;s first emotion was of joy. The thought  of seeing Stone again, eclipsed all other thoughts.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Mac!&#8221; she cried, clasping that  somewhat rotund matron round the waist and leading her an enforced dance. &#8220;Mr.  Stone is coming! Will be here for tea! Oh, I <i>am</i> so glad!&#8221;</p>
  <p>But her second thoughts were more disturbing. <i>Why</i> was he coming? What were his  suspicions? Could he be tracking her down? Though Fleming Stone had never said  a word of love to her, Pauline knew, by her own heart&#8217;s &#8216;detective instinct,&#8217;  that he <i>cared.</i> But, his sense of duty  might make it necessary to follow where the trail of suspicion led, even at  cost of his own affections. Then, too, could he suspect?&#8212;But Pauline&#8217;s irrepressible  joy at thought of seeing him left her little time or wish to indulge in gloomy  forebodings.</p>
  <p>Singing, she ran off to dress for Stone&#8217;s reception.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Which is prettier?&#8221; she asked of Mrs. Mac,  holding up an embroidered white crpe, of Cairo construction, and a black net  gown, brought from New York.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Wear the white, Miss Stuart. It&#8217;s most becoming  to you.&#8221;</p>
  <p>It was, and when arrayed in the lovely, soft,  clinging affair, with a cluster of tiny white rose-buds at her belt, Pauline&#8217;s  unusually pink cheeks and her scarlet flower of a mouth gave all the color  necessary.</p>
  <p>Her beautiful hair, piled in a crown atop her  little head, was held by a carved ivory comb, and beneath their half-drooped  lashes her great eyes shone like stars.</p>
  <p>For the Terrace, she donned a large white hat,  with black ostrich plumes, and flinging a white cape edged with black fur over  her arm, she descended to meet her guest.</p>
  <p>Though little given to emotional demonstration,  Fleming Stone caught his breath with a quick gasp at sight of her, and advanced  with outstretched hands and a smile of a sort no one had ever before seen on  that always calm face.</p>
  <p>&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; she said, smiling; for, though  thrilled herself, she remembered the unfailing curiosity of the Terrace crowds.</p>
  <p>But Stone, having taken her two hands in his,  stood looking at her as if he intended to pursue that occupation for the rest  of his natural life.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; she said, laughing a little  nervously under his gaze; &#8220;this is our table. Will you have tea?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Tea, of course,&#8221; and at last Fleming Stone took  himself in hand and behaved like a reasonable citizen. &#8220;And how are you? And  your cousin, where is he?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr. Loria is out of Cairo just now,&#8221; and  Pauline turned to give the waiter his order. &#8220;But we are three, as I am under  most strict surveillance&#8212;&#8221; she paused, realizing what that phrase meant to a detective!  &#8220;Of a perfect dragon of a chaperon,&#8221; she continued bravely, trying to control  her quivering lip. &#8220;Here she comes now.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The appearance and introduction of Mrs.  MacDonald gave Pauline time to regain her poise, and a glance of pathetic  appeal to Stone made him take up the burden of conversation for a few moments.  And then, with the arrival of the tea, the chat became gayer, and, of course,  impersonal.</p>
  <p>The Englishman, Pitts, appeared, indeed, he  inevitably appeared when Pauline was on the Terrace, and joined the group  without invitation.</p>
  <p>It was not Fleming Stone&#8217;s first visit to Egypt,  and he noted with interest the changes, and looked with gladness on things  unchanged, as the kaleidoscopic scene whirled about him.</p>
  <p>Later, they all went up to Pauline&#8217;s sitting  room, and viewed the street pageant from second-story windows.</p>
  <p>And then, Mrs. MacDonald, after a short and  losing battle between her conventions and her kind-heartedness, insisted that  Mr. Pitts must take her across the street to buy some imperatively necessary  writing-paper.</p>
  <p>Outwardly courteous but inwardly of a rampageous  unwillingness, Mr. Pitts acquiesced in her scheme, and Fleming Stone politely  closed the door behind them.</p>
  <p>He turned, to see Pauline looking at him, with a  gaze, frightened, but,&#8212;yes, surely,&#8212;welcoming, and not waiting to analyze the  intent of the gaze more deeply, Stone took a chance, and in another instant,  held her in his arms so closely that the intent of her glance was of little importance  to anybody.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Pauline!&#8221; he breathed, &#8220;how I love you! My  darling,&#8212;mine! No, no, don&#8217;t speak&#8212;&#8221; and he laid his finger tips on her parted  lips, &#8220;Just look at me, and so&#8212;tell me&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>The wonderful eyes raised themselves to his, and  Stone&#8217;s phenomenal insight was not necessary for him to read the message they  held.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You do love me!&#8221; he whispered: &#8220;oh, my little  girl!&#8221; and after a long, silent embrace, he cried jubilantly: &#8220;Now tell me! Now  tell me in words, in words, Pauline, that you do!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Unhesitatingly, without shyness, Pauline,  radiant-faced, whispered, &#8220;I love you, dear,&#8221; and the vibrant tones filled the  simple words to the brim of assurance.</p>
  <p>Though it seemed to them but a moment, it was  some time later that Mrs. MacDonald&#8217;s tap sounded on the door.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; cried Pauline, springing away from Stone&#8217;s  side, while he sauntered to the window. &#8220;Oh, Mrs. MacDonald, you must know it  at once! Mr. Stone is my fianc!&#8221;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Mac was duly surprised and delighted, and,  after congratulations, sent Stone away to dress for dinner, and endeavored to  calm down her emotional charge.</p>
  <p>Later that evening, Stone and Pauline sat in the  hall watching the people. Almost as much alone as on a desert island, they  conversed in low tones, and Stone, between expressions of adoration, told her  of his theory of the beauty charm.</p>
  <p>With paling face, Pauline listened. &#8220;Who?&#8221; she  whispered. &#8220;Who? Do you suspect anybody?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know of your aunt ever having  consulted any beauty doctor or any such person?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, no! I&#8217;m sure she never did. Never!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t know of any one who would give  her poison, under pretense of its being a charm or beautifier?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t! Don&#8217;t ask me!&#8221; and, with a face  white as ashes, Pauline rose from her chair. &#8220;You must excuse me, Mr. Stone. I  am ill,&#8212;I don&#8217;t feel well&#8212;. Really I must beg to be excused.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Almost before he realized what she was doing,  Pauline had left him, glided to the elevator, and he heard the door of the cage  clang to, even as he followed her.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Poor child!&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;poor dear  little girl!&#8221; and going in quest of Mrs. MacDonald, he asked her to go to  Pauline.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You will perhaps find her greatly disturbed,&#8221;  he said, &#8220;but I assure you it is nothing that can be avoided or remedied.  Please, Mrs. MacDonald, just try to comfort and cheer her, without asking the  cause of her sadness.&#8221;</p>
  <p>After a straightforward look into Stone&#8217;s eyes,  which was as frankly returned, Mrs. MacDonald nodded her head and hastened  away.</p>
  <p>As Stone had predicted she found Pauline sobbing  hysterically.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What is it, dear?&#8221; she queried, &#8220;tell Mrs. Mac.  Or, if you&#8217;d rather not, at least tell me what I can do for you. Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t  cry so!&#8221;</p>
  <p>But no words could she get from the sobbing  girl, except an insistent demand for a telegraph blank. This was provided, and  Pauline wrote a message to Carr Loria telling him that Fleming Stone had come  to Cairo. This she ordered despatched at once. Then she begged Mrs. MacDonald  to leave her, as she wished to go to bed and try to forget her troubles in sleep.</p>
  <p>Meantime, Fleming Stone left the hotel and  proceeded straight to Carr Loria&#8217;s rooms. He expressed surprise when the  janitor informed him of Mr. Loria&#8217;s absence.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, never mind,&#8221; he said: &#8220;he&#8217;ll be back in a  few days. But I&#8217;ll just go in and write a note and leave it on his desk for  him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>The janitor hesitated, but after a transference  of some coin of the realm was effected, he cheerfully unlocked the door and  Stone found himself in Loria&#8217;s apartment. It was a comfortable place, even  luxurious, in a mannish way, and the Detective looked about with interest. As  he had proposed, he went to the writing table and taking a sheet of paper from the  rack, wrote a short note. But instead of leaving it, he put it in his pocket,  saying to the watchful janitor that perhaps it would be better to mail it.  Then, he stepped into Loria&#8217;s bedroom, but so quickly did he step out again,  that the janitor hadn&#8217;t time to reprove or forbid him.</p>
  <p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, as he started to leave. &#8220;When  Mr. Loria returns you can tell him I called.&#8221;</p>
  <p>This permission went far to allay the janitor&#8217;s  fears that he had been indiscreet; for Carr Loria was not a man who brooked  interference with his affairs or belongings.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Blades24">Chapter 24</a> <br>
    Confession</b></h2>
  <p>Carr Loria was at Heluan when he received  Pauline&#8217;s telegram. For a few moments he studied it, and then going to a hotel  office, he possessed himself of a telegram blank which he proceeded to write  on, by the use of a type-writer near-by.</p>
  <p>With a preoccupied look on his face, as if  thinking deeply, he called Ahri and gave him a long and careful list of  directions.</p>
  <p>And it was in pursuance of these directions that  the Arab presented himself at Shepheard&#8217;s at ten o&#8217;clock in the morning and  asked for Miss Stuart.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What is it, Ahri?&#8221; asked Pauline, as she  received the dragoman in her sitting room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Miss Stoort,&#8221; and the Arab was deeply  respectful, &#8220;Mr. Loria begs that you go with me to Sakkara to visit the  Pyramids and Necropolis.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Now?&#8221; said Pauline, in surprise.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, my lady. Mr. Loria will himself meet you  at the station. Will you start at once, please?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;But I am expecting a caller&#8212;Mr. Stone,&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Pardon, but Mr. Loria said if you hesitated for  any reason, to implore you to go with me quickly, and he will explain all.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline paled a little, but she said, simply, &#8220;Very  well, Ahri, I will go at once.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Escorted by the silent, majestic-mannered Arab,  Pauline was taken through the crowded streets to the station, and they boarded  a train just as it was leaving.</p>
  <p>&#8220;We did get the train, Miss Stoort,&#8221; said Ahri,  with his sad smile, &#8220;Mr. Loria would be greatly mad if we had missed it. Yes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline nodded at him, her thoughts full of the  spoiled day, which she had hoped to spend with Stone.</p>
  <p>Yet she longed to see Carr, she wanted to tell  him what Mr. Stone had said about the beauty charm and&#8212;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You said Mr. Loria would meet us at the  station, Ahri; you put me on the train so quickly I had no chance to speak.  Where is he?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Not the Cairo station, my lady. The station at  Bedrashein.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where is that?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Where we are going. We alight there to see the  ruins of Memphis and the Pyramids of Sakkara.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline looked puzzled, but said no more and sat  silently wrapped in her own thoughts, now of Stone, now of Carr, and again of  herself.</p>
  <p>At Bedrashein, they left the train. Pauline  looked anxiously around but saw nothing of her cousin.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I do not see him,&#8221; said Ahri, gravely, meeting  her inquiring glance; &#8220;but I obey his orders. He said, if he be not here, we go  to the desert to meet him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;To the desert? How? Where?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;This way. Here are our carts.&#8221; Ahri led the way  to where two sand-carts stood waiting, evidently for them. They were a little  like English dog-carts and drawn by desert horses.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You take that one, Miss Stoort, and I this,&#8221;  directed Ahri, standing with outstretched hand, like a commanding officer.</p>
  <p>Bewildered but knowing the responsibility of  Carr&#8217;s servant, Pauline got into the cart he indicated. She did not at all like  the looks of the gaunt black Moor who drove her, but thought best to say  nothing. She had learned never to show fear of the native servants, and she  held her head high, and gave the driver only a haughty stare. Ahri, after she  was arranged for, sprang into the other cart, and they set off.</p>
  <p>The road was through the village, through palm  groves, past large expanses of water, and at last through desert wastes, among  foot-hills that quickly cut off the view of the road just traversed.</p>
  <p>Pauline&#8217;s cart was ahead of the other, and looking  back she could not see the other one, in which Ahri rode.</p>
  <p>A strange feeling began to creep into her heart.  Covertly she glanced at her driver. The hard bony face was not turned her way,  but she had an uncanny sense that the man was grinning at her. Sternly she bade  him stop and wait for the other cart.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No Ingleese,&#8221; he rejoined, with a dogged  expression on his ugly countenance.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I command you,&#8221; and Pauline laid hold of his  arm, &#8220;I insist that you stop!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No Ingleese,&#8221; he repeated, and now he gave her  a distinctly impudent look and spurred the horse to faster pace.</p>
  <p>Pauline considered. She was frightened beyond  words to express, but she knew she must not show fear. Haughtily she held her  proud little head aloft, and tried to think what was best to do. Something was  wrong, that she knew, but whether it was Ahri who was at fault, or this  dreadful man beside her, or&#8212;or,&#8212;she stifled back the thought of Loria.</p>
  <p>He would save her, she knew he would, cried her  worried brain, but in her heart was black doubt. All the unadmitted fears she  had known of late, all the repressed suspicions, all the insistent doubts,  these came flocking, clamoring for recognition.</p>
  <p>On they went,&#8212;where they might be she had no  idea. Nothing could be seen but the never-ending hills, not high, but of  sufficient height to cut off all view of anything but their sandy slopes. Miles  and miles they traversed. The sun was under a cloud, and Pauline had no  knowledge of the direction they were taking. But from the man&#8217;s grim, stony  face, and cruel eyes, she knew she was in dreadful, even desperate danger. Courageously,  she insisted over and over that they stop. The reply was only a shaken head and  a reassertion that English was an unknown tongue. This Pauline knew to be a  lie, from his intelligent expression at her words. At last, desperately trying  to control her trembling hands, she offered her purse, if he would stop.</p>
  <p>To her surprise, he consented, and jerked his  horse to a stand-still. Pauline handed over the purse, and the driver got out  of the cart, indicating by gestures that she should also alight, and rest  herself.</p>
  <p>The cart was small, and the ride had been  uncomfortable, so after a moment&#8217;s thought Pauline jumped out. She reasoned  that the man having her money, had no desire to prolong the trip, and in a  moment they would go back to Bedrashein. Often had she heard of these  robberies, and she felt that, cupidity satisfied, she had little to fear.</p>
  <p>But no sooner was she on the ground, than the  Moor sprang again into his cart, and whipping up his horse, sped away across  the desert sand and in a minute rounded a hill and was out of sight.</p>
  <p>Pauline looked after him an instant, and then,  realizing to the uttermost what it meant,&#8212;that she was abandoned to her fate in  a trackless desert,&#8212;fell in a little heap on the sands and fainted away.</p>
  <p>It was about eleven o&#8217;clock on the morning of  that same day, that Carr Loria went to Shepheard&#8217;s Hotel and asked for Fleming  Stone.</p>
  <p>The two men met, and eyed each other  appraisingly. There was no light chat, each was of serious face and in grave  mood.</p>
  <p>Loria spoke first, after the short greeting. &#8220;I  have a telegram from my cousin, Miss Stuart,&#8221; he said, drawing a paper from his  pocket. &#8220;I know why you are here, Mr. Stone, and I think best to show you this.  Frankly, I am glad of it.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone took the message, and read:</p>
  <p>I have run away again. I am afraid of F. S. Don&#8217;t  try to find me, I am all right, and I will communicate with you after he goes  back to U. S. I positively will not make my whereabouts known as long as he is  in Cairo. Don&#8217;t worry.</p>
  <p>Polly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;We may as well be honest with one another,&#8221;  Loria went on. &#8220;I gather, from your presence here, that you know my cousin is  guilty of the death of her aunt; but you <i>don&#8217;t</i> know, you <i>can&#8217;t</i> know, what that poor  girl had to put up with. I can&#8217;t blame her, that in a moment of,&#8212;really of temporary  insanity,&#8212;she let herself be tempted&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to cut short this interview, Mr.  Loria,&#8221; said Stone, in his quiet way, &#8220;but, truly, I&#8217;ve a most important  engagement just now. If I could see you, say this evening, and talk these  things over by ourselves&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Surely, Mr. Stone. I must return to my work  to-morrow, but I&#8217;ll see you to-night. Will you come to my place?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, I will. About nine?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Nine it is,&#8221; and Loria swung away, as Fleming  Stone turned and hastened into the hotel.</p>
  <p>Straight to Mrs. MacDonald he went and asked  where Pauline was.</p>
  <p>&#8220;She went to visit Memphis and Sakkara with her  cousin,&#8221; said the smiling chaperon. &#8220;That is, she went with her cousin&#8217;s  dragoman, and Mr. Loria met them at Bedrashein.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Oh, <i>did  he!</i> Now listen, Mrs. MacDonald. Miss Stuart is in danger. I am sure of  this. I am going to her aid, but I may not&#8212;&#8221; Stone choked, &#8220;I may not succeed  soon. Tell me of this dragoman. What does he look like?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Graphically, Mrs. MacDonald described the  statuesque Ahri, and almost before she stopped speaking, Stone was flying along  the corridor, down the stairs, and out at the door.</p>
  <p>He caught a train to Bedrashein, and the first  person he bumped into at the little station was Ahri himself waiting for the  train to Cairo.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone went straight to the point. &#8220;Look  here, Ahri,&#8221; he said to the astonished Arab, who had never seen him before, &#8220;what  have you done with Miss Stuart?&#8221;</p>
  <p>For once the phlegmatic Arab was caught off his  guard.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;I have not  seen her to-day.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lie to me,&#8221; and Stone gave him a look  that cowed him. &#8220;Now listen. You&#8217;re in Mr. Loria&#8217;s pay. All right. He paid you  well for the job you&#8217;ve just done. Now, I&#8217;ll pay you twice,&#8212;three times as well  to undo it. Moreover, I&#8217;ll inform you straight that you&#8217;ll never work for Mr.  Loria again. He&#8217;s a villain, a wicked man. Take my advice, Ahri, give him up and  come over to me. By so doing, you&#8217;ll not only escape punishment for your work  to-day, but get a fresh start toward a good position. I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re a  bad man at heart, Ahri. At least, I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;ll continue to be if you&#8217;re  better paid to be good.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Stone was right about this, and the talk ended  in another expedition of two sand-carts into the desert. Ahri in one, with a  native driver, Stone alone in the other, driving himself. Ahri&#8217;s cart was  driven by the same Moor that had driven Pauline only two or three hours before.  Stone followed them, the wicked driver easily bought over to betray the place where  he had left Pauline.</p>
  <p>And there they found her.</p>
  <p>Crouched at the base of a small hill, worn out  by weeping and despair, racked by fright and terror, she had fallen into a  fitful slumber from sheer exhaustion. Jumping from his cart, Stone waved the  others back and went to her. On her face were traces of tears. Her gloves and handkerchief  were torn in strips by her agonized frenzies. Her shoulders were huddled as if  in frantic fear, and her face was drawn and pinched with anguish. But in spite  of all this, Stone thought he had never seen her look so beautiful. Stepping  nearer he lifted her to her feet, and unheeding the observers, he clasped her  closely in his arms, and whispered endearing words.</p>
  <p>Pauline, her eyes still closed, murmured, &#8220;it&#8217;s  only a dream. I must not wake, I <i>must </i>not!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No dream, darling,&#8221; said the strong, glad voice  in her ear. &#8220;Does this seem like a dream?&#8221; and his lips met hers in a long,  close kiss.</p>
  <p>Then her eyes opened, wondering, and lest she  should faint from very joy, Stone carried her to the cart and placed her in it.  Jumping in beside her, he ordered the other cart to lead and they started back.</p>
  <p>Neither Pauline nor Stone ever forgot that ride.  At first, she was content to ask no questions, happy in his nearness and her  own rescue from an awful fate. But, later, she inquired about Loria.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You must know the truth soon, dearest,&#8221; said  Stone, gently, &#8220;so I&#8217;ll tell you, in part now. Your cousin is a wicked man,  Pauline, and you must grasp this fact before I go on.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Carr wicked?&#8221; and Pauline paled and trembled as  if struck with a sudden blow.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, it was his hand, his will, that sent you  to be lost in the desert. He showed me a false telegram, saying you had run  away from me!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What? oh, I can&#8217;t believe it!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t try now,&#8221; and Stone smiled at her. &#8220;It&#8217;s  all I can do to manage this fiery steed without trying to tell you unbelievable  things at the same time. Let me tell you something more easy of credulity.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline&#8217;s smile was permission, and Stone had no  difficulty in convincing her of certain self-evident truths.</p>
  <p>By the time the trio reached Cairo, Ahri was as  staunch a follower and as true a slave of Fleming Stone as he had been of  Carrington Loria. At Stone&#8217;s direction he returned to his former master, for  the present, and gave no hint of the later development of the kidnapping  scheme.</p>
  <p>&#8220;All went off as planned?&#8221; said Loria, secure in  his servant&#8217;s fidelity.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, master,&#8221; answered the devoted trusty, and  Loria said no more on the subject.</p>
  <p>That evening when Fleming Stone went to Carr  Loria&#8217;s rooms, he was accompanied by Pauline and the Englishman, Pitts.</p>
  <p>Loria started at sight of his cousin, but  quickly recovered his poise and jauntily asked her where she had come from.</p>
  <p>&#8220;No place like Cairo, for me,&#8221; she replied in the  same light tone, and they all sat down in Loria&#8217;s den.</p>
  <p>&#8220;More company than I expected,&#8221; he said, as he  bustled about, seating them. &#8220;Ahri, another chair.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Ahri obeyed the request, and then softly left  the room.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Mr. Loria,&#8221; said Stone, directly, &#8220;there is no  use wasting words, we are here to accuse you of the murder of your aunt and the  attempted murder of your cousin.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Carr Loria&#8217;s face blanched, but he tried to put  on a bold front.</p>
  <p>&#8220;What do you mean by this nonsense? Is it a  joke?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;By no means; I have all the proofs of your  crimes and I ask you if you will confess here, or to the Police?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Friend Pitts, I believe, is connected with the  Police,&#8221; and Loria laughed grimly.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, he is. Have you anything to say?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Only to deny your accusations. Except that it&#8217;s  too absurd even to deny such foolish talk. What do you mean anyway?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;That you poisoned Miss Lucy Carrington,  wilfully and purposely, by sending her a dose of powdered aconite, under the  pretense of its being a beauty charm that would bring fairness and youth to her  plain face.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Carr Loria&#8217;s jaw dropped. He looked at Stone as  if at something supernatural. &#8220;W&#8212;what?&#8221; he stammered.</p>
  <p>&#8220;You did it to get her money, <i>now</i>, to go on with your work in the bed of  the Nile. Then, in order to get your cousin&#8217;s share of the fortune, you sent  her away to die in the desert, having first induced her to will you her money.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Ha, ha,&#8221; laughed Loria, feebly. &#8220;Poor joke,  Stone, pretty poor joke, I say! Murdered my own aunt! Not much I didn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Carr Loria, listen!&#8221; Impressively Stone held up  his finger, to adjure silence, and at the same time he bent on Loria a glance  of accusation that made him cringe. But, fascinated, he stared into Stone&#8217;s  eyes, and in the death-like silence came a voice,&#8212;the voice of Lucy Carrington,&#8212;in  a burst of ringing laughter! Loria&#8217;s eyes seemed to start from his head, and  the sweat gathered in great drops on his forehead, as the voice of his aunt  spoke: &#8220;This song is one of Carr&#8217;s favorites,&#8221; they heard, distinctly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll  sing it for him.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Then, in Miss Lucy&#8217;s high, clear notes, came the  song, &#8220;Oh, Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms.&#8221;</p>
  <p>Before the last strains came, Loria was raving  like a maniac. He had never heard of the phonograph records of his aunt&#8217;s  songs, for they had meant to surprise him with them on his next trip home.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Have mercy!&#8221; he cried: &#8220;stop her! Oh, my God!  what does it all mean?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Confess,&#8221; ordered Fleming Stone.</p>
  <p>&#8220;I will confess! I do confess! I did send her  the powder, just as you say. I wrote her to dress up like Cleopatra, and put on  her pearls, and scarabs, and fasten an asp, a paper one, at her throat, and  take the stuff, and it would cause Cleopatra&#8217;s beauty to come to her. I told  her to hold in her hand something belonging to the man she loved. It was a great  scheme,&#8212;a fine scheme,&#8212;&#8221; Loria was babbling insanely now. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how any  one ever found it out. I was so careful! I made her promise to burn all my  notes and letters about it, before I would send the powder. <i>Who</i> suspected it? I planned everything  so carefully&#8212;<i>so</i> carefully&#8212;Made her  promise to burn everything,&#8212;everything&#8212;letters of instruction, powder-papers,  everything must be burned, I said&#8212;everything,&#8212;and she said, yes, Carr,  everything. Over and over I wrote it. Told her that if she left anything  unburnt the charm wouldn&#8217;t work, and it didn&#8217;t. Ha, ha,&#8221; with a demoniac  chuckle, &#8220;it didn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Take me away, I can&#8217;t stand it,&#8221; moaned  Pauline.</p>
  <p>Again there was a silence. The phonograph had  ceased; Loria sat, with his head fallen forward on his hands, at his table. He  was still, and Stone wondered if he were alive. Then, suddenly, he lifted his  head, and cried out.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, I did it because I was crazy, <i>wild</i> over my Nile scheme. Ah, that wonderful  work! It will never be done now. When I heard Stone was here I knew it was all  up. I planned to lose Polly for a time,&#8212;not forever, no, <i>not</i> forever&#8212;I would have found her some day,&#8212;some day,&#8212;all dead, in  the desert, all dead&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>Pauline fainted and Stone flew to her side. But  in a moment she revived, and he begged her to go home. She consented, and Ahri,  dependable now, took her to the hotel.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone and Mr. Pitts attempted to get  Loria to calm down and talk more coherently. Shortly he did so. He gave a full  account of all the details of his crime, and though he denied the intention of  leaving Pauline to die in the desert, his word was not believed by the two listeners.</p>
  <p>Finally, he rose and walked across the room. &#8220;You  see,&#8221; he said, a little wearily, but quite sane, now, &#8220;I&#8217;ve a bad streak in me.  My father was a Spaniard and he killed his own uncle. The Loria line is a  series of criminals. Aunt Lucy never knew this, for my parents lived always  abroad. But blood will tell. And my father, after he killed my uncle, followed  it up by taking his own life,&#8212;like this,&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>Though Stone caught the gesture and sprang to  prevent it, Loria was too quick for him. He had snatched a dagger from the  table, and plunged it into his heart.</p>
  <p>Both men leaped at him, but it was all over in  an instant. Carr Loria had himself dealt the punishment for his crimes.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s as well,&#8221; said Stone, musingly. &#8220;A  trial, and all that, would have been awful for his cousin, and the family  connections. Now the matter can be disposed of with far less notoriety and  publicity.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Pitts.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone waited till morning to tell  Pauline of her cousin&#8217;s death. She was wide-eyed and pathetically sad, but  composed.</p>
  <p>&#8220;It is all so dreadful,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but,  Fleming, I knew it before I left New York. I didn&#8217;t<i> know</i> it, exactly, but I felt sure it must be so, and I had to come  here to see. Then I found Carr so gay and light-hearted I thought I must be  mistaken, and I was glad, too. Then when you came, I couldn&#8217;t make up my mind  whether you suspected Carr, or whether&#8212;&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Whether I came only to see you,&#8221; supplied Stone.  &#8220;It was both, dear.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;What made you think of Carr, in the first  place?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Because there was no real evidence against any  one else, though the police were making things dangerous for you, my little  girl.&#8221; Stone held her close, as if even yet there might be a hint of danger. &#8220;And  I made Miss Frayne confess that she didn&#8217;t really see you leave your aunt&#8217;s  room that night, though she did honestly think that you were in there, and your  aunt was talking to you. Nor you didn&#8217;t see her actually leaving the room, did  you?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I only saw her with her hand on the door-knob.  That was my first glimpse of her, and I thought she was coming out.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No; she thought of going in to apologize for  her hasty temper. But, hearing a voice, she paused, and so thrilling was the talk  she overheard, she waited there some minutes.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;And then, you thought of Carr?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I sized up all the people who had motive, and  Loria was surely in that category. And then I found the powder-papers. Dear,  those would have gone sorely against you if any one else had discovered them. I  resolved to wrest the secret from those papers, and I did!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;You did? How?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;By studying them for hours; with magnifying  glasses, and without. I found at last a clue,&#8212;a possible clue,&#8212;in the fact that  the edges of the papers had been cut with the curved blades of a pair of  manicure scissors. I had Jane bring me all the manicure scissors in the house,&#8212;thank  Heaven, <i>your</i> scissors didn&#8217;t come  within a mile of fitting the edges! You see, the papers were faintly scalloped  on every edge. They <i>must</i> have been  cut by the little curved blades, and rarely do two pairs of manicure scissors  make the same scallop. The great discovery was that Miss Lucy&#8217;s own scissors  did fit them! This, dearest, would have pointed to you in the eyes of these  determined police, for you had access to your aunt&#8217;s toilet appointments.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;So did Anita or anybody in the house!&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Yes, but the police were hot on your track, and  ready to bend any hint your way. Oh, thank God, that I could and did save you!  Well, I further noticed that these scissors of Miss Carrington&#8217;s were of a  different pattern from the brushes and mirrors of her set. I went to Estelle,  and she told me that the last time Carr Loria was at home he took a great fancy  to his aunt&#8217;s scissors and asked her to give them to him. She did, and when she  tried to get another pair with that especial shaped blade, she could do so only  by taking a different patterned handle! Do you wonder that I came straight over  here?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; and the lovely eyes beamed with admiration  of Stone&#8217;s cleverness, as well as with affection.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Then, last night, I went to Loria&#8217;s rooms, and  found not only the scissors, that fitted exactly the scalloped papers, but  found that the outside powder wrapper is undoubtedly a piece of his own writing-paper.  It is the same color and texture. Moreover, as he confessed it all, there is no  further room for doubt. Another hint I had was when I found some of Loria&#8217;s  letters in your aunt&#8217;s desk. Not their contents, they were just such as any  affectionate nephew might write his aunt, but the chirography. You know the  letter from him that you showed me, was typewritten, and I judged nothing from  it. But his handwriting,&#8212;I have studied the science,&#8212;gave evidence of criminal  traits, and I felt sure then I was on the right track. I brought the phonograph  record to frighten him into confession, and it did. Ahri started it, in the  next room, at my signal.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;I might have known you would do it. When I came  here, you know, I wrote and asked you to drop the case. I feared your  investigations would lead to Carr.&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;It had to be a question of his guilt or yours,&#8221;  returned Stone gravely. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know, darling, how near you were to arrest!  Let&#8217;s not think of it ever again. I&#8217;ll engage to keep your dear mind occupied  with pleasant thoughts all the rest of our life. You don&#8217;t want to stay in  Cairo, do you? Shall we try Algiers for a honeymoon spot? Or, if you don&#8217;t want  Africa at all, how about Greece, or over to Algeciras? Whither away, my Heart&#8217;s  Dearest?&#8221;</p>
  <p>&#8220;Whither? Together, then what matter whither?&#8221;  said Pauline, her eyes full of a love deep enough to drown the sorrows that had  filled the past weeks.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Together always,&#8221; he responded, holding her to  him; &#8220;always, my Pauline.</p>
