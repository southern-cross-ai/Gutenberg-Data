  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; THE NEW PATIENT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I TOOK my stethoscope and went over the patient's chest. I
  wanted to determine his general condition, since he was now committed to my
  care as medical director of the State Hospital for the Insane. He had struck
  me as being in a rather bad way when he was brought in from the capital city
  farther north. It was part of my professional duty to look out for his
  physical welfare as well as endeavor to set right his distorted brain.</p>

  <p>I had one of the nurses remove the hospital garment into which he had been
  put, and then I set the disk of my instrument over the region of his heart.
  It was bad, very bad indeed. The burr and whisper of its labored action came
  through his emaciated flesh with surprising loudness. I frowned and went on
  to the lungs, and found them suffering from the effects of that faulty
  circulation.</p>

  <p>A dissociation of personality had been alleged by the physicians who had
  sent him into my hands. In other words, the man was supposed not to know who
  he was&mdash;to have lost his true identity, or be confused about it in his
  own mind. But the case was not violent, had given no indications of any wish
  to work harm to any one about him. Indeed, the entire course until now had
  been of a melancholic turn.</p>

  <p>I finished my examination and straightened, and met the regard of his
  eyes. They were a very dark brown, and they were fixed intently on my face.
  What was more, they gave me one of the oddest sensations I had ever had in my
  life.</p>

  <p>I had never seen the man before. Of that I was positive. And yet as I met
  the steady glance he held upon me, I felt that I knew those eyes&mdash;the
  eyes, mind you&mdash;or what was behind them&mdash;looking out as through a
  window in a darkened house. I'm not sure, but I think I caught my breath.</p>

  <p>"Send the nurse away, will you, Dr. Murray?"</p>

  <p>For the first time during my examination the patient spoke, and the sound
  of it was almost like a half-checked laugh. It was as though the man felt a
  perfectly sane and understanding amusement in the situation in which he found
  himself.</p>

  <p>Then, as I hesitated, more in surprise than from any other reason, he went
  on: "Oh, I'll not be violent or try to escape, or anything like that. I
  merely want to talk to you&mdash;yourself."</p>

  <p>I nodded to the attendant, who left the room, and turned back once more to
  encounter those, strangely familiar eyes.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know me; Dr. Murray?" their owner inquired.</p>

  <p>"I never saw you before," I said, determined to meet this phase of the
  man's condition, whatever it was, in as natural a way as I might. "And
  yet&mdash;" Right there I paused.</p>

  <p>"And yet&mdash;you aren't sure about the denial even while you make it."
  He laughed without any sound. Insane in a mild way he might be, but he
  certainly seemed to know what he was saying and to be enjoying the somewhat
  puzzled expression which I fancy must have shown upon my face. "Murray,
  you're both right and wrong. You've never seen this body, so far as I know,
  but I hardly think you've forgotten Jason Croft."</p>

  <p>"Croft! Good Heavens!"</p>

  <p>The words dribbled off my lips. I gasped. Now I knew what it was about
  those eyes that held me. Croft I had not forgotten, but&mdash;so far as earth
  was concerned&mdash;he had died; I had pronounced him dead myself; had seen
  his body consigned to the grave. And it had been the body of a splendidly
  proportioned man&mdash;no such pitiful physical wreck as this figure in the
  bed.</p>

  <p>But it had been Jason Croft who had given to me what as nearly amounted to
  a proof of spiritual life apart from the mortal body as any man might
  have&mdash;who had told me, shortly before his death occurred, the most
  remarkable tale my ears had ever heard, a tale incredible in itself, and yet
  one which, despite all arguments against it, I had always felt myself
  inclined to believe. In addition to that, when his story was ended he had
  announced that he was forsaking his earthly body for life on another planet;
  had told me that some day I would receive a call and find his earthly body
  dead, but that on that other star, Palos&mdash;a world in the system of
  Sirius the Dog Star&mdash;he would be possessed of another body and Naia,
  Princess of Aphur, as wife.</p>

  <p>Unbelievable? Of course it was unbelievable. And yet Croft's earth body
  died, just as he said it would. And if any one could have heard his story as
  I did when he told it, I think the auditor would have been moved to credence
  just as I was myself.</p>

  <p>Croft was a physician even as I am. He was a scientific man. In addition,
  he was a student of what most of us call the occult&mdash;the science of the
  mind, the spirit, the soul. So much I know, not only from his words but
  material evidence. His former home had contained the greatest private
  collection of works on the subject I have ever seen. According to his own
  statements, he had advanced so far in his investigations of the subject that
  he could project his own astral body anywhere at will. And by anywhere, I
  mean to be understood in the literal sense.</p>

  <p>Many men have acquired the ability of which he was master, as applying to
  the earthly sphere; Croft, however, had carried it to its ultimate degree and
  had shaken off or entered the atmospheric envelope of our planet at will. In
  our conversation, which ended with his announcement that he was going back to
  Palos to wed Naia and live out his life in that other world, he had explained
  the whole thing to me&mdash;largely as I felt at the time and after, because
  I had dabbled in the occult to some extent, and he knew I would understand,
  in part at least.</p>

  <p>In making clear his motives he had even broached the subject of twin
  souls&mdash;the doctrine that each spirit is originally dual, but incarnates
  as two individuals&mdash;a male and a female in the flesh. He alleged that
  since a child he had felt a vague prompting toward the Dog Star, which he
  could not understand until he went there in the astral form, once he had
  gained the power, and found on Palos a woman&mdash;his true counterpart, his
  twin soul, as he declared his belief.</p>

  <p>But, to accomplish his mating with her, Croft declared further that he had
  done a most remarkable thing. Discovering a man dying from a mental rather
  than a bodily condition on the other star, he had waited until his death
  occurred and then appropriated the still physically viable body to himself;
  and he explained the thing in a very comprehensible manner at the time,
  describing the whole procedure in a scientific way, until unbelief faltered
  and one felt that the thing had been done.</p>

  <p>Over that body he had acquired as full control as he had of his own. He
  might at will throw it into a cataleptic sleep. After that he led a sort of
  double existence&mdash;sometimes on Palos, sometimes on earth&mdash;until his
  plans were finally shaped. Then, and then only, did he finally forsake the
  mundane life for that other and fuller existence which he felt the Palosian
  girl would make complete.</p>

  <p>At the time I had questioned him as fully as time and my own knowledge
  would permit, and he had answered in a way which not only convinced me, but
  amazed me.</p>

  <p>I had asked him concerning the time of his passing from earth to that
  other distant star billions of miles across space, in a universe outside our
  own. And he had replied that outside the mental atmosphere of man time did
  not exist; that between the planets was only eternity; that one could not use
  what was non-existent; that he could reach Palos in the condition toward
  which he journeyed to it as quickly as I could project myself there in
  thought. In similar fashion he had been able to meet each of my several
  interrogative points. In the end I had been content to merely listen to the
  astounding narrative he told.</p>

  <p>That story I had not forgotten any more than I had the man himself. But
  that he should have reversed the experiment which had given him a physical
  life on Palos in order to return to earth was more astounding still. And
  yet&mdash;if I were to believe the evidences of my well-nigh reeling
  senses&mdash;that was exactly what had occurred; because, no matter how
  beyond all accepted tenets of life the thing was, I couldn't help feeling
  that it was Croft's spirit looking out at me from the new patient's eyes.</p>

  <p>Then as I stood there, tongue-tied, considering those things, he spoke
  again.</p>

  <p>"Rather fusses you a bit, doesn't it, Murray? Well, never mind. I didn't
  expect to come back here when I left, but needs must, you know, as they say
  on earth. I don't wonder that it surprises you to find me speaking to you
  with the lips of this poor hulk of flesh&mdash;not very much like the one in
  which you knew me, is it?&mdash;but it will suffice, even if it has a pair of
  lungs badly engorged because of a very shaky heart. Your laboratory will show
  the kidneys affected, too. Oh, it's an incipient wreck that I'm holding
  together simply for my use&mdash;because I need it, and because I wanted to
  get down here with you."</p>

  <p>"With&mdash;me?" I faltered. Almost as surprising as all else was his calm
  announcement that he was here because he wanted to see me.</p>

  <p>He smiled slightly. "Yes&mdash;you, of course. Murray, come, down to facts
  and quit speculation. There is nothing surprising in that. You were the only
  man on earth who knew my story&mdash;who had the truth&mdash;who could
  understand&mdash;and I knew you understood a good bit of the forces
  involved&mdash;the spiritual forces, that is. So, when I needed certain
  information which I couldn't gain save in the flesh, I knew you were the man
  to help me gain it&mdash;the one man to whom I could appeal with a chance of
  success. But in order to reach you I had to limit my choice of earthly
  bodies. That's how I came to choose this thing at which you're
  looking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" I interrupted. "Good Heavens, Croft! I never
  dreamed of your reversing the process. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "It's a poor rule that won't work both ways, isn't it,
  Murray?" he said.</p>

  <p>I nodded. "Yes&mdash;of course. And you've really done it&mdash;come
  back&mdash;like this?"</p>

  <p>I asked the question as I would have asked a similar one of Croft, because
  now I was convinced that I was speaking to the man himself&mdash;his
  intelligence, that is.</p>

  <p>And he answered me without the least hesitation:</p>

  <p>"Yes. And it's your job to keep me alive until I can gain what I came
  for&mdash;to help me, if you will. Earth possesses knowledge I need on Palos
  for my work&mdash;you can help me gain it just as well here as anywhere else.
  'Stone walls do not a prison make,' Murray or 'iron bars a cage.' Man, it's
  your cooperation for the advancement of a wonderful people I've come
  a-seeking. I want you to prescribe a certain course of study as a part of my
  treatment and discuss the things I'm after with me. Do you catch my
  plan?"</p>

  <p>Oh, yes, I caught it. I began to understand. Bizarre, wonderful, beyond
  anything imaginable as it seemed. I felt that I appreciated the whole concept
  of his scheme. And I was flattered&mdash;I confess that I thrilled at his
  words&mdash;that he should have come to me for such aid as he felt I would
  give. All at once I had the feeling that a wonderful privilege was placed in
  my hands&mdash;that I was to have a part in this remarkable adventure between
  two worlds which Croft had made his. I made an effort to rally my staggering
  senses, and, as one will at such a time, I made a casual rather than a
  pertinent remark:</p>

  <p>"Just how is the Princess Naia?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. He seemed to find acceptance of my part in my question. "The
  Princess Naia is very much all right."</p>

  <p>And then I remembered what he had told me before he went to Palos for what
  I had thought a definite stay. And if struck me that it was rather odd to be
  speaking of the Palosian girl as one would of a neighbor next door, but I
  amended my reference to her none the less:</p>

  <p>"Or perhaps I should have asked for Mrs. Croft&mdash;you said that you
  expected to be married immediately upon your return to Palos."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II. &mdash; EXPLANATIONS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CROFT frowned. "What one expects and what one meets are not
  always one and the same, friend Murray," he rejoined. "As a matter of fact, I
  returned to Palos after my conversation with you, to encounter a situation of
  which I had never thought."</p>

  <p>"You mean that it interfered with your marriage to the princess?" I
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He made a grimace. "I mean exactly that, both on the part of Naia herself
  and because of something else. You remember Zud, the high priest of
  Zitra&mdash;the imperial city of which I told you&mdash;who sponsored me with
  Tamhys before the Zollarian war. And you recall no doubt that I mentioned the
  fact that I left the body of Jasor of Nodhur, which I had made my own, in
  Zud's apartments in the pyramid of Zitra when I came back here for the last
  time, and that Naia was quartered during my absence in the rooms set apart
  for the Gayana&mdash;the Vestals of Ga the Virgin in the pyramid, too.
  Murray, when I got back there, fully expecting to take things up where I had
  left them, I found that Zud had proclaimed me the Mouthpiece of Zitu
  himself."</p>

  <p>"The Mouthpiece of Zitu!" I drew a chair close to the bed and sat down.
  The thing affected me oddly.</p>

  <p>I cast back in my mind for what Croft had told me concerning the religion
  of Tamarizia, which was the nation in whose affairs he had taken an active
  part on the distant star. Zitu was God in their belief. Ga was the
  woman&mdash;a virgin. Azil was her son&mdash;known as the Giver of Life. And
  if Croft had been proclaimed by the high priest of the central state of the
  empire, the head of the clerical college, as the Mouthpiece of Zitu I began
  to sense dimly the position in which he must have found himself on his
  return&mdash;just what it might have meant.</p>

  <p>If Zud had proclaimed Croft anything of the sort, it was just about the
  same as naming him the representative of the Divinity in the flesh&mdash;and
  from what Croft had told me of his claiming while in Tamarizia to do all that
  he did by the grace of Zitu&mdash;which was, of course, no more than the
  truth in a sense&mdash;I could see how his very words might have laid the
  foundation for the high priest's act.</p>

  <p>Yet, Croft at our former conversation had said that he had induced the
  Tamarizians to adopt a republican way of government rather than their system
  of allied principalities, and had declared that when he went back he expected
  to be elected president. All that flashed through my mind, and then, "Rather
  changed your plans, I suppose," I said.</p>

  <p>"Changed them?" he returned, with an almost whimsical expression. "Murray,
  it almost wrecked them at the start&mdash;the most important part of them,
  that is. Remember why I did what I did do really&mdash;that all I had done up
  until that time was in order to win the woman who meant more to me than
  anything else in life&mdash;and then picture if you can my mental condition
  when I found myself trapped, as it were, by my own acts."</p>

  <p>"Your own?" I queried.</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Oh, certainly yes&mdash;my own, of course&mdash;my acts and my
  overthought&mdash;my failing to take into account what a terrible impression
  I had managed to make on the high priest. I&mdash;hang it all, Murray&mdash;I
  knew so entirely what I was up to that I didn't give proper consideration to
  the effect of my words and acts must have on less well-informed minds. I
  failed to put myself in the place of Zud, and Magur, the head of the church
  in Aphur, whom I first enlisted in my aid at Himyra, as I told you
  before.</p>

  <p>"You remember the old saying, 'Whom the gods wish to destroy they first
  make mad,' and one equally as true, that 'Pride goeth before a fall'? Well,
  my friend, I was a bit like that, I think, toward the last of the Zollarian
  war. Things came my way too fast. The completeness of the Tamarizian victory,
  and her father's pledge of the girl to me, backed up by the sanction of
  Jadgor, the Aphurian king, made me feel altogether secure.</p>

  <p>"It seemed to me that there could be no question but I carried the destiny
  of myself and Naia and all Tamarizia in my hands. I had only to speak to see
  my commands fulfilled.</p>

  <p>"Honestly, Murray, in those days I couldn't have been more absolute if I
  had been the Mouthpiece of Zitu indeed. Perhaps if I'd stayed there and
  rushed things through, everything would have been all right. But, as you
  know, I returned for a final visit to close up all matters pertaining to my
  earthly life before I snapped the astral cord which until then had kept my
  original body alive. And there was where I made my mistake.</p>

  <p>"As I've told you, I left my Palosian body in Zud's quarters, rather
  magnificently placed. Zud saw to that. I suppose now he was turning the
  elements of what he fancied the truth in his old brain. My form was stretched
  out on a golden couch, covered with a sheet of orange-colored silk, in the
  apartment set apart for my use. And I'd been planning, as you know, many
  things I wanted to do. I'd drawn plans&mdash;designs for things common enough
  on earth, but never before dreamed of on Palos. And I left the drawings I had
  made in that room in a golden chest. You remember I told you gold was as
  plentiful on Palos as iron on earth and used as freely in the metal-working
  arts.</p>

  <p>"Night and day a guard was kept in the chamber where I lay in what they
  believed was my knowledge-gaining sleep. But&mdash;the guard was a priest. He
  would do anything Zud said, of course. I never thought of that. I was anxious
  only to get back here and close things up and return and claim Naia as my
  wife.</p>

  <p>"So you see I fell into the error of not considering old Zud's thoughts or
  his interpretation of my claim that everything I did was by Zitu's grace. Of
  course that was plain enough, however, after I got back and found that he had
  all along placed a literal interpretation on my remarks and considered my
  sleeps as no more than a period of spiritual communion with Zitu himself.
  Then it became very forcibly clear to me that I should have taken Zud more
  fully into the truth of the facts. And because I hadn't I found myself in a
  most embarrassing case.</p>

  <p>"The high priest had got into that golden box. He had examined my
  working-charts. He had dimly sensed them as designs for things I meant to
  make&mdash;and his wonder knew no bounds. And after that he played the deuce,
  though I am convinced the old man only thought he was doing what was
  absolutely right, according to his lights."</p>

  <p>"And Naia?" I asked. "How did she view your elevation to such a lofty
  state?"</p>

  <p>Croft gave me a glance. "I told you Zud messed everything up," he replied.
  "But&mdash;it's a long story. Murray, this ramshackle carcass I've seized
  won't last out a great many days. The weakling soul who once possessed it
  broke it down by every sort of abuse, including drugs. But, I've got to learn
  certain things before I abandon its use.</p>

  <p>"Suppose you send me up the latest works you have on internal medicine and
  surgery and therapeutics, and drop in tonight. If you're willing to sacrifice
  a few hours' sleep, I'll spin you the whole yarn."</p>

  <p>"All right," I agreed as I rose. "I don't think I was ever more startled
  in my life, but I'll send up the books, and I'll be right here after nine
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Right," he accepted. "My physicians wouldn't let me have tobacco, though
  this body craves it. Bring some cigars when you come, and we'll have a good
  long talk."</p>

  <p>Before, however, I enter upon Croft's actual story, I think it better
  perhaps to briefly describe, in some part at least, those details of the
  Palosian world with which he had put me in touch on the occasion of our
  former meeting to which I have already referred.</p>

  <p>And toward a fuller understanding of that world itself, I think it best to
  take up the geography of that part of Palos Croft visited first. Mainly that
  which has to do with the Tamarizian nation&mdash;a series of allied
  principalities surrounding the shores of a vast inland sea, with the
  exception of a central state&mdash;the seat of the imperial capital,
  embracing the island of Hiranur, located in the sea itself, and the kingdom
  of Nodhur to the west and south.</p>

  <p>From the central sea a narrow strait led west toward an outer ocean beyond
  the continent on which the several principalities found place. To the north
  of this strait, known as the Gateway, was Cathur, a mountainous country and
  the seat of the national university at its capital city Scira. East of Cathur
  was Mazhur, known at the time of Croft's arrival as the Lost State, since in
  a former war it had been wrested from the original Tamarizian group by the
  Zollarians, a hostile nation lying still farther north.</p>

  <p>East of Mazhur, and circling the central sea to the east, was Bithur, and
  Milidhur joined Bithur on the south. West of Milidhur was Aphur, completing
  the circle about the sea and terminating at the Gateway on the south. Nodhur
  lay south of Aphur, gaining an outlet to the central sea by means of the
  River Na. This river had carried commercial craft driven by sail and oar
  until Croft revolutionized transportation with alcohol-driven motors.</p>

  <p>North of Tamarizia lay Zollaria, inhabited by a far more warlike race of
  whites. Its government was a despotism organized on militaristic lines.
  Controlling the gateway to the west, Tamarizia had remained the master, even
  after the fall of Mazhur, still collecting toll from the Zollarian craft on
  her rivers, despite the foothold gained by her foeman on the northern
  coast.</p>

  <p>East of Zollaria and Tamarizia in the hinterland of the continent lay
  Mazzer, populated by an aboriginal people of a complexion distinctly blue.
  Due to an ancient conquest many of these people were now constituted as a
  working caste in Tamarizia.</p>

  <p>Each of these states was governed by an hereditary king.</p>

  <p>Croft, by defeating Zollaria, after his attainment of physical life on
  Palos, had brought Mazhur back. In fact, he had just completed that bit of
  work at the time of our former conversation, thereby raising himself to a
  very high position of influence and power, as I have sought to indicate, and
  winning from Naia's father, Prince Lakkon of Aphur, the promise of his
  daughter's hand, as well as the consent of Jagdor, King of</p>

  <p>Aphur, and Naia's uncle, that the union should take place.</p>

  <p>On Croft's advent Scythys&mdash;a man old to dotage&mdash;had been king of
  Cathur, with Kyphallos the crown prince, a profligate of the worst type, for
  a son. Yet Jadgor of Aphur, scenting a danger unless it was checked in
  advance in Kyphallos's ascent of the Cathurian throne, had sought to bind the
  northern prince to the Tamarizian fealty more surely by offering him Naia,
  his sister's child, to wife.</p>

  <p>Kyphallos had, however, sunk under the enchantments of Kalamita, a
  Zollarian adventuress of great beauty, until he had reached the stage of
  plotted treason, planning to surrender Cathur to Zollaria in return for being
  given the throne of Tamarizia with Kalamita at his side.</p>

  <p>To win Naia for himself, and overthrow Zollaria's designs against the
  southern nation had been Croft's main work, toward which he strained every
  nerve. Besides his development of the motor on Palos he introduced firearms
  as well, placed them in the hands of the Tamarizian soldiery until then armed
  with spears, swords, bows and arrows and shields, and defeated the flower of
  the Zollarian hosts on a couple of bloody fields. The victory complete and
  Zollaria not only defeated but forced to cede Mazhur after a tenure of fifty
  years, and it being the end of the Emperor Tamhys's reign, he had prevailed
  upon the nation to adopt a democratic form.</p>

  <p>And now a word as to the Tamarizians themselves. They were a white and
  well-formed race. In their social structure women held an equal place with
  men. I have hinted at their religion. They believed in the spirit and a
  future life and the resurrection of the dead. In the sciences and arts they
  had made considerable progress.</p>

  <p>The clothing of the women consisted of a single garment, falling to the
  knees or just below them, cinctured about the body, caught over one shoulder
  by a metal or jeweled boss, and leaving the other shoulder and arm exposed.
  To this was added sandals of leather, metal, or wood, held to the foot by a
  toe- and-instep band and lacings running well up the calves. Men of wealth
  and caste and soldiers and nobles, instead of these sandals, generally wore
  metal casings, which amounted to a sandal and leg piece jointed to allow the
  ankle full play and reaching newly to the knees.</p>

  <p>The men of caste also wore a soft shirt or chemise beneath a metal cuirass
  or an embroidered tunic, as the case might be. Save on formal occasions, the
  serving classes, men and women, wore either a narrow cincture about the
  loins, supporting a small phallary or apron, or went nude about their
  tasks.</p>

  <p>Agriculture was highly developed, and as a people they had advanced far in
  architecture, painting, sculpture, and similar arts. They lavished much time
  and expense in beautifying their houses&mdash;making of each a small palace,
  if the owner were rich.</p>

  <p>The highways along which the sarpelca caravans and the gnuppa-drawn
  carriages and chariots passed were models of engineering.</p>

  <p>[The gnuppa is a creature seemingly half deer and half horse. The sarpelca
  is not unlike some weird Silurian lizard, twice the size of an elephant, with
  a pointed tail, a scale-armored back, a long neck somewhat resembling that of
  a camel, and the head of a marine serpent having a series of fleshy tentacles
  about the mouth. They are driven by reins affixed to these latter appendages,
  and stream across the Palosian deserts bearing merchandise upon their
  enormous backs.]</p>

  <p>All these things I knew from Croft's previous talks. He had told me he
  could go to Palos as quickly as I could think of it myself, and here I was
  anticipating a resumption that night of his story concerning beings I had
  never seen, with an eagerness amounting to impatience of the dragging
  hours.</p>

  <p>Here was I thinking of Naia&mdash;the golden-haired, purple-eyed beauty
  of Aphur; of Lakkon, her father; of Jadgor, her uncle; of Robur, her cousin,
  the Aphurian crown prince and Croft's loyal co-worker and friend; of the
  sweet and matronly Gaya, his wife; of Magur, Zud's deputy in Himyra; of Zud
  himself and others, as one thinks of people well known&mdash;actually
  visualizing them before my mental eye according to Croft's
  description&mdash;portraying their thoughts and acts and feelings to myself,
  as I might with any man or woman on earth.</p>

  <p>And to me in that moment Naia&mdash;glorious in her purity and youth,
  waiting for her mate in the quarters of Ga&mdash;the virgin&mdash;where
  burned the never-dying fires of life, on the altar before Ga's feet&mdash;was
  far more clear in her seeming than a million mundane women, despite the
  billions of miles between her and my present physical estate.</p>

  <p>Billions of miles. My mind bridged it in thought.</p>

  <p>And Croft had bridged it in spirit at first, until at last he had learned
  how to cross the bridge and gain a life in the flesh&mdash;because the lure
  of the woman had nerved him to that test. The thing thrilled me, fired every
  element within me capable of responding to the stimulus of romance. Sane or
  insane, true or untrue, I wanted to hear the rest of the story.</p>

  <p>Only remember&mdash;that if it wasn't Croft, his spirit&mdash;indwelling
  in the new patient's miserable wreck of a body&mdash;how would he have known
  the elements of the former story he had already mentioned&mdash;been able to
  pick it up where he left it off, and preface what he had promised to tell me,
  with his account of the actions of the Tamarizian high priest? That argument
  alone seemed enough to remove the last shreds of unbelief. Consequently I
  felt that when I entered my patient's room that evening, it would be to hear
  not so much a story as a narrative of life.</p>

  <p>And at that I was to be amazed by what had happened to Jason Croft.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III. &mdash; HARNESSED TO HEAVEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MEANWHILE I sent him the books he had said he wanted,
  together with a box of good cigars. And along about eight forty-five, when I
  had finished my evening round of patients, I went up myself.</p>

  <p>I lighted up a cigar and took a chair, tacitly preparing for a stay of
  some considerable time, and then as Croft continued to smoke in an almost
  meditative silence, I opened the matter myself:</p>

  <p>"Even supposing that Zud did get at your plans, I hardly see why he should
  have taken the step he did before your return."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. "It wasn't only the plans," he said. "You must recall Abbu,
  the priest of the pyramid at Scira&mdash;the one who was present when I
  entered Jasor's body and made it my own&mdash;who administered the last rites
  of his church to the dying Jasor, and with whom I talked after I had
  succeeded in compelling the Nodhurian's form to obey my will.</p>

  <p>"I told you that to Abbu I had acknowledged that my spirit was not
  Jasor's, but that what I was about to do was for Tamarizia's good, thereby
  enlisting his aid in my undertakings&mdash;also how he acted as an instrument
  in saving Naia from becoming a victim of the plan Cathur's crown prince and
  his Zollarian co-plotters had so cunningly laid.</p>

  <p>"At the time I swore him to secrecy, of course, and I honestly believe
  that up until the time I left Jasor's body for the purpose of making a final
  trip to earth, he was the only man who knew that the spirit within it was not
  the same as the one it had held at birth. "But"&mdash;a smile flicked across
  his lips&mdash;"just as on my first excursion to Palos I made an error and
  nearly precipitated myself into the fiery heart of Sirius, so I seem to have
  overlooked the human equation which holds on Palos no less than
  earth&mdash;and I overlooked also the fact that Zud was the high priest.</p>

  <p>"Abbu, after the war with Zollaria, had been brought to Zitra and raised
  to a higher rank, because of his part in first assisting me. Naturally Zud
  was acquainted with all such facts, and one can hardly blame him for wanting
  to know more in view of what I can well understand were the tremendous
  changes I had brought about in Tamarizia's affairs.</p>

  <p>"To me motors and firearms were nothing save things of everyday
  experience, and what I had made on Palos seemed but as crude devices at the
  best. But to Zud and all others they appeared little short of the miraculous,
  upsetting all former conceptions of their lives. Take that into consideration
  and then picture the impression on his mind likely to be made by the fact
  that by my own admission I was not the same Jasor of Nodhur who, according to
  the physician attending him in Scira, had there died."</p>

  <p>I began to understand what must have happened."</p>

  <p>"He pumped Abbu?" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Exactly." Croft smiled dryly again. "He absolved him from his oath and
  learned all the facts with which Abbu was acquainted. You can easily
  understand the rest. Jasor of Nodhur dies. His body comes back to life. Its
  lips speak to Abbu, the priest. He hears that a new spirit inhabits Jasor's
  body. Immediately after strange things&mdash;but things aimed wholly for
  Tamarizia's good&mdash;begin to happen.</p>

  <p>"Shall the dead live again, save by divine intervention? Shall
  undreamed-of things appear save by Zitu's grace? And if in addition the
  revivified body shall fall into strange sleeps at times and upon waking seem
  possessed of a supernatural knowledge, what more natural to the
  priest&mdash;unendowed with a full understanding of what was taking place,
  unaware that the things that excited his unlimited amazement were but copies
  of things existing on another planet&mdash;than to consider that those things
  he witnessed were the result of divine ordination and to regard the
  individual who brought them about as the mouthpiece of his god in the flesh?
  Oh, frankly, Murray, I don't blame that puzzled old man in the least. As a
  matter of fact, I blame myself for not having foreseen the effect of all that
  had happened on his brain."</p>

  <p>Croft put out a hand and selected a fresh cigar. He set it alight and got
  it to going nicely while, as it seemed to me, he marshaled his thoughts. And
  then&mdash;all at once he began speaking again, and this is the story he
  told.</p>

  <p>THE Palosian day&mdash;or "sun"&mdash;is twenty-seven hours long. Dawn was
  on the verge of breaking when Croft, having body, opened Jasor of Nodhur's
  physical eyes in the room of the Zitran pyramid. And because now he had taken
  the last step which so nearly as possible must make him a Palosian indeed,
  and nothing held him longer on any other sphere, he opened his eyes in a
  flash.</p>

  <p>One moment the body he had taken when Jasor laid it down was stretched an
  inanimate object on the golden couch beneath its smooth coverlet of orange
  silk. The next moment it was the living, breathing figure of a
  perfectly-proportioned man, blinking its newly opened eyes.</p>

  <p>A slightly unsteady radiance of a yellow color filled the room. It came
  from the blazing wicks in oil-filled sconces fixed about the walls, as Croft
  knew. He lay and sensed it briefly, while the tide of awakening life flowed
  in a tingling stream through his powerful body and limbs. And then he turned
  his head.</p>

  <p>His glance fell upon one of the lay brothers of the priesthood, clad in a
  brown robe, from which peeped his toe-splayed, naked feet. He sat on a stool
  of molded copper, with down bent head. He appeared to be asleep. But suddenly
  as though aroused by Croft's slight movement, he jerked to attention and
  encountered the sleeper's eyes. Instantly he sprang erect, approaching with a
  soft, quick shuffle and pausing by the golden bed.</p>

  <p>"My lord&mdash;my lord!" he stammered in little more than a husky whisper,
  and sank upon his knees. His back bent, his head inclined until its face was
  hidden. His arms rose, and as Croft watched he made the sign of the
  Tamarizian priesthood&mdash;a horizontal cross.</p>

  <p>Croft lifted himself to a sitting posture on the couch, shoving the
  coverings back until his shoulders and torso gleamed white with a ripple of
  muscles beneath the yellow light. Frankly he was perplexed. Knighthood he had
  gained. He was a Huporor Prince of Aphur by Jadgor's accolade. It was well
  enough for the brother to call him "lord." He was a powerful man in all the
  nation, but&mdash;never had he before encountered the bent knee of a
  priest&mdash;and since the guardian of his chamber must have known what to
  expect, he hardly thought the man's act attributable to fright.</p>

  <p>"Come! What's the meaning of this?" he demanded. "Since you were placed to
  attend my wakening, why do you kneel?"</p>

  <p>The man lifted his face&mdash;it was white&mdash;even beyond the priestly
  pallor&mdash;and his eyes were wide.</p>

  <p>"Because," he said slowly, in almost timorous fashion, "all men bend the
  knee to the Mouthpiece of Zitu&mdash;even Zud himself."</p>

  <p>The whole thing burst on Croft just like that, without warning, without
  any premonitory sign to prepare him for his changed estate. And then, with a
  wildly whirling brain as he realized the far-reaching consequences hinted at
  by the priest's announcement, he found himself forced to accept the
  conclusion that the Mouthpiece of Zitu could be none other than himself. At
  first the thought startled him, disturbed him, appalled, and in swift
  succession it excited an almost resentful rage.</p>

  <p>Those things were instinctive wholly, then as the brain, once more in the
  grasp of his will, began to functionate more fully, he decided that something
  unforeseen must have transpired while he lay here entranced, and resolved in
  a flash that the first step essential to a fuller information lay in an
  interview with Zud at once.</p>

  <p>"Get up," he said to the priest.</p>

  <p>"Yes, lord."</p>

  <p>The brother rose.</p>

  <p>"Give me my garments." Croft kicked the silken sheet completely off and
  stood upon his feet.</p>

  <p>"At once." The brother shuffled toward a chest in a corner of the
  apartment, lifted the lid and produced a robe. Blue it was&mdash;the color of
  the highest order of the priesthood&mdash;embroidered on the breast in stones
  like drops of transparent gold. The brother brought it back, outspread across
  his forearms, and Croft caught sight of the design&mdash;the wings of Azil,
  flaring out from the stem of a cross, looped in its upper segment&mdash;the
  cross ansata&mdash;the Palosian symbol of immortal life. Then as the brother
  once more sank to his knees, holding the garment toward him, he controlled
  his surprise and asked a question:</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this?"</p>

  <p>When he had called for his garments he had expected his leg-casings of
  gold, gem-studded, his shirt of soft fiber, and his metal cuirass whereon
  blazed Aphru's sign of the sun, his sword with its jewel-incrusted hilt and
  belt, and his helmet with its orange plumes.</p>

  <p>But the kneeling brother answered: "It is as Zud hath decreed."</p>

  <p>Zud&mdash;Zud&mdash;Zud. It seemed to Croft that Zud had, all unknown to
  him, been taking a very large part in his affairs. For an instant he had the
  distinct sensation of having in some way, he hardly knew how, been trapped.
  But it only hardened his determination to see the high priest at once and
  learn what had been going on in Zitra during the past two weeks. He took the
  robe from the brother's extended arms and slipped it on, fastening the
  shoulder-boss, and seated himself while his companion laced a pair of
  blue-and-gold leather sandals on his feet.</p>

  <p>"Go now," he directed, once the latter task was completed. "Say to Zud
  that with him I would have speech."</p>

  <p>"I go. It was ordered that I report thy awakening, O Mouth&mdash;" the
  priest began as he backed toward the door.</p>

  <p>Croft cut him short almost sharply. He lifted an arm in a sudden pointing
  gesture: "Go!"</p>

  <p>The Mouthpiece of Zitu! He sat almost tensely on the edge of the couch.
  What in the name of Zitu did the brother mean, and what had Zud been up to?
  Why was he tricked out in this priestly robe with the wings of the Angel of
  Life, the loop of the Cross of Life on his breast? And what would be the
  effect of the thing on all he had planned himself?</p>

  <p>Naia! The thought stabbed him like a knife. He lifted his eyes toward the
  ceiling of the room. Up there&mdash;high above him&mdash;in the quarters of
  the Gayana, the vestals&mdash;where burned in the shrine of Ga the
  never-dying fire of life&mdash;up there she was waiting for him to come
  back&mdash;waiting to become his bride&mdash;his mate&mdash;his complement
  and counterpart&mdash;for the fulfilment of their mutual love&mdash;that love
  which, like a lode-stone, had drawn him here in the first place&mdash;to win
  which he had done all else.</p>

  <p>What would be the effect of whatever it was Zud had done in his absence,
  on the maid herself?</p>

  <p>It behooved him to master his startled nerves and get himself into a
  proper mind to dominate the coming interview with Zud. By deliberate effort,
  then, he forced himself back to a state of mental control. He decided to
  watch the high priest closely and learn, if he might, whether the man were
  sincere in the motives for his action or had been actuated thereto by
  personal or political desires. He relaxed the tension of his body and waited
  for Zud to appear, as he presently did.</p>

  <p>He came in, an old man with graying hair, clad in an azure blue robe with
  the cross ansata embroidered in flame-colored jewels upon the breast. He
  advanced directly toward Croft as the latter rose, and some three paces
  before him sank slowly to his knees.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast called, and thy servant appears, O Mouthpiece of Zitu," he said
  slowly in a tone of what might be reverence. "Long were we in recognizing the
  truth, yet was the fault not entirely our own, since only to Abbu of Scira
  had you voiced it, and not since Azil himself descended to teach the sons of
  mortals has such a thing occurred, nor in Zitu's wisdom was thy coming
  revealed."</p>

  <p>In a flash Croft began to understand. The mention of Abbu's name was
  enough to give him the clue. He recalled his first conversation on Palos with
  the Cathurian priest, and the tangle began to clear.</p>

  <p>"Thou thinkest me the Mouthpiece of Zitu, then, indeed?" he questioned the
  high priest, and watched him closely.</p>

  <p>"Aye, by Zitu! the one source of life and knowledge," Zud replied. "Did
  not Abbu state that you told him thy spirit was not that of Jasor of Nodhur,
  who was dead, yet whose body having died, became once more alive, and hast
  thou not said that all you did was by Zitu's grace? Didst not tell me that
  those things you commanded to be made for Tamarizia's good (were shown to you
  in your sleeps? Can the spirit of a mortal enter and leave the body at
  will&mdash;the spirit of one such as Jasor was&mdash;and"&mdash;seemingly Zud
  was forgetful of all discretion in this meeting&mdash;"have I not seen the
  paintings of the things you plan yet to bring to Tamarizia in yonder casket?"
  He turned his eyes toward the golden box where Croft had left his
  designs.</p>

  <p>Croft considered swiftly. Sincerity rang in the man's tones, and more and
  more, as he ran on, Croft understood. He decided quickly on another test. Zud
  had raised his eyes as he finished his answer, and Croft looked steadily into
  his face.</p>

  <p>"You opened the casket?" he demanded in a louder, an accusatory voice.
  "You dared much, priest of Zitu. What things are to be will be in the time of
  Zitu's choosing. It is a brave man dares to know all things in advance."</p>

  <p>Zud's expression changed. Before it had been one of an almost wide-eyed
  respect. Now it became an ashen thing of horror, of unmistakable dismay.</p>

  <p>"My lord&mdash;my lord," he faltered, "I but sought to learn the truth. I
  swear by Zitu that my heart was clean in what I have done
  and&mdash;said."</p>

  <p>There was an odd break in his utterance just before the final word. It was
  as though the man were appalled at the palpable displeasure of the one before
  whom he knelt, yet, despite of any consequences to himself, were determined
  to confess.</p>

  <p>And Croft noted his manner of speaking, and caught up that last word:
  "Said? You have said what, Zud?"</p>

  <p>"That thou wert the Mouthpiece of Zitu&mdash;sent into the flesh for
  Tamarizia's good."</p>

  <p>"To whom have these things been spoken?" Croft queried with a caught-in
  breath, sensing the calamity which had overtaken his own plans as great as it
  possibly could be, if things were as they now appeared.</p>

  <p>"To all Tamarizia have I, as high priest, proclaimed it," said Zud. "Zitra
  but waits your awakening, that it may behold and proclaim you in the body you
  have chosen as your servant, and give ear to your words."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV. &mdash; MAN OR MOUTH?</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE thing was cut and dried. Even a public appearance was,
  it would seem, arranged. The church of the nation had given him forth as a
  spirit divinely sent as a teacher, gaining physical expression through the
  body of Jasor of Nodhur. And&mdash;what was Croft to do? To disclaim&mdash;to
  compel Zud to retract&mdash;would strike, as he knew, not only at his own
  powers of future accomplishment, discredit him as it were, but would aim a
  blow at the very foundation of the social structure, if Zud were shown to
  have made so terrible an error as he had. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;to
  accept&mdash;to go on&mdash;to pose as what he was not. The thought was
  distasteful, and worse, since to go on might mean the loss of Naia, as well
  as that position he had expected to hold in the newly organized republic of
  Tamarizian states.</p>

  <p>For the political end of the matter he cared very little to tell the
  truth, but even the thought of Naia sent a quiver throughout his
  body&mdash;caused a sudden dizzy whirling of his brain. Once more he felt
  baffled, trapped, enraged. And so far as any escape from the situation he
  confronted was concerned, he could see no possible way out.</p>

  <p>For a moment a wild impulse to seize the kneeling man at his feet, lift
  him up and shake him, hurl against him a scorching torrent of passion-urged
  words for his curious meddling, assailed him. But he choked it and stood as
  one who considers, and when he spoke his words were once more calm:</p>

  <p>"Enough. What things Zitu wills, those things shall be done. Yet have I a
  body, as thou seest, that has lain unnourished full long. Rise, Zud of Zitra.
  Command me food. I would eat while we talk."</p>

  <p>"Even now it waits."</p>

  <p>Zud rose and went backward toward the door. He set it open. As Croft
  seated himself once more on his couch there filed in a group of brothers, the
  foremost bearing a shortlegged table of molded copper, the others dishes and
  flagons in their hands.</p>

  <p>The dishes were of gold and silver. There were goblets of glass which the
  Tamarizians made of magnificent quality and design. One of the latter was
  placed before Croft and filled with a mild and blood-red wine. Their service
  ended the lay brothers bent in genuflexion and retired. Zud remained standing
  in watchful silence until Croft bade him be seated, when he drew up a stool
  and sat down.</p>

  <p>While he ate Croft plunged into a series of questions concerning affairs
  in the Tamarizian states.</p>

  <p>"The reign of Tamhys will terminate in fourteen suns (days)?"</p>

  <p>"Aye."</p>

  <p>"Thereafter we shall adopt the new government as it was decided, the
  elections being held as in the choice of the former assemblies in each
  kingdom&mdash;each decktaron to elect a representative, by whose vote shall
  be the choice of president?"</p>

  <p>"Aye." Zud inclined his head. "So has it been proclaimed."</p>

  <p>"What candidates have been selected?"</p>

  <p>"Jadgor of Aphur, and Tammon, Tamhys's son."</p>

  <p>Croft considered the names as he sipped his wine. Jadgor, he knew, had,
  before the Zollarian war, had an eye on the Zitran throne&mdash;had hoped to
  mount it, and strengthen the entire nation by a change of that policy of
  pacifism which, by its continuation for something like fifty years, made
  Tamarizia weak, despite the wonderful resources in wealth and men which were
  hers&mdash;which would seemingly have led to her overthrow through Zollaria's
  arms and Cathur's defection, had not Croft appeared.</p>

  <p>So it was not at all surprising, in view of his popularity not only in
  Aphur, but in Nodhur and Milidhur as well, and because of his prominent part
  in the war, that he should have been chosen as a candidate for the nation's
  first president. Nor for that matter was it to be questioned that the
  retiring occupant of the throne should have put up his eldest son. Of course,
  Croft had expected to enter the field himself, but now he brushed the point
  aside.</p>

  <p>"It is well," he gave his decision and set down his glass. "And the
  governors of the states?"</p>

  <p>Zud mentioned a list of names covering each former kingdom.</p>

  <p>"In Aphur Robur, Jadgor's son alone. There is no other, because of his
  part with you in all that has been done. In Cathur, Mutlos, a man of the
  people, and Koryphon, Scythys's second son, who ascended the throne, as you
  know, after Kyphallos fled and destroyed himself in Berla before Kalamita's
  eyes. As your directions were understood before the time of your, recent
  sleeping, in Hiranur the president controls also the state affairs."</p>

  <p>"Aye," Croft agreed. His heart had warmed at the announcement that Robur
  stood for election in Aphur alone. Of all its people he had known, save Naia
  only, he had come to love Robur best, had found him a true friend, a man of
  broad and intelligent mind, under each and every test. By Jadgor's own edict
  Robur had been his main assistant and lieutenant in all that he had done. He
  felt very much toward him as he might toward a younger brother. He had even
  discussed those periods when his body lay unconscious with the Aphurian crown
  prince in so far as he could, and there had been a time when the only
  confidante of his love for Naia had been Gaya, Robur's wife. Suddenly he felt
  that in these two he might find once more true friends and allies in the
  situation in which he found himself.</p>

  <p>"And where is Robur?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"In Zitra, lord. He and Lakkon and Jadgor desire speech with thee so soon
  as thou shalt have waked."</p>

  <p>A quiver of comprehension stirred in Croft's breast. The desire of Lakkon
  and Jadgor for an interview with himself he could understand. The former it
  was who had pledged his daughter to the Hupor Jasor, as he was then known, as
  wife. And Jadgor had approved of the pact. It was but natural that now they
  should wish some explanation at least, some understanding as to the girl's
  position, in view of Zud's most extraordinary proclamation. He threw up his
  head and stared the high priest in the eyes, and found them a trifle
  uncertain, his whole expression more or less puzzled, even somewhat
  abashed.</p>

  <p>"What troubles you, Zud?" he inquired with the feeling that the man knew
  what it was really that Lakkon and Jadgor desired.</p>

  <p>And for a moment Zud made no answer; for a moment he seemed to study
  Croft's face before he began in apologetic fashion: "What I have done I have
  done for the best, as I now call Zitu to witness; yet are there some things I
  do not understand."</p>

  <p>"You refer to the maiden Naia, who by your permission was taken into the
  quarters of the Gayana?" An opening&mdash;an advantage appeared to Croft's
  mind in a flash.</p>

  <p>And plainly his question disturbed Zud more than a little.</p>

  <p>"Aye," he said scarcely above a whisper at length and inclined his
  head.</p>

  <p>"To whom ere I slept, by consent of her father and Jadgor, I was
  pledged?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, lord. Jadgor and Lakkon also ask themselves&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why the Mouthpiece of Zitu should seek a union in the flesh?"</p>

  <p>Zud clasped his hands before him. He sat with eyes downcast. By an effort,
  at length he once more lifted his face. "Thou hast spoken, lord," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Croft held him with a level regard. "And what says Zud, the high
  priest?"</p>

  <p>"That the ways of Zitu are beyond mortal understanding," Zud responded
  slowly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Croft took him up sharply. "Zud, the high priest, endeavored to
  understand&mdash;toward which end, though Abbu of Scira had sworn by Zitu to
  keep silent, he induced him to talk."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;lord, I absolved him of the oath of silence," Zud
  faltered, and began a nervous twisting of his interlacing fingers.</p>

  <p>"And since when may even the high priest rescind that which Zitu has
  recorded?"</p>

  <p>A tremor shook the priest. A twitching seized his face. He shrank back and
  sat staring, staring at the strange individual before him, with whose affairs
  he had dared to interfere, who now arraigned him with a face and manner gone
  well-nigh impersonally cold. One could no longer doubt that he had been
  sincere in what he had done, at least&mdash;what he had proclaimed of Croft,
  he himself believed. Of so much Croft felt convinced as he once more
  spoke:</p>

  <p>"High priest of Zitu, in what words was your proclamation to Tamarizia
  concerning him until now known as the Hupor Jasor made?"</p>

  <p>Zud wet his lips and made answer. "It was said that Zitu had sent us a
  teacher&mdash;one who should reveal to all men his will, through whom he
  revealed his pleasure&mdash;one who was his mouthpiece indeed."</p>

  <p>"And this you believed?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, lord." Zud moved. He left the stool on which he was sitting. He
  would have knelt had not Croft stayed him:</p>

  <p>Hilka Hold!"</p>

  <p>"Aye, lord." Zud stood erect. His knees seemed knocking together, and he
  swayed. Something like pity stirred in Croft's breast. The man was
  overwrought, keyed to a vast tension, troubled in his mind, well-nigh
  dismayed. His confidence, born of years of unquestioned authority, was
  shaken; he appeared beaten down and crushed. And Croft was minded to maintain
  his advantage toward his individual ends. He spoke again: "Think you that as
  Zitu's Mouthpiece I shall find it easy to take my place as heretofore in the
  Himyra or Ladhra shops, where the instruments designed for Tamarizia's use
  shall be brought forth? Do men work best with one such as you would name, or
  with another man, O Zud?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, lord!" Zud bowed his head.</p>

  <p>"Or think you that were I the mouthpiece of Zitu, I would have pledged
  myself to this maid save by his will? Yet today even Zud bends the knee in my
  presence since his proclamation. Is this thing known to the Gayana as well as
  to the priests?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is known," Zud told him slowly.</p>

  <p>"The maid is still there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"She has heard the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Zud flung up his head. Croft's last word seemed to give him
  courage.</p>

  <p>"She knows&mdash;the truth," he said. "She requested an audience after she
  had heard, and I went to her. I told her those things Abbu said."</p>

  <p>"That my spirit was not Jasor's?" The words burst from Croft's lips in an
  instinctive exclamation. For an instant he felt his control once more
  slipping. Naia knew&mdash;that the body of the man to whom she was promised
  was the body of one who had died&mdash;that its life was due not to the
  presence of Jasor's spirit, but another. Zud had told her. He had told her
  the truth. Croft had meant to tell her before the marriage in so different a
  way from that in which the high priest must have explained. And&mdash;what
  must have been the effect of such an announcement upon her&mdash;what must
  she, could she think?</p>

  <p>"Yes." Zud's answer but served to accentuate and confirm the dilemma his
  meddling had produced.</p>

  <p>"And what said she?" Croft forced himself to ask.</p>

  <p>"She is a maiden of spirit," said Zud in the tone of one who palliates an
  offense. "She is unused to restraint. She refused to give credence to Abbu's
  story or accept its truth save from your own lips."</p>

  <p>Croft thrilled. Here was fidelity and trust&mdash;the absolute confidence
  which should exist between true mates. If Naia of Aphur had dared to refuse
  acceptance to the words of the high priest, she would dare much. Things might
  not turn out so badly as he had feared.</p>

  <p>There would seem to be time still for the true explanation he had meant to
  make to the girl herself. The purpose fired him to immediate
  determination.</p>

  <p>"She remains with the Gayana?"</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;until such time as you awaken."</p>

  <p>"I will see her. Send one to guide me to her at once."</p>

  <p>"Lord!" Zud's tone was aghast.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Croft cut short his incipient protest. "Would question my
  demands?"</p>

  <p>"But the Gayana&mdash;" Zud began a faltering explanation.</p>

  <p>His companion took a single step toward him. His jaw thrust out in an
  almost menacing manner, indicative of a will to brook no opposition: "May be
  entered by him who wears the wings of the Angel of Life as well as the high
  priest."</p>

  <p>For a long, breathless instant the glances of the two men met and crossed,
  engaging the one with the other. And then Zud was beaten down. He
  yielded.</p>

  <p>"Permit that I show you," he said, and led the way.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">V. &mdash; BEHIND THE SILVER DOOR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THEY passed from the room and along a corridor in which the
  oil sconces had now been extinguished, faintly illuminated by the light of
  the new day. Before a massive door Zud paused and set his hand to a slender
  cord. His action was followed by the muffled clanging of a brazen gong. He
  slid the door open and revealed the shadow-wrapped throat of a shaft, up
  which a platform presently trembled into view. It was a primitive form of
  elevator operated, as Croft knew, by a Mazzerian crew in the foundations of
  the pyramid itself, lifting and lowering it on signal, by winding its cable
  on and off a revolving drum.</p>

  <p>With Zud, he stepped aboard. The platform mounted slowly up the shaft. The
  high priest, with a hand on an inner cord, observed its progress, and
  presently once more the gong far below clanged out. The platform stopped.</p>

  <p>They stepped into a very short corridor between masonry walls of a cut and
  polished stone not unlike marble, save that it held a strange, translucent
  quality in its substance and was wholly white.</p>

  <p>The main staircase of the pyramid mounted before them and ran on toward
  the top, with its crowning Temple of Zitu, and just beyond it, at the far end
  of the corridor, was a door. Silver it was, the most precious of Palosian
  metals, tooled and carved into the design of a full-sized woman's figure, in
  whose hand was the looped cross of immortal life.</p>

  <p>Croft thrilled as they paused before it. This was the entrance to the
  quarters of the Gayana. Here it was that Naia had waited for him when he
  plunged into the venture of the Zollarian war. Then briefly he had held her
  in his arms, and she had told him that none should claim her ever save
  himself, or, failing that, she would remain forever virgin in the sanctuary
  of Ga beyond this door outside which now he stood so very, very differently
  from what he had once thought that he should.</p>

  <p>And suddenly the knowledge of what Zud had told her&mdash;of the shock of
  revelation that must have come upon her, the torment to her every finer
  sensibility and feeling&mdash;caused an actual sensation of constriction in
  Croft's chest. He stood with tight-set lips and flaring nostrils as Zud put
  up a hand and pressed against the left breast of the woman on the door.</p>

  <p>There was a tiny click, and the door slid to one side, disappearing into a
  socket in the wall and flooding the corridor with light. No gloomy abode was
  that in which the vestals dwelt. High up on the pyramid, but one flight
  beneath the crowning temple on the truncated apex, it caught the first of
  Sirius's rays, and the last, through deep embrasures set with slanting glass
  in the structure's walls. As the door slipped aside a scene was presented to
  Croft's eyes, brilliant with light and life.</p>

  <p>"Hold!" he said as Zud would have entered and stepped past him on one
  side.</p>

  <p>"Wait for me below in your own apartments, man of Zitu. Consider meanwhile
  those words we have spoken before you brought me here. Peace be with you,
  priest of Zitu. Go!"</p>

  <p>Then, as Zud turned to do his bidding and regained the platform in the
  shaft, he stepped through the aperture of the door to the other side and
  paused, a trifle abashed.</p>

  <p>He had come at a stride to a region of youth and beauty. It surrounded him
  on every side. Feminine forms in diaphanous fabrics were grouped about the
  room. The chatter of their voices filled the place. Directly before him a
  group of maidens already at work about an immense basket of flowers, forming
  the garlands and sprays which at the noontide hour of prayer they would fling
  at the feet of the statue of Tamarizia's god, paused and stood staring as
  Croft appeared.</p>

  <p>Their hair, unrestrained save for a metal filet or cincture, fell in
  masses down their graceful backs. The flesh of their shoulders and arms and
  sandalless feet, glowed warm and pinkly white. Their lips grew parted, and
  their eyes, unaccustomed to masculine presence, save possibly that of old
  Zud, grew wide. For Croft was no ancient as he stood there in his azure robe,
  with the cross and the wings in gold upon his breast and his yellow hair in a
  tawny mass upon his head. More he was like some young and comely god himself,
  with his bold, strong features, his hint of latent strength.</p>

  <p>So for a moment they stood staring until, as though her attention was
  arrested by their postures and the direction of their glances, an older woman
  appeared, coming directly toward where Croft stood, to pause before him and
  bend in a genuflection, and inquire with a voice leveled, as it seemed, by
  repression: "What does my lord of Zitu seek?"</p>

  <p>"Speech with the maiden Naia, priestess of Ga." Croft met her glance
  directly.</p>

  <p>"So be it," said the woman. "Come with me."</p>

  <p>He followed&mdash;across a hugely pillared room where others of the
  vestals sat on cushions or divans, engaged in simple tasks&mdash;toward a
  mighty figure of a woman, carved from the strangely beautiful translucent
  stone the Tamarizians used mainly in their sculpture&mdash;the figure of a
  woman seated, brooding with a face of divinely maternal affection above the
  form of a babe stretched prone across her knees. Mighty, magnificent in her
  womanhood, beautiful in her maternity, she sat there, back of a silver altar
  on which leaped from an oil-fed sconce the eternal flame of life which never
  died.</p>

  <p>And this he thought was Ga, to whom Naia of Aphur had prayed that she
  might be spared the unclean ordeal of a marriage with Cathur's prince. This
  was the eternal woman, the eternal mother, the eternal source&mdash;the
  Tamarizian virgin who had given birth to Azil, the Angel of Life.
  Ga&mdash;the virgin, the Madonna. This was the woman and&mdash;her
  child&mdash;woman the shrine of the fire eternal, watching it, guarding it,
  replenishing it against extinction through the eons of ages with, in and from
  herself.</p>

  <p>A sudden passionate desire to do her and the members of her sex some form
  of honor seized him in an impulse which sent him without premeditation to his
  knees, bending before her majestic presence, forming the sign of the cross
  horizontal, beneath her brooding features; glancing up then, and then only,
  to meet the eyes of his guide&mdash;and find them less frigid, in a subtle
  manner pleased.</p>

  <p>But she made no comment as Croft rose slowly and once more followed her
  lead toward the door of a room, which she unlatched and pushed aside.</p>

  <p>Through the opening Croft's eyes leaped, to fall upon the figure of a
  woman, her hair as golden as the sunshine falling in a rippling, silken mass
  to the couch of wine-red wood on which she sat, her head bent above a frame
  in which her tapering fingers were embroidering a pattern in small, pierced
  jewels on a fabric of sheerest gauze.</p>

  <p>All that in a flash. Then, as though attracted by the opening of the door,
  the woman glanced up, lifting a pair of pansy-purple eyes.</p>

  <p>"Naia!" Croft's lips framed the word rather than spoke it. He stepped
  swiftly toward her through the door. It clicked shut behind him as the vestal
  closed it.</p>

  <p>Naia, of Aphur, rose. The last vestige of color seemed drained from her
  face, leaving her eyes very dark in its pallor, their pupils stretched
  wondrously wide. So for a moment, she stood staring straight before her at
  him she had known as Jasor of Nodhur, before her body took on a sudden
  panting, so that the tissues of the temple garment she was wearing became no
  more than a creamy ripple above her firmly rounded busts. And then while
  Croft waited, choked by his own emotions, drunk in his innermost being with
  her beauty, she moved and sank down on her slender, supple knees.</p>

  <p>"Beloved!" Croft went one swift pace toward her. He stretched out his
  hands. "Naia&mdash;mine own&mdash;arise."</p>

  <p>She glanced up. A quiver shook the perfect curve of her mouth. And then
  for the first time her lips writhed open. "How speaks the Mouthpiece of Zitu
  in a lover's guise?"</p>

  <p>"Arise," repeated Croft, and waiting until she had once more regained her
  feet before he went on: "Were I to answer your question, beloved, would any
  hear?"</p>

  <p>She regarded him strangely. It was almost as though she sensed some new,
  some unsuspected meaning in his words, some hint of something of which she
  had not dreamed, yet which, now that her intuition gave it seeming, she
  desired to have made plain.</p>

  <p>"No," she made answer slowly. "This is my own apartment&mdash;set aside
  for my use for such time as I remain with the Gayana. What things may be said
  within it shall remain unknown."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;" In a single stride Croft approached her. He swept her into
  his arms. They closed about her with an almost yearning gesture. He drew her
  to him, held her against his breast. The warmth of her, the glorious
  litheness, the pliant softness of her figure, struck against his own. He
  gloried in it, thrilled in every cell to the sudden contact&mdash;to the
  quick, instinctive tremor which shook her form.</p>

  <p>"Hark ye, beloved," he cried softly into the shell-pink ear beneath his
  lips. "Hark ye&mdash;mark well my answer. The Mouthpiece of Zitu is no
  supernatural being, but a man and a lover&mdash;thy lover in very truth."</p>

  <p>And on the word the supple body of the woman went tense inside his arms.
  It struggled, it writhed. It struck its hands against his breast and pushed
  back her torso, straining, bending it against his restraining hold from the
  hips. Its face became convulsed, a panting, lip-parted, eye-wide mask of
  horror. With a final effort Naia tore herself free. Hot words poured from her
  mouth as she choked and gasped for breath.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;in the name of Zitu&mdash;what do you here&mdash;with
  that&mdash;that"&mdash;she lifted a naked arm and pointed&mdash;"with the
  wings of Azil&mdash;the looped cross of Ga&mdash;upon your breast?"</p>

  <p>"Is not Zud a man&mdash;and wears he not the cross at least&mdash;and
  comes he not among the Gayana at will?" stammered Croft, more disturbed than
  he cared to admit at her manner and words.</p>

  <p>And as he paused she blazed out in a fashion of almost scathing contempt.
  "A man, yes, is Zud&mdash;one in whom the flame of life burns low, who comes
  thither only when the work of him he serves demands it; who speaks, when he
  comes, naught but what to him seems truth."</p>

  <p>Croft instinctively flinched. Her allusion to what he felt she considered
  his own deceit in regard to himself flicked him despite his own knowledge of
  his own sincerity in all that he had done. The sensation which gripped him
  was due to no sense of guilt, but was more a poignant regret that she should
  have been led to consider him in any way false to the holiest emotions of his
  life.</p>

  <p>"What 'seems' truth, aye," he rejoined, therefore quickly holding Naia's
  eyes, from which flashed what seemed a purple fire, with his own. "Yet what
  man shall know the mind of Zitu, save as by his own interpretation, or be
  free from error in his words at times, even though years should have taught
  him discretion in his tongue?"</p>

  <p>Naia's lip curled. As Zud had said, hers was a haughty spirit&mdash;one
  not prone to break or yield as a weaker might have done. And now she refused
  to give ground in her position even with this man to whom she had given her
  love In the past&mdash;had stood ready to yield herself in every way the word
  implied. "At least." she said, Zud makes no claim to being anything other
  than he is."</p>

  <p>"Nor do I." Croft drew himself up. He seized what seemed to him to be an
  opportunity for arresting here sense of justice, which past experience had
  taught him was true and fair if it once were reached. "Have I claimed to be
  aught save a man who loved thee? Was it I or Zud who named me Mouthpiece of
  Zitu while I slept, or by whose orders, when I asked for clothing, was given
  me this priestly dress? Has Jasor of Nodhur ever in the past sought any
  greater exaltation in rank or fame or power than that alone which would bring
  him to your side? Have his spirit, his lips sought ever to call out to any
  other save to thee alone? Have not his arms fought ever those enemies who
  were thine because of his love for Naia of Aphur&mdash;to keep her country
  safe, herself from the pollution of other arms less clean?"</p>

  <p>And now for the first time it seemed that the Princess Naia faltered. Some
  of the tension went out of her graceful figure. Doubt crept into her eyes.
  "You&mdash;you," she asked a broken question, "would have me believe the
  Mouthpiece of Zitu a&mdash;man?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;as he is&mdash;a man who loves you as none ever loved you
  before." Croft threw out his arms. "Seem I not a man to you, Naia of
  Aphur&mdash;maid of gold&mdash;who have willingly lain in my arms, yielded me
  your lips&mdash;before this&mdash;who stand here now in the quarters of the
  Gayana, pledged to me by Lakkon&mdash;as well as by yourself. Is a man any
  less a man because he wears the garments of a priest?"</p>

  <p>"Hold, in Zitu's name!"</p>

  <p>Abruptly a tremor, a shudder shook the slender, half-veiled form he
  watched. "Man, though he be a priest, is sworn to chastity in Zitu's sight.
  Yet you, whom Zud names the Mouthpiece of Zitu&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Am sworn to love you, beloved," Croft cut her protest short.</p>

  <p>"Love?" Terror woke in Naia's face. She drew back. "Would seek to compel
  me with your newly acknowledged power? So long as Zud named you a spirit, I
  was ready to bend before you. But now that you name yourself a man, would
  seek to lead me into sin, even were I minded to give heed to your plea?"</p>

  <p>"Nay," said Croft in a softer voice. "Nay, Naia, woman of my
  soul&mdash;whom Zitu himself decreed in the beginning to be my mate. For love
  such as mine is no sin, but the law of Zitu himself&mdash;the cause of all
  living&mdash;all life. Yet, save you yield yourself to me of your own will,
  those things my spirit cries for shall not be. And&mdash;can I not convince
  you that, despite the words of Zud, which were ill advised, I am no more than
  him to whom you gave your promise&mdash;then are you&mdash;free?"</p>

  <p>He broke off and for the first time bowed his head. Something like despair
  seized upon him&mdash;a sick wave of discouraged purpose, as he realized how
  fully the leaven of the high priest's revelations had been at work&mdash;as
  he sensed that the very union she had confessed to him in the past she
  herself desired, had come to appear now a breaking of the law&mdash;a union
  unnatural&mdash;unsanctioned by the God of her religion&mdash;a sacrilegious
  thing.</p>

  <p>And as he stood there a change came over the girl who watched. For the
  first time in her knowledge of him Jasor of Nodhur bent his unflinching
  crest; for the first time a hopeless something weakened the lines of his
  strongly commanding face. And only one who knows the hearts of women may tell
  what things stirred that moment in her breast. She moved. Step by step she
  approached him where he stood. In an almost timid fashion she lifted a bared
  arm and laid her hand against his chest.</p>

  <p>"But," she faltered, "Abbu said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What?" Croft did not alter his position.</p>

  <p>"Those things which sent my spirit down to the dark world of Zitemku,
  ruler of the lost souls, in surprised dismay&mdash;that made me tremble as
  with cold&mdash;that sent me to kneel before Ga for hours that, being a woman
  and knowing women, she might help me to understand&mdash;that&mdash;that the
  spirit which dwelt in Jasor of Nodhur's body was not his own, but
  another's&mdash;sent by Zitu to possess it&mdash;when Jasor&mdash;died." The
  last was a quivering whisper, no more than a sibilant breath.</p>

  <p>"And if what Abbu said were truth?" Croft lifted his somber visage and
  looked down into her darkly tragic eyes. Twin pools of mental agony, they
  seemed, very close beneath his face&mdash;and Naia of Aphur's flesh on cheek
  and throat and scarce-veiled bosom gleamed bloodless, pallid. Even her parted
  lips were white.</p>

  <p>"If?" they questioned as he paused. "Think you that, right or wrong in
  Zitu's sight, I myself could mate with you were it the truth&mdash;couldst
  give myself to the embrace of a body filled by another than that spirit Zitu
  breathed into it at birth; think you my flesh would not shrink in very horror
  from the contact, my spirit rebel, nor force my flesh to yield? And were
  Abbu's tale true, then, too, were the high priest right. For how might such a
  thing transpire save by the will of Zitu himself&mdash;how else the body of a
  man who had given up the spirit return to life?"</p>

  <p>"I have told you," said Croft, "that those things I did were done by
  Zitu's grace. But I have not explained my full meaning. That I had reserved
  for another time, and for your ears alone. Yet I swear now by Zitu and Ga and
  Azil that I meant in my heart to tell you all things before I claimed you as
  my wife&mdash;make all things plain."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;" Once more Naia's figure stiffened. One hand crept up and lay
  pressed in above her heart. "Abbu said truth&mdash;your spirit is not
  Jasor's, but another's?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Croft, dully refusing further evasion, "Abbu said the truth.
  Yet not all the truth, and Zud overshot the mark in his interpretation." He
  paused.</p>

  <p>For the figure before him had risen, stretching upward on the balls of its
  rosy feet, lifting its arms in a high-flung gesture with fingers
  outstretched, extending, as it seemed, in every line of its slender, rounded
  length, with head back-tilted until its golden hair hung halfway down its
  tapering thighs in a shimmering cascade, its face raised, its lips parted,
  its eyes half closed. So sudden was the change that the girl's form seemed to
  have flung itself into that strange posture of abandonment to woe, as a
  stricken creature leaps in its death throes when struck by the hunter's
  shaft. And as Croft broke off, arrested by that tragic and yet still
  beautiful pose, a scream came out from the round, soft pillar of Naia of
  Aphur's throat.</p>

  <p>"Zitu! Ga! Befriend me!"</p>

  <p>All life went out of her glorious body. It sank down, seemed to shrink, to
  bend and sway before him like a tempest-riven reed.</p>

  <p>Croft caught it as it fell and lifted it in his arms&mdash;lifted it and
  held it, the dearest burden they had ever known&mdash;held it and bent above
  it with sick despair in his heart, despair for her whom he held, whose pliant
  glory now lay impotently unconscious, upborne, saved from the injury of its
  fall by his strong and reverent hands&mdash;despair for her and for
  himself&mdash;for them both&mdash;victims of Zud's curious meddling in their
  affairs.</p>

  <p>Zud! He ground his teeth together. He was not done with Tamarizia's high
  priest. Zud&mdash;or another&mdash;or ten thousand others&mdash;must pay for
  this. Something like a sob caught in his throat as he gazed at the
  down-dropped lids above those pansy-purple eyes in which Zud's interference
  had waked the look of horror they had held before they closed.</p>

  <p>The sound of a muffled groan escaped his lips. How different was this
  meeting from the one he had planned as taking place. Then, too, he had
  thought to hold her in his arms, but that she would lie there willing,
  gladly, responsive in her inmost being to his presence, not like this. And
  suddenly moved again by a strange impulse, because Zitu or God&mdash;what
  mattered it as to name, since, by any name whatever, there was for life but
  one source?&mdash;he lifted that splendid form and held it stretched prone
  and motionless before him, extended face uppermost across his powerful arms.
  And&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ga befriend her. Zitu befriend me. Azil have compassion upon us both!" he
  cried before he laid her on the couch of wine-red wood.</p>

  <p>For a long moment after he had straightened, he stood gazing down upon
  her. The sun streaming into the room through the glass of an embrasure struck
  out the golden design of the wings and cross upon his breast. It sparkled,
  shimmered, as it rose and fell with his breathing. But it was no more golden,
  no more shimmering than the flood of golden hair about Naia of Aphur's head.
  Nor was Croft's robe more blue in its jewel-wrought folds than the limpid
  eyes beneath her fallen, long-lashed lids.</p>

  <p>Of a sudden Croft's own eyes fired with purpose. He drew a sharp, deep
  breath. Naia of Aphur was his no longer. But&mdash;as Mouthpiece of
  Zitu&mdash;all men must obey his mandates; there would be no exception; not
  even the high priest himself, and&mdash;if he were to be cheated of the major
  object for which he had labored, to attain which he had finally broken the
  last bond between himself and earth&mdash;then let all men beware. He turned
  away to go in search of Zud.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI. &mdash; CROFT DECIDES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AND, now, despite all these things, despite the scene in the
  room of the Gayana, the shock of surprise attendant upon his waking&mdash;the
  first startled comprehension of what had happened wearing off ever so
  slightly, Croft's future course became to him more clear.</p>

  <p>Since the commanding part remained to him yet, it was his to command, not
  to question or advise. He stalked across the sunlighted vastness of the
  region of the Gayanas where the chatter of the maidens sank to silence as he
  passed, bade the vestal who had taken him to Naia send some of the women to
  attend her and passed through the silver door.</p>

  <p>Stern of lip, utterly composed in outward seeming once more, giving no
  outward sign of the tempest of black despair, of heart-sick and baffled
  yearning which raged within him, he made his way down three of the angling
  flights of the pyramid stairs and flung back into its masonry sockets the
  high priest's door.</p>

  <p>Never perhaps in the history of the nation has so unceremonious an
  entrance of those chambers in the sacred structure been made. Yet Croft had
  deliberately planned on the effect and a quiver of satisfaction filled him,
  as Zud, seated at a table of the wine-red wood so much used for furnishings
  in Tamarizia, refreshing himself with some cakes of beaten grain and wine,
  and fruit, glanced up sharply with an expression of surprised resentment and
  then started to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Sit, man of Zitu," he directed briskly and watched the high priest comply
  as he himself advanced and occupied a richly upholstered couch close to where
  Zud sat. Then as the priest dipped his hands into a crystal bowl of water and
  dried them on a square of cloth reserved for the purpose, he went on. "It
  were well to consider the form of this proclamation concerning the Mouthpiece
  of Zitu, I think."</p>

  <p>Zud eyed him. Plainly the high priest was ill at ease. Croft's whole
  manner had altered strangely since he had left him at the door of the Gayana,
  and he must have sensed it. The thing was in his intonation, the settled
  lines of his face, his eyes. "I&mdash;give ear, lord," he began, after a
  momentary pause. "What suggestions are there&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Suggestions?" The Mouthpiece of Zitu caught the last word from his mouth.
  "Think you that I shall offer suggestions, priest of Zitu? Does Zitu suggest
  when he speaks?"</p>

  <p>"Nay." Zud's expression grew troubled. "Hold not my words against me,
  lord. I seek not thy displeasure. Yours is the speaking, mine it is
  to&mdash;obey."</p>

  <p>"That is well," said Croft in a milder voice. "Listen then, Zud. It is my
  will that neither you, nor the brothers of the priesthood, nor any other man
  in Tamarizia, bend the knee to me again. Render unto Zitu that obeisance as
  heretofore&mdash;to Ga and Azil&mdash;not to me. Those things are of the
  spirit, Zud, not of the flesh. In Tamarizia after fourteen days men walk
  equal in Zitu's sight. Let thy word go forth to this effect."</p>

  <p>A tremor shook the high priest's hand as he stretched it forth. "I hear
  and obey, O lord; yet was it to thy spirit the knee was bent, not to Jasor of
  Nodhur's flesh." "My spirit is what Zitu by his grace has made it," Croft
  returned. "What I am lies between me and Zitu himself." "Yet how then shall
  the Mouthpiece of Zitu be proclaimed?" Zud quavered. Suddenly, despite his
  priestly trappings, the sumptuous quarters in which he sat, he seemed no more
  than a shaken old man.</p>

  <p>"It is of that I would give you counsel," Croft replied. "Where I minded I
  could forbid this proclamation altogether, Zud, and compel you to hang your
  head, admitting that you had meddled to bring about those things Zitu had not
  ordained. Think you he needs any man's assistance in working out his plan?
  Yet because I have watched closely since I awakened, and find your act
  inspired by no evil intent, but by lack of understanding, because to
  discredit your words were to strike not only thee, but at the very foundation
  itself of each man's belief, I am minded to let what you have decreed take
  place.</p>

  <p>"You shall proclaim me thus. Not as a spirit, but as a man, a teacher, one
  to whom Zitu permits certain things to be known; one by whom the welfare of
  the nation is considered, through whom shall be given to Tamarizia's people
  much for their own good; through whom those things Zitu permits for them
  shall be transmitted to them, and in so much Zitu's mouthpiece still."
  Abruptly he broke off as a sudden conception seized him. For a time he
  considered a startlingly daring plan before he spoke again in a tone of
  musing: "Zud&mdash;Zud, if you only know the truth."</p>

  <p>"The truth, O lord!" said the high priest slowly. "Have I not sought it
  all my life?"</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. "Aye, priest of Zitu, I think you have. Wouldst hear the
  truth of those things Abbu told you from my mouth?"</p>

  <p>Zud leaned forward somewhat quickly. For an instant an eager light gleamed
  in his eyes before they met Croft's steadily watching, and then wavered.</p>

  <p>"Lord!" he faltered, "lord!"</p>

  <p>Croft told him the tale.</p>

  <p>For that was the plan which had filled his mind&mdash;to tell it; to
  narrate to Zud the truth; to explain those things which had been done, and
  the how of each act so fully as he could inside the other's comprehension, to
  convince him by word of mouth if he might, or, failing that, to win his
  consent to a practical test.</p>

  <p>While he talked time dragged on, and by degrees Zud relaxed his pose, of
  something like overborne embarrassment.</p>

  <p>His attitude now became that of an amazed and eager attention. His eyes
  lighted and his breathing quickened, and now and then he moistened his lips
  with his tongue. By degrees his excitement increased, until he was gripping
  the arms of his chair and leaning toward Croft, in a posture which seemed no
  more than physical reflex of his mental determination to miss no single
  word.</p>

  <p>"Thou&mdash;thou sayest a man may leave his body at will?" he stammered as
  Croft paused.</p>

  <p>"Yes, if he knows the method of controlling his spirit to affect his
  object," Croft replied.</p>

  <p>"May go to other places while his body remains where he leaves
  it&mdash;and see and know, and return again?" Zud said. His eagerness struck
  Croft as almost pathetic. It was like that of a child.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he repeated again.</p>

  <p>"It is hard to believe," said Zud.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to have proof?" Croft decided to convince the high priest
  now and at once.</p>

  <p>"Proof?" Zud queried.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Would you like to leave this body of yours, Zud of Zitra, under my
  direction, learn I have spoken the truth?"</p>

  <p>His words were followed by a widening of the high priest's eyes. In them
  waked something like a startled desire, combined with a cautious hesitation.
  His whole expression was that of one who falters on the brink of the unknown,
  longing to dare it yet deterred by the very fact that it is the unknown.</p>

  <p>"Thou canst bring that about?" he questioned at length.</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you obey me wholly." Croft held him with a steady regard. To him
  that which he meant to do was no more than play. To cast this old man into a
  cataleptic sleep by his own consent and project his astral consciousness,
  whither he willed, was naught for one who by his own volition had spanned the
  gap of interstellar space. Yet to Zud the venture seemed to appear very vast,
  and he hesitated yet a moment briefly before:</p>

  <p>"My obedience is yours, O lord," he gasped.</p>

  <p>"Then," said Croft, summoning all the powers of his trained will to his
  aid, "fasten thy eyes on me, O man of Zitu, and fix thy mind on sleep, for
  this leaving of the body begins indeed with a something approaching sleep in
  its nature. Think therefore of sleep, O Zud&mdash;of sleep, of only
  sleep!"</p>

  <p>Fastening his gaze upon him in complete attention, until by degrees his
  lids, at first wide, began to droop above his eyes, Zud obeyed.</p>

  <p>"So then," Croft droned on as he noted .the change, "your eyes are
  closing, Zud; the lids grow heavy; sleep creeps now upon thee; sleep, a deep
  sleep. Zud, thou art asleep, yet sleeping thou canst hear my voice. Speak I
  not the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Aye"&mdash;a muffled murmur from the high priest's mouth.</p>

  <p>"And hearing me, Zud, even in your sleep you will render obedience to my
  words. Hence, listen closely and obey. Do you know where Lakkon and Jadgor
  and Robur lodge?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," quavered the high priest.</p>

  <p>"Then shall you go there, Zud, on my command. In the name of Zitu I
  command you to leave your body&mdash;now."</p>

  <p>For a moment he gave over speaking and waited while the form of the high
  priest relaxed and sagged down in the chair of ruddy wood. Then abruptly he
  resumed:</p>

  <p>"Have obeyed me, Zud?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," no more than a whisper from the lips of the body in the chair.
  '</p>

  <p>"What do you see?" Croft demanded, n. "A strange sight, indeed. My own
  form, as in a reflecting water-pool, seated with downcast head, as wrapped in
  sleep."</p>

  <p>"'Tis well," Croft spoke in answer and direction. "Await my company, Zud."
  He threw himself prone upon the couch and freed his own astral shell from
  Jasor's body by the effort of his will. An instant later he floated midway
  between the floor and ceiling at Zud's side. Below them, sat and reclined
  each body. There stood the table, still bearing food for the material body
  midway between couch, and chair. Croft turned to his companion. And now all
  communication was on the astral plane, without sound, yet by a none less
  evident diffusion of conscious ' vibration.</p>

  <p>"Thou seest?" he queried with a smile. "Aye," the answer came to him from
  Zud's wraith&mdash;that strange replica of his earthly form, implacable,
  invisible to any save Croft's and his own eyes, which hung there between the
  floor of the apartment and the burnished roof, weaving to and fro, in each
  intangible current of the air, swaying and billowing, like a wind-stirred
  effigy in smoke. "Aye, lord,</p>

  <p>I see, and am filled with amazement." "Thou seest but the first step as
  yet," Croft told him. "Come!"</p>

  <p>There was an open embrasure in the pyramid wall. Through it Croft willed
  himself, and seizing the thin arm of the weird form beside him, dragged it
  along. They shot out and up through a sun-filled air&mdash;out and up and
  up. The pyramid lay beneath them, the snow-white temple of Zitu glinting in
  dazzling fashion on its top. East, west, north and south Zitra lay spread to
  their sight, with its houses, its palaces and hovels, the ringing
  circumference of its mighty walls. Its harbor studded with sails was all
  asparkle in the sunlight, and beyond that the : bosom of the central ocean
  rose and fell slowly like the breast of a woman asleep.</p>

  <p>"Lord! Lord!" Croft sensed that the high priest gasped again in his
  emotions at least.</p>

  <p>"Behold!" Croft returned and swept an arm in the gesture of a circle.
  "Priest of Zitu, behold! And, now, in which direction do the men I mentioned
  lodge?"</p>

  <p>"In the palace of Tamhys himself, as his guests," Zud replied, and pointed
  with a spectral arm.</p>

  <p>"Will thyself to their presence, even as you were in the flesh. Think only
  that you desire immediate nearness to them. So shall you come upon them,
  Zud." "Aye, lord," Zud knit his astral brows as though in mental effort.</p>

  <p>The sunlight vanished in a flash. With it went out the far-flung view of
  the Tamarizian landscape&mdash;the city, the waves of the central sea.
  Suddenly vast walls appeared on every hand&mdash;a tessellated floor inlaid
  in white and gold and silver, stretched out beneath a roof of silver inlaid
  beams, supporting frames containing varicolored glass.</p>

  <p>This was the interior court of the Zit-ran palace as Croft knew. It swept
  past quickly. He had the impression of the balcony surrounding it on all four
  sides in Tamarizian style, of the supporting arches, of the groups of
  statuary between them, of the ascending stairways, and then they vanished,
  too, and he found himself in a smaller apartment, its sliding doorway covered
  by a scarlet curtain, its floor in part concealed by gorgeous rugs, its
  windows draped with other scarlet tissues through which the outer light shone
  redly&mdash;a room equipped with couches and chairs and tables, adorned
  between the doors and windows with frescoes and groups of sculpture done in
  the customary translucent stone, and supported on pedestals of copper, silver
  and gold. So much he saw at a glance before he fastened his attention on the
  figures of three men grouped about a table in front of a scarlet-curtained
  window in the outer end of the room.</p>

  <p>These men he knew, had met and known and conversed with before this in the
  flesh. Jadgor, of Aphur, heavy set, dark of eyes and complexion, grizzled of
  hair, his nose high and somewhat bent in the middle, his whole appearance
  that of a man of driving purpose, sat there now clad in leg cases, shirt and
  metal cuirass, with Aphur's rayed sun on his breast. And close beside him on
  the table reposed his helmet with its nodding scarlet plumes.</p>

  <p>Opposite him sat Lakkon, noble of Aphur and adviser to the king, heavy set
  like his brother-in-law, strong of feature, with iron-gray poll, dressed like
  to Jadgor in every essential detail, though in a fashion less royal. By the
  end of the table stood Robur, Jadgor's son, cleanlimbed, strong-featured,
  with well-formed jaw and mouth, about 'which lurked often a hint of humor,
  as Croft knew. In a fleeting glance he recognized its absence now. The face
  of the crown prince was set into almost stubborn lines, its cheeks a trifle
  flushed.</p>

  <p>And even as Croft perceived the attitude and expression of the several
  occupants of the apartment, Jadgor hit the table with one fist a resounding
  crash, whose vibration eddied out and set Zud to drunkenly rocking in their
  whorl close by Croft's side.</p>

  <p>"By Zitu, and by Zitu!" He swore a double oath. "I like not this delay in
  an understanding. Thrice in as many days have we visited the pyramid, and Zud
  has said he sleeps. Much has he done for Tamarizia, as I shall last deny; nor
  did he tell us to remain in Zitra at the last. Yet if Zud be right, as he
  should, being high priest, my brother, Lakkon, finds himself in difficult
  case."</p>

  <p>Lakkon's visage darkened. "Yet was the pledge given of his seeking," he
  broke out in querulous fashion. "Jadgor knows that Jasor, be he spirit, as
  Zud saith, or man, sought it of me ere he entered the armored car to lead
  into the conflict wherein Helmor, of Zollaria, was overthrown. And Jadgor
  himself did sponsor my words wherein Naia, my daughter, was promised him to
  wife. Wherefore, she hath permitted his arms, and yielded him her mouth, as
  none save an unclean woman doth to any save the men of her own family or him
  to whom she is betrothed."</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Jadgor, frowning. "Yet shall a spirit mate with the flesh.
  Continence is no less a vow of the priesthood than of the Gayana. Were a
  spirit sent by Zitu to do his work, even though to that end he employs the
  body of one whom Azil has recalled, is he to be considered as man or
  priest?"</p>

  <p>"Think you Zitu wouldst choose a rebellious spirit for his mouthpiece?"
  Robur broke in with considerable heat. "Jadgor, my father, who are we to
  judge?"</p>

  <p>"Robur seems minded to attempt it," Jadgor rejoined with a sarcasm he
  plainly did not wish to conceal.</p>

  <p>"Aye." The color deepened in the crown prince's cheeks. "For by Jadgor's
  command I labored beside this Jasor, of Nodhur, as he then was known, for the
  better part of a cycle, toward the end of making Tamarizia safe against what
  Helmor did intend, and in nothing did I find him other save steadfast and
  just. Man he was in every seeming, save that his knowledge surpassed the
  knowledge of all other men, and for these sleeps such as holds him now. We
  became as brothers in our common purpose, whereby Jadgor now bids fair to
  attain his ends."</p>

  <p>Croft's heart warmed swiftly to Robur's defense, though it was no more
  than from his knowledge of the crown prince he had felt he might expect. As
  Robur said the bond between them in their year of mutual endeavor in the
  shops of Himyra and Ladhra, where the motors and rifles used in the war were
  made, had become exceedingly close. Indeed, so intimate had they grown that
  he had addressed Robur as "Rob."</p>

  <p>They had been as brothers, indeed, and he felt new confidence now, knowing
  Gaya would reflect the attitude of her husband rather than any one else. And
  Gaya in the past had been at one time the means of communication between Naia
  and himself, when Lakkon had felt himself bound by a pledge to Cathur, to
  discourage Croft's suit. Now, therefore, he waited eagerly to see what
  response Jadgor might make to his son's final sentence which was no more than
  an allusion to those plans of mounting the Zitran throne that had held
  Jadgor's mind when Croft came to Palos first, toward which, by a marriage
  with Cathur's profligate prince, Naia was to aid.</p>

  <p>And that Jadgor sensed the half-veiled rebuke, he saw at once, since the
  Aphurian's frown but deepened before he spoke. "Man in seeming is he, I
  admit, yet to Abbu he confessed that he was not Jasor but another. This thing
  I do not understand, nor doth Zud. Yet were he an agent of Zitu, then were
  the end of which you speak of Zitu's willing for Tamarizia's good, which, as
  my son knows, lies nearest Jadgor's heart. Zud, as you know also,</p>

  <p>I have questioned, and he holds that none save a mortal may know a woman,
  save only by Zitu's will, as Azil was conceived of Ga."</p>

  <p>"Then why question Zitu's will, as expressed by Zitu's Mouthpiece?" said
  Robur quickly, and paused with a gasp.</p>

  <p>"What mean you?" Jadgor half rose from his seat.</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;" Suddenly Robur faltered, he seemed disturbed, abashed. He
  lowered his eyes. "Nay, my father, I spoke In haste. What says the maiden
  herself? Did not my uncle speak with her the prior sun?"</p>

  <p>"She holds to her promise as she has held since the beginning," Jadgor
  replied. "She refuses to leave the Gayana until she has speech with the
  sleeper himself." "Nor will she leave ever, should Abbu's words and Zud's
  judgment prove true," Lakkon said with a twitching face. "Virgin is she in
  all save the love she has given to him she knew as Jasor. Failing its
  consummation, she becomes Gayana herself."</p>

  <p>"Nay, by Zitu!" Robur cried a savage protest. "My father and uncle, of
  this thing there lies some explanation. He who I, too, knew as Jasor, won not
  the full love of my cousin for any such sterile fate. Himself, he told me
  that all he did was by Zitu's grace; and of all that he did was not this too
  a part?"</p>

  <p>A part&mdash;rather the all&mdash;the motive, the object of what he had
  done, thought Croft, as he once more thrilled to the sturdy, unyielding
  quality of Robur's partisanship.</p>

  <p>Then as Jadgor made no immediate answer, and Lakkon sat with troubled
  countenance, lost as it appeared in the prospective fate of the daughter whom
  he loved with an almost adoring devotion, and now saw embrace the life of a
  vestal as escape from what, by Tamarizian custom, must otherwise amount to a
  technical disgrace, Robur went on. "Wherefore, as said before, who are we to
  judge the Hupor Jasor or the Mouthpiece of Zitu, be he what he may, ere he
  awakes? Like to my cousin, Naia, I would ask him to speak for himself."
  Jadgor gave him a glance. "For that waking we have waited many suns." "Yet,
  perhaps he wakes even now," Lakkon suggested quickly, his manner that of a
  man who grasps at straws.</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Jadgor, "perhaps. And&mdash;since we are met for the purpose,
  rather than useless discussion, let us seek the pyramid at once. He rose, a
  commanding figure in his glistening cuirass and moved toward the curtained
  door.</p>

  <p>"Back!" Croft commanded Zud. "Desire the return to thy body."</p>

  <p>He suited his own act to the word, and an instant later opened his
  physical eyes to find Zud sitting tensely erect, regarding him out of
  staring, startled eyes.</p>

  <p>He sat up. "You saw, O Zud," he questioned. "You heard?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Zud a trifle hoarsely. "This passes understanding."</p>

  <p>"Only until understood," Croft told him. "Art any less yourself for having
  left your flesh?"</p>

  <p>Zud dropped his eyes. "Nay, not so," he said at last.</p>

  <p>"And had you entered this body upon the couch, rather than that in the
  chair?" Croft pressed him closely. "Think you, Zud, you would have been any
  less yourself, any less Zud, the&mdash;priest of Zitu, and&mdash;a man?"</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Zud breathed sharply. Plainly he caught Croft's drift. "In such a
  fashion then you have visited other places, even to the stars, and seen
  strange things, and brought back what you deemed good?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Croft with a smile. "In the spirit, Zud, you have seen your
  body lie sleeping, even as in the flesh you have seen my body lie. Yet are
  you Zud in the spirit or in the flesh; for with each man it is the spirit
  commands the flesh; that acts, and the spirit, Zud of Zitra, is of Zitu,
  breathed from his nostrils, into the flesh, to give the body life."</p>

  <p>"Man then is a spirit?" Zud began slowly. He seemed shaken, yet in some
  subtle way exalted, despite the fact that he was pallid to the lips.</p>

  <p>"Aye, Zud, priest of Zitu. There were no man else."</p>

  <p>A rap fell on the door of the apartment. It slid back, revealing a lay
  brother in bare feet and cord-belted robe. He advanced, bending before Zud
  from the waist, his arms extended in the sign of the horizontal cross.</p>

  <p>"Jadgor of Aphur, and Lakkon, and Robur, son of Jadgor, await audience
  with Zud of Zitra," he announced.</p>

  <p>"Admit them," Zud glanced at Croft as the brother withdrew. "Thou art as
  thou hast said, a teacher not only of all men, but of Zitu's priest. I would
  speak with thee more of this."</p>

  <p>For the second time the door slid back. Jadgor, Lakkon, and Robur filed
  in.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII. &mdash; FATHER AND SON</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"GREETING, priest of Zitu," Jadgor began, catching sight of
  the other occupant of the room, and paused briefly before he went on:</p>

  <p>"Hai, Hupor,-so you are awake again at last."</p>

  <p>"As Jadgor sees," said Croft without rising, while Lakkon stared and Robur
  took a quick step forward, flushed deeply and checked his instinctive motion,
  as one who hesitates in a decision.</p>

  <p>Toward him Croft put out a hand, and as Robur caught it with a sudden
  gesture, he smiled. "Zud tells me you stand without opposition in Aphur,
  Rob," he resumed as he gripped the Tamarizian's fingers. "Of such things I am
  glad."</p>

  <p>"It was to inquire of you, we have intruded upon the priest of Zitra,"
  Jadgor spoke again before Robur could do more than return Croft's grip.
  "Concerning thee a proclamation has gone forth&mdash;Mouthpiece of Zitu, thou art
  acclaimed. How then shall we salute thee in the future?" His tone was
  haughty, harmonizing with the attitude of mind Croft had sensed in the room
  in Tamhys's palace. But he paid it the tribute of small notice.</p>

  <p>"Salute me," he said almost coldly, "as Zud has ordained.</p>

  <p>"Thou art from Zitu then?" Jadgor lost a modicum of his aplomb. Man of
  action, accustomed to command though he was, yet, like most of his nation, he
  stood in awe of his nation's god&mdash;and Croft's answer gave him pause.</p>

  <p>"All men are of Zitu, Jadgor of Aphur," Croft replied, meaning in his
  response to do the presidential candidate small good.</p>

  <p>But as he paused: "Truth is being spoken," Robur cut quickly in. "All men
  are of Zitu through Azil and Ga, until Zitu himself sends Zilla, with his
  sucking lips to take his life away."</p>

  <p>Once more Croft smiled into the eyes of his friend. "Then gentle
  Gaya&mdash;she is happy at your popularity, Rob?" he inquired as Jadgor stood
  and stared.</p>

  <p>"She waits me at Himyra," Robur returned, inclining his head.
  "But&mdash;there were reasons why I desired more to remain in Zitra until
  such time as should find you awakened from your sleep."</p>

  <p>"Oh, aye&mdash;such reasons as Jadgor's doubt, and Lakkon's questions
  concerning Zud's proclamation." Croft yawned as he spoke. "But Robur forgets
  not so quickly his friends."</p>

  <p>"By Zitu! How say you?" Jadgor broke out in a roar, flicked as it seemed
  to dare the question by Croft's manner and words. "Are you spirit or
  man?"</p>

  <p>Croft eyed him for what seemed a long time before he answered. "A
  man&mdash;in the way you mean it, O Jadgor&mdash;a man as thou art."</p>

  <p>"Hai!" In a fashion Jadgor seemed surprised. "Then how the
  Mouthpiece&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>Croft rose. The cross and the wings of Azil glowed yellow in a ray of
  sunlight on his breast. His tone was that of a teacher to a child. "Jadgor of
  Aphur," he spoke with deliberation, each accent falling slowly, "the
  Mouthpiece is that which speaks from knowledge to him who has
  less&mdash;hence is the teacher a mouthpiece of knowledge to the student.
  Those things which are difficult to one of little knowledge may appear but
  simple to the mind of one who understands."</p>

  <p>Color crept into Jadgor's dark face. One would have said Croft's speech
  had lashed his haughty spirit like a whip to a gnuppa's flank. His eyes came
  up and he measured glances with the man before him. "And," said he a trifle
  quickly, "as Mouthpiece of Zitu, you claim the greater knowledge for
  yourself? Perchance it were but a short step in your belief between the
  greater knowledge and the greater power. But&mdash;Tamarizia is not yet
  within the full grasp of your hand, and Aphur still is Aphur, and with Nodhur
  and Milidhur, strong."</p>

  <p>"My father!" Robur's tone was one of consternation. He took a quick step
  in Jadgor's direction.</p>

  <p>"Hold, Rob!" Croft lifted a restraining hand. It came into his mind that
  the greater power of which Jadgor spoke was after all the main point that was
  troubling the Aphurian king&mdash;that he feared a loss of that prestige even
  as president, which all his life he had known&mdash;was alarmed lest Croft
  with the backing of the priesthood gain the upper hand, and Zud step into the
  position of sponsor for the stranger which until now he himself had held with
  great honor to himself and his son. He let an icy smile grow slowly on his
  lips. "Aye, Milidhur and Nodhur and Aphur are strong. Aphur's king, through
  me. Also, is Tamarizia yet an empire. Wherefore the change of government is
  by Tamhys' decree. Let Jadgor beware lest success and quick attainment of his
  wishes may turn his head."</p>

  <p>"Hai! You would threaten!" Jadgor exclaimed,' drawing himself up to his
  full height.</p>

  <p>"Hold!" commanded Zud, breaking in for the first time. "Jadgor of Himyra,
  you forget yourself, and the obedience all men owe to Zitu&mdash;and the
  victory granted Tamarizia by his grace. What is the strength of Aphur or
  Nodhur or Milidhur, to his designs? And think you that any or all of those
  states will follow you against the word of Zitu's priest?"</p>

  <p>"Or," Croft caught up the subject, well pleased by Zud's stand in the
  matter, "think you that I who gave the strength of which you boast, have not
  greater strength to give, or should the need arise to use against that
  already given? If so, ask Zud, who has seen somewhat of my plans."</p>

  <p>But Jadgor was stubborn, and years of authority had made it hard for one
  of his type to yield. "Strength you may have," he retorted shortly, "yet
  where shall it be produced in time to avail against Aphur's strength? And if
  not in time, where produced at all, were Tamarizia still an empire with
  Jadgor on the throne?" His eyes flashed sharply and he laid a hand on the
  gem-studded hilt of his sword.</p>

  <p>"Hold!" cried Zud once more, while Robur paled and Lakkon drew
  instinctively back from his king. "Thy words approach treason, Jadgor, should
  they come to Tamhys's ears. As priest of Zitu I command you to yield
  obedience to the Mouthpiece of Zitu&mdash;to aid, not oppose his intent."</p>

  <p>Jadgor was heated beyond all cool judgment. He flung back his head.
  "Mouthpiece of Zitu&mdash;or of Zitemku, the foul one&mdash;or man as he
  himself alleges, Jadgor yields authority to no one!" he roared.</p>

  <p>"Nor hesitated to offer his sister's child to a profligate prince, turned
  traitor to his land in order to increase it," said Croft as the Aphurian
  paused.</p>

  <p>"The point is well taken," Jadgor returned, breathing deeply inside his
  metal cuirass, "since the maid was almost asked by the Mouthpiece of Zitu
  himself as a price."</p>

  <p>"No," Croft denied with a greater show of emotion than he had exhibited as
  yet. "I asked but your consent and that of her father to have her for my wife
  if I could."</p>

  <p>"He speaks truth, my father," Robur declared. "And&mdash;I myself know
  that Naia, my cousin, loved Jasor of Nodhur as no other."</p>

  <p>"Jasor," Lakkon spoke for the first time. "But Naia herself has told me
  that Abbu of Scira said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That Jasor's spirit was drawn from his lips by Zilla," Jadgor
  interrupted. "How say you, Robur&mdash;think you your cousin desires marriage
  with a body whose spirit has fled?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Croft, speaking before Robur could find any answer. "Naia of
  Aphur is free from any claim of mine, save as she herself decides when she
  learns the truth.''</p>

  <p>"Thou hast&mdash;seen her?" Lakkon faltered, his face beginning to
  work.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and told her the truth as I meant to tell it to her, save that
  Abbu spoke to Zud in the time of my sleep and Zud spoke to the maid without a
  full understanding of all the truth embraced." "The truth&mdash;what is it?
  Is it true that your spirit is not Jasor's?" Jadgor once more broke
  forth.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;my spirit is not Jasor's," Croft returned. "To Zud I have
  explained it. Yet is my spirit the spirit of a man born of a woman as any
  other though not on Palos nor into Jasor's flesh."</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Jadgor was plainly startled. "Can a man's spirit forsake his body
  and enter another, and yet possess mortal life?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Zud, whose single experience, as Croft had meant, seemed to
  have filled him with complete conviction. "I myself have left my flesh and
  returned into it again, so that while I was absent it lay sleeping. Zitu has
  granted this to me through his Mouthpiece, that I might more fully
  understand."</p>

  <p>"Thou?" Jadgor eyed him, as though in doubt as to how to take his
  words.</p>

  <p>"I, Jadgor, yes," Zud said. "In the spirit was I present in the palace of
  Tamhys when you spoke with Lakkon and Robur concerning this same thing, and
  Robur defended his friend as since coming here he has done. And though I was
  not seen of you, yet heard I what was said. Hence I believe that the spirit
  of Zitu hath sent to guide us to a greater knowledge is, as he himself says,
  the spirit of a man of earth."</p>

  <p>"Earth?" Jadgor frowned at the unaccustomed word.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;a world ruled over by a different sun than ours," Zud
  rejoined.</p>

  <p>"Jasor&mdash;since that is the name by which I have known you, and learned
  to love you," Robur began again, "is this the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Robur my brother, Zud speaks truly," Croft replied.</p>

  <p>"You came from&mdash;earth?" The crown prince stammered slightly over the
  planet's name.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Robur&mdash;I came from earth."</p>

  <p>Robur nodded. "I remember now that Sinon of Milidhur mentioned the fact
  that his son's appearance since his illness had changed, along with his
  bearing and his knowledge. Jadgor, my father, I believe this truth. Friend of
  the Crown Prince of Aphur, what was your name on earth?"</p>

  <p>"Jason," said Croft.</p>

  <p>"Zitu! 'tis well nigh the same."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Croft regarded the crown prince, smiling. "And&mdash;Robur my
  friend, it is the spirit which molds the flesh. Hence Jasor's body, after I
  possessed it, altered in its appearance to some extent. Think back, Prince of
  Aphur; seems it the same to you now, as in those days when by you it was
  first known, or has it undergone some still further change?"</p>

  <p>"It has changed," Robur replied quickly, his eyes lighting. "Now by Azil
  himself, I begin to comprehend your meaning, Jason, if I may call you by that
  name."</p>

  <p>"Call me as you will, Rob," Croft returned. "Since I know you are my
  friend."</p>

  <p>Lakkon plucked at Jadgor's arm. "I&mdash;would see my daughter, O
  Jadgor," he said in a lowered voice. "Since she has seen this Jason, I would
  speak to her of many things."</p>

  <p>"Shortly," Jadgor replied. "Say to her that so soon as Jason is proclaimed
  Mouthpiece of Zitu, we return to Himyra&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But should she desire to remain with the Gayana," Lakkon interrupted.</p>

  <p>"By Zitu!" Jadgor gave him a frowning glance. "I speak to you and to her
  through you as her king. Surely I hold place above the children of Aphur yet.
  Are there not Gayana in Himyra's pyramid as well as here should she decide to
  give herself to Ga? Repeat to her my words and see that she obeys.
  Or&mdash;hold! I will see the maid myself." He turned back to Croft and Zud.
  "These things I confess I do not understand, and in truth to me they pass all
  understanding. Man of Zitu, yet is it clear to my mind that an understanding
  lies between this other and yourself. Wherefore I must ponder the matter
  well, and seek to determine whether the palace or the pyramid of Zitra shall
  rule Tamarizia in the future. To thee for the present, Zud&mdash;peace. Be
  pleased to direct that the maiden Naia be brought to an audience chamber for
  speech with her father and her king."</p>

  <p>"Jadgor's request is granted." Zud lifted a small hammer from the table
  and struck against a metal gong.</p>

  <p>The door slid back and a lay brother appeared.</p>

  <p>Zud spoke to him, directing him to lead Jadgor and Lakkon to an apartment,
  and command Naia's presence there.</p>

  <p>"Peace to you, Zud," Jadgor said again as he turned away.</p>

  <p>"And to thee peace," responded Zitu's priest.</p>

  <p>"Rob," Croft arrested Aphur's prince as he moved to follow his father,
  "are you party to this interview with your cousin?"</p>

  <p>"No." Robur paused. "I return now to the palace."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. "Presently then. Come now. I would speak with you
  alone."</p>

  <p>For all his controlled demeanor, Croft was none the less disturbed as,
  leaving Zud, he led Jadgor's son to the room in which for two weeks his body
  had lain entranced. Jadgor's stand he could understand well enough, as well
  as his veiled taunt that were it to come to a test of strength between them,
  Croft might not be able to arm the rest of the nation against Milidhur,
  Nodhur, and Aphur, for the simple reason that before he would create anything
  with which to resist the weapons he himself had placed in the hands of
  Jadgor's men and his allies, he must create shops. Those plants he had thus
  far brought into being were in Nodhur and Aphur alone&mdash;one at Himyra,
  Jadgor's city, and the other at Ladhra, capital of Nodhur, where lived Sinon
  and Mellia, the parents of Jasor whose body Croft had made his own&mdash;that
  Sinon and Mellia, whom Jadgor had raised from the merchant caste to the
  nobility because of the wonders worked by their supposed son.</p>

  <p>Nor did Croft like the thought that because of him or anything he had
  done, Tamarizia should by any chance be tom by internal conflict, or his
  plans for a republic be overthrown. And yet in Jadgor's words he had read a
  hint of civil war between the south and western states and the rest of the
  nation, where Jadgor declined to accept any authority higher than his own. As
  he had said to the man not half an hour before, the easy victory over Helmor
  of Zollaria and the acclaim resulting to himself as nominal commander of the
  Tamarizian army, seemed to have gone to Jadgor's head. And in addition he
  appeared to feel sincerely that through Croft a possible disgrace had been
  brought upon his family through Naia, and therefore upon himself.</p>

  <p>Also Jadgor had thrown out an intimation that with enough power behind him
  he would be minded to curtail Croft's activities in so far as he could, once
  he were on the Zitran throne. Nor did Croft doubt that even were a civil war
  avoided, Jadgor would be elected president of the republic if let alone.
  Aphur would vote for him, as would Nodhur unless very quick action was taken.
  Milidhur could be counted on for support since Robur's wife was the daughter
  of that state's present king. Cathur, freed from the treason which had
  weakened it once, would surely favor Jadgor, who had saved it from being
  overrun and meeting Mazhur's fate of fifty years before. Mazhur might be
  expected to support the man who had freed her from the slavery she had
  endured for fifty years. Bithur and Hiranur alone, then were not sure. Of the
  two, Hiranur would almost certainly support Tammon, the emperor's son, and
  Bithur might well be expected to split his vote, with the odds on Jadgor
  again, because of that boasted strength Croft's labors in Aphur had
  brought&mdash;a strength Bithur might feel needed in defense, since Mazzer
  adjoined her entire eastern frontier and Zollaria, beaten but not crushed,
  yet threatened dangerously on the north.</p>

  <p>All in all he felt that in what he did and said he would tread on delicate
  ground, as he saw Robur seated and approached the golden casket Zud had
  opened to inspect the drawings it contained.</p>

  <p>But he said nothing of what was seething in his brain as he took out the
  plans and carried them back to spread them out before Robur's eyes on his
  couch.</p>

  <p>One of them was for a dynamo, water-driven, and nothing else. There were
  many streams in Tamarizia's mountains, and he had planned to harness their
  power for the generation of electric force. This then he took up first.</p>

  <p>"Look, Rob," he began as he held it before his companion's eyes. "Can you
  remember a night in Himyra when Jadgor named me Hupor, and I said the scene
  would have been more brilliant were light obtained from many lamps of glass
  inside which a luminous filament glowed?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, I remember it well." Robur inclined his head. His face was serious
  and he seemed ill at ease, as well as somewhat surprised that Croft had
  turned to the plans rather than taking up a discussion of other things.</p>

  <p>But Croft had a purpose in so doing: a hope that by showing Robur the
  things he planned to accomplish, he might reach Jadgor's ear in' a less
  direct, though no less effective fashion, since doubtless Robur would speak
  concerning them to the king. "This," he said when assured that the prince
  recalled his former remark, "is a device to provide such light, and many
  other things."</p>

  <p>For an hour thereafter he talked, displaying plan after plan, each one of
  which he explained, until at the end, Robur's face was flushed with
  excitement, his eyes glowing in anticipation of beholding undreamed of
  things.</p>

  <p>"Jasor or Jason," he exclaimed at length. "Mouthpiece of Zitu must you be
  indeed to devise such objects, to have knowledge of them&mdash;to draw their
  designs."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;" Croft considered swiftly. Robur was husband to Gaya, and Gaya
  had stood his friend in his effort to win Naia before. He decided to tell
  Robur the literal truth. "No, Robur&mdash;these things are not mine own. Of
  Zitu they are&mdash;by him permitted for man's use&mdash;yet are they things
  known, and employed daily in the life of, men on that star from which I
  come."</p>

  <p>"Earth," said Robur quickly. "These things are known on earth, and the
  motors, the rifles&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Croft nodded slightly. "And a thousand other things." He took up a
  final plan. "Rob, what do you think of a device which can lift a man into the
  air, as a bird rises on its wings?"</p>

  <p>"Zitu! Would you fly, Jason of earth!" Robur caught a slightly unsteady
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Aye," Croft spread out the parchment. He had drawn it in a moment of
  daring impulse, and now he explained to Robur how it was driven by a
  "motur"&mdash;the' name he had given to his engines, modified to fit
  Tamarizian speech, and the action of the planes.</p>

  <p>For a time Jadgor's son sat seemingly lost in a silent contemplation of
  this to him most wonderful fruit of his companion's hand and brain. And then
  he flung up his head and looked him full in the eyes. "Jason, tell me the
  truth, in Zitu's name!" he burst into an impassioned query. "Why came you
  from earth to Palos&mdash;what strange force led you to seek life with
  us?"</p>

  <p>And Croft answered that heart-sincere appeal without visible hesitation.
  "The strongest force in all the sum of Zitu's forces, Robur&mdash;that force
  which men call&mdash;love."</p>

  <p>"Love?" repeated Robur, staring. "Of a woman, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Of a woman, yes," said Croft, returning his regard directly. "You know
  well the maid."</p>

  <p>"Naia, by Zitu!" Robur sprang to his feet. "You have dared all for her?"
  "All," said Croft. "Listen Rob, my true friend to whom I may open my heart. To Palos and Tamarizia I came first, seeking knowledge, having learned how a
  man may leave his body in the spirit, even as I have proved a man may. Yet
  knew I not why I chose Palos, until I came to Himyra and saw Naia of Aphur
  first. But having seen her even in the spirit, I loved her, as a man may love
  but one woman, in either the spirit or flesh; and because of that
  love&mdash;because to me she meant all and more than any other thing in life,
  and because I possessed the knowledge and the power, I dared death itself in
  taking Jasor's body when he laid it down, in order that I might save her from
  the marriage to Cathur, Jadgor planned, and win her for myself. Jadgor's son
  knows the rest."</p>

  <p>"Aye," Robur said. "And he knows that were the truth understood by Jadgor
  he would command the maid to your arms, and make sure that these strange
  instruments, the designs of which you have shown me, should be made in the
  Himyra and Ladhra shops."</p>

  <p>"Hold!" exclaimed Jason. "Stop&mdash;once have l saved Naia of Aphur from
  paying the score of Jadgor's ambitions, nor will I permit it again. If the
  maiden comes to me at all, Rob, it must be of her own choice&mdash;from her
  own wish, not by the command of Jadgor or another, as my willing
  mate&mdash;not as a price."</p>

  <p>Robur nodded. "Hai, Jason!" he cried. "Now can I understand you, and find
  you the man I have felt you in my heart." He approached Croft, seized his
  hand and placed it on his shoulder, laid his own on that of his companion in
  the posture of greeting used by Tamarizian friends. So for a moment the two
  men stood eye to eye before Robur went on: "Thy love is a true love&mdash;of
  the heart as well as of the body. Claim me thy friend in this, O
  Jason&mdash;I and Gaya, the woman I won in similar fashion, though I
  journeyed no farther than to Milidhur to find her. You have seen the maid
  since your awakening. Tell me; said you to her so much?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Croft told him. "save that she came to me willingly&mdash;herself
  she was free."</p>

  <p>"And what said Naia my cousin? O Jason, my heart goes out to you as ever
  since we have known each other. Robur may find a way to assist a friend."</p>

  <p>Once more Croft felt his whole being warm to Aphur's prince. " Tis the
  matter of Jasor's body and Jason's spirit, that disturbs her," he explained.
  "Concerning that I meant to tell her, as only I could tell it, so that she
  might understand. That would I have done at a time of my own selecting before
  she became my wife, save that Abbu of Scira to whom I confessed that my
  spirit was not Jasor's but one which meant to Tamarizia only good&mdash;Abbu, whom I swore to silence in Zitu's name, was by Zud absolved from
  his oath and spoke. And Zud gaining part of the truth only, yet carried what
  he had learned to Naia's ears. Zud, startled by what he had learned, named me
  to her a spirit sent by Zitu. Naia looks upon herself as one deceived, well
  nigh betrayed."</p>

  <p>"But," said Robur quickly, "when you told her of yourself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nay," Croft replied. "Naia of Aphur is not one to weep, nor ask for
  explanations."</p>

  <p>Robur nodded in comprehension of all Croft's words implied. "So that she
  knows not as yet of this love that drew you from another world to win her,
  even as with us a man might go from one kingdom to another. Yet to me it
  seems that a maid might marvel at a love so great."</p>

  <p>Croft's eyes lighted at the suggestion. "As I had hoped she would when I
  told it in the way I meant to tell it, Rob. See you not that this title
  proclaimed by Zud is something thrust upon me, rather than sought by myself?
  For though I meant to be to Tamarizia a teacher in many things, and in so far
  a mouthpiece in very truth, showing to her people those things known to
  others, but drawn first from Zitu's mind as all things created must be; yet
  had I no intent, or wish to greatly exalt myself. In Himyra I sought the rank
  of Hupor merely because it raised me to her caste. And Zud himself will tell
  you that in proclaiming me to the people, I have forbidden him to name me
  other than a teacher&mdash;more than a man like themselves."</p>

  <p>"Hai!" said Robur. "You have done this, Jason! Did Jadgor know, it would
  change his stand I think. My father's attitude in this matter grieves me. Let
  me be your mouthpiece in this to bring understanding to his mind."</p>

  <p>Croft considered. In so far as he could see, it could do no possible harm
  for the Aphurian king to realize that he was seeking no material glory beyond
  the life with Naia he had planned. That, he felt, was glory enough to pay for
  all he had done or might do in the future, if it could be attained. He
  nodded. "Speak, Rob, if you like," he answered. "I am, I confess, more or
  less disturbed by your father's manner and his words, not for myself so much
  as for Tamarizia. I would see no split in the nation. I would see her stand
  proud in her strength, yet guilty of no aggression&mdash;ready to defend
  herself, yet not wishing to attack unless assaulted first, broadening in
  wisdom and knowledge rather than in lands gained by the conquest of the
  sword. Speak if you will, Rob, if thereby we may turn Jadgor from what seems
  to me a dream of personal power, back to that wish for the strength of all
  Tamarizia, which held place in his heart, when I knew him first."</p>

  <p>Robur sighed. "Teacher you may well be called, Jason," he said in a tone
  of accord with Croft's remarks. "Jadgor's name on every lip has been to
  Jadgor's spirit like wine to a strong man's flesh&mdash;nor do I myself think
  Zud has any wish to interfere with the affairs of state through proclaiming
  you Mouthpiece of Zitu, even though my father appears to fear some such thing
  himself. Wherefore I shall tell him of what you have said, if I may. And of
  this other matter also I shall speak. In that Naia has yielded you her mouth,
  has felt your arms about her, who are not of her blood; to Jadgor's mind,
  there lies a disgrace."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded again. "Yet would he have given her to Kyphallos, the
  plaything of Zollaria's unclean woman&mdash;the master of dancing girls, my
  friend." His tone grew heavy, as he recalled the inconsistency of Jadgor's
  course.</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;I know," Robur replied. "But that would have been in
  marriage."</p>

  <p>For a moment it was in Croft's mind to retort quickly that the degradation
  of a loveless union could not be legalized in the sight of Zitu by any words
  of a priest. But he checked the impulse. "There can be no marriage between
  Naia and myself until it is brought about by her as well as my wish."</p>

  <p>"Failing which she will become Gayana," Robur said and looked full into
  Jason's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Which you do not like yourself," Croft responded, recalling the words Zud
  and he had heard the man before him speak in the palace room. "Which, should
  it happen would deprive me of all I have labored in sincere purpose to
  gain&mdash;that which I think Zitu himself is inclined to permit&mdash;since
  he has permitted also that I dwell in the spirit inside Jasor of Nodhur's
  flesh."</p>

  <p>"Aye, by Zitu, I see it!" Robur exclaimed. "Were it said to her, by one to
  whom she would scarce fail to give ear&mdash;then&mdash;perhaps she would see
  it too. Jason&mdash;Gaya, my wife, has before this had a hand in this affair
  of your love. Could she prevail upon my cousin to listen&mdash;" "Rob!" Croft
  caught an almost quivering breath as he spoke the word. He rose and began a
  slow pacing of the floor. But presently he paused and once more faced the
  crown prince.</p>

  <p>"At least," he said, "she returns by Jadgor's command to Himyra. Let Gaya
  speak with her, friend of my heart, to whom my heart is shown, and prevail
  upon her to remain outside the pyramid until she has taken time to think.
  Myself, I told her I could explain if the chance were mine. Rob, you and Gaya
  your wife will do this?" -"Aye," Robur declared, rising also. "Be not cast
  down in your heart. Inside fourteen suns I shall be governor in
  Aphur&mdash;and I shall see to it that Jadgor understands much which now he
  does not understand&mdash;also, that Naia does not go to the pyramid in
  Himyra. I shall speak with Magur himself. Speak of this with Zud, Jason. Have
  him give tablets into my hands to Magur from himself, advising against an
  immediate action. Then once I am in the palace, Jason, my friend, we shall
  reopen the Himyra shops, and set the melting furnaces flaring, and make many
  things for Tamarizia's welfare&mdash;even to this machine which flies without
  moving its wings," His face lighted, and his nostrils flared at the pictures
  in his brain.</p>

  <p>"With you, my brother, and with Zitu it rests, then," Croft said, and the
  two men struck palms as once on the day of their first meeting they had
  struck in friendship's pledge.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; SCARLET BLOSSOMS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ALL Zitra was en fte. All morning men and women in gala
  attire, rich and poor and middle class, even the blue men and women of
  Mazzerian extraction, the serving class of Tamarizia where their parents had
  been slaves, had been thronging into that immense central square of the
  island city, whose pavement was a tessellated expanse of rock crystal white
  and gold.</p>

  <p>Always Croft had marveled at the beauty of the imperial capitol since
  first he saw it. Himyra&mdash;the red-walled queen of Aphur, brooding oh the
  banks of the yellow Na, he had thought a dream of Babylonian splendor when
  first he came to Palos. Himyra he would always love, because it was there he
  had first seen Naia outside its gates. But Zitra surpassed it in the point of
  artistic magnificence. Himyra was a city of red and white, of palaces, parks
  and terraces along the river, studded with shrubs and trees. Zitra was a city
  of white and silver and crystal and gold&mdash;a thing undreamable unless
  once seen&mdash;and even so more like the city of a dream.</p>

  <p>About the square, where, on the morning of the third day after Croft had
  awakened from what he considered his final trip to earth, a huge platform had
  risen overnight, the populace ranged themselves, close packed. The scene was
  brilliant in a degree. From the tops of the structures facing the. square,
  built mainly of the predominating white stone used in constructing the city,
  and even its walls, canopies and streamers of azure blue and scarlet had been
  stretched as a protection against the sun and its midday heat. They made of
  the square a temporary auditorium of enormous size, into which the people
  jostled with a babel of voices, a soft yet vast shuffling of feet. Only at
  one point was an opening in the billowing covering of the canopies left.</p>

  <p>There at high noon a ray of the sun would strike through and lie on the
  platform in the center of the square.</p>

  <p>Soldiers of the Imperial Guard, in metal greaves, short-skirted tunics,
  and breast-plates, armed as in former days, not with rifles, but with short
  swords, spears, and shields, since this was for piercing flesh. There were
  the laborers in their tawny smocks, their hair cinctured by a golden or
  copper band, supporting the draped cloth which protected their necks in labor
  from the sun. And beyond them were the tradesmen with their women, taking on
  a still more brilliant appearance according to the dictates of taste which
  had clad them in various shades and colors.</p>

  <p>And again, nearest the dais was a rippling band of color marking the noble
  caste&mdash;men and women of station and wealth. And here gorgeous might
  describe the play of colors, the flash and glint of jewels and costly metals,
  the stately waving of plumes, the flicker of stalwart limbs, of white arms
  and snowy breasts and shoulders, the iridescent shimmer of diaphanous gauze
  scarfs. These were the select of the Zitran population. Each gnuppa-drawn
  carriage that whirled up to the end of the streets disgorged its recumbent
  passengers from the couchlike seats on which they reclined as they rode, and
  then retried.</p>

  <p>By degrees the square became utterly packed save for a space about the
  platform maintained by more of the Imperial Guard, and an alley running
  toward the mouth of a single street. The hour crept on. Through the canopy
  the sun blazed dimly. Water-bearers with bottles made from the hide of the
  tabur&mdash;an animal widely raised, with the fleece of a sheep and the
  general shape of a hog&mdash;passed through the square, sprinkling the
  pavement to cool the air, doubly heated by the outer temperature and the
  multitude of bodies packed into so close a space. Never had there been a
  greater concourse or a more brilliant in the history of the state. Indeed, in
  all the annals of the nation, no more auspicious date would appear.</p>

  <p>This day marked what might be regarded as a new era in national affairs.
  The Zollarian war was done. Tamarizia was stronger than ever before in the
  memory of man, and a new and more liberal government than any they had known
  was to be adopted within the next few days. And as though that were not
  enough, it was common knowledge that Zitu had sent the nation a teacher for
  their welfare; to greet and acclaim him they were gathered here.</p>

  <p>Well might the crowd be in holiday attire and humor. Well, as it waited,
  might its blended voices rise in a cheerful fashion, a ceaseless diapason of
  sound, changing as there came a blast of brazen trumpets, and Tamhys appeared
  in magnificent silver harness, to a cheer.</p>

  <p>Silver studded with diamonds were the casings upon his calves; silver was
  the cuirass upon his breast, whereon in azure-colored stones in the circle
  enclosing an equilateral cross, sign of Hiranur, was blazoned forth. Silver
  was his helmet, and white as purity itself his tossing plumes. Even the hair
  upon his head, mark of his years, was silver, as he came down the alley left
  open, between his guards, and mounted the dais and seated himself upon a
  silver chair.</p>

  <p>Then from without, as the cheering subsided, there came a sound of harps,
  and in the mouth of the alley down which Tamhys had passed, the head of a
  procession appeared.</p>

  <p>First came the harpers themselves, white clad, marching in ranks of fours.
  And back of them appeared a litter borne by the brown-clad lay brothers of
  the Zitran pyramid. Of burnished copper was the litter, inlaid with a silver
  filigree, and curtained with fluttering draperies of an azure, silklike
  fabric. From within it, as it advanced behind the harpers, Zud's old eyes
  peered.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the dais it was placed, and the high priest of Zitu
  emerged, mounting the steps, while a sudden silence fell across the multitude
  assembled, a reverend figure in his azure robes with the scarlet cross ansata
  on his breast. He saluted Tamhys and took a second silver chair, leaving a
  vacant seat between the emperor and himself.</p>

  <p>And now, as the harpers arranged themselves and struck the strings of
  their instruments in perfect unison, and Zud's litter was swept aside, a
  second litter appeared. '</p>

  <p>It was of silver, and its bearers, giant blue men of Mazzer, well-nigh
  staggered beneath its weight. A sigh, almost a gasp, ran through the
  assemblage. Zud had been borne by priests, but&mdash;the Mouthpiece of Zitu
  was carried by men&mdash;the serving class of the Tamarizian state. Always a
  people quick to recognize the involved symbolism of an occurrence, few of
  those present failed to understand Jason's intent in the manner of his
  appearance&mdash;that thereby he implied that he came to them, not as a
  spiritual teacher, but as a teacher of men.</p>

  <p>And then silence came down once more as the litter was placed before the
  steps of the dais and Zitu's Mouthpiece appeared, and the harps died, and the
  figure in its azure draperies, whereon flared both the cross and the wings of
  Azul, mounted slowly to that vacant seat between Tamhys and Zud, the high
  priest.</p>

  <p>The crowd jostled, straining forward to see the better, and then settled
  themselves once more to attention as Zud rose.</p>

  <p>He lifted a hand, commanding silence. In his other hand he carried a long
  silver stave topped with the looped cross. He began speaking at once in the
  simple fashion which characterized most of the Tamarizian ceremonials:</p>

  <p>"Men and women of Zitra and of all Tamarizia, give ear to Zud the high
  priest's voice, through which it is given to announce to you one who comes
  among you as teacher, endowed with a wisdom passing the knowledge of Zud or
  any other among you, by Zitu's grace.</p>

  <p>"Jason, as he is named, cometh to instruct the people on whom Zitu
  smiles,' as a sign that his pleasure is in his people, and shall remain while
  they are obedient to his laws.</p>

  <p>"Mouthpiece of Zitu is Jason, and shall be so known while he shall remain
  among as, and afterward, when the spirit within his body shall have been
  withdrawn. Exalted he is by the knowledge which Zitu hath seen fit to instill
  into his mind. Worthy of honor is he from all true men. Yet is he man as thou
  art, and to him shall no knee bend. Obedience and respect alone are his due.
  I, Zud, the high priest, have said it. Let all men regard the Mouthpiece of
  Zitu as his brother as well as his friend."</p>

  <p>As Zud paused a second ripple ran through the crowd, a sibilance of
  whispers. Croft looked down into the nearest rows of uplifted faces and
  encountered Jadgor's own.</p>

  <p>The Aphurian king sat with arms folded, staring directly toward him, his
  dark face distorted by a frown. The glances of the two men met and held for
  the merest instant. Croft's was steady. Jadgor's repellent, a voiceless
  challenge more than anything else. Croft turned his own glance deliberately
  away, sensing that in whatever he might attempt in the near future he would
  meet antagonism from Aphur's king. His eyes fell on Lakkon with his
  countenance somber, and on Robur, just beyond. The crown prince met his
  regard fully and shook his head. In the gesture, and the expression of his
  strong face, there was all the poignancy of a groan. It came over Croft that
  in whatever he may have said to his father since their conversation three
  days before, Robur had failed.</p>

  <p>But he gave over such considerations as once more the harps rang out. He
  became aware of a spot of sunlight on the platform directly before the chair
  whereon he sat&mdash;almost, indeed, at his feet. Even as he watched it
  seemed creeping closer&mdash;and the harps were thrumming, thrumming
  sweetly&mdash;and the buzz of the vast assembly was once more falling
  still.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the blended voices of a female chorus rang out, rising and
  falling in rhythmic fashion in perfect time to the harps. Down the alley came
  a group of vestals bearing flowers in their hands. Clad all in white were
  they, save for a cincture of golden tissue that ran about the neck, down
  between the breasts, and fastened in front like a sash with pendant ends,
  hanging in a golden fringe to the edge of the knee-Iength skirt. Their hair
  fell about their rosy faces and bared left arms and shoulders, wholly
  unrestrained save for a silver cincture about the head. Singing, they came on
  with a swing and flash of their bared and tinted feet and dimpled knees.</p>

  <p>And as they came there flashed into Croft's mind a recollection of the
  first ceremonial of the noontide hour of contemplation and prayer he had
  witnessed, not in Zitra, but in Himyra, the first day he had been on
  Palos.</p>

  <p>In a way this was like it, save that then the vestals had sung and danced
  before the statue of Zitu himself&mdash;the statue of a man with a face
  divinely firm and strong, with purity and compassion written large in its
  every line. That figure had been portrayed as seated on a throne. And the
  rays of the noontide sun had shone through an aperture in the roof upon it,
  bathing it in pure light. With an inward gasp Croft began to
  understand&mdash;his own position, the nearness of the spot of sunlight
  before him, the position of the chair in which he sat. Zitu was the God of
  Tamarizia&mdash;and he was Zitu's Mouthpiece&mdash;and the sunlight was over
  his knees now. He felt its warmth.</p>

  <p>"Behold the Mouthpiece of Zitu!" Zud's voice.</p>

  <p>Croft sensed rather than saw the congregation rising&mdash;the vestals
  deployed to right and left in front of the dais, kneeling, holding their
  floral sprays toward him in extended hands. He became conscious that the spot
  of sunlight had moved again, was bathing him from head to foot now in its
  golden rays, was shimmering from a thousand facets of the jewels that etched
  the cross and the wings of Azil on his breast.</p>

  <p>The Gayana burst into a triumphal song:</p>

  <p>"Hail, Mouthpiece of the Omnipotent One, Of Him from Whom nothing is
  hidden, To Whom all things are known. , Hail, Mouthpiece of Zitu; ' Hail,
  Dispenser of Knowledge; Hail, all hail, teacher, To whom those things
  permitted of Zitu, are known!"</p>

  <p>The chant ended. The singers rose. In a scented shower the floral sprays
  rained at the feet of him who sat on the silver chair with the sunlight on
  his face.</p>

  <p>Croft's senses reeled. The vast concourse faded from his vision. The
  flowers fell about him unheeded. The graceful forms of the Gayana who
  showered them toward him grew into a blur. His vision seemed to narrow,
  contract, focus upon a single point, shutting out all else, making all else
  as though it were not, leaving him staring, staring at one single goldframed
  face.</p>

  <p>Naia. She was there before him&mdash;her blue eyes meeting his own in an
  almost angry blaze. Naia&mdash;clad as a vestal, in white, bearing a spray of
  flowers in her hands.</p>

  <p>Then, as their glances met, and Croft's breath caught in his throat, she
  lifted the cluster of blossoms and threw it&mdash;threw it, not tossed it, so
  that it struck full against his breast, rather than fell at his
  feet&mdash;struck, not as a floral offering might strike were the distance of
  its throwing misjudged, but with a positive, definite force that hinted of
  some weighty object concealed within its crimson mass, and fell to the dais
  with a petal-muffled thud, leaving a tiny spot on Croft's flesh that tingled
  as though the scarlet flowers had been the fingers of a licking
  flame&mdash;as though their touch had seared him through the fabric of his
  robe.</p><a id="pic2"
        name="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>By an effort he sat unmoved, unchanged in his position, giving no sign,
  holding his eyes on the haughty face of the white-clad woman before him,
  reading upon her smiling lips not the placid expression of the ceremonial
  that held her retreating sisters as they drew back to either side of the
  dais, but the curl of scorn, of. contempt; so that the contact of the cluster
  of red blossoms came to seem to him as a slap in the face&mdash;a
  deliberately planned and executed blow. Nor to his whirling senses was that
  the worst.</p>

  <p>His chest heaved in a well-nigh stifled effort at control as he
  contemplated the lull meaning of her presence in the Gayana's dress. Naia a
  vestal&mdash;Naia&mdash;given to Ga! The thought slowed his heart for a
  moment and sent it racing into a wild, ungoverned, suffocating series of
  madly protesting beats.</p>

  <p>Naia become Gayana&mdash;Naia forming a part of the chorus which acclaimed
  his new-found rank&mdash;Naia hurling these scarlet blooms, as red as her
  heart's blood, or his, against him as a farewell act, a sign, a tacit message
  that, in so far as he was concerned, it might as well be her blood which lay
  red on the dais at his feet; that she might as well have died; that to him,
  from now on, she was lost. The thought sickened him, appalled, blotted out
  everything save itself so that for a moment, despite the sunlight which fell
  upon him, he had the sensation of an enveloping darkness that threatened to
  rise up and engulf him. He began to tremble. Tremor after tremor of emotion
  seized and shook him. And then Zud touched him on the arm. The ordeal was
  over. A strange babble of voices assailed his ears. He realized that the vast
  assemblage was cheering him, and in quite automatic fashion he bowed.</p>

  <p>The action roused him to some extent. Once more he caught Jadgor's eye,
  dark, piercing, filled with menace, as the Aphurian turned away in a haughty
  fashion and, followed by Lakkon and his son, began to edge his way through
  the departing throng.</p>

  <p>"Thy litter awaits thee." Zud's voice was in his ear.</p>

  <p>He saw that the blue men of Mazzer had indeed brought the great silver
  palanquin into position opposite the dais steps. But even so he took time for
  one word with Zud.</p>

  <p>"The maiden&mdash;she has become Gayana?"</p>

  <p>"Nay!" He met Zud's eyes and found within them comprehension. "She but
  asked a part in their ranks, and, being virgin, it was granted."</p>

  <p>Not Gayana&mdash;not yet&mdash;not yet. Croft's heart leaped again into
  freer action. But why had she asked to be given a place in the ranks of the
  vestals who had hailed him Mouthpiece of Zitu? He stiffened. Why save to cast
  that bunch of scarlet blossoms, which had stung his flesh, against him? He
  recalled now that it had stung him when it struck&mdash;had stung his flesh
  even as Naia's expression had stung his spirit. Why had it struck with such
  unerring certainty the wings of Azil, on his breast? What had it contained
  save the crimson flowers of which it seemed to consist? What was it had
  directed its course&mdash;weighted it until its blow was a blow indeed,
  delivered sure and straight?</p>

  <p>He glanced down. The thing still lay there, a brilliant spot of color
  among all the floral tributes at his feet. On impulse he stooped and caught
  it up and carried it with him, a flame-colored thing against his blue robes,
  as he descended the steps.</p>

  <p>He reached the litter, and paused again as his ear was assailed by a
  single, quickly caught-in breath. His head turned. Once more his gaze
  encountered a pair of fixed pansy-purple eyes. The vestals waited in double
  ranks, one on each side of the dais. Naia of Aphur stood among them, one
  white hand lifted and pressed against her body, to the left of the golden
  cord that ran down and cinctured her garment between her breasts. And it
  seemed, in that instant, to Jason Croft that her eyes dwelt not so much upon
  himself as on the flowers in his hand.</p>

  <p>He gave no sign, however, as he entered the litter and felt it lifted into
  tilting, swaying motion. He took with him that final vision of Naia, caught
  in a startled posture, of her parted lips, of a something like anguish in her
  eyes. Like the flowers in his gripping fingers, that picture was caught in
  his brain.</p>

  <p>Swiftly the Mazzerians bore him out of the square and into a street toward
  the bulk of the pyramid. The streaming crowds gave way before them and stood
  waiting while they passed. Then, and then only, did Croft seek to learn the
  mystery of the flowers Naia had thrown. Then and then only did he thrust his
  fingers into their blood-red mass and grope amid their stems for something he
  knew was hidden there&mdash;though he knew not what.</p>

  <p>His search was rewarded almost at once. His fingers encountered a hard
  object buried among the stalks of the flowers, and he drew it forth. It was a
  silver medallion, bearing a raised figure of Azil, the angel of life, and
  surrounded by blood-red stones, such as Tamarizian then gave to the women to
  whom they were betrothed.</p>

  <p>Croft recognized it at a glance. He took it and laid it on his palm, and
  sat staring at it as the litter swung along. He had ordered it especially
  made, and given it to Naia himself at the end of the Zollarian war. Like the
  maids of her nation, she had worn it on her girdle as a sign that to one man,
  and one alone, Azil had set his seal upon her. And to-day she had flung it
  from her, against the wings of Azil himself, which Croft wore on his
  breast.</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking the action. It was repudiation. It was the same as
  though her lips had uttered the declaration that henceforth she would no
  longer guard for him that shrine of mortal life which was herself.</p>

  <p>Croft's lips writhed into a strange smile. He recalled how the thing had
  pained when it struck above his heart.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">IX. &mdash; ROBUR'S INVITATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JADGOR was elected over Tammon by an overwhelming majority.
  Robur became governor of Aphur as a matter of course. In Cathur, Mutlos
  gained the lead largely because the populace still remembered the treason
  intended by Kyphallos of Scythys's house, and refused to vote for the dead
  king's younger son. This was the major result of the elections, so far as
  Croft was concerned.</p>

  <p>Before it was held, however, several things had occurred. Naia and her
  father, Jadgor and his son, left Zitra the day of Jason's proclaiming, in a
  motor-driven galley. Robur contrived an interview with Croft before he
  left.</p>

  <p>Croft in the meantime had seen Zud as soon as he returned to the pyramid,
  and showed him the jeweled medallion, and narrated to him the manner in which
  it had been returned. At the end he requested a letter to Magur such as Robur
  and he had discussed, asking the Himyra priest to advise delay, provided Naia
  sought admission to the vestal ranks.</p>

  <p>The tablets of wax whereon Zud wrote his commands Croft gave to Robur, and
  the two friends gripped hands.</p>

  <p>"Jadgor had turned his face from you," Robur said. "Always has he been of
  stubborn mind. But, by Zitu, once I am in Himyra's palace, there will be a
  place for you, my friend, wherein we will work out your strange designs!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Croft replied, sensing readily enough that Robur's interest in the
  construction of new implements of commercial and industrial progress was
  intense, and intending fully to carry out his plans in regard to Tamarizia in
  so far as he might with or without Jadgor's favor.</p>

  <p>And then he changed to the subject nearest his own heart. "Your cousin
  goes with you, Rob?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," Robur declared. "She yields to Jadgor's command, saying one may
  forget herself no less in Himyra than in Zitra's pyramid. Yet strengthen your
  heart, man of earth. These tablets I have from Zud to Magur, and in Himyra is
  Gaya, to whom, I believe, my cousin will open her heart. At present the maid
  is overwrought, and Jadgor's attitude toward you does not strengthen your
  case." "You spoke with him concerning those things we discussed three suns
  ago?" Croft questioned.</p>

  <p>"Aye, and to small avail." Robur frowned. "His stand is, you should have
  told them to him, rather than to Zud, at first. You will remember how Zud
  swayed Tamhys before the Zollarian war in your favor. Jadgor refused to
  accept it other than that there is an understanding between the high priest
  and yourself."</p>

  <p>"Then must our works convince him since our words fail," said Croft.
  "Robur, my friend, a safe and pleasant journey. May Kronhur, ruler of the
  oceans, provide you a peaceful path to Himyra's gate. Make my salutations to
  the gentle Gaya, whom I trust I may ere long greet. In her hands and yours,
  Robur, is carried Jason's fate."</p>

  <p>"It shall be carefully carried, by Zitu!" Robur promised. "Robur strikes
  not his hand in friendship lightly. Soon in Himyra shall he greet you, and we
  shall work. And"&mdash;suddenly he smiled&mdash;"see you not that Naia
  herself will be in Himyra&mdash;wherefore once you are come again to Aphur,
  the same red walls shall encircle you both?"</p>

  <p>"Hai!" Croft's eyes lighted at the mere suggestion, and he gave vent to a
  somewhat nervous laugh. And then he sobered. "But hold! Jadgor elected, will
  not Lakkon and his daughter come to Zitra?"</p>

  <p>"Scarcely." Robur looked full into his companion's eyes. "I think she will
  not look with favor on life in Zitra in her present mind."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded in comprehension. "Zitu spare you, Rob," he said, "for I need
  you in my work."</p>

  <p>And Robur, always quick in his appreciation of humor, laughed.</p>

  <p>Yet, though Croft had spoken lightly at the last, he watched the Aphurian
  depart with a mind which was deeply troubled, not only by Naia's attitude
  toward himself and her return of the betrothal jewel, but as well by the
  defection of Jadgor, on whose major support he had counted much for success
  in his future plans. Indeed, just then it seemed to Croft that those plans
  were of little account and his entire future happiness marred.</p>

  <p>Like many men of large mind, he suffered the pang of realization that
  lesser minds, because of their limitations, must fail to follow his own, that
  small natures must fall short of a full appreciation of a greater, simply
  because of an inability to measure the broader character by any standard of
  their own. He was meeting for the first time in a degree that thing known as
  the ingratitude of men, which every leader of men or nations must meet at
  times. And the taste was bitter in his mouth.</p>

  <p>He took out the jewel and sat looking at it, holding it displayed or shut
  up in a clenched palm for hours, until the sun sank and twilight crept into
  the embrasure of the room, and a lay brother, slipping in to light the oil
  sconces on the wall, brought word that Zud desired speech with him alone.</p>

  <p>Whereupon Croft rose and watched the wicks flare forth, and suddenly threw
  up his head and took a long breath. His mind went back to his talk with Robur
  three days before. They had spoken of electric lights. Why not?
  Work&mdash;work&mdash;that was the antidote for mental pain&mdash;to
  work&mdash;to throw one's self into a very frenzy of stubborn endeavor and
  drown the mental woe in a physical weariness, an actual tire of the brain.
  Work! He stretched forth his arms. He would work, work&mdash;he would show
  Tamarizia wonders such as she had never known. He would show Jadgor. He would
  bring the haughty Aphurian to his knees by force of sheer knowledge and what
  it wrought. He would compel him, force him to seek his, Croft's, favor,
  because he could ill afford to do anything else. And&mdash;he smiled
  grimly&mdash;he would do it with the aid of Jadgor's son&mdash;so soon as the
  elections were over and he might go to Himyra, where Robur had said there
  would be a place." His eyes lighted and his lips grew firm. He made his
  resolve. His moment of first mental travail was past. He put the jewel away
  inside his robes and waited for Zud's coming with an expression of fresh
  resolve.</p>

  <p>For four days thereafter he remained in constant company with Zud. Two
  things occupied his time&mdash;the instruction of the high priest in the
  mysteries of astral control, at first compelling the projections by his own
  will. Later Zud gained a minor success for himself, a thing he accomplished
  quickly because of his great desire to learn, and Croft took up certain
  social reforms he had long had in mind.</p>

  <p>A more general education was the first of these. At Scira in Cathur,
  Tamarizia had maintained a national school. This, however, was for the
  patronage of the rich. Among the masses little education was known. Croft
  decided at once to alter this. To Zud he outlined a scheme for a general
  system of schools. Assisted by the high priest, he drafted a provisional
  alphabet, to which the hieroglyphic characters not unlike those of the Maya
  inscriptions in Central America lent itself with little change. Already in
  Himyra he had constructed a form of printing press for large character work.
  Now he took up the subject of perfecting and elaborating this to the ponder
  of Zud, whose enthusiastic approbation he instantly gained. He thought the
  matter of the schools might be easily arranged. The national school was under
  the patronage of the church. Most of the priests were educated in it.
  Teachers could be drawn from their ranks; and if the matter were carefully
  broached, both Jason and Zud felt inclined to believe that the move would
  meet with little opposition from Jadgor at first&mdash;especially if the
  suggestion came from some such one as Mutlos, governor of Cathur, whom Zud
  would see was properly approached by the faculty of the national school,
  rather than by Zud or Croft.</p>

  <p>Late on the afternoon of the fourth day, however, Croft went to his own
  quarters, loosened his clothing, and laid himself down on the golden couch.
  There had been time for Jadgor's galley to have reached Himyra, as he
  knew&mdash;time for Naia to have gone either to her own home or the palace,
  as Jadgor and her father had elected. Closing his eyes and fixing his mind on
  the red-walled city of Aphur, he brought all his will to bear upon his one
  desire, and projected his astral entity to Himyra in a flash.</p>

  <p>It lay beneath him as he had seen it the first day he came to Palos, a
  far-flung circuit of walls&mdash;the farther lost in a heat haze until it
  appeared no more than a ruddy shadow through a shimmering veil&mdash;spread
  out on either side of the river Na, inside its banks of cut stone, its quays,
  whereon at night the fire-urns flared red at the foot of the terraces and
  shone redly on the yellow waves. Magur's pyramid&mdash;red with its ringing
  band of white, to mark the quarters of the Gayana&mdash;with its white temple
  of Zitu, jutted up across the river from the vast white pile of the palace,
  and on either side as far as the eye could reach along the crest of the river
  terrace stretched the palatial homes of the noble or rich.</p>

  <p>There was almost a sense of homecoming in the sight, and Croft experienced
  a thrill as he willed himself swiftly toward a huge red palace set well back
  from the street&mdash;the city home of Lakkon, advisor to the king.</p>

  <p>To-day the doors stood open, and he passed into the major court, where
  flowers, shrubs, and even small trees grew between the divisions of a
  pavement of transparent rock crystal, cut into geometrical blocks, beneath a
  roof of movable sections of glass.</p>

  <p>The court itself was two stories in height in the prevailing custom, with
  a staircase ascending to the surrounding balcony at either end. These were of
  a lemon-yellow stone like onyx, save that it was not veined. The pillars of
  the balcony and the rest of the interior was in white. A low-growing hedge
  enclosed the central portion of the crystal floor, whereon Baska, the
  Mazzerian major-domo, who had startled Croft the first time he saw his blue
  skin, was once more exhibiting his magnificent form and peculiar pigmentary
  endowments with amazing frankness while he trimmed the hedge.
  Maia&mdash;Naia's own personal maid&mdash;in an equal state of unabashed
  nature, was sprawled, watching on a red wood couch.</p>

  <p>So much Croft saw at a glance before he turned away, judging, from the
  very nature of the servants' careless manner, that Lakkon and his daughter
  had not yet arrived.</p>

  <p>The palace, then. He willed himself toward it, entered it through the main
  gates between the huge carved figures of the winged doglike creatures set up
  on either side, their front legs supporting webbed membranes from body to
  paw. He passed into a vast, red-paved court, where naked Mazzerian porters
  passed to and fro with metal sprinkling tanks strapped to their shoulders,
  and gnuppas, harnessed to flashing chariots, champed on their bits and
  pawed.</p>

  <p>To Croft, it was all an old story. He had lived in it once. He gave a
  single embracing glance to the white walls of the various government
  departments surrounding the huge red court, each with its guardian sentries
  at the doors, and fixed his mind on gaining the presence of Gaya, Robur's
  wife.</p>

  <p>For here he felt Naia would have gone had she come to the palace, as he
  believed seeking the company and companionship of a woman rather than any one
  else.</p>

  <p>In this his judgment proved right, as he found so soon as he reached the
  wing of the palace in which he had formerly lived. Here, in the portion given
  over to Robur and his wife, was a court containing a private bath, set in the
  center, surrounded on all sides by growing shrubs and flowers, the
  tessellated pavements about it dotted with chairs and couches of the wine-red
  wood and silklike canopies to offer shade against the Palosian sun. It was a
  favorite resting-place of Gaya in the afternoons, when, attended by her
  servants, she either bathed in the limpid, sun-warmed water or received such
  guests as might elect to pay a social call.</p>

  <p>On two of the red couches he found the women he had come in search of.
  They reclined beneath a yellow awning supported by standards, with a low
  table between them, holding small cakes, fruit conserves such as the women of
  Tamarizia affected, and crystal glasses, scarcely larger than a thimble,
  filled with an amber-colored wine.</p>

  <p>But it was to Naia Croft gave his major attention once he had reached the
  palace. She lay pale, her eyes shadowed by darkened circles beneath their
  lids, her features weary, drawn with what he recognized at a glance at a
  dangerous tension of the nerves. Her figure was draped in a robe of exquisite
  green, across the upper part of which a strand of her fair hair made a sheen
  of gold. To Croft she had never seemed more appealing than now, in this mood
  of acute distress. He glanced at Gaya, and found her eyes fixed in an anxious
  inspection of her companion's face.</p>

  <p>Abruptly Naia's breast swelled sharply and she spoke: "I shall become
  Gayana. There is nothing else."</p>

  <p>"Nay! Nay, daughter of Lakkon, thou are overwrought. Robur thinks not so,
  nor Jadgor, his father. To Lakkon there is none other, since your mother
  died, save yourself. Would leave him to finish his life alone?"</p>

  <p>Naia sat up upon the couch. "That was true," she returned in a tone gone
  bitter, "until this trouble came upon me. Now Lakkon holds me
  disgraced&mdash;in that I have yielded my lips to Zitu's Mouthpiece, against
  all the laws of custom for a woman of my caste. Yet, in Zitu's name, wherein
  was I to blame, who loved as never a woman loved before&mdash;who was asked
  in marriage by the one she loved, by one who had sworn, aye, and done many
  deeds to win her? In what did I wrong? How could I foresee that he was
  not&mdash;what&mdash;what he appeared?"</p>

  <p>"Nay," Gaya said, while Croft's soul quivered at this confession from the
  lips of the woman he loved above all else. "Say not that in any way were you
  to blame, Naia, fairest of Aphur's maids. For have you and I not spoken
  concerning your love ere this, and did you not first to me confess it, when
  you stood pledge to Cathur's heir, from whom this man of Zitu saved you?"</p>

  <p>"Man," Naia caught her up, interrupting quickly. "Say you that he is a
  man&mdash;Gaya, my friend&mdash;or is the-word but used as a means of
  expressions since you know not what to call him save as he seems?" "Nay, I
  mean man, child," Gaya returned. "Man he appears, and man he claims to be,
  and man he is. You know Robur for his friend. Much to Robur has he explained
  since he wakened from the last of his strange sleeps. Yet is he such a man as
  never was seen on Palos before; and though of mortal birth, as we are, yet
  was he not born on Palos, but of a woman on earth."</p>

  <p>"Earth?" Naia's eyes widened swiftly. "Aye&mdash;a different star from
  ours," Gaya replied.</p>

  <p>"Obur told you this?" An introspective expression crossed Naia's face.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;ere he brought you to me." "And he told Robur?"</p>

  <p>"Aye. He swore it by Zitu himself." Suddenly Naia struck herself upon the
  breast. "He told it to Robur&mdash;to your husband&mdash;to Jadgor's son! Why
  not to me?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"To Robur he swore he had meant to tell you ere you became his mate," Gaya
  rejoined. "Save that Zud learned these things from Abbu of Scira and spoke to
  you during his sleep, I feel assured he had done it at a proper time."</p>

  <p>She paused, and Naia turned her head. She sat staring, staring across the
  sun-kissed surface of the sunken bath. "Now I remember that he said to me
  after he awakened, when he came to me in the quarters of the Gayana, that he
  had somewhat to explain. What said he else?"</p>

  <p>"Strange things&mdash;things to madden the heart of a woman, as it seems
  to me," Gaya returned; "things to waken strange dreams in her soul, if true.
  To Robur he swore that to Palos he came because of you, because in you he
  knew the mate to whom his spirit cried out&mdash;that he remained on Palos to
  save you from Cathur and win you for himself, and to that end that he might
  claim you wholly, used Jasor's body when his spirit was drawn from his
  flesh."</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" The word came from Naia's lips as a strangled exclamation. She
  drew herself up on the couch until she sat tense in every quivering fiber of
  her being. "Now you have touched on the part of the matter I may not tolerate
  or understand. Granting that he says truth&mdash;that a spirit may enter
  the body of another and possess it, and cause it to live and breathe, and
  move as its own&mdash;can a maid consider a lover in such guise, surrendering
  to his embrace?"</p>

  <p>"Yet consider," said Gaya softly, with a widening of her eyes as though
  the spell of the subject were upon her fully; "try to measure if you can, my
  princess, a love so vast that it draws its mate across the space between the
  stars. Consider what this man's love must be that he forsakes that life to
  which he was born and comes in search of you&mdash;the one woman who fills
  his soul with longing; and consider, also, that after he entered Jasor's form
  it changed&mdash;that even Sinon declared he no longer resembled Jasor
  greatly. Seems it not to you that Jason's spirit has altered the elements
  that were Jasor's until they are as his own?"</p>

  <p>"Jason?" Naia faltered.</p>

  <p>"Aye. That was his name on earth. Also says he that it is the spirit
  within us which dwells in and makes us of the flesh. He says, and Zud
  supports him in saying that to the spirit the flesh is no more than to man is
  a house&mdash;a something he inhabits, makes use of, and finally lays
  aside."</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Naia stayed her. "Why&mdash;why were these things not said to me
  before&mdash;before&mdash;" She broke off, clasped her hands and crushed
  them together, struck them down against her sides. "Nay&mdash;it might have
  been," she went on, more to herself than to Gaya, "had I given the chance. He
  came to me, and I berated him with words. I was filled with pain; ^ my spirit
  was blinded with horror and despair. I thought only that I had been led to my
  own undoing&mdash;I knew not the truth.</p>

  <p>"Zud's words had well nigh unsettled my mind. Wherefore I prayed to Ga and
  Azil, and there was no answer. And then I prayed to Zilla, and even the angel
  of death turned away his face. Gaya, I am like one fallen into a pit from
  which there is no escape. Him I knew as Jasor&mdash;I loved with a glory of
  the spirit and a madness of the flesh. He was my master. His word was my law.
  My heart beat like a caged bird in his presence. My spirit faltered when he
  spoke to me. My flesh was as clay in the potter's hands to his touch. I was a
  slave, and my glory was in the slavery of my love. Save only Zitu, beyond him
  there was for me no god!"</p>

  <p>Once more she paused and sat panting, her bosom rising and falling, her
  nostrils aquiver, her lips compressed, while Croft yearned to her and this
  voicing of a love no less, as it seemed to him, than his love for
  herself.</p>

  <p>"Canst wonder, then," she went on after a moment, "with what gladness I
  gave him my pledge; with what joy in my thoughts of the future I wore upon my
  girdle the badge of Azil he placed within my hands as sign that I was
  his&mdash;that badge which, on the day of his proclaiming Mouthpiece of Zitu,
  I placed in a spray of flowers and hurled against his breast!"</p>

  <p>"Naia! Child!" Gaya half started up at the climax of her companion's
  words. "You did that&mdash;did he&mdash;understand?"</p>

  <p>Naia nodded slightly. "I think so. He&mdash;from the dais he carried the
  flowers I flung against him to his litter in his hand. Oh, Gaya&mdash;my soul
  died within me at that sight&mdash;would Zitu&mdash;the rest of me had died.
  I am alone, Gaya&mdash;alone. Alone, alone&mdash;the word tunes my every
  breath. Jadgor opposes my seeking the Gayana. My father looks on his name as
  through me disgraced. And I am tired, Gaya&mdash;tired&mdash;so very tired.
  And there is no rest. If only Zilla would hear me when I call him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aye, you are tired, poor child." Gaya rose, crossed to the other couch,
  and took the girl's golden head inside tier arms. "Come, talk no more at
  present. I shall call Bela, my own maid, who shall attend you. You shall
  bathe, and afterward she shall anoint your flesh with sweet-smelling oils,
  and you will sleep and awaken refreshed. She has a soothing touch beyond any
  I have ever found. She shall wait upon you." She reached out to the table and
  struck a small metal gong.</p>

  <p>"Refreshed," said Naia slowly. Once more her eyes were fastened on the
  sun-kissed water. "Aye, I shall bathe, gentle Gaya. I shall find rest in your
  pool."</p>

  <p>She rose slowly. Her eyes were wide; her face was very white. Turning, she
  walked to the edge of the sunken basin. For a moment she stood there in the
  attitude of one who listens.</p>

  <p>Her lips moved. "Zilla," she whispered and smiled.</p>

  <p>And then her voice raised, rang out sharply: "Zilla, I hear thy answer!"
  Her arms lifted, stretched upward. She plunged face downward into the pool
  and sank without a struggle into its transparent depths.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">X. &mdash; ASTRAL UNDERSTANDING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AND now began one of the most amazing parts of Croft's whole
  tale.</p>

  <p>He saw Naia sink. He knew the meaning of her words, her act. Her cry to
  Zilla, the Angel of Death, showed him clearly that she saw in the water the
  way of death for herself&mdash;read a new meaning into her words to Gaya,
  that here in the pool she would find rest. He saw the water close about her,
  saw her well-loved form sink down, down, cradled in the limpid water; down,
  down, a slender figure, as beautiful as a Tanagra statuette in its green
  robe, as it sank. He knew that indeed Zilla hovered close above
  her&mdash;knew she was drowning&mdash;that the element in which her figure
  was engulfed would, like the figurative lips of Zilla, soon suffocate her
  breath.</p>

  <p>And he was powerless, impotent, to do anything save watch what went on
  before his eyes. He could see, and know, and understand. He could suffer the
  most terrible agony of conscious comprehension, and&mdash;in his astral
  presence he could do nothing else. In his soul he writhed, cried out in a
  torment in which, like the despairing mind of the girl, he would have
  welcomed dissolution as a relief. But aside from that he was chained to a
  passive watching, was unable to make one single move toward the rescue of her
  expiring flesh.</p>

  <p>Not so Gaya, however. Nor did Robur's wife lose her head. Her
  comprehension of her companion's act was instant, and she cried aloud to the
  Mazzerian girl, who now appeared in answer to the summons of the gong. Then;
  without waiting for even the servant to reach her side, Gaya flung her own
  form into the pool in a cleanly executed dive. Bela followed her mistress a
  moment later, her blue figure cutting the liquid surface with hardly a
  splash. Both women were entirely at home in the water, and by the time Gaya
  had reached and seized Naia, who began instantly to struggle, Bela was at her
  side.</p>

  <p>The fight below the surface was brief. Croft saw Naia open her mouth. Her
  bosom expanded as though she gasped. And then she relaxed, and Robur's wife
  and the Mazzerian maid bore her quickly upward, supporting her head between
  them, and swimming with her toward a submerged flight of steps by which the
  pool was customarily entered. Reaching it, they lifted the limp body in its
  trailing robe, which clung to trunk and rounded limb more like a shroud of
  vegetation, a crinkled kelp born of the water itself, than a garment, and
  staggered with it from the pool to lay it on the pavement of the court.</p>

  <p>"Quickly!" Gaya cried as she knelt beside it. "Seek out Jadgor's physician
  and command his presence." Unmindful of her own soaked condition, she seized
  Naia's form and rolled her upon her face. Placing her hands on either side of
  the body close to where the ribs joined the spine, she threw her weight
  forward on extended arms, held so for the space of a long breath, and lifted
  herself once more upon her own flexed thighs.</p>

  <p>It was a form of artificial respiration she was practising, and Croft
  uttered a prayer for her success in his heart. And then&mdash;he forgot
  temporarily her continued efforts in the wonder of something else.</p>

  <p>Naia of Aphur was about to die. Croft knew it as certainly as he had ever
  known anything in his life. Because he saw her soul come forth as he had seen
  Zud's astral body after he had bidden it leave its fleshy habitation on the
  day he awakened from his sleep. Slowly, as Gaya lifted herself and sat back,
  it emerged from the figure on the ground. And as wonderful as was the form of
  Naia, so wonderful was its astral counterpart. Like an image of her beauty in
  every detail, it swam and hovered above her, still chained for the span of a
  breath by an almost invisible bond that wavered and tensed and threatened to
  break.</p>

  <p>And that breaking&mdash;the snapping of that soul cord&mdash;the
  counterpart of the union between the maternal substance and the body of the
  child in physical birth&mdash;spelled physical death. With its severance, as
  Croft knew, Naia would pass from the mortal plane to a wholly astral life.
  But more than that he knew that now it was within his province to take
  definite steps to preserve once more the woman he so wholly loved&mdash;that
  now at last he could act.</p>

  <p>Toward the lovely floating shape he compelled his own astral form until he
  floated with it face to face. "Naia&mdash;Naia&mdash;thou other part of me,"
  he thought rather than cried to her; "Naia&mdash;my beloved&mdash;hold.
  Return again to thy body. Go back."</p><a id="pic3"
        name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0801071h-images/Zitu-3.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>And he knew that she received the potent vibration his own soul gave out.
  For slowly the head of the floating figure, the dream shape which swung and
  glowed like an iridescent mist in the sunlight, turned its head toward
  him&mdash;seemed to regard him strangely with wide open, startled eyes.</p>

  <p>"Naia!" He sent his appeal to her again. "Naia, it is that Jason whom you
  knew as Jasor who commands that you return again to your flesh. In Zitu's
  name, beloved."</p>

  <p>The rainbow figure writhed. It seemed to quiver, to hesitate and sink
  slightly back toward the unconscious body beside which Gaya kept up her work,
  with darkly troubled eyes; so that there was some relaxing of that binding
  cord.</p>

  <p>"Jason!" Croft felt the thought impinge against him.</p>

  <p>"Jason, who loves you&mdash;who claims you&mdash;who shall claim you
  yet," he returned, driving each word into her perception with the full force
  of his will.</p>

  <p>"What do you here?"</p>

  <p>It was a question, a wondering interrogation. He answered it truly. "You
  know of my sleeps. In them my spirit leaves the body. It visits many places.
  Now sleeps my body in the Zitran pyramid, yet is my spirit present to watch
  over you and guard you. It was not Zilla called you into the pool, but your
  own troubled spirit, beloved. Go back into your body&mdash;in the name of the
  love you confessed to Gaya; go back."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;why&mdash;am I not myself?" a second question faltered to his
  perception.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are yourself always," he returned. "Yet this is the real you
  which speaks to the real me, beloved. Look beneath you, and tell me what you
  see."</p>

  <p>For a moment nothing was said as the form beside him turned down its
  eyes. And then a startled response: "Gaya&mdash;she bends and works beside a
  form&mdash;to&mdash;to which I seem in some way connected. It&mdash;Zitu!
  Azil! It is the form of one like myself!"</p>

  <p>"It is your own form, Naia," Croft told her; "the body in which all your
  life you have dwelt&mdash;the beautiful habitation of your spirit&mdash;which
  you cast into the pool in an effort to gain rest."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;" The diaphanous soul form began once more to
  tremble.</p>

  <p>"You are you&mdash;even as I am I," said Croft. "That body over which Gaya
  works is but the servant which has done your bidding, which, save you obey
  me, you condemn to death. Return to it before it is too late. I, Jason, who
  have met you midway between the body Azil gave you and Zilla's domain,
  command it. Between you and Zilla himself I stand as a barrier. Return to the
  form below you and give it breath."</p>

  <p>"How&mdash;how shall I return?" Again a question.</p>

  <p>"Wish it," said Croft. "Wish it as I desire to hold it in my arms and
  claim its love and yours."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I shall return." It was a promise. Croft thrilled at the victory
  he had won. "Yet hold!" He stayed her as slowly she began to sink closer to
  the form beneath them. "Again shall you leave it if I call you&mdash;leave it
  as now&mdash;to meet me as now you meet me, and return." For the thought had
  come to him that in this guise might he seek out her spirit and converse with
  it and teach it many things&mdash;seek it and hold it until such a time as
  events should straighten out the tangle in their affairs, and thereby watch
  over and guard her.</p>

  <p>"Now go, beloved. See with what a frenzy of hopeful endeavor Gaya works."
  From beside him that figure as fair as the play of sunlight through the prism
  of a fine mist vanished.</p>

  <p>Into his ears there stabbed the cry of a physical voice, upraised in
  triumph. It was Gaya speaking. "She lives! Thanks be to Zitu, she lives!"</p>

  <p>She bent and lifted the body, which rewarded her efforts with a gasping
  breath, and laid it on one of the red wood couches, caught up one of the tiny
  glasses of wine from the table, and forced its contents into Naia's
  mouth.</p>

  <p>Naia gasped. Her throat contracted sharply. She swallowed. Again and again
  her full chest swelled beneath her clinging robe. Some of the waxen pallor
  went out of throat and cheeks. Bela appeared running, with the physician
  behind her. He hurried to the couch and dropped his fingers to the patient's
  pulse.</p>

  <p>And now came Robur across the court toward the group beneath the yellow
  awning. He reached it and slipped his arm about Gaya's shaking shoulders,
  placing himself at her side. For now that the need of her presence of mind
  was lacking, she seemed completely exhausted and on the brink of tears.</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;she cried on Zilla and cast herself into the pool," she half
  spoke, half sobbed. "Beloved, she&mdash;she was dead to all
  seeming&mdash;but&mdash;I cried on Zitu, and worked above her, and
  now&mdash;she lives." The physician bowed. "The Princess Gaya has in truth
  done a most admirable piece of work."</p>

  <p>Naia's lips moved. "Jason," she whispered, "I&mdash;I have obeyed."</p>

  <p>"Hai!" Robur started. His eyes darted swiftly from the girl to his wife,
  and back to the physician. "What said she?" he asked. '</p>

  <p>"She dreams, doubtless," the physician made answer.</p>

  <p>But Croft knew she did not, and Robur frowned slightly as one
  perplexed.</p>

  <p>Naia opened her eyes. They stared up blankly at the yellow canopy
  overhead. Gaya bent above her.</p>

  <p>"Gaya!" she cried and lifted her slender arms and laid hold upon her. "Oh,
  Gaya, I&mdash;I dreamt that I&mdash;had died. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And suddenly she broke&mdash;broke utterly&mdash;and clung fast to the
  drenched form of the woman beside her, shaken by a storm of sobs.</p>

  <p>From the blended group Robur turned to Bela and the physician. "This is
  forgotten as though it had not been, man of healing," his voice came thickly.
  "By you and by Bela, it is as if it were not.</p>

  <p>I myself shall see that it reaches Lakkon's ears." He reached into a purse
  at his belt and extracted some pieces of silver, extending them to the
  doctor. "Your fee. What needs she else?"</p>

  <p>"Rest&mdash;quiet for perhaps a sun&mdash;no more." The physician accepted his
  payment with a second bow of respect.</p>

  <p>"See to it." Robur turned to Bela. "Go&mdash;and return with women to
  bear her to her apartment without delay."</p>

  <p>Then, as Bela ran once more from the court, he approached ''Naia and his
  wife.</p>

  <p>"Peace, Naia, my cousin," he said gently, yet with a narrowing of the
  eyes. "Know you not that Robur is friend to you and&mdash;Jason?" He paused
  for the barest space before the final word. The face he watched flushed
  slightly despite the sluggish return of the blood to her stagnant veins. For
  a single instant a strange expression burned in her purple eyes. "You say
  that you dreamed,' my cousin," Robur went on. "Praise be to Zitu, it was but
  a dream. Yet"&mdash;and now again he watched her very closely&mdash;"in
  waking you spoke Jason's name."</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;he sent me back," Naia of Aphur faltered. "In&mdash;in my dream
  I met him, and he showed me my body, with Gaya working beside it, and
  compelled me to return. It&mdash;was all&mdash;very strange." "Zitu!" Robur
  started. "A&mdash;strange dream indeed, my cousin," he said, with an equally
  strange expression on his face. To Croft it appeared that without fully
  understanding, his friend half suspected the truth.</p>

  <p>Bela and three other Mazzerian women now reappeared. They lifted the couch
  upon which Naia was lying, and bore it from the court into the palace and to
  a sumptuous apartment on the second floor. Walls, windows, and doors were
  hung in yellow draperies. A huge purple rug was on the floor. A copper couch,
  studded with amber jewels, stood ready to receive the patient. Caskets for
  clothing, tables and chairs and stools completed the appointments. Plainly,
  it was a room designed for women, as Croft knew at a glance, since in the
  center of the floor was one of the mirrorlike pools of shallow water, close
  to which stood a pedestal of silver, bearing the figure of Azil with extended
  wings.</p>

  <p>By a strange chance, as Naia was borne in, one of the Mazzerians struck
  against the beautifully carved figure. It tottered, swayed drunkenly on its
  standard, and fell into the pool.</p>

  <p>Naia cried out at the sight, and covered her eyes.</p>

  <p>Robur sprang forward and lifted the statue, setting it back on its base.
  "Fear not!" he exclaimed. "It is wholly uninjured. 'Tis a good augury, my
  cousin, I think. Life fell into the pool, and life comes forth unmarred." He
  smiled.</p>

  <p>Naia relaxed from her tension. Her eyes met his. "You are quick to read
  signs, my cousin," she faltered. "Perchance&mdash;you are right."</p>

  <p>The bearers set down her couch, and Gaya took charge. "Disrobe her," she
  commanded. "Bring sweet oils and massage her body and limbs. Cover her
  lightly, and do you, Bela, sit beside her, to supply her wants. Yet if sleep
  comes, permit her to rest. When I have changed my own garments I shall
  return."</p>

  <p>She left the apartment with Robur at her side. Croft followed, filled with
  a wonderful exaltation, since now at least he had come in contact with Naia's
  spirit as never before, and in a way which assured a repetition of the
  meeting on that plane when he desired. True, she regarded the experience now
  as no more than an exceedingly strange dream, but the mere fact that she
  remembered was proof sufficient to Croft that the effect he desired had been
  gained. To himself he made a promise that from now on, when conditions were
  suitable for the experience, she should dream again.</p>

  <p><BR>
AS for Robur, he was of the opinion that the Aphurian prince was not sure
  that Naia had dreamed at all. And the first words of his friend, once he was
  outside the door of the apartment where the serving maids ministered to his
  cousin, confirmed Croft's thought.</p>

  <p>"Thus," he began to Gaya as she turned to her own room, "does Jason prove
  his sayings truth."</p>

  <p>"What mean you?" Gaya paused.</p>

  <p>"That he stood between her and Zilla, to whom she called, before she flung
  herself into the pool," Robur said. "Heard you not her words that he sent her
  back&mdash;that she beheld her body beside which you knelt? And do you not
  recall that I told you he had explained to me that in his sleeps he left his
  own body even so, and gained knowledge by visiting other places in the
  spirit? By Zitu's grace, Jason was here when this occurred." "Here?" Gaya
  turned her eyes about her in an almost ludicrous fashion, and Robur
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;his spirit. In Zitra his body lies asleep. Yet here has spirit
  met spirit and his conversed with hers. By Zitu, but I had a fright! I had
  been to Magur with tablets from Zud which Jason gave me, and, returning, I
  heard Bela cry to another of the maidens that one had fallen into the pool.
  Gaya"&mdash;of a sudden he swept her into his arms&mdash;"my heart died, and
  I ran to find that my fears were vain."</p>

  <p>"As you might have known," said Gaya, smiling into his down-bent eyes.
  "Know you not that I learned to swim as a child?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," Robur admitted; "yet strange things happen, and never more on Palos
  than now. By Zitu, I must carry this to Lakkon's ears. He takes not the right
  stand with this troubled daughter of his. Go now and change your dress, my
  Gaya." He released her and went stalking off, his forehead furrowed with
  thought. And he sought out Lakkon.</p>

  <p>"My lord," he accosted him without other introduction, "have you thought
  of the meaning to you of Naia's loss?" "What mean you?"</p>

  <p>Lakkon turned in a flash. His face, darkened, and a quick, instinctive
  expression of pain leaped into his eyes. "Would you question my love for my
  daughter, Prince of Aphur? Know you not that in her very glance, her every
  movement, I see her mother as I knew and loved her first? And"&mdash;his
  voice gruff at first, grew unsteady&mdash;"know you not that I loved her
  aunt, my wife? What need of your question, then, Robur, son of Jadgor,
  since&mdash;should she go to the Gayana, shall she not to me be lost?" "She
  shall go not to the Gayana, I think," said Robur slowly. "Magur will advise against it."</p>

  <p>"How know you?" Lakkon asked.</p>

  <p>"He himself told me." Robur met his uncle's questioning gaze with a level
  glance.</p>

  <p>"You?" Plainly Lakkon was surprised. "You spoke with him about it?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," Robur made answer. "He told me he would advise against it at the
  present. Listen, Lakkon, my uncle." He went on and told him what had
  occurred. And, as he spoke, Lakkon's face took on a twitching, his breathing
  became heavy.</p>

  <p>"But she lives&mdash;she lives&mdash;Robur&mdash;she has passed this
  danger?" he questioned brokenly at the last.</p>

  <p>"Aye. And were her father to appear before her&mdash;were he to smile upon
  her," said Robur with evident meaning, "she were less apt to cry to Zilla
  again in the future, I think."</p>

  <p>"Aye." A quiver sat on Lakkon's mouth. For the moment he was wholly the
  father, no more the noble or the courtier. For the time his thought was of
  his child, her life and nothing else. "Aye, Robur&mdash;I have been remiss,
  and praise to Zitu that his lesson is by example and nothing worse. I&mdash;I
  shall go to her. I&mdash;I shall try to comfort her in this."</p>

  <p>"As you should." Robur inclined his head. "Go, and Zitu frame the wisdom
  of your speech."</p>

  <p>Lakkon went. He crept into the room where Bela sat and Naia lay relaxed on
  her couch. He went quite to it and sank on his knees beside it, and looked
  with misted eyes into her weary face.</p>

  <p>"Child of my loins," he quavered to her. "Child of thy mother, seek not to
  leave me again. Be thou the spring-time to my old age, the starlight for my
  eyes." "My father." Naia lifted a hand and laid it on his head. "That I
  sought to leave you was that it seemed to me best&mdash;that&mdash;that I
  was tired in body and spirit&mdash;that for me there seemed no place."</p>

  <p>"Thy place is in my heart," said Lakkon with a heavy, rasping sob.</p>

  <p>Slowly Naia drew the grizzled head toward her till it lay upon her
  shoulder. "I would go to our home in the mountains," she said, "and dwell
  there in quietude&mdash;and&mdash;rest."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">XI. &mdash; BLUE AND GOLD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOLLOWED now for Croft the weirdest wooing mortal ever
  dreamed, a sort of astral courtship, wherein what might perhaps be best
  described as the sublimated essence of Naia's being&mdash;that astral shell
  containing her conscious spirit, met and communed with his.</p>

  <p>To the man this period became a strange source of encouragement mixed with
  intervals of an ineffable delight. And the fact that to Naia herself, the
  hours so spent seemed as dreams rather than a thing of actual occurrence,
  disturbed him not in the least. He was content to let the truth develop in
  her soul by degrees, until it should at last be known as truth.</p>

  <p>On the second day after her despairing attempt against herself in the pool
  at the Himyra palace, and so soon as her own buoyant vitality had made her
  well-nigh her physical self, Naia departed for Lakkon's palace in the
  mountains of Aphur, across the desert from Himyra to the west. Renewed
  understanding with her father, plus an interview with Magur, in which the
  priest advised against her joining the Gayana, helped her in the resolve to
  withdraw for a time to that seclusion, a wish for which she had already
  expressed.</p>

  <p>She made the trip in the motor Croft had caused to be fashioned for her
  when the things were new on Palos, and had driven out to her mountain home
  himself. And with Maia, her maid, and Mitlos the Mazzerian majordomo, left
  always in charge of the palace, together with the great dog-like creature,
  Hupor, as her body-guard, she took up the course of restful days.</p>

  <p>Sometimes she lay for hours on a couch in the central
  court&mdash;sometimes she bathed in the sun-warmed water of a pool behind the
  palace&mdash;a thing constructed of a lemon-yellow stone in sides and
  bottom, and screened by a wall of white, overgrown with trailing vines.
  Sometimes she rode in the motor, driving it herself along the splendid
  Aphurian roads&mdash;as perfectly built as the roads of the ancient
  Romans&mdash;which on his first sight of them, had excited the admiration of
  Croft&mdash;roads that stretched throughout the nation; over which the huge
  sarpelca caravans passed.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, endowed with a splendid strength for all her slender grace, she
  climbed with Hupor at her side, among the hills. And many, many nights she
  sat in the sunken gardens, wherein the bathing-pool was placed, watching the
  three moons of Palos wheel across the sky, and thinking her own thoughts. It
  was Croft's purpose at this time to see that in the latter he lacked no
  part.</p>

  <p>Hence, on the night following her arrival, he visited her first, purposely
  choosing a late hour, since he wished her to be asleep and preferred to have
  his own action unknown just then, in the Zitran pyramid.</p>

  <p>And as he hoped, when he stole into her apartments, making ingress through
  an open window, he found her indeed asleep. The moonlight through a halfdrawn
  curtain showed her to him, stretched on a metal couch with the cloud of her
  loosened hair about her face. Coverings of silken fineness lay above her.
  Azil, with outstretched wings, seemed like some white guardian of her slumber
  on his pedestal beside the mirror-pool.</p>

  <p>Naia of Aphur! The woman of his soul. She lay here before him. Croft
  thrilled to the thought that she was his in spirit at least, as he was hers.
  He recalled her impassioned avowal of the love she had felt for him before
  old Zud's clumsy priestly blunder. And then he let the cry of his spirit
  steal forth.</p>

  <p>"Naia! It is Jason calling. Naia, my beloved&mdash;appear! "</p>

  <p>"Jason&mdash;I hear!"</p>

  <p>Like a wraith of dreams, it seemed that she stood before him&mdash;a form,
  a figure pure as a blade of silver, emitting a faint auric play of blue and
  gold. Man and woman they confronted one another, and the moonlight striking
  upon that divine something he had called from its lovely hand in his, and led
  her out through the window, where he had entered, under the moon and the
  stars.</p>

  <p>Out, out he led her. They were free as the winds on which it seemed they
  rode. Like a sheet of molten silver the pool in the garden lay beneath them.
  About them and beyond them spread the wide panorama of the wooded mountains,
  marked here and there by the bone-white windings of the road. Beneath them
  swam the wide expanse of the desert. Far off to the east and south, in a
  ruddy glow, the fire urns of Himyra flared.</p>

  <p>Croft turned his face to that of the shape beside him, and found it the
  face of a sleeper who sees visions, and knew that though the soul of Naia
  obeyed him, it was still asleep. "Art afraid?" he questioned gently.</p>

  <p>"Nay, Jason, I am not afraid."</p>

  <p>Some way the words afforded him a great pleasure, for he knew he would not
  have had fear in any circumstance whatever, in the spirit he regarded as the
  complement of his.</p>

  <p>"Thy father&mdash;would see him?" he questioned once more, deciding upon a
  further stretching of the astral cord.</p>

  <p>"Aye." Naia smiled.</p>

  <p>"Behold then!" said Croft, and willed himself toward Himyra, still keeping
  his companion's hand.</p>

  <p>The city glowed beneath them, its fire urns burning up and down the Na in
  double ranks. The place was white before them. Then&mdash;Lakkon lay
  stretched in slumber on a couch.</p>

  <p>"My father!" Naia left Croft's side and seemed to hover all blue and white
  and gold above him, until as though subconsciously he felt her presence,
  Lakkon's lips moved and he muttered: "Naia," in his sleep.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Croft again, and led her back, since he did not deem it well
  to risk too long a first excursion.</p>

  <p>"Return now to your body as before," he directed when they stood beside
  it. "Yet remember this when you wake." For the first time she asked a
  question of her own volition. "You&mdash;are&mdash;really Jason?"</p>

  <p>"Aye."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;your body?"</p>

  <p>"Lies in the Zitran pyramid as yours lies here before you. Return into
  yours, beloved, and I return to mine."</p>

  <p>"Aye," she assented. "I return, but&mdash;I shall remember&mdash;the
  moonlight&mdash;Himyra&mdash;my father&mdash;and you."</p>

  <p>She ceased and suddenly Croft found himself alone. Gone was the radiant
  form with its aura of gold and purple, its dancing points of fire, which, as
  he knew, were no more than the never-ceasing, vibrant oscillation of the
  Pranic sparks&mdash;the fires of life&mdash;gone, and he stood in the room
  where Azil spread his wings in a wide-flung benediction and Naia of Aphur lay
  asleep.</p>

  <p>Yet Croft was satisfied if not content, and he felt assured as he willed
  himself back to Zitra that when she waked in the morning she would recall
  this first experience as a vivid dream at least.</p>

  <p>Indeed as the days went by his major trouble was to curb his own
  impatience in setting her astral consciousness awake, in refraining from an
  attempt to progress too fast, in keeping the development he was seeking to
  produce within her, inside the limits of a well-nigh natural awakening of the
  greater powers of the soul, in avoiding anything which could in any way
  resemble a forced growth. Hence, as a sort of brake to his own desire to
  return too frequently to her, he took up the instruction of Zud, initiating
  the amazed old man more and more into the mysteries of what he, in his own
  experience, had proved to be the truth.</p>

  <p>Once more, however, he visited Naia, before the elections were held,
  choosing an afternoon when Zud was engaged in temple duties.</p>

  <p>He found her in the vast red-and-yellow paved court of the mountain
  palace, with Maia beside her, very much as on a former day when he had first
  visited her in the flesh and spoken to her of love. She lay as then on a
  wine-red couch, in the sort of diaphanous house-robes women of her class
  affected, with Maia waving a huge feather fan above her.</p>

  <p>Croft smiled as he called her forth, thinking how amazed the blue girl of
  Mazzer would be if she knew that her arms swayed the fan above an empty
  tenement of clay, and saying as much to Naia, so that she, too, smiled.</p>

  <p>And that day they wandered far over valley and hill, flitting above wooded
  slopes, loitering sometimes in sun-filled hollows, where flowers of tropic
  brilliance nodded in the grasses or flaunted their beauty from swaying
  trailing vines. And from there to the higher places, up, up, hand in hand, to
  where the eternal snows lay gripped in the clutches of dark peaks and
  crags.</p>

  <p>Until then their communion had been silent save at the first, but the
  sight of the sparkling snows beneath the sunlight seemed to stir some
  recollection within Naia's soul.</p>

  <p>"It&mdash;was here I sent for snows to chill the wines for the banquet to
  Kyphallos, the time he. came from Cathur, by Jadgor's plan," she said.</p>

  <p>"That Kyphallos to whom Jadgor would have wed you?" Croft replied.</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Except that I was saved from marriage to a profligate and
  traitor by"&mdash;she paused and appeared to hesitate and went on in a way
  less certain&mdash;"by Jasor of Nodhur."</p>

  <p>"Jasor of Nodhur has gone to Zitu," Croft corrected quickly. "You were
  saved from that fate by me, after Jasor's body became the servant of my
  spirit, as is your body the servant of your spirit, and changed it to my
  purpose, made it mine, because your spirit had called me to you as to-day I
  called you to me."</p>

  <p>"Yet I knew you not then as Jason, but as Jasor," Naia faltered. "How then
  could I call your spirit?"</p>

  <p>"Nay," said Croft, "you knew me not, yet felt you never in those days a
  yearning for some one you had as yet seen never&mdash;felt you not yourself
  already to answer that some one's call, as a woman ripened must answer to her
  lover?"</p>

  <p>"Ay?," said his companion slowly. "Ga the eternal spoke to me more than
  once in such fashion, yet none came to sound the call I should answer until
  Jasor of Nodhur appeared. Were it your spirit in Jasor's body, you know how
  the call was answered afterward."</p>

  <p>Am I not like him?" Croft questioned, thrilling at the recollection her
  words invoked.</p>

  <p>"Aye," she confessed. "And when I am with you, it seems that you are
  he&mdash;that you call me to you in spirit, even as he called in the
  flesh&mdash;that I come to you gladly as a maiden to a tryst with him to whom
  Ga sends her. Yet, when I return to the body beside which even now Maia
  stands watch, all is confusion when I wake."</p>

  <p>"Were you to remember then that in or out of the flesh, it is the spirit
  calls to the spirit, it were perchance more plain," Croft said.</p>

  <p>"Love then is of the spirit only?" She looked into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Croft nodded. "Love is of the spirit&mdash;passion alone of the
  flesh. Know you not then that it was love called me to you from the
  earth?"</p>

  <p>"Earth?" she repeated. "Aye&mdash;Gaya told me somewhat concerning that."
  "Come then," said Croft, determining ,of sudden impulse on a demonstration
  and seized her by the hand.</p>

  <p>Up, up he carried her across the void. The landscape dwindled swiftly away
  beneath them. Its details faded, became but a sun-smeared blur until Palos
  whirled on its mighty ball, bedded in a mass of woolly cloud. Up, up. Croft
  glanced at his companion and found her face wide-eyed. Up, up, as she floated
  beside him, her slender shape in the void of darkness beyond the atmosphere
  of Palos beginning to flash and glow with its contained fire. For Croft had
  willed himself to that one of the moons on which he had first come down from
  his daring journey from the earth. And now it swung above them. Together they
  swam toward it, and came to it finding its barren and lifeless crags and
  plains aglare in the light of Sirius, partly steeped in impenetrable gloom.
  Across the lighted region Croft led Naia swiftly. They passed from the
  light.</p>

  <p>"Look!" he cried, and pointed to the void of the eternal heavens beyond
  them, where sparkled the pin-points of a million worlds. "Behold, Palos!" He
  directed her vision to where the planet rolled, its clouds now turned into
  what seemed golden fire. "We stand now on one of the moons that light your
  world at night, beloved. We gaze at your world from its moon, as from earth
  we gaze at a star&mdash;as we gaze at earth as a star from here. By the will
  of the spirit have we come. By the spirit's will shall we return."</p><a id=

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>And on his words it was as though Palos rose to meet them, and once more
  they were back on the crags beside the snows. .</p>

  <p>"Zitu, may this be permitted?" Naia panted as one shaken by amazement.</p>

  <p>"Much," said Croft in answer, "may be permitted to the spirit which seeks
  truth and dares."</p>

  <p>And after that they wandered on, finding a good-sized stream leaping down
  the side of the mountain not far from Naia's home. Croft seized upon its
  presence with acclaim. A glance had told him that here was power he could
  harness to perfect his scheme for generating artificial light, and he sought
  to explain it to his companion, outlining how by the construction of a series
  of giant penstocks he would divert the plunging water against wheels to use
  its force in turning other wheels.</p>

  <p>She listened closely and suddenly she laughed. "Now are you as Jasor!" she
  exclaimed. "It was so he talked concerning his devices before the Zollarian war against which he planned."</p>

  <p>"Always have I been, as I am now," Jason told her. "Even as Naia of Aphur
  has always been the same."</p>

  <p>"Always?" she questioned and turned searching eyes upon him.</p>

  <p>"Aye, always, and ever will be," he answered, "until Jason and Naia shall
  be one."</p>

  <p>She quivered. Her astral body glowed. Its fires leaped and flamed before
  him, white and purple and gold. Croft knew that he himself was swayed by a
  similar emotion and sought to check it lest he overtax her as yet. not fully
  awakened understanding. "Come," he said again, "come," and led her south
  along the western mountains, exploring them, pointing out their beauties as
  they passed along.</p>

  <p>it was thus he found an outcropping barrier of coal. He spied it and sank
  upon it, and bent to assure himself that he was not mistaken, and
  straightened with a radiant face. Here was energy stored for the furnaces he
  meant to raise across the land ere long. Until now charcoal had been used
  mainly in the metal trades. But&mdash;here&mdash;he had a vision of vast
  smelters once this coal was mined. And the Tamarizians were miners
  experienced for generations in the handling of ores.</p>

  <p>He pointed to his find and explained to Naia that here was fuel.</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" she cried in wondering half comprehension. "Would Jason burn a
  stone!"</p>

  <p>"Nay," he said, and made plain the nature of the substance they
  discussed.</p>

  <p>At the end she nodded. "I am convinced," she said. "Him I knew as Jasor
  was Jason indeed. Your words, your plans are the same. Thanks be to Ga and
  Azil, I am happy. You, Jason, are he whom I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Love," Croft supplied as once more she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Aye, love." For the second time her astral figure glowed with its auric
  fires. "With you I am happy&mdash;free thus and alone, with a strange new
  happiness&mdash;such as I have never known. Canst not hold me thus beside
  you? Must I return again to the prison of the body? Canst not claim me now,
  and keep me wholly thine own?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not yet," Croft stammered, shaken as never before by her words
  and taking alarm at the mood which was upon her. "Yet, some time I shall
  claim you mine before all men. Come now, for the present we must return."</p>

  <p>Across a twilight sky they flitted back, drifting into the red and yellow
  paved court where the red and yellow steps ran up at either end to the yellow
  balcony supported on its carved pillars of red, and the giant figure of a
  straining man, did battle with a beast not unlike a tiger, to protect a
  crouching woman from its fangs.</p>

  <p>"See!" said Croft. "So shall I fight for you&mdash;protect you&mdash;guard
  you, wage warfare against all else for you, until indeed you are mine."</p>

  <p>She smiled upon him. "So shall I wait for thee," she began, and broke off
  sharply: "Behold!"</p>

  <p>Croft turned his eyes. Maia knelt the length of her azure form crouched in
  a posture of woe beside the couch on which Naia's body still reclined. Her
  arms were thrown out across her mistress's breasts, her face buried from
  sight between them. Beside her stood Mitlos, gazing on blue girl and white,
  his entire posture and expression indicative of distress.</p>

  <p>"Woe, woe!" Maia wailed in choked accents. "Cursed be Zilla who came upon
  her in her sleep! She moved not, neither did she speak. Yet when I sought to
  wake her at the hour for her bath, she answered not to my voice. Again and
  again I cried to her, 'Naia, my mistress,' yet she did not wake.
  Mitlos&mdash;Mitlos, we are undone. This is not of our doing, yet will Lakkon
  seek our lives."</p>

  <p>"Go," said Croft to the lovely presence beside him. "Spare her alarm. I
  thought not of your bathing. I have kept you overlong." ,</p>

  <p>And Naia, nodding, lingered for a final question. "Yet&mdash;will you come
  to me again?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Croft and watched her vanish, watched Naia of Aphur's eyes
  open, and the bosom beneath Maia's outstretched arms swell slowly, so that
  the Mazzer girl felt and sprang up, startled, staring, with a starting
  gaze.</p>

  <p>And then he went back to Himyra and sat up on his golden couch and smiled.
  He had done a good day's work.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">XII. &mdash; ON THE WINGS OF AZIL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE end of the month following the election found Croft
  beginning to carry out his material plans. Robur coming to Zitra for the
  inauguration of Jadgor, bringing Gaya and Naia with him&mdash;the latter at
  Lakkon's request&mdash;found time to insist that Jason return to Himyra at
  once, and institute the work they had before discussed.</p>

  <p>Nor to tell the truth was Croft in any way loath. Indeed work was what he
  craved, rather than a life such as for the past two weeks he had found
  himself compelled to live in the Zitran pyramid. In addition he felt that the
  atmosphere of Zitra would be subtly changed once Jadgor was upon the ground,
  while in Aphur with Robur, his friend and collaborator in his endeavors, the
  course of his plans would be cleared. Then, too, he was thrilled by the
  thought of contriving a material meeting with Naia, even more than by
  anything else. That thought it was which set him to work on the development
  of electric power first.</p>

  <p>Before that, however, he took Zud and journeyed to Scira in a galley, its
  hull gilded, its sails of azure-blue, with a blue canopy above its after
  deck, driven by a motor, rather than the oars which had formerly projected
  from its waist. And at Scira he interviewed Koryphu, the head of the
  university, regarding the establishment of schools. It was arranged that he
  should induce Mutlos to take the matter up with Jadgor, and Croft and the
  high priest sailed south to the mouth of the Na and up its yellow flood.</p>

  <p>Then once more Himyra's forges flared as they had flared for the greater
  part of that strange year before. Robur, democratic despite his royal birth,
  went with Croft to the shops. In them was posted a notice printed from
  Jason's original alphabetical blocks, announcing that past the command of the
  Mouthpiece of Zitu there was no further word. In all things pertaining to the
  development of the things he had planned Croft found himself supreme. He
  directed and designed, while at the same time he cultivated the friendship of
  his superintending captains and their men.</p>

  <p>One of his first steps was to set about developing the vein of coal he had
  discovered. He organized a band of miners and a motor transport train. It was
  a strange sight when the latter for the first time rolled forth. Robur and he
  went with it, and saw to the starting of the work. Save for his faith in
  Jason the new governor of Aphur would have doubted. Laughing, Croft gave him
  and the staring bands of miners and captains a demonstration, and allayed
  their doubts. On the second day, after the strippers were uncovering the vein
  and others of the men were erecting cabins to house the workers, Robur and he
  drove back.</p>

  <p>Copper wire and rubber, or a substitute, were what he next required. The
  first was easily gained. For generations the Tamarizians had worked in metal,
  as shown by their couches, their molded doors, their carriages and chariots
  and their tempered swords and spears. Croft set hundreds of the workers to
  the task of making wire. The second requirement was far less readily gained.
  But he did not despair. Aphur's climate was tropical in the main. He believed
  he might find some vegetable product such as he needed for the insulation of
  his wires and set about an extensive questioning of the city's learned men.
  So in the end he learned of a tree which exuded a milklike sap, in the
  forests south along the Na. Thither he and Robur went straightway in a
  motor-driven galley, and the thing was done in theory at least, depending for
  its practical working out on the efforts of an army of local natives, whom
  the two set to gathering sap.</p>

  <p>Back again in Himyra, save at night, Croft gave himself little rest. And
  even at night since, on Robur's insistence, he had taken up residence at the
  palace rather than in the Himyran pyramid, Robur and he discussed their
  plans, unless the governor was called by his duties somewhere else.
  Occasionally when this happened, Croft talked with Gaya instead.</p>

  <p>In this way he succeeded in winning her sympathetic understanding of his
  position, even as concerning his love for Naia he had won it once before. And
  Gaya, whose nature was characterized by a sweet simplicity, questioned him
  frankly concerning the episode of Naia's attempted suicide in the pool.</p>

  <p>"Robur swore by Zitu, he believed you present, in the same guise in which
  you have told me, you move when your body sleeps."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Robur was right," Croft told her and described step by step what had
  occurred.</p>

  <p>The princess nodded. "Now that Lakkon remains with Jadgor at Zitra, the
  maid grows lonely," she declared. "She has asked me to visit her. May I speak
  with her concerning these things if she mentions to me her dreams?"</p>

  <p>Croft smiled. On Palos, or on earth, woman, he thought was the same. And
  Gaya, happy beyond question in the arms of the man of her choice, stood ready
  to lead or drive Naia, a sister-woman to a mating if she could. And, smiling,
  he nodded assent, but added a caution. "Yet speak not of it save as of a
  dream-wife of my true friend. For the growth of the soul must be as the
  growth of a flower, which the light of truth expands."</p>

  <p>His wire being made, his rubber gathered, Croft turned next to the
  harnessing of the mountain stream. He chose copper for his penstocks instead
  of wood, furnishing specifications to the molders for the sections of the
  pipe and designing the model of the turbines to be mounted in the pits.</p>

  <p>In all things Robur rendered him such assistance as he could, while he
  never ceased to marvel at the very things he planned. "Mouthpiece of Zitu you
  are indeed!" he exclaimed again and again, with flashing eyes as some new
  detail was unfolded to his mind. "Let Jadgor be president at his leisure.
  Thou and I, my Jason, shall take Tamarizia yet and make it a new world."</p>

  <p>And with such a lieutenant Croft found his work advance. Wire was being
  made in miles, rubber was being delivered in enormous chunks from the
  commercial galleys down the Na, loaded onto trucks along the quays, drawn by
  the doglike creatures harnessed to them through the merchandise tunnels
  beneath the streets and stored in the huge warehouses against future use.
  Indeed all Himyra, all Aphur hummed at the end of the month, and the founders
  were beginning to turn out the sections of the giant penstock pipes.</p>

  <p>Thereupon Croft collected another train of motors and, organizing a party
  of road-builders and masons, made his way into the hills to select the site
  of his power-station on the mountain stream.</p>

  <p>At the camp he established beside the mountain torrent he lost no time.
  Long since he had cast aside Zud's choice of temple dress, for the metal
  leg-cases, the short-skirted tunic of a military captain, falling half-way
  down the thighs, and belted at the waist&mdash;a costume affording the utmost
  freedom of movement while he directed the beginning of each task. Habited
  thus he sat one day on the hillside, watching his laborers digging trenches
  for the mighty penstocks, preparing the pits for the turbines when, with a
  crash, through some near-by bushes was thrust a huge animal face.</p>

  <p>Open it was, gaping, with a lolling red tongue, and yellow fang-like
  teeth. For a moment it stared at him panting and then with a bound the whole
  lithe creature advanced, and flung itself against him as he scrambled to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Hai, Hupor!" he cried, recognizing the huge houndlike beast which had
  fawned upon him once before in Lakkon's mountain house, and excited Naia's
  comment by the act.</p>

  <p>Then as the creature dropped down beside him and turned its eyes, he
  followed their direction with his own, and found his heart begin a gladdened
  leaping. A trifle further up the hillside, Naia of Aphur stood between two
  trees. Soft climbing sandals of gnuppa hide were on her feet and embraced her
  tapering calves to just below the knees. Brown was her garment above them,
  embroidered simply in green. And on her golden hair was a band of brown,
  supporting a shimmering drape against the heat of the afternoon, and a
  curling plume green as the leaves above it. In that first glance it seemed to
  Croft that seen so, she was more beautiful than she had ever been.</p>

  <p>He went toward her, his pulses hammering in his ears, the giant beast
  trailing at his heels.</p>

  <p>"Greeting, maid of Aphur!" he said when he stood before her, and bowed
  deeply from the hips, in formal fashion.</p>

  <p>"Hail, Mouthpiece of Zitu!" Naia inclined her head. "Did Hupor break upon
  your meditations or distract your attention from the work in hand?"</p>

  <p>"Hupor and I," said Croft with a glance at the beast, "are friends. Nor is
  my work a thing requiring such haste, that I may not spare time to admire the
  fairest work of Zitu's hands."</p>

  <p>A swift color mounted into Naia's cheeks. Her glance shifted. "I walk
  frequently with Hupor," she began a somewhat confused explanation. "The
  temptation came upon me to inspect the work which I have watched from my
  father's home for the past three suns, since it began. Hupor, I think, was
  more surprised to see you than was I."</p>

  <p>"You expected to find me?" Croft caught her words up quickly.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she rejoined with an upward flash of her eyes. "Is not the work
  of Zitu's Mouthpiece under his direction?" Her manner changed, became charged
  with covert meaning. "And more I dreamed."</p>

  <p>"Dreamed?" Croft repeated, striving to still a rising tumult in his
  breast, at what seemed a challenging of his spirit by hers.</p>

  <p>"Nay, I know not," she said almost faintly, while her white lids quivered
  above each purple iris. "But it was as though one told me this stream was to
  be used to bring new light to Himyra&mdash;that such was a part of your
  plans."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "it is&mdash;to Himyra, and to Lakkon, thy father's house,
  if so you desire, and to all of Aphur, all of Tamarizia in time. If so you
  saw it, it would appear as a vision rather than a dream, maid of Aphur. Come
  and I will show you its beginning and explain."</p>

  <p>For an hour after that she wandered with him, and watching her now and
  then, Croft surprised a puzzled expression on her face. Yet he said no
  definite word, since he knew that the leaven of his past acts was working in
  her, was slowly rising up until at last it should wake her fully to the
  truth.</p>

  <p>"It were hardly fitting, were Lakkon's daughter not to offer to Zitu's
  mouthpiece the freedom of Lakkon's house," she said at the last, when Croft
  had escorted her back to the mountain valley wherein the palace was placed.
  And her tone was vaguely wistful&mdash;there was something in her eyes that
  cried out to him, wholly unlike that blue fire of scorn they had held, when
  she flung the betrothal seal of Azil against his breast.</p>

  <p>"Jason, the Mouthpiece, shall do himself the honor of Lakkon's house, when
  Lakkon is within it," he replied with meaning, as he bowed and turned and
  left her, and heard her catch her breath.</p>

  <p>Yet he took with him a song in his heart because of the invitation which
  had faltered from her lips; because as he knew now the cry of spirit to
  spirit was beginning to actuate the flesh. And he walked more as a god indeed
  than a man as he made his way back to his workmen, threading his way on
  springing feet, glorying in the strength of his free-limbed stride on the
  wooded slopes, holding in his heart the knowledge that it was because she had
  felt he would be present&mdash;because of an urge to be near him, to speak
  with him as man and woman, that she had come to view the new work.</p>

  <p>But he did not attempt to approach her again in the astral condition
  during the week longer that he remained at the ^site of the power-plant. Nor
  did Naia venture to it any more. And so soon as he was satisfied that his
  subordinates understood the exact scope of their duties, he returned to set
  about the actual construction of the dynamo that, water driven, should light
  Himyra with a myriad of glowing lamps.</p>

  <p>But that night, after he had received Robur's report of progress, and they
  had talked over the dynamo plans, he sought his own apartment and stretched
  himself upon his couch. And then he went seeking the two women who in all his
  life he had known the best, because he thought that it would be on this first
  night, with Gaya, that Naia would unburden herself.</p>

  <p>Failing to find them in the palace, he sought and found them in the
  garden, seated on a carved bench of stone, inside the vine-grown walls of the
  pool. Naia's eyes were fixed upon its surface, silvered by the light of
  Palos's moons. Very wide and dark they seemed beneath the shadow of her hair.
  Her lips moved.</p>

  <p>"Whether these be dreams, induced by those things of which you told me, or
  whether too much thinking has tired my mind until it makes of vain imaginings
  the seeming of other thought, I know not," she said in a musing voice. "Yet
  even as you said, he had told my cousin Robur that he left his body, so has
  it seemed to me that I left my flesh, when he called me to him&mdash;that
  hand in hand we wandered forth together, to Himyra&mdash;over the mountains,
  and once that we leaped all space, as he says his spirit leaped from earth to
  Palos and stood upon the larger of the moons up yonder, whose light sparkles
  here on the pool."</p>

  <p>Gaya's tones were a trifle unsteady&mdash;filled with a certain awe, as
  Croft waited her answer. "But&mdash;Naia, sweet maid, may not dreams embody
  truth?" .</p>

  <p>"If dreams they be, I think it may be so," her companion rejoined. "For on
  that time we went to Himyra as it seemed, I saw my father asleep, and he
  whispered my name, and the next time he came to me he spoke to me about it;
  said that he saw me standing beside him and had called me.</p>

  <p>"And,"&mdash;abruptly her soft voice took on the speaking semblance of a
  child&mdash;"Gaya&mdash;the night was the same&mdash;on which I had my dream.
  And again on an afternoon when it seemed he called me, and we wandered over
  hill and valley, where flowers bloomed, and up to the everlasting snows, it
  seemed also that on returning Maia thought that I had died, and he bade me
  back into my body, promising to come to me again. And when I woke, Maia and
  Mitlos stood beside me, in tears and terror, thinking my spirit flown.
  Gaya&mdash;how explain such things as these?"</p>

  <p>"I may not tell you," Gaya faltered. "In these days since Zitu's
  mouthpiece came among us, Aphur and all Tamarizia have witnessed wondrous
  sights, have dreamed of undreamed truths."</p>

  <p>"Mouthpiece of Zitu," Naia repeated, turning to face her companion. "I
  like not the name. Jason, he calls himself to me in my dreams, and as Jason I
  prefer to think of him&mdash;as Jason, a man, and&mdash;and&mdash;my lover.
  Ah, Gaya, should I blush for such a thought?"</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;thou art a woman, ripe for loving," Gaya reassured her quickly.
  "And to women, be they fit, I think that Ga herself sends dreams."</p>

  <p>"Dreams!" Abruptly Naia clenched a fist and struck the tapered outline of
  her thigh. "Dreams&mdash;aye, dreams they must be, Gaya&mdash;for to me he
  came no more again. Only when I thought not of his coming did it happen, and
  since, when I have called him, sought once more to sleep and find him, it is
  vain. Yet if I be shameless, let me speak the same. Greater happiness have I
  never known since I tore the seal of Azil from my girdle, than when in my
  sleep he called me to him, and I answered and saw him standing before me in
  my chamber, fair as Azil himself, with his form shot through by the soft
  light of the moon. Or, when I slept and Maia fanned me, and he came and led
  me into the outer world, where we wandered in far places, he and I
  alone."</p>

  <p>"You saw him while he was in the mountains?" Gaya asked as her companion
  paused, causing Croft to smile as he saw her intent to learn what he himself
  had not told.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;what am I saying? Gaya, I forget myself, even as that day I
  forgot myself and bade him to my father's house." Suddenly she broke off to
  throw her arms about Gaya's neck and bury her face, gone white in the silver
  moonlight, against her breast.</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;" the arms of the older woman crept about her.</p>

  <p>"He replied he would enter it when Lakkon was within it," Naia told her in
  a smothered voice.</p>

  <p>"As he would were he careful of your honor." Gaya held her close. "Child,
  when my visit is ended, you must return with me to Himyra, nor longer spend
  your time in dreams and thoughts."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" Naia sat up abruptly. Her question came with a sweetly
  feminine inconsistence. "Would he not think I sought his presence, were I to
  accompany you to the palace?"</p>

  <p>"Are you not Robur's cousin?" Gaya answered. "Can he expect you to remain
  forever in your father's house?"</p>

  <p>Croft's smile was very tender as he turned away. Time and those "dreams"
  of hers were fighting his battle for him in Naia's soul. And had he need of
  other assistance in winning the one woman he desired in a million worlds or
  years, Gaya was his lieutenant. He blessed her as he returned to Himyra, for
  that propinquity of Naia and himself in the future, that feminine endeavor at
  match-making, for which he now knew that she schemed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">XIII. &mdash; NEW MARVELS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THAT Zitran, too, ran past. During it word came from Zitra
  that Jadgor had approved and recommended for acceptance by the national
  assembly that scheme for a chain of schools among the masses, Mutlos of
  Cathur had introduced. Thereupon Croft and Jadgor selected several expert
  metal molders and set them to work at making type, and Jason choosing some of
  the skilled workmen whom he had trained to exact methods in making the
  motors, months before, directed them now in the building of a rather simple
  set of presses in which the type should be used.</p>

  <p>Also looking to the future he commanded others of the motor mechanics to
  begin the construction of a half dozen engines of a somewhat different
  design. Questioned by Robur as to his purpose, he explained that these were
  destined to finish the lifting power for the first Tamarizian airplanes.</p>

  <p>"Zitu! Zitu!" exclaimed the governor of Aphur, flashing his perfect teeth;
  "I doubt you not, Jason, but my wonder does not cease. Recall you the morning
  when you drove the first motor through the streets of Himyra and well nigh
  frightened the civic guards to death?" He smiled, and Jason laughed. And then
  he sobered.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "And I recall also how the same morning, Chythron,
  Lakkon's driver, lost control of the gnuppas and they bolted, and I spoke
  with Naia, thy fair cousin, first."</p>

  <p>Robur nodded. He laid a hand on his companion's arm. "Fear not," he
  admonished in sympathetic understanding. "Though the maid repel you because
  of a lack of understanding, yet shall she come to you at length."</p>

  <p>"Aye," Croft looked the other man full in the eyes with meaning. "Once
  more shall I place Azil's sign upon Naia of Aphur's girdle."</p>

  <p>Yet to all outward seeming he appeared immersed in his work, and even as
  the dynamo and the turbines took shape, he sent men into the vast plain that
  stretched between Himyra and the mountains of Aphur, to a spot of his
  selection, and bade them build there a huge shed to house his airplane fleet.
  Still others he set on the fashioning of ribs for the wings of the planes
  themselves, to building the fuselage bodies out of sheets of copper, and
  after a consultation with the local caste of weavers, he picked on a fabric
  for the wings.</p>

  <p>And with all his ceaseless activities he still found time in a whimsical
  mood to inaugurate among his workmen a series of recreation and games lest
  under the driving of Robur and himself the sweating laborers grow stale.
  Indeed, he introduced a sort of competitive spirit in the various shops,
  organizing from the members of each a separate club and matching them one
  against the other in their sports. And of all the games on which he might
  have picked, Jason Croft, Mouthpiece of Zitu, and virtual commander of the
  remaking of a nation, chose baseball!</p>

  <p>In this he gave his at times bizarre fancy full rein. The balls were
  fashioned from well-turned gnuppa hide, about a rubber core, with a covering
  of string. The bats, were of tough resilient wood, which the new devotees of
  the pastime swung with might and main.</p>

  <p>Then for the first time on Palos were heard the crack of the batsman
  lining out a clean drive, and the cry of the umpire, Croft himself at first:
  "Ball four&mdash;take a free pass! Strike&mdash;one!"</p>

  <p>And because even the most serious mind must find relaxation at times,
  Croft found he enjoyed the matches between teams immensely, while Robur
  entered with almost animal spirits into the rivalry of the games, and nearly
  pestered the life out of Jason, trying to master the intricacies and
  comprehend the casual principles involved in curves, in and outshoots, drops
  and breaks, after he had seen them first. Indeed Jason had more than one
  laugh after he discovered Robur in the bathing court of the palace one
  morning, hurling a ball against a backstop he had arranged, and trying to
  learn to throw it around a corner, as he somewhat naively explained.</p>

  <p>But if Robur did not accomplish his purpose, several of the pitchers
  eventually did to some extent, and Robur got a laugh of his own, when one of
  them whom he had secretly had Jason coach in the copper foundry team, was
  produced.</p>

  <p>The batter who happened to be up swung it sharply at what looked like a
  slow and easy delivery, and Aphur's governor chuckled for days because the
  fellow very nearly broke his neck when his bat failed to find the ball where
  he thought it was.</p>

  <p>Croft's main satisfaction, however, in the success of the innovation lay
  in the fact that from rivalry in the game it was but a step to rivalry
  between the various corps of laborers in the shops.</p>

  <p>He took that step and introduced a system of bonuses and holidays for
  increased production or extra-efficient work. And because the Tamarizians
  were a pleasure-loving people, the plan was a success from the first. Working
  three shifts, as he had before the Zollarian war, Croft found his plans
  progress. Five weeks&mdash;the length of a Zitran month after his return from
  the mountains, found his turbines finished, his dynamo ready to be
  transported and assembled in its appointed place.</p>

  <p>That place was ready to receive it as Croft knew from several trips he had
  taken to it, in one of his swiftest motors. A stone power-house had been
  erected, the penstocks were in place. Diverting gates were prepared to turn
  the stream into them at the proper moment, and send It roaring through the
  turbines in the pits.</p>

  <p>Telling Robur to send men into the mountains to cut poles, and giving him
  a model of insulators to be made of glass, Jason loaded the sections of his
  dynamo upon his fleet of transports and set forth again on his journey to the
  hills.</p>

  <p>Thereafter for two weeks he toiled and sweated, thankful at least for the
  fact that in Tamarizia labor was plentiful and regulated by government
  control in regard to wages, carefully estimated on a living scale, so that
  the dissatisfaction and continual strikes of earth were unknown. These
  conditions enabled him to command what workmen needed, and rest assured of a
  steady advance in the projects he undertook.</p>

  <p>More than once in that long, hot fourteen suns, Robur drove out to inspect
  the progress made and marvel, and report the insulators being turned out in
  satisfactory shape, and the poles coming down from the hills on creaking
  motor trucks. Croft gave him drawings to guide him in setting up a line of
  power poles across the desert from Himyra toward the mountains, and at night,
  when his weary workmen were sleeping, plunged into the task of devising
  Tamarizia's first electric lights. At first he confined his plans to
  small-sized arcs, intending to give public demonstration before he went on
  with the attempt to devise incandescents for inside use.</p>

  <p>Coal was coming down from the vein he had discovered by now in quantity
  sufficient to use in the copper smelters, and he decided to gain his carbons,
  from this, converted into coke. After several nights of intensive working, he
  pushed aside his finished plans and drew a long breath of relief. The thing
  was done.</p>

  <p>Croft's eyes flashed. This enlightenment of a people and a nation was
  becoming well nigh an obsessing delight in his brain. It partook almost of
  the nature of creation despite the fact that he knew those things he was
  producing were but crude copies of familiar things he had formerly known as
  concomitants of life. For, as he had said to Robur, and to Zud, and to Naia
  herself, he was a man&mdash;was human in all his impulses and feelings
  regardless of the marvelous control of the spirit he had learned, and he
  thrilled with a personal satisfaction in the success of each new endeavor,
  the wonder each new product of his scheming excited in other brains.</p>

  <p>From Robur he learned that Gaya had returned to the palace, bringing Naia
  with her for an indefinite stay. That, indeed, was in accordance with his
  plans. For so soon as he had realized that Gaya meant to throw the girl and
  himself into a closer association, as he did after the conversation he had
  heard between the two women, he had purposely meant to be absent from Himyra
  himself when the woman he loved arrived.</p>

  <p>Croft would not have been either where or what he was had he been devoid
  of a vast psychological knowledge. And deep as were his own emotions, strong
  as was his own impulse to indulge a desire for Naia's closer presence, yet in
  all he did at that time he followed a deliberately mapped-out course for the
  accomplishment of his purpose.</p>

  <p>During those days, as her words to Gaya had shown him very clearly, Naia
  of Aphur's mental condition was one of vague unrest. And the principle cause
  of that unrest was, as Croft knew, himself.</p>

  <p>The new estrangement between them, her act in returning his betrothal
  jewel in so dramatic a manner, those subsequent excursions into the unknown
  world of the astral plane which he had brought about, and which she was as
  yet unable to consider other than as vagaries of a sleeping brain, had
  induced within her a state of introspection which, even more than his
  immediate presence, he felt sure must serve his purpose best.</p>

  <p>She had cried out in a sympathy seeking confusion to the wife of his
  friend, that she had sought him that day in the mountains, as a sort of
  test&mdash;a means of convincing herself if her visioning were false or real.
  She had admitted that, even despite her former reluctance to consider a
  possible mundane love between Croft in his present body and herself, he had
  appealed to her that day in his physical form and strength. And she had
  complained that he had not kept the promise given by his astral form to hers,
  to return to her so again; had confessed that she had sought for a renewal of
  those two former meetings, had tried to repeat her "dreams."</p>

  <p>Jason Croft, erecting his dynamo, harnessing it to his turbines with heavy
  beltings of gnuppa hide, felt that the very desire he had wakened in Naia's
  soul, would do its work better while it remained unsatisfied, would gain in
  strength as the days passed into weeks, would receive an added poignancy when
  she arrived at Himyra and found him gone again to the hills, engaged without
  any seeming distraction attributable to herself, on his work.</p>

  <p>For Croft knew very, very well that one of the great laws of all mating
  consists in this&mdash;that until mating itself is accomplished, one element
  retreats, while the other as constantly seeks, before desire itself in the
  one awakens desire in the other, and thereby bringing both elements together,
  strikes out of them life's fire.</p>

  <p>Yet, night after night, his work finished, stretched on a rough couch,
  Croft yearned for this woman of all the worlds to his soul. Night after night
  he lay picturing her as he had known her, revealing their every association
  together, from his first sight of her in her father's carriage, to those two
  weird astral meetings which had occurred. He pictured her beauty of face and
  form&mdash;the supple strength of the latter, its litheness, its wonderful
  grace. He saw it in his mind's eye as he had seen it time and again in
  life.</p>

  <p>And there were times when he quivered, and stretched out his arms which
  throbbed with a strange, numb aching, remembering as it seemed in their very
  substance, the soft, warm pressure of her flesh, the glory of her former
  surrender to the caress of their embrace. There were times when his lips
  writhed as he recalled their first meeting with her mouth&mdash;that quick,
  spontaneous giving and taking of a kiss, before she had cried out that
  now&mdash;now&mdash;he must win her, or else by the customs of her country,
  she stood a maid disgraced&mdash;had cried it, and yet before she left him on
  that same occasion, had crept to him, inviting a second kiss.</p>

  <p>And though at such things Croft thrilled as may any man thrill, at the
  thought of the one woman who can drive him to madness as a man, yet unlike
  the ordinary mortal he thrilled still more at the beauty of her soul. For
  unlike the customary lover, Croft had seen it&mdash;and because of his
  knowledge of such matters, because he knew the meanings in a spiritual sense
  of certain vibrations&mdash;because he could interpret the meaning involved
  in auric colors&mdash;he knew that only a chastely pure spirit possessed an
  aura of blue and gold. Wherefore great as was his glory in his recollections
  of her physical beauty and charm, greater still was his exaltation recalling
  how even like her golden hair and purple eyes, that glorious image of her
  being he had twice called from it, glowed.</p>

  <p>Glorious was she in body, beautiful in soul. And Croft lying while the
  night wrapped the mountain, and the stream, plunging over the rocks in its
  bed, sent its murmur to his ears, renewed once more his purpose, and swore by
  all the highest forces in his conception, that ere this thing was finished,
  that glory and beauty should be his. But in his own way&mdash;the true way
&mdash;the way in which two chemical atoms might come
  together&mdash;gladly&mdash;almost unconsciously because of compelling force,
  affinity, desire&mdash;let the word used be what it might since in the great
  law of Zitu or God, they were the same. And it was so Croft meant to claim
  that woman, body and soul, whom he felt was his true twin&mdash;that glorious
  complement of his entire nature&mdash;that lode star of his being who had
  drawn him to her&mdash;across the empty void between the stars.</p>

  <p>On the fourteenth day Robur came up from Himyra at Croft's request. Jason
  met him as he descended from his motor and led him into the newly constructed
  power-house. There, on a masonry and copper base, insulated by a heavy plate
  of glass, stood what was as yet Tamarizia's most wonderful device. Bolted and
  belted to the driving-gear of the turbine it stood, waiting but the driving
  force of the waters through a penstock to wake it into life.</p>

  <p>Croft's eyes blazed with something of excitement as he gestured toward it.
  "Behold, Rob," he said, "with this shall we harness the lightnings and bid
  them do our will. With this shall we light the streets of Himyra and the
  fire-urns along the Na, and the palace, the houses of all men in Himyra
  first, in all Aphur at the last. With this shall we ere we are done, drive
  the wheels in many shops, which now are turned by men and beasts in
  treadmills or upon the windlass bars. So shall it come at last that by the
  mere pressure of a hand upon a lever those wheels shall move. These things I
  promise you, Rob&mdash;behold." He waved a hand to a captain standing by the
  door of the house. And he in turn signaled to a workman not far off. And he,
  who had been waiting, lifted a trumpet to his lips and blew a blast. It was
  the sign on which Croft had agreed for the men high up on the mountain to
  open a penstock gate.</p>

  <p>Yet for a moment there was nothing to mark the effect, until with a
  whisper, rising to a roar, the huge pipe filled and discharged its plunging
  contents against the waiting wheel. Then, as the wheel turned and the belt of
  gnuppa hide revolved, there crept through the new rock house a strange and
  droning hum. Louder and louder it rose, as faster and faster the shining
  armature which Croft and Robur watched spun round. Faster and faster, louder
  and louder&mdash;blue sparks began to shine and quiver under the copper
  brushes. And suddenly, with a blinding scintillation, a hissing crash, a
  giant spark leaped the gap between the terminals of two wires Croft had
  arranged to test the ascending charge.</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Above the crackling discharge the captain in the door cried out:
  "Fly&mdash;we are undone, man of Zitu&mdash;fly!" He staggered back and
  paused and stood staring, vaguely reassured at the smile of triumph on
  Croft's face.</p><a id="pic5"
        name="pic5"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0801071h-images/Zitu-5.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Fear not," Jason told him quickly, as he struck up a lever, released the
  tension of the belt, and caused the first dynamo on Palos to sink from a
  dizzy whirling toward rest. "This moment speaks success for all our toil of
  weeks. Go tell the men on the pipes to close the gates."</p>

  <p>Robur's face, too, was pale, well nigh as that of the captain's, though he
  had held his place. His lips were close pressed, however, and his nostrils
  slightly pinched. Then, as Croft so easily chained the fiery breathing of the
  monster he had produced, his eyes began to flash.</p>

  <p>"By Zitu, and by Zitu!" he swore the Tamarizian oath of wonder. "Jason,
  you have indeed harnessed His own lightning, as you have said. For a moment I
  feared that His wrath were excited by your daring, and He had sent a bolt of
  His fire to destroy us, with the house." He broke off with an almost
  shamefaced laugh.</p>

  <p>"Yet now it gentles like a wild gnuppa under its master's hand," he went
  on again as the dynamo stopped and naught remained save the dwindling rush of
  the waters through the waste pipes from the turbine beneath their feet.
  "Zitu, my friend, but all men shall marvel yet as I do now at this! What plan
  you next?"</p>

  <p>"Light!" said Croft. "Light, first, and after that to make use in all the
  ways I mentioned of this force&mdash;to turn the wheels in shops, to run the
  presses I have made to print from type' and so supply the schools Jadgor has
  favored with the means of broadening men's minds&mdash;to print for them and
  their children, and so to spread the truth."</p>

  <p>"Thou wilt build a city here to do these things?" Robur questioned, as yet
  unable to fully sense quite all Croft's words embraced.</p>

  <p>"No," Jason told him. "This power shall flow from here to Himyra, Rob,
  across the line of poles your men are building, along the wires."</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" The governor of Aphur stared. Croft smiled. "To-morrow," he went
  on, "I return to Himyra to arrange for the making of lights, and a
  demonstration of their working when the time is ripe." And suddenly his whole
  face lighted at an inward thought. "Naia&mdash;Rob. Tell me of her." For
  suddenly at the mention of his return her picture had leaped before him; the
  certainty had come upon him that in Himyra he should meet her, speak to her,
  dwell beneath the roof of the same house. And the accomplishment at which
  Robur, of Himyra, was staring in awestruck wonder&mdash;the great dynamo,
  successful in its primary test, and all it stood for&mdash;sank into
  nothingness before the thought. Naia of Aphur's face, the hinted perfume of
  her presence, blotted it out.</p>

  <p>"Thou wilt see her," said Robur&mdash;"of course." It was as though he
  read Croft's thought. "And could you see her now as each sun I see her,
  perchance you would feel as do I, that she will be glad of your coming now at
  last. Like one without purpose she moves, Jason, my strange friend, whom I
  love as no other man, yet do not understand. There is the look of one who
  waits for one who comes not in her eyes. In their purple depths they hold a
  question ever that makes them doubly dark. Yet if at times I say I am driving
  forth to meet you, I have seen her lay a white hand over Ga's snowy fountain
  beneath her robe. I have seen her lips part as though to speak or question
  concerning thee, and having returned, I have known that her ears were like
  thirsty lips to drink in what reports I made regarding the progress of your
  work. Yet in such mood is she sweeter, more desirable as it seems to me, than
  ever in her life."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. "Not more desirable to me," he said, "than the first sun
  whereon I saw her. To-day I place a guard and send the workmen back to
  Himyra. Tomorrow I shall come."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">XIV. &mdash; BEATING WINGS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">NAIA of Aphur&mdash;Naia! He was now to meet her again in
  the flesh. The thought held Croft as he drove toward</p>

  <p>Himyra the next day. He was to meet her, as at Zitra, not as in the
  mountains beside the stream he had harnessed to his and Tamarizia's purpose,
  but in Robur's palace, where, like himself, she was a guest&mdash;under
  conditions where the conventions of social life, not so far unlike those of earth, since human nature is, after all, very much the same, would compel a
  certain courtesy in their association at least.</p>

  <p>Toward that meeting he went more like an ardent lover than anything else.
  Once in the palace, he sent for a barber and had his hair carefully trimmed.
  For an hour after that he lay while a Mazzerian masseur rubbed softening oils
  into his skin. And then he dressed in a costume he had ordered made when he
  returned from Zitra first, unlike old Zud's robes, and of his own
  designing&mdash;a costume of golden leg cases studded with sapphire-hued
  stones&mdash;an undervest of gossamer tissue&mdash;a short skirt of a heavier
  material, white in color, with a silken sheen, and a cuirass of gold and
  silver, with the wings of Azil and the cross ansata, inlaid on the
  breast-plate in more of the sapphire-like gems. Of gold and silver was his
  helmet topped with a crest of azure plumes. Robur came in upon him, having
  barely returned from the shops, as he put it on.</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" he exclaimed, pausing to stare at his friend, and went on: "Jason,
  thou art a sight&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A sight, yes&mdash;" Croft cut him short with a heightened color. He
  laughed. "Rob&mdash;there are times when your tongue reminds me of speech on
  earth. Were I there at this moment, they would name me a sight indeed."</p>

  <p>A smile twitched Robur's lip as he caught the unaccustomed meaning. "And
  at times I find a strange application of meaning in thy words, Jason," he
  replied. "It is so in the manner of speech you use concerning the games of
  baseball when the contest waxes warm. 'Tear its hide off! Lay on that pill!
  Lean on it! Lean on it!'&mdash;the word 'charley-horse' which you sometimes
  employ, and the naming of an arm a 'wing.' None the less thou art a sight to
  gladden a maiden's eyes, my friend, and even now a maid and a matron await
  thee beside the bathing pool. So&mdash;get thee gone! Thou art beautiful
  enough."</p>

  <p>With another laugh Croft took him at his word, descending to the court
  where the swimming pool sparkled in the late afternoon sunlight, and
  advancing in a considerable blaze of material glory to where, on couches
  beneath a shimmering awning, Gaya and Naia reclined.</p>

  <p>"Hai, Jason!" Robur's wife exclaimed, extending a hand as she saw him.
  "Welcome, thou tamer of the lightning, as my lord has said thou art. Wilt
  pardon a matron's indolence, or should I greet thee on my feet?"</p>

  <p>"Nay." Croft took her hand and bent above it. "I like thee less, wife of
  Robur, in the formal mood. Retain the charm of thy ease." Then deliberately
  he turned his eyes and met those of Naia. "Greeting to thee, maid of Aphur,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"And to thee, Mouthpiece of Zitu," she returned with her pansy-purple eyes
  fixed on the flashing symbol on his breast.</p>

  <p>Croft noted the glance, the slight tensing of the lines about her mouth as
  he sat down. He had meant from the first to note its effect. Indeed, he had
  worn it to this meeting of a purpose. It was his intent that, in spite of it,
  and all it stood for, or had stood for at one time in her mind, her surrender
  should be gained.</p>

  <p>"As to the harnessing of Zitu's fire, 'tis no more than a following out of
  Zitu's law when understood," he turned to Gaya to explain. "The generation of
  'elektricity,' as it is called, is no more in this case than the changing of
  one force into another, a transfer of energy from&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, Ga, I am a woman, unversed in such matters!" Gaya exclaimed with a
  dancing in her eyes. "I fear I am too old to learn. Naia is of a younger
  generation, her mind of softer substance; grave thy meaning on its tablet
  with the stylus of thy tongue. I would see Robur before the evening meal. It
  were time he had returned."</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Croft, smiling and rising to assist her to her feet. "Even now
  he is within the palace. We spoke before I came forth."</p>

  <p>He watched while she hurried importantly away, still smiling inwardly at
  her palpable subterfuge for leaving Naia and him alone; then turned to where
  Lakkon's daughter still reclined, and resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>"You have heard from Zitra?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Aye," she said, and went on with the information: "Lakkon, my father, and
  Jadgor are blessed by Zitu with good health. My cousin's wife informs me
  Jadgor has given sanction to thy plans for schools."</p>

  <p>"My plans?" Jason countered the indirect accusation. "Was not the matter
  presented by Mutlos of Cathur?"</p>

  <p>"Aye." The pansy-purple eyes grew somewhat narrow. "Mutlos&mdash;a man of
  the people, who writes not his own name upon the tablets, suggests that the
  people be taught to read the characters heretofore known to few save the
  nobles and the priests. And Koryphu of Scira joins hands with Mutlos to
  support the project. Thus inside a few Zitrans after a thousand cycles in
  Tamarizia&mdash;" The ivory shoulder above her left breast twitched in
  something like a shrug of her own words of rejection. "Thus, on its face, the
  thing appears. Also, Robur last night came with a marvelous tale of your
  latest success. Zitu&mdash;one succeeds where another only dreams."</p>

  <p>"Success," said Croft, looking directly at her, "consists very largely,
  Princess Naia, in refusing to be denied."</p>

  <p>For a moment she endured his steady contemplation, and then her lids
  drooped, she picked at a fold of her garment. "And you succeed? You refuse to
  be&mdash;denied?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, by Zitu!" her companion told her quickly. "I refuse to question the
  possibility of aught which Zitu permits or ordains."</p>

  <p>And suddenly Naia of Aphur threw up her head in an almost haughty gesture.
  "As were fitting, being Mouthpiece of Zitu," she made answer, "speak further.
  Tell me of your plans."</p>

  <p>Womanlike, she had touched him on a soft spot. Croft blazoned forth. And
  though now in all things mortal he was Tamarizian indeed&mdash;still he was a
  man&mdash;and because of the peculiar circumstances leading up to his
  present position, he still clung to many of the habits in thought of earth.
  Furthermore he had planned at some length the night before concerning the
  manner of his demonstration of electricity to Himyra. And in those plans he
  had put all his eggs in one basket, more or less. He had planned to make it
  what on earth &bull; he might have called "some time." Hence he ignored
  Naia's evasion of what had been growing into more or less a tense situation,
  fell in with her suggestion, and began a delineation of his designs. And
  despite herself, as he went on, Naia, being a typical Aphurian and, like her
  people, one of a pleasure-loving race, found her interest quicken, her
  somewhat formal pose forgotten, her brain filled with pictures never beheld
  before; so that long before he had finished her eyes began to shine.</p>

  <p>"Himyra shall see sights such as she has never witnessed," Croft declared.
  "I shall make lights. Already for them the plans are drawn. Lamps they shall
  be of glass and metal, which, when the new force shall pass through them,
  shall glow, yet without emitting any smoke or flame. These first I shall show
  at a public celebration, in small numbers. Later they shall flare from one
  end of Aphur to the other. Yet before I present them to the people, I shall
  have completed yet another device which shall be for a part of the
  celebration&mdash;a machine which, like the motors across the desert, shall
  fly through the air."</p>

  <p>He went on, lost in the joy of portraying his intentions to her, and
  described the airplane, drawing in graphic words a verbal outline of each
  part, from the metal fuselage to the wings.</p>

  <p>It was then for the first time that Naia interrupted. And not as an
  interruption, but in their nature her words were surprising in a way.
  Gradually as Croft described the airplane he meant to build, her whole
  expression had changed, had grown wide-eyed and parted of lip, a thing of
  rapt attention, until as he paused, with the promise of himself riding the
  air at the coming celebration, she exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Thou wouldst be as a bird in thy daring, and the birds I have often
  yearned to follow! To rise like them, singing in broad circles against the
  sun, or with beating wings to breast some cloudy storm. Zitu
  permitting"&mdash;she lifted herself on her couch, and her whole form seemed
  to expand with the thrill of the conception&mdash;"I myself would delight to
  fly with these thy wings."</p>

  <p>"Thou?" Croft found that her wish both upset and thrilled him. The
  spontaneous flare of daring it mirrored forth, the flash of the lovely eyes
  that accompanied its expression, the light of its thought on her face, all
  woke a quick admiration. But&mdash;the following consideration of her
  glorious life exposed to the perils of the undertaking roused something like
  consternation in him.</p>

  <p>And as the thought clouded his face and he stammered forth his
  interrogatory exclamation, Naia relaxed the tension of her figure, reclining
  again on the couch. "Nay," she said, "if it fills you with displeasure,
  forget my overquick speech. There shall be new light in Himyra, and Zitu's
  Mouthpiece shall ride above all .men's heads, on the wings, of his devising,
  that they may behold him and wonder at his wisdom. What else?" Mentally,
  Croft winced at the subtle turn of her words. Almost it seemed to him that
  she purposely misunderstood his hesitation, seeking thereby to mask the
  temporary loss of her own pose, the well-nigh forward interest she had
  displayed. But, aside from an inward emotion, he gave no sign that he noted
  the personal bias of her rejoinder.</p>

  <p>"In the afternoon there will be a ball game," he said. "Robur and I will
  select the teams."</p>

  <p>"Base-ball?" Suddenly Naia laughed. Her arms rose, and she clasped her
  hands behind her head. Her whole figure, clad in white, embroidered over the
  breasts and about the hem in scarlet, blue, and green, with small gems to
  produce something like a Persian effect, stretched its supple length in an
  almost indolent fashion. She began toying with the ends of its fringed
  girdle. "Robur tells me 'tis a game you brought with you from
&mdash;earth."</p>

  <p>Abruptly Croft became aware of the scrutiny of her eyes, for the space of
  a heartbeat, then they were again inspecting her girdle's fringe "Yes," he
  answered, sensing that once more she was groping for some sign in his words
  or manner "Have you witnessed a game?"</p>

  <p>Naia nodded, without looking up. "Robur insisted, after he had contrived
  to throw a ball through my chamber window and drop it into the mirror pool
  with a most surprising splash, to say nothing of waking me with the water in
  my face."</p>

  <p>Croft smiled. He suspected Rob had been continuing his experiments with
  the intricacies of curves.</p>

  <p>"Since then," Naia went on, "I have been seeking to aid him in the
  mornings with something he desires to learn. It seems that he declares a ball
  may be thrown so that it changes its direction in the air, and I confess
  that, watching one of the team pitchers whom he pointed out at a game, it
  appeared that it was done. We have risen and worked for several mornings
  together; but, besides breaking two windows and some flower urns, we have
  little to show for our pains. Gaya declares he will destroy the palace unless
  you teach him the trick on your return."</p>

  <p>"I shall join you in the morning," said Jason, laughing, as her red lips
  smiled.</p>

  <p>Naia regarded the arches of her pink feet, bared save for sandals of
  scarlet gnuppa leather, caught about her slender ankles by silver bands, to
  which were linked chains of silver running up on either side of the heel and
  between the toes. "Then," said she, "shall I let you take the ball when he
  throws it. I confess it burns my hands. As to this new light&mdash;what does
  it burn, since it neither smokes nor flames?"</p>

  <p>"A substance," said Croft, "made from koal." And now as he spoke he
  watched his companion in turn. And suddenly he met her eyes in a glance that
  thrilled&mdash;a glance that spoke of recollection, that seemed for an
  instant to flash him a voiceless question, yet one whose meaning to him was
  plain. And for a moment it seemed that an actual question trembled on the
  lips of the perfect mouth he watched, before Naia spoke in an almost
  breathless fashion.</p>

  <p>"Koal&mdash;the strange, black stone you have set men to digging in the
  region to the west? Jason&mdash;how knew you where to find what, before your
  coming, In all Aphur was unknown?"</p>

  <p>Croft's heart leaped, both at what he felt was the animus back of the
  query, and the fact that now, for the first time to him in the unity of soul
  and body, she had used his name. And suddenly daring the issue, he let his
  eyes sweep from her golden head to pink-nailed toes, in a glance that was
  subtly like a caress, before he answered slowly: "I came upon its locality on
  a day when my body lay sleeping and my spirit wandered as you have heard that
  it does. Some might say that Zitu showed it to me&mdash;in a dream."</p>

  <p>Naia of Aphur went pale. Her color faded. One of her hands crept up and
  lay above her heart. For a moment she plainly struggled for control, and then
  she faltered: "A dream, say you&mdash;a dream?"</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. "Yes.. Did you not speak to me yourself of one such, in
  which you had learned of my intent concerning the use of water to bring new
  light to Himyra? Said you not as much the afternoon of that sun on which you
  and Hupor came upon me by the stream?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, aye&mdash;oh, aye, indeed." Naia's tone was listless, weary. "Yet am
  I not Mouthpiece of Zitu. Who am I to dream?"</p>

  <p>And suddenly Jason Croft caught a breath deep into his lungs. Close to the
  borderland between spirit and body were they in that moment, and he knew
  it&mdash;close, very close. A little more thought, a little more pondering
  and questioning of itself, and this girl's spirit must spread the wings of
  the soul in conscious understanding of the truth. His eyes lighted at the
  recognition of that fact. His nostrils tensed a trifle about the angle at
  thought of all it must mean.</p>

  <p>"No, Mouthpiece of Zitu are you not called," he said. "Nor is there any
  mouthpiece of Zitu, save through the soul of man. Yet are you daughter of Ga,
  and a woman, through whom man's soul must pass before man be man indeed. Thou
  art the door between man and Zitu, and in so much nearer than man to
  him."</p>

  <p>Then for a moment he paused and sat with a fear beginning to stir within
  him lest he had dared too much. For she said nothing, nor moved. Nor did she
  look at him, or, as he fancied, at any objective thing. She lay reclining,
  her body rising and falling to a long, slow rhythm of breathing, her gaze
  directed off across the shimmering ripple of the pool. But as he watched, her
  expression softened, became rapt&mdash;as though the purple eyes beneath her
  long-fringed lashes were beholding what save to herself was an invisible
  thing. Her lips moved without sound. But Croft, reading their motion, knew
  that they framed two of his own words: "The door."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;the door&mdash;above which Azil spreads his wings," Croft
  repeated softly.</p>

  <p>Once more he broke off and sat waiting. Because his words had been almost
  an allusion to the betrothal gift of Tamarizian men to their women&mdash;that
  seal of Azil she had torn from her girdle and returned in scorn to him. And
  that she would understand it, considering how largely symbolism entered into
  Tamarizian speech, he felt assured.</p>

  <p>Nor was he kept long in suspense. Naia's steady breathing broke its
  rhythm. With a lithe movement she first sat up on the couch, then lifted
  herself to her feet. Her eyes turned toward him. The introspective light was
  gone from their blue depths. They blazed with a purple fire. "Enough!" she
  panted as she faced him. "Friend thou art of my cousin, and friend art thou
  to his wife. Mouthpiece of Zitu art thou to my nation, and as such I yield
  you my respect. Yet speak not any more to me such words as these, and let us
  have understanding. Daughter of Ga am I, and a woman as thou knowest; but one
  for whom not&mdash;any more does Azil spread his wings."</p>

  <p>She paused and stood before him, head back-tilted on the round, white
  pillar of her throat, arms straightened beside her a trifle extended, drawn a
  trifle back, tense as a tightened cord in all her slender length; staring
  wide-eyed into his eyes, until abruptly she lifted a hand and struck herself
  sharply on the breast and turned from him, crossing the court to disappear
  from sight.</p>

  <p>Beside the pool Croft remained more than a little disturbed by the feeling
  that, urged on by the propinquity for which he had thirsted through weeks, he
  had on this first meeting risked too much. Nor was his mood lightened by the
  fact that Naia failed to appear at the evening meal, and the questioning
  expression in Gaya's glance, which she turned upon him from time to time. As
  a matter of fact, the girl's close presence had gone to his head, and he had
  literally sought to gain from her some sign&mdash;to speak not so much to her
  physical mind as to her soul. But as he sought his chamber that night, it
  appeared that, instead of rousing an answering flash from her spirit, he had
  struck a note which in some way disharmonized.</p>

  <p>And because of that he sought her out, safe once again in the undertaking,
  since should he call her to him in the astral body now, she might well think
  that she dreamed once more&mdash;a dream inspired by his presence in Riir's
  house.</p>

  <p>He willed himself to her. Long practice had made it easy. With him now,
  such things occurred in a flash. It was his intent to summon her forth, speak
  to her such things as he dared not speak yet in the flesh. But once in that
  yellow-draped room of Robur's dwelling where he had thought to find her
  stretched on the amber-jeweled copper couch, he paused&mdash;paused and
  stood waiting and watching, because&mdash;</p>

  <p>Naia knelt, a slender white shape in the dusk of her apartment, before the
  figure of Azil, beside the mirror pool. And as once before, when she had
  cried out to this same Angel of Life against the barter of her body to a
  profligate traitor, for the saving of her nation, so now once more Croft bent
  his head while she prayed:</p>

  <p>"Oh, Azil, who carry life from Zitu to all the daughters of Ga, by his
  command&mdash;thou whose sign I have torn from my girdle and flung at the
  feet of him who gave it, have pity upon me. For truly am I a daughter of Ga.
  And though thy sign I hurled against him, even against the symbol of thy
  widespread wings, yet was my action prompted by an agony of spirit, rather
  than by any wish or intent to show disrespect to thee. And were I wrong, set
  me aright.</p>

  <p>"Spread over me again thy shadow wings&mdash;let me once more be
  altogether daughter of Ga, thy mother&mdash;not barren, but a fruitful thing.
  Or were my impious act too great to be forgotten&mdash;if against me thy
  wings are folded&mdash;if woman's birthright I may not hold, nor mirror the
  life of him, as this pool mirrors thy form within it&mdash;if I may not be
  that Door of Life he called me&mdash;have pity, Azil; Zitu have pity; have
  pity Ga, and teach me a new strength."</p>

  <p>She rose. Her arms lifted. For a moment she stood so before the carved
  figure. Then her lips moved. "Jason," they faltered. Her breath caught in a
  sob. She turned and threw herself upon her couch.</p>

  <p>"Beloved!" Croft let the cry of his thrilling soul steal forth. "Beloved
  you have called me. Beloved, I am here." Naia of Aphur stiffened in every
  soft line and curve. She lifted her head as one who listens. She lifted her
  slender body on her rounded arms. Then slowly, in a wide-eyed wondering
  fashion, since Croft had not waited for sleep to claim her on this night of
  nights when he had heard the confession of her love in the sacred shrine of
  her night-wrapped chamber, she sat up.</p>

  <p>And now the borderland between objective and sub-conscious knowledge was
  narrow&mdash;very, very narrow indeed&mdash;the consciousness of soul and
  body was divided by no more than a breath, a hair. Croft felt that it
  quivered as the woman sat there, rapt of expression. "Jason," she whispered
  again at last. "Beloved&mdash;come forth!" Close by the form of Azil, Croft
  took his station, moved by the sudden impulse that for this girl who prayed
  to be made once more all woman he was as Azil himself.</p>

  <p>The form of Naia swayed. It bent. Slowly it sagged down and lay relaxed
  upon the couch. And between it and Croft where he waited, there appeared the
  diaphanous, swaying, scintillating outline of her astral shape.</p>

  <p>"Jason!" And now for the third time she cried it gladly with her
  quivering, flaming lips. "Jason&mdash;Azil!" She stretched out yearning
  hands. "Thou hast come to me again."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Croft, opening his own embrace and drawing her inside its
  circle. "Yes, I have come&mdash;to tell you your prayer is answered&mdash;to
  tell you that of all laws of Zitu, the greatest of all is love&mdash;that
  love in which Ga brought Azil forth before he came to Palos to teach men the
  way of life. Wherefore for Azil himself I speak when I say, as I have said
  before, that for me&mdash;for me, and for me alone, you guard the shrine of
  life&mdash;that some day, once more I shall place upon thy girdle that sign
  that in Zitra you flung against my breast." "Thou hast it?" The contained
  fire of her substance glowed.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Croft smiled. "And some day the fleshly hands of Jason shall pin it
  fast."</p>

  <p>"I was mad, mad!" his companion panted. "Much thinking, the shock of
  learning thee other than I had thought, had made my heart sick, my mind
  unsettled&mdash;too much I thought of the man, and not enough of the
  spirit&mdash;the real you that is here with me now, as with you the real me
  is here. Ah, Jason, Jason&mdash;one time in Lakkon's palace we stood thus
  together in the body, and I&mdash;I yielded you&mdash;my mouth."</p>

  <p>"As once more you yield it." Croft lowered his lips to the strange,
  lambent outline of hers beneath them. He kissed her in a strange kiss such as
  he had never dreamed of&mdash;a thing all inexpressible softness, seeming to
  hold in its contact a something that tingled like fire. And as though that
  fire were a strange, cosmic solvent, for an instant as short as a breath, as
  long as eternity, it was as though their two individualities dissolved and
  flowed together, blended into one.</p>

  <p>Croft tore away his mouth. The thing had been too real. It left a weird,
  staggering sensation quivering through him, and the form within his strong
  arms quivered. Its auric fires of white and gold and purple were more radiant
  than they had ever been. Naia's hands clung to him. Her eyes were uplifted.
  "Go&mdash;go!" she panted. "Send me back to my body. Yet wait not so long to
  come to me again."</p>

  <p>"In the morning I shall see you with Robur," said Croft as he released
  her. For now he felt assured that she was very, very close to a conscious
  understanding of the nature of their love&mdash;its wonder&mdash;its
  glory&mdash;its truth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">XV. &mdash; THE KING'S MESSENGER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AND that she stood very near indeed to the threshold of
  understanding, the weeks that followed their third astral meeting showed.</p>

  <p>It showed in a changed demeanor of their meeting the next day. Croft waked
  with the sound of her voice in his ears, and lay for an instant startled in
  the half world between waking and slumber before he realized that it drifted
  from the bathing court of the palace.</p>

  <p>Instantly he sprang up, recalling her words of the day before concerning
  Robur's daily practice at throwing curves with a baseball. He glanced out.
  Already Naia and her cousin were at work. Croft had overslept, as it seemed,
  but now his pulses quickened at the picture Naia made.</p>

  <p>As he reached the window Robur threw the ball, and the princess ran to
  retrieve it. All in white she was&mdash;a single fluttering garment, its
  skirt tucked up and caught together for greater freedom of movement,
  revealing a flashing play of speeding limbs. Bare on the tiles of the
  tessellated pavement were her pink-arched flying feet, and bare her
  outstretched reaching arms. And her hair, free, was a cloud of flying gold
  about her face. An old-time story flashed into Jason's mind. So he thought
  might Atalanta have appeared, free-limbed, glorious, and unrestrained, as she
  ran her race. He turned away, tearing his eyes from her youth and grace and
  beauty, and hastened to dress.</p>

  <p>As he came forth five minutes later, she flung the ball with a truly
  feminine overhead gesture to where her cousin stood. "Zitu, my cousin!" she
  teased with a flash of milk-white teeth between the twin crimson portals of
  her mouth. "You throw wider of the mark, and still more wide. To me it seems
  that you lack that which you speak of in Jason's words as 'control.' Thy
  ambition to be a pitcher stands in sorry case."</p>

  <p>And then she caught sight of Jason himself and broke off, while across her
  lovely face there stole a flush as soft as the dawning Sirian light&mdash;a
  flush as beautiful as that on the bosom of rising Aurora, Croft thought. She
  was panting somewhat, perhaps from her exertions, perhaps from an inward
  emotion as she turned toward him and held out a tapering hand. "Hai, Jason!"
  Her red lips changed the object of their speaking, and her blue eyes met his
  fully. "It is morning&mdash;and&mdash;I see you again."</p>

  <p>"And I thee," said Croft as he touched her fingers&mdash;"fairer, more
  beautiful and altogether lovelier than the dawn itself. Thy voice awaked me
  and told me I was late for our play with the ball."</p>

  <p>But his blood was singing, his pulses pounding. The thrust of his heart
  was a visible beating at the base of his stalwart throat. For her words had
  been but a paraphrase of that promise he had spoken to the soul of her he had
  held the past night in his arms. And more than any others she might have
  spoken, they told him that at last, as a waking woman, she began to
  understand.</p>

  <p>Yet he gave no further sign, and Naia herself seemed contented with that
  one brief interchange. "Aye, teach him, instruct him, and thou canst. He is
  willing, but he accomplishes little with a vast amount of work to himself and
  my feet and hands."</p>

  <p>And Jason laughed with a wonderful exultation coursing through him as he
  took the ball from Robur, who had approached.</p>

  <p>Thereafter for a half-hour he instructed, and Naia retrieved the
  Aphurian's wild heaves and pitches, until by degrees Robur gained the partial
  mastery of a simple inward curve; and Naia, her face dewed with a fine
  moisture from her part of the practice, protested against any more that
  morning, declaring instead for a bath, and moving toward the pool, loosening
  her garment on the shoulder as she walked.</p>

  <p>It fell from her, leaving her in the Tamarizian costume employed by her
  sex when both men and women bathed&mdash;a sort of harness about the back and
  shoulders&mdash;thin, glinting chains of metal supporting gem-incrusted
  shields above the breast&mdash;a girdle at the waist to fasten about her
  hips, a gold and purple covering, not unlike a pair of trunks. Croft was
  acquainted with the fashion, but never before had he seen Naia so revealed.
  He caught his breath with an audible inhalation, and became aware that Robur
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Go," he suggested as he moved to join Naia in the sun-kissed water. "Tell
  Bela to ask Gaya for a garment, and join us in the pool."</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. He hastened away. He found Gaya's maid, and once with the
  trunklike article she produced, lost no time in putting it on and returning
  to the court where Naia and Robur were now contesting in the water, with
  choking word and laugh. In a clean dive, he cut its surface, shot across the
  full width of the pool, and came up at Naia's side.</p>

  <p>Her hand crept out and lay against him. Almost it seemed to him that she
  sought the contact. "You are strong, O Jason. You should be at home in the
  water, even as an Acquor," she said with a quick-drawn breath.</p>

  <p>There was a hint of witchery in her smile, however, as Croft knew. The
  Acquor was a gaudy aquatic creature, colored something like a pheasant, with
  the head of a goose, red legs, and blue, webbed feet. Consequently he laughed
  as he replied: "Work in the mountains has reddened my skin, it is true, O
  little fish of gold and purple and silver&mdash;yet have a care, since the
  Acquor eats little fish that it catches in the water." "Zitu!" Naia
  exclaimed, as very much like a silver fish, indeed, she dived.</p>

  <p>Thereafter Croft forgot all else save her new mood and her presence, until
  Robur announced that it was growing late, and that he had many things that he
  must discuss with Croft.</p>

  <p>In such fashion, however, did he enter upon the multitudinous energies
  that marked the following Himyran days. He plunged into them and their
  endeavors with a song in his heart. Indeed, it was as though the absence
  which until now he had actually courted had worked its effect on them
  both&mdash;as though that propinquity which followed brought now a sort of
  reflex attitude into their bearing toward one another, swung them from one
  extreme to the other more than anything else.</p>

  <p>That first day Croft started work on the ovens to produce his coke. With
  Robur he talked over all his plans. He drove out to the site of his hangars
  and inspected the rising sheds. He returned to the shops of the carpenter
  caste, and set in motion the work of assembling the airplane wings. He
  inspected the bodies, found fault and made corrections, looked into the motor
  plant, and ordered the captains there to speed up their work. He drove to the
  glass plant from there, and gave orders for the making of his arc-lamp
  bodies. He seemed inspired with a ceaseless energy, which finally drove Robur
  into comment:</p>

  <p>"Zitu&mdash;Jason, my friend, where is the need for such haste?"</p>

  <p>Then, and then only, did he realize with what a restless energy, what a
  tireless thrill of driving force, he had moved from place to place.</p>

  <p>"None, Rob," he said with a quick-caught inhalation: "save that today the
  fire of life burns high within me, and my spirit seeks action, not rest." He
  broke off and lifted his own hand to the spot where Naia's fingers had lain
  that morning on his flesh.</p>

  <p>And, as so often, Robur seemed in a measure to catch his thought. "Is she
  not beautiful as a shaft of Zitu's own light?" he inquired, and looked into
  Jason's eyes. "Gaya is beautiful, too, and I love her; yet I think thy belief
  that she is the other half of thy soul is true. For Mouthpiece of Zitu are
  ye, and wiser than all other men of Palos, and Naia of Aphur, my cousin, is
  divine."</p>

  <p>"Thou hast said it. Her beauty drives me as the whip against the gnuppa's
  flank. It quickens my endeavor, forces me to fresh effort&mdash;" Croft
  began, and broke off as a captain, followed by a servant from the palace,
  appeared in the door of the room wherein they stood.</p>

  <p>"Hai, Robur!" the captain exclaimed, advancing with uplifted hand. "Here
  is one who seeks thee, as he says it, by command."</p>

  <p>"Speak," said Robur, turning to the other&mdash;one of a number of
  Mazzerian runners who as messengers were kept always at hand.</p>

  <p>The blue man saluted in formal fashion. "One from Zitra awaits thee at the
  palace. Even now others seek you from place to place."</p>

  <p>"Go. Say that I come." Robur dismissed him and turned to Croft. A pucker
  of thought lay between his eyes. "This may be from my father. I know not the
  nature of his message, but&mdash;my friend, accompany me in this."</p>

  <p>Jason nodded. His heart warmed again, as so often, to this man. No
  matter what word Jadgor might have sent, Robur, the son of Jadgor, was his
  friend. David and Jonathan&mdash;the comparison flashed in his mind as they
  left the glass-blowers' shop and entered the motor to drive swiftly back to
  the palace at once. David and Jonathan! It had been something like that
  between them from the first. He sensed the subtle way in which, in the
  present instance, the Aphurian was giving demonstration, that whatever stand
  Jadgor might have taken toward Croft, his son would follow the dictates of
  love and honor in his stand.</p>

  <p><BR>
IN the huge, red-paved court they left the motor and, passing between the
  portal guards, made their way swiftly, side by side, to the audience-hall
  where once Croft had seen Kyphallos of Cathur received by Jadgor, Aphur's
  king. A man with the circle and cross on his breast&mdash;Jadgor's
  emissary&mdash;was waiting there for their coming now. As the two friends
  appeared, he rose.</p>

  <p>"Greeting to Robur, governor of Aphur and son of Jadgor, who sends me to
  him," he began, producing a ring that Croft himself had often seen on
  Jadgor's finger and pressed it into Robur's hand.</p>

  <p>Robur glanced at it and nodded. "Say on," he replied.</p>

  <p>"On Bithur, Mazzer makes war."</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Robur started and turned his eyes to Croft.</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. Beyond a narrowing of his eyes, he gave no sign of the
  quiver of surprise that shook him. "Let us sit down and hear the rest of it,"
  he advised.</p>

  <p>Robur waved his father's emissary to a seat and found one of his own. "And
  now thy story, and quickly," he urged, while Croft found a place by his
  side.</p>

  <p>"As thou knowest who led an army into Bithur when Zollaria made war," the
  Zitran resumed; "there was promised to Mazzer, for her help of the children
  of Zitemku to the north&mdash;whom Zilla take to himself&mdash;certain of the
  expected spoils. And as thou knowest, in all that was contemplated, both
  Zollaria and Mazzer failed. Yet was Mazzer promised a free highway down
  Bithur's principal river to the Central Sea. Mazzer, encouraged thereto as
  thy father thinks-by Zollaria perchance, now presses this demand. Bithur,
  being not as Aphur and Nodhur and even Milidhur, supplied with the new
  weapons they used against Helmor's armies, is weak. Already have there been
  clashes between the blue men, better armed than ever before, and the men of
  Bithur along the border.</p>

  <p>"Towns have been burned&mdash;fields laid waste&mdash;women carried into
  the forests, and men and children slain. Wherefore Jadgor commands you this.
  Send to Bithur the armored moturs, and a thousand men with the new weapon
  that shoots metal and fire with the death-dealing bolts of metal they
  discharge. For since all Tamarizia is one nation, it is fitting and just that
  the weak should cry for aid in their need to the strong, and that the strong
  should hear. Jadgor, who sits on Hiranur's throne as head of Tamarizia, has
  spoken. Let Robur of Aphur give ear to his words and obey." "Aphur hears."
  Robur inclined his head. "Say to Hiranur that Aphur obeys. The moturs, the
  men, and the weapons go to Bithur at once. Man of Zitra, you will refresh
  yourself ere your return." "Nay." Already the other was on his feet. "This
  matter gives no rest. I return so soon as Aphur's obedience is assured. Zitu
  speed the fulfilment of your promise." As Croft and Robur rose he bowed and
  left the room.</p>

  <p>Robur turned toward Croft. "Revenge," he said. "A war of revenge, my
  friend. Zollaria, cheated of her foul designs, would harass Bithur's borders.
  Hai!" His eyes flashed. "So be it. We shirk not what Zitu sends. Jason, go
  with me. Help me to send what is needed forth."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Croft nodded, and for the rest of that long day the drive of energy
  within him found full vent. Runners were dispatched to notify the captains of
  the civic guard, and a sufficient number of the veterans of Croft's riflemen
  in the Zollarian war. Cases of cartridges were loaded into the motor galleys
  along the quays. Six of the armored motors Croft had designed and used
  against Helmor's legions went roaring through the streets and snorted their
  ungainly way aboard the waiting ships. What Aphur had been called upon to
  furnish, she set about providing without delay.</p>

  <p>And yet, though in no way was he glad of this fresh need of armed force on
  Palos; there was no satisfaction in his soul at the thought of dead men, and
  women carried captive into the Mazzerian towns. Now and then as he worked,
  superintending that transshipment of men and munitions, Croft smiled. And his
  smile was strange as he found himself wondering just how Jadgor would meet
  this flank attack&mdash;this guerrilla warfare hurled against his most poorly
  prepared state by that beaten nation to the north, which Jadgor seemed
  inclined to take credit to himself for having defeated in war.</p>

  <p>And that night, because there were things he wanted to know, he decided to
  learn them in the same way he had learned many, many things to his own and
  Tamarizia's advantage before. He willed himself to Zitra, to the palace and
  the presence of the man who had boasted to Zitu's Mouthpiece of his
  strength.</p>

  <p>Zitra lay, all crystal and white and silver, under the triple moons. And
  then he was in a room with Jadgor and Lakkon and another&mdash;a stranger,
  whom he learned from the following conversation was a man of Bithur, Parthys
  by name.</p>

  <p>The latter was speaking as Croft came in.</p>

  <p>"By Zitu!" he exclaimed. "These bands are led by men of Zollaria, beyond
  any question. Some there are who have been killed in the fighting,
  and&mdash;they have stained blue their skins and dyed red their fair
  hair.</p>

  <p>"Beaten in fair fight, she sends her captains to lead these barbarians
  against us&mdash;to outrage our women, and dash out the brains of sucklings
  and destroy our men. Jadgor, this was planned. Even among the men of Mazzer
  among us have there been whispers, so that blue men have slain the Bithurians
  in whose homes they were employed, and information has been transmitted from
  among us to our foes. This is Zollaria's vengeance she sends another to
  fulfill. Like a blue swarm of stinging insects, they swarm against us. Ten
  towns lie in ashes. Medai, our governor, is gathering our people for defense
  so quickly as may be. Yet, and aid be not sent us quickly, Zitu himself knows
  what may be endured."</p>

  <p>Jadgor's dark face grew darker still at this report. He struck the table
  by which he sat a characteristic blow with his fist. "By Zitemku, the fiend
  whose spawn they are, they shall pay double price for what they have
  undertaken," he declared. "For aid I have sent already to Aphur. By now a
  swift galley should have arrived at Himyra, bearing my agent to the governor,
  my son. Once has Jadgor, when of Aphur, saved Tamarizia from Zollaria's
  designs. Fear not, Parthys of Bithur, that with the same means Helmor was
  vanquished, we shall punish this blue horde."</p>

  <p>"Yet were it not better"&mdash;Lakkon put out a hand and touched the
  corded forearm of his brother-in-law, still tensed as it held his sinewy
  fingers doubled into an almost hammerlike fist&mdash;"were it not wiser,
  Jadgor, to ask the advice of him to whom much of our success against
  Zollaria, and the return of Mazhur to the nation, is due?"</p>

  <p>The Mouthpiece of Zitu turned his eyes. "By Zitemku, Lakkon, where are thy
  wits? Must Zitu, even through his Mouthpiece, teach us our lessons twice?
  Have we not the weapons that carried death into Helmor's ranks by the
  thousands of souls? Know we not how to use them? Know we not that a thousand
  men so armed are the match for five, yes, for ten thousand equipped with
  sword and shield? And a thousand of such men I have asked from Robur, with a
  number of the moturs which ground Helmor's guard in the last battle beneath
  their crushing wheels. Enough! In four suns I myself shall go to Bithra, with
  our noble Parthys, to confer with Medai. When the Aphurian galleys arrive I
  myself shall take the field. Thou, as my agent, shall stay here till I
  return. Small need to question Zitu's Mouthpiece in a matter such as
  this."</p>

  <p>Parthys nodded. "Your words strengthen the heart, O Jadgor," he resumed.
  "In four suns we shall depart? That is well. As yet it appears that only
  Bithur is attacked. Were it not wise to send word into Milidhur, lest along
  her borders these blue men forget the barter of hides and dried meats and
  cheese, and turn to war?"</p>

  <p>"Aye." Jadgor nodded. "He who is warned is best prepared. Lakkon in the
  morn see to it. Let Milidhur be watchful for the slightest hostile sign along
  her borders. Then shall we teach this spawn of Zitemku to pluck Zollaria's
  vengeance for her; and should we capture some of these seeming men of Mazzer
  who have dyed themselves to play a part, I swear they shall wear their false
  tintings ever."</p>

  <p>At least it was clear that Jadgor realized the nature of the trouble along
  the eastern border. How completely he would be able to meet it was a question
  which time alone would show. On the face of things, he was acting promptly
  and in a calmly thought out way. Had there been one single thing in his whole
  course open to objection, it would have been his overconfidence of the final
  issue which Croft would have criticised. But as he flitted back to Himyra he
  was fully aware that Jadgor was one of the few men in all Tamarizia versed in
  the art of war&mdash;was a good general in so far as Palosian methods of
  warfare went. And it appeared that, with Bithur's man-power organized and
  augmented by the thousand rifles, the six armored motors from Himyra, Jadgor,
  even as he himself had declared, was very apt to make short work of Mazzer's
  naked horde.</p>

  <p>Hence, as much because he wished to so believe as for any other reason, it
  was with the feeling that the affair along the Bithur borders was no more
  than a tempest in a teapot that he opened the eyes of his body and turned
  himself on his couch. Let Jadgor handle it in his own fashion, since he felt
  fully able, as no doubt he was, with the aid he had asked from Aphur, even
  now going rapidly into the galleys where Himyra's fire-urns flared along the
  quays, and the little cars trundled down the merchandise tunnels, bearing
  cartridges and rifles. As for himself, Croft smiled. He had plenty to do in
  Himyra, and&mdash;Naia of Aphur had gleamed like a blade of silver that
  morning as she cut her slender way through the waters of the pool. Only he
  had called her a little silver fish, and she had cried out and dived. He rose
  and lighted an oil sconce, and found the silver medallion, with its embossed
  figure of Azil and its circle of blood-red stones. Placing it in his palm, he
  sat staring at this amulet that had once proclaimed her his.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">XVI. &mdash; BETWEEN HIMYRA AND THE SUN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN the weeks that followed, many things transpired. The line
  of poles stretched its length from the power station to Himyra, and men were
  stringing wires. Croft made coke, ground it into powder, mixed it with a
  cohesive substance, and molded it into carbon cores, to serve his growing
  arcs. Also, he began experimenting in the construction of batteries, both
  moist and dry cells. He succeeded with the former from the first and for
  these experiments he demanded of Robur, and obtained, the use of an unused
  room in the palace, where he often worked at nights.</p>

  <p>Chemistry, as an exact science, was unknown on Palos, but through
  consultations with the local caste of physicians Croft managed to collect a
  certain number of crudely refined salts which they commonly used as drugs.
  The room where Croft delved into the simpler mysteries of nature became an
  apartment of wonder to Robur, who came to it first himself, and later brought
  Gaya and Naia.</p>

  <p>And on the night of their first coming, Croft explained the laws of
  chemical affinity as best he could to the three, comparing the force that
  drew the ions together with love, and caught a comprehending flash from
  Naia's blue eyes.</p>

  <p>Thereafter she came as she willed when he worked, and watched while he
  struggled with his far from satisfactory equipment, and asked a hundred
  questions, until he suggested that she assist him, whereupon she accepted
  with a readiness that filled him with surprise. Night after night thereafter
  she donned a coarse smock and labored at his side, finding a new world open
  before her with the wide-eyed interest of a child; beholding for the first
  time the deliberate manipulation of the hidden forces of nature, beginning at
  length to understand man's right and power to use them to his advantage,
  direct them and command, to look upon them not as some supernatural
  manifestation, but as a wholly natural thing.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile in the motor shops, Croft's by now expert force were assembling
  the first two airplanes. And in the same place, since he could work there as
  well as anywhere else, and supervise their work at the same time, he and
  Robur spent a part of each day constructing a resistance coil and a temporary
  switch on a slab of the marble white stone so much in evidence on Palos,
  against the day when the new light should be shown to Himyra first.</p>

  <p>At the end of two weeks, however, he moved the now finished wings and
  bodies in which the motors had been installed to the hangars and installed a
  force of men with them there to complete the work. Meanwhile at night he kept
  up his search for a satisfactory dry cell, telling Naia that the success of
  the flying machine depended upon it; so that when at last he succeeded, and
  she felt the current tingle through her fingers for the first time, she cried
  out in delight.</p>

  <p>And in those two weeks, as Gaya had planned, as Croft had known must
  happen, constant association and education had its effect. As they played
  ball in the mornings, and bathed, and worked, and sought for strange, new
  results such as the woman had never dreamed in all her existence, they drew
  closer and closer together in their aims, their every interest, their
  understanding, than they had ever been. In his own way and by his own
  methods, Croft was rapidly raising the woman, whom as a woman he worshiped,
  toward his own mental plane. Thus in the end she came to a realization that
  those things which had once seemed as much a miracle to her as to any of her
  people, might very well be manifestation of natural law within the grasp of
  man.</p>

  <p>His dry cells perfected, the success of his engine ignition
  assured&mdash;several arcs nearing the finished stage of their construction,
  Croft had a new thought. He decided that after his demonstration of the
  airplanes at Himyra, he might wish to exhibit them at Zitra, and altered his
  plans somewhat as a result, and equipped each plane with a set of buoyant
  pontoons, thereby converting them to the type of flying fish more nearly than
  anything else. He explained his reason for this to Naia, with whom he was now
  talking everything over fully, and she smiled.</p>

  <p>"On the water they will run as well as through the air," she said, when he
  had finished. "Jason&mdash;you must teach me to fly as well as everything
  else."</p>

  <p>And as on the first afternoon of his coming to Himyra from the mountains,
  Jason frowned. "I like not the thought. There is danger in this flying."</p>

  <p>"Danger?" Naia of Aphur arched her brows. "Think you I have any fear?"
  "No," he hastened to assure her. "It is Jason who for thee would be
  afraid."</p>

  <p>For an instant she colored and then went a trifle pale. "And what of Naia
  of Aphur, think you, when Jason dares this danger, my friend?"</p>

  <p>"It is a matter of knowledge," Croft said quickly, thrilled by her hinted
  meaning. "I have driven them before."</p>

  <p>"On earth?" Naia's pupils widened swiftly, making almost black pools of
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, on earth, where they use them also in the battles of their
  wars."</p>

  <p>"Hai!" cried Naia sharply, with a quiver of her finely chiseled nostrils
  as she caught the picture his words conveyed. "To rise and wheel and
  fight&mdash;to struggle like great birds in the air. This earth of which you
  speak must be a wonderful place."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Croft, as he went on and told her many things, describing
  among others the aviator's dress.</p>

  <p>"And what will Jason wear on Palos?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Croft laughed. "I had not given it any attention. I must consider the
  matter. Perhaps a garment fashioned out of gnuppa hide."</p>

  <p>Naia nodded. Suddenly her scarlet lips were smiling. "In my mind I see as
  in a painting these leather-clad men of earth. Leave the matter of your
  apparel to Naia, and you will, O Jason," she replied.</p>

  <p>And Croft assented, filled with both pleasure and surprise.</p>

  <p><BR>
THEN came a night to Aphur very much like that before the first motor was
  finished&mdash;a night when a very few hours would see the first pair of
  airplanes done. And that night Croft remained at the hangars, examining,
  tuning, testing and testing again the motor he meant to demonstrate to Robur
  and the gaping workmen, with the dawn. Over and over he turned on the spark
  and sent the giant-voiced engine spinning with an ever-steadying hum. Under
  the flare of oil slushes burning about him, he looked into the face of the
  captain in charge of the hangar crew and found his bronzed skin pale.</p>

  <p>"Thou wilt dare it, Mouthpiece of Zitu?" the fellow said in a tone of awed
  deference, meeting Croft's glance. "Thou wilt attempt in this device to mount
  the air? Brave men have there been in Tamarizia, aye and brave women, yet
  none like to thee before."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" said Jason, and laughed with a catch in his breath. For indeed
  he was thrilling with a vast sense of accomplished purpose as the motor
  roared. "With the sun I shall be a thousand vestrons over your head," he
  declared, meaning thereby approximately three thousand feet. And he laughed
  again, more in sheer nervous tension than from any humor as the captain
  instinctively tipped back his head and stared at the hangar roof.</p>

  <p>Satisfied at length that everything was ready, he threw himself on a
  pallet, from which he rose at dawn. To his rousing cry came the captain and
  his men. The doors of the hangar were opened, and the first airplane on which
  Sirius had ever shone was trundled out, rolling on wheels affixed to the
  bottoms of each pontoon.</p>

  <p>And even as it appeared, a motor flashed from the blurring shadow of
  Himyra's red walls and dashed toward it along the road. It was Robur coming
  to witness his friend's latest venture, driving in a smother of dust and
  impatience. Leaning against a vane, Croft watched his progress, and so
  received a surprise. Robur was not alone.</p>

  <p>At first Croft noted the fact with wonder, and then with a leaping heart.
  Naia was with him&mdash;Naia of Aphur. He was to make his first attempt to
  scale the air of Palos before her purple eyes. He caught a deep breath, and
  his own eyes flashed as the motor approached, and he went toward it, and
  Robur sprang out.</p>

  <p>"Hail, Jason, Tamarizia's first man-bird!" he exclaimed, glancing from
  Croft to the huge machine. "Zitu, I can scarce believe that so large a thing
  can rise and take to wing."</p>

  <p>"Bird-man, not man-bird, Rob," said Croft, giving Naia a hand to assist
  her from the motor, and becoming aware that she carried a package across her
  knees.</p>

  <p>"Thy garment," she explained, extending it to him. "Go into the cote where
  you house your bird and put it on."</p>

  <p>"My thanks for it, and your presence," Croft accepted and helped her from
  the car. "Hai, Rob&mdash;don't fool with the engine, will you, while I don my
  new attire?" He turned away and disappeared through the hangar doors.</p>

  <p>And there he opened the bundle with unsteady hands and lifted what it
  contained. Trousers, or rather breeches, they seemed of leather as soft as
  the finest earthly ooze grain&mdash;a tunic&mdash;a helmet&mdash;leg cases
  fashioned to strap on. And Naia of Aphur had designed them, had planned them,
  directed their making, had brought them to him this morning. Croft's hand
  actually fumbled the buckles as he put them on. Yet in the end the thing was
  done, and he stepped forth clothed from toe to head in russet brown, save for
  the front of the helmet, through which shone his face.</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" cried Rob, and Naia's eyes were shining as he advanced toward them
  followed by the hangar's crew, and mounted into his seat.</p>

  <p>Over the fuselage edge he looked down directly into their blue depths. And
  suddenly they lost their glint of pleasure, grew dark and a trifle strained
  in the white oval of her face. "Take places!"</p>

  <p>The hangar crew ran to the stations Croft had already assigned.</p>

  <p>"Ready!" Two of the men laid hold of the propeller and sent it around.</p>

  <p>With a roar the engine caught on. A cloud of backdriven dust half veiled
  the men who steadied the huge plane against the drag of the motor holding it,
  checking it as it strained and quivered like a hound against the leash.</p>

  <p>"Let go!"</p>

  <p>The men fell back. The plane quivered, moved slowly in advance. Out across
  that same desert where once Jason had driven the first motor in a mad,
  reckless dash to save Naia of Aphur's life, he now shot forward in the first
  quickening dash of Aphur's first airplane. Forward&mdash;faster and
  faster&mdash;faster and faster&mdash;then up. Obedient to his shifting of the
  controls, the huge machine tilted, seemed to rear on its haunches, lifting
  its nose, its wheels, rising, rising&mdash;free of the ground at
  last&mdash;free and rising, higher and higher, up! up!</p>

  <p>Up, Up! A spear-point of the rising sun caught it and set it aglisten as
  it rose. Up, up, its well-tuned motor roaring out the song of a marvel's
  birth. Up and up against the pink and blue of morning. Up and up, smaller and
  smaller to them who watched it from beside the hangar. Then, as they
  watched, it turned. It turned and flew back above them, five hundred feet in
  air. It began to spiral, ever rising higher above the ground. And suddenly,
  though Croft did not know it at the time, and Robur, lost in amazement, did
  not sense it, Naia of Aphur ran swiftly to the motor and, carrying something
  crushed to her bosom, from there to the doors of the hangar, and
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>Over the fuselage Croft looked down. The hangar was a little shed beneath
  him. The cluster of watchers were a group of ants. A vast elation filled his
  breast. Once more his efforts were crowned with complete success. With no
  more than some minor changes, he felt that his mastery of the Palosian
  atmosphere Was assured. He altered the inclination of his vanes and began
  sliding swiftly down, gliding gracefully back to a rolling stop at the
  end.</p>

  <p>"My friend!" cried Robur, running up. He caught Jason's hand as Croft
  climbed out, and stood clinging to it."</p>

  <p>And though an hour before Croft would have been well satisfied with such
  recognition, he became aware now of hunger for something else. Naia&mdash;it
  was her praise, her congratulations, he wished. He turned his head, seeking
  her presence, and found it, and gasped.</p>

  <p>For Naia of Aphur had changed since he left. No more was she a glowing
  girl in her fluttering garments, waiting to see him essay human flight with
  bated breath. Gone were the filmy draperies that had swathed her; and
  instead, she stood before him, habited like himself, in a smaller suit of
  brown, which clung to her graceful limbs and supple torso like a loosely
  fitted skin. Gone even were the masses of her golden hair, veiled under a
  helmet of brown.</p>

  <p>But as he met them, her blue eyes were the same. And they were fired with
  a light of excited anticipation. "Again!" she cried. "Again&mdash;and this
  time I shall go with you, Jason&mdash;I would fly!"</p>

  <p>"Naia! My cousin!" Robur started forward a pace in instinctive
  protest.</p>

  <p>"Nay." She wheeled upon him, stamping a small foot incased in the soft,
  brown leather. "Nay, Robur, I shall be the first woman in all Tamarizia to
  fly." She stretched out slender, appealing arms. "Jason&mdash;is there not
  place between your wings for me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." There was something almost a veiled suggestion of wider meaning in
  her words, and Croft caught it as he gave her his hand. The thing was
  madness&mdash;but&mdash;it thrilled him&mdash;excited his admiration afresh
  as he realized that the whole thing was no matter of the instant, no impulse,
  but something she had thought out, planned&mdash;for which she had caused her
  costume to be made at the same time as his own. And he had not the heart to
  deny her, in the flush of his recent success.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said instead as Robur fell back, and caught her under the arms,
  lifting her lightly up, until her foot gained a supporting hold and she
  climbed to her place in the pit of the fuselage.</p>

  <p>And then, settling himself once more in position, Croft cried to his men,
  and once more the engine roared.</p>

  <p>Briefly he glimpsed his companion's face. It was eager, expectant, in the
  morning light. Her breast rose and fell in a barely quickened rhythm under
  its covering of brown.</p>

  <p>"Let go!"</p>

  <p>Once more the plane advanced, jolting, tipping a little, swaying to the
  slight irregularities of the ground it ran ahead. Croft moved a lever. The
  obedient monster answered. The desert fell away beneath. Up, up, Jason of
  earth and Naia of Aphur, daughter of Ga, and child of Palos, swam toward a
  brightening sky of pink and gold. Up and up. Once more he stole a sidelong
  glance at his companion's face. It was lifted, tilted a little back&mdash;its
  blue eyes closed.</p>

  <p>"Naia!" Croft spoke to her above the motor's roar.</p>

  <p>She lifted her lids, met his somewhat anxious regard, and smiled. And from
  him she let her gaze wander over the whole vast panorama of desert and
  mountain and the Central Ocean, blue and green and black and gold, with a
  froth on the nearer waves like a fringe of white to their shadowed flanks as
  it caught the light, and Himyra&mdash;the red city beginning to glow as
  Sirius shot his shafts against its ruddy walls, and like a dull chain,
  supporting the red jewel of the city on the breast of Aphur, the yellow Na,
  outlined as far as the eye could reach by a band of shimmering green.</p>

  <p>And suddenly her breast lifted, her lips parted, and she began to
  sing&mdash;to sing as she had once cried to Croft that the birds she envied
  sang as they rose against the morning&mdash;gladly&mdash;clearly
&mdash;freely as a bird itself might sing.</p>

  <p>So sang Naia of Aphur, between Himyra and the sun.</p>

  <p>After that Croft taught her how to fly. Having once yielded, he could not
  well again refuse. And Naia had her way with him, as she had meant to do ever
  since she first was taken with the notion of herself controlling one of the
  new machines that he had made.</p>

  <p>But the promise to teach her she exacted that same morning after they had
  returned to the palace. Robur ran off to tell Gaya concerning the success of
  the trial flight, and Naia dared Croft to bathe. Afterward he was half
  inclined to think she adopted the time and place to a gaining of her point.
  Woman she would not have been had she not realized her beauty and its appeal.
  But at the time he gave the matter no thought.</p>

  <p>"You will surely teach me to fly?" she said almost as soon as they floated
  side by side.</p>

  <p>"No," he denied in a somewhat uncertain fashion. "This morning I yielded
  because of your great desire to be the first woman of Palos to take to the
  air. In that I was not altogether wise. Again I would not dare."</p>

  <p>"Yet and you yielded to my desire in the matter of this morning, your
  excuse should be the same in yielding to me again, no less. Ah,
  Jason"&mdash;her hand crept out and lay upon his arm&mdash;"now know I the
  feeling of a bird when it rises and sings from pure joy, for the first time
  in my life, and the knowledge thrills me; I would know it again,
  because&mdash;" She broke off with a little, gasping breath.</p>

  <p>"Because of what?" Croft turned his head and looked into her pansy-purple
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Because," said she very slowly, "it is to me as though I was no longer
  mortal&mdash;as though I had in some way left the body&mdash;cast off all
  the weight of the flesh."</p>

  <p>"Naia!" Croft stammered. "Thou knowest?" and paused, strangely shaken at
  the knowledge her words showed.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;since the last time you called me to you. Come and I shall show
  you, Jason." She turned and dived.</p>

  <p>Croft followed. Down, down, he followed her gleaming form through the
  clear water. Down, down, until he swam beside it. And then lost, buried deep
  in its liquid embrace, screened from all observation by the play of the sun
  upon its surface, she turned still closer to him, and for the first time
  since old Zud's blunder had brought misunderstanding she offered him her
  scarlet mouth.</p>

  <p>From that kiss man and woman came up gasping almost as to a new birth.
  Misunderstanding, all barriers of restraint, seemed to have been washed away
  in the shimmering pool's soft flood. "Ah, Acquor, Acquor," Naia panted, "thou
  has caught thy little fish at last."</p>

  <p>"Fear not, little fish," said Croft in a voice which quivered, "I shall
  not eat you, but&mdash;this time I shall surely hold you fast."</p>

  <p>"And you will teach me to fly?" There was witchery in Naia's words and in
  her smile; witchery, whimsy, almost a conscious knowledge that
  now&mdash;now&mdash;she could not be denied.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Croft in open surrender. "And Zitu pity me if aught befall
  thee."</p>

  <p>"Nay, I will be careful," Naia sobered. "And&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And what&mdash;is there something more, beloved?" Croft questioned
  softly.</p>

  <p>"Nay." She lowered her eyes. "I must go fasten my girdle about me lest we
  be late for the morning's meal." She swam toward the sunken steps.</p>

  <p>And suddenly Croft knew&mdash;the thought that had stirred her soul, and
  it set his own soul glowing. In one swift stroke he overtook her. "Beloved,
  beloved," he whispered to her, "on the day the new light comes to Himyra I
  shall once more fasten thy girdle with Azil's seal."</p>

  <p>"The new light&mdash;" The fires in her blue eyes quickened. "Aye, Jason,
  I would wear it in the new light," she said as, side by side, they clambered
  from the pool. "Once in these waters I sought the mouth of Zilla, and in them
  today I found Azil's, beloved, in the touch of yours."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later Croft met Gaya, and she stopped him. "Wise man, and one
  of great wisdom, are you, Jason, as Robur, my husband, tells me, saying,
  accompanied by Naia, you have conquered the air." She put out her hand.</p>

  <p>Croft took it. He bent toward her. "Hark you, Gaya, my sweet friend," he
  said, speaking softly. "The air is nothing. I have conquered something
  else."</p>

  <p>"What mean you?" Gaya questioned.</p>

  <p>"That Naia of Aphur, on the day the new light comes, will wear my seal,"
  Croft told her.</p>

  <p>"Zitu," she exclaimed, smiling, "you have spoken, then, at last. Wise man
  I have confessed you, yet to me you have seemed most blind in this as most
  men are with women. Glad though am I for you both. But now she was in my
  chamber, and radiant as Ga. She declared you would teach her to fly, and
  easily deceived as I was, I thought it that."</p>

  <p>After that two causes hastened Croft's arrangements for the celebration of
  the coming of the light. One was the renewal of his formal betrothal with
  Naia, of course. The other was of a wholly different sort.</p>

  <p>As for Naia, save for the hours he spent in the shops, he was with her the
  greater part of the time, either teaching her the control of a plane, which
  she mastered quickly both on land and water, or in the laboratory, or, in the
  evening, sometimes speaking with her alone, sometimes with Robur and his
  wife. And in the laboratory, one evening shortly after the day of their first
  flight together, Croft spoke to her of love as he had spoken once before but
  with a different meaning. Taking two salts in solution, he poured them
  together.</p>

  <p>"Behold," said he, as he mixed them and formed a substance compounded of
  their blending which fell slowly to the bottom of the glass, "behold,
  beloved, the chemistry of love&mdash;how each atom draws the other atom to
  it, until they blend and are no more, but lose themselves each one within the
  other to form a definite something which was not before!</p>

  <p>"Behold&mdash;for even so, beloved, it is with the souls of men and
  women&mdash;each drawing the other to it; each blending with the other, until
  in the will of Zitu, and they are truly mated, they melt into perfect union,
  and a perfect spirit is born!" It was one way of portraying the doctrine of
  twin souls, the "marriage of the lamb," the birth into angelhood, dependent
  on the union of the two original spiritual halves, and Naia nodded with a
  widening of her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Each draws the other to it," she said, coming close beside him. "Ah,
  Jason, did I draw you to me really from the earth?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, by Zitu," he swore, and slipped an arm about her.</p>

  <p>"Thy need of me brought you unto Palos, even as thou hast called my spirit
  from my flesh."</p>

  <p>"Aye," Croft said in a voice gone husky with emotion. It was the first
  time she had mentioned those astral meetings in a fashion so direct.</p>

  <p>She eyed the new-formed substance in the glass before them. And suddenly
  she smiled. Face, eyes and lips, her whole fair being glowed. "They meet and
  mingle, melt into one another," she went on softly, and lifted his other arm
  and drew it about her form to meet the other. "Ah, Jason, thou messenger of
  Azil to me&mdash;that first night you lay in the palace, yet came and bade
  the presence of my spirit, and held me even so as you are holding me now; it
  was as though I forgot all else and knew thee only; as though I was not, save
  as a part of thee truly, save that I felt the strong fire of thy mouth."</p>

  <p>And, again, on a night when the sky was cloudless and the triple moons had
  turned all the Palosian world to a dreamland of silvered plain and sea and
  mountain, Croft spoke to her of love. That night he drove her to the hangars,
  and they entered a machine. Up, up they whirled through an air aquiver with
  moonbeams; up, up to a land of dreams. And there between the heavens and the
  far-flung landscape they swam in a dream world of their own making, while the
  plane wheeled in wide spun circles, like some huge, dark bat against the
  skies.</p>

  <p>"Behold Palos!" Croft cried to her above the roar of the whirling
  propeller, heard as it swept them forward, yet not seen. "Is it not lovely,
  is it not fair&mdash;this one of all the millions of stars on which we live?
  And yet why is it; for what purpose; why was it brought into existence, even
  as you and I, beloved, and sent spinning through the void from Zitu's hand,
  save for love; save that a million million men and women might find a spot
  whereon their spirits, the real they, should be given substance, in order
  that they should live and meet, and know one another, and&mdash;love.
  Wherefore is the body of man no more than the servant to give to love
  expression, since this is Zitu's plan&mdash;that no man's spirit is complete
  without the woman's, that no woman's spirit Is complete without the man's; so
  that In his wisdom, each ever seeks the other to make it whole and satisfy
  its longing. Thus then is love assured, and life inspired."</p>

  <p>He shut off the engine and began a long, slanting, coasting down a
  moonlighted, sloping path.</p>

  <p>"Love," said the girl beside him, "love so great that it spans the space
  between the stars. And did I call you to me, without knowing, yet now It
  seems to me, beloved, that I should know and find some means to answer, no
  matter where you were."</p>

  <p>In a long sweep Croft brought the plane back to the ground. And then
  without any verbal reply, he lifted her from her seat and bore her back to
  the motor in his arms.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">XVII. &mdash; IN THE GRIP OF WAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was now over five weeks since the relief expedition had
  sailed to Bithur from Himyra, and no word had come from Zitra since.</p>

  <p>Mentally, Croft had allowed at least two weeks for the galleys to reach
  Bithra, the capital of the northeastern state, and unload their motors and
  men. Another week, he figured, should bring them well into contact with the
  Mazzerian forces, if Jadgor moved as quickly as he felt assured he would. And
  drunk as he was with love, busy as he was with his own endeavors, Croft
  forgot not entirely affairs of state.</p>

  <p>As a result he chose a night some weeks after he felt sure the Bithurian
  army and its reinforcements should have reached the Bithurian borders, and
  willed himself to Jadgor's tent.</p>

  <p>A strange sight met his eyes. He swam above what at first appeared to him
  as an enormous grassy plain; and beyond it was a forest, dark in its own
  shadows beneath the moonlight, and beyond that again was a flare of fires.
  Toward these he propelled himself without knowing whither exactly he was
  going, yet arriving to find them the flaring remains of burning houses,
  spread out on yet another open space beside a river, a mere village, such as
  the peasant classes were accustomed to inhabit, rather than one of the larger
  walled towns.</p>

  <p>And around it, through it, their bodies picked out by the moonlight and
  the leaping of the flames, were hundreds&mdash;not of Bithur's soldiers, but
  of leaping, howling, spear-shaking, blood and lust gloated Mazzerian men. And
  beyond it as he saw now, overcoming his first surprise, lay one of the
  armored motors, ringed with intermingled Bithurian and Mazzerian corpses and
  tipped upon its side.</p>

  <p>Disaster! For the first time Croft suspected a Bithurian route. In a flash
  he returned to his original purpose and once more demanded that Ladger's
  position be revealed.</p>

  <p>And now a walled town appeared before him, not so large as Himyra, but
  decidedly greater than Zitra, to judge from the circuit of its walls inside
  which countless fire urns flared. And within those walls, as he sped above
  them, Croft beheld a beaten army's wreck&mdash;two of the motors, parked
  close inside a gate; weary men showing the marks of conflict, stretched out
  beside them in a sodden bivouac.</p>

  <p>Then into a palace, built of what seemed a brown sandstone, with a huge
  inner court paved in green, where fire-urns flared and guardsmen stood before
  a door through which men in armor, with stern, drawn faces passed in and out.
  Croft followed the progress of the latter and so came at last to the presence
  of the man he desired.</p>

  <p>Jadgor, of Tamarizia&mdash;Jadgor, of Aphur&mdash;president of a nation,
  once a haughty king. Jadgor, of Aphur, wounded slightly, with a binding
  bandage wound about his grizzled head, with his armor dust-stained and
  smeared with the grime of conflict, Jadgor scowling like some savage creature
  overborne, driven into a corner, with the sinewy hand of a muscular arm
  fingering in nervous fashion at his sword.</p>

  <p>And about him a cluster of drawn-browed, armored men, one of whom Croft
  judged to be Medai, governor of Bithur, since his armor was jeweled with the
  sign of the state, a green medallion halved by a bar of iridescent crystals,
  to symbolize the mighty river Bith, which crossed it with its flood.</p>

  <p>"Mazzer," said Jadgor, "has loosed upon us her whole horde. Armed are they
  by Zollaria, led by Zollaria's men. By sheer weight of numbers were we
  overborne&mdash;the wings of our army cut so that the center was engulfed.
  Two of the moturs broke down, and those in charge of them knew not the secret
  of the one device which causes them to run, because he who constructed them
  first held the knowledge to himself.</p>

  <p>"The men with the rifles within them were cut off when their supply of
  bullets was gone. Those others so armed, killed so long as their bullets held
  out, when they also fell back before those blue fiends as well. The fault is
  not with the weapons, but with the first seeming of the matter. Men of
  Bithur, we face no barbarian border raiding. This the principal city of your
  eastern lands shall soon be assailed. Men of Bithur, this is war. For fresh
  aid I have sent&mdash;for more men and weapons. Thrice on as many fields have
  we met them, and thrice have we been driven back by press of numbers. They
  swarm like blue vermin, and where one dies two take his place. Yet though
  crushed, we are not vanquished. Wherefore we fall back on Atla as a strong
  place for our defense."</p>

  <p>"Strong walls has Atla," Medai replied. "And Jadgor speaks strong words
  from a strong heart. Yet if this be war indeed inspired and sent upon us, not
  Bithur alone, but all Tamarizia may be affected thereby, if Bithur fall. And
  since he who made these new weapons knows surely best their use, were it not
  well also to send one asking him as Zitu's Mouthpiece, to give us aid?"</p>

  <p>For a single moment Jadgor winced, and then he inclined his head. "Aye,
  Medai of Bithur, so have I done. In the mouth of him who departed for Zitra
  and Himyra, for speech with Zud the high priest, and Robur, my son, have I
  placed words to that effect. For, as you have said, this matter affects not
  one man or another, or even yet one state. The peril lies now to our welfare
  as a nation. Were Jadgor to avail himself not of all means to combat it
  Jadgor were wrong, and, by Zitu, I swear that above all other things in life,
  it is Tamarizia that Jadgor loves."</p>

  <p>Croft thrilled to those words. Here spoke the old-time Jadgor, patriot
  again. Even as the first time he had watched the man and listened, as now, to
  his words, in those days when he sought to strengthen his nation through the
  sacrifice of Naia, hoping so to block Zollaria's plans, so now the
  generalissimo of Tamarizia's forces seemed thinking of his country first.
  Wherefore Croft felt shaken in his soul, so that a responsive emotion toward
  Robur's father waked within him and glowed. And he vowed that such aid as was
  asked he would give, both as Mouthpiece of Zitu, and as a man to whom
  Tamarizia's welfare, both present and future, was identical with his.</p>

  <p>Swiftly he made calculation. At the best it would take eight days for the
  messenger Jadgor had dispatched to arrive. He willed himself back to his own
  apartments in a flash and sat up on his couch. Much might be done in a week
  he thought, and there was much to be done. Jadgor had failed largely because
  the drivers of the motors understood not the nature of the magnetos which
  Croft had kept secret in their making, and the ammunition for the rifles had
  given out. Well, for the first part, he had dry cells now to insure ignition,
  aside from the more complicated device. Motors must be equipped with them
  without delay and the arsenal Robur and he had equipped many Zitrans before,
  set working&mdash;much ammunition, many cartridges and grenades turned
  out.</p>

  <p>He rose and called a guard and sent him for Robur at once. And when he
  came to him, his face somewhat puzzled by this summons from his slumbers, he
  told him all that he had learned, and how.</p>

  <p>And from past experience Robur believed without question. "Zitu!" he
  cried, springing up and standing before Croft with eyes that were flashing.
  "They are driven back on Atla, shut up inside her walls, two of the moturs
  destroyed, their bullets well nigh exhausted. They send for fresh aid. Hai!
  Mouthpiece of Zitu, how do you advise?"</p>

  <p>Croft told him. "Start all men working on more bullets and the bombs we
  throw by hand. Send men to call the assembly together against the time
  Jadgor's messenger comes, yet state not why, save that Robur commands. Order
  all captains of decktarons to hold those men we trained in readiness for a
  possible call to arms. Give these orders merely; say naught as yet of
  war."</p>

  <p>"Aye," Robur nodded, "it shall be done."</p>

  <p>"Speed also," Croft went on, "the completion of the airplanes. In the
  morning I begin training men to fly them when they are done. Also"&mdash;his
  eyes narrowed with a sudden thought&mdash;"Rob&mdash;we shall remove the
  dynamo, and transport it to Atla, after we have shown Himyra this new
  light."</p>

  <p>"Thou wilt do that still&mdash;in the face of this?" Robur stammered.</p>

  <p>Croft nodded. Before his mind's eye floated Naia of Aphur's
  face&mdash;Naia who was to pin the seal of Azil on her girdle the day the
  light he had promised to Himyra was born. Come weal or woe, come war or
  peace, Croft swore naught should interfere with that occasion.</p>

  <p>"Aye," he said, "on the seventh sun from this."</p>

  <p>Yet despite Croft's interdiction on the spreading of the word abroad, Naia
  and Gaya were told&mdash;the latter as Robur's wife, the former as Croft's
  assistant in his work. For from now on she became fully that. Day after day,
  from the hour of the morning bath until late at night, she toiled in the
  laboratory he had equipped in the palace, preparing the chemicals for the dry
  cells, aiding him with a tight-lipped, yet unfaltering purpose while the
  cells were packed, taking full charge in the daytime while he was engaged
  elsewhere on other work. Clad in a coarse smock, acid stained and scorched,
  her hands soiled by the manipulation of reagents, she yet had never to Jason
  presented a fairer, braver sight. She worked. She neither complained nor
  cried out. She gave her service to her country and to him, in the depths of
  her purple eyes an almost Spartan light. And Gaya helped. Day after day she
  labored beside her, under her direction, learning in turn from Naia what she
  had learned from Croft.</p>

  <p>"Are you not glad you have taught me to fly?" Naia questioned one night as
  they worked. "See you not Zitu's hand in this, beloved, since when you are
  gone to this spawn of Mazzer's undoing I may continue your work?"</p>

  <p>"You?" Croft faltered, sickened at the picture of her meaning. "You must
  not. As I have told you, there is danger." "Ah, but"&mdash;her smile was very
  gentle&mdash;"is there not danger to thee as well? Think not my heart is like
  a frightened bird, did it speak in place of my mind. Know you not that to me
  the loss of you blots out the world?"</p>

  <p>"No," Croft cried, and swept her into his arms. "Tis a brave, brave heart,
  beloved!" He caught and held her fingers. "O brave, brave heart!"</p>

  <p>For a moment she lay against him. He felt her shake. Then it was over, and
  she straightened up again. "In three suns," she said, "your seal shall glow
  again on my girdle. Tell me, beloved, for I hunger for the knowledge, how may
  this separation of the spirit from the body, which you have thrice brought
  about within my knowledge, be by oneself attained?"</p>

  <p>"By desire," said Croft. "By a focusing of all the yearning of the soul on
  that one thing&mdash;without doubt, without fear&mdash;by centering the mind
  on its attaining and on the object whereat in that state you wish to arrive;
  for indeed, beloved, it is the desire of the spirit in life that accomplishes
  all things."</p>

  <p>"Desire," she repeated softly, "desire. Aye, now I see. One must forget
  all, save only it, alone to attain it. It must be so great that nothing else
  save only it remains&mdash;as great as the love you have wakened in
  me&mdash;as your desire for me. Ah, beloved, when first Gaya told me of your
  seeking me from earth, I thought it madness, though even then the thought
  itself set me aflame. And then"&mdash;she threw out her arms and stood before
  him glorious in her soul's surrender&mdash;"then you come to me, in what at
  first I called&mdash;a dream."</p>

  <p>"Naia!" Croft stammered, lost in the glory of her. "Naia, what have you in
  your mind?"</p>

  <p>She came closer. "Am I not your mate, who am about to lose you? Yet were
  this power mine, perchance I, too, might visit you&mdash;in dreams."</p>

  <p>And now Croft saw her meaning, and like her quivered as once more he held
  her in his arms.</p>

  <p>Then came to Himyra light! Croft smiled in singular fashion on the day it
  came. Aphur's red city was in carnival attire. Its pavements swarmed with
  life. Open refreshment booths did a thriving business, jugglers plied their
  skill on woven mats stretched out in open squares. Jostling crowds swarmed
  about them, filling the air with jest and good-natured cries. The whole place
  hummed with a myriad life.</p>

  <p>And yet to Jason the whole scene was unreal&mdash;a mask, a carnival
  domino spread as it was above a grinning skull. To him driving in his motor
  with Naia in purple and gold, above which her snowy left shoulder and throat
  made a band of ivory, the whole vast assemblage seemed no more than the
  shifting fantasmagoria of a dream&mdash;a gorgeous play of color through the
  mind of a sleeper not as yet awake. For Himyra made merry in her ignorance of
  the catastrophe striking against the national borders to the east. Jadgor's
  messenger had not as yet arrived.</p>

  <p>And though Himyra dreamed a dream of splendor, in which none had a thought
  of care, though the crowds moved in indolent leisure through street and
  public square, though copper-bodied motors roared and panted over pavements
  laid in bitumen as smooth in their surface as a floor; though plumed gnuppas
  pranced with a clatter of slender feet, and bright-eyed, softly shrouded and
  perfumed women rode within them to the games of the afternoon&mdash;the
  beginning of the celebration of what all thought a new era in the life of
  Tamarizia and Aphur, still beneath the surface seeming, because of Croft's
  knowledge, and the words he had spoken to Robur, and Robur's orders, the
  inner soul of Himyra and all Aphur prepared on this day for war.</p>

  <p>In a way the aspect of the city reminded Jason of the condition of the
  woman at his side in those past days when the soul of her had been his as
  always, and only the objective mind had failed as yet to wake.</p>

  <p>Today she had come to the game with him alone at his own request. Outside
  the vast stadium where formerly all public games had been held&mdash;a huge
  thing of red stone, that always reminded Croft of the Coliseum of
  Rome&mdash;he helped her down. Through bowing crowds they gained the entrance
  giving on what had once been the royal box, now reserved for the governor of
  Aphur's suite. He led her in through a gilded and frescoed passage, and
  conducted her to where a scarlet canopy was spread above a tier of seats. She
  sank down, inclining her head in salutation to a hundred greetings from
  neighboring boxes, until the purple plume, rising from the cincture in her
  golden hair, was set a-nodding above her lovely face.</p>

  <p>Robur came with Gaya a few moments later. The vast assemblage rose and the
  games began. First was a chariot race, entered by six chariots drawn each by
  a team of four plumed gnuppas, driven at top speed. Marthos, a young noble,
  won handily, amid acclaim from the thousands ranged about the immense
  amphitheater, and was awarded a metal garland, standing flushed with triumph
  before Robur's box.</p>

  <p>Followed various athletic contests, javelin throwing, foot racing,
  shooting with bows and arrows at a herd of wild taburs driven into the arena
  from pens beneath the tiers of seats, wrestling matches and other sports, in
  which both men and women took part. In a way, as he sat at Naia's side, the
  scene reminded Croft of a reproduction of a public ceremonial of ancient
  Greece. For as in Greece and in Tamarizia, for generations untold, the
  contestants threw off all their clothing as they came to their stations and
  worked frankly nude until they had ended their exhibition of skill or
  strength, when once more their garments were donned.</p>

  <p>The minor events ended, there came a pause. Then from the far end of the
  arena suddenly there dashed a chariot drawn by four pure-white gnuppas,
  orange plumed. Straight for Robur's box they plunged and came to a rearing
  halt as Marthos, to whom had been awarded this' further honor, drew them to a
  stand.</p>

  <p>Croft rose. He descended from the box and entered the car. Clad in brown
  he was, in the suit Naia had designed and had made for him as once more the
  gnuppas traversed the arena's length and stopped near to where the men from
  the hangars had trundled the great plane into sight. In a leap he was aboard.
  The attendants ran to their places. Two men turned the engine over. It
  caught!</p>

  <p>Above the whispers of the multitude its roar rang out. The great plane
  trembled. Its attendants released it. It trundled forward over the hard
  packed floor of yellow sand. Straight as a die it surged toward Robur's box
  until suddenly Croft changed his vanes. And then it rose. It shot up at what
  looked like a forty-five degree slant. Up and up and up, until it swam above
  the vast concourse of back-tilted faces. Like the hum of a giant beetle, the
  sound of its whirring engine came down from a cloudless sky to a myriad ears.
  Once, twice, Croft made the circuit of the arena, and then began to settle,
  finishing with a graceful volplane, which left him within a few feet of his
  start.</p>

  <p>"Hai! Hai! Hail to the Mouthpiece of Zitu! Hail to Jason, teacher of all
  Tamarizia! Hail to him whose mind Zitu has enlightened above all others!" the
  cry of the multitude rang out. Croft once more in Marthos's chariot pushed
  back his leather helmet and bowed. Bowing to right and left, acclaimed as a
  conqueror might have been, he rode back toward Robur's box, and left the
  chariot and ascended to his seat, and looked into Naia's face, finding it
  somewhat white, but smiling, and bowing again before the tempest of
  acclamation began to subside.</p>

  <p>Then came the game of ball, on a diamond arena attendants were beginning
  already to mark out, between the men from the foundries and the team from the
  airplane shop. Robur himself rose and, taking a ball from an ornate box
  extended to him by a guardsman, cast it out. Then, as it was passed snappily
  to the pitcher of the foundry's team which had won the inning and elected to
  send the airplane aggregation to bat: "Play ball!" he cried.</p>

  <p>And suddenly as the first batter fanned and flung his bat away and walked
  to the bench, very much like any disgruntled batsman of earth, Croft smiled.
  It was unbelievable, of course. It was a fantasmagoria of the brain. The
  thing couldn't be, and yet&mdash;there was the pitcher of the founders, in a
  short-skirted tunic, below which his lean thighs showed above his leg-cases
  of leather, cradling the ball, and cuddling it in his palm. And there was the
  catcher, squatted down back of the plate in breast-plate and mask, twiddling
  the signaling fingers of a huge labor-browned hand,
  and&mdash;whir&mdash;snap! There was the ball thudding against his mitt.</p>

  <p>"Strike on-n-n-e!" That was the umpire's voice.</p>

  <p>Cr-a-a-a-a-a-c-k! That was the sound of a ball met fairly and lined
  swiftly out. And there it went, a clean drive between first and second base,
  into the right outfield.</p>

  <p>"Run, run&mdash;go on&mdash;go on!" That was Robur yelling in
  ungovernor-like excitement.</p>

  <p>"Run&mdash;go on&mdash;run&mdash;oh, run&mdash;run!" That was the voice of
  Naia&mdash;of the woman by his side.</p>

  <p>Croft turned to her and found her leaning forward, straining her slender
  length from the hips, lips parted, her eager blue eyes wide.</p>

  <p>"Hold it!" That was the airplane's captain coaching the runner.</p>

  <p>Thud! The right outfield had slammed the ball into the second baseman's
  glove.</p>

  <p>Croft smiled again. It couldn't be a baseball game on Palos, but&mdash;it
  was.</p>

  <p>And as it went on the assembled multitude went wild. They cheered, they
  jeered, they urged and encouraged, and cat-called and howled. They stamped on
  the tiers of seats with leather and bare and metal-shod feet. They waved
  hands and arms. State assemblymen already gathered by Robur's orders, and
  guests of the occasion forgot dignity and joined in the rising roars that
  greeted the different plays. And Naia of Aphur was beating against Croft's
  thigh and yelling&mdash;yes, yelling, as the founder's first baseman romped
  home on a far-reaching drive. "Come on&mdash;come on," she was urging the
  runner. "Come on&mdash;atta boy&mdash;come home!"</p>

  <p>Croft prisoned her beating little fist and held it. The runner scored. She
  looked into Jason's face and smiled. Croft thrilled. She was all
  woman&mdash;all glorious, lovely woman. He knew it, had seen it proved in the
  last week when she worked stern-lipped for the good of her nation. But today
  in this new-found pastime she had forgotten for the moment and become a
  child.</p>

  <p>The game ended for the Founders, three to one, bringing with its
  termination an intermission, since not until dusk would the lights be turned
  on.</p>

  <p>Blue men of Mazzer with torches began moving about the vast circuit of the
  arena, lighting hundreds of oil flares. Blue girls with skins of tabur hide
  on their naked backs and shoulders, and metal cups in their hands, began
  threading the tiers of seats selling a mild, light wine. Venders of fruits
  and conserves for the women, and baked meats and wheaten cakes plied an
  active trade. In the rear of Robur's box was spread a table, and a meal was
  served. And before its beginning Magur, high priest of Aphur, arrived. To him
  Croft and Naia rose side by side and bowed. And suddenly Naia was once more
  all woman, as she looked into her companion's face and flushed from throat to
  eyes. Magur's coming meant she was to pledge herself to Croft before all the
  assembled men and women of Aphur, once the new light came on.</p>

  <p>And in such fashion was it done. Two heralds with silver trumpets appeared
  in scarlet livery, the color of Robur's house. From the front of Robur's box
  they blew a blast.</p>

  <p>And on that signal the arena attendants began running to and fro
  extinguishing all lights. Over the arena night came down as one by one the
  oil flares died.</p>

  <p>Croft gave a final glance to the woman at his side&mdash;to her face, her
  form, to her dress of purple and gold. He had asked her to put it on. It was
  the garment she had worn on the first formal occasion in which he had ever
  seen her take part. And its colors were the same as the auric colors of that
  astral form of hers which he had seen and found divine. Taking her hand he
  led her quite to the front of the box. There on either side had been placed
  one of Tamarizia's first two arcs. And in the back of the box was the
  controlling switch. And miles away in the mountains men were waiting for the
  signal of a flare on Himyra's walls to release the power. Already one had
  gone to see that the flare was lit. And a captain was without to carry word
  when it shone forth.</p>

  <p>Now suddenly he appeared.</p>

  <p>Croft closed the switch.</p>

  <p>A click&mdash;a hiss&mdash;the crackling ignition of incandescent
  carbon&mdash;a rising glow in the darkness&mdash;then&mdash;light
&mdash;clear, radiant light!</p>

  <p>Light that flared up and wavered and steadied and shone on Naia of Aphur,
  sheathed in purple and gold.</p>

  <p>A babble of sound, a cheer of acclaim.</p>

  <p>The trumpets of the heralds rang out.</p>

  <p>Jason stepped forward and took his place close by Naia's side.</p>

  <p>Magur, the high priest, arose, robed in his vestments of azure,
  accompanied by two temple boys. Each bore a silver goblet on a tray of the
  same metal that sparkled under the light.</p>

  <p>Magur lifted a silver stave crowned with the cross ansata. "Who cries to
  Magur?" his voice rang out.</p>

  <p>"A maid who would pledge herself and her life to the man of her choosing,
  O Prince of Zitu," Robur replied.</p>

  <p>"The man is present?" Magur went on in ritualistic form.</p>

  <p>"Aye, he stands beside her," Robur declared.</p>

  <p>"Who sponsors this woman?" Magur inquired.</p>

  <p>"I, Robur of Aphur, her cousin&mdash;child of the sister of her who gave
  her life."</p>

  <p>"Come then in the name of Zitu," Magur said, and advanced to face the
  arena, back of Naia and Croft.</p>

  <p>"Naia of Aphur&mdash;thou woman, and being woman, sister of Ga, and hence
  priestess of that shrine of life which is eternal, the guardian of the fire
  of life which is eternal&mdash;is it thine intent to pledge thyself to this
  man, who stands now at thy side?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Naia of Aphur clearly, and looked not at Magur as she
  answered, but into Jason's eyes.</p>

  <p>"And thou, Jason, known as the Mouthpiece of Zitu, whom Zitu has inspired
  with his wisdom, even as no other man, do thou accept this pledge, and with
  it the woman herself, to make her in the fulness of time thy bride, to
  cherish her and cause her to live as a glory to the name of woman, to whom
  all men may justly give respect?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, so I pledge, by Zitu, and Azil, giver of life," said Jason, gazing
  on the woman as he spoke the words.</p>

  <p>"Then take this, maid of Aphur." Magur drew from his robe a looped silver
  cross and placed it in her hands. "Hold it and guard it, look upon it as a
  symbol of that life eternal that you shall be kept eternal, and which, taken
  from the hands of Azil the angel, shall be transmuted within thee into the
  life of men."</p>

  <p>Turning, he took the two goblets from their bearers and poured wine from
  one to the other and back. One he extended to Naia and one to Croft.</p>

  <p>"Drink," he said. "Let these symbolize thy two bodies, the life of which
  shall be united from this time in purpose. Drink and may Zitu bless thee in
  that union which comes into existence by his intent."</p>

  <p>Jason raised his goblet. "I drink of thee deeply," he spoke to the lovely
  chalice of mortal life standing there.</p>

  <p>Naia set her goblet to her lips. "And I of thee."</p>

  <p>Then, and then only, Croft took that medallion of silver ringed with red
  stones, which Zitra had burned against his breast. And lifting the golden
  girdle which cinctured Naia's body above the hips he pinned it once more upon
  it, so that it flashed like a scarlet eye, beneath the newborn light.</p>

  <p>Magur lifted his stave. "Azil's seal has he set upon her. Let it speak to
  all men's sight."</p>

  <p>"Hail! Hail! Mouthpiece of Zitu. Hail! Hail! Hail! Naia, maid of Aphur!"
  From the vast arena a roar of acknowledgment and approbation tore its way
  upward in the night.</p>

  <p>So as it seemed ended Himyra's greatest holiday; so for Croft and Naia
  began a new phase of life. Yet though she had never seemed nearer, dearer to
  him, the Mouthpiece of Zitu was vaguely disturbed as they rode back to the
  palace through the still pleasure-making crowds. Everything seemed very
  peaceful, very auspicious. But he could not rid his mind of the picture which
  had troubled him for a week&mdash;the picture of a burning village&mdash;of
  blue men leaping in savage exultation of a beaten army's rout.</p>

  <p>Hence it was with no pleasure that an hour after their return from the
  arena, while yet the city flared and rang with the carnival life of the
  people, a palace guard brought word to him from Robur, asking his presence at
  once.</p>

  <p>Nor when he had followed to the audience chamber of the palace was he
  surprised to meet a man with drawn face, and eyes a trifle haggard&mdash;a
  man wearing Bithur's green and silver circle, who rose now and saluted him
  with flat palm forward, and burst into hurried, excited speech.</p>

  <p>"Mouthpiece of Zitu, Bithur is sore assailed&mdash;her armies beaten, the
  aid Aphur sent her largely destroyed; wherefore in the name of Bithur and of
  Tamarizia, Jadgor, president of the nation, now at Atla, sends me to you and
  to Robur of Aphur, his son, to speak what is in his heart. "</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; THE MAN OF THE HOUR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JASON went to Bithur. Naia remained behind. In the week
  before the celebration of their former betrothal they had so planned. Now,
  with the red and silver seal of Azil once more glowing in her girdle, Naia
  did not object. She was a woman. Croft knew she suffered. It was in her eyes,
  the touch of her hand. But&mdash;as he had seen her prove once
  before&mdash;she was a Tamarizian first.</p>

  <p>In the night Jadgor's messenger arrived, the assembly of Aphur was called
  together. To it the Bithurian explained. Faces darkened and eyes flashed as
  the startled statesmen learned that once more the integrity of the nation was
  threatened. But, as a man, in firm determination they empowered Robur and
  Croft to respond to Jadgor's plea, and accepted the challenge to war.</p>

  <p>At daylight, with the airplane he had flown from the first and a supply of
  grenades and fuel, together with the additional armored motors aboard a swift
  galley, Jason left for Bithur and the battle-front, taking Jadgor's messenger
  along. With him also he took a supply of dry cells to insure the better
  performance of the motors already on the ground.</p>

  <p>To Naia and Robur and the trained captains he left all the rest&mdash;the
  assembling of troops, the lading of galleys with all sorts of supplies, the
  forwarding of other completed airplanes with the men he started to train in
  their use, whose training Naia of Aphur declared she would complete.</p>

  <p>Only at the last did he hold her in his arms and lower his lips to the low
  burning flame of her mouth. For Naia of Aphur's lips were pale as they lifted
  to his farewell caress, and her slender body quivered inside his arms and her
  purple eyes were dark with her soul's distress.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, clinging to him briefly, "you will come to me again.
  Swear it to me by Azil, whose sign you have placed upon me&mdash;swear!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, by Zitu and Azil, I will return to you, woman of all women," Croft
  declared, as he held her and once more pressed her lips.</p>

  <p>Then gripping the hands of Gaya and Robur, he left the palace, and Naia
  herself drove him down to the quays. Seven days later he entered Bithra,</p>

  <p>the capital of Bithur, and left it inside an hour, heading east along the
  Bith between banks where a tropic vegetation came down to the water's edge,
  and the mighty flood of waters swept in a turgid current between banks of
  trees.</p>

  <p>Morning brought him close to Atla, as the pilot taken on at Bithra
  declared. Also it brought attack of a sort. From the banks as they advanced
  the galley was suddenly greeted by a flight of slithering shafts. Most of
  them, thanks to the range, fell into the water, but one or two reached the
  deck. Croft lined a company of riflemen he had hastily mobilized and brought
  with him on either side of the galley replied with a crashing volley as the
  galley advanced. So after that, meeting flights of arrows with bullets, he
  progressed, reaching a bend from which the gates in the city wall spanned the
  river's flood and flinging the flag of Aphur into view before the sentries on
  the walls.</p>

  <p>The gates swung open. The galley ran through. The gates were closed again.
  The galley tied to a quay below the brown palace Croft had visited in his
  astral presence; he marched off with his men. A procession was debouching
  from the palace gate. It came toward him quickly. He recognized Jadgor and
  Medai in the van. He halted his company and waited. The others came on. Five
  paces before him they halted.</p>

  <p>"Hai! Mouthpiece of Zitu," Jadgor spoke in greeting. "Thy coming is
  welcome. What word from Aphur and my son?"</p>

  <p>"Aphur sends men and weapons to Bithur," Jason responded. "As for Robur,
  son of Jadgor, he remains in Himyra to speed the departure for Bithur of all
  that may be required."</p>

  <p>"It is well." said Jadgor. "Return with us to the palace where all things
  may be explained. Medai of Bithur greets you in Bithur's name."</p>

  <p>Medai bowed deeply. The guards behind him and Jadgor turned. Followed by
  Croft's company they Retraced their steps until the palace was gained.</p>

  <p>And there in the room, Croft, Medai and Jadgor sat down. The latter eyed
  his former adviser and friend. "You are looking wondrous well," he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Croft nodded. "In all things have my efforts by success been
  crowned." "In all things?" Jadgor gave him a piercing glance.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Croft again inclined his head. "Thanks largely to Robur, Jadgor's
  son. But more of that later, Jadgor. Inform me how matters stand."</p>

  <p>Jadgor shrugged. "It would appear to go not so well with the things in my
  hands as with your plans. From the first was the extent of this matter with
  Mazzer misjudged; and in addition there is a fault in these moturs of yours,
  when not controlled by the builder's mind. Wherefore they failed when most
  needed at times, and were by sheer force of numbers overborne. As a result
  the blue flood of Mazzer laps even now against Atla's walls on all
  sides."</p>

  <p>"Yet breaks against them," said Jason. "Aye as yet," Jadgor replied.</p>

  <p>"And shall break utterly," Croft went on. "Of this defect in the moturs
  already I had learned, in the same way in which I have learned other things
  in the past, as Jadgor knows. Wherefore his messenger came not to Himyra as a
  surprise, and for seven suns before his coming, Robur, Jadgor's son and I
  prepared." He broke off and watched the Aphurian closely.</p>

  <p>But Jadgor merely nodded as he responded. "Say on."</p>

  <p>"Among those things which have been completed since my return to Himyra,"
  Croft resumed, "is one which flies in the air. Riding upon it a man may cast
  down such bombs as were used at the taking of Niera in the Zollarian war."
  And now Jadgor started and narrowed his eyes, and Medai half rising from his
  seat exclaimed: "Zitu! Is this the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Croft. "One came aboard the galley. Between decks are the
  bombs. To-day shall it be set up and tomorrow shall these blue men meet with
  a surprise. Also have I brought devices to make the performance of the moturs
  more assured. From the ground and from the air shall we smite the Mazzerians
  at once."</p>

  <p>"Hal!" Media roared. "Jadgor&mdash;to fly above them and rain death on
  their heads. Never was such a thing heard of. You believe?"</p>

  <p>"Aye." Jadgor of Tamarizia rose. "Zitu's Mouthpiece is a man who speaks
  not in idle fashion, O Medai. He speaks true words. One does well to give
  credence to his speaking." His hand snapped back and drew his short sword
  from its scabbard. He presented it hilt forward. "Man whom Zitu has sent to
  Tamarizia's strengthening, to thee I yield."</p>

  <p>"No." Croft waved the sword aside. He looked into Jadgor's face and found
  it working. "Mouthpiece of Zitu have I been called, in that at times I have
  been given the power to direct or to advise. In Jadgor's heart and mine must
  Tahiaxizia find first place always. Let Jadgor wear the sword."</p>

  <p>And suddenly Jadgor's lips set together. He sent the blade back into the
  sheath with a rasping clash. "You and I together for Tamarizia then," he said
  with abrupt decision, and thrust out his palm. "Accept Jadgor's hand at
  least." The two men gripped and the Aphurian resumed: "Speak, Mouthpiece of
  Zitu, what do you advise?"</p>

  <p>"What men have you at your disposal?" Jadgor and Medai explained, and
  Croft decided upon a tour of the walls. The trio set forth. And as they went
  Jadgor explained further that three times within the past ten days had the
  Mazzerians attacked them.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Croft gained evidence of that when the top of the wall was
  reached. It came to him first as an almost insufferable stench. Jadgor noted
  the twitching of his nostrils and burst into a savage exultation.</p>

  <p>"Aye, by Zitu! they stink to the skies, these dead litter of an unclean
  birth. The trenches about Atla's defenses are filled with their corpses. They
  lie in heaps. They carpet the ground with a blue carpet, even more foul in
  death than in their life. By the thousands have we slain them, yet by the
  tens of thousands have their following spawn arrived. Their souls have we
  hurled to Zitemku and their bodies to the ditch." He swept his arm toward the
  outer parapet in a wide arc. "Behold!"</p>

  <p>Croft looked out at an embrasure and down. An arrow rattled against the
  stones beside him, and he drew back. But the one glance had been enough. This
  was grim reality he faced. In heaps and rows the rotting bodies of uncounted
  dead lay jumbled in dissolution beyond Atla's walls. He began to think it
  would be no mean undertaking to defeat the men of an army who fought like
  that.</p>

  <p>"Back!" he said. "Back to my galley, Jadgor! Let us put together the
  flying device I have brought. Tomorrow I swear we shall give them new death
  from the skies."</p>

  <p>And for the rest of that day Croft sweated and worked, assembling the
  airplane on Atla's broadest street, which, like Himyra's, faced the
  river&mdash;a splendid concourse, above a terrace, offering him a spot for
  starting, two hundred feet in width. What of the armored motors remained he
  had also driven up, and under their metal bodies he installed his batteries,
  wiring them to the ignition system&mdash;explaining to their drivers, how,
  should the former supply of power be thrown out of service, this auxiliary
  source might be employed.</p>

  <p>Toward evening, however, he altered his plans. To his mind it appeared
  that the more unseen the destruction which came upon them, the greater on
  superstitious minds the effect might be. And as he knew even from his
  association with the Mazzerian serving-caste in the nation he had literally
  adopted, the Mazzerians were superstitious to a degree.</p>

  <p>About twilight he loaded the plane with a good supply of bombs. Ascending
  from the broad thoroughfare, and returning to it, outlined as it would be by
  the fire-urns, which, as at Himyra, marked the banks of the Bith along the
  quays, would be no more than child's play. As a result, he decided to make
  his first bombing expedition beyond the walls so soon as night came down,
  carry what consternation he could to the Mazzerian forces. This decision he
  definitely reached after a conference with Jadgor, who announced that for a
  great distance before the walls the Mazzerian camps were nightly marked by
  the flares of many fires.</p>

  <p>Jadgor, Medai, the major captains of their armies, and many of the
  citizens of Atla stood to witness Croft's start. Wearing his flying-suit
  which he had brought for the purpose, Jason climbed aboard. Then at his
  instruction two frightened-looking soldiers seized the blades of the
  propeller and turned the engine round. They let go and scampered well out of
  the way as it roared. The plane quivered, moved. It darted forward along the
  perfect pavement, tilted and took the air. In a moment it soared high above
  the walls. Croft shouted once and then forgot all else in the sight beneath
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>As far as he could see before him, and to either side, the night was
  dotted with fires. In a wide semicircle they blinked and winked and flared.
  They outlined the main position of the Mazzerian army. His heart leaped into
  his breast, as a rising stench told him he was passing those rotting bodies
  stretched out among a mass of broken weapons at the foot of Atla's walls.</p>

  <p>Then the walls were passed, and with the breath of a clean night in his
  nostrils, the roar of the engine in his ears, he swept toward the line of
  fires.</p>

  <p>Far, far out he swung. It was his intention to circuit the back areas of
  the Mazzerian line&mdash;to come upon them not from in front, but from the
  rear&mdash;to make his coming appear that of some huge, undreamed monster of
  superstitious seeming, to traverse their main body from one end to the other,
  dropping bombs which, under the conditions, he felt could hardly fail of a
  telling effect.</p>

  <p>Far, far out he swam on the new wings he had built for himself&mdash;and
  for Naia. Naia? He smiled. In Himyra she was perhaps flying by day even as he
  was flying now&mdash;flying as he had taught her to fly in body and soul;
  teaching others to fly for the strength of her nation, as he was flying for
  her nation and his, to make it strong and secure. For a moment the thought
  gripped him, and he flew on in a sort of waking dream, until the flare of a
  hundred leaping fires directly beneath him brought him back to the matter in
  hand. He passed the first line of the Mazzerian bivouac and darted above a
  wood and came above a great savanna&mdash;a tree-dotted plain, where the
  camp-fires were flashing again.</p>

  <p>Then, and then only, for the first time he reached down and took up a
  bomb, and sailing high above that plain where the camp-fires looked like a
  myriad of fireflies far beneath him, he let it fall.</p>

  <p>A flash, a ruddy, great mushroom of golden, raying light&mdash;a splash of
  rending destruction in the night. The explosion came up to him long after he
  saw it, on the lagging vibrations of sound. Again and again he hurled a
  second and third as he swam from left to right.</p>

  <p>Faint, far away, oddly detached, he thought he heard a distant shouting,
  though it was hard to be sure above the motor's roar. But the light of other
  fires showed him the silhouette of many figures running, of arms uplifted, as
  though those who swarmed like a hill of angry ants driven into panic were
  pointing into the air. Where that cluster of pointing forms seemed thickest
  he soared on swift, sure wings and let go another bomb. It fell beyond his
  vision. It burst. The blur of bodies into which it descended was no more.</p>

  <p>And now a strange mood seized Croft in its grip. It was unlike anything he
  had ever known. It was in reality a sort of air intoxication one may suppose.
  But suddenly it was as though he were a superman indeed, above all things
  mundane, so far above the puny mortals who crawled on the ground beneath him,
  who writhed under the force of his bombs, that he moved in a world detached
  from them, or any one, or anything save himself.</p>

  <p>It was as though he rode on destiny's wings rather than upborne by those
  of the roaring airplane. He tilted his vanes from no sane purpose, with
  nothing to gain. Up, up he shot; up, up, until he could see the whole
  night-wrapped region about him, the forest, the fire-studded camp of Mazzer's
  army&mdash;Atla, a ruddy glow behind her walls, where shortly he must
  return.</p>

  <p>But not yet&mdash;not yet. For a time it was enough to chase this new
  found exultation, to swim here in the void between earth and heaven, alone
  with the thing he had made, on which he rode; alone with it, with his spirit,
  and his thoughts of Naia of Aphur, of the time when these blue spawn, driven
  back to their lairs in the hinterland of Palos, he should return to claim
  her. It was enough to ride thus the winds of eternity, as it were, sweeping
  on and on in the wheel of a mighty circle beneath the stars.</p>

  <p>A sputter, a cough from the motor. Croft came back from his dreams to the
  present in a flash. The engine was missing. Apprehension touched him with a
  breath-arresting recognition of the fact. And hardly had he taken it into
  account when the motor missed again. And having coughed for the second time,
  it died.</p>

  <p>He was falling&mdash;falling! The bombs! Oddly enough he thought of them
  rather than of being dashed to death. He reached down and found the remaining
  four he had brought. He hurled them over the side of the fuselage, tossing
  them wide. Then he began a frantic effort to once more start the
  engine&mdash;in vain.</p>

  <p>Below him four ruddy flashes told him the bombs had struck. In a rushing
  whirlwind the air of night was driving past the plane. Doomed as it seemed,
  still the will to live, to struggle, to overcome danger and death itself
  remained within him. He began an effort to straighten out the dead plane's
  course, to catch and use to his own advantage that wind that was whistling
  past Kim now. To catch it, to ride once more upon it, if only as a kite may
  sink back to the earth, and so alight, little damaged rather than broken,
  splintered by a giddy fall.</p>

  <p>So in the end he did straighten out at last and slid swiftly, where before
  he had eddied and whirled.</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" he breathed a prayer of thanksgiving. "God!" For an instant the
  face of Naia swam before his mental vision, so clear, so bright, so seemingly
  herself, that it was almost as though he beheld her in the flesh.</p>

  <p>Then&mdash;the fire-dotted plain was very close. And the airplane was
  shooting down toward it, even though no longer falling, and there was little
  chance to choose a course. With a crash the pontoons beneath it struck
  through the top of a tree, and the whole machine swerved. In mid air it
  staggered, checked, lunged ahead again like a restive living creature,
  tipped, slid off sidewise, and crashed down on a crumpling wing.</p>

  <p>Unable to maintain himself in his shaken condition, Croft gave vent to an
  inarticulate cry of anguish. The entire bulk of Palos seemed to rise and hit
  him, as catapulted from the fuselage by the ruinous landing, he struck and
  lay in a dark and senseless huddle on the ground.</p><a id="pic6"

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">XIX. &mdash; A TAWNY VAMPIRE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HOURS afterward, as it seemed, Croft opened his eyes, and
  blinked at a flare of light and closed his lids again, while he sought to
  collect his shaken senses.</p>

  <p>He remembered by degrees.</p>

  <p>The plane had fallen. There was nothing after that. But he had fallen upon
  a night-wrapped plain, studded with the fires of a camp. Now, instead of
  stars above him, there was what looked like the bellied top of a tent. Slowly
  he spread the fringes of his lashes and sought to verify the impression he
  had gained.</p>

  <p>He was correct. He lay in a tent, seemingly of skins joined to form the
  sloping top and walls. The interior was lighted dimly by a couple of flaring
  torches. But the-light was sufficient to show Croft piles of military gear,
  rugs of native skin, on one of the latter of which he seemed to be lying, and
  some crude stools scattered about.</p>

  <p>He lay with head half turned as he had been thrown down, and now he became
  aware of other life in the tent as his senses more fully returned. There was
  a sound of voices. He opened his eyes widely and stared about. And inwardly
  at least he gasped.</p>

  <p>This was-the headquarters of the army he had sought to bomb, past any
  doubt. Blue men&mdash;a dozen, a score were clustered about a huge chair to
  one side, in which another blue man sat. And yet&mdash;in the latter Croft
  detected something familiar in a flash, and immediately after he understood.
  He had heard it alleged that certain Zollarian captains had stained their
  bodies and shaved their heads and dyed the remaining scalp lock of their
  light hair to match the Mazzerian red.</p>

  <p>And&mdash;and&mdash;this was Bandhor of Zollaria&mdash;brother of
  Kalamita&mdash;that tawny female magnet with which the northern nation had
  sought to bind the profligate Prince of Cathur to her cause. This was
  Bandhor, his massive body stained blue in its every ungainly line, seated
  upon this chair before which the other blue men stood. And inspecting the
  latter more closely, marking their features well in the murky light, Croft
  decided that most of them were men of Zollaria tinted and shaved and dyed
  like Bandhor himself.</p>

  <p>Here then was proof of Zollaria's hand in the Mazzerian invasion, proof
  that Croft lay in the spot which was the brain center of the Mazzerian army
  in the field. Croft's head was splitting, but he sought to focus his
  attention on what was being said.</p>

  <p>"Sayest thou that this man fell out of the skies?" Bandhor roared, turning
  his eyes toward where Croft lay on the farther side of the tent.</p>

  <p>"Aye," said one of the captains, whom Jason felt positive was a Zollarian
  for all his naked blue length. "Aye, Bandhor, he fell from a device like to a
  pair of wings. Before that had strange weapons fallen upon my men from the
  skies in a rain of death. Then suddenly came this man."</p>

  <p>"Tamarizian devil," Bandhor swore with savage force. "This newest method
  of their fighting would seem to be like their last, when they struck
  Zollaria's army with a blast of fire. Go see if still he breathes."</p>

  <p>Two of the men turned and approached Croft. They bent above him. He stared
  straight into their faces.</p>

  <p>"Aye, Bandhor of Zollaria," reported one. "He has opened his eyes."</p>

  <p>"Bring him here."</p>

  <p>Croft rose. Without waiting the touch of a captor's hand he staggered up
  and faced Bandhor's chair. "Stand back," he hissed to men beside him. "I
  would walk alone." He took a step forward, swaying; whereupon the others
  seized him and hurried him to Bandhor's place.</p>

  <p>"Spawn of Tamarizia," Bandhor began, "what is thy name?"</p>

  <p>"Thou hast said it, Bandhor," Croft retorted, determined to give no
  information.</p>

  <p>"Came you from Atla?" Bandhor roared.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"How many men inside her walls can Jadgor and Medai claim?"</p>

  <p>"Enough," said Croft. "Enough blue-dyed men of Zollaria to pile other
  thousands of your naked dupes before them. There are not men enough in all
  Mazzer to scale at Zollaria's command Atla of Bithur's walls."</p>

  <p>"Hai! By Bel of Zollaria thy fall has not broken thy tongue at least!"
  Bandhor exclaimed. "But thy man-made wings are broken, and thy insolent
  spirit may be broken also. Hai&mdash;bring a brazier and a spear head. Since
  this Tamarizian fights with fire we shall give him a taste of it himself, and
  learn perchance what within Atla transpires."</p>

  <p>"Hold!" Suddenly the wall of the tent behind Bandhor's chair swept back,
  revealing a small private tent beyond it, and a tawny woman appeared.</p>

  <p>White she was in the murky light as a ray of moonlight in the
  dusk&mdash;white, and splendidly formed in every supple line of sensuous body
  and limb. Jeweled cups covered her breasts, and a scarf of shimmering tissue
  was twisted about her sinuous loins and fell half down her thighs. With the
  grace of a stalking panther she advanced, accompanied by another blue-stained
  Zollarian captain, and took her stand beside her brother. In the flare of the
  torches she gleamed among those blue-tinted bodies like a silver
  wand.</p><a id="pic7"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Bethink you my brother," she continued as Croft recognized in her that
  Kalamita, that feminine magnet of flesh, who had tempted Cathur's Prince
  Kyphallos through the spell of her unclean charms, her unhallowed embrace,
  "would destroy or even mar the weapon in your hand?" "Hai, by Bel," began
  Bandhor.</p>

  <p>"Aye," his sister went on. "Where are Bandhor's eyes? Call on Bel and you
  will, yet have you not sacrificed to him enough of blood to glut his heart,
  without adding this? See you not this is a man of importance&mdash;and one to
  me before this described? Mark you not the closeness of the hair upon his
  head, his stature? Know you not that before you stands the Mouthpiece of Zitu
  of whom Tamarizia boasts&mdash;him to whom Zollaria must mark the score of
  her defeat, her loss of Mazhur? Rather than for gaining information can
  Bandhor not think of a better way in which such a one may be used?"</p>

  <p>"Hai&mdash;you mean a ransom, Kalamita my sister?" Bandhor burst out as
  she paused.</p>

  <p>"Aye." The eyes of a tigress looked into Croft's as she answered, studied
  his every expression, marked the effects of her words. "Aye, Bandhor, and you
  and other captains&mdash;and the ransom&mdash;should be&mdash;large. Much
  should Tamarizia be asked in payment for her Mouthpiece of Zitu, who tumbles
  from the skies."</p>

  <p>And suddenly she smiled as she broke off her flippant taunt&mdash;smiled
  and looked steadily into Croft's staring eyes.</p>

  <p>"By Bel!" once more Bandhor roared. "The words of Kalamita are of wisdom.
  Go&mdash;Mamai. Take portions of the device from which he fell. See they are
  carried to Atla. Say that this man fell among us with them. Demand a parley,
  at which terms for his return shall be named." "Aye, Bandhor!" One of the
  captains saluted and left the tent.</p>

  <p>Inwardly Croft writhed. Here was a pretty pickle, indeed, since by his own
  blunder he had become to Tamarizia a weakness rather than a
  strength&mdash;since because of it, Tamarizia would seem to be confronted
  with the choice of leaving him to fate or paying Mazzer's and laria's price.
  And&mdash;he had caught all the meaning in the tawny depths of the Zollarian
  courtesan's eyes. That price would indeed be large.</p>

  <p>And now she bent and whispered into Bandhor's ear and he nodded. "Bind
  him," he said, and pointed to Croft. "Lift him and bear him into my sister's
  tent. Place a guard about us when it is finished. That is all, my captains.
  We wait for word from Atla. Go!"</p>

  <p>To resist were useless. Croft did not try. He stood passively while his
  hands and feet were trussed. Even then he was trying to think, to scheme some
  way out of the mess into which he had brought himself. And&mdash;a vague
  question roused as to Kalamita's object in having him carried into her own
  tent. Object he was sure there was, but it baffled him for the moment. Then
  he was lifted and borne beyond the flapping door through which she had
  entered, and laid on a pallet of skins beside a copper couch.</p>

  <p>The woman followed, remained standing until his bearers had left, then
  approached and reclined on the couch from whence she could watch his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Mouthpiece of Zitu," she began after a moment of contemplation,
  "Mouthpiece of Zitu, who tumbles from the skies." Croft made no answer, and
  suddenly she left the couch and knelt beside him. "You are a handsome man,
  Mouthpiece of Zitu; am I not beautiful myself?" "Yes," said Croft, since in a
  purely physical way she was no less than a creature to drive most men mad,
  and he knew that she knew it, and because of the knowledge, left none of her
  charms concealed.</p>

  <p>"And"&mdash;she bent above him, closer, closer, until her reddened mouth
  seemed about to touch him, until her breath played softly against his
  cheek&mdash;"wisdom and beauty may accomplish much together, Mouthpiece of
  Zitu, think you not?"</p>

  <p>So that was it&mdash;wisdom and beauty together. A sudden
  loathing&mdash;an impulse to put more space between that gleaming body, that
  blood-red mouth so very close above him, gripped Croft and shook him. But he
  kept it out of his voice and out of his eyes as he replied. "What mean you,
  Kalamita of Zollaria, you magnet of the flesh?"</p>

  <p>She laughed&mdash;laughed with a note of exultation in the sound as though
  his words were a tribute to the power she knew was her own. "Why think you
  Kalamita saved you from the fire?" Croft quibbled. "Said she not the reason
  in words?"</p>

  <p>The woman frowned. "Think you Jadgor of Tamarizia will pay the price for
  you that Mazzer will ask?"</p>

  <p>Croft knew that his heart leaped. He had been
  afraid&mdash;afraid&mdash;yet now he recalled Jadgor as he knew
  him&mdash;Jadgor who had bowed his haughty crest on the day just passed for
  Tamarizia, but never for himself. Turning the thought in his brain he forgot
  to answer.</p>

  <p>"You know he will not." Almost Kalamita hissed. "And if not, is death
  preferable to life, power&mdash;love? Would prefer to lie in the ground, wise
  man of Tamarizia, or in Kalamita's arms? Wouldst prefer to give of your
  strength to Zollaria and her, or to the worms?"</p>

  <p>More and more Croft sickened at her words. For this he had been brought
  into her private tent. There alone with this shameless woman he was to be
  intrigued, turned traitor, in spirit and body seduced. Almost instinctively
  he turned away his eyes. Her beauty had become a deadly menace&mdash;the
  perfume of her tinted flesh had become a stench. To him she was offering what
  to Cathur's prince had been given, which had made of the man's name a synonym
  for treason in his nation. And now once more she was speaking.</p>

  <p>"Behold, we are alone. I can unbind you, and&mdash;Kalamita's couch
  is&mdash;wide."</p>

  <p>"Aye, too wide, by Zitu!" suddenly Croft roared. "The needle was too
  patent in its making to have foreseen the fact that width would be required.
  Sister of Bandhor, beautiful as the dream of a soul in the realms of Zitemku
  you may be, but&mdash;Jason of Tamarizia barters not the welfare of his
  nation for a moment's lust."</p>

  <p>"So!" Kalamita rose and stood above him. Cruel was her red lips' smile,
  and cruel was the light that flashed from her oval, tawny eyes. "So, then, we
  know your name at last. Hark ye, Jason&mdash;for Kalamita's favor prouder
  heads than thine have bended down in the dust. Nor is her favor a thing to be
  lightly brushed aside. Wherefore and Jadgor pays not the price we ask, then
  the Mouthpiece of Zitu dies."</p>

  <p>A space of time dragged past and Croft had not replied.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Kalamita was again beside him. "Or, perhaps," she said in a
  softer fashion, "it is because of that maid of Aphur, of whom one has told
  me&mdash;that Jason turns aside. If so, forget her&mdash;and remember only
  that Kalamita also is a woman."</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;by Zitu, and Azil and Ga, for your beauty-blinded eyes. The
  beasts of the forest shall tear thy entrails from thee for thy words to me."
  She turned and went swiftly toward the flaplike door and flung it open.
  "Bandhor, O Bandhor!" she cried.</p>

  <p>Her blue-stained brother appeared. They conferred together. Bandhor turned
  away.</p>

  <p>But only for a moment longer were Croft and the woman alone. Then came
  Mazzerian soldiers, and lifting the trussed figure, bore it swiftly into the
  night through Bandhor's tent and to another, smaller, unlighted as to its
  interior, with naught for a floor save the grass-grown ground. And there they
  flung him down.</p>

  <p>But Jason smiled. That quiet dark, the sweet, pure kiss of the grass
  beneath him was better than the atmosphere he had left. He stretched out his
  limbs so far as his bonds would let him and breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>And after a long time, as it seemed to his troubled senses, all his
  planning focused on Zud and Naia&mdash;dwindled down to those two words.
  Lying here, bound, practically doomed to die, he could yet communicate with
  them in the astral state. To Zud, whom he had taught to recognize his coming,
  he could go then, and even though thereby he made his own death practically
  certain, he would still serve best the Tamarizian states. And Naia&mdash;he
  quivered at the thought. Naia&mdash;as he knew her, would like himself,
  consider him unworthy if he did less than that Therefore he took a deep
  breath; he would go to Zud.</p>

  <p>And swiftly as the thing was always accomplished when he so desired it, he
  was bending over the high priest's body, asleep in the Zitran pyramid.</p>

  <p>"Zud," his spirit was calling. "The Mouthpiece of Zitu commands you. Come
  forth."</p>

  <p>And Zud appeared. "Aye, Jason of Zitu," he quavered. "Zud is here."</p>

  <p>"Listen ye, Priest of Zitu," Croft replied, and told him what had
  occurred. "Wherefore give ear further to my words. Go to Lakkon, and bid him,
  in Zitu's name, to send to Jadgor at Atla, advising him to hold out and seek
  for delay until the aid from Himyra arrives. Let it be said to him that
  Zollaria inspires all things which Mazzer requires. Let him know that through
  the power of the spirit which is mine, I shall inspire Naia of Aphur to cause
  Robur, his son, to come swiftly to Atla in person, to direct the use of the
  weapons that together with myself he understands, and that through you and
  Naia of Aphur, I shall keep him informed of all that transpires while yet my
  body survives."</p>

  <p>"And thou&mdash;thou?" Zud faltered in distraught fashion, clasping his
  shadowy hands.</p>

  <p>"I? I know not," said Jason. "My fortune is in Zitu's hands. To you I give
  this mission. Say that you understand."</p>

  <p>"Zud hears, and Zud obeys."</p>

  <p>Croft left him. His work was finished. He sought Himyra and Robur's
  palace, and Naia&mdash;his other self. And this part of his plan he felt
  would be the hardest, since in order to make her comprehend fully he must
  tell a painful truth&mdash;must confess that through his own daring was Jason
  at last undone&mdash;that his body lay prisoner to Mazzer, condemned if what
  he meant to attempt were accomplished, to what seemed inevitable death.</p>

  <p>And suddenly, as he gained her chamber, Croft had the odd sensation that
  he stood before a tomb. Why it was he did not know at the moment, but it was
  as though he faced a ravished or an empty shrine. So strongly had he willed
  himself to this spot that the very concentration of his purpose had blotted
  out all else, and only now, when he reached it, did there come upon him the
  feeling that his coming here was vain.</p>

  <p>Yet he crept inside. He moved swiftly toward her couch. In the dusk her
  form lay stretched upon it. But&mdash;it was motionless, with no stirring of
  the coverlet stretched above it, no evidence of breath. Pale as a lovely
  image it lay before him, in the semblance of what might be death.</p>

  <p>Fear&mdash;sheer, stark fear gripped Croft and held him through the span
  of a startled instant. And then he knew the truth. Because as he stood there
  it seemed to him that Naia of Aphur was calling&mdash;not from the form on
  the couch, but from somewhere else. "Jason&mdash;Jason&mdash;O Jason, my
  beloved!" that subtle cry rang out.</p>

  <p>And it drew him. It compelled him. It was the voice of love&mdash;the
  voice of the affinity of the ages, soundless, as the spinning of the planets
  down the grooveless tracks of time&mdash;a blind thing, a mad thing, beyond
  all thinking in its sweetness&mdash;the voice of atom to atom&mdash;of the
  soft wind to the pollen&mdash;the voice of the bird to its mate&mdash;of the
  maiden to her lover&mdash;the ceaseless song of creation&mdash;the voice of
  God to man.</p>

  <p>"Jason&mdash;O my beloved!"</p>

  <p>It filled Croft's being. It engulfed him. It caught him up and carried him
  he cared not whither on the tide of a swift irresistible flood. It made of
  his astral substance no more than a straw swept up and off and about in an
  eddy of compelling force. It was more like that ceaseless urge which had
  drawn him from the Dog Star always while yet he dwelt on earth.</p>

  <p>It carried Croft out of the palace and across the Central Sea. It swept
  him across Bithur, with its plains and night-wrapped woods. It drew him above
  the camp of the Mazzerian army, and inside that tent where his body lay
  stretched out upon the ground.</p>

  <p>And then Croft understood&mdash;that Naia had accomplished for herself,
  what heretofore had been by him induced&mdash;that her spirit's
  love&mdash;her desire for knowledge, had enabled her soul to break the body's
  bonds. That as she suggested she might, in a former conversation, she had
  found the way to visit him in dreams.</p>

  <p>Yes, Croft knew all this in a blinding flash of comprehension.
  Because&mdash;there in the little tent, its auric fires paling and glowing,
  its soft arms twined about his unconscious body, lay Naia's astral form.</p>

  <p>She had come to find him. Suddenly it seemed to Croft that he might have
  known. And all at once he was glad, with a great unreasoning gladness that
  when she came, she had found him here alone, like this rather than in
  Kalamita's tent.</p>

  <p>Then very softly, "Beloved," he let steal forth the soul call.</p>

  <p>She heard. She lifted her head from where it had lain upon his breast. She
  turned its wide eyes toward him, and saw him and rose swiftly toward him, and
  into his embrace.</p>

  <p>"Jason&mdash;I came to Atla, and could not find you. And I sought
  you&mdash;sought you. What is the meaning of this?"</p>

  <p>"The plane fell. I told you always there was danger," he explained
  briefly. "I was taken prisoner by the Zollarian masters of the men of Mazzer.
  I am held to ransom for a price."</p>

  <p>"Zitu!" Naia panted. "And what else?" "I went in the spirit to converse
  with Zud, and send him on a mission to thy father," Jason told her, loath to
  answer her questions with a mere avowal of the numbing truth&mdash;that truth
  which as it seemed must blast their own hopes for the future, unless in some
  blind way he could contrive escape. "Through him I shall send word to Jadgor
  that the price must be refused."</p>

  <p>"Refused?" Naia drew back slightly. Those quivering fires of her life
  force faltered, grew dim and uncertain, died down like a flame well nigh
  blown out by a deadening wind of fear. "But Jason&mdash;thy body&mdash;which
  I found lying&mdash;here?" "Belongs to thee, while yet it survives," Croft
  answered slowly, and went on before she could find a reply. "Then went I to
  Himyra, and finding your form stretched on its couch, seemed to hear you
  calling, and returned to find you here. Listen, Naia, my beloved, you must
  find Robur and speak to him for me. To Jadgor you must send him, explaining
  what has befallen, telling him from me as the one Lakkon sent will tell him,
  that when Robur shall arrive to take charge of the motor's and the riflemen
  of Aphur, they must strike, strike, strike until Bithur shall be freed. Also
  to Robur you must say he shall call on Nodhur and Milidhur to arm so quickly
  as they may, and send their men to reinforce and support Aphur. So shall
  Tamarizia vanquish Mazzer and once more defeat those things Zollaria
  plans."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;you ask me&mdash;to do this?" Naia faltered.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;for Tamarizia I ask it," Croft replied.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;you&mdash;you?" She glanced toward the tight-bound body.</p>

  <p>Croft sought to stay her questions. "Look not there, beloved. I am here."
  "But&mdash;unless this price of Mazzer you mentioned&mdash;be paid?" She
  would not be refused.</p>

  <p>Croft drew her to him. His position was perhaps rather more peculiar than
  that of any living man. The answer to what she had asked was death, and he
  knew it. Once he had snapped the astral cord that bound him to a body, but
  only after control of another had been gained. And that second body, the one
  he had made his own on Palos when he forsook earth because of the woman whose
  vital substance now glowed and paled against him, was the one which lay bound
  beside them on the ground. There was no other&mdash;the loss of it meant to
  him what the loss of physical life must mean to all men&mdash;nothing else.
  "If the price is not paid, it is easy enough to snap the cord that binds my
  life within it, at the proper time," he said at length.</p>

  <p>"And," said Naia in a tone of horror, "you would ask me in taking your
  message to Robur, in sending him to Jadgor, to consign our love to
  death?"</p>

  <p>"The price," said Croft in justification, "is very great. Much will Mazzer
  ask&mdash;more than by Tamarizia can be paid for one man's life." ..</p>

  <p>Swiftly the auric fires leaped up in Naia's slender figure. "Is there no
  escape?"</p>

  <p>"I know not," Croft made answer. "It is as Zitu wills. These Zollarians
  with the men of Mazzer have stained themselves blue. Yet whom have I to stain
  my body, were the stain within my grasp, or shave my hair and dye it red in
  time to make the venture? This tent is under guard, and will be, and the
  hands of my body are bound."</p>

  <p>Naia considered. "And the price Mazzer will ask," she spoke slowly after a
  time, "is large?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, as large, I fear, as though the Zollarian war had been lost by
  Tamarizia and Mazhur not regained."</p>

  <p>"And if not paid&mdash;your body&mdash;dies&mdash;and mine."</p>

  <p>"Thine?" Croft tightened the grip of his arms upon her. "What mean you,
  maid of Aphur, by such words?"</p>

  <p>"Aphur means what Aphur says," she returned, and looked him in the eyes.
  For a moment her own were steady, and then they wavered. She clung to him in
  an almost frantic agony of what seemed a momentary panic of more than mortal
  grief. Then that, too, had passed, giving way to an almost passionate mood.
  "Think you that when life has left your body, Naia of Aphur, too, shall not
  lie dead; that to her the body has longer any meaning, save as it delights
  you, save as through it she knows the touch of yours? Did you not swear to me
  by Zitu and Azil to return and claim me? And if that promise remains
  unfulfilled, think you that Naia of Aphur will live?"</p>

  <p>"Yet," Croft stammered, shaken by this breath of passion, dazzled by the
  flashing of her being's fire, "if the welfare of Tamarizia demands the
  failure of that promise&mdash;if not with honor can I return to Himyra in the
  body. If your words, beloved, make doubly hard my purpose, when you shall
  have left me and returned to carry my message to your cousin&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By Zitu&mdash;and by Zitu," Naia fired into desperate protest, "it shall
  not be. Azil, giver of life! Shall these foul spawn of Zitemku keep you from
  me? Nay, as I am a daughter of Ga, with your seal upon me, now Ga speaks to
  me!" She broke off and lifted her hands to her breast. Her very eyes were
  fired.</p>

  <p>So for a moment she stood before she went on. "Hark you, Jason, whom I
  love more than my own soul. This tent is guarded as you have said, and a
  price is laid on Tamarizia for your returning. Yet am I not woman whom you
  have wakened for nothing, and my love is not in vain. What price for a man
  who is dead?"</p>

  <p>"By Zitu!" Croft caught her meaning. His glance turned toward the body on
  the ground beside their feet.</p>

  <p>And Naia nodded. "Aye&mdash;Gaya told me in speaking of those things you
  told to Robur and to Zud, and now I know for myself that when the spirit is
  without it, the body lies as dead. Wherefore were it possible for you to
  remain as now you are for a space sufficient to deceive these men of Mazzer
  into thinking that injured in your fall you perchance had died&mdash;think
  you they would keep your body under guard or even near them, lest it foul the
  air even like those rotting corpses which tainted it with horror as I passed
  this night by Atla's walls?"</p>

  <p>"No by Zitu&mdash;they would cast it forth in some other place," Croft
  answered quickly. "Naia&mdash;Ga&mdash;priestess of life, you have said it.
  Together we shall beat them yet."</p>

  <p>"Aye, we shall beat them. Listen further," Naia said. "For a few suns you
  shall appear to be alive, yet faint and not recovered from injury. To Himyra
  shall I return and carry your message to Rob. When seven suns beginning with
  the next are passed, then must you seem to die. Thus shall they carry you
  forth. But the seven days shall be to gain time for what you direct to be
  done. Hai, I am not daughter of Ga for nothing. Beloved&mdash;give me your
  mouth. I must be gone."</p>

  <p>Life! Life and this woman! There was a chance. Her wits had found it where
  his had milled around. Daughter of Ga was she as she said&mdash;and perhaps
  Ga&mdash;the eternal woman, had spoken to her through the elements which went
  into forming her nature first. Croft took her once more closely into his
  arms.</p>

  <p>"Seek not to leave your body for one moment between now and the end of the
  seventh sun," she cautioned, "lest one should note it and so at the proper
  time entertain a doubt of your real death."</p>

  <p>Croft marveled. To him she seemed to think of each infinitesimal detail.
  "No," he gave his promise. "I shall be merely as one who from one sun to
  another fails."</p>

  <p>Naia lifted her lips. And as once before in similar fashion, she yielded
  them to him. For an instant it was as though their two beings blended,
  intermingled, and then she had torn herself from him, divinely glowing. "Zitu
  keep you, beloved," she whispered, and vanished from before his eyes.</p>

  <p>Through the succeeding seven days Croft&mdash;endured&mdash;simply
  endured discomfort&mdash;the trussing up of his arms and feet at night in
  none too gentle fashion, the scant irregularity of poorly furnished meals,
  the absence of aught save trampled grass to sleep upon, renewed attempts on
  the part of Bandhor to force from him some intimation of Tamarizia's
  plans&mdash;the haughty, venomous hate that glared out of Kalamita's tawny
  eyes&mdash;that fury of a woman of the purely physical type, whose allurement
  has been scorned&mdash;of an adventuress, a schemer, whose scheme has
  failed.</p>

  <p>But on the seventh day, as he lay brooding in his tent, close by the huge
  skin headquarters tent of Bandhor, which reminded him more of some Tatar
  chieftain's domicile than anything else, with its hide walls, its
  semibarbaric trappings, its red-and-green standard floating on a pole before
  its door, the door of his own tent was drawn slightly to one side and a face
  appeared to send his heart leaping into his breast.</p>

  <p>Maia, Naia's own maid, was looking shrewdly into his starting eyes. And as
  lost in a maze he lay staring at her, filled with a vast wonder at her
  presence here in the heart of the Mazzerian camp, yet afraid to
  speak&mdash;torn between a desire to learn the meaning of her presence and a
  fear lest any sign of recognition should destroy whatever purpose that
  presence might portend, she flung the flap entirely back and darted
  inside.</p>

  <p>"Thou canor of Tamarizia!" she cried in the voice of a termagant&mdash;a
  shrew&mdash;and struck him with her right hand a smart blow. "Thou foul
  offspring of Zitu fallen to the ground&mdash;thou devil who sent fire against
  my people, whose own people have cast him off, die&mdash;like the canor thou
  art!" And all the time she was shrieking she continued to buffet him with
  blows, striking him with her bare hand, kicking him with her feet. "Die, thou
  pale-faced fiend, whom Bel&mdash;greater than thy Zitu struck down and hurled
  among us&mdash;die&mdash;die now!"</p>

  <p>But Croft, under the storm of her words, her buffetings, made no movement
  of resistance, lay limp and unresisting on the grass. Because even as she
  struck him, even as she lashed him with her tongue, calling him fiend and
  devil and canor&mdash;the name of the great beasts such as Naia's pet and
  protector, Hupor, which was the nearest approach in Palos to a dog; yet as
  her one hand rose and fell above him, her other drew from the narrow apron
  about her blue loins a little looped silver cross, and showed it to him
  briefly and thrust it back, and between the anathema of her lips they moved
  in almost soundless speaking. "Hupor&mdash;give ear to my berating of thee
  closely. I come from one who loves thee greatly&mdash;to show you the
  cross."</p>

  <p>The cross ansata&mdash;the looped symbol of life&mdash;the little sign Zud
  had placed In Naia's hands at their betrothal&mdash;the sign of immortal life
  which came to men through women&mdash;Naia of Aphur was sending it by this
  servant of hers, who loved her, to him! He closed his eyes and nodded
  slightly in understanding as Maia continued to rave. Only now his brain was
  whirling, seething; was a caldron of troubled questions he dared not
  voice&mdash;questions as to why Maia had been sent to aid in his escape, as
  he felt sure now she had. Yet to question the girl were impossible under the
  present conditions, and what was she screaming?</p>

  <p>"Die&mdash;thou canor&mdash;die as Bandhor has decreed thou must, since
  Jadgor has refused thy ransom! Die now&mdash;thou Tamarizian dog!"</p>

  <p>And she had told him to listen closely to her vituperations. Croft gained
  the message she intended. Jadgor had done as he advised, and Bandhor's
  captive had lost value. Wherefore he kept his eyes closed, and seemingly
  died.</p>

  <p>Footsteps! Croft's guard burst through the door. He seized Maia and flung
  her to one side, and stooped above the body with a face of terror. And then
  he straightened and turned upon her. "By Bel, you have killed him!" he
  stammered. "He has been ailing ever since he fell among us. Fool that I was
  to listen to your plea to view him. May Bel send you our commander's
  rage."</p>

  <p>"That rage," Maia said, panting as it. seemed from her exertions and
  emotions, "seeing that he is of value no longer, should not be so
  intense."</p>

  <p>"Come!" The guard seized her by an arm and led her toward Bandhor's
  tent.</p>

  <p>Croft went along, trailing the man and woman's steps. And once inside the
  huge shelter of skins, the guard saluted sharply and hurled Mala before the
  Zollarian noble, so that she sprawled her length on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Behold, O Bandhor"&mdash;he made his report in a gruff bluster designed
  to cover his own face as well as he could&mdash;"this woman who made her way
  by stealth into Jason of Tamarizia's tent and struck him so that he
  died!"</p>

  <p>"Hai!" Bandhor half rose, and sank back and narrowed his eyes. He regarded
  Maia, who groveled before him, her body caught and held, half raised, on
  stretching arms, her head lifted, gazing, into his startled face with
  watchful eyes. "How are you called?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Maia," stammered the woman. "Child am I of a father and mother who have
  lived among his people. All my life have I served them until Bel sent Bandhor
  and my father's people to bring liberation. Then I slipped away and made my
  way to thy army, with which I have stayed the past sun. Wherefore, hearing
  that Bandhor had condemned this one to death, I desired to see him and,
  seeing him, rage overcame me, and I threw myself upon him. Mercy, O Bandhor,
  mighty commander of my people, for this which I have done."</p>

  <p>"Hai!" said Bandhor again, his lids contracting still further. "After all,
  it is a small matter, though my sister will be annoyed. She had planned a
  more lingering death for this insolent man. Yet to death was he condemned,
  and it is finished. Say you that from the bondage of his people you have
  come?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, from Atla, lord."</p>

  <p>"Atla! Now, by Bel!" Bandhor roared. "And what inside the penned-up city
  do these white spawn plan?"</p>

  <p>"They speak of resistance," Maia made answer, "as Bandhor knows. But
  perchance he knows not that many men from Aphur have arrived, armed with the
  chariots they call moturs, which run by fire, and breathe it forth as death,
  and with the sticks that throw death unseen with noise and smoke, unlike the
  flight of an arrow or spear. Ten thousand have reached Bithra, and are
  advancing to the relief of Atla even now. More are said to be journeying from
  Aphur across the Central Sea, and yet others from Nodhur and Milidhur are to
  come."</p>

  <p>"Hai!" For the third time Bandhor said it with a heavy frown. "This is of
  importance. For the information your words contain, I give you
  pardon&mdash;were those other of thy father's children in Tamarizia as
  loyal&mdash;much might be wrought of ill among them were their caste of
  servants to rise and kill and burn. Go!" He turned to the guard, whose face
  had lightened. "Take men and bear forth this body, and cast it beyond the
  camp. Or hold! I will view him myself." For the third time his eyelids
  narrowed, and he rose.</p>

  <p>Followed by Maia and the guard, he entered Croft's tent and bent over the
  body on the ground. "Aye&mdash;his spirit has left him," he said as he
  straightened from the inspection and swung about on his heel.</p>

  <p>"Mighty Bandhor," Maia stayed him. "I may remain for a time in the
  camp."</p>

  <p>Bandhor eyed her. "Oh, aye," he said in careless fashion. "You are a
  comely girl of your people; you should have small trouble in finding some man
  to take you to his tent."</p>

  <p>He turned away, and a moment later a brazen trumpet began sounding a
  summoning blast. As Croft learned, this was a signal to Bandhor's captains
  and advisers to assemble for a council with their chief.</p>

  <p>Maia stole out with the arm of the guard about her, walking coyly, at his
  side. Quite plainly the fellow was inclined to take Bandhor's suggestion
  about her to himself. Croft watched them vanish, and remained beside his own
  body, still huddled on the grass.</p>

  <p>And in the end he followed it&mdash;followed his own body when it was
  borne outside the limits of the encampment and cast into a thicket of bushes,
  where its disposition was watched by Maia, who accompanied the now openly
  amorous guard and lingered beside the thicket with him after the other
  soldiers had cast down their burden and gone.</p>

  <p>"Let us remove its clothing," she suggested. "To waste it were a
  loss."</p>

  <p>The guard assented.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, more than a little aghast, Croft found his material
  tenement stretched stark upon the ground. Maia and her lover were moving off.
  In her arms the girl bore his suit of soft, brown leather.</p>

  <p>In a way now Croft became more and more disturbed. Vague fancies filled
  his mind. At the first he had trusted her wholly, but this last move he did
  not understand. He recalled the story Parthys had told of the blue servants
  rising against their employers during the present trouble, and he marked the
  manner in which she accepted the blue man's advances.</p>

  <p>After all, she was a Mazzerian herself, he thought, and there was no
  reason save her possible affection for Naia to insure her worthiness of
  trust. Still&mdash;she had shown him the tiny cross from the apron about her
  waist, and she had told him to die, as Naia had advised he should. After all,
  she might have some definite reason beyond his present knowledge for
  divesting his body of clothes. And he could do nothing until nightfall. That
  being the case, and the night being several hours removed, there was nothing
  to do but wait. Dead it might be in seeming, yet Croft knew that lying thus
  in the open his body needed protection. In the middle of the thicket he
  settled down beside it. It was rather odd, he found himself thinking, to be
  sitting there keeping an invisible watch of his own form.</p>

  <p>Now and then, as the afternoon passed, he stole a glance at the camp.
  There was bustle there, a moving and shifting of men. It came to him that
  Bandhor, after his council, was preparing for another attack of Atla, urged
  thereto by Maia's report concerning the approaching reinforcements of weapons
  and men. Well, let them attack, he thought with a grim satisfaction. Jadgor
  would hold out through yet one more attack surely, and by then Bandhor would
  have lost his chance, once Robur and his forces had arrived.</p>

  <p>Night came at last. Purposely Croft waited until late before making his
  venture at escape. And while he waited, there stole into the thicket a dim
  shape, which approached his body and sank beside it on the ground.</p>

  <p>It was Maia. More than a little surprised, Croft watched her. She carried
  a bundle. She undid it. She moved higher beside his body and raised his head,
  supporting it on her thighs. Then swiftly she began to shave it, turning it
  to reach the back, and working rapidly on the sides. That done, while
  comprehension flashed into Croft's mind, and with it renewed confidence in
  this girl, as he recalled his words to Naia concerning some such thing as
  this, she took a small box from her bundle and began rubbing the scalp-lock
  she had left upon his poll with a substance it contained. After that she
  lifted a flask and removed a stopper. Working rapidly, she began smearing the
  body with some dark fluid, spreading it thinly upon the skin, rubbing it to
  as even a coating as she might with rapid hands. And as she worked Croft's
  body lost its ivory whiteness and became a dark-hued thing like her own. At
  the end she took a small cloth from the articles she had brought with her and
  twisted it deftly about his loins.</p>

  <p>And as she finished and straightened herself from her labors, Croft,
  sensing it time for his reviving, opened the eyes of the body over which she
  had worked and spoke.</p>

  <p>"Hai," said Maia, without any particular evidence of consternation. "It is
  even so she said it would happen when I had finished. She said that when I
  had shaved you, lord, and reddened your hair, and stained your body, and put
  the loin-cloth upon it, you would reappear."</p>

  <p>"She?" Croft questioned her quickly. "You mean Naia of Aphur, Maia?"</p>

  <p>"Aye. Who else, Hupor Jason?" She rose and picked up her bundle. "Naia, my
  mistress. These are your garments. Come, Hupor, till I lead you to her. She
  lies near."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">XX. &mdash; THE BLUE GIRL OF APHUR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SHE lies near! Croft's senses reeled and then steadied into
  the blinding truth&mdash;the sweetness of it, the full meaning of
  it&mdash;and yet the possible peril to her whom it concerned.</p>

  <p>Naia of Aphur lay near him&mdash;had come to his rescue. .</p>

  <p>Then&mdash;then&mdash;seven days before she had not told him all the plan
  she had in mind. She had told him only the essential portion which most
  closely concerned himself&mdash;and the rest&mdash;this thing&mdash;the part
  which dealt with her aid and assistance when the time for it should arrive,
  she had left unspoken, knowing no doubt he would forbid her risking her own
  integrity in an effort to succor him.</p>

  <p>For an instant he thrilled with blended feeling, and then he spoke to
  Maia. "You mean?"</p>

  <p>"That she lies hid some distance beyond the camp of thy enemies, Hupor.
  Come."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" Croft found himself confused by the manner of Naia's
  presence. Barely seven days had passed since she must have wakened in Himyra
  after their astral conversation in the tent where he lay bound. The time was
  not sufficient to brand Maia's words as truth. And yet Croft knew that he
  believed them. How, then, had Naia come?</p>

  <p>Almost with impatience Maia interrupted. "Seven suns from now she waked
  from her slumber, Hupor, in a most strange mood. For the Hupor Robur she sent
  me, and for long they spoke together, and after that she spoke with me again.
  Bidding me place her in the garment she wears when she dares to rise in the
  air, she took me with her to the great house where the thing she rides is
  kept, and compelled me to enter it with her, so that my spirit turned as weak
  as water when, with a great roaring, we leaped into space."</p>

  <p>"Zitu&mdash;you mean she flew to Bithur?" Croft's stained chest rose
  sharply. His eyes began to flash.</p>

  <p>"Aye, Hupor&mdash;partly in the air like a bird, and partly on the water
  like a boat&mdash;which, praise to Zitu, was calm, and with wonderful
  speed."</p>

  <p>"But fuel&mdash;what is burned in the motur?" Jason questioned.</p>

  <p>Maia shrugged. "Her lips, not mine, should tell you how, like a bird to
  its mate, she came to seek thee, Hupor," she admonished. "Yet&mdash;were not
  the great galleys already seeking to reach Bithur with men and weapons by the
  Hupor Robur's orders? And though he swore by Zitu and Azil she should not
  undertake this madness, he did not refuse to his cousin that which would
  spell her death. On the waves we rode beside the galleys when the thing that
  makes the motur turn was required."</p>

  <p>"My God!" Croft spoke not as a man of Tamarizia, but of earth. Naia had
  solved all difficulties, driven by the desire of saving him from the results
  of his own misfortune. She had overcome all obstacles in her desire to reach
  him. And this was love&mdash;the flight of Naia of Aphur, as the blue girl
  had phrased it, like that of a bird to its mate.</p>

  <p>"On the night of the sun before this we came down in an open place in the
  forest," Maia explained further. "There the great wings we rode on lie hid.
  And some distance farther in this direction she awaits thee, Hupor.
  Come."</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Croft, and caught a great, a wondrous breath of realization.
  "Aye, come." And now as he moved off, where he had delayed before he seemed
  fired by an all-compelling haste.</p>

  <p>To reach her&mdash;to meet her&mdash;to greet her and gather her into his
  arms! To hold her, sense the strength, the softness, the ripened glory of
  her; to hold her, and know that no matter how beautiful she was in body, the
  beauty and strength of her spirit was no less. To hold her and know, realize,
  feel that the beauty, the strength, the glory of both soul and body were his.
  He started out of the thicket at a pace that made Maia gasp:</p>

  <p>"Walk not so quickly, Hupor, and permit that I walk at thy side. Seen we
  may be of many, and though thou are stained to the seeming of a man of
  Mazzer, yet were it best that you seem also not as one in haste, but as a man
  who strolls through the camp with a woman at his side."</p>

  <p>"Aye." Croft nodded in understanding and slackened his stride.
  "Aye&mdash;Maia&mdash;yet lead me to her as quickly as you can."</p>

  <p>Their course led them after a time into the depths of the gloomy forest,
  where the moons were blotted out or their light filtered in streaming tatters
  through the trees. And there Croft spoke again to his companion.</p>

  <p>"I failed to understand when you put it into the mind of the guard to make
  way with my clothes."</p>

  <p>Maia made a clicking sound suggestive of an almost impish amusement as she
  answered. "But&mdash;since I was to paint your body, Hupor, it was easier for
  me to bring the pigments wrapped inside them, when I slipped away from him
  after he had drunk wine into which I had dropped a substance to induce heavy
  slumber I had brought with me inside my girdle band. Indeed, we three appear
  now no more than as other children of Mazzer. My mistress, when we come upon
  her, will seem no other than myself."</p>

  <p>"You mean you have stained her?" Jason questioned.</p>

  <p>"Aye, lord, from the roots of her golden hair to her graceful heels. For
  two suns, as I have told you, has it been needful for her to lie in the open
  while I made my way to the camp and performed my mission, and had any come
  upon her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She turned aside and swept back a screen of branches. She plunged through
  and came into a break in the forest close to the banks of a tiny stream
  across a little glade. And there she pursed her lips and sent quivering
  through the moonlight what seemed a nightbird's call.</p>

  <p>It was answered. Maia repeated, and paused, and whistled again. Then
  touching Croft on the arm, she urged him forth from the shadow until he stood
  revealed in the rays of the Palosian moons.</p>

  <p>And from the shadows beyond him another shape appeared. Slight it was and
  slender, graceful as a faun, as it came swiftly toward him on flying feet,
  graceful as a dryad of the forest in its every supple, sweeping line save for
  where it was girdled by a band of white.</p>

  <p>So much Croft saw, and advanced to meet it, and found it Naia, veiled as
  she stood before him from head to waist in the heavy cloud of her
  auburn-tinted hair.</p>

  <p>And then she lay against him&mdash;his arms were straining her to his
  breast, and that cloud of ruddy hair was like the kiss of satin against his
  naked chest. And her hands were clinging to him, her arms were holding him
  fast.</p>

  <p>"Jason, beloved," she panted, "you are safe&mdash;uninjured, alive!"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;thanks to you, beloved, and to Maia," Croft replied, and kissed
  her.</p>

  <p>"Thou"&mdash;Naia of Aphur flung up her head and turned to the girl of
  Mazzer&mdash;"thou who this night have brought me more than life or anything
  besides&mdash;thou shall never leave me&mdash;thou shall remain always with
  me&mdash;and with him. My children you shall cradle in your arms&mdash;and
  if love comes to you as to me and offspring, I swear it&mdash;to me they
  shall be as mine."</p>

  <p>"My mistress," Maia faltered, bending her head before Naia.</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;you are my sister," said Naia, smiling, and took her by the
  hand. And after that she spoke again to Croft. "Yet&mdash;I am forgetting.
  Not yet are we free from danger. Thrice today have men roamed through the
  forest while I hid me beneath the leaves. But thy huge bird waits to bear us
  high above them. Come, beloved, come."</p>

  <p>For an hour after that, his arm about her, or walking hand in
  hand&mdash;as though now they were once more together they sought the
  assurance of the fact through every thrilling sense&mdash;they hurried on.
  And then once more the moonlight filled all the bowl of a tree-ringed opening
  in the forest, and struck dull gleams from the copper body of the waiting
  airplane. Huge, impotent, in seeming, it squatted there, waiting their touch
  to wake it; its interlacing struts and trusses making a spider-webbed pattern
  in shadow on the ground.</p>

  <p>Naia drew her ruddy tresses about her as they stepped into the forest
  meadow.</p>

  <p>"Put on your flying garments now, beloved," she prompted, "while Maia and
  I find ours and put them on."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later Croft lifted both women to their seats. Then as Naia,
  save for her strained face and changed hair, very much herself in her brown
  flying garments, took her place at the control, he seized the blades of the
  propeller and sent the engine round.</p>

  <p>The plane swung with them like some monster bat beneath the skies. It
  turned. It rushed off under Naia's guiding, its vanes all silvered now like
  the top of the forest in the moonlight, bearing its burden of renewed life
  and love.</p>

  <p>Far, far away on the plain where Croft had lain captive, still winked the
  light of fires. They came closer, closer, as the airplane ate through the
  trackless distance&mdash;were beneath it&mdash;were left behind.</p>

  <p>Around, in a monster circle&mdash;a descending spiral. Once more around.
  Again and again in a vast, wide turning, sinking lower and lower down. The
  lights on the Bith were closer. Closer the fire-ums burned. Below was the
  wide-flung reach of the street along the river, and straight above it the
  airplane swung. The hum of the motor died, and the night wind sang in a
  sinking whisper past it. It slipped down a long hill of air and sped along
  the ground.</p>

  <p>And as it stopped, as Croft lifted Naia from her seat, from the entrance
  of Atla's palace there dashed a chariot drawn by gnuppas, their plumes
  tossing, bearing down on the plane with flying feet. Straight as though
  driven in a race, it approached and paused, with the gnuppas on their
  haunches. Robur of Aphur flung aside its silklike curtains and sprung
  down.</p>

  <p>"By Zitu&mdash;and by Zitu, my friend&mdash;my brother&mdash;and thou,
  Naia, my cousin, thou chosen of all Zitu's children!" he cried, all poise or
  thought of dignity vanishing as he caught them in his arms.</p>

  <p>They entered the carriage and reclined upon the padded cushions, the
  princess commanding Maia to take a place at her side. They were driven to the
  palace, and there Croft was led to a room. And there attendants labored until
  the last of the blue pigment vanished, and his skin merged from beneath it a
  most surprising pink from the necessary force they used. As for the ruddy
  scalplock, he had it shaved off as the simplest way of settling the matter
  regarding his hair. He was glowing, both literally and with the thoughts
  induced by the manner of his escape and return when Robur appeared.</p>

  <p>Bidding the servants fetch his customary garments, leg-cases, tunic,
  helmet, and metal cuirass, he dismissed them and proceeded to clothe
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Hai!" Robur eyed him. "As once before I remarked, thou art 'a sight.' And
  a sight thou art for more than the eyes of a maid, Jason, my friend. In
  Zitu's name, what chanced to the airplane that thy plans went wrong? In Atla
  there was well-nigh a panic when you failed of your return."</p>

  <p>Croft explained, and Robur nodded.</p>

  <p>"Aye, it was the same with the moturs when they 'stalled,' and they knew
  not how to start them; and as you have explained to me, there is small time
  to work upon a motur in the air. My father, however, swore it was a judgment
  of Zitu against him for his stand of the past few Zitrans toward thee. Then
  came Zud and Lakkon with your message, and word that fresh men and weapons
  were assured to lighten his cares."</p>

  <p>"And the dynamo, Rob?" Croft questioned, buckling his cuirass straps and
  standing once more appareled in silver and gold, with the wings and cross in
  blue upon his breast.</p>

  <p>"Lies on a galley even now beside the quays," Robur replied. "What of it,
  Jason? You have a plan?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Croft nodded as he laid a hand on his sword. "A plan to show that
  its wires as well as light, may build a cordon about Atla's walls, to touch
  which shall mean death. Then let Mazzer's Zollarian-commanded horde
  attack."</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;say you so." Robur gained his feet. "Two thousand riflemen are
  with me; four times their number come from Bithra, and should arrive
  tomorrow. Nodhur and Milidhur will send us others. Also, there are the
  moturs&mdash;twelve, all numbered&mdash;and the remaining airplanes, with men
  who know how to fly them to some extent. Aye, let Mazzer and her Zollarian
  leaders attack. But if you are ready, come. I was sent to bid you to a
  feast."</p>

  <p>"A feast?" Croft eyed him sharply.</p>

  <p>And Robur smiled. "Aye, a feast in quality, my friend, if not in numbers,"
  he replied. "Come along, you favored one of Zitu. Naia of Aphur acts hostess
  tonight to her lord."</p>

  <p>Yet even so, Croft did not understand as he followed his friend to a small
  apartment where a table was spread, and found Medai of Bithur, Jadgor,
  Lakkon, Zud, and Naia, already reclining on the couches ranged about the
  board. Nor did he consider greatly, after he had gripped the hand of each man
  present and looked into old Zud's eyes with a glance of mutual understanding,
  and taken the place at Naia's side she indicated by a gesture of her
  hand.</p>

  <p>She was in white&mdash;all save the golden fabric of her girdle where
  against the glistening background the seal of Azil blazed. Save only for that
  spot of color, white as the robe of a vestal, her garment showed. White even
  were the sandals and leg cases on her feet and tapering calves&mdash;of white
  leather as thin and soft as kid. White, too, were the stately plumes above
  her hair, once more a shimmer of gold. And her lips were scarlet as a poppy,
  and her eyes twin lakes of pansy purple, and softly pink, as the blush of
  innocence itself, her warm skin glowed.</p>

  <p>Wherefore Croft was content to put by all consideration to eat; to drink
  of the wine before him with his lips, of Naia with his eyes; listen to the
  congratulations of the others stretched about the tables, while the harps of
  musicians hidden somewhere out of sight were softly played.</p>

  <p>Nor did he dream that anything beyond the celebration of their safe return
  was toward, until old Zud, rising, signaled them to rise.</p>

  <p>So that, all uncomprehending, he obeyed and rose, and giving Naia his
  hand, assisted her to her feet, and stood in silence waiting for the priest
  to speak; becoming aware as he did so that the others had also risen and were
  standing with their eyes on Naia and himself.</p>

  <p>"Children of Zitu, I give ye to one another. May he send his blessings
  upon you, as I, his priest give&mdash;mine."</p>

  <p>So spoke Zud of Zitra, high priest of all Tamarizia, than whose words was
  no higher priestly voice.</p>

  <p>And Naia, reaching down, unpinned the seal of Azil, and placed the
  gleaming jewel in his palm.</p>

  <p>"O Jason, Jason," she stayed his halting question, "think you not that in
  our case custom may be set aside? See you not that so I compelled Zud to
  promise&mdash;before I flew above Atla's walls to find you&mdash;that if we
  returned together, it should be so&mdash;tonight?"</p>

  <p>And then Croft comprehended all the sweetness of her planning. And drew
  her into his arms and held her&mdash;held her until it seemed that all else
  faded away and there was naught in the world save their two selves.</p>

  <p>"My bride," he said; "my&mdash;bride."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">XXI. &mdash; LOST CONFIDENCES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THIS is the story told me by the lips of the sorry wreck on
  the bed, the spirit that looked out of its eyes&mdash;Croft's spirit, as I
  have every reason to believe, since he so frankly admitted what he had done,
  and because every detail of the narrative itself showed complete familiarity
  with the events embraced in the story Croft in his own earthly body had told
  me before.</p>

  <p>"And that's all&mdash;or practically all&mdash;Murray," he said at last
  with a sigh and laid his cigar aside. "I've done a lot of things since then,
  and Tamarizia bids fair to develop into a very up-to-date nation; only I
  needed information concerning a lot of things in regard to which I was
  lacking. It was to gain this information I reversed my first experiment in
  changing bodies. Will you help me to what I need?"</p>

  <p>"I'll help you, of course," I told him; "but what about the Mazzerian
  invasion?"</p>

  <p>He gave me a glance, and the light in his eye was quietly amused.</p>

  <p>"Lord, man, I was forgetting. To me it seemed that the moment in which I
  knew Naia mine was the logical ending. But we beat them. Hadn't I gained what
  I went to Palos to attain? Small chance that Zollaria's blue rabble could
  accomplish the revenge for which she schemed.</p>

  <p>"Rob and I went to work the next day. We put about a thousand riflemen on
  the walls. And then we went outside and set up a lot of posts about twenty
  feet from the base of the walls. Ugh!&mdash;it was nasty work&mdash;with all
  those rotting corpses under foot. But we got them up while the riflemen kept
  the blue men back out of arrow range, and then we hitched one end of our wire
  to an armed motor and pulled it about the walls. In the meantime, however, we
  had to repulse an attack. On the second day Bandhor sent about ten thousand
  Mazzerians against our defenses, and we rolled them back considerably less in
  numbers than when they started, though I must say they fought like devils,
  and for a while it was pretty warm work.</p>

  <p>"We had quite a time getting the wire strung, too, because they used to
  slip in and cut it down at night, so that finally, while I was rigging up a
  motor to run the dynamo and generate the current I meant to charge the wire,
  we gave it up. Then, when the motor was properly harnessed, we took a couple
  of cars and Tan half-way around the walls each way between daylight and dark,
  and hooked the two ends up. And that night, you can take my word for it, the
  Mazzerians found trouble when they came up to undo our work. All you had to
  do was to stand on top of the wall and watch the flashes when those blue men
  hit the wire. Robur thought it was about the best piece of work I had
  accomplished yet.</p><a id="pic8"

  <p>"By that time, however, the eight thousand from Bithra had come up, and we
  began to get ready to stage our own attack. Murray, the present war was just
  started when I went to Palos first. But at the time I defeated Helmor, of
  Zollaria, these tanks I've been reading about in the papers the past few days
  hadn't been thought of, let alone used, on earth. That's one instance in
  which Tamarizia beat this more advanced planet."</p>

  <p>"It was a man of earth who did it," I pointed out.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;possibly, yes." Croft laughed.</p>

  <p>"What I started to say, however, was that I seem to have in a measure
  duplicated their performance and manner of offensive use myself. We used them
  to break the first resistance of the opposing line and pave the way for the
  infantry attack. You will recall the success of their work against Helmor's
  army in the Zollarian campaign. Well, they made good again.</p>

  <p>"We sortied from Atla, with the motors in advance. Under a screen of rifle
  fire from the walls, we moved them out of the gates and placed them back of
  the wire, and filled them with men and grenades. And I picked two men Naia
  had trained in flying better than I could have done it myself. I suppose,
  Murray, fliers, like other men with some special aptitude, are born as much
  as made. My wife is a born aviatrix&mdash;nothing less. She'll do things with
  a plane I daren't attempt, and she'd licked two of the hangar crowd into
  mighty decent shape. I took them, and we used three planes and about a ton of
  bombs. Naia wanted to go along, but I wouldn't let her, but I know she went
  up on the walls with Lakkon and watched.</p>

  <p>"Rob led the motor squadron and I the planes. We gave Bandhor's army
  everything at once. Jadgor had charge of the foot forces. And when everything
  was ready the sortie began.</p>

  <p>"The motors advanced straight over the wire in which the power was turned
  off. I took my planes over the walls from the concourse along the Bith, and
  hit the blue army first with a shower of bombs. That upset them more or less.
  I honestly think the sight of the planes themselves shook them as much as
  anything else.</p>

  <p>And, of course, Robur made contact with his armored cars before they had
  steadied themselves. They fought&mdash;oh, yes, they fought, but they were
  beaten from the first. They tried to stall the motors and overturn them as
  they had when Jadgor used them against their army first. But this time they
  didn't stall, or not for long at a time&mdash;and what of the enemy weren't
  shot by the men inside them either ran away or were crushed. One did get
  stuck in the timber, and was in a pretty bad way until Robur himself got to
  it and drove the Mazzerians about it off. On the whole, however, they did
  splendidly, and tore some awful gaps in Bandhor's line.</p>

  <p>The infantry, coming up to the attack behind them, finished the work.
  Inside thirty minutes there wasn't any real army before us so much as the
  fragments of an army fighting where they fought at all, in small,
  disorganized bands. Thousands ran away in bodies. Hundreds hid in the woods.
  The riflemen mopped them up in droves. In a surprisingly short time Rob broke
  clear through the line with three of the motors, and got out of the fringe of
  forest between Atla and that great plain where Bandhor had his tent. And as
  luck would have it, he was just in time. Bandhor was about to leave.
  Rob"&mdash;the eyes of the man on the bed twinkled&mdash;"suggested in a
  somewhat urgent fashion that he remain&mdash;and his sister with him. I
  mustn't forget Kalamita at the last. He stuck both of them into one of the
  motors under guard and sent them straight back inside Atla's walls, and after
  that, what with the planes above them and the two remaining
  motors&mdash;Rob's own and the other&mdash;the Mazzerian army met a warm
  reception when it streamed out of the forest upon that plain. The end came
  right there. Mazzer's organized force broke up. It quit cold and ran. For a
  week we were hazing them in small bands out of Bithur, but they never
  stiffened up enough to offer a real fight again."</p>

  <p>"And what about Bandhor and his sister?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>Croft smiled. "I have every reason to think they were surprised to find me
  alive. I know Bandhor swore when we met the first time, and Kalamita turned a
  bit whiter that I had ever seen her before. We held them, Murray. Zollaria
  found out two could play at the same ransom game. Only Zollaria paid&mdash;a
  million sesterons, which, you may appreciate, is equivalent to about a
  million pounds. I hardly think she'll care to try conclusions with Tamarizia
  very soon again."</p>

  <p>"And since then you've gone on introducing innovations, I suppose?" I
  said.</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Yes. Naia and I went to Lakkon's mountain house. He gave it to
  us for our own. There were a lot of associations about it, and I was glad to
  accept it for a dwelling. As I told you, Tamarizia bids fair to come up to
  date. We're printing papers in Himyra and Zitra now, my friend. We've
  established a system of free schools. Now I'm after more rapid means of
  communications mainly&mdash;we've a sort of telephone&mdash;short-distance
  lines which I want to improve, and I want to establish telegraph and
  wireless. Astral communication may do between harmonized minds, but it's too
  much to expect to educate a people into anything like that.</p>

  <p>"Also, I want to improve the medical caste. Oh, I've done a lot, but I
  want to do a million things yet. So I talked it over with Naia, and we
  decided that I should come back&mdash;reverse the experiment. We've been back
  in the astral condition, of course, more than once. I've brought her
  with-me&mdash;shown her earth. She understands&mdash;and she's waiting for my
  success in this matter even now, up there in the mountains where I told her I
  loved her first. And see here&mdash;it may be that some attendant will tell
  you I'm pretty sound asleep almost any night. If I take the notion I'm apt to
  slip up to tell her how things are going along. So&mdash;if that happens,
  don't let it fuss you&mdash;though, with your understanding, I don't suppose
  it would. Anyway, I'll promise you now to give you warning when the work I
  came back for is done."</p>

  <p>"And you're happy?" I questioned.</p>

  <p>"Happy?" He gave me a strange glance. "Man, the word's inadequate. I've
  found the complement of my nature&mdash;speaking in that sense, I'm
  satisfied. And&mdash;as though that wasn't enough&mdash;it's five Zitrans
  now&mdash;six months about, as you estimate time, since Naia told
  me&mdash;that, in the quiet of the night, she had heard the whisper of Azil's
  wings. I&mdash;I don't know, Murray, both she and I hope it will be a
  boy&mdash;but whether it is or not&mdash;boy or girl, it is ours&mdash;the
  final proof of our love&mdash;of the blending of my life and hers."</p>

  <p>I helped him. Of course I helped him.</p>

  <p>I did everything within my power to furnish him with the information he
  required. A month went by, and two, and nearly every night of that time we
  spent at least an hour in confidential talk.</p>

  <p>And then, one night, he caught me by the hand and looked into my eyes and
  gripped my fingers hard. "I'm going, Murray," he said, smiling. "I've got
  what I came for, I fancy&mdash;so don't be surprised. And see here&mdash;Naia
  knows all about you. I've told her; and when I speak to her first in the
  flesh on Palos, I'm going to tell her how much you've contributed to the
  success of this undertaking. And if ever you give us a thought, you can feel
  that there's a woman&mdash;a wife and mother&mdash;up here on another star
  whose heart holds a warm spot for you&mdash;the one man on earth who knows
  our story&mdash;big enough&mdash;broad enough to refuse to balk at the
  truth."</p>

  <p>I returned his gripping pressure, more than a little affected by his
  words. "Naia of Aphur is as real to me as I am myself,"</p>

  <p>I replied. "And hang it, man&mdash;I&mdash;I wish I was up there with
  you. I'd like to be your physician. I'd consider it a privilege to watch the
  light in her eyes when they first see Jason Croft's son."</p>

  <p>"Man," he said; "man, I could love you for that," and wrung my hand
  again.</p>

  <p>It was midnight when the night superintendent called and told me No. 27
  had died.</p>
