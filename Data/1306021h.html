  <h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">O&rsquo;SHEA was in his maddest mood, had been like it all
night. Stalking
  up and down the grassy slope, muttering to himself, waving his hands at some
  invisible audience, cackling with laughter at his own mysterious jokes; and
  at dawn he had fallen upon little Lipski, who had dared light a cigarette in
  defiance of instructions, and had beaten him with savage brutality, and the
  other two men had not dared interfere.</p>

  <p>Joe Connor sprawled on the ground, chewing a blade of grass, and watching
  with sombre eyes the restless figure. Marks, who sat cross-legged by his
  side, watched too, but there was a twisted and sneering smile on his thin
  lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mad as a coot,&rdquo; said Joe Connor in a low voice. &ldquo;If he
  pulls this job off without getting us in gaol for the rest of our lives
  we&rsquo;ll be lucky.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Soapy Marks licked his dry lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s cleverest when he&rsquo;s mad.&rdquo; He spoke like a
  man of culture. Some said that Soapy was intended for the church before a
  desire for an easier and more illicit method of living made him one of the
  most skillful, and nearly the most dangerous, gangster in England.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lunacy, my dear fellow, does not mean stupidity. Can&rsquo;t you
  stop that fellow blubbering?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Joe Connor did not rise; he turned his eyes in the direction of the
  prostrate figure of Lipski, who was groaning and swearing sobbingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get over it,&rdquo; he said indifferently. &ldquo;The
  bigger beating he gets the more he respects O&rsquo;Shea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He wriggled a little closer to his confederate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen O&rsquo;Shea&mdash;his face, I mean?&rdquo; he
  asked, dropping his voice a note lower. &ldquo;I never have, and I&rsquo;ve
  done two&rdquo;&mdash;he thought&mdash;&ldquo;three,&rdquo; he corrected,
  &ldquo;jobs with him. He&rsquo;s always had that coat on he&rsquo;s got now,
  with the collar right up to his nose, the same old hat over his eyes. I never
  used to believe there was that kind of crook&mdash;thought they were only
  seen on the stage. First time I ever heard of him was when he sent for
  me&mdash;met him on the St. Albans Road about twelve o&rsquo;clock, but never
  saw his face. He knew all about me; told me how many convictions I&rsquo;d
  had, and the kind of work he wanted me for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And paid you well,&rdquo; said Marks lazily, when the other paused.
  &ldquo;He always pays well; he always picks up his &lsquo;staff&rsquo; in the
  same way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pursed his lips as though he were going to whistle, examined the
  restless figure of the master thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad&mdash;and he pays well. He will pay better this
  time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Connor looked up sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two hundred and fifty quid and fifty getaway
  money&mdash;that&rsquo;s fair, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He will pay better,&rdquo; said Marks suavely. &ldquo;This little
  job deserves it. Am I to drive a motor-lorry containing three tons of
  Australian sovereigns through the streets of London, possibly risk hanging,
  for two hundred and fifty pounds&mdash;and getaway money? I think
  not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet and dusted his knees daintily. O&rsquo;Shea had
  disappeared over the crest of the hill, was possibly behind the hedge line
  which swept round in a semi-circle till it came within half a dozen feet of
  where the men were talking of him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Three tons of gold; nearly half a million pounds. At least I think
  we&rsquo;re entitled to ten per cent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Connor grinned, jerked his head towards the whimpering Lipski.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Marks bit his lip.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we could include him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He glanced round again for some sign of O&rsquo;Shea, and dropped down
  beside his companion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the whole thing in our hands,&rdquo; he said in a
  voice that was little more than a whisper. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be sane
  to-morrow. These fits only come on him at rare intervals; and a sane man will
  listen to reason. We&rsquo;re holding up this gold convoy&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  one of O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s oldest tricks, to fill a deep cutting full of
  gas. I wonder he dare repeat it. I am driving the lorry to town and hiding
  it. Would O&rsquo;Shea give us our share if he had to decide between an
  unpleasant interview with us and a more unpleasant interview with Inspector
  Bradley?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Connor plucked another blade of grass and chewed on it gloomily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s clever,&rdquo; he began, and again Marks&rsquo; lips
  curled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they all?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
  Dartmoor full of clever people? That&rsquo;s old Hallick&rsquo;s great
  joke&mdash;he calls all the prisoners collegers. No, my dear Connor, believe
  me, cleverness is a relative term&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; growled Connor with a frown.
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try swank on me, Soapy&mdash;use words I can
  understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked around again a little anxiously for the vanished O&rsquo;Shea.
  Behind the hill crest, in a narrow lane, O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s big car was
  parked that would carry him to safety after the job. His confederates would
  be left to take all the risks, face the real dangers which would follow,
  however cleverly the coup was organised.</p>

  <p>A little distance away to the left, on the edge of the deep cutting, four
  big steel gas cylinders lay in line. Even from where he sprawled he could see
  the long white road leading into the cutting, on which presently would appear
  the flickering lights of the gold convoy. His gas mask lay under his hand;
  Marks had his sticking out of his coat pocket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He must have a lot of stuff,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;O&rsquo;Shea?&rdquo; Marks shrugged his shoulders.
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He spends money like a lunatic. I should think he
  was broke. It&rsquo;s nearly twelve months since he had a big
  haul.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What does he do with the money?&rdquo; asked Connor curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Spends it, as we all do,&rdquo; was the laconic answer. &ldquo;He
  talked about buying a big country house last time I saw him; he was going to
  settle down and live the life of a gentleman. Last night, when I had a chat
  with him, he said it would take half this loot to pay his debts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Marks examined his well-manicured nails.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amongst other things he&rsquo;s a liar,&rdquo; he said lightly.
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked towards the line of bushes a few yards distant. He had heard a
  rustle, the snap of a twig, and was on his feet instantly. Crossing the short
  intervening space, he peered over the bushes. There was nobody in sight. He
  came back thoughtfully to Connor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder if the devil was listening,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and how
  long he&rsquo;s been listening!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;O&rsquo;Shea?&rdquo; asked the startled Connor.</p>

  <p>Marks did not reply, but drew a deep breath. Obviously he was
  uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;d heard anything he would have come for me. He&rsquo;s
  moody&mdash;he&rsquo;s been moody all night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this point Connor got up and stretched himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know how he lives. I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s got
  a wife and family tucked away somewhere&mdash;that kind of bird always has.
  There he is!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The figure of O&rsquo;Shea had appeared across the rise; he was coming
  towards them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get your masks ready. You don&rsquo;t want any further
  instructions, Soapy?&rdquo; The voice, muffled by the high collar which
  reached to the tip of his nose, was rational, almost amiable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pick that fellow up.&rdquo; He pointed to Lipski, and, when the
  order had been obeyed, he called the cringing man before him.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go to the end of the road, put your red lantern on and
  stop them. By stop them I mean slow them down. Don&rsquo;t let yourself be
  seen; there are ten armed men on the lorry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He examined the cylinders; from the nozzle of each a thick rubber pipe
  trailed down into the cutting. With a spanner he opened the valve of each,
  and the silence was broken by the deep hissing of the gas as it escaped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll lie in the bottom, so you needn&rsquo;t put on your
  masks till we&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>He followed Lipski to the end of the cutting, watched the red lamp lit,
  and pointed out the place where the man was to hide. Then he came back to
  Marks. Not by word or sign did he betray the fact that he had overheard the
  two men talking. If there was to be a quarrel this was not the moment for it.
  O&rsquo;Shea was intensely sane at that moment.</p>

  <p>They heard the sound of the incoming trolley before they saw the flicker
  of its lights emerge from the cover of Felsted Wood.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Shea sharply.</p>

  <p>He made no attempt to draw on a mask, as did his two assistants.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to use your guns, but keep them handy in case
  anything goes wrong&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget that if the guard isn&rsquo;t
  knocked out immediately it will shoot at sight. You know where to meet me
  to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The shrouded head of Soapy nodded.</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer came the gold convoy. Evidently the driver had seen the
  red light at the end of the cutting, for his siren sounded. From where
  O&rsquo;Shea crouched he commanded a complete view of the road.</p>

  <p>The trolley was within fifty yards of the cutting and had slowed
  perceptibly when he saw a man leap up, not from the place where he had posted
  him, but a dozen yards farther up the road. It was Lipski, and as he ran
  towards the moving trolley his hand went up, there was a flash and a report.
  He was firing to attract attention. O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s eyes glowed like
  coals. Lipski had betrayed him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stand by to run!&rdquo; His voice was like a rasp.</p>

  <p>And then the miracle happened. From the trolley leapt two pencils of
  flame, and Lipski crumpled up and fell by the side of the road as the lorry
  rumbled past. The guard had misunderstood his action; thought he was
  attempting to hold them up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glorious,&rdquo; whispered O&rsquo;Shea huskily, and at that
  instant the lorry went down into the gas-filled cutting.</p>

  <p>It was all over in a second. The driver fell forward in his seat, and,
  released of his guidance, the front wheels of the lorry jammed into a
  bank.</p>

  <p>O&rsquo;Shea thought of everything. But for that warning red light the
  trolley would have been wrecked and his plans brought to naught. As it was,
  Marks had only to climb into the driver&rsquo;s seat, and reverse the engine,
  to extricate it from the temporary block.</p>

  <p>A minute later the gold convoy had climbed up to the other side of the
  depression. The unconscious guard and driver had been bundled out and laid on
  the side of the road. The final preparations took no more than five minutes.
  Marks stripped his mask, pulled on a uniform cap, and Connor took his place
  in the trolley where the gold was stored in small white boxes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Shea, and the trolley moved forward and
  four minutes later was out of sight.</p>

  <p>O&rsquo;Shea went back to his big, high-powered car and drove off in the
  opposite direction, leaving only the unconscious figures of the guard to
  testify to his ruthlessness.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a rainy night in London. Connor, who had preferred
it so, turned
  into the side door of a little restaurant in Soho, mounted the narrow stairs
  and knocked on a door. He heard a chair move and the snap of the lock as the
  door was opened.</p>

  <p>Soapy Marks was there alone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you see him?&rdquo; asked Connor eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;Shea? Yes, I met him on the Embankment. Have you seen the
  newspapers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Connor grinned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad those birds didn&rsquo;t die,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Marks sneered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your humanity is very creditable, my dear friend,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>On the table was a newspaper, and the big headlines stared out, almost
  shouted their excitement.</p>

  <p class="headline">Greatest Gold Robbery of Our Time.<br>
  Three Tons of Gold Disappear<br>
  Between Southampton and London.<br>
  Dead Robber Found by the Roadside.<br>
  The Vanished Lorry.</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">In the early hours of yesterday morning a daring outrage
  was committed which might have led to the death of six members of the C.I.D.,
  and resulted in the loss to the Bank of England of gold valued at half a
  million pounds.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">The <i>Aritania</i>, which arrived in Southampton last
  night, brought a heavy consignment of gold from Australia, and in order that
  this should be removed to London with the least possible ostentation, it was
  arranged that a lorry carrying the treasure should leave Southampton at three
  o&rsquo;clock in the morning, arriving in London before the normal flow of
  traffic started. At a spot near Felsted Wood the road runs down into a
  depression and through a deep cutting. Evidently this had been laid with gas,
  and the car dashed into what was practically a lethal chamber without
  warning.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">That an attack was projected, however, was revealed to
  the guard before they reached the fatal spot. A man sprang out from a hedge
  and shot at the trolley. The detectives in charge of the convoy immediately
  replied, and the man was later found in a dying condition. He made no
  statement except to mention a name which is believed to be that of the leader
  of the gang.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">Sub-Inspectors Bradley and Hallick of Scotland Yard are
  in charge of the case....</p><br>

  <p>There followed a more detailed account, together with an official
  statement issued by the police, containing a brief narrative by one of the
  guard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems to have created something of a sensation,&rdquo; smiled
  Marks, as he folded up the paper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What about O&rsquo;Shea?&rdquo; asked the other impatiently.
  &ldquo;Did he agree to split?&rdquo; Marks nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was a little annoyed&mdash;naturally. But in his sane moments
  our friend, O&rsquo;Shea, is a very intelligent man. What really annoyed him
  was the fact that we had parked the lorry in another place than where he
  ordered it to be taken. He was most anxious to discover our little secret,
  and I think his ignorance of the whereabouts of the gold was our biggest pull
  with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going to happen?&rdquo; asked Connor in a troubled
  tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking the lorry to-night to Barnes Common. He
  doesn&rsquo;t realise, though he will, that we&rsquo;ve transferred the gold
  to a small three-ton van. He ought to be very grateful to me for my
  foresight, for the real van was discovered this evening by Hallick in the
  place where O&rsquo;Shea told me to park it. And of course it was
  empty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Connor rubbed his hand across his unshaven chin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;Shea won&rsquo;t let us get away with it,&rdquo; he said,
  with a worried frown. &ldquo;You know him, Soapy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; said Mr. Marks, with a confident smile.</p>

  <p>He poured out a whisky and soda.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drink up and we&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; He glanced at his watch.
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got plenty of time&mdash;thank God there&rsquo;s a war on,
  and the active and intelligent constabulary are looking for spies, the
  streets are nicely darkened, and all is favourable to our little arrangement.
  By the way, I&rsquo;ve had a red cross painted on the tilt of our
  van&mdash;it looks almost official!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That there was a war on, they discovered soon after they turned into the
  Embankment. Warning maroons were banging from a dozen stations; the darkened
  tram which carried them to the south had hardly reached Kennington Oval
  before the anti-aircraft guns were blazing at the unseen marauders of the
  skies. A bomb dropped all too close for the comfort of the nervous Connor.
  The car had stopped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We had better get out here,&rdquo; whispered Marks. &ldquo;They
  won&rsquo;t move till the raid is over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The two men descended to the deserted street and walked southward. The
  beams of giant searchlights swept the skies; from somewhere up above came the
  rattle of a machine-gun.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This should keep the police thoroughly occupied,&rdquo; said Marks,
  as they turned into a narrow street in a poor neighbourhood. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t think we need miss our date, and our little ambulance should pass
  unchallenged.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish to God you&rsquo;d speak English!&rdquo; growled Connor
  irritably.</p>

  <p>Marks had stopped before the gates of a stable yard, pushing them. One
  yielded to his touch and they walked down the uneven drive to the small
  building where the car was housed. Soapy put his key into the gate of the
  lock-up and turned it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; he said, as he stepped inside.</p>

  <p>And then a hand gripped him, and he reached for his gun.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make any fuss,&rdquo; said the hated voice of Inspector
  Hallick. &ldquo;I want you, Soapy. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll tell me what&rsquo;s
  happened to this ambulance of yours?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Soapy Marks stared towards the man he could not see, and for a moment was
  thrown off his guard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The lorry?&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Been gone an hour,&rdquo; said a second voice. &ldquo;Come across,
  Soapy; what have you done with it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Soapy said nothing; he heard the steel handcuffs click on the wrist of Joe
  Connor, heard that man&rsquo;s babble of incoherent rage and blasphemy as he
  was hustled towards the car which had drawn up silently at the gate, and knew
  that Mr. O&rsquo;Shea was indeed very sane on that particular day.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">TO Mary Redmayne life had been a series of inequalities.
She could
  remember the alternate prosperity and depression of her father; had lived in
  beautiful hotel suites and cheap lodgings, one following the other with
  extraordinary rapidity; and had grown so accustomed to the violent changes of
  his fortune that she would never have been surprised to have been taken from
  the pretentious school where she was educated, and planted amongst county
  school scholars at any moment.</p>

  <p>People who knew him called him Colonel, but he himself preferred his
  civilian title, and volunteered no information to her as to his military
  career. It was after he had taken Monkshall that he permitted
  &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; to appear on his cards. It was a grand-sounding name,
  but even as a child Mary Redmayne had accepted such appellations with the
  greatest caution. She had once been brought back from her preparatory school
  to a &ldquo;Mortimer Lodge,&rdquo; to discover it was a tiny semi-detached
  villa in a Wimbledon by-street.</p>

  <p>But Monkshall had fulfilled all her dreams of magnificence; a veritable
  relic of Tudor times, and possibly of an earlier period, it stood in forty
  acres of timbered ground, a dignified and venerable pile, which had such
  association with antiquity that, until Colonel Redmayne forbade the practice,
  charabancs full of American visitors used to come up the broad drive and gaze
  upon the ruins of what had been a veritable abbey.</p>

  <p>Fortune had come to Colonel Redmayne when she was about eleven. It came
  unexpectedly, almost violently. Whence it came, she could not even guess; she
  only knew that one week he was poor, harassed by debt-collectors, moving
  through side streets in order to avoid his creditors; the next week&mdash;or
  was it month?&mdash;he was master of Monkshall, ordering furniture worth
  thousands of pounds.</p>

  <p>When she went to live at Monkshall she had reached that gracious period of
  interregnum between child and woman. A slim girl above middle height, straight
  of back, free of limb, she held the eye of men to whom more mature charms
  would have had no appeal.</p>

  <p>Ferdie Fane, the young man who came to the Red Lion so often, summer and
  winter, and who drank so much more than was good for him, watched her passing
  along the road with her father. She was hatless; the golden-brown hair had a
  glory of its own; the faultless face, the proud little lift of her chin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Spring is here, Adolphus,&rdquo; he addressed the landlord gravely.
  &ldquo;I have seen it pass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was a man of thirty-five, long-faced, rather good-looking in spite of
  his huge horn-rimmed spectacles. He had a large tankard of beer in his hand
  now, which was unusual, for he did most of his drinking secretly in his room.
  He used to come down to the Red Lion at all sorts of odd and sometimes
  inconvenient moments. He was, in a way, rather a bore, and the apparition of
  Mary Redmayne and her grim-looking father offered the landlord an opportunity
  for which he had been seeking.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder you don&rsquo;t go and stay at Monkshall, Mr. Fane,&rdquo;
  he suggested.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fane stared at him reproachfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you tired of me, mine host?&rdquo; he asked gently. &ldquo;That
  you should shuffle me into other hands?&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;I am
  no paying guest&mdash;besides which, I am not respectable. Why does Redmayne
  take paying guests at all?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The landlord could offer no satisfactory solution to this mystery.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m blest if I know. The colonel&rsquo;s got plenty of money.
  I think it is because he&rsquo;s lonely, but he&rsquo;s had paying guests at
  Monkshall this past ten years. Of course, it&rsquo;s very select.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Ferdie Fane with great gravity. &ldquo;And
  that is why I should not be selected! No, I fear you will have to endure my
  erratic visits.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind your being here, sir,&rdquo; said the landlord,
  anxious to assure him. &ldquo;You never give me any trouble,
  only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only you&rsquo;d like somebody more regular in his
  habits&mdash;good luck!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He lifted the foaming pewter to his lips, took a long drink, and then he
  began to laugh softly, as though at some joke. In another minute he was
  serious again, frowning down into the tankard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pretty girl, that. Mary Redmayne, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s only been back from school a month&mdash;or college,
  rather,&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the nicest young lady
  that ever drew the breath of life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They all are,&rdquo; said the other vaguely. He went away the next
  day with his fishing rod that he hadn&rsquo;t used, and his golf bag which
  had remained unstrapped throughout his stay.</p>

  <p>Life at Monkshall promised so well that Mary Redmayne was prepared to love
  the place. She liked Mr. Goodman, the grey-haired, slow-spoken gentleman who
  was the first of her father&rsquo;s boarders; she loved the grounds, the
  quaint old house; could even contemplate, without any great uneasiness, the
  growing taciturnity of her father. He was older, much older than he had been;
  his face had a new pallor; he seldom smiled. He was a nervous man, too; she
  had found him walking about in the middle of the night, and once had
  surprised him in his room, suspiciously thick of speech, with an empty whisky
  bottle a silent witness to his peculiar weakness.</p>

  <p>It was the house that began to get on her nerves. Sometimes she would wake
  up in the middle of the night suddenly and sit up in bed, trying to recall
  the horror that had snatched her from sleep and brought her through a dread
  cloud of fear to wakefulness. Once she had heard peculiar sounds that had
  sent cold shivers down her spine. Not once, but many times, she thought she
  heard the faint sound of a distant organ.</p>

  <p>She asked Cotton, the dour butler, but he had heard nothing. Other
  servants had been more sensitive, however; there came a constant procession
  of cooks and housemaids giving notice. She interviewed one or two of these,
  but afterwards her father forbade her seeing them, and himself accepted their
  hasty resignations.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This place gives me the creeps, miss,&rdquo; a weeping housemaid
  had told her. &ldquo;Do you hear them screams at night? I do; I sleep in the
  east wing. The place is haunted&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Anna!&rdquo; scoffed the girl, concealing a shudder.
  &ldquo;How can you believe such things!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is, miss,&rdquo; persisted the girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a
  ghost on the lawn, walking about in the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Later, Mary herself began to see things; and a guest who came and stayed
  two nights had departed a nervous wreck.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Imagination,&rdquo; said the colonel testily. &ldquo;My dear Mary,
  you&rsquo;re getting the mentality of a housemaid!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was very apologetic afterwards for his rudeness, but Mary continued to
  hear, and presently to listen; and finally she saw. . . . Sights that made
  her doubt her own wisdom, her own intelligence, her own sanity.</p>

  <p>One day, when she was walking alone through the village, she saw a man in
  a golf suit; he was very tall and wore horn-rimmed spectacles, and greeted
  her with a friendly smile. It was the first time she had seen Ferdie Fane.
  She was to see very much of him in the strenuous months that followed.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">SUPERINTENDENT HALLICK went down to Princetown in
Devonshire to make his
  final appeal&mdash;an appeal which, he knew, was foredoomed to failure. The
  Deputy-Governor met him as the iron gates closed upon the burly
  superintendent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to get very much out of
  these fellows, superintendent,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re
  too near to the end of their sentence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You never know,&rdquo; said Hallick, with a smile. &ldquo;I once
  had the best information in the world from a prisoner on the day he was
  released.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He went down to the low-roofed building which constitutes the
  Deputy-Governor&rsquo;s office.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My head warder says they&rsquo;ll never talk, and he has a knack of
  getting into their confidence,&rdquo; said the Deputy. &ldquo;If you
  remember, superintendent, you did your best to make them speak ten years ago,
  when they first came here. There&rsquo;s a lot of people in this prison
  who&rsquo;d like to know where the gold is hidden. Personally, I don&rsquo;t
  think they had it at all, and the story they told at the trial, that
  O&rsquo;Shea had got away with it, is probably true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The superintendent pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully. &ldquo;That was the
  impression I had the night I arrested them, but I&rsquo;ve changed my opinion
  since.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The chief warder came in at that moment and gave a friendly nod to the
  superintendent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept those two men in their cells this morning. You want
  to see them both, don&rsquo;t you, superintendent?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see Connor first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo; asked the warder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring him
  down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He went out, passed across the asphalt yard to the entrance of the big,
  ugly building. A steel grille covered the door, and this he unlocked, opening
  the wooden door behind, and passed into the hall, lined on each side with
  galleries from which opened narrow cell doors. He went to one of these on the
  lower tier, snapped back the lock and pulled open the door. The man in
  convict garb who was sitting on the edge of the bed, his face in his hands,
  rose and eyed him sullenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Connor, a gentleman from Scotland Yard has come down to see you. If
  you&rsquo;re sensible you&rsquo;ll give him the information he
  asks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Connor glowered at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to tell, sir,&rdquo; he said sullenly.
  &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they leave me alone? If I knew where the stuff was I
  wouldn&rsquo;t tell &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool,&rdquo; said the chief good-humouredly.
  &ldquo;What have you to gain by hiding up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fool, sir?&rdquo; interrupted Connor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had all
  the fool knocked out of me here!&rdquo; His hand swept round the cell.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in this same cell for seven years; I know every brick
  of it&mdash;who is it wants to see me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Superintendent Hallick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Connor made a wry face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is he seeing Marks too? Hallick, eh? I thought he was
  dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The chief beckoned him out into the hall, and, accompanied by a warder,
  Connor was taken to the Deputy&rsquo;s office. He recognised Hallick with a
  nod. He bore no malice; between these two men, thief-taker and thief, was
  that curious camaraderie which exists between the police and the criminal
  classes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wasting your time with me, Mr. Hallick,&rdquo; said
  Connor. And then, with a sudden burst of anger: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got nothing
  to give you. Find O&rsquo;Shea&mdash; he&rsquo;ll tell you! And find him
  before I do, if you want him to talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We want to find him, Connor,&rdquo; said Hallick soothingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You want the money,&rdquo; sneered Connor; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what
  you want. You want to find the money for the bank and pull in the
  reward.&rdquo; He laughed harshly. &ldquo;Try Soapy Marks&mdash;maybe
  he&rsquo;ll sit in your game and take his corner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The lock turned at that moment and another convict was ushered into the
  room. Soapy Marks had not changed in his ten years of incarceration. The
  gaunt, ascetic face had perhaps grown a little harder; the thin lips were
  firmer, and the deep-set eyes had sunk a little more into his head. But his
  cultured voice, his exaggerated politeness, and that oiliness which had
  earned him his nickname, remained constant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Mr. Hallick!&rdquo; His voice was a gentle drawl.
  &ldquo;Come down to see us at our country house!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He saw Connor and nodded, almost bowed to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, this is most kind of you, Mr. Hallick. You haven&rsquo;t seen
  the park or the garage? Nor our beautiful billiard-room?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, Marks,&rdquo; said the warder sternly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; The bow to the
  warder was a little deeper, a little more sarcastic. &ldquo;Just
  badinage&mdash;nothing wrong intended. Fancy meeting you on the moor, Mr.
  Hallick! I suppose this is only a brief visit? You&rsquo;re not staying with
  us, are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallick accepted the insult with a little smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Marks. &ldquo;Even the police make
  little errors of judgment sometimes. It&rsquo;s deplorable, but it&rsquo;s
  true. We once had an ex-inspector in the hall where I am living.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know why I&rsquo;ve come?&rdquo; said Hallick.</p>

  <p>Marks shook his head, and then a look of simulated surprise and
  consternation came to his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t come to ask me and my poor friend about that
  horrible gold robbery? I see you have. Dear me, how very unfortunate! You
  want to know where the money was hidden? I wish I could tell you. I wish my
  poor friend could tell you, or even your old friend, Mr. Leonard
  O&rsquo;Shea.&rdquo; He smiled blandly. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Connor was chafing under the strain of the interview.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me any more&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Marks waved his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be patient with dear Mr. Hallick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now look here, Soapy,&rdquo; said Connor angrily, and a look of
  pain came to Marks&rsquo; face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not Soapy&mdash;that&rsquo;s vulgar. Don&rsquo;t you agree, Mr.
  Hallick?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to answer no questions. You can do as you
  like,&rdquo; said Connor. &ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t found O&rsquo;Shea, I
  will, and the day I get my hands on him he&rsquo;ll know all about it!
  There&rsquo;s another thing you&rsquo;ve got to know, Hallick; I&rsquo;m on
  my own from the day I get out of this hell. I&rsquo;m not asking Soapy to
  help me to find O&rsquo;Shea. I&rsquo;ve seen Marks every day for ten years,
  and I hate the sight of him. I&rsquo;m working single-handed to find the man
  who shopped me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;ll find him, do you?&rdquo; said Hallick
  quickly. &ldquo;Do you know where he is?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I only know one thing,&rdquo; said Connor huskily, &ldquo;and Soapy
  knows it too. He let it out that morning we were waiting for the gold lorry.
  It just slipped out&mdash;what O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s idea was of a quiet
  hiding-place. But I&rsquo;m not going to tell you. I&rsquo;ve got four months
  to serve, and when that time is up I&rsquo;ll find O&rsquo;Shea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You poor fool!&rdquo; said Hallick roughly. &ldquo;The police have
  been looking for him for ten years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Looking for what?&rdquo; demanded Connor, ignoring Marks&rsquo;
  warning look.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Len O&rsquo;Shea,&rdquo; said Hallick.</p>

  <p>There came a burst of laughter from the convict.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking for a sane man, and that&rsquo;s where you
  went wrong! I didn&rsquo;t tell you before why you&rsquo;ll never find him.
  It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s mad! You didn&rsquo;t know that, but Soapy
  knows. O&rsquo;Shea was crazy ten years ago. God knows what he is now! Got
  the cunning of a madman. Ask Soapy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was news to Hallick. His eyes questioned Marks, and the little man
  smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid our dear friend is right,&rdquo; said Marks
  suavely. &ldquo;A cunning madman! Even in Dartmoor we get news, Mr. Hallick,
  and a rumour has reached me that some years ago three officers of Scotland
  Yard disappeared in the space of a few minutes&mdash;just vanished as though
  they had evaporated like dew before the morning sun! Forgive me if I am
  poetical; Dartmoor makes you that way. And would you be betraying an official
  secret if you told me these men were looking for O&rsquo;Shea?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He saw Hallick&rsquo;s face change, and chuckled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see they were. The story was that they had left England and they
  sent their resignations&mdash;from Paris, wasn&rsquo;t it? O&rsquo;Shea could
  copy anybody&rsquo;s handwriting&mdash;they never left England.&rdquo;
  Hallick&rsquo;s face was white.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By God, if I thought that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They never left England,&rdquo; said Marks remorselessly.
  &ldquo;They were looking for O&rsquo;Shea&mdash;and O&rsquo;Shea found them
  first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean they&rsquo;re dead?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>

  <p>Marks nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For twenty-two hours a day he is a sane, reasonable man. For two
  hours&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Mr. Hallick,
  your men must have met him in one of his bad moments.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When I meet him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; interrupted Connor, and Marks
  turned on him in a flash.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When you meet him you will die!&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;When
  <i>I</i> meet him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; That mild face of his became suddenly
  contorted, and Hallick looked into the eyes of a demon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When you meet him?&rdquo; challenged Hallick. &ldquo;Where will you
  meet him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Marks&rsquo; arm shot out stiffly; his long fingers gripped an invisible
  enemy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know just where I can put my hand on him,&rdquo; he breathed.
  &ldquo;That hand!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallick went back to London that afternoon, a baffled man. He had gone to
  make his last effort to secure information about the missing gold, and had
  learned nothing&mdash;except that O&rsquo;Shea was sane for twenty-two hours
  in the day.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a beautiful spring morning. There was a tang in the
air which
  melted in the yellow sunlight.</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman had not gone to the city that morning, though it was his day,
  for he made a practice of attending at his office for two or three days every
  month. Mrs. Elvery, that garrulous woman, was engaged in putting the final
  touches to her complexion; and Veronica, her gawkish daughter, was
  struggling, by the aid of a dictionary, with a recalcitrant poem&mdash;for
  she wooed the gentler muse in her own gentler moments.</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman sat on a sofa, dozing over his newspaper. No sound broke the
  silence but the scratching of Veronica&rsquo;s pen and the ticking of the big
  grandfather&rsquo;s clock.</p>

  <p>This vaulted chamber, which was the lounge of Monkshall, had changed very
  little since the days when it was the anteroom to a veritable refectory. The
  columns that monkish hands had chiselled had crumbled a little, but their
  chiselled piety, hidden now behind the oak panelling, was almost as legible
  as on the day the holy men had written them.</p>

  <p>Through the open French window there was a view of the broad, green park,
  with its clumps of trees and its little heap of ruins that had once been the
  Mecca of the antiquarian.</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman did not hear the excited chattering of the birds, but Miss
  Veronica, in that irritable frame of mind which a young poet can so readily
  reach, turned her head once or twice in mute protest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Goodman,&rdquo; she said softly.</p>

  <p>There was no answer, and she repeated his name impatiently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Goodman!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; He looked up, startled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What rhymes with &lsquo;supercilious?&rsquo;&rdquo; asked Veronica
  sweetly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman considered, stroking chin reflectively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bilious?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>

  <p>Miss Elvery gave a despairing cluck.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do at all. It&rsquo;s such an ugly
  word.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And such an ugly feeling,&rdquo; shuddered Mr. Goodman. Then:
  &ldquo;What are you writing?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>She confessed to her task.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; he said despairingly. &ldquo;Fancy writing
  poetry at this time in the morning! It&rsquo;s almost like drinking before
  lunch. Who is it about?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She favoured him with an arch smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m
  an awful cat if I tell you.&rdquo; And, as he reached out to take her
  manuscript: &ldquo;Oh, I really couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;it&rsquo;s about
  somebody you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman frowned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Supercilious&rsquo; was the word you used. Who on earth is
  supercilious?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Veronica sniffed&mdash;she always sniffed when she was being
  unpleasant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think she is&mdash;a little bit? After all, her
  father only keeps a boarding house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean Miss Redmayne?&rdquo; asked Goodman quietly. He put
  down his paper. &ldquo;A very nice girl. A boarding house, eh? Well, I was
  the first boarder her father ever had, and I&rsquo;ve never regarded this
  place as a boarding house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a silence,&rsquo;which the girl broke. &ldquo;Mr. Goodman, do
  you mind if I say something?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t objected so far, have I?&rdquo; he
  smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m naturally romantic,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
  see mystery in almost everything. Even you are mysterious.&rdquo; And, when
  he looked alarmed: &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean sinister!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was glad she did not.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But Colonel Redmayne is sinister,&rdquo; she said emphatically.</p>

  <p>He considered this.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He never struck me that way,&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he is,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;Why did he buy this place
miles
  from everywhere and turn it into a boarding house?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To make money, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled triumphantly and shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t. Mamma says that he must lose an awful lot of
  money. Monkshall is very beautiful, but it has got an awful reputation. You
  know that it is haunted, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed good-naturedly at this. Mr. Goodman was an old boarder and had
  heard this story before.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ve</i> heard things and seen things. Mamma says that
  there must have been a terrible crime committed here. It is!&rdquo; She was
  more emphatic..</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman thought that her mother let her mind dwell too much on murders
  and crimes. For the stout and fussy Mrs. Elvery wallowed in the latest
  tragedies which filled the columns of the Sunday newspapers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She <i>does</i> love a good murder,&rdquo; agreed Veronica.
  &ldquo;We had to put off our trip to Switzerland last year because of the
  River Bicycle Mystery. Do you think Colonel Redmayne ever committed a
  murder?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a perfectly awful thing to say!&rdquo; said her shocked
  audience.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why is he so nervous?&rdquo; asked Veronica intensely. &ldquo;What
  is he afraid of? He is always refusing boarders. He refused that nice young
  man who came yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got a new boarder coming to-morrow,&rdquo; said
  Goodman, finding his newspaper again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A parson!&rdquo; said Veronica contemptuously. &ldquo;Everybody
  knows that parsons have no money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He could chuckle at this innocent revelation of Veronica&rsquo;s mind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The colonel could make this place pay, but he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
  She grew confidential. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you something more. Mamma
  knew Colonel Redmayne before he bought this place. He got into terrible
  trouble over some money&mdash;Mamma doesn&rsquo;t exactly know what it was.
  But he had no money at all. How did he buy this house?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman beamed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now that I happen to know all about! He came into a
  legacy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Veronica was disappointed and made no effort to hide the fact. What
  comment she might have offered was silenced by the arrival of her mother.</p>

  <p>Not that Mrs. Elvery ever &ldquo;arrived.&rdquo; She bustled or exploded
  into a room, according to the measure of her exuberance. She came straight
  across to the settee where Mr. Goodman was unfolding his paper again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you hear anything last night?&rdquo; she asked
  dramatically.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Somebody in the next room to me was snoring like the devil,&rdquo;
  he began.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I occupy the next room to you, Mr. Goodman,&rdquo; said the lady
  icily. &ldquo;Did you hear a shriek?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shriek?&rdquo; He was startled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I heard the organ again last night!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Goodman sighed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fortunately I am a little deaf. I never hear any organs or shrieks.
  The only thing I can hear distinctly is the dinner gong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is a mystery here.&rdquo; Mrs. Elvery was even more intense
  than her daughter. &ldquo;I saw that the day I came. Originally I intended
  staying a week; now I remain here until the mystery is solved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He smiled good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a permanent fixture, Mrs. Elvery.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It rather reminds me,&rdquo; Mrs. Elvery recited rapidly, but with
  evident relish, &ldquo;of Pangleton Abbey, where John Roehampton cut the
  throats of his three nieces, aged respectively, nineteen, twenty-two and
  twenty-four, afterwards burying them in cement, for which crime he was
  executed at Exeter Gaol. He had to be supported to the scaffold, and left a
  full confession admitting his guilt!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman rose hastily to fly from the gruesome recital. Happily, rescue
  came in the shape of the tall, soldierly person of Colonel Redmayne. He was a
  man of fifty-five, rather nervous and absent of manner and address. His
  attire was careless and somewhat slovenly. Goodman had seen this carelessness
  of appearance grow from day to day.</p>

  <p>The colonel looked from one to the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-morning. Is everything all right?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Comparatively, I think,&rdquo; said Goodman with a smile. He hoped
  that Mrs. Elvery would find another topic of conversation, but she was not to
  be denied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Colonel, did you hear anything in the night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hear anything?&rdquo; he frowned. &ldquo;What was there to
  hear?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She ticked off the events of the night on her podge fingers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;First of all the organ, and then a most awful, blood-curdling
  shriek. It came from the grounds&mdash;from the direction of the Monk&rsquo;s
  Tomb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She waited, but he shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I heard nothing. I was asleep,&rdquo; he said in a low
  voice.</p>

  <p>Veronica, an interested listener, broke in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, what a fib! I saw your light burning long after Mamma and I
  heard the noise. I can see your room by looking out of my window.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He scowled at her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you? I went to sleep with the light on. Has any one seen
  Mary?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Goodman pointed across the park.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw her half an hour ago,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Colonel Redmayne stood hesitating, then, without a word, strode from the
  room, and they watched him crossing the park with long strides.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a mystery here!&rdquo; Mrs. Elvery drew a long
  breath. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad. Mr. Goodman, do you know that awfully
  nice-looking man who came yesterday morning? He wanted a room, and when I
  asked the colonel why he didn&rsquo;t let him stay he turned on me like a
  fiend! Said he was not the kind of man he wanted to have in the house; said
  he dared&mdash;&lsquo;dared&rsquo; was the word he used &mdash;to try to
  scrape acquaintance with his daughter, and that he didn&rsquo;t want any
  good-for-nothing drunkards under the same roof.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said Mr. Goodman, &ldquo;he was annoyed! You
  mustn&rsquo;t take the colonel too seriously&mdash;he&rsquo;s a little upset
  this morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took up the letters that had come to him by the morning post and began
  to open them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The airs he gives himself!&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;And his
  daughter is no better. I must say it, Mr. Goodman. It may sound awfully
  uncharitable, but she&rsquo;s got just as much&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swank?&rdquo; suggested Veronica, and her mother was shocked.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a common expression,&rdquo; said Veronica.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But we aren&rsquo;t common people,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Elvery,
  &ldquo;You may say that she gives herself airs. She certainly does. And her
  manners are deplorable. I was telling her the other day about the Grange Road
  murder. You remember, the man who poisoned his mother-in-law to get the
  insurance money&mdash;a most interesting case&mdash;when she simply turned
  her back on me and said she wasn&rsquo;t interested in horrors.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cotton, the butler, came in at that moment with the mail. He was a gloomy
  man who seldom spoke. He was leaving the room when Mrs. Elvery called him
  back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you hear any noise last night, Cotton?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He turned sourly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am. I don&rsquo;t get a long time to sleep&mdash;you
  couldn&rsquo;t wake me with a gun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear the organ?&rdquo; she insisted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never hear anything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think the man&rsquo;s a fool,&rdquo; said the exasperated
  lady.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think so too, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; agreed Cotton, and went
  out.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">MARY went to the village that morning to buy a week&rsquo;s
supply of
  stamps. She barely noticed the young man in plus fours who sat on a bench
  outside the Red Lion, though she was conscious of his presence; conscious,
  too, of the stories she had heard about him.</p>

  <p>She had ceased being sorry for him. He was the type of man, she decided,
  who had gone over the margin of redemption; and, besides, she was annoyed
  with him because he had irritated her father, for Mr. Ferdie Fane had had the
  temerity to apply for lodging at Monkshall.</p>

  <p>Until that morning she had never spoken to him, nor had she any idea that
  such a misfortune would overtake her, until she came back through the village
  and turned into the little lane whence ran a footpath across Monkshall
  Park.</p>

  <p>He was sitting on a stile, his long hands tightly clasped between his
  knees, a drooping cigarette in his mouth, gazing mournfully through his
  horn-rimmed spectacles into vacancy. She stood for a moment, thinking he had
  not seen her, and hesitating whether she should take a more round-about route
  in order to avoid him. At that moment he got down lazily, took off his cap
  with a flourish.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pass, friend; all&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>He had rather a delightful smile, she noticed, but at the moment she was
  far from being delighted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I accompany you to your ancestral home, does your revered father
  take a gun or loose a dog?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She faced him squarely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Mr. Fane, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He bowed; the gesture was a little extravagant, and she went hot at his
  impertinence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think in the circumstances, Mr. Fane, it is hardly the act of a
  gentleman to attempt to get into conversation with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It may not be the act of a gentleman, but it is the act of an
  intelligent human being who loves all that is lovely,&rdquo; he smiled.
  &ldquo;Have you ever noticed how few really pleasant-looking people there,
  are in the world? I once stood at the corner of a
street&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At present you&rsquo;re standing in my way,&rdquo; she interrupted
  him.</p>

  <p>She was not feeling at her best that morning; her nerves were tense and on
  edge. She had spent a night of terror, listening to strange whispers, to
  sounds that made her go cold, to that booming note of a distant organ which
  made her head tingle. Otherwise, she might have handled the situation more
  commandingly. And she had seen something, too&mdash;something she had never
  seen before; a wild, mouthing shape that had darted across the lawn under her
  window and had vanished.</p>

  <p>He was looking at her keenly, this man who swayed slightly on his
  feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does your father love you?&rdquo; he asked, in a gentle, caressing
  tone.</p>

  <p>She was too startled to answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If he does he can refuse you nothing, my dear Miss Redmayne. If you
  said to him, &lsquo;Here is a young man who requires board and
  lodging&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you let me pass, please?&rdquo; She was trembling with
  anger.</p>

  <p>Again he stepped aside with elaborate courtesy, and without a word she
  stepped over the stile, feeling singularly undignified. She was half-way
  across the park before she looked back. To her indignation, he was following,
  at a respectful distance, it was true, but undoubtedly following.</p>

  <p>Neither saw the other unwanted visitor. He had arrived soon after Mrs.
  Elvery and Goodman had gone out with their golf clubs to practise putting on
  the smooth lawn to the south of the house. He was a rough looking man, with a
  leather apron, and carried under his arm a number of broken umbrellas. He did
  not go to the kitchen, but after making a stealthy reconnaissance, had passed
  round to the lawn and was standing in the open doorway, watching Cotton as he
  gathered up the debris which the poetess had left behind.</p>

  <p>Cotton was suddenly aware of the newcomer and jerked his head round.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hallo, what do you want?&rdquo; he asked roughly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Got any umbrellas or chairs to mend &mdash;any old kettles or
  pans?&rdquo; asked the man mechanically.</p>

  <p>Cotton pointed in his lordliest manner. &ldquo;Outside! Who let you
  in?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The lodge-keeper said you wanted something mended,&rdquo; growled
  the tinker.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you come to the service door? Hop it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the man did not move.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who lives here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Colonel Redmayne, if you want to know&mdash;and the kitchen door is
  round the corner. Don&rsquo;t argue!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The tinker looked over the room with approval.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pretty snug place this, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Cotton&rsquo;s sallow face grew red.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand plain English? The kitchen door&rsquo;s
  round the corner. If you don&rsquo;t want to go there, push off!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Instead, the man came farther into the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How long has he been living here&mdash;this feller you call
  Redmayne?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ten years,&rdquo; said the exasperated butler. &ldquo;Is that all
  you want to know? You don&rsquo;t know how near to trouble you
  are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ten years, eh?&rdquo; The man nodded. &ldquo;I want to see this
  colonel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you an introduction to him,&rdquo; said Cotton
  sarcastically, &ldquo;He loves tinkers!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was then that Mary came in breathlessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you send that young man away?&rdquo; She pointed to the
  oncoming Ferdie; for the moment she did not see the tinker.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Young man, miss?&rdquo; Cotton went to the window, &ldquo;Why,
  it&rsquo;s the gent who came yesterday&mdash;a very nice young gentleman he
  is, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who he is or what he is,&rdquo; she said
  angrily. &ldquo;He is to be sent away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can I be of any help, miss?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was startled to see the tinker, and looked from him to the butler.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; snapped Cotton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked Mary.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just a tinker, miss.&rdquo; He was eyeing her thoughtfully, and
  something in his gaze frightened her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he came in here, and I told him to go to the
  kitchen,&rdquo; explained Cotton in a flurry. &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t come
  he&rsquo;d have been chucked out!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who he is&mdash;he must help you to get rid of
  this wretched young man,&rdquo; said Mary desperately.
  &ldquo;He&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She became suddenly dumb. Mr. Ferdinand Fane was surveying her from the
  open window.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, everybody? <i>Comment a va</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How dare you follow me?&rdquo; She stamped her foot in her fury,
  but he was unperturbed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You told me to keep out of your sight, so I walked behind.
  It&rsquo;s all perfectly clear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It would have been dignified to have left the room in silence&mdash;he had
  the curious faculty of compelling her to be undignified.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand that your presence is objectionable to
  me and to my father? We don&rsquo;t want you here. We don&rsquo;t wish to
  know you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know me.&rdquo; He was hurt.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you don&rsquo;t even know that my Christian name is
  Ferdie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve tried to force your acquaintance on me, and I&rsquo;ve
  told you plainly that I have no desire to know you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wan&rsquo; to stay here,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;Why
  shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need a room here&mdash;you have a room at the Red
  Lion, and it seems a very appropriate lodging.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was then that the watchful tinker took a hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look here, governor, this lady doesn&rsquo;t want you
  here&mdash;get out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he was ignored.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going back to the Red Lion,&rdquo; said Mr. Fane
  gravely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the beer&mdash;I can see through
  it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A hand dropped on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you going quietly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Fane looked round into the tinker&rsquo;s face.</p>

  <p>Don&rsquo;t do that, old boy&mdash;that&rsquo;s rude. Never be rude, old
  boy. The presence of a lady&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; began the tinker.</p>

  <p>And then a hand like a steel vice gripped his wrist; he was swung from his
  feet and fell to the floor with a crash.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ju-juishoo,&rdquo; said Mr. Fane very gently.</p>

  <p>He heard an angry exclamation and turned to face Colonel Redmayne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He heard his daughter&rsquo;s incoherent explanation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take that man to the kitchen,&rdquo; he said. When they were gone:
  &ldquo;Now, sir, what do you want?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her father&rsquo;s tone was milder than Mary had expected.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Food an&rsquo; comfort for man an&rsquo; beast,&rdquo; said the
  younger man coolly, and with an effort the colonel restrained his temper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stay here&mdash;I told you that yesterday.
  I&rsquo;ve no room for you, and I don&rsquo;t want you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded to the door, and Mary left hurriedly. Now his voice changed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d let you contaminate this house? A drunken
  beast without a sense of chivalry or decency&mdash;with nothing to do with
  his money but spend it in drink?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought you might,&rdquo; said Ferdie.</p>

  <p>A touch of the bell brought Cotton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Show this&mdash;gentleman out of the house&mdash;and well off the
  estate,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>It looked as though his visitor would prove truculent, but to his relief
  Mr. Fane obeyed, waving aside the butler&rsquo;s escort.</p>

  <p>He had left the house when a man stepped from the cover of a clump of
  bushes and barred his way. It was the tinker. For a few seconds they looked
  at one another in silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one man who could ever put that grip on me, and
  I want to have a look at you,&rdquo; said the tinker.</p>

  <p>He peered into the immobile face of Ferdie Fane, and then stepped
  back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;God! It is you! I haven&rsquo;t seen you for ten years, and I
  wouldn&rsquo;t have known you but for that grip!&rdquo; he breathed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wear very well.&rdquo; There was no slur in the voice of Fane
  now. Every sentence rang like steel. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen a great deal
  more than you ought to have seen, Mr. Connor!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of you!&rdquo; growled the man.
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to scare me. The old trick, eh? Made up like a boozy
  mug!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Connor, I&rsquo;m going to give you a chance for your life.&rdquo;
  Fane spoke slowly and deliberately. &ldquo;Get away from this place as
  quickly as you can. If you&rsquo;re here to-night, you&rsquo;re a dead
  man!&rdquo; Neither saw the girl who, from a window above, had
  watched&mdash;and heard.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">MRS. ELVERY described herself as an observant woman. Less
charitable
  people complained bitterly of her spying. Cotton disliked her most intensely
  for that reason, and had a special grievance by reason of the fact that she
  had surprised him that afternoon when he was deeply engaged in conversation
  with a certain tinker who had called that morning, and who now held him
  fascinated by stories of immense wealth that might be stored within the
  cellars and vaults of Monkshall.</p>

  <p>She came with her news to Colonel Redmayne, and found that gentleman a
  little dazed and certainly apathetic. He had got into the habit of retiring
  to his small study and locking the door. There was a cupboard there, just big
  enough for a bottle and two glasses, handy enough to hide them away when
  somebody knocked.</p>

  <p>He was not favourably disposed towards Mrs. Elvery, and this may have been
  the reason why he gave such scant attention to her story.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s like a bear, my dear,&rdquo; said that good lady to her
  daughter.</p>

  <p>She pulled aside the blind nervously and peered out into the dark
  grounds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sure we&rsquo;re going to have a visitation to-night,&rdquo;
  she said. &ldquo;I told Mr. Goodman so. He said &lsquo;Stuff and
  nonsense!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish to heaven you wouldn&rsquo;t do that, mother,&rdquo; snapped
  the girl. &ldquo;You give me the jumps.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mrs. Elvery looked in the glass and patted her hair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it twice,&rdquo; she said, with a certain uneasy
  complacency.</p>

  <p>Veronica shivered.</p>

  <p>For a little while Mrs. Elvery said nothing, then, turning dramatically,
  she lifted her fat forefinger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cotton!&rdquo; she said mysteriously. &ldquo;If that butler&rsquo;s
  a butler, I&rsquo;ve never seen a butler.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Veronica stared at her aghast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good lord, Ma, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been snooping around all day. I caught him coming up
  those stairs from the cellars, and when he saw me he was so taken aback he
  didn&rsquo;t know whether he was on his head or his heels.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you know he didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; asked the practical
  Veronica, and Mrs. Elvery&rsquo;s testy reply was perhaps justifiable.</p>

  <p>Veronica looked at her mother thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What <i>did</i> you see, mother&mdash;when you squealed the other
  night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish to goodness you wouldn&rsquo;t say
  &lsquo;squeal,&rsquo;&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Elvery. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a
  word you should use to your mother. I screamed&mdash;so would you have. There
  it was, running about the lawn, waving its hands&mdash;ugh!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Veronica faintly.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Elvery turned round in her chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A monk,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;all black; his face hidden behind a
  cowl or something. Hark at that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was a night of wind and rain, and the rattle of the lattice had made
  Mrs. Elvery jump.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go downstairs for heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; she
  said.</p>

  <p>The cheerful Mr. Goodman was alone when they reached the lounge, and he
  gave a little groan at the sight of her and hoped that she had not heard
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Goodman&rdquo;&mdash;he was not prepared for Veronica&rsquo;s
  attack&mdash;&ldquo;did mother tell you what she saw?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Goodman looked over his glasses with a pained expression.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to talk about ghosts&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Monks!&rdquo; said Veronica, in a hollow voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One monk,&rdquo; corrected Mrs. Elvery. &ldquo;I never said I saw
  more than one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Goodman&rsquo;s eyebrows rose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A monk?&rdquo; He began to laugh softly, and, rising from the
  settee which formed his invariable resting place, he walked across the room
  and tapped at the panelled wall. &ldquo;If it was a monk, this is the way he
  should come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mrs. Elvery stared at him open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is the monk&rsquo;s door,&rdquo; explained Mr. Goodman with
  some relish. &ldquo;It is part of the original panelling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mrs. Elvery fixed her glasses and looked. She saw now that what she had
  thought was part of the panelling was indeed a door. The oak was warped and
  in places worm-eaten.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is the way the old monks came in,&rdquo; said Mr. Goodman.
  &ldquo;The legend is that it communicated with an underground chapel which
  was used in the days of the Reformation. This lounge was the lobby that
  opened on to the refectory. Of course, it&rsquo;s all been
  altered&mdash;probably the old passage to the monks&rsquo; chapel has been
  bricked up. The monks used to pass through that chapel every day, two by
  two&mdash;part of their ritual, I suppose, to remind them that life was a
  very short business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Veronica drew a deep breath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the whole I prefer to talk about mother&rsquo;s murders,&rdquo;
  she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A chapel,&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Elvery intensely. &ldquo;That would
  explain the organ, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Goodman shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing explains the organ,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Rich foods, poor
  digestion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then, to change the subject:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You told me that that young man, Fane, was coming here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mrs. Elvery emphatically.
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too interesting. They don&rsquo;t want anybody here but old
  fogies,&rdquo; and, as he smiled, she added hastily: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  mean you, Mr. Goodman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She heard the door open and looked round. It was Mary Redmayne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We were talking about Mr. Fane,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Were you?&rdquo; said Mary, a little coldly. &ldquo;It must have
  been a very dismal conversation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All kind of conversation languished after that. The evening seemed an
  interminable time before the three guests of the house said good-night and
  went to bed. Her father had not put in an appearance all the evening. He had
  been sitting behind the locked door of his study. She waited till the last
  guest had gone and then went and knocked at the door. She heard the cupboard
  close before the door unlocked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-night, my dear,&rdquo; he said thickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want to talk to you, father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He threw out his arms with a weary gesture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m all nerves
  to-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She closed the door behind her and came to where he was sitting, resting
  her hand upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Daddy, can&rsquo;t we get away from this place? Can&rsquo;t you
  sell it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He did not look up, but mumbled something about it being dull for her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t more dull than it was at School,&rdquo; she said;
  &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;she shivered &mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s awful I
  There&rsquo;s something vile about this place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He did not meet her eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Father, you know that there&rsquo;s something horrible. No, no, it
  isn&rsquo;t my nerves. I heard it last night&mdash;first the organ and then
  that scream!&rdquo; She covered her face with her hands. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
  bear it! I saw him running across the lawn&mdash;a terrifying thing in black.
  Mrs. Elvery heard it too&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He saw her start and her face go white. She was listening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you hear?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the wind,&rdquo; he said hoarsely; &ldquo;nothing but
  the wind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Even he must have heard the faint, low tones of an organ as they rose and
  fell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can your hear?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hear nothing,&rdquo; he said stolidly.</p>

  <p>She bent towards the floor and listened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you hear?&rdquo; she asked again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The sound of feet shuffling on stones, and&mdash;my God,
  what&rsquo;s that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was the sound of knocking, heavy and persistent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Somebody is at the door,&rdquo; she whispered, white to the
  lips.</p>

  <p>Redmayne opened a drawer and took out something which he slipped into the
  pocket of his dressing-gown.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go up to your room,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>He passed through the darkened lounge, stopped to switch on a light, and,
  as he did so, Cotton appeared from the servants&rsquo; quarters. He was fully
  dressed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Redmayne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some one at the door, I think. Shall I open it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a second the colonel hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said at last.</p>

  <p>Cotton took off the chain, and, turning the key, jerked the door open. A
  lank figure stood on the doorstep; a figure that swayed uneasily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry to disturb you.&rdquo; Ferdie Fane, his coat drenched and
  soaking, lurched into the room. He stared from one to the other.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the second visitor you&rsquo;ve had to-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked Redmayne.</p>

  <p>In a queer, indefinable way the sight of this contemptible man gave him a
  certain amount of relief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve turned me out of the Red Lion.&rdquo; Ferdie&rsquo;s
  glassy eyes were fixed on him. &ldquo;I want to stay here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let him stay, daddie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Redmayne turned; it was the girl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please let him stay. He can sleep in number seven.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A slow smile dawned on Mr. Fane&rsquo;s good-looking face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks for invitation,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which is
  accepted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him in wonder. The rain had soaked his coat, and, as he
  stood, the drops were dripping from it, forming pools on the floor. He must
  have been out in the storm for hours&mdash;where had he been? And he was
  strangely un-talkative; allowed himself to be led away by Cotton to room No.
  7, which was in the farther wing. Mary&rsquo;s own pretty little bedroom was
  above the lounge. After taking leave of her father, she locked and bolted the
  door of her room, slowly undressed and went to bed. Her mind was too much
  alive to make sleep possible, and she turned from side to side
  restlessly.</p>

  <p>She was dozing off when she heard a sound and sat up in bed. The wind was
  shrieking round the corners of the house, the patter of the rain came
  fitfully against her window, but that had not wakened her up. It was the
  sound of low voices in the room below. She thought she heard Cotton&mdash;or
  was it her father? They both had the same deep tone.</p>

  <p>Then she heard a sound which made her blood freeze&mdash;a maniacal burst
  of laughter from the room below. For a second she sat paralysed, and then,
  springing out of bed, she seized her dressing-gown and went pattering down
  the stairs, and she saw over the banisters a figure moving in the hall
  below.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was her father. His room adjoined his study on the ground floor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you hear anything, daddy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing,&rdquo; he said harshly, &ldquo;Go to
  bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Mary Redmayne was not deficient in courage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not go to bed,&rdquo; she said, and came down the stairs.
  &ldquo;There was somebody in the lounge&mdash;I heard them,&rdquo; Her hand
  was on the lounge door when he gripped her arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Mary, don&rsquo;t go in!&rdquo; She shook him
  off impatiently, and threw open the door.</p>

  <p>No light burned; she reached out for the switch and turned it. For a
  second she saw nothing, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>Sprawling in the middle of the room lay the body of a man, a terrifying
  grin on his dead face.</p>

  <p>It was the tinker, the man who had quarrelled with Ferdie Fane that
  morning the man whom Fane had threatened!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">SUPERINTENDENT HALLICK came down by car with his
photographer and
  assistants, saw the body with the local chief of police, and instantly
  recognised the dead man.</p>

  <p>Connor! Connor, the convict, who said he would follow O&rsquo;Shea to the
  end of the world&mdash;dead, with his neck broken, in that neat way which was
  O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s speciality.</p>

  <p>One by one Hallick interviewed the guests and the servants. Cotton was
  voluble; he remembered the man, but had no idea how he came into the room.
  The doors were locked and barred, none of the windows had been forced.
  Goodman apparently was a heavy sleeper and lived in the distant wing. Mrs.
  Elvery was full of theories and clues, but singularly deficient in
  information.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fane&mdash;who is Fane?&rdquo; asked Hallick.</p>

  <p>Cotton explained Mr. Fane&rsquo;s peculiar position and the hour of his
  arrival.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see him later. You have another guest on the
  books?&rdquo; He turned the pages of the visitors&rsquo; ledger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t come till to-day. He&rsquo;s a parson, sir,&rdquo;
  said Cotton.</p>

  <p>Hallick scrutinised the ill-favoured face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have I seen you before?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not me, sir.&rdquo; Cotton was pardonably agitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Hallick. &ldquo;That will do. I&rsquo;ll see
  Miss Redmayne.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Goodman was in the room and now came forward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope you are not going to bother Miss Redmayne, superintendent.
  She is an extremely nice girl&mdash;I may say I am&mdash;fond of her. If I
  were a younger man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;You see, even tea
  merchants have their romances.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And detectives,&rdquo; said Hallick dryly. He looked at Mr. Goodman
  with a new interest. He had betrayed from this middle-aged man a romance
  which none suspected. Goodman was in love with the girl and had probably
  concealed the fact from everybody in the house.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you think I am a sentimental
  jackass&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallick shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Being in love isn&rsquo;t a crime, Mr. Goodman,&rdquo; he said
  quietly.</p>

  <p>Goodman pursed his lips thoughtfully. &ldquo;I suppose it
  isn&rsquo;t&mdash;imbecility isn&rsquo;t a crime, anyway,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>He was going in the direction whence Mary would come, when Hallick stopped
  him, and obediently the favoured guest shuffled out of another door.</p>

  <p>Mary had been waiting for the summons, and her heart was cold within her
  as she followed the detective to Hallick&rsquo;s presence. She had not seen
  him before and was agreeably surprised. She had expected a hectoring,
  bullying police officer and found a very stout and genial man with a kindly
  face. He was talking to Cotton when she came in, and for a moment he took no
  notice of her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;ve no idea how this man got in last
  night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Cotton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No window was forced, the door was locked and bolted, wasn&rsquo;t
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cotton nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never let him in,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Hallick&rsquo;s eyelids narrowed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Twice you&rsquo;ve said that. When I arrived this morning you
  volunteered the same statement. You also said you passed Mr. Fane&rsquo;s
  room on your way in, that the door was open and the room was
  empty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cotton nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You also said that the man who rung up the police and gave the name
  of Cotton was not you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was then that the detective became aware of the girl&rsquo;s presence
  and signalled Cotton to leave the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Redmayne; you didn&rsquo;t see this man, I
  suppose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only for a moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you recognise him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>Hallick looked down at the floor, considering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where do you sleep?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the room above this hall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was aware that the second detective was writing down all that she
  said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must have heard something&mdash;the sound of a struggle&mdash;a
  cry?&rdquo; suggested Hallick, and, when she shook her head: &ldquo;Do you
  know what time the murder occurred?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My father said it was about one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were in bed? Where was your father&mdash;anywhere near this
  room?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Her tone was emphatic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why are you so sure?&rdquo; he asked keenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because when I heard the door close&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which door?&rdquo; quickly.</p>

  <p>He confused her for a moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This door.&rdquo; She pointed to the entrance of the lounge.
  &ldquo;Then I looked over the landing and saw my father in the
  passage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. He was coming from or going to this room. How was he
  dressed?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; she answered desperately.
  &ldquo;There was no light in the passage. I&rsquo;m not even certain that it
  was his door.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallick smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get rattled, Miss Redmayne. This man, Connor, was a
  well-known burglar; it is quite possible that your father might have tackled
  him and accidentally killed him. I mean, such a thing might occur.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mary shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that happened? You don&rsquo;t think
  that he got frightened when he found the man was dead, and said he knew
  nothing about it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You heard nothing last night of a terrifying or startling
  nature?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She did not answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen anything at Monkshall?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was all imagination,&rdquo; she said in a low voice; &ldquo;but
  once I thought I saw a figure on the lawn&mdash;a figure in the robes of a
  monk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A ghost, in fact?&rdquo; he smiled, and she nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m rather nervous,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I
  imagine things. Sometimes when I&rsquo;ve been in my room I&rsquo;ve heard
  the sound of feet moving here&mdash;and the sound of an organ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does the noise seem distinct?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. You see, the floor isn&rsquo;t very thick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said dryly. &ldquo;And yet you heard no struggle
  last night? Come, come, Miss Redmayne, try to remember.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was in a panic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember anything&mdash;I heard nothing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing at all?&rdquo; He was gently insistent. &ldquo;I mean, the
  man must have fallen with a terrific thud. It would have wakened you if you
  had been asleep&mdash;and you weren&rsquo;t asleep. Come now, Miss Redmayne.
  I think you&rsquo;re making a mystery of nothing. You were terribly
  frightened by this monk you saw, or thought you saw, and your nerves were all
  jagged. You heard a sound and opened your door, and your father&rsquo;s voice
  said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; or something like that. Isn&rsquo;t
  that what occurred?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was so kindly that she was deceived. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was in his dressing-gown, I suppose&mdash;ready for
  bed?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said again.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just now you told me you didn&rsquo;t see him&mdash;that there was
  no light in the passage!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sprang up and confronted him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to catch me out. I won&rsquo;t answer you. I
  heard nothing, I saw nothing. My father was never in this room&mdash;it
  wasn&rsquo;t his voice&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My voice, old son!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallick turned quickly. A smiling man was standing in the doorway.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do? My name&rsquo;s Fane&mdash;Ferdie Fane.
  How&rsquo;s the late departed?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fane, eh?&rdquo; Hallick was interested in this lank man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My voice, old son,&rdquo; said Fane again.
  &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; Then the detective did an unaccountable thing. He broke
  off the cross-examination, and, beckoning his assistant, the two men went out
  of the room together.</p>

  <p>Mary stared at the new boarder wonderingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was not your voice,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why did you say it
  was? Can&rsquo;t you see that they are suspecting everybody? Are you mad?
  They will think you and I are in collusion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He beamed at her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;lusion&rsquo;s a good word. I can say that quite
  distinctly, but it&rsquo;s a good word.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She went to the door and looked out. Hallick and his assistant were in
  earnest consultation on the lawn, and her heart sank.</p>

  <p>He was helping himself to a whisky when she returned to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll come back soon, and then what questions will they ask
  me? Oh, I wish you were somebody I could talk to, somebody I could ask to
  help! It&rsquo;s so horrible to see a man like you&mdash;a drunken
  weakling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me names,&rdquo; he said severely. &ldquo;You
  ought to be ashamed of yourself. Tell me anything you like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>If only she could!</p>

  <p>It was Cotton who interrupted her confidence. He came in that sly, furtive
  way of his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The new boarder&rsquo;s arrived, miss&mdash;the parson
  gentleman,&rdquo; he said, and stood aside to allow the newcomer to enter the
  lounge.</p>

  <p>It was a slim and aged clergyman, white-haired, bespectacled. His tone was
  gentle, a little unctuous perhaps; his manner that of a man who lavished
  friendliness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have I the pleasure of speaking to dear Miss Redmayne? I am the
  Reverend Ernest Partridge. I&rsquo;ve had to walk up. I thought I was to be
  met at the station.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He gave her a limp hand to shake.</p>

  <p>The last thing in the world she craved at that moment was the distraction
  of a new boarder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, Mr. Partridge&mdash;we are all
  rather upset this morning. Cotton, take the bag to number three.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Partridge was mildly shocked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Upset? I hope that no untoward incident has marred the perfect
  beauty of this wonderful spot?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My father will tell you all about it. This is Mr. Fane.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She had to force herself to this act of common politeness.</p>

  <p>At this moment Hallick came in hurriedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you any actors in the grounds, Miss Redmayne?&rdquo; he asked
  quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Actors?&rdquo; She stared at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anybody dressed up.&rdquo; He was impatient. &ldquo;Film
  actors&mdash;they come to these old places. My man tells me he&rsquo;s just
  seen a man in a black habit come out of the monk&rsquo;s tomb&mdash;he had a
  rifle in his hand. By God, there he is!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pointed through the lawn window, and at that moment Mary felt a pair of
  strong arms clasped about her, and she was swung round. It was Fane who held
  her, and she struggled, speechless with indignation. And
  then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>&ldquo;Ping!&rdquo;</i></p>

  <p>The staccato crack of a rifle, and a bullet zipped past her and smashed
  the mirror above the fireplace. So close it came that she thought at first it
  had struck her, and in that fractional space of time realised that only
  Ferdinand Fane&rsquo;s embrace had saved her life.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">HALLICK, after an extensive search of the grounds which
produced no other
  clue than an expended cartridge case, went up to town, leaving Sergeant Dobie
  in charge.</p>

  <p>Mary never distinctly remembered how that dreadful day dragged to its end.
  The presence of the Scotland Yard man in the house gave her a little
  confidence, though it seemed to irritate her father. Happily, the detective
  kept himself unobtrusively in the background.</p>

  <p>The two people who seemed unaffected by the drama of the morning were Mr.
  Fane and the new clerical boarder. He was a loquacious man, primed with all
  kinds of uninteresting anecdotes; but Mrs. Elvery found him a fascinating
  relief.</p>

  <p>Ferdie Fane puzzled Mary. There was so much about him that she liked, and,
  but for this horrid tippling practice of his she might have liked him
  more&mdash;how much more she did not dare admit to herself. He alone remained
  completely unperturbed by that shot which had nearly ended her life and
  his.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon she had a little talk with him and found him singularly
  coherent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shooting at me? Good Lord, no!&rdquo; He scoffed. &ldquo;It must
  have been a Nonconformist&mdash;we high church parsons have all sorts of
  enemies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; she asked quietly, and there was an odd look in
  his eyes when he answered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe. There are quite a number of people who want to get even with
  me for my past misdeeds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Elvery said they were going to send Bradley down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bradley!&rdquo; he said contemptuously. &ldquo;That back number at
  Scotland Yard!&rdquo; And then, as though he could read her thoughts, he
  asked quickly: &ldquo;Did that interesting old lady say anything
  else?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They were walking through the long avenue of elms that stretched down to
  the main gates of the park. Two days ago she would have fled from him, but
  now she found a strange comfort in his society. She could not understand
  herself; found it equally difficult to recover a sense of her old
  aversion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Elvery&rsquo;s a criminologist.&rdquo; She smiled whimsically,
  though she never felt less like smiling in her life. &ldquo;She keeps press
  cuttings of all the horrors of the past years, and she says she&rsquo;s sure
  that that poor man Connor was connected with a big gold robbery during the
  war. She said there was a man named O&rsquo;Shea in
  it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;Shea?&rdquo; said Fane quickly, and she saw his face
  change. &ldquo;What the devil is she talking about O&rsquo;Shea for? She had
  better be careful&mdash;I beg your pardon.&rdquo; He was all smiles
  again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you heard of him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The merest rumour,&rdquo; he said almost gaily. &ldquo;Tell me what
  Mrs. Elvery said.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She said that a lot of gold disappeared and was buried somewhere,
  and she&rsquo;s got a theory that it was buried in Monkshall or in the
  grounds; that Connor was looking for it, and that he got Cotton, the butler,
  to let him in&mdash;that&rsquo;s how he came to be in the house. I heard her
  telling Mr. Partridge the story. She doesn&rsquo;t like me well enough to
  tell me.&rdquo; They paced in silence for a while.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you like him&mdash;Partridge, I mean?&rdquo; asked Ferdie.</p>

  <p>She thought he was very nice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That means he bores you.&rdquo; He chuckled softly to himself. And
  then: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go up to town?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stopped dead and stared at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leave Monkshall? Why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her steadily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Monkshall is very healthy; in fact, it&rsquo;s
  a little dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To me?&rdquo; she said incredulously, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To you, in spite of the fact that there are people living at
  Monkshall who adore you, who would probably give their own lives to save you
  from hurt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean my father?&rdquo; She tried to pass off what might easily
  develop into an embarrassing conversation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean two people&mdash;for example, Mr. Goodman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At first she was inclined to be angry and then she laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How absurd! Mr. Goodman is old enough to be my father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And young enough to love you,&rdquo; said Fane quietly. &ldquo;That
  middle-aged gentleman is genuinely fond of you, Miss Redmayne. There is one
  who is not so middle-aged who is equally fond of you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In sober moments?&rdquo; she challenged.</p>

  <p>And then Mary thought it expedient to remember an engagement she had in
  the house. He did not attempt to stop her. They walked back towards Monkshall
  a little more quickly.</p>

  <p>Inspector Hallick went back to London a very puzzled man, though he was
  not as hopelessly baffled as his immediate subordinates thought. He was
  satisfied in his mind that behind the mystery of Monkshall was the more
  definite mystery of O&rsquo;Shea.</p>

  <p>When he reached his office he rang for his clerk, and when the officer
  appeared:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get me the record of the O&rsquo;Shea gold robbery, will
  you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And data of any kind we have about
  O&rsquo;Shea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was not the first time he had made the last request and the response
  had been more or less valueless, but the Record Department of Scotland Yard
  had a trick of securing new evidence from day to day from unexpected sources.
  The sordid life histories that were compiled in that business-like room
  touched life at many points; the political branch that dealt with foreign
  anarchists had once exposed the biggest plot of modern times through a chance
  remark made by an old woman arrested for begging.</p>

  <p>When the clerk had gone Hallick opened his note-book and jotted down the
  meagre facts he had compiled. Undoubtedly the shot had been fired from the
  ruins which, he discovered, were those of an old chapel in the grounds, now
  covered with ivy and almost hidden by sturdy chestnut trees. How the assassin
  had made his escape was a mystery. He did not preclude the possibility that
  some of these wizened slabs of stone hidden under thickets of alderberry and
  hawthorn trees might conceal the entrance to an underground passage.</p>

  <p>He offered that solution to one of the inspectors who strolled in to
  gossip. It was the famous Inspector Elk, saturnine and sceptical.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Underground passages!&rdquo; scoffed Elk. &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s
  the last resource, or resort&mdash;I am not certain which&mdash;of the novel
  writer. Underground passages and secret panels! I never pick up a book which
  isn&rsquo;t full of &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rule out either possibility,&rdquo; said Hallick
  quietly. &ldquo;Monkshall was one of the oldest inhabited buildings in
  England. I looked it up in the library. It flourished even in the days of
  Elizabeth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Elk groaned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That woman! There&rsquo;s nothing we didn&rsquo;t have in her
  days!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Inspector Elk had a genuine grievance against Queen Elizabeth; for years
  he had sought to pass an education test which would have secured him
  promotion, but always it was the reign of the virgin queen and the many
  unrememberable incidents which, from his point of view, disfigured that
  reign, that had brought about his undoing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She would have secret panels, <i>and</i> underground
  passages!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then a thought struck Hallick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sit down, Elk,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want to ask you
  something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s history save yourself the trouble. I know no more
  about that woman except that she was not in any way a virgin. Whoever started
  this silly idea about the Virgin Queen?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you ever met O&rsquo;Shea?&rdquo; asked Hallick.</p>

  <p>Elk stared at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;Shea&mdash;the bank smasher? No, I never met him. He is in
  America, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think he is very much in England,&rdquo; said Hallick, and the
  other man shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I doubt it.&rdquo; Then after a moment&rsquo;s thought:
  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why he should be in England. I am only going
  on the fact that he has been very quiet these years, but then a man who made
  the money he did can afford to sit quiet. As a rule, a crook who gets money
  takes it to the nearest spieling club and does it in, and as he is a natural
  lunatic&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; asked Hallick sharply.</p>

  <p>Before he answered, Elk took a ragged cigar from his pocket and lit
  it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;Shea is a madman,&rdquo; he said deliberately. &ldquo;It is
  one of the facts that is not disputed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One of the facts that I knew nothing about till I interviewed old
  Connor in prison, and I don&rsquo;t remember that I put it on record,&rdquo;
  said Hallick. &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Elk had an explanation which was new to his superior.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I went into the case years ago. We could never get O&rsquo;Shea or
  any particulars about him except a scrap of his writing. I am talking about
  the days before the gold robbery and before you came into the case. I was
  just a plain detective officer at the time and if I couldn&rsquo;t get his
  picture and his finger-prints I got on to his family. His father died in a
  lunatic asylum, his sister committed suicide, his grandfather was a homicide
  who died whilst he was awaiting his trial for murder. I&rsquo;ve often
  wondered why one of these clever fellows didn&rsquo;t write a history of the
  family.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was indeed news to John Hallick, but it tallied with the information
  that. Connor had given to him.</p>

  <p>The clerk came back at this moment with a formidable dossier and one thin
  folder. The contents of the latter showed the inspector that nothing further
  had been added to the sketchy details he had read before concerning
  O&rsquo;Shea. Elk watched him curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Refreshing your mind about the gold robbery? Doesn&rsquo;t it make
  your mouth water to think that all these golden sovereigns are hidden
  somewhere. Pity Bradley isn&rsquo;t on this job. He knows the case like I
  know the back of my hand, and if you think this murder has got anything to do
  with O&rsquo;Shea, I&rsquo;d cable him to come back if I were you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallick was turning the pages of the type-written sheets slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As far as Connor is concerned, he only got what was coming to him.
  He squealed a lot at the time of his conviction about being double-crossed,
  but Connor double-crossed more crooks than any man on the records, and Soapy
  Marks. I happened to know both of them. They were quite prepared to squeak
  about O&rsquo;Shea just before the gold robbery. Where is Soapy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallick shook his head and closed the folder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I wish you would put the word round to the
  divisions that I&rsquo;d like to see Soapy Marks,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
  usually hangs out in Hammersmith, and I should like to give him a word of
  warning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Elk grinned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t warn Soapy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He knows too
  much. Soapy is so clever that one of these days we&rsquo;ll find him at
  Oxford or Cambridge. Personally,&rdquo; he ruminated reflectively, &ldquo;I
  prefer clever crooks. They don&rsquo;t take much catching; they catch
  themselves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not worrying about his catching himself,&rdquo; said Hallick.
  &ldquo;But I am a little anxious as to whether O&rsquo;Shea will catch him
  first. That is by no means outside the bounds of possibility.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And here he spoke prophetically.</p>

  <p>He got through by &rsquo;phone to Monkshall, but Sergeant Dobie, who had
  been left in charge, had no information.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has that woman, Elvery, left?&rdquo; asked Hallick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not she!&rdquo; came the reply. &ldquo;She will hang on to the last
  minute. That woman is a regular crime hound. And, Mr. Hallick, that fellow
  Fane is tight again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is he ever sober?&rdquo; asked Hallick.</p>

  <p>He did not trouble about Fane&rsquo;s insobriety, but he was interested to
  learn that life in Monkshall, despite the tragedy and the startling event of
  the morning, was going on as though nothing had happened. Reporters had
  called in the course of the day and had tried to interview the colonel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I shunted them off. The general theory here is that Connor had
  somebody with him, that they got hold of the money and quarrelled about it.
  The other fellow killed Connor and got away with the stuff. When I said
  &lsquo;The general idea,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Dobie carefully, &ldquo;I meant
  it is my idea. What do you think of that, sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rotten,&rdquo; said Hallick, and hung up the receiver.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">ALL the machinery of Scotland Yard was at work. Inquiries
had gone out in
  every direction and not even Mrs. Elvery and her daughter had been spared. By
  midnight Hallick learned the private history, as far as it could be
  ascertained, of every inmate of Monkshall.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Elvery was a woman in fairly comfortable circumstances, and, since
  her husband&rsquo;s death had released her from a gloomy house in Devonshire,
  she had no permanent home. She was more than comfortably off, by certain
  standards she was a wealthy woman, one of that mysterious band of middle-aged
  women who move from one hotel to another, and live frugally in fashionable
  resorts in the season. You find them on the Lido in August, in Deauville in
  July, on the Riviera or in Egypt in the winter.</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman held a sleeping partnership in an old-established and not too
  prosperous firm of tea importers. Probably, thought Hallick, the days of its
  prosperity expired before Goodman retired from business.</p>

  <p>Cotton, the butler, had the least savoury record. He was a man who had
  been discharged from three jobs under suspicion of pilfering, but no
  conviction could be traced against him. (Hallick wrote in his note-book:
  &ldquo;Find some way of getting Cotton&rsquo;s finger-prints.&rdquo;) In
  every case Cotton had been employed at boarding houses and always small
  articles of jewellery had disappeared in circumstances which suggested that
  he was not entirely ignorant of the reason for such disappearance.</p>

  <p>Colonel Redmayne&rsquo;s record occupied a sheet of foolscap. He had been
  an impecunious officer in the Auxiliary Medical Staff, had been
  court-martialed in the last week of the war for drunkenness and severely
  reprimanded. He had, by some miracle, been appointed to a responsible
  position in a military charity. The disappearance of funds had led to an
  investigation, there had been some talk of prosecution, and Scotland Yard had
  actually been consulted, but had been advised against such a prosecution in
  the absence of direct proof that the colonel was guilty of anything but
  culpable negligence. The missing money had been refunded and the matter was
  dropped. He was next heard of when he bought Monkshall.</p>

  <p>The information concerning Redmayne&rsquo;s military career was news to
  Hallick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A doctor, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Elk nodded. He had been charged with collecting the information.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He joined up in the beginning of the war and got his rank towards
  the finish,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Funny how these birds hang on to their
  military rank&mdash;&lsquo;doctor&rsquo; would be good enough for
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was he ever in the regular army?&rdquo; Elk shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So far as I could find out, no. Owing to the trouble he got into at
  the end of the war he was not offered a permanent commission.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallick spent the evening studying a large plan of Monkshall and its
  grounds, and even a larger one of the room in which Connor had been found.
  There was one thing certain: Connor had not &ldquo;broken and entered.&rdquo;
  It was, in a sense, an inside job, he must have been admitted by&mdash;whom?
  Not by Redmayne, certainly not by his daughter. By a servant, and that
  servant was Cotton. The house was almost impossible to burgle from outside
  without inside assistance; there were alarms in all the windows and he had
  seen electric controls on the doors. Monkshall was almost prepared for a
  siege. Indeed, it seemed as though Colonel Redmayne expected sooner or later
  the visitation of a burglar.</p>

  <p>Hallick went to bed a very tired man that night, fully expecting to be
  called by telephone, but nothing happened. He &rsquo;phoned Monkshall before
  he left his house and Dobie reported &ldquo;All is well.&rdquo; He had not
  been to bed that night, and nothing untoward had occurred. There was neither
  sound or sight of the ghostly visitor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ghosts!&rdquo; scoffed Hallick. &ldquo;Did you expect to see
  one?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dobie&rsquo;s half-apologetic voice, &ldquo;I am
  really beginning to believe there is something here that isn&rsquo;t quite
  natural.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is nothing anywhere that is not natural, sergeant,&rdquo;
  said Hallick sharply.</p>

  <p>There was another case in which he was engaged, and he spent two
  unprofitable hours interviewing a particularly stupid servant girl concerning
  the mysterious disappearance of a large quantity of jewellery. It was nearly
  noon when he got back to his office and his clerk greeted him with a piece of
  unexpected information.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Goodman is waiting to see you, sir. I put him in the reception
  room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Goodman?&rdquo; Hallick frowned. At the moment he could not recall
  the name. &ldquo;Oh, yes, from Monkshall? What does he want?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He said he wished to see you. He was quite willing to
  wait.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring him in,&rdquo; said Hallick.</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman came into the tidy office a rather timid and diffident
  man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I quite expected you to throw me out for I realise how busy you
  are, inspector,&rdquo; he said, putting down his hat and umbrella very
  carefully; &ldquo;but as I had some business in town I thought I&rsquo;d come
  along and see you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am very glad to see you, Mr. Goodman,&rdquo; Hallick placed a
  chair for him. &ldquo;Are you coming to enlarge on your theories?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Goodman smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think I told you before I had no theories. I am terribly worried
  about Miss Redmayne, though.&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;You cross-examined
  her. She was distressed about it.&rdquo; He paused a little helplessly, but
  Hallick did not help him. &ldquo;I think I told you that I am&mdash;fond of
  Mary Redmayne. I would do anything to clear up this matter so that you would
  see, what I am sure is a fact, that her father had nothing whatever to do
  with this terrible affair.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never said he had,&rdquo; interrupted Hallick.</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I realise. But I am not as foolish as, perhaps, I appear to
  be; I know that he is under suspicion, in fact, I imagine that everybody in
  the house, including myself, must of necessity be suspected.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again he waited and again Hallick was wilfully silent. He was wondering
  what was coming next.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a fairly wealthy man,&rdquo; Goodman went on at last. He gave
  the impression that it required a desperate effort on his part to put his
  proposition into words. &ldquo;And I would be quite willing to spend a very
  considerable sum, not necessarily to help the police, but to clear Redmayne
  from all suspicion. I don&rsquo;t understand the methods of Scotland Yard and
  I feel I needn&rsquo;t tell you this&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled&mdash;&ldquo;and
  probably I am exposing my ignorance with every word I utter. But what I came
  to see you about is this&mdash;is it possible for me to engage a Scotland
  Yard detective?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallick shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you mean in the same way as you engage a private
  detective&mdash;no,&rdquo; he said. Goodman&rsquo;s face fell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity. I had heard so much from Mrs. Elvery&mdash;a
  very loquacious and trying lady, but with an extraordinary knowledge
  of&mdash;er&mdash;criminality, that there is a gentleman at Scotland Yard who
  would have been of the greatest assistance to me&mdash;Inspector
  Bradley.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallick laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Inspector Bradley is at the moment abroad,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Mr. Goodman, getting glum. &ldquo;That is a
  great pity. Mrs. Elvery says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid she says a great deal that is not very helpful,&rdquo;
  said Hallick good-humouredly. &ldquo;No, Mr. Goodman, it is impossible to
  oblige you and I am afraid you will have to leave the matter in our hands. I
  don&rsquo;t think you will be a loser by that. We have no other desire than
  to get the truth. We are just as anxious to clear any person who is
  wrongfully suspected, as we are to convict any person who comes under
  suspicion and who justifies that suspicion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That should have finished the matter, but Mr. Goodman sat on looking very
  embarrassed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a thousand pities,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Mr. Bradley
  is abroad? So I shan&rsquo;t be able even to satisfy my curiosity. You see,
  Mr. Hallick, the lady in question was talking so much about this
  superman&mdash;I suppose he is clever?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Hallick. &ldquo;One of the ablest men we have had
  at the Yard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo; Goodman nodded. &ldquo;That makes my disappointment a
  little more keen. I would have liked to have seen what he looked like. When
  one hears so much about a person&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallick looked at him for a second, then turning his back upon the
  visitor, he scanned the wall where were hanging three framed portrait groups.
  One of these he lifted down from the hook and laid on the table. It was a
  conventional group of about thirty men sitting or standing in three rows and
  beneath were the words &ldquo;H.Q. Staff.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can satisfy your curiosity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The fourth man
  on the left from the commissioner who is seated in the centre is Inspector
  Bradley.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman adjusted his glasses and looked. He saw a large,
  florid-looking man of fifty, heavy-featured, heavily built. The last person
  in the group he would have picked out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Bradley; he isn&rsquo;t much to look at, is he?&rdquo;
  smiled Hallick. &ldquo;He is the livest wire in this department.&rdquo;
  Goodman stared at the photograph rather nervously, and then he smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good of you, Mr. Hallick,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look like a detective, but then no detective ever
  does. That is the peculiar thing about them. They look
  rather&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A commonplace lot, eh?&rdquo; said Hallick, his eyes twinkling.
  &ldquo;So they are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He hung up the portrait on the wall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about Miss Redmayne,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
  for heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t think that the employment of a detective,
  private or public, on her behalf will be of the slightest use to her or her
  father. Innocent people have nothing to fear. Guilty people have a great
  deal. You have known Colonel Redmayne for a long time, I think?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All my life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know about his past?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old tea merchant hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I know,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;There were one
  or two incidents which were a little discreditable, were there not? He told
  me himself. He drinks a great deal too much, which is unfortunate. I think he
  was drinking more heavily at the time these unfortunate incidents
  occurred.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He picked up his hat and umbrella, took out his pipe with a mechanical
  gesture, looked at it, rubbed the bowl, and replaced it hastily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can smoke, Mr. Goodman, we shan&rsquo;t hang you for it,&rdquo;
  chuckled Hallick.</p>

  <p>He himself walked through the long corridor and down the stairs to the
  entrance hall with his visitor, and saw him off the premises. He hoped and
  believed that he had sent Goodman away feeling a little happier, and his hope
  was not without reason.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was four o&rsquo;clock when Goodman reached the little
station which is
  some four miles distant from Monkshall, and, declining the offer of the
  solitary fly, started to walk across to the village. He had gone a mile when
  he heard the whir of a motor behind him. He did not attempt to turn his head,
  and was surprised when he heard the car slacken speed and a voice hailing
  him. It was Ferdie Fane who sat at the wheel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hop in, brother. Why waste your own shoe leather when somebody
  else&rsquo;s rubber tyres are available?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The face was flushed and the eyes behind the horn-rimmed spectacles
  glistened. Mr. Goodman feared the worst.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no, thank you. I&rsquo;d rather walk,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stuff! Get in,&rdquo; scoffed Ferdie. &ldquo;I am a better driver
  when I am tight than when I am sober, but I am not tight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Very reluctantly the tea merchant climbed into the seat beside the
  driver.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go very slowly,&rdquo; the new inmate of Monkshall went
  on. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You think I am afraid?&rdquo; said Mr. Goodman with a certain
  asperity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain,&rdquo; said the other cheerfully. &ldquo;Where
  have you been this fine day?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I went up to London,&rdquo; said Mr. Goodman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An interesting place to go to,&rdquo; said Fane; &ldquo;but a
  deuced uncomfortable place to live in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was keeping his word and driving with remarkable care, Mr. Goodman
  discovered to his relief.</p>

  <p>He was puzzled as to where Ferdie had obtained the car and ventured upon
  an inquiry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hired it from a brigand in the village,&rdquo; said Ferdie.
  &ldquo;Do you drive a car?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is an easy road for a car, but a pretty poisonous one for a
  lorry, especially a lorry with a lot of weight in it. You know Lark
  Hill?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A lorry was stuck there. I guess it will be there still even though
  the road is as dry as a bone. What it must be like to run up that hill with a
  heavy load on a wet and slippery night heaven knows. I bet that hill has
  broken more hearts than any other in the county.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He rumbled on aimlessly about nothing until they reached the foot of the
  redoubtable hill where the heavy lorry was still standing disconsolate by the
  side of the road.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There she is,&rdquo; said Ferdie with the satisfaction of one who
  is responsible. &ldquo;And it will take a bit of haulage to get her to the
  top, eh? Only a super-driver could have got her there. Only a man with a
  brain and imagination could have nursed her.&ldquo;</p>

  <p>Goodman smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there were such things as super-brains&rsquo;
  amongst lorry drivers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I suppose every trade,
  however humble, has its Napoleon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; said Ferdie.</p>

  <p>He brought the car up the long drive to Monkshall, paid the garage hand
  who was waiting to take it from him, and disappeared into the house.</p>

  <p>Goodman looked round. In spite of his age his eyesight was remarkably
  good, and he noticed the slim figure walking on the far side of the ruins.
  Handing his umbrella to Cotton he walked across to Mary. She recognised and
  turned to meet him. Her father was in his study and she was going back for
  tea. He thought that she looked a little peaked and paler than usual.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing has happened to-day?&rdquo; he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing. Mr. Goodman, I am dreading the night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He patted her gently on the shoulder. &ldquo;My dear, you ought to get
  away out of this. I will speak to the colonel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;Father does not
  want me to go. My nerves are a little on edge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has that young man been&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no. You mean Mr. Fane? He has been quite nice. I have only seen
  him for a few minutes to-day. He is out driving a motor car. He asked
  me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stopped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To go with him? That young man is certainly not troubled with
  nerves!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was quite nice,&rdquo; she said quickly; &ldquo;only I
  didn&rsquo;t feel like motoring. I thought it was he who had just come back,
  but I suppose it was you who came in the car.&rdquo; He explained the
  circumstances of his meeting with Ferdie Fane. She smiled for the first time
  that day.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is&mdash;rather queer,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Sometimes he is
quite
  sensible and nice. Cotton hates him for some reason or other. He told me
  to-day that unless Mr. Fane left he would.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You seem to have a very troublesome household,&rdquo; he said;
  &ldquo;except myself&mdash;oh, I beg his pardon, the new guest. What is his
  name? Mr. Partridge? I hope he is behaving himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s quite charming. I don&rsquo;t think I have seen him
  to-day,&rdquo; she added inconsequently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can see him now.&rdquo; Mr. Goodman nodded towards the
  lawn.</p>

  <p>The slim, black figure of Mr. Partridge was not easily discernible against
  the dark background of the foliage. He was strolling slowly up and down,
  reading a book as he walked; but evidently his eyes and attention were not
  entirely for the literature which he studied, for he closed his book and
  walked towards them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A delightful place, my dear Miss Redmayne,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;A most charming place! A little heaven upon earth, if I may use a
  sacred expression to describe terrestrial beauties.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In the light of day, and without the softening effect of curtains, his
  face was not too pleasant, she thought. It was a hard face, angular, wasted.
  The dark eyes which surveyed her were not his least unpleasant feature. His
  voice was gentle enough&mdash;gentle to the point of unctuousness.
  Instinctively she had disliked him the first time they had met; her second
  impression of him did not help her to overcome her prejudice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw you come up. Mr. Fane was driving you.&rdquo; There was a
  gentle reproach in his tone. &ldquo;A curious young man, Mr.
  Fane&mdash;given, I fear, to the inordinate consumption of alcoholic
  beverage. &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; as the prophet said, &lsquo;that a man should put
  an enemy into his mouth to steal away his brains!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can testify,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Goodman staunchly,
  &ldquo;that Mr. Fane is perfectly sober. He drove me with the greatest care
  and skill. I think he is a very excitable young man, and one may often do him
  an injustice because of his peculiar mannerisms.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The reverend gentleman sniffed. He was obviously no lover of Fane, and
  sceptical of his virtues. Yet he might find no fault with Ferdie, who came
  into the lounge soon after tea was served, and would have sat alone if
  Goodman had not invited him to the little circle which included himself, Mrs.
  Elvery and Mary. He was unusually quiet, and though many opportunities
  presented themselves he was neither flippant nor aggressive.</p>

  <p>Mary watched him furtively, more than interested in the normal man. He was
  older than she had thought; her father had made the same discovery. There was
  a touch of grey in his hair, and though the face was unlined it had the
  setness of a man who was well past his thirties, and possibly his
  forties.</p>

  <p>His voice was deep, rather brusque. She thought she detected signs of
  nervousness, for once or twice, when he was addressed, he started so
  violently as to spill from the cup of tea which he held in his hand.</p>

  <p>She saw him after the party had dispersed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very
  subdued today, Mr. Fane.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; He made an attempt at gaiety and failed.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny, parsons always depress me. I suppose my conscience
  gets to work, and there&rsquo;s nothing more depressing than
  conscience.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What have you been doing all day?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>She told herself she was not really interested. The question was one of
  the commonplaces of speech that she had employed a dozen times with
  guests.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ghost-hunting,&rdquo; he said, and when he saw her pale he was
  instantly penitent. &ldquo;Sorry&mdash;terribly sorry! I was being
  funny.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he had been very much in earnest; she realised that when she was in
  the privacy of her own room, where she could think without distraction.
  Ferdie Fane had spent that day looking for the Terror. Was he himself the
  Terror? That she could not believe.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">NIGHT came&mdash;the dreary night with its black mysteries
and its
  suggestive horrors.</p>

  <p>The telephone in the deserted lounge rang shrilly. Cotton came from some
  mysterious recess in a hurry to answer it. He heard Hallick&rsquo;s voice and
  winced painfully. He did not like Hallick, and wondered how soon this officer
  of Scotland Yard, with the resources at his disposal, would discover his own
  unsavoury antecedents.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want to speak to Dobie,&rdquo; said Hallick&rsquo;s voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I&rsquo;ll call him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was no need to call Sergeant Dobie; he was at Cotton&rsquo;s
  elbow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that for me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cotton passed him across the instrument.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir...?&rdquo; He glanced out of the corner of his eye and
  saw the interested Cotton. &ldquo;Hop it,&rdquo; he said under his breath,
  and Cotton withdrew reluctantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you found anything further?&rdquo; asked Hallick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir. Another spent cartridge&mdash;you saw one of them
  before you left.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a long pause at the other end of the wire, and then Hallick
  spoke again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea something may happen to-night. You have my
  private telephone number? . . . Good! Call me if anything happens that has an
  unusual appearance. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of bringing me down on a
  fool&rsquo;s errand. I shall have a car waiting, and I can be with you in an
  hour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dobie hung up the receiver as Mr. Goodman came ambling into the lounge. He
  wore his black velvet smoking jacket; his old pipe was gripped between his
  teeth. Dobie was on his way to the door when the tea merchant called him
  back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re staying with us to-night, aren&rsquo;t you, Mr. Dobie?
  . . . Thank goodness for that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nervous, are you, sir?&rdquo; smiled Dobie, and
  Goodman&rsquo;s good-natured face reflected the smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I am a little&mdash;raw. If anybody had told me I should
  get jumpy I should have laughed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took out his cigar case and offered it to the detective, who chose one
  with considerable care.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no new clue, I suppose?&rdquo; said Goodman, making
  himself comfortable at the end of the settee.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Dobie.</p>

  <p>Goodman chuckled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you had any you wouldn&rsquo;t tell me, eh? That isn&rsquo;t one
  of the peculiar weaknesses of Scotland Yard officers, that they wear
  their&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say hearts, but their brains, upon their sleeves.
  You didn&rsquo;t find the gentleman who did the shooting yesterday? I ask you
  because I have been in town all day, and was a little disappointed when I
  came back to find that apparently nothing had happened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t found the shooter,&rdquo; said Dobie.</p>

  <p>Neither of them saw the door open, nor the pale face of Mr. Partridge
  peeping through.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was at Scotland Yard to-day,&rdquo; said Goodman; &ldquo;and I
  had a chat with Mr. Hallick. A nice man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; agreed Dobie heartily.</p>

  <p>John Hallick was one of the few men at the Yard who had no enemies amongst
  his subordinate staff. He was the type who placed the service first, and
  individual kudos second, so that it was a tradition that any officer who
  deserved praise invariably received his full meed of recognition.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The whole thing is really extraordinary,&rdquo; said Goodman
  thoughtfully; &ldquo;in fact, the most extraordinary thing that has ever
  happened. Do you know, I am developing a theory?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dobie paused in the act of lighting his cigar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re like Mrs. Elvery,&rdquo; he said, and Goodman
  groaned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the rudest thing that&rsquo;s been said to me to-day!
  No, it is about this unfortunate man, Connor, who was found dead in this room
  yesterday morning. The moment I heard the name I remembered the
  case&mdash;the gold robbery during the war. There were three men in
  it&mdash;O&rsquo;Shea, the gang leader; a man named Marks&mdash;Soapy Marks;
  and Connor. I wouldn&rsquo;t like to confess as much to Mrs. Elvery for fear
  she never left me to myself, but I was tremendously interested in war crimes,
  and I am pretty sure that this dead man was Connor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think so, sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I am perfectly sure now, from your badly simulated innocence!
  That was the Connor, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you ask Mr. Hallick?&rdquo; asked Dobie, and, when the other
  shook his head: &ldquo;Well, Scotland Yard is issuing a statement to-night,
  so you might as well know that it was Connor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; Goodman frowned. &ldquo;I am trying to reckon up
  how long he was in prison. He must have been released very
  recently?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A month ago,&rdquo; said Dobie. &ldquo;He and Marks came out within
  a few hours of each other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman was beaming.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew that I was right! I&rsquo;ve got rather a good memory for
  names.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dobie lingered. There was nothing for him to do, but he had a human
  weakness for human society.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re not staying on after to-night?&rdquo; he
  suggested. &ldquo;All these boarding house murders clear out the tenants and
  generally ruin the man or woman who&rsquo;s running the show.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Goodman shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m an old bachelor and I hate change. I
  suppose I must be a little callous, but I am not as affected as some of the
  other people are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then he went back to his original thesis.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, suppose this crime is in connection with the gold
  robbery&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But here he came across the official policeman. It was not a matter which
  Dobie could discuss, and he said so.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;perfectly correct,&rdquo; said Goodman hurriedly.
  &ldquo;I am sorry I was so indiscreet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Dobie, and Goodman saw that he was
  aching to tell him all he knew. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re nearer the truth
  than you imagine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whatever revelation he might have made after that was interrupted by the
  arrival of Mrs. Elvery and her daughter. The Rev. Mr. Partridge followed,
  carrying in his hand a skein of wool.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Elvery at any rate was not so reticent. She was trembling with
  excitement, had information to give to the bored tea merchant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give you a surprise, Mr. Goodman,&rdquo; she
  said, and Goodman closed his book with an expression of resignation.
  &ldquo;Do you know that Mr. Partridge is an authority on
  spiritualism?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I am an authority on good coffee,&rdquo; said Mr. Goodman.
  Cotton had come in with a tray full of little cups, and Goodman selected one.
  &ldquo;And if this coffee is good you can thank me, for I have taught the
  cook, after many years, how to prepare coffee that doesn&rsquo;t taste like
  dish-water. Spiritualism, eh? B-r-r! I don&rsquo;t want to know anything
  about spirits!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Partridge was all apologies.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You rather exaggerate, I fear, my dear friend. Do you mind my
  saying that? I certainly have studied the science from an outsider&rsquo;s
  point of view, but I am no authority.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t object to a few spooks?&rdquo; said Goodman,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Spooks?&rdquo; The reverend gentleman was puzzled. &ldquo;Ah, you
  mean&mdash;thank you, Cotton.&rdquo; He took his coffee. &ldquo;I know what
  you mean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mary came in at this uncomfortable moment, when Mr. Partridge chose to
  discuss the tragedy of the previous day.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How terrible it must have been for all you poor souls! How
  staggering! How&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mary was looking at the girl, saw her suddenly stare towards the window
  and turn pale. Veronica leapt to her feet and screamed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw a face at the window!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Draw the curtains,&rdquo; said Mr. Goodman testily.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later Fane strolled into the room, and Mary saw there were
  raindrops on his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you been out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been strolling around,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Mary thought he had been drinking; his speech was slurred and he walked
  none too steadily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you see the monk?&rdquo; asked Veronica spitefully.</p>

  <p>Ferdie smiled broadly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I had I&rsquo;d have called his reverence to lay the
  ghost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Partridge looked up, reproach in his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is all very dreadful. I only heard by accident of the tragedy
  that occurred here last night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about it, please!&rdquo; wailed Veronica.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fellow creature cut off in his prime,&rdquo; said the Reverend
  Partridge sonorously. &ldquo;I confess that I had a cold shiver run through
  me when I heard of this awful happening. The man&rsquo;s name is not known, I
  understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was reaching for a cup of coffee.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it is.&rdquo; It was Fane who spoke. &ldquo;I wonder
  somebody didn&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Their eyes met.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The name of the murdered man,&rdquo; said Fane deliberately,
  &ldquo;was Connor&mdash;Joe Connor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The coffee cup slipped from the parson&rsquo;s hand and was shattered on
  the parquet floor. The yellow face turned a dirty white.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Connor!&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;Joe Connor!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ferdie, watching him, nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know the name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I have heard it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Partridge was talking with difficulty; he was a little breathless.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Joe Connor!&rdquo; he muttered again, and soon after went out of
  the room.</p>

  <p>Mary noticed this and was puzzled. She wondered if Goodman had seen, but
  apparently he was unobservant, and he was more interested in another inmate
  of Monkshall. The first moment they were together he opened his heart on the
  subject.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may not believe me, my dear, but Mrs. Elvery has been very
  interesting to-night. She showed me her press-cutting book&mdash;about this
  man Connor. There is no doubt it was he&mdash;I saw a picture in one of the
  cuttings. And I saw another photograph which rather interested me&mdash;had
  you ever met Mr. Fane before he came here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was it his?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I think it was.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then she remembered. She had been in the village that afternoon and
  had seen Goodman at the post office, in the little private telephone booth,
  and the postmistress had volunteered the information, rather proudly, that he
  was speaking to Scotland Yard. She had thought no more of this than that
  Goodman was getting further details about the crime of last night, and she
  realised that his call had a deeper significance when he went on:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have been making a few inquiries, and I think there is no doubt
  that Mr. Fane is&mdash;um&mdash;well, Mr. Fane is not all that he appears to
  be.&rdquo; And then, earnestly: &ldquo;I beg of you not to mention this to
  him in any circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was amazed by his vehemence, and laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, of course I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mary&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced over his shoulder&mdash;the rest of
  the company were engaged in their own affairs, and he dropped his hand
  timidly upon hers&mdash;&ldquo;Mary, my dear, why don&rsquo;t you leave this
  place&mdash; go to London?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How curious!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;That is exactly what Mr.
  Fane suggested.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Fane made the suggestion for another reason,&rdquo; he said,
  with a touch of grimness in his usually mild voice. &ldquo;I suggest it
  because&mdash;well, because I am very fond of you. Don&rsquo;t think
  I&rsquo;m stupid or sentimental. In spite of the disparity in our ages, I
  love you as I have never loved any woman in my life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was unprepared for the declaration, could only look at him
  wonderingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Think it over, my dear; and if you say &lsquo;No&rsquo;&mdash;well,
  I shall understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was glad when Cotton came in at that moment and told her her father
  wished to see her about some domestic trifle. She did not go back to the room
  until Cotton came to the study with the request that he should be allowed to
  lock up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all in bed except Mr. Fane,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea he&rsquo;s waiting for you, miss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why should he be?&rdquo; demanded Redmayne wrathfully.</p>

  <p>Cotton did not know.</p>

  <p>It was a shrewd guess on his part. Ferdie Fane sat on the sofa, hoping
  against hope that the girl would return. There was something he wanted to
  tell her, an urgent message of warning he wished to give to her. He heard the
  door click and turned quickly. It was the Reverend Mr. Partridge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said the clergyman, who seemed to have recovered
  something of his equilibrium; &ldquo;I left a book here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fane did not speak until the white-haired man was turning to leave the
  room. Then:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were awfully rattled, Mr. Partridge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rattled?&rdquo; The parson frowned. &ldquo;That is a strange term
  to employ. I was naturally distressed to hear of this poor man&rsquo;s
  death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fane grinned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cotton was more distressed&mdash;he had to pick up the pieces of
  your coffee cup,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will you sit down for a
  second?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The clergyman hesitated, and then sat down on the settee by Ferdie&rsquo;s
  side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a terrible fate&mdash;poor soul!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silly&mdash;that was what was the matter with Connor,&rdquo; said
  Fane coolly. &ldquo;You see, he wasn&rsquo;t as clever as his pal&mdash;the
  other fellow wouldn&rsquo;t have been so crude.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The other fellow?&rdquo; Mr. Partridge appeared to be puzzled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Soapy Marks&mdash;you&rsquo;ve never heard of him?
  O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s right-hand man. You&rsquo;ve never heard of
  O&rsquo;Shea? I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;ve not only heard of him, but if you
  haven&rsquo;t recognised him you&rsquo;ll know him pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The other man shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is Greek to me. Whom am I to recognise?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Soapy&rsquo;s got brains,&rdquo; Fane went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  going to give them a chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly he reached out, gripped the white hair of the clergyman and
  pulled. The wig came away in his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Soapy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Soapy Marks leapt up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What the hell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, but the face of Fane
  thrust into his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go whilst the going&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; he said deliberately.
  &ldquo;Go whilst there&rsquo;s life in you. I&rsquo;m telling you, as I told
  Connor. You&rsquo;re asking for death&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll get
  it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; said Marks savagely.
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what! I&rsquo;ll take anything that&rsquo;s
  going.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ferdie Fane nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You never could take a warning, could you? Clever Mr.
  Soapy&mdash;all brain and confidence!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t frighten me.&rdquo; Marks was breathing heavily.
  &ldquo;You know what I&rsquo;ve come for? My share of the swag&mdash;and
  I&rsquo;m not going away till I get it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going out feet first,&rdquo; said Fane sombrely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am, am I? You think you&rsquo;re damned clever, but I&rsquo;ll
  tell you something. I knew you the moment you told me about Connor. And
  there&rsquo;s somebody else in this house who knows you&mdash;that guy
  Goodman. He&rsquo;s no fool&mdash;he&rsquo;s knocked about the world. I saw
  him looking at you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fane was startled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Goodman? You&rsquo;re crazy mad!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mad, am I? I was down in the village this afternoon, and he was
  putting calls through to London&mdash;making inquiries about you. That girl,
  Redmayne, was in the post office too. That&rsquo;s made you sit up.
  What&rsquo;ll you do now, my dear friend? Get Goodman out of the way. I know
  your methods&mdash;I know that old drunk trick of yours too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fane had recovered from his consternation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whether he knows or whether he doesn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m warning
  you,&rdquo; he said sternly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go the way of
  Connor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Marks moved to the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair warning. The man that gets me has got to be
  quick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In another second he passed through the curtains which hid the long French
  windows. Fane heard the click of them as the man opened them and stepped into
  the night.</p>

  <p>Fane waited some time; he heard a step outside in the hall and slipped out
  through a door which would bring him to the lawn by another route.</p>

  <p>He saw the door open slowly. It was Mr. Goodman. He came in, grumbling to
  himself, looking from table to table for his pipe. Presently he found it. He
  put it in his pocket and was walking slowly back to the door when he saw
  something on the ground, and, stopping, picked it up. It was the wig that
  Marks had dropped in his flight. He looked at this for a long time, and then,
  conscious of the draught which came through the open French windows, moved
  towards the closed curtains.</p>

  <p>His hand was on the point of drawing them back when two hands shot out,
  gripped him by the throat and drew him into the alcove.</p>

  <p>Mary was half undressed when she heard the struggle below; heard the cry
  of a man in pain, and, pulling on her gown, fled down the stairs. She pushed
  open the door of the hall; it was in darkness, as it had been the night
  before.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said a voice, and the lights came on
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>Ferdie Fane was standing by the window, his coat and hair dishevelled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Goodman!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;I heard his
  voice&mdash;where is he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>And then she saw the smear of blood across the white expanse of his shirt
  front. ... As she fell fainting to the ground he caught her in his arms and
  the blood of a murdered man stained her kimono.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was half-past two in the morning, and Monkshall was
awake. The
  mud-stained car of Hallick&rsquo;s stood at the door; the carpets were rolled
  up, in the search for hidden traps; and Mrs. Elvery, in a pink dressing-gown,
  dozed and snored in the most comfortable arm-chair. There Hallick found
  her when he came in from a search of the grounds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take my advice and go to bed,&rdquo; he said, shaking her to
  wakefulness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mrs. Elvery blinked herself awake and began to cry softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor Mr. Goodman! He was such a nice man, and there are so few
  bachelors left!&rdquo; she wailed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even know that he&rsquo;s dead yet,&rdquo; snapped
  Hallick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was blood all over the floor,&rdquo; she whimpered.
  &ldquo;And that nice Mr. Partridge&mdash;have you found him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That nice Mr. Partridge,&rdquo; said Mr. Hallick irritably,
  &ldquo;is on his way to London. You needn&rsquo;t worry about him; he&rsquo;s
  an old lag, and his name is Soapy Marks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly Mrs. Elvery became galvanised to life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you questioned Cotton? He&rsquo;s been behaving very strangely
  this evening. Twice he&rsquo;s been down to the cellar, and when he came up
  the last time his knees were covered with dust&mdash;and do you know
  why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know why,&rdquo; said the weary Hallick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s searching for the gold that&rsquo;s hidden in this
  house. Ah, that makes you jump, Mr. Inspector.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Superintendent,&rdquo; said Hallick coldly. &ldquo;The gold in this
  house, eh? So you&rsquo;ve got that O&rsquo;Shea story, have you? Where did
  you get it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Out of my press cuttings,&rdquo; said Elvery triumphantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you kindly go to bed?&rdquo; snapped Hallick, and succeeded in
  hustling her from the room.</p>

  <p>His assistant, Sergeant Dobie, had a theory that needed a little
  investigation, and now that they were alone for a minute Dobie stated his
  views.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Redmayne? Nonsense! Why should he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was going to tell you, sir. Redmayne is broke;
  he borrowed all his money from Goodman. The first thing he did after the
  disappearance of Goodman was to go up into the old man&rsquo;s room, open a
  box and take out a promissory note. Here it is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallick examined the slip of paper thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get Redmayne here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The colonel almost staggered into the room. His nerve was gone, he was the
  wreck of the man he had been.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want to ask you a few questions,&rdquo; said Hallick brusquely,
  and Redmayne scowled at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of answering questions,&rdquo; he snapped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you are,&rdquo; said the other sarcastically.
  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a ghost in Monkshall.&rdquo; He produced the promissory
  note and held it out for the colonel to see. &ldquo;Is that the secret of all
  the queer happenings in this house? Is that the real explanation of the
  Terror?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was money I borrowed,&rdquo; said Redmayne in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Hallick nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ten years ago you were the secretary of a military fund. There was
  an audit and a large sum was missing. You were almost on the point of being
  arrested when you found the money&mdash;you borrowed it from
  Goodman?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An hour or two ago you were searching Goodman&rsquo;s papers. Was
  it to find this?&rdquo; asked the detective sternly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I refuse to be cross-examined by you,&rdquo; said Redmayne, with
  something of his old spirit. &ldquo;You have no right to question me as to my
  private affairs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hallick shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Colonel Redmayne,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;last night a man
  was murdered in your house; to-night a gentleman has disappeared in
  circumstances which suggest murder. I have every right to question you. I
  have even the right of arresting you, if I wish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then arrest me.&rdquo; The colonel&rsquo;s voice quavered. .</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want you to realise the position you are in. There is somebody in
  this house whom no man has seen&mdash;somebody you are sheltering!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; The shaft had struck home.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am suggesting,&rdquo; Hallick went on, &ldquo;that this loan of
  yours from Goodman was a blind; that at the time you borrowed it you had
  command of immense sums of money; that you bought this house to protect a
  desperate criminal wanted by the police&mdash;Leonard
  O&rsquo;Shea!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; said the other hoarsely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you another,&rdquo; retorted Hallick.
  &ldquo;Somewhere in this house there is hidden hundreds of thousands of
  pounds in gold, the proceeds of the Aritania robbery; somewhere in these
  underground rooms of yours is a man half-sane, half-mad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The colonel cringed back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did my best to keep him away. Do you think I wanted him
  here&mdash;where my daughter is . . .&rdquo; he whined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the truth about this,&rdquo; said Hallick.</p>

  <p>He signalled to Dobie, who led the unresisting man to his study. Hallick
  followed, and, as the door closed behind them, Mr. Ferdinand Fane came
  through the closed curtains. He had changed his clothes and was wearing a
  golfing suit.</p>

  <p>Going back to the window, he called softly and Mary came out of the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The coast is clear,&rdquo; he said extravagantly, &ldquo;and nobody
  need ever know that you have committed the indiscretion of walking in the
  dark with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She pulled off her raincoat and dropped wearily into a chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is part of the night&rsquo;s madness,&rdquo; she said;
  &ldquo;and yet I felt safer there than in the house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never feel safe anywhere,&rdquo; said Ferdie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  going to sleep in this room to-night&mdash;where&rsquo;s Cotton?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A drink,&rdquo; he said, and rang the bell. Cotton came in so
  quickly that he might have been standing outside the door. His coat was wet,
  his boots muddy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; Fane eyed him keenly. &ldquo;Why have you been
  sneaking about the grounds, my young friend?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just looking round, sir. There&rsquo;s no harm in that, is
  there?&rdquo; the man&rsquo;s voice was hollow and tremulous.</p>

  <p>Then Mary remembered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cotton, you have been with the detectives. What do they
  say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fane laughed softly, and she interpreted his scorn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want to know,&rdquo; she said impatiently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what they say.&rdquo; He stared at her.
  &ldquo;They think Mr. Goodman&rsquo;s dead&mdash;somewhere in this
  room.&rdquo; He leered at her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer idea, ain&rsquo;t
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shuddered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And they think that old parson&rsquo;s dead too,&rdquo; he went on
  with relish. &ldquo;I heard Dobie telling the superintendent that the parson
  must have come into the room when the fight was goin&rsquo; on and that the
  Terror killed &rsquo;em both!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Terror?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call him. They say he goes mad two hours
  every day. That&rsquo;s a queer thing to happen, ain&rsquo;t it, miss? Fancy
  havin&rsquo; a lunatic around, and nobody knows who he is. It might be you,
  sir&mdash;it might be me&mdash;it might be me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Most likely you, I should think,&rdquo; said Fane sharply.
  &ldquo;Cotton, bring me a pint of champagne.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you had enough to-night?&rdquo; pleaded Mary.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She waited till Cotton was out of the room, then:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Fane, what happened to Mr. Goodman?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He made no attempt to answer her until Cotton had brought the wine and
  gone away again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This really is champagne,&rdquo; he said as he poured out the
  foaming liquor. &ldquo;Gosh, I&rsquo;ve got a headache.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d have such a headache that you&rsquo;d never
  drink again,&rdquo; she said passionately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In other words, you wish I were dead?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>

  <p>He was disappointing her terribly; she had thought that in a time like
  this he would have been a help.</p>

  <p>And then a thought struck her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;this really is champagne?&rsquo;&rdquo;
  she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean that this is the first drink of wine I&rsquo;ve had for a
  week,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me any more about my
  habits&mdash;I&rsquo;m a modest man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Was he serious? Was this drunkenness of his affected?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What happened to-night when I found you in this room?&rdquo; she
  asked. &ldquo;When that terrible fight was going on?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Some feller hit me in the jaw. I began to feel
  that I wasn&rsquo;t amongst friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then suddenly he became unexpectedly embarrassed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, would you really like me to&mdash;sort of&mdash;well, you
  know, look after you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; she said. And yet she knew
  well enough.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean, to be around when you want somebody to protect
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had come closer to her, but he did not touch her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;re in a fit state to protect anybody?&rdquo;
  she asked, and knew that she was begging the question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know, Mary, that I&rsquo;d do a tremendous lot for
  you? You see, Mary&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Must you call me Mary?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unless your name&rsquo;s Jemima. You can call me Ferdie if you
  like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like&mdash;not at the moment,&rdquo; she said, a
  little out of breath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did Goodman tell you he was awfully keen on you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor Mr. Goodman! Yes, he was very fond of me, and I liked him
  too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked round suddenly and he saw her face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;ve got a horrible feeling that
  somebody is listening. I wish that man would come,&rdquo; she added
  inconsequently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Expecting somebody?&rdquo; He was surprised.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, another detective&mdash;Mrs. Elvery calls him the great
  Bradley. He is coming to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor old blighter!&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use
  of bringing in a feller like that? I&rsquo;m as good as a thousand
  detectives. I&rsquo;m as good as O&rsquo;Shea.&rdquo; He laughed.
  &ldquo;O&rsquo;Shea! There&rsquo;s a lad!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stepped back from him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of O&rsquo;Shea,&rdquo; she said slowly.
  &ldquo;What does he look like?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Something like me&mdash;only not so good looking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded and her voice sank to a whisper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know too well who O&rsquo;Shea is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The accusation took him aback.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yesterday, when you spoke to that man Connor, I was at the window
  and I heard you threaten him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was silent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I warned him,&rdquo; he said at last.</p>

  <p>As though to put an end to the conversation he wheeled an easy-chair until
  it faced the panelled wall, and dragged forward a screen which he placed at
  its back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sleep,&rdquo; was the laconic answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why do you put the chair there?&rdquo; she asked in
  amazement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Old monks&rsquo; door!&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;Any ghost of a monk
  is bound to come through the monks&rsquo; door! If it was a ghost of a
  cook-general, she&rsquo;d come through the kitchen door. You can&rsquo;t tell
  me anything about ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was compelled to laugh at the absurdity.</p>

  <p>Hallick came back at that moment with the colonel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What the dickens are you doing?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>Ferdie had found a rug, left behind by Mrs. Elvery, and this he was
  wrapping about himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sleep in your room,&rdquo; said Redmayne harshly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let him alone.&rdquo; Hallick was rather indulgent to this
  eccentric man.</p>

  <p>He felt a draught and pulled back the curtains. The windows were open.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bolt this after we go out, Miss Redmayne, and don&rsquo;t let
  anybody in unless you hear your father&rsquo;s voice. We&rsquo;re going into
  the grounds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go to your room, my darling,&rdquo; said the
  colonel, but she shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, my dear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leave her, leave her,&rdquo; said Hallick impatiently.
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do her no harm.&rdquo; Ferdie, wrapped in the rug, had
  ensconced himself in the chair. He thought he heard her go out, but she was
  still there, and presently she peeped round the corner, and, seeing that his
  eyes were closed, switched out all the lights save one. She thought that she
  would speak to him, but changed her mind, tiptoed softly to the door and
  pulled it open. Her head was turned towards where Ferdie sat behind the
  screen. She did not see the man who suddenly appeared in the doorway, within
  inches of her. A tall shape, draped from head to foot in black, two eyes
  gleaming through the slits of the cowl.</p>

  <p>She had no warning, no premonition of her danger, till an arm like steel
  slipped round her waist and a great hand covered her mouth.</p>

  <p>She looked round, frozen with horror; saw the gleam of those gloomy eyes
  and went limp in the arms of the black monk.</p>

  <p>Without a sound he lifted her into the passage, closed the door softly
  behind him, and carried her, as though she had no weight, past the door of
  her father&rsquo;s study to a little room that was used as a store. Had she
  been conscious, she would have remembered the big trapdoor in the middle of
  the room which was always fastened. Stooping, he pulled the trap open, and,
  hoisting her to his shoulder, descended a flight of stone stairs. He left her
  for a moment, came back and fastened the trap from the inside.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">HALLICK and the colonel visited the men they had stationed
in the grounds,
  but nothing had been seen of the mysterious
apparition, nor had any trace been found of Goodman or Marks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Marks is in London by now,&rdquo; said Hallick as they squelched
  across the sodden grass to the house. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t take much
  finding.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why did he come here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To get the stuff that&rsquo;s hidden here&mdash;the gold your
  friend, O&rsquo;Shea, has cached somewhere in this house,&rdquo; said
  Hallick. &ldquo;I am taking O&rsquo;Shea to-night, and I advise you to keep
  out of the way, because I have an idea somebody is going to be badly hurt. My
  suggestion to you is that you take your daughter to London to-night; use one
  of my cars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She will not go. How can I explain to her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
  began the colonel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for explanations,&rdquo; said the other
  shortly. &ldquo;You can tell her the truth, or you can wait till the case
  comes for trial. O&rsquo;Shea, I presume, gave you the money to buy this
  house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He had already bought it, before the robbery,&rdquo; said the
  colonel. &ldquo;I was in a terrible state of mind, expecting arrest at any
  moment. I can&rsquo;t tell you how he got to know of my situation. I&rsquo;d
  never heard of the man before. But when he offered me a loan, a fixed income,
  and a decent house over my head, I jumped at it. You see, I&rsquo;m not a
  fighting soldier &mdash;I&rsquo;m an army doctor; and when he explained that
  he had these little troubles I very naturally thought he&rsquo;d be easy to
  deal with. I didn&rsquo;t even know he was O&rsquo;Shea till a year or so
  ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They trudged on in silence, and then Hallick said:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have other men been here&mdash;other boarders?&rdquo; He mentioned
  two names, and the colonel nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, they came for a day or two, and then disappeared without
  paying their bills.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They died here,&rdquo; said Hallick grimly; &ldquo;and died at
  O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s hands&mdash;if they&rsquo;d had the sense to tell me
  that they&rsquo;d located O&rsquo;Shea I could have saved them. But they
  wanted all the credit for themselves, I suppose, poor chaps!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Killed them&mdash;here!&rdquo; gasped the colonel.</p>

  <p>By this time they had come to the house, and Hallick tapped gently on the
  French windows. There was no response. He tapped again, but there was no
  answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better come to the door and wake Cotton,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>It was a long time before Cotton heard the knocking, and a longer time
  before he opened the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Miss Redmayne?&rdquo; asked Hallick.</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen her, sir. There&rsquo;s somebody sleeping
  here&mdash;he&rsquo;s covered up with a blanket&mdash;gave me quite a start
  when I peeped round the screen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Fane; leave him alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He turned on all the lights.</p>

  <p>And then suddenly a cold feeling came to this hardened detective, a sense
  of impending disaster.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go and find your daughter,&rdquo; he said. Redmayne went out, and
  the detective heard his feet on the floor above. He came back in five
  minutes, white and shaking.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not in her room and I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s in
  the house. I&rsquo;ve looked everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you seen her, Cotton?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir, I haven&rsquo;t seen the young lady at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Hallick.</p>

  <p>He picked up something from the floor; it was a girdle. The two men looked
  at one another.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been here&mdash;the monk!&rdquo; said Redmayne in
  horror.</p>

  <p>Hallick had turned back the screen and dragged the chair, with its
  slumbering form, into the middle of the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wake up, Fane&mdash;Miss Redmayne has disappeared.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With a quick movement he jerked away the corner of the rug that covered
  the sleeper&rsquo;s face, and started back with a cry. For the man who lay in
  that chair was not Fane. He looked down at the dead face of Soapy Marks!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">MARY came to consciousness with a curious sensation of
discomfort. She was
  lying on something hard and cold. She looked up and her eyes were attracted
  by a pale blue lantern which hung from a vaulted roof; and to her ears came
  the sound of music; the deep, bass notes of an organ.</p>

  <p>She struggled to a sitting position, and looked round. She was in a tiny
  chapel. In a recess stood a white-draped altar. Great wooden pillars
  supported the roof, and between these she saw a small organ, at which there
  was seated a black-robed monk.</p>

  <p>He heard her move and, looking round, came stealthily towards her. She was
  paralysed with fear and could not move.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;There is nothing
  to be afraid of, my little lamb.&rdquo; The voice was muffled by the thick
  cowl that hid the face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your friend&mdash;your lover&mdash;your worshipper!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Was she dreaming? Was this some hideous nightmare? No, it was real
  enough.</p>

  <p>She saw now that there were two entrances to the vault, one on either
  side. Two recesses whence stone steps wound upward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked again, and slowly he pulled back the
  hood.</p>

  <p>She could not believe her eyes. It was Goodman. The grey hair was ruffled,
  the keen face less serene than she had known it. His eyes were like burning
  fires.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Goodman!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leonard, you shall call me,&rdquo; he said in the same tone.</p>

  <p>He reached his trembling hands down and caught her by the shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mary, my love, I have waited&mdash;oh, so long&mdash;for this
  glorious moment. For you are to me as a divinity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She came to her feet and shrank back from him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not afraid of me, Mary?&rdquo; She drew to herself all
  her reserves of courage and strength, and shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Goodman. Why should I be afraid of you? I&rsquo;m glad that
  you&rsquo;re alive. I was afraid&mdash;something had happened to
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing could happen to me, my lamb.&rdquo; His smile was full of
  confidence. &ldquo;Nothing could happen to your lover. The very gods
  protected him and reserved him for this glorious reward.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her knees were trembling under her. She was sick, and would have fainted
  again, but by force of will maintained her consciousness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your lover,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve loved you all
  this time. Sometimes I&rsquo;ve wanted you so that there was a fire in my
  heart and in my brain that was beyond my control.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took her cold hand in his and brought it to his lips. She tried to pull
  is away, but he held it firmly, and his eyes smiled into hers. They were
  bigger than she had ever seen them&mdash;wide, glowing eyes that transfigured
  his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not afraid of me?&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Not
  afraid of the lover who can give you all your heart&rsquo;s
  desire?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly he caught her arm, and waved his hand about the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s money here; gold&mdash;thousands and thousands of
  golden pieces. Beautiful golden&rsquo; pieces, all hidden away. I hid them
  with my own hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then he waxed confidential, and was more like his normal self.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This chapel is full of hollow places. I found deep cavities where
  the bodies of the dead monks lay. I took them out and purified their charnel
  houses with beautiful gold.&rdquo; He pointed. &ldquo;That wall behind that
  old seat, these wooden pillars, are packed tight with it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She tried to keep him in that saner mood. .</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is this place, Mr. Goodman? I&rsquo;ve never seen it
  before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at her strangely, and a slow smile dawned on his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is a sanctuary for my bride.&rdquo; His arms went round her,
  and she steeled herself to offer no resistance. &ldquo;Men and women have
  been married here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you smell the fragrance
  of the bride&rsquo;s hair? We will be married here,&rdquo; he nodded.
  &ldquo;And men have died here&mdash;hundreds of years ago. We may die here
  too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed. She had heard that laugh in the night, and the horror of it
  turned her blood to ice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve buried men here&mdash;there!&rdquo;&lsquo; He pointed.
  &ldquo;And there!&rdquo; He pointed again. &ldquo;They came in search of
  me&mdash;clever men from Scotland Yard!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He knelt down on the floor and put his face to the joints of a stone
  slab.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one there. Do you hear me, you dead man&mdash;you who
  came, so full of life, to catch O&rsquo;Shea? Do you hear me? I am alive. And
  you&mdash;what are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please, please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;You are
  terrifying me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He chuckled at this.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Terror&mdash;ah! That is what they call me&mdash;the Terror
  that walks by night. Biblical&mdash;a strange thing to call poor old Goodman.
  I used to sit, smoking my pipe, in that room of ours&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed
  up&mdash;&ldquo;and hear that stupid old woman talk of the Terror. And inside
  me my heart was laughing. She never knew how near she was.&rdquo; He reached
  out his long hand, and it clenched horribly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Goodman!&rdquo; She strove to bring him back to a rational
  level. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll let me go now, won&rsquo;t you? My father will
  give you anything you want, will do anything for you&mdash;he has been a
  doctor, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Not once did his hand release the grip on her arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your father?&rdquo; He was amused, and chuckled for a long time.
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do as I tell him, because he&rsquo;s afraid of me. You
  never thought he was afraid of me, but he is. He thinks I&rsquo;m mad.
  That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s looking after me. I know he&rsquo;s a
  doctor&mdash;of course he&rsquo;s a doctor. Sometimes he used to lock me up
  in a cell. I used to scream and tear at the walls, but he kept me there.
  He&rsquo;s mad&mdash;they&rsquo;re all mad!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was swooning with fright, and with a superhuman effort tore her arm
  from his grip and fled to the stairs. Before one foot was on the lowest step
  he had caught her and dragged her back again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not yet&mdash;not yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me go.&rdquo; She did not struggle. &ldquo;I swear I
  won&rsquo;t attempt to run away again. You can believe me, can&rsquo;t
  you?&rdquo; He nodded and released her. She crouched down on the stone seat
  before the altar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll play to you,&rdquo; he said, with sudden inspiration.
  &ldquo;Lovely music&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As his fingers wandered over the keys he was talking disjointedly to
  himself, presently he began to play, so softly that his voice sounded harsh
  against that wonderful background of melody.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard this old organ?&rdquo; He looked round over his
  shoulder at her. &ldquo;I play to the dead and make them live! Old monks walk
  here&mdash;long lines of them, marching two and two. And people bring young
  brides to wed and old men to die. And sometimes I see men here that I
  know&mdash;dead men&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He dropped again into a conversational tone. Suddenly the music stopped,
  and he pointed to an invisible shape.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look&mdash;Joe Connor!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She tried to pierce the gloom but saw nothing. Goodman was talking now,
  beckoning to the invisible shape.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come here, Connor; I want to talk to you. Been to prison, have you?
  Poor fellow! And all because of that wicked man O&rsquo;Shea. Come for your
  share of the swag? You shall have it, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The organ ceased. He went across and put his arm around something that was
  invisible to Mary, but was plain to his crazy eyes. And so he led the thing
  he saw to the stone seat she had vacated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shall have it, my boy. It&rsquo;s all here, Connor&mdash;the
  good red gold that I got away with. Sit down, Connor&mdash;I want to tell you
  all about it. I&rsquo;d bought this old house months before&mdash;you see,
  Connor? And I brought the gold here in the lorry by night, and I hid it in
  the hollow places. Weeks and months I worked, filling hollow pillars and the
  graves of old monks. Clever, eh, Connor? No wonder you smile.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He rose and stood behind the ghostly shape he saw.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tell you this because you&rsquo;re dead &mdash;and dead men never
  tell. And then I got Redmayne as a blind, put him in charge of the house. He
  had to do it, Connor&rdquo;&mdash;he lowered his voice to a confidential
  note&mdash;&ldquo;because I had a hold on him. I used to go a little queer
  and he looked after me&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I paid him for. I was
  nothing&mdash;he was the master of Monkshall. He, he&mdash;that&rsquo;s how I
  fooled the police. Nobody dreamed that I was O&rsquo;Shea. You want your
  share&mdash;damn you! You dog! I&rsquo;ll choke the life out of you, you
  hound!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His voice rose to a yell as he gripped the spirit throat and, in his
  imagination, hurled it to the ground. He was kneeling on the floor now, his
  face demoniacal in its fury.</p>

  <p>And then he remembered the girl and looked round.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m frightening you.&rdquo; His voice was soft. He came
  nearer to her and suddenly clasped her in his arms.</p>

  <p>She screamed, but he hushed her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to frighten you. Don&rsquo;t scream. I love you
  too much to frighten you.&rdquo; His lips sought hers, but she avoided
  them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, not yet&mdash;give me a little time.&rdquo; He loosed his hold
  on her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you will love me? Did you see those little doors in the passage
  walls? The old monks lived there. You and I will find a bridal suite
  there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was fighting desperately for time. At any moment this madness might
  pass. She knew now he was O&rsquo;Shea&mdash;sane for twenty-two hours a
  day.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait. I want to talk to you, Mr. Goodman. You said you loved
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are God to me,&rdquo; he said reverently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You would not want me to love you if I loved some one else, would
  you?&rdquo; His face changed at this.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Loved some one else? No, no. I would not ask it. But do you love
  some one else?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m awfully fond of&mdash;of Mr.
  Fane.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a second he neither spoke nor moved, then his hand shot out to her
  throat. She thought she was doomed, but at that moment she was gripped by the
  arm and swung aside, and O&rsquo;Shea looked into the levelled muzzle of an
  automatic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want you, O&rsquo;Shea!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was Fane&rsquo;s voice, Fane&rsquo;s arm that encircled her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come away from that switch. That&rsquo;s right. I don&rsquo;t want
  to be in the dark. Farther. Now stand still.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s voice was surprisingly
  gentle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Bradley!&rdquo; said Fane quietly. &ldquo;Inspector
  Bradley of Scotland Yard. I want you, O&rsquo;Shea. For three years I have
  been waiting for this opportunity, and now I know all that I want to
  know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>O&rsquo;Shea nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know what I have done to Marks?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You killed him&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He tried to strangle me&mdash;I think he must have recognised me.
  His body&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I found it behind the monks&rsquo; door and left it in my place. If
  he and Connor had taken my advice they would have been alive
  to-day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>O&rsquo;Shea gave a deep sigh and smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve given everybody a lot of
  trouble,&rdquo; he said blandly. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re Bradley, the man who
  arrested Connor and the man who arrested our old friend, Soapy Marks, and now
  you have done the hat trick! Really, I deserve everything for not recognising
  you. Miss Redmayne, will you accept my apologies? I am afraid at times I get
  a little out of hand&mdash;a mere passing folly&mdash;um. May I take off this
  ridiculous robe?&rdquo; He stripped the black robe from him, slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be careful. He is not sane yet,&rdquo; said Mary in a low
  voice.</p>

  <p>He heard her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear Miss Redmayne&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled&mdash;&ldquo;you
  must be a very poor judge of sanity. And now, I suppose, inspector&mdash;or
  is it superintendent?&mdash;you will marry this charming young lady who has
  so touchingly declared her love for you? I wish I could find you a little
  wedding present.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So quickly did he move that Bradley could not have escaped death had not
  the foot of the assassin slipped. The knife struck one of the pillars, and in
  the impact the rotting wood broke and a stream of gold flowed from its hollow
  depth.</p>

  <p>O&rsquo;Shea glared at the gold that had cost him so much, and then he
  began to laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A wedding present,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p>

  <p>He was still laughing when Hallick and three detectives took him by car to
  London.</p>
  <hr>



   <h2>
  <a name="story2" id="story2">THE CAT BURGLAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Old Tom Burkes used to say to Elsah, his daughter: "Easy
grabbing is good
grabbing. Nobody was ever ruined by taking small profits."</p>

  <p>After his eighth whisky old Tom was rather oracular. He would sit before
the fire in the shabby little dining-room at Elscombe Crescent (Mayfair by
telephone, Bayswater by bus), and pass across such cultured pearls of
wisdom.</p>

  <p>"You can't expect millionaires to marry&mdash;especially if they've been
married before. This Poynting's got money and a family. Families are always a
just cause an' impediment. If he wants to make you happy by givin' me a
directorship&mdash;let him."</p>

  <p>So that when, in a moment of mental aberration, Colonel J. C. Poynting
pressed upon her for acceptance the emerald bar which caused all the trouble,
Elsah accepted. She made some faint protest... One shouldn't (she murmured)
accept such a present even from so dear a friend unless... unless...</p>

  <p>Colonel Poynting did not fill the gap. He was an infatuated old
gentleman, but for the moment infatuation was held in check by an uneasy-sense
of family.</p>

  <p>"You'd better insure that," said Elsah's wise father. "It's worth three
thousand if it is worth a cent."</p>

  <p>Prudently, Elsah followed his advice&mdash;which was also unfortunate.</p>

  <p>Most unfortunate of all, a few weeks later Colonel Poynting very
nervously requested her to return the bar&mdash;his daughter had asked to see
it... he would return it to Elsah.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said her cynical parent.</p>

  <p>That night the bar was stolen. It was taken from her dressing-table by
some person or persons unknown. This information she conveyed to the Colonel by
express letter. The Colonel replied in person, arriving in a taxi and a state
of nervous perspiration. Accompanying him was a detective.</p>

  <p>And that was where the real trouble started. For the detective asked
horrid questions, and Elsah wept pitifully, and the Colonel not only comforted
her but proposed marriage. On the whole, it would have been better if he had
been content with the loss of the emeralds.</p>

  <p>Now, here is a point for all mystery-mongers to note. Up to the moment
the loss of the emerald bar was reported. Miss Dorothy Poynting had never
considered Elsah as anything more than a safe dancing partner for fathers, and
knew nothing whatever about the bar having been given to that enterprising
lady.</p>

  <p>The two shocks came almost simultaneously. Dorothy Poynting's reactions
to the announcement were rather inhuman and wholly at variance with Colonel
Poynting's ideas of what a daughter's attitude should be when he
condescends&mdash;there is no other word for it, or at any rate the Colonel
could find no other word&mdash;to inform her that he contemplated marrying
again.</p>

  <p>He told her this at dinner, stammering and coughing and talking quite
fiercely at moments, though at other moments he was pleading.</p>

  <p>"She's rather young, but she's a real good sort. If you feel... um...that
you'd be happier away... elsewhere... living somewhere else, you can have the
flat in Portland Place, and of course Sonningstead is yours..."</p>

  <p>Dorothy surveyed her father thoughtfully. He was good-looking, in a
way&mdash;pink of skin, white-haired, slim, invariably tailor-right. She wished
he was fat; there is nothing quite as effective as a noticeable rotundity for
reducing the conscious ego.</p>

  <p>He was very vain about his waist and his small feet and nicely modeled
hands. They were twiddling now with the spotless gardenia in his buttonhole.</p>

  <p>"Elsah Burkes is a dear girl," defiantly. "You may not like her: I hardly
expected that you would. It is a tremendous compliment to me that she should,
so to speak, sacrifice her&mdash;um&mdash;youth..."</p>

  <p>"It may also be a tremendous compliment to the Poynting Traction
Company," said Dorothy gently.</p>

  <p>He was infuriated. He told her so. He was so mild a man that she had no
other means of knowing.</p>

  <p>"I'm simply furious with you! Because a gel's poor... I'm sorry I
consulted you..."</p>

  <p>She smiled at this. How annoyingly she could smile! And she dusted her
white georgette lap before she rose, took a cigarette from the table and lit
it.</p>

  <p>"Dear old darling," she said, waving the smoking thing airily, "would you
have told me if you had not to explain how dear Elsah came to be robbed of a
large emerald bar&mdash;mother's bar? You had to explain that away&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is no need whatever " he began, with well-modulated violence.</p>

  <p>She waved him to comparative quiet.</p>

  <p>"It was in all the newspapers. The moment I saw that Elsah had lost an
emerald bar I was suspicious. When I saw the photographs, I knew. With all your
money, daddy, you might have bought her a bushel of emeralds. It was intensely
heartless and vulgar to give away a jewel that was my mother's. That is all."
She flicked ash into the fireplace. "Also&mdash;don't get vexed with
me&mdash;it was singularly prudent of Elsah to insure the bar the moment it
came into her possession."</p>

  <p>"You are going too far," said her father in his awful voice.</p>

  <p>"As far as Portland Place, if you go on with this absurd marriage. Or
perhaps I'll go out into the world and do something romantic, such as work for
my living."</p>

  <p>John Venner came in at that moment. Elsah and he arrived together.</p>

  <p>She was rather tall and Junoesque&mdash;which means on the way to
plumpness&mdash;red- haired, white-skinned, flashing-eyed.</p>

  <p>"That woman," said Dorothy, in a critical mood, "has made radiance a
public nuisance."</p>

  <p>She said this to John Venner: he was rather charitable. Nothing quite
exasperates a woman so much as misapplied charity. And it is invariably
misapplied when employed in the defense of another woman.</p>

  <p>John was a Guardsman, a nicely mannered young man who had so much money
that he could never marry well.</p>

  <p>"I think you're deuced unkind to old Elsah," he said.</p>

  <p>With difficulty Dorothy remembered that she was a lady.</p>

  <p>Elsah had similar views. She asked her future step-daughter whether they
might go to Dorothy's bedroom and have a real heart-to-heart talk. Dorothy
checked an inclination to suggest the meat pantry.</p>

  <p>"Because you see, darling"&mdash;Elsah sat picturesquely on the bed and
exhibited her nice legs&mdash;"I must get right with you! I know you loathe me,
and I told Clarence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who's Clarence?" asked the dazed Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"Your dear daddy," cooed Elsah.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Dorothy, shocked. "I never realized that! Well, you told
Clarence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elsah swallowed something.</p>

  <p>"I told your dear father that he mustn't expect you to... well..."</p>

  <p>"Hang out the flags?" suggested Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"That's rather vulgar, isn't it!" Elsah would not have been human if she
had failed to protest. "I do hope you and I are going to be great friends.
Won't you come round and dine one night with father and me? He's such a
dear..."</p>

  <p>All that sort of stuff.</p>

  <p>Dorothy listened and wondered, as Elsah told her of the terrible shock it
had been to her when she found the bar had vanished, and of what perfect dears
the insurance people had been. She had no intention then of calling on Elsah or
her father. Two days later, without rhyme or reason, she made her appearance at
Elscombe Crescent. Elsah was out, but her plump father was in.</p>

  <p>"Cer'n'ly," murmured Mr. Burke drowsily. "Show'rin... who d'ye say
'twas!"</p>

  <p>He had been celebrating at luncheon the forthcoming prosperity to his
family. Conscious that somebody had come into the room, he jerked himself into
semi- wakefulness.</p>

  <p>"Elsah, old girl," he droned, "as I've off'n said, grab whils' the
grabbin's good."</p>

  <p>He said other things, and Dorothy stood stock-still and listened until
Mr. Burkes began to snore.</p>

  <p>Not in dark cellars with blanketed windows and secret exits do great
robber gangs hold their meetings; behind no tiled doors with guards within and
without do they confer across a greasy table, with loaded revolvers and bright
knives at hand to deal with intruders.</p>

  <p>Old Tom Burkes had never possessed a pistol in his life, and he regarded
the employment of knives, bright or otherwise, as "foreign." He had, in his
unregenerate youth, employed a length of lead piping on the helmeted head of a
policeman, but he was not proud of the exploit.</p>

  <p>The robbers' cave for the moment was the rather ornate restaurant of
Emilio, which is near to the Strand. It was a place of bright lights, in the
rays of which silver and glass glittered on snowy napery; there were flowers
set in rather florid German-silver cornucopias on every table, and behind the
red plush seats that ran along the wall, large mirrors on which landscapes and
things were painted so extensively that a lady could not see herself powdering
her nose except by dodging between obese swans and glittering minarets.</p>

  <p>The robber fare was <i>cr&egrave;me duchesse</i>, <i>sole au bonne
femme</i>, and <i>poulet curry au casserole</i>.</p>

  <p>Tom had black coffee to follow; Morgan, being younger and less opulent,
seized the opportunity to order <i>p&ecirc;che melba</i> at another man's
expense.</p>

  <p>Tom fetched a plethoric sigh, tapped off the ash of his cigar into the
coffee saucer, and made another regretful reference to "Lou."</p>

  <p>"What a woman!" he said.</p>

  <p>There was both admiration and awe in his tone. He was stout and bald. His
red face was rather furrowed; in his prominent blue eyes at the moment was a
hint of tragedy. Morgan, being younger, was less easily harrowed by the
misfortune of his fellows. He was a mean-faced man of thirty, painfully thin,
with large red hands that were mostly knuckle.</p>

  <p>"If she'd stuck by her friends," he said, "them that was her real
friends, she'd have been out and about, havin' dinner with us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lunch," murmured Mr. Burkes. "And at the Carlton. Lou believed in the
best. Ah!"</p>

  <p>He sighed again.</p>

  <p>There was more than a hint of sycophancy in "Slip" Morgan's attitude and
speech. They called him "Slip" because he was slippery, and because he was so
thin that legend had it he had once slipped through the most closely set steel
bars that ever protected a bank vault.</p>

  <p>"Lou was thoughtless," said Tom, himself very thoughtful. "She was too
confident. She was inclined, if I might say so, to forget her jewties. I said
to her only a month ago: 'Lou, I want you for a big job, so keep yourself free-
-round about New Year's Day. There's grand money in it, and I can't work
without you.'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Morgan uttered impatient sounds.</p>

  <p>"I'd have thought " he began.</p>

  <p>Tom did not want to know what he thought.</p>

  <p>"She told me she'd got a job to do for Rinsey, and I told her he was a
careless worker, an' warned her. I gave her fifty on account&mdash;the money's
lost, but I don't mind that, Slip&mdash;and I got to work to make the job
sweet." He groaned, deliberately it seemed, for he took his cigar from his
mouth. "And now, with this footman feller givin' me all I wanted, where the
devil is Lou?"</p>

  <p>Slip hastened to supply the information.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a pie-can," said Mr. Burkes testily. "I know she's in Holloway.
Six months ain't much, and she ought to have got a laggin'. But where'm I goin'
to find The Gel!"</p>

  <p>Slip smiled.</p>

  <p>"It's nothin' to laugh about," said Tom. His sourness was justified.</p>

  <p>"I got her," said Slip simply.</p>

  <p>Tom removed his cigar again.</p>

  <p>"You got her?" skeptically. "Maggie Swarty or Gay Joyler or one of them
lot! Is anybody goin' to think they're ladies? You want your head shaved!"</p>

  <p>"T got her," said Slip again, and added: "A lady."</p>

  <p>Tom's nose wrinkled.</p>

  <p>"What you think's a lady an' what is a lady is about the differentest
thing that ever happened," he said.</p>

  <p>But Slip was not offended.</p>

  <p>"This one's a real lady. She's pretty and young and plays the pianner,"
he said impressively. "And she's on the crook, and is ready for anything except
funny business."</p>

  <p>"Except what?"</p>

  <p>"Funny business&mdash;love-makin', hand-holdin', cuddlin'," said Mr.
Morgan comprehensively.</p>

  <p>Tom looked at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I ain't tried," Slip was in haste to assure his superior. "One of the
other lodgers asked her to go to the pictures. She told him to go to hell!"</p>

  <p>"A lady!" murmured Mr. Burkes, closing his eyes like one in pain.</p>

  <p>"She's a lady. I got sweet with the maid who looks after her room, and
what do you think I found out?"</p>

  <p>Tom shook his head, and Slip searched in his pocket and produced
fantastically shaped pieces of paper which he maneuvered so that they formed
the torn half of a note-sheet.</p>

  <p>Mr. Burkes laboriously extracted his pince-nez, fixed them to his nose,
opened his mouth (as he did when he was thus engaged), and read:</p>

  <p>"Send back the brooch, and no further action will be taken..."</p>

  <p>"Written on good paper," said Mr. Burkes, an authority on such matters,
"by a woman&mdash;she's a maid or something. That's why you thought she was a
lady."</p>

  <p>Slip argued with great earnestness, and in the end Tom was half
convinced. There was an admitted difficulty as regards the approach, but Slip,
a man of tact and resource, was confident that all obstacles would be
overcome.</p>

  <p>Miss Mary Smith was not an easy proposition. Since she had taken a
certain jewel from Elsah Burkes' dressing-table, she had been living in
retirement, with three thousand pounds' worth of emeralds pinned, if not in the
vacuity of her heart, on the garment which enfolded it.</p>

  <p>She had changed her lodgings as often as she had changed her name, once
with great rapidity, when Elsah had located her and had come later, bearing an
offer of forgiveness in exchange for the big green bar. Unfortunately, she did
not bear the message which Mary required.</p>

  <p>It would be rather awkward, mused Mary Smith, as she sat on the edge of
her bed in a Bloomsbury lodging, if Miss Burkes really did put the police on
her track; but, on the other hand, how could Elsah explain certain matters...
?</p>

  <p>To her cogitations intruded the deferential knocking of the parlor-
maid.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" asked Mary Smith imperiously.</p>

  <p>The maid entered.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman says could he have a few words with you?"</p>

  <p>She slid a card across the table. Mary read, and was unimpressed:</p>

  <p class="cp">Mr. Featherlow-Morgan. New Amsterdam Board of Control.</p>

  <p>There was a vagueness about Mr. Morgan's exact status which she
overlooked. She went down to a hole in the wall of the entrance lobby [which
was known as the lounge.</p>

  <p>Mr. Morgan understood women: shilly-shallying was a mistake that led to
failure. He believed in the direct or knock-out method.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, miss," he said respectfully. "I'd like to have a few words
with you."</p>

  <p>She waited.</p>

  <p>"I never beat about the bush"&mdash;Slip could not afford to lose time.
"Heard about Miss Burkes? I'll bet you haven't! I'll bet you don't know
her!"</p>

  <p>"You've won your bet," said Mary Smith calmly. "Aren't you awfully
excited?"</p>

  <p>Such a response was naturally disconcerting. Happily he could cover his
momentary confusion. He groped wildly in an inside pocket, brought out a red
morocco case, and flicked it open. Between visiting-cards, of which he carried
a variety, was a newspaper cutting. This he drew out and flourished at her.</p>

  <p>"Read that," he commanded.</p>

  <p>Mary Smith took the slip. He saw her brows gathered in a puzzled frown.
Then she started to read aloud:</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"...with every suit we present an extra pair of pants
warranted wear-resisting..."</p>

  <p>"You're reading the wrong side of the paper," said Slip testily. She
turned the cutting over.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"The police are searching for an emerald bar, which was
stolen from Miss Elsah Burkes' dressing-table, possibly by cat burglars, last
week, and have circulated the following description of the missing jewelry...
The bar is worth &pound;3000, and the insurance underwriters are offering a
reward of &pound;200 for its recovery. Miss Burkes, who is engaged to be
married to Colonel Poynting, the shipping magnate, says that although the
property is insured, it has a sentimental value which is beyond
calculation."</p>

  <p>She handed the cutting back.</p>

  <p>"Sentiment is the ruin of the leisured classes," she said, and he laughed
admiringly. It was not a pleasant laugh, being a succession of "huh-huhs" that
ended in a violent cough.</p>

  <p>"That's the way to look at it. Do you know Colonel Poynting?"</p>

  <p>She first hesitated, then nodded.</p>

  <p>"Do you know his house in Park Lane&mdash;ever been there?"</p>

  <p>"I know the house very well," she said. Her eyes were asking questions.</p>

  <p>"I am a plain man " he began, and she nodded, he thought a little
offensively, and for a moment was thrown out of his stride. "What I mean to say
is, that there's no sense in beating about the bush."</p>

  <p>"You did say it, some time ago," she said.</p>

  <p>Very few women could rattle Slip Morgan. She did.</p>

  <p>"You're on the hook and so am I," he said firmly. "I know all about that
emerald bar that you've got pinned on your&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't let us be indelicate," said Mary Smith. "Yes, you know all about
it? Well?"</p>

  <p>"If you want a hundred pounds for an hour's work, the job's waiting for
you. All you've got to do is to go to Colonel Poynting's house. We'll fake a
card of invitation. Just walk about amongst the swells, and give a certain
friend of mine the office when he can come in. Do you see what I mean?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said, shaking her head. "The only thing that's pretty clear is
that you want me to go to Mr. Poynting's house, and that of course I shan't do.
In the first place " She paused, and shook her head again. "No, I can't do
it."</p>

  <p>Slip smiled. They still had the ^lounge" to themselves, but the chances
were that they would not enjoy this privacy for long.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what," he said confidentially. You think you'll be
recognized?" And, when she agreed, he patted her lightly on the arm. She
brushed her sleeve so ostentatiously, so deliberately, that he did not repeat
this gesture of friendliness and comradeship.</p>

  <p>"It's the fancy-dress ball " he began.</p>

  <p>"0h!"</p>

  <p>Evidently she knew all about the fancy-dress ball, for he saw her mouth
open a little.</p>

  <p>"0f course, masks! How amusing!" She looked at Slip with a new interest.
"Your friend is on the hook, you said? Does that mean he's hanged or he's going
to be hanged! Or do I understand that your friend is not exactly honest?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be comic," said the inelegant Mr. Morgan, "and don't play the
dairymaid on me. Innocence is all very well in its place. The question is, will
you do it&mdash;there's a hundred pounds for you&mdash;fifty down and fifty
after the job?"</p>

  <p>She was pinching her lower lip, looking at, and slightly through, Slip
Morgan.</p>

  <p>"Do I understand that your friend is going to?" She waited for him to
suggest the proper phrase, which he did.</p>

  <p>"He's going to do a job at Colonel Poynting's house in Park Lane."</p>

  <p>"And that I'm to go inside and signal&mdash;how?"</p>

  <p>"Through the winder," said Slip. "It's easy.</p>

  <p>You just stroll up to the winder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>""Window," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"'Winder's' good enough for me," he snarled. "Pull out a handkerchief and
sort of rub your nose with it. But you mustn't do that till Colonel Poynting
gives away the prizes for the first fancy dress, because everybody will be down
in the drawing-room then. Now do you get me?"</p>

  <p>She had got him. And once she was interested, she became almost
enthusiastic. She arranged to meet Mr. Thompson that night (Tom Burkes'
temporary <i>nom de guerre</i>). She would go, she thought, as a pierrot or a
pierrette.</p>

  <p>"It isn't exactly original," she said.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't matter," replied Slip, "so long as it's clean."</p>

  <p>So were arranged the preliminaries of one of the neatest cat burglaries
that had ever been engineered. Upstairs in Mr. Poynting's study was a safe, and
in that safe he kept a considerable sum of money.</p>

  <p>Park Lane is not, as some people imagine, a center of wild and hectic
gaiety. It is a thoroughfare mainly inhabited by people who are rich enough to
live somewhere else. Year in and year out their white blinds are drawn, their
furniture is shrouded in holland sheeting. A vulgar few live in their houses,
but as a rule they do not give parties. Colonel Poynting's fancy-dress ball
was, therefore, so unusual an event that the police hardly knew where to park
the cars.</p>

  <p>The Colonel received his guests at the head of the big staircase, and he
was arrayed, spiritually and materially, in the toga of a Roman father, as he
explained to the worried young Guardsman, who wore nothing more symbolical than
a dress suit. The Colonel explained between speeches of welcome addressed to
his arriving guests.</p>

  <p>"I neither know nor care where Dorothy has gone," he said firmly. "You
saw the letter she wrote to Elsah&mdash;or rather, started to
write?&mdash;&bull; How d'ye do! How d'ye do!&mdash;Happily, I came into the
library when she had been called away to the telephone, and read it.&mdash;Glad
to see you, Lady Carl... how d'ye do!&mdash;No daughter of mine can tell my
fiancee&mdash;order her, in fact&mdash;to give up her father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's an awful old bounder," said Mr. Venner mistakenly.</p>

  <p>"I'm referring to myself," said the Colonel. "I mean Dorothy's
father&mdash;not Elsah's father... how d'ye do! I'm glad to see you... No,
Venner; I will not have it... how d'ye do. Miss... um... ?"</p>

  <p>The newcomer was a masked lady, who flashed a smile and waved a hand
before she disappeared.</p>

  <p>"What good legs that girl's got!" said the Colonel. "Terribly good
legs!... As I was saying, she left my house, and I've reason to believe that
she is persecuting poor Elsah&mdash;the dear girl says nothing, but I can
guess. If I could only get at Dorothy... ah, darling!"</p>

  <p>Darling looked rather worried, and this in spite of the assurance of her
parent that she had nothing to worry about. So far as he was concerned, he
would keep sober until after the ceremony. Not that this troubled her. She drew
the Roman father to a convenient alcove, and a host of clowns and devils and
Venetian ladies arrived unwelcomed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my dear"&mdash;the Colonel patted her hand&mdash; * everything is
in order. I had the license from the Bishop's office this afternoon. Have your
baggage at Victoria... Simplon Express&mdash;you know Italy? A glorious
place!"</p>

  <p>For the moment Italy meant less to Elsah than a pint of pure mud.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy hasn't... written?" She was rather breathless, showed
appropriate symptoms of nervous apprehension (she was honoring Ophelia in the
matter of costume) and a tenseness which he understood.</p>

  <p>"You need not trouble your pretty head about my foolish child," he said.
"She has neither written nor called."</p>

  <p>And here a gathering of Mephistopheles, pierrots, Henry the Eighths, and
a Gentleman of the Regency at the head of the stairs sent him to perform the
host's duties.</p>

  <p>The masked girl sought no friend. She found malicious pleasure in the
sight of a disconsolate young Guardsman equally unattached. She danced with a
Romeo, a pre-historic man, and a Lord Nelson, and was depressed by the
spectacle of an Ophelia in the arms of a Roman father.</p>

  <p>Colonel Poynting's fancy-dress ball was an annual affair; the prize-
giving for the best costume had developed into a ritual. At half-past eleven
the three sycophantic friends who made the choice led the modest Ophelia to the
cleared center of the ballroom.</p>

  <p>"My friends!"</p>

  <p>The Roman father cleared his voice and stroked the moustache which had
come into fashion since the days of Augustus.</p>

  <p>"My friends, on this joyous occasion&mdash;er&mdash;and on the eve of
what may be the turning-point of my life, I have great pleasure in awarding as
a prize a replica of that jewel which was so unhappily lost by the fair choice
of the judges."</p>

  <p>A disinterested observer might have demanded (and many who were not
disinterested did ask <i>sotto voce</i>) whether Colonel Poynting had
foreknowledge of how the judging would go.</p>

  <p>"This replica&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why not have the original, daddy?"</p>

  <p>The Colonel turned with a jump. The masked lady was unmasked.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy!" he squeaked. "Really...!"</p>

  <p>Slowly she held something to view. It was the emerald bar.</p>

  <p>"If the insurance has been paid to your lady friend," she said, "This
belongs to the underwriters."</p>

  <p>"Where... where did you find it?" stammered the Colonel.</p>

  <p>Dorothy looked at the crowd of revellers, stepped nearer to her father,
and lowered her voice.</p>

  <p>"It was never lost," she said&mdash;only the Colonel and the pallid Elsah
heard; "I found it in her bedroom&mdash;between mattress and overlay&mdash;and
Mr. Burkes was foolish enough to tell me how useful the insurance money would
be!"</p>

  <p>"That's a lie!" gasped Elsah. "You're&mdash;you're&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Colonel stopped her. He was as dignified as a toga and a wreath of
roses would allow him to be.</p>

  <p>"I will hear no word against Elsah," he said. "We are to be married
tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Dorothy stared at him.</p>

  <p>"But, daddy, not until you make inquiries... you must wait..."</p>

  <p>Colonel Poynting smiled.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said, almost playfully, "in my safe upstairs, and in my
cash- box, is a little piece of paper signed by the Bishop of London. Come,
come, my dear; tell Elsah you're sorry that you made such a ridiculous
charge."</p>

  <p>"In your cash-box?" she said slowly.</p>

  <p>Turning, she walked to the window, drew aside the heavy curtains, and
waved her hand.</p>

  <p>"My dear!" said her father, in alarm. He thought for a moment that she
contemplated suicide and was taking farewell of the world.</p>

  <p>"Now let everybody sit down and talk," said Dorothy, coming back to the
group. "Tommy Venner&mdash;do something for me! Call everybody
in&mdash;servants, everybody."</p>

  <p>The Colonel moved uneasily. "You're not going to make a scene?"
Dorothy laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to drink the health of my friend Tom," she said
mysteriously.</p>

  <p>Just off Park Lane a taxi was waiting. Tom Burkes strolled negligently
towards and entered the vehicle. As the cab drove off, Slip Morgan, who had
been waiting nervously in the dark interior, asked a question.</p>

  <p>"There it is," said Tom, and dropped the heavy cash-box on the floor.
"That gel's a good worker. I'll hand it to her."</p>

  <p>"Gels'll do anything for me," said Slip complacently.</p>

  <h2><a name="story3"
     id="story3">3. THE STRETELLI CASE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Detective-Inspector John MacKenzie has retired&mdash;the
newspapers are
  filled with stories of his exploits. His immediate chiefs are equally filled
  with wonder, suspecting many reasons for his premature withdrawal from the
  services of his country, but never by any chance hitting upon the real cause,
  which was the unquenchable antagonism between his sense of duty, his sense of
  justice, and his grim sense of humor.</p>

  <p>And this conflict of emotions arose over the Stretelli case, which most
  crime experts and the majority of people consider as having been rounded off
  on a certain cold December morning in Nottingham Prison.</p>

  <p>In a sense this was true; yet, with the compliments of his Chief in his
  ears and with the knowledge that there was a vacant post for a new
  superintendent to be filled, duty, justice, and humor battled it out so
  briskly in his mind that he sat down in his office and wrote his
  resignation.</p>

  <p>In one sense Mackenzie was old-fashioned, and when a card was brought into
  his office inscribed "Dr. Mona Stretelli, Madrid," he sniffed. He was
  prejudiced against women doctors, though this was the first lady who had ever
  called upon him professionally.</p>

  <p>"Show her in," he said, and wondered exactly what had brought a Spanish
  lady doctor to Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>She was in the room before his speculations were carried far&mdash;a girl
  of middle height, dark, capable, and even pretty.</p>

  <p>"I am very honored to meet you, doctor," he said conventionally, speaking
  in French. "What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>She smiled faintly at the brusque greeting.</p>

  <p>"You can give me ten minutes of your valuable time, Mr. Mackenzie," she
  said in perfect English. "I have rather an important statement to make."</p>

  <p>She handed him a letter bearing the Home Office stamp. It was an
  introduction from a high official, and Inspector Mackenzie ceased to
  wonder.</p>

  <p>"Do you know Mr. Peter Morstels?" she asked, and he shook his head.</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"In London you must hear... rumors about people&mdash;in the West End, I
  mean. Have you ever heard of Margaret Stretelli?"</p>

  <p>Mackenzie frowned. "Of course! I thought the name was familiar. Stretelli!
  You are related?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "She was my sister," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Was&mdash;she's not dead?"</p>

  <p>The girl nodded again, and he saw that her eyes were wet.</p>

  <p>When Margaret Stretelli disappeared from London, nobody at police
  headquarters was either relieved or sorry, but the event did not pass
  unnoticed. Margaret belonged to the bobbed-hair set that had its meeting-
  place in a Soho restaurant. She was known to be an associate of questionable
  people; there was talk of cocaine traffic in which she played an exciting but
  unprofitable part; there was one wild party into which the police had
  intruded, and a minor court case where she had figured, a little vulgarly, as
  the driver of a car which had charged a lamp-post. Police headquarters was
  mildly interested in her vagaries, knew her to be well off in the matter of
  money, and when she was no longer seen at her haunts they made discreet
  inquiries, to discover that she had married a gentleman farmer in the
  Midlands, and had run away from him a very few weeks after the marriage, and
  had gone to New York.</p>

  <p>A very uninteresting and commonplace story, hardly worthy the attention of
  Scotland Yard's recording angel, yet, since all crime has its basis in the
  commonplace, the circumstances were duly noted and filed.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better tell you our story," she began. "My father was a
  doctor of Madrid, and on his death he left five million pesetas between his
  two daughters, myself and Margaret. I had taken up my father's profession,
  the profession of medicine, and was in my third year when he died.</p>

  <p>"Poor Margaret loved life&mdash;as she understood it. Three months after
  father's death, she left Madrid for Paris, ostensibly to study music. From
  Paris she went to London, and, so far as I can learn, she got into a very
  undesirable set. How she came to meet Mr. Morstels, I have never been able to
  discover. It is certain that she had wasted a great deal of money when she
  came under his influence. He proposed to her and they were married at
  Marylebone Registry Office, and she left with him for his home at Little
  Saffron.</p>

  <p>"She was seen there by some of the villagers, and, so far as can be
  ascertained, lived with him for three weeks. How much longer she was a
  resident is not known. It may have been three months, it may have been no
  longer than a month. But, when she disappeared, the story that she had run
  away from her husband was accepted as true by the villagers of Avignon, who
  had got quite used to the unfortunate character of Mr. Morstels'
  marriages."</p>

  <p>"He had been married before?" asked Mackenzie.</p>

  <p>"Twice," said the girl; "and each time his wife ran away and was divorced
  by him. Mr. Mackenzie, I am satisfied that my sister has been murdered!"</p>

  <p>Mackenzie sat up in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Murdered? My dear young lady, that sort of thing does not
  happen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly, realizing that this was the type of crime that did
  happen.</p>

  <p>"Possibly his story is true, and your sister ran away," he suggested.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"That is impossible. Had she run away she would have come to me. We were
  always the best of friends, and though she was wilful and headstrong, she
  never got into a strait when she did not ask me to get her out of it."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Mr. Morstels?" asked Mackenzie. "I have seen him: I saw him
  yesterday for the first time," she said, "and the sight of him convinces me
  that my sister has been murdered."</p>

  <p>"That's rather a serious statement to make, but I realize that you would
  not advance such a theory unless you had good grounds," said Mackenzie, with
  a smile. "After all, doctors as a profession are not easily influenced or
  given to making rash statements, are you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I am not, certainly," she said, rising and walking up
  and down the room, her voice rising agitatedly. "Forgive me, Mr. Mackenzie,
  but I am so convinced that poor Margaret is dead that, if she walked into the
  room at this moment, 1 know that I should be suffering from an illusion."</p>

  <p>"But why do you feel this?" Mackenzie persisted. "Beyond the fact that Mr.
  Morstels seems to be, by your account, a much,married man, nothing is known
  against him."</p>

  <p>"I have been making inquiries," she said.</p>

  <p>"The local police speak well of him, but I think that I can furnish you
  with some details which may be of interest. Before Margaret left London, she
  drew from the bank the sum of six thousand five hundred pounds. Where is that
  money?"</p>

  <p>"Did you ask him?"</p>

  <p>"I asked him, and he said that one of his greatest misfortunes was that
  the lady, when she left him, had taken with her not only her own money but
  some of his. He had the audacity to ask me if I was prepared to refund
  it."</p>

  <p>Mackenzie sat hunched up at his desk, his chin in his hand, a heavy frown
  on his face.</p>

  <p>"It grows more and more like a conventional murder story," he said. "I
  hope for your sake, Miss Stretelli, that you are mistaken. I will see Mr.
  Morstels."</p>

  <p>On a wintry morning, when the frost showed whitely on the bare branches in
  Mr. Peter Morstels' orchard, Detective-Inspector Mackenzie made his leisurely
  way from the little railway station, a pipe between the teeth, the furled
  umbrella, without which he never moved, under his arm. In sight of Hill
  Cottage he stopped and carefully inspected the rambling house with the ugly
  concrete extension that had recently been completed. It stood on the slope of
  a hill, a picturesque dwelling, owing something of its charm to distance.
  Five minutes later he was inspecting the building nearer at hand, and he was
  not impressed.</p>

  <p>The man who answered his knock was unusually tall and broad, a veritable
  giant of a man. His thin hair was flaxen, his big face ruddy with the glow of
  health. Standing square in the doorway, he looked down upon the detective
  with a scowl of suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Morstels. I am Inspector Mackenzie from Scotland
  Yard."</p>

  <p>Not a muscle of the big man's face moved. No flicker of lid hid for a
  second the pale blue of the saucer eyes.</p>

  <p>"Glad to see you, officer. Come in."</p>

  <p>He led the way to a stone-floored kitchen, low-ceilinged and clean.</p>

  <p>"I'm wondering if Miss Stretelli sent you? She did, eh? I thought it was
  likely. If I haven't had enough trouble with her sister without her coming to
  me with fantastic stories about my wife!"</p>

  <p>"Where is your wife?" asked Mackenzie bluntly.</p>

  <p>"In America somewhere&mdash;she never told me the town she was going to,
  naturally. I've got her letter upstairs."</p>

  <p>He was gone a few minutes, returning with a sheet of gray paper. It bore
  no address.</p>

  <p class="letter">I am leaving you because I cannot endure the quietness of
  the country. I am writing this on board the "Teutonic." Please divorce me. I
  am not traveling in my own name.</p>

  <p>Mackenzie turned the letter over in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't she use ship's stationery?" he asked pleasantly. "A women in a
  hurry to get away does not usually unpack her trunks in order to get
  stationery that is available in the saloon. I suppose you traced her through
  the passenger list&mdash;oh, of course, you couldn't. She was traveling in
  another name. I wonder how she got over the passport difficulty?"</p>

  <p>He said all this musingly, watching the man before him, but if he expected
  to irritate Peter Morstels into an indiscreet statement, he was to be
  disappointed.</p>

  <p>"That was her business," said the other calmly. "She did not take me into
  her confidence. Her sister thinks I have killed her!"</p>

  <p>He laughed quietly. "Fortunately, I was alone when she called the other
  day. A nice story would have gone through the village if my servant had heard
  her!"</p>

  <p>His eyes never left the detective's face as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I suppose she told you something of the sort?" he queried. "If she did,
  you're at liberty to search the house, dig up the ground, and pull the place
  to pieces. I can say no fairer than that. The only things I have of hers are
  some clothing she did not take away. Would you care to see it?"</p>

  <p>Mackenzie followed him up the stairs to the big bedroom at the front of
  the house. In a wardrobe closet he found a fur coat, two or three dresses,
  and half a dozen pairs of shoes. These latter he examined carefully, one by
  one, and found a pair that had not been worn.</p>

  <p>Mackenzie, who knew something of women, drew his own conclusions. An
  examination of the garden and the grounds brought him no nearer to a solution
  of the girl's disappearance.</p>

  <p>"What are you building there?" he asked, pointing to the half- finished
  concrete annex. The man smiled slowly.</p>

  <p>"That was to have been a new bathroom for my lady! Hill Cottage wasn't
  good enough for her. I wasbuilding this place as a sittingroom for myself,
  but she made me remodel it for her use. I'm a poor man, Mr. Mackenzie, but I
  would have spent my last sou for that woman! She had plenty of
  money&mdash;thousands&mdash;but not a penny did she give me. Not that I
  wanted it."</p>

  <p>Mackenize drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"You've been rather unfortunate in your matrimonial affairs," he said, and
  had nothing but a grunted agreement.</p>

  <p>The detective went back to town that morning in a thoughtful mood. He
  found Mona Stretelli waiting for him in his office.</p>

  <p>"I see by your face that you have learned nothing," she said.</p>

  <p>"You must be a thought reader," he smiled. "The only thing I am satisfied
  about, and this is unofficial, is that Morstels is a liar. He may be a
  murderer, too, but&mdash;there is a 'but'!"</p>

  <p>"Do you think that, if you had authority to search, you should find
  anything?"</p>

  <p>Mackenzie shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," he replied regretfully. "This man is more than an
  ordinary criminal. If he has killed these unfortunate women&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He saw her turn white and stagger, and ran to her assistance.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," she said, and suddenly her black brows met, and there
  came a fire in her eyes that startled him.</p>

  <p>"I swear to you," she said, in a low, vehement tone, "that this man shall
  not escape! He shall suffer for his crimes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly she stopped, and her compressed lips gave some indication of the
  self-restraint she was exercising. She held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"I shall not see you again," she said.</p>

  <p>That afternoon, Mackenzie reported to his Chief, and put the matter
  plainly to him. The Commissioner was not hopeful.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid we can do nothing. Naturally, this unfortunate Spanish girl
  is excited by the loss of her sister, but these disappearances are very
  common, particularly when the person who disappears is&mdash;let us say
  Bohemian. She will very likely turn up at Monte Carlo next season."</p>

  <p>Mackenzie disagreed. He did not see Mona Stretelli for a fortnight,
  though, to his surprise, he read about her. There had been a sale of some old
  jewelry, the property of a deceased Marquis, and she had purchased a famous
  paste ring, which had been the property of Marie Antoinette, for
  &pound;200.</p>

  <p>A picture of the ring appeared in some of the London newspapers, the
  editors being possibly attracted by the quaint and even bizarre setting. It
  was such a ring as no woman could wear&mdash;it was enormously
  large&mdash;and he was puzzled that she had overcome her distress so that she
  could indulge in a frivolity of this kind.</p>

  <p>Then, about a week later, a most amazing thing happened. She went to
  Scotland Yard unannounced one evening, and he expected some news, but
  certainly not the news she gave him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mackenzie," she said, "I have been very ungenerous in reference to
  Mr. Morstels, and I am perfectly satisfied that my suspicions were ill-
  founded."</p>

  <p>He looked at her in amazement. 'Have you seen him?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded; there was a flush in her cheek and her voice was unsteady as
  she answered him.</p>

  <p>"I am going to be married to Mr. Morstels this week."</p>

  <p>He looked at her, speechless with astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Married?" he gasped. "But, knowing what you do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid we were both very prejudiced against Peter," she said calmly.
  "I have found him a most charming and fascinating man."</p>

  <p>"I should imagine you have," said Mackenzie grimly. "But do you realize
  what you are doing?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"And you're really going to marry him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied. "I am marrying him when&mdash;when his divorce
  proceedings are through. I am staying with him for a week. His aunt is coming
  to chaperon me. I told you I would not see you again," she said, with a
  half-smile, "but this time I mean it!"</p>

  <p>With a curt farewell she was gone. As she was leaving the room, the bag
  she was carrying under her arm slipped and fell. She picked it up hurriedly
  and passed out of the room, but in falling the bag had opened and a long
  moir&eacute; silk purse had fallen out.</p>

  <p>He did not notice it until she had gone. Picking it up, he opened the
  purse, thinking to find a card bearing her Paris address. All there was in
  the purse was an oblong receipt form which interested him considerably.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later she was announced again. Evidently the girl had
  discovered her loss.</p>

  <p>"I know what you have come for," said Mackenzie, looking at her flushed
  face. "I found it on the floor a few seconds ago."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said, a little breathlessly, and without another word she
  turned and went away. The next morning he received a wire telling him she was
  leaving for the country.</p>

  <p>Mackenzie thought many things&mdash;but mostly his mind was occupied by
  one problem: what value would the homicidal Peter Morstels place upon the
  eccentric ring of Marie Antoinette? The reason for the purchase of the ring
  was now clear.</p>

  <p>On the second morning after the departure of the girl, he strolled down to
  Waterloo Station to see the passengers off and to watch the departure of the
  boat-train for Southampton. There was a very big trans- Atlantic passenger
  list, and so many people were crossing to America that the train was run in
  two sections.</p>

  <p>"Queer how these Americans travel," said the station inspector,
  recognizing him. "Look at that old lady."</p>

  <p>He pointed to a bent figure in deep mourning, walking painfully along the
  platform with the aid of two sticks. "At her time of life to be risking a sea
  voyage!"</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary," agreed Mackenzie.</p>

  <p>When he returned to the house that afternoon he found a letter waiting for
  him. The envelope was soiled and muddy, the address was in pencil. Inside was
  a visiting-card&mdash;Mona Stretelli's&mdash;and scrawled on its face were
  the words: "For God's sake come to me!"</p>

  <p>Mackenzie carried the news to his Chief, and from that moment he was out
  of the case, though he had credit for all that followed.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear fellow, you must take the case!" insisted his Chief, but Mac
  was adamant, and to Inspector Jordan belongs all the immediate credit for the
  discoveries.</p>

  <p>It was near midnight when Jordan arrived at the farm, and this time he
  went armed with authority, for he had seen his Chief and had impressed him
  with the seriousness of the possibilities. Peter Morstels, half dressed,
  opened the door himself, and turned a little pale when he saw his
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mona Stretelli?" asked Jordan curtly.</p>

  <p>"She has left," said Peter. "She left me the night she arrived here. My
  aunt could not come, and she would not stay without a chaperon."</p>

  <p>"You're lying," said the detective shortly, "and I am going to place you
  under arrest while I make a search of the house."</p>

  <p>The search of the house revealed nothing, but in the morning Jordan
  questioned the villagers, and produced evidence which made the case against
  Morstels look black. Two men who, returning from a neighboring village, had
  passed by a short cut within a quarter of a mile of the house, had heard a
  woman's sharp scream at nine o'clock that night. It came from the direction
  of Hill Cottage. No further sound was heard, and apparently the villagers
  took little notice of the occurrence. When questioned by the detective,
  Morstels admitted that, for some unaccountable reason, which he had put down
  to hysteria, Mona Stretelli had started screamiug.</p>

  <p>"She was like a lunatic," he protested. "Must I be arrested because a
  woman screams? I gave her an hour to calm down, then I went to her room and
  knocked at her door, but there was no answer. I opened it, and she was
  gone&mdash;possibly through a window, for it is a window from which she could
  drop easily to the ground."</p>

  <p>"That story isn't quite good enough," said Jordan. "I am going to remove
  you to the police station, pending an examination of the ground."</p>

  <p>The whole of the estate, such as was not covered by trees, was very
  carefully probed and dug, and on the third day of the investigation the big
  discovery was made. Under about four feet of earth was found a heap of
  charred bones; but, most damning of all, the ring of Marie Antoinette!</p>

  <p>Jordan came back to London and woke Mackenzie with the news.</p>

  <p>"He evidently disposed of the bodies by burning," he said exultantly.
  "There is a huge fireplace in the kitchen, and the bodies could be burnt
  without detection. We have our pathologist, who swears that the bones are
  human."</p>

  <p>"They are not necessarily the bones of Mona Stretelli," said Mackenzie
  warningly.</p>

  <p>"But there is the ring!" he said in triumph. "That is sufficient!"</p>

  <p>Throughout the trial that followed, Morstels preserved a sangfroid which
  was remarkable. The only time he broke down was when the death sentence was
  pronounced, and then it was only for a few moments.</p>

  <p>On the morning before his execution, Mackenzie went to Nottingham Prison
  to see him, at the condemned man's request. He was smoking a cigarette and
  chatting with one of the warders, and he greeted the detective with a little
  nod.</p>

  <p>"You brought me bad luck, Mackenzie, but I'm going to tell you something.
  I did kill several women&mdash;three or four, I forget," he said, with a
  shrug of indifference. "They are all in concrete, the foundations of my new
  house," he chuckled. "But Mona Stretelli I did not killthat I swear. It is a
  bit tough on me, Mac, that I'm to swing for a murder which I did not
  commit!"</p>

  <p>He brooded for a minute, then:</p>

  <p>"I should like to see this girl Stretelli and congratulate her."</p>

  <p>Mackenzie did not reply until he wrote his resignation. He had seen in
  Mona Stretelli's purse a receipt from a Steamship Company for her passage. To
  make doubly sure, he had gone to Waterloo and recognized her, though she was
  well disguised, as she boarded the train.</p>

  <p>The night after she was supposed to have been murdered, she was on the
  broad Atlantic, bound for a new home, a new land, and a new life, leaving
  behind her, in a hole which she herself had dug, the calcined bones which she
  had purchased from an anatomical establishment, and the ring which was to
  bring Morstels to the scaffold.</p>

  <p>And Mackenzie knew it, and let a man hang for a crime he had not
  committed. His conscience and his sense of justice were appeased. His sense
  of humor was entirely satisfied.</p>
