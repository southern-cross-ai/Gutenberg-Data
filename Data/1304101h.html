<p class="note">In 1935, the editor of <i>Fantasy Magazine</i>
asked five prominent science fiction writers and five prominent
fantasy writers to write two "round-robin" stories, both called
<i>The Challenge From Beyond</i>. The authors of the fantasy
version were C.L. Moore, A. Merritt, H.P. Lovecraft, Robert E.
Howard and Frank Belknap Long. The science fiction version was
written by Stanley G. Weinbaum, Donald Wandrei, Edward E. (E.E.
Doc) Smith, Harl Vincent, and Murray Leinster. In the following
text, the name of the author of each section of the story is
given in brackets.</p>

  <h3>[C. L. MOORE]</h3>

<p class="first">George Campbell opened sleep-fogged eyes upon
darkness and lay gazing out of the tent flap upon the pale August
night for some minutes before he roused enough even to wonder
what had wakened him. There was in the keen, clear air of these
Canadian woods a soporific as potent as any drug. Campbell lay
quiet for a moment, sinking slowly back into the delicious
borderlands of sleep, conscious of an exquisite weariness, an
unaccustomed sense of muscles well used, and relaxed now into
perfect ease. These were vacation's most delightful moments,
after all&mdash;rest, after toil, in the clear, sweet forest
night.</p>

<p>Luxuriously, as his mind sank backward into oblivion, he
assured himself once more that three long months of freedom lay
before him&mdash;freedom from cities and monotony, freedom from
pedagogy and the University and students with no rudiments of
interest in the geology he earned his daily bread by dinning into
their obdurate ears. Freedom from&mdash;</p>

<p>Abruptly the delightful somnolence crashed about him.
Somewhere outside the sound of tin shrieking across tin slashed
into his peace. George Campbell sat up jerkily and reached for
his flashlight. Then he laughed and put it down again, straining
his eyes through the midnight gloom outside where among the
tumbling cans of his supplies a dark anonymous little night beast
was prowling. He stretched out a long arm and groped about among
the rocks at the tent door for a missile. His fingers closed on a
large stone, and he drew back his hand to throw.</p>

<p>But he never threw it. It was such a queer thing he had come
upon in the dark. Square, crystal smooth, obviously artificial,
with dull rounded corners. The strangeness of its rock surfaces
to his fingers was so remarkable that he reached again for his
flashlight and turned its rays upon the thing he held.</p>

<p>All sleepiness left him as he saw what it was he had picked up
in his idle groping. It was clear as rock crystal, this queer,
smooth cube. Quartz, unquestionably, but not in its usual
hexagonal crystallized form. Somehow&mdash;he could not guess
the method&mdash;it had been wrought into a perfect cube, about
four inches in measurement over each worn face. For it was
incredibly worn. The hard, hard crystal was rounded now until its
corners were almost gone and the thing was beginning to assume
the outlines of a sphere. Ages and ages of wearing, years almost
beyond counting, must have passed over this strange clear
thing.</p>

<p>But the most curious thing of all was that shape he could make
out dimly in the heart of the crystal. For imbedded in its center
lay a little disc of a pale and nameless substance with
characters incised deep upon its quartz-enclosed surface. Wedge-
shaped characters, faintly reminiscent of cuneiform writing.</p>

<p>George Campbell wrinkled his brows and bent closer above the
little enigma in his hands, puzzling helplessly. How could such a
thing as this have imbedded in pure rock crystal? Remotely a
memory floated through his mind of ancient legends that called
quartz crystals ice which had frozen too hard to melt again.
Ice&mdash;and wedge-shaped cuneiforms&mdash;yes, didn't that sort
of writing originate among the Sumerians who came down from the
north in history's remotest beginnings to settle in the primitive
Mesopotamian valley? Then hard sense regained control and he
laughed. Quartz, of course, was formed in the earliest of earth's
geological periods, when there was nothing anywhere but heat and
heaving rock. Ice had not come for tens of millions of years
after this thing must have been formed.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;that writing. Man-made, surely, although its
characters were unfamiliar save in their faint hinting at
cuneiform shapes. Or could there, in a Paleozoic world, have been
things with a written language who might have graven these
cryptic wedges upon the quartz-enveloped disc he held? Or
&mdash;might a thing like this have fallen meteor-like out of
space into the unformed rock of a still molten world? Could
it&mdash;</p>

<p>Then he caught himself up sharply and felt his ears going hot
at the luridness of his own imagination. The silence and the
solitude and the queer thing in his hands were conspiring to play
tricks with his common sense. He shrugged and laid the crystal
down at the edge of his pallet, switching off the light. Perhaps
morning and a clear head would bring him an answer to the
questions that seemed so insoluble now.</p>

<p>But sleep did not come easily. For one thing, it seemed to him
as he flashed off the light, that the little cube had shone for a
moment as if with sustained light before it faded into the
surrounding dark. Or perhaps he was wrong. Perhaps it had been
only his dazzled eyes that seemed to see the light forsake it
reluctantly, glowing in the enigmatic deeps of the thing with
queer persistence.</p>

<p>He lay there unquietly for a long while, turning the
unanswered questions over and over in his mind. There was
something about this crystal cube out of the unmeasured past,
perhaps from the dawn of all history, that constituted a
challenge that would not let him sleep.</p><br>

<h3>[A. MERRITT]</h3>

<p class="first">He lay there, it seemed to him, for hours. It
had been the lingering light, the luminescence that seemed so
reluctant to die, which held his mind. It was as though something
in the heart of the cube had awakened, stirred drowsily, become
suddenly alert... and intent upon him.</p>

<p>Sheer fantasy, this. He stirred impatiently and flashed his
light upon his watch. Close to one o'clock; three hours more
before the dawn. The beam fell and was focused upon the warm
crystal cube. He held it there closely, for minutes. He snapped
it out, then watched.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it now. As his eyes accustomed
themselves to the darkness, he saw that the strange crystal was
glimmering with tiny fugitive lights deep within it like threads
of sapphire lightnings. They were at its center and they seemed
to him to come from the pale disk with its disturbing markings.
And the disc itself was becoming larger... the markings shifting
shapes... the cube was growing... was it illusion brought about
by the tiny lightnings...</p>

<p>He heard a sound. It was the very ghost of a sound, like the
ghosts of harp strings being plucked with ghostly fingers. He
bent closer. It came from the cube...</p>

<p>There was squeaking in the underbrush, a flurry of bodies and
an agonized wailing like a child in death throes and swiftly
stilled. Some small tragedy of the wilderness, killer and prey.
He stepped over to where it had been enacted, but could see
nothing. He again snapped off the flash and looked toward his
tent. Upon the ground was a pale blue glimmering. It was the
cube. He stooped to pick it up; then obeying some obscure
warning, drew back his hand.</p>

<p>And again, he saw, its glow was dying. The tiny sapphire
lightnings flashing fitfully, withdrawing to the disc from which
they had come. There was no sound from it.</p>

<p>He sat, watching the luminescence glow and fade, glow and
fade, but steadily becoming dimmer. It came to him that two
elements were necessary to produce the phenomenon. The electric
ray itself, and his own fixed attention. His mind must travel
along the ray, fix itself upon the cube's heart, if its beat were
to wax, until... what?</p>

<p>He felt a chill of spirit, as though from contact with some
alien thing. It was alien, he knew it; not of this earth. Not of
earth's life. He conquered his shrinking, picked up the cube and
took it into the tent. It was neither warm nor cold; except for
its weight he would not have known he held it. He put it upon the
table, keeping the torch turned from it; then stepped to the flap
of the tent and closed it.</p>

<p>He went back to the table, drew up the camp chair, and turned
the flash directly upon the cube, focusing it so far as he could
upon its heart. He sent all his will, all his concentration,
along it; focusing will and sight upon the disc as he had the
light.</p>

<p>As though at command, the sapphire lightnings burned forth.
They burst from the disc into the body of the crystal cube, then
beat back, bathing the disc and the markings. Again these began
to change, shifting, moving, advancing, and retreating in the
blue gleaming. They were no longer cuneiform. They were things...
objects.</p>

<p>He heard the murmuring music, the plucked harp strings. Louder
grew the sound and louder, and now all the body of the cube
vibrated to their rhythm. The crystal walls were melting, growing
misty as though formed of the mist of diamonds. And the disc
itself was growing... the shapes shifting, dividing and
multiplying as though some door had been opened and into it
companies of phantasms were pouring. While brighter, more bright
grew the pulsing light.</p>

<p>He felt swift panic, tried to withdraw sight and will, dropped
the flash. The cube had no need now of the ray... and he could
not withdraw... could not withdraw? Why, he himself was being
sucked into that disc which was now a globe within which
unnameable shapes danced to a music that bathed the globe with
steady radiance.</p>

<p>There was no tent. There was only a vast curtain of sparkling
mist behind which shone the globe... He felt himself drawn
through that mist, sucked through it as if by a mighty wind,
straight for the globe.</p><br>

<h3>[H.P. LOVECRAFT]</h3>

<p class="first">As the mist-blurred light of the sapphire suns
grew more and more intense, the outlines of the globe ahead
wavered and dissolved to a churning chaos. Its pallor and its
motion and its music all blended themselves with the engulfing
mist-bleaching it to a pale steel-colour and setting it
undulantly in motion. And the sapphire suns, too, melted
imperceptibly into the greying infinity of shapeless
pulsation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sense of forward, outward motion grew
intolerably, incredibly, cosmically swift. Every standard of
speed known to earth seemed dwarfed, and Campbell knew that any
such flight in physical reality would mean instant death to a
human being. Even as it was&mdash;in this strange, hellish
hypnosis or nightmare&mdash;the quasi-visual impression of
meteor-like hurtling almost paralyzed his mind. Though there were
no real points of reference in the grey, pulsing void, he felt
that he was approaching and passing the speed of light itself.
Finally his consciousness did go under&mdash;and merciful
blackness swallowed everything.</p>

<p>It was very suddenly, and amidst the most impenetrable
darkness, that thoughts and ideas again came to George Campbell.
Of how many moments&mdash;or years&mdash;or eternities&mdash;had
elapsed since his flight through the grey void, he could form no
estimate. He knew only that he seemed to be at rest and without
pain. Indeed, the absence of all physical sensation was the
salient quality of his condition. It made even the blackness seem
less solidly black&mdash;suggesting as it did that he was rather
a disembodied intelligence in a state beyond physical senses,
than a corporeal being with senses deprived of their accustomed
objects of perception. He could think sharply and quickly
&mdash;almost preternaturally so&mdash;yet could form no idea
whatsoever of his situation.</p>

<p>Half by instinct, he realised that he was not in his own tent.
True, he might have awaked there from a nightmare to a world
equally black; yet he knew this was not so. There was no camp cot
beneath him&mdash;he had no hands to feel the blankets and canvas
surface and flashlight that ought to be around him&mdash;there
was no sensation of cold in the air&mdash;no flap through which
he could glimpse the pale night outside... something was wrong,
dreadfully wrong.</p>

<p>He cast his mind backward and thought of the fluorescent cube
which had hypnotised him&mdash;of that, and all which had
followed. He had known that his mind was going, yet had been
unable to draw back. At the last moment there had been a
shocking, panic fear&mdash;a subconscious fear beyond even that
caused by the sensation of daemonic flight. It had come from some
vague flash or remote recollection&mdash;just what, he could not
at once tell. Some cell-group in the back of his head had seemed
to find a cloudily familiar quality in the cube&mdash;and that
familiarity was fraught with dim terror. Now he tried to remember
what the familiarity and the terror were.</p>

<p>Little by little it came to him. Once&mdash;long ago, in
connection with his geological life-work&mdash;he had read of
something like that cube. It had to do with those debatable and
disquieting clay fragments called the Eltdown Shards, dug up from
pre-carboniferous strata in southern England thirty years before.
Their shape and markings were so queer that a few scholars hinted
at artificiality, and made wild conjectures about them and their
origin. They came, clearly, from a time when no human beings
could exist on the globe&mdash;but their contours and figurings
were damnably puzzling. That was how they got their name.</p>

<p>It was not, however, in the writings of any sober scientist
that Campbell had seen that reference to a crystal, disc-holding
globe. The source was far less reputable, and infinitely more
vivid. About 1912 a deeply learned Sussex clergyman of occultist
leanings&mdash;the Reverend Arthur Brooke Winters-Hall&mdash;had
professed to identify the markings on the Eltdown Shards with
some of the so-called "pre-human hieroglyphs" persistently
cherished and esoterically handed down in certain mystical
circles, and had published at his own expense what purported to
be a "translation" of the primal and baffling
"inscriptions"&mdash;a "translation" still quoted frequently and
seriously by occult writers. In this "translation'&mdash;a
surprisingly long brochure in view of the limited number of
"shards" existing&mdash;had occurred the narrative, supposedly of
pre-human authorship, containing the now frightening
reference.</p>

<p>As the story went, there dwelt on a world&mdash;and eventually
on countless other worlds&mdash;of outer space a mighty order of
worm-like beings whose attainments and whose control of nature
surpassed anything within the range of terrestrial imagination.
They had mastered the art of interstellar travel early in their
career, and had peopled every habitable planet in their own
galaxy&mdash;killing off the races they found.</p>

<p>Beyond the limits of their own galaxy&mdash;which was not
ours&mdash;they could not navigate in person; but in their quest
for knowledge of all space and time they discovered a means of
spanning certain transgalactic gulfs with their minds. They
devised peculiar objects&mdash;strangely energized cubes of a
curious crystal containing hypnotic talismans and enclosed in
space-resisting spherical envelopes of an unknown
substance&mdash;which could be forcibly expelled beyond the
limits of their universe, and which would respond to the
attraction of cool solid matter only.</p>

<p>These, of which a few would necessarily land on various
inhabited worlds in outside universes, formed the ether-bridges
needed for mental communication. Atmospheric friction burned away
the protecting envelope, leaving the cube exposed and subject to
discovery by the intelligent minds of the world where it fell. By
its very nature, the cube would attract and rivet attention.
This, when coupled with the action of light, was sufficient to
set its special properties working.</p>

<p>The mind that noticed the cube would be drawn into it by the
power of the disc, and would be sent on a thread of obscure
energy to the place whence the disc had come&mdash;the remote
world of the worm-like space explorers across stupendous galactic
abysses. Received in one of the machines to which each cube was
attuned, the captured mind would remain suspended without body or
senses until examined by one of the dominant race. Then it would,
by an obscure process of interchange, be pumped of all its
contents. The investigator's mind would now occupy the strange
machine while the captive mind occupied the interrogator's worm-
like body. Then, in another interchange, the interrogator's mind
would leap across boundless space to the captive's vacant and
unconscious body on the trans-galactic world&mdash;animating the
alien tenement as best it might, and exploring the alien world in
the guise of one of its denizens.</p>

<p>When done with exploration, the adventurer would use the cube
and its disc in accomplishing his return&mdash;and sometimes the
captured mind would be restored safely to its own remote world.
Not always, however, was the dominant race so kind. Sometimes,
when a potentially important race capable of space travel was
found, the worm-like folk would employ the cube to capture and
annihilate minds by the thousands, and would extirpate the race
for diplomatic reasons&mdash;using the exploring minds as agents
of destruction.</p>

<p>In other cases sections of the worm-folk would permanently
occupy a trans-galactic planet&mdash;destroying the captured
minds and wiping out the remaining inhabitants preparatory to
settling down in unfamiliar bodies. Never, however, could the
parent civilization be quite duplicated in such a case; since the
new planet would not contain all the materials necessary for the
worm-race's arts. The cubes, for example, could be made only on
the home planet.</p>

<p>Only a few of the numberless cubes sent forth ever found a
landing and response on an inhabited world&mdash;since there was
no such thing as aiming them at goals beyond sight or knowledge.
Only three, ran the story, had ever landed on peopled worlds in
our own particular universe. One of these had struck a planet
near the galactic rim two thousand billion years ago, while
another had lodged three billion years ago on a world near the
centre of the galaxy. The third&mdash;and the only one ever known
to have invaded the solar system&mdash;had reached our own earth
150,000,000 years ago.</p>

<p>It was with this latter that Dr. Winters-Hall's "translation"
chiefly dealt. When the cube struck the earth, he wrote, the
ruling terrestrial species was a huge, cone-shaped race
surpassing all others before or since in mentality and
achievements. This race was so advanced that it had actually sent
minds abroad in both space and time to explore the cosmos, hence
recognised something of what had happened when the cube fell from
the sky and certain individuals had suffered mental change after
gazing at it.</p>

<p>Realising that the changed individuals represented invading
minds, the race's leaders had them destroyed&mdash;even at the
cost of leaving the displaced minds exiled in alien space. They
had had experience with even stranger transitions. When, through
a mental exploration of space and time, they formed a rough idea
of what the cube was, they carefully hid the thing from light and
sight, and guarded it as a menace. They did not wish to destroy a
thing so rich in later experimental possibilities. Now and then
some rash, unscrupulous adventurer would furtively gain access to
it and sample its perilous powers despite the
consequences&mdash;but all such cases were discovered, and safely
and drastically dealt with.</p>

<p>Of this evil meddling the only bad result was that the worm-
like outside race learned from the new exiles what had happened
to their explorers on earth, and conceived a violent hatred of
the planet and all its life-forms. They would have depopulated it
if they could, and indeed sent additional cubes into space in the
wild hope of striking it by accident in unguarded
places&mdash;but that accident never came to pass.</p>

<p>The cone-shaped terrestrial beings kept the one existing cube
in a special shrine as a relique and basis for experiments, till
after aeons it was lost amidst the chaos of war and the
destruction of the great polar city where it was guarded. When,
fifty million years ago, the beings sent their minds ahead into
the infinite future to avoid a nameless peril of inner earth, the
whereabouts of the sinister cube from space were unknown.</p>

<p>This much, according to the learned occultist, the Eltdown
Shards had said. What now made the account so obscurely frightful
to Campbell was the minute accuracy with which the alien cube had
been described. Every detail tallied&mdash;dimensions,
consistency, heiroglyphed central disc, hypnotic effects. As he
thought the matter over and over amidst the darkness of his
strange situation, he began to wonder whether his whole
experience with the crystal cube&mdash;indeed, its very
existence&mdash;were not a nightmare brought on by some freakish
subconscious memory of this old bit of extravagant, charlatanic
reading. If so, though, the nightmare must still be in force;
since his present apparently bodiless state had nothing of
normality in it.</p>

<p>Of the time consumed by this puzzled memory and reflection,
Campbell could form no estimate. Everything about his state was
so unreal that ordinary dimensions and measurements became
meaningless. It seemed an eternity, but perhaps it was not really
long before the sudden interruption came. What happened was as
strange and inexplicable as the blackness it succeeded. There was
a sensation&mdash;of the mind rather than of the body&mdash;and
all at once Campbell felt his thoughts swept or sucked beyond his
control in tumultuous and chaotic fashion.</p>

<p>Memories arose irresponsibly and irrelevantly. All that he
knew&mdash;all his personal background, traditions, experiences,
scholarship, dreams, ideas, and inspirations&mdash;welled up
abruptly and simultaneously, with a dizzying speed and abundance
which soon made him unable to keep track of any separate concept.
The parade of all his mental contents became an avalanche, a
cascade, a vortex. It was as horrible and vertiginous as his
hypnotic flight through space when the crystal cube pulled him.
Finally it sapped his consciousness and brought on fresh
oblivion.</p>

<p>Another measureless blank&mdash;and then a slow trickle of
sensation. This time it was physical, not mental. Sapphire light,
and a low rumble of distant sound. There were tactile
impressions&mdash;he could realise that he was lying at full
length on something, though there was a baffling strangeness
about the feel of his posture. He could not reconcile the
pressure of the supporting surface with his own outlines&mdash;or
with the outlines of the human form at all. He tried to move his
arms, but found no definite response to the attempt. Instead,
there were little, ineffectual nervous twitches all over the area
which seemed to mark his body.</p>

<p>He tried to open his eyes more widely, but found himself
unable to control their mechanism. The sapphire light came in a
diffused, nebulous manner, and could nowhere be voluntarily
focussed into definiteness. Gradually, though, visual images
began to trickle in curiously and indecisively. The limits and
qualities of vision were not those which he was used to, but he
could roughly correlate the sensation with what he had known as
sight. As this sensation gained some degree of stability,
Campbell realised that he must still be in the throes of
nightmare.</p>

<p>He seemed to be in a room of considerable extent&mdash;of
medium height, but with a large proportionate area. On every
side&mdash;and he could apparently see all four sides at
once&mdash;were high, narrowish slits which seemed to serve as
combined doors and windows. There were singular low tables or
pedestals, but no furniture of normal nature and proportions.
Through the slits streamed floods of sapphire light, and beyond
them could be mistily seen the sides and roofs of fantastic
buildings like clustered cubes. On the walls&mdash;in the
vertical panels between the slits&mdash;were strange markings of
an oddly disquieting character. It was some time before Campbell
understood why they disturbed him so&mdash;then he saw that they
were, in repeated instances, precisely like some of the
hieroglyphs on the crystal cube's disc.</p>

<p>The actual nightmare element, though, was something more than
this. It began with the living thing which presently entered
through one of the slits, advancing deliberately toward him and
bearing a metal box of bizarre proportions and glassy, mirror-
like surfaces. For this thing was nothing human&mdash;nothing of
earth&mdash;nothing even of man's myths and dreams. It was a
gigantic, pale-grey worm or centipede, as large around as a man
and twice as long, with a disc-like, apparently eyeless, cilia-
fringed head bearing a purple central orifice. It glided on its
rear pairs of legs, with its fore part raised
vertically&mdash;the legs, or at least two pairs of them, serving
as arms. Along its spinal ridge was a curious purple comb, and a
fan-shaped tail of some grey membrane ended its grotesque bulk.
There was a ring of flexible red spikes around its neck, and from
the twistings of these came clicking, twanging sounds in
measured, deliberate rhythms.</p>

<p>Here, indeed, was outr&eacute; nightmare at its
height&mdash;capricious fantasy at its apex. But even this vision
of delirium was not what caused George Campbell to lapse a third
time into unconsciousness. It took one more thing&mdash;one
final, unbearable touch&mdash;to do that. As the nameless worm
advanced with its glistening box, the reclining man caught in the
mirror-like surface a glimpse of what should have been his own
body. Yet&mdash;horribly verifying his disordered and unfamiliar
sensations&mdash;it was not his own body at all that he saw
reflected in the burnished metal. It was, instead, the loathsome,
pale-grey bulk of one of the great centipedes.</p><br>

<h3>[ROBERT E. HOWARD &amp; FRANK BELKNAP LONG]</h3>

<p class="first">From that final lap of senselessness, he emerged
with a full understanding of his situation. His mind was
imprisoned in the body of a frightful native of an alien planet,
while, somewhere on the other side of the universe, his own body
was housing the monster's personality.</p>

<p>He fought down an unreasoning horror. Judged from a cosmic
standpoint, why should his metamorphosis horrify him? Life and
consciousness were the only realities in the universe. Form was
unimportant. His present body was hideous only according to
terrestrial standards. Fear and revulsion were drowned in the
excitement of titanic adventure.</p>

<p>What was his former body but a cloak, eventually to be cast
off at death anyway? He had no sentimental illusions about the
life from which he had been exiled. What had it ever given him
save toil, poverty, continual frustration and repression? If this
life before him offered no more, at least it offered no less.
Intuition told him it offered more&mdash;much more.</p>

<p>With the honesty possible only when life is stripped to its
naked fundamentals, he realized that he remembered with pleasure
only the physical delights of his former life. But he had long
ago exhausted all the physical possibilities contained in that
earthly body. Earth held no new thrills. But in the possession of
this new, alien body he felt promises of strange, exotic
joys.</p>

<p>A lawless exultation rose in him. He was a man without a
world, free of all conventions or inhibitions of Earth, or of
this strange planet, free of every artificial restraint in the
universe. He was a god! With grim amusement he thought of his
body moving in earth's business and society, with all the while
an alien monster staring out of the windows that were George
Campbell's eyes on people who would flee !f they knew.</p>

<p>Let him walk the earth slaying and destroying as he would.
Earth and its races no longer had any meaning to George Campbell.
There he had been one of a billion nonentities, fixed in place by
a mountainous accumulation of conventions, laws and manners,
doomed to live and die in his sordid niche. But in one blind
bound he had soared above the commonplace. This was not death,
but re-birth&mdash;the birth of a full-grown mentality, with a
new-found freedom that made little of physical captivity on
Yekub.</p>

<p>He started. Yekub! It was the name of this planet, but how had
he known? Then he knew, as he knew the name of him whose body he
occupied&mdash;Tothe. Memory, deep grooved in Tothe's brain, was
stirring in him&mdash;shadows of the knowledge Tothe had. Carved
deep in the physical tissues of the brain, they spoke dimly as
implanted instincts to George Campbell; and his human
consciousness seized them and translated them to show him the way
not only to safety and freedom, but to the power his soul,
stripped to its primitive impulses, craved. Not as a slave would
he dwell on Yekub, but as a king! Just as of old barbarians had
sat on the throne of lordly empires.</p>

<p>For the first time he turned his attention to his
surroundings. He still lay on the couch-like thing in the midst
of that fantastic room, and the centipede man stood before him,
holding the polished metal object, and clashing its neck-spikes.
Thus it spoke to him, Campbell knew, and what it said he dimly
understood, through the implanted thought processes of Tothe,
just as he knew the creature was Yukth, supreme lord of
science.</p>

<p>But Campbell gave no heed, for he had made his desperate plan,
a plan so alien to the ways of Yekub that !t was beyond Yukth's
comprehension and caught him wholly unprepared. Yukth, like
Campbell, saw the sharp-pointed metal shard on a nearby table,
but to Yukth !t was only a scientific implement. He did not even
know it could be used as a weapon. Campbell's earthly mind
supplied the knowledge and the action that followed, driving
Tothe's body into movements no man of Yekub had ever made
before.</p>

<p>Campbell snatched the pointed shard and struck, ripping
savagely upward. Yukth reared and toppled, his entrails spilling
on the floor. In an instant Campbell was streaking for a door.
His speed was amazing, exhilarating, first fulfillment of the
promise of novel physical sensations.</p>

<p>As he ran, guided wholly by the instinctive knowledge
implanted in Tothe's physical reflexes, it was as if he were
borne by a separate consciousness in his legs. Tothe's body was
bearing him along a route it had traversed ten thousand times
when animated by Tothe's mind.</p>

<p>Down a winding corridor he raced, up a twisted stair, through
a carved door, and the same instincts that had brought him there
told him he had found what he sought. He was in a circular room
with a domed roof from which shone a livid blue light. A strange
structure rose in the middle of the rainbow-hued floor, tier on
tier, each of a separate, vivid color. The ultimate tier was a
purple cone, from the apex of which a blue smoky mist drifted
upward to a sphere that poised in mid-air&mdash;a sphere that
shone like translucent ivory.</p>

<p>This, the deep-grooved memories of Tothe told Campbell, was
the god of Yekub, though why the people of Yekub feared and
worshipped it had been forgotten a million years. A worm-priest
stood between him and the altar which no hand of flesh had ever
touched. That it could be touched was a blasphemy that had never
occurred to a man of Yekub. The worm-priest stood in frozen
horror until Campbell's shard ripped the life out of him.</p>

<p>On his centipede-legs Campbell clambered the tiered altar,
heedless of its sudden quiverings, heedless of the change that
was taking place in the floating sphere, heedless of the smoke
that now billowed out in blue clouds. He was drunk with the feel
of power. He feared the superstitions of Yekub no more than he
feared those of earth. With that globe in his hands he would be
king of Yekub. The worm men would dare deny him nothing, when he
held their god as hostage. He reached a hand for the
ball&mdash;no longer ivory-hued, but red as blood...</p><br>

<h3>[FRANK BELKNAP LONG]</h3>

<p class="first">Out of the tent into the pale August night
walked the body of George Campbell. It moved with a slow,
wavering gait between the bodies of enormous trees, over a forest
path strewed with sweet scented pine needles. The air was crisp
and cold. The sky was an inverted bowl of frosted silver flecked
with stardust, and far to the north the Aurora Borealis splashed
streamers of fire.</p>

<p>The head of the walking man lolled hideously from side to
side. From the corners of his lax mouth drooled thick threads of
amber froth, which fluttered in the night breeze. He walked
upright at first, as a man would walk, but gradually as the tent
receded, his posture altered. His torso began almost
imperceptibly to slant, and his limbs to shorten.</p>

<p>In a far-off world of outer space the centipede creature that
was George Campbell clasped to ts bosom a god whose lineaments
were red as blood, and ran with insect-like quiverings across a
rainbow-hued hall and out through massive portals into the bright
glow of alien suns.</p>

<p>Weaving between the trees of earth in an attitude that
suggested the awkward loping of a werebeast, the body of George
Campbell was fulfilling a mindless destiny. Long, claw-tipped
fingers dragged leaves from a carpet of odorous pine needles as
it moved toward a wide expanse of gleaming water.</p>

<p>In the far-off, extra-galactic world of the worm people,
George Campbell moved between cyclopean blocks of black masonry
down long, fern-planted avenues holding aloft the round red
god.</p>

<p>There was a harsh animal cry in the underbrush near the
gleaming lake on earth where the mind of a worm creature dwelt in
a body swayed by instinct. Human teeth sank into soft animal fur,
tore at black animal flesh. A little silver fox sank its fangs in
frantic retaliation into a furry human wrist, and thrashed about
in terror as its blood spurted. Slowly the body of George
Campbell arose, its mouth splashed with fresh blood. With upper
limbs swaying oddly it moved towards the waters of the lake.</p>

<p>As the variform creature that was George Campbell crawled
between the black blocks of stone thousands of worm-shapes
prostrated themselves in the scintillating dust before it. A
godlike power seemed to emanate from its weaving body as it moved
with a slow, undulant motion toward a throne of spiritual empire
transcending all the sovereignties of earth.</p>

<p>A trapper stumbling wearily through the dense woods of earth
near the tent where the worm-creature dwelt in the body of George
Campbell came to the gleaming waters of the lake and discerned
something dark floating there. He had been lost in the woods all
night, and weariness enveloped him like a leaden cloak in the
pale morning light.</p>

<p>But the shape was a challenge that he could not ignore. Moving
to the edge of the water he knelt in the soft mud and reached out
toward the floating bulk. Slowly he pulled it to the shore.</p>

<p>Far off in outer space the worm-creature holding the glowing
red god ascended a throne that gleamed like the constellation
Cassiopeia under an alien vault of hyper-suns. The great deity
that he held aloft energized his worm tenement, burning away in
the white fire of a supermundane spirituality all animal
dross.</p>

<p>On earth the trapper gazed with unutterable horror into the
blackened and hairy face of the drowned man. It was a bestial
face, repulsively anthropoid in contour, and from its twisted,
distorted mouth black ichor poured.</p>

<p>"He who sought your body in the abysses of Time will occupy an
unresponsive tenement," said the red god. "No spawn of Yekub can
control the body of a human.</p>

<p>"On all earth, living creatures rend one another, and feast
with unutterable cruelty on their kith and kin. No worm-mind can
control a bestial man-body when it yearns to raven. Only man-
minds instinctively conditioned through the course of ten
thousand generations can keep the human instincts in thrall. Your
body will destroy itself on earth, seeking the blood of its
animal kin, seeking the cool water where it can wallow at its
ease. Seeking eventually destruction, for the death-instinct is
more powerful in it than the instincts of life and it will
destroy itself in seeking to return to the slime from which it
sprang."</p>

<p>Thus spoke the round red god of Yekub in a far-off segment of
the space-time continuum to George Campbell as the latter, with
all human desire purged away, sat on a throne and ruled an empire
of worms more wisely kindly, and benevolently than any man of
earth had ever ruled an empire of men.</p>
