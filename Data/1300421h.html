<h3><small>AN ACCOUNT<br>
<br>
<small>OF THE</small></small><br>
<br>
ORIGIN OF SLIDING KEELS,<br>
<br>
<small><small>AND THE</small><br>
<br>
ADVANTAGES RESULTING FROM THEIR USE.</small></h3>
<a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>
<h4><i>Advantages applicable to Ships in general when constructed
with Sliding Keels.</i></h4>
<p><small>THE</small> great utility of vessels constructed with
Sliding Keels, having been fully proved in the Lady Nelson, a
vessel of sixty tons burthen, sent on a Voyage of Discovery to
New South Wales, as will appear by the Narrative contained in the
following sheets, I am induced to believe this short account of
the rise, progress, and present state of the invention itself,
will not fail to give satisfaction to my Readers, many of whom,
though of the nautical profession, may not be thoroughly
acquainted with their construction and use.</p>
<p>The Sliding Keels, of which the annexed Plate will give a
clearer and more perfect idea than can be conveyed by words, is
an improvement in ship-building, for which this Country is (and
all maritime Europe will hereafter probably be,) indebted to the
skill and ingenuity of Captain John Schank, of the Royal Navy,
formerly one of the Commissioners of the Transport Board. This
Gentleman, during the American War, gave evident proofs of his
talent for invention and resource on the Lakes of that Continent,
and any attempt on my part to write his eulogy would be
superfluous: suffice it to say, that he has always distinguished
himself as the disinterested friend of mankind, and a sincere
well-wisher of his Country.</p>
<p>It was in America, during the fatal contest betwixt the Mother
Country and her Colonies, that Captain Schank obtained the favour
and patronage of his Grace the Duke of Northumberland, then Earl
Percy, who was on service there with his regiment. His Grace had
so long ago as that period discovered a taste for naval
architecture, the knowledge of which he now possesses in an
eminent degree. It was there in a conversation on the art of
ship-building, betwixt his Grace and Captain Schank, that the
idea of <i>Sliding Keels</i> first suggested itself to the
latter.</p>
<p>His Grace observing, that "if Cutters were built much flatter,
so as to go on the surface and not draw much water, they would
sail faster, and might still be enabled to carry as much sail,
and keep up to the wind, by having their Keels descend to a
greater depth; and that the flat side of the Keel when presented
to the water would even make them able to spread more canvas, and
hold the wind better, than on a construction whereby they present
only the circular surface of the body to the water." Captain
Schank coincided in this opinion, and observed, that if this
<i>deep Keel was made moveable, and to be screwed upwards into a
trunk or well formed within the vessel</i>, so as that on
necessity they might draw little water, all these advantages
might be obtained.</p>
<p>Captain Schank having maturely considered the principle thus
suggested, was fully convinced of its use and practicability, and
afterwards (viz. in 1774) solicited Lord Percy, then at Boston in
New England, to permit him to build a boat for his Lordship upon
that construction. He did so, and it was found to answer in every
respect.</p>
<p>In 1789 he built a boat at Deptford with three Sliding Keels,
and in the following year the Trial cutter at Plymouth. Since
that time Captain Schank has built a number of other vessels on
the same construction, three of which are at this time in the
service of Government: these are, the Trial cutter before
mentioned, the Cynthia sloop of war, and the Lady Nelson, the
smallest of the three; of the successful voyage to South Wales,
in the last of which, the following sheets contain the
narration.</p>
<p>All these vessels have proved the utility of this
construction, as will appear by the Certificates contained in the
Appendix. Other vessels might be mentioned, built on the account
of private persons with the like construction, which have been
found to answer every useful purpose.</p>
<p>Having now given a brief account of the origin of the
invention of Sliding Keels, I shall lay before my nautical and
other Readers the advantages resulting from their use; and this I
am enabled to do from Papers with which I have been favoured by
Captain Schank himself.</p>
<p>That Gentleman has comprehended their advantages under the six
following heads:&mdash;1. That vessels thus constructed will sail
faster, steer easier, and tack and wear quicker, and in less
room: 2. They will carry more, and draw less water: 3. They will
ride more easy at an anchor: 4. They will take the ground better:
5. In case of shipwreck, of springing a leak, or of a fire, they
are more safe and more likely to be saved: 6. And lastly, that
they will answer better as men of war, bombs, fire-ships,
floating batteries, gun boats, gun batteaux, and flat-bottomed
boats for landing troops.</p>
<p>1. With respect to vessels so constructed sailing faster, he
says; it has ever been his opinion, that a ship's sailing fast
does not so much depend upon her being sharp-built, as it does on
her depth in the water; because water is the less easy to divide
the deeper it is; to ascertain which, figures of different forms
may be sunk to greater or less depth. Such experiments have been
made by him, and their results have determined his predilection
of the Sliding Keel.&mdash;Suppose a frigate drawing seventeen
feet, and another alike in burthen drawing eleven; the last has a
body of six feet less to divide, opposing only three, two, or one
Keel, as may be found necessary to make her hold a good wind;
while the other has six feet depressed, or about one-third of her
real size opposing the water: of course she has a body of water
to displace and force through equal to the difference of eleven
feet to seventeen, and the deeper the stronger. North country
built vessels, or those in the coal trade, are proofs of this
observation. These vessels generally draw about one-third less
water than other English vessels; yet when employed as
Transports, they are found to sail as fast as any others; and
when going before the wind, in ballast or half loaded, they
frequently beat the King's ships. Now when these vessels come
close hauled on a wind they drop to leeward, but had they Sliding
Keels it may be presumed they would have the advantage of all
others. The Dutch take little pains to make their trading vessels
sail, yet when these are light they sail fast before the wind,
and this by reason of their small draught of water. That nation
has likewise other flat vessels; such as pilot boats, yagers for
carrying the first herrings to market, and pleasure boats, all of
which have lee-boards, by the help of which they sail as fast as
most other vessels in the Northern Seas. Vessels with Sliding
Keels will steer better, be safer, and receive many advantages in
consequence of steering easy and with little helm. The use of the
Sliding Keels in steering is seen in every action of the ship's
movement; by the Sliding Keels the ship's course is kept in a
more direct line, for the easier the ship steers the nearer she
goes on a given point, and the ship's hull, as well as the
stern-post, rudder, masts, rigging, and sails are less strained.
In place of two, three or four men at the helm, the largest ship
may be steered by one. This is a great advantage, for it is not
uncommon that vessels steer ill even in fresh breezes or light
winds, so as not to be able when the wind is on their quarter to
carry all their sails, and thereby are necessitated to go one or
two knots an hour slower. Through such defect, and with such a
wind, they lose in the twenty-four hours as many knots or double
that number. This in the distance, besides what may be lost in
longitude or latitude by an incorrect course. Hereby the loss of
the ship might be occasioned; for even with a good observation
the error of the longitude cannot be rectified. But if no
observation should happen to be taken, and the steerage be wild,
the error may be great, and the ship in danger in making the
land. But the worst consequence of a difficulty in steering is,
what it is to be feared has too frequently happened, though
rarely heard of, and that is the ship's broaching-to. This,
though sometimes the consequence of wild or careless steerage, is
more frequently occasioned by strong gales and high seas. Thus,
for instance, a ship scudding before the wind, or quartering,
having little sail set, and that low, such as a reefed fore-sail,
when between two seas, is almost becalmed, and therefore loses
her way: the next or following sea raises her stern, her bow
inclines downwards, the cutwater having a different direction
from the intended course, the stern by this is lifted so high
that the rudder has little or no power, it being almost out of
water. In this situation, the ship pressed on the lee-bow by the
water having got on the weather quarter and the ship on the top
of the sea, she flies with such violence as to bring her head
round; and then lying on the broadside she plunges with the
greatest velocity into a high or raging sea, the water breaks
into her, washing and carrying away every thing off the deck,
frequently some the crew; and it is to be feared by such
accidents vessels themselves go to the bottom, and are no more
heard of. Now there is nothing more clear and certain, than that
Sliding Keels counteract these dreadful effects; for in a fresh
breeze or light winds all possible sail may be made without
regard to the wind or on what mast sail is carried. The moment
sail is made, and the course shaped, the Keels may be raised or
lowered, until the ship is found to steer easy, and with little
helm, by which means quick progress is made, a straight or direct
course, and an easy ship. To prevent the dreadful accident of the
vessel's broaching-to, no more need be done than to heave the
main and fore Keels close up, and let down as much as is thought
necessary of the after Keel; and if enough of it is down, it is
impossible that any ship can meet with this accident. How
pleasing must this reflection prove to the minds of every one on
board; but more especially to him, with whom the ship's safety
and the lives of all on board are particularly intrusted, and
whose memory may suffer from an accident, which neither his
prudence could foresee, nor his presence of mind prevent; and of
which, perhaps, he himself falls the unfortunate victim!</p>
<p>Vessels having three or only two Sliding Keels must tack
quicker and in less room, because the foremost Keel and the after
one have each an effect on them nearly equal to the rudder.
Therefore when going about or working to windward in a narrow
channel, river, &amp;c. where the vessel has little room, they
may venture to stand nearer the shore, being more certain of not
missing stays. Thus, for instance, in tacking or going about, it
has been experienced that to heave up the after-keel and let the
fore-keel close down, at the same time putting the helm a-lee,
will make the vessel come much faster round than if she was
without Sliding Keels. Indeed, in the latter case, the difference
is so great, that it is as much as the men can do to work or
attend the sails, and in a fresh gale they can scarcely trim them
in time. The next advantage from the fore-keel is, that being
hove up as soon as the ship is right with her head to the wind,
it remains ready to prevent what happens to most square-rigged
vessels, her falling round off, and thereby losing a deal of
ground, time and tide: therefore the instant the sails are full,
and the vessel has hauled off, and is falling off more, the
fore-keel must be hove down which will stop her, and with the
least headway she flies to as fast as if coming about; and even
must be prevented coming round by again raising the fore-keel a
little up. Vessels with this construction wanting to wear are to
heave up the fore-keel, and heave down the after-keel; and if it
be requisite to wear very quick the main-keel should be hove up
also; vessels will then turn or come round as if upon a pivot,
the rudder being used at the same time as in common cases. The
reason of this is plain; for the fore and main keels being up and
the after-keel down, the latter acts as a rudder, and hinders
reaching, the effect of it being not unlike what would be
produced by a rope fastened to the stern of a vessel in the
tide's way, which the moment her head is at liberty would swing
round with her stern to the tide. In the same manner a vessel
drawing more water aft than forward, when she takes the ground
with her keel, turns her head round from the sea or tide.</p>
<p>2. Vessels constructed with Sliding Keels will carry more
freight, and draw less water. It is well known to every person
conversant in naval architecture, that different constructions of
vessels cause a difference in the quantity carried. Vessels sharp
fore and aft lose a great deal of stowage, and some of them carry
the floor so straight and narrow the whole of their length, that
by looking down into their holds the difference is easily
discernible by the eye. For this reason it is impossible a true
measurement can be made, so that, notwithstanding all that has
been written on the subject by mathematicians of different
nations, no method will ever be discovered to ascertain a true
measurement of vessels until they shall be built more alike. It
has been observed that some vessels of the same measurement would
not take in near the quantity they measured, whilst others took
in more than theirs, and, moreover, carried it with ease. But if
vessels sharp-built could be brought to hold their measurement
they would not be able to carry it, owing to their sharpness
forward, which would cause them to pitch and ship water. This
difference is constantly to be observed as proceeding from the
vessel's construction. Sharp vessels go down so fast, that by the
time they come to their bearings they are full, and frequently
not near loaded; whereas those of flat and long floors go down
slowly, and having the quantity according to what they measure,
have still room for more, and are high out of the water. The
improvements, therefore, which remain to be made in
ship-building, must be tried on a long and flat floor; and by
improvements herein, there is a promise of every advantage that
can be derived from the use of shipping. On the plan of long and
flat floors every thing can be obtained, except working to
windward; and if Sliding Keels answer the expectation hoped from
them in that respect, the point is gained, and vessels will in
general hold more than they can carry; whereas at present the
contrary is the case with sharp-built vessels.</p>
<p>That vessels thus constructed will draw less water is
demonstrable, from the largest vessel in the world to the Indian
canoe. The collier, the coal lighter, corn barge, bean cod, all
afford proofs that the flatter a vessel is, the less water she
draws; because the more space a body covers on the surface of the
water the less it will sink in it.</p>
<p>3. Vessels constructed in the manner herein described will be
more easy at an anchor, by the same reason that they sail faster,
carry more, and draw less water. In proof of this assertion the
same instances may be adduced. The north country shipping, and
Dutch fishing vessels, ride at an anchor when no other vessels
can; and this because they have long floors, are full fore and
aft, rise and fall easier, that is to say, do not pitch or plunge
so violently as sharp-built vessels, but have a rolling motion
when at anchor, which greatly lessens their pitching and
plunging. In consequence, they do not strain the cables or
anchors, or the bull, so much as vessels built on a sharp
construction. It is a great advantage in navigation to be able to
ride at anchor safely. Voyages may be undertaken with such
security, that durst not be attempted in vessels that do not ride
well at anchor. One of the reasons why Captain Cook gave a
preference to a North country collier for his voyages of
circumnavigation was, that they more nearly possessed all these
qualities now mentioned.</p>
<p>4. Vessels constructed in this manner will take the ground
better, and sit upright and easier than others. Flat-floored
vessels, not having a rank keel, when on the ground sit so that
every part of their bottom, from the forming of the entrance
forward to the run abaft, bear equally on it; therefore, unless
the ground be as perpendicular as their sides, little danger can
be apprehended. If the sand or rock be the length of the ship's
bottom, or whatever length it be, if nearly even or flat, so much
of the vessel's bottom will rest on the ground, and she will
certainly not be strained so much as if only a small part of the
middle of the vessel touched; which must be the case with a
sharp-built vessel. They who have seen vessels take the ground
must have observed, that sharp-built vessels, (in which number
may be included the ships of war of all nations, the Dutch
excepted) the instant they do so, heel in proportion as the water
leaves them. Supposing a frigate in this situation, when the
water is gone from her, the gun-wale would be little more than
the height of a man from the ground, and the ship would lay along
so much that no one could walk the deck. Thus situated the vessel
would strain so much from the weight of her mast, guns, rigging,
&amp;c. that she would be ruined, even if she were to get off.
But if on the flowing of the tide it blows the least wind, so
that the necessary assistance cannot be given her in the act of
righting, she will be filled with water by the hatchway before it
flows high enough to float her. Suppose a flat and sharp vessel
in company, and both running aground in a sea, the flat vessel
runs on or sticks fast, in either of which cases she sits
upright, but the sharp vessel heels in both. The heel the latter
takes exposes her to the sea breaking upon her, and by that means
either filling her or washing the crew off the deck: whereas the
vessel which sits upright runs none of these risks, and unless
the bottom is beat out, the chance of saving crew, ship and cargo
is greatly in favour of the flat-floored vessel. This is so well
known to seamen, that both English and Dutch flat-floored vessels
coming into harbours where the ground is even, no matter whether
soft or hard so it be smooth, have run aground in the hardest
gales rather than be at the trouble or risk of bringing up: by
this means they avoid the danger of breaking their cables and
anchors, or running on board other vessels. It is remembered that
a fleet of transports, coming into Cork Harbour for troops in a
hard gale, did so, when a sharp vessel, through mistake,
following the example was nearly lost.</p>
<p>5. In cases of shipwreck, springing a leak, or of fire,
vessels thus constructed are safer, and more likely to be saved.
The reasons last given explain the advantages such vessels have
in case of shipwreck; however, it may be added, that the vessels
thus recommended would possess a superior degree of security if
built as nearly as can be solid; that is, all the frame of timber
put so close as to be caulked in the same manner as the plank on
the outside. And if the plank or ceiling of the inside were
equally caulked, the vessel by this means would be much stronger,
and of course would bear more beating on the rocks, sands,
&amp;c.: then if the rocks, &amp;c. occasion a leak, if this leak
does not go through, it will be stopt in its progress by the
caulking: but if it does go through, it will more readily be
heard, and of course more easily come at to be stopt. If a rock
is the cause of the damage, and it goes half way or two-thirds
through and sticks in the vessel, it becomes a plug for the hole
it makes; and if it drop out, even then it will not occasion a
leak. But if the vessel be divided into many equal rooms or
different holds,* supposing a hole to be so large that all the
pumps in the ship, and twenty more, cannot clear away the water
that rushes in, it will then only come into that single part or
division in which the leak happens to be, and will flow in no
longer than till it is raised withinside to the level of the sea
without. The vessel would in this case be in no more danger than
before, nor would the hull be loaded or depressed in the water.
The difference of construction prevents a flat vessel from
oversetting as soon as a sharp vessel; and her sitting up right
admits of her crew working and loading, or unloading her, as the
circumstances may require. Add to all this, that inestimable
advantage which the one vessel has over the other, of drawing so
little water. By this the flat vessel is enabled to sail over
those very rocks on which the sharp-built one will strike; and
admits of the former going into shallow water, where the violence
of the sea becomes less and less the nearer she approaches the
shore.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Captain Schank is here alluding to his
recommendation of dividing the hold of vessels by separate
bulkheads, sufficiently secured against any communication of
water from the one to the other, except by cocks in case of
necessity.]</p>
<p>The reasons given why vessels built upon this construction
stand a better chance of being saved, in case of shipwreck, will
in a great measure apply to the circumstance of a ship springing
a leak at sea, as the effect and appearance of the one correspond
with the other, though proceeding from different causes. In the
former case you are supposed to be forced on the shore or rocks
by the sea, wind or tide, but in the latter to be in the ocean on
your voyage at a great distance from land: your ship springs a
leak which seriously alarms you; you see that you cannot pump out
the water; your cocks in the bulkheads being turned directly,
shew in what part of the ship the leak is; you then try with all
your pumps to empty this hold, division, or room; not being able
to pump it out, you try to get out of that part of the vessel
what is in it, and if you can only see the bottom of the ship you
will see the leak, and it must be directly stopt. Whereas, in the
present construction of ships, the great inconvenience is, that
the water may come from any other part of the ship, and the real
situation of the leak remain undiscovered. In the case now put,
supposing the worst, and that you cannot stop the leak, then
putting into that part or division of the ship such things of
your cargo as will not receive damage by the wet, and applying
the pumps to the other parts, you proceed on your voyage with
very little difference, as if no such accident had happened. It
may be further observed, that the more things you put into the
damaged part or division of the ship the better, as it will
lessen the quantity of water, and the weight of its motion in the
rolling of the ship. As ships on this construction will be more
solid, it is a great chance if, in case of a shake in a plank or
timber or a butt-end starting, water will find its way more than
a few inches; for every part of the plank, inside and out, being
closely joined together and caulked, it is impossible it should,
unless the leak or hole be directly through. The same observation
may be made on a shot or shots striking the ship betwixt wind and
water, or even below the water-mark; whereas, according to the
present construction of vessels, if a shot only splits or
shatters the outside plank, or goes through into the timber or
ceiling, it occasions a leak of a more dangerous nature, than if
it went clear through the ship's side or bottom; because in the
one case the water running in can easily be discovered, and may
be stopt from the inside; but in the other, it may run in at the
middle of the ship, and oozing fore or aft amongst the timbers
may make its appearance in quite a different place. As already
mentioned, in vessels built on this solid construction, the shot
sticking in the ship would make a plug for its own hole; and the
same observation will apply to accidents occasioned by rocks,
sands, or other violence that ships meet with, by which leaks are
generally occasioned; and wherever a leak may happen to be, the
new invented method of stopping leaks can be applied with more
certainty of success.</p>
<p>Vessels divided according to this plan, having three, four,
five, six or more holds, catching fire in any one of such
divisions, have in the first instance the advantage of containing
all the water thrown in by pumping, &amp;c. in one hold or
division, and can have pipes or leathern hose below the
water-line to communicate with the three wells. By applying all
those to the place on fire, which can be done instantly, no ship
can burn be low the water-line; so that all the water drawn or
pumped will be applied to keep the fire from the upper works,
rigging, &amp;c.: and by this means the magazine can instantly be
drowned, or any part of the ship where combustible matter is, can
be filled with water. The crew then have every encouragement to
stick by the vessel, and endeavour to extinguish the fire: and if
the vessel be in company of other ships, each ship will come as
near as possible to that which is in distress, and send boats,
men and engines to her assistance. Whereas, according to the
present construction of vessels, a man seeing a ship on fire, and
knowing that ship to have powder on board, will not approach her
for fear of her blowing up, and thereby involving his own ship in
her fate. This was the case with his Majesty's ship St. George,
the surrounding vessels not daring to render her any effectual
assistance, from the apprehension of her magazine exploding;
whereby, though every exertion was made to save her crew, numbers
of them were either burnt, drowned or blown up.</p>
<p>6. And lastly, that vessels thus constructed will answer as
men of war, bombs, fire-ships, floating batteries, gun boats, gun
batteaux, and flat-bottomed boats for landing troops.</p>
<p>The advantage of the wells in filling the magazine with water
has, in some measure, been already explained, yet it may not here
be improper to mention, that a convenience of this kind has long
been a favourite idea with, and the earnest wish of the greatest
Officers of the Navy. The late ingenious Sir Charles Knowles and
Captain Bentinck, with many others, had this object much at
heart, but the opposition they met with and other views,
prevented either of them from accomplishing what they so much
wished. Captain Bentinck had formed plans not only for the
magazine but for every store-room in the ship. The great
difficulty with him was in placing the cocks; but had Sliding
Keels and these wells* been at that time invented, the speedy and
easy conveyance of the water would soon have been seen, and there
is no doubt would have been applied as has been herein already
proposed. Almost every class of vessels having the magazine
either fore or aft, the foremost or after-most well might be so
connected with it as in time of action to keep every thing
damp.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The wells here spoken of are the grooves in
which the sliding keels move: and by which they are raised up or
lowered down. They may have cocks let into them on either
side.]</p>
<p>Such Admirals, Captains and Lieutenants as have done the duty
of Master's-mate, know the trouble of the duty of the hold, and
it is known to few others. In long cruizes or passages it is a
desirable object to keep the ship in her best sailing trim; and
this greatly depends on filling the empty casks with salt water.
This, from the great trouble attending it, is a duty which is
generally put off as long as possible; sometimes, indeed, so
long, that the ship is by far too light to carry sail; and a gale
coming on in this situation occasions much inconvenience. Then
every exertion is used to fill up empty casks; but as there is
but one cock, and that only suited to fill the lower or middle
tier, it takes up much time; and pumping or drawing water in bad
weather is commonly found impracticable. But were ships built
with Sliding Keels, there would be no danger in having two or
three cocks to each well, so that all the water necessary could
be had in one hour. Water might also by the same means be let
into a cistern wherein the hand-pump stands, and from thence be
conveyed to any part of the ship, either to fill the casks or
wash the decks; and by such assistance all the decks in the ship
would be washed at the same time. Another great convenience might
be derived from the wells to men of war victualling for long
voyages. In fresh water rivers all the casks in the ship could be
filled from them with the greatest ease. Turtle, lobsters,
oysters, and other sorts of fish usually kept for any time in
well vessels, might in men of war be preserved alive, by means of
the wells, without the least inconvenience to the vessel.</p>
<p>The importance it is of that ships should keep their station
in the line of battle is well known, both from recent instances,
and from the history of sea-fights in times past. As vessels are
now constructed, from the difference of their draught of water,
and their varying height, some ships are more or less leewardly
than others, and therefore do not all keep the line equally well.
To obviate this inconvenience the French generally keep a point
or two from the wind, the fleet keeping under way and under
steerage, which frequently draws them a-head and to leeward, yet
still they form a good and well connected line. Great advantage
too might be derived from this circumstance in going on
expeditions. It often happens that a commander in chief, with a
fleet of men of war with troops and stores under his command,
brings-to at night to keep his fleet together, on account of some
ships being more apt to go to leeward than others. He finds in
the morning that they have shifted their situation as to him, and
their respective situation with each other. This often produces
much inconvenience: it may however be remedied, in a great
measure, by the use of Sliding Keels. For should a commander in
chief, on seeing a gale coming on bring-to before night, fix on
the sail he intends to lay-to under (if possible) all night,
order the helm to be put as intended for the night, the yards to
be braced, backed or pointed to the wind, the keels to be hove
down or up, and the signal to be made for the fleet to take up
this drift, it is to be presumed that in the course of the whole
night there would not be the difference of three miles in a fleet
of a hundred sail or more, unless occasioned by neglect, or
through the wind shifting; whereas, according to the present mode
of ship-building it seldom happens, even with men of war, that
fleets and even the smallest squadrons are not separated by
lying-to in long winter nights. This we need not be surprised at
when we take notice in the day of the difference between a
frigate and a line of battle ship in the act of lying-to. In
order more clearly to explain what is here said with respect to
keeping ships together when in fleets, and lying-to, or even
standing on a wind, it may be added, that by the use of the
keels, though a vessel or a number of vessels should be left
behind, owing to their not being able to sail as fast as the
King's ships, yet they may be prevented from falling to leeward:
and, therefore, if in the morning it be found that any ships have
fallen astern and are missing, there is a greater certainty of
their coming up if waited for; or if a frigate be sent after
them, she is surer of finding them. The Trial cutter, in which
the experiment has been made, when brought-to, and all her keels
up, will drive to leeward, leaving her wake over the
weather-beam; but on the keels being hove down, she
proportionably lessens her drift and fore-reaches; nay, if the
helm be given, and all the keels hove down, she will, from one
knot or two, increase her motion to four or five; and so on in
proportion, and according to circumstances.</p>
<p>The situations of harbours in consequence of points of land,
tides, rocks, shoals, and sands, being as various and as numerous
as the harbours themselves, the approach of ships to towns and
forts which are to be attacked or bombarded are thereby often
rendered both difficult and dangerous. In expeditions of this
kind great impediments have been observed to have arisen from the
sharpness of vessels, and their great draught of water. The
circumstance of drawing much water prevents them from getting
near the object of attack, and often occasions, perhaps, the
failure of an expedition, from their being obliged to wait for a
full tide, which gives the enemy an opportunity of discovering
the design, and taking measures accordingly. With regard to the
sharpness of vessels, besides the inconvenience of drawing more
water, they are subject likewise to another, from the aukward
manner in which they take the ground. For supposing a sharp-built
vessel to get near enough to the object of attack, and to be left
in that situation by the tide, she cannot throw her shells,
because she will be lying almost on her broadside. Being thus
exposed to the fire of the enemy, without ability to return it,
it is more than probable that before the tide return she will be
taken, or the water flow into her before she rights. But vessels
built flat and solid, as on the plan herein-before recommended,
will not be equally liable to these inconveniences; the
circumstance of drawing less water will enable them to come
nearer the object of attack, remain there longer, and withdraw
easier from it; even should such vessels be left by the tide,
they might remain during the ebb, doing their duty equally as if
afloat.</p>
<p>All the inconveniences now just before pointed out in the case
of bombs, from such vessels being sharp built, and having a great
draught of water, apply with equal force to fire-ships. But some
other advantages may be enumerated as derivable to fire-ships
from Sliding Keels, which could be of no use with respect to
bombs. Such as when, in certain situations, opportunities occur
by placing the keels, and making the sails, that fire-ships may
run on a direct point, and do the duty required amongst shipping
in a road or harbour, or against a town near the water; and it is
to be presumed, that with fire-ships thus constructed it is
practicable not only to set fire (if no boom,) to a fleet in a
harbour, but at the same time so effectually to destroy the
harbour itself, as to prevent the ships that should not be burnt
from coming out, or any other ships of the line from going
in.</p>
<p>Many of the reasons given in the two last cases against
sharp-built vessels, and in favour of those on a flat
construction with Sliding Keels, apply to floating batteries, gun
boats, gun batteaux and flat-bottomed boats for landing troops.
If a floating battery is to be built, it should be constructed
suitable to the place and object it is intended for, whether it
be to go to sea, or to work up rivers; to run a certain distance
before the wind, or be towed by boats to the place where they are
to act. In either of these cases a variation in the construction
would be required; but the most considerable part of the
improvement would be in making separate bulk-heads, which in
batteries or boats the more numerous the better. For instance;
suppose gun boats are attacking a vessel or fort, or a great
number of flat-bottomed boats landing men, if a large shot strike
any one of these boats and go through her, the boat must
inevitably sink, to the great alarm of the men in the other
boats; but if these vessels are built with bulk-heads, the water
only can come into one or two places; and unless the shot goes in
below the water-line at one end of the boat, she will not sink,
nor will the men in the other boats know any more of a shot
striking her, than of a man being killed.</p>

<h4><i>Advantages applicable to Ships in general when constructed
with Sliding Keels.</i></h4>
<br>
<p>Thus much Captain Schank has delivered, respecting the
advantages resulting to vessels constructed with Sliding Keels,
and applicable to ships in the service of Government; the
observations which follow, apply more particularly to trading
vessels, and the general improvement of navigation.</p>
<p>1. Vessels thus constructed will answer better as Coasters of
all kinds, and for the coal trade. The advantages which Coasters
will derive from this construction are many. It is certain that
great numbers of them are lost owing to their great draught of
water; and it is also well known that their passages are
frequently much lengthened, by their being obliged, when the wind
is contrary, to run to leeward to get a good harbour or
roadstead. In such cases, if they drew a few feet less water,
they would go into many harbours, which they are now obliged to
pass. But the inconvenience does not rest here, for even when
they arrive at the intended port, they are, perhaps, often
obliged to wait several days for a spring tide, which, when it
comes, a gale of wind probably prevents them from taking
advantage of, and getting in: and often the same time may be lost
in getting out of the harbour. Besides loss of time, and
consequent expences to the owners, great quarrels are sometimes
produced through the same causes, betwixt owners, captain and
crews. All which would, in a great degree, be prevented, were
these vessels of a smaller draught of water. According to the
plan herein recommended, vessels of one hundred and twenty to one
hundred and forty tons, would not draw when loaded above five
feet and a half of water at most; and all other vessels in the
same proportion. They who are concerned in shipping, and know
what water vessels of such burthen at present draw, must see with
astonishment the advantage of this construction; which would
likewise prove more convenient, as such vessels would not require
a pier to lie to, and are capable of being moored in any part of
a harbour; and if the ground admit of it, carts, &amp;c. might
come alongside, and load or unload them, which also would save a
great expence.</p>
<p>2. Vessels built on this construction would answer in canals;
where the canal is above four or five feet deep. Let us suppose
the Duke of Bridgewater's canals, and all others now made, or to
be made in the kingdom, to be equal to the depth of the Scotch
canal betwixt Glasgow and Carron, the locks to be from sixty to
seventy feet long or more, and from twenty to twenty-six or more
wide; in such a case, all the trade from any part of the inland
country adjoining to the canals could load at any public place,
town or village, where a manufactory was carried on; and proceed
to the most distant parts of the known world without the
assistance of any other craft. This idea is submitted to the
consideration of all those who are concerned in such public
undertakings.</p>
<p>3. Vessels thus constructed would be exceedingly convenient to
carry corn or mixed cargoes, part of which it is required to keep
separate. This is certainly a great convenience when it can be
obtained without lessening the tonnage, and bulk-heads will serve
to separate the cargo, let it be as opposite as iron and
gunpowder. The bulkheads answer as separate apartments, or like
shifting boards, either for corn, salt, &amp;c. There is,
perhaps, nothing except masts, which such a vessel will not
answer for better than any other.</p>
<p>4. Vessels built with Sliding Keels have the advantage of all
others in case of losing the rudder. Although what has been said
respecting the effect of the fore and after Keel, and the main or
middle Keel, are sufficient to prove that vessels with three
Sliding Keels can, in case of losing the rudder, be instantly
steered with the Keels either on a tack, or working to windward;
yet as experiments have been made, and the efficacy of the Keels
sufficiently ascertained, it will be necessary to refer to the
certificate made by Lieutenant Malbon of the Trial Cutter and his
Officers, to the Lords of the Admiralty [see Appendix, No. 1.];
in addition to which, says Captain Schank, I can offer the
testimony of the ingenious James Templer, Esq. of Stove in the
county of Devon, who sailed several leagues in the same vessel,
only using the Keels [see Appendix, No. 4.] "I myself, (he
further adds) on many occasions, in the presence of Sea Officers
of different ranks, steered and worked that vessel in every
manner possible, with the Keels only: but a still more flattering
and more honourable proof remains, as this experiment was made in
presence of H<small>IS</small> M<small>AJESTY</small> at
Weymouth, who was pleased to condescend so far as to examine the
construction of the Cutter, and to order her to sail in company
with him, when signals were settled, by which she was to steer
and work to windward, with the Keels only; which was done, and
His Majesty signified his most gracious approbation."</p>
<p>5. Vessels on this construction will last longer than those
built according to the present mode. Long experience has
discovered that nothing destroys timber so much as being
sometimes wet, at other times dry; sometimes being exposed to the
air, and at other times air excluded from it. This is not the
case with ships built according to the construction which has
been herein often, but it is hoped not inconsiderately,
recommended. It is generally known that the bottom of a ship
seldom rots in less than fifty or sixty years; and some last even
longer, though the upper works decay much sooner. This may be
imputed to the distance the timbers are from each other, or to
the circumstance of the ceiling not being caulked, which defects
admit of a quick succession of different sorts of air, heat and
cold, wetness and dryness: but according to the plan of making
the ship more solid, these would, in a great measure, be
excluded, and ships would last at least one-third longer, if not
double the time they do at present.</p>

<br>
<a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a><i>Run from the Thames to the Cape
of Good Hope</i>]</h3>
<br>
<p><b>O</b><small>N</small> the 13th of January, 1800, the Lady
Nelson hauled out of Deadman's Dock into the River, having her
complement of men, stores, and provisions on board, with every
requisite for building and equipping another vessel of the same
size, wood excepted, which could be got in New South Wales; or,
in case of shipwreck, where it could be found. The provisions
were calculated for fifteen men for nine months, and the water
for six months. The former were of the best kinds; and, in
addition to which, we were supplied with abundance of
antiscorbutics.</p>
<p>We arrived at Gravesend on the 16th following. In going down
the River, I had the satisfaction of observing that she worked
well; though, like all new things, we had but few who saw us
pass, that did not say something against so small a vessel
destined for a long voyage. The general appellation we got was
that of his Majesty's <i>Tinder-box</i>.</p>
<p>On the 17th the crew were paid their river pay, and to those
who could find bondsmen two months in advance. Government was
very liberal to the men employed in the Lady Nelson.</p>
<p>We arrived in the Downs on the 20th. In going down the River,
owing to the thick foggy weather, we got too near the Brake, and
were warned of it by the after-keel lifting up, which which we
avoided running aground. We anchored in the Downs in five fathoms
water, the South Foreland bearing S.W. by S. half S. and Sandown
Castle N.N.W. It blew strong, and, from the appearance of the
weather, I had every reason to believe that the gale would
increase, which it did on the making of the flood: before dark we
got every thing snug, and gave the vessel a greater scope of
cable: the keels were found of great use in steadying her, and
preventing her rigging from straining. At this time there was a
very large convoy for the Westward lying in the Downs, which had
been detained nearly a month with westerly winds. On the evening
of the 23d the wind from the S.S.W. came on with the flood, and
blew very hard, with a heavy sea. At eleven o'clock at night many
signals of distress were made in the offing, and several ships
drove past us. Finding the Lady Nelson drive, we let go another
anchor, which presently brought us up, and enabled us to ride out
the gale with ease. The following morning six vessels were on
shore, dismasted; and in the Offing two more without either masts
or bowsprits. This circumstance, though very unfortunate for
other vessels, was, I confess, very pleasing to me, as it must of
course satisfy my crew of the good qualities of the vessel in
which they had to perform so long a voyage: more especially as
their minds were, in some degree, prejudiced against her from the
many unfavourable reports in circulation with respect to the
impossibility of her performing the voyage. As the day advanced
the gale ceased; and towards evening it blew a steady breeze from
the W. On the 26th it again freshened into a gale, and blew very
hard from W. by S. but with the former precautions we rode it
out, affording me the satisfaction of finding, that my little
vessel was easy when at anchor, and perfectly dry. The wind still
continuing steady in the S.W. quarter, I judged it most prudent
to shelter my charge as much as possible; particularly, as many
vessels had gone into Ramsgate Harbour. Having obtained leave for
that purpose, and being provided with a pilot, we run into that
harbour; where I was detained by the same wind till the 7th of
February, when it hauled to the northward. I sailed on the
evening of that day, and got to Spithead the following. The Lady
Nelson, on this occasion, outsailed all vessels of her size going
the same way.</p>
<p>On the 9th we went into Portsmouth Harbour, and brought up off
Gosport, in order to wait for a convoy to the Westward, and to
have some alterations made on our boats, &amp;c. As we had only
two brass carriage guns on board, we were supplied with four
more, from three to four pounders. With small arms and ammunition
we were well furnished: our provisions and stores were also
completed; and some oak plank was taken on board to repair the
sliding keels in case of accident. The vessel by these means
became very deep in the water, insomuch that we had only two feet
nine inches clear abreast the gangway. Many people who saw the
Lady Nelson reckoned her unfit for so long a voyage, which gave
me much trouble to keep the crew together, particularly as the
day of departure approached. The men became very dissatisfied;
and how to replace some that escaped from me was a difficult
business, as the crimps, who procured men for the East India
fleet, and other ships about to sail, picked up every man they
could get hold of. They were very assiduous in seducing some
young men I had, whose minds were easily worked upon by
representing the impracticability and risk of my undertaking.</p>
<p>On the 15th of March, my friend Captain Schank, accompanied by
Mr. Bayley, of the Royal Academy, Portsmouth, paid me a visit.
They observed, that the vessel was deep though she had nothing
but what was absolutely necessary. I answered, that a short time
at sea, with the consumption of fuel and provisions, would bring
us to the proper equilibrium.</p>
<p>On the 16th in the evening we had every thing clear for sea.
In the course of this week I had suffered a diminution of two men
in my crew; one I had been obliged to send ashore sick, the other
deserted, taking with him some of my wearing apparel. The wind in
the night becoming fair, at day-break on the 17th the signal for
the convoy's sailing was made by the Anson, Captain Durham. We
unmoored, and got a pilot on board by order of Captain Patten,
the resident Agent of Transports at Portsmouth, whose attention
and assiduity to me, while in his department, I feel myself happy
in thus publicly acknowledging, as deserving my most grateful
thanks. While getting the kedge up, my carpenter, who was
assisting in it, and had been drinking too freely to (St.
Patrick) his tutelary saint, found means to make his escape in
the dark. The loss of this man made me more uneasy than any other
three of the crew would have done. Being anxious to sail, I was
reluctantly obliged to put up with my loss. One thing consoled
me, and induced me to sail without a carpenter, which was, the
strength of the Lady Nelson: she was new; and I knew her to be a
good sea-boat. As I had passports to all the Powers then at war
with my Sovereign, I determined, if any accident should happen,
to run into the nearest port, and claim protection and
assistance; but nothing but dire necessity would induce me to
attempt this. By eleven A.M. we got clear out from St. Helen's,
and received Captain Durham's orders for keeping company. At noon
we had a fresh breeze from N. At six P.M. on the 18th, we took
our departure from Dunnose, in the Isle of Wight, bearing E. by
N. five leagues distant. As the weather was thick and hazy, we
soon lost sight of land and bid adieu to Old England. Towards
night it fell little wind, so that some of the Indiamen slipped
faster through the water than we did.</p>
<p>On the 19th the Commodore sent an officer on board to say,
that he thought I had better go into Falmouth, and take an
opportunity of sailing from thence with the West India fleet, as
I sailed too heavy for the East Indiamen. It being left to
myself, I preferred going on, as if it did not blow too heavy I
should be able to keep up.</p>
<p>On the 20th it blowing very fresh, and a considerable swell, I
found that the fleet got from us. As the wind increased, and the
sea made, we were obliged to take in our small sails, while the
large ships could set their steering sails, which had nearly as
much canvas in them, as we could shew altogether. This is a
convincing proof, that in going free large vessels in rough
weather have a great advantage over small ones, especially when
they are not deep in the water; as they can carry more sail,
(even admitting it to be the same sail), in proportion.</p>
<p>A vessel when low in the water has her progress much impeded
by being forced downwards between two seas, and this will be
found to operate more powerfully on short bodies than long ones.
The Brunswick East Indiaman, commanded by Captain Grant, in the
afternoon hailed me with the Commodore's orders to take the Lady
Nelson in tow. This was a business which I did not relish; but it
also required some consideration how far my conduct would be
justifiable in refusing it. From the observation made at noon, we
were in Lat. 49&deg; 3' N. the first we had made since leaving
the land; and judged the Long. to be 9&deg; 47' 26" W. of
Greenwich; therefore we were exactly in the track of the enemy's
cruizers. As I had more reason to dread detention (the season
being so far advanced, and the inconveniences attending a winter
passage to the Cape considered) than any doubt of the faith and
honour of the maritime Powers then at war, breaking through the
liberty granted in my passports; particularly knowing, that if
separated from my charge many articles, from various casualties,
might be lost or damaged, of which the mathematical instruments
were not the least to be considered. Besides, if the vessel towed
well, I knew she could not receive any damage, and we should be
the sooner out of the enemy's track. As I had neither a
carpenter, nor any mechanic on board, this was another reason for
my acquiescing to the proposal. Captain Grant assured me we
should have free scope; we therefore got the end of his hawser on
board, and soon found that the vessel towed very well.</p>
<p>During the time we had been out the weather was very
indifferent, being gloomy, with more or less rain, which
prevented me from making many necessary arrangements. I had also
observed that there were several small leaks in the decks, and
upper works, which greatly annoyed us, owing to the slovenliness
and inattention of the workmen employed in fitting her out,
although the most positive directions were given to the contrary.
The water found its way in many places under the covering boards,
and along the gunwale, insomuch that I was deprived of the use of
one of the bed-places in the cabin; and also to the detriment of
many articles fastened up against the side, which were necessary
to be kept at hand. The vessel being rigged also into a brig from
a cutter, the pumps were removed further aft, and not being well
finished, admitted much water, until the weather permitted us to
stop the leaks.</p>
<p>On the 21st the wind freshened with thick gloomy weather,
which we had reason to expect from its being the equinox; and the
sea, from the long and steady wind at E.N.E. became rough and
more uneasy; yet the vessel rose well to it, but being in tow, it
was impossible at all times to prevent her from being dragged
through some of the seas. This afforded some amusement to the
passengers on board the Brunswick, who visited the stern gallery
of it to see the little vessel in tow.</p>
<p>Nothing particular occurred till the 23d, when the wind had
increased so much, that being forced into several heavy seas by
the Brunswick, it evidently appeared to me that the vessel might
be strained too much; and as night was coming on, with great
appearance of blowing hard, I ordered the hawser to be let go at
five P.M. wishing my namesake a pleasant passage. I have since
been informed, that it was generally supposed I intended to
return to Spithead, as deeming it impracticable to go on. At
seven P.M. the gale increased at E. and E. by S. when we made the
vessel snug for the night, during which she was very comfortable,
and rose well to the sea. Day-light brought us more moderate
weather, and at noon we had a good observation, which gave us
Lat. 43&deg; 55" [sic] N. Long. 14&deg; 17' W. We lost sight of
the fleet during the night. As this was the first day we had any
clear weather since we came out, I ordered all the bedding on
deck, and spread them out to air, together with the seamen's
clothes, which custom I constantly followed when the weather
permitted, and to which I attribute the great health my men
experienced during the voyage, who were landed at Sydney in New
South Wales in the same state as when they embarked. It is true,
that on board of all his Majesty's ships the hammocks are brought
up every fine day, and stowed into the nettings, yet the benefit
of dispersing contagion cannot be procured while close packed up,
so well as by exposing the different articles to the air and sun.
Infectious matter it is well known may be preserved in the flocks
with which the bed-ticks are filled: how necessary then is it
that the hammocks should be opened, particularly in warm
climates, where the perspiration is augmented? This mode ought
constantly to be followed. Besides, another advantage accrues
from it; the lazy and dirty seamen are spirited on, by the
example of those who are otherwise, to keep their bedding and
clothes in decent order; as the whole is under the view of their
officers.</p>
<p>We took the opportunity of stopping several leaks in the upper
works; and found in many places about the covering board or
plank, sheer putty substituted for oakum.</p>
<p>On the 25th P.M. we had fresh gales and cloudy weather. At
three P.M. a strange sail was in sight. On going to the mast-head
a large fleet was seen bearing N.N.E. and the strange sail
apparently in chace, and gaining fast on us. Every sail was set,
and the vessel on the best point of sailing; we had only to wait
the issue. As she neared us, I perceived she was an English
frigate. At six P.M. she fired a shot at us, when we shortened
sail, and shewed our colours; but another shot convinced me she
took us for an enemy's cruizer. We then wore, and stood towards
her. It proved to be his Majesty's frigate Hussar,
Captain&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, as part convoy to the West
India fleet which we had seen from the mast-head.
Captain&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; told me he had taken us for a
Spaniard, and was sorry he had given us so much trouble. He said
his Longitude was from 13&deg; 30' to 14&deg; W. which was within
a very few miles of our own. After the usual compliments we
parted. At eight P.M. it came on to blow very fresh with heavy
squalls, and at midnight it blew very strong from almost every
point of the compass for twelve hours.</p>
<p>At day-light on the 26th, we were close to part of the West
India fleet, some of which not knowing what to make of us,
crowded all the sail they could to get out of our way. One of
them, much to his credit, hove to and fired a shot, almost plump
on board of us. After hoisting his colours, I shewed him ours,
when he stood on. Another vessel, the Hope of Liverpool, I could
hardly keep clear of; for the more I endeavoured to avoid him,
the more he attempted to get near me, insomuch that we were near
running on board each other. He asked me very haughtily who I
was, and where I came from, I replied by hoisting my pendant and
colours, nevertheless, he was not satisfied; and as he had no
force, I believe he intended, if he could, to have run me down.
There was at this time much sea going, but I found the Lady
Nelson do wonderfully well in it. The convoy stood to the
westward under close-reefed topsails. As it continued to blow
hard, with heavy squalls and rough sea, I had an opportunity of
trying the vessel, which I did by carrying sail upon her, and
never had less than two reefs in her mainsail, and the topsails
close reefed. The mercury this day stood on deck at 65&deg;. Lat.
observation at noon, 39&deg; 59' N.</p>
<p>On the 27th it was more moderate; but dark, gloomy and
uncomfortable weather, with drizzling rain.</p>
<p>The wind being from the S.W. and continuing freshening, at six
P.M. of the 28th we had so much sea that I hove the vessel to for
the night, when I found her perfectly easy and dry.</p>
<p>At day-light on the 29th it became more moderate, and the wind
hauled to the N. We bore up and made sail. I now found the great
benefit of the keels in facilitating the vessel's coming to, and
bearing up; for the most dangerous situation a vessel can be put
in, is when she has got no way on her, and in the act of wearing
or being put before the sea, where her beam is entirely exposed
to an high breaking sea. It is often in this situation that deep
loaded merchant ships have their decks cleared of all that is on
them; and sometimes are dismasted. If proper attention is paid to
the keels, it is only to watch one sea passing, and before the
next gets up to you, the vessel will be far enough round to
receive it endways, or at least considerably abaft the beam. Of
this I am the more convinced, from much experience I have
repeatedly had, in a very heavy sea, while in the Lady Nelson;
and that in the tract of ocean, when some thousand miles from any
known land, where there was no continent to interrupt the fetch
of the sea, and but little wind to assist me in throwing off the
vessel before it. It often happens in the southern hemisphere,
after blowing very heavy for some considerable length of time,
that it will fall nearly calm in the course of an hour, or even
less, when the sea being raised to a great height it has not time
to fall, but for some short time will continue to rise and break
much. There not being wind sufficient to keep a vessel to, she
becomes much exposed in the trough or hollow of the sea, which
makes it absolutely necessary to bear up, and put her before it.
In this case the benefit of being quick in getting the vessel
round is obvious to all seamen; and it is now an undoubted fact,
that nothing will facilitate her coming round so much as sliding
keels, as by the use of the after-keel she is not only brought
before the sea, but kept in that situation. They who do not
approve of vessels built on this construction, will, however,
admit that they have an advantage in this point over other
vessels, which are to be thrown off, or brought to by their sails
and rudders.</p>
<p>On the 29th we had moderate breezes with flying
showers&mdash;overhauled all the places that leaked in the
top-sides of the vessel, and found several in the sail-room about
the breast-hook, which bad not left a single sail but what was
more or less damaged, and which took up much time and expense in
repairing. This was a misfortune that I had no reason to expect,
and therefore gave me much uneasiness.</p>
<p>The weather at noon on the 30th cleared up, and brought us
fair weather; I seized the opportunity, and got all the bedding,
clothes, and damaged sails, on deck to air.</p>
<p>On the 31st we had again drizzling damp weather, and as the
wind was at N.E. and N. I expected to see Madeira soon; but in
the evening it came on to blow from N.E. by N. and N. so heavy,
that by midnight it blew a very heavy gale, and from the length
of time we had had it in this quarter, and generally blowing
strong, it may be judged what sea there was.</p>
<p>At one in the morning of the 1st of April we fell into a cross
heavy sea. When the vessel was hove to, as it blew so hard, we
got the fore-topsail-yard down on the deck, which I found of
great service, as it allowed the vessel to come up much higher,
nor did she fall off so much. The wind in general was at N.E. and
never varied above a point either way. Before the
fore-topsail-yard was lowered, the vessel had come up to N. and
fell off to N.N.W. Sometimes a sea would throw her off to N.W. by
N. When it was got down, she came up and hung long at N. by E.
and never fell off farther than N.N.W. and excepting when the
cross sea used to throw the spray on board, the weather side of
the deck was constantly dry.</p>
<p>The gale continued till the 3d, when it began to moderate, and
finding the sea get down at five P.M. I bore up. During the gale
we had drifted to the south of Madeira, where I expected to have
fallen in with the Anson and convoy; but the wind still being
fair I wished to make the most of it.</p>
<p>At half past three on the 5th, saw the Salvages bearing W. by
S. distant six or seven leagues. At eight passed them within
three leagues. Shaped a course for Palma, one of the Canary
Islands; which, at half past four, P.M. I saw bearing W.S.W.
fourteen or fifteen leagues. We now crowded all the sail we could
in order to get past these islands in the night, keeping to the
West of them. I found the variation by the sun's azimuth to be
its rising 14&deg; 22 W. Island of Palma then bearing E. by S.
distant forty miles by reckoning, thermometer on deck at noon
75&deg;. We had now got into a strong N.E. trade wind, which I
found tended to split most of our spare spars and masts, and I
ordered them to be payed with turpentine. The bedding, &amp;c.
was brought on deck to air; we also cleaned and washed below.</p>
<p>On the 6th we had a strong breeze from S. by E. to S.E. by E.
which does not agree with the accounts of winds that generally
prevail in this country, accompanied by a very cross ribbling
sea, which made the vessel very uneasy. I cannot account for this
in any other way, than that it is occasioned by a current setting
from between the islands, for as we got past them I found the sea
decrease gradually. Observation at noon in the Lat. of 27&deg; 3'
N.</p>
<p>The weather became moderate and fair on the 7th; at noon the
thermometer on deck was at 79&deg;.</p>
<p>On the 8th we crossed the Tropic of Cancer. We had now many
flying fish round; which, on account of the lowness of the vessel
used frequently to come on board in great numbers, affording us
many a delicious meal.</p>
<p>On the 11th we were employed in repairing the damaged sails,
and airing the bedding. Served out sugar and lime-juice to the
men. Saw a tropic bird. At noon found ourselves in Lat. 16&deg;
46' N.</p>
<p>At half past one P.M. of the 12th, saw the Island of Salt, one
of the Cape de Verds, bearing W. seventeen or eighteen miles.
Hauled close round the S.E. end of it, and run along the S. side
in order to look for an harbour, which is said to be near a small
island on that side; but not finding so convenient accommodation
as I expected, at half past six P.M. we shaped a course for St.
Jago.</p>
<p>As there are many different descriptions of the appearance of
the Island of Salt, it appeared to me as follows:&mdash;Having
made it at the time I expected by my reckoning, I was surprized
to find that it corresponded with the description of Bonavista,
very nearly as given in the East India Directory, which says,
"Salt is an island of high bold land with a peak on it;" and
that, "Bonavista is irregular and sandy down to the water's edge.
The S.E. point of Bonavista is a low spit of land, whose extent
is not perceived till you come up with it." This so exactly
corresponds with the S.E. end of Salt, that until I had rounded
this end of the island, and made the small one as laid down, I
was rather in doubt which of the two islands it was. The land of
Salt at the N.W. end appears high and irregular; it hath also
sand and valleys down to the water's edge on both the E. and W.
side; but it is most remarkable in being a long narrow island,
the S.E. end running out in a long sandy spit, which being very
low and flat, you do not distinguish it from the high land, until
you are close in with it. The spit is at least three or four
miles in length from the land, and on the N. side has a reef and
breakers on it in several places about a mile from the shore. The
land from the N.W. appears pretty regular, excepting here and
there it is jagged and broken towards the S.E. end. There appear
three mountains in Salt, two near the N.W. end, and the other
abreast of the small island on the W. side. Salt lies nearly
N.N.W. and E.S.E. and is so narrow that when you get on the W.
side, as far up as the small island, you may easily see the land
you have left on the opposite side. This is not the case with
Bonavista, as that island is much broader. There is no land that
I could observe on Salt that deserves the name of a Peak: its
being jagged towards the low sandy point on the S.E. end, and the
steep land falling progressively in steps below each other, may
have given rise to the idea of the uppermost being a peak, which
is, in fact, no more than the sharp corner of a table land.</p>
<p>Having before observed that we bore up at six P.M. for St.
Jago, at eleven we saw it, and continued our course for Port
Praya, intending there to refresh and fill up our water. After
rounding the S.E. point of St. Jago, (which is laid down to be no
more than six or seven miles to Port Praya, but it is nearer ten)
there is a small bay to the E. about four miles, called by the
inhabitants after St. Francis. This bay is particularly mentioned
in the East India Directory as being very apt to mislead
strangers, and, from the appearance of it from the sea, not
without reason. Port Praya bay is known by the cocoa-nut trees,
which are very conspicuous at the bottom of it, and a small
house. St. Francis's bay has also cocoa-nut trees. The distance
which the former bay is from the S.E. end of the island
corresponds better with that of St. Francis than Port Praya,
which, with its likeness to it, did not surprize me that
strangers should be deceived. My second mate having been in Port
Praya some months previous to his embarking with me, I was
persuaded by him that the Bay of St. Francis was it; and dreading
the loss of time it would occasion if I went past it, as I did
not mean to touch at the Brazils, I therefore ventured into this
dangerous place, taking care to anchor the vessel in a weatherly
situation in case of accidents. I instantly went on shore with
this man, who still thought he was right; but on landing he
found, to his confusion, he was wrong. I returned immediately on
board and got out of this bay. The Bay of St. Francis may be
always known by its having at the back of it, and nearly close
down to the water's edge, an high flat-topt table land standing
between two mountains, which cannot be mistaken. Port Praya has
at the bottom of it, besides the house already mentioned, a long
low valley running inland to a considerable extent, the mountains
behind which are sharp and peaked. Near the landing place there
are two remarkable forts on the E. side, which you must open
before you come to anchor; and on the W. side is Quail Island,
which is easily seen as you enter. But the surest mark is that
from the S.E. end of the Island of St. Jago, the shore is low and
rocky in general, until you reach the Bay of St. Francis; from
thence to Port Praya the shore is high clayey cliffs, which round
into the harbour forming the E. side of it. Port Praya is well
known to be very extensive, and capable of containing a numerous
fleet of ships. The soundings I found corresponded with those
laid down in the East India Directory.</p>
<p>On Sunday the 13th I came to an anchor, and saluted the fort
with seven guns, which was immediately returned. I had performed
this first part of my voyage in twenty-six days from Portsmouth,
nearly four of which I had lain to. The Governor Antonio
Marcelino de Basto received me very politely, and offered me
every assistance in his power, that I might stand in need of.</p>
<p>Much cannot be said of the town, nor the manner the Governor
is lodged. Nature has done much for its defence, and since the
commencement of this war the Governor has built two forts, one of
fourteen, the other of eleven guns. They are both inclosed with a
wall kept in good order, and white washed, which make a pleasing
appearance. There are also several redoubts with guns mounted in
them, but in a very ruinous state. The inhabitants are chiefly
black, a few officers about the Governor excepted. The troops
appeared to be natives of the island, black, and poorly clothed.
From the height that the forts and town stand on, a tolerable
defence towards the sea might be made; but if an enemy was landed
the island would instantly fall; particularly as it has few
internal resources, and even water is brought from a well in the
valley at the back of the town (the only place they get water
from in the dry season,) which could be cut off.</p>
<p>The seasons are divided into wet and dry, like all other
places between the tropics. At this time the ground was parched
up, exhibiting a barren waste, scattered with pumice stones and
other volcanic matter. What had the appearance of grass was dry
and dirty. Vegetation there was none. Nevertheless the
inhabitants seemed to enjoy the few comforts with apparent
happiness.</p>
<p>It has been before remarked, that the trade wind had caused
several of our spare masts and spars to split, and that I had
payed them with turpentine; yet this mode did not entirely
prevent it. I observed that some which were painted escaped with
very little damage.</p>
<p>On the 14th all hands were employed in filling water, and
refitting. Several places where the vessel leaked were found out
and caulked. At this time I discovered that the seeds of
disaffection had been industriously sown by my second mate
amongst the crew; insomuch, that one half of the men would not
speak to the other. To remedy this, I delivered the offender to
the Governor to be put on board the first British vessel that
arrived. In such a small vessel as mine, and employed in a
business which required unanimity and good humour, the only step
was to get rid of such a man. He had, however, gained his point
with some of the younger part of the crew, for on the night of
the 23d, two lads set off with one of my boats; and although it
was much less than a Thames skiff, and the weather rainy with
thunder and lightening, they put to sea with an hammock for a
sail, taking with them some biscuit, water, and a tomahawk. As
soon as I was informed of it, I went on shore to take the
necessary steps to recover them. To effect this the Governor
shewed much attention, by sending out parties of men in every
direction. He observed, that in such a time they would be
discovered if they had landed on the island; and the boat would
facilitate that, as they could not carry it with them. I was more
concerned for the loss of it than the men. The following day the
culprits were brought into town, by a party of the natives, both
riding on one ass, which had a more ignominious effect than any
punishment I could inflict, they being exposed to the ridicule of
the inhabitants, and the Portuguese seamen belonging to vessels
then there. When they arrived I was informed of it, and that the
boat was safe about seven miles from the vessel, from whence I
sent for it. Having used the means to prevent the like desertion
in future, together with the principal being removed, I found a
total change amongst the men, who became more united, living
friendly and happily together.</p>
<p>During my stay at St. Jago I made several excursions into the
interior, which did not materially differ from the vicinity of
Port Praya. From the quantity of volcanic matter strewed over the
ground, and peaked form of the mountains, there is every reason
to suppose that it has been subject to eruptions.</p>
<p>There are not many birds on the island; and of these only a
few varieties. What I saw were chiefly bustards, some of the
vulture kind, a species of small hawk, king-fishers, Guinea birds
and domestic fowls. I travelled above twenty miles inland one day
to procure some Guinea fowls, and although we saw several covies,
(in order to get near which we crept on our hands and knees) yet
they were so cunning and alert, as not to permit us to get nearer
to them than within a couple of gunshots. Like grouse they plant
an advanced centinel, who, on the approach of danger, makes a
cackling sort of noise to give the covey feeding at a distance
time to start. My guide informed me that the best time to shoot
them, is when they come to drink; and as in the dry season such
places are very few in number, they are seen there in great
plenty. To one of these places, about seven miles from the town,
we went. It was a small dirty puddle, yet it was the first drop
of water I had met with since leaving the well near Port Praya.
We hid ourselves in an hole of the cliff by the side of the
spring, but after waiting above an hour, I concluded he was
deceiving me in hopes of getting the reward I had promised. While
remaining at the place I observed numbers of cattle and goats
come to drink, without any person to drive them, or being even
marked; from which I concluded they were wild cattle. Seeing us
they would not approach, but hastened off. On enquiring of my
guide whether they were wild, I could not make him understand me;
and on my return to Port Praya, I put the same question to
several people who understood a little English, and could answer
most questions I put to them, but, to my surprize, they pretended
ignorance. I therefore conjectured this to be a subject on which
they wished, or were desired to be silent; my reasons for this
conjecture will appear hereafter.</p>
<p>Finding little chance of seeing any Guinea fowls, I expressed
my great disappointment to my guide, who then informed me that
there was a place at a considerable distance farther, where we
might be certain of meeting with them, observing at the same time
that they seldom came to drink, except very early in the morning,
or late in the evening. Being anxious to become better acquainted
with the country, I determined on proceeding thither. We passed
several little farms inhabited by the natives, who resemble
African negroes. These farms are mostly situated in the valleys,
and appear to have great labour bestowed on them. The houses are
mere cabins, exhibiting much misery; yet wretched as they
appeared, the women, on our entering any of them, received us
with kindness, offering us milk. The men, we were told, were at
work in the fields. The females were all busily employed in
spinning cotton, which they did with great dexterity from a
distaff with a spindle, whitening every now and then the
forefinger and thumb through which the thread passed with a
powder like chalk, though I had not yet seen any chalk or lime in
any part of the country I had passed through. Some were employed
in weaving a kind of cloth, peculiar to the island, on small
hand-looms. From the information of these people we again set off
in search of the Guinea fowls, but were told that it was more
than probable we should not see any till the following morning.
On reaching a small stream in a valley we took post till our
patience was exhausted. Leaving that situation we reached another
noted place, and were fortunate enough to spring a covey of near
thirty, which led us a chace of several miles without being able
to get within shot of them. Finding that we were going farther
inland than my time would admit of, I abandoned the pursuit, and
returned to the first huts already mentioned, where the
hospitable people gave us some eggs, and a sort of macaroni which
they used as bread; this with milk and some biscuit we had with
us, enabled us to make a comfortable meal. While thus employed
several of the men came home from work. They are in general more
robust and strong than the Portuguese: as they have woolly hair
and flat noses their origin may be easily traced. They are
zealous Catholics; every cabin we entered had a crucifix placed
in some conspicuous situation. After experiencing the hospitality
of these people, which, from the account of some voyagers, I was
led not to expect, we returned heartily tired to Port Praya; the
day, moreover, had been uncommonly sultry. Walking in this island
is attended with many disagreeable sensations, particularly from
the sulphureous effluvia arising from the earth.</p>
<p>Salt is the principal article of trade of the Cape de Verd
Islands; but it does not appear that it is plenty in St. Jago. In
what I saw produced in the latter, sulphur and metallic
substances seemed to predominate. The governor first pointed out
to me that after rain had fallen, the saline particles on the
tops of the mountains appeared like dross of bright copper: there
not being any rain while I staid on the island, I had not an
opportunity of seeing this. The same gentleman shewed me some
saltpetre he had found on the island, the discovery of which, and
the national benefit resulting therefrom, he was very sanguine
in. We tried it; and although not so strong as what I had on
board, yet there is little doubt but it may turn out of some
advantage.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned the females spinning cotton, the
trees producing which are of an uncommon size. Two of them near
Port Praya are generally visited by strangers: one of them
measured in the girt twelve yards three quarters. On the bark of
it I observed engraved the names of several British naval
officers, and the ships they belonged to. Among others the Lion,
with Lord Macartney's, Sir Erasmus Gower's, and the names of the
different officers. These trees were the only thing curious that
the Governor pointed out to me.</p>
<p>Of wild animals, except the cattle already mentioned, I saw
none but monkeys and cats.</p>
<p>Fish are plenty in the Bay, and sometimes turtle are caught;
but unless by those who have been in Europe, the latter are not
eaten. In hauling the seine of the Lady Nelson we caught a very
fine green turtle, of one hundred and fifty weight. The natives
who were on the beach at the time said it was not good to
eat.</p>
<p>Having got all my water casks filled, and the rigging put in
good order, I wished to know the state of my keels. On raising
the after one I found it broken short off in the wake of a bolt,
which bolt, being in the nip of the bottom of the vessel, was
nearly bent double, and, no doubt, happened in the heavy weather
already mentioned: but here it became of the greatest consequence
to me to repair the broken keel. In the accomplishment of this I
had a very laborious job, as I had not a carpenter on board.
However, with the assistance of one of my crew, I finished it in
two days; and the Governor very politely offered me all the help
in his power.</p>
<p>Previous to sailing I purchased a bullock, weighing two
hundred and seventy-five pounds. On paying for it I had an
opportunity of finding out the reason of the inhabitants being so
unwilling to answer my questions. When I deposited the money I
was surprised to see nearly one half of it sent to the Governor.
On asking the reason of this, I was told it was a duty to the
Crown. I am of opinion, all the herds I saw without keepers or
marks are the property of the sovereign, and the individuals who
catch and kill them are paid a certain proportion for their
trouble, and any damage their lands may suffer by these wild
cattle. Besides, it may be prudent to conceal whether they are
wild or not, to prevent strangers killing them; by which means
both the crown and individuals would lose the purchase money.
This is not the case with their hogs; a small duty only I believe
goes to the government for these.</p>
<p>On the 27th of April we bid adieu to St. Jago. With permission
of the Governor, I entered on the vessel's books two young men,
making up the crew to twelve in all. On getting clear of the
islands I found a strong current setting to the south, which
differed our latitude, by observation, thirty miles more to the
south than our distance would give. I at first suspected some
fault in the log-line or glasses, but on trial found them
correct. The thermometer now in general stood at 86&deg; and
87&deg;. Several of the ship's company began to complain of
bilious disorders.</p>
<p>On the 1st of May we had an observation at noon in lat. 7&deg;
59' N. long. 21&deg; 48' W. by lunar observation. One of the men
was seized with violent spasms in the bowels, attended with a
considerable degree of fever; but by the exhibition of an emetic,
fomentations, opening medicines and opiates, I cured him in four
days. To prevent infection I made up a bed for him under an
awning on deck: the thermometer was up to 94&deg;. at this time.
All the bedding, clothes, and the cabins the men slept in were
washed, thoroughly cleansed, and a wind-sail put down. This, with
the attention I paid to the men's messing, kept them in perfect
health. As I supposed oatmeal, which is generally used for
breakfast on board his Majesty's ships, was of too heating a
quality; (and which joined to the salt provisions at dinner-time
creates a considerable degree of thirst,) to obviate this, I
recommended to the men the use of tea. The good effects of this
change were soon visible, for they hardly or ever drank any water
in the forenoons. In lieu of spirits I issued wine, reserving the
former for a colder climate. Having a quantity of essence of
spruce on board, I brewed a good wholesome beer from it, which I
also gave the men. The generality of the crew were young lads who
had never crossed the tropics before; but by pursuing these means
not one of them sickened afterwards. The adoption of such a
regulation might, perhaps, prove of infinite service in warm
climates; and in case of a scarcity of water, the saving would be
considerable.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* I am happy to find this mode is adopted on
board of East Indiamen.]</p>
<p>We now began to find various currents as we approached the
line, with heavy squalls and rain at times.</p>
<p>On Sunday the 4th the wind shifted to the S.W. and blew hard
till the 6th, when it fell perfectly calm; previous to which it
had been for some time N. and N.E. and stiffing suddenly to the
S.W. and S.S.W. caused a very turbulent sea. The succeeding calm
made our little vessel tumble and toss to so uncommon a degree,
that hardly any of us could stand on the deck or sleep below; and
almost every one was sea-sick. During all this she never shipped
any water, nor did she strain or chafe her rigging. In the
recollection of us all never had so disagreeable a sea occurred.
Our observation this day, the 6th, was lat. 3&deg; 6' N. long.
20&deg; 57' W.</p>
<p>On the 7th we had light winds. Numbers of porpoises were seen:
we caught one which measured seven feet and a half: we procured
above a gallon and a half of oil from it for our binnacle. We
found the current here S.W. by S. nearly at the rate of half a
knot an hour. I tried it several times this day. This accounts
for our latitude, by observation for some days, exceeding our
distance run. The East Indian Directory informs us of the
currents in or near these latitudes setting to the S. and W. but
no rate is mentioned. My observation may be of use, perhaps to
future navigators. The weather was now very sultry; the mercury
from 94&deg; to 92&deg;.</p>
<p>On the 8th the difference of latitude exceeded the distance
run twenty miles.</p>
<p>At six A.M. of the 9th we saw a schooner, and soon after a
brig in the S.W. quarter; the latter standing towards us. At
seven there came on a very heavy squall, which I made the best
use of to avoid the brig, not wishing to run the risk of being
detained or examined, should she be an enemy. The wind was at E.
by S. attended with heavy rain. It cleared up at eleven A.M. the
strange vessels not in sight. We had a good observation at noon,
lat. 0&deg; 53' N. long. by account, 20&deg; 16' W. thermometer
86&deg;.</p>
<p>On the 10th we had light winds. At sun-rise the variation was
from several sights, per azimuth, 13&deg; 48' W. We had gained
sight of the brig. At noon, lat. 0&deg; 9' N. I judged this to be
the last day we should be in north latitude. Fish of various
kinds were in plenty round us: many flying fish lighted on the
deck during the night. We caught some bonetta, about fourteen
pounds weight each. Birds answering the description given by
Captain Cook, in the run from St. Jago to the Cape of Good Hope,
were also seen in great numbers. The wind began to freshen
gradually at S. by E. to S.S.E.</p>
<p>A ship and a sloop were seen on the 13th standing to the W.
Found per sun's amplitude at setting, variation to be 13&deg; 11'
W.</p>
<p>On the 14th, light winds at S.S.E. found, by several sights,
the variation to be 13&deg; 8' W. Saw several Pintado birds, and
a black bird, called by sailors, haglet. Wind freshened into
strong breezes from S.E. to S.S.E.</p>
<p>On the 16th, we had light weather, but a long heavy swell. At
night much phosphoric matter about us in the water. If the hands
are dipt into it, the substance is observed on them, but after
being exposed to the air it goes off: it is of a glutinous
nature. The ocean surrounding the coast of Africa seems
particularly impregnated with this luminous appearance. In heavy
dark rainy weather it is not observable, but by moon or star
light it is.</p>
<p>We had an observation on the 17th at noon, which gave us lat.
8&deg; 11' S. and long. 27&deg; 28' W. The wind in general at
S.E. and S.E. by S. I followed the directions of Monsieur
D'Apres, and the observations of Captain Cook, keeping a good
point free, as I thereby expected to get the sooner to the S. and
clear of the S.E. trade-wind, having crossed the Equator in the
long. 20&deg; 30' W. by this means we did not see any part of the
Coast of Brazil. It may be proper to remark, that we found a
current drifting us farther to the W. than we had any reason to
expect, and that the vessel's head was never farther to the W.
than S.W. by S. and sometimes S.W. by S. &frac12;S. which with
13&deg; W. variation ought to have given us with a S.W. by S.
course, by compass, a S.S.W. true course; instead of which we
have never been able to make better than a S.W. course. Of this I
am the more certain, because we have not these twenty-four hours
had occasion to steer on any point but one, S.W. by S. with a
S.E. wind, and with every attention I could pay to the steerage.
Such is the result of my observation. It is true that all voyage
writers who have navigated for the business of discovery, take
notice of the different currents about the equator, without being
able to reduce them within any certain bounds or rate: and I much
fear that this will always remain a source of error. These
currents, as already observed, set to the westward, therefore I
think our navigators in general, who cross the line about 20&deg;
or 21&deg; W. might do it to more advantage at 12&deg;; as by
that means they will avoid the heavy weather experienced near the
African shore. On my return to Europe, I found the winds as
favourable for crossing the line in nearly the lat. 12&deg;. as I
did in 20&deg;. and as the great point is to get into the
variable winds between the S.E. and N.E. trade, to cross, I found
them equally so; neither had we more rain. If a vessel therefore
crosses about 12 degrees, she will not have so far to run to the
W. before she gets clear of the S.E. trade; and if bound to the
Cape or India, where it may be acceptable to have a sight of the
former, or the land near it, she will greatly shorten the
passage, as it is well known many have fallen in with Cape St.
Augustine or Cape Rocque on the Coast of Brazil, and by so doing
were obliged to run from continent to continent, merely because
they judged it useless or impracticable to cross the Line under
20 deg. W. Independent of all this, there is another reason why
at certain seasons the Coast of Brazil ought to be avoided, that
is, between the months of February and July when the winds hang
much to the S. being generally from S.S.W. to S. by E. and S.S.E.
This is an old remark made by many, but not generally mentioned
by navigators who have laid down directions for navigating these
seas. The current on the Coast of Brazil from March to September
sets to the N. and from September to March back again to the S.
No doubt in doubling the Capes of Rocque and St. Augustine, the
currents extend themselves more to the E. of which we had a
sufficient demonstration enabling me to account for the remarks
already made respecting the course of the Lady Nelson.</p>
<p>On the 18th, we were in lat. 9&deg; 50' S. long. 28&deg; 28'
W. by lunar observation. Ever since the 12th instant we had
nothing but S.S.E. and S. winds blowing at all times very heavy
and squally with rain. This had impeded our progress to the S.
very much, and carried us a long way to the W. Between the 3d and
7th degrees of S. latitude we observed the diminution of the
strength of the current to the W.</p>
<p>The weather became moderate and pleasant on the 21st, with
fresh breezes. We found the variation to be 4&deg; 47' W. In
these regions there is in general a constant weight or thickness
of the air, even in the finest weather, perceivable to the eye,
which proceeds, no doubt, from the heat of the sun rarifying the
surrounding atmosphere, and no doubt makes a difference on the
refraction of all bodies observed.</p>
<p>At sun-rise on the 23d, found the variation to be 5&deg; 30'
W. We were now so far to the S. as 16&deg; 4' S. This agrees
pretty nearly with the Variation Chart contained in the East
India Pilot, which was projected in 1772, adding thereto the
annual increase of variation to the W. The day proving fine we
got the boats out to overhaul the keels, and found that the piece
which had been joined on to the after-keel at Port Praya was
gone. Not having sufficient plank in the vessel, I was obliged to
admit the keel further down in the well, and join a breadth of
plank I had left on to it with spike nails and iron hoops, by
which means it went three feet into the water below the vessel's
bottom.</p>
<p>On the 24th, we had strong gales from the S.S.E. with squalls
and much head sea, that made us labour to a great degree.</p>
<p>The following day the weather was the same. Several pintadoe
birds and sheerwaters were seen around us.</p>
<p>On the 28th, the weather became steady at N.W. but in the
afternoon it took us aback at S.E. and fell calm in the evening.
As we were now fast approaching Rio Janeiro, having an
observation in lat. 22&deg; 18' S. long. per account, 32&deg; 19'
W. I ordered a survey of the water on board; when finding we had
twenty-four half hogsheads in good order, and several barricoes,
I came to the resolution of not touching at Rio Janeiro. I also
took the opportunity of inspecting the state of the vessel. The
sail-room was perfectly dry. The bread-room, which we had access
to every day, appeared the same; but unwilling to trust too much
to that, I had the bread removed, and found several places where
it leaked; particularly close to the stern frame, where the
thwart-ship planks of the stern join to the butt-end of the fore
and aft planks of the side; another near to the stern post, and
several oozings about the iron knees that had been put into her
previous to leaving the Thames. The loss sustained by this was
upwards of two hundred weight of bread; however, we had still
twenty-four bags and an half undamaged. It may be thought
improper in me to make any observation on the work done to the
vessel in Deadman's Dock, particularly in caulking her; but from
the damage accruing to the sails and bread, and the wetness of
the places where we slept, I trust the candid reader will excuse
me, happy would I have been to have recorded otherwise.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* I hope these hints will be serviceable to
those who have similar voyages to perform, and that they will not
rely too much on those who are employed in caulking and fitting
their vessels. Captain Cook complains of a similar
circumstance.]</p>
<p>On the 30th, we had variable weather from calm to blowing
strong, with squalls and rain. Although the swell was long and
heavy, yet the vessel went through the water easy and dry.
Numbers of birds were seen by us, particularly the haglet, many
of which the men caught by baiting hooks with pork; and as the
skin is covered with a very thick down, they made warm caps of
them, which they wore instead of fur ones. Their flesh, if made
into a pie, or broiled, we found not unpalatable. We now
completed the stopping of the leaks in the bread-room. The
mercury for some time past had not exceeded 86&deg;, and
sometimes was not higher than 81&deg;.</p>
<p>On the 31st, our observation at noon was lat. 23&deg; 56' S.
long. by sun and moon, 30&deg; 3' W. the weather heavy and gloomy
with squalls and variable winds. Thermometer 81&deg;, which
generally, by its falling, indicated a change of weather.</p>
<p>The same weather, with much sea from the S.W. was experienced
on the 1st of June: the wind shifted frequently from W.N.W. to
S.S.W.</p>
<p>On the 2d, the thermometer at noon stood at 80&deg;. At four
P.M. the wind set in from the S. shifting at times to the S.S.W.
At seven, it freshened into a brisk gale, with rain and squalls.
The mercury fell to 75&deg;&frac12;. During the night much
lightning and rain, and a heavy gale.</p>
<p>At noon on the 3d it cleared up and moderated, which was
indicated by the thermometer rising to 78&deg;&frac12;. We now
experienced a very heavy long sea, which, as we advanced to the
S. seemed to increase in bulk. This sea takes longer time in
rising and falling than that we generally have in the Western
Ocean; nevertheless, it is not more troublesome, unless agitated
from long blowing or currents, when the tops of those seas will
break much and heavily.</p>
<p>On the 5th, the mercury fluctuated much from 75&deg; to
71&deg;, and back again to 76&deg;, varying more or less almost
every hour. At noon we found our latitude to be 25&deg; 41' S.
long. per account, 22&deg; 9' W. and the variation, per sun's
amplitude at setting, 7&deg; 20' W.</p>
<p>Much sea and blowing hard from S.S.E. to S.E. with heavy
squalls. Caught a number of haglets this day. Mother Cary's
chickens, as commonly called by the sailors, or tempest birds,
(the <i>Procellaria Pelagica</i> of Linn&aelig;us,) were seen in
great numbers. Although they are said to indicate stormy weather,
I have met with them in these seas in the calmest.</p>
<p>On the 8th, heavy sea with gales from the S.S.W. towards noon
the wind died away, leaving a disagreeable swell, which made our
little vessel roll and labour much. The mercury varied from
75&deg; to 70&deg; during the gale; and when it became calm it
stood at 70&deg;. Our observation this day was lat. 26&deg; 38'
S. long. 20&deg; 4' W.</p>
<p>The calm was not of long duration, for at seven A.M. of the
9th it hauled back to blow from the S.W. which at noon freshened
into a gale at S.S.W. with heavy rain and squalls; occasionally
shifting from S.W. to S.S.W. and S.</p>
<p>This weather continued rather increasing all the 10th. The
mercury fell to 68&deg;. The sea had by this time got to such an
height, that it was very pleasing to see our little vessel go
through it so easy.</p>
<p>On the 11th, the squalls became more frequent, and increased
with great violence attended by hail. At three P.M. it blew a
perfect storm, which obliged me to heave the vessel to. The wind
had risen to that pitch, that I looked for nothing else than
having all the canvas (small and low as it was) blown out of the
bolt-rope when exposed to the wind, as the vessel got on the top
of a sea. She behaved much better than could have been expected,
as she rose on the top of every thing, and shipped very little
water, during the day. A few leaks broke out on the deck, one of
which, over my bed, was a little troublesome, till the weather
permitted its being secured. Several rainbows made their
appearance this day. The mercury, which was 67&deg; 30' when the
vessel was have to, rose towards the evening to 69&deg;. At nine
P.M. a very heavy squall of hail and rain came on, with an
increased degree of wind, which for a little seemed to lay the
weight of the sea. We heard the squall before we felt it, and
after it left us, which was not of long duration. A large rainbow
was seen, which joined to the darkness of the night had a very
disagreeable appearance. This was the second lunar rainbow I bad
ever seen; the first was whilst cruising in the Gulph of Lyons in
very heavy weather, which, however, brought with it a favourable
change, as it also did on the present occasion.</p>
<p>In the morning of the 12th the weather moderated, the wind
gradually abating. It hauled round to the S.S.E. We had still
strong gales, with some rain, and much sea: but by this time we
had got so accustomed to the little vessel and the rough weather,
that all became familiar to us. It is but justice to my crew to
observe that, though young and inexperienced lads, they had
become so alert and attentive to their duty in reducing or making
sail in such fluctuating weather, as to demand my highest praise.
I had seldom occasion to call all hands upon deck for this
purpose. At noon this day we had moderate weather, the wind from
S. to S.S.E. The mercury, which during the night had been at
69&deg; 30', now got up to 71&deg;. I ordered all the bedding and
clothes on deck to dry.</p>
<p>On the 13th, we had a light breeze from N.N.E. which we made
the best use of to get southing. Took the opportunity of stopping
the leaks through the deck, and examining our rigging, which was
found not to be in the smallest degree chafed by the gale. Our
latitude at noon was 27&deg; 34' S. longitude 16&deg; 51' W.</p>
<p>The wind shifted on the 14th to the W. and in an heavy squall
at twelve P.M. it came round to the old quarter, blowing heavy
and steady from S.S.W.</p>
<p>At day-break on the 15th it moderated and shifted to the S.E.
by S. This variable weather was what we had no reason to expect
in this latitude at this season of the year. As N.W. winds are
generally experienced, directions are given to get to the
southward, but hanging so long to the S. and blowing in so great
a degree, together with the force of the sea, our progress was
much impeded.</p>
<p>On the 16th it fell for a short time calm; but a N.W. breeze
springing up, we carried all possible sail, it being the wind we
had long looked for.</p>
<p>The breeze failed us on the 17th, shifting again to the S.W.
accompanied with rain and squalls. One of the men struck a pilot
fish, (<i>Gastereotus Ductor</i>. Lin.) being one of two which
had followed the vessel some time. It measured seven inches in
length; and in its maw was found a small fish resembling our
common sand eel.</p>
<p>On the 18th we had a very heavy sea, with the wind as
yesterday. By observation at noon we were in lat. 31&deg; 13' S.
long. per account, 11&deg; 48' W. We were often obliged this day
to throw the vessel before the sea, as it followed us, and rose
more perpendicular than I had observed before. About five P.M. my
attention was excited by a more than ordinary motion of the
vessel. On my reaching the deck, I found no more wind than we had
all day, but the sea was running very hollow, and breaking at
times. On asking the mate, who had the watch, how long it was
since this sea had got up? He answered, about ten minutes, when
it rose and broke about half a cable-length from the vessel on
the starboard-bow. It appeared to me so much like a break, that I
believed the bottom could be at no great depth. Both of us were
so much surprised, that, without speaking a word, I went and took
the sails in to heave the vessel to, and put the deep-sea lead
over, but had no soundings with one hundred and twenty fathoms
line out. I saw the sea break twice as we passed it, one sea
following the other, but as we were going six knots, and the sea
very high, I could only observe it rise while the vessel was
rounding to, higher on that spot than the place we were on. From
the different form of the sea, together with the manner in which
it broke, I think there must be some ground at no great depth in
this spot; for it did not gradually rise into a heavy long swell,
and break at top, as it had done all day, but was lifted suddenly
up perpendicular, throwing itself forward, and doubling over as
it fell into an immense column of water, breaking in a very heavy
surge. There is little doubt, if we had been in it, that it would
have overwhelmed us as it fell; so that more owing to chance than
good management we escaped. The sea we had been going through all
day, when in the hollow of it, was much higher than our mast
head, so that we had no great scope of view; but no inconveniency
was felt, as it was long, regular, and heavy, admitting the
vessel to remain on the top of it some time before it rolled from
under her: but these breakers were of a very different nature, I
observed before, that it was the sudden motion of the vessel
which brought me on deck; but as soon as she was hove to, we
found ourselves in the same state we had been in all day. After
laying, to about an hour we bore up. In the Chart prefixed to the
East India Directory, some breakers seen by Captain Smith are
laid down in the same latitude we were in at noon this day; but
judging myself to the E. of them, and having a powerful swell
from the W. with a strong W.S.W. gale, steering S.E. half S. with
the addition of sometimes being obliged to throw the vessel
farther off to the E. to avoid the break of the top of the sea at
times, I did not apprehend falling in with them, as laid down by
him in 13&deg; W. Whether these be the same or not, or whether
there is any ground, (though I have no doubt there is,) yet it
will be some satisfaction to seamen to know, that they may guard
against them. The latitude so nearly corresponds, that I have
every reason to believe them the same. On my arrival at the Cape
of Good Hope, I seized the first opportunity to transmit an
account of them to Europe, with my opinion. I before remarked the
latitude and longitude at noon, from which, until we fell in with
these breakers, we had run thirty-two miles S.E. half S. by
compass. On the 16th, the variation was observed to be 11&deg;
30' W. and on the 20th, 14&deg; W. I allowed the variation to be
about 12&deg; 15' W. when we saw those breakers.</p>
<p>On the 19th, the wind was fluttering all round the compass
without any steadiness.</p>
<p>The following day we had it from E.S.E. to E. At noon, by
observation, our lat. was 32&deg; 31' S. Petrels, albatrosses,
and pintadoes, were numerous. The weather was very cold; the
mercury fell to 64&deg;.</p>
<p>On the 21st, having got nearly into the latitude of the Cape,
we bent our cables, but the wind which had hung so long to the S.
seemed determined to oppose us, the more unlucky as we had got
enough of southing, and now wanted misting. It continued till the
23d at E. and N.N.E. so variable were the winds at this season of
the year from what they are supposed to be in these southern
latitudes, and which is laid down to be in general from the W.
The sea was much smoother.</p>
<p>At three P.M. of the 23d, we saw a vessel bearing down before
the wind upon us. It now began to blow hard at N.N.E. The
stranger as she approached proved to be a Spanish brig with prize
colours up; captured in the River of Plate by a privateer fitted
out by a merchant at the Cape of Good Hope, commanded by Mr. John
Black, of whom I shall have occasion to make mention hereafter.
On coming within hail the prize-master informed me that he had
neither book or chart on board, and that he did not know where he
was. He had suffered considerably in the heavy weather we had
seen the breakers in, and begged some canvas and twine to repair
his sails, and a few other articles he stood in need of. I
desired him to keep company with me till the morning, informing
him of the course I intended steering, and that I would shorten
sail for him: I also gave him the latitude and longitude. The
brig was about seventy tons burthen, laden with bees wax, hides,
tallow and tobacco. On perceiving the shattered state of this
vessel, without a boat, she having it washed overboard, I could
not but be thankful we had not lost a single article from our
decks since we left the Thames. The wind moderated about eight
P.M. but with heavy rain, which continued during the night.</p>
<p>The wind shifted in the morning of the 24th, back to the W,
but moderate. Our boat was hoisted out, and sent for the
prize-master, to whom I gave a chart of the Cape, and the
harbours in its vicinity; Hamilton Moore's Epitome, some canvas,
twine, tea, sugar, and rum, which his men, from being constantly
wet, stood much in need of. He received these with many
expressions of thankfulness. I promised to keep him company to
the Cape if his vessel did not sail too slow. I also furnished
him with the declination for several days from the Nautical
Almanack. I was convinced, from his bearing down on us, that he
had lost both latitude and longitude, and asked why he would run
the risk, as we were painted like a Spaniard; but he said he knew
from our canvas we were not enemies. As to the crew, they were
careless what we were, for having lost themselves they were
determined to speak to us. The privateer had parted with the
prize in a gale of wind. The Master was much surprized at the
sight of the Lady Nelson, and concluded that we had started some
of our sheathing, when he saw one of the keels, as the vessel was
rolling from his. I explained the construction to him, which
being perfectly new excited his wonder. He asked me if she was
one of the King's yachts. When I sent him back to his own vessel,
he asked one of my men whether I was not a little mad, for he
could not credit the story I told him of our going on a voyage of
discovery. However, to shew his gratitude, he sent us some jerked
beef, of which he had plenty on board; and it proved an agreeable
change from our salt meat.</p>
<p>On the 25th, we had light airs, inclining to calm. Mercury at
64&deg;. Brig in company.</p>
<p>The following day strong gales with rain, and an heavy
following sea. Mercury from 60&deg; to 63&deg;.</p>
<p>On the 27th, we had numbers of birds round us. Strong gales
from N.W. Brig in company.</p>
<p>On the 28th, very heavy weather, but the little vessel behaved
very well. They who are conversant with the weather in the
vicinity of the Cape in the winter season, with a N.W. gale, must
know it is sufficient to try vessels of any description whatever.
On this day, the brig being a-head hoisted her colours, which was
the signal I had agreed the Master should make if he saw land
first. I was astonished at this, for my reckoning gave me no more
than 3&deg; E. It proved, however, nothing more than a cloud,
which he mistook for the land about the Table Mountain at the
Cape. Several pieces of rock weed floated past us this day. Our
lat. per account, was 34&deg; 24' S. long. 3&deg; 56' E.</p>
<p>On the 29th, it blew from the N.W. a perfect storm, and in so
irregular a manner, raising a very confused sea, accompanied with
torrents of rain and lightning, that we had not experienced since
we came out. At ten P. M. it shifted suddenly in a squall, and
blew as hard from S.S.W. and S.W. causing the sea to break so
much, that we were at midnight obliged to heave the vessel
to.</p>
<p>At day-light on the 30th, the S.W. wind had laid the N.W.
swell, so that we were enabled to bear up. Our companion had
partly laid to, and partly run under bare poles during the night,
so that he could but just be seen at day-light from the mast
head. At three P.M. we joined company.</p>
<p>The wind continued hovering between S.W. and W. sometimes
W.N.W. with thick cloudy weather till the 5th of June, when my
latitude by dead reckoning, (for we had not been able to get an
observation,) was 34&deg; 20' S. long. 17&deg; 27' E. We tried
for soundings with an hundred and fifty fathom line, but found
none.</p>
<p>On the 1st of July we had found the variation to be at sun-set
per amplitude 21&deg; 30' W.</p>
<p>It was nearly calm on the 6th, with a considerable sea. Our
companion began to be very uneasy, as he expected to have seen
land some time before. I gave him the declination from the
Nautical Almanack for a few days more. During the night we kept
a-head, as his men were few in number and much fatigued. The wind
hauled to the N.W. in the first part of the night, and then back
to S.S.W.</p>
<p>At five A.M. of the 7th we saw the land bearing S.S.E. and
made all possible sail for it. Threw out the signal to the brig.
At clear day-light the Lion's Rump S.E. by E. half E. distant
five leagues. The southernmost point of the Cape bearing S. about
eight or nine leagues. There was a great deal of sea going, and
the wind unsettled, fluttering sometimes in light airs, and then
bursting out in heavy squalls. Parted company with the brig,
which was bound for Table Bay. At seven A.M. tacked and stood to
sea in order to get in to Simon's Bay, as it is by no means safe
to anchor at this season in Table Bay on account of the N.W.
winds, which when they set in throw an immense sea into it, so
that few vessels are able to ride them out. These winds prevail
only in the winter season; that is, from the latter end of April
till September, when the S.E. winds set in at times in the summer
season with a great force in Simon's Bay. The latter being open
to the S.E. and the former to the N.W. are entered by ships,
according to the season of the year. At nine o'clock it fell
perfectly calm, with a lowering sky and heavy sea, which made me
think that we should have a favourable breeze from the N.W. But
after beating backward and forward till eleven o'clock we lost
ground. As a proof of the keels, though we had but little wind,
she never missed stays but once, when the way through the water
was scarcely perceivable; and such a body of water when she came
head to the sea, was sufficient to make any vessel miss stays:
perhaps when she did it, it was more my fault than hers. As we
had much sea for some days, it was observed by my first-mate, as
well as myself, that the vessel had more motion than we were
generally used to in such weather. He started his suspicions of
the main keel being gone; but it being impossible, in the weather
we had, to cast loose the boats that stood over the top of it, in
order to overhaul it, I would not suffer any mention to be made
of the subject until we had a proper season to investigate it; I
judged this also to be the case from the vessel not holding so
good a wind as usual: but more of this hereafter. As the wind now
freshened at S.S.W. I thought if it should come on to blow, from
the want of main and after-keels, we might not be able to fetch
any where, I determined to secure the port in view, and procure
those repairs to the keels that they stood in need of: besides,
as there were several small vessels in Table Bay, I was well
convinced the Lady Nelson could ride much more out of the weight
of the sea than most of them; particularly, as she drew at
present not more than five feet aft, and four forwards when the
keels were up. I therefore bore up, and was at anchor some time
before the brig which had left me in the morning. When I entered
the Bay, I found the vessel work into her berth very well; and at
five P.M. of the 8th, I dropped my anchor in Table Bay, having
been at sea ninety-nine days, independent of our stay at St.
Jago.</p>

<h3>[CHAPTER II.<br>
<br>
<a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a><i>Transactions at the Cape of
Good Hope</i>]</h3>
<br>
<p><small>I</small> intended to stop no longer in Table Bay, at
this season of the year, than was necessary to get my vessel's
keels repaired, which was instantly set out by order of Admiral
Sir Roger Curtis, who sent the builder of the naval yard to
survey them. On getting up the main-keel, we found it broken
short off in the wake of a bolt, as had happened to the
after-keel, as already mentioned, and with such force that the
bolt was twisted in different forms from the strain it received
in breaking. On further examination, we perceived that the bolt
running from one side of the keel to the other, which secured the
planks it was composed of, had not been, from the boring of the
holes, fairly introduced; as on one side there was not in some
places above an eighth of an inch solid wood, though composed of
oak plank of three inches and a half thick; so that there was
about two inches of solid wood on one side of the bolt, and very
little more at any one part than half an inch in the opposite
side. Here again was a most flagrant degree of neglect in the
eyes of every person who saw it; and was particularly observed by
the Admiral and Mr. Boswell, builder's assistant, employed at
this time to carry on the duty at Table Bay, in the absence of
the master-builder, who was obliged to be with the men of war in
Simon's Bay. It being impossible to repair the old keels, two new
ones were ordered to be made; and as we had twice suffered by the
bolts passing from one side of the keels to the other, I proposed
having them fastened by bars of iron or copper let in level with
the surface of the wood, one bar on a side opposite each other,
secured with bolts passing through both bars and the keel in the
middle of them, rivetting the ends of the bolts on each side. Two
of these bars should be applied within three feet of the head of
the keel, and two in like manner at the same distance from the
lower end of it, with this idea that one bolt would be sufficient
in the middle, and that these bands would prevent the planks from
warping. It may be proper to observe, that it was evident the
bolts which had secured the former keels were not driven through
the planks in a right line; not, perhaps, owing so much to the
holes being bored at equal distances from the ends, so as to
become parallel with each other, but from the driving, which
being obliged to be tight, might from the jerk of the stroke
throw the bolt out of straight direction, as it appeared that one
end of the bolts which, in the first instance passed through the
heart of the planks, was higher than the other, as if they had
been driven aslant, which left a small auger-hole beneath it
unfilled, according as it had been wooded. As to the bolts, I
confess, I was not partial to them, as they appeared to take away
the strength of the wood. Mr. Boswell, being a young man of
talents and genius in his profession, saw these defects, and
proposed, in addition to the bars abovementioned, that in place
of the bolts passing right through the keel from side to side,
rag-bolts should be substituted in their room, passing only half
way through each plank; and that no two bolts should fall in a
direct line with each other, the planks by this means would be
pinned one to another without any more than half of each being
perforated in any one place. With the approbation of the Admiral
this mode was adopted, and with bolts and bonds of copper the
whole was soon finished in a stile, that from the experience I
afterwards had of them reflected the greatest credit on the
builder.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* This, like many observations I have been
obliged to make on leaks, &amp;c. has proceeded from the fault of
the workmanship, and not any fault in the original plan.&mdash;As
the fore-keel, which was constantly used in the worst of weather,
absolutely lasted the voyage, and was in the vessel when I left
her.]</p>
<p>On the 16th we sailed for Simon's Bay, and anchored the
following day at nine o'clock A.M. I found there his Majesty's
ship Porpoise, which had sailed from Spithead with us, bound to
New Holland; the commander of which thought we had returned to
Portsmouth, after parting company with the East India fleet on
the 23d of March. From that Officer I learned, that the night we
parted one of the Indiamen had lost her top-masts, and that the
Porpoise on her passage had been obliged to cut away one of her
boats, which was slung on her quarter; and likewise had her
foremast damaged. I was very thankful that the Lady Nelson, which
was not deemed seaworthy, should have performed her voyage to the
Cape without losing a stitch of canvas, or having a spar of any
kind damaged, and that we had our three boats safe on the deck.
After this, surely even those who do not approve of such
constructed vessels will not attribute it to chance, but to the
proper cause, her goodness.</p>
<p>As I intended to wait for a more convenient season to make our
passage to New Holland, I for this reason moved from Table Bay to
Simon's Bay, avoiding by this means the violent N.W. winds, and
heavy sea which rolls into the former from the 1st of May till
the middle of September. From the construction of the Lady
Nelson, and the little depth of water she drew, (not exceeding
four feet when the keels were up,) we could have rode with safety
in Table Bay, as some vessels at this time did. Vessels like ours
would be highly serviceable at the Cape, either when the N.W.
wind blows, as already observed, or when the S.E. winds prevail
and have a similar effect on the bays which open to the eastward.
The construction of the keels admits of the vessels being laid on
shore, or even hauled up on it, advantages which must be obvious
to every one who has witnessed a gale of wind in this
quarter.</p>
<p>My orders being to remain at the Cape till the summer season
commenced, a considerable stay for a circumnavigator, I therefore
embraced every opportunity of gratifying my curiosity with
respect to the state of the Colony. Had I been possessed of the
accounts given by those who have published them, I might have
availed myself of their observations; but that not being the
case, the candid reader will excuse me, if his wishes are not so
fully answered by the particulars which occurred to me, or from
the information of some friends I found there.</p>
<p>On entering Table Bay every voyager is attracted by the
majestic appearance of the Table Hill, whose head is often hid
amongst the clouds. Many writers have given various measurements
of this mountain; the following, however, I trust will be found
correct. During my stay at the Cape I had the good fortune to
procure them.</p>

<br>
<p>These are the perpendicular heights of all the most
conspicuous parts of this majestic pile of Nature; at the foot of
which, facing the Bay, stands Cape Town. The Beach on landing
presents rather an unfavourable appearance to a stranger, as the
fishermen and sailors in its vicinity are none of the cleanliest;
however, this is amply compensated by the town, which for
neatness and uniformity of building, with regularity of plan, is
deserving of much encomium. If the capital of Southern Africa has
not to boast of the superb palaces which decorate many others,
yet it is without those wretched edifices which are partitioned
off for the poor. Every inhabitant of Cape Town is master of the
entrance to his house, and not a beggar is to be seen in the
streets; as few Europeans, who have industry sufficient to
undertake a voyage here, need be without employment. The
Government of the Colony also obliges masters to maintain their
decayed and aged slaves: indeed, the Dutch are very indulgent to
those Africans, (the appellation for those slaves that are born
at the Cape,) and the Malays employed for domestic purposes: but
the lot of many of those who till the vineyards, and the
half-naked Mozambiques, who are occupied in carrying wood, is
very different. The consequence of the master is mostly derived
from the size of his house, and the number of slaves he is
possessed of.</p>
<p>Had the English retained the Colony, the labour of the
wood-carriers might have been dispensed with, as coals might have
been sent from New Holland, as will hereafter be shewn; or by
working the mines of the Colony, which there is every reason to
suppose contain abundance of this article, a consideration of the
utmost importance, where wood is scarce or at a distance, and the
labour of slaves exorbitant.</p>
<p>In the course of my excursions I could not fail remarking from
the heights of Wineberg, commanding a view of both Bays, that the
sea once occupied what is now an Isthmus, thereby making the
peninsula of the Table Mountain, Cape Point, &amp;c. an island.
In travelling into the interior, you go over about twenty miles
of this dreary Isthmus formed by ridges of sand containing
shells. The country here is interspersed with extensive salt and
fresh water lakes. On the opposite side the land again rises, and
a ridge of high mountains extending S.E. and N.W. form a bather
to the interior. From these mountains warm medicinal springs
issue in different parts. The Dutch have formed baths and built
huts near them for the accommodation of invalids; particularly at
the following places; Elephant's River, Brandt's Valley, and
Swaart Berg. The bath first mentioned is celebrated for the cure
of ulcers and cutaneous eruptions; but from its distance and
difficulty of access it is not so much frequented as the others.
The accommodations are therefore much inferior, and rendered
inconvenient from the only farm-houses in the neighbourhood being
on the opposite side of the river, which is frequently
impassable. It lies in a long narrow valley, scarcely a mile and
half in width, bounded by rocks almost perpendicular. The banks
of the river are covered with bushes containing abundance of
game, particularly pheasants.</p>
<p>The springs at Brandt's Valley are greatly esteemed for
gravelly complaints. They pour forth a little river of very hot
water, which has the appearance of boiling. I do not exactly
recollect the degree of temperature of it; but it was below the
boiling point, as we tried an egg in it for ten minutes which it
did not boil hard, though it considerably thickened the
consistency of the white of it. A considerable degree of trouble
is saved to those who live near this spring by scalding their
fowls and pigs in it, a practice not very grateful to the taste
of those who go there to drink the water. Sportsmen who visit
this quarter must be careful that their dogs do not go into the
water, for if their feet are scalded it deprives them of the
ability to extricate themselves from it.</p>
<p>These springs bubble through a bed of sand at the foot of a
steep rock, forming a pool, from which they descend in a stream
of about eight feet wide, and two or three feet deep, running
upwards of an hundred yards before the water is sufficiently cool
to admit of being branched off for the supply of the baths.</p>
<p>The narrow and sequestered Brandt's Valley contains but one
farm, the dwelling-house of which is near the bath huts, and
there people of a superior description may be accommodated. The
valley is hemmed in by towering mountains, whose rugged
overhanging sides form some of the boldest features of Nature.
From these it is curious to observe the progress of the smoking
stream through the silent glen, disposing the mind to romantic
ideas. I could not avoid recalling to my remembrance the
mountains of Morven, and the lake of Lago in Ossian's Poems.</p>
<p>The baths at Swaart Berg are strongly chalybeate. They are
much frequented; and the accommodations are far superior to the
other two. All ranks assemble here at certain seasons, as well
for pleasure as health, from Cape Town, and the delightful
villages of Stellenbosch and the Paard. These <i>Fashionables</i>
have an opportunity of enjoying as great a transition to
inconvenience and expence, by crouding into the huts, as the
Nobility and Gentry of Britain experience at our watering places:
and I consider the <i>Speeclactries</i> of the Dutch Boors better
adapted to their education and manners, than the amusements of
ass and smock races, lately in vogue at Margate, &amp;c. to more
refined understandings.</p>
<p class="foot">[* A term for romping, low jokes and
pastimes.]</p>
<p>At this place my relation Doctor James Robert Grant, Surgeon
to the Staff at the Cape, met with a Doctor Brandt, who
afterwards accompanied me in the Lady Nelson. This eccentric
Gentleman had been wrecked in Delgoa Bay, on board the Lion East
Indiaman, to which ship he had belonged in a medical capacity. He
travelled by land to Cape Town; where, on his arrival, he related
many extraordinary adventures which he bad encountered on his
journey, with some circumstances respecting the existence of the
unicorn, that influenced many in the belief there was in reality
such an animal. Without entering into any investigation of the
absurd notions of this literary oddity, I think it but proper to
remark, that those best acquainted with the country, whom I have
had an opportunity of conversing with on the subject, doubt the
existence of it, and with much propriety. The Eeland (Bounde Bock
or Coddo) whose horns resemble very much the one depicted for the
unicorn, from their being placed so near to each other, and
scarcely diverging, will evidently, in a profile view by a rude
artist, be frequently represented as one; and this is often
perceived in the small sticks made by the Hottentots, on which
these animals are scratched, and accounts most satisfactorily for
the figures discovered in the caves of the Boschmen, which have
been brought in evidence of the existence of the unicorn.</p>
<p>As Dr. Brandt and his companions, (a dog and a baboon,) formed
an important addition to the complement of the Lady Nelson, it
will be proper to relate some of the circumstances under which I
received this extraordinary man, whose constant restless
disposition prevented him from performing any thing he undertook.
Had this not been the case, he might have been of infinite
service in discovering the interior of New South Wales. Dr. Grant
and Mr. Farquhar, Agent Victualler at the Cape, having on a tour
to Elephant's River in the East, and across the country to
Swellendam in the West, stopped a few days on their return at the
baths at Swaart Berg, found Dr. Brandt practising the healing art
to the invalids who frequented them. Hearing of the arrival of a
gentleman of his own profession, he paid his respects to the
visitors; to whom he complained loudly of the ingratitude of the
Dutch in not rewarding professional exertions, stating, that they
had nearly consumed his stock of medicines, without returning him
any thing to purchase more: lie was therefore anxious to change
his quarters, more particularly, as the <i>Frows</i> in their
<i>Speeclactries</i> used too great liberties with him. On
questioning the landlord of the house respecting these
circumstances, it was easy to perceive that though the doctor did
not profit by his abilities, yet it had a visible effect on the
landlord's house, who found his visitors increase; he therefore
laughed at the doctor's complaints, adding, it was his own fault
if he had not enough to satisfy him; as he had a constant
invitation to his house and table; but he was so extraordinary a
man, that he preferred a piece of bread and a draught of water in
a hovel by the side of the bath, neglecting both his invitations
and the patients to wander in the neighbouring mountains with his
dog and his baboon. It was no uncommon thing for him to be absent
for several days, and to return quite exhausted with hunger and
fatigue, with the acquisition of a bag, filled with herbs, roots
and stones. This description of the doctor, instead of having the
effect the Dutch boor meant it should, interested Dr. Grant much
in the poor man's favour. Had he possessed forbearance enough to
confine a proportion of his marvellous embellishments, the
extensive knowledge he possessed of the dead and modern languages
would have corroborated the account he gave of his having a great
property on the Banks of the Rhine, which he had quitted on the
approach of the French, and of his declared aversion to
democratic principles. As to his knowledge of medicine, he had
studied it as a branch of science. From the account which he gave
of himself, and his wretched appearance, Mr. Farquhar, with
kindness and humanity, offered him an asylum in his house near
Cape Town; from whence he might have every conveniency in the
accomplishment of his favourite excursions. Unfortunately he had
but one opportunity of doing this previous to the death of his
worthy patron. The arrival of the Lady Nelson happened luckily
for the Doctor, who had now met with a sincere friend in Dr.
Grant; and as I wanted a person who combined Medical knowledge
with a turn for Natural History, he was recommended to me. Dr.
Brandt was more indifferent in stipulating for himself than for
his baboon and dog, which he represented as the faithful and
useful companions of his wanderings. He expatiated warmly on the
services of the former. To him he had been indebted for
sustenance; for when in want of bread he had recourse to roots,
which he first offered to Jackoo; who having examined and tasted
them, threw away with disgust such as were prejudicial, and eat
such as were otherwise, of which the Doctor partook. As to his
dog, he guarded him from wolves, and hyenas. Though the whole of
this party was rather too great an addition to so small a vessel
as mine, yet I was so much interested in the poor man's
situation, that I gave directions for their admission.</p>
<p>During my stay in Simon's Bay I made several excursions to the
tops of the hills which overhang Simon's Town, and was much
surprized to find there an extensive flat, with a rivulet running
through it. The soil and extent of it appear capable of producing
abundance of vegetables, and affording the means of rearing
poultry, &amp;c. It is therefore singular that this fine piece of
ground should have been so long neglected, when these articles
are so extremely scarce and dear. In the confined spot on which
Simon's Town stands there being no such conveniences, the
inhabitants, as well as those on board ships, must depend on
supplies from the opposite side of Table Bay, where a small
Creek, called Gordon's Bay, penetrates into Hottentot
Holland.</p>
<p>In mentioning this Creek, it may not be improper to observe,
that from its proximity to the Kloof, (a hill so called,) and
other circumstances, it would be a favourable place for a
debarkation, in case of any future attack upon the Cape, even
should the principal landing be effected in Table Bay; a measure
which appears to me by no means impracticable in a country which
naturally presents so many obstacles to the progress of an
army.</p>
<p>It is not for me to decide on the advantages or disadvantages
which the retention of this Colony might be of to Britain. Its
productions in its present state are certainly trifling to this
country; but the great. extent and unequal surface of the country
affording such a variety of soils and climate, it is probable
that by a proper exertion of the natives, many useful articles of
produce might be introduced, and the making of wine carried both
in variety and quality to a very great degree of improvement and
trade. An inland navigation could be conducted between False and
Table Bay, which would greatly obviate the inconvenience arising
from ships being obliged to shift round at the particular
seasons. It would likewise save the expence of land-carriage for
many articles from one place to another.</p>
<p>The Creeks also, which have been recently ascertained by
Captain Callender, penetrating into the vast forests on the
Eastern Coast, offer the means of extending the coasting trade,
the safety of which I have already hinted would be greatly
secured by the use of vessels with sliding keels.</p>
<p>With all the improvements this country is capable of, the
probability is, that the revenues would never defray the expence
in the hands of the English, though it would be capable of much
annoyance in the possession of an enterprizing Maritime Power
like ours.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that the late mild and just Government has
left a favourable impression of the British character on the
minds of the discerning part of the inhabitants: yet at the same
time it is to be feared that the democratic principles, which
have been instilled into the Dutch by their French neighbours at
home, have many warm advocates in Cape Town and its vicinity.
Perhaps it would not be fair to ascertain the character of the
African Dutch from the variety of people of all nations in the
town, or those in its neighbourhood, whose habits or dispositions
are affected by an intercourse with Caffres, Bosch-men, and
vagrant Hottentots. Probably we may be more successful in the
Midland Districts, such as the Twenty Four Rivers, Roodtland, and
the course of the Broad River. There we view the African Boor,
whose simplicity is not destroyed by attacks from the one side,
or his comfort from the other. He abounds with the necessaries of
life, and has but few inducements to indulge avarice or
sensuality. The sale of a few cattle, together with some trips
annually to Cape Town with butter, and other articles of small
bulk, procure him the means of providing clothes, coffee, tea and
sugar. Wine, brandy, and tobacco are the produce of his farm, the
superintendence of which, and his distance, prevent him from
carrying to market; having neither the cravings of luxury or the
necessity of providing for rent, tithes and taxes, to induce him.
This, added to the want of inns, and consequently of intercourse,
may have an effect of rendering hospitality so general a trait in
those districts; and with the assistance of climate account for
the gigantic and phlegmatic appearance of the people.</p>
<p>The nature of this country requires hospitality, which seems
practised as a duty, not requiring the stimulus of ostentation.
On the arrival of the stranger, he is neither accosted with bows
or grimaces, nor is a family put in an uproar to distress him: if
the unwieldy Boor rises from his seat, and relinquishes his pipe
to approach the new-comer, it is to be considered rather as a
mark of extraordinary respect than a necessary token of welcome.
The words <i>oot span</i> and <i>coom binnen</i>, (which in Dutch
imply <i>to unharness</i> and <i>come in</i>) are signals of the
latter. Such as look for punctilio and officiousness will be
disappointed. They who can accommodate themselves to the fare of
the house have an opportunity of passing their time
agreeably.</p>
<p>I am aware that this account may be different from what many
have experienced whose stay at the Cape only admitted of
excursions to Stellenbosch, the Paard, and such places as are
influenced by frequent intercourse with, and habits of the town:
had they proceeded farther, they would most probably coincide
with my observation.</p>
<p>Let it be remembered that some knowledge of the Dutch language
is an essential recommendation of the traveller; for though
taciturnity is a general trait amongst the Boors, yet they like
to be addressed familiarly. If the usual interrogatories
of&mdash;How old? and, Are you married? be not attended to, they
are apt to construe the cause into proud repugnance.</p>
<p>I shall conclude my observations on the researches which the
interior of this interesting Colony affords, by remarking to
those who attribute the <i>variety</i> of the human species to
the effect of climate:</p>
<p>The extreme contrast between the Hottentots, Boschmen, and
Caffres inhabiting the same latitude. The former of a pale yellow
colour, hideous contracted features, with scarcely the appearance
of a nose; and is probably the most diminutive of the human race;
whereas the Caffre is dark in his complexion, open in his
countenance, tall and athletic; and this striking difference
seems to extend to their mental as well as corporeal
qualities.</p>
<p>The very weapons which they use seem to indicate this. The
Boschman, concealing himself in his bush, lets fly his poisoned
arrow at the object of his prey, but there is no poison in the
hasseguay of the Caffre, which he advances and throws at his
enemy with dexterity and strength. It remains to be known what
the Caffre with his simple weapon can effect, when he rendered
himself worthy the attention of the active Government, and
respectable force which has of late existed there under the
British. Without such a force it will probably require more than
an usual exertion of the Dutch to confine the Caffre bands within
their present limits. To what extent these vary from the
<i>nominal</i> boundary of the great Fish River, it is not in my
power to determine.</p>
<p>I now returned to Simon's Town, where the Lady Nelson lay
ready to prosecute her voyage. About this time several extra East
India ships had arrived at the Cape; many of which had received
considerable damage in their passage, particularly the Phoenix.
That vessel suffered much in her masts and rigging, which joined
to her being weakly manned, and other casualties, had rendered it
necessary for the Captain, and some of the passengers, to exert
themselves in the duties of foremast men. From the information of
a young Gentleman, one of the passengers, whose relations I am
acquainted with, and the testimony of others on board, I am
enabled to state, that owing to the persevering example of the
Captain, and his good seamanship, he extricated his vessel from
many dangers and brought her safe into Table Bay. The Wellesley,
extra ship, commanded by Captain Peter Gordon, in her passage out
was parted from the convoy, nearly in the latitude of Rio
Janeiro, and soon after chased by a French ship of much superior
force in guns and weight of metal. Finding it impossible to
escape, he determined to hazard an action, which accordingly took
place, and lasted above an hour, when the Frenchman sheered off.
The Wellesley was mostly manned with Lascars; but the Officers of
the ship were gallantly supported by the passengers. The number
of souls on board did not exceed ninety, and the guns were
nine-pounders; whilst the enemy was full of men, and from the
weight of some of the shot afterwards taken out of the sides of
the Wellesley, she had twelve-pounders. Not a man was killed on
board of Captain Gordon's ship. The Frenchman continued in sight
for two days, but did not think proper to renew the engagement,
probably from the circumstance of his having suffered much. The
capture of the Wellesley would have been a very serious loss to
the Cape, as she was laden with Government stores. The conduct of
the gallant Captain and those on board, weak as they were, is the
more deserving notice and praise. By this ship I received orders
from his Grace the Duke of Portland, one of his Majesty's
Principal Secretaries of State, to search for the Strait which
separates Van Dieman's Land from New Holland, and to make my
passage, if possible, through it. The fortunate prosecution of
which will be seen hereafter.</p>
<p>As the time for my departure drew near, I was often teased
with groundless fears and apprehensions formed by idle people, on
the account of the seas which so small and singularly constructed
a vessel as mine had to encounter in the run from the Cape to New
Holland. However, the winter passage we had already made with so
much safety, joined to the good opinion the crew entertained of
the Lady Nelson, and their determination not to quit me, brought
us many visitors, and numbers of volunteers from different ships
in the Bay. But as I conceived my crew sufficient, with the
addition of the Doctor and a carpenter (whom I procured here), I
declined all farther offers, to the disappointment of many. I was
still under the necessity of accepting an addition, which I would
rather have dispensed with, in the person of a Dane, gigantic in
his appearance, who had been boatswain of one of the extra ships
arrived at the Cape in a state of mutiny. He had been tried and
sentenced to transportation to New South Wales. The request for
my taking this man on board coming from Admiral Sir Roger Curtis,
I could not object to it, as I felt myself much indebted to him
for his polite attention to myself, and the interest he took in
the completion of every thing the Lady Nelson required. The man
was sent on board in irons, which I liberated him from, and found
him afterwards to be an excellent seaman, active, willing, and
occasioning no trouble. This induced me to recommend his case to
the Governor of New South Wales, and he obtained his emancipation
soon after my arrival.</p>
<p>Before taking leave of the Cape, I beg the indulgence of
acknowledging my obligations to the Commandant of Simon's Town,
Major Stephen Collins, of the 81st regiment, and his Family, and
the Officers composing the Garrison during my stay there, for
their great attention and hospitality; to Doctor Pattison,
Surgeon to the Naval Department, Messrs. Smith, Mould, &amp;c.
&amp;c. For so pleasing and valuable a society I am principally
indebted to my friend Dr. Grant, of the Hospital Staff, whom I
have already mentioned, as being resident there; to this
Gentleman I am moreover under many other obligations. Dr. Grant
had been appointed to take charge of the sick of the 22d and 34th
regiments, which two regiments sailed from England at the same
time I did, and being chiefly composed of boys had suffered much
during the voyage. Through that Gentleman's former knowledge of
the Cape I derived much useful information, for which I am
indebted to his liberal communications.</p>

<h3>[CHAPTER III.<br>
<br>
<a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a><i>Run from the Cape of Good Hope
to New Holland</i>]</h3>
<br>
<p>On the 7th of October, being completely equipped, I put to sea
at eleven A.M. with a fine breeze from the N.W. and bid adieu to
many who came down to see the <i>little</i> vessel depart, most
of whom entertained doubts of our ever reaching New South Wales.
At four P.M. I got clear out of False Bay, and at seven in the
evening Cape Hanglip bore E.N.E. and the Cape of Good Hope N.W.
&frac12;W. distant five leagues. We had now fresh gales from the
W. and W.N.W. which in the night freshened with rain and a
considerable sea. I found that the vessel had lost none of her
good qualities; and as the S.E. Monsoon had set in at this
season, which blows with much force at times, I was determined to
keep as much as possible out of its track, by getting into a
higher south latitude as fast as I could. It was recommended to
me to run down my casting without going into a higher latitude
than the Cape, from an idea that the heaviness of the sea in the
latitude of 40&deg; S. would be too much for my vessel to scud
through, owing to the W. winds blowing in these latitudes
constantly all the year round, and generally from the S. and W.
thereby occasioning much heavy sea, hail, sleet, &amp;c. Being
well assured of the safety of my vessel, joined to the delays
that might attend my keeping in variable latitudes subject to the
strong S.E. winds, I prosecuted for some time my course to the
southward, judging that on finding ourselves in too heavy weather
we could leave it by hauling to the northward, and keeping in
that parallel which best answered my purpose; at the same time
securing a fair W. wind. Independent of this being my own idea, I
was encouraged in it by Captain John Osborn, of his Majesty's
ship Tremendous, an old and experienced Officer, whose attention
to me whilst at the Cape, joined to much good advice concerning
my voyage, I am happy in having the opportunity to acknowledge,
and to say that I profited by it.</p>
<p>At six A.M. we had squally weather with much rain, which by
noon cleared off, and we observed the latitude to be 35&deg; 40'
S. I still continued running to the southward, and found, as we
got into an higher latitude, the wind to increase with much rain
at times, and in general gloomy and uncomfortable weather, though
we had not as yet met with the S.W. winds so much looked for. In
the latitude of 36&deg; and 37&deg; I found that they hung in the
N.W. quarter, and shifted to N. and N.E.</p>
<p>On the 10th, I observed at noon the latitude to be 38&deg; 40'
S. We had much following sea, though not in my opinion wind
enough to raise or cause it. The wind had varied from E.N.E. to
N.W. by N. It had every appearance of blowing, and as I have
often found since in these high southern latitudes, that the sea
frequently gets to a great height before the gale comes on, I
have also observed, that after a gale has done blowing for some
time the sea will continue to rise, break much, and become very
troublesome. It is no uncommon thing to find an heavy gale that
has continued to blow with great violence, and steady for many
hours, die away in the course of half an hour to almost a perfect
calm. To many who are in large heavy vessels, like those in
general made use of in crossing these seas, some of the above
particulars might, and I believe are but little observed or
attended to; but owing to the small size of the Lady Nelson, it
became of the utmost importance to me to attend particularly to
all those evolutions: in larger vessels the sea is not so much
felt. As I observed above, we had this day no more than a fresh
wind with a heavy following sea; insomuch, that the difference of
latitude, by observation at noon, was fifteen miles more than our
distance run. It perhaps might be owing to currents; however I am
inclined to impute it to the power the sea has over the light
draught of water of small vessels like mine when going before it.
Soon after noon it came on to blow very heavy, so that before
night we were obliged to hand every thing except the close-reefed
main-top-sail, and reefed fore-sail. The vessel scudded through
the sea remarkably well, though it had got up to an uncommon
height, and so perpendicular, that when getting over it appeared
as running down a steep precipice; yet she did not ship any water
of consequence. From the magnified stories I had heard at the
Cape, I was in some degree led to believe I should not have less
all the way, I therefore made some easting and endeavoured to
keep in this parallel of latitude, until I saw how the weather
would turn out. At twelve P.M. it freshened so much that we were
obliged to bunt the fore-sail, and let the vessel run with the
close-reefed main-top-sail lowered down on the cap all night,
which she did perfectly easy and dry. I am aware that many seamen
may think scudding under a main-top-sail in a brig is a bad plan
in case of broaching to, and prefer going under the
fore-top-sail; but here is another advantage, which vessels with
sliding keels have over others. Vessels in general broach to in a
sea from not answering their helms sufficiently quick, perhaps
from the force of the sea depriving, by its lift for a time, the
rudder of its power. It is often occasioned in deep-loaded
vessels, by their being too much loaded by the head; so that in
all weathers they require a great deal of weather-helm, or as it
is termed <i>steer wild</i>. In these cases, no doubt, a
fore-top-sail is serviceable to pay off the vessel again by. But
it has also the disadvantage, that it will often bury her more in
the sea, and not admit of her being so lively as she might prove
from a sail more in the center. Some are of opinion that a
fore-top-sail makes a vessel lively by the force of the wind,
serving as it were to lift the vessel up; but in small short
ones, in a heavy towering sea, it will be found to impel them
much faster downwards, than in assisting them to rise to it,
frequently burying the bowsprit in the water, if not carrying it
entirely away. By such means every thing may be washed off the
decks, and the vessel much strained. The sliding keels in this
last respect are particularly serviceable, because the trim of
the vessel, that is, the draught of water at either extremity may
be altered at pleasure; by which means if properly attended to,
she may be steered in the heaviest weather with the greatest
ease, and in general weather without touching the helm at all. In
all cases, a vessel of this description can be brought up, or
fall off faster than her sails can be trimmed to the wind. There
is another great advantage, which is, in heaving-to quickly in an
heavy sea: this is particularly useful in small craft, as I have
often experienced, by having the sail ready to set that I
intended to lay-to under, and watching the passing of one sea,
with proper attention to the keels, and taking the head-sail
quickly off as the helm is put down; by which means the vessel
will be round head-to the next following sea, and would stay if
not prevented by again righting the helm. This cannot be done in
other vessels, they must be brought-to gradually, and often ship
many seas before that can be accomplished, as their beam must
necessarily for a time be exposed, and in deep-loaded vessels,
frequently attended with the loss of every thing on deck from the
force of the sea.</p>
<p>The same heavy weather continued with very little variation,
accompanied with hail at times, and heavy rain till the 12th,
when it began to moderate, and towards noon the gale had nearly
subsided, but left behind it an high troublesome cross sea, which
made the vessel tumble about a great deal, and ship some water at
times. As the wind had varied during the gale from N. by E. to
W.N.W. hauling back at times to N.N.W. and N.W. I altered our
course as I found it convenient, keeping the vessel right before
the wind, which, as it did not lead us out of our way, I
preferred on account of the heaviness of the sea we had got into,
which at times broke much: I was therefore from this circumstance
obliged at all times to have a watchful eye upon the sea, and
throw the vessel directly before it without regarding any
particular course, by which means she shipped little water. At
noon on the 12th, by observation, I found we were in lat. 38&deg;
17' S. long. by account, 27&deg; 18' E.&mdash;We this day had
many birds of the Pintadoe and Petterel kind about us. One of the
former species, a very beautiful bird, in the height of the gale,
from what cause I know not, unless it had overeaten itself, fell
down on the deck, and vomited a greenish sort of matter as it was
falling. One of the men picked it up, and brought it to me, but I
ordered it to be laid on the deck, where it scrambled about till
it got behind a hen-coop, when it lay quiet. I have reason to
believe that aquatic birds, which chiefly prey on the water, and
but seldom visit land, are incapable of walking, but assist
themselves by scrambling with their feet and wings; at least all
I have had an opportunity of observing did so. After remaining
behind the coop about fifteen minutes, the bird again scrambled
to the side of the vessel, and dropped into the water, where it
appeared for the short time we saw it as lively as any of the
others, which were in numbers about us, both in the water and on
the wing. It is certain that the black Haglet, which I have
several times mentioned in this narrative, procures its food by
often harassing and fighting with other birds, particularly a
species of gull (called by the seamen, the Fisherman) until they
throw up the food they have swallowed, which the other instantly
seizes on. Probably this might have been the cause of the
Pintadoe taking shelter with us. Hereafter I shall have occasion
to notice these kind of birds.</p>
<p>On the 13th, we had moderate fine weather, which enabled us to
determine the longitude by observation of the sun and moon's
nearest limb to be 29&deg; E. of Greenwich. By account it was
29&deg; 55' E. We had the wind at W.N.W.; towards evening it
hauled to the S. and E. bringing with it squalls and rain, which
gradually came round to the S.W. when we had clear steady
weather.</p>
<p>On the 14th at noon, we were in latitude 38&deg; 1' S. by
observation. From this I judged that we had nothing to fear from
the latitudes, which I had been informed were likely to give us
much trouble in regard to the seas generally met with in them. As
I had scudded through a very heavy one in the last gale without
the smallest loss or damage, I intended not to get farther to the
N. than 38&deg; S. or to the S. than 40', as to the N. of the
first mentioned latitude variable winds might much retard my
progress, and in the latter we should have as much wind as we
could make a good use of without trouble or inconveniency. Though
it is laid down as a general rule that strong W. or S.W. winds
prevail or are to be met with in latitudes 35&deg; and 36&deg; S.
I shaped a course more S. and on the 16th at noon, observed the
latitude to be 38&deg; 44' S. and the variation, per sun's
amplitude at setting, 28&deg; 45' W. We had a strong breeze with
rain the greatest part of the following day; but on the 18th the
weather became very fine. The variation per sun's amplitude at
setting was 31&deg; 47' W. As usual I ordered the bedding and
clothes upon deck, cleaned thoroughly below by washing the cabins
and berths with vinegar, and sprinkling oil of tar in all places
where the air had not a free circulation. From this day till the
22d the weather was uncommonly fine, the wind generally from S.W.
to N.W.N. N.W. and W.S.W. On the last mentioned day the weather
became dark and cloudy, with fresh gales and heavy showers of
rain at times. A number of Pintadoes, Petterels and Albatrosses
of a large size were about us. We had no observation at noon. At
midnight we were under close-reefed main-top-sail and fore-sail;
but at day-light it moderated.</p>
<p>On the 23d, we observed at noon our latitude to be 39&deg; 44'
S. These repetitions of latitudes, longitudes and weather, will
be tedious and unsatisfactory to those who are not seamen or
navigators; but to the latter who may pursue a similar track, and
perhaps in a small vessel, it may be useful to know that in these
parallels of latitude no land has been met with; and which as we
got on to the E. was determined by our running down our easting
in a parallel of latitude that no vessel we have any account of
ever pursued; that is to say, in the parallel of 38&deg; and
39&deg; S. from Amsterdam Island until we made the S. and W.
sides of New Holland.</p>
<p>On the 24th, we had variable and squally weather with showers
of hail and sleet; however, it did not prevent our having an
observation at noon, when we found our latitude to be 39&deg; 13'
S. The following day at noon we were in latitude 38&deg; 49' S.
The weather cold and raw with sleet and snow, and an heavy cross
sea running. However, the vessel got through it very well.</p>
<p>On the 26th, we found the variation to be, per azimuth at
sun-rising, 26&deg; 57' W. latitude by observation at noon
39&deg; S. longitude from lunar observation, sun and moon taken,
forty-three minutes past noon, 60&deg; 46' E. of Greenwich.</p>
<p>The weather until the 29th was various, generally squally with
rain and sleet. On the 28th at noon, by observation, we were in
lat. 38&deg; 54' S. The following day the wind hauled to the N.E.
and N.N.E.: had no observation this day, but by account it was
39&deg; 1' S. Towards evening the wind from N.E. freshened into a
heavy gale, so that we were obliged to heave the vessel to, as it
blew with great violence in gusts with heavy showers of sleet and
hail. The sea was so powerful that it often, from striking the
bow of the vessel, threw her off so far as to expose her beam
very much when in the trough of the hollow sea, which becalmed,
nearly, the small after-sail we had set on her: I therefore tried
the effect of a drag-sail, giving it a good scope. It answered
remarkably well, and at the same time prevented her from making
much drift; so that she never fell off more than three points,
and presently returned; that is, when we had the wind at N.W. by
W. to which point, when it veered round, she came up to N. by W.
and fell off to N.N.E. We also got the fore-topsail-yard on deck,
which eased her wonderfully, and made her much drier, though we
shipped but very little water. Owing to her little draught and
flat bottom she rose like a piece of cork on the top of every
wave.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock in the morning of the 30th, we had much less
wind, but a very heavy sea. We got up the fore-topsail-yard and
bore up. By double altitude of the sun we found the latitude to
be 39&deg; 50' S.</p>
<p>On the 31st the variation per amplitude was 26&deg; W.
latitude by observation at noon 39&deg; 28' S. long. by account
74&deg; 23' E. As I intended to touch, if possible, at the Island
of St. Paul, or at all events to get a sight of it, I made the
best of my way for that purpose.</p>
<p>The following day, the 1st of November, we had no observation
at noon; neither could we, from the thickness of the weather, get
a double altitude. Though deprived of the former, yet I depended
much on seeing the Island of Amsterdam, in order to correct my
longitude, and endeavour if possible to land on it. I therefore
made my arrangements for the night, in case of meeting with any
unforeseen accident. In the morning the weather proved clear,
which enabled me to see the wished-for island at eight o'clock
A.M. We steered close along the S.E. shore, and found frequent
flurries and gusts of wind accompanied with rain. Seamen in
passing close in shore ought to be guarded against these; for
though the weather was fine some miles from this land, insomuch
that we could carry every sail, yet on our approach we were
obliged to come under close-reefed topsails, and afterwards take
the fore-topsail in altogether. A thick cloud hovering over the
highest peak of the island indicated at this time unsteady
weather. They who have seen the top of the rock of Gibraltar when
the strong Levant winds are blowing, will be able to form a
better idea of this appearance than any thing I can say on the
subject.</p>
<p>The shore we passed along was pretty high and inaccessible,
until we opened the Bason described by all navigators who have
visited this place, and which is remarkable from a sugar-loaf
rock standing contiguous to it. This is the proper mark given for
bringing a vessel to anchor; and it does not appear till you are
close upon it, when keeping near the shore, owing to its being
hidden by a nook of land. Great care must be taken to have every
thing ready for immediately coming to an anchor, there being a
very strong outset from the Bason, which is felt the moment you
open the rock. In this instance we were particularly unfortunate.
I have before observed, that we had heavy flurries off the shore,
and that the Peak was covered with a cloud. The moment we had
opened the Bason, and got a sight of this rock, there came on so
violent a squall, with thick sleet and rain, that the land was
entirely hidden from our sight. The current also which setting
out very strong had caused a confused bubbling and troublesome
sea, and though we hauled to windward instantly, and made several
tacks, in order to gain the bank for anchoring, our efforts were
without effect, the wind and current being too powerful for us.
When the squall cleared off, we saw a flag staff and flag flying
on the top of the Peak, and knowing that people were often there
killing seals, I supposed that a party of these was there at that
time, which was confirmed to us, as will appear hereafter.
However, we could not discover this party though we had an
excellent telescope.</p>
<p>The appearance of Amsterdam Island is not favourable to the
eye from there being no trees on it. It is plentifully covered
with grass. The sea here abounds with fish and seals; which we
had an opportunity of proving as to the former, having caught
some very fine snappers. We did not observe many birds, owing,
perhaps, to their being at this season on shore breeding. We only
saw a flock of small white birds with swallow-forked tails; a few
pettrels and penguins, and a bird resembling a crow, but rather
larger, with a black back, and white breast. The boisterous
weather probably prevented our seeing any seals, which are said
to be numerous about this and the neighbouring island of St.
Paul. Of these islands little new can be related. John Henry
Coxe, Esq. in his voyage gives a very just and accurate
description of them, as far as I had an opportunity of observing.
Having his Work in my possession I referred to it as I sailed
along; and I am free to declare, from the accuracy of it, that he
has left little for others that may follow to do. I wished much
to have had an opportunity of observing, whether the warm
springs, taken notice of by all who have visited them, are salt
or fresh. This my worthy and esteemed friend Captain Schank
requested me to do; but I was disappointed by both wind and
current, and did not chuse to lose time through waiting for a
change in the former. The current I found hurried us on to the
S.E. and the wind varied from N.W. to S.W. altering every squall.
I had an observation at noon, when the body of the Island bore
S.W. distant six miles. The latitude I observed was 38&deg; 46'
S. longitude by my account 77&deg; 18' E. of Greenwich; variation
per the sun's amplitude at setting 22&deg; 30' W. Soon after
leaving the Island we passed a piece of board like a boat's
thwart with some rope round it.</p>
<p>On the 3d, we passed much sea weed, and saw some whales.
Latitude by observation at noon 38&deg; 9' S. longitude by
account 80&deg; 24' E.</p>
<p>The following day we saw many whales of the kind called the
Right Whale: these do not yield spermaceti. One of my crew had
been two voyages in the whale fishery, and pointed out the
different species when they appeared, and by the blow at a great
distance.</p>
<p>Nothing particular occurred till the 9th, when whales of the
spermaceti kind were very numerous round us, and birds of the
pintadoe, pettrel and albatross species. At noon our latitude by
observation was 38&deg; 6' S. longitude by account 100&deg; 13'
E. The weather in general was very variable from wet to dry,
accompanied with strong winds, which shifted from S.W. and S.S.W.
to N.W. and N. We had, however, more northerly wind than
southerly, and which brought with it in general a great deal of
rain. The northerly winds in this hemisphere coming from the Line
towards the Pole bring with them nearly the same weather in
general when they blow strong, as southerly winds do on the
British coast.</p>
<p>We had several showers of hail with the wind at S.W. on the
11th; and on the 13th, I ordered the bread-room to be examined,
when a leak was discovered from two iron knees, and another from
a but end, which I suppose had been neglected to be caulked. Four
bags of bread, containing 100 weight each, and part of some
others, were entirely damaged. This was the second time I had
been so tricked. Bread put up in bags is much better than loose;
for when it meets with an accident in the bread-room in the
latter way, it is very difficult to separate the good from the
bad. Apprehensive of leaks, I had put a few bags into the hold
prior to leaving the Cape, all of which were in good order. The
leaks we soon stopped. We now began to decrease our westerly
variation fast. On the 15th, by the sun's azimuth at setting, we
found 12&deg; W. variation; and on the 16th, it being calm, we
got a boat out and tried if there was any current, but none could
be perceived. At noon, by observation, our latitude was 38&deg;
10' S. longitude, by account, 119&deg; 14' E. The weather was now
fine: we saw several different species of whales, with two
threshers at work on one of them. This fish it is said kills the
whale.</p>
<p>On the 20th, by lunar observation, we found the longitude to
be 125&deg; 14' E. latitude at noon 38&deg; 18' S. Many porpoises
about us, two of which we killed, affording a fresh meal to the
crew. I still kept up the custom of airing the bedding, and
washing between decks, which kept my men active and healthy.</p>
<p>By my account on the 23d, we were in longitude 130&deg; E.
latitude 38&deg; 31' S. As we had now crossed Captain Vancouver's
Track, which is the farthest eastward of any laid down in this
parallel of latitude, it behoved us to keep a strict and
attentive look-out for land both by night and day. I therefore
admonished my small crew to watch carefully every appearance of
that nature, promising every encouragement to those that were
diligent, and pointing out to those inclined to be otherwise the
dangers we were liable to encounter through neglect, with the
disgrace and punishment which assuredly must fall to them. I had
the satisfaction to find that they punctually executed all my
orders, and I never had occasion to find fault with any one of
them, during the time I had the honour to command the Lady
Nelson.</p>
<p>On the 24th we bent both our cables, and unstowed the anchors.
We kept a strict look-out from the mast-head for land, day and
night.</p>
<p>We observed the variation by the sun's azimuth at setting on
the 26th, to be 4&deg; 55' W. At noon the latitude was 38&deg;
13' S. longitude by account 135&deg; 14' E. The following day the
variation was 2&deg; 30' W. latitude 38&deg; 15' S. We had but
few birds about us. The weather dark and hazy, but generally the
nights were clear with heavy dews falling, which I attributed to
our proximity to the land.</p>
<p>On the 29th, it was perfectly calm without a ripple. I tried
if there was a current, but only found a small drift to the
eastward, but so small as not to deserve any rate, and could just
be observed by the line when immersed several fathoms beneath the
surface, the other bodies taking their drift in that direction.
In the night we had a breeze from the E. and towards noon it
freshened into a brisk gale, which lasted till the 30th, with
uncommon smooth water for the force of wind, and the length of
time it had blown. The heavy dews at night continued.</p>
<p>On the 1st of December we passed a large spermaceti whale, and
at three P.M. we got so close to a seal as nearly to have run a
boarding pike into it, there being little wind. At five P.M. we
passed another, which followed us for some time, looking up at
us, and shaking his head as he leaped from the sea In the middle
watch; that is to say, between twelve and four in the morning, we
heard and saw several seals. The wind was from the E.N.E. to N.E.
by E. moderate with heavy dews.</p>
<p>At noon on the 2d, we observed the latitude to be 38&deg; 19'
S. longitude by account 139&deg; 44' E. We had light winds
inclining to calm. We had lost all the birds that generally
followed us. The clouds hung heavy to the eastward, and about the
horizon had much the appearance of land. In the evening one of
those long flies, known by the name of horse-stingers, came on
board and lighted on the main-sail, where it continued for some
time. This was a stronger proof of land being near us than any we
had yet seen, as this insect could not exist for any length of
time at sea. Though no land was to be seen I redoubled my
watchfulness. In the evening it came on to blow with much sea
during the night, which obliged us to keep very snug sail, in
order to be enabled to haul, if necessary, close to the wind
without losing time. It continued to blow with heavy squalls and
rain until four in the morning of the 3d, when we had day-light;
after which I made all the sail I could. At eight A.M. I saw the
land from the N. training as far to the E. as E.N.E. The part
that was right ahead appearing like unconnected islands, being
four in number, distant six or seven leagues. At noon I observed,
being in with the land, our latitude to be 38&deg; 10' S.
longitude by account 142&deg; 30' E. which, according the best of
my judgment, after looking over my Reckoning, I allowed the
western point of land to lay in 142&deg; E. From the distance I
was from the shore, and observing in 38&deg; 10', I make Cape
Banks to lie in 38&deg; 4' S.</p>
<p>It will be proper to give in this place the following copy of
the Journal which I gave Governor King, being a narrative of what
happened from the day I saw the land till I came to Wilson's
Promontory; to which I shall add some marginal notes made by the
Governor himself.</p>
<p>I beg however previously to observe, that I have strong
suspicions of land lying to the E. of New Holland from the number
of seals and the fly which came on board, as already mentioned. I
remark this, as from the run I made after until I made the land
was 126 miles by the log: it is true we had for some days
easterly winds which might have blown the insect off, but the
distance is so great that I doubt it much.</p>

<a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a><i>Remarks made on board the Lady
Nelson, coming in with the Land of New Holland.</i></h4>
<br>
<p>"December 3d, at day-light made all possible sail, judging
myself to be in the latitude of 38&deg; S.* At eight A.M. saw the
land from N. to E. N.E. the part that was right ahead appearing
like unconnected islands, being four in number, which, on our
nearer approach turned out to be two Capes and two high mountains
a considerable way in shore. One of them was very like the Table
Hill at the Cape of Good Hope, the other stands farther in the
country. Both are covered with large trees, as is also the land
which is low and flat, as far as the eye can reach. I named the
first of these mountains after Captain Schank, and the other
Gambier's Mountain. The first Cape I called Northumberland, after
his Grace the Duke of Northumberland, and another smaller but
very conspicuous jut of the land, which we plainly saw when
abreast of Cape Northumberland, I named Cape Banks. When the
former Cape bears N.W. by W. distant eight or nine miles,
Schank's Mountain bearing N. and Gambier's N. by E.; from the
vessel Schank's Mountain loses its table form and appears like a
saddle. There does not appear to be an harbour here, but vessels
may find shelter under Cape Northumberland from N. and N.N.W.
winds, as also between Cape Banks and it from the E. winds. The
shore is in general a flat sandy beach, the sea at present making
no breach upon it.</p>

<br>
<p>"4th. As we stood along the shore steering E. saw the land, as
far as we could see, bearing S.E. hauled close up for it. This
forming a conspicuous Cape I named it Bridgewater, in honour of
the Duke of that title. At seven, little wind and heavy sea. The
shore is a sandy beach, from where we made the land to this Cape,
and flat land covered with bushes, and large woods inland.
Finding we could not weather Cape Bridgewater, tacked
occasionally, and got four oars on the lee side, which were
employed all night. Baffling light winds from S.S.W. to S.E. with
a heavy swell. At day-break in the morning we weathered the Cape
six or seven miles, when another Cape appeared bearing E. by N.
about fifteen or sixteen miles distant; forming with Cape
Bridgewater a very deep bay, and to appearance had shelter for
anchorage, though much heavy swell. The land appeared beautiful,
rising gradually, and covered with wood. Being anxious to examine
whether it was safe to venture in or not, and apprehensive we
could not clear the shore, I ordered a boat out, and took two
hands with me armed. At this time there was but little wind, but
much sea and gloomy weather. After getting in shore about five
miles, we found there was not any shelter from S. winds, the
water very deep, and apparently the same all the way in. The
vessel had now hove to with a fresh wind at W.S.W. and being very
likely to blow with rain, we put back. The wind, however, did not
stand. While near shore we saw plainly several fires. The sea
being still very heavy and no wind, we got the launch ahead to
tow. At noon it was a matter of great doubt, whether we should
not be forced to anchor, the bay being very deep, we could hardly
clear it with a steady breeze. Our latitude was 38&deg; 21' S.
Cape Bridgewater then bearing N.W. by W. twelve or thirteen
miles. I called the other Cape Nelson after the vessel. At one, a
light breeze sprung up, which with the boat ahead got us clear of
the shore.</p>
<p>"5th. P.M. light airs, and a very heavy rolling swell setting
in upon the shore. Saw several fires. Being rather too far into
the Bay, which is deep, I was for some time very doubtful whether
we should not be obliged to trust to our anchors. A light breeze
springing up, and the boat being ahead towing we got our head to
the S. The West Cape I called Bridgewater, as already mentioned,
and that to the East, Nelson. This is a very deep Bay, and with
S. winds ought carefully to be avoided. Cape Nelson bears from
Cape Bridgewater E.N.E. fifteen or sixteen miles. The country is
beautiful, apparently a good soil, plenty of grass and fine
woods. Towards evening saw many fires a little way inland. Many
seals and porpoises about to-day. At six in the evening we had a
moderate breeze from S.S.E. Cape Bridgewater bearing N. by E.
four leagues, and Cape Nelson E.N.E. distant six leagues. Got in
the boats, tacked occasionally during the night, working to
windward. At five A.M. saw another Cape not unlike the Dedman in
the English Channel; it runs a considerable way into the sea.
When to the W. it appears like a long barn, arched on the top,
with a high bluff, and next the sea resembling the gable-end of a
house. I named this land Sir William Grant's Cape. Off this Cape
are two small islands, the largest appears like two, having two
hummocks joined together by a neck of low land, which is not seen
till pretty close. On approaching, the smaller island is seen a
little nearer the shore. These I called Lawrence's Islands, after
Captain Lawrence, one of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House.
As they will be an excellent mark for making this part, and save
much trouble to those who have not an opportunity to keep far
enough to the N. to make Cape Northumberland, and being very
remarkable, navigators will know where they are as they draw
abreast of them. The largest being to the S. with its two
hummocks, its outer end from the shore appears like a square-topt
tower very high with a white spot in the middle of it, which I
suppose proceeds from birds. The other end is also very high.
This island appears exactly, as here described, when it bears N.
or N. by W. &frac12;W. when there is an offing of ten or twelve
miles from it. Lawrence's Islands bear from Cape Sir William
Grant S.E. or S.E. by S. twelves miles distant, and there appears
no danger between them and the shore. The Cape now loses its long
form as the vessel gets to the E. and its particular shape which
was discernible when to the W. changes to a high bluff point,
steep and inaccessible. The land round it is moderately high with
much wood. Many fires were seen about this Cape. The land from it
runs to the N. as far as the eye can reach or discern from the
mast-head. I wished much for the wind from the N. that I might
explore the land, as I think there must be harbours in it, but
having it light from the S.S.E. varying every quarter of an hour
to E.S.E. I could not throw away time in atempting it. The bottom
of the Bay is hardly discernible from the masthead.</p>
<p>"6th, P.M. light breezes and cloudy weather; tacked
occasionally keeping the shore on board. At three, made a
considerable large island, high and inaccessible on all sides. It
was covered with grass but no trees. This island bears about
E.S.E. from Cape Sir William Grant. By a good observation at noon
following, I made its latitude to be 38&deg; 29' S. longitude by
my account, reckoning from Cape Northumberland, (which I suppose
is in 142&deg; E. of Greenwich) I make 144&deg; 40' E. it bearing
from me when the observation was taken N.N.W. distant eighteen or
twenty miles, my latitude observed being 38' 45' S. I named this
island Lady Julia's, in honour of Lady Julia Percy. Observed we
ran faster along the land than our distance by log gave us, owing
probably to a considerable drift to the E.</p>
<p>"7th. By the mean of four azimuths and amplitudes the
variation is 2&deg; 50' E. We had now fresh breezes and cloudy
weather; we ran under a commanding sail during the night, the
wind at S.S.W. and S.W. At day-light we saw the land making a
Cape ahead, hauled up to clear it. This Cape is due E.S.E. with a
moderate offing from Cape Sir William Grant, distant by log
seventy miles. It is the E. promontory of this deep and extensive
Bay, I named it Cape Albany Otway, in honour of William Albany
Otway, Esq. Captain in the Royal Navy, and one of the
Commissioners of the Transport Board. Another very high and
considerable Cape bearing from the last E.S.E. I called Patton's
Cape. It is distant from Cape Albany Otway eight or ten miles,
E.N.E. half E. I also distinguished the Bay by the name of
Portland Bay, in honour of his Grace the Duke of Portland. The
land is here truly picturesque and beautiful, resembling very
much that about Mount Edgecumbe near Plymouth, which faces the
Sound. It abounds in wood, very thick groves, and large trees.*
It is moderately high but not mountainous. We did not see any
fires on it, probably from the shore being inaccessible, and much
surf breaking on it. From Cape Albany Otway E.N.E. ten or twelve
miles is another Point of Land, which appears as a vessel rounds
the former Cape to the E. It is rather high land, with a clump of
trees, as if regularly planted on its brow. Thinking from its
projection we could find anchorage under it, and as we had a
commanding breeze at W.S.W. I bore in pretty close; but as we
approached I found several heavy breakers at least six miles from
the shore, but not a rock to be seen: I therefore hauled off, and
named the point of land, Cape Danger. In getting to the E. I
could not find any shelter, nor any place where there was a
likelihood of anchoring; but from the number of little juts, and
low points of land further to the N. and E. I was determined to
try if any such place could be got. I never saw a finer country,
the valleys appeared to have plenty of fresh water meandring
through them. At eleven A.M. I ordered the boats out, manned and
armed, and went in search of a place to land on or anchor in. We
got within a cable's length and an half of the shore, but finding
the surf breaking heavy, I deemed it not prudent to attempt
landing. The shore was a sandy beach, with small rocks
interspersed here and there. In trying for soundings, with a hand
lead line, none could be found; so that I really think the beach
is steep also. I was very much disappointed in being so near, and
obliged to return on board without setting foot on this beautiful
spot. It resembles the Isle of Wight as near as possible in its
appearance from the water; I therefore called this part of the
coast, (which falls into the bottom of the small Bay from Cape
Danger to the very low land, which is distinguished by a long
ridge of breakers off it,) Wight's Land, in honour of Captain
Wight of the Royal Navy, son-in-law to Commissioner Schank. On
our return we got the boats in, and by observation I found the
latitude to be 38&deg; 52' S. about eight miles from the shore;
Cape Danger bearing N.N.W. distant ten or twelve miles.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Black, in the Harbinger, was close in with
the land, and describes it nearly the same as Lieutenant Grant.
P.G.K.]</p>
<p>"8th. At half past twelve P.M. bore away from the land, the
wind being W.S.W. At one, having got sufficient offing, made sail
to the eastward. At eight P.M. Cape Albany Otway bearing W.
eighteen or twenty miles, we made a very high and lofty Cape
covered with trees to the water's edge, as is all the country
round it. From this Cape the land breaks short round to the
northward, when I lost it. We had now a fair wind, and might have
done a great deal during the night, but I had my doubts whether
this land, which fell off to the northward, should not have been
followed and kept on board; as from a small chart given to me by
Sir Joseph Banks, I found that as far as the coast had been
surveyed, the land trained off to the northward, in the same form
nearly as it did here from Cape Patton, with this difference,
that the Cape I allude to on the chart had several islands lying
off from it. Neither did the latitude exactly correspond; and the
land which it laid down, running to the northward, was low and
bushy, whereas that which I saw was high with large forests of
trees, and no islands near it. I therefore chose the middle road;
made snug sail; and ran sixty miles E. judging, if it was a Bay,
I should see the eastern extremity of it. At day-light, however,
we could see nothing anywhere from the mast-head but the looming
of the land we had left. We now bore up and ran N. by W. and at
six, we saw the land again ahead, forming a very deep Bay, which
I could not see the bottom of from the mast-head.* At eight, the
land was observed bearing from us E.S.E. extending farther to the
southward than I could see. Being now certain of our route, I
hauled up E.S.E. and named this Bay after Governor King. It is
one of the longest we have yet met with; Cape Albany Otway forms
the westernmost, and the South Cape the easternmost head-lands,
the distance of about 120 miles due E.S.E. At noon it fell calm,
the sun very sultry. Observed in 39&deg; 30' S. mercury at
75&deg; and 74&deg;.</p>
<p class="foot">[* If such a deep Bay as this actually exists, it
favours the idea of New South Wales being insulated by a
Mediterranean Sea. However, this the Lady Nelson must determine
in the Voyage she is now gone upon. P.G.K.]</p>
<p>"9th, P.M. light airs inclining to calm. At four P.M. we saw
several islands bearing E.S.E. the main land seemed to have an
opening in it to the northward of them, which we stood in for,
but I found it was another Bay with low land. This Bay runs in
nearly E. I named the northernmost Cape after my friend John
Liptrap, Esq. of London. The main land now shewed extending a
considerable way to the southward, with several islands off the
Cape. Judging this was the point of land we looked for from the
colour of the water, we sounded, and had fifty fathoms with fine
sand, South Cape distant nine or ten miles. The land abreast of
the ship appearing to be at no great distance off, and it being
quite calm, I got the boats out, and sent the launch ahead to
tow. Thinking I should have the pleasure of setting my foot on
this fine country, I set off in the gig with two hands, ordering
the vessel to tow in after me, and should a breeze spring up to
get the launch in, and stand after me in for the Bay. At noon I
sounded again in forty-one fathoms, sand and shells. The weather
still calm and hazy. We pulled in shore for some islands lying
off from the main, at the western side of the South Cape, making
for the largest of them which appeared to be the most fertile, on
it I meant to have sowed some seeds, which I took with me, should
I be able to land. The distance I could not have believed was so
great as it proved to be; at least twelve miles from where we
quitted the vessel, which we lost sight of before getting near
the shore. Although we had not a breath of wind we found it
impossible to land on this side, the shore being very steep, and
a heavy surf running on it. Therefore as the ship was not in
sight, and as it was two P.M. I judged it prudent to get back as
soon as possible, which we effected by four o'clock. We had now a
light breeze from the E. and the weather intolerably close and
sultry, the mercury standing at 72&deg; and 3'. Got the boats in,
and made sail to the southward. At seven, the wind at E.
freshened into a strong gale, and at eight it blew a thunderstorm
with much heavy forked lightning; but it being a weather shore,
we kept close at the wind, in order to get to the southward of
the islands lying off this Cape, when on a sudden it shifted due
W. very dark, with heavy rain and lightning, which continued all
night, the wind abating about twelve o'clock. In the morning it
was calm with hot sultry weather. At noon I had a good
observation in latitude 39&deg; 30' S. The South part of the
main, or South Cape bearing N.W. by N. distant twenty miles, and
the longitude 147&deg; 18' from a good lunar observation taken on
the 8th instant. All round the Western side, and even thus far
South of the Cape, there are soundings of fifty fathoms,
forty-five and forty; white sand and shells. I called that space
between Cape Liptrap and the South Cape, King George's Sound; and
I have no doubt but there is good anchorage in the bite to the
northward of the South Cape, on the westward side of which Cape
Liptrap makes the northern head. The land here is high, and the
mountains covered with wood. Cape Liptrap is low and flat, as is
the land in this Bite, where I suppose there is shelter. There is
an island bearing from the western part of the South Cape, South,
a little easterly, about twelve miles from the shore. It is round
and inaccessible on all sides. The abovementioned island I called
Rodondo, from its resemblance to that rock, well known to all
seamen in the West Indies. A set of breakers to the southward and
eastward of that rock, on which, though calm, the sea breaks
much, bearing now from us N.N.W. &amp; W. distant six miles. To
the eastward there are five islands, the largest of which from
its resemblance to the Lion's Mount at the Cape of Good Hope, I
called Sir Roger Curtis's Island, who then commanded on that
station. It is high and inaccessible on the N.W. side, and
covered with small bushes on the top. The body of this island
bearing from us E.S.E. distant seven or eight miles. Two other
islands like hay-cocks, only higher and more perpendicular,
standing a considerable distance from each other, the largest of
which bore from us S.E. &frac14;S. distant sixteen or seventeen
miles, and the other S.E. by E. about ten miles. The latter is
nearly shut in with the S.E. end of Sir Roger Curtis's Island.
The fourth is a rock, standing a considerable height out of the
water, nearly in a position between the two hay-cocks, or rather
sugar-loaf-like islands, bearing S.E. &frac14;S. The fifth is a
high perpendicular barren cliff, which as we got almost abreast
formed like two islands joined together at the bottom, rising to
a sharp edge, ragged at the top, and resembling a large tower or
castle. This island I named the Devil's Tower. It bore from us E.
by N. about ten or twelve miles. An island in with the shore was
observed, it bore W.N.W. distant ten miles; I called it Moncur's
Island, in compliment to Captain Moncur of the Royal Navy: and
another was visible bearing N. by E. sixteen or seventeen miles.
Land, apparently an island, to the southward and eastward we can
just see from the mast-head. It may be necessary to observe, that
these bearings were taken at noon, and as it was then a stark
calm the vessel was nearly stationary. By a good observation the
latitude was 39&deg; 30', longitude 147&deg; 18' E. calculated
from lunar observation two days before; but I take it to be
correctly 147&deg; E. from my making the Ramhead, according to
the best charts; therefore the bearings are laid down in my chart
from 147&deg; E.</p>
<p>"We now having made the Cape, which I presume is that laid
down in the chart I got from Sir Joseph Banks, seen by Mr.
Flinders,* any farther observation is unnecessary, as I find the
land training along to the northward exactly as it is described
by him.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Bass, (from whose authority Lieutenant
Flinders has ascertained the position of Wilson's Promontory)
places it in 38&deg; 56' S. Lieutenant Grant in 39&deg; 17'**;
and Mr. Black in 39&deg; 8'. As Mr. Bass's latitude is by
computation from the Whale Boat, which might be liable to error,
I think a preference may be given to Lieutenant Grant's position,
as he had the advantage of a good Sextant. P.G.K.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** The latitude of Wilson's Promontory I
afterwards determined to be 39&deg; 2' S. but this will appear
hereafter in its proper place.]</p>
<p>"Wilson's Promontory was so named by Mr. George Bass, of his
Majesty's ship Reliance, who was the first navigator that
ascertained the real existence of a Strait separating Van
Dieman's Land from New Holland, in his voyage in a whale boat,
from Sydney to Western Port. Having made it, I set of in one of
my boats early in the morning of the 10th, to endeavour to land
on one of the islands lying off it; but, after a long pull, found
the one I judged from its sloping aspect to be the easiest for
that purpose, a solid rock for a considerable height, with surf
too powerful for such a small boat as mine. After several
fruitless attempts I was obliged to abandon the idea, contenting
myself with taking a view of it, and those contiguous. One of
them was an immense rock; on one side perfectly round, with a
large hole in the other, in the form of an arch, with a
breastwork rising high enough above the level of the sea to
preclude the water from getting into it: the hollow appeared as
if scooped out by Art instead of Nature. I gave it the name of
the Hole in the Wall; and to the range of islands stretching
along the main, Glennie's Islands, after Mr. George Glennie, a
particular friend of Captain Schank's, to whom I was under
personal obligations. On the summit of all these islands there
was a thick brush growing, whereas the land of Cape Liptrap,
already mentioned, exhibited a fine level country. The day being
far spent in this survey, I deemed it best to get on board, as
the vessel was but just visible with her head towards us, and
becalmed. Round the Promontory we found from forty-five to fifty
fathoms water, sand and shells. Towards night we had the wind
E.S.E. with heavy clouds which brought on, with a sudden shift to
N.E. and N.E. by N. a heavy squall, accompanied with much
lightning and heavy rain. It cleared up at twelve; and in the
morning we had calm weather.</p>
<p>"On the 12th we had fresh gales and cloudy weather; the shore
we were running along was low and covered with thick brush,
training in a N.E. direction, which Messieurs Flinders and Bass
have given very accurate descriptions of. The weather being very
rainy with fresh gales, I was prevented from ascertaining our
latitude by observation."</p>
<p>The heavy gales with constant rain prevailed on the following
day, which continued until noon of the 14th, when it moderated,
and became fair at times. This rain had continued to pour in
torrents the heaviest and longest I ever experienced, being
nearly forty-eight hours. At noon I had a sight of the sun, and
found by observation our latitude to be 37&deg; 13' S. longitude
151&deg; 40' E. I now found we had got to the E. of Port Jackson,
as Sydney Town, or rather Bradley's Point, where the Fort stands,
from several sets of lunar observations is found to lie in
longitude E. of Greenwich 151&deg; 18' 8"; latitude 33&deg; 51'
28" S. The weather continued thick with S. and S.W. gales, which
made me, owing to these, delay some time for fear of overshooting
Port Jackson, as these S.W. winds sometimes blow long and heavy;
besides, objects on shore are not easily distinguished except
when close. Governor King had taken the precaution of leaving a
letter for me at the Cape, describing the particular marks for
knowing the entrance of the Port, which no doubt saved us much
trouble. They consisted of a pedestal and flag-staff erected on
the S. head or left-hand side of the entrance, and when vessels
are seen the flag is hoisted. This land being high, as is also
the N. head, may be seen at a considerable distance in a clear
day. Botany Bay being the first opening that attracted our
notice, we made the best of our way in the afternoon of the 16th
to the northward, and soon after saw the flag-staff as described
by Governor King. At six in the evening we entered between the
Heads of Port Jackson. From the violence of the weather we found
much swell in going in, but were soon in smooth water and an
excellent harbour, perhaps, one of the finest in the known world.
As the wind was from the S. and contrary to getting into Sydney
Cove, we were obliged to beat up to it, and at half past seven in
the evening we let go our anchors in eight fathoms water, after a
voyage of seventy-one days from the Cape of Good Hope; and with
the satisfaction of being the first vessel that ever pursued the
same track across that vast ocean; as we have no traces of its
being done, particularly from the Island of Amsterdam, viz.
between the degrees of latitude 38&deg; and 39&deg;&frac12;S.
until the Lady Nelson made the Coast of New Holland in latitude
38&deg;, and steering to the eastward along a tract of land
nearly four degrees to the westward of any seen by Messieurs Bass
and Flinders; the former being the only one who had visited any
part of that coast to the westward of Wilson's Promontory; Mr.
Flinders' survey being more particularly attached to the S. side
of those Straits (now deservedly named Bass's Straits,) along Van
Dieman's Land. I now reflect with much pleasure that I had
conducted my little vessel safely out, which many judged
impracticable, both in England and at the Cape, without any
damage either in rigging, masts, or spars; besides fulfilling the
Duke of Portland's orders to search for a passage through these
Straits. Many able officers and seamen at the Cape thought it too
hazardous an attempt in running down the land in such high
southern latitude, where in general heavy S.W. winds are
constantly blowing, and where I might, from the long range of
coast, not be able to extricate myself. The old beaten track to
Port Jackson from the westward to the eastward was strongly
recommended; as by that I should not be so liable to be baffled
with westerly winds in any discoveries I should afterwards go
upon in the Straits. The peevish and ignorant railed altogether
at the attempt in such a vessel to make the voyage to New South
Wales; and scrupled not to say we should have a long drift of it,
as it was impossible to run or scud, the sea being too heavy for
such a purpose. Many of these men had been to New South Wales,
and ought therefore to have known better, more particularly, as
in the passage to the Cape of Good Hope from England, there is in
winter, and in the neighbourhood of the Cape, as heavy weather
and sea as in any part of the known world. Having however
conquered all these difficulties of imagination, I felt thankful
to God for the great success we had met with, and the protection
he had shewn us throughout the whole voyage. Governor King had
been expecting us for some time, as I had written to him from the
Cape of Good Hope by the Porpoise, which left that place for New
South Wales before us.</p>

<h3>[CHAPTER IV.<br>
<br>
<a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a><i>Occurrences and Transactions in
New Holland and New South Wales</i>]</h3>
<br>
<p>To the stranger the harbour of Port Jackson appears pleasing
and picturesque, as he advances up it to the town. A small island
with a house on it, named Garden Island, (which afterwards became
my residence) enriches the view. On the main is Walamoola, so
named by the natives, a rural situation, where Mr. Palmer, the
Commissary, has built a large and commodious house, and bestowed
much labour in cultivating the land round it. Such a house in so
young a Colony excites a degree of surprise in a new comer. The
town of Sydney is much larger and more respectable that can well
be imagined considering the time it has been built. The streets
are by order made broad and strait; each house is generally
separated from the adjoining ones, an excellent regulation in
case of fire; few or any are without gardens; and many of the
houses are large and commodious. When I landed I found that the
heavy rain, which I had experienced some days before, had been
equally felt here. The Hawkesbury River had been swelled almost
instaneously to the great annoyance of the Settlers on its banks.
Various were the causes assigned for the rapid increase of water;
some supposed it owing to the bursting of a cloud in the
mountains, which hurried the water down the level country; others
to the overflowing of a lake or morass, which augmented the
currents of all the neighbouring rivers, for that at Paramatta
had also overflown its banks to a very great height, as I
afterwards was shewn by Dr. Thompson, now the Resident Colonial
Surgeon, as almost to be supposed impossible.</p>
<p>Paramatta, which is the name given by the natives to what was
at first called Rose Hill, is a very pretty village; and from
what I could judge, much preferable in point of soil to Sydney.
The Government House stands at the end of a street, nearly an
English mile in length, making a very fine appearance. There is
an excellent garden adjoining to it, well stocked with vegetables
and fruit trees; amongst which the peach and fig were large and
fine. All the houses had gardens to them well cultivated, the
soil of which is good. The Rev. Mr. Marsden, Clergyman to the
Colony, has his residence here. That Gentleman while I was here
was indefatigable in superintending the building of a small neat
church. The first that was erected was at Sydney, but it was
unfortunately burnt down; Divine Service was therefore obliged to
be performed in a Store cleared out for the purpose in that town;
but as from its excellent harbour and increase of houses and
population it will always remain the Seat of Government, the
church will, no doubt, be rebuilt in a durable manner.</p>
<p>The houses of the Convicts in general are constructed with
wattles, covered with shingles, and plaistered inside and out
with clay, over which they put a coat of lime, burnt from shells,
giving them a very neat and clean appearance. It is seldom that
two families inhabit one dwelling, therefore every man becomes
absolutely master of his house, and when he can afford it, he
weather-boards and paints it. In the smallest dwelling I entered,
I never saw less than two apartments. Many houses are constructed
with bricks, and as well finished to the eye as European
buildings; in such the apartments are numerous. In short, from
the very comfortable manner these people are lodged, (much more
so than the poorer sort in England,) I cannot avoid remarking,
that it no doubt has a tendency to promote the great degree of
health and flow of spirits I observed them possessed of, and
readily accounts for many wishing to remain, whose years of
banishment have expired.</p>
<p>The stores for the Colony which I bad brought out being all
landed, and delivered into his Majesty's Store-house at Sydney;
and the Seamen having fulfilled their agreement were paid their
wages, and discharged, by order of the Governor, on the 31st of
December, in presence of the two Civil Magistrates, William
Balmain, and John Harris, Esquires. It will not be wondered if I
felt a regret at parting with the companions of my voyage, more
particularly those, who from fidelity and attention had
recommended themselves to my notice. I had now performed my duty
to the Honourable Commissioners of the Transport Board, who
allowed me and my crew a very handsome compensation, which the
latter received, but I did not, as Governor King had no orders
respecting it being given to me: I was therefore left without
cash in a place where it was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty had been pleased,
previous to my sailing from England, to appoint me Lieutenant to
his Majesty's armed vessel Supply at New South Wales. On my
arrival, I found her laid up as a hulk, and unfit for sea. I was
therefore, to make use of a sailor's phrase, completely adrift.
The thirst for discovery, which I was always attached to, and a
request of Governor King's to remain in the Lady Nelson, induced
me to accept of lower pay than I was entitled to as a Lieutenant
in the Royal Navy; more particularly so, as there was not a
person in the Colony to be found sufficiently acquainted with a
vessel of this construction. Besides, I did not wish the service
to suffer from delay; and that no blame should be attached to me,
I agreed to it with less emoluments, according to situation, than
the other officers and seamen, they being paid according to the
regular naval establishment. I bad hopes that any difference or
loss I might sustain, would perhaps be made up to me on
representation to the Right Honourable His Majesty's Secretary of
State for the Colonies, which, I am happy to say, has since been
done. One circumstance I did not much like, which was the
detaching myself from the naval service, which put promotion in
that line, (though employed in the service of my country,) out of
my reach; but Governor King had promised that he would take care
it should not interfere with that; and I am sensible of his
having taken some steps to that effect.</p>
<p>Matters being thus arranged, I received the Governor's
appointment to the command of the Lady Nelson on the 1st of
January 1801. Such convicts as were free, or others who applied
and were deemed worthy, were entered on board of the vessel; and
for encouragement were conditionally emancipated. Two only of my
old crew chose to enter; the rest refusing on account of the
wages, which were small in comparison to what the merchant
vessels, then in the harbour, and in want of hands, gave. Amongst
the convicts that entered, I found some of the most dissatisfied,
idle and worthless characters, who came on purpose to avoid
Government labour, or in hopes of getting off from it. Many
complaints were made by these wretches to the Governor who failed
not to remove them, but generally to my loss, as I was repeatedly
robbed by them. I endeavoured by every means in my power to
admonish and encourage them to do well, but finding it
impossible, I was obliged to punish a fellow for theft by giving
him twelve lashes. So great was the force of bad example, that
one of the young men who came out with me was guilty of the same
crime, and was also punished. I am happy to think this was
attended with the best effect, though some insinuations were
preferred against me, by designing people, for what was
indispensably necessary, in keeping up a proper authority on
board, however reluctant it was to my feelings. To blame me, or
to attempt to lessen my consequence in the eyes of the crew on
that occasion, by slander, reverts upon those who were the cause,
and such as listened to it: and this will appear the more
extraordinary, as they well knew the vessel was under martial
law, the same as any other in his Majesty's service. To all who
are acquainted with the spirit of discipline and subordination,
it is needless to say, that I felt the baneful influence, more or
less, during the time I commanded the Lady Nelson. The having the
vessel manned at all by convicts I could not approve of; but it
could not be well remedied without incurring a very great expence
to Government.</p>
<p>On the 11th of January arrived the Harbinger brig, Mr. Black,
commander, from the Cape of Good Hope. I have before mentioned
this Gentleman's name, having fallen in with a prize of his at
sea, previous to my arrival at the Cape. This Gentleman followed
me through the Streights, and of that part of the land he saw, he
gave nearly the same description as I had given to Governor King.
He did not fall in with the land so far to the westward as I did,
but made it about Cape Albany Otway and Cape Patton.* He also saw
an island in the Straits to the southward of this land of
considerable magnitude, which he named King's Island after
Governor King.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Chart.]</p>
<p>On the 7th of February arrived the brig Margaret from England,
commanded by Mr. Byers. He also made his passage through the
Straits, and fell in with the land a little to the eastward of
where I did, making the latitude nearly in 38&deg; 20', about
Cape Bridgewater. This Gentleman also agreed with me very nearly
in the figure of the Coast and description of it. He did not keep
the coast all the way through on board, owing to the wind he was
obliged to run to the southward. However, so far as both these
Gentlemen had seen of the coast we agreed, only differing in
position; though not more than what might be expected after long
passages, from different reckonings or judgments. It had,
however, the good effect, that it realized the land I brought in,
beyond all manner of doubt, to the westward of Wilson's
Promontory, and Western Port, which was the farthest point to the
westward that Mr. Bass had proceeded to.&mdash; Some who
pretended to doubt my having seen the extent of coast which I
did, and who were constantly inveighing against my vessel, now
found themselves completely triumphed over, and saved me much
trouble on account of the character of my worthy friend and
patron, whom I vindicated. Conscious of the truth of my
statements, both respecting the vessel and the object of it, I at
last contented myself with being silent to the mean attempts of
the malevolent and ignorant.</p>
<p>Governor King having appointed Garden Island for the purpose
of raising vegetables for the crew of the Lady Nelson, I
accordingly took possession of it. There was the shell of a
tolerable house on it, which required much repair to make it
habitable. I sent Dr. Brandt, who had volunteered with me at the
Cape, with his dog and baboon to the island, as he had no
inclination to go again to sea, having been much incommoded with
sea sickness during the voyage hither. I therefore judged it
would be a good place for him to reside at in my absence, and
take charge of my property; a very necessary precaution against
nocturnal visitors, who laid hold on and carried off every thing
that was portable. As the poor Doctor was obliged to part with
every article of provisions I had given him to some of these
depredators, who paid him a visit, I applied to the Governor, who
very readily issued an order that no person should attempt to
land on the Island without his or my leave. This put a stop, in a
great measure, to such practices. There not being any fresh water
on it, I was obliged to lend the Doctor a small boat, which one
person could pull about with a pair of sculls, till I could
purchase one for the use of the Island; but, unfortunately the
Doctor lost this. One of the young men who came out with me, and
who had entered on board another vessel in the harbour, borrowed
it from him for the purpose of fishing, leaving the vessel's boat
that he came in with his companion till his return. Three days
elapsed, and not hearing any tidings of them, the Doctor became
very uneasy. I set on foot every enquiry, but without effect; and
what vexed me much, was, that the young man was one of those who
had run off with the same boat at Port Praya. I offered a reward
to any one who would give me information of the boat; and though
the weather was very bad, I was under the necessity of sending my
first-mate round to Hawkesbury River with another in search of
it. I also formed the resolution of walking to Pittwater, which
joins the Hawkesbury, and branches inland a considerable way,
affording many little Creeks and Coves, where the natives
assemble at times to fish.</p>
<p>On the 25th of February I set out, the weather thick and
cloudy, accompanied by a soldier of the New South Wales Corps,
one of my own people, a native and his wife, as guides. Ensign
Bareillier, of the same Corps, volunteered going in the boat with
the mate. The path I took was intricate, but very romantic. As it
rained hard towards evening, my guide halted near a wood, taking
us to a place where two old men were sitting by a fire, and which
had the appearance of several others having been there very
recently. This temporary habitation was formed by a rock
overhanging the place they were seated on, and called by them
<i>Gablegunnie</i>, being the term for the hut, or the House of
the Rock. The two men did not seem to receive us with any
particular marks either of friendship or indifference; and from
what I afterwards learned they were both doctors, which probably
induced my guide to visit them, as his back had been much hurt,
and he was troubled with a difficulty of breathing. They gave us
from a bag-net a few fish they had gathered off the rocks; but on
removing the skin, (which is used by them as bait in fishing,)
they smelt so offensive that we could not eat them. I gave them
some bread in return, and we parted well pleased with each other.
They told us that a little farther on there was a party of
natives employed in fishing, who had two huts built near a long
sandy beach. As the night was likely to be very dark with heavy
rain, I intended, if possible, to shelter ourselves with them.
Our guide was so ill, that he appeared incapable of going on with
us, and promised to get one of them to accompany us to Pittwater.
I could not help remarking the acuteness of sight which these
people possess even in the dark to a wonderful degree; as also of
hearing. As we approached the huts we found two canoes left on
the sand; and as we proceeded through the bushes, the woman with
us asked me, if I saw a black fellow, pointing farther among the
bushes. I stopped and looked, but could see no one, the night
being exceedingly dark. We were immediately challenged from the
bushes in the native language; the soldier with me answered; and
we were conducted by the stranger to the huts. He had been down
at the canoes for some fish, and on his return saw us; after
depositing them, he came to reconnoitre who we were, at which
time the woman observed him. He had told his comrades of seeing
us, and they took the precaution of hiding their fish, as they
always do in similar occasions to prevent their being discovered
by strangers. The natives are in general very much afraid of
walking alone in the dark, unless under the impulse of jealousy,
hunger or revenge. On such occasions they will in the night steal
on their countrymen whilst asleep, and with an instrument called
a dual, made of hard wood and gradually tapering to a point, pin
them to the ground, particularly when actuated by jealousy or
revenge.</p>
<p>I found the huts larger and better constructed than I had as
yet seen or heard of: they were built of timber procured from the
wreck of a small vessel, which lay stranded on the shore at no
great distance. In one but there were three men, four women and
two children; and in the other, which was very small, a a man and
his wife. The natives very kindly took from their hiding places
some large and excellent fish, such as snappers, and salmon, so
called in this country, I presume, from their scales. These they
laid whole on the fire, which was placed in the middle of the
hut. As soon as one side of the fish was done they placed it on
the other, opposite to where I sat, beginning to eat while that
was broiling, inviting me by signs to follow their example; which
I and my companions readily did, being both hungry and wet, it
having rained very hard, and we found ourselves very comfortable.
Situated as we were, I could not avoid remarking to myself how
easily nature was satisfied; the only thing I wanted being salt.
The curiosity of these poor people with respect to many things
about us was very great; particularly in observing a head raised
in silver on the butt-end of the pistol stuck in my waist-belt;
and also in the ticking-noise of my watch, which the women and
children wondered much at, mimicking its sound as they held it up
to their ears.</p>
<p>Having sent my guide and his wife with the seaman to the small
hut, I and the soldier lay down to sleep with our feet to the
fire. One of the women was very ill during the night, and groaned
much, being seized with spasms in her stomach, as I afterwards
understood. In the night-time the soldier was wakened by one of
the men, who requested he would go with him to fetch some water.
On the former (who understood the language) asking him why he
could not go alone, he was answered, "You know me <i>murrey
jarrin</i>, that is, <i>much afraid</i>. The soldier being
unwilling to stir, asked, "What he was afraid of? The native
said, "of the <i>Bogle</i>;" the term for the Evil Spirit, or
Devil; which shews that superstition is very predominant amongst
them. As I wished for some water, I desired the man to get up and
bring me some, which he did in a small vessel shaped like a
canoe, made of bark, the native accompanying him.</p>
<p>We got up before day-light, and having taken one of our
hospitable friends for a guide, who was both more robust, and
stronger than the natives are in general in this part of New
Holland, he armed himself with a spear, and moved onwards with us
till we came near to the banks of a stream, which the natives
call <i>Narrowbine</i>. It was but barely peep of day, and
objects were not easily distinguishable, yet the native informed
me he saw somebody on the opposite side. As we proceeded on we
soon perceived a person walking by the river side, but could not
ascertain whether he was a native or not. Our guide, however, on
enquiry said, that is, "no black fellow", and that he had a
musket with him. Some of the Convicts having about this time
absconded and taken with them the Norfolk sloop, with an
intention of leaving the country, were cast ashore, but a short
distance to the northward. They had been daring enough to attack
and seize a settler's boat going to the Coal River; and as many
of these people were still out, I made no doubt but he was one of
them. The stream from the rain which had fallen during the night,
and the tide of flood being in, as it was in the vicinity of the
sea, was become deeper and more rapid than common, and had
obstructed the fellow's progress. I called to him, and asked who
he was, and where he was going? He answered, that he had been
Kangarooing, had lost his way, and was almost starved. From the
latter circumstance I was certain he was one of the Convicts, and
therefore I desired him to stop, as I was going over, and would
shew him the best place to cross at, which he had enquired for.
While we were stripping, I desired the native, who was in a state
of nature, that, if he saw the fellow attempt to get way, he
would stop him, and should he offer any resistance, to spear him.
The river was so deep that it came up to his chin; and as he was
taller than any of us, we were under the necessity of leaving our
clothes behind, and making two trips, in order to keep our
fire-arms from the wet, which was not an easy matter, being
obliged to carry them over our heads. The bottom of the river was
very rugged with sharp-pointed rocks, which made us stumble and
cut our feet; however we got over. The poor creature gave himself
up to me without condition, confessing he was one of the party
who ran away with the Norfolk. At this moment he presented a most
pitiable sight, being literally almost starved, and had he got
across the Narrowbine, he never would have been able to reach
Sydney. As to the musket, instead of being of any service to him,
it was rather an incumbrance, as it was totally unfit for use.
His comrades and he had endured the greatest misery and distress
through hunger and fatigue. On being informed that some of them
were taken and executed, he burst into tears, and said he was
sure nothing could save him. He had a wound in his leg, which he
got from a species of scate called a Sting Ray. In attempting to
kill it in a shallow stream it had found its way into, it threw
the sting, (which in large ones is sometimes eight or nine inches
in length, indented like a saw,) through the calf of his leg. The
fatigue of walking, and the scratching of the bushes had inflamed
it to a great degree: his feet were also wounded and ulcerated
from rocks and stumps of trees. In short, he was so wretched and
helpless, that I directed my two companions to support him
between them to Pittwater, where my boat was to meet me. The
little bread I had remaining, bad as it was from the wet it had
met with, was devoured by him with avidity; and this, with a
little spirits I had left, recruited him He shewed me the place
where he had lain all night, on a few branches spread under a
tree, without fire, and exposed to the heavy rain. On being asked
where he had left his companions, he said, that himself and two
others of the party, had left the remainder near Port Stephens,
which is some considerable distance to the northward of the
Hawkesbury; that they had some intention of forming a settlement
there, until something should turn up favourable for them; that
they had planted a few pumpkin and melon-seeds, and some Indian
corn, which had come up, but was insufficient for the support of
seven or eight persons. The ring-leader, who was there, had
determined not to return. This man had been very ill with an
intermitting fever, which indeed had been experienced more or
less by all of them; and it was his intention, and that of two
others, who left the place, to return and give themselves up; but
one of them being very ill, he quitted him and his companion, who
chose to remain with the sick man, on the other side of
Pittwater. They had suffered much from hunger, living principally
on the cabbage-tree; and he affirmed, that when they fell in with
the natives, they behaved very ill to them; that indeed from some
they got a fish or two; but that others, instead of assisting
them, took away what rags of clothing they had left. This last
circumstance is, in my opinion, rather improbable, for unless it
be a blanket, I have never known any of the natives express even
a wish for any article of clothing. On being asked how he got
over Pittwater, he informed me that meeting with one of the
natives, then on the banks, whom he knew, he partly through that
acquaintance, and partly through the offer of a shirt, prevailed
with him to put him across in his canoe; but that he had much ado
afterwards to prevent some of them from spearing him, as they all
asked him for bread, which they supposed he must have. Whether
this was true or not with respect to his adventures, it is a fact
that all the natives about the Settlement, or at a distance, who
have tasted bread, are very fond of it, and always ask for it. No
doubt the general keen state of their appetites may be a powerful
incentive at the time they desire it; and it is not improbable
that some of those he met with, being hungry, and encouraged by
his helpless appearance, might endeavour to terrify him with the
spear. The gun he had in his hand, he believed, prevented them
from putting their threats in execution.</p>
<p>After experiencing much difficulty in getting this unfortunate
wretch along, we soon discovered our boat by the help of a
bugle-horn, two of which I had brought from England with me.
These instruments are of the utmost service to all who have to
travel through pathless woods, where the sight is intercepted, as
they can always be used when a musket cannot. If they are made of
different sizes, or of metal and horn, the sound will vary so
much as to make it easily known which party they belong to:
besides, ammunition will be saved by their use, which is often of
the utmost importance. If made of a large size they will serve to
carry water in occasionally; and this is often a very acceptable
service in woods at a distance from a river. In short, in all
business of discovery, these and a few watchmens' rattles, (some
of which I also had with me,) will be found very useful. I had
agreed to meet the boat at a certain part of Pittwater, but as
neither my mate nor I had ever seen it, and our guides being
little acquainted with the spot, I had recourse to the bugle. I
was answered from the boat with the same instrument about a mile
and an half distance from us. I hope this will fully illustrate
the superior usefulness of the bugle-horn in respect to the
musket (a signal which might have misled us as being used on
other occasions); besides which the former, not only from the
sound itself, but from the long continuance of it, has the best
chance of being heard. My officer had made very diligent search
for the boat taken from Garden Island, but without success. The
poor runaway Convict was put into the boat, and supplied with
food, which from the manner he began to devour it, I was obliged
to give him very sparingly. The boat party had suffered much from
the rain during the night, as well as from the heavy sea they
were exposed to in their passage. We kindled a fire on the bank
of the river, where we breakfasted. Pittwater is very broad at
this place, dividing itself into several branches, which made a
strict search for the boat very troublesome. I ordered the mate
up to a small island, named Mullet Island, (perhaps from the
great plenty of fish of that name in its vicinity,) giving him
orders to examine the shore carefully on each side, and make
enquiry of the natives or settlers that he might meet with. I
concluded any farther search after this would be unnecessary, as
above the island the boat would be discovered and secured. Ensign
Bareillier preferred walking back with me and my party. We made
an excursion to the top of Pitt-water, which ends in a mud flat
of considerable extent. In the course of our walk we were much
annoyed by a small aquatic plant of a conical form growing in
clusters, with sharp points peeping through the mud. These, and
innumerable small oyster-shells, washed from their native beds by
the tide, fatigued and pained us in an uncommon degree. The
before-mentioned plant, from its insignificant appearance, seems
to have been but little noticed. It hardly ever exceeds five
inches in length, and its thickness differs according to its age,
seldom exceeding that of a man's finger. It is of a pale yellow
colour on the top, very hard and tapering to a point: the nearest
resemblance it has to any plant I know, is the asparagus when
peeping through the earth. After searching the banks of the river
without success, we proceeded on our return to Sydney; to which
we were the rather induced from the small supply of provisions,
particularly of bread, which we had procured from the boat. We
were also in hopes of again seeing the natives we had met with
the night before near the Narrowbine, who would supply us with
some fish. The native we had as a guide had been probably induced
to accompany us for the sake of getting plenty of biscuit, of
which, as already has been mentioned, his countrymen are
remarkably fond. As it was not full tide he led us along the sea
shore under the heights we had travelled in the morning, and very
near a <i>gunnie</i>, or house, which he made us understand was
the place of his birth. The flood-tide set in very rapidly,
which, with our having to travel over a large range of rocks,
much retarded our progress, and from the dashing of the waves
against the base I was apprehensive we should not be able to
accomplish our intentions, but our guide pushed on, and wherever
the passage was difficult or dangerous, he either pointed out the
steps we were to take with his spear, or held out his hand to
assist us. He always carried some of our things, particularly my
boat-cloak. It is but proper for me to observe, that the care and
attention of this rude and uncivilized Savage was highly
exemplary, and merited our best regards.</p>
<p>Upon our arrival at the spot where we left the natives, to our
great disappointment we found they had removed themselves. It was
now about three o'clock, P.M. and it was dark about seven. From
Rose Bay, where I had ordered the boat to meet us in the morning
of the following day, it was nearly five miles to Sydney Cove.
The guide, who now became very hungry, seemed as desirous as
ourselves of finding the natives. He endeavoured by looking at
the paths to find out which they had pursued; accordingly he
pitched on that which led to the place where we had before seen
the two canoes on the sand; but on reaching the spot they too
were gone. As the canoes were not large enough to hold all the
people we had seen, he informed us he knew the path the remainder
had taken. We accordingly, at his request, walked at a round pace
in quest of them, and on our way along the shore he picked up a
lump of what appeared to me to be the Epidermis which adheres to
rocks, and which the force of the tide had thrown up. It was
composed of a glutinous substance and very fetid, yet in this
disagreeable state he sucked and eat it. I have seen the Dutch
fishermen at the Cape of Good Hope make use of it as bait. In
following the track he led us, we penetrated a short distance
into the woods. By the time we reached the place to which I had
ordered the boat it was nearly dark; but as the natives the guide
was searching for could not be a great way off, we were anxious
to get to them. In the accomplishment of our purpose he led us
through various thickets to places likely to be their haunts; and
occasionally set up a kind of howl, at the same time listening if
any answer was given. After he had howled thus for some time, we
discovered a fire kindled on a height close to the shore, and
soon after our guide's howling was answered by similar outcries,
and the fire was seen to blaze forth. Here a kind of conversation
took place betwixt them; when he informed me that he had told
them he was very hungry, and their answer was, that at a short
distance from where we then were, another party was to be found
which had plenty of fish. Accordingly he conducted us to the spot
where the boat was ordered to rendezvous, and giving me my cloak
and the other articles, said he would find out his companions: he
ascended a height and was soon out of sight. The moon now shewed
a little light, having been obscured by clouds, and as a good
many showers of rain had fallen during the day, the ground was
wet; however, being very tired, we laid ourselves down on the
sand, intending to wait till morning, for as to our hungry guide
we did not expect his return. In about three quarters of an hour
after his leaving us, to my great surprise, we heard the sound of
voices approaching us, and it proved to be my first guide and his
wife, already mentioned, coming towards us, dispatched by the
others to our assistance. They brought with them a fish of about
four pounds weight. Here was another trait of the friendly
disposition of these poor people worthy of being noticed. Our
quondam guide told us, that there had been a boat seen with two
white men fishing in it a little before it grew dark, a short
distance from where we then were. One of my people instantly set
off with him in search of the boat, and soon after we heard the
noise of oars in the water. In this boat were a man and boy going
to the southward a fishing; but from the unsettled state of the
weather, they chose to remain for the night near the harbour's
mouth, that they might be ready to push out in the morning. They
readily undertook, for a small gratuity, to pull us up to my
house on Garden Island; and having taken leave of the friendly
natives, we pushed off; and I got home about eleven o'clock at
night.</p>
<p>The officer commanding the boat which went in search of the
fugitives, gave me warning of his approach at seven the next
morning by sounding his bugle-horn. His success was similar to
mine: he picked up another unfortunate young man of the party
which ran off with the Norfolk sloop, in the same starved
condition as the one I had found. He gave an account of his
having remained with another of the runaways till he expired. On
my giving them up to Governor King, I stated to him in how
submissive and penitent a manner they had surrendered themselves
to my party; and that had we not fallen in with them, it was
their intention to return. As an example to the Settlement they
were tried, and were condemned to suffer death; but the Governor
was most humanely pleased to pardon them, on account, no doubt,
of their sufferings. Two of the most daring of the same gang had
some little time before suffered death.&mdash;The youngest of
those that were pardoned, served afterwards on board the Francis
schooner, and on my return from a cruize, came and offered his
services to me in the Lady Nelson, which shewed his gratitude,
but I declined accepting them.</p>
<p>It being now determined by Governor King that we should again
visit the Straits we had passed through on our voyage from
England, and which had deservedly obtained the name of Bass's
Straits, after Mr. George Bass, late Surgeon to his Majesty's
ship Reliance, that Gentleman having first entered them in a
Whale Boat to the eastward, and discovered a harbour to the
westward of Wilson's Promontory; (most probably the southernmost
point of New Holland;) which he named, from its relative
situation, Western Port; as from Sydney it was the westernmost
extent of the Strait known on the north side. It was, however,
reserved for the Lady Nelson completely to ascertain the extent
of the Strait, she sailing along the land nearly four degrees to
the westward of Western Port, as will be seen by the CHART
annexed to this Volume.</p>
<p>I had before received an order from the Governor to send on
shore several articles, principally arms, among which were
included some brass carriage-guns; four of which were put into
the Store, with an equal proportion of every other description of
arms. The reason, as I understood, for this was, that if the
vessel was lost Government would be the less a sufferer. Shrewd
as this kind of reasoning may appear to many, I cannot on my own
account applaud it. My situation was not enviable, for I had
every thing to risk by the responsibility placed on my shoulders;
and that, as already mentioned, with Colonial instead of Navy
pay. Several other circumstances might be here enumerated of a
similar nature, but I do not wish to intrude them on my Readers,
however galling they were to myself.</p>
<p>In a former part of this narrative I mentioned that my crew
was composed (two of my own men excepted,) of Convicts
conditionally emancipated; and as a security four privates of the
New South Wales Corps were sent on board. These men might be
useful both on board, and when we landed in the course of our
voyage of discovery. Ensign Francis Bareillier of the same Corps,
and who was nominated surveyor to the expedition, and Mr. Cayley,
a botanist, also accompanied me. The last-mentioned Gentleman had
been sent out by Sir Joseph Banks for the express purpose of
collecting plants.</p>
<p>Before I proceed farther in my relation, I must be indulged in
remarking, that, although the Lady Nelson had performed a voyage
from England to the Cape of Good Hope at a boisterous season of
the year, and had sailed from thence to New South Wales in
unknown seas, and high southern latitudes, yet doubts and hints
were thrown out that she was not a safe vessel, and was unfit for
the service she was going upon. What rendered this the more
unpleasing to me was, that it came from a quarter, whence
such-like stumbling-blocks ought not to have been expected to be
thrown in my way. What the vessel was capable of performing is
since fully ascertained, and that to the entire conviction of all
unbelievers.</p>
<p>It is true that the winter season of that climate was fast
approaching; and therefore instead of exploring to the southward
we ought to have gone to the northward, by which means we should
avoid many tempestuous gales, &amp;c. We might also by that means
have ascertained if the Gulf of Carpentaria had any inlet to
Bass's Straits; and have by discovery secured more quickly to
Great Britain the right of lands, which some of our enterprising
neighbours may probably dispute with us. And this, I trust, will
not be thought chimerical, when it was not known whether other
Straits did not exist, as well as that dividing New Holland from
Van Dieman's Land. All which has fallen to the lot of later
investigators, and it is probable Captain Flinders has realized
my assertion long before this.</p>
<p>The original idea of Captain Schank, who was the cause of the
Lady Nelson being sent out, was to have discovered all the
territory of New South Wales, and to explore far beyond its
limits, leaving the same to be surveyed at a future opportunity
by those competent to it. All that I aimed at was making an Eye
Sketch of the Coast, and laying it down as accurately as I could,
with a Journal of all Occurrences, Natural History, Soil, with
such Remarks and Observations as I might be able to make. What I
have done is before the Reader; suffice it to say, that all who
have since visited the Coast within the Strait, have by their
views transmitted home substantiated the annexed Sketch, taken in
a single passage out.</p>
<p>Situated as I was in the present instance, I could not throw
any difficulties in the way, but rather thought it incumbent on
me to shew the vessel was fit for any kind of service, and
perfectly safe. Still many advanced contrary doubts and opinions;
insomuch that the son of an Officer of the New South Wales Corps,
who was intended for the sea service and to be under my care, was
persuaded not to embark this trip, but to wait till it was found
out what the vessel would do. However, the person who gave the
advice has since transmitted to England a most favourable report
of her.</p>
<p>On Friday, the 6th of March, we dropped out of Sydney Cove
with a light air at S. and came to between Garden and Clarke's
Islands, in company with the Bee sloop, or rather decked-boat of
14 or 15 tons burthen. This sloop or boat was fitted up by order
of Governor King, to accompany me and be under my command. I
anticipated much assistance from such a vessel if she was found
equal to stand the sea. Odd as it may appear, the Bee was
originally a ship's launch, and raised upon; yet by many she was
deemed safer than the Lady Nelson; she was manned by Convicts,
one of whom commanded her.</p>
<p>On the 7th, we dropped further down the harbour; but owing to
calm weather, were obliged to bring up on the return of the tide.
The following day at five A.M. we got clear out of Port Jackson
with a light breeze from the N.W. At nine A.M. we stood to the
southward. It being my intention to examine Jarvis's Bay in lat.
35&deg; 6, long. 151&deg; E. of Greenwich, lying between Long
Nose and Cape St. George, in order to secure a harbour if obliged
to run out of the Straits, which would prevent much wear and
tear. It would also from its southern situation save time, in
case we were obliged to make a port, since we were unacquainted
with any nearer than Botany Bay.</p>
<p>9th. We had still a light breeze from N.W. until the evening,
when it came on fresh, insomuch that, not wishing to go beyond my
intended port, I hove-to, the Bee in company. At four in the
morning the wind shifted suddenly to the S. with every appearance
of blowing hard, as we had reason to expect at this season of the
year, from that quarter or the W. which was directly against us.
The winter equinox in this country was also at hand. The Bee had
got to the northward of us about half a mile. We both filled and
stood on; the wind, as I suspected, continued to freshen, and
from meeting the sea, which was before moderately high from the
northward owing to the N.W. wind, it became short and
troublesome. At six, I perceived the Bee had hove-to. I made her
signal to make sail, which not being complied with, I bore up and
found her laying-to under a close-reefed main-sail and drag-sail*
in the water. The Master informed me he could not carry sail to
it; that the sea was too heavy for him, and that he had shipped
much water. I advised him to make sail, and try to keep up with
me, as I was not willing to lose his company. He did so, but I
soon saw that she was not a vessel calculated to be with us; for
in getting her round she shipped a considerable quantity of water
abreast of her gangway; and if she was obliged to lay-to in the
weather we then had, she must founder when it blew hard with a
heavy sea. I also found that she had a trick of shipping much
water amidships when close hauled. Apprehensive of the weather
coming on to blow heavy, I judged it a necessary precaution to
write to Governor King, in case she should be obliged to bear up,
the reason of her return. I also had no great opinion of the
Master's abilities should I be obliged to part with him in an
unknown sea, or out of sight of land; as I had sufficient to
convince me, while at Port Jackson, that I was responsible for
every failure or accident that might happen, let it be ever so
unforeseen. Having wrote my letter, I ran close to him, and threw
it on board between two pieces of lead. I ordered him to
persevere as long as he could; told him I was going into Jarvis's
Bay, where he must endeavour to get; but if he found he could not
keep the sea, to bear up and return to Sydney. Having arranged
this matter, and the wind still increasing at S. and S.S.W. at
thirty-five minutes past eleven A.M. I saw her again heave-to;
whereupon I made her signal to bear up, and not perceiving her to
do so, I bore up myself, apprehensive that some accident might
have happened to him. Master informed me that the vessel made
water, and shipped so much that he could not carry sail on her,
but he would lay-to, till he saw how the weather would turn out,
and, if he could, follow me to Jarvis's Bay. I cautioned him
against laying-to too long, for the swell had by this time
increased considerably, and made a free passage over her. Should
it set in to blow a heavy gale he would have difficulty in
scudding. Three parts of my crew were sea-sick, and unable to
move; and as I bad no man of respectability to spare, I could not
furnish the Bee with a person of that description to take her
back to Sydney. After giving the Master the best advice I could,
I made sail and soon got out of sight. From the recent piracies,
I was under some apprehensions they would run off with her,
especially as she had four months provisions of every kind, with
some arms and ammunition on board. These suspicions partly arose
from my knowing that one of her best hands had been concerned in
an attempt of the same kind before, for which he was tried and
pardoned on condition of serving for life. The little knowledge
the Master had of navigation, and the fears the crew entertained
of the vessel, it is very probable prevented them, and I was
happy on my return to learn that she got back safe. Had any thing
happened to her, independent of blame from malicious or designing
people alighting on me, her loss would have been felt by the
Colony, as she was very useful in carrying corn from the
Hawkesbury, and upon other services. At noon had an observation
in lat. 34&deg; 55' S. and saw one of the heads of Jarvis's Bay
bearing S.W. by S. distant six leagues. After twelve at noon the
weather rather moderated, though it still continued very gloomy
with a heavy swell. The wind shifted to S.S.E. we continued
working to windward.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This kind of sail I found particularly useful
in laying-to in the Lady Nelson. Its form is generally
triangular, and slung like a log-chip, which being made fast to a
hawser or stout rope, is veered out through one of the
hawse-holes and immersed in the water. It prevents the the vessel
falling off much when a heavy sea strikes her on the bow; by
which means, if she does not come up very quick again, her beam
would be exposed to the next coming sea. It also prevents her
drifting much. This will be found particularly useful in small
vessels of light draught of water, and flat-bottomed vessels.
This sail is well known to the Dutch, who make use of them in
their large ships which they send to Batavia.]</p>
<p>At four P.M. of the 10th, the north head of Jarvis's Bay bore
W.S.W. eight or nine miles distant. I trust that every impartial
reader of this narrative will allow, that since the last setting
of the above head-land, and with a strong southerly wind, we got
considerably to windward, let whatever faults be attached to the
Lady Nelson. The weather getting clear, we worked into Jarvis's
Bay, or (from the greatness of its extent,) more properly to be
called, Sound. At seven A.M. I sent my first-mate in the boat to
look out for a proper place to anchor in, which would afford us
good shelter. At nine the mate returned with one of the natives,
and informed me that there was good anchorage in the southernmost
Cove, between an island and the main; the former sheltering a
very extensive harbour lying between the two heads of it, thereby
breaking off the heavy swell, which would otherwise roll in with
an easterly wind, and which from its extent, and the great fetch
of the sea, it would be difficult with such a wind to ride in. At
half past ten o'clock we came to an anchor in the above Cove in
four fathom water and fine sandy bottom, having first run over a
flat of about four cables' length, easily perceived by the colour
of the water from the shore when there is any wind, and without
any break that we could discover. There was from two and an half
to three fathoms water on this flat.</p>
<p>The native which came on board in the boat appeared to be a
middle-aged man, more stout and muscular than those I had seen
about Sydney. He entered the vessel without any symptoms of fear,
and altogether with that confidence, which shewed he had had
frequent communications with our countrymen before. He often
repeated the words, <i>blanket, blanket</i>, and <i>woman,
woman</i>; probably from the barter, which some of these visitors
had received in lieu of the seamens bedding. He testified much
surprize at several articles on board, particularly the compasses
in the binnacle. On my conducting him down into the cabin, and
placing him before a looking-glass, he expressed more wonder than
I am able to describe by innumerable gestures, attitudes and
grimaces. He narrowly examined it to see if any one was behind
it; and did not seem satisfied of the contrary, till I unscrewed
it from the place it was fastened to. The sound of a small
bugle-horn had a very great effect on him, and he endeavoured, by
applying it to his own mouth, to make it sound but without
effect, which surprized him very much. I forgot to mention that I
had on board two natives of Sydney, called Euranabie, and Worogan
his wife. These people were also objects of his notice. It is a
remarkable circumstance, and as yet has not been accounted for,
that the natives of New Holland, be they on ever such good terms
together, when they meet after a separation, take little or no
notice of each other, perhaps for half an hour or more; making a
sign for sitting down with their hands only, if a stranger enters
a house. This stranger, whom I had placed near the natives of
Sydney, sat by them without saying a word for above half an hour,
soon after the expiration of which time, great familiarity took
place betwixt them. It appeared evident to me that during the
silence the stranger's attention was directed to the woman,
though like the rest of her countrywomen she was, according to
our notions, far from being possessed of any beauty; however, not
only this man, but many other natives, who visited us in this
place, thought her very handsome; nor was I surprized at this
when I saw some of the females here. Not understanding the
language I could not learn the subjects of their conversation,
but it appeared as if they did not readily understand each other.
From this, and what I discovered in my intercourse with other
parties of the natives, I am inclined to think the language of
New Holland has its different dialects. The men chewed each other
the wounds they had received in war or rencontres; Euranabie had
several which were but lately healed up. The stranger, as already
mentioned, appearing enamoured of the woman, made overtures to
her husband for her, which were rejected. The latter told me he
was apprehensive that the people of this part of the island would
carry her off, but I assured him they should not be suffered to
do so.</p>
<p>Before we got to an anchor several canoes came round us in one
of which was an old man, whose hair had become perfectly white
with age, which joined to a long beard of the same colour made
him a very interesting figure. The natives appeared to pay the
old man great respect and obedience, of which I saw more
afterwards. When we had brought the vessel to an anchor and had
furled our sails, I admitted some of the natives on board, but
the old man could not be prevailed on to be of the party. They
all testified much surprize at what they saw. All the natives of
this part of New Holland are more muscular and robust than those
I had seen at Sydney. In the management of their canoes, and some
things belonging to them, they differed much from whatever I had
seen elsewhere, particularly in paddling, sometimes making use of
an oval piece of bark, and at others of their hands, making the
canoe go very swiftly by either means. When paddling with the
hand they were apt, from its being immersed in the water, to
throw more or less water into the canoe, which with a small
calibash they dexterously threw out by a backward motion of the
other hand without turning their heads. At the heads of their
canoes I observed two or three wooden pins, which I supposed were
designed to steady their fish-gigs, or to receive the heads of
their spears when they carry them from one place to another, or
to serve in the same manner as a crutch for a harpoon or lance in
one of our whale-boats.</p>
<p>From observing the smoothness of our chins, they all expressed
a desire to have their's the same; which some of my people
instantly set about, clipping them close with scissars. Not
seeing any of these people painted, as is the custom of the
Sydney natives, I was desirous of knowing if they were addicted
to it; I accordingly got some red paint, which as soon as one of
them saw, he immediately made signs for me to rub his nose with
it. About our Settlements they are often seen with their noses
painted with a red gum, which is plenty thereabouts; and they
likewise form a circle nearly round their eyes with a whitish
clay. The latter it is said is customary to be used by way of
mourning for the death of a friend. They likewise paint
themselves when they go out to fight. The women also paint their
noses red, and their breasts with a streak of red and white
alternately. Having occasion to leave the deck for a while, on my
return, I observed one of my young men, (who had contrived to get
hold of some of the vessel's paint-pots,) very deliberately
painting the man whose nose I had rubbed with red paint, with
different colours from head to foot, while he grinned his
approbation at the motley appearance he made. His comrades seemed
to enjoy it as much as he did, and they quitted the vessel in
great glee. This circumstance may by some be thought unworthy of
notice, but I relate it merely to shew their disposition and
customs, of which I shall have occasion to speak more fully
hereafter.</p>
<p>The place we came to anchor abreast of, being a fine sandy
beach, favourable for hauling the seine, Mr. Bareillier
accompanied me on shore armed. We took Euranabie, the Sydney
native, with us. On our landing the natives gathered round us,
appearing to have no fear of us. They began a conversation with
Euranabie, using many words which seemed to resemble the Sydney
dialect, such as <i>Bail</i>, signifying <i>No</i>, and
<i>Maun</i>, to <i>take away</i>, or <i>carry off</i>. An elderly
man made Euranabie a present of a <i>waddie</i>, or club, which I
supposed was done to shew a particular regard. To my great
surprize he soon afterwards came up to me with evident marks of
fear depicted in his countenance. On being asked the cause of his
alarm, he solicited permission to go on board the vessel, as
these natives would kill and <i>patter</i>, that is, <i>eat
him</i>. I confess I rather doubted this assertion, for I had not
the smallest idea of the New Hollanders being cannibals; nor can
I even now take it upon me to say they are, though some
circumstances, which I shall presently mention, make it appear
probable. To relieve the poor fellow from his apprehensions, I
immediately sent him on board. This conduct surprized me not a
little, for he had been anxious to come on shore with me; but I
observed from this time, as long as he remained here, he never
again offered to accompany me, though like all his countrymen he
was fond of rambling.</p>
<p>We hauled the seine; in doing which the natives, who were very
numerous, assisted us unsolicited. We caught a few large
whitings, differing in no particular from those we have in our
seas, excepting their superior size. I distributed them amongst
the natives, reserving only three for our own dinner. Many more
having joined us who seemed anxious to get some fish also, I
hauled the seine again; and having caught more whitings and small
snappers, I gave up the whole without division, not wishing to
excite any jealousy, and this I found put an end to all clamour.
Their number was so considerable, and had by this time so much
encreased, that I began to think that many were concealed amongst
the bushes: but as they seemed pleased, and began dancing and
shouting, I had no fear of their proceeding to hostilities. They
were all perfectly naked, except one young fellow, who had a
bunch of grass fastened round his waist, which came up behind
like the tail of a kangaroo. He was active, and as far as I could
judge from his gestures had a degree of humour; he would throw
himself into a thousand antic shapes, and afforded no small
entertainment. Whether he was selected for this purpose, or did
it spontaneously, I could not determine.</p>
<p>Having sent the boat on board with the seine, I was anxious to
get some kangaroos, which from the appearance of the shore, being
of a moderate height, covered with brush and large trees, I made
no doubt were to be found in plenty. I made signs to the natives
for that purpose, and one of them stepped forward and offered his
services. We walked towards the end of the beach we were then on,
and entered the woods. We saw several parrots, and smaller birds
with beautiful plumage. Mr. Bareillier fired at one of the
latter, which so frightened our guide, that he took to his heels
and ran back to his companions. On walking inland we found, at
some distance from the shore, plenty of large forest trees
without any underwood, but excellent grass; among which we sprung
some coveys of quails, or more properly the partridges of New
Holland. They resemble the English partridge very much, but on
rising they do not make any noise, and English pointers will find
them where they lie. The trees we saw were in general what is
termed she-oak about Sydney. We returned to the beach, and went
on board to dinner; but in the afternoon we again made A party
for the shore, taking the seine with us. Having given directions
for the men to draw it, Mr. Bareillier, Mr. Cayley, the botanist,
and myself, with two soldiers armed, entered the woods at the
place we had done so in the morning, with an intention of making
a circuit round to the boat. We saw many perfectly black
cockatoos, excepting the breast, and a few feathers in the wings
which were yellow. These birds were so very shy that we could not
get near them. Parrots with beautiful plumage were very plenty; I
shot one, which falling among the long grass, I could not
afterwards find. Mr. Cayley shot a king parrot. Several other
birds were killed, the flesh of which we afterwards found very
good eating; nor is that of the parrot disagreeable, having very
much the same taste as our pigeon. Indeed, owing as I suppose to
the seeds of the different plants it feeds on, it is in my
opinion far preferable for flavour. This I found to be the case
with several other birds of the smaller tribes which I eat while
in New Holland. No country in the world abounds with a greater
variety of insects. We saw numbers buzzing about the trees, and I
had only to regret that I had not the proper means of preserving
them. Having pursued our walk inland, we fell in with swampy land
in a valley with much brush wood; a rivulet of excellent fresh
water ran briskly through it, emptying itself in the sea, near to
where I had ordered our boat to haul the seine. There were also
several smaller rills of fresh water which we found excellent.
Mr. Cayley had, from the eagerness of his search after plants,
wandered alone out of sight and hearing, which gave me much
uneasiness, as I had cautioned him against it, and the evening
was setting in. I felt myself in a considerable degree
responsible for the conduct of every one who had embarked with
me, and constantly gave them such directions, as I thought
conducive not only to the public service but themselves. We found
the track of the natives, and fell in with several of their
<i>gunnies</i>, or habitations. These are constructed with a few
boughs stuck up to skreen them from the wind: several bones of
beasts, birds and fish were lying about them. On the return to
the boat Mr. Barreillier shot a large hawk, whose legs were
covered with very rough scales. Our fishing party had caught some
fish, and would have been very successful, but two sharks got
into the seine, and tore it in several places; they were both
brought on shore, one of which measured seven feet in length. The
liver, which was very large, I ordered to be carried on board, to
be boiled for the oil, and used in our lamp. It was dark before
we got on board, and I was glad to find that Mr. Cayley, who bad
collected some curious plants, had got on board before me. On
quitting us, he pursued the same path back as we had entered the
woods by.</p>
<p>On the 11th of March, the wind still hanging to the S. I took
some hands on shore to cut a boat-load of wood, and fill our
water-casks that were empty. Whilst they were employed on this
duty, Messieurs Barreillier and Cayley, with two soldiers,
accompanied me on another excursion. We walked about eight miles
inland; and after getting through the wood which skirted the
harbour, we found the soil throughout of a very sandy nature, and
towards the sea sterile, without trees or bushes. The valleys or
low grounds are swampy; the earth in the latter was black,
exactly resembling that where peat or turf is cut in Scotland and
Ireland. We took another direction inland, and travelled through
a great deal of thick cover, but saw no kangaroos. We met with
two small lagoons, and saw several streams of good water running
through the thickest part of the woods. In this excursion we saw
abundance of the feathered tribe, particularly cockatoos,
parrots, and the <i>Laughing Bird</i>, so called from the noise
it makes resembling laughter. Although the sun was still powerful
(which, joined to the closeness of the woods that did not admit a
single breeze, made the temperature of the air warm) we did not
see any snakes. I cannot otherwise account for this, than that
owing to the lateness of the season (this being winter) they had
retired into holes. On our return to the boat we fell in with a
spot of ground very pleasantly situated, which appeared to have
been selected by the natives for the purposes of festivity. It
was a small eminence free from brush, having no habitation near
it. We counted the marks of fifteen different fires, that had
been employed in cooking fish and other eatables, the bones of
which were strewed about. Among them we picked up part of a human
skull, being the <i>Os Frontis</i>, with sockets of the eyes, and
part of the bones of the nose still attached to it. A little
distant from where we found this, we discovered a part of the
upper jaw with one of the <i>molares</i> or back teeth in it,
also one of the vertebrae of the back, having marks of fire,
which the others had not. The grass was much trodden down, and
many of the bones of the animals appeared fresh. From these
circumstances I concluded that the natives occasionally meet at
this place for festivity. I brought off the human bones, and on
getting on board shewed them to Euranabie. Finding two of the
natives from the shore in the vessel, I desired him to ask them,
whether these bones had belonged to a white man or not, and if
they had killed and eaten him. I was anxious to have this cleared
up, as the ship Sydney Cove, from India to Port Jackson, had been
wrecked about twelve months before to the southward, and it was
reported that some of the crew were killed by the natives near
this place. Euranabie accordingly made the enquiries; and from
what I could learn, both by means of a soldier who understood the
Sydney dialect, and through Euranabie, who comprehended and spoke
English tolerably well, I found the bones were those of a white
man that had come in a canoe from the southward, where the ship
<i>tumble down</i>, the expression he made use of for being
wrecked. Although the two natives were repeatedly questioned on
this subject, they never deviated in the least from their first
account. I also interrogated Worogan, the wife of Euranabie, who
spoke English, on this point; and if I was inclined to credit it,
I should certainly do it more on account of what she told me than
what I heard from the two natives of this place. From her I
learned that the Bush Natives, (who appear to be a different
tribe of people from those that live by the sea-side,) sometimes
did eat human flesh. At my request, she shewed me in what manner
they dispatched their victims, which is done by striking them in
the pole of the neck with the <i>waddie</i>, or club; after which
with the <i>womara</i>, or instrument they throw the spear with,
being armed with a shell at one end, they make an incision from
the throat down the breast to the lower part of the belly, and
another across the chest. This she shewed me by putting her hand
in the pole of my neck, and making me stretch myself on the deck,
when she went through the whole process with the very instrument
before described. Seeing her so well acquainted with the subject,
I was in doubt whether she had not been present on such an
occasion. But as far as I could judge from her appearance, she
must have been too young to have any such knowledge previous to
our first settling in the country, as from what I could learn,
she had always lived in the neighbourhood of Sydney, where such
customs are not practised, and I am convinced that she only spoke
from information. However, from these circumstances, my crew
implicitly believed they were all cannibals; and the first-mate
entered the following words in the log-book&mdash;<i>and without
doubt they are cannibals</i>. The natives on board did not shew
any symptoms of fear at our interrogatories at different times,
nor were they at all anxious to conceal any thing from us, but
answered freely and without hesitation.</p>
<p>It perhaps may not be improper to mention in this place, that
in Lieutenant-Colonel Collins's Account of the Settlement of New
South Wales, he says, that the natives are in the habits of
occasionally burning their dead; but whether this extends farther
than to their friends or relatives we are yet to learn. After
repeated enquiries, I never could find out from any of the
natives, Euranabie and others of little note excepted, that they
were cannibals; though their relative situation to New Zealand
might seem to warrant such a conjecture: the question must
therefore remain undetermined till we become better acquainted
with their manners and customs.</p>
<p>The bones I have already mentioned as having taken on board I
carefully preserved, and had them transmitted home to W. L.
Thomas, Esq. a surgeon and anatomist of the first respectability.
To a question I made to that ingenious gentleman, whether the
bones were those of a white man, or otherwise; he said, that he
could not take upon himself to affirm if they were the bones of a
European or a native of New Holland.</p>
<p>On my going out, the same Gentleman favoured me with some
useful queries, which, on my arrival in New South Wales, I laid
before William Balmain, Esq. Surgeon to the Colony, and James
Thompson, Esq. the Assistant Surgeon. The former of these
Gentlemen furnished Mr. Thomas with a complete set of bones
belonging to a male, and an entire female skeleton. His opinion
of them I beg leave to copy from a letter he favoured me with on
the subject, which I trust will not be uninteresting to my
Readers:</p>
<p>"Upon a careful examination (says he) I thought that the
impression formed by the muscles on the bones were very
indistinctly marked, and that the bones were slender and weak in
proportion to their length. With respect to the <i>cranium</i>,
it much more resembled that of the African than the European;
though that of the male differed very materially from both,
approaching in its shape nearer to the ape. The upper margin of
the boney orbits in which the eyes are lodged projected
considerably, which give them the appearance of being compressed
from above, which entirely took away the circular shape at the
interior part, making them somewhat oblong from the inner to the
outer angles. The teeth were very strong and projected
considerably, the left incisor of the upper jaw was wanting, and
the socket which had contained it was completely obliterated, a
circumstance which proves that the tooth must have been removed
some time. The space from the teeth to the extremity of the chin
was extremely short, and retreated backwards. I could not help
remarking the great size of the <i>foramen magnum</i> of the
occipital bone, and also of the boney canals leading to the
internal parts of the organ of hearing. The sides of the
<i>cranium</i> were flattened, and the internal capacity of the
skull was very small."</p>
<p>On the 12th, we got into a clear berth for getting underway;
but in the morning the wind being very variable and light we were
prevented sailing. I went on shore with Mr. Bareillier and our
usual escort, in order to make a survey of the Cove we were lying
in. When preparing to return to the vessel we were joined by
several natives, who appeared anxious to go on board with us. Two
of these were strangers, who signified they had come a long way
to see us, and that they were very hungry. They were both young
stout men, with longer hair than the natives generally have, most
of those I saw, either here or elsewhere, having short curled
hair, but not at all resembling the wool of the African
negroes.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the wind blew strong from the N.E. and E.N.E.
but it was needless to attempt sailing till the wind abated, I
therefore proposed after our dining to go and survey the western
side of the island which lies in the mouth of the harbour, and
shelters the Cove from easterly winds. This island I named Ann's
Island, in compliment to Mrs. King, the wife of the Governor, as
it had not received any name from its former visitors. In putting
the surveying instruments into the boat, the chain was found
missing; on making the necessary enquiries about it, we were of
opinion it had been left on shore by the soldiers who carried it
in measuring the distances. A boat with one of them was sent on
shore, but after a fruitless search they were returning, when a
canoe put off from the island, on which a number of the natives
then were, with a man in it who held up the chain in his hand.
The boat's crew brought him on board to me. On looking at the
chain it was made up in the usual way we did, and tied with a
piece of string; but in undoing it I found that the natives had
untwisted every bend of the wires which contained the
brass-markers, and after taking them off, bent the wires back
into their original form, with this difference, that they placed
the end which is carried in the hand in the middle. This was the
first instance I had experienced of their pilfering any thing;
and as I did not chuse to proceed to extremities, I gave the
native a blanket and some biscuit, and the mate gave him an old
hat, with which he appeared to be highly pleased. The recovery of
the chain was gratifying to me, as I knew there would be much
clamour if it was lost.</p>
<p>We immediately got into the boat to prosecute the intention of
surveying the island, and I took the native with us, towing his
canoe astern. On landing, we were joined by a great number of the
natives, who seemed glad that the man had been rewarded for
carrying back the chain. The blanket attracted their notice much,
the use of which they appeared to know. The old man whom I
formerly mentioned was among them; on seeing me he made signs for
me to sit down at a distance from the rest, and by pointing to
his white beard, signified a wish to have it cut off, which I
immediately did with a pair of scissars, and he expressed much
satisfaction at being rid of it. Observing some of their women at
a distance, I made signs to the old man that I wished them to
come near. He accordingly called to them, upon which they came
and sat down near us. These women were much stouter than I had
seen about Sydney. I observed one of the brass marks of the
surveying chain fastened round the neck of one of their children
hanging down behind. I did not take any notice of it, as I judged
it of more consequence to obtain their confidence and good will,
not only for the benefit of my expedition, but for that of the
Settlement in general. All the women we saw had children. A
little acquaintance made them lay aside the timidity which they
discovered at first. They examined the buttons of my coat, and
the head of my dirk, with great signs of surprize; but what
appeared to please them the most was my watch and its ticking
noise. By the assistance of some of our party, who could speak
the Sydney language, I explained its use to them, as far as they
were able to comprehend it; but though both the men as well as
the women expressed their satisfaction at other things they saw
by loud exclamations and laughing, yet with respect to the watch
they talked in a low voice amongst themselves. From what I could
judge of their behaviour, they seemed to think it was an object
of our adoration and worship.</p>
<p>Among the young people I observed a boy, about twelve years of
age, who was a little deformed. He had a sharp pointed stick in
his hand, the only weapon of defence I had seen amongst them
here; but I found they had weapons not far distant, as will soon
appear. Wishing to get some fresh water, I made signs to the Old
Chief for that purpose; he readily understood me, and getting up,
made me follow him to the side of a hill where some water had
settled, but it not appearing to be from a spring, and too
trifling for a vessel, I expressed my desire to be taken to a
rivulet or constant stream. A native stept forward, as I
supposed, to shew me, but on my following him at a short
distance, he turned back and left us. Thinking from the direction
we were in, that water was not far distant, I took one of my men
with me, to whom I gave my fowling-piece to carry. While going on
we saw another native a little way before us, to whom I signified
what I wanted. As I approached near to him, by a sudden jerk of
his foot he raised and caught up in his hand a spear, which was
much longer than any I had seen in New Holland. From the weapon
rising within six inches of my face, and the sudden impulse of
the moment, I seized the piece from the hands of my attendant.
The native putting the spear on his shoulder, walked leisurely
towards a cliff, over which he looked to the sea, and shortly
after joined his companions. I do not suppose that any thing
hostile was meant, but as by the direction I was taking, I might
have found the spear and kept it, he thought it best to get it
himself. This incident may by many be deemed of little use to be
inserted here; but as it shews they have weapons concealed, it
ought to put us upon our guard to prevent a surprize.</p>
<p>Many of the men and women I saw here were, in all appearance,
marked with the small-pox, and on my pointing to some of the crew
that had marks of that disorder, the natives made signs that they
proceeded from the same disease. From many inquiries I made, I
learned that they had a disorder in this country, which left
marks behind it, but whether it is similar to the small-pox in
Europe, I cannot determine, as I never saw any one of them at the
time they were afflicted with it. I have, however, every reason
to believe it to be the same disorder; and I am the more
confirmed in it, by the evidence of Mr. Sharp, late Surgeon to
the extra East India ship the Cornwallis, who while in New South
Wales, collected a great deal of useful information respecting
the natives. Since his return to England, he has most obligingly
favoured me with many of his observations, among others, those he
made on the small-pox, which had attracted his notice. Whether it
is an original disease of the Island, or introduced by Captain
Cook, or some former navigators, remains yet to be
ascertained.</p>
<p>Having completed our survey, and found plenty of good water on
this island, we returned on board.</p>
<p>At five A.M of the 13th we weighed anchor with light variable
airs, got clear out of the Cove by ten, when we found a moderate
breeze from N.E. and now we made all possible sail to the
southward. It is worthy remark, that Jarvis's Bay or Sound is
large and commodious, easy of access, affording shelter from all
winds, and having room for upwards of 200 sail of ships, with
plenty of wood and water. When this Bay comes to be more known,
it will be found eligible for vessels bound to Port Jackson,
after a long passage from England through meeting with N.E.
winds, and will be the means of saving many lives, as well as
much wear and tear.</p>
<p>On the 14th at noon, we saw Mount Dramesany N.N.W. distant
eight or nine leagues, lat. observed 36&deg; 50' S.</p>
<p>The following day we had squally weather with rain, the wind
having shifted to the S. blowing strong, accompanied with a
breaking and confused sea. At noon it became more moderate and
fair, when Cape Howe bore S.S.W. four or five leagues.
Observation in lat. 37&deg; 13' S. We pursued our route for the
Straits, without any thing particularly happening, except the
occurrences of weather, which were very variable until the 18th,
when we had an observation at noon in lat. 37&deg; 51' S. Point
Hicks bearing N. by E. distant ten or twelve miles. At five P.M.
saw a strange sail in the S.W. quarter. Tacked in order to speak,
and at six sent a boat on board of her. She proved to be the ship
Britannia, Captain Turnbull, from England direct, bound on the
whale fishery. As she was going to Port Jackson to refit, I sent
by her accounts of our proceedings to Governor King. Captain
Turnbull with much kindness politely sent me a few necessaries
that were very acceptable, and for which I shall always retain a
most grateful remembrance. The wind now shifted to the S. and
retarded our progress much.</p>
<p>On the 20th, at eleven P.M. we had a fresh gale from E. and E.
by N. which by eight A.M. gave us sight of Wilson's Promontory,
or South Cape of New Holland, bearing W.S.W. ten or twelve miles.
At half past nine it bore N.W. by N. distant three or four miles.
We passed close to the rock which I had named Rodondo on my
passage out, lying nearly off the end of the Promontory. At ten,
the south part of the Promontory bore N. by E. five or six miles.
At noon we observed in lat. 39&deg; 4*, which, from every
calculation and observation it was in my power to make, I
consider to be the latitude of the southernmost point of New
Holland. We passed close to those Islands on one of which I had
attempted to land in my passage out, and which I had named
Glennie's Islands. The most remarkable object near to them is a
large rock almost circular, and of great magnitude, appearing
like one entire stone on one side, whilst on the other it is
perfectly hollow, and arched on the top, with very high
breast-work, as if intended to oppose the sea. When the wind
blows strong into this opening it must, from its height, make a
noise that will be heard several miles off. The water is very
deep close to this rock, and we passed within pistol shot of
it.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The French Navigators have determined that
Point to be in latitude 39&deg; 10'. Mr. Bass says, 38&deg;
56'.]</p>
<p>From Wilson's Promontory, which is high and steep, the land
trained away to the N.N.W. as far as the eye could reach, and
fell down into low level land towards Cape Liptrap, and from
Glennie's Islands. The course by compass is N.W. &frac14;W. or
N.W. westerly. But it must be observed, that the straight course
from the south point of Wilson's Promontory to Cape Liptrap is
nearly W. by N. as Mr. Bass has laid it down in the sketch he
made from the whale boat. The land between the two points falls
back into a deep inlet which we did not see the bottom of,
keeping as close as we could to the wind, and steering from N.W.
to N.N.W. This inlet when better known will, in case of easterly
winds, afford shelter to vessels bound to the Eastward and
meeting with such winds. We penetrated on our return from Western
Port far enough into it to see that it ended in a low sandy
beach. The wind at five A.M. having shifted from N.N.E. to W.N.W.
and varying to the S. accompanied with rain and squalls, I did
not at this time judge it prudent to come to an anchor in it.</p>
<p>In pursuing our course towards Western Port from Cape Liptrap
the coast trains for a considerable distance N.N.W. and then from
E.S.E. to W.N.W. It is a sandy beach and low land, on part of
which the grass appeared to be burnt. The land seemed to be
level, and the soil good.</p>
<p>The next Point to the W. of the Cape just mentioned, which
bears according to the courses we ran N. 38&deg; W. distant about
eighteen miles. There is a low reef of rocks running off from the
shore about a mile; and as it was necessary to distinguish this
Point, I named it Cape Paterson, in compliment to Colonel
Paterson of the New South Wales Corps. Another Point to the W. of
this has also a rocky reef running off from it to some distance,
and appearing above water.</p>
<p>At four P.M. of the 21st we had sight of the Island which
forms the south head of Western Port, having the likeness of a
snapper's head, or horseman's helmet. By eight we were up with
it, and on opening the entrance of the port I found two small
Islands situated about three quarters of a mile from the south
head, with apparently a good passage between them, and the island
forming the harbour. From its likeness, as above-mentioned, to a
snapper's head, I named it Snapper Island: it falls in a high
clay bluff down to the water's edge. The small islands lying off
from it were covered with seals, numbers of which on our approach
precipitated themselves into the sea, covering the passage, while
others remained on the rocks making a very disagreeable noise,
somewhat like the grunting of pigs. They were of a large size,
many of them being nearly equal to that of a bullock. I judged
them to be of that species of the seal called by the fishermen
Sea Elephants, accordingly I named these, Seal Islands. I sent a
boat ahead to sound the passage, and found between the Seal
Islands and the South Head twelve, nine, six, five, and three and
a half fathoms water, which last was the shoalest in mid-channel.
This passage will shorten the distance when there is a leading
wind, but standing round to the westward of Seal Islands there
will be found sufficient room for any number of vessels to beat
in. Mr. Bass, when he visited this place in the whale boat,
entered the port by the eastern passage, which is much the
smallest, and coasting the western shore from whence he made his
remarks. It is probable that these islands lying so close to the
opposite side of him, they did not shew themselves to be detached
from the southern side of the entrance, and this I judge because
he makes no mention of them. And I am the more inclined to this
opinion, as no one has ever thought of looking here for seals,
notwithstanding they may be found in great numbers, with an
excellent harbour, affording good shelter for vessels employed in
pursuit of them.</p>
<p>It had rained constantly and heavily all the night, and by its
continuance we could not see any great distance from the vessel,
therefore I kept the lead going as she worked up the harbour. The
soundings were from 17 to 10, 6 and 21 fathoms, the bottom muddy,
but in the shoals sandy, which generally was the case when we
stood over to the western side. Before leaving this place I will
endeavour to account for it.</p>
<p>At half past five P.M. came to an anchor in six and a half
fathoms of water, fine sand, and abreast of a sandy point,
bearing W. three quarters of a mile, which I named Lady Nelson's
Point, as a memorial of the vessel, as she was the first decked
one that ever entered this port.</p>
<p>As the sun crossed the Equator this day to the northward, and
heavy weather might be expected, I was glad to find a harbour
that could afford us good shelter.</p>
<p>Mr. Barreillier went on shore with the second mate, and on
their return they brought two ducks and a black swan which they
had shot. They saw plenty of black swans, and red bills, an
aquatic bird so called, whose back is black, the breast white,
beak red, and feet not full webbed. It is an excellent eating
fowl, much resembling in flavour a wild duck, and nearly of the
same size.</p>
<p>On Sunday the 22d, or according to our sea account the 25d, it
being past twelve o'clock at noon, I went with two of our crew in
the smallest boat to search for a river or stream, described by
Mr. Bass, at the head of the harbour, where fresh water was to be
got. As a considerable track appeared to be perfectly dry at low
water a short distance from the vessel across the harbour, with
only small channels in some parts of it, I found it necessary to
explore and sound the best passage, so as to have it always in
our power, if possible, to get through the muddy flat. Pelicans
and albatrosses in great numbers visit this flat, previous to its
being left dry at low water, to pick up their food. In proceeding
along the shore, I fell in with an island, pleasantly situated,
and separated from the Main by a very narrow channel at low
water, but even then sufficient for a boat to pass, though much
larger when the tide is in. I passed through it and landed on the
island towards the N. and W. It is of gradual ascent, well
covered with trees of a considerable height, and much underwood.
The situation of it was so pleasant, and the prospects round it
so agreeable, that this, together with the richness of the soil,
and the sheltered position of the spot, made me conceive the idea
that it was excellently adapted for a garden. Having determined
upon establishing a garden in this place, I thought it incumbent
upon me to give the island the name of Churchill, after a
generous and public spirited Gentleman, John Churchill, Esq. of
Dawleish, in the county of Devon, who, on my leaving England,
supplied me with a variety of seeds of useful vegetables,
together with the stones of peaches, nectarines, and the pepins
or kernels of several sorts of apples, with an injunction to
plant them for the future benefit of our fellow-men, be they
Countrymen, Europeans or Savages. I had, moreover, been furnished
with many seeds for the like liberal purposes, by my friend Capt.
Schank; but let me not omit the pepin of an apple, differing from
all other fruit of the kind, in having rarely more than one pepin
in each apple. I hope the name I gave with it in New Holland will
not be forgotten (Lady Elizabeth Percy's Apple) should it happen
to prove a common fruit of the country, as it was owing to her
Ladyship's care and attention in preparing the pepins, that I was
enabled to introduce it. Whatever is for the benefit of mankind
cannot be of indifference, I therefore think I need make no
apology to the feeling reader for this short digression.</p>
<p>From several good observations, I found Western Port to lie in
lat. 38&deg; 32' S. and that by the Chronometer its longitude was
146&deg; 19' to the eastward of Greenwich.</p>
<p>I found in Churchill's Island several holes of large size,
apparently the burrows of an animal. There appeared to be no
traces of the kangaroo on it. I had intended to make search for
some stream of fresh water, but having traversed the country to
some distance, and night approaching with the tide at ebb, I
returned on board the vessel. My crew had caught a number of
flat-heads alongside: this fish has its name from the shape or
its head, is common to this country, and is good eating. They saw
some sharks of a considerable size, and caught three or four
small ones.</p>
<p>Messieurs Barreillier and Murray went on shore in the morning
following with an intention of making a survey of part of the
harbour. Mr. Cayley likewise set out on his botanical researches.
The second mate was dispatched to make discovery of the fresh
water stream. In the mean time I explored the banks of a
considerable Creek which opened abreast of the vessel. The
weather was unsettled, and towards the evening heavy rain and
squalls came on from the W.S.W. No traces of fire or tracks of
the natives were discoverable; but notwithstanding the lateness
of the season, the earth was clothed with variety of vegetables,
and birds of various kinds were to be seen everywhere. In the
course of my progress up the Creek, I observed a great number of
black swans, with ducks and red-bills; here too I saw the
sea-gull, differing in no respect from the bird so called with
us. The bushes abounded with small birds, many of them having
beautiful plumage, and some melodious, and seemingly vying with
each other in their notes. I observed a general shyness among the
feathered tribe, and concluded they were often pursued by the
natives. The ducks were particularly so, and it was with much
difficulty I could come within gun-shot of them. Night brought on
a general rendezvous of our parties on board the vessel. Mr.
Cayley had made discovery of a few new plants, but perhaps from
the lateness of the season, not in such plenty as he had
expected. He had penetrated a considerable way in Snapper Island,
but did not find the trees so large on that rich soil as I had
reason to expect from those I had seen on Churchill Island. My
second mate returned, not having discovered the stream he went in
search of, the harbour being very extensive, and the stream
itself small.</p>
<p>The weather continuing wet and squally, and the atmosphere
obscure and close, several objects of our intention could not be
prosecuted. The 25th and 26th being clear and fine, search was
again made for the fresh water stream; the survey was carried on,
and a part of my crew was sent on shore to twist some small rope
for our running rigging. I went up the Creek already mentioned in
the boat, and found it to terminate in a large salt marsh, having
the appearance of being at times overflowed to a considerable
extent: the trees were not very large, but the underwood was very
thick; however I penetrated through it to a considerable
distance, and found here and there spots that appeared as if they
had been cleared by manual labour. These spots were covered with
good tender grass, and afforded by their agreeable verdure great
pleasure to the sight. Part of my object was to make discovery of
the natives, but herein I was disappointed, as not the least
traces were discoverable that any had been here. I had chosen for
a companion in this research my Sydney native, whom I found in
many respects very useful, especially when penetrating a thicket,
as he usually went first and cleared a passage for me to follow
him. Though always barefooted, and sometimes naked, he had by
practice acquired a facility of passing through the thick
underwood, and could effect his passage in much less time than
any of us.</p>
<p>The open land, which, as I have mentioned, had the appearance
of being frequently overflowed, was clothed with grass, which
grew everywhere luxuriantly, and seemed like other salt marshes,
well adapted for the purpose of fattening cattle. As we passed
down the Creek we saw several sting-rays of a large size. The
length of this Creek is about two miles and a half, the water is
perfectly salt, and it ends in a small run of about twelve feet
in breadth. The tides which overflow here must evidently, at
times, be greatly agitated, beyond what I am able to account for
by the usual causes of wind happening to increase the height and
force of spring tides. In many places the mud appeared to be
washed up in high banks, and deep ravines to have been formed,
and this not long since, as I judged from the softness of the
mud, which made walking on it not very practicable. I could only
attribute these floods to rain, which in this country often falls
in very heavy torrents. The Hawksbury river has afforded many
examples of this, as it is sometimes suddenly swoln, in a manner
unknown in respect to the rivers of Great Britain, to the great
damage of the crops adjoining to it, all before the flood being
swept away in a general desolation. This marsh or flat extends
for some miles in length and breadth, and I examined it to a
considerable distance from the end of the Creek, in order to
discover, if possible, some fresh spring water. I dug several
holes with much eagerness, but found no water but what was
brackish, beyond what is generally understood even by that
epithet.</p>
<p>My second mate was more successful in his search, and had
discovered the stream of fresh water. He had likewise taken a
couple of cygnets which he brought on board alive; one of these
became tame, and on my return to Sydney was presented to Governor
King.</p>
<p>On the 27th March, Mr. Murray went, accompanied by Messrs.
Barreillier and Cayley, with instructions to explore the fresh
water stream, and to report how far it might be eligible for the
purpose of a watering place. As to myself I made excursions along
shore to the mouth of the harbour.</p>
<p>The beach was covered with shells, many of them beautiful, and
some of them entirely new to me. I observed another Creek not so
large as the former which I have described, but having its
entrance quite filled up with beach, so that the sea could not
enter it. The land in general was much above the level of the
sea, and abounded with underwood interspersed with trees. The
soil was in some places light and black, in others a red clay. I
was still attended by the faithful Euranabie; and it chanced that
we fell in with a rocky point, about which I observed playing in
the water a number of those kind of fishes, called salmon in New
Holland, as I suppose from their scales, for in no other respect
do they resemble the fish to which we give that name. These fish
are, however, excellent eating, and are generally found in
shoals. I expressed a desire to the native of having some, and
asked him whether they would bite at the hook, to which he
replied in the affirmative. I had no sooner expressed my wish on
this matter, than turning about, I missed my companion from
behind me: not divining the true cause of his absence, I grew
impatient and hallooed for him, upon which he instantly presented
himself from the wood with a small stick in his hand. Asking me
for my knife, he presently sharpened one end to a point, and then
stripping* himself, he leaped from one point of the rock to
another until he met with an opportunity of striking a fish,
which he did, the stick penetrating quite through it; and in this
state he came and presented it to me. During this transaction, I
could not but admire the keenness of his sight, and his ability
to preserve the steadiness of his position, standing as he did on
the rough edge of a sharp rock, the sea washing above his knees,
his eyes intent upon the fish, very difficult to strike from the
smallness of its size, presented to him in a narrow back. I have
before remarked upon the gentle disposition which is so striking
a feature in the character of the New Hollander. In the
individual, of whom I am now speaking, it was remarkable; his
attention and readiness to oblige upon all occasions were very
great. Though I pressed him to take the fish several times, he as
constantly refused it, but accepted of some tobacco, which he was
exceedingly fond of smoking.</p>
<p class="foot">[* When Euranabie and his wife came on board the
vessel, at Sydney, they both of them received clothing; but when
the weather proved warm, the woman threw aside her gown and
petticoat, and preferred appearing in the state of nature, or
slightly covered with a blanket.]</p>
<p>About this time Euranabie's wife, Worrogan, had declared
herself pregnant, a circumstance I by no means suspected, as from
the symptoms she discovered of a general listlessness and
indisposition to motion, I had apprehended owing to being
unaccustomed to live on shipboard, she was attacked with the
scurvy; a disorder, however, which did not prevail amongst my
crew. With this idea, I prescribed air and exercise on shore, and
obliged her to accompany her husband and me, which I was not
always able to do without much difficulty. When at length she
made her situation known to me, she did not at the same time
scruple to declare her intention of making away with her
offspring; and the reason she gave for it was, that she did not
like the trouble of nursing. I believe this was really the case,
as I saw her afterwards several times, and to the very period of
my leaving the Colony, when she was without a a child, and to
every appearance not in a state of pregnancy. It is shocking to
relate, but it is well known, that the women of New Holland do
sometimes destroy their children at their birth, and even
afterwards, if they prove froward. One of them applied to a
female convict to lend her a spade that she might bury her child
alive, as she said it cried very much, and was not worth rearing
up. Upon being refused, she ran away and left her child with the
woman, which pined and died for want of the nourishment of the
breast. There is reason to think that the New Holland women have
a secret method of destroying the <i>f&oelig;tus in utero</i>, a
horrid practice, and which is often of fatal consequence to
themselves.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* This, with their constant wars made on each
other, in a great measure, accounts for their thinness of
population.]</p>
<p>On the 28th March, 1801, not having found any other place
fitter for the purpose, I went on shore at Churchill's Island,
with the resolution of clearing ground for a garden, as I before
mentioned was my intention. The party I took with me burnt a
space of about 20 rods; they felled the larger trees, the timber
of which was reserved to be used as will be hereafter mentioned.
I was pleased to find the soil easy to dig, rich and loose.</p>
<p>My first mate was returned with his party, and informed me
that he had gone up the river as far as the boat could go, he
found it to wind very much, to the number of 42 short reaches,
that the breadth of the entrance was about half a cable's length,
and at the farthest part the boat went, not more than 18 or 20
feet, the passage being there impeded by trees lying across it.
He informed me that he had seen no natives, but had discovered
several marks of fires.</p>
<p>This was the first account I had of the probability of there
being natives to be met with here. The mouth of the river, he
said, was defended by a considerable sand flat, which only
afforded one place with sufficient depth of water for the boat to
pass. From thence he found from three feet to four fathoms water,
which at half flood was somewhat brackish.</p>
<p>On the 29th I sent the first mate with instructions relative
to ascertaining certain particulars respecting the entrance of
the port, and with regard to Seal Islands, on which last he was,
if possible, to land. Mr. Barreillier went likewise in order to
proceed further in his survey. Soon after their departure the
weather proved boisterous and blew strong; they were thereby
prevented landing on the islands. They brought the boat to an
anchor off a sandy beach, which appeared to have no surf, when
they were suddenly surprized with a heavy swelling sea, which
being immediately followed by another of the same, the boat
filled and was upset on the beach. Fortunately no lives were
lost, though all were immersed in the water, from which Euranabie
(who was of the party) first escaped to shore. However, the
provisions and ammunition which they had provided themselves with
were lost or spoiled. At the turn of the tide they launched the
boat and returned on board.</p>
<p>I have had occasion to remark, not only here, but in Simon's
Bay at the Cape of Good Hope, and in other places, that the sea
has appeared perfectly calm along shore for the space of half a
cable's length from the beach, when it would get up and break
with much force, then be still again for ten minutes or a quarter
of an hour, and rise again in the same manner.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this unforeseen and sudden disaster, the
Gentlemen had saved from the wreck a black swan and four ducks,
which they shot on their passage out, and this afforded them and
us, who were on board, the consolation of a savoury meal.</p>
<p>On the 31st, I went up the fresh water river, accompanied by
Mr. Barreillier. At night we encamped on its banks, when there
came on an exceeding heavy storm of rain, with thunder,
lightning, and high wind, by which we were thoroughly drenched,
before we could raise a temporary shelter by means of branches
and boughs of trees. We traced a branch of the river on the
right, a small distance from the mouth of this stream, as far as
our boat could go; we then followed its course on shore, along
the bank, and found it was fed by the greater river only. This
carried us some distance inland, and we discovered marks of fires
that had been made by the natives. We found the banks thickly
covered with underwood, but towards the end of this branching
stream the country appeared to open and to afford plots of very
rich pasture. The soil everywhere was black and rich, and the
country level. At some considerable distance, however, the land
rose to a height, and being covered with large trees, which
appeared to have been shattered by storms, had for this reason
obtained the name of Mount Rugged. We marched pretty far inland,
and found the country everywhere free from inundations,
interspersed with woods and open plains, and exhibiting a very
picturesque appearance. The day was remarkably fine and pleasant,
but in the woods the air was very close and disagreably sultry.
My people had killed a small black snake which they had found in
the meadows, and which the warmth of the weather had invited from
its retreat. The same kind of snake is common about Sydney, and
there it is thought to be venemous, though from the flatness of
its head I should not be inclined to think so. This was about
eighteen inches in length, the belly having a cast of dirty red,
the back grey.</p>
<p>We saw no kangaroos during our progress inland. We pursued our
course up the river as far as our boat had before proceeded, and
Mr. Barreillier completed his survey to the same distance. At low
water we found it perfectly sweet and good, and accordingly
filled our casks, having brought them with us for that purpose.
The banks of this river are sufficiently high to keep it within
bounds in the highest tides. The sides of the river have trees of
a large size growing on them, with much underwood, and we
observed a number of birds settling on them. Among these we noted
the bird called the <i>Bell Bird</i>, which has no remarkable
plumage, but a note not unlike the tinkling of a bell; so that
when a number of these birds are collected together, the noise
they make is similar to that made by the bells of a team of
horses. Amongst other birds of various note, we often
distinguished the laughing-bird, whose note can only be compared
to the ha! ha! ha! of a hearty laughing companion. The plumage of
this bird is a mixture of black and white, or rather grey, and in
size it may be compared to a thrush; but its loudness deceives
the hearer, who is not a little surprized to find a bird so small
and so loud. The laughing-bird is an early visitor, and was
usually the first to salute us in a morning. We shot a duck which
differed from any we had hitherto seen here, and is not unlike
the wild duck found in the British Islands, though rather of a
smaller size. When flying it makes a whistling noise with its
wings, so that a flock of them together cannot fail to excite
attention, insomuch that this fowl has now, from that property
acquired, and is become generally known throughout the Settlement
by the name of the whistling duck.</p>
<p>Mr. Barreillier and I continued our progress on the bank of
the river, until we were able to cross it by means of a tree
which had fallen directly over where the stream became contracted
in width. The underwood here was very thick, and many of the
shrubs were thorny, so that our passage was troublesome and slow.
We therefore made a circuit inland to the place where we had left
our boat. The weather proving uncomfortably wet gave us little
chance of meeting with any variety of birds; we were fortunate
enough however to fall in with some rare and uncommon cockatoos,
one of which Mr. Barreillier shot, and a faithful representation
of it will be found in the annexed Plate, after a design from the
elegant pencil of Major-General Davies, of the Royal Artillery,
to whom Governor King presented the preserved specimen.</p>
<br>

<br>
<small>PSITTACUS FRIMBIATUS FRINGE CRESTED COCKATOO.</small></p>
<br>
<p>We proceeded through the wood until we came to an extensive
and level country, which was entirely clear of timber and
underwood. The grass was so luxuriant here that it was difficult
to pass through it as it reached above our knees. Here we
discovered evident traces of paths made by kangaroos. This plain
extended farther than we could see on one side, on the other it
was bounded by hills. We walked over it to some distance, and
found the soil rich and good: the grass, with which it was
everywhere plentifully covered, had the appearance of rye grass,
much like that which I had seen in England. And I do not hesitate
to pronounce, that I saw no land about Sydney or Paramatta which
for richness of soil appeared better adapted for the purposes of
agriculture. In saying this, I do not mean to confine the
observation to a small spot, such as I then viewed, but to the
general face of the country, which I had occasion afterwards to
go over to the extent of several miles, finding it almost
everywhere level, productive of the richest and finest grass,
free from swamp, and secured from inundation.</p>
<p>We returned to the river side, and having ordered the boat to
drop lower down a few miles, we walked along the bank, through a
forest of stately timber trees. Amongst these I observed some
which had grown to the height of 60 or 70 feet without any
branches, except at the top: these were slender and light wood,
seeming to me very fit for the scantling of houses. With this
idea I had a few of them cut down and brought on board the
vessel; some of the smaller ones I converted into boat-hook
staves, and found them answer as well as any I had brought from
England for that purpose. I brought Governor King specimens of
these light durable woods, and a species of sassafras, which was
discovered by my second mate, in cutting the other wood. We had
trial made of this last on board, and found it alike in flavour,
and, no doubt, in quality, with the sassafras in common use here
at home. I must not omit doing justice to the diligence and
talents of the young man I have just mentioned, whose use and
value I have experienced on many occasions.</p>
<p>On our way down the river we stopped at the place where we had
passed the preceding night, and found our fire still burning. To
this spot we gave the name of the Halfway House, being half way
up the river, and the place where we found the conveniency of
watering. As to the but we erected, I contemplate with pleasure
the surprize it must give the natives that shall hit upon it, and
the seasonable shelter it may afford some of them as it did
us.</p>
<p>On our return to Churchill's Island, I found my people had
cleared the spot I had laid out for a garden, and that there was
nothing wanting but to prepare the ground to receive such seeds
as I should chuse to plant. And here we were under a difficulty
which it was no easy matter to remedy, for we had neither hoe nor
spade with us. It is true, I had brought out the latter
implements for gardening with me from England, by the advice of
my friend Captain Schank, who foresaw the occasion we should have
for them, and they were delivered, amongst other things, into his
Majesty's storehouse, from whence, from whatever principle of
economy and good management, it was not easy to draw any thing
out again.</p>
<p>However we were in possession of a coal-shovel, which, though
it was thin and much worn, served the purpose, the soil being, as
I have already observed, exceedingly light and easy to work:
indeed a spade was much wanted in another respect, which was
digging for water, an experiment I was desirous of making, and
which I found could not well be made with a coal-shovel. There
happened another proof of my being provided with implements which
I should have occasion for, and could not avail myself of,
because they were disposed of in the same manner as the garden
utensils had been. I had brought out traps of all sorts and
sizes, from the man-trap to the mousetrap; and I certainly had
occasion for one of the middle size of these, and that on account
of an incident, which I now proceed to relate.</p>
<p>My men, who slept on the ground which they had cleared for a
garden, in a but which they had built for the occasion, informed
me that one of their comrades was awakened out of his sleep by
some animal, that seemed to be gnawing his hair, which he had
driven away, but as it was dark he could not observe its shape or
figure. He supposed it to be the Bandicoot rat, an animal that
seldom appears by day-light; and it being well known that the
Colony was infested with such vermin, and having remarked several
burrows in different places of this island, I was inclined to
give into the same opinion. In order to give this nocturnal
visitor a suitable reception, I sent on board for a dog of the
English breed, which we had brought out with us from Sydney. This
dog remained with the people on the island, and, as they reported
to me, was one night engaged with some animal apparently of equal
strength, for it brought him to the ground and made him howl,
till at length it escaped into the wood. Still no one was able to
give any account of it, the darkness being great, and the animal
escaping unhurt. The dog had received some scratches about his
nose, but being of the stag-hound kind could not possibly have
been mastered by so insignificant an animal as a Bandicoot rat;
however, had we had the good fortune of having then with us one
of the traps, which were so snugly lodged in his Majesty's store
at Sydney, I had possibly given a more satisfactory account to
the Reader of the animal, which occasioned this alarm amongst my
men; but not being able to do this, I have only to intreat his
pardon for having trespassed upon his patience with this
digression.</p>
<p>The ground was now prepared, and I sowed my several sorts of
seeds, together with wheat, Indian corn and peas, some grains of
rice, and some coffee berries; and I did not forget to plant
potatoes. With the trunks of the trees I felled I raised a
block-house of 24 feet by 12, which will probably remain for some
years, the supporters being well fixed in the earth. Indeed I was
anxious to mark my predilection for this spot, on account of its
beautiful situation, insomuch that I scarcely know a place I
should sooner call mine than this little island. Round this
skeleton of a mansion-house I planted the stones and kernels of
the several fruits I had brought out, not forgetting that of the
curious apple before mentioned. I made this plantation rather
late in the season, but I am in hopes that some of the crops will
flourish, and I wait the pleasure of a good report hereafter.
Several of my crew remained on this island for seven or eight
days, but saw no more of the strange animal. Birds they found,
and particularly parrots in great numbers; but in their search
for water they were unsuccessful, though I am strongly of opinion
it might be procured by digging, and there appeared to be nothing
to prevent digging for it to a proper depth. We turned up a few
stones, and some interspersed with veins of iron ore, indeed so
rich of the metal, that they had a visible effect on the needle
of our compass. Stones of the like kind are likewise found about
Sydney and in other parts.</p>
<p>On the 21st, Mr. Bowen, my second mate, having been sent up
the river for fresh water, returned with part of a canoe, which
he had found sunk near the mouth, together with the two paddles
belonging to it, and some line used in fishing. This canoe
differed from any before seen, as it was framed with timber, and
instead of being tied together at the ends was left open, the
space being afterwards filled with grass worked up with strong
clay. This specimen together with whatever else I collected was
deposited, according to the orders I received, with Governor
King.</p>
<p>We moved over to the opposite shore, in order to near a small
island, lying in the opening of the extensive arms described by
Mr. Bass, of which this port has two branching out to the
northward. I named this island Margaret Island, in honour of Mrs.
Schank, to whom I am indebted for several articles, useful on
board my little vessel, but too numerous to be mentioned here.
The tide ebbing very fast, we found ourselves in shoal water; but
the bottom being a soft mud, and the weather calm, there was
nothing to be apprehended further than our being detained there
longer than we might have wished. And to shew how little water we
drew, and how well calculated such a vessel is for searching
unknown Creeks and Rivers, independent of more extensive
discoveries, I must observe, that when the vessel's fore-foot
touched the mud the stock of the anchor we let go was above
water. To enable my Readers, who are seamen, to form a judgment
of our depth of water, I must here premise, that our anchor was
four hundred weight, and had an iron stock to it.</p>
<p>This, I trust, will shew the advantage which a vessel of this
construction has over others. For supposing a vessel of the same
kind to approach a shore, having only three feet water, and
forced thereon by severity of weather, with a heavy surf
breaking, she would not so soon take the ground, and that at a
less distance from the land, than a vessel of the same size built
in the usual way. Now the latter, if sharp built, would by the
surge probably be laid on her side, when the following sea would
overwhelm her, whereas the former has a great chance to be
carried so near the shore by the first sea, that every body might
safely get out of her. Such I take to be one of the properties
belonging to a vessel, constructed on the like principle to the
Lady Nelson. In the instance I have here given, I have confined
myself to a sandy beach or flat strand; but suppose the shore a
vessel is cast upon be of any other kind, the vessel of the
smallest draught of water is most likely, if not to save herself;
at least to save her crew. Let it be considered, that a vessel
thrown on shore is, after her first touching the ground, forced
further upon it by every succeeding wave, until the power of the
sea is unequal to carry her a greater length; and then if she is
not well put together, or the sea happen to be of great strength,
she is beaten to pieces. All that can be done, in such an
extremity, is to ease or lighten her as much as possible. If then
a vessel can lay her bow down, in three feet water, with all her
stores for two or three months on board, is it not clear that she
has an advantage over another drawing six? And it is most likely
that a vessel of sixty tons, built in the usual way, will not
draw much less. Now, admitting that the former has been obliged
to cut away her masts, and throw every thing of weight overboard,
provided the bowsprit be preserved, and she end on, which, until
she first took the ground, it is probable would be the case, the
crew would be able, on the retreat of the sea, to land nearly on
the beach.</p>
<p>But to proceed, as I am no friend to vessels being on the
ground, unless there be an absolute necessity for it, by carrying
a hawser out I soon hauled her off, and brought her up nearer to
Margaret's Island, at which we stayed for some time.</p>
<p>We found this island to be in general flat, but well covered
with wood. Here we deposited some seeds; but did not find the
soil equally rich with that of Churchill's Island. Mr.
Barreillier and I went for a great length of way up this arm, and
saw every where a level and very fertile country, having many
woods of large timber trees, intermixed with open savannahs of
the most rich and luxuriant grass. We explored in the boat
several small creeks running up in the country; coming to the end
of some, we walked forward and observed many clear spots,
affording excellent pasture. Here was, however, a want of streams
of fresh water; and having by some accident lost a part of what
we brought with us from the vessel, we found a pressing call for
that necessary beverage. Luckily I heard the bullfrog, which is
common to New South Wales, and I made towards the thicket from
whence his croaking issued, and there found a present supply. The
water indeed was stagnant, but it was sweet; and as this reptile
is an inhabitant of moist places, I make no doubt water will be
found by digging in most spots frequented by the bull-frog.</p>
<p>On our way up we found a rapid tide with many whirlpools,
occasioned by the deep holes which it had formed in the soft mud.
This arm being nearly dry at low water, reminded me of the
appearance of Portchester Lake when the tide is out. Indeed the
entire view of Western Port has no small resemblance of Spithead
and Portsmouth Harbour.</p>
<p>We encamped for the night on the borders of a lagoon which
abounded with ducks, and here we found some <i>gunnies</i> or
habitations of the natives, about which fish and other bones were
strewed in great profusion, with egg-shells of an uncommon size.
We observed the tracks of quadrupeds, which we sup posed to be
made by the native dogs, if so, they were of a larger size than
any I had before seen. These tracks were impressed deep in the
sand, very round, and without any mark of the claw.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Dutch boors had pointed out to me, whilst
I staid at the Cape the distinguishing marks, whereby to discover
the different tracks of the tyger, and the wolf or dog. In their
bunting excursions they are often forced to follow their game
into thick cover, and find it necessary to examine the various
traces of the animals sheltering themselves there: thus they know
those made by the tyger, as they have not the mark of the claw
which those of the dog, the wolf, and the hy&aelig;na have.
Besides which, the three last animals leave a longer mark with
their feet. Those we saw here were perfectly round, and without
the mark of the claw, yet I believe them to belong to the dog of
the country, as more of the heel or back of the foot was shewn,
than I could discover by tracks made by tygers. However, it must
be left to future discovery to ascertain whether there be any
other animal in this country than the dog. The tracks were
numerous, and the foot-marks of various sizes, but the largest
did not exceed the bigness of those of a large Newfoundland
dog.]</p>
<p>On the 17th we got under weigh, and at night brought up in
twelve fathom water, with rather a foul bottom. In the morning we
discovered a sand shoal, whereon the waves were breaking very
heavily close to us. This ought to be carefully avoided by
keeping the south and east shores on board, as it lays a long
distance from the north and west side, and has at all times a
surf on it. We availed ourselves of this bottom, and in half an
hour caught abundance of large snappers. We shifted our berth,
and brought up in a small nook or bay, which I named Elizabeth
Cove, in honour of Miss Elizabeth King, daughter of Governor
King, then at Sydney.</p>
<p>Great part of the survey of this extensive harbour being
completed on the 22d of April, notwithstanding the delay
occasioned by wet and unfavourable weather; and there being yet
more to do, I was anxious to be gone. We were, however, detained
by the badness of the weather until the 29th, when at break of
day I weighed and stood out of Western Port, passing to the
westward of the Seal Islands, and found a large passage, capable
of any vessel beating into it; care, however, should be taken to
give the westernmost head a wide berth to avoid some heavy
breakers, which appear a mile from it, even in good weather, and
as I apprehended extended still further. The following Remarks
made on the very spot will be found useful to future navigators;
for though in the day-time a seaman's eye will guide and direct,
yet too many particulars cannot be known respecting any harbour,
however well he may be acquainted with it.</p>
<p>On entering this harbour, the easternmost shore, or right hand
side, giving the Seal Islands a berth of three quarters of a
mile, unless a preference is given to going between Seal and
Snapper Islands, which was the passage by which the Lady Nelson
entered. The former passage is the principal entrance into the
harbour, and with the before-mentioned offing from the islands,
and a N.E. half E. course by compass, will carry a vessel up to
Elizabeth's Cove or Bay, when a berth may be chosen, as
circumstances may make it convenient. Our course out was S.W.
half W. by compass, which carried us clear of every thing, with a
strong flood-tide running against us. Attention should be paid,
at all times, to the tide, which flows thirty-five minutes past
twelve on the full and change, according to the best calculation
we could make in the middle stream, and along such shores as did
not wind, for where they do there will be found a variation,
which nothing but mere experience can ascertain. I have already
observed, that the eastern shore is the clearest and ought always
to be kept on board, as on the western side there are long sand
flats, on which the sea breaks in general with much force to a
great distance up the harbour. This caution ought to be
particularly attended to in foggy weather, as from 14 to 12
fathoms water will be found very near them. When I left
Margaret's Island, I let go my anchor in 12 fathoms water, and it
being dark saw no shoal; but, from the motion of the vessel, I
suspected something of the kind, and in the morning discovered a
shoal within less than a cable's length of us, and the sand
turning up when the sea broke, as it does on the Goodwin Sands at
the time of flood. It being gloomy and wet when I entered the
harbour, I did not see these shoals, but ran by the lead, as I
could depend on the vessel staying. These shoals extend along the
west side from nearly opposite the Seal Islands, till coming
abreast of Elizabeth's Cove, where they fall in with the western
shore.</p>
<p>In hazy thick weather, or in the night, after having passed
the Seal Islands, which are an excellent mark, I would recommend
going into no greater depth, in standing over from the eastern
shore to its opposite, than 10 or 12 fathoms water, as 14 will be
found very near to the flats. On the east side nothing of the
kind is to be apprehended, it will be only necessary to give
those points a berth that appear rocky, as some of them run out
from the shore two or three cables' length, between these points
the beach will generally be found sandy, and a vessel may stand
in five fathoms water without danger.</p>
<p>I need not enlarge upon the explanation here given, as there
is no doubt but the Chart of this place, which is in the hands of
Government, will appear in due time; I shall therefore only
observe, that Western Port is capable of containing several
hundred sail of ships with perfect security from storms, and will
admit of being fortified. It is a convenient harbour for going in
and coming out, at all times, is situated in a country which may
easily be improved by cultivation, and in an excellent climate.
This harbour will be found useful to vessels coming through the
Straits, a passage which, no doubt, will in time, be generally
pursued (preferably to rounding Tassman's Head,) by ships in
their passage from England, or from the Cape of Good Hope to Port
Jackson. And I do not see but this is an eligible passage, at
certain seasons of the year, for vessels bound from Sydney to
India, and perhaps at all times more so, than passing through the
labyrinth of unknown Islands, in making the northern passage from
Port Jackson to India. In respect to making the passage to the
Cape of Good Hope, direct from Sydney, without going round Cape
Horn, a course always taken, I consider it so far practicable
that it only wants the trial to prove it so. It was once
attempted by some vessel to get round by Tassman's Head, but
owing to the strong southerly winds it could not be done, and
they bore up round Cape Horn. That point of Dieman's Land was
then judged to be the southernmost point of New Holland, and from
its lying in so high a latitude, the south and west winds were
found commonly to blow very strong, which prevented vessels from
weathering it, and deterred others from the attempt. But it being
now ascertained, that the southernmost point of New Holland
barely exceeds the 39th degree of S. latitude, and that it has
been rounded from the eastward at different times, it follows,
that there is so great a scope between the western side of the
Straits and Nuytsland, or King George the Third's Harbour, that
if vessels could lay a W. by N. or even a W.N.W. course they
could nearly clear it. In my passage out, after having got into
the parallels of 38&deg; and 39&deg; S. I had much wind from the
N. and some from the E. therefore should vessels get into the
parallel of 36&deg;, it is most likely they will find variable
winds, though generally prevailing from the S.</p>
<p>This idea of weathering the land, or western shoulder of New
Holland, appeared to me to be so easy, that I made an offer of my
service in conducting the Norfolk brig through those Straits to
the Cape of Good Hope, in preference to carrying her round Cape
Horn. This offer I made to Governor King before my departure for
England, on hearing of his intention to send this vessel to the
Cape, but, after some delay, I was obliged to shift for myself,
as he declined the offer.</p>
<p>Time will shew what will be the advantage of this discovery;
in the meanwhile the knowledge of a safe and commodious port in
the Strait, that may be run into at pleasure, cannot but be
useful to vessels bound from England and the Cape, as it often
happens, that after they round Van Dieman's Land, they meet with
easterly winds, accompanied with heavy weather, in all seasons of
the year. Should they be inclined to keep the sea, it will be of
consequence to merchant ships, as they then will shorten their
passage. It may seem somewhat extraordinary that so fine a bay as
Jarvis's Bay (as I have had occasion to mention) should have been
hitherto no further observed than by receiving a name. It
certainly merits being completely surveyed, and laid down, so
that vessels in proceeding up to Port Jackson, and meeting with
contrary winds, might run into it without fear. Port Stephens,
likewise to the northward of Sydney, is but very little known on
our Charts, and though less easy of access, and smaller in
magnitude, it has, nevertheless, great advantages attending it,
especially with vessels forced past Port Jackson, and under the
necessity of buffeting the weather until it proves more
favourable. I am confident an enterprising man would find his
account in obtaining surveys of these ports.</p>
<p>But to return to the Straits: we proceeded to make a survey of
the coast from Western Point to the Southern Point of New
Holland, named by Mr. Bass, Wilson's Promontory, which we
obtained for a distance of 70 miles. The weather was unsettled,
winter being now far advanced, and I found little more was to be
done in the way of survey. The wet was prejudicial to the
instruments, the suddenness of the gales prevented us from
keeping constantly as near the shore as was necessary; and, in
short, I was fully convinced that winter is a very improper
season for making surveys of an unknown coast: I therefore
resolved to make the best of my way for Sydney.</p>
<p>Being close off the Promontory, we found behind the southern
point of it, a little to the eastward, three small sandy beaches,
the middle one forming a little bay, which a small craft might
anchor in, should she meet with northerly or westerly winds. But
as the Promontory is entirely open to the south, if vessels can
get round it, they will find better shelter under Cape Liptrap,
which affords a good one from easterly winds, as well as from the
northward. As we ran in sufficiently far to see the whole extent,
we found the bottom of the Bight a fine sandy beach with some
hummocks on it. I therefore imagine vessels bound from Western
Point and its vicinity to Sydney will find it useful, when
meeting with strong winds from the eastward. This place, I had,
in the passage out, named King George's Sound, but I scarcely
think it deserves the appellation.</p>
<p>Having bore up, after dark, to the eastward of the Promontory,
I ordered the shore to be kept on board, in order to observe any
particular that might occur. In the night we were warned of the
ground by the keel's lifting up, from the danger of which, after
heaving them up, and hauling the vessel close off on a wind, we
were presently relieved. This place was full of sand shoals, some
of which the native Euranabie pointed out to me that were
breaking; near, there appears to be a small inlet, which had
received the name of Shoal Inlet from Mr. Bass. And here is
another proof which I had of the very great utility of the
sliding keel; for it is more than probable that the shoals would
have brought us up in a situation more difficult to have
extricated ourselves from than the spot where we touched. I would
recommend keeping on the outside of four small islands lying
together, which will be seen, after passing the Promontory, and
to which, on my passage out, I had given the name of Moncur's
Island, not suspecting a cluster of islands was there.</p>
<p>On the 4th May we were in sight of Cape Dromedary, bearing at
noon S.W. half S. distant 16 or 17 miles. We had now much
variable, wet, and squally weather, and after having the next day
at noon got an observation in 34&deg; 40' S. there came on a
stout gale from the N. and E. which on the 6th had driven us back
into lat. 36&deg; 8' S. Cape Dromedary then bearing E. by S.
seven or eight miles. From every allowance I could possibly make,
I found the current had, at least, set us fifty miles back to the
southward. I think it necessary to mention this circumstance, as
I judge the current has no particular course along the coast; but
most probably changes with the wind. On my passage out I found a
strong drift from the southward along the coast towards the
north; and I know some have imagined the current running against
the wind, raises that short heavy swell found along the coast of
New Holland, but except that particular fact, I have not any
further proof to offer upon this head. When abreast the mouth of
the Straits, we found that commotion in the sea, which led first
to a conjecture that there was an opening in the land from east
to west. Governor Hunter, in his printed Journal, pages 124 and
125, observes upon the probability of such an opening between the
latitudes 39&deg; and 42&deg; S. That gentleman, therefore, was
the first who ever suggested such an idea, and, no doubt,
encouraged the search for it, which the enterprising spirit of
Mr. Bass, before-mentioned, effected, giving his own name very
deservedly and justly to the Strait. Through a succession of bad
weather, and after being obliged to put into Botany Bay for
twenty-four hours, we arrived at Port Jackson on the 14th May,
1801.</p>
<p>I had not, from the time of my departure, a sick man among my
ship's company, one man only excepted, whose skull had been
fractured. He found himself somewhat ill, from the fatigue and
constant wet weather we experienced during the voyage, but
recovered soon after we came in, without any assistance from
medicine. The unfavourableness of the weather prevented me from
completing the whole of my instructions; but I had the
satisfaction whilst in Botany Bay to learn, by a letter from
Governor King, that he was well pleased with what I had done.</p>
<p>The Lady Nelson was now ordered to receive on board
Lieutenant-Governor Colonel Paterson, and convey him to Hunter's
River, which, from the abundance of coals found on its banks, has
obtained the name of Coal River. The object of this voyage was to
make a survey of the river, to gain a knowledge of its natural
productions, and whatever else might appear worthy of
observation. Having all things in readiness, we set sail on the
10th of June, with the Frances schooner, which latter vessel was
to be loaded with coals. With Colonel Paterson, we received on
board Dr. Harris, Surgeon of the New South Wales Corps, Ensign
Barreillier (the Surveyor), and a number of workmen and
labourers, for the purpose of cutting and sawing timber, digging
and loading coals, and other necessary works. With us likewise
went one of the natives, named Bangaree. At the mouth of the
harbour we fell in with the ship Cornwallis, having convicts on
board from England; and on the 11th at noon we had an observation
in the lat. 33&deg; 35' S. the north head of Broken Bay bearing
W. by S. distance 10 or 12 miles.</p>
<p>On the next day the weather was variable, and having had a
person sent on board as a pilot, who had lately sailed from
Sydney to the river for coals, I thought I could rely on his
knowledge of the place, but herein I proved to be mistaken. He
was near entering a wrong place, being deceived by the appearance
of an island,* Hunter's, or Coal River, having one at its
entrance; and as we had passed a place called Reid's Mistake
(which lays to the northward of Broken Bay, and having an island
before it, had deceived a man of that name for the entrance of
Hunter's River), I thought this man, officially sent as a pilot,
might be right. I had taken an observation, and did not find the
latitude agree with that given me for Hunter's River, but our
pilot supposed himself there, and was not convinced of his error
till we got within half a mile of the island. As we were in 17
fathoms water, and the weather was fair, I got my boat out, and
Dr. Harris went on shore to reconnoitre the place. In the
meantime I brought up with the kedge, and set my people to
fishing, who caught a number of snappers and other fish. On Dr.
Harris's return, he brought with him a native, who, on seeing the
boat had run down to it, crying out several times, <i>Whale
Boat!</i> and <i>Budgerie Dick!</i> or <i>Good Dick</i>,&mdash;a
name we supposed had been given him by the people sent in search
of those who ran away with the Norfolk, as before mentioned. This
man had some fish with him, which he threw into the boat first,
and then jumped into it himself, without the least hesitation.
The report which Dr. Harris made on board was, that not the least
appearance of any river was to be discerned; but the sea broke
very heavily in an inlet behind the island.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Plate shews the entrance of the River,
with the Lady Nelson and the Frances schooner going up it.]</p>
<p>Our new acquaintance Dick, as soon as he got on board,
continued his cries of <i>Whale Boat!</i> and in order to
discover what he meant by them, I introduced him to Bangaree,
with directions to the latter to question him on the subject.
Bangaree pointed to him to sit down, which, I have observed
before, implied that a stranger was received with friendship. It
was in vain for me to desire Bangaree to proceed in his
enquiries, there was another etiquette, which could not be
omitted, and this was a continuance in profound silence. This
lasted for about twenty minutes, at the expiration of which time
they by degrees entered into discourse, drawing nearer to each
other, as they began to talk. We received, however, little
information from Dick, whether it was that Bangaree did not well
understand him; and I am inclined to think so, for some of our
people, who were best acquainted with the language spoken by the
natives round Sydney, were at the same loss.</p>

<small>The Lady Nelson &amp; Francis Schooner entering Hunters or
Coal River.</small></p>
<br>
<p>We got under weigh about three P.M. and at five saw another
high perpendicular island, bearing N. eight or nine miles, which
we took for the real entrance. In the morning we were well in
with it; and at half past ten A.M. I went in the boat with Dr.
Harris, in order to discover whether this was the place that we
looked for. We found the entrance very narrow, with a reef on one
side, and a very heavy surf breaking on it. On the other side
were some heavy sand breakers, and the passage in very much
troubled, and all but breaking. Finding this to be the case, I at
one time put the boat's head round to the swell, and pulled out;
but the risk of bringing in the two vessels, without exactly
ascertaining the channel, made me determine to attempt it, and
accordingly we pulled through, and carried from five to four and
three and half fathoms with us close to the island. It was then
just on the pitch of high water when we landed on the island, up
the steep side of which, near the entrance, we clambered till we
reached the top. This side is covered with grass, but the others
are perpendicular, in a crumbling state, and falling by degrees
into the sea. On the summit is a beautiful view of the river,
interspersed with islands, and extending as far as the eye can
reach. Here I hoisted an Union Jack, as a signal to the vessel
that this was the right entrance of the River we were in search
of. I must remark, that this island is well calculated for
defending the River's entrance, and a proper place for erecting a
signal tower or light-house. Between the island and the main
there is an opening of about three cables' length, which is full
of rocks, with a heavy surf breaking over them, the effects of
which are felt from side to side of the river. On this side,
therefore, it would be dangerous to attempt a passage with a
vessel, since, should there be any channel found, it must
necessarily be narrow and crooked; vessels then must go round the
island in entering, as it appears by the Plate, the Lady Nelson
and Frances schooner are doing. Opposite to this chasm the
different strata of coals are discovered, exhibiting a
checkered-like appearance. It should seem that this separation
from the main has been produced by some violent convulsion of
nature. The rocks, from the disposition in which they now stand,
and the strata of coals on the island, shew the connection which
once subsisted between the main land and it. The Colony of New
South Wales cannot fail of reaping great advantage from a mine of
coals so near to it, and so easy to be worked.</p>
<p>We returned on board the vessel, and set about towing and
sweeping her in with all possible dispatch. At noon the latitude
was, by observation, 32&deg; 57' 54" S. the island, which we
named Coal Island, bearing W.N.W. distant three or four miles. I
compute the true latitude of the island to be 32&deg; 55' S.</p>
<p>By the time we approached the entrance the ebb had set strong
out, and ran with much force; however, by dint of warping, we
brought up under the island for the night in three and a half
fathoms water, within pistol-shot of the shore. At day-light we
proceeded up to a saw-pit made for the purpose of cutting cedar,
which is growing in abundance on the banks of that river, of a
large size, and excellent quality, and came to abreast of it in
three fathoms water, steadying the vessel by a hawser made fast
to a tree on shore. The harbour is of several miles extent, and
capable of containing many sail of shipping, and is well
sheltered from every wind that blows.</p>

<br>
<small>Where the Lady Nelson first Anchored in Hunters or Coal
River.</small></p>
<br>
<p>We immediately set about making the different arrangements for
completing the object of our voyage. The Colonel and I went on
shore to examine the different strata of coals, taking with us a
miner, who pointed them out to us very distinctly, and we found
them running from side to side of the mountain of various
qualities and degrees of thickness. At low water, coals proper
for fuel were to be gathered up from the reef before mentioned;
and when the tide was up, we could work a pier. Accordingly,
having orders to load the schooner with all expedition with coals
and wood, I had the satisfaction to see her sail with a cargo of
both on the 26th of June, eleven days after her arrival.</p>
<p>It may be imagined that coals were found in great plenty, when
I mention that the schooner sailed with forty tons of coals on
board, and that we had only one man employed to dig the mine. The
spot where these coals are found is clear of tree or bush for the
space of many acres, which are covered with a short tender grass,
very proper for grazing sheep, the ground rising with a gradual
ascent, intersected with vallies, on which wood grows in plenty,
sheltered from the winds, forming the most delightful prospects.
This place might serve as a station for the wood cutters and
colliers; it affords pasture for sheep, its soil in general being
good, though on the whole not so rich as on Western Port. Dr.
Harris and Mr. Barreillier penetrated to some distance inland:
they saw many kangaroos, and met with a native, who followed them
some time, and then left them.</p>
<p>Our native Dick, already mentioned, thought proper to leave us
in an excursion we made with him into the country. Colonel
Paterson discovered some copper and iron ores, the latter
strongly impregnated and rich in metal. The seine was hauled, and
plenty of excellent fish caught, particularly the mullet, with a
fish much resembling the herring, which I am inclined to think,
like them, go in shoals. On an island in the harbour a tree is
found in great plenty, the quality of whose timber much resembles
that of the ash; and from the great numbers of them growing
there, has given name to the island. Of this timber I had
received orders to send a quantity to Sydney, and had brought out
sawyers for that purpose; but as every object could not be at
once accomplished, they were employed, in the mean time, in
cutting down and sawing into planks, a tree, the bark of which is
much like cork. The timber of this tree is light, close and
durable, and promises to stand against the effects of worms on
the bottoms of vessels. I had a boat built of this wood, which
proved it to be good for such uses. This wood has much the
resemblance of what is called wainscot with us. Mr. Barreillier's
survey was all this time going on. Nearly abreast of the vessel
was a Creek, which Colonel Paterson and I penetrated for a
considerable way up. On its banks we found part of a net, made of
strong grass, apparently the work of an European. We likewise
found marks of fires having been lighted there; and in the stream
the remains of a weir, the work of the native inhabitants, this
being one of their principal devices for taking fish. We
concluded the net had belonged to the unfortunate men who ran
away with the Norfolk sloop, as mentioned before, it therefore
became necessary to caution our out-parties against a surprize
either from them or the New Hollanders.</p>
<p>On examining Ash Island, we found many large timber trees
intermixed with the ash, one of which I took on board as a
specimen, which has much the likeness of hickery, and may be
applicable to many of the purposes that wood is used for. I found
several other woods, some of them light and pretty; and, in
particular, a tree, the leaves of which sting like nettles: this
acquired from us the name of the Nettle Tree. The native Dick now
made his appearance with two of his companions, after an absence
of eight and forty hours. One of these had been at Sydney, and
was known to Colonel Paterson, by which means a kind of
conversation was kept up. The fires of the natives and many
individuals of them were to be seen on the side of the harbour
opposite to Ash Island. We went up an arm of the river, in order
to reach the place where they were; but after crossing the
harbour, were disappointed in the design. We found the harbour
here full of flats and shoals, over many of which we were under
the necessity of draging the boat by main strength. Here we found
trees incrusted with oysters, and the shore covered to a great
depth with oyster-shells, from which lime might be made on the
spot, should it at any time be required for the purposes of
building. We daily hauled the seine, and often took mullets of a
very large size. Our several works went vigorously on, and now it
was that a party was sent to work on Ash Island in felling and
sawing that timber. These took with them a week's provision, with
arms and ammunition. Their orders were to be on the watch against
any surprize, either from the Norfolk crew or the natives; and in
their intercourse with the latter to conduct themselves with
prudence and moderation, and by no means to provoke an attack
from them.</p>
<p>I visited the coal mine in company of Colonel Paterson, and we
were shewn by the miner several veins, which he had discovered,
of a most excellent quality. Amongst the rocks we found plenty of
what is called liver of iron. Here were a variety of birds to be
seen, and the wild cat, of which animal, the men working the
coals had taken some. They seemed to partake more of the nature
of the stoat or weasel, like that animal sucking the blood of
every thing they caught, and preying chiefly in the
night-time.</p>
<p>On the 22d, Colonel Paterson went, attended by a party and the
miner, to make an examination of the island. At the same time,
Mr. Barreillier, Dr. Harris and myself, sounded the entrance of
the harbour. The coal found on the island appeared to be of an
inferior kind, called by the colliers chilters. It had been the
intention to load the coals here, from the supposition that they
were easier got at: however, the inferiority of the coals turned
the scale in favour of the place where the Frances took in her
cargo, and where vessels could lie in perfect security.</p>
<p>An object now presented itself to our view, which exhibited
the completest picture of wretchedness I ever beheld. This was a
man wrecked in a boat belonging to Sydney, with two other men,
both of whom were dead; one of them by the hands of the natives,
the other by eating greedily of the toad-fish, the prickly bones
of which had choaked him. The poor wretch before us shed a flood
of tears, and declared he was nearly starved to death, as he had
subsisted for thirty-two days on what he could pick up along
shore. It was fortunate for him he found us here, as he must
inevitably have perished before he could have reached Sydney. I
had him taken on board the vessel, fed with caution, and duly
attended to, and in a few days had the satisfaction to ship him
on board the Frances for Sydney, quite recovered.</p>
<p>On the 23d, Mr. Barreillier and the second mate went on shore,
and in the woods met with a native, whom they conducted on board
the vessel. He was an elderly man, of the class termed here, Bush
Natives, who arc considered as an inferior tribe by the
inhabitants of the sea coast. This man's legs and arms bore no
proportion in length to the rest of his body, and his manner of
ascending this ship's ladder was remarkable, and plainly proved
he was much accustomed to climbing. His method was to stretch out
his arms as far as he could reach, and then bring his feet to the
same place with a jerk. His language was unintelligible to all on
board, and the sounds he uttered strangely dissonant and uncouth,
having, however, something plaintive, but without the least
similitude to speech. He had the whole of his front teeth
perfect, contrary to the usage of the other natives of New
Holland, who cause one of the <i>incisors</i> of the upper jaw to
be eradicated at an early period of their lives. Of this custom,
Mr. Collins has given a particular account in his work, relating
to the manners and customs of the New Hollanders. This man could
by no means be persuaded to eat or drink with us. I offered him
sugar, supposing, as the Bush Natives live much on wild honey, it
might prove acceptable. I was on the point of putting him on
shore, as he seemed so averse to partake of our food, and was
otherwise so far from docility, when he espied a crow of the
carrion species, which one of my people had shot: this he seemed
to express a longing desire for, and on its being presented to
him, he went with it to the galley fire, and heating it a little,
devoured it greedily, entrails and all. On his going on shore,
Colonel Paterson gave him a tomahawk, which he took, and appeared
to know readily how to use it; however, he did not seem to have
any name to give it, which was what we endeavoured to make him
express; but placing it under his arm went off with it. The crew
of the boat, in which he was conveyed on shore, willing to have a
proof of his dexterity in the use of his new acquisition, pointed
at a tree, as if they wished to see him climb it. He readily
understood them, and making a notch in the tree with his
instrument, placed his foot into it, continuing the same
practice; thus he very nimbly ascended to the top, though the
tree was of a great thickness, and without branches that could
assist him in the ascent to the height of forty feet. From this
tree he removed to another, by which he descended, and passing
hastily through the bushes, was soon out of their sight. The
natives have hatchets of their own, formed with sharp stones, and
which they use for the same purpose, and I have indeed remarked
that many of the trees are notched. Colonel Paterson, whose long
residence in New Holland, and curiosity of observation, has
enabled him to decide upon questions of this nature, declared
that he never met with a native who differed so widely from the
rest of the New Hollanders. It will probably appear to my
Readers, that we have as yet but an imperfect knowledge of the
natural productions of the neighbourhood of Sydney, and of its
aboriginal inhabitants. This man appeared in a state of perfect
nakedness, and was without the mark of the ornament described by
Colonel Collins, of a stick thrust through the cartilage of the
nose, of which he bore no mark. As there is thought to be a chain
in Creation, beginning with the Brute and ending with Man, were I
inclined to pursue the notion, I should be at a loss where to
place my Bush Native, whether as the next link above the monkey,
or that below it.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned the Frances having been dispatched
with a lading of coals and timber for Sydney, on the 26th: she
had on board a quantity of ash sawed out in proper lengths for
making oars, which, from the trial we had made, it appeared to be
better adapted for than the pine of Norfolk Island. This latter
wood, though lighter, being very brittle, so that oars made of it
are often broken short off. The ash cut on Ash Island is not,
indeed, so light as English ash, but it must be considered as a
valuable acquisition in a country where the greatest part of the
timber, hitherto discovered, is of that heavy nature as to sink
in water.</p>
<p>About this time I was joined by a party which had been sent
several miles up the river in order to cut cedar for Mr.
Commissary Palmer. These men, finding their stock of provisions
running short, had set off with an intention of reaching Sydney
by land, but seeing our vessel from the heights, they changed
their resolution and came to us. They were nine in number, and
made no little addition to those under my command; two of them
were sick, and these I sent to Sydney on board the schooner, and
would have ordered the rest to have made their passage by the
same conveyance, but not being able to spare a guard with them, I
did not think it safe, as they had discovered evident marks of a
depraved and irregular disposition, from the time their stomachs
were filled.</p>
<p>I now sent my carpenter and some hands on shore to build a
large commodious but for the use of the colliers, whose labour
went on briskly. Birds of various kinds were daily brought in,
many of which were new to us, and among the rest a species of
cuckow. This bird is larger than that of Britain; its feathers
are a mixture of light brown and grey. We saw many of the hawk
kind, and one in particular, commonly seen about the coast, which
preys on fish. The goat sucker and snipe are likewise found here:
of four-footed animals there was no plenty-the opossum, the
flying-squirrel, the cat, and some others were all we saw. Fish
was taken in great quantities, and of various kinds, particularly
mullets, which were large and well flavoured. We caught also a
species of jew fish, one of which weighed 56 pounds, and proved
excellent eating. From the numbers of this fish, which escaped
from the seine, I am inclined to think there is great plenty in
this river.</p>
<p>On the 28th of June we proceeded further up the river, and
moored in one of the branches about six miles from the entrance,
where we lay securely sheltered from every wind that could blow.
During this time, Mr. Barreillier was employed on his survey.
Colonel Paterson, Dr. Harris, and Mr. Lewin, an ingenious
draughtsman of subjects of natural history, who had joined me on
the departure of the Frances schooner, went with a party up the
river several miles to examine its course, and inspect the
country. I found the woods here to abound with trees affording a
light timber, and great quantities of the cabbage tree, some of
which last I felled to try the eatable quality of it. I found
this vegetable better in its natural state fresh cut than when
boiled, it appearing to me that it was rendered unpalatable by
cooking.</p>
<p>On the 4th of July the launch returned, dispatched with a
letter from Colonel Paterson, dated from Schank's Forest, Pasture
Plains, the name he had given to the spot which he had then made
his quarters, at the distance of forty miles from the vessel. On
the 7th I set off to join him, with a necessary supply of
provisions, accompanied by Mr. Barreillier. The day we set out on
proved to be very wet, so that when we pitched our tents at
night, we found the greatest difficulty in lighting a fire. As
soon as it was day-light we proceeded on our passage up the
river, and found the country on both sides for the most part
level and swampy near the river, but with distant views which
were delightfully pleasant. The river made a very serpentine
course, and for many miles up appeared to be as broad as the
Thames at Kingston. From the marks left on the trees it should
seem, that it is subject to be greatly overflowed at times, the
cedar (or rather the mahogany of New Holland) growing near the
river, appeared to have been immersed in water to the height of
40 or 50 feet. I am inclined to think that these floods must
proceed from lakes in the vicinity of the mountains; the banks,
though high in many places to a considerable distance, having the
appearance of being overflowed.</p>
<p>On our way up we landed at a small Creek, which we traced for
a considerable distance, coming to a gradual ascent, covered with
the most luxuriant grass. Towards the land there was an extensive
view from this height, of a fine champain country, sufficiently
secure from the inundations of the river. This spot I think
worthy of notice, as it might be made a convenient settlement. I
named the eminence Mount Egerton, after a seat belonging to the
Duke of Bridgewater, then living, of the same name. In the
evening we found, by the sound of the bugle-horn, that we had
reached the neighbourhood of the Colonel's head-quarters. We
answered the welcome signal with the same instrument from our
boat, and before it was quite dark we joined them.</p>
<p>The Colonel had erected a comfortable hut, and had been
successful in killing a number of new and beautiful birds. The
cedar grew here in great plenty, and to a very large size. Mr.
Palmer's party had sawed many fine planks from these trees.
Colonel Paterson, Dr. Harris, Mr. Barreillier, and myself,
penetrated to the distance of thirty miles further up the river,
in the course of which we met with many rapids, which obliged us
to get out and drag the boats up. We had hitherto seen none of
the natives, but discovered places where they had been, by the
marks of their fires. We now descried some of them at a distance,
who fled on our approach. We came to a spot which they had just
quitted, and observed the marks of children's feet. The ground
was covered with the shells of fresh water fish, of the sort
found in the rivers of England and Scotland, and called the horse
muscle, having sometimes small pearls in them.</p>
<p>We ascended two heights, which commanded views of the country
for several miles on every side. To one of them Colonel Paterson
gave the name of Ann's Mountain, after Mrs. King; the other he
called Elizabeth's Mountain, that being the Christian name of
Mrs. Paterson. We now found that we had got behind the range of
mountains extending along the coast to the south and west. We
likewise saw the coast of Port Stephens, and the chain of hills
inland stretching in a direction towards the north-east. Between
us and the hills was a space perfectly level for many miles,
covered with trees and underwood, and to appearance swampy. The
land on the south side of the river was interspersed with
lagoons, on which we killed some ducks, but found them very shy.
The country seemed not to be destitute of inhabitants, some of
whom we descried at a distance. The river here meandered so
greatly, that to have pursued its course the boats must have been
pulled a whole day to have gained a direct distance of four or
five miles from our present station. The time, therefore, limited
for our departure for Sydney approaching very fast, and the
survey still to be made not being less than seventy miles up the
river, it was judged prudent not to proceed any further.</p>
<p>Passing the night upon the banks of the river, we descended it
the next day to our former rendezvous, Schank Forest, Pasture
Plains, where preparations were made for a general
embarkation.</p>
<p>The next morning, I left Colonel Paterson in company of Mr.
Barreillier, who then proceeded on the survey of the river. On
our passage down it, we saw several natives with their canoes. As
we passed the canoes we left some biscuits in them. In many of
them we saw fires, and in some of them observed that kind of
eatable to which they give the name of cabra: it appears to be
abominably filthy, however when dressed it is not disagreeable to
the taste. The cabra is a species of worm which breeds in the
wood that happens to be immersed in water, and are found in such
parts of the river wherein trees have fallen. Indeed, I have
found no place I have ever visited, where this destructive worm
makes greater ravages, either in salt or fresh water. They grow
to a great size, and soon reduce timber to the appearance of a
honeycomb. They are of a glutinous substance, and after being put
on the fire, harden to the consistence of the spinal marrow of
animals. When fire is not at hand, the natives eat them raw: some
of them being found at a fire near one of the canoes, I tasted
them on the recommendation of one of my men, and found them not
unpalatable; so that hunger providing the sauce, they may be
considered as no bad apology for a better meal. It must, however,
be acknowledged, that the New Hollander feeds most filthily.</p>
<p>We saw several of the natives at a small distance, one of whom
looked earnestly at us, and seemed to be waiting our approach.
One of my men called to him in his own language to stop, which he
appeared well inclined to do, but at length he got behind a tree,
from whence he presented only his head and shoulders, brandishing
a fish-gig in his hand. He waited our landing, and seeing we were
unarmed, he threw down his <i>muton</i>, so they name the
fish-gig, and came readily to us. For what reason I know not,
(for we appeared without any marks of distinction) he addressed
himself first to me, and taking from his forehead a small net,
which their women weave from the fur of the opossum, he bound it
round mine. In my turn I took out my pocket-handkerchief, and
bound it round his head, which pleased him much, and we became
from that moment the best of friends. I invited him on board the
boat, and he readily accepted my invitation. When on board he was
called to from the woods on the opposite shore by a number of
voices, which surprized us a little, as we did not expect they
were in such numbers. My new acquaintance called out in his turn
to those on shore, and their cries immediately ceased. I have
reason to think, they made enquiry, whether he apprehended any
danger from us, and that he assured them he had nothing to fear,
which quieted their alarm and made them easy.</p>
<p>Proceeding further we saw a flock of ducks, and I ordered one
of the people to fire, which he did, and was lucky enough to kill
two. Never did I witness stronger marks of surprize than were
depicted on the stranger's countenance, when he heard the report
of the gun, and saw the two ducks fall into the water. His
astonishment was increased when he got on board the vessel; every
thing he beheld seemed to fill him with wonder and amazement.
During the time he stayed on board, he never quitted my side, and
at the hour of rest he laid himself down near my bed place. I
presented him with a small tomahawk, which pleased him very much,
and he pronounced, with much earnestness the word, by which I
then understood they call a hatchet <i>mogo</i>. He readily ate
of whatever was set before him, but refused salt and mustard;
spirits he would not touch, but sugar he took freely. He
endeavoured to repeat our words after us; and, upon the whole,
was infinitely more tractable than the native last described. He
was an elderly man, short in stature, but well made: his arms and
legs were long in proportion to his body, which was slender and
straight. Having occasion to dispatch the first mate in a boat to
Colonel Paterson, I took that opportunity of sending off my New
Hollander, with directions that he should be landed on the
precise spot from whence he was taken, which was accordingly
done.</p>
<p>When the first mate was returning, he was surprized to find
his passenger of the day before on the banks, who begged to be
permitted to return to the vessel with him: he had a young lad
with him, whom he desired might accompany him, and they were both
brought on board. This lad appeared to be about 17 years of age;
his arms, legs and thighs were remarkably long: he made me
understand that he wished to have a <i>mogo</i>, and I soon found
that I could not make a more acceptable present to a native of
New Holland. Mr. Lewin, the draughtsman of natural history,
before mentioned, sketched out the portraits of these two, and I
was promised a copy of this design, but was never able to procure
either copy or original. Our old and new acquaintance passed one
day with us on board, after which they were both landed near the
spot where they had been first seen. They were perfectly naked,
and exceedingly well pleased when they understood that their
likenesses were about to be taken, for which purpose they
submitted themselves to be placed in any attitude that was
thought proper. It is observable, that all the New Hollanders are
proud of being noticed in the same manner.</p>
<p>On the 19th we were rejoined by Colonel Paterson, with the
whole of his party. The Colonel had explored a branch of the
river, on the banks of which he found a species of flax growing,
which he thought was valuable. He had collected specimens of many
rare and uncommon plants, particularly some varieties of the fern
tribe; but, unfortunately, was in one moment deprived of the
fruits of his skill and industry. His servant had made use of the
bundle of plants as a pillow, and having heedlessly placed it too
near the fire, it was soon in a blaze, and he was awaked only
time enough to save his face from being scorched by the flames.
The Colonel possesses a general knowledge of botany, and every
branch of natural history. His politeness and attention to make
every thing agreeable to me, during the short voyage we made
together, demand the tribute of my acknowledgement and
thanks.</p>
<p>We were now growing short of provisions, and no vessel
arriving from Sydney, we set about making preparations for our
return thither. There was now a small establishment made for the
colliers: I had built them a convenient but to shelter them; I
left them a boat and seine, with what provisions I was able to
spare, besides arms, ammunition and tools. We took our departure
for Sydney on the 22d of July, 1801, and arrived there on the
25th following, having met with nothing worth recording during
this passage of three days.</p>

<h3>[CHAPTER V.<br>
<br>
<a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a><i>General Observations on New
South Wales</i>]</h3>
<br>
<p>I now proceed to lay before my readers such cursory
observations as I have been able to make with respect to this
flourishing Colony, and its aboriginal Inhabitants.</p>
<p>New South Wales is now known to be separated from Van Dieman's
Land by a Strait, as has been fully ascertained in the Voyage
related in the foregoing sheets, the Lady Nelson being the first
vessel that ever entered these Straits from Europe, and passed
through them to Port Jackson.</p>
<p>New Holland, which comprehends New South Wales, is an island
of very large extent, lying between 10 and 39 degrees, nearly, of
southern latitude. From its vast extent its climate is various,
and future settlers will be able to make their choice. It may be
presumed capable of producing whatever is raised [i]n the same
degrees of northern latitude, which will include silk, wine, oil,
fruits, grain, &amp;c. It has a number of safe and capacious
harbours. The horned cattle which had strayed into the woods are
now greatly multiplied; and it is matter of regret that swine
have not strayed in the same manner, as it is probable, from the
prolific nature of that animal, the breed of wild hogs would by
this time have been considerable. Sheep are found to succeed
well; and the specimens of yarn spun from their wool, and brought
over here, have been much approved of. The breed of horses is
good, and the encrease of that useful animal is great. Materials
proper for the purposes of dyeing are plentiful, and fustick is
now cut in Hunter's River. Iron is found in the neighbourhood of
Sydney, and in other parts. The salutary effects of the air of
New South Wales is perceptible in that part of the dwellers
brought over in banishment: these are observed to become, in a
short time, stout and healthy, and their offspring vigorous and
promising. The small-pox, that dreadful scourge of the human
race, which has proved so fatal at the Cape of Good Hope, and
other Settlements, has been hitherto unknown in New South Wales,
for which reason inoculation has never been practised here: when
vaccination is introduced, it will effectually remove all
apprehensions of the disease in future. I have mentioned marks
like those remaining after the smallpox have been observed upon
some of the natives; and it is certain they are subject to a
disorder which has the like symptoms. It is, morever, remarkable
that this disorder is known amongst them by a different name from
that they give to all other eruptions on the skin. One of the
natives was taken into the Hospital with this disease upon him,
which though not caught by any European, infected an African
negroe who died of it.</p>
<p>In speaking of the New Hollanders, I should be under the
necessity of gleaning after Colonel Collins, as that Gentleman
has given the fullest and most accurate account of their manners
and customs; I shall therefore confine my observations on these
natives, as far as they agree in their habits and manners with
other Savage Nations.</p>
<p>The native of New Holland is found in the genuine state of
nature; he goes perfectly naked in winter as well as summer. His
wants, being those of all the animal creation, are easily
supplied; these are, food and rest: the former is supplied to him
by the elements of earth, air, and water, the latter he finds
when and wheresoever he chuses to seek it. That labour which is
so necessary to procure him food, together with its simplicity,
contributes to the enjoyment of the soundest and most refreshing
rest at the hour he is inclined to take it. He has then only to
seek for the longest and driest grass, and the tree that affords
the most shelter. This when he is ranging the woods alone; but
when he is with his horde, he stretches himself at ease before a
blazing fire, and is protected from the storm which is howling
over his head in a wigwam, or slight hut, raised with a few
branches.</p>
<p>Such being the uniform course of his life from day to day, and
from year to year, his stock of ideas must necessarily be very
small; and his language, as he can have very little to
communicate or to discuss, must be greatly circumscribed;
confined to a very few words, liable to be exchanged for new ones
as objects arise or vary from time to time. This being
considered, it will not appear strange that there should be no
settled nor fixed speech prevailing amongst the natives of New
Holland; and it will account for what has been thought matter of
astonishment and wonder, that the New Hollander coming from one
part appears to find a difficulty in conversing with the native
of another, though perhaps separated at no very great distance.
In the course of the foregoing narrative, the Reader will find a
relation of interviews betwixt the natives of distant parts,
wherein the difficulty herein remarked upon has occurred.</p>
<p>If their ideas are narrowed, their ingenuity and invention
must be equally so; and the reason of this is, that in reality
the New Hollander has little or nothing to excite the talents of
invention and ingenuity. To take a fish visibly gliding along the
clear stream, the first suggestion that naturally occurs is to
arrest it in its passage with a stone, or some sharp instrument.
The shadow of the stone, as the New Hollander has experienced,
alarms the nimble fish, which then escapes him, the sharp
instrument therefore answers his purpose better; and such an
instrument he generally carries with him. It is a slender stick
of the lightest wood he knows, and made not unlike our fish-gig.
The spear, which is fashioned to a point with a flint-stone or
oyster-shell, is the weapon with which he defends himself against
an enemy, and it is an engine to catch birds. These instruments
are all that is necessary to supply him with every thing he wants
to sustain life. If through his own labour, or otherwise by gift,
or as a kind of family succession, he possesses a <i>mogo</i> or
hatchet, wrought from a sharp flint, with a rough handle, he is
completely enriched. With the help of the <i>mogo</i> he can
climb the highest and most bulky trees to gather fruits, wild
honey, or catch squirrels; he can cut branches to build up his
hut, or by darting it dexterously at an opossum or kangaroo, if
he chance to kill it, can feast on the game. It must, however, be
acknowledged, that some of them have fish-spears not
inartificially formed; and that they have javelins wrought with a
degree of ingenuity. They also use the fishhook and line.</p>
<p>The rules of equity and justice are short, plain and simple;
the code is written on the mind of him we call a Savage, or man
in the state of nature. It is only in the intricate confusion of
a state of society that digests, pandects and commentaries, with
a distinct class of men to expound them, are necessary. The New
Hollander needs them not: he is known to administer justice with
the strictest impartiality. In cases where a canoe has been
wantonly injured, he has been remarked to adjust with precision
the reparation to the trespass. When the life of an individual
has been taken away by treachery or malice, there are instances
of the offender being capitally punished.</p>
<p>The New Hollander is naturally mild and placable, and, unless
injured and aggrieved, quiet and inoffensive. He is not deficient
in point of courage, and is skilful in the use of the club,
shield and spear. To the honour of the Settlers of New South
Wales be it recorded, that no instances of cruelty or oppression
can be proved to have been exercised against the natives; but, on
the contrary, every means used to render them comfortable and
happy, and, if possible, bring them into a state of civilization,
and lift them above their present groveling level of savage life.
How different is this conduct from that of the nation which first
colonized South America!</p>
<p>With this Work will be found a Plate representing a canoe of
New Holland. The native seated in it, holding up a paddle, is a
chief, a sort of troublesome fellow, named <i>Pimbloy</i>. The
resemblance is thought to be striking by those who have seen him.
The other represents <i>Benelong</i>, and is esteemed a good
likeness of him. <i>Benelong</i> visited England with Governor
Philips, and returned to New South Wales with Governor Hunter;
and I am sorry to add, far from being improved by the voyage. He
has unfortunately acquired a fondness for strong liquors, and is
apt to take them to a great excess, at which time he proves very
disorderly and ungovernable. He still retains the highest respect
for Governor Philips, and discovers a grateful sense of the
favours received at his hands.</p>

<small>BENELONG: a Native of New Holland.</small></p>
<br>
<p>The mind of man in the state of nature seems to be the <i>rasa
tabula</i> of the philosophers: it has not been wrought upon by
education; it is wax, of the purest and softest kind, fit to
receive and preserve any impression. It cannot be a wonder that
manners so different, as those of the Settlers of New South
Wales, should excite the admiration and imitation of the New
Hollander. The same observation has been made of the natives of
Otaheite, and other islands of the South Sea. Hence the attempts
at mimicry, for which the native of New Holland is remarkable,
may be accounted for. This talent he is allowed to possess in a
very eminent degree: the gait, the gesture, the minutest
particular which discriminates one individual from another, the
New Hollander hits off instantly. The females likewise possess
the same talent, confined to their own sex; and I have had all
the ladies of my acquaintance exhibited before me, in a most
striking manner, by a female native of New Holland; though, at
the same time, I found a difficulty in prevailing upon her to
display this talent. Probably she might have discovered that it
gave offence to the ladies thus played off in public.</p>
<p>It is said in the Book of Ecclesiasticus, that "the Lord bath
created the physician," and likewise, that "he hath created
medicines out of the earth." This text must now, perhaps, be only
applied to man in a state of nature, who relies on his own skill
for relief in the few disorders to which he is subject, and has
his antidote every where at hand.</p>
<p>In cases of wounds or contusions, the New Hollander seeks his
cure in rest. But the subtle poison of the serpent is extracted
by the following method:&mdash;He makes a ligature above the
wound, and pressing on the part, extracts the poison with the
blood by sucking the wound with his mouth. It is common with
them, after extraordinary fatigue, to chafe the limbs with their
hands, covering them profusely with saliva; and this operation
seldom fails to relieve in such cases. Amputation is always
performed, as has been already observed, by means of a ligature.
In common with other savage nations, they have amongst them those
who pretend to skill in the art of divination and working spells
and charms.</p>
<p>Of the police of New South Wales I have little to say; and,
perhaps, in cases where little favourable can be said, it is best
to be silent. In entering upon such a subject, I may, moreover,
be thought to venture out to sea without rudder or compass: and
it may be asked me, how can you, who are a seaman, presume to
decide upon such matters? Far be it from me to presume any such
thing. As a Briton, I have conceived a strong partiality for that
bulwark of British Liberty, a Trial by Jury: and I was sorry I
could not discover any thing equivalent to such an institution in
the proceedings of the Courts of Judicature in New South Wales. I
am aware that I shall be told, it is an infant Colony, peopled by
a particular class of Settlers, persons over whom, as they have
forfeited their rights as good subjects, and are of suspicious
character, it is good policy to hold the rod of coercion, which
can only be done by a summary mode of administering justice,
whereby the punishment shall speedily follow the crime, and
offenders have little chance of escaping it: that, it is true,
there are Settlers of a very different description, and when
their numbers are increased, and the country more fully settled,
a system of jurisprudence, approaching nearer to the British
model, may take place. Be it so; and may this country prove as
flourishing as it promises to be; persuaded as I am that every
Settler in it might be happy here, if he had but the disposition
to be so!</p>

<h3>[CHAPTER VI.<br>
<br>
<a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a><i>Voyage in the Anna Josepha
round Cape Horn to the Cape of Good Hope</i>]</h3>
<br>
<p>The chief object of my voyage to New South Wales having been
accomplished, as has been shewn in the foregoing sheets, the
mortifications and disappointments I met with, from which I had
no prospect of relief, induced me to seize the first opportunity
of leaving the country. And this presented itself with a vessel
bound to the Cape of Good Hope with coals, and spars for
topmasts, yards and booms, which voyage she was to make by
rounding Cape Horn.</p>
<p>This vessel was an old Spanish brig taken on the coast of Peru
by a Whaler, and sent into Port Jackson. She was called the Anna
Josepha, which was the name of Mrs. King, the Governor's wife.
She was represented to me as not able to perform the voyage, and
every argument was used to deter me from sailing with her. But I
was of a different opinion, and my judgment was by no means
rashly or hastily formed; I had seen her hove down, and observed
that her timbers were strong and well put together: she had been
aground, which caused her to leak, but that did not increase upon
her. Besides, as we intended going to the southward of New
Zealand, there was time to see whether she made more water or
not; moreover, it was a fine season, and in which fair winds
might be expected. Others trusted their persons as well as
property on board the vessel, and had I suffered myself to be
intimidated from undertaking the voyage in her, her safe arrival
afterwards would have proved a perpetual stain on my character as
a seaman, and an officer. Indeed I was not much inclined to
coincide with the sentiments of the people, who were thus forward
in counselling me not to sail with the Anna Josepha; they had
passed the same sentence of unseaworthiness upon the Lady Nelson,
and I had very good reasons to praise her as a most excellent
sailing vessel.</p>
<p>The Governor had at one time come to a resolution of sending
the Norfolk brig round Cape Horn to the Cape of Good Hope, and I
voluntarily offered my services for the same purpose in the Lady
Nelson; however, the Governor afterwards changed his mind, and
neither of the vessels went on the voyage.</p>
<p>Although, as has been before observed, so much pains was taken
to deter me from sailing with the Spanish vessel, yet no offers
were made me as an encouragement to stay behind: and when I was
desirous to return home by way of India in the Cornwallis, every
means were used to prevent it.</p>
<p>The Colony of New South Wales at this juncture experienced a
scarcity of provisions: no bread could be had unless the value
was bartered for with wheat; and that which is called the Staff
of Life was by no means to be obtained with money. This
regulation, however wise and prudent, was particularly hard upon
me, who had not been there long enough to provide myself with a
stock of wheat. One hundred weight of bread, and the same
quantity of pork, was the whole I required as necessary
provisions; the supply I wanted of spirits, tea and sugar, I
could purchase, and of these articles there was a plenty. The
pork I was lucky enough to purchase: as for bread, I am under
many sincere obligations to John Palmer, Esq. Commissary, who, on
learning my situation, sent me a bag, for which he would hear of
no recompence. To Robert Campbell, Esq. I have the like
acknowledgment to make for other necessaries; as also to Mr.
Chapman, Secretary to the Governor. The Governor being sick at
the time, I was prevented by that circumstance from making any
application to him. To Richard Atkins, Esq. Judge Advocate, I
have also many acknowledgments to make on account of the
particular friendship and hospitality which he has shewn me, and
of which I shall ever retain a grateful remembrance.</p>
<p>Having remained since the 22d of July, I sailed on the 9th of
November, 1801, and got safe out of the harbour of Port Jackson
with the Anna Josepha, and bid adieu to this country.</p>
<p>I could here transcribe from the log-book a tedious detail of
heavy seas, unfavourable weather, and bad accommodation on board
a leaky vessel, but shall content myself with observing, that I
experienced all I have mentioned in this last voyage. The course
from Port Jackson round Cape Horn is a beaten track and well
known. We soon got to the southward of New Zealand, and about the
beginning of January made the land about Cape Horn to the
northward of the Isles De Fonzos. As we had had for some time a
strong northerly wind, we passed between them and the main,
rounding Cape Horn within half a mile of the shore. Cape Horn is
a bold steep rock, having near it two other rocks a little to the
northward, which being perpendicular have an appearance not
unlike columns. As we met with baffling winds that prevented us
from passing through the Strait of Le Mair, we sailed along the
southern side of Staten Land. Off the land we met with very heavy
flurries of wind; from which circumstance, and the passage we had
made, I am warranted in affirming, that the timber cut in
Hunter's River is well adapted for the purpose of making masts;
its grain is long and elastic, and it is besides a light wood,
though not so much so as the pine of Norway: there is, however,
no great difference in respect of weight betwixt them, and until
closely examined, it may pass very well for the red pine. This
wood was first discovered by a Spaniard brought to New South
Wales from the Cape of Good Hope; he was a ship's carpenter, and
was now on board the Anna Josepha. When I conversed with him on
the subject, he assured me that the same sort of timber grew on
the coast of Peru, and from its elastic nature was considered
there as peculiarly well adapted for masts. By this man's advice
trial was made of it, and it answered the character he gave it.
Every one who sees this timber will be able to judge from its
appearance and weight, that what is here set down is no more than
truth. I thought it a duty to bring home a small specimen of this
wood, which has been submitted to the inspection and
consideration of the proper officers of Government.</p>
<p>On the 21st of January 1802, having before intended to touch
at Falkland's Islands, we came safe to an anchor in Hope Bay, or
Little West Point Harbour.</p>
<p>I must observe here, that we found Arrowsmith's Chart very
correct with respect to Cape Horn and Falkland's Islands; the
harbour I have just mentioned is named on it Hope Bay, but the
people who frequent these islands generally called it West
Point.</p>
<p>Our intention had been first to touch at a cluster of islands
to the eastward, called New Islands by the Americans, who are the
most constant visitors of Falkland's Islands. On New Islands are
found plenty of goats and hogs. They lie about thirty miles
S.S.W. by compass, of Hope Bay, as a N.N.E. course carried us
from them clear to the entrance of West Point. They are
distinguished by a particular saddle island and a bluff standing
separate from each other. They are a little to the northward of
Beaver Island, and will be easily found by these two remarkable
islands just mentioned.</p>
<p>As it is of the greatest consequence to Mariners, when in want
of water or refreshments, to obtain every possible information in
order to secure a port amongst this foul-weather groupe of
islands, which purpose may be defeated by the smallest oversight,
I think it may not be unacceptable to set down here a few Remarks
made in this run.</p>
<p>Having made New Islands, the westerly wind, which generally
prevails, blowing very strong and in squalls, would not permit us
to anchor; we were therefore under the necessity, either of
making the harbour of West Point, or running in the night through
a passage among the Jasons, well known to be full of rocks and
shoals, many of them not laid down in any Chart. I have before
observed, that thirty miles N.N.E. by compass, brought us to the
entrance of West Point harbour. In this run there are, on the
right hand, a few small flat islands called Pass Islands; these
ought to be kept on board near enough to see the surf breaking on
them; and soon after a remarkable island, with a steep side, will
present itself, having the appearance of a <i>split</i> in the
middle, which has given it the name of Split Island. Here we
observed the latitude at noon to be 51&deg; 14' S. when it bore
E.N.E. by compass, distance three miles. The Split must be
brought to bear S. by W. running in, and N. by E. coming out,
observing this, a vessel will find itself in the fair way; and
right a-head coming in, or right a-stem going out, a sight will
be had of West Port entrance, making at first like three
hummocks, to the right of which is the mouth of the harbour. The
small harbour on the left is preferable to the larger on the
right, though anchorage will be found in both, but fresh water
may more readily be had in the little harbour. Both these form
together nearly an oval, divided by the passage which runs
directly through where the tides of flood and ebb alternately
enter. A vessel must therefore haul close round the rocks on the
south side to get into the little harbour for the ebb tide, with
which she must go in, unless it blows very strong so as to enable
her to stem the flood; both tides here running with great
rapidity, and when it blows hard raising a confused sea. There is
a sandy beach at the top of the harbour, off which a vessel may
chuse her depth of water to anchor in. In going out of the
harbour the Northern Passage is most eligible; and a westerly
wind with a course N. by E. by compass will carry a vessel out,
provided she get under weigh at the first of the ebb. Five small
perpendicular rocks, called the Needle Keys, appear when out,
standing together, bearing N.E. by E. or thereabouts, from the
harbour's mouth. It is best to leave them on the right; but
should there be little wind, and the tide strong, as was the case
when we passed them, a vessel may go close to the right of them.
The tide must be attended to, as it runs strongly betwixt them.
The water close to them is very deep, as we were carried by the
tide near enough to throw any thing upon them. The bottom is very
foul, so that if an anchor is let go it is a chance if it is ever
recovered; and should the wind continue light, the tide of flood
making, a vessel may anchor at Sedge Island, if she can get as
far down, where ten fathoms water will be found, with a sandy
bottom, within two or three miles of the shore. From Sedge Island
a N. by E. course will carry a vessel clear out to sea.</p>
<p>It is proper to observe here, that if a vessel is obliged to
leave the Needle Keys on her left hand, the nearer she keeps to
them the better; and even to haul over on the larboard side after
she is past, as she will have the more room to weather a ledge of
rocks lying a considerable distance out from Saunders Point, as
is shewn in Arrowsmith's Chart. This passage is much preferable
to running through the Jasons.</p>
<p>Falkland's Islands have been described by many voyagers, whose
stay there gave them better opportunity of observation. I shall
just observe that they lie very convenient for being touched at
on long voyages, when there happens such a necessity for a supply
of sea stock as we experienced.</p>
<p>The soil is light, producing a strong grass, known by the name
of fussack, which if set fire to, the turf will burn for a
considerable time, and notwithstanding heavy rains is not to be
extinguished. I saw but little timber, and even brush wood did
not appear to be plenty. Few birds are to be seen, but geese and
penguins are in great numbers.</p>
<p>The penguin has been often described, and must be known to
most of my readers. It is without wings of sufficient size to
support its weight in the air, but it runs pretty fast by the
help of its short wing in an erect posture. The penguin forms
burrows in the earth where it rests, and marching in bodies in
the morning to feed, returns to them at night to rest. One of
them is generally found near the retreat, seemingly placed there
as a centinel. If you approach near his post, he gives an alarm
and retreats, returning when you are at a distance.</p>
<p>We found the geese excellent eating, without the least taste
of fish, as they live here on grass and sea weed; and accordingly
we derived a very seasonable assistance from them. They are not
shy, and will suffer you to come very near them before they
remove, and then not very fast. We brought some of them with us
alive to the Cape. The gander is easily distinguished from the
goose, the former being perfectly white, and the latter prettily
speckled with black. We lived chiefly on them whilst we staid,
making our soup with them; and we killed some hundreds for our
sea stock; which had we not done we must have perished. Our
method of preserving them was to split them down the back, wash
them well in salt water, sprinkle rock salt over them, then
expose them to the air to dry, and afterwards pack them up in
barrels, with a proper quantity of salt to keep them for the
voyage.</p>
<p>Celery I found growing plentifully here, probably introduced
by former visitors to these islands. It proved a very useful
vegetable for us, and we used it very freely on board our vessel.
Its antiscorbutic virtues are well known, as well as its
usefulness for culinary purposes.</p>
<p>We found an American ship lying here, called the Washington of
Nantucket: her commander, Jedediah Fitz, was so obliging as to
assist us with a small supply of bread, which we could not but
consider as a particular kindness done to us, as being bound to
China, with a cargo of seal skins which he had been successful in
taking, he had a long voyage before him. He informed me that the
American sailors had discovered potatoes eaten raw to be a very
powerful antiscorbutic, and that their whaling vessels constantly
took a quantity with them to sea to eat raw, as an antidote
against the scurvy. He had planted a garden here, as was the
custom with vessels visiting this place, and he brought some
potatoes fresh dug from it, which he recommended me to taste,
after setting me an example. I complied, and must say I have
before taken a more unpalatable medicine. He made use of the
young leaves of the common dock, boiling them as cabbage, to eat
with his meat. He stripped the leaf from the rib or stem in the
middle, which he said had a purgative quality. He made no use of
the celery, as he thought the dock was preferable to it. I dined
with him on board his ship, when a dish of the latter vegetable
was served upon table, and upon eating it I thought its taste not
unpleasant.</p>
<p>Some of our people, as I suspect, had wantonly set fire to the
fussack, and there being a breeze the flames spread with great
fury, so that our endeavours to extinguish it proved ineffectual.
Although we had a heavy rain for two days, yet I observed it was
still burning. When I considered that this was the season for
hatching, I was greatly concerned to think of the destruction
amongst the geese, penguins, and other fowls, which such
mischievous wantonness must occasion, especially as future
visitors, in the same distress as we were, might suffer
inconveniences through it.</p>
<p>The rocks here are remarkably slippery, so that it is a proper
precaution against accident to be provided with what the sailors
term <i>mockasons</i>, which are sandals cut from the seal or
other soft pliable skin, and wore as shoes. For want of this
preventive against slipping I had nearly met with a fatal
accident; for as I was in pursuit of a flock of geese, I fell
with my piece loaded, which went off, and the powder-horn slung
under my arm exploded at the same time. It was a ship's
powder-horn, and contained nearly a pound of powder, but,
providentially, I escaped without any other hurt than my hands
being slightly scorched, and my hair a little singed.</p>
<p>By this time our crew were pretty well refreshed. None of them
had been attacked with the scurvy, notwithstanding the poorness
of their diet, their being almost constantly wet from the
quantity of water the vessel shipped, and their labour at the
pump. I had had some painful apprehensions of their proving sick,
and had endeavoured to prevent it by keeping them as clean and
dry below as possible, and making them shift themselves
frequently. These precautions, with the necessary exercise of the
pump, I have the satisfaction to think contributed to keep them
in health. And I am inclined to believe, as fumigations are found
to be of service in the correction of foul air between decks,
smoaking tobacco has its use; I would therefore rather encourage
men to smoak tobacco than to chew it.</p>
<p>All things being ready for our departure, we sailed from
Falkland's Islands for the Cape of Good Hope on the 27th of
January, with a favourable wind, which began to fail us as soon
as we reached the island of Tristan da Cunha. We were now
becalmed; and this was our situation from about the middle of
February to nearly the latter end of March&mdash;a dreadful
interval of time!&mdash;the like of which I most devoutly pray I
may never again experience.</p>
<p>We had reckoned upon falling in with the Cape early in March,
and our stock of provisions began to fall short much about that
time; and further to add to our distress, our water-casks leaked,
and we had lost a part of our water. It will be recollected that
we were ill provided with bread on our first sailing from Port
Jackson. By the end of February this necessary article of our
provisions totally failed, and I found myself reduced to a single
biscuit. When we had no other prospect before us than perishing
through hunger and thirst, we were partially relieved, as the
Reader will find in the sequel.</p>
<p>The first vessel we fell in with was an English brig,
belonging to a Gentleman who had shewn me much civility when I
was at the Cape of Good Hope on my passage out, and who happened
to be then on board. The commander, Mr. Atkins, and this
Gentleman, whose name is Houghton, of the firm of Houghton and
M'Donald, a house of the first respectability at the Cape, sent
us several articles, which, circumstanced as we were, were above
all price. I declined their offers of joining them, as I thought
I should reach the Cape in a short time, and I repented
afterwards that I did not join them.</p>
<p>The calm continuing we were soon again reduced to an allowance
barely sufficient to keep us alive. Our stock of water, in
particular, was short; and as the weather was warm we experienced
great distress from the want of it. I often walked the deck till
I was thoroughly fatigued, that I might sleep through weariness
in spite of extreme thirst. I now discovered how little nature
may be satisfied with even to esteem that little a luxury.</p>
<p>Our good fortune at length drifted us in sight of an American
ship bound to the Cape, called the Ocean, of Newbury Port. The
commander of this ship, whose name is Dalton, sent to our relief
a little bread, and some meat. Having been long at sea, and
meeting with calms, his stock of water ran short, so that he
could spare us only a small supply, and that he cheerfully sent
us.</p>
<p>I agreed with Captain Dalton to carry me to the Cape in his
vessel; for though we had not yet made the land, a good wind for
forty-eight hours would have carried us within sight of Table
Bay. But the calm still continued, and lasted ten days from this
time, during which we drifted to the northward of Saldanah Bay,
and the Anna Josepha was again relieved by Captain Dalton. The
very seals seemed to partake of the listlessness of the elements
of air and water. They lay sleeping on the smooth surface of the
sea; so that the crew of the Anna Josepha easily took them with
the harpoon, and derived the principal part of their subsistence
from them.</p>
<p>We now got in with the land, and a favourable wind of five
hours would have run both vessels into Saldanah Bay. The Anna
Josepha was necessitated to send her boat off to procure water,
if any was to be had. On the 29th of March a breeze springing up,
the ship I was in reached Table Bay on the 1st of April, 1802,
and two days after the Anna Josepha arrived, having lost a man,
who had been driven by hunger to eat something that killed him in
a few hours.</p>
<p>I had lived so low for such a length of time that I found
myself very feeble and weak; and now being on shore, partaking of
a plentiful diet, I experienced violent spasms in my stomach,
attended with a giddiness and nausea. However, as I recovered my
strength, these symptoms left me, and I was restored to my former
good state of health without the help of medicine. By the favour
of Sir Roger Curtis, I embarked for England on the 12th of April,
on board his Majesty's ship Imperieuse, Captain Rowley, to whom,
and to whose officers, I am happy in having it in my power, in
this public manner, to return my sincere thanks for their
attention to me during the voyage, which was very successfully
made.</p>
<p>The coals from New South Wales, brought to the Cape of Good
Hope in the Anna Josepha, sold there for 36 rix dollars the ton.
As news of a Peace had then arrived, the spars were not of such
ready sale; but I have no doubt they were well sold. In the
manner herein related did I make a circumnavigatory voyage of
this globe of Earth. I accomplished it as far back as the Cape of
Good Hope, in vessels which, according to the opinion of some who
may be considered as competent judges, were not fit to go to sea.
Whilst I had the command of the Lady Nelson she did not lose a
single man, and she arrived at Port Jackson without the least
damage in hull, masts, sails or rigging, which may in a great
measure be attributed to her many excellent qualities.</p>
<p>If I have in the least contributed to the service of my King
and Country, I am well satisfied. I had difficulties and
disadvantages to struggle with, which those only can conceive who
have found themselves in similar situations. My little vessel
sailed on her voyage with no creditable report of her fitness for
the purpose; and even her successful performance of it did not
obtain her that praise which in my humble opinion she merits. To
conclude, I must say, that I risked my life and character on the
event of the voyage, and sailed from England with very little
assistance, her inferior size and peculiar construction having
deterred those who might have been of the most use from engaging
to sail in her.</p>

<p align="center"><i>Certificates of the Officers of the</i>
TRIAL CUTTER <i>respecting the Qualities of that
Vessel.</i><br></p>
<p><small>WE</small> the Officers of his Majesty's cutter, the
Trial, do hereby certify, that the said Cutter with three Sliding
Keels, does, from the effect of the Keels, tack, wear, steer upon
a wind, sail fast, work to windward, and hold a good wind; and
that the Keels work with ease, and are not attended with any
inconveniency to the working of the vessel: And we also certify,
that we see no difference in heaving up or down the Keels in
blowing weather, or in a sea, but that they work equally well in
all sorts of weather; and that these Keels are, in our opinion, a
great improvement, and are still capable of greater improvements:
And we further certify, that when the vessel rolls deep in a high
sea, we do not observe that the Keels strain the vessel, the
wells, decks, beams or sides, or are in the least attended with
any bad consequences; but on the contrary, when down, make the
vessel much easier, and prevent her rolling so quick: And we
further certify, that we never were in any vessel of her size and
draught of water, that sailed faster, or carried a greater press
of sail, or made better weather: And we also certify, that such
of the Seamen who have sailed in cutters, say, that they never
were in one so dry, or that made such good weather: We further
certify, that it is our opinion, that if the four bulkheads in
the hold were taken away, and that her mast and sails were in
proportion to her tonnage, and that she was coppered,
notwithstanding her uncommon strength, she would sail much faster
than she now does: And we also certify, that from the third
instant to the date hereof, we have never been in company with
any vessel, (the Alarm Custom-house lugger excepted) that we can
with justice say has beat the Trial: We further certify, that we
came into Teignmouth in order to satisfy ourselves, with respect
to the condition of the wells and keels, before we reported the
vessel to their Lordships; and having cleared the hold near them,
do not find that they are in the least degree affected, or do
leak, or are even damp: And lastly we certify, that we have
attended strictly to the instructions given us by Captain Schank,
and have found them, with his observations, to prove the utility
of the Keels, and their effects on the vessel's working and
sailing: All which we hope will meet with their Lordships'
approbation.</p>

<i>Master of His Majesty's Cutter</i>, <small>TRIAL</small>,
<i>with his Answers thereto.</i> 15<i>th April</i>, 1791.</p>
<br>
<p><i>Question</i>. How long have you been at sea in the
Trial?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. Two months and an half.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Did you understand the nature or effect of
the Keels before I explained them to you?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. I had very little idea of them.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. What opinion had you of them before you
sailed and made trial of them?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. My opinion was, after having heard you explain
the nature of them, that they would have the desired effect.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Does she steer as well as any other vessel
you have been in with her Keels down?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. She steers preferable to any vessel I ever
sailed in when her Keels are down.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Does she steer equally well with them all
up?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. She does.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. What do you observe to be the effect of the
Fore-keel?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. It makes her very quick in stays.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. What do you observe to be the effect of the
After-keel;</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. With the After-keel she will wear with very
little help of the rudder, and when going upon a wind, may be
steered almost without the rudder.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. What do you observe to be the effect of the
Main-Keel?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. With the assistance of the other two it will
make her go to windward with any vessel I have seen.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Do you think, from what you have seen, that
the Keels are attended with any danger whatever to the
vessel?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. None whatever.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Do you foresee any danger that is likely to
happen from them?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. Not the least.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Do you think she would sail as fast upon a
wind, and go as well to windward, if she had not these Keels?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. By no means.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Is she a good roader; and do you think
vessels so constructed will be better roaders than others?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. She certainly is a good roader; and I am of
opinion that vessels of her construction would ride preferable to
any other.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Does she tack quick?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. Yes.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Does she wear quick?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. She does.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Are the Keels of service in wearing and
tacking?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. Of very great service in both.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Is the After-keel of service in going before
the wind, or scudding in a high sea, and a strong gale of
wind?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. It is of very great service.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Did you ever see a vessel of her size with so
flat a floor go as fast?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. No.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. What do you think of her in pitching?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. She is remarkably easy.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. What do you think of her in rolling?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. She is an easy roller.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. What do you think of her in point of
stiffness?</p>

down the Keels in different situations, such as upon a wind, a
press of sail, &amp;c.?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. None whatever.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. What strength does it take to heave up or
down the Keels?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. One man can heave up or down the Fore or After
Keel, and two the Main Keel.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Supposing a rope to break in heaving up or
down the Keels, do you see any danger attending it?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. None.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Could it soon be repaired?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. Very soon.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Do you think vessels so constructed are in
all respects as good as the present plans for merchant ships with
respect to stowage safely against fire or damps?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. I do think they are.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Do you think the plan can be improved
upon?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. Yes.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Do you think vessels so constructed will be
better in all respects than any other?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. I think in time they will.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Do you think that vessels with the
improvement of separate bulkheads would be saved in case of
springing a leak that you were not able to pump out?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. They would.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Do you see any fault to vessels so
constructed either as ships of war or merchant ships; or do you
know of any trade that such vessels would not answer?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. I know of none.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Supposing such a vessel was cast away, either
on rocks or sands, do you think there would be a better chance of
saving the lives of the crew and the cargo, than in any other
vessel?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. There certainly would.</p>
<p><i>Question</i>. Would you prefer such a vessel to any other
to go round the world in?</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>. Yes.</p>

<p align="center"><i>In consequence of a Request made to the
Lords of the Admiralty by Captain</i> <small>SCHANK</small>,
<i>that the</i> <small>TRIAL</small> <i>Cutter might be ordered
into one of His Majesty's Ports, and there inspected, and the
Officers examined touching her Qualities, their Lordships were
pleased to issue the following Order.</i></p>
<p align="right"><i>Admiralty Office</i>, 12th <i>April</i>,
1792.   </p>
<p><small>   GENTLEMEN,</small><br>
<br>
<small>WHEREAS</small> Captain Schank bath, by his letter of the
7th ult. requested that His Majesty's armed vessel built with
Sliding Keels, of his invention, may be ordered into one of His
Majesty's Ports and taken into a Dock in order to examine whether
the Keels are rubbed or worn, and whether the vessel or the wells
are strained, and that the Officers may be examined touching the
qualities of the vessel in the trials that have been made of her:
and whereas we have thought fit to order Lieutenant Malbon to
proceed with the said vessel to Woolwich for the purpose
abovementioned, we send you herewith Captain Schank's said
letter, and do hereby desire and direct you to cause the said
vessel, on her arrival at Woolwich, to be taken into a dock, and
fixed on blocks in such a manner as Captain Schank shall advise;
and direct the Master Shipwrights of Deptford and Woolwich Yards
with their Assistants, and also the Masters Attendant of those
Yards, carefully to inspect and report to you the state in which
they find her to be; as also the different qualities of the
vessel, according to the best accounts they may be able to
collect from her Officers in the various trials they have made of
her; and you will also direct them to consider and report to you,
whether the repairing of vessels so constructed will be attended
with great difficulty, and whether they will be more or less
expensive than vessels of the old construction: and when you have
received and maturely considered the said Reports, and received
such explanation from Captain Schank as you may think necessary,
you are to transmit to us copies thereof, with your opinion of
the advantages that may be derived to his Majesty's service from
the invention above-mentioned.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this order the Trial cutter was taken into
Woolwich Dock-yard and there inspected; and the Officers
belonging to her were distinctly and separately examined: after
which the following Report was made to the Navy Board by the
several Officers empowered to inspect the vessel and examine the
Officers:</p>
<p align="right"><i>Woolwich Yard</i>, 25th <i>April</i>,
1792.   </p>
<p><small>HONOURABLE SIRS,</small><br>
<br>
In obedience to your Order of the 16th instant, we have taken his
Majesty's Armed Vessel into a dock, on blocks five feet high, and
have very carefully inspected the Vessel, Wells, and Sliding
Keels, and cannot discover the least defect in either.</p>
<p>We are of opinion, vessels so constructed will be a little
more expensive than others, but may be repaired without any
difficulty.</p>
<p>Inclosed you will receive the Questions put by us to the
lieutenant and Master separately, with their Answers; and
remain,</p>
<p align="center">Honourable Sirs,<br>
Your most obedient servants,</p>

<h3>No. IV.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>AFTER</small> the Trial cutter had been inspected at
Woolwich Yard, she left that place, and was proceeding to her
station at Plymouth, when James Templer, Esq. of Stove, in the
county of Devon, a Gentleman who has given much of his attention
to the study of mechanics, and the improvement of naval
architecture, and who had viewed the Cutter in Woolwich Yard, was
desirous of seeing the operation and effects of the Keels in the
working of the ship; he accordingly went on board the Trial, and
sailed in her to the Coast of Devon. Upon his landing, he wrote
as follows to Captain Schank:&mdash;"We were weather-bound a day
or two, and made a good harbour of Dungenness. The wind was foul
all the way afterwards, and at times little or none. We had a
fine breeze the morning we arrived: I was happy in the
opportunity of seeing all the effects and operations of the
Sliding Keels, and am now more than ever convinced of their great
utility. The vessel steers and goes about with great certainty,
never losing her stay, but shoots round her course, and continues
it while filling the sails, an advantage that removes the chance
of accidents, when a vessel entirely (as is often the case) loses
her stay, and is in danger of going upon her beam ends before she
gets under way again, especially in a large sea. I observe the
stowage of the vessel is as complete as in the old way, and I
think more so, as the cargo (particularly if corn or any thing
that is liable to shift,) is so fixed, that such a cargo,
although the ship may not be half full, is rendered stationary
and safe. Another thing; various sorts of grain may be put in the
same vessel without chance of mixing. A very great advantage also
is, that of the ship being able to get into shallow harbours, or
run over rocks, sands, &amp;c. as was the case with us coming
down. We came over the Flats at less than half an hour's flood,
and to try the effect we let the aftermost Keel be down, and
running into shallow water upon the tail of the Spaniard, it rose
and fell without the aid of the winch; a clear proof that nothing
is to be apprehended from the fixing of the Keel at the time she
may strike the ground. These considerations, when once known,
must render the invention acceptable to the Public; but people
are so unfortunately prejudiced in favour of old fashions that it
is difficult to turn them. For my own part, I am so well
convinced that the system adopted in the Trial is correct, that
whenever my work is done, I will it immediately adopt it in the
Coasters from this Harbour, as they will not only be able to get
quite up to Newton, or even up the Canal with a cargo, but can
get in and out of the Harbour at any time in it spite of the Bar,
which at this time impedes all other craft of any li burthen, or
drawing any depth of water. I am persuaded if you could have an
opportunity of building another, and not be controuled in the
plan, you would exhibit a specimen of nautical improvement,
equal, if not exceeding every other. The Public, I fear, do not
yet know how much is due to you for the pains you have taken to
accommodate them. For one, I beg to return you my thanks for the
information you have furnished me with, and which I am sure will
prove it very advantageous to me; especially, if I carry stone
from Babicomb Bay up the Canal, and Bovey coal, in war-time, to
the Rock in that Bay. I wish you may find a general good opinion
prevail, and that the countenance of the Public may not be
wanting to make you the greatest return you are undoubtedly
entitled to. I forgot to observe, that we sailed some leagues
without the use of the rudder, steering the vessel with
particular accuracy by the keels only, a circumstance almost
incredible to those who do not see it; but the reason is so
substantial, that it accords with true mechanical principles, and
the effect is certain."</p>
