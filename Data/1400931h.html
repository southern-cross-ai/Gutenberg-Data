<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THE sky was a bleak, gray vault over the city,
sifting down a fine mist of chill rain. Along Fourth Avenue, the
rows of bookstalls were tarpaulin-covered, and muddy rivulets
streaked the window of Duane's Second-Hand Bookstore. Within, lank
and drooping-lidded, Ford Duane moved noiselessly between the
gloom-shrouded, high walls of weary volumes across whose backs his
fingers whispered lovingly. A single carbon lamp, pendant from an
encrusted cord, spread heavy shadows on the bare boards of the
floor and on the book-filled shelving&mdash;shadows that were
somehow darkly alive and pregnant with an odd menace.</p>

<p>Veiled as they were, the eyes of the long-legged bookseller were
keenly blue, strangely restless. They flecked about constantly with
a wariness wholly at variance with the drowsy peace of the deserted
shop; and under his stained alpaca smock, tense muscles quivered
with readiness for instant action. The thud of a passing footfall,
the creak of a drying beam, twitched his sharp ascetic face to them
and tightened his thin lips, time and again, till their source,
their innocence, had been established.</p>

<p>The doorknob rattled and Duane whirled to the sound, his hand
flashing to an inner pocket. A ragged, swarthy man scraped sodden
shoes on the threshold and smiled ingratiatingly. "Please," he said
in the liquid accents of southern Italy. "Please attend to moosic,
meester." He gestured vaguely with a battered flute clutched in one
dirty, gnarled hand. "Pay all that you like."</p>

<p>Duane relaxed, but his face was rigid, expressionless. "No. No,
I have work to do." He crossed, with his curiously silent glide, to
a paint-peeled writing table near the door and slid into its broken
chair. "And I have no money." He pulled a sheet of yellow paper
toward him, a pencil. "I'll be playing in the street myself if
business keeps up the way it is. Try next door."</p>

<p>The musician did not stir. But Duane seemed to have utterly
forgotten the intrusion. He frowned musingly, and inscribed three
letters at the head of the sheet. P-A-T. A gleam flickered in the
beggar's eyes, vanished. He shrugged, back into the street.</p>

<p>Duane smiled, fleetingly and without humor. He drew five
horizontal lines across the paper, the five lines of the musical
staff&mdash;and held his pencil poised, as if waiting for
inspiration. But his eyes wandered to the three letters he had
written, and his thin lips moved, repeating the flutist's words;
<i>"P</i>lease <i>a</i>ttend <i>t</i>o moosic. <i>P</i>ay
<i>a</i>ll <i>t</i>hat you like." Was it only coincidence that the
initial letters of the first three words of each sentence were the
same, and were identical with those he had jotted down?</p>

<p>A flurry of heavier rain beat at the window. Its tattoo seemed
like fingers rapping a message on the glass, a message of death.
P-A-T! Once an old man had sold Duane a dog-eared volume he
represented as a <i>P</i>etronius, printed by <i>A</i>rden and
bound by <i>T</i>rant. That night, men had died, suddenly,
mysteriously. On another occasion, a pushcart hawker had called his
wares, <i>"P</i>ails! <i>A</i>xes! <i>T</i>eenvare!" The bookdealer
had made a purchase from him, and when the sun visited the city
again, two bloated corpses were bobbing on the greasy waters of
Long Island Sound. Now once more the three ominous letters had
prefaced apparently innocuous words where Ford could hear
them...</p>

<p>Shrill sound pierced the wall separating Duane from the store
next door, the lilting rhythm of a popular song. <i>"Have you ever
seen a dream walking?"</i> the flute asked, muted by the
intervening, thin partition. But the sugary flow of the tune was
sprayed by a spatter of grace notes dropped in by awkward fingers
fumbling the instrument's stops. The discordance rambled through
the melody, flew as it jotted down&mdash;<i>those very notes!
"&mdash;the Heaven in my arms was you."</i> The flute sobbed into
silence. The five horizontal lines on Ford's paper were filled now
by the hieroglyphics of musical shorthand. The thin-faced man
looked at the sheet before him:</p>

<p>He paused a moment, considered the arrangement of the notes he
had written, and suddenly his pencil was moving again, setting down
English letters over the music he had inscribed:</p>

<p class="cp"><i>"Odon at Kensico since Sun. Why? T."</i>
</p>
<br>

<p class="first">FORD DUANE stared long at the paper on the desk
before him, while lumping muscles ridge his lean jaw and a veil
seems to drop across his eyes. The fingers of the rain tap against
the storefront, but he hears only the fingers of Death rapping on
his door. Not for him. This seeming shopkeeper has lived and
breathed in the tangible presence of danger too long to fear it.
The threat whose icy breath chills him is for the unsuspecting
people of the teeming human warren called New York, for the women
and the little children. At Kensico, in Westchester, the metropolis
drinking water bids farewell to the sun before it plunges
underground into great mains that divide and subdivide till their
final capillaries reach into the city's multifarious homes and gush
the fluid of life into glasses, pots, and infants' feeding bottles.
At Kensico, if anywhere, is the City's vulnerable point, the
Achilles' heel where an enemy may strike once, and slay a
million-fold.</p>

<p>But we have no enemy&mdash;America is at peace with all the
world. Duane's lax hand lies on a newspaper, today's <i>Times.</i>
On an inside page, a small item notes that the transfer of gold
from the San Francisco mint to mid-continent safety has been
completed. Safety from what? Earthquakes, the treasury says. But
the San Francisco Mint withstood the 1905 cataclysm with not a
crack in its walls.</p>

<p>Yesterday the guard on the Panama Canal was doubled. Was that
also to guard against earthquakes? For two years the fleet has been
concentrated in the Pacific, while shipyards all over the country
ring with feverish building. Earthquakes again?</p>

<p>In a far-off oriental land, men with reptilian eyes and tinted
skin drink silent toasts to the Day when the red sun of the island
empire shall dye the Occidental World with the lurid stain of the
White Race's ultimate blood. Europe is torn with internal strife,
bled white by its own vampire politicians, already an easy prey to
saffron hordes ready to overrun it&mdash;did not America bar the
way. America! Still strong! Still stalwart!</p>

<p>America must be weakened or dreams of World Domination will
never be realized. America must be weakened&mdash;by strikes, by
disease, by calamities mysteriously propagated and mysteriously
spread. It is not the people of that distant land who have so
decreed; it is not their King. Nevertheless someone has proclaimed
America's destruction, and the rats dispatched to the task scutter
in the darkness, gnawing, gnawing, gnawing...</p>

<p>Night-dark deepens in the drizzling street. Ford Duane sighs,
lifts from his seat, locks his store-door, clicks out the one
hanging light. He is like a gray ghost, slithering back to the
curtained alcove in the rear where a frowsy cot, a table cluttered
by unwashed dishes, and a single gas-plate on an up-ended box are
all the home he has. He is like a phantom&mdash;and suddenly has
vanished.</p>

<p>A keen eye might have noted the flicker of movement that was the
swift raising and lowering of a trapdoor whose edges are so
skillfully fashioned that now they cannot be discerned. A keen ear
might have noted, momentarily, the scraping of fabric against stone
beneath the bookstore. A ferret is prowling the underground burrows
of the yellow rats that gnaw...</p>
<br>

<p class="first">THE clouds have dispersed. There is a moon this
midnight, and under the loom of Kensico Dam a hundred cars are
parked while lovers whisper or are dreamily silent. Above them
hangs a million watery tons of life and death, restrained by a
staunch wall of stone. Above them creeps a more deadly peril, and
one man alone can guard them from it.</p>

<p>Two miles north of the dam, the billowing dark blanket of the
woods folds close to the silver sheet of the man-created lake. Here
there are no cars, no whispering lovers. The sylvan silence is
broken only by the ripple of breeze-stroked water and the piercing
hymn of a myriad insects of the night. Solitude, primordial quiet,
reign supreme here, a half-hour from the tumult of Times
Square&mdash;the peace of green and growing things.
Peace&mdash;abruptly the insect-piping is silenced; the woods seem
to listen with bated breath. Underbrush rustles and a shadowy form
emerges from the trees.</p>

<p>An arrow of light darts across the lake's surface, spatters
against the shore. The moon's effulgence takes the intruder. He is
squat, stocky. The sleek, black hair of his hatless head lies close
to the skull. Cold cruelty glitters in his black, perfectly round
eyes and tightens his fleshless lips to a straight gash across his
oddly tinted face. Even his walk, as he slithers across the narrow
band of pebbles to the water's edge, is somehow exotic,
somehow&mdash;reptilian.</p>

<p>He stands motionless, gazing across the reservoir, gazing at the
pale glow of the southern horizon beneath which the city spreads.
His arm hangs straight down at his side; in its hand is a small,
black satchel circled by thick straps. That hand is long-fingered,
almost effeminate. Its nails are filed to sharp points and the
crescents at their bases are deeply, queerly blue. There is about
this man an aura of evil, of chill malevolence from which the very
trees seem to shudder away.</p>

<p>The Oriental kneels, places his black bag on the ground. His
hands move deftly, the straps fall away, there is the click of a
lock and the bag is open. He fumbles within, brings out a long,
thick cylinder of glass within which a viscous transparent liquid
absorbs the moon's silver and turns it to a green radiance eerily
suggestive of putrescence&mdash;of rotting, plague-stricken
cadavers.</p>

<p>The man smiles, slowly, satanically, and he tugs at the
cotton-swathed cork plugging the tube of death. The pop as it comes
free is startlingly loud in the stillness. He twists to spill the
green liquid into the water from which New York will drink
tomorrow.</p>

<p>A cold, grim voice sounds abruptly from the tree-shadows. "Hold
it! <i>Hold it just that way, Baron Odon."</i></p>

<p>Something in that sudden voice freezes the <i>saboteur</i> as if
he has been sprayed by a jet of dry ice. Only a sharp hiss of
startled breath shows that he is alive.</p>

<p>Again the underbrush rustles with human movement. A shadow
firms, slides out on the tiny beach. It is a tall figure of
darkness in the moonlight, a shapeless blue detached from the
velvet night. Odon, cringing on his knees, the lethal container in
one hand and its stopper in the other, glimpses a concealing black
robe, topped by a shapeless gray felt and a gray mask from behind
whose twin slits menace glints. His fear-widened eyes fasten on the
muzzle of a revolver snouting pointblank at him, on a revolver and
on the rock-steady hand gripping its butt.</p>

<p>That hand is a blob of black, almost invisible against the
cloak's blackness. But one finger, the finger that curls about the
gun's trigger, is blood-red, a dash of scarlet weirdly awesome. The
Asiatic's lips twitch, soundlessly form a name. "Red Finger!"</p>
<br>

<p class="first">IN THE dark subterranean world where the silent,
eternal war is waged that waits for no ultimatums, no booming drums
nor blaring bugles, that name is one of dread. More than one
master-spy has been erased from the lists of his nation by that
scarlet digit, more than one fine-wrought scheme for America's
destruction has been smashed by him whose badge it is. In a dozen
chancelleries, a fortune waits to reward him who can prove that Red
Finger no longer lives... "Put that cork back into the tube,
firmly." The words drip from under the speaker's gray mask, each a
slow syllable of infinite threat.</p>

<p>Odon obeys. Death is once more stoppered. "Stand up and hand it
to me."</p>

<p>The Oriental comes lithely erect, holds out the green cylinder
at arm's length. Red Finger's other hand, black-gloved, appears
from the folds of his cloak to take it. Something whips from the
murk of the woods, close behind him&mdash;something thin and
snakelike. It coils about his neck, tightens. Odon drops to the
sand, just under a spray of fine mist that jets from the
counter-spy's gun. The American jerks back, gurgling, clawing at
the thing that has clamped off his breath, that is dragging him
irresistibly backward. Yellow hands clutch Red Finger's ankles; he
crashes to the ground. Odon is swarming over him, wrests the gun
from his grip, coils and knots a long, strong cord about the
American's wrists and his ankles. Quick, uncouth words crackle from
his lips and a third form of mystery comes out of the shadows,
chuckling.</p>

<p>"Checkmate this time, my dear Red Finger," the Asiatic pants, as
he loosens the garroting filament from the other's neck and rises
to look gloatingly down at his helpless adversary. A gray mask
dangles from his long fingers. "Or shall I call you&mdash;Ford
Duane, dealer in second-hand books?" His utterance is clipped,
precise, only that odd hiss reveals that he is using an alien
tongue.</p>

<p>Duane, arms and legs lashed, weaponless, in the power of his
implacable enemy, looked up and smiled. "My felicitations, Baron
Odon." His blue eyes, murky now with defeat and despair, peered
past the Asiatic to the other, the one who had so skillfully
garroted him in the very moment of his seeming victory. He saw a
swarthy, Italianate face; thick lips twisted in a grin that still
had something of the ingratiating quality of the psuedo-beggar's
smile, the beggar whose flute had skirled a cryptic invitation to
die. "You fooled me neatly."</p>

<p>Odon bowed with the exaggerated politeness of oriental
etiquette. "Not any more neatly than you have fooled me, so many
times. But you were handicapped by the inferiority of your race.
When I made up my mind to concentrate upon removing you it was
impossible for me to fail."</p>

<p>Except for his eyes, the counter-spy's countenance revealed only
interest in the master-stroke of a skilled antagonist. "How did you
manage it? Only T knew who I was. He was always himself the
messenger, and we used a different code each time."</p>

<p>"Your scheme had a fatal weakness. T is the head of your
Intelligence Service. Others as well as you report to him and they
are not all as skillful. I detected one, fed him information,
watched him till he slipped once in communicating with your Chief.
Then T himself came under my scrutiny&mdash;the rest was easy."</p>

<p>Red Finger shrugged. "Well, you win, Odon. This time. But there
are others, always there will be others till <i>you</i> slip in
your turn. We do not live long, we who fight the invisible
war."</p>

<p>"No," the oriental's voice was very low. "We do not live long,
and no tears are shed when we die. But tears are shed while we
live, many tears. Look!" He stooped. When he rose, the tube of
green death was again in his hand, open. "You die tonight; tomorrow
there will be mourning in your nation. But not for you, my friend,
not for you alone." His arm snapped, whiplike. An emerald stream
arced through the moonshine, splashed into the reservoir, was gone.
"The stuff is heavy, Duane, it sinks to the bottom where the
currents are swift. In an hour it will be in the mains, by morning
a hundred thousand housewives will sniff a faint odor in their
cooking and wonder whether they have failed to clean their pots
well enough. By night... Wherever you are by tonight you will be
welcoming others, many others to those Golden Streets of which your
priests prate."</p>
<br>

<p class="first">DUANE'S face was white against the silver sands,
white even to the lips, but his eyes blazed fury. "You fiend!" he
gritted. "You unspeakable thing! God&mdash;your God and
mine&mdash;will damn you forever for that!"</p>

<p>Odon's smile was blind. "My God will reward me with the sight of
streets strewn with the corpses of white-faced menials who make way
for the inheritors of His earth... But I have no more time for
you... Tony&mdash;the knife!"</p>

<p>The swart renegade to his race stepped forward, a blade
glittered bluely as he bent, caught the light as it swept down,
straight to Duane's bared throat. The American was suddenly doubled
up in a jack-knife. Folding almost too swift for the eye to follow,
his bound legs lashed out, his heels plunked into the stabber's
groin. An agonized shriek split the silence, the Italian lifted to
the tremendous impetus of that unexpected, two-heeled kick,
catapulted across the strand and writhed, prostrate on the
beach.</p>

<p>Duane was rolling, his new motion continuous with that which had
laid the Italian low, toward the startled Oriental. Before Odon
quite realized what had happened, Ford thudded against his legs.
The Asiatic toppled, his hand flashing to a pocket even as he fell,
coming out with a flat, black automatic. A shot blazed orange flame
into sand. Duane flipped a back-somersault, came incredibly to his
feet for an instant, hurled himself headfirst at Odon. Another shot
spat flatly, pounded sickeningly into flesh. Ford's skull thumped
against Odon's chin. He whipped about and his teeth were sunk into
the other's gun hand. Blood spurted over his lips; his head
twisted, bone snapped and the automatic span away across pebbles,
plopped into water.</p>

<p>Odon's left arm came up and over Duane's shoulder, long yellow
fingers slid along Ford's neck, searching for that spot behind the
ear where life comes near the surface, at the mercy of a probing
thumb. The maelstrom of combat split as Duane whirled away from the
fatal jab. Again he launched into a flashing backward flip that
brought him erect, bound as he was. His knees bent, his thigh
muscles exploded, and he was leaping, almost flying, through the
air. His heels crashed against Odon's chest, he jarred down on his
spine, whirled over to meet his antagonist.</p>

<p>And lay still, gasping for breath, as he saw that the Asiatic
was quite motionless at the water's edge, his thin, cruel lips
edged by a red foam.</p>

<p>A hot iron bored into Duane's shoulder, where Odon's bullet had
struck. His body was one huge ache and his lungs felt as though
flames seared them. Blood dribbled from cuts at his wrists, at his
ankles, where the cords had cut deep during the almost miraculous
acrobatics by which he, even though tightly bound, had vanquished
two armed men. Ford's smoldering glance sought the other, the
Italian who would have knifed him at the command of the spy. He was
gone. He must have run away as soon as the first paralyzing effect
of the blow he had received had passed. Well, hirelings are rarely
faithful. But he had left his knife, there at the water's edge.
After awhile, Duane thought dazedly, he could crawl to that knife
and get free.</p>

<p>Then Red Finger saw a thick glass cylinder half-buried in the
sand, empty now except for a few green drops that still clung to
its lips. He groaned. That emerald liquid was at the bottom of the
reservoir, being carried slowly toward the huge pipes that would
split, and split again till their final branching would bring death
into the very homes of New York's millions. An hour, Odon had said.
An hour! How long was it since then? How much time was there
left?</p>
<br>

<p class="first">THE parked cars were gone from the huge plaza
below Kensico Dam. It was late, very late, and in the stone
gatehouse atop the great wall Tim O'Hara drowsed in his cushioned
chair and thought of the corned-beef and cabbage Kitty would have
ready for him when he got home in the morning. This was a cushy
job, he thought, watching those big valves that could shut-off the
water from the city at a click-over of this switch that was wide
across as a man's head. Made a man feel like somebody, knowing he
could make a big city thirsty just by a twist of his wrist. Not
that Tim had ever had occasion to click the switch in the five
years since the boss had got him the job, nor he wouldn't in five
more years. But he could if he wanted to...</p>

<p>Tim O'Hara rubbed his eyes and settled lower on his spine. Time
for forty winks before he had to go-around with his oil-squirter
and bit of waste. <i>What was that?</i></p>

<p>Running feet thudded on stone outside. Someone was pounding on
the big oak door that shut out the curious from the gate-house.
"Open up!" a muffled voice came through the wood. "Open up in
there!"</p>

<p>Tim got heavily to his feet. "Who is it?" he called. "Who wants
in?"</p>

<p>"Open, damn you!" The fellow, whoever he was, was mush-mouthed
for all his yelling. Some drunk from Valhalla, mebbe, raising hell.
Well, Tim would put a flea in his ear and send him away damn quick.
The gate-tender picked up a huge spanner, limbered across the
concrete floor under the tremendous gleaming circles of the
hand-wheels that could be used to raise or lower the gates to the
big mains if for some reason the motors did not function. He got to
the door, got his hand on its knob, swung the portal open.</p>

<p>"What the hell&mdash;", he began, and stopped, open-mouthed at
the spectacle that presented itself. The head of the man outside
lolled against the door sash to which he clung with clack-gloved
hands that were muddy, ripped. His face was scratched, streaked by
dried blood. His eyes were half-shut and what could be seen of them
was a bleary red. Some black rags hung from his shoulders, his
wrists were swollen to twice their size. One shoe was gone
entirely, the other blood-clotted. A green vine was twisted,
queerly exuberant, around his waist. One does not crash at top
speed through two miles of lightless underbrush and brambles with
impunity.</p>

<p>Duane looked dazedly at Tim's florid face. He mumbled something
unintelligible, pushed himself away from the lintel.
"Shut&mdash;shut off the water!"</p>

<p>O'Hara took a backward step, lifting his spanner. The man wasn't
drunk; he was stark, staring crazy. "Git away from here," he
grunted. "Before I crack you."</p>

<p>Ford's mouth twisted. "Listen, man. There's poison in the
reservoir. Poison!"</p>

<p>Tim spat on a calloused palm, took a firmer grip on his wrench.
"Poison is it? Oi'll poison yuhr skull to a pulp if you don't beat
it quick's your tootsies'll take you."</p>

<p>The counter-spy's glance slid over O'Hara's bulking shoulder,
saw a clock against the wall. Its hands made a narrow V at the top
of the dial. One o'clock. The hour was up, or almost so. "Oh God!
Will you show some sense? Half New York will die tomorrow if you
don't throw the switch at once."</p>

<p>"There's one guy thot's goin' to wish he' dead in about tin
seconds," O'Hara bellowed, and lunged at the intruder. The spanner
whistled through the air, crashed against the doorpost as Duane
dipped in a sudden crouch. He came up within the long, simian arms
of the gateman, came up with his fist flailing. Smack! It caught
O'Hara flush on the button. Tim's eyes glazed, he reeled,
dropped.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">DUANE shook his own head to clear away the gray
mists welling up in his tired brain, shuffled into the station. A
vertical slab of bluish stone was studded with bare-poled switches.
At its very center, the biggest pair of copper studs was neatly
labelled: <small>OPEN-MAIN-MOTORS-SHUT</small>. It took every ounce
of energy he had left to stagger to the switchboard, to get his
fingers around the black handle of that biggest switch and pull it
down, thrust it home.</p>

<p>A dim hum, somewhere beneath the floor, rose to a roar. The
building vibrated to the whirling of gigantic armatures, laboring
to close down the watergates, to shut-off the poisoned water from
the people twenty miles away.</p>

<p>He must rest now... rest...</p>

<p>Then he heard leather tap on stone at the door behind him!
Odon's squat form, his blood-smeared, yellow countenance was framed
in the doorway, the leveled automatic in the Asiatic's left
hand.</p>

<p>Duane put his own hand out, found the back of Tim's chair, held
himself erect by holding on to it. Below his feet a muffled,
enormous thud pounded, and the motor-hum stopped. "You're too late,
Odon," he said. "The water's shut off."</p>

<p>There was no humor in the spy's thin-lipped smile. "It can be
turned on again." He slithered softly across the floor, edging
toward the switchboard, pivoting around the black muzzle of his gun
that was fixed unwaveringly on Duane's belly. His right hand was
twisted, brown with blood, but it lifted behind him, lifted
unerringly to the handle of the main switch, tugged to bring it
over, to open the gates to the green death. Blue lightning crackled
as copper bars pulled out of the studs marked: <small>SHUT</small>,
as the switch wheeled over to enter those marked:
<small>OPEN</small>...</p>

<p>And Duane's arm swept up. The gatekeeper's chair came up with
it, hurtled across the narrow space between spy and counter-spy,
crashed against the Asiatics head, crashed it against the
switch.</p>

<p>A thousand volts of blue lightning fizzed, crackled, roared
through human flesh. Black smoke misted the light in the gatehouse,
and the acrid aroma of charred meat was pungent in the little
chamber. That which had been Hayashura Odon, Baron of a distant
Eastern nation, master <i>saboteur</i>, pitched to the floor.</p>

<p>Ford Duane staggered, retched with nausea, and tumbled atop him.
But in the gate-house on Kensico Dam, the motors did not roar
again. And when the police that O'Hara would call should come and
arouse Red Finger, certain muttered words, the furtive showing of a
secret sign, would set him free to dive into his lair once more,
there to lick his wounds against the time when again his country
should have need of him.</p>
