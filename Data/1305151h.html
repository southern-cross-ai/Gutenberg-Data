  <h3>I. &mdash; THE WOMAN IN THE VEIL</h3>

  <p class="first">A DOZEN boisterous voices greeted the young soldier who
  stood smiling in the big vestibule of Lord Mortimer's house in Grosvenor
  Square.</p>

  <p>He had come through the swing doors unannounced, a fine stalwart figure of
  youth in the uniform of the Flying Corps, and was handing his British warm to
  a servant when his aunt hailed him from the head of the majestic
  stairway.</p>

  <p>Lady Mortimer came fluttering down the stairs to greet him, and there was
  no mistaking the welcome in her face.</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, I am so glad you could come. When we heard of the tremendous
  work the Flying Corps was doing we despaired of seeing you."</p>

  <p>"I told the skipper it was your birthday party, auntie, and he gave me
  leave," laughed Tom Broadwood as he kissed her.</p>

  <p>They clustered round him, a noisy, laughing, admiring throng of boys and
  girls he had known from their pinafore days. Eager young faces lifted to his,
  a dozen dance-cards were thrust at him, with base and reckless invitation to
  scratch out any initials he wished and substitute his own. He waved them off
  in mock terror and taking his aunt's arm mounted to the big ball-room.</p>

  <p>Tom Broadwood was a child of fortune, unspoilt. An orphan and the heir of
  Morgan Broadwood's millions, he had left Oxford and joined up at the first
  hint of war. He had served as a private at the defence of Ypres, and later
  had his commission, first as an officer in a Lancashire regiment and later in
  the Corps of corps.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to talk with you, Aunt Selina," he said, when at last he had
  piloted her to the deserted library.</p>

  <p>"You have made me very unpopular with quite a number of people who want to
  meet you," she chided him.</p>

  <p>Lady Mortimer was a woman of forty-five, who retained much of the beauty
  which Sargent had rendered imperishable in his Academy picture of 1901. She
  looked down at Tom as he sank into a deep chair and handed him a silver
  cigarette box.</p>

  <p>"Selina," he said&mdash;he never called her "aunt" when they were
  alone&mdash;"I wanted to tell you that I have fixed up things with my
  solicitors, so that if anything happens to me in France my money and property
  go to your two boys; the work I am doing now is particularly dangerous."</p>

  <p>"More than usual?" she asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"The fact is I have been in the Special Intelligence Department for
  months. I have been in Germany three times lately."</p>

  <p>She gasped.</p>

  <p>"Tom!"</p>

  <p>"Usually I am dropped from an aeroplane; sometimes I take my own machine,
  but that is for short work. Next week I am going over on rather a hazardous
  mission. That was one of the reasons I came home to see you. I want to put my
  estate in trim for your boys."</p>

  <p>She nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"Please God they will never inherit the money," she said quietly. "I look
  forward to the day when you will have a son of your own."</p>

  <p>"That sounds queer to me," he laughed. "I've never met the girl, and
  anyway I have to tell you this: I have asked Gretton&mdash;he's my
  solicitor&mdash;to come along and see you when I've gone and give you a full
  account of my interests. You are the only relative I have in the world."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I'm not," she smiled mischievously; "that's the fun of it&mdash;and that
  is why I wanted to parade you around. You have an unique opportunity of
  meeting a second cousin."</p>

  <p>"A second cousin! I didn't know... what is its name?"</p>

  <p>"Dawn Marsh."</p>

  <p>He pulled a little face.</p>

  <p>"Is it masculine or feminine?"</p>

  <p>"Very much feminine! She's unique&mdash;a product of the century."</p>

  <p>"O lor'!!" exclaimed Tom dismally; "that means she's neurotic or drinks
  cocktails and admires Morris dances, and has red hair and a soul!"</p>

  <p>His aunt smiled mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"You shall see. She's the daughter of a cousin&mdash;Tom Marsh was in the
  Consular service and poor&mdash;lost all his money in South African Mines and
  developed a taste for art. The girl was educated in Paris, Munich, and some
  other weird place, and I'm sure would be the most intelligent being in the
  world if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you shall judge. I confess I don't like sporty girls or doggy girls
  or Amazon girls, and I do like them to be feminine&mdash;but the droopy,
  snoopy girl who must wear a dressing robe that harmonises with the bath
  mat&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, she's that kind, is she? Where did she spring from?" asked Tom. "I
  don't seem to have heard of her before."</p>

  <p>"America. She's Californian by preferences though British by birth."</p>

  <p>Tom rose.</p>

  <p>"You pique my curiosity. How does she live if she's so poor?"</p>

  <p>Lady Mortimer shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows&mdash;that is a mystery. She has a suite at the
  Ritz-Carlton, she travels in style, dresses like a queen&mdash;and Tom Marsh
  left exactly three hundred pounds to meet ten thousand pounds worth of
  liabilities."</p>

  <p>Tom laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"Lead me to this financial genius," he said.</p>

  <p>So Tom Broadwood came to the presence of Dawn Marsh in a spirit of amused
  interest. He saw her and his amusement died&mdash;but his interest multiplied
  at an amazing rate.</p>

  <p>She sat on a large crimson settee in one of the alcoves of the ball- room
  annexe. A young man, faultlessly attired, sat by her side, but Tom had no
  eyes but for the girl. She was, he judged, above medium height. What she wore
  he could never describe. It was a delicate material of creamy white, and
  there were touches of black and gold on the dress and a bandeau of black and
  gold in her hair. He classified her peculiar beauty by his elastic and
  limited standard as something between a Gibson and a Kirchner girl. The face
  was healthily and delicately pale, the eyes big and set wide apart, the lips
  full and crimson, the nose and chin well moulded.</p>

  <p>She looked up at him steadfastly and with a certain interest which was
  childlike in its unfeigned curiosity.</p>

  <p>"This is your second cousin, Dawn&mdash;Torn Broadwood," said Lady
  Mortimer, and she raised her coal-black eyebrows with a little smile of
  pleasure.</p>

  <p>"I have heard of you&mdash;the slayer of Flying Men," she said. Her voice
  was a soft contralto, distinct despite its drawl. "Sit down, Aunt
  Selina."</p>

  <p>"I must go&mdash;I have been neglecting everybody shamefully. I will see
  you, Tom, before you leave."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>The apparition of this girl had momentarily silenced him. He thought he
  had never seen anything so lovely.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, won't you, Tom," she invited; "you know Count Stopl&mdash;don't
  fight, please; the count is Swedish and we aren't at war with Sweden," she
  laughed.</p>

  <p>The man, who had risen, smiled politely, but it struck Tom that he was not
  pleased. He was young and decidedly good-looking, though the trim moustache
  was set over a square jaw and hid lips which, were they exposed might have
  detracted something from his pleasing appearance.</p>

  <p>"Miss Marsh is joking, always joking&mdash;but always charming," he said,
  with a click of heels; "for myself I never can fathom the gracious Miss
  Marsh, though often I have had the surpassing honour of meeting her."</p>

  <p>"The count is terribly curious," she said, with a sidelong smile at her
  companion, "and yet is so polite. Confess, count, you have been questioning
  and cross-questioning me for two dances."</p>

  <p>"My dear lady!" said the shocked nobleman; "never! I would die before such
  a rudeness! Is it wonderful, Mr. Broadwood, that all mademoiselle's interests
  are of first importance to her friends?"&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders
  despairingly&mdash;"I but ask you if you ride, if you walk, if you play golf
  or tennis?"</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry, count," she interrupted; "you take me so seriously, and
  really I am not a very serious person."</p>

  <p>She turned to Tom.</p>

  <p>"The count was so good to me on the voyage. I am sure if we had met a
  U-boat he would have vouched for my respectability."</p>

  <p>The count smiled and bowed.</p>

  <p>"If I have your permission I will take my leave," he said; "I have
  arranged to meet a compatriot. Does mademoiselle leave for New York
  soon?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," said the girl, "and if you ever come to California won't you
  come and see me?"</p>

  <p>"I will give myself that pleasure and happiness."</p>

  <p>She watched him as he retired and there was neither regret nor relief in
  that steady gaze.</p>

  <p>"Now, cousin," she said, turning suddenly to the young man, "promise me
  you won't ask me if I ride or walk or box."</p>

  <p>"I can promise you that," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"And confess that you have never heard of me before to-night," she
  challenged.</p>

  <p>"It is unpardonable of me," said Tom, "but I never have."</p>

  <p>She looked at him from under her lowered lashes and laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"You are not staying long in London?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Neither are you, they tell me," she replied. "I shall be glad to go out
  of it. The life here is too strenuous. I was intended for Arcadian
  surroundings, mossy banks, shady bowers and fluting shepherds."</p>

  <p>"With two French maids and a manicurist," he added, and she laughed.</p>

  <p>"Some day I will build a house where you press buttons and electricity
  does the rest. Don't you hate work and hustle, Cousin Tom?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say that I do," said Tom, "but I have not had much
  experience."</p>

  <p>"And now you are going to war, which is the hardest work of all
  "&mdash;she shivered; "it's all very horrible and unpleasant and crude and
  elemental," she said.</p>

  <p>Tom had recovered from the awe which she had inspired in him, but he still
  retained that curiously irritating feeling that he was in the presence of a
  superior force, mental and, strangely enough, physical.</p>

  <p>"I was awfully surprised to hear you don't ride," he said.</p>

  <p>"I don't ride from choice," she agreed, "and it's perfectly true that golf
  doesn't interest me. The fact is," she laughed, "I am constitutionally lazy.
  I need my French maids and my manicurist and my chauffeur and secretary. They
  are the necessities of life just as a cup of tea is to the girl in the
  government office. You are disappointed, aren't you?" she said suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Why, no," replied Tom; "only my theory is that everybody should
  work."</p>

  <p>"I will buy a laundry to-morrow," she said, "and you shall come and see me
  every Saturday and collect your shirts."</p>

  <p>"You are laughing at me, and I am afraid I am impertinent," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"I don't exactly know what work a girl can do except keep house," she
  suggested; "a woman s place you know, is the home."</p>

  <p>"Some women's places" he said boldly, "are those rosy bowers and mossy
  banks of yours, and they would look oddly foreign in any other
  environment."</p>

  <p>"If that is intended for a compliment I thank you," she said gravely.
  "Would you pick up my dance programme? It is lying within three inches of my
  hand and I haven't been able to summon sufficient energy&mdash;thank you. It
  has been worrying me for the last half-hour, and I dare not tell the count
  lest be grovelled on the floor and picked it up between his teeth."</p>

  <p>They both laughed together.</p>

  <p>"Now you are dying to go away," she said, "but I won't let you till
  someone comes. I know you are only making a flying visit to Town, but I am
  intensely selfish. I know hundreds of people want to see you, but they must
  be patient till I have finished with you. Will you please call that
  waiter&mdash;I want an ice&mdash;and could you reach over and pick up my
  shawl? You see I like being waited upon."</p>

  <p>Tom was amused. This was a new type to him and not unpleasant. He supposed
  that in course of time the novelty would pall, and the naked selfishness and
  helplessness of the girl would irritate him, but for the time being it was
  all very charming, and when at last her partner came to claim her he took
  farewell with regret.</p>

  <p>"Please write to me from France," she said; "You know my place at
  Mollinos."</p>

  <p>He thought of the late Tom Marsh and his three hundred pounds' estate and
  wondered.</p>

  <p>She laid her cool palm in his and for a second or so her splendid eyes
  held him. They seemed to search his mind, his very soul. Then:</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Cousin Tom. Remember to write. Don't tell me horrible
  things&mdash;how many Germans you have killed; and please, please don't tell
  me of your sufferings or your privations because I am awfully sensitive!"</p>

  <p>He found himself that night standing outside Lord Mortimer's house,
  looking up at the lighted windows of the upper floors, speculating upon which
  of those rosy curtains shut out the world from this dainty and fragrant
  lady.</p>

  <p>It was half-past twelve, and he had arranged to spend the night in the
  flat of an old Oxford friend, now a silver badge man working for the Red
  Cross.</p>

  <p>London has a charm of its own and, declining the use of Lady Mortimer's
  car, he strolled aimlessly in the direction of his lodging. He called in at
  his club and wrote a few letters, met a man of his squadron on leave, who
  delayed him at a street corner whilst Tom retailed the latest news from the
  Front, and it was nearly two o'clock when he set forth in earnest to discover
  his friend's flat.</p>

  <p>Like every Londoner, he did not know his London very well, though the West
  End is very difficult to lose yourself in. Nevertheless he found himself in a
  poor quarter of the town, without any idea as to where he was wandering or in
  which way he could reach Portland Place.</p>

  <p>He was in a street of mean tenements when his adventure occurred. The door
  of one of the houses opened and a woman walked down the steps, crossed the
  road diagonally and in a direction which eventually brought her to the same
  sidewalk and ahead of Tom.</p>

  <p>She might be unaware of his presence in the street, for he wore rubber
  protectors on his field boots, and certainly she gave no indication that she
  knew she was being followed.</p>

  <p>At the corner of one of the cross streets she stopped suddenly, and Tom
  crossed the roadway so that he need not pass her. He thought possibly she had
  seen him and stopped to speak to him, and he had no particular desire for
  conversation.</p>

  <p>He was half-way across to the opposite side walk when he saw he was
  mistaken. A man was approaching her furtively, and presently she spoke to
  him. Tom saw the newcomer take something from his pocket, a package of some
  kind, and hand it to the girl&mdash;and at that moment came a diversion.</p>

  <p>From the shadows sprang another man, and Tom saw that it was a policeman.
  Where be came from, what secret hiding-place, the young soldier could only
  guess.</p>

  <p>Without a word the policeman sprang upon the man, and Tom saw his
  truncheon rise and fall, and his victim collapse with an ominous limpness.
  Tom stood watching, a frown of indecision on his face. He knew that the blow
  which felled this wretched wanderer of the night was struck with no ordinary
  club. He knew, too, that English policemen do not ordinarily use their
  truncheons except in moments of peril.</p>

  <p>Instinctively he realised that the man on the ground was dead. The
  policeman seized the girl by the arm and then, for the first time, he
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Your <i>coup</i> did not develop as you hoped," he said.</p>

  <p>She answered him in a low tone.</p>

  <p>"And nobody suspected it," he sneered. "I alone dared doubt you&mdash;all
  your plans, all your&mdash;"</p>

  <p>What followed passed so swiftly that Tom had not taken half a dozen swift
  strides toward them when the thing was done.</p>

  <p>He saw the policeman seize the woman, caught the flash of steel, and saw
  her wrench herself free. The man stooped to spring, and at that moment a
  quivering thread of flame leapt from the woman's band, the crash of a report
  woke the echoes of the silent streets, and the policeman staggered, swayed,
  and fell.</p>

  <p>At that moment Tom reached them.</p>

  <p>"What have you done?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>He could not see the face, hidden behind a thick veil, but he saw in the
  light of a street standard that she was dressed in black from head to foot,
  and the figure was that of a girl.</p>

  <p>The hand that held the pistol was bare and the space between thumb and
  forefinger was black with the back-fire of the automatic.</p>

  <p>This he saw; then:</p>

  <p>"Stand back!" She waved him off with the weapon, then turning, she flew
  swiftly.</p>

  <p>He started in pursuit, but remembered the fallen policeman and turned
  back. Other feet were running and she would probably meet the constable on
  the next block. He had nearly reached the fallen policeman when he saw
  something lying on the ground and stooped to pick it up. It was a thin, flat
  piece of white ivory the size of a five-shilling piece, and it bore a rough
  resemblance to an eagle with outstretched wings. On its surface and burnt
  into the ivory were the ciphers "395" and the letters "K.I."</p>

  <p>He slipped the "bone" into his pocket and was stooping over the dead
  officer when two other policemen arrived.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" said one.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid one of your men has been shot."</p>

  <p>"One of our men?" said the policeman who wore the chevrons of a sergeant;
  "what is one of our men doing here? He's dead enough," he said, after a
  cursory examination. "Do you know this man, Constable Smith?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the other.</p>

  <p>Torn looked over their heads as they unbuttoned the man's coat.</p>

  <p>"Why," exclaimed one of the policemen in surprise, "he's in evening
  dress!"</p>

  <p>He had flung back the uniform overcoat and disclosed the glazed shirt-
  front and the white waistcoat. Over the heart was a little red patch where
  the bullet had struck.</p>

  <p>Tom leant down closer and received his second shock.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;" he said.</p>

  <p>"Do you know him?" asked the policeman.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know him," said Tom quietly; "his name is Count Stopl, and he is a
  friend of Lord Mortimer's."</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour later he was ringing the bell of the darkened house
  be had left before midnight. His aunt came down in her wrap. Briefly Tom
  narrated the events of the past crowded hour, and Lady Mortimer shook her
  head pityingly.</p>

  <p>"The poor boy! I must go up and tell Dawn."</p>

  <p>She left the room and was gone ten minutes. When she returned she was
  accompanied by the girl, who looked radiantly lovely in a flowered silk
  dressing-gown. She had, apparently, been roused from her slumbers, for her
  hair had been hastily stuffed under a boudoir cap.</p>

  <p>She listened in silence whilst Tom told the story.</p>

  <p>"It is all very dreadful," she said; "and now for the second time, Cousin
  Tom, good-night."</p>

  <p>He took her hand in his and held it, looking down till she snatched it
  back from him.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," he said, and went back to the police station to spend the
  time when he should have been sleeping making a signed statement of the crime
  he had witnessed, all the time conscious of the knowledge that between the
  thumb and the finger of Dawn's right hand was that little black splash of
  powder which an automatic pistol makes when it throws back.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>II. &mdash; LITTLE HELL</h3>

  <p class="first">THE Chief Intelligence Officer of the 16th British Army
  looked up as Captain Tom Broadwood entered his bureau.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Broadwood, for a moment," he said with a smile; "I won't keep
  you long."</p>

  <p>He finished signing the papers before him, and as his clerk was going he
  said:</p>

  <p>"Sergeant Lorring, I am not to be interrupted, and see that body comes
  near that door."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the non-com and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Colonel Waterson leant forward, his elbows on his desk, and dropped his
  voice:</p>

  <p>"Broadwood, I shall want you to leave to-morrow night&mdash;are you
  ready?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," smiled Tom. "I have been ready for a fortnight, ever since I
  came back from leave."</p>

  <p>"Oh, by the way," a thought struck the Intelligence Officer, "that man
  Stopl whose end you witnessed in London&mdash;he has been identified."</p>

  <p>"Identified?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he wasn't a count, you know, and his name wasn't Stopl. His real
  name was Brakzand, and he was known to the American police as a particularly
  dangerous German agent."</p>

  <p>"But he moved in good society. Surely the Swedish Embassy would have
  exposed him?"</p>

  <p>"It was difficult. You see, there was a Count Stopl who died in some
  outlandish place in South America. He had no relations who knew him or
  anything of him. When the spurious Stopl turned up in London, he was
  accepted. He had plenty of money and apparently knew all the best people in
  American society. But he was undoubtedly a bitter enemy of Britain. That is
  by the way. I thought you would be interested. They have not found the woman
  who killed him, but the general theory is that she also was a German spy who
  had quarrelled with him."</p>

  <p>Tom's face was thoughtful. He had been trying to forget things in the past
  fortnight&mdash;trying to forget a pair of the loveliest eyes in the world,
  and a hand which had been blackened by the back-throw of an automatic
  pistol.</p>

  <p>"You know quite a lot about the matter, colonel," was all he said.</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm supposed to know something about spies," he said grimly, and went on
  with the business in hand. "You have had all the instructions you want about
  your present job? Good. I will repeat the important points. In the uniform of
  a private of the Royal Air Force you will take a machine&mdash;an obsolete
  one, which will give you about 180 miles' range&mdash;leaving late to-night.
  You will make your landing near the prison camp at Ingolsberg, burn your
  machine, and surrender to the prison camp authorities. Between now and next
  Monday we shall plant a machine for you in a barn which was erected by one of
  our agents for the purpose at the farm called Halle Stadt, which looks out on
  to a lonely bit of moorland. Whilst you are at the farm you are to discover
  the identity of the Baroness von Zimmermann, a friend of the commandant's and
  a frequent visitor."</p>

  <p>"How long do I remain a prisoner?" asked Tom glumly.</p>

  <p>The colonel smiled.</p>

  <p>"You will escape when you receive orders from Parry to get away."</p>

  <p>"Parry? Who is Parry?"</p>

  <p>"That is the name of a mysterious somebody who needs your help. I confess
  I don't know Mr. Parry&mdash;whether be is young or old, tall or fat, bearded
  or clean-shaven."</p>

  <p>"It's a mysterious stunt, sir," said Tom. "I can't say I like the prisoner
  of war idea."</p>

  <p>"You don't want to go?" asked the colonel quickly.</p>

  <p>"Go, sir! Why, of course I'll go&mdash;only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The colonel nodded.</p>

  <p>"Unsatisfactory, eh? Well, that's just how it struck me."</p>

  <p>Tom left the aerodrome early the next morning riding an old "pusher" bus,
  which had this advantage, that if it was slow it was sure. He carried no arms
  and no other bomb than the incendiary bomb which was to ignite the
  machine.</p>

  <p>He passed over the line, heavily shelled, though he had avoided the more
  sensitive spots in the enemy's defensive systems and crossed the broad steel
  ribbon of the Rhine an hour before dawn.</p>

  <p>He found Ingolsberg&mdash;sighted its forbidding laager in the grey hours
  of a raw morning, and came down calmly within a hundred yards of an old and
  astonished sentry, who blinked through full-moon spectacles, and did not
  realise that he was witnessing a manifestation of war until the aeroplane
  burst into red flame and a good-looking young man in the unfamiliar uniform
  walked across to him and said:</p>

  <p>"I am British."</p>

  <p>An hour later, with a palpitating sentry on either side of him, he met,
  for the first time, the Prussian officer of tradition. Hitherto the Germans
  he had met&mdash;mostly on the right side of the British line&mdash;had been
  courteous. Now he was to meet, not the fighting soldier, but the military
  politician, the martinet of the theoretic school, a soldier who had not as
  yet experienced the humanising effect of battle.</p>

  <p>Colonel Heyderbrand was a man of fifty-six, lean, straight, and wasp-
  waisted. His hair and trim moustache were white, his face otherwise being
  clean shaven.</p>

  <p>He sat at his table, a long cigar between teeth which were suspiciously
  white and regular for so old a man, and surveyed the prisoner.</p>

  <p>"English?" he asked harshly.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Say 'sir,' you swine!"</p>

  <p>Tom did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Where did you come from, and why did you land?"</p>

  <p>"Went astray in the night and finished my petrol."</p>

  <p>"Say 'sir,' damn you!"</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>The colonel's face flushed red.</p>

  <p>"I will teach you... yes, by God, I'll teach you! Take him away,
  <i>Feldwebel</i>."</p>

  <p>So Tom Broadwood was bundled from the room and was turned loose in a great
  wired cage to wait his captor's pleasure.</p>

  <p>And here it was that he met that remarkable man, Dusty Miller. He stood
  stiffly erect, his back to a pole, and his constancy in that position was due
  less to an ingrained respect for authority than three separate sets of straps
  which bound him there.</p>

  <p>The brown face was small and rugged, the mouth big and whimsical, and his
  blue eyes ranged his restricted field of vision with hope and expectancy. He
  whistled a little tune in slow time&mdash;a melancholy tune, suggestive of
  partings and weeping mothers and flower-strewn graves, and ever and anon
  exchanged an unfriendly word with the sentry who marched within insulting
  distance.</p>

  <p>Tom approached the scene in wonder and wrath. It hurt his manhood to see a
  fellow-man treated like cattle; it stung a certain pride in the common
  ancestry which he and the prisoner shared.</p>

  <p>As for the bound man, he ceased whistling when the other approached and
  eyed him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Ostraylian?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Tom smiled and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Flying Corps," he said.</p>

  <p>The man's blue eyes opened wide.</p>

  <p>"A pilot&mdash;a fightin' pilot? How many of the perishers did you 'out'
  before they pinched you?"</p>

  <p>"Three or four," and the soldier beamed.</p>

  <p>"Say 'forty' an' cheer me up," he begged.</p>

  <p>The sentry approached with a frown.</p>

  <p>"You must not speak to the prisoner whilst he is undergoing 'strafe,'" he
  said in German.</p>

  <p>"Take no notice of 'im," begged the man at the pole. "Hector, I'm
  surprised at you intrudin' yourself between friends.
  Here&mdash;What's&mdash;your&mdash;name?"</p>

  <p>"Broadwood&mdash;Thomas Broadwood," laughed Tom.</p>

  <p>"You're either Tommy or Broady&mdash;make up your mind."</p>

  <p>"Any old thing."</p>

  <p>"Well, Broady, I finish my 'strafe' today&mdash;come over to F.7 an' have
  a yarn," urged the man. "My name's Miller&mdash;commonly called 'Dusty.'"</p>

  <p>"What did you get this for?" Tom indicated the pole.</p>

  <p>"Escape," said the other laconically; "my ninth. I've had ten days of this
  an' twenty-one days 'strooben' arrest&mdash;that's German for 'dark hole an'
  little grub.' But the worst ain't much worse than the best in Little
  Hell."</p>

  <p>"Little Hell?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded and grinned.</p>

  <p>"Little Hell," he said with relish; "the one camp in Germany that no
  nootral ambassador ever visited. Every man here's a dog&mdash;an' treated
  like it. Nine escapes I've made, but I've got a better idea for my tenth
  escape. Here comes the <i>Feldwebel</i>," he muttered, "hop it!"</p>

  <p>And Tom "hopped it" in time to avoid meeting the martinet of the camp.</p>

  <p>It was not until the next afternoon that he met the cheerful little man,
  and then learnt that he was getting acquainted with one of the most famous
  men of Germany. For Dusty was an escape expert. He had been a prisoner since
  the battle of Mons and, as he said, had made a get-away nine times. Thrice he
  had been captured on the Dutch frontier, within sight of liberty, once on the
  Swiss frontier. He had employed a score of tricks and subterfuges, he had
  smuggled compasses and maps, files and wire-cutters, he had indeed broken
  every law governing the prisoner of war, and had suffered imprisonment in
  Cologne, Munster, Dresden, and Ingolsberg, to say nothing of minor terms of
  solitary confinement in local camps.</p>

  <p>The two men strolled across the recreation ground together and half a
  dozen watchful eyes followed them.</p>

  <p>"I've never had a pal who spoke German," explained Dusty; "if I had I'd
  have made an escape years an' years ago. I've been in these dam' laagers for
  a hundred an' fifty years an' six months, as a prisoner counts time. Now the
  question is, are you game?"</p>

  <p>Tom looked at the little man. The time might come when it would be
  necessary to get away and such a man as this might be useful.</p>

  <p>"I'll help you escape if you want to get away," he said steadily, "but for
  the time being I don't want to go myself."</p>

  <p>The little man stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Been bit by a shell or something?" he asked anxiously "don't want to get
  away?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," smiled Tom.</p>

  <p>"I've often thought I'd like to go to Monte Carlo," said Dusty loudly as a
  German non-commissioned officer in silent shoes overtook them; "I'm told it's
  rather a pretty little place, but a bit wild."</p>

  <p>When the officer had passed out of hearing Dusty spoke again.</p>

  <p>"You've got to be careful; some of these poor fellows talk English better
  than me an' you. Don't forget I'm watched&mdash;they search the room I sleep
  in three times a night. I'm so popular with the other fellows who have to
  turn out of bed in the cold an' be inspected that I expect to die young. But
  do you mean you'd help me hop it?"</p>

  <p>Tom nodded.</p>

  <p>"You said you had a plan," he said.</p>

  <p>"So I have. Listen. The commandant of this place is sweet on a
  girl&mdash;a Baroness."</p>

  <p>Tom started. He expected to have some trouble in learning things which
  were, apparently public property.</p>

  <p>"She comes here once a week to tea," Dusty went on; "every Thursday. She's
  the widder of a German officer, husband killed in the war, I'm sorry to
  say&mdash;lend me your handkerchief, I'm crying I&mdash;an' Commandant
  Heyderbrand is fairly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Crazy is the word you want."</p>

  <p>"Potty was the word I wanted, but yours will serve, Broady. They have tea
  in the commandant's quarters an' she drives up in a motor-car, which comes
  inside the wire of the camp an' is run into a stable alongside the quarters.
  My plan is this: we get into that stable an' hide in the car. it always goes
  out before my lady an' drives about a mile up the forest road an' waits, an'
  the silly old&mdash;our respected commandant strolls up with the girl to the
  spot. I've seen him do it."</p>

  <p>His chance had come within an hour of his arrival. Tom turned the
  proposition over in his mind.</p>

  <p>"How do you get to the stable?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There's only one way," explained Dusty, lowering his voice, for they had
  turned and were walking back to the huts; "there's a door from the
  commandant's quarters and his house can be reached through a tunnel me an' a
  feller named Golder dug the last time we was here&mdash;I was transferred to
  another camp before it could be used for another grand plan I had in
  connection with the commandant."</p>

  <p>"What was that?" asked Tom.</p>

  <p>"To cut his dam' throat," said the little man with such concentrated
  malignity that Tom shivered.</p>

  <p>The days dragged slowly, for life in Ingolsberg Laager was a dreary and
  wearisome thing. He was herded in a big hut with two hundred other men. The
  food was vile, the bread half sawdust and the mess which was called by
  courtesy "soup," wholly impossible.</p>

  <p>Every evening he drew as near as possible to the big gate, hoping that the
  woman would put in an appearance. He spent his nights conning his chief's
  instructions. Who was the mysterious Parry, the secret agent at whose word he
  must attempt escape, and in what manner would he make known his order?</p>

  <p>In a way the prison experience was interesting and helped pass the time of
  waiting. He was meeting, not for the first time&mdash;he had served as a
  private in the early days of the war&mdash;the working-class Englishman. At
  first he thought him a dull brute, whose language was deplorable; then he
  realised that the dullness was diffidence, the brutality a sort of rough
  philosophy. His language meant nothing, his threats of violence addressed to
  such of his comrades in misfortune as annoyed him less than nothing. Under
  the crudity of speech and manner Tommy was a sentimentalist, unswervingly
  loyal, and a great player of the game. It shocked him to hear them speak
  disrespectfully of the "Belgiums"&mdash;they never said "Belgians"&mdash;but
  he was to discover that the Flemish prisoners had the best time in camp and
  repaid the kindness showed them by their guards by a little unofficial
  espionage upon their fellows.</p>

  <p>He learnt that the French and the English were polite friends, but did not
  "mix," and that Tommy's greatest friend in adversity was the Russian soldier,
  "loyal and lousy," as an English N.C.O. described him. And be discovered why.
  The Russian was a child and Tommy was a child; it was the affinity between
  unsophistications.</p>

  <p>Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday passed and, to his relief, Dusty Miller made no
  attempt to approach him.</p>

  <p>On the Thursday occurred the extraordinary happening. He had gone to the
  cookhouse to stand in a long queue, with a basin in his hand, to receive his
  midday "soup." The mixture was brown water, quite transparent, with a few
  scraps of vegetables floating on the surface.</p>

  <p>As he carried his ration back to the dining-hall be looked into the
  concoction&mdash;and almost dropped it. For, at the bottom, was an oblong
  slip of ivory and it bore the one word, which could be plainly read:</p>

  <p>"PARRY"</p>

  <p>He looked round to see if he were observed and fished the slip from the
  basin. He turned it over and read in microscopic writing</p>

  <p>"Be prepared to leave. Message will be delivered to you at Halle
  Stadt."</p>

  <p>That was all. In what manner he should leave was not suggested.</p>

  <p>That afternoon, when the bell had sounded for supper and the prisoners
  were moving from the recreation ground to their huts, Dusty strolled toward
  him.</p>

  <p>"Look, but don't take too much notice," he said, and jerked his head to
  the north side of the camp where the commandant's wooden house stood. Tom
  turned his eyes in the direction the other had indicated. A big limousine was
  standing before the house, the straight-backed colonel was bowing his
  greetings to a graceful woman who was at that moment alighting.</p>

  <p>"That's her," said Dusty, in a tone of proprietorship. "Would you like a
  bath?"</p>

  <p>"Would I what?" asked the startled Tom.</p>

  <p>"A bath?" said the other calmly; "we're allowed one between four an' six.
  There's the bath-room&mdash;that red hut. Stroll over an' turn on the tap;
  I'll be with you in a minute."</p>

  <p>Tom obeyed instructions, tingling with excitement. Had "Parry" arranged
  this? Was the little man himself Parry? No one challenged him as he made his
  way leisurely to the frame hut that served the prisoners for their ablutions.
  It was a roomy place, with a broad trough of running water in the centre, and
  in two corners were small cubicles. Tom had tubbed once that day but he knew
  he was expected for once to carry out orders.</p>

  <p>He turned the faucet, let the water splash into the big concrete basin
  that served as a bath, and it had run half full when he heard Dusty's quick
  step.</p>

  <p>"That's the wrong one. Come over here," whispered Miller;
  "quick&mdash;here's a knife; prize up that floor-board whilst I watch."</p>

  <p>The floor-board yielded easily, revealing a cavity of uncertain depth
  beneath.</p>

  <p>"Squeeze down and drop&mdash;I'll put back the board," said Miller;
  "hurry!"</p>

  <p>Tom struggled through the slit and, with some misgiving, let go. He fell
  only a few inches and presently his companion was at his side. The "champion
  escaper" deftly replaced the floor-board and presently Tom heard him strike a
  match.</p>

  <p>The light of the candle he lit showed they were in a roughly excavated pit
  about eight feet deep and four feet square. Against one side of the pit hung
  a ragged piece of sacking.</p>

  <p>"Just as we left it!" whispered Dusty in admiration.</p>

  <p>He pulled the canvas down and revealed the entrance of the tunnel. It was
  the size of a large drain-pipe, but the brief examination which Tom made
  showed that it had been scientifically constructed. It was supported by
  wooden props&mdash;pieces of wood filched from time to time by the amateur
  engineers and applied to the purpose with infinite labour.</p>

  <p>"It took eight of us three months to make it. I'll go first," said
  Dusty.</p>

  <p>He crawled into the entrance and Tom followed. The going was slow and
  laborious. He found himself unbearably hot and gasping for breath, for of
  ventilation there was little.</p>

  <p>After they had been crawling for twenty minutes&mdash;it seemed
  hours&mdash;the hollow voice of Dusty said:</p>

  <p>"Come up farther and stand up."</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Tom found he could stand erect and stretch his cramped
  and aching limbs.</p>

  <p>Dusty relit the candle. They were standing in a pit very much the same
  size as that into which they had dropped half an hour before, with this
  exception, that one of the pit sides was faced with brick.</p>

  <p>Dusty took a chisel from his pocket, searched for something in the wall,
  and then gently pressed the edge of the chisel into what appeared to be
  mortar.</p>

  <p>"Soap an' sand," he whispered hoarsely, "me an' Nobby Clark opened this
  wall the day before they shifted us to another camp."</p>

  <p>Working rapidly, he removed brick after brick, Tom crouching by his side
  holding the candle. Presently a hole was made big enough to pass through, and
  again Dusty led the way.</p>

  <p>They were in a cellar, well stocked with wine and beer. A flight of steps
  led up to a trap-door and Dusty removed his boots.</p>

  <p>"Get yours off, Broady," he said, "climb that ladder while I'm puttin'
  these bricks back an' push up the trap&mdash;there's nobody there or we
  should hear 'em. I tried but I ain't strong enough."</p>

  <p>Tom mounted the steps and pushed gingerly upward. The trap yielded
  slightly. He pressed harder, putting forth all his strength, and he heard a
  soft rustle as something slid down the inclined surface of the trap. He
  listened but there was no sound from the room and he pushed open the trap
  without difficulty and climbed into a room which was evidently used as a
  forage store, for it had been a sack of oats lying on the trap which had made
  it so difficult to open.</p>

  <p>Dusty was by his side in a minute, the trap replaced, and the sack of oats
  returned to its position.</p>

  <p>Dusty tried the door and it opened. A brief reconnaissance and they
  emerged into a corridor, from which opened three doors, the one at the
  farther end of the passage which faced them being covered by a heavy velvet
  portière, and the others to the left and the right.</p>

  <p>"That's the one," whispered Dusty, indicating the left; "it leads into the
  garage."</p>

  <p>He moved forward and grasped the knob when a smothered exclamation from
  Tom stopped him.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" snarled the Cockney, turning.</p>

  <p>He saw Tom's eyes fixed upon the doorway at the end of the passage, and
  following the direction of their gaze he stood open-mouthed at what he saw,
  for a hand parted the curtains, a gloved hand, and it pointed urgently to the
  other door.</p>

  <p>Only for a moment was Tom paralysed, then, with two swift strides, he
  reached the portière and pulled the curtain aside. There was nobody there. He
  was confronted by a heavy oaken door which did not yield to his pressure.</p>

  <p>The little space between door and curtain held a delicate fragrance. It
  was a woman, then!</p>

  <p>He came back, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" urged Dusty in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Not that door. The hand pointed the other way," said Tom.</p>

  <p>They moved to the opposite door, turned the handle and pushed it open, and
  confronted Colonel Heyderbrand!</p>

  <p>Resistance was useless. They stood still whilst the commandant shouted his
  orders.</p>

  <p>They were still standing when the soldiers burst in and secured them.</p>

  <p>"Pigs! dogs!" hissed the comrnandant. "Why did you not go into the garage,
  eh? You would have been finished with Little Hell then! To the larger Hell
  you would have gone! You know what would happen? I was waiting for you. You
  would have been shot down as you opened the door. You have had a lucky
  escape, for you have been watched ever since you went into the bathroom, and
  I was hoping to make an end of this swine," and he lashed Dusty across the
  face. "Take them away," he said&mdash;"but stay, our good friend shall see
  this scum."</p>

  <p>He walked across the ornate room in which the arrests had been made and
  flung open a door.</p>

  <p>"Gracious lady," he called, "Baroness von Zimmermann ! Let me show you
  some of my wild animals!"</p>

  <p>He stood aside with a little bow as the woman entered.</p>

  <p>"My God!" cried Tom, for it was Dawn Marsh who stood smiling in the
  doorway and viewing him superciliously through a pair of lorgnettes!</p>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2"></a>2. &mdash; THE GIRL FROM THE ETHER</h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">CAPE RACE said "O.L." and had been saying "O.L." at regular
  intervals for a quarter of an hour. Not in any spirit of profanity did Cape
  Race speak, but soberly, almost wistfully&mdash;for "O.L." decoded meant no
  more than the S.S. <i>Thibetian</i>.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, it applied less to twenty thousand inanimate tons of
  riveted steel plate and spinning turbines, than to Carter Jackson, for he was
  the operator on duty and should have been sitting at his table, ear-pieces
  clamped to his head, left hand on key, right hand manipulating pencil on
  paper, his whole mind absorbed in the message that Cape Race had to send.</p>

  <p>Instead of which, his ear-pieces lay on the table; he could hear the whine
  of the code call, but heeded it not. For he was deliciously deep in the lily
  land of might-have-been. There is a big white house which stands back from
  the post-road&mdash;a house whose upper stories are hidden when the maple is
  in leaf. And way behind there is a wide porch, where sentimental young people
  can sit and watch the full moon fretting a silver path across Long Island
  Sound....</p>

  <p class="verse">"Had she have loved me? Just as well&mdash;<br>
  She might have hated, who can tell,"</p>

  <p class="first">growled Carter, and stretched his arm for the receivers.</p>

  <p>Suppose Balderwood Jackson, uncle and patron of his one spoiled nephew,
  had weathered the financial storm which beat him down. It had seemed
  ludicrously impossible to Carter that there could have been a storm at all,
  for did not all men agree that never in the history of the country had money
  been so plentiful or its prosperity so great? Out of a clear sky had the
  lightning struck. Meterological experts are familiar with such happenings;
  there is a death-rate to the wealthiest of communities; when Midas touched a
  cabbage and turned it to gold, some peasant was short a perfectly good
  vegetable.</p>

  <p>Anyway, Balderwood Jackson who, although he was a good citizen, did
  nevertheless contravene the Sullivan Act, which forbids the possession of
  lethal weapons, laid hands upon himself, and his name figured largely in the
  evening editions.</p>

  <p>For he had sold short certain stock, which might be likened in general
  uninterest of appearance to the domestic cabbage, and a Midas corporation had
  turned them into gold.</p>

  <p>They brought the news to Carter at his home on the Sound. He kept the
  reporters waiting because he was trying out his new wireless set. When he
  heard and understood, he went back to his tiny wireless-room and tapped out
  into the ether the Twenty-Eighth Psalm, which he knew by heart. There was no
  reason why he should do this, indeed it was at best a mechanical
  performance&mdash;machine work for the settlement of his panicking thoughts.
  But it was immensely confusing to other amateur radiographers who were
  listening-in.</p>

  <p>In a sense this exercise was strangely fitting as a commentary upon
  Balderwood Jackson's life and failure.</p>

  <p>The passing of his uncle's estate, the sordid business of auction sales,
  the vulgarity of court proceedings, none of these things had touched Carter.
  For he was twenty-four and superior to material things. He had called upon
  Grace Meredith and had formally released her from her engagement, and she, to
  his amazement, had accepted the release in a few well-chosen and appropriate
  words.</p>

  <p>That hurt...</p>

  <p>"O.L."... "O.L."</p>

  <p>There was an impatient note in the call. Carter sighed, turned over a
  switch, and the key quivered under his hand.</p>

  <p>"Wts mttr wi u?" asked Cape Race&mdash;Carter could almost hear the
  operator's snarl, and grinned.</p>

  <p>"Go hd," he said, and there came an avalanche of "welcomes," "rooms
  reserved," stock prices and the like.</p>

  <p>For an hour he wrote rapidly, then with a final sarcasm Cape Race was
  silent.</p>

  <p>Carter folded the messages into envelopes and addressed them to the
  passengers&mdash;asleep now, if their several consciences permitted&mdash;and
  put them aside for early morning delivery.</p>

  <p>He sat for a while reaching out into space, lengthening and shortening his
  wave-lengths. Once he heard faintly, so faintly that he could detect no
  sequence to the letters, the far-off voice of Aberdeen. Somewhere on the
  rugged coast of Scotland an operator was jabbering to Rome, and the faded
  fringe of the message came into the waters of the dark Atlantic. Then he
  heard the <i>Berengaria</i>, and she was speaking to the <i>Olympic</i> very
  severely.... It was all about an ocean letter that had gone astray....</p>

  <p>Carter took off his receiver and then rising walked out on to the dark
  boat-deck as Granger took over the watch.</p>

  <p>Leaning over the rail he puffed critically at the butt of the wonder-
  cigar. It had been donated him by a misguided passenger, who felt that his
  gift would accelerate the dispatch of an anguished message. Carter accepted
  the bribe with dignity, and put ten dollars' worth of slushy sentiment
  through Cape Race in its turn.</p>

  <p>The days of the passionate "remember me's" and the "never forget you's"
  had passed. Poldhu was a faint and blurred whine of sound. Only the talk of
  outward steamers and occasionally the fragments of incoherent talk, and that
  in tones as thin and high as the shrill of the cicala, from Aberdeen, reached
  the wireless-room.</p>

  <p>Carter made his cigar last for two hours, and as eight bells went for'ard,
  he went back to the house of mystery.</p>

  <p>The myopic Granger was polishing his big spectacles, and glared round as
  the other slammed the door.</p>

  <p>"Here you are, are you?" he said fretfully and-unnecessarily. "Eight bells
  went quarter-'n-hour ago."</p>

  <p>"You're a liar," said Carter amiably. "Any one around?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul," replied Granger, climbing into his jacket, "<i>and</i>
  there's no news."</p>

  <p>"No news!" repeated the wrathful Carter; "you big, fat, lazy devil, do you
  mean to tell me that you've been stalling here all this watch, and you
  haven't been out for news?"</p>

  <p>"No news," said Granger at the door, and not without satisfaction, "and as
  to going out for news, why, I've prodded the ether to Mars&mdash;and even she
  said nothing."</p>

  <p>Carter snorted.</p>

  <p>"How are the first-class passengers going to last a day without news?" he
  demanded severely. "What is going to happen to-morrow night when they go down
  to dinner and there's no ship's bulletin?"</p>

  <p>"Fake it," suggested Granger helpfully from the open door. "It's easy. Say
  the Jugo Slavs are restless, an' that the Allies are holdin' a conference,
  an' somebody's been shot in Ireland&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get out!" snapped Carter, and the door banged.</p>

  <p>He sat down at the table, fixed his ear-pieces, and tapped a key. Then he
  turned a little nob on a dial and again rattled the key. It was hardly true
  that there was "nobody about." A hundred and fifty miles away the big
  Cunarder <i>Aurelia</i> was pushing her nose into a sou'-westerly squall, and
  be heard the chatter of her.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" tapped Carter, "what's biting you?"</p>

  <p>But still the <i>Aurelia</i> chattered. Presently she stopped and whined
  her code number, "K.M."</p>

  <p>"J.L.," tapped Carter. "How's Corky?"</p>

  <p>"Fine," came the reply&mdash;Corky, chief operator of the <i>Aurelia</i>
  had had pneumonia the last time the ships had spoken. Then:</p>

  <p>"Got any news?" asked Carter.</p>

  <p>"No," was the reply. "Aberdeen very faint&mdash;shall I relay from
  <i>Tusamic</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Are you in touch with <i>Tusamic</i>?"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"Then what the hell are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"E... E... E... !" exploded <i>Aurelia</i> in sheer merriment.</p>

  <p>Carter grinned and sent out another length.... Aberdeen&mdash;unmistakably
  Aberdeen, but unintelligible. He shortened and picked up news about Senator
  Billister....Ponsons tender had been accepted... should specifications go
  forward to Paris....</p>

  <p>Carter waited awhile until he heard the code. The message was for the
  eastern-bound White Star boat. There would be no news. That crazy Granger
  must have missed it.</p>

  <p>He played scientifically with a key, and then:</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;LOVE&mdash;YOU&mdash;VERY&mdash;MUCH."</p>

  <p>He wrinkled up his nose and stared at the words which he had written
  mechanically.</p>

  <p>A fragment of some moony passenger's message....an errant scrap of
  sentiment torn from its context ? Strange that it should be spelt out without
  any of the professional contractions. It should have run
  "I&mdash;LOV&mdash;U&mdash;VY&mdash;MCH." An amateur? What amateur would be
  sending at one o'clock in the morning&mdash;and what amateur radiographer
  operated from the wide ocean? For his dial told him that this message had
  come from a ship in a sea somewhere in the northern seas.</p>

  <p>"Rum," he said, and then:</p>

  <p>"C&mdash;A&mdash;R&mdash;L&mdash;O D&mdash;E&mdash;A&mdash;R."</p>

  <p>Carter Jackson made a little sound. Carlo! Grace used to call him "Carlo."
  The word brought back that big house of the maples and the porch&mdash;and
  the netted silver of the moonlit Sound.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>His fingers trembled on the key.</p>

  <p>"<i>Who are you&mdash;this is 'Thibetian'&mdash;Carter Jackson
  operator!</i>" he rapped.</p>

  <p>In slack hours Granger shaved himself in the instrument room, and in the
  tiny mirror against a bulkhead Carter caught a glimpse of his face. The
  staring light of the great valve lamps made a man look ghastly at the best,
  but they did not print old-looking lines about his eyes.</p>

  <p>No answer came, and be waited. The thud of his heart beat twice to the
  thud of the screws.</p>

  <p>Again his fingers rested delicately on the ebony key, when:</p>

  <p>"I A&mdash;M SO SORRY I WANT YOU SO MUCH CARLO BOY."</p>

  <p>The face of Carter Jackson was wet, and yet he felt deadly cold.</p>

  <p>"<i>Grace is it you&mdash;tell me please&mdash;it is Carter.</i>"</p>

  <p>He did not trouble to think rationally. The absurdity of his conclusion
  only came to him in the morning, hours after he had been relieved from duty,
  and when the steward woke him with tea and certain futile references to the
  weather.</p>

  <p>Carter had not slept very well, but he had slept well enough for the angle
  of his vision to undergo a new orientation.</p>

  <p>Grace knew nothing about wireless telegraphy. He had tried to get her
  interested, and she was only bored. And she was hardly likely to be in the
  northerly seas.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if I dreamt it," he asked himself, and sliding from his bunk,
  began to search in his pockets. No, there were the scraps of paper on which
  he had written the messages; he had even marked the hour and the minute they
  had been received.</p>

  <p>If it were Grace, why had she not answered that frantic appeal of his? She
  had been silent, ignoring ; the cold hauteur of her lofty silence was
  inexplicable. But of course it wasn't Grace.</p>

  <p>Operator Granger was inclined to be offensive that morning.</p>

  <p>"Say," said he, "<i>Aurelia</i> has been asking who is the poor fish who
  loves Grace dearer'n life itself, eh? <i>Aurelia</i> says that all the time
  we ought've been reachin' out for the murders 'n hold-ups an' bank robberies
  that constitutes the news of God's beautiful world, we were shovin' through
  mush about undyin' adoration. <i>Aurelia</i> says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Damn <i>Aurelia</i>!" snarled Carter Jackson.</p>

  <p>"But who sent it?" persisted the other. "I've been lookin' through all the
  blanks, an' the nearest to a love letter was that 'I'se-a-tummin'' message
  from the Hebrew tobacco man from Chicago."</p>

  <p>"<i>Aurelia</i> is lying," said Carter more calmly. "Did you get any
  news?"</p>

  <p>"I did," complained the other, "got it from <i>Aurelia</i>. He's pretty
  sick at havin' to give it, and I'm pretty sick at havin' to take it. It was
  your job, anyway."</p>

  <p>The <i>Thibetian</i> passed Fire Island on the following morning, and came
  into dock in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>Carter, reporting at the Purser's office, discovered that the ship would
  be an extra six days in port. Not especially cheerful news to Carter, for he
  seldom left the confined area of No. 32 pier.</p>

  <p>But suppose....</p>

  <p>He dismissed the idea as being unworthy of a brain. Grace Meredith was, in
  all probability, married now. He had neither seen nor heard of her in three
  years.</p>

  <p>Once a neighbour of theirs had travelled on the <i>Thibetian</i>, but him
  had Carter laboriously and irritatedly avoided.</p>

  <p>Still....</p>

  <p>On the third day after the ship's arrival in New York, he dressed in
  shore-going kit and went up town.</p>

  <p>At the cost of a quarter he could set at rest all his doubts. His hand
  shook as he turned the leaves of the telephone directory. (He knew the
  number, of course, but it pleased him, unaccountably, to pretend that he had
  forgotten.)</p>

  <p>It was Stardon, the Merediths' butler, who answered him. So Stardon hadn't
  been fired over that mystery of the missing port&mdash;the great question and
  crisis which had preoccupied the Jacksons and the Merediths just before the
  crash came.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;what name did you say?"</p>

  <p>"Smith. William B. Smith," said Jackson huskily. "Is Miss Meredith at
  home?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>Carter's heart sank.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to speak to her, sir?"</p>

  <p>He did not want to speak to anybody, but hung up the receiver, leaving an
  annoyed butler tapping the hook and speaking evilly of the American telephone
  system.</p>

  <p>So that was that. The end of a cruel and fantastic dream. Men dreamt this
  way continuously. Some of easy money, of fortunes deposited in their hand;
  some of power (these went mad in time); some of love and lovers.</p>

  <p>Carter walked back to the ship and went to his cabin.</p>

  <p>Here or hereabouts be might have stayed until the ship left port, but
  Granger dug him out on the Sunday.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to take you down to Coney Island," he said enthusiastically,
  when he had discovered that Carter had never experienced the hectic joys of
  that resort. "There is a fellow I know who has a classy motor- boat; it is
  coming alongside on Sunday."</p>

  <p>Carter protested but yielded eventually. He was being too sorry for
  himself, and the poison of self-pity was an insidious and hateful one.</p>

  <p>Granger had not exaggerated the classiness of his friend's boat, nor had
  be over-stated its comfort.</p>

  <p>Sitting at ease, with a hot sun overhead, and a gentle breeze blowing in
  from the Atlantic, Carter Jackson felt immensely superior to fate. The chug-
  chug of the busy little engine, the gentle motion of the boat, and a
  gradually dawning sense of the mercies which bad been vouchsafed to him,
  brought him almost to a condition of content long before Coney Island rose to
  their view.</p>

  <p>"That's a nice-looking ship," said Carter suddenly.</p>

  <p>A big white steam-yacht was coming toward them from the sea.</p>

  <p>Granger's friend, who was both encyclopaedia and Who's Who of the yachting
  world, nodded vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Yuh," he said. "She's a dandy boat; belongs to Meredith, the hardware
  man&mdash;<i>Dog Star</i> she's called. Cost...."</p>

  <p>He recited exactly to the last cent the value of the yacht, but Carter was
  not listening.</p>

  <p>Meredith! The old hopes trembled, the old doubt stirred again.</p>

  <p>"Yuh," said Granger's friend, nodding, "that's right; he lives on Long
  Island; got a beautiful home, cost..."</p>

  <p>The motor-boat was turning landward, when Carter was seized with a sudden
  inspiration.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see that yacht nearer at hand," he said. "Could you get
  alongside?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I could," said the other enthusiastically, and spun the wheel.</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer it came; Carter could see figures on the sun-
  deck&mdash;some women, a man or two in yachting attire.</p>

  <p>Granger's friend brought the boat almost under the yacht bows.</p>

  <p>"Dandy, eh?" he said, with the air of a proprietor.</p>

  <p>Carter said nothing; he was looking up to the down-turned face of a girl
  leaning over the rails.</p>

  <p>If she saw him she made no sign. It seemed to Carter that she looked past
  him, and was gone before he could decide whether he would attract her
  attention, whether he dared wave to her or not.</p>

  <p>"You can see her from the other side," said the owner of the classy boat,
  as he brought her under the yacht's stern. "I could keep up with her&mdash;I
  can beat her for speed, I tell you."</p>

  <p>"No, no," said Carter huskily, "I want to see Coney Island."</p>

  <p>Granger's friend was hurt, but recovered sufficiently before he reached
  the landing-stage, to record certain marvellous performances of his
  craft.</p>

  <p>Jackson did not hear him. He was stunned with the tremendous possibility
  of his discovery.</p>

  <p>When he came back to the ship that night, without any very clear idea of
  how he had spent the day, he was as tired as Granger was jubilant; somebody
  or something had evidently pleased that short-sighted young man, who beamed
  benevolently at him from the doorway of the cabin.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever see such hair?... She's in the beauty chorus at the... Some
  girl, eh, Carter?"</p>

  <p>"Some girl," agreed Carter, and was momentarily puzzled to know who
  Granger was speaking about.</p>

  <p>By the next afternoon he had made up his mind. He went ashore, and with a
  recklessness which frightened him, took the first train for the pleasant
  place he had once called "home."</p>

  <p>He did not recognise a single taxi-man at the station, but be saw old
  Weitheim come out of the store, and he recognised Doctor Felling as he
  flashed past in his resplendent automobile. The Merediths' house shocked him.
  In two years the pleasant old home of John Meredith had been swept away, and
  a stone mansion, turreted and gabled, timbered before and stuccoed behind,
  floated up from its ruins.</p>

  <p>Stardon, the butler, recognised him.</p>

  <p>"Why, Mr. Jackson!" he said, with such a beam of welcome that Carter
  decided that this rotund man could not have stolen the port after all. "Well,
  this is a surprise! Mr. Meredith is in the library. I'll go right along and
  tell him."</p>

  <p>John Meredith gave him the welcome he expected. Carter had always been a
  favourite of his, and now he ran out, a stout, wild-haired man, and gripped
  Carter's hand in his.</p>

  <p>"It's good to see you, Carter," he bellowed. "Been out west, eh? Come back
  with a fortune like the young men in the movies?"</p>

  <p>He led Carter to the library, and Carter, conscious that he had not come
  back either from the west, or with a fortune, was a little uneasy.</p>

  <p>"If you had come yesterday we should not have been here," said Meredith.
  "Sit down, Carter. Some changes since you went away, eh? Well, I had to get a
  bigger house. The old home was falling to pieces, though I hated to part with
  it; but my sister&mdash;you have met Miss Meredith&mdash;she is staying with
  us now."</p>

  <p>Of course! It was to the maiden sister of John Meredith that the butler
  had been referring.</p>

  <p>"She was kind of set on this kind of house, though Grace hasn't been civil
  to me since it was built," he chuckled. "Yes, I have been away on a yacht
  cruise," he rattled on. "Grace was getting a bit peaked, and, gosh, the
  weather was hot... fierce... and as I had the yacht lying up on the slips, I
  thought I'd go away beyond the Sound... into the Arctic Circle, my boy. Now
  what have you been doing, Carter&mdash;tell me?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't been entirely west, sir," said Carter, with a smile. "East a
  little and west a little."</p>

  <p>"Europe, eh?"</p>

  <p>Carter nodded.</p>

  <p>"You left in such a damned hurry that I didn't see you&mdash;we've missed
  you a whole lot," said the old man.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I didn't say good-bye to anybody," said Carter awkwardly. "How
  is&mdash;Grace?"</p>

  <p>"Fine," said Mr. Meredith, and looked at him curiously. "What happened
  with you and Grace?" he asked. "I never understood why you two people fell
  out."</p>

  <p>Carter was saved the embarrassment of replying. Grace came in at that
  moment. He thought she was looking paler than when he had last seen her. She
  was certainly more beautiful: the indefinable something which distinguishes
  the woman from the girl had come to her. To say "older" would have been a
  looseness of description. She had matured as a bud matures in a night.</p>

  <p>She met his eyes steadily, and her cool hand rested in his for a
  second.</p>

  <p>"It is good to see you, Carter," she said; "where have you been?"</p>

  <p>So she did not know, he thought in dismay, and there came a definite end
  to his dream.</p>

  <p>"He's been to Europe," interrupted her father. "Made a lot of money,
  Carter?"</p>

  <p>"I've made none," said Carter grimly. "My worldly possessions at this
  moment amount to a hundred and twelve dollars back pay."</p>

  <p>"Have you been working?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm on the <i>Thibetian</i>," he said shortly; "wireless
  operator&mdash;eighty dollars a month."</p>

  <p>"A wireless operator!" said Meredith slowly, and in a tone of surprise.
  "Why, of course, you were always&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you come along and see our new garden?" interrupted the girl. "It is
  quite beautiful, if you forget the architectural monstrosity which it
  surrounds."</p>

  <p>She led him away, Mr. Meredith protesting feebly.</p>

  <p>Once in that silent walk Carter looked at her hand. The ring he feared to
  see was absent from her white finger.</p>

  <p>"Do you find us strange?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"What have you been doing all this time, Grace?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"What does a girl do? I've been to horse shows; I've been to theatres and
  operas, to Palm Beach, to Daddy's camp; I've read the best sellers and heard
  all the best music and danced all the worst two-steps&mdash;" She
  paused.</p>

  <p>"Have you probed into the mysteries of wireless telegraphy," he asked
  slowly, and held his breath, waiting her reply.</p>

  <p>It came after a long pause.</p>

  <p>"Wireless telegraphy, no. Why do you ask, Carter?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know exactly; it's very amusing. Some people learn the Morse
  code&mdash;just for fun."</p>

  <p>"I learn nothing&mdash;for fun," she answered.</p>

  <p>Thereafter they exchanged banalities.</p>

  <p>"You're not staying to dinner, Carter?" said Mr. Meredith in horror.</p>

  <p>"No, I've got to get back to New York." Carter was insistent. "I have to
  take my turn of duty."</p>

  <p>"But surely there is no duty when your ship is in harbour?" said the
  girl.</p>

  <p>Carter lied valiantly.</p>

  <p>She came down to the station to see him off, and as the car swung out of
  the big drive on to the post road, he looked back at the house.</p>

  <p>"It isn't beautiful, is it?" she said, with a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"It is immensely decorative," he said gravely, "especially those two
  flag-staffs on the top of the towers."</p>

  <p>He was glad in the end to leave her. The silences were painful. Not once
  had any reference on either side been made to the past, and he was almost
  relieved when the train drew out.</p>

  <p>He half expected to receive a letter from her before the ship sailed.</p>

  <p>"You're a fool," he said savagely, "a hopeless imbecile."</p>

  <p>When the bell was ringing the visitors ashore, a presence exploded into
  his cabin.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there you are!" said the breathless Mr. Meredith. "I swore to Grace I
  wouldn't see you&mdash;but I am not a fool&mdash;you're a fool! I'm too old
  for foolishness, anyway. Do you see, Carter? You're a fool and Grace is a
  fool," he repeated inconsequently, "and there goes that damn bell."</p>

  <p>He gripped the young man's hand and shook it.</p>

  <p>"Come along and see the <i>Dog Star</i> when you come back; she's got a
  fine radio set&mdash;Grace can work that set better than any operator. I
  never dreamt then you were on the <i>Thibetian</i> doing this kind of work.
  Grace never told me&mdash;good-bye."</p>

  <p>He dashed out of the cabin, only to dash back again; he was a violently
  moving man.</p>

  <p>"L.T.V.," he said mysteriously, and nodded, and there was mystery in his
  nod also. "Didn't you see the aerials&mdash;no, of course you didn't&mdash;we
  had 'em when we were away&mdash;they're up now, Carter. They look fine,
  too."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you," said the bewildered Carter. "Aerials?"</p>

  <p>Arid then be remembered the significant flag-posts on the Meredith
  house.</p>

  <p>"They're up now&mdash;talk to her, my boy, L.T.V.!"</p>

  <p>He left Carter Jackson considerably disturbed.</p>

  <p>He looked up the code book, and found it: "Yacht, <i>Dog Star</i>." She
  would not be on the yacht, but the code would find her&mdash;if she was
  listening- in.</p>

  <p>At one o'clock in the morning he relieved Granger; Cape Race, immensely
  talkative at this stage of the voyage, was gabbling commercially.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," said Carter gently, and devoted himself to the old emergency
  set, which was more suitable for messages over a comparatively short
  distance.</p>

  <p>"L.T.V." he tapped. "L.T.V." and then the answer came.</p>

  <p>"<i>Send slowly, I am only a beginner.</i>"</p>

  <p>So that was why she had not heard him. In his excitement on that electric
  night, he had sent his message at so tremendous a rate, that none but an
  expert could have understood him, and then:</p>

  <p>"I LOVE YOU CARTER," said L.T.V. "WHEN YOU COME BACK..."</p>

  <p>At half-past two Cape Race picked up the U.S. Mail steamer
  <i>Kentucky</i>.</p>

  <p>"Can you get <i>Thibetian</i>?" asked Cape Race in a fury. "I could, but
  being human, I won't," said <i>Kentucky</i> rapturously. For <i>Kentucky</i>
  had been listening-in. Presently Cape Race was satisfied; the whine of the
  <i>Thibetian</i>'s signal came through:</p>

  <p>"WHRN L U BN," asked Cape Race furiously.</p>

  <p>"Go hd," came the reply, "I've finished&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In a little room under one of the grotesque towers of Mr. Meredith's new
  home, a girl sat at a bench, her head on her arms, and she was fast asleep.
  Therefore, she did not hear what Cape Race was saying to Carter Jackson, and
  was spared the gentle sarcasm of the mail steamer <i>Kentucky</i>.</p>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3"></a>3. &mdash; FATE AND MR. HOKE</h2>

  <h3>First published as "A Deed of Gift," <i>Grand Magazine</i>, Vol. 46, Sep
  1924-Feb 1925</h3>

  <p class="first">LORD DERRYMERE read the paragraph again, removed his pince-
  nez and placed them carefully on his Empire writing-table. Then, after a
  moment's consideration, he pressed the bell that was neatly labelled
  "Secretary." There was an interval of nearly a minute before Mary Bush came
  in, to meet the grave scrutiny of eyes, which, whilst they approved her
  undeniable prettiness, could yet disapprove of the notoriety which had come
  to her in the past few days, and which had created such intense sensation in
  the servants' hail of Derrymere House.</p>

  <p>Mary stood demurely before the table, book in hand, wondering just what he
  would say, and what form his injured dignity would take. Or was it about
  Jimmy he wished to speak? He had made no reference to his discovery, though
  she had expected one every time she saw him.</p>

  <p>"Miss Bush"&mdash;he leant back in his chair, fixed his pince-nez on his
  long nose, and folded his well-manicured hands&mdash;"I have been reading, in
  a cutting from the public press, the story of your remarkable good fortune;
  and whilst, as a Justice of the Peace, I deprecate, without any reservations
  whatever, the breach of the law which a lottery involves, yet I must offer
  you my congratulations upon your success in the Grand National Sweepstake,
  organised, I understand, on behalf of certain charitable
  institutions&mdash;though whether those charitable institutions benefit to
  any extent is extremely doubtful....Fifteen thousand pounds!"</p>

  <p>Mary smiled uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"Fifteen hundred, Lord Derrymere," she corrected.</p>

  <p>With great care his lordship adjusted his glasses and read the cutting
  again.</p>

  <p>"Peer's Secretary wins Fortune in Hospital Lottery," he read. "Girl wins
  £15,000 by the Victory of Sergeant Mariati."</p>

  <p>"Fifteen hundred," said Mary again. "The promoters must have given the
  wrong figures to the press."</p>

  <p>He inclined his head courteously.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said simply. "Fifteen thousand pounds is a substantial
  sum, and would have made a very considerable difference to
  your&mdash;ah&mdash;future."</p>

  <p>Mary Bush agreed silently, but she knew her employer too well to place any
  obstacle in the flowing stream of his eloquence.</p>

  <p>"In this democratic age," said his lordship, "when we see on every hand
  the introduction of&mdash;ah&mdash;plebian blood into the greatest and oldest
  of the families, it would be contrary to the spirit of the times if I offered
  any foolish objections to a union on which the heart of my son seems to be
  irrevocably set. But we are, as you know from your intimate acquaintance with
  my affairs, an extremely poor family, and I confess that, in
  contemplating&mdash;ah&mdash;marriage, I had in mind the possibility of his
  choice resting upon some wealthy member of the manufacturing class. But
  fifteen hundred pounds!" He pulled a long face. "I fear..." he shook his
  head&mdash;"I greatly fear.... You have no other prospects?"</p>

  <p>"You mean money, Lord Derrymere?" she asked. "I'm afraid I haven't. There
  are some distant relatives of mine in Australia who are immensely wealthy,
  and I have an uncle in Russia."</p>

  <p>"In Russia?" said Lord Derrymere, interested. "A Bolshevik? I understand
  those gentlemen have accumulated considerable property&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"No, he isn't a Bolshevik, and I'm under the impression that he isn't very
  rich."</p>

  <p>She was discreetly silent upon the many stories which had come to her of
  Uncle Algernon's lurid past. He was one of those relations about whom people
  never boast, and his continued presence in Russia was, she guessed, due very
  largely to the lax view which the Soviet officials had taken of the sacred
  rights of property.</p>

  <p>"It is very regrettable," said Lord Derrymere, and she took his nod,
  rather than the words, for her dismissal.</p>

  <p>Jimmy, whose other name was the Viscount Bournvale, was waiting for her in
  the garden. He was a young man immensely energetic, and though he was
  possessed of the optimism which is the peculiar gift of youth, he waited for
  her reappearance with some anxiety.</p>

  <p>"What did he say?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It isn't what he said, it's what he suggested," said Mary wearily.
  "Jimmy, we'll have to be sensible. You're poor, I'm poor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You've got fifteen hundred pounds: that's more than the governor's ever
  had in one sum for years," suggested Jimmy indignantly. "He wasn't offensive
  to you, was he?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, dear, he was just kind and logical and loquacious."</p>

  <p>He took her arm, and they paced the long path to the rosary.</p>

  <p>"If it had been fifteen thousand pounds, it would have made a difference,
  Jimmy. I think your father likes me."</p>

  <p>"Did he ask about your relations? He's rather keen on relations," asked
  the gloomy Jimmy.</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"I have only one I could have advanced, but oh, Jimmy, he's dreadful!"</p>

  <p>Mary Bush had come into the poverty-stricken household of the twelfth Earl
  of Derrymere as resident-secretary to a peer who had much to say on the Irish
  Land Act, and said it for four hours a day, in language acceptable to the
  dullest of the English reviews. In such moments as he could bring his mind
  from the contemplation of Governmental enormities, Lord Derrymere had vaguely
  observed the friendship which had grown up between the girl and his heir; but
  until one momentous evening, when he had walked without knocking into his
  secretary's office, the exact nature of the relationship had not dawned upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"Jimmy, I'm glad, really glad, we've been such good pals, and I'm even
  glad he saw you kissing me; but, dear boy, we've come to the end, and you'll
  marry something in the brewing trade, and I'll&mdash;I'll"&mdash;she
  choked&mdash;"go back to find another amiable gentleman who splits his
  infinitives..."</p>

  <p>He took her in his arms and kissed her.</p>

  <p>"Mary," he said solemnly, "I've got a hunch that fate is working for
  us&mdash;and fifteen hundred pounds is a lot of money. Did you get it?"</p>

  <p>"I got the cheque this morning," she said miserably. "Oh, Jimmy, do you
  think it is worth while buying any tickets for the Derby?"</p>

  <p>Fate indeed was working, but in a manner that Mary Bush could not guess,
  for she knew nothing of Mr. Abraham Hoke, that world-wanderer, so could
  hardly be expected to appreciate his immeasurable sense of humour.</p>

  <p>Abraham Hoke came swinging along Tchistoproudsky Boulevard at peace with
  the world, though he had no reason to be, by all civilised reckoning. His
  lean face was tanned to the colour which furniture-dealers describe as fumed
  oak, the little lines which seamed his face were many, his hair, powdered
  grey, was tidily brushed under the rusty green hat which sat jauntily on the
  side of his head, his soiled clothes were white with the dust of the road to
  Skatchka, and a black-rimmed monocle was fixed in his eye.</p>

  <p>As he walked he swung a sagging panama cane jauntily and sang a song about
  women. He did not hum it, he sang it, loudly enough to attract attention to
  himself, but not so loud as would excuse the warning and the admonition which
  trembled on the lips of that unenlightened Red police agent who watched the
  eccentric figure with a smile which was half a frown.</p>

  <p>Behind Mr. Abraham Hoke and his assurance, as he cheerfully footed it
  along the broad boulevard, was the wide world and the experience
  thereof&mdash;more immediately in his rear was the Skatchka and a racehorse
  called Grom, which unaccountably failed to win.</p>

  <p>Hoke had invested all that he possessed&mdash;a trifle of 5,000,000
  roubles&mdash;upon the equine traitor. When he saw the gaudy jacket of Grom
  toiling in the rear of the field, he waited some time for a miracle to
  happen, and then, remarking that providence was fighting on the side of the
  moneyed classes, he tore up his pari-mutuel ticket and said, "Nitchevo,"
  which is Russian for "never mind."</p>

  <p>He stood head and shoulders taller than the average man, and gave the
  observer the impression that he was thin. But the average man's coat would
  have split over Abraham Hoke's broad shoulders, and the average man's sleeve
  would have come to a little below his elbows.</p>

  <p>From time to time as he walked, casting an occasional and approving glance
  at the Kremlin's bulk, he would take his monocle from his eye, and, with
  glass daintily poised, and head swaying from side to side, conduct an
  invisible orchestra, to the consternation of sober passersby, who stopped to
  look after him, crossing themselves as they realised his madness.</p>

  <p>Yet they were no more sober than he, be it known. God had given Abraham
  Hoke, tramp of the world, a glad heart and a sunny mind, and though half the
  detectives in Europe knew him by repute, though many men, from the Chief of
  Police at Tomsk to the genial Commissioner O'Hara of Seattle, desired most
  passionately to meet him, none grudged him credit for his joy in life.</p>

  <p>He crossed Miasnitokaya, singing a sinful song about a peasant who came to
  worship at the shrine of St. Inokente and met a girl <i>en route</i>.
  Fortunately for the morals of Moscow, he trolled his lay in that peasant
  Russian which is not met this side of Lake Braikal.</p>

  <p>He was hungry long before he reached his destination, which was an
  inexpensive house in the Prospekt, rented by Mr. Algernon Bush, though at
  that time, for diplomatic reasons, he was known as the Senhor Dom Jerome
  Xavier de Castro y Pembalino of Paraguay.</p>

  <p>He was sitting at his big carved oak writing-table when Hoke entered, and
  might have been a successful stockbroker, if one judged him by his neat but
  expensive attire and the single pearl which, with a thin gold watch-guard,
  represented his stock of visible jewellery.,</p>

  <p>He looked up with a smile as Hoke came in, and motioned to a deep leather
  chair by the side of the desk.</p>

  <p>"Ha, Hoke!" His voice was pitched high, and he had a little nasal twang
  not unpleasant to hear. "You are late&mdash;but I'll forgive you. I want you
  to do something for me, and it will be worth your while."</p>

  <p>"Material advantage, as opposed to the balm of an untroubled mind," said
  A. B. Hoke, "I have never sought. In the language of my young friend Tillett,
  I demand the right to live without the distressin' after effects which
  accompany the too strenuous employment of my voluntary muscular system; for
  the moment, I hunger."</p>

  <p>The other pushed a bell, and an untidy man appeared. "Bring some
  sandwiches and drink," said Bush.</p>

  <p>"Continually bring the sandwiches," added A. B. Hoke in a murmur.</p>

  <p>He sat in silence till the man came back with a tray and laid some
  rough-hewn sandwiches on a little table.</p>

  <p>"I give you this," said Bush, when the man had gone. "After, you will have
  sufficient money to provide for yourself."</p>

  <p>"I am no porcine hog," said A. B. Hoke, as be diluted his whisky. "The
  greed for gold an' lust for power, which serves but to swell the surplus of
  the incorruptible Commissioner of National Wealth, are not for me. I demand
  only of the world that it serves me as a habitation an' free foodery, an' in
  the pursuance of my hobby I have crossed lands where the foot of white man
  would never tread if there was a railway handy."</p>

  <p>Bush was content that he should babble on. Leaning back in his padded
  chair, he stroked his small black moustache and listened.</p>

  <p>"Years ago," said Mr. Hoke reminiscently, "I found myself in the western
  side of Thibet&mdash;me an' a chink named Li, himself a lover of Nature, and
  a born financier. I will not at the moment discuss the chain of adventurous
  circumstances which brought us to the inhospitable plateau, or the remarkable
  happenin's which preceded our arrival at Dras, <i>en route</i> for the Zoji
  Pass an' the far-famed glories of Kashmir."</p>

  <p>He paused, and for a moment was lost in thought.</p>

  <p>"As one who has said me <i>jolli</i> to the Grand Lama&mdash;though you'd
  discredit that statement as vergin' on the borderline of
  boastfulness&mdash;as one who has roosted under the lee of Nangar Parbat,
  that hogback of crystal heaven, and has, moreover, pigged it with the Ladaki,
  the Chatrali, and other disgustin' products of the trans-Himalayan
  territories, I am entitled to advance the opinion that there are easier ways
  of acquirin' pice."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to give you an easier," said Mr. Bush. "When I heard you had
  drifted into Moscow, I thought 'Here is the very man!'"</p>

  <p>"And I am." Mr. Hoke spoke through sandwich. "Far be it from me to pry
  into your domestic affairs&mdash;but there is a musical tinkle to your
  conversation. Have you, for the fourteenth time, sold rolling-stock to the
  deluded rulers of this land? That you are alive is more than remarkable. Did
  not Horace Sellermein, a German but a gentleman, perish miserably at the
  hands of Commissary K, to whose spouse he sold the veritable Crown jewels for
  a paltry billion?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Bush shifted uneasily.</p>

  <p>"I've had a pull," he said, "and now I have a push. The big fellow at the
  Kremlin, who was behind me, was shot last week for bribery and theft. I have
  twenty-four hours to leave Russia, and my capital could, with luck, be
  converted into ten pounds English."</p>

  <p>Hoke stared at him.</p>

  <p>"This imposing mansion...?"</p>

  <p>"Was lent by my friend," said Bush. "I'm going to England. Read this."</p>

  <p>He passed a newspaper cutting across the table, and Hoke read.</p>

  <p>"Mary Bush," he said, as he handed back the paper.</p>

  <p>"Fifteen thousand pounds, and I'm one of her two relatives." Mr. Bush was
  impressive. "My only relation, if I cut out my brother Joshua. And I have cut
  him out, Hoke! There is a man worth a million&mdash;he has so much money that
  he's ill with it, and yet he allows his own brother to battle with
  dirty-necked Russkis for his daily bread."</p>

  <p>"Dirty-necked they may be, but with soap at a million roubles a cake,
  cleanliness is swank," said Hoke philosophically. "But what is the
  graft?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Algernon Bush folded up the paper and put it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Fifteen thousand pounds is a lot of money," he said. "Mary is my niece. I
  am a man of the world&mdash;can advise her in the matter of investments. You
  get me, Hoke? There's a monkey for you in this. You've got to come and brag
  for me. You're the friend who can tell her about my estates in... "</p>

  <p>"Trans-Caucasia?" suggested Hoke helpfully.</p>

  <p>"Anywhere... it means a week's work, and there's a monkey in it, as I
  said..."</p>

  <p>"Monkeys have no appeal to one who has observed their restless habits,"
  said Hoke firmly. "Swindles of a general character appeal to one of my
  nimbleness of wit and wealth of vocabulary, but swindles involving gentle
  ladies&mdash;no!"</p>

  <p>"Look here"&mdash;Bush sprang up, and with two rapid strides placed
  himself between Hoke and the door&mdash;"I have asked you to make five
  hundred, with no risk."</p>

  <p>"Prince of true hearts," said Hoke courteously, "no risk! What of the
  untroubled pool of conscience into which you are throwin' half a brick! What
  of the mud of self-despisery you are stirrin' with the rod of temptation!
  No&mdash;K-N-O- U-G-H&mdash;No! Robbery is a pastime, an occasional fatal
  accident, a hobby, but a robbery of babes-in-arms&mdash;no! I take my
  leave."</p>

  <p>With a bow he made for the door.</p>

  <p>"No, you don't," growled Bush. "You dog! You miserable continental
  sneak-thief! You're going to do as I tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Hoke shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Out of my way, beef," he said loftily.</p>

  <p>Bush, with an oath, dropped one of his powerful hands on the other's
  shoulder&mdash;only for an instant. Then a big, bony hand gripped him by the
  throat, a hand as inflexible as steel, and he was swept from Hoke's path. He
  might have been a feather, so lightly was he tossed aside.</p>

  <p>He stood for a moment bewildered, then, with a froth of curses, he sprang
  to his desk and pulled open a drawer.</p>

  <p>"Depress it, depress it, dear lad," said A. B. Hoke gently.</p>

  <p>He was holding his revolver so that all Bush saw was the cold, black
  cavity of the barrel.</p>

  <p>"Go in peace, find another side-partner, and enjoy the fruits of your
  depredations&mdash;for A. B. Hoke the long trail to Tiflis, where there are
  pickings for one who, like myself, has the Koran at my finger-tips."</p>

  <p>Still humming his tune, Hoke strutted back the way he had come, halting
  before the door of the Chief of Foreign Intelligence, where a man can rest
  awhile and read foreign newspapers a month old, slightly soiled but otherwise
  entertaining.</p>

  <p>An hour later, when Algernon Bush was roping the last of his trunks, Mr.
  Hoke made an unexpected appearance.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;have you changed your mind?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoke smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>"Hunger drives with a short rein," he quoted. "I have buried my conscience
  in synthetic vodka&mdash;open the gate of your monkey- house&mdash;A. B. Hoke
  has fallen!"</p>

  <p>Three weeks later Mary Bush came into the library and found Lord Derrymere
  sitting before a large map. He greeted her with an almost tender smile.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mary," he said gently. "I have just seen your
  uncle&mdash;an extraordinarily entertaining wan! Not perhaps so widely
  travelled as Colonel Hoke, whose description of his adventures in Thibet
  should be written&mdash;I have just communicated with the editor of
  <i>Statesmanship</i>, suggesting that the Colonel might very well write a
  most entrancing series of reminiscences&mdash;but one cannot exactly expect a
  man of Mr. Bush's wealth to have had so varied a career. A rolling stone, as
  you may have heard, gathers very little moss. I have been studying the
  position of his concessions in Trans-Caucasia&mdash;you are an extremely
  fortunate young woman!"</p>

  <p>Mary did not reply. Her fortune, in truth, had bewildered her, and the
  emergence from the obscurity of the Russian mists of a millionaire uncle had
  taken her breath away.</p>

  <p>"His generosity is amazing," mused his lordship, shaking his head in
  admiration. "You have heard, of course, what he proposes doing&mdash;or am I
  betraying a confidence, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it," said Mary. "I never dreamt Uncle Algernon was a
  rich man. In fact... " She thought it wiser not to relate what she had
  thought of her erratic relative. "Yes, he told me last night; he said that
  his lawyer would bring the deed to-day. It does seem too good to be
  true!"</p>

  <p>"Such things happen," said his lordship seriously. "All along I had some
  suspicion of this possibility. You will probably recall my words, that he
  might have accumulated great possessions. I do not, of course, approve of the
  Russian Government, but there is no doubt that any shrewd man, settled in
  Russia during the past few years, has had unrivalled
  opportunities&mdash;unrivalled! He tells me that he is investing your money
  in an oil concession he has obtained from the Government?"</p>

  <p>Mary nodded. For some reason, she was not particularly enthusiastic about
  this investment. She had never possessed so large a sum before, and
  contemplated its parting with a little sense of dismay, which, in view of all
  the circumstances, was rather absurd.</p>

  <p>"I think you are wise," said Lord Derrymere. "I also am thinking of
  investing a few hundreds. You are indeed a very lucky girl!"</p>

  <p>In the private sitting-room at the Star and Garter Inn, the one place of
  entertainment that the village of Derrymere possessed, Mr. Algernon Bush lay
  moodily in an arm-chair, his hands thrust into his pockets, a frown of
  discontent upon his placid features.</p>

  <p>"Fifteen hundred!" he said bitterly. "Curse these newspapers! It will
  hardly pay expenses. I did think the old boy would put in a thousand or two,
  but he hasn't got two sixpences to rub together. Hoke, that 'monkey' is off!
  It's as much as I shall do to clear expenses, and if I can squeeze out a
  hundred for you, you'll have something to be thankful for!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoke stood by the window, whistling softly to himself, his bright eyes
  searching the road.</p>

  <p>"I am content, little friend of the poor," he said, "for monkeys, with
  their flea-chasing habits, are unpopular with me."</p>

  <p>"And why the devil did you suggest that deed of gift? Two hundred
  thousand! I wonder the size of it didn't scare her&mdash;and me without the
  price of a magnum! The lawyer's fee will cost me the best part of ten
  pounds," demanded Bush violently. "She'd have parted without all that
  tomfoolery."</p>

  <p>"Confidence&mdash;establish confidence," murmured Hoke. "And think of the
  pleasure you gave, the bright flush of joy that suffused her maidenly cheeks;
  think of the two tender hearts that will be united; think of an ancient home
  saved from ruin."</p>

  <p>Stuff!" snarled the other. "I'm thinking of the cost of stamps&mdash;fifty
  is as much as I shall be able to spare for you, Hoke."</p>

  <p>"Fifty is wealth," said Mr. Hoke complacently, "to one who has shared the
  begging-bowl of the wandering fakir, and has comforted his stomach on the
  bark of trees&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're a fool, and I was a fool to bring you," growled Mr. Bush.</p>

  <p>He made a little sum on the back of an old envelope, and recovered
  something of his spirits. Fifteen hundred pounds was fifteen hundred, and he
  had the girl's cheque in his pocket, and at ten o'clock the next morning,
  when the Troubridge banks opened, that slip of paper, and another which he
  hoped to receive from an impressed lordship, would be converted into
  cash.</p>

  <p>He was quite cheerful when he drove up to Derrymere House that afternoon,
  and, in the presence of a lawyer and a fascinated household, fixed his sign
  and seal to the imposing and involved document through which a well- trained
  lawyer had gabbled, without apparently stopping to take breath. The girl took
  the parchment in her hand and gazed at it openmouthed.</p>

  <p>"It's really too wonderful!" she gasped. "I can't believe my good fortune,
  uncle."</p>

  <p>He waved aside her thanks.</p>

  <p>"My dear, that is very little, compared with what you will one day
  inherit," he said soberly. "It is, if you will forgive the vulgarity, a
  fleabite compared with the return you will receive from your investment."</p>

  <p>He drove back to the inn, Mr. Hoke preferring to walk. At seven o'clock,
  when dinner was served, the wanderer had not returned, nor did midnight bring
  him, and an uneasy Algernon Bush returned from one of his many excursions
  along the road in a troubled frame of mind.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock the next morning, when Mr. Bush was walking out of the
  bank, with a rustling pad of notes in his right-hand trousers' pocket and a
  gleam of satisfaction in his eye, Mr. Abraham Hoke was sitting with the
  senior partner of Bracken, Thompson, Brown, Smith &amp; Jones, which, as
  their names will disclose, were an eminent firm of lawyers.</p>

  <p>"This," said Mr. Hoke, as he took from a ragged note-case a small slip of
  paper, "I saw in Moscow: a chance scrutiny of an ancient newspaper&mdash;and
  yet, how providential!"</p>

  <p>He read the paragraph with unction:</p>
  <br>

  <p class="quote">"'If this should meet the eye of Algernon John Bush, of
Sydney, South
  Australia, will he communicate with Bracken, Thompson, Brown, Smith &amp;
  Jones, 907 Leadenhall Street, solicitors of Joshua Bush, deceased.'"</p>
  <br>

  <p>The lawyer eyed the odd figure curiously.</p>

  <p>"You know where Mr. Bush is&mdash;I think you said as much in your
  letter?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I can tell you within a few yards where he is to be found,"
  said Mr. Hoke.</p>

  <p>The lawyer nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing more to say than what you already knew a fortnight ago.
  The amount that Mr. Algernon Bush has inherited is just short of a million
  pounds. Fortunately for the purposes of administration, most of the money is
  in cash at the Bank of England. He died in London, as you are probably aware.
  As to the other question you asked me in your letter, as to whether a deed of
  gift made by Mr. Bush without the knowledge of his inheritance would be
  valid, I must reply in the affirmative. He would hardly convey property in a
  deed of gift unless he possessed&mdash;what was the sum?"</p>

  <p>"Two hundred thousand pounds," murmured Mr. Hoke.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. As I say, if he gave, by deed of gift, that sum, the amount
  would be immediately recoverable."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hoke drew a long sigh.</p>

  <p>"I always thought it would be," he said. "Yes, I always thought it would
  be. And now, could you give me the address of a hard-faced lawyer? The kind
  of man who would battle with a soulless robber of orphans, and wring from his
  reluctant mitt, and to the last penny the money he owes her? A lawyer of the
  world, to whom a shark is the merest goldfish and the clinging tentacles of
  an octopus are as the tendrils of a passion-flower&mdash;in fact, a
  lawyer?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Bracken obliged, and Hoke went down the stairs two at a time, a song
  in his heart and his everlasting pilgrimage before his eyes.</p>

  <p>That night Mr. Bush arrived at his London hotel, <i>en route</i> for the
  Continent, and found two letters awaiting him. The first was
  staggering&mdash;the second filled him with the deepest melancholy.</p>
  <br>

  <p class="letter">
  "And, dear friend," wrote Hoke, "you'll pay ! For the first time in your
  ill-spent life you have so much money that you can't afford to run away.
  Ponder well on this&mdash;wealth has its responsibilities. The advice of one
  who has supped with wise men on the slopes of Everest is not to be despised
  and I wait lest I be called to give evidence of fraud and testify to your
  ungentleness. Pay, monkey-man."</p>
  <br>

  <p>In the end Mr. Bush paid, but it hurt very much.</p>

  <h2><a id="story4"
     name="story4"></a>4. &mdash; "DECLARED TO WIN"</h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">JOHN PETWORTH came out of the Army with a slight limp, an
  inadequate pension, and an extraordinary knowledge of horses. It is a fairly
  simple matter to set up in business as a trainer of racing thoroughbreds, if
  you have a wide circle of rich friends, a plausible manner, and the right
  kind of conversational powers.</p>

  <p>This lean-faced young man, however, was unusually shy and silent. He was a
  member of no night-clubs, for the Mauser bullet had carried away a few small
  but necessary bones of his ankle and put an end to his dancing; and the only
  friend he had&mdash;and he scarcely dared think of her as such&mdash;was Jane
  Seymour, who was comfortably off but could not, by any stretch of
  imagination, be called rich. And this, despite the fact that she had a flat
  in Park Lane and £2500 per annum&mdash;flat and income having been left to
  her by a maiden aunt who, with the exception of the £500 per annum she left
  to Gerald Seymour, bequeathed the residue of her estate to an institution for
  providing homes for friendless girls.</p>

  <p>It was almost a miracle that Jane talked with this diffident young man at
  all. They met, of all the unlikely places, at a Berkshire flower-show. The
  Rector of Stanbridge introduced the embarrassed young man as a grower of
  chrysanthemums&mdash;which he was. Jane thought he was an amateur
  horticulturist until, in his vague, rather helpless way, he betrayed his
  lowly occupation.</p>

  <p>"How wonderful!" said Jane enthusiastically. "Won't you let me come and
  see your stable?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Petworth went very red, fingered his little moustache guiltily, and
  blurted out the truth. He had a stable and he had a hack&mdash;but he had no
  other horses. He had had three: one of them won a selling race and
  disappeared; the owner of the other two, who expected to win races every time
  his horses ran, had taken them away and sent them to a more optimistic
  trainer. Nevertheless, Jane insisted upon inspecting the stable <i>qua</i>
  stable and Mrs. Gill, with whom she was staying, drove her over one afternoon
  to the pretty little farmhouse near the downs, and gradually the story of
  Jack Petworth's trouble was unfolded. It wasn't what he told her, but rather
  what she saw. The shabby furniture, the odd cups and saucers, the skimping
  economy revealed in a dozen ways, made her heart ache. His cheerful faith
  that "some day" he would train "the winner of a big race" almost reduced her
  to tears, and Jane Seymour was the least emotional of young ladies.</p>

  <p>She saw him again before she left Berkshire, and, going back to London,
  made a very careful study of racing; and the result of it all was that she
  accepted the Gills' invitation for the Doncaster week, and on the Thursday
  morning, rather breathlessly and self-consciously, purchased the yearling
  colt Abbeyland for £300, and, with the assistance of a knowledgeable
  stableman, had him boxed and sent to the station nearest John Petwoth's
  stable.</p>

  <p>"Why on earth are you sending him to Petworth?" asked her brother Gerald,
  aghast. "I've never heard of the fellow."</p>

  <p>"He's a very good trainer," said Jane recklessly, "one of the best in
  England."</p>

  <p>She sent a note to John :</p>

  <p>"DEAR MR. PETWORTH, am sending you a horse to train. Will you please enter
  him in the Derby and any other kind of race you think he's likely to win? And
  will you please tell me what I have to pay you, and whether I ought to send a
  cheque in advance?"</p>

  <p>John replied very gravely, very precisely. She was a little disappointed
  that he was not enthusiastic. He was, in fact, somewhat critical. He did not
  like the horse's legs, but hoped for an improvement. And he didn't exactly
  like the horse's neck, and there no improvement was possible. But he said,
  "Abbeyland has a sensible head." Jane wrote back to say that that was the
  very reason she had bought the animal, though, in truth, his head and his
  legs, no less than his neck, seemed like the head, neck, and legs of other
  horses she had seen.</p>

  <p>Abbeyland did not run as a two-year-old: she hardly expected he would. The
  only thing she hoped was that he wouldn't die. From time to time she went
  down to Berkshire and inspected her purchase, and the lean young trainer
  limped round after her with a look on his face that she might have been
  happier had she seen.</p>

  <p>"About this Abbeyland, Miss Seymour," he said awkwardly, one morning in
  early spring, "I think he's just about coming to hand, and he might win a
  little race for you.... I don't know how good he is: unfortunately I have
  nothing to try him with."</p>

  <p>"Abbeyland? Isn't he in the Derby or something?" she asked innocently.</p>

  <p>"That's what I was going to talk about. You know, Miss Seymour, it will
  cost you a hundred pounds to run him. If you scratched him now, it would only
  cost you twenty-five pounds&mdash;the entry, I mean."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"We will run him," she said magnificently.</p>

  <p>Just before she left:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you hadn't an opportunity of speaking to Mr. Blass?"</p>

  <p>He saw her colour change, and felt a brute.</p>

  <p>"I haven't had the right kind of opportunity," she said, and left rather
  hurriedly.</p>

  <p>She <i>had</i> talked to Mr. Blass, but on quite another subject than the
  advisability of his sending a few horses to the stable of a struggling
  gentleman trainer.</p>

  <p>Ronny Blass was a very rich young man. He was so rich that he felt
  superior to almost everybody he knew, for he was one of those cash-conscious
  people that are so rarely met with. It was his misfortune that he had had a
  doting mother who thought that public schools were horrid places where boys
  learnt dreadful things; she did not know that a public school is an
  institution in which the youth of Britain is taught by soulless prefects that
  if you have money you must not Talk about it&mdash;this lesson being
  emphasised into a permanent conviction by the toe of the prefect's boot or
  the long, pliant cane that he wields in the charge-room between afternoon
  prep. and tea-time.</p>

  <p>Ronny had a succession of tutors, who prepared him for the university; and
  at the university there is practically no discipline worth mentioning, and if
  a man is a cad he can, by searching, find congenial company.</p>

  <p>Ronny met with other mamma's boys, and acquired a large number of club
  ties and a smattering of Latin verse&mdash;for he was on the classical side.
  He came down from Oxford without a degree, but with the confident assurance
  that he was a man of the world. His fond mamma having gone to heaven in the
  meanwhile, Ronny's bloated bank balance was still further augmented.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that Life was a very desirable shop full of polite, even
  sycophantic, assistants, who were ready to sell him anything be wanted. One
  of the first articles he picked was Jane Seymour, who had a fiat in Park
  Lane, £2500 a year, and a brother. He picked her because she was beautiful
  and had big, solemn grey eyes and a figure like pliant steel. One night, when
  they were dancing at the Ritz, be broke the news of her good fortune. She did
  not swoon or tremble or go pale. Nor did she display any other symptoms of
  nausea as she looked up into his pallid and shapeless face.</p>

  <p>"Marry you?" she said, and added something he could not catch.</p>

  <p>They were rather near the syncopated orchestra when she said this, and he
  thought she had said, "How wonderful!" and smiled.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing wonderful about it, Jane," he began. "You're an awfully
  charming kid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'Funny' was the word I used," she said calmly.</p>

  <p>He missed a step and trod on her foot in his agitation.</p>

  <p>"I don't see&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't. There are forty reasons why I wouldn't marry you, and the
  first is, I don't love you and I don't respect you. Let us sit down, shall
  we?"</p>

  <p>They found a settee.</p>

  <p>"I won't bother you to tell me the other thirty-nine," he said stiffly,
  and, leaving her, made his way to the buffet.</p>

  <p>Gerald Seymour, her brother, heard the news over a glass of port, and was
  both sympathetic and sententious.</p>

  <p>"A woman's 'no,' old man, means nothing," he said. "Leave the matter to
  me."</p>

  <p>He was two years Jane's senior. Wisely he did not discuss the matter until
  they reached home in the early hours of the morning.</p>

  <p>"Now look here, Jane&mdash;about Ronny," he began, with that wise-old-man
  air which is so becoming in a veteran of twenty-three. "He isn't a bad
  fellow&mdash;in fact, he's one of the best. And awfully rich. He'll win the
  Derby this year&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good-night," said Jane kindly. "I'm going to bed. You ought to go
  yourself, Jerry. You're talking in your sleep already."</p>

  <p>He did not think of a suitably snappy answer until he woke up in the
  middle of the night.</p>

  <p>It was true that Ronny was an owner of great thoroughbreds. You can buy
  them "in the shop" at Doncaster or Newmarket. He knew no more about horses
  than he knew about cats, and less about his own than the most youthful of
  speculators who write bets at the street corner.</p>

  <p>But the owner of horses is an important person. People come to him and ask
  him for tips; and it is fine to stand in the centre of the parade ring and
  have jockeys touch their caps to you; and when your horse wins there are
  paragraphs in the press:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ronald Blass was present at Newbury yesterday to see his good-
  looking Swynford colt win the Berkshire Nursery..."</p>

  <p>And the routine and mechanics of racing were rather fascinating. Almost as
  fascinating as a razor can be to a child of four.</p>

  <p>On the morning after his rejections he met Jerry Seymour at the Haviland
  Club for an early cocktail.</p>

  <p>"She simply treated me like a bit of dirt, old boy," said Ronny gloomily.
  "You might imagine I was&mdash;well, anybody. Just laughed at me.... And
  there isn't a thing in the world I wouldn't have done for her."</p>

  <p>Jerry made sympathetic noises. He also said the one thing that he
  shouldn't have said.</p>

  <p>"I think it's this wretched training fellow&mdash;Petworth. She's always
  dashing down to see that wretched horse of hers."</p>

  <p>"Horse?" Mr. Blass was more interested in the horse than the trainer. "I
  didn't know she had a horse."</p>

  <p>"It's in the Derby," said Jerry.</p>

  <p>Ronny produced from his pocket a small book and turned the pages.</p>

  <p>"What's it called&mdash;Abbeyland? Yes, here it is. Why on earth has she
  got a horse in the Derby? Bless my soul, I never knew she was a racing
  girl!"</p>

  <p>"She isn't," said Jerry treacherously. "It's this fellow Petworth. He's an
  old soldier with a game leg&mdash;the fellow must be at least thirty!"</p>

  <p>"In the Derby?" said Ronny, amazed. "My dear, good chap, the girl must be
  mad! Skyward or Tester are certain to win." He looked at Jerry thoughtfully,
  pursing his lips. "I've a jolly good mind to tell you something," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Jerry's eyes opened wider.</p>

  <p>"If it is anything that will help a fellow financially, I'll be awfully
  obliged, Ronny," he said.</p>

  <p>For the moment the lunacy of Jane Seymour was forgotten, whilst the racing
  expert explained his great plan.</p>

  <p>There is no man so rich that he does not desire to be richer. Ronny Blass
  had a grievance against all the money that was not at his bankers, and out of
  his knowledge of racing, its intricacies and finesses, he had evolved a
  scheme.</p>

  <p>To an ordinary man the winning of the Derby would be a prize sufficiently
  large; but Ronny was no ordinary man. In a dark and secluded corner of the
  smoke-room he outlined the Wonderful Idea.</p>

  <p>When an owner has two horses running in a race, he may "declare to win"
  with one of them. That is to say, he may "pull" the second in order to let
  the declared animal win. The declaration, however, has a deeper significance.
  It must appear on the notice-board, and the consequence is that the horse who
  is not "declared" invariably drifts out to a long price, because the public
  know that he is not fancied and that his stable-companion is the better of
  the two.</p>

  <p>"Now, Jerry, you'll swear by this and that that you won't tell a soul...
  ."</p>

  <p>The vow was made, solemnly and soberly, and Mr. Blass revealed the swindle
  that was contemplated upon an unsuspecting public.</p>

  <p>"Mind you, old boy, it's quite in order. I'm running horses for myself,
  and not for the beastly public. If they burn their fingers, that's their
  look-out. Now, listen: I'm running Skyward and Tester in the Derby. Tester is
  a stone better horse than Skyward, and can leave him standing. I'm going to
  declare to win with Skyward. You see what I mean, old boy? The silly
  bookmakers will offer any price against Tester; a lot of my pals will back
  him at the last moment, and we'll win a fortune."</p>

  <p>Jerry, who had some sort of a conscience, squirmed a little.</p>

  <p>"But, I say, isn't that rather dishonest?"</p>

  <p>"Dishonest!" scoffed Ronny. "Don't be absurd! It's done every day, old
  boy. You don't understand these things. Now I know racing from A to Z. All
  the tricks of the trade, old man. You can stand on me."</p>

  <p>He was such a thin young man that, had Jerry accepted his invitation, he
  must have done Mr. Ronald Blass a very serious injury. Happily, Jerry did not
  accept the suggestion literally.</p>

  <p>It was a week before the Derby when Jane Seymour had a letter from
  Berkshire.</p>
  <br>

  <p class="letter">
  "<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Seymour</span>,&mdash;
  The horse is very well indeed. In fact, he is
  much better than I dreamt he would be with such legs. He went splendidly in a
  gallop to-day, but, as you know, I have nothing to gallop him with except my
  hack. I borrowed a horse from Mr. Stanton, the trainer, however, and with
  that we went the Derby distance, Abbeyland pulling over the other all the
  way&mdash;"</p>
  <br>

  <p>"What does 'pulling over' mean?" she looked up from her letter to ask.</p>

  <p>Gerald growled something about asking silly questions.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;pulling over the other all the way. I don't think he can possibly
  win the Derby: that would be too tremendous a stroke of luck for
  me&mdash;and, of course, for you. But if you wish to run him, I can get Stoll
  the jockey to ride."</p>

  <p>"What the dickens are you reading?" asked Gerald irritably.</p>

  <p>He wore a flowered silk dressing-gown, his hair was very untidy, and he
  had not shaved.</p>

  <p>"It is about Abbeyland," she said.</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes wearily. There were times when he found it very
  difficult to humour her.</p>

  <p>"Abbeyland! Who wants to know anything about Abbeyland?" he asked. "Do you
  imagine that you can buy a Derby winner for three hundred pounds? How absurd
  you are, Jane! That beastly little horse has cost you over five hundred
  pounds to train, and Heaven knows how much on entrance fees, and he hasn't
  won a race! And when I <i>mention</i>&mdash;only mention&mdash;a new car, you
  go up in the air! Ronny Blass tells me he got eighty out of his De Swinzey,
  between Oxford and Cheltenham. And for six hundred quid I could have got it!
  I could get it now," he added encouragingly.</p>

  <p>But Jane was not to be encouraged.</p>

  <p>"You have a car, Gerald," she said. "It is quite fast enough for any sane
  man. And you have a licence that is as busy as a pass-book. I really can't
  see that you have room in it for any more convictions. Poor Abbeyland!"</p>

  <p>Jerry Seymour sighed, crumpled up his serviette, and strolled to the
  window, there gloomily to survey Park Lane and the green of tree-shaded grass
  beyond.</p>

  <p>"Ronny will win the Derby&mdash;everybody knows that. His horse is
  favourite." And then, curiosity overcoming him: "What does that lame fellow
  say?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean Mr. Petworth?" she asked coldly.</p>

  <p>"Why call him 'mister'?" he demanded pettishly. "If you want to exercise
  your charity on a wretched amateur trainer, by all means do so, but for
  Heaven's sake don't give him airs!"</p>

  <p>She mastered her wrath with an effort.</p>

  <p>"He says Abbeyland is better now than he has ever been, and he thinks it's
  almost certain he will win," she said mendaciously.</p>

  <p>He gaped at her.</p>

  <p>"Abbeyland... win the Derby?"</p>

  <p>She nodded solemnly.</p>

  <p>"You're pulling my leg."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't do anything so indelicate." She folded up the letter and put
  it into her pocket. "Mr. Petworth says he has&mdash;what is the word
  ?&mdash;'tried' him, and he is certain to win."</p>

  <p>Consternation was in his face.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! I hope not," he gasped. "I've got five hundred on one of
  Ronny's."</p>

  <p>She stared at the young man.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred&mdash;pounds?"</p>

  <p>"What did you think it was?" he snapped. "You can't bet in farthings! And
  the money's as good as in my pocket."</p>

  <p>"But if you lose&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't lose, but if I did I could sell the car."</p>

  <p>"You told me yesterday that it wasn't worth a hundred. Oh, Jerry, how
  could you?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Gerald Seymour sulked out of the room and, dressing hastily, went in
  search of his friend.</p>

  <p>Now human credulity is never expressed in so remarkable a measure as in
  the game of horse-racing. Ronny listened, was at first amused, then scornful,
  and passed naturally into a condition of doubt and panic.</p>

  <p>"Abbeyland?" He scratched his nose, and again consulted his little book.
  "It's jolly well bred, old boy," he said. "That would be a disaster, wouldn't
  it? I mean, she'd be so cock-a-hoop over winning the Derby that the next time
  I asked her she'd treat me like mud."</p>

  <p>He spent an hour telephoning to various sporting
  acquaintances&mdash;knowledgeable men for whom racing had no
  mysteries&mdash;and at the end of his quest was a little comforted.</p>

  <p>There was one result to his inquiries: they set tongues wagging. Two
  sporting newspapers on the following morning had a reference to the "dark"
  Abbeyland. His name appeared in the betting at 33&mdash;1. A lay journal
  noted that:</p>

  <p>"There have been some inquiries for the dark Abbeyland, trained by
  Petworth at Newbury. This horse has yet to make his appearance on a
  racecourse, but rumour credits him with being a little more than smart."</p>

  <p>The alarmed John Petworth made a special journey to London&mdash;an
  infrequent excursion for him.</p>

  <p>"I don't know where these fellows have got this yarn about Abbeyland," he
  said, "but I assure you, Miss Seymour, that it was not from me. I don't think
  you have a ghost of a chance of winning, though he may run very well. The
  three-year-olds this year are a pretty bad lot, and it's quite conceivable
  that Abbeyland may make a good showing. But from what I've heard, Mr. Blass's
  two horses are superior to anything we've seen out, and Tester beat the
  Guineas winner easily at Newmarket a month ago."</p>

  <p>What made her ask the question she did not know.</p>

  <p>"Suppose we win, Mr. Petworth? It will be a splendid thing for you, won't
  it?"</p>

  <p>He gave her one of his rare little smiles.</p>

  <p>"It would make all the difference in the world," he said. "Incidentally,
  it would put twenty thousand pounds in your pocket."</p>

  <p>She looked at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>"In mine? Why?"</p>

  <p>Until that moment she had never even considered the possibility of gain
  from such a victory, and the sum he mentioned took her breath away. He
  explained that the stake was worth £I0,000, and that a Derby winner might be
  worth anything from £I0,000 to £20,000 as a selling proposition.</p>

  <p>"But how would it affect you?"</p>

  <p>He flushed a little.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it the custom of the owner to make a"&mdash;she hardly knew how to
  phrase the sentence&mdash;"present to the trainer?" she asked.</p>

  <p>His face had gone a dull red.</p>

  <p>"Not in this case," he said stiffly. "You have been most kind to me." And
  then, with a laugh, "Really, I don't think we need discuss such a wonderful
  possibility."</p>

  <p>"But suppose it happened?"&mdash;her eyes were fixed on his&mdash;"What
  would you&mdash;like? Because"&mdash;her voice was unaccountably
  husky&mdash;"there is nothing in the world you could ask for that I would not
  give."</p>

  <p>Her heart was thumping: how could he fail to hear it?</p>

  <p>"That is a tremendous promise," he said in a low voice&mdash;"such a
  tremendous promise that I would offer my soul to win the Derby for you."</p>

  <p>There was a long and almost painful silence.</p>

  <p>"If I do not win this race, perhaps I may win another."</p>

  <p>He had taken her hand in his, and she scarcely realised the fact. Slowly
  she withdrew it.</p>

  <p>"If you do not win a race&mdash;there are other things to be won," she
  said steadily.</p>

  <p>In the seclusion of her pretty little room overlooking the Park, Jane
  Seymour very calmly and deliberately reviewed herself, and felt no shame at
  her barefaced proposal.</p>

  <p>That there is many a slip 'twixt cup and lip is so frequently illustrated
  at the great game, that a man more experienced than Ronny Blass might have
  heard a warning voice whisper through the shouts of his exhilaration. For he
  had journeyed into Wiltshire and had witnessed the final gallop of his two
  horses. They had been tried with a steady and reliable old performer which
  had run second in the Jubilee Handicap, and the two colts had outstripped him
  at every part of the race.</p>

  <p>"The stake's in your pocket, Mr. Blass," said the trainer. "I don't see
  what is to beat yours. Shall you make a declaration?"</p>

  <p>Whereupon Ronny took him aside, and, to the consternation of the trainer,
  told his great scheme.</p>

  <p>"There will be an awful row if this comes out, Mr. Blass," said the
  trainer seriously. "I don't see any advantage, except from the betting point
  of view."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that an advantage?" asked Mr. Blass. "Don't be silly, Oscam; we'll
  clean up the ring!"</p>

  <p>He came back to London, however, feeling far from satisfied.</p>

  <p>Suppose there was a row? Suppose the disgruntled public hooted him as he
  went out to lead in the winner? Ronny Blass was a little sensitive for his
  reputation. He desired to be thought well of, and the nearer and nearer he
  came to the day of the race, the more unpleasant seemed the consequences of
  his muddleheaded scheme.</p>

  <p>On the night before the Derby be gave a dinner to his friends. It lasted
  until eight o'clock in the morning, at which hour he stepped into a cold
  shower, and from the shower to the hands of his valet. Jerry, who had spent
  the night with him, was in little better case, and over a breakfast of
  devilled bones and a large bottle of Bollinger they entered upon a grave
  discussion, the subject of which was the Integrity of Ronald Blass.</p>

  <p>"I've got to be careful, old man," said Ronny, a little thickly.
  "Reputation of the family's at stake, old boy. It'd be terrible for me, old
  man, if all those beastly cads in the crowd started howling at me, old boy,
  because I won with the wrong horse, old thing."</p>

  <p>"You're quite right, old man," said Jerry, shaking his head owlishly. "It
  would be simply fearful."</p>

  <p>"It'd be a terrible thing for the family, old boy," said Ronny. "The
  Jockey Club would get fearfully peevish, old man. I think the best thing we
  can do is to scrash Skyward and make no declaration."</p>

  <p>Jerry pondered the "scrashing" of Skyward for a long time.</p>

  <p>If Skyward was scrashed," he said, "there'd be no necess'ty for making the
  declaration."</p>

  <p>Ronny stretched out his hand and gripped his friend's.</p>

  <p>"You're a genius, old boy," he said. "Let's have another bottle. And
  remind me, old man, that I send a wire to that dear little thing we met at
  the Foxtrot Club&mdash;I promised the dear soul a tip, old boy, an' I mus'
  keep my word."</p>

  <p>At eleven o'clock two rather pallid, red-eyed young men walked steadily to
  a waiting car. They took the route through Wimbledon, and half-way up the
  main street Ronny tapped at the window. The chauffeur pulled up by the
  side-walk.</p>

  <p>"Gotta scrash that horse," he said.</p>

  <p>"Splendid idea," said Ronny languidly.</p>

  <p>In a stately fashion the top-hatted Ronny marched into the telegraph
  office, and at the second attempt, detached a form. He addressed the wire
  with the greatest care to "Racing Calendar, London." Tester would win; his
  price would be short, but what did that matter? Good old Tester! Jolly old
  Tester! There was no horse in the world like Tester! It would be in the
  newspaper that night how Tester won... "Wealthy Young owner Leads in his
  First Derby Winner." The picture of Tester would be in tomorrow's paper....
  Little pictures half begun and half formed, moved like a distorted cinema
  film through his somewhat confused mind. He wrote as evenly as possible:
  "Please scratch&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And then he remembered "the dear little thing." He must send her a tip. He
  scrawled a few lines&mdash;the last words were "much love, old thing." The
  clerk behind the counter demanded a shilling: he recollected that
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>"Done it, ole boy," he said, as he climbed back into the car. "Mus' act
  like a gen'leman old man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And then the memory of the shilling came lurching through his fuddled
  brain.</p>

  <p>"Didn't scratch it after all, old boy&mdash;silly ass! I sent wire to
  Lottie Maybridge but didn' scratch horse at all."</p>

  <p>"Does it marrer?" asked Gerald, half asleep.</p>

  <p>"Norrabit," said his friend.</p>

  <p>They were wide awake by the time they reached Epsom, for it was Jerry's
  idea that they should stop in Ewell at the house of a doctor, who was by way
  of being a Cambridge friend of Ronny's and the doctor, in his youthful
  enthusiasm, concocted a draught which just didn't kill them, but brought them
  to a condition of shaky sobriety.</p>

  <p>In the paddock they saw a limping figure, and, walking beside him, Jane
  Seymour. Ronny greeted the girl with a sickly smile.</p>

  <p>"You look ill," she said. "Are you very anxious about your horse?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he said, "but I had rather a thick night."</p>

  <p>Ronny never disguised his little excesses. He felt he was so rich that it
  was unnecessary that he should.</p>

  <p>"Where's this old crock of yours?" he asked jocularly.</p>

  <p>John Petworth pointed. Certainly Abbeyland was not a beauty. He was a
  thought too long in the legs for an Epsom horse, his neck was not his best
  feature, and his hocks would hardly have satisfied a veterinary expert.</p>

  <p>"But he can gallop," said Petworth quietly.</p>

  <p>He did not look at the girl; he had hardly looked at her since they met in
  the paddock.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to win?" asked Ronny, with heavy humour.</p>

  <p>John Petworth smiled.</p>

  <p>"I don't even know that he will lose," he said cryptically.</p>

  <p>The Gills were not at Epsom for the Derby, and they had lent the girl
  their box. After the parade, Petworth hurried round to join her, and they sat
  together watching the horses make their slow way through the dip to the
  starting-post.</p>

  <p>"Tester is a screaming favourite," he told her.</p>

  <p>"Isn't Ronny running two horses?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Only one&mdash;but then, everybody knew that Tester was the better of the
  two. There was some talk of his running them both and making a declaration to
  win with Skyward. I'm very glad he didn't."</p>

  <p>After a long pause:</p>

  <p>"Do you think Tester will win?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"He is a certainty," he said quietly. "I shall have to wait some time
  before I win my&mdash;other race&mdash;and my reward."</p>

  <p>It was the boldest sentiment John Petworth had ever expressed in his life,
  and he went hot and cold as he said it. She did not answer or even turn her
  head; her eyes were fixed upon the horses now lining up at the gate. Jane
  Seymour's heart beat a little faster as she picked out her own pink and grey
  jacket.</p>

  <p>"It would be wonderful," she said, almost under her breath,
  "if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The white tape leapt up at that moment, and the field of horses surged
  forward as one.</p>

  <p>They had not gone two hundred yards before the field was divided into
  three groups. In the first of these was Tester, leading by a length; behind
  him something that bore a black jacket, and close third, Abbeyland. Up the
  hill they pounded, passed out of sight behind the bushes, to reappear with
  Tester leading by two lengths, and going easily. John Petworth shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"The race is all over," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"But they've a long way to go yet!" she said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"The farther they go, the farther Tester will win," he said, "but
  Abbeyland is running remarkably well. I shouldn't be surprised if you are
  second."</p>

  <p>Round Tattenham Corner the field came into the straight. Tester was out by
  himself, at least four lengths clear of Abbeyland, and in this order they ran
  home, Tester winning by eight lengths, Abbeyland beating the third by a
  neck.</p>

  <p>"That's that!" said John Petworth, with a wry little smile. "But he ran
  splendidly."</p>

  <p>"I think it's wonderful of you that Abbeyland should have done so well."
  She was shaking with excitement. As she laid her hand on his: "Aren't you
  awfully pleased?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very pleased. I should have been swooning if we had won&mdash;at least, I
  am conscious!"</p>

  <p>He escorted her down to the crowded little unsaddling enclosure, a place
  usually sacred to the male of the species. They heard the cheers of the crowd
  as an exalted Ronny led in his horse, and then, guided by Petworth, she went
  out to meet Abbeyland.</p>

  <p>"He ran right well," said the jockey, as be slipped off and began
  unbuckling the girths, "but he never had a chance with that fellow."</p>

  <p>"You did well to get second, Stoll," said Jane.</p>

  <p>The glory of owning even a Derby second was beginning to glow within
  her.</p>

  <p>"That was easy. I could have beaten the third by a couple of lengths,"
  said the little jockey, as he pulled off the saddle and struggled towards the
  weighing room.</p>

  <p>She waited by Abbeyland, who seemed in no sense wearied, and accepted her
  caresses as his right, and then&mdash;A distant voice bawled:</p>

  <p>"Don't pay!"</p>

  <p>John Petworth looked round in amazement.</p>

  <p>"An objection?" he said, and, even as he spoke, the red flag went up by
  the number board.</p>

  <p>Inside the stewards' room Ronny, in a state of frenzy, faced the
  imperturbable stewards.</p>

  <p>"I know all about that, Mr. Blass," said the senior steward patiently,
  "but here is the point: did you or did you not scratch a horse this
  morning?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I scratched him!" Ronny almost howled.</p>

  <p>"From the Wimbledon Post Office at eleven-thirty-six?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know the name of the Post Office, but I scratched him. I
  scratched Skyward&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The senior steward shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately the telegram has been sent down to us, though it did not
  reach us before your jockey weighed out."</p>

  <p>Ronny took the yellow form with his shaking hand and read:</p>
  <br>

  <p class="telegram" style="text-align:center">
  SCRATCH TESTER. MUCH LOVE, OLD THING. &mdash; RONALD BLASS.</p>
  <br>

  <p>"And may I say, Mr. Blass," said the steward icily, "that when you address
  officials of the Jockey Club, it is not necessary to be affectionate!"</p>

  <p>Like a man in a dream, John Petworth went back to the box to tell the news
  of the disqualification.</p>

  <p>"He must have been sending another wire and got them mixed," he explained.
  "But isn't it wonderful? Isn't it a miracle..."</p>

  <p>She lifted up her face; it seemed almost like an invitation, which John
  Petworth was too great a gentleman not to accept...</p>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5"></a>5. &mdash; THE CROSS OF THE THIEF</h2>

  <h3>First published as "One With Authority," <i>Royal Magazine</i>, September
  1922</h3>

  <p class="first">PAMELA WILSON once lectured the awe-stricken first-year
  girls at Newnham on the subject of "Romance."</p>

  <p>"Romance," said she, "is one of the curiosities of History; it belongs to
  an age that knew not electric light or the aeroplane. It has gone with the
  true colour of the East and the popularity of the lute as an adjunct to
  courtship; with political assassinations and the stage coach. Romance to-day
  is something to be dusted but never used."</p>

  <p>Pamela left Newnham at a tender age. This is undeniable, though she would
  have been both amazed and indignant at the accusation of youthfulness. For it
  seemed to her that great erudition had aged her prematurely. This is an
  illusion from which the very young and the very clever are never quite
  free.</p>

  <p>She was twenty-two, nicely shaped, with a skin like silk and eyes of
  sapphire-blue. And she wrote. Her special subjects were Syrian history and
  the growth of the Christian Church. Such matters as the Arianism, Gnostic
  heresies, and the Apologia of Justin of Iranaeus, were to her more real and
  understandable than is Liberalism, Conservatism, and the pronouncements of
  ex- President Wilson to the average man of to-day.</p>

  <p>She was a good girl but not goody, being so clever that she was superior
  to piety. When she was twenty-one, a learned review published her monograph
  on Joseph of Arimathea. By the time she left Cambridgeshire her views were
  quoted with respect by white-bearded gentlemen, who, picturing her as a
  white-headed lady devoting a placid lifetime to the study of doctrinarianism,
  wrote her long letters which began "Dear Colleague."</p>

  <p>It occurred to Pamela one day, when she was sitting in her little Chelsea
  flat, her cheeks bulging with a chunk of well-advertised toffee, that the
  fabric of her growing reputation as an Authority was based upon the
  discoveries of other people. That she was living on the brains of dead
  writers, presenting conclusions&mdash;in a novel way, it is true&mdash;which
  she had found ready- made in the library at Newnham.</p>

  <p>She put down the camisole she was sewing and puckered her brows. For the
  first time in her life there came to her a sense of her inadequacy, and it
  was a disturbing sensation. She must go out into the world and find things
  for herself. She must make revelations upon which unborn students of Newnham
  would theorise and write books which they could paraphrase and improve upon.
  No, not improve upon. She could not go so far as to think disloyally of
  herself.</p>

  <p>Her opportunity came almost instantly. There had been a discovery in
  Palestine&mdash;a momentous discovery. Pamela scoffed at its authenticity.
  She scoffed in six hundred scornful words which she sent to the <i>Daily
  Megaphone</i>, and which the <i>Daily Megaphone</i> printed under a
  respectable heading, describing Pamela Wilson as "The Well-Known Authority
  upon the Holy Land."</p>

  <p>There followed in a few days a telephone message, and Pamela presented
  herself at Megaphone House.</p>

  <p>"Good lord!" said the editor in dismay," I thought you were much
  older!"</p>

  <p>Pamela flushed and was inclined to be haughty.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said the editor, recovering from the shock, as editors do
  recover from shocks, with extraordinary rapidity. "We want you to go out to
  Palestine and write us half a dozen articles. Will you do it?"</p>

  <p>Pamela knew that it was undignified to lose control of her voice, and that
  her tremulous acceptance did not accord with her character as "A Well- Known
  Authority on the Holy Land."</p>

  <p>"You've never been, of course?" said the editor. "I guessed that from the
  assurance in your article which, by the way, has been extensively quoted in
  France and Germany. Come and see me tomorrow, and I will fix everything for
  you. By the way, if you are in any kind of trouble, see Yisma Effendi. That
  is a very secret and confidential tip from the Foreign Office."</p>

  <p>Pamela went home elated, yet in a way depressed. It was glorious that she
  was going to see with her own eyes... but the editor had not treated her as
  an unusual being. Perhaps he was used to meeting Well-Known Authorities. She
  comforted herself with that thought, but decided that the men who conducted
  the daily press lacked that enthusiasm and stately courtesy which was so
  charming a characteristic of the gentlemen who edited or wrote for the more
  important reviews&mdash;one of whom, the Dean of Wenbury, hearing that she
  was going to Palestine, sent her a letter of introduction to Brother
  Bokoslava: "You will find him a charming fellow; my son was at Oxford with
  him."</p>

  <p>On a day, Pamela sailed for Egypt, and the news of her departure was wired
  in code to Moscow, Erzrum, Alexandria, and Jaffa by a hook-nosed and shabby
  man who had shadowed her for a week.</p>

  <p>Pamela did not know this; the editor of the <i>Daily Megaphone</i>, who
  knew such things as the reason the Grand Duke Muchoff never appeared in
  public and the date of the next General Election, even he did not know this,
  or he would have sent a real reporter to follow Pamela and report
  happenings.</p>

  <p>Some weeks after Pamela sailed and four years before the Turkish guns
  thundered over the Black Sea, Mahmud Ali sat in the sun near the Gate of
  David, waiting for chance fortune, his back to the broad stone slabs that
  even Herod had looked upon as ancient, his eyes fixed alternately upon the
  lower road which leads down to Beth-salem and the passing throng.</p>

  <p>There was nothing in all Jerusalem to tempt Mahmud to work. His clean- cut
  face, his slightly aquiline nose, the insolent breeding of his creamy-brown
  face, all testified to his House, for he was of a stock which had come into
  Palestine in the days of Saladin.</p>

  <p>He watched the passers-by with impressive interest&mdash;the goat-herds,
  the shepherds, the donkey train newly come from Bethlehem and was so watching
  when Arak el Selum, a notorious gossip, dropped down by his side&mdash;not
  unseen, for Mahmud had recognised him from the tail of his eye.</p>

  <p>"There is a talk in Beth-salem that you will be taken by soldiers and cast
  into prison," said Arak cheerfully.</p>

  <p>Mahmud chewed in thought, but made no answer.</p>

  <p>"Also Mahomet ben Abra will beat you with a stick because you spied on him
  for Yisma."</p>

  <p>"Croaking dog," said Mahmud, "how long is it since vultures learned to
  sing?"</p>

  <p>The mean, pockmarked face of Arak creased in a grin. He caught up a
  handful of pebbles and jingled with them idly.</p>

  <p>"Men who rob alone," quoted he, "have company in prison."</p>

  <p>"Sheep go in flocks to slaughter," answered Mahmud readily. "I will see
  Mahomet ben Abra in hell yet&mdash;he and the fat women of his house."</p>

  <p>Even Arak was shocked at the shameless reference to the harem, and made a
  disparaging noise.</p>

  <p>"How can a man consider this old goat," asked Mahmud, "and such a man as
  I, who have been to the ends of the world? I am the servant of Yisma
  <sup>1</sup> the Frank, and that is true. All men know this, and he knows
  well that they know&mdash;for truly he is the Ear of El Kuds, the Sanctuary.
  But if I were a lone man I should mock such low and foolish men as M'met ben
  Abra. For I have sat amidst the roses of Shiraz, and read the verses of Hafix
  written in gold. Remember this also, Kaffir,"&mdash;he wagged the insult home
  with his crooked finger,&mdash;" that I have been to Long Island&mdash;such a
  place as you cannot imagine. As a child I lived with the Mericani, learnt at
  their schools and worshipped in their mosques. I know their poets,
  Long-fello, Shakespeare&mdash;say that, ignorant dog!"</p>

  <p><sup>1</sup> <sub>Literally, "He will bear."</sub><br></p>

  <p>But Arak would not frame the clumsy word. "Sakaspah" he could manage, but
  no more.</p>

  <p>Mahmud sat with his keen face toward the road which leads past Silvam.
  Perhaps he was thinking of the eccentric gentleman whose freakish fancy
  carried a little Arab boy to America, and whose death released a lank youth
  from the irksome restraint of a New England boarding-school to the joyous
  life of the Near East.</p>

  <p>A faint sound came to them, and Arak came up to his feet as though he were
  on springs.</p>

  <p>"It is the hour of prayer," he said; "come with me to the Mosque of
  Yasul."</p>

  <p>"Go to the devil!" responded the other, and flung a stone after the
  retreating Arak&mdash;flung it without effort, yet with such effect that the
  tarboosh was whisked from the other's head as by an invisible string.</p>

  <p>Mahmud picked himself up, and stood for a minute or two with his eyes
  fixed on the gate as though loath to take himself away.</p>

  <p>Then he saw what he was waiting for. Tewfik Effendi, very stout and very
  dark, a heavy black moustache ending the lower part of his face. Tewfik
  walked with difficulty because he had dropsy, and the two soldiers who
  followed him had to shuffle at a snail's pace.</p>

  <p>The Chief of the Police saw Mahmud, frowned, and beckoned him.</p>

  <p>"What thieving pig are you?" asked he, "that you should steal from the
  Nazarene Fathers of the Ass?"</p>

  <p>"Effendi," said Mahmud, with great care, "I am neither pig nor thief, but
  a follower of the Prophet who said: 'You shall not eat of that which is
  unclean,' and as for thieving, I know a man who works with a Nazarene priest
  and lies about the finding of a certain cross."</p>

  <p>Tewfik Effendi turned yellow.</p>

  <p>"Men who know too much must find new heads," he countered. "You have been
  denounced as a traitor to the Divine Commander of the Faithful, and I have
  hung men for less&mdash;even on the public places of Jerusalem I have hung
  them."</p>

  <p>Mahmud smiled.</p>

  <p>"I saw a magistrate hung," he said, "also Abdul Mahmet Bey of Lower Syria.
  Who shall say that we will not hang together, you and I?"</p>

  <p>Tewfik Effendi made a little face and swallowed hard.</p>

  <p>"God send you grace, Mahmud Ali," he said mildly; "you address the Chief
  of Police as though he were a donkey-boy. Now come soon to my house by the
  Babsith-Maryam, and I will give you coffee and a cigarette. You are a bright
  and comely boy&mdash;with my help, who knows&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows?" mocked Mahmud gravely. He waited until a corner of the street
  hid the Commissioner of Police from sight, then he clapped his hands gently
  and a beggar, who sat against the opposite wall drowsing in the shade, rose
  swiftly.</p>

  <p>"Go follow Tewfik Effendi, and bring me word of all that happens," he
  said, and the man departed. He himself took the Street of David at a rapid
  pace. He turned sharply to the left, by the Syrian Convent, and crossing by
  the Citadel he reached the White House within the Jaffa Gate, passed unbidden
  to the gardens and scarcely waited for the invitation which decency demanded,
  before he pushed apart the green doors of Yisma Effendi's reception-room.</p>

  <p>That calm young-old man sat cross-legged on a <i>diwan</i> smoking a
  cigarette through eight inches of amber tube. On his knees was outspread a
  large vellum map, and littering the dark red <i>diwan</i> on either side were
  innumerable documents.</p>

  <p>He looked up with a little frown as Mahmud Ali entered.</p>

  <p>"Peace upon thy house, Yisma Effendi, and great prosperity," said Ali,
  squatting in the centre of the room as he spoke, and offering the tribute of
  a hurried salaam.</p>

  <p>"Upon you peace, Mahmud Ali," responded John Hazell. "What brings you
  here?"</p>

  <p>Mahmud was eyeing his host curiously. Yisma Effendi wore his robe of grey
  silk with the inevitable cummerbund of scarlet, and the tarboosh on his head
  was set at that rakish angle which the rich Mohammedan youths of Jerusalem
  affected.</p>

  <p>"Effendi," aid Mahmud Ali, "there is talk here of a miracle which the
  Patriarch of a new Moskobi religion has performed."</p>

  <p>Hazell smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"Do you come at my full hour to tell me of miracles?" he asked in the
  Syrian-Arabic, "or of a new Moskobi religion? For I tell you, Mahmud Ali,
  that never the sun comes up over Palestine but it sees a new sect, and never
  does it set save on the miracle of a day."</p>

  <p>Mahmud Ali closed his mouth tightly and shrugged his shoulders. Hazell
  waited a little while, then he asked:</p>

  <p>"Tell me news of my friends&mdash;such news as does not come to me through
  the windows of my house."</p>

  <p>Mahmud Ali ignored the gentle sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"There is a great feud between Selik Arabi and the Sheik of the wild
  people beyond Bethany&mdash;the Mutesarrif has sent ten soldiers, under
  Captain Abdullah Harsim, to bring in the Sheik. Tewfik Effendi goes often to
  the Wadi Balak to meet an Armenian priest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who pays him money because he lies scandalously," interrupted Hazell, and
  grinned at his spy's discomfiture.</p>

  <p>"Effendi," said he in an injured tone, "this I could have told you three
  days since, but I wished to know his business&mdash;now I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"This Armenian has discovered the Cross of the Thief, as all the world
  knows," said Hazell. "It has been concealed for a thousand years in the roof
  of a Khan near by Shechem. That Khan between the Tomb of the Forty Prophets
  and the Well of the Woman of Samaria."</p>

  <p>He was telling one of those periodical scandals which set Jerusalem in a
  ferment. There are men, evil, soulless men, who make God a factor of
  commerce; who barter and cheat in the name of religion. From time to time
  they organise great schemes of plunder, and such a scheme had come to
  fruition in these past days.</p>

  <p>Reduced to penury, the Order (its clever organiser called it "The Faith of
  the True Armenian Church ") was at its last gasp when came the providential
  discovery of the Cross of the Penitent Thief. Widely advertised, money flowed
  into the coffers of the Armenian Monastery. Copts and Greeks, Latins and
  Anglicans, had thundered their denunciation of the fraud. Moscow had foamed
  at the mouth and had written passionately strange characters; even the
  sedater English reviews had been stirred to vexation. Incidentally, Pamela
  Wilson had written six hundred sarcastic words in the <i>Daily Megaphone</i>,
  which had disturbed the True Armenians more profoundly than any other
  criticism, for people read and foreign correspondents quote a daily
  newspaper, whereas they never by any chance open the pages of the learned
  monthlies.</p>

  <p>Yisma Effendi&mdash;his real name was Hazell, and he was Intelligence
  Officer for five nations&mdash;sat motionless on his <i>diwan</i>, his chin
  in his hand, his eyes fixed upon the tessellated pavement near the
  fountain.</p>

  <p>"You may go, Mahmud," he said at last, and Mahmud, knowing himself to be
  rather a man of hearing than man of doing, salaamed and went.</p>

  <p>For five long minutes Yisma continued staring at the sun-flooded court and
  at the glittering drops that were flung from the fountain's feathery top, and
  then he clapped his hands.</p>

  <p>From nowhere, as it seemed&mdash;though in reality he came through a
  narrow door at the corner of the apartment&mdash;appeared an old man, who
  salaamed in reverence.</p>

  <p>"Send to me Dhin," said Yisma, and the servant withdrew noiselessly.</p>

  <p>Dhin came, but through no narrow door, being of a size which precluded
  such finesse. He was very fat, and waddled in his walk. His face,
  clean-shaven, was alive with humour, his forehead everlastingly damp. He
  saluted with great earnestness.</p>

  <p>"Effendi," he said importantIy, "I was at prayers when your Excellency
  sent for me, for knowing how great is the reliance which you place in me, and
  how important is my place in your lordship's household, I go not to the
  Mosque, but recite the <i>Surah</i> from ' In the name of God' to 'who go not
  astray' three times&mdash;this I do on your lordship's house-top over against
  the tent, for I am a modest man."</p>

  <p>"To-night," said Hazell, giving the recital no attention, "there comes
  from Jaffa a young Frankish woman. Watching her will be the Armenian Yussef,
  who runs and carries for the Monastery of the True Armenians. At the hour of
  <i>Subh</i> that man must be here and none must see him coming..."</p>

  <p>"At the hour of <i>Subh</i>," said the man earnestly, "I pray in the
  Mosque of Sidna Omar for my brother's wife who has a carbuncle on her neck.
  Lord, I entreat you by the hundred and twenty and four thousand prophets of
  Islam, that you find another hour, for though, as God knows, there is no
  other man in Jerusalem who loves you better, yet I am a poor sinner."</p>

  <p>"Go in peace," said Yisma.</p>

  <p>"O Effendi," pleaded Dhin the Fat, "if you give me two poor medizi for
  alms... "</p>

  <p>"No.''</p>

  <p>"One miserable medizi," begged the other, "as bashish to the spirits, O my
  beloved... "</p>

  <p>"Get out!" snarled Yisma, and the man waddled to the door. Here he paused
  and raised his solemn hand. "Though I dwell for ever in Gehenna," he said,
  his voice quivering, "I will do what you ask, risking my soul's salvation for
  no more than five piastres to give to the poor, who sit at the gate of the
  Mosque."</p>

  <p>Yisma pointed to the open door, and with one more supplicating glance the
  big figure was swallowed up in the dark doorway.</p>

  <p>To Pamela Wilson the journey from Jaffa to Jerusalem was a pilgrimage of
  delight, in spite of the bleak unloveliness of the country through which the
  train puffed and struggled. The blue-grey mountains of Judea had a mystery,
  the olive plantations were a joy to her eyes. She passed through strange,
  queer- smelling towns, jumbles of squalid buildings which had once been great
  cities, the dowries of kings' daughters, the abiding-places of Solomon and of
  Pharaoh. The little train smoked and spluttered over battlefields where
  Philistines and Jews had fought for the supremacy of their small world ; it
  climbed into stark cañons, rumbled across little rivers which David had
  known, and came, after four hours that seemed like minutes, to the outskirts
  of a dusty station labelled in French-Arabic and German and English.</p>

  <p>She was in Jerusalem!</p>

  <p>The courteous gentleman who throughout the journey had acted as guide-
  book and commentator, smiled at her obvious excitement.</p>

  <p>"Well, you are there&mdash;or nearly there," he said, "and now you will be
  able to see for yourself how much truth there is in the ridiculous
  story."</p>

  <p>He was a sallow-faced man with a slight black moustache. She thought he
  was foreign, although he spoke English perfectly. And, of course, Pamela
  Wilson had talked quite frankly about the object of her visit. There was no
  reason why she should not, especially, after seeing her name on the
  suit-case, he had asked if she was "<i>the</i> Pamela Wilson" who had written
  so entrancingly of the True Armenian artless fraud.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I have read the article. It was taken over and translated by a
  German newspaper, the <i>Lokalanzeiger</i>, I think. It has made quite a stir
  in archeological circles."</p>

  <p>She was fluttered by this tribute to her fame.</p>

  <p>"No, I am going to Jerusalem on business," he said, and introduced himself
  as Mr. John Scarpi. His manner was perfect: he was differential, quiet, and,
  in a sense, reserved.</p>

  <p>The train waited for some time before it pulled into the station, and
  Pamela went to the window and looked out. When she came back she laughed.</p>

  <p>"I almost feel as if that man were keeping guard on the door," she said;
  "every time I have been to the window I have seen him there. The conductor
  called him 'Yussef,' and he seems to be well-known."</p>

  <p>"A dragoman probably," said Mr. Scarpi; "he is keeping near you in the
  hope of your engaging him. I will see."</p>

  <p>He looked out of the window and said something in a language which was not
  Arabic. The man looked scared and scuttled away. This Pamela saw, looking
  over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>He collected her baggage and handed her into a cab; glancing backward as
  she drove away, she saw him talking to the man Yussef.</p>

  <p>That disreputable person was glad when the interview was through, for the
  trailing of tourists was not to his liking. Moreover, he had an assignation
  with a woman in the Haret el Maidan. He stopped at a wine-shop near the
  station to drink the dust of travelling from his throat, and a fat man
  approached him.</p>

  <p>"Peace on you, Yussef. You have come a long journey?" seating himself
  opposite the Armenian.</p>

  <p>"On you peace, fat man," said Yussef arrogantly; "drink wine?"</p>

  <p>Dhin shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is against my religion," he said, "and the wine here is not good."</p>

  <p>"Then go to the devil," said Yussef, swallowing.</p>

  <p>Dhin selected a large bottle with great care, and smashed it on the man's
  head. The methods of Dhin were neither subtle nor refined.</p>

  <p>"This pig insulted my faith," he explained, when the keeper of the shop
  came. "Help me put him into a carriage and I will take him to the Nazarene
  Hospital."</p>

  <p>"May he roast in hell," responded his compatriot.</p>

  <p>When Yussef the Armenian recovered his senses, he was lying on a marble
  seat, and a man was looking down at him with a quizzical smile. Yussef
  groaned and sat up, fingering his damaged head.</p>

  <p>"Yisma Effendi," he said, "your servant did this, and I go to Tewfik
  Effendi for justice."</p>

  <p>"What happened to the Frankish woman whom you followed from Jaffa?" asked
  Yisma, and the man scowled.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing," he said.</p>

  <p>"To whither has your master taken her?" asked Yisma, and the man's eyes
  opened wide.</p>

  <p>"She has gone?"</p>

  <p>Yisma nodded.</p>

  <p>"When I sent for her she was gone," he said, which was the truth. Five
  minutes after her arrival at Fast Hotel, Pamela Wilson had gone out and had
  not returned.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing," said Yussef, but with a certain satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Yisma clapped his hands and two men came. "Burn his feet until he speaks,"
  said Yisma simply. Yussef waited only so long as would enable him to discover
  if Yisma Effendi threatened unfaithfully, then he spoke, nursing a scorched
  sole.</p>

  <p>To Pamela Wilson, the sudden appearance of her travelling companion at her
  elbow was a delightful surprise.</p>

  <p>Mr. John Scarpi, hat in hand, a smile upon his thin, sallow face, was
  pleased with her pleasure, being human.</p>

  <p>"You will get lost in these narrow streets," he said, "and really, there
  is nothing worth buying here&mdash;all the relics are fakes and imported by
  the car load. Let me show you the real bazaars."</p>

  <p>A carriage was near at hand: she thought it was a cab, and jumped in
  without hesitation. Later&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Surely we have left the city?" she said, pulling aside the curtains.</p>

  <p>"There is a suburb just outside," he answered glibly, "and it is there
  that the more interesting things are sold."</p>

  <p>They were a long time reaching the suburb. When at last the sweating
  horses were jerked back on their haunches, she alighted, to find herself
  before a small and dilapidated house, half surrounded and wholly hidden from
  the road by stunted olive trees.</p>

  <p>"Will you come in, please?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Is this a shop?" she asked, and then his hand gripped her arm and she was
  flung through the open doorway. She stumbled and fell to her knees on the
  earthen floor, speechless with surprise and fear.</p>

  <p>Mr. Scarpi shut the thick door and bolted it.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>She sprang to the door, but his arm was about her waist and she was
  dragged back.</p>

  <p>"Don't make a fuss or you'll be sorry," he said, and his voice was sharp
  and threatening. "You can scream if you want, but you are miles from anybody
  except the Arab shepherds."</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning... ?" she began in a shaking voice.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he commanded, and pointed to an untidy bed. "I am keeping you
  here until night, and then you will be taken to the Convent of the True
  Armenians. In that convent you will have a vision, eh? A wonderful vision.
  You will then write to all your friends and say that the discovery of the
  cross, about which you have written so cleverly, was a true discovery. You
  will write this, saying also that in your repentance at finding how wicked
  you have been, you have become a convert to the True Armenian faith."</p>

  <p>She could only look at him open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"You have done me a great deal of harm," he went on, "for I am the head of
  the Order. Subscriptions toward the building of a new monastery have fallen
  from a thousand Egyptian pounds a day to a few paltry roubles. I am putting
  matters to you very plainly, Miss Wilson. I am a business man, you may know
  my name."</p>

  <p>He took a card-case from his pocket, extracted a large square paste- board
  and handed it to her.</p>

  <p>She took it from his hand and tore it up without looking at the elegantly
  engraved script.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to know who you are&mdash;it is preposterous... absurd!" she
  said energetically. "Do you imagine that I will submit to your ridiculous
  proposal? I shall go straight to the British Consulate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You will never have an opportunity of going straight to the British
  Consul," said her captor, calmly lighting a cigar. "Don't you realise that if
  I were mad enough to let you go, I should probably spend the rest of my life
  in prison? You will find the Sisters at the convent a little dull of
  understanding, for they are mostly peasant girls from Georgia. I practically
  bought them from their parents&mdash;I had to make a start somehow, and
  converts came very slowly. With your intellectual attainments, you ought to
  establish a moral supremacy over them and become in time a kind of a saint. I
  have views on that matter too," he said, flicking the ash off his cigar. "If
  you take my advice, Miss Wilson, you will bow to the inevitable, and be glad
  that nothing worse has happened to you or is likely to happen. I tell you
  this, that if there is a chance, the remotest chance, of my being saddled
  with this offence, I shall not go to prison without cause. You are a very
  attractive young lady," he said significantly, "and I am showing the greatest
  self-restraint in treating you as though you were the plainest and least
  desirable woman on earth."</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>"I have friends," she began.</p>

  <p>"Not in El Kuds," he corrected. "Here you are a tourist. Even in England
  you have not many friends, and no relations."</p>

  <p>At that moment a name came to her memory that she had not recalled since
  her interview with the editor of the <i>Daily Megaphone</i>. She had
  dismissed the suggestion which the editor had made that in time of trouble
  she should call upon the assistance of somebody who had been recommended by
  the Foreign Office, because she had never dreamt for one moment that she ever
  would be in any trouble. After all, the world was civilised, romance was
  dead, and these were not the days of brigandage and outrage.</p>

  <p>"Yisma Effendi will know," she said at random.</p>

  <p>It was bluff on her part, for there was no particular reason why Yisma
  Effendi&mdash;whoever he might be&mdash;should find himself in the slightest
  degree interested in her plight. But the effect upon the man was magical. He
  leapt to his feet, and in the half-light she saw his face grow pale.</p>

  <p>"Yisma Effendi!" he stammered; "do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"He is a personal friend of mine," she said boldly. "I was going to call
  on him when you took me away."</p>

  <p>He licked his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"You said nothing to me in the train about Yisma Effendi," he accused.
  "You told me you had no friends at all in Jerusalem. You are lying!"</p>

  <p>She herself was amazed at the change of tone her words had produced.</p>

  <p>"He knows I am in Jerusalem," she said, again drawing upon her
  imagination.</p>

  <p>She saw the hand that stroked his chin shake, and his lips were
  bloodless.</p>

  <p>"You are lying," he said at last. "Somebody in London told you about Yisma
  Effendi, and you have only just remembered the name. Ah! That is true!." His
  finger jerked to her triumphantly.</p>

  <p>She had opened her mouth to speak, when there came through the one
  deep-barred window of the room a shrill, mournful whistle. The man looked
  round, unbolted the door, and rushed out. In a few seconds he was back, and
  was pulling the bed from the wall. Beneath was a square of faded carpet that
  hid a trap-door of well-worn cedar. He pulled up the flap, disclosing a
  flight of steps.</p>

  <p>"Go down there," he said curtly.</p>

  <p>"I refuse!" said Pamela in defiance.</p>

  <p>His hand shot out and seized her by her dress.</p>

  <p>"Go down," he said between his teeth, "or I'll throw you down."</p>

  <p>She bit her lips, and summoning her courage, descended slowly down the
  uneven steps. Her head was only clear of the floor when he dropped the trap,
  replaced the carpet, and pushed back the bed. He had hardly time to stroll
  into the open with a look of unconcern, when the four horsemen drew up before
  the door and Yisma Effendi leapt lightly to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, Father," said Yisma Effendi.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, my son," replied the other gravely. In his modern
  well-fitting dress, the attitude of parental authority sat grotesquely upon
  him. He looked up into the heavy face of TewfIk Effendi, who grimaced
  horribly, surveyed the two soldiers who rode behind the fat Commissioner of
  Police with a frown of wonder, and then:</p>

  <p>"Are you going far, Yisma Effendi?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not very far," said Yisma. "No farther than this house, I hope. I want
  Miss Wilson."</p>

  <p>"Miss Wilson?" The man was all open-eyed astonishment. "Why, isn't that
  the lady who travelled up from Jaffa with me by train?"</p>

  <p>"It is the lady you have been waiting for at Jaffa for the past
  fortnight," said Yisma briefly. "The same lady you drove from the Bazaar of
  Weeping to this house, where that very same lady is now concealed."</p>

  <p>The other's look was one of pain and forgiveness.</p>

  <p>"I certainly drove the lady to the Gate of David and left her there," he
  said. "I have not seen her since. If you think she is in this house, you are
  at liberty to search."</p>

  <p>"I shall search with or without liberty," said Yisma, and walked into the
  one apparent room of the house. He looked round and came out again.</p>

  <p>"Where is she?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"I tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look!" Yisma pointed to the floor, where the fragments of the man's
  visiting-card were scattered. "You do not tear your own card up, do you, my
  friend? Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Yisma made a sign to the soldiers, who had dismounted, and they seized the
  man and flung him down upon his face.</p>

  <p>"Blindfold him;" and then: "My friend," said Yisma, "at your infernal
  monastery you have a hoard of gold and you have many years of life before
  you." He spoke in Syrian-Arabic, and his harsh words fell on the other's ears
  like the stroke of a hammer. "Will you live to enjoy what you have, or will
  you die because you want more than you can spend?"</p>

  <p>"This is an outrage," sobbed the man.</p>

  <p>"Strike," said Yisma, and the quivering victim heard the whistle of a
  sword as it came from a scabbard.</p>

  <p>And then something stung his neck, and he fainted.</p>

  <p>Yet it was only the thong of Yisma's riding-whip that struck him
  lightly.</p>

  <p>"Glad to be alive?" asked Yisma pleasantly, when the man stared around.
  "Now the next time it shall be the sword, by Allah!"</p>

  <p>"She is in the cellar under the bed," quavered the prisoner.</p>

  <p>Pamela Wilson came blinking into the daylight to meet the steady grave
  eyes of an agreeable-looking young Turkish gentleman.</p>

  <p>Half-way back to Jerusalem she had recovered herself sufficiently to talk
  of the British Consul, and the steps she would take to secure satisfaction
  for the behaviour to which she had been subjected.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so, Miss Wilson," said Yisma, who was riding at her side.
  His voice was quiet, but he seemed amused.</p>

  <p>"If this man is an agent of the True Armenians," she said, "I shall
  complain direct to the head of the Order, Father John Bokoslava. I have a
  letter of introduction to him from the Dean of Wenbury."</p>

  <p>"Take my advice," said Yisma, "and don't present it."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she asked in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Because the gentleman we have just left behind with the
  soldiers&mdash;Tewfik Effendi has moments of extreme delicacy and did not
  wish to have him bastinadoed in your presence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, what about him?" she said, when he paused.</p>

  <p>"He is John Bokoslava," said Yisma, and laughed softly to himself all the
  way back to Jerusalem.</p>

     name="story6"></a>6. &mdash; BILL AND THE TAPPERS</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Clues</i>, June 10, 1928</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE was a very clever detective at Scotland Yard called
  "Bill."</p>

  <p>Bill was wandering through Berkshire on a wet and rather stormy evening,
  and came to a nice little house that had been built in the midst of a pine
  wood. It was the one of the four houses in the neighbourhood that Bill was
  anxious to see. Mr. Crollen, a florid man, sat at the open window of his
  dressing-room, for it was a warm evening, and from time to time addressed his
  pretty wife, who was drinking a cup of tea.</p>

  <p>"Sooner or later they're pretty sure to get wisdom, and then it's you and
  me for a nice long world voyage, Lou&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You and I," she corrected, being something of a purist. He was absurdly
  proud of her erudition, and purred gratefully.</p>

  <p>"Tha's so. You and I&mdash;<i>and</i> me! This Scotland Yard
  aren't&mdash;isn't all bone-headed. A feller in town&mdash;Joe Saute, the
  'con.' man&mdash;told me they've got a whale of a feller up at the
  Yard&mdash;Bill Somep'n. I've heard about this feller from a boy that's
  workin' the Paris hotels...."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bill!" she wailed wearily; "there's always a Bill somewhere! There
  was a Bill at the O. and E. so darned clever that he couldn't find his
  latch-key."</p>

  <p>There was an esoteric jest here. Mr. Crollen laughed heartily. This Lou of
  his had been an operator on the Oriental and European Telegraph Company when
  he first met her and introduced her to a wider and more expensive life.</p>

  <p>She left ten minutes ahead of the city detective who came to arrest her
  for utilising information that came across the wire for her own private
  enrichment.</p>

  <p>She saw Crollen crane his head out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Saw a car pass the drive," he explained, "then the engines stopped.
  Hullo!"</p>

  <p>Bill was walking carelessly up the gravelled drive, smoking a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>Lou, at her husband's side, saw the intruder.</p>

  <p>"You'd better go down and see what that kid wants."</p>

  <p>Mr. Crollen obeyed.</p>

  <p>He came back in ten minutes.</p>

  <p>"Run out of petrol, that's all," he explained, "and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lou had a small instrument at her ear, and now raised a warning
  finger.</p>

  <p>"D.H. 97 coming through," she said; "now for three hours hell's
  dullness."</p>

  <p>They forgot all about Bill, for at 11.47 that night Mr. John Mortimer
  confided his secret to the ether.</p>

  <p>When Senator Grannit went to Paris, from New York, taking with him eighty
  thousand dollars in negotiable stock, the European press hardly commented
  upon the circumstances under which he was relieved of his wealth, though it
  was especially interesting to the student of criminology. Nobody knew that
  the Senator carried this money, except the Bank of France and Mr. Grannit
  himself. Yet within an hour of his arrival in Paris, the money was
  lifted.</p>

  <p>Scotland Yard investigated the matter at a distance when Sir Hubert Loam,
  reaching his house in Berkeley Square, found a young man waiting to receive a
  cheque on account of a deal he had concluded when he was still on board the
  <i>Mauretania</i>.</p>

  <p>The cheque was an open one, and was handed to the representative of The
  North &amp; South Land Syndicate without hesitation. It was presented and
  paid&mdash;but the money never went to the Land Syndicate. Nor had the suave
  clerk, waiting in Sir Hubert's drawing-room, the slightest association with
  known syndicates of any kind.</p>

  <p>That is when the police began to take notice. There followed almost at
  once the case of Mrs. Crimack-Leggatt of Pittsburg. She lost exactly ten
  thousand pounds' worth of jewels which she had sent to be reset.</p>

  <p>"The whole thing is rather extraordinary," said Inspector Lander, Chief of
  the Confidence Branch at Scotland Yard. "Neither of these people is
  talkative; they made no friends on the voyage; yet in some way the gang that
  worked the swindles knew everything about them that was worth money. This is
  a job for Bill!"</p>

  <p>Two months later came John Mortimer, by a crack White Star liner. The boat
  was delayed by fog, and he arrived on Saturday, after business hours; but
  life was such good fun, and London so horny, that business hours did not
  worry him.</p>

  <p>After the boat had left Cherbourg, there appeared a new face on board.</p>

  <p>John noticed casually, at lunch, a grey-haired man with a dark, saturnine
  face. Later, when he was packing his hand-bag, the stranger appeared.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to bother you, Mr. Mortimer..." he handed the confident young
  passenger a card.</p>

  <p>"Detective-Inspector Lander," read John in the corner of the
  pasteboard.</p>

  <p>"I travel the boat from Cherbourg to England," explained the detective
  apologetically. "I don't know whether you have any valuables
  aboard&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>He gave John Mortimer the impression that he knew very well.</p>

  <p>"Well, in case... we've told Bill to keep an eye on you."</p>

  <p>"Thank you!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mortimer's tone was sardonic. He was of the age when, taking a
  dispassionate view of humanity, he could find none more efficient than
  himself.</p>

  <p>A few hours later he was gloating over London&mdash;the London he had not
  seen these eight years. And the stone balcony of his bedroom at the Admiralty
  Hotel was royally set for gloating. Beneath him was the green of the
  Embankment Gardens, with its little statues and flower-beds and its squat
  bandstand. Beyond, the broad stretch of the Embankment, and beyond that the
  pageantry of the Thames.</p>

  <p>The wintry sunset was all rose and russet, and the river stared up at him
  with the reflection of a paling sky. Two tugs abreast swept down-stream,
  their port flights greening the water; a police launch stole from the shadows
  of moored barges on the farther shore, and swung in a wide circle towards its
  neat pier by Scotland Yard. The street cars were already glittering with
  lights, and against the western light the clock tower of Parliament was
  sharply defined.</p>

  <p>He was conscious that somebody had come into his bedroom. Ordinarily, the
  appearance of a hotel servant would not have disturbed him, but now there
  were excellent reasons why he should not leave any caller unchallenged. It
  had been careless in him that he should have forgotten to turn the key in the
  lock.</p>

  <p>"A young lady to see you, sir." The floor waiter passed him a card.</p>

  <p>"Miss Monica Bradley," he read; and, in the corner:</p>

  <p>"From Mr. Store."</p>

  <p>Of course! He had forgotten the secretary.</p>

  <p>"Ask her up to the sitting-room, please," he said; and noticed that the
  waiter passed through the door to that apartment.</p>

  <p>So the bedroom door was locked after all. He tested it and found it was
  so. Then he tried the wall-safe near the head of the bed. It was hidden
  behind a sliding oak panel. All the big suites at the Admiralty Hotel had
  their private safes. That fact was widely advertised, and had determined the
  hotel for many a traveller in John Mortimer's position. Nine little keyholes
  ran down one edge of the steel door, but only two locks operated, and
  Mortimer had the two keys in his pocket. With every new guest the combination
  was changed by one official at the hotel. It seemed an ingenious idea to John
  Mortimer, who had reason for desiring security.</p>

  <p>He returned to the sitting-room as the girl was shown in. She was a head
  shorter than he, and he was pleasantly shocked to discover that she was
  pretty. Two grave grey eyes met him; when she spoke she had the voice of a
  lady.</p>

  <p>"You're from Mr. Store," he smiled. "Very kind of you, Miss Bradley, to
  come on Saturday afternoon. I thought English people didn't work after one
  o'clock!"</p>

  <p>She smiled faintly at this.</p>

  <p>"This English person works seven days a week," she said, as she put down
  her bag on the table and began to strip her gloves.</p>

  <p>She was very self-possessed&mdash;capable, he imagined. Better-dressed
  than he might have expected.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Store sent you, of course," he nodded. "I had forgotten I had
  wirelessed for a secretary."</p>

  <p>He was bland, very much the man of affairs. She had met his type before,
  but never observed such obvious qualities. Tall, good-looking, immensely
  confident... she liked him.</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch. It was rather late in the afternoon, and he was
  rather chary of starting his business at such an hour. She anticipated his
  question when she said:</p>

  <p>"I was expecting that you would wish me to work late, Mr. Mortimer."</p>

  <p>She opened the little attaché-case she had placed on the table, took out a
  note-book and pencil&mdash;"The typewriter will come up later," she said, and
  looked at him expectantly.</p>

  <p>There was a whole heap of work to do: letters to the Rajah's
  representatives in Paris, cables which he should have sent an hour ago to
  announce his safe arrival. Yet he was rather too full of his own pleasant
  emotions to settle down to work.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Store is our agent," he said. There was a hint of patronage in his
  tone that went well with his youthfulness. "I haven't told Mr. Store what has
  brought me to Europe, but it is rather an important matter."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know you're bringing some emeralds for the Rajah of Rajpoona."</p>

  <p>He stared at her open-mouthed. He was indeed exporting emeralds from New
  York&mdash;a circumstance which might sound queer to Hatton Garden. But John
  Mortimer and his partner had been making this collection for fifteen
  years&mdash;at least, his senior partner had, for he was a member of one of
  the most famous firms of jewellers in New York. Some of the stones had been
  in the possession of old colonial families for a hundred years.</p>

  <p>"How on earth did you know that?" he asked in dismay.</p>

  <p>She smiled again, and she really had a lovely smile.</p>

  <p>"Probably your partner cabled Mr. Store," she said; and then, almost
  carelessly: "I suppose you have put the stones in a safe place? Eight hundred
  thousand dollars' worth of emeralds are rather a responsibility, aren't
  they?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"They are in a <i>very</i> safe place," he said.</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Naturally," said she.</p>

  <p>There was something in her tone that was faintly irritating. Before he
  could properly analyse that particular inflection, she went on: "You're
  expecting to meet the Rajah's agent in London&mdash;Mr. Koenig&mdash;aren't
  you?"</p>

  <p>He was ruffled&mdash;some of his pleasant mystery had been dissipated.</p>

  <p>"I notified his address in London and in Paris," he said shortly, "but I
  guess he must be in Paris, for I haven't heard of him."</p>

  <p>"You will," she said, nibbling at the end of her pencil, her thoughtful
  eyes fixed on his.</p>

  <p>He stared at her.</p>

  <p>"Of course I shall," he said, with a touch of asperity in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Then <i>that's</i> all right."</p>

  <p>Her smile was altogether disarming. She smoothed her note-book flat and
  looked at him inquiringly. But he was not in an immediate mood to work.</p>

  <p>"You rather took my breath away&mdash;but then, London does that," he
  said. "It is like coming back to a strange world. What a law-abiding little
  burg this is! It may make you happy to know that Bill is looking after me! I
  presume Bill is a detective, so if he comes whilst I am out, you might order
  some beer for him&mdash;if he drinks beer."</p>

  <p>"Bills drink nothing else," she said.</p>

  <p>He was graciously amused.</p>

  <p>"I can tell you, I shouldn't have been walking through New York with these
  infernal emeralds except I had a Burns man walking on each side of me and
  another behind," he said. "By the way, do you know whether Store heard from
  Koenig?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I'm pretty sure he hasn't," she said. "He doesn't even know that there is
  such a man."</p>

  <p>Whether it was the exhilaration of finding himself in his native city, or
  from the sheer joy of finding somebody with whom he could talk, and who, he
  knew, shared his secret, or for some reason which he could not understand, he
  babbled on.</p>

  <p>"We did not tell Store. You see, this was rather a big deal, and the fewer
  people who knew about it, the better." And then, suddenly, his face went
  blank again. "But how the dickens did you know about&mdash;the emeralds, I
  mean? Renstein couldn't have been so foolish&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All men are foolish," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>He felt that if he spoke he would only say something extraordinarily
  inane.</p>

  <p>"You didn't bring your own secretary, Mr. Mortimer?"</p>

  <p>"That seems fairly obvious," said John, as coldly as he knew how. "We have
  no women stenographers in our office."</p>

  <p>She was nibbling at the end of her pencil again, staring through the open
  French windows on to the murky skyline.</p>

  <p>"Women are not very efficient, I suppose?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Women talk," said John crushingly. "When they should be working
  they&mdash;er&mdash;are chattering."</p>

  <p>To his surprise, she nodded her agreement. "About men," she said. "That's
  queer, isn't it?&mdash;men only talk about themselves!"</p>

  <p>He might have said something very sharp if he could have thought of
  anything to say. Instead, he compromised by dictating three cables, two of
  which were absolutely unnecessary, and two rather dignified letters which
  contained nothing of what he intended to say. She was an efficient
  stenographer, and was always waiting for the next sentence. He cleared his
  throat.</p>

  <p>"I think that will be all," he said.</p>

  <p>She put down her pencil and looked up at him.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I have annoyed you," she said. "And secretaries who annoy
  principals come to a very sticky end! You see, I am not used&mdash;"
  she stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>"You are not used&mdash;?" he suggested, and his suspicions grew
  when he saw how confused she was.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the typewriter arrived at that moment, and he left her to her
  work.</p>

  <p>She was half-way through when Mr. Koenig called him on the 'phone. The
  telephone was in the sitting-room, and he had perforce to interrupt her in
  her work, and since there was an excuse for her stopping, there was also a
  reason why she should listen.</p>

  <p>"Just arrived, Mr. Koenig. You got my wire? Good!"</p>

  <p>"Coming right along!" said a thick and hearty voice.</p>

  <p>John hung up the receiver as his secretary asked:</p>

  <p>"Do you know Mr. Koenig?"</p>

  <p>It is very difficult for a pretty girl to be wholly impertinent. John
  Mortimer's intelligence told him that that was a question he might well have
  answered more or less offensively. The sentimentalist in him produced a
  fairly coherent reply.</p>

  <p>"No, he has never been to America, and naturally I have not met him," he
  said, a little stiffly.</p>

  <p>He snapped the words, and Miss Bradley was inwardly amused.</p>

  <p>He was the most easy-going of young men, but objected to being laughed at,
  and that this very pretty and capable lady was laughing at him was most
  obvious to John Mortimer. He wished Store had shown a little more
  discrimination. After all, it was all very well to employ a lady in that
  capacity, and John Mortimer was a democrat and all that sort of thing; but he
  was also a man who for seven days had allowed his self-importance to grow in
  proportion to his responsibility, and this chance-found girl had made him
  feel most astonishingly small. He was a little alarmed, too. This was not a
  moment when he required the association of unusual people.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are Mr. Store's confidential secretary?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No; he has never confided anything to me&mdash;not even his love
  affairs," she said, with such calmness that he almost forgot to be shocked by
  this outrageous disclaimer.</p>

  <p>"I thought Mr. Store was an elderly man&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>She had a most exasperating trick of interrupting him.</p>

  <p>"Eighty, and possibly ninety. But even quite ancient men have love
  affairs."</p>

  <p>He went out and slammed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>He was in no pleasant mood to receive the lady whom Monica brightly
  announced by tapping on the door.</p>

  <p>"A lady?" He frowned. "Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Koenig."</p>

  <p>John Mortimer was a little staggered. He had not endowed the Rajah's agent
  with a family, certainly not with as attractive a family as the slim, rather
  pale, sad-eyed girl who greeted him when he came out.</p>

  <p>"My father is not here yet?" She spoke with a slightly foreign accent. "He
  told me he would be here, that I must call at six."</p>

  <p>She looked at the jewelled watch on her wrist, and was apparently
  embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Mortimer noticed that she glanced from time to time at his temporary
  secretary. Miss Monica Bradley was annoyingly interested in the personality
  of the visitor, and it appeared that the interest was mutual.</p>

  <p>"This is my&mdash;um&mdash;secretary," introduced John awkwardly.</p>

  <p>Miss Koenig inclined her head slightly, and took a swift look at the girl
  sitting with folded hands before her typewriter, and in that swift glance
  Mortimer could have sworn he saw a half-recognition.</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" said Miss Koenig politely. And then:</p>

  <p>"Have I not seen you at some time? Did you not call at my
  house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Monica shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Somewhere... a house we had in the country. I was at the window when you
  came; my brother saw you."</p>

  <p>Monica shook her head again.</p>

  <p>"You're mistaken," she said coolly, and John Mortimer knew that she was
  lying.</p>

  <p>He saw the visitor give the typist a long and searching scrutiny, saw the
  suspicion that lived and died in her eyes, and the slight shrug of her
  shapely shoulders; and then, before John could speak, there came a rap at the
  door, a bell-boy entered, followed by the bluff and hearty Mr. Koenig.</p>

  <p>He was a little man, rather stout and bald. Two humorous blue eyes shone
  behind the thick lenses of his horn-rimmed spectacles.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my frient Mr. Mortimer!" he boomed, gripped John heartily by the
  hand, and then grinned round at his daughter. "Dis is de good fellow, eh? He
  comes to rob your poor farder! Worse dan de fellows who steal the money from
  the poor silly peoples who travel on ships."</p>

  <p>He drew up a chair with a thump, sat down on it, drew out a big pocket-
  case which he slammed on the table. It was, John saw, packed tight with
  notes.</p>

  <p>"The Rajah comes to-night by 'plane from Paris," he explained. He spoke
  rapidly. "You understant? I must place my business before he comes or I make
  no profit. The sum is a hundred and seventy-t'ree t'ousand, which I
  pay&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And then his eyes fell upon the girl typist watching him curiously, and
  John saw his brows meet.</p>

  <p>"Why, young lady! I think I have met you, eh?"</p>

  <p>"So your aunt was saying," said Monica genially.</p>

  <p>"My aunt&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Your daughter; I'm sorry." She was very apologetic.</p>

  <p>"Did you not call at my house once for... petrol?" He was going to say
  something else, but checked himself.</p>

  <p>"Miss Bradley is from Mr. Store, our London agent." Koenig's face
  cleared.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes, Store." And then, quickly: "Is he here?"</p>

  <p>"He left for Australia last night," said the girl gravely, and Koenig's
  jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"Australia?" incredulously. "My tear young lady&mdash;" And then he
  laughed. "You confuse me and make me feel a fool!" he chuckled. He took a
  gold cigarette-case from his pocket. "Indeed you are a remarkable young
  lady."</p>

  <p>He pushed the case towards John, who took a cigarette, and then to the
  girl, who shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I never smoke in business hours. Poor Senator Grannit had one of your
  cigarettes, and what happened to him? Don't light that, Mr. Mortimer," she
  said sharply, as John was in the act of striking a match.</p>

  <p>Koenig glared at her for a second, and then, turning, ran to the door and
  flung it open. The two Scotland Yard men who were waiting found him rather a
  difficult handful, but "Miss Koenig" went quietly in the hands of Monica
  Bradley.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Yes, I am Bill," said Monica demurely, when she interviewed
  her employer that night. "I suppose you'd call me a detective, but really I
  only work out odd problems. The oddest problem of all was to discover how
  this little crowd cleaned up so easily. It was really very simple. They have
  a very powerful wireless set at a house in Sunningdale, and the young lady
  tuned in to the homeward-bound American liner, and took down the private
  messages that were coming through to London. Sometimes she heard, and wrote
  hundreds without getting any profitable information, but occasionally she and
  her husband learned little secrets which indiscreet people had confided to
  the wireless. It is a very simple matter to pick up any liner: did you know
  that? Once you have their code number, the rest is fairly simple. They got to
  know Grannit was bringing money; they knew Loam was expecting a man to call
  for a cheque; and that a rather wealthy and foolish old lady had wirelessed
  to a big jeweller saying that she wanted her diamonds reset. It was as easy
  as eating pie to intercept the real message, and, in your case, a simpler
  matter to get the genuine agent out of the way. For example, Mr. Store is now
  in Paris with the real Mr. Koenig, awaiting your arrival. We located a big
  receiving-set at Sunningdale&mdash;at least, I did&mdash;and we arranged to
  get duplicates of all the messages that were coming through to the Radio
  Company. Naturally, we had to guess who was to be the victim, but that wasn't
  so difficult as you'd think. We didn't know exactly how we were going to deal
  with your case, but after you wirelessed for a secretary, it was easy."</p>

  <p>Mr. John Mortimer had recovered from his natural annoyance.</p>

  <p>"And you are the Bill that is supposed to be 'looking after' me?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Continue!" he said. "I want you to escort me to the hotel safe, where
  I'll deposit those infernal stones, and then you can escort me to a place
  where we can get supper and a dance."</p>

  <p>Bill did not demur. Officially she was still on duty.</p>

     name="story7"></a>7. &mdash; THE PRAYING GIRL</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Weekly Tale Teller</i>, October 16, 1915</h3>

  <p class="first">THE girl drove to the <i>Bahnhof</i> holding her husband's
  hand in hers. Now and again she shot a shy glance into the bronzed face, and
  his blue eyes lost a little of their hardness as they met hers.</p>

  <p>The straight way was through the Kaiserstrasse, but she would have the
  fiacre turn into the Münsterstrasse that they might pass the Minster.</p>

  <p>"I shall go here every day and pray for you," she whispered, and he
  pressed her hand.</p>

  <p>"Every night... I shall pray for you," she said, as she stood on the
  platform by the carriage window. He looked almost god-like in the
  tight-fitting grey of his German air-service uniform.</p>

  <p>"You will not take risks... the English are very kind to Saxon
  prisoners."</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you little traitress!" he rallied her. "You want me to desert and go
  over to the English!"</p>

  <p>"If you were safe&mdash;I would not care," she said, and stood twisting
  her little handkerchief into a ball as the train drew slowly from the
  station, its windows crowded with cheering men, the glass roof re-echoing to
  a roar of "Hochs!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Burleigh's Six nose-dived from a height of 2000 metres,
  flattened at the exact moment, and came skimming along the ground of the
  aerodrome, pulling up within a few yards of the Flying Commander.</p>

  <p>Grey walked slowly over to the machine as Burleigh heaved himself to the
  ground, stretching his cramped limbs with a painful little smile.</p>

  <p>"What happened to you?" asked Grey curiously.</p>

  <p>"Nothing much," replied Burleigh, and gave his machine a critical scrutiny
  before he turned again to his chief.</p>

  <p>"You didn't get your Taube, did you?"</p>

  <p>The other shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you climb up?" suggested the Flight-Commander.</p>

  <p>Burleigh nodded.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you reach him?"</p>

  <p>Burleigh nodded again, and looked at his superior very earnestly and very
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"What the devil's the matter with you, Burleigh?" asked Major Grey
  irritably. "You aren't usually so reticent."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed the other at once, and there was a long pause. Then he
  checked an exasperated comment which was trembling on the lips of the Flight-
  Commander with, "Do you believe&mdash;er&mdash;in&mdash;prayer?"</p>

  <p>A new look of interest came to the Commander's face.</p>

  <p>"That depends," he said cautiously, "on who does the praying."</p>

  <p>Burleigh nodded, as he stripped the leathern helmet from his head, and
  slowly ungloved. "That's exactly my opinion," he said.</p>

  <p>With a little nod he made his way across to his hut.</p>

  <p>Grey watched him with an anxious tenderness. He turned to the mechanics
  who were handling Burleigh's Six&mdash;it was called Burleigh's Six to
  distinguish it from the five machines which Burleigh had previously flown,
  all of which were either under repair, or were frankly scrap-iron, for
  Burleigh was the most daring member of this section of the Royal Flying
  Corps, and had come some unholy purlers&mdash;and then, with his hands thrust
  deep into his breeches pockets and his chin on his breast, Flight-Commander
  Grey made his way to the Orderly-room.</p>

  <p>The hard-faced Colonel, who commanded the wing, was sitting at his table
  busily signing indents when his subordinate entered.</p>

  <p>"Burleigh back?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Yes, sir," replied the other.</p>

  <p>"Did he get a Bosche?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," and then, "I'd like to speak to you about Burleigh, sir."</p>

  <p>The Colonel took off his pince-nez.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>The supply of flying-men was barely adequate. The supply of reliable men
  as opposed to mere machine smashers was very small. Burleigh was the most
  daring man in the wing. He had the Instinct, which was half the battle so far
  as airmanship was concerned. Sooner or later there comes a time when every
  airman must break. The Colonel had hoped that Burleigh's time was far
  distant.</p>

  <p>When Grey, glum of face, came to the Orderly-room and "wanted to talk
  about" members of the Corps, it meant only one thing.</p>

  <p>"Nerves gone, I suppose," growled the Colonel. "Well, he's stuck it longer
  than most of 'em&mdash;you can't expect fellows to fly over guns everlasting.
  What are the symptoms?"</p>

  <p>Grey stared through the little window with a frown on his face.</p>

  <p>"Rather curious," he said, "he asked me if I believed in prayer. Of
  course, one sometimes... Lord, sir, I've prayed like anything! I had a tail
  slip over Douai&mdash;I stalled too steep and she let back... but I didn't
  talk about praying."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said the Colonel, and rising from his table walked to the window
  that overlooked the officers' huts. "That's bad, and yet... have you ever
  noticed that air-nervès never develop into religious melancholia? It breaks a
  fellow up until he is only a dithering wreck, but religion... no! Send for
  Burleigh."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later Burleigh came, a lean, brown-faced man, with a pair of
  humorous blue eyes. He saluted his chief and waited.</p>

  <p>"Um... Burleigh," began the Colonel, "I think you had better have a rest,
  my boy... too much 'archie,' eh?"</p>

  <p>For answer, Captain Burleigh stretched out a sinewy hand and held it
  unwavering at right angles to his body.</p>

  <p>To the wonder of the Colonel it did not tremble or shake. It was, in fact,
  as steady as the arm of a railway signal.</p>

  <p>"Nothing much wrong with that, sir," he said. The Colonel rubbed his
  chin.</p>

  <p>"What is this talk of praying?" he asked abruptly. Burleigh indulged in
  that soft laugh of his.</p>

  <p>"I understand now, sir," he turned his smiling eyes on Grey. "I asked you
  if you believed in prayer&mdash;I do."</p>

  <p>There was an awkward pause. Certain things men do not discuss in public.
  Religion and the public avowal of faith is not out of place in a Colonel or
  even in a Major of some seniority. From men below that status it is demanded
  that there shall be a reticence, and the junior officer is expected to say
  his prayers privily. If he did not say his prayers and openly boasted of his
  heathenism, he would be regarded askance, for an officer should be a
  gentleman, and a gentleman has, as an indispensable part of his equipment, a
  wholesome belief in the existence and mercy of God.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you why I say this," Burleigh went on. "You sent me out this
  morning to hunt the red Taube?"</p>

  <p>Grey and the Colonel nodded together.</p>

  <p>"Very good&mdash;I hunted him. I went twenty miles inland to a place well
  behind Roulers, and I spotted him outside the hangars outside Roulers. You
  can't mistake 'Reddy,' and there he was. I was dodging in and out of the
  clouds, but they saw me, and opened up with 'archies'&mdash;bracketed fire. I
  was flying the little Morane and they misjudged the distance&mdash;all the
  shells burst short, and presently I dived into a nice fat cloud and went for
  a little joy- ride till the trouble blew over."</p>

  <p>"I got into the black of it, and I couldn't see the tip of my nose, and if
  it hadn't been for the stabilizer I shouldn't have known whether I was
  upside-down or sideslipping to glory. I started climbing, for I pretty well
  knew the depth of the cloud, and presently I got into the sun. I messed about
  for ten minutes, circling round in the hope of something turning up, and then
  I decided to come back."</p>

  <p>"There wasn't any sign of the earth immediately underneath, but I could
  see our lines, and I started streaking for home. I'd hardly got going when
  suddenly from right under me came Reddy!"</p>

  <p>"He was barging up out of the mist before I realised what was happening,
  but I brought the Morane round on a hairpin-turn, got above him, and slipped
  a bomb. It couldn't have missed him by more than a yard. He was quick to see
  what was wrong, and up went his tail and down he dived into the cloud, with
  me after him. He flattened out and swerved, and I just shot past him&mdash;so
  close that I could see the Bosche as plainly as I see you, sir."</p>

  <p>He paused again and laughed quietly.</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"Then I chased him. Round and round we went in that damnable mist, and I
  can assure you, sir, I knew that I had him. He had either to nose-dive to
  earth or take what was coming. And he knew it&mdash;but he was dead game. He
  turned to the left and shot sideways, and his bullet just missed me."</p>

  <p>"I turned the Lewis-gun on to him, and I felt that certainty which comes
  to a man just when he is dead sure he has got his bird before he fires his
  shot. My hand was on the trigger and I'd got him covered so that I couldn't
  miss him... straight in the centre of his back."</p>

  <p>Burleigh stopped once more, but this time his laugh held amusement and
  wonder.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" asked the Colonel.</p>

  <p>"We were in the cloud&mdash;not the thickest part but the grey edge of
  it&mdash;and as my finger closed on the trigger the mist between him and me
  took shape&mdash;the shape of a woman&mdash;a young girl&mdash;and she was
  praying.... I saw it as plainly as&mdash;as&mdash;I see Grey. She was
  kneeling, and she was in her nightdress... .rather a pretty girl with long
  hair...."</p>

  <p>There was a deep silence broken by the Colonel.</p>

  <p>"And so you...."</p>

  <p>"I didn't shoot, sir," said Burleigh simply, "that is the reason I came
  back&mdash;he dived out of sight and I didn't follow. You may call it
  nerves," he went on in his deliberate way, "but I never felt better in my
  life."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said the Colonel again, and shot a significant glance at Grey.</p>

  <p>Burleigh interpreted the glance, and his eyes danced.
  "Well&mdash;um&mdash;Burleigh"&mdash;the Commander was obviously ill at
  ease&mdash;"I think, anyway, you're entitled to a rest&mdash;I've thought so
  for quite a time. A few weeks at Brooklands will pull&mdash;I mean
  will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He tailed off lamely, for even a hard-faced Colonel, devoid of tact, and
  conscious of the deficiency, finds it difficult to tell a man to his face
  that he has betrayed all the symptoms of incipient mania.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir," said Burleigh suddenly, as a thought occurred to him,
  "who is the man flying Reddy?"</p>

  <p>The Colonel opened a drawer of his desk and took out a locked book, which
  he opened.</p>

  <p>"It is curious that you should ask me that&mdash;I have had a batch of
  information about these fellows this morning from Intelligence G.H.Q., and
  Reddy's man was amongst it."</p>

  <p>He turned the leaves of the book, fixed his pince-nez, and came to the
  page he sought.</p>

  <p>"Here we are! "he said, and read aloud:</p>

  <p>"No. 872, Taube ('Reddy'), Pilot Lieutenant Gustav von Sedlitz- Telymaun.
  Age 25. Native of Saxony. Married since the war, Maria Fedora Klesser at the
  Minster Freiburg. Wife lives in that town at Essenbahn Strasse 971.</p>

  <p>"There's detail there that would be creditable to the German
  Intelligence!" said the Colonel triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"Married since the war?" mused Burleigh&mdash;"certainly she looked
  young," stood for a moment, saluted, and turned on his heel.</p>

  <p>They waited until he was out of earshot before the two men spoke.</p>

  <p>"A few days' rest here might put him right," said Grey, and the Colonel
  agreed readily enough, for Burleigh was too excellent a man to spare, and the
  reconnaissance work was very heavy.</p>

  <p>Grey went to the mess-room for lunch, and found, to his relief, that
  Burleigh was not there. He beckoned a youth, who, at the moment Grey arrived,
  was demonstrating the impossibility of capsizing with the aid of a paper
  aeroplane, and the young man came to the door with the half-reproachful,
  half- embarrassed air of one who expected a carpeting.</p>

  <p>"Bascombe, I want you to go out and look for Reddy," said Grey; "go by
  yourself and take Boyd's Morane. You've got to find Reddy and bring him
  down."</p>

  <p>He related briefly Burleigh's experience.</p>

  <p>"A little nerve-strain&mdash;you needn't mention the matter to anybody.
  See what you can do."</p>

  <p>Bascombe's face was serious. "He seemed all right&mdash;Burleigh, I mean,"
  he said; "he was in here only a few minutes ago."</p>

  <p>"He's gone, I tell you," said Grey; "we shall not be able to send him up
  for weeks yet&mdash;go along and see what you can do."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later Bascombe's Morane was sweeping upward in great circles
  above the aerodrome, six deadly little bombs on a tray beneath the frame, the
  Lewis-gun well ready for any emergency which might arise.</p>

  <p>The Morane disappeared in the sky, moving eastward rapidly, and two hours
  passed before it was again signalled returning to the lines. Bascombe brought
  his machine to the ground in a gentle volplane, and the Flight- Commander ran
  across the ground to meet him.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked eagerly. Bascombe was peering down at him from the pilot
  seat.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Grey again, "did you see Reddy?"</p>

  <p>Bascombe nodded.</p>

  <p>"Did you get him?"</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" asked Grey.</p>

  <p>Bascombe got to the ground before he replied.</p>

  <p>"I saw the praying lady," he said simply, and Grey gasped.</p>

  <p>"You saw&mdash;" he began incredulously.</p>

  <p>"The praying lady," said Bascombe calmly.</p>

  <p>He told the story in half a dozen sentences, and it was almost word for
  word the story which Burleigh had already told.</p>

  <p>"And if you think I'm mad, sir," said Bascombe, "you're entitled to your
  opinions. In point of fact, I'm as sane as any man in France. I saw a woman
  quite clearly. She appeared just as I had got the line on Reddy and at the
  moment when I was already making up a suitable reply to your congratulations.
  There she was, on her knees, her hands clasped over her breast, and her head
  raised upwards... it was uncanny. I had a horrible fear, too, that if I shot
  I should come down myself. Anyway, before I could recover, Reddy was
  gone."</p>

  <p>At the mess that night, Reddy and the praying lady formed the main topic
  of conversation. "The only thing to do," said Gibson, the youngest of the
  flyers, "is to send a wire through Holland to Mrs. Reddy, something like
  this:</p>

  <p>"The Members of the Royal Flying Corps present their compliments to Mrs.
  Reddy, and request that she will be good enough to stop praying for her
  husband."</p>

  <p>"Of course, the whole thing is an illusion," said Boyd, who was in charge
  of the archies; "poor old Burleigh got a little ragged, and Bascombe, who has
  been flying over guns for the last three months, was influenced by what Grey
  told him. It's preposterous. These things don't happen in the twentieth
  century, and anyway, it is positively indecent that a Bosche should have a
  guardian angel."</p>

  <p>A week passed, and the grim business of war went on unchecked. There was a
  counter-attack north of Arras, and a concentration of German troops behind
  Ypres, two new Zeppelins had come to Flanders and must be watched. All
  together the Flying Corps had its time fully occupied. The Reddy mystery had
  disappeared from mess discussion even as the Reddy disappeared from the sky.
  It was reported that she was having a new tractor fixed. With Reddy's absence
  there was a diminution of interest, until one day Burleigh, engaged in the
  hack- work of their craft&mdash;he was spotting the effect of howitzer
  fire&mdash;was attacked in mid-air by a Taube and an Albatross. The Albatross
  he brought down with a lucky shot, which pierced her petrol tank, and then,
  by dint of manoeuvering, he placed himself between the Taube and the German
  line. The Taube manoeuvred desperately, climbing and dipping, in an endeavour
  to get directly ahead of the British and to "take his air." But all the time
  he was being pushed farther and farther into the British line. He was in such
  a position now that he dared not dive for fear of the British guns, he could
  not climb without losing the lead he had.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Burleigh, "I think I've got you, my lad."</p>

  <p>He left the aeroplane to take care of itself, and glanced along the sights
  of the Lewis, his finger was increasing its pressure upon the trigger and the
  man in the Taube was as good as dead. The day was clear, there was not a
  cloud in the sky, and the view Burleigh obtained of his quarry was perfect.
  Yet something stayed the pressure. It seemed as though a power greater than
  he arrested his actions, momentarily paralysing his nerve centres. Between
  him and the Taube floated a grey diaphanous mist of no greater substance than
  the drifting smoke of a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Huh!" growled Burleigh, and throwing over the control-lever dropped like
  a stone for a thousand metres. He flattened at the exact moment and came
  swiftly to earth behind the British lines.</p>

  <p>An officer ran from his shelter.</p>

  <p>"Hit?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not materially," said Burleigh.</p>

  <p>He glanced up at the sky. The Taube was shrieking back to the German
  lines, and Burleigh shook his fist to the south-east "Stop praying, confound
  you!" he snarled, and then burst out in an uncontrollable fit of
  laughter.</p>

  <h2><a id="story8"
     name="story8"></a>8. &mdash; THE CUSTODY OF THE CHILD</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Penny Illustrated Paper</i>, December 7,
  1929</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE were times when Mrs. Harvey, despite her fifty-seven
  years, was as gay of heart and as amusingly epigrammatic as she had been in
  those far-off days when her movements had appeared with unfailing regularity
  in the society columns of the daily newspapers.</p>

  <p>Women (and men too, for the matter of that) who have centred brilliant
  circles and have heard their well-turned comments repeated from tongue to
  tongue, fight hard against the brain-sloth which the years bring, and either
  hold fast to their old quips and so become boring, or find excuses for their
  dullness and acquire the reputation of being hypochondriac.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Harvey called art to her aid, with disastrous consequences to her
  moral qualities.</p>

  <p>Jack Mayne, her one son, and the child of her first marriage, worshipped
  his mother, and would sit at the dinner-table and gurgle with delight and
  pride at her humour and good spirit. There were other times, and this his
  young wife observed more keenly than he, when Mrs. Harvey would go through
  the days heavy-eyed and irritable, jumping at the slightest noise and
  strangely sensitive to the lightest touch.</p>

  <p>Gwen Mayne was not a worshipper of her mother-in-law, though she got on
  well enough with her, and at times shared her confidences. It is true that
  she was never sufficiently intimate to be admitted to Mrs. Harvey's locked
  boudoir, but then, neither Jack nor any of the servants were allowed to
  inspect "Bluebeard's room."</p>

  <p>Had some inquisitive member of the household opened that locked door in
  time, Gwen Mayne would have been spared one month of hell and eleven months
  of despair, and the powder of grey in Jack Mayne's hair would probably have
  made a later appearance. The circumstances leading to the opening of the door
  may be briefly stated.</p>

  <p>It was three days before the New Year, and Gwen was sitting in the nursery
  superintending the toilet of Marie Marion. Her life had been a happy one, and
  this tiny atom of humanity which had come to the young people had done much
  to compensate for the wisps&mdash;they were hardly clouds&mdash;upon her
  bright horizon.</p>

  <p>She lifted her pretty face to Jack as he came into the nursery.</p>

  <p>"Mother is planning a day's shopping, dear," he said; "I wish you would go
  along with her. She is quite her cheerful self to-day."</p>

  <p>The girl nodded without enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"I wish you were keener on dear mumsie, Gwen," he said, a little
  irritably.</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly; I'm awfully fond of her. You can't expect me to feel
  quite as you do, you who know her so well."</p>

  <p>He waited a little while as though there was something else he had to say,
  then as he was leaving he asked carelessly :</p>

  <p>"Did you have any letters this morning?"</p>

  <p>She shot a suspicious glance at him.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said.</p>

  <p>She had expected this question and had dreaded it.</p>

  <p>"And how is the doctor?" he asked, and this time his carelessness was
  obviously assumed.</p>

  <p>She rose from her chair and took gentle hold of his hands.</p>

  <p>"Jack," she asked, "you don't really object to my knowing Dr. Brinton? Why
  do you worry about other men? Jealousy doesn't belong to your nature."</p>

  <p>He made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"I don't like these sudden friendships, Gwen, and that is the truth.
  Brinton is a very amiable, good-looking fellow with a record of
  adventure&mdash;an irresponsible bachelor&mdash;the sort of man that might
  fascinate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She looked him straight in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"Fascinate me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He avoided her glance.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," he said uncomfortably. "it seems absurd to you, Gwen,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He saw the pain in her eyes, and stopped.</p>

  <p>"I won't let him see me any more, Jack," she said quietly. "I could have
  told you something about Dr. Brinton which would have&mdash;but what is the
  use?"</p>

  <p>She turned abruptly from him, and after waiting a moment he left the
  room.</p>

  <p>She watched him pass down the carriage-drive out of sight, and then, with
  a shrug of her shoulders, she went into her room and dressed.</p>

  <p>Jack Mayne did not see his wife again for a year and a day. Again it was
  the eve of the New Year, and such a going out of the Old had not been
  experienced for twenty years. A north-easterly blizzard swept through the
  city streets, and the countryside lay buried in snow so deep that the very
  landmarks were obliterated and the high roads were but shallow depressions in
  a white waste.</p>

  <p>A woman descended from the train at the little station which served the
  residential quarter where Jack Mayne had his house, and declining the
  services of the one heroic cabman who had braved the weather, she plunged
  through the snow toward the familiar broad avenue which she had once known so
  well.</p>

  <p>The blizzard enveloped and blinded her, but she struggled on, sometimes
  knee-deep, slipping and stumbling forward, stopping now and again to take
  breath, and to set down the parcel she carried.</p>

  <p>In her slow progress she stopped occasionally and flashed an electric lamp
  upon a gate-post rubbing off the snow that she might discern the number, and
  at last paused before the entrance of Jack Mayne's home.</p>

  <p>She seemed to be summoning resolution, and presently she turned into the
  drive and walked cautiously toward the house.</p>

  <p>In the comfortable dining-room a glum dinner-party was in progress. Jack
  Mayne sat on the right of his mother, and opposite him, his friend and one
  time school-fellow, George Gresham. This was one of Mrs. Harvey's dull days,
  and she took no part in the conversation, but sat with downcast eyes, lost,
  apparently, in her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"It is good of you to come down, George," said Jack for the tenth
  time.</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" protested the other. "I am quite alone in London, and you have
  no idea how joyous it is to get back to a cold winter. You must not forget
  that until last December I have been spending my Christmases under a punkah
  sipping iced lemonade. Police-work in India and the colonies isn't all it is
  cracked up to be, Jack."</p>

  <p>He looked again at the heavy-lidded Mrs. Harvey, and Jack smiled.</p>

  <p>"You still think you have met my mother before?"</p>

  <p>The other laughed.</p>

  <p>"No, my memory plays queer tricks&mdash;it is one of those puzzling
  recollections of people due to the irregular action of the brain rather than
  memory."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you met her in the old days?"</p>

  <p>"I think it is unlikely," the other shook his head. "When I knew you years
  ago, your mother was not living with you. Since I came back to England to
  take up my duties at Scotland Yard, I certainly have not visited your
  house."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think it is possible. I have been no-where I could have met
  Mrs. Harvey&mdash;in fact, I wasn't able to look up my old friends until this
  summer."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence, which Jack Mayne broke.</p>

  <p>"By the way, when you were in South Africa, did you ever meet"&mdash;he
  hesitated&mdash;"Brinton?"</p>

  <p>George Gresham nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said quietly; "I knew him rather well. He was in the prison
  service in Johannesburg, and I was brought into contact with him whilst I was
  reorganising their finger-print system."</p>

  <p>Again silence.</p>

  <p>"Did he strike you as being that kind of man?" asked Mayne, fiddling with
  his wine-glass.</p>

  <p>"To be perfectly honest, he did not," replied the other frankly. "I always
  regarded him as a white citizen, and I confess that I liked him!"</p>

  <p>"Did you ever meet my wife&mdash;my late wife?" corrected Jack Mayne.</p>

  <p>Gresham shook his head, and for the first time during the meal the old
  woman spoke.</p>

  <p>"Jack," she said in a strangely strained voice, "why do you talk about
  this?"</p>

  <p>Her son smiled.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter now?" he asked, with a lift of his shoulders; "it is
  all over, and the smart of it is beginning to wear off. You don't mind if I
  talk about this, do you, George?"</p>

  <p>The Police Commissioner shook his head.</p>

  <p>"But for the Lord's sake don't discuss it if it pains you at all," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," replied Mayne. "I suppose you know the circumstances?"</p>

  <p>"No, I know practically nothing about it, except that you are divorced,"
  George answered.</p>

  <p>"Curiously enough it happened twelve months ago yesterday," mused Mayne,
  leaning back in his chair. "I had had a few words with her in the morning
  about this fellow, Brinton, who I thought was corresponding a little too
  frequently&mdash;you know she met him at a tennis-party; he is a crack
  player."</p>

  <p>George nodded.</p>

  <p>"There was nothing particularly bitter in our little encounter," Mayne
  went on, "and I thought no more of it. She went out that morning with my
  mother on a shopping expedition, and in the midst of it all she made some
  excuse and left mother. Mother came back very upset; something bad happened,
  or my wife had said something&mdash;what it was I do not know, and I have
  never pressed mother to tell me. At any rate my wife did not return home that
  night, and I had no message from her for three weeks. Then I received this
  letter."</p>

  <p>The old woman was looking at him with pleading eyes, but he did not see
  her. He took from his pocket a note-case and extracted a sheet of paper,
  which he threw across the table to the other. George looked at the letter,
  which was evidently written on the fly-leaf of a book:</p>
  <br>

  <p class="letter">
  "<span class="smcap">Dear Jack</span>,&mdash; I have gone away with a friend.
  I hope you won't think badly of me, but I cannot explain."</p>
  <br>

  <p>"Where was this posted?" asked George, passing the letter back over the
  table.</p>

  <p>"It was posted at Trenton, a little town twenty miles from here, and this
  is the damming thing,"&mdash;he emphasised his words&mdash;"it was enclosed
  in an envelope bearing the crest of one of the hotels in the place, and the
  envelope was addressed to me in Brinton's handwriting!"</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely certain. A handwriting expert was able to establish this and
  to leave no doubt about the matter. When detectives were put upon the track,
  it was established that a Mr. and Mrs. Brinton had stayed in the hotel a few
  days&mdash;and Brinton is a single man. The shock nearly killed me. I filed a
  petition for divorce and, by a curious coincidence, when the process-server
  called at the hotel in Trenton&mdash;that being the only address I
  knew&mdash;he found my wife there."</p>

  <p>"How long after you made your discovery did you file your petition?"</p>

  <p>"Immediately. Do you think I would wait a moment?" He struck the table
  with his clenched fist and his eyes blazed with anger. "No, no; if she wanted
  to be rid of me I gave her the earliest opportunity. The petition was filed,
  the case was undefended, and the divorce was granted last October."</p>

  <p>The old woman at the head of the table sat with lowered head, weeping
  silently, and Jack jumped up with an exclamation of regret, and went to
  her.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry, mother; I am a brute."</p>

  <p>She rose from the table shaking her head, "I'll go to my room," she said,
  and he walked with her to the door, his arm about her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I never thought mother would take it so badly," he said, coming back to
  the table and pushing the cigarettes up to his companion. "She and Gwen were
  not the best of friends, and yet ever since this thing happened, mother has
  been a wreck."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I ought to go?" asked the other.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," replied Jack; "she gets like that at times. I suppose she's
  gone up to her Bluebeard room."</p>

  <p>"Her Bluebeard room?" repeated the other, and Jack laughed.</p>

  <p>"That was the name Gw&mdash;, my wife gave to mother's sitting-room.
  Mother never allows us through the door. I suspect some tender romance of her
  youth." Then, "Well, what do you think of the case?" he asked, carrying the
  conversation back to its original groove.</p>

  <p>"Didn't Brinton put in any kind of defence?"</p>

  <p>Jack shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He went back to Africa a week before the papers were served."</p>

  <p>"Didn't he communicate?"</p>

  <p>Jack hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he sent me a letter, rather a lengthy epistle judging by the size of
  it."</p>

  <p>Gresham looked at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you read it?"</p>

  <p>"No," admitted his host; "I was so enraged that, like a fool, I chucked it
  into the fire. My lawyers were very sore about this, because the letter
  undoubtedly would have supplied the proof and saved them a lot of bother when
  the case came on."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he stopped, and bent his head, listening.</p>

  <p>"Is that mother coming down again?" he said wonderingly, walked to the
  door and opened it.</p>

  <p>The darkness of the passage was illuminated by one small electric lamp,
  and by its light he saw that the stairs were empty.</p>

  <p>"I thought I heard somebody walking about in the room overhead," said
  Gresham; "my hearing is rather sensitive."</p>

  <p>"Overhead!" repeated Mayne in astonishment, "why, that is the nursery.
  Nurse is away, and unless it was mother, I don't know who would go in to her.
  Wait a moment."</p>

  <p>He ran up the stairs and entered the big nursery at the front of the
  house, and the room was empty save for the white cot against the wall. After
  a look round, with such assistance as the burning night-light afforded, he
  was leaving, when something by the child's bed attracted his attention. He
  tiptoed across and, with a smile, took up a big doll.</p>

  <p>"Here is the intruder," he said, as he came back to his guest; "probably
  mother has been leaving Marie Marion her New Year present. Hullo! Here's the
  label!"</p>

  <p>He lifted a tag that was tied to one of the doll's ankles, and George
  Gresham saw his face turn white.</p>

  <p>"'From mother,'" he read mechanically, "'to her little daughter."</p>

  <p>He stared across to Gresham.</p>

  <p>"It did not come by post," he said; "she wouldn't dare&mdash;she wouldn't
  dare...!"</p>

  <p>The door opened slowly and Gwen walked in. She was still wearing her heavy
  coat, which glistened with moisture, and the sodden and shapeless hat
  testified to the violence of the storm which was raging without. Her face was
  whiter than her husband's and her lips were tremulous.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p>George Gresham was standing by the table staring at the girl.</p>

  <p>"I want my child," she said, with a sob in her voice, "my child that I
  brought into this world and suffered for."</p>

  <p>Jack made a helpless gesture.</p>

  <p>"You know you cannot have her, Gwen," he said gently, "the court has given
  me its custody."</p>

  <p>She did not meet his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I want my child," she said doggedly, "though I break your heart to get
  her. I can't go on any longer&mdash;I can't, I can't!"</p>

  <p>There was a distant ring of a bell, and outside came the soft footfall of
  a servant. Jack turned his head to the door with a puzzled frown. He did not
  expect visitors, and they were most unwelcome at this hour of crisis. There
  was a murmur of voices in the hall and a tap at the door.</p>

  <p>"I can see nobody, Jane," said Jack. "Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"Dr. Brinton."</p>

  <p>Mayne took a step back and his breath came quickly.</p>

  <p>"Show him in," he said, and turned his steely eyes upon his wife.</p>

  <p>it needed all his self-possession, all his courage to hold her so aloof
  when his very heart was aching for her. As for Gwen, she had given a little
  start of surprise at the name, and had turned slowly to meet the
  newcomer.</p>

  <p>The man who came in shaking the snow from his coat was tall, slim, and
  good-looking. Him Jack Mayne expected, but not the pretty girl who followed.
  It was Brinton's attitude which took his breath away. The doctor was
  friendly, and without hesitation offered his hand to Mayne. So astounded was
  Jack Mayne that he took the hand mechanically.</p>

  <p>"You don't mind my calling," said the visitor. "I've been terribly anxious
  to discover how that matter went, and although I only landed at Southampton
  yesterday I came straight along to see you all."</p>

  <p>"How that matter went?" repeated Mayne huskily. "Well, it is no news to
  you to learn that my wife was divorced!"</p>

  <p>"Divorced! Good God, what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Brinton stared at the other.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why you should be surprised," said Mayne coldly. "You took
  my wife away from me, you were with her in a Trenton hotel, from whence you
  wrote your letter, and we have traced the fact that you stayed there with a
  'Mrs. Brinton' on three dates in January of last year."</p>

  <p>Brinton took a long breath.</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," he said softly; "well, I'm going to astonish <i>you</i>, my
  friend!"</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>It was Gwen who spoke.</p>

  <p>"I forbid your speaking!"</p>

  <p>"It is too late to forbid my speaking. I have already told your secret by
  letter to this lunatic, and that doesn't seem to have convinced him. You had
  my letter?"</p>

  <p>"I burnt it," said Jack Mayne.</p>

  <p>Dr. Brinton sank back into a chair and looked at the other with something
  which was half-anger and half-amusement in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well, I am going to tell it to you again," he said. "It is true I stayed
  at the Royal Hotel, Trenton, with a lady who called herself, with excellent
  reason, Mrs. Brinton. This is the lady," he pointed to the girl who had come
  in with him.</p>

  <p>"You were married?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was married in January, the very day I sent your wife's letter to
  you."</p>

  <p>"How came my wife to give you a letter?"</p>

  <p>"Please, please, doctor!" Gwen Mayne had come to Brinton's side. "Don't
  tell! I was a fool to come. Only I want to say this, Jack&mdash;Dr. Brinton
  was a good friend of mine and yours&mdash;and no more."</p>

  <p>"I am going to tell," said the doctor quietly. "I think there has been
  enough tragedy in this business&mdash;and as my name seems to have been mixed
  up in the case I cannot be silent to save your husband's feelings."</p>

  <p>"I met Mrs. Mayne in prison," he turned to Jack abruptly.</p>

  <p>"In prison!" gasped Jack. "You're lying!"</p>

  <p>Interruption came from an unexpected quarter.</p>

  <p>George Gresham, watching the scene, caught Mayne's eye and nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is true," he said. "I was in court when she was first
  charged&mdash;that is where I saw your mother."</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Jack hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"On the day before my wedding, a friend of mine, a prison doctor at
  Trenton, telegraphed to me asking if I could take his duties for one day as
  he, also, curiously enough, wanted to go to a wedding. I hadn't the heart to
  refuse him, and went up to Trenton on the day I was married, taking my wife
  with me. Trenton Jail is an institution for women only, as you probably
  know," he went on. "I was making a visitation to three or four of the
  prisoners who had reported sick, and you can imagine my feelings when I
  walked into one of the cells and found the prisoner to be your wife and my
  good friend."</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Jack, as he paused.</p>

  <p>"She told me the whole story, and begged me to smuggle a note out of the
  prison that would allay your suspicion. The only stationery she had was
  prison notepaper, which obviously she could not send, so she tore a leaf out
  of her Bible and wrote the message with my fountain-pen. What that message
  was I never read. I said good-bye to her, arranged that I would take a room
  for her at the hotel, so that she would have somewhere to go on her release,
  and went back to Trenton from where I posted the letter. I had a talk about
  the matter with my wife, and she told me that I ought to write to you,
  whoever's feelings might be hurt, and tell you the whole story."</p>

  <p>There was a deep silence, broken only by the girl's sobs.</p>

  <p>"Why was my wife in prison?" asked Jack.</p>

  <p>"For shop-lifting," said Brinton calmly. "She was shopping with a woman
  who is a morphia fiend and, in consequence, has become a kleptomaniac. The
  woman stole a few paltry things and put them in your wife's bag. They were
  both arrested as they were going out of the shop, having been watched by a
  shop detective. They were taken to the manager's office, and in that time the
  elder woman begged your wife to take the blame, saying that she would explain
  to her son and would secure her immediate release. Your wife quixotically
  followed this advice. She gave the name of Mary Smith at the police court,
  and was remanded. At the end of a week she was brought up again, and expected
  to find her mother-in-law present to fulfil her promise. Mrs. Harvey was not
  there. Your wife went to prison with hard labour for one month. I explained
  all that in my letter."</p>

  <p>Jack Mayne sat with bowed head.</p>

  <p>Presently he got up, walked out of the room and slowly up the stairs. He
  knocked at his mother's door, and her voice bade him come in.</p>

  <p>Something in his face must have told her that all was not well, for she
  shrank back.</p>

  <p>"What do you want, sonny?" she asked in a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>"Mother," he said, "are you in the habit of taking morphia?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated a moment. "Yes, sonny," she said. He looked round.</p>

  <p>"I want the key of your room."</p>

  <p>"What room?"</p>

  <p>"Bluebeard's room," he said, with a grim smile, and she took a key from
  under her pillow and gave it to him with a hand that shook.</p>

  <p>He passed across the bedroom, fitted the key in the lock, opened the door
  and went in, switching on the light.</p>

  <p>He did not go far, for the room was littered with a thousand pitiful
  evidences of his mother's weakness. Scores of lace collars,
  handbags&mdash;all the little things that can be picked up at a big store,
  and shoved out of sight in a muff, lay in dust and confusion, a mute
  testimonial to Mrs. Harvey's activities.</p>

  <p>He came out of the room, locking it behind him, and pushed the key back
  under his mother's pillow.</p>

  <p>"Mother," he said, and it was the only word of reproach he uttered, "you
  allowed Gwen to suffer, to go through that hell!"</p>

  <p>The old lady turned her face to the wall and did not speak as he left the
  room.</p>

  <p>He came back to the dining-room and crossed to his wife.</p>

  <p>"Gwen," he said penitently, and she looked up and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Who is coming my way?" asked Dr. Brinton loudly.</p>

  <p>"I, for one," said George Gresham, and they made for the hail.</p>

  <p>Brinton was the last out, and closed the door gently.</p>

  <p>"A happy New Year!" he cried through the crack, and somebody threw a kiss
  at him.</p>

  <p>At least it sounded like that.</p>
