  <h2><a name="I"
     id="I"></a>I. &mdash; THE CANOEIST</h2>

  <p class="first">BROOME'S POINT proper is a crescent-shaped spit of sand
  separating the mouth of the Pocomico River from the waters of Chesapeake Bay.
  The end of the spit is decorated with one of those odd structures that our
  lighthouse service is so partial to, an octagonal house mounted on spreading,
  spindly piles, the whole looking uncommonly like a spider. The Broome estate
  comprises all the high ground back of the spit for upwards of four miles up
  the bay shore and a mile along the river. The mansion stands proudly on a
  bold bluff overlooking the river mouth. It is one of those square
  packing-boxes with a "cupalow" so popular with the builders of the sixties.
  It has never been painted since the first time and its once white face is
  streaked with rust from the gutters like the marks left by tears on dirty
  cheeks. One of the snuggest anchorages on the coast is under the bank upon
  which it stands. The river mouth itself forms a great basin three miles
  across in which all the navies of the world might ride. One shore of it is as
  wild and deserted as the other. A mile or so up the river lies Absolom's
  Island with its oystering village, connected with the hinterland by a
  causeway.</p>

  <p>On Decoration Day there was a battle-ship lying in the river. As Pen
  Broome flew in and out of the big house upon her interminable chores she had
  a distant view of the holiday crowds on the green common of the Island. Black
  and white splotches represented the game of ball that was going on between
  the island boys and the sailors and black dots stood for the automobiles of
  week-end trippers from the great world. Later Pen knew there had been a
  church supper under the big linden trees alongside the parsonage, and at
  night a dance up the county. Ordinarily Pen was not given to resenting her
  lot; she was too busy. She had no personal interest in sailors nor in the
  island boys, and very little in the county people, her own sort. But to-day
  the spectacle of holiday-making brought an unbearable gnawing to her breast.
  She was twenty-four.</p>

  <p>Pen was no tame and pathetic figure. She was the sort of youngster that is
  made savage by pain. Consequently next morning there was thunder in the air
  at Broome's Point. Pen's storms were rare and rather terrible. They cleared
  the air wonderfully. Perhaps it would have been better for that slack
  household if they had broken oftener. Black Aunt Maria Garner seeing her
  mistress' face, rolled the whites of her eyes apprehensively, and propelled
  her unwieldy bulk about the kitchen with a surprising celerity. She said
  cooingly:</p>

  <p>"Honey, Ah'm gwine beat yo' up nice li'l cheese souffle fo' yo'
  lunch!"</p>

  <p>"Go along with you, Aunt Maria!" cried Pen with an exasperated laugh. "I'm
  not going to be taken in with your cheese souffles! If you want to please me
  get your work done! Look at this kitchen!"</p>

  <p>"'Deed honey, Ah done come at sun-up this mawnin'. Deed I doggone swear
  did I!"</p>

  <p>"What good is your coming at sun-up or sun-down if you only rock your fat
  body on a chair and smoke that filthy pipe!"</p>

  <p>"Miss Penny, honey, I got the mos' awfulles' misehy..."</p>

  <p>"That's enough of your misery. When I came in that door you started to
  move as spry as a kitten after its tail!"</p>

  <p>At this moment the head of Theodo', Aunt Maria's sixth or thereabouts,
  appeared outside the kitchen window. Aunt Maria unseen by Pen silently and
  frantically waved him back, but his momentum was too great. He came on in
  with his foolish, engaging grin.</p>

  <p>Pen whirled around.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing in the house at this hour?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>Theodo's face turned ashy, but he still grinned. "Ah...Ah jes' come fo'
  watah," he stammered.</p>

  <p>"And left your horses standing in the field!" stormed Pen. "You don't want
  water. It's only because you can't keep your trifling mind on your work for
  more than half an hour at a time. To-morrow is the first of June and you
  haven't got your ploughing done! And everybody else's corn is six inches
  high! Go back to your horses and let me hear no more of water!"</p>

  <p>Theodo' slunk out.</p>

  <p>But the storm did not really break until Pen, going to make her butter,
  found the broken paddle of her churn still unmended. She marched back through
  the kitchen, through the big pantry into the dining-room bearing the broken
  paddle like Nemesis. Aunt Maria's vast body heaved in silent chuckles.</p>

  <p>"Boss gwine catch it now fo' sho'," she murmured, and waddling silently
  through the pantry, put her ear to the crack of the dining-room door.</p>

  <p>She was not disappointed. Within the dining-room lightning played about
  the startled head of the elder Pendleton Broome. And indeed young Pen was
  sorely tried. Her father was an amiable incompetent who frittered away his
  time on a dozen unprofitable hobbies while his estate fell into ruin about
  him. Not his fault entirely of course, for it was a hopeless job to keep up
  twenty-five hundred acres without any money. And not an acre of it salable.
  To get the smallest things done about the place required an expenditure of
  energy from Pen sufficient to have won campaigns. For weeks her father had
  been promising to mend her churn. Even with a whole churn she made butter
  under the greatest difficulties, because by the time he had got round to
  repairing the ice house it was too late to put up ice. She reminded him of
  that now...and of other things.</p>

  <p>Pendleton Broome essayed to pull the rags of his dignity about
  him...without much success. He was one of these half-hearted little corpulent
  men, partly bald, an odd and pathetic figure in his old clothes with an air
  of breeding still upon him. Often when she was abusing him the tears would
  suddenly spring into Pen's eyes.</p>

  <p>"But my dear, I can't keep my mind on butter!" he protested.</p>

  <p>"If I didn't keep my mind on butter we'd all starve!" stormed Pen.</p>

  <p>"I intended to mend the churn," he explained, "but in Friday's
  <i>Sun</i>-paper, as you know, another correspondent undertook to refute the
  arguments in my letter on the Mendelian theory. And in answering him I clean
  forgot about the churn!"</p>

  <p>"The Mendelian theory!" cried Pen. "Will that feed us?" Her voice went off
  into wild inextinguishable laughter. The little man stared at her with an
  affronted air. Pen suddenly turned and flew out through the hall and across
  the porch. Her storms generally ended in this way, in tears. Nobody ever saw
  her cry though.</p>

  <p>Running like a sand-piper she skimmed across the weedy lawn, threaded the
  bordering shrubbery and ducked through a gap in the palings. She ran along
  the edge of a little field behind the empty and ruinous tenant cottage, and
  into the woods by a faint path worn by her own feet and no other's. Two
  hundred yards within the woods she came out in a little clearing upon a bench
  of land overlooking a pond densely hemmed round by the woods, like a deep
  green bowl with brown water in the bottom. Here she cast herself down.</p>

  <p>The clearing contained, a strange sight in those rude surroundings, a
  little Doric temple dating from the eighteenth century. It was just a circle
  of plain columns holding up a little flattish dome, the marble all silvery
  with lichen, and wistfully beautiful against the greenery. Within the columns
  open to the winds was a raised grave of the period built of brick and topped
  with a marble slab carved with the Broome arms and with an inscription
  setting forth the virtues of a Pendleton Broome who died in 1720 at the age
  of twenty-three.</p>

  <p>This spot no doubt because of its disquieting beauty had long ago acquired
  a bad name in the neighborhood. It had been avoided by so many generations as
  to have become almost completely forgotten. Those of the natives who knew of
  it would not have ventured near under any circumstances. Pen herself had
  stumbled on the place by accident years before and had made it her own. With
  her own childish hands she had cleared out the undergrowth, and from time to
  time had planted ferns, "ivory", violets and the moccasin flower until in the
  spring it was like a flower-bedecked chancel with her young kinsman lying in
  state in the center of it.</p>

  <p>Pen looked upon the long dead youth as the brother she had never had in
  the flesh. Once she had looked up to him as her big brother, but lately he
  had become most lovably her junior, for he remained imperishably
  twenty-three. Not especially imaginative she nevertheless pictured him
  vividly in a plum-colored velvet suit with a flare to the skirt of his coat,
  Mechlin lace at his wrists and throat, sword at side and tricorn hat, his
  chestnut curls tied with a black moire ribbon. The Broomes were a
  bright-haired, blue-eyed race; Pen had brought black hair into the family
  from her mother's side. She pictured the earlier Pen mixing with the wits of
  his day with a bit of a swagger. According to family tradition he had died in
  London, and his body was shipped home to his inconsolable parents preserved
  in a cask of brandy. The stones of his little temple must have been brought
  from England too, in the tobacco ships. How dearly that Pen must have been
  loved, this Pen thought, and loved him the better for it.</p>

  <p>She cast herself down beside his grave and unpacked her heart. The real
  source of her pain had nothing to do with broken butter paddles of
  course.</p>

  <p>"Turkeys and chickens and ducks! Ducks and turkeys and chickens! Making
  butter three times a week and canning all summer! Is that all there is to
  live for as long as I live?...Ah my dear, my dear, if I had you really!
  Someone young to be with!...But I'm shriveling up alone!"</p>

  <p>But the place quieted her as it always did. She became silent. Bye and bye
  she turned her head sideways on her arm and looked down at the brown pond
  almost dusty in the sunshine and thought of nothing at all. Her face smoothed
  out. Pen's cheeks were not smooth like a doll's but had faint hollows of
  emotion that strangely stirred a man's breast. Nor was she of brittle build
  like a city maiden. Lying prone on the earth like that, in her full soft
  curves she symbolized the morning of earth.</p>

  <p>This place was on the other side of the point. Across the pond from where
  Pen lay, only a few hundred yards away, was the bay with its steamships
  passing up and down, but all hidden from her by the intervening greenery. A
  winding creeklet flowed in with the flood and out with the ebb. At low tide
  it lost itself in the sand of the beach outside. Nobody but Pen ever came
  near the spot. Year after year a white heron nested under a tangle of vines
  that hung in the water, and in the spring the great shad came flopping
  clumsily through three inches of water to spawn inside. Pen saw the white
  heron with a cautious preliminary look around, enter the thicket that
  concealed her nest, and watched lazily for her to reappear. With every breath
  the girl was unconsciously drawing comfort from the earth upon which she
  lay.</p>

  <p>Finally she sat up with a sigh and patted her hair into place. Her
  "sensible" look returned; a wry smile appeared about her lips. "You fool!"
  she said to herself. "Wasting the best hours of the day! When you get back
  even if the paddle is mended it will be too hot to churn! And by night the
  cream will be too sour!"</p>

  <p>She arose with a shake of her skirts and walked sedately and somewhat
  self-consciously back to the house, though there was none to see her. As soon
  as she came out from the woods the blue expanse of the river mouth was spread
  before her with the gray battle-ship lying out in mid-stream and off to the
  right Absolom's Island with its row of white cottages. She ducked through the
  fence and picked her way around the tangled shrubs. When she came out from
  under the mimosa tree she was greatly astonished to see a strange man sitting
  on the porch beside her father. Another step and she saw that he was young;
  one more step showed him to be uncommonly good-looking. Pen stopped dead in
  her tracks. Sternly repressing the impulse to run, she stiffened her back and
  putting on a haughty expression, marched on to meet the enemy.</p>

  <p>The hardest thing she had to do was to mount the porch. For the steps had
  rotted away and Pen's father had put down a little box and a big box to climb
  up on "until he got around to fixing the steps." The boxes had been there for
  two years now. Somebody had gone through the top of the little box and an old
  piece of board had been laid across it.</p>

  <p>The young man was a tall fellow; bright-haired, ruddy and smiling, with
  beautiful white teeth. He was wearing white flannel trousers of fine quality
  rather soiled and a snowy shirt cut off at the elbows and open to reveal a
  smooth brown throat. Pen was taken by surprise. Something about him, the
  strong bare neck like a column, the laughing eyes that had yet a sort of
  hunger in them too, turned her suddenly giddy. She was furious at her own
  weakness&mdash;and at him for being the cause of it. If in that moment he had
  said: "Come!" and had walked off with a curt jerk of the head, she would have
  had to follow. It was the secret consciousness of this that appalled her.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for her he was civilized. He merely smiled as a gentleman may
  in frank admiration&mdash;but not too frank. He was clearly what Pen called a
  gentleman. The thought was balm to her soul. For if he had not been she knew
  it would have been just the same with her. The first gentleman she had seen
  in so many months! It was comforting to be assured that they still walked the
  earth.</p>

  <p>As in a dream she heard her father saying: "Mr. Donald Counsell...my
  daughter. Her name is Pendleton Broome the same as my own. It is a family
  custom."</p>

  <p>She heard the young man apologizing for his appearance. "I never expected
  to..."</p>

  <p>Pen caught him up sharply. "Find white people here? You wouldn't. From the
  look of the place."</p>

  <p>Both men were disconcerted by her brusqueness. Pen was horribly ashamed of
  herself. "I will not blush!...I will not blush!" she said to herself, glaring
  out across the river. After the first glance she never looked at the young
  man again, but was nevertheless tinglingly conscious of his aspect; the fine
  lines of his body, his fair tanned skin, and always of those merry, speaking,
  wistful eyes. "What has happened to me?...What has happened to me?" a little
  voice within her seemed to be wailing.</p>

  <p>The young man tried to smooth things over. "What a heavenly spot! As I
  have already told your father, I'm loafing down the Bay in a canoe."</p>

  <p>"What do you do when the wind blows?" asked the elder Pendleton.</p>

  <p>"Oh, go ashore and sit and smoke by my fire."</p>

  <p>"Don't you get lonely?"</p>

  <p>A shadow crossed the young man's open countenance. "No, I'm fed up with
  people," he said shortly. "...That is, city people," he added with a glance
  through his lashes at Pen.</p>

  <p>A sudden flame of jealousy burned Pen's breast. "There have been many
  women in his life!" And immediately: "Oh, what a fool I am!" she promptly
  added.</p>

  <p>Pendleton glanced admonishingly at his daughter.</p>

  <p>Where was the courtesy to strangers for which the Broomes were famous? The
  glance was wasted upon Pen. An awkward silence resulted.</p>

  <p>Finally the young man said politely: "I came to see if I could get some
  butter and eggs."</p>

  <p>"Certainly" said Pen stiffly. "Eggs are twenty cents a dozen, butter forty
  cents the pound."</p>

  <p>She bit her tongue as soon as it was out, but could not have helped
  herself. Some power stronger than her will forced her to put her worst foot
  foremost. Pendleton père was frankly shocked, but the young man was not put
  out at all. He grinned at her delightfully and murmured too low for her
  father to hear:</p>

  <p>"Cheap at half the price!"</p>

  <p>It did not help Pen any. "He's laughing at me!" she said to herself in a
  rage. "Thinks he can have me at his own price!...He'll see!"</p>

  <p>Pendleton coughed behind his hand as a direct reminder to Pen of the
  time-honored hospitality of their house. Pen didn't get it. The effort to
  master her inexplicable emotions made her look almost stupid. In the end
  Pendleton himself was obliged to say:</p>

  <p>"You will have dinner with us?"</p>

  <p>Counsell's face lighted up. "You are very kind, but..." He looked at Pen
  again.</p>

  <p>"We'll be very pleased to have you," Pen said as primly as a school-marm,
  and despising herself for it. Why couldn't she be natural?</p>

  <p>"Well, thanks, I will," Counsell said heartily. "After three days in camp
  a square meal will be a godsend! I may say I'm no great shakes of a
  cook."</p>

  <p>Pen's breast warmed at the thought of feeding the youth. "Dinner" had the
  effect of recalling her scattered faculties. Her mind flew to the question:
  What is there?...The ham-bone?...Impossible!...Stuffed
  eggs...lettuce...radishes...strawberries. There is that bottle of my three
  year old grape wine...Not enough for a hungry man. He's so vigorous!...If I
  could put it off until half-past one I might get the boys to catch me some
  soft crabs...No, the tide is too high!...I have it! The cheese souffle!</p>

  <p>Excusing herself she went into the house to get her preparations under
  way. In the hall she came to a dead stop with her arms hanging limply, and
  looked into the future with a sort of horror. Her thought was: "I'm a
  goner!...I have lost myself...lost...!" She pulled herself together with a
  jerk and flew into the kitchen, where for the next half hour things hummed.
  Aunt Maria Garner loved to cook for company.</p>

  <p>Later, Pen having changed her dress, was setting the table. Through the
  open window she could hear her father retailing the Broome family history in
  the slightly throaty voice of self-importance. Pen knew his tale by
  heart.</p>

  <p>"...Settled here since 1710...2500 acres...the estate runs four miles up
  the Bay shore...The first house built here was a fine Colonial mansion with a
  pillared portico. Burned by the British on their expedition against
  Washington in the 1812 affair. A comfortable farmhouse with great chimneys
  arose out of its ruins. The present structure was erected in 1869. This was
  the style then, a great square block with a cupola. Considered magnificent in
  its day. Very fine rooms. You'll see them presently. It contains the oldest
  bath-room in Southern Maryland. Unfortunately out of order at present.</p>

  <p>"This house was built by my father on his return from Peru. He was a man
  of resource. When everybody hereabouts was ruined by the war he emigrated to
  South America. Got in with the right people in Peru and made a great fortune
  in a year or two. Invested it in Peruvian bonds. He returned and laid out the
  old family place on a princely scale, princely. Laid out twenty miles of
  roads through the woods for his guests to take horse exercise. At one time he
  had five hundred employees on the place white and black. How well I remember
  as a child when the family departed for Newport where my father had another
  place, they would all be lined up to say good-by in a double row extending
  far beyond the gate. We would walk between and my father would shake hands
  with each one and say a few kind words. There was scarcely a dry eye among
  them!"</p>

  <p>Pen, listening to this innocent tale, felt her cheeks burn.</p>

  <p>Pendleton concluded with a sigh: "Unfortunately there was a revolution in
  Peru. The dastardly cutthroats who seized the reins of government repudiated
  the obligations of their country."</p>

  <p>"In other words the bonds were N. G.," murmured Counsell.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. My father's fortune was swept away overnight. Since then it has
  been a struggle. Too much land and too little money. But I look for better
  times...better times."</p>

  <p>Counsell asked a question.</p>

  <p>"The railway," Pendleton answered with an air. "The Broome's Point
  railway. It will terminate in that gully down to the right there. It was
  first projected forty years ago, the right of way all graded and the trestles
  built ready for the rails. Unfortunately there was chicanery somewhere;
  construction was held up. Since then the enterprise has been revived from
  time to time, but something has always happened. But it will, it must come
  some day. I am bringing influence to bear. I have made liberal offers of land
  to the promoters. That is the finest harbor on the coast that lies before
  you. Baltimore is jealous. Powerful interests were brought to bear against
  the project the last time it was started. Trumped-up charges laid against the
  promoter."</p>

  <p>"What happened to him?" asked Counsell.</p>

  <p>"Well, he's in jail at present," said Pendleton ruefully. "But he will
  come out with flying colors. He enjoys my entire confidence. He explained
  everything to me. The railway must come before long. My place is all laid out
  in town lots."</p>

  <p>Pen gritted her teeth. She could picture the worldly-wise young man
  laughing at her foolish little father from behind his grave face.</p>

  <p>She called them into lunch. She was painfully conscious of the
  discrepancies of her house, but as a matter of fact Counsell was astonished
  when he entered. Pen had full control within the house and the squalor was
  left out of doors. The furniture, what there was left of it, dated from the
  same ugly period as the house, but there were certain touches; the lofty
  rooms were cool, inviting, full of charm. Poor as the Broomes were one could
  never mistake it for other than a lady's house. Particularly the dining-room
  with its velvety smooth walnut table, the hand-made mats, the dull old
  silver, the flowers, the delicious looking food.</p>

  <p>"Oh! but I'm hungry!" Counsell said involuntarily, showing all his white
  teeth.</p>

  <p>Glancing at Pen he found her eyes obstinately hidden, but she betrayed a
  dimple.</p>

  <p>Not until she heard Counsell pick up his knife and fork did she venture to
  look at him. She had been waiting for the moment when his attention would be
  distracted by food. The smooth turn of his ruddy cheek and his long, curved
  lashes hurt her with delight. There was something affectingly boyish about
  him for all his strength and his assured air. Pen yearned to mother that
  shining head against her breast. She never looked at him but the once, yet
  she was aware of every mouthful he took, and every mouthful gave her
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Pendleton Broome opened his eyes rather at the spread. The glance of
  reproof that he sent across to Pen suggested that while hospitality was the
  first law of the Broomes, still there should be reason in all things. From
  that moment with true male consistency he began to cool towards their young
  guest.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, charmed to have a sophisticated listener, he aired all his
  quaint and impractical theories. He dabbled in chemistry amongst other
  things, and had a great store of pseudo-scientific patter. Counsell listened
  politely and made the suitable rejoinders, but never lost an opportunity of
  trying to draw Pen into the talk. Pen, resisting his efforts, was
  nevertheless secretly delighted with his adroitness. It made her realize how
  she had been hungering for the graces of intercourse.</p>

  <p>Once Counsell asked her directly: "Do you know New York?"</p>

  <p>"I went to school there." She named a famous finishing school.</p>

  <p>Counsell could not but look his surprise.</p>

  <p>"I had a legacy," said Pen demurely. Her father frowned.</p>

  <p>"Then you know people in New York?" Counsell said eagerly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I have not kept up with the girls."</p>

  <p>"She deliberately dropped them!" her father put in with an aggrieved air.
  "It is the infernal Broome pride. She was most popular in school."</p>

  <p>Pen laughed lightly. "Northerners are different," she said. "They don't
  make a merit of their departed glories."</p>

  <p>It was her way of letting Counsell know, without being disloyal to her
  father, that she did not share in her elder's delusions. The young man looked
  at her in a new way. It was the first inkling of her real nature that she had
  given him. Pen felt his look through and through her.</p>

  <p>Pendleton took advantage of the pause to secure the floor again, and held
  it for some time. But he had to eat too, and as soon as he stopped talking to
  chew, Counsell turned to Pen.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it rather lonely here?"</p>

  <p>"Mercy, no!" laughed Pen. "Far too much to do!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose there are lots of agreeable people in the neighborhood?"</p>

  <p>"Up the county, oh yes," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"And you have all sorts of jolly parties?"</p>

  <p>"They do," said Pen briefly.</p>

  <p>"Not you?"</p>

  <p>Pen explained. "The road from here up the Neck that connects us with the
  world has become impassable for motors, even if we had one. Even a buggy can
  scarcely get through now. By road it's twelve miles to the nearest white
  man's house. Excepting the squatters. Our only way of communication is by
  motor-boat with the Island. Our friends do not live on the Island. And we've
  no way of getting up the county."</p>

  <p>"Have you no white neighbors at all?" he asked aghast.</p>

  <p>"Old Mr. Weems Locket who keeps the lighthouse."</p>

  <p>"No white woman near?"</p>

  <p>Pen shrugged. "No special hardship in that. I like men just as well as
  women."</p>

  <p>"Nobody but the light-keeper?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, in bad weather the bug-eyes and the pungy-boats lie under our
  bank and the skippers come ashore to call on father and use the
  telephone."</p>

  <p>"In winter it must be hard."</p>

  <p>"Oh things are never really as bad as they seem to one who doesn't know
  them."</p>

  <p>Just the same his sympathetic voice drew something out of her. For the
  first time she gave him her eyes freely. Wonderful dark, glowing eyes that
  won something of him that he never got back again. Her laughing, somber
  glance said as plainly as if the words had been spoken: "The winter here is
  Hell!" His eyes laughed back in hers, surrendering, and for an instant they
  were one.</p>

  <p>This brief interchange was terribly sweet to Pen; so sweet that it scared
  her. For some time afterwards she was quite stiff with him, and his eyes
  reproached her.</p>

  <p>When they left the table and went out on the porch Counsell made a
  deliberate move to separate her from her prosy father. With all his
  politeness the young man had a resolute air.</p>

  <p>"I think this is simply the finest site for a house that I have ever
  seen," he said to Pen. "Let's walk out and look over the edge of the
  bank."</p>

  <p>Pen's heart leaped&mdash;then sank again, remembering the morning's work
  still undone, and the afternoon's work all to do. Pendleton looked injured,
  but as no one paid the slightest attention to him he made believe to
  recollect something important that he had to do, and went into the house. Pen
  pleaded with her sterner self: "Just for a few minutes!" Meanwhile she was
  being firmly urged towards the boxes. Before she was aware of having given
  in, she found herself well on the way.</p>

  <p>They strolled across the neglected lawn, matted with horse-mint, too spicy
  a vegetable to the taste of the stock that wandered over the place. The drive
  once paved with shell, made a wide circular sweep in front of the house, but
  the shell had disappeared under the horse-mint too. Part of the old bed
  enclosed within the drive Pen had dug up and put in a few dahlias. These she
  had essayed to protect from the horses and cows and sheep by a miscellaneous
  barricade of boxes and boards. She blushed for it now. She couldn't explain
  to him that she had an instinct for flowers that had to find some outlet.</p>

  <p>The earthen bank was sixty feet high. In the days of the place's glory an
  ingenious gardener had planted honeysuckle at the base to keep it from
  washing and now the tangled vines swept all the way up to their feet in a
  bottle green wave flecked with the foam of its pale blossoms. The scent of it
  was dangerously enervating to youth.</p>

  <p>"The whole world down here is full of honeysuckle," murmured Don. "In the
  evening you can smell it far out in the Bay."</p>

  <p>An ineffably lovely panorama was spread before them, which the light haze
  customary to that soft land, endowed with a curiously moving quality. For
  awhile in silence their eyes ranged back and forth from Absolom's Island on
  the one side out over the intenser blue of the Bay. At their feet rode a
  battered old schooner with a deckload of cord wood. Down at the left the
  octagonal lighthouse on its spindly legs was just within range of their
  vision.</p>

  <p>"My camp is down there," said Don. "On the other side of the old wharf.
  The curve in the beach hides it."</p>

  <p>They sat down with their feet hanging over the edge. Pen's conscience was
  protesting more faintly now. She had recovered from her surprise attack and
  had her forces pretty well in hand. She found she was all right if she
  avoided looking at him. There was something leaping out of his eyes that
  simply confounded her. They talked about anything and nothing. He wanted to
  make her talk, whereas she desired to hear him. So they fenced. The little
  undertones of bitterness, of self-mockery, in Pen's laughter struck
  powerfully on the man's imagination. It appeared that this girl most
  decidedly had a flavor of her own.</p>

  <p>He was reluctant to talk about himself and Pen could not ask questions.
  Consequently her hungry ears were obliged to pounce on the implications of
  his talk for information. He was of the great world it appeared. He knew
  everybody. He was not a mere philistine. He knew books, pictures, music; all
  that Pen thirsted for; and the people who made such things were among his
  friends. "Though I'm only a common stockbroker," he put in with a laugh. This
  pleased Pen. She thought: "I wouldn't want an artist for a lover"&mdash;and
  blushed for the thought. He was exactly what she wished him to be. It seemed
  to her magical that such a one should have been brought into her life if only
  for an hour or two. Only for an hour or two! She kept telling herself that
  firmly. "He'll be gone to-morrow and I wishing he had never come!" That was
  the explanation of the bitterness.</p>

  <p>She did ask him one question. "How on earth did you come to stray down
  here?"</p>

  <p>He said: "I read somewhere, years ago, what a lovely and little known
  country there was on the western shore of Chesapeake Bay...I keep a canoe and
  a little tent handy in a club-house in New York. Whenever the world is too
  much with me I just paddle off for a few days."</p>

  <p>Pen's few minutes lengthened out into an hour and she had simply not the
  strength to send him away. In the end her father was seen approaching, his
  discolored straw hat placed just so, a jute bag over his arm.</p>

  <p>"I'm going over to the Island to get the mail," he said to Counsell in an
  offhand tone. "Like to come along? It's considered very picturesque."</p>

  <p>Counsell looked at Pen in indecision. He most assuredly did not want to
  go, but perhaps the best way to make headway with the girl was to be
  agreeable to the old man. You couldn't always tell.</p>

  <p>"Won't you come too?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Pen shook her head. "I've a hundred things to do."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't I help?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>Pen laughed clearly. "Heavens! what do you know about turkey chicks? Or
  making butter and cleaning house?"</p>

  <p>He still hesitated.</p>

  <p>Pen arose briskly. "Run along," she commanded. "When you come back perhaps
  you'll stay to supper." She had not intended to ask him. It was surprised out
  of her. It surprised her father too. "Was that necessary?" his elevated
  eyebrows asked. He did not like this young man as well as he had in the
  beginning.</p>

  <p>Counsell blushed red with pleasure. "That is kind," he said.</p>

  <p>"Then mind you're back in time," said Pen, leaving them. "You never can
  tell about the engine in our boat."</p>

  <p>She flew about her work. The butter got itself made, and the eggs
  collected. Sundry small chicks were treated for the gaps, and the far
  wandering turkeys rounded up. Preparations were set on foot for a real
  Southern Maryland supper; soft crabs, fried chicken, hot biscuits, strawberry
  shortcake. If Pen had had her way she would have stuffed her young man like a
  Strasbourg goose.</p>

  <p>All afternoon she was filled with an excitement that was neither wholly
  pleasurable nor painful. Her heart would keep rising in her throat, and stern
  discipline was required to put it down. Finally she red up the house. She
  lingered in the guest-room her hand caressing the white spread, while she
  debated whether she might ask him to spend the night. She foresaw her
  father's look of disapproval but that did not influence her much. But she
  decided against it with a firm shake of the head. "Only prolong the agony,"
  she said to herself, with her little smile of self-mockery.</p>

  <p>In the midst of her activities she often found time to run out on the
  porch where she could observe the progress of the <i>Pee Bee</i>, that
  slab-sided little marine monster that ploughed through the water so fiercely
  at the rate of five miles an hour. It would take them fifty minutes to go and
  come if they did not loiter, but her father would be sure to want to show
  Counsell the Island, and incidentally show off Counsell to the Islanders; he
  would get into talk with men at the store. Sure enough it was four o'clock
  before they started home. Half way over the <i>Pee Bee</i> suddenly stopped.
  Pen could see her father crouching over the engine in the way she knew so
  well. Counsell was perched up on the bow looking towards Broome Point. So
  much the better for him if he knew nothing about engines. Time passed and
  they did not budge. "How bored he must be!" Pen thought anxiously. "It will
  sicken him of us!"</p>

  <p>At last the <i>Pee Bee</i> began to move ahead by fits and starts,
  Pendleton darting to and fro between wheel and engine. How familiar Pen was
  with the little comedy that was taking place on board! Pendleton would never
  let anybody else steer! When the <i>Pee Bee</i> finally passed under the bank
  Pen could still follow her progress by the noise she made. She arranged
  matters so that supper should come on the table at the moment the disgruntled
  men crossed the porch.</p>

  <p>She had put on the black net evening dress that had been made over three
  times. A red peony in her corsage freshened it up a good deal, but in the end
  Pen threw it away. "Too coquettish!" she said, jeering at her reflection in
  the mirror. She had no idea how lovely she looked with her perfect neck and
  arms, her fine capable hands a little roughened by work, her eyes big with
  feeling yet determinedly reticent, and those soft, red, bitter lips.</p>

  <p>Her heart sank fathoms deep when Pendleton came in alone.</p>

  <p>"Where's Mr. Counsell?" she asked very offhand.</p>

  <p>"Stopped in his tent to tidy up a bit," said Pendleton...</p>

  <p>"Was it necessary..." he began reprovingly.</p>

  <p>"You'd better do the same," said Pen coolly.</p>

  <p>Pendleton dropped the bag of mail in the hall and went upstairs
  registering disapproval in every step. Pen rushed the supper out into the
  oven again. Her heart was singing.</p>

  <p>Though it was still bright out-of-doors the dining-table was lighted by a
  red-shaded swinging lamp. To be sure the shade was only of paper, but it made
  none the less a cheerful glow. When Counsell came into the room his good
  manners failed him; he stopped short and stared at Pen in silence. Pen could
  not look at him. She said to herself: "He's amused at my silliness; dressing
  up in these old rags!"</p>

  <p>At the table they gave Pendleton full sway and it improved his humor.
  Counsell had discovered that it pleased Pen best to have him encourage her
  father. Counsell's conversation with her was limited to compliments on the
  wonderful eats. Pen received it with her little twisted smile. That was the
  way she was. She knew he meant it, but it hurt&mdash;how it hurt! Because it
  signified nothing. Nothing would come of it. A long course of self-discipline
  had taught Pen never to build on the prospect of happiness, that thereby she
  might be saved a crushing disappointment when happiness failed to
  materialize.</p>

  <p>At the conclusion of the meal Counsell got his reward when it appeared
  that Pendleton, owing to the time he had wasted on the river, still had his
  chores to do about the place. He departed for the barn. Aunt Maria Garner
  waddled back and forth, clearing the table and rolling her eyes at the guest.
  She was not a well-trained servant.</p>

  <p>"Shall we go outside?" suggested Counsell.</p>

  <p>"Mosquitoes!" said Pen smiling.</p>

  <p>She led the way into the great dim drawing-rooms on the other side of the
  hall. The only illumination was given by a piano lamp with a yellow paper
  shade standing beside an old ebony upright.</p>

  <p>"You play?" asked Counsell.</p>

  <p>"Not for you," said Pen promptly. "You know too much."</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I'd rather have you talk to me," he said. "We haven't started to
  get acquainted yet."</p>

  <p>Pen's inner voice cried: "What's the use? What's the use?"</p>

  <p>Her little painful smile tantalized him. He said involuntarily: "You mock
  at everything I say."</p>

  <p>"Not at you," said Pen. "At myself!"</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you," he complained.</p>

  <p>"And you have known so many girls!" said Pen, drawing down the corners of
  her lips.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "But never one like you. In town they seem to be cut out
  pretty much to a pattern. Some well cut, some badly. But all the same
  pattern."</p>

  <p>Pen thought: "He's a good-natured sort. He thinks I expect to hear this
  sort of thing."</p>

  <p>There they sat side by side on the big sofa in the seductive half light of
  the great room&mdash;but something was the matter. They made no progress.
  Perhaps having desired this moment so much, the realization of it frightened
  them. With too much feeling they were dumb; and they did not know each other
  well enough to be comfortably silent together. So each made various attempts
  to start something which only resulted in utter banality. They found
  themselves talking as primly as a couple in an old-fashioned romance. The
  sources of laughter were frozen up. And the more self-conscious they became,
  the stiffer grew their tongues.</p>

  <p>It was chiefly Pen's fault. She got the notion in her head that he merely
  desired to repay her hospitality with a little gallantry, and she blighted
  his warm overtures as with a frost. It was due to her fatal instinct to guard
  against a pain which might be more than she could bear.</p>

  <p>However the young man was determined; moreover he had a reputation to keep
  up. More experienced than Pen he had learned how a little naturalness clears
  the air, and he was resolved to speak his mind no matter how hard she made it
  for him. In the end he blurted it out awkwardly:</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I tell you?...a fellow like me...knocking about...making a
  joke of everything...you get the notion girls are charming useless creatures
  you've got to put up with because they're so charming...And lots of them are
  useless without even being charming...Makes a man cynical...And then to meet
  one more charming than any and <i>useful!</i>...Oh, I express myself
  rottenly!...Well, it gives you a jolt. You've got to rearrange all your
  ideas..."</p>

  <p>This was simply more than Pen could bear. She insisted to herself that it
  was simply gallantry on his part. Gallantry is part of the Maryland
  tradition. She laughed in a way that dried him up, and made him turn a dull
  red.</p>

  <p>"Thanks for useful," she said.</p>

  <p>The sullen, hurt glance he bent on her seemed to say: "You're charming but
  you're very prickly!"</p>

  <p>That put the finish to their conservation. To the outward view they
  presented the spectacle of two normal young people slightly bored with each
  other and exchanging perfunctory remarks, but in reality each was suffering
  keenly. They couldn't make it go. Pendleton returned to the dining-room where
  they could hear him rattling the newspaper, and they were even ready to wish
  that he would come in and separate them in their unhappiness. Finally
  Counsell got the idea that Pen wished to be rid of him. After all he'd been
  hanging about the place all day. He rose to go.</p>

  <p>Pen's heart said: "This is the end!" But her face only showed a polite and
  wistful blank. She said quietly:</p>

  <p>"You'll be moving on to-morrow, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," he said sullenly.</p>

  <p>Pen greatly wished to say: "Well don't forget us," or something of the
  sort, light and friendly, but she could not get the words out.</p>

  <p>And of course he took her silence to mean it was all one to her whether he
  went or stayed.</p>

  <p>But he could not go like that. He hung indecisively at the door of the
  room. Finally he blurted out like a boy:</p>

  <p>"I say, what's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Why, nothing!" answered Pen with a startled look,</p>

  <p>"This afternoon we were like pals...What have I done to offend you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"Oh," he said sorely, "then it's just that you don't fancy my style much
  anyhow."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wouldn't say that!" said Pen with a teasing smile. Heaven knows
  what it cost her.</p>

  <p>"I quite understand," he said with a man's absurd injured vanity.</p>

  <p>"You understand nothing!" murmured Pen.</p>

  <p>He moved to the front door, and failed to hear her. For a moment or two
  they looked unhappily out at the night. The moon had risen behind the house
  and was casting long shadows athwart the lawn. Beyond the edge of the bank
  there was a mystical sea of subdued radiance.</p>

  <p>"Well...good-night...good-by," he mumbled. "Thank you so much for your
  kindness...good-by."</p>

  <p>"My kindness!" Pen's heart cried. "Good-by," she said aloud, without a
  suspicion of a shake or a tremor. "Father is in the dining-room."</p>

  <p>"Please say good-night to him for me," he said hurriedly... "Good-by." He
  held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-by," said Pen, letting her cold fingers lie within his for a moment
  without any response to his pressure.</p>

  <p>He went slowly across the front porch and stepped down. She closed the
  door. She stood there, her arms hanging. Her thoughts were like a dialogue
  back and forth within her.</p>

  <p>"He didn't want to go. Why did you send him?...But what did he want to
  stay for? Just a summer night's flirtation. That would have finished me. It's
  better this way...Maybe he meant it...No! That sort of happiness is not for
  me! Might as well get used to it soon as late!...I'm not going to run
  upstairs and cry, either! There are the chickens to fasten up, the yeast to
  make and the milk to set out!" Her arms went up above her head and fell
  again. "Oh God! but life is dreary!"</p>

  <p>From the dining-room her father called her in a strange, agitated voice
  that sent the blood flying from her heart:</p>

  <p>"Pen! Pen! Come here, quickly!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="II"
     id="II"></a>II. &mdash; THE STORY IN THE <i>SUN</i> PAPER</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Pen ran into the dining-room she found the little man
  seated at the table, his reading glasses on his nose and the newspaper spread
  before him. The face that he raised to her was pale and moist with
  excitement; his hands gripping the edge of the paper made it rattle with
  their trembling. Nevertheless in her first glance Pen was assured that no
  disaster threatened their house. There was even a sort of pleasure mixed with
  his horror. Her first reaction was to chagrin at having been frightened for
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" she asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"Look! Look!" he said, pointing to the paper.</p>

  <p>With her own swift, swimming motion she moved behind him, and looked down
  over his shoulder. She read staring headlines:</p>

  <p>WEALTHY NEW YORK STOCKBROKER FOUND MURDERED</p>

  <p>She was freshly annoyed by what seemed to be such ridiculous excitement.
  "What's that got to do with you?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Read! Read!" he said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>She impatiently read what was under the headlines:</p>

  <p>"Collis Dongan of the old New York family, wealthy clubman and member of
  the Stock Exchange, was found dead in his apartment last night. Mr. Dongan, a
  widower without children resided at the exclusive Hotel Warrington. The body
  was found by his valet George Canfield who had been away on a vacation
  granted him by his master over the holiday. The revolver with which the deed
  was done was found lying near, and at first it was supposed to be a case of
  suicide. But Doctor Raymond Morsell the hotel physician who was quickly
  summoned by the frightened servant, instantly pronounced that the wound could
  not have been self-inflicted. The bullet had entered the base of the skull.
  The body was found lying in Mr. Dongan's living-room. It was fully clothed.
  There were no signs of any struggle. Every indication pointed to the fact
  that he had been shot down from behind without warning. Apparently he had
  been dead three days. His blood was matted and dried in the rug on which he
  lay."</p>

  <p>Pen looked up in disgust. "What do you want me to read this horrible stuff
  for?" she asked. "It's like all the other cases."</p>

  <p>"Read on!" said her father.</p>

  <p>"After having summoned the doctor, the valet's next thought was to notify
  the dead man's partner Donald Counsell who occupied an apartment on the same
  floor in another part of the hotel..."</p>

  <p>Pen read this name without any sensation beyond a sudden quickening of
  interest. She needed no further urging to read on.</p>

  <p>"...but Counsell was not found in the hotel. Developments followed fast
  after that. The valet, Canfield, remembered that when he left his master on
  Friday night Counsell was with him, and the two men were quarrelling,
  apparently over business matters. He heard Counsell, who is a young man,
  violently abusing his senior. Dongan was not seen alive after that. Various
  persons living in the hotel testified to having heard a muffled sound which
  might have been a shot at 11.15 Friday night. At 11.20 the night clerk saw
  Counsell leaving the hotel, clearly in a state of agitation.</p>

  <p>"The dead man's brother, Richard H. Dongan, vice-president of the Barrow
  Trust Company, was notified, and at his suggestion a hasty search of the
  books of Dongan and Counsell was conducted for the purpose of establishing a
  possible motive for the crime. The firm was found to be heavily involved
  owing to certain speculations of the junior partner on the exchange. By the
  break in Union Central last week Counsell stood to lose seventy-five thousand
  dollars, which apparently he had no means of raising. It is supposed that he
  appealed to his partner for help, and upon being indignantly refused, shot
  the elder man. The case against Counsell was made complete when Thomas
  Dittmars bookkeeper to Dongan and Counsell reluctantly identified the
  revolver as one belonging to Counsell, and pointed out Counsell's initials
  scratched on the butt. The bookkeeper knew the weapon because more than once
  it had been loaned to him when he had a large amount of Liberty bonds to
  deliver for the firm. Dittmars knew nothing of the transactions in Union
  Central because they were entered in the firm's private ledger to which only
  the partners had access. No trace of Counsell has been discovered since he
  left the hotel."</p>

  <p>Thus far the summary of facts which heads all newspaper stories. Several
  columns of comment and hypothesis followed:</p>

  <p>"On the face of it it is one of the most dastardly crimes in recent years.
  Dongan befriended the young man upon his graduation from college and admitted
  him to a partnership in his business only to be swindled and finally to be
  shot down by his protege."</p>

  <p>Pen for the moment disregarded what followed. She had to stop and think,
  she would have said, but as a matter of fact she was incapable of thinking.
  She was conscious only of a dull horror that numbed her faculties. She had
  not yet taken it in. Outwardly she was quite composed. With the palm of her
  hand she thoughtfully polished a dull spot on the velvety surface of the
  table.</p>

  <p>Pendleton fairly babbled in his excitement. "When I first read the story
  he was in the drawing-room with you. I didn't know what to do! I didn't know
  what to do!"</p>

  <p>Pen was sharply recalled to the necessity for action. "Well, what are you
  going to do?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"My duty," said the little man swelling a little.</p>

  <p>"Inform against him?"</p>

  <p>"Inform? What a word to use!" said Pendleton with asperity. "I mean to
  give him up to justice as he richly deserves."</p>

  <p>"But he didn't do it," said Pen with an odd, detached air. The words came
  out of her involuntarily.</p>

  <p>Pendleton stared. "How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"By instinct," she said simply.</p>

  <p>"Fiddlesticks!" said Pendleton. "You read the paper, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>Pen merely smiled the smile that women use when they decline to argue with
  a man. It is very exasperating to a man.</p>

  <p>"You have seen the man once and exchanged a few pleasantries with him!" he
  cried. "Do you presume to decide from that whether or not he is capable of
  murder?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose he could shoot a man&mdash;with sufficient provocation," she
  said coolly. "Any man could I suppose...But not like that. Not in the
  back!"</p>

  <p>Pendleton flung up his hands. "Isn't that like a woman! Just because he
  has fine eyes I suppose, and a taking smile!"</p>

  <p>It never reached Pen who was busy with her own thoughts. She knew in her
  heart without reason, without arguments that the charge was false, but she
  was searching for reasons that would convince a man. Her instinct led her
  unerringly to the weak spots of the case against Counsell.</p>

  <p>"Why should he leave his pistol behind to convict him?" she asked. "Why
  should he introduce himself to us under his right name?"</p>

  <p>Pendleton waved this impatiently aside. "Oh, they always make some slips.
  That's how they're caught. From the first I felt there was something funny
  about him."</p>

  <p>"It was you who first asked him to stay," said Pen indignantly.</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I didn't expect the house to be turned upside down to entertain
  him," he retorted. "Something funny about him, skulking down the Bay like
  that. You remember how he said he preferred to be alone."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing criminal in that!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Very strange he should slink out of the house without
  saying good-night to me. Perhaps he saw me reading the paper."</p>

  <p>Pen all but wrung her hands. This was men's boasted logic. How could an
  intelligent person cope with it?</p>

  <p>The little man got up with an important air.</p>

  <p>"Don't act in haste, Dad," Pen pleaded earnestly. "Something tells me you
  will regret it. At least sleep on it!"</p>

  <p>"He will be gone in the morning," Pendleton said. A look of dismay
  appeared in his face. "Good Heavens! If he suspects anything he will push off
  at once!"</p>

  <p>"Would you be sorry?" Pen asked astonished.</p>

  <p>Pendleton was momentarily disconcerted. "Well no...of course not. But I
  must do my duty just the same...This is an important case. I must act with
  prudence. The eyes of the world will be upon us now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the newspapers!" cried Pen. "They poison our lives!"</p>

  <p>Pendleton was already at the door of the room. "Are you going to take him
  single-handed?" queried Pen.</p>

  <p>He hesitated, puffing a little bit to conceal his discomposure. "The
  negroes..." he hazarded.</p>

  <p>"Ellick and Theodo'!" said Pen with curling lip.</p>

  <p>Pendleton rubbed his bald crown. "You're right" he said. "Worse than
  useless. I'll go to the lighthouse for Weems Locket and his assistant."</p>

  <p>"You'll have to pass the tent on the beach."</p>

  <p>"I'll row around in my skiff," said Pendleton craftily.</p>

  <p>"With muffled oars?" she asked scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Why yes," he said innocently. He was impervious to her scorn.</p>

  <p>"Dad, you <i>must</i> listen to me!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"This is man's work," he said, swelling up. "You must leave it to me."</p>

  <p>A sick horror overcame her, that men were so insensible to the truth. What
  could one do with them? It was evident from the whole tone of the story she
  had read that men had already made up their minds as to Counsell's guilt. Let
  one of them raise the cry and all were ready to give tongue as thoughtlessly
  as a pack of hounds. It was not the desire for justice that moved them but a
  sort of blood lust. They would try him with all their solemn farcical forms
  of justice, but none the less he would be railroaded to a shameful death!</p>

  <p>"Dad! You mustn't. You don't know what you're doing!" she murmured,
  swaying.</p>

  <p>He stared his displeasure. "Pendleton, Is it possible that you...that this
  young man..."</p>

  <p>She contrived some sort of a laugh. "What nonsense!"</p>

  <p>He turned out of the door saying: "I must act at once."</p>

  <p>Pen gasped: "Dad!" and keeled over on a chair. The swoon was perfectly
  genuine, but she lost consciousness only for the space of a breath, and
  thereafter her wits worked with the swiftness of desperation. He was deaf to
  truth, to reason, to sense, very well then, she must use a woman's weapons
  against him. It was Pendleton's transports of distress that gave her her
  cue.</p>

  <p>"Penny, Penny, my child!" he was crying wildly.</p>

  <p>Pen's mother had died a young woman of a heart attack, and the fear that
  Pen might have inherited her weakness was ever present in the good, absurd
  little man's breast. It was Pen's final weapon. Be it said to her credit she
  had never used it before. She put her hand to her breast without
  speaking.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my child! Look at me! Speak to me!" he implored.</p>

  <p>"Help me to my room!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>He made a manful attempt to pick her up in his arms, but she was as big as
  he. He could not lift her.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do!" he wailed, wringing his hands.</p>

  <p>"I can walk," she said. "If you will help me."</p>

  <p>"But the stairs!"</p>

  <p>"Let me lie down in the drawing-room until I feel better."</p>

  <p>He helped her across the hall and Pen sank down on the old linen-covered
  sofa with the broken springs. She was still pressing her hand to her breast
  in that mute gesture that drove him to distraction. In truth she was pale
  enough, but it was not from heart disease.</p>

  <p>He made her as comfortable as he could; he brought her a glass of water.
  He scampered back into the hall to call up the doctor. After agitated appeals
  to other subscribers to get off the line he finally got Doctor Hance on
  Absolom's Island. But evidently the doctor declined to make the long drive
  around the head of the creeks and down the impassable Neck road. Pendleton
  must come for him in his boat he said. In vain the distracted father pleaded
  that he could not leave his child; the doctor was firm.</p>

  <p>Finally Pendleton said: "Very well, I'll come at once. Wait for me on the
  steamboat dock."</p>

  <p>Pen's breast became easier. This plan suited her very well.</p>

  <p>Crying that he was going to get Aunt Maria Garner, he ran out of the
  house. The negro cabin was some three hundred yards behind the big house.</p>

  <p>Pen used the interim to get her thoughts in some kind of order. She began
  to be conscious of a sort of exaltation. Her thoughts ran: "He's in trouble!
  I shall not lose him now I...Every man's hand is raised against him. He has
  no one but me to depend on. He's mine!" There was a terrible joy in the
  thought of standing side by side with him against the whole world. Her breast
  burned with a fire of resolution. She even had a fleeting regret that he was
  not guilty; if he had been it would have required her to give so much more.
  "I love him! I love him!" she said to herself now without shame.</p>

  <p>Pendleton returned with Aunt Maria. Pen was aware of Ellick's and Theodo's
  black faces peering in at the windows. This interfered with her plans.</p>

  <p>"Send them away," she murmured. "There is nothing they can do."</p>

  <p>Aunt Maria went out on the porch and shooed her sons home.</p>

  <p>Coming back the big negress picked Pen up without more ado and carried her
  up the stairs. Aunt Maria had been the first person in the world to receive
  Pen into her arms, and appeared to be unconscious of any increase in her
  darling's weight. Pendleton fluttered about her like a hen crying at every
  step:</p>

  <p>"Be careful! Oh, be careful!"</p>

  <p>Aunt Maria laid Pen down on her bed.</p>

  <p>In the midst of his passionate solicitude, a queer little suspicion
  flickered up in Pendleton's eyes. "While I am gone for the doctor don't let
  her exert herself in the slightest," he commanded.</p>

  <p>Aunt Maria reassured him and he hastened out of the house.</p>

  <p>The instant the front door closed behind him Pen sat up in bed, and felt
  of her hair. Aunt Maria took it as a matter of course. Unlettered though she
  might be, she had a fully-developed set of instincts; she knew that all sorts
  of expedients were required to manage those unreasonable creatures, men, and
  she awaited the explanation with an air of being surprised at nothing and
  ready for anything.</p>

  <p>"I've got to go out," said Pen, exchanging her evening slippers for a pair
  of rubber-soled sneakers.</p>

  <p>Aunt Maria looked rather dubious.</p>

  <p>Pen saw that she would win her more securely by appealing to her sense of
  romance. She began: "That young man who had lunch and dinner with us..."</p>

  <p>Aunt Maria's broad face softened and her eyes rolled zestfully.</p>

  <p>"There is a story in the paper accusing him of murder!"</p>

  <p>It was not what Aunt Maria expected. Her chin dropped, and her eyes almost
  started from her head. "Bless God!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Father means to give him up. So I'm going down to warn him."</p>

  <p>In Aunt Maria fear overcame romance. "Honey...honey!" she stammered. "Doan
  yo' go down there! Doan yo' take no chances! If he's a bad man he'll hurt
  yo'!"</p>

  <p>"A bad man!" cried Pen with shining eyes. "Aunt Maria where were your
  eyes!"</p>

  <p>The old negress was awed by that light in her child's eyes.
  "Well...well..." she murmured, "he sho was a pretty young man!"</p>

  <p>Seizing a sweater to cover her bare arms and neck, Pen ran out of the room
  and down the stairs. Aunt Maria sat down muttering and shaking her head.</p>

  <p>Softly closing the big door behind her, Pen sped over the weedy drive. The
  main gate to the grounds was in the side fence near the edge of the bank.
  Half of it hung askew on one hinge and the other half lay rotting on the
  earth. Outside the gate there was a grassy road which made a right-angled
  turn there. In one direction it ran back between the fields and on up the
  Neck; in the other it went straight ahead along the edge of the bank and
  presently descended to the old steamboat wharf on the property. So swift had
  Pen been that her father was still in sight, his lantern jogging agitatedly
  down the road in front of her. He always carried a lantern irrespective of
  the moon. She slackened her pace.</p>

  <p>The road ran gently down a natural fault in the high bank. The earth was
  powdered with silver dust; a mocking-bird sang its casual and thrilling song
  nearby, and farther off whip-poor-wills. The bushes that rose between the
  road and the edge of the bank were festooned with the vines of the wild
  grape. It was the moment of its flowering and in this place its strange,
  poignant fragrance drowned the honeysuckle. In after life Pen never smelled
  that scent without living this night over. She was quite collected now.
  Terror, anxiety, shame and such feelings had been burned up by her great
  determination.</p>

  <p>The road ended before the dilapidated wharf where no steamer had tied up
  for many years past. Pendleton's skiff was drawn up on the sand alongside,
  and the <i>Pee Bee</i> anchored a hundred feet out in the stream. Pen hung
  back in the shadows until her father should get away. Off to the left where
  the white beach curved beautifully out to the point she saw Counsell's little
  tent pitched in the sand with a fire burning before it, and the dark canoe
  drawn up. Off the end of the point the spidery lighthouse fixed her with the
  baleful glare of its red eye.</p>

  <p>Pendleton pushed off to his motor-boat with an amount of caution absurd
  under the circumstances, for as soon as he turned over the engine she
  exploded like a gun. This time there was no hesitation in the <i>Pee Bee</i>;
  she moved off at once with her usual violence, shattering the night. Pen,
  watching the tent saw Counsell come out and look in the direction of the
  sound. But presently he went back again.</p>

  <p>As soon as it was safe to do so, she picked her way out over the broken
  floor of the wharf. The piles were gnawed and broken, and the pushing of the
  ice during many seasons had given the whole structure a rakish cant towards
  the Bay. Pen dropped over the side into an inch or two of water and gingerly
  picked her way towards the tent.</p>

  <p>It was a little lean-to tent open to the fire in front, but with a
  mosquito curtain hanging down. He heard her splashing towards him and came
  out. He must have been sitting there looking at the fire and smoking. His
  pipe was still between his teeth. He stared at her as at a ghost without
  making a sound. His body had a tense look. She could not read his face
  because the moon was behind him. Its light was strong in her face.</p>

  <p>"It is I, Miss Broome," she said in her direct way.</p>

  <p>He seemed to come to life. "You!" he cried in a voice of delight. He
  laughed shakily. "I thought...how foolish of me...I was thinking of you...I
  thought..." He seemed unable to go on.</p>

  <p>"I came through the water to avoid making tracks in the sand."</p>

  <p>"I understand!" he said eagerly. "I'll carry you ashore."</p>

  <p>Pen stamped her foot in the water. "You don't understand! Stay where you
  are and I'll tell you!"</p>

  <p>"There's nothing wrong is there?" he asked anxiously. "I heard the
  motor-boat start off."</p>

  <p>"Wrong enough," said Pen simply. Since nothing was to be gained by beating
  around the bush, she blurted out the truth. "Collis Dongan has been found
  shot dead in his rooms, and you are accused of having done it."</p>

  <p>"What!" he cried with so perfect an expression of astonishment that Pen's
  breast was warmed and comforted. No guilty man could possibly have simulated
  that look. She had not doubted him, nevertheless it was sweet to be
  reassured. The tears sprang to her eyes; she hung her head to hide them. He
  did not notice them. He was dazed.</p>

  <p>"Collis Dongan dead!" he muttered. "When...How?"</p>

  <p>She told the main facts of the story slowly, distinctly as to a stupid
  person.</p>

  <p>"Good God! how terrible!" he muttered. "How quick can I get back to New
  York? It was suicide of course. He had cause enough."</p>

  <p>"What cause?" Pen asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"He had swindled and betrayed me," Counsell said bitterly. "And I found
  him out...But he's dead! I'm sorry now for the things I said to him!" His
  thoughts flew off at a tangent. "But how is it you came to tell me...and like
  this?" He was looking at her submerged feet.</p>

  <p>"My father feels it his duty to give you up," said Pen. "I gained a little
  time by making believe to be ill. He will be here later with other men."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all right," said Counsell. "It's all got to be sifted to the
  bottom of course. They can't have any case against me."</p>

  <p>"They have a complete case against you," said Pen. "And don't you see,
  they think you ran away." She gave him the points of the evidence against
  him.</p>

  <p>"That's bad," he said gravely. "My revolver, eh? I had lost it!...But you
  didn't believe it!" he cried warmly.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a man," said Pen simply.</p>

  <p>"Anyhow, it doesn't alter things," he said. "I've got to go back. They
  couldn't send an innocent man to the chair."</p>

  <p>Pen clasped her hands in a sort of despair. Another obstinate man to be
  argued with! "They could! They could!" she cried. "You don't understand. I
  couldn't bring the paper to you because it would have been missed. But you
  must read it later. Then you'll see. My father is just like other men. They
  all seem to act in a herd. They have made up their minds that you did it.
  They are determined you sha'n't escape. Your trial would be a mockery."</p>

  <p>He was impressed by her earnestness. "Just the same...I couldn't run," he
  said slowly.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't do anything on impulse," Pen urged. "You must read the
  newspaper and find out where you stand. You must give yourself up if you so
  decide, but not allow yourself to be caught."</p>

  <p>He seemed to be convinced, but he did not take the matter seriously enough
  to suit Pen. He seemed to be thinking more of her than of his own situation.
  He took a step nearer to her.</p>

  <p>"How fine of you to come to warn me!" he said warmly.</p>

  <p>Pen retreated into deeper water. "<i>Please!"</i> she said sharply. "There
  is not an instant to lose!"</p>

  <p>"But if I've got to go...I must thank you," he said.</p>

  <p>It was not part of Pen's plan to let him go, but not wishing to provoke
  another argument, she let the words pass for the moment.</p>

  <p>"Anyhow, come out of the water," he pleaded. "Your feet must be chilled
  through."</p>

  <p>He put down a paddle at the edge of the water and Pen stepped out on it.
  He looked at her longingly.</p>

  <p>"Hurry! Hurry!" Pen said.</p>

  <p>With a sigh he commenced to pull up the pegs that fastened down his
  tent.</p>

  <p>It was soon bundled into the canoe together with his grub-box, his valise,
  and the odds and ends of his baggage.</p>

  <p>"Get in," he said. "I'll paddle you back to the wharf."</p>

  <p>Pen sat down in the bottom of the canoe while he perched on the stern seat
  wielding the paddle with the easy grace of long custom. She watched him
  through her lashes. The moon was behind him, silhouetting his strong frame
  and making a sort of aureole about his bare head.</p>

  <p>The tide was high and the water had risen to within three feet of the
  floor of the wharf. Pen climbed out upon it.</p>

  <p>"Well, is this good-by?" he said dolefully,</p>

  <p>"No," said Pen breathlessly. Her instinct told her there was another
  struggle of wills ahead. "You're not going. I'm going to keep you here."</p>

  <p>"What!" he cried. "Oh, if you knew how you tempted me!"</p>

  <p>"Tempt you!" she said crossly. "This is no time for sentiment!"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't let you," he said firmly.</p>

  <p>"Where could you go?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I'll manage to keep out of sight."</p>

  <p>"There is no place you could go!" she insisted. "The <i>Sun</i>-paper is
  read on the remotest creeks. Do you realize what a hue and cry will be raised
  in the morning? Fifty boats will be out searching the river, the bay, the
  creeks. How could you hope to escape? Where would you get food and fresh
  water?"</p>

  <p>"I'll find a way," he said stubbornly. "I'm going back to New York."</p>

  <p>"Stay here!" she pleaded.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't! What would you think of a man who unloaded all his troubles
  on a woman like that?"</p>

  <p>"What would I think of him?" Pen was on her knees at the edge of the wharf
  reaching down for his things. The moonlight was in her face. She suddenly
  smiled at him in an oddly tender, an indulgent sort of way. "Don't be silly!"
  she said brusquely. "Hand me up that valise."</p>

  <p>The advantage was all with her now. His man's pride was hardly strong
  enough to tear him away from her. He passed up the valise.</p>

  <p>"I'll find some way to square the account," he grumbled.</p>

  <p>Pen smiled still.</p>

  <p>"What will we do with the canoe?" he asked, when their cargo was unloaded
  on the wharf.</p>

  <p>"Sink it in deep water at the end of the wharf," she said.</p>

  <p>"Good! I'll empty my clothes out and fill the valise with stones."</p>

  <p>"Such a good valise," objected the prudent Pen. "Couldn't you just load
  the stones in the canoe?"</p>

  <p>"No. She'd roll them out and come to the top. I can tie the valise to a
  thwart."</p>

  <p>How Pen loved to have him talk to her offhand as to another man!</p>

  <p>While he was attending to the canoe Pen busied herself dividing his
  belongings into two equal lots to carry up the hill. Her eyes ever glancing
  in the direction of the Island finally saw a tiny red and a green eye turn on
  them from afar.</p>

  <p>"They've started back," she said quietly. "We'll have to carry everything
  in one trip."</p>

  <p>"Oh, throw everything overboard that will sink."</p>

  <p>"You'll need it."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with me?"</p>

  <p>"Hide you in the woods."</p>

  <p>Presently the put-put of the noisy little boat came to them across the
  water.</p>

  <p>"No time to lose!"</p>

  <p>When Counsell came to her he coolly appropriated half her load. They
  wasted a good minute quarreling over it. Pen was not accustomed to having her
  will opposed by a man. Her undisputed sway at Broome's Point had made her a
  little too autocratic perhaps. A hot little flame of anger shot up in her
  breast. When she became angry Counsell laughed delightedly. This was
  outrageous. Nevertheless she liked it. She found a curious pleasure in giving
  in to him, and meekly accepted what he said she might carry. "What is
  happening to me?" she asked herself for the dozenth time that day.</p>

  <p>They plodded up the hill under their loads, Pen in advance. Their shadows
  marched before them. The whole earth was held in a spell of moonlight and the
  perfume of the wild grape. It sharpened their senses intolerably. Life seemed
  almost too much to be borne. Neither could speak. Once Counsell bending under
  the weight of his pack, mutely put his hand forward and groped for hers.</p>

  <p>"Don't! Don't!" she said painfully.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Pen!" he murmured.</p>

  <p>As they progressed along the top of the bank the motor-boat was completing
  her journey below them. They could glimpse the boat through the interstices
  of the bushes, but those in the boat could not have seen them.</p>

  <p>"We must hurry," said Pen. "They must see already that your tent is
  gone."</p>

  <p>Reaching the tenant cottage outside the grounds Pen said: "We could save
  time by cutting across here, but we'd leave a wide open track through the wet
  weeds. We'll have to go around."</p>

  <p>They followed the road to the broken gate, and making the turn, kept along
  outside the fence until they got well in the rear of the cottage. Here the
  faintly marked path worn by Pen crossed the road, and they turned into it.
  The motor-boat had come to her moorings. Breaking into a sort of staggering
  run under their burdens they were soon received into the woods.</p>

  <p>"I must get back to the house before they do," Pen panted.</p>

  <p>The glade with its tiny temple presented a scene of unearthly beauty. A
  shaft of moonlight was silvering the pale dome. The deep bowl below the bank
  was full to the brim of moonlight.</p>

  <p>A gasp of astonishment escaped Counsell. "What's this?"</p>

  <p>"Afraid of ghosts?" asked Pen.</p>

  <p>"Try me!" he laughed.</p>

  <p>They cast their burdens on the ground. There was no time for lengthy
  explanations or leave-takings.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" said Pen. "Pitch your tent among the bushes at the back of the
  tomb."</p>

  <p>"I'll rig it from the branches," he said. "Won't drive stakes."</p>

  <p>"Good! Keep back from the edge of the bank during the day. A small boat
  might come into the pond, looking for you. But no native will come near this
  spot. It's not safe to build a fire. What have you to eat?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty of bread, cooked meat, eggs."</p>

  <p>"When I come again I'll bring more. And a little oil stove. The water in
  the pond is not fit to drink, but you'll find a spring at the foot of the
  bank. Watch well before you show yourself in the open."</p>

  <p>"When will you come again?" he asked urgently.</p>

  <p>"When it is safe...To-morrow night I think."</p>

  <p>"The time will pass slowly until then," he said simply. He picked up her
  hand and pressed it hard to his cheek.</p>

  <p>Pen snatched away her hand and fled&mdash;fled from she knew not what.
  Trying to fly from the shattering commotion in her breast perhaps, which of
  course she carried with her.</p>

  <p>As she ducked through her own particular gap in the fence she could quite
  clearly hear the two men, coming up the road from the beach talking together
  in tones of chagrin. She sped to the house and upstairs to her room. Aunt
  Maria was asleep in a chair. Pea awakened her with a violent shake, and
  commenced to undress.</p>

  <p>"Quick! my night-dress!" she cried. "Throw these wet things into a closet.
  Remember to say you put me to bed as soon as Dad went out and we both fell
  asleep!"</p>

  <p>"Bless God, honey! Bless God!" repeated Aunt Maria. Nevertheless she
  bestirred herself.</p>

  <p>When the two men knocked on the door a sleepy voice bade them enter. All
  was peace within the room. Aunt Maria struggled to her feet assiduously
  knuckling her eyes; Pen lay in bed with the bedclothes to her chin, her eyes
  languourous as if but just opened.</p>

  <p>"You see," said Doctor Hance. "It is just as I told you. Everything is all
  right."</p>

  <p>Pendleton's feelings were mixed. He was relieved, and as soon as he was
  relieved he remembered his suspicions. In order to divert attention from Aunt
  Maria whose delineation of sleepiness was rather melodramatic, Pen smiled at
  her father and murmured that she felt better.</p>

  <p>He looked at her queerly. He could no longer contain his chagrin. "He's
  gone!" he said.</p>

  <p>Pen, aware that the doctor was keenly observing her, made her eyes wide.
  "Gone?" she echoed. "Where?"</p>

  <p>"Pushed off in his canoe somewhere."</p>

  <p>"We'll get him in the morning," the doctor added, watching her still. "He
  can't get far."</p>

  <p>Pen made her face an indifferent blank.</p>

  <p>Pendleton was sent out of the room while the doctor made his examination.
  Hance was a frowsy old man with a rough tongue and a compassionate irascible
  eye. Everybody quarreled with him and depended on him as on a tower. He had
  no illusions left about mankind, but he gave all his strength to tending
  them. Pen dreaded being left alone with him. However he said no more about
  the escaped canoeist. From the character of his grunts as he sounded her she
  knew she had not deceived him at all. When the door closed behind him she
  flew to it to hear what he would say to her father.</p>

  <p>Pendleton was just outside the door. "Well?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"She's all right," was the gruff reply. "A bit of a shock maybe. No
  organic trouble."</p>

  <p>"Hum," said Pendleton, and his thoughts immediately flew off to the other
  matter. "That engine of mine makes such a confounded racket! He must have
  heard me start off and guessed that I was on to him and had gone for
  help."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," said Dr. Hance with a grim chuckle.</p>

  <p>They passed downstairs.</p>

  <p>Pen thought with a thankful heart: "He's not going to give me away!
  Blessed old man!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="III"
     id="III"></a>III. &mdash; An Irruption From The World</h2>

  <p class="first">At all times Pen was an early riser but next morning she was
  up with the sun. While she was dressing, her collie Dougall set up a great
  barking in the back yard. At night he was kept fastened in his kennel there
  to keep watch that no fox or 'possum came after the poultry. Pen knew that it
  could not be one of those marauders now because it was broad day and there
  was no alarm amongst the chickens. So she paid no attention. Doug like the
  best of dogs, sometimes raised a false alarm.</p>

  <p>Night was too far away to wait for. Secure in the feeling of their
  solitude Pen planned to carry Don Counsell what he needed and get back to the
  house before anyone stirred. Her father arose like clockwork at six and Aunt
  Maria turned up in the kitchen yawning about that hour, or later. It was a
  queer thing to visit a man at five o'clock in the morning&mdash;but for
  humanity's sake! He would be asleep in his tent and would never know she had
  been there until he awoke and found what she had left. Pen's heart gave a
  queer little jump at the thought of being able to look at him sleeping
  without any necessity of veiling her eyes.</p>

  <p>She billowed softly down the great stairway&mdash;it was a treat to stand
  at the bottom and see Pen come down with her toes pointing&mdash;and
  scampered into the pantry. From a high shelf she got down an old primus stove
  which had not been used in a long time, and cleaned it and filled it with
  oil. Then she made up a basket of bread, butter, cream, eggs, strawberries,
  etc., and started out of the house.</p>

  <p>Some instinct of caution impelled her to put her things down on a chest in
  the hall, while she gave a preliminary peep out of doors. She was greatly
  taken aback to discover another young gentleman of the world sitting on the
  porch playing with one of her innumerable kittens. He sprang up, and
  snatching off his cap, bade her good morning.</p>

  <p>Pen could only stare and stammer. "Why...who...how." Finally she managed
  to blurt out: "Where did you come from?"</p>

  <p>His air was ingratiating&mdash;a shade too ingratiating perhaps. "Rowed
  over from the Island," he explained. "I arrived there about three and had a
  snooze on the seat of my car. As soon as it began to get light I hunted about
  until I found a skiff with oars in it, and came on over. I suppose there'll
  be a row when the owner finds it gone, but I'll square myself with him later.
  I knew your house by the cupola."</p>

  <p>Pen lacked a key to all this. She looked her further questions.</p>

  <p>"I'm on the &mdash; newspaper," he went on cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"Claude Danner is my name. Last night somebody telephoned from the Island
  that Don Counsell had been here all day yesterday, so I got a car at once and
  started. Lost my way a couple of times. I aimed to come here direct by road,
  but the hills in the woods were washed so badly I had to turn around and go
  to the Island."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Counsell has gone," said Pen. "You have had your journey for
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"Not at all!" he said with his assured and agreeable smile. "It's your
  story that I came after."</p>

  <p>Pen looked at him with a kind of horror. This possibility had not occurred
  to her. She withdrew into herself. "I have no story to tell," she said
  coldly.</p>

  <p>He was not at all abashed. "My paper was the only one got the tip last
  night, and I've got to get my story over the phone in time for the evening
  edition. You have a phone here I see. The wires were the first things I
  looked for. It'll be a rare scoop. There'll be a mob down later."</p>

  <p>Pen shivered inwardly and looked down. She was much confused, things were
  so different from what one imagined. Only last night she had said to herself:
  "If I could get hold of the men who write for newspapers I'd make them be
  fair to Don." (She already called him Don in her thoughts.) Well here was her
  chance, but the brash young Danner antagonized her so she could scarcely be
  civil to him. She struggled with her feelings.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to excuse me. I don't consider that the public has any
  interest in me...or any right to intrude upon my privacy! I hate to read that
  sort of story in the newspapers...But of course that's not your fault...I'm
  willing to answer any proper questions, but I must not be quoted. There must
  be no descriptions of me or of my home!"</p>

  <p>The young man's face fell. "But I've got to tell my story," he protested.
  "It'll be the scoop of the year. If I don't tell all about you the others
  will. I can appreciate your feelings, but the others are hard-boiled guys I
  assure you. But you'll like what I write about you when you see it. Everybody
  does."</p>

  <p>Pen smiled wryly. "I don't know...You'll have breakfast with us?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no!" he said.</p>

  <p>"You must. There's no place else for you to go. And you've been up all
  night."</p>

  <p>He saw that she did not like him, and he appreciated her invincible
  hospitality. "Say, I wish I wasn't here on a story!" he said impulsively.</p>

  <p>"So do I," said Pen. "I must ask you to wait here until I get things
  started in the house."</p>

  <p>"But my story?"</p>

  <p>"I'll be back shortly."</p>

  <p>Pen went in and put away the things in her basket with a heavy heart. No
  chance now of seeing Don until night. All day he would be watching for her.
  In the course of time Aunt Maria turned up and breakfast was set in
  train.</p>

  <p>The "interview" that followed was hardly a success. So few of Danner's
  questions came under the head of what Pen called "proper" questions. And the
  way he kept sizing her up out of the corners of his eyes made her stiffer and
  stiffer. She wished not to be stiff; she wished to win Danner to Don's side.
  But she soon discovered that it was hopeless; that the young reporter's sole
  business was to cater to the public taste. The sly look that appeared in
  Danner's eyes when she casually expressed a doubt of Don's guilt soon put her
  off that line. Meanwhile she was suffering horribly at the thought of having
  their poverty exposed in the newspapers. Obviously Danner missed nothing; the
  rotting porch, the patched screens, that ridiculous barricade around her
  sprouting dahlias.</p>

  <p>Pendleton Broome presently came downstairs and Danner got along much
  better with him. The reporter knew just how to set up the little man in his
  own esteem. Pendleton admired the newspapers and his greatest pleasure was to
  see his name in print. So far he had only won to the correspondence columns.
  Pendleton encouraged, adopted a throaty voice and a magisterial air that
  caused poor Pen to squirm afresh, thinking of the fun the clever young man
  could have with her father.</p>

  <p>During breakfast Pen was obliged to hear the story of the previous day's
  happenings told and retold with much irrelevant detail. Danner exerted
  himself to please her; he was not a bad sort of fellow; but Pen thinking of
  the other breakfasting on cold victuals and water, resented every swallow of
  hot coffee that he took.</p>

  <p>"When I first read the story in the paper," thus Pendleton, "the fellow
  was still in the house. He was talking to my daughter in the
  drawing-room&mdash;a very gentlemanly, attractive sort of fellow you
  understand..."</p>

  <p>"So I understand," said Danner, glancing sidelong at Pen.</p>

  <p>"But there was something In his eye...!"</p>

  <p>Pen could not stand for this. "Why, father," she protested with as
  good-natured and offhand a smile as she could muster, "be fair! You never
  discovered that 'something' until you read the paper."</p>

  <p>"You are wrong, my dear. From the first I was aware of a curious prejudice
  against him. But of course I could not let it show while he was our
  guest."</p>

  <p>Pen smiling at whatever cost, let it go.</p>

  <p>"Where was I?" asked Pendleton.</p>

  <p>Danner prompted: "He was in the drawing-room."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes! For the moment I was at a loss. Frightfully awkward situation. By
  the time I had resolved on a course of action he had left the house
  <i>without bidding me good-night!"</i></p>

  <p>"Without bidding you good-night!" echoed Danner.</p>

  <p>"Without bidding me good-night!"</p>

  <p>Danner turned to Pen. "Why do you suppose he didn't say good-night to your
  father?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Pen carelessly. "I suppose he forgot."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he had a glimpse of the newspaper?</p>

  <p>"He couldn't see my father from where he was."</p>

  <p>"Did he seem agitated?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least."</p>

  <p>"What did you do then?" Danner asked Pendleton.</p>

  <p>"My first plan was to get the lighthouse keeper to help me apprehend the
  fellow. But as I was setting out from the house my daughter had a sudden
  attack..."</p>

  <p>Danner had the grace not to look at Pen, but she was aware of his sharp
  spring to attention.</p>

  <p>"And as I was obliged to go to the Island for the doctor I decided to let
  him help me. But when we got back the fellow had struck his tent and pushed
  off."</p>

  <p>"That taken in connection with his failure to bid you good-night..."
  suggested Danner.</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" said Pendleton.</p>

  <p>Pen felt she would scream. If she were obliged to listen to any more of
  this. Making believe to discover an errand in the kitchen, she left the
  room.</p>

  <p>When she came back Danner asked with hypocritical solicitude: "Are you
  quite well again this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," said Pen.</p>

  <p>Useless to expect anything from Danner. Though he was clearly sensible to
  Pen's charm, the story was everything to him, and his nostrils were quivering
  now on the scent of a story much more dramatic than he had expected.</p>

  <p>Pendleton went on: "Doctor Hance is coming back in a motor-boat this
  morning, and we will search the bay shore...We have an idea of the direction
  he took," he added mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"Wish you luck," said Danner. "We had a message from New York last night
  that a reward of five thousand dollars had been offered for Counsell's
  capture."</p>

  <p>He looked at Pen as he said it. She kept her eyes down, and rested her
  hands on the edge of the table that they might not shake.</p>

  <p>"What!" cried Pendleton. "Well!...that let's me out then. No business for
  a gentleman, of course."</p>

  <p>Pen's sore heart warmed gratefully towards her father.</p>

  <p>"Who offers the reward?" Pen asked quietly, (Poor Pen! She suspected that
  her parade of indifference would never deceive the sharp-eyed reporter. What
  she ought to have shown was a frank, natural interest in the matter. But that
  was beyond her powers of dissimulation.)</p>

  <p>"Ernest Riever, the well-known millionaire," said Danner. "An intimate
  friend of the murdered man, I believe."</p>

  <p>When they finished breakfast several motor-boats were seen coming across
  from the Island. Danner made haste to get his story over the phone. This was
  an ordeal for Pen. The connection was bad, and Danner had to shout his "human
  interest" stuff at the top of his lungs. Pen went to her room and shut the
  door, and buried her head in the pillows. Still she could hear the horrible
  sentences that outraged every feeling of privacy she had. After that she gave
  up all pretense of trying to be agreeable to Danner.</p>

  <p>The first comers from the Island were volunteer searchers. News of the
  reward had been telephoned down from Baltimore. They came to Broome's Point
  with the instinct of picking up the trail where it started, forgetting that
  water holds no tracks. One spot around the shores was as good as another to
  begin the search. Dr. Hance was not among them. Possibly the reward had put
  him off too. Others who had not the initiative to institute a search, merely
  came to hang around and stare and ask foolish questions. A little later
  Captain Spinney brought over a whole party of reporters from Washington,
  Baltimore and Philadelphia. These gentlemen undertook to interview Pen in a
  body. She liked them less than young Danner. She referred them to her father,
  and fled to her room.</p>

  <p>Pendleton, enthroned on the porch, the center of interest for the crowd,
  was in his element. He graciously accepted the reporters' excellent cigars,
  and little by little, without realizing it, embroidered on his tale. In an
  expansive moment he asked them to lunch en masse, and then in terror went to
  Pen to tell her what he had done.</p>

  <p>She merely nodded. "There's enough for one meal. But we'll run short at
  supper."</p>

  <p>She gave the necessary orders for the meal, but declined to appear
  herself. Not until she knew the men were all gathered around the table did
  she venture to come down the back stairs and see to some of the things that
  had been left undone that distracted morning. Then she shut herself up
  again.</p>

  <p>During the afternoon an automobile with a broken spring managed to win
  through by the road. It brought a load of New York reporters. These in asking
  their way had spread the news along the Neck, and the poor whites who lived
  there hidden in the woods began to straggle in in ox-carts, to share in the
  excitement.</p>

  <p>Reporters made themselves at home all over the lower floor of the big
  house, even in the kitchen where they chaffed Aunt Maria and questioned her
  adroitly. This was a source of great uneasiness to Pen. She was divided
  between anxiety and indignation. There was something old English in Pen. Thus
  to have her castle invaded was the greatest outrage she could conceive of.
  But what could she do? She experienced a sickening loss of identity.</p>

  <p>She could not stay in her room all the time. Whenever she went downstairs
  it was to be waylaid by one or half a dozen inquisitors who according to
  their natures tried to cajole her or to entrap her into answering their
  questions. Meanwhile the natives pressed their faces against the windows and
  stared in. Finally Pen sought her father.</p>

  <p>"How long have I got to submit to this?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"To what, my dear?" he asked, sparring for time.</p>

  <p>"To having my house overrun by strangers!"</p>

  <p>"Patience, my child. They're not doing any real harm."</p>

  <p>"But our house, <i>our</i> house? Have we no rights in it?"</p>

  <p>"I know, I know. But what can I do?"</p>

  <p>"Request them to leave. They can at least wait outside the fence."</p>

  <p>"But my dear!" said Pendleton aghast. "We've got to stand in well with the
  Press. Suppose they were to give the impression in their stories that we were
  concealing this fellow!" This was accompanied by his furtive glance of
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>Pen thought in dismay: "One of them has put that idea into his head!" She
  said no more, but marched indignantly back to her room.</p>

  <p>Worse trials were in store for her. About five, from her window she saw a
  new party of men come in by the drive. Even at the distance she could see
  that they differed subtly from the reporters, stupider looking men who
  carried themselves with the arrogance of conscious rectitude. After awhile
  Aunt Maria came to the door of her room, the whites of her eyes showing.
  "Miss Penny, honey," she gasped. "Yo' Paw say, please to come
  downstairs."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter. Aunt Maria?"</p>

  <p>"Detecatifs, honey!" said Aunt Maria in an awestruck whisper. "Detecatifs
  fum Noo Yawk!"</p>

  <p>Without bestirring herself at all, Pen changed her dress and went slowly
  downstairs. As soon as she entered the drawing-room she regretted her
  dilatoriness, for they already had Aunt Maria on the carpet, and the old
  negress was sweating in agitation. Pen instantly conceived a violent dislike
  of her inquisitor. He was a bull-necked, ageing man with pendulous cheeks and
  dull, irascible blue eyes. He lolled in a chair by the window, with an arm
  over the back, and his fingers interlaced. He nodded to Pen and curtly
  requested her to be seated.</p>

  <p>Pen flared up inwardly. ("Asking me to sit down in my own house!") In
  order to show that she was still mistress there, she moved calmly about the
  room, setting things in order. They had presumed to shove her center table
  over to the fireplace to give themselves room. She shoved it back. The chief
  with an annoyed glance resumed his questioning of the scared negress.</p>

  <p>The room was full of people. There were four lesser officers grouped
  around the chief's chair. The reporters were gathered in a group under the
  arch that led to the back drawing-room. Pen soon learned that there was an
  excellent working agreement between these two parties, the reporters
  dependent on the detectives for news, and the detectives dependent on the
  reporters for public recognition of their efforts. Over by the other front
  window sat Pendleton, leaning back in an old swivel chair, trying to appear
  at his ease.</p>

  <p>Aunt Maria was saying: "Soon as Mist' Pendleton go out Ah undress Miss
  Penny and put her in baid. She done drap right off lak a kitten."</p>

  <p>"Then what did you do?" the man asked in the rasping voice inquisitors
  affect.</p>

  <p>"Me? Ah didn't do nuffin, suh. Ah jes sot."</p>

  <p>"Did you go to sleep too?"</p>

  <p>"Ah reckon Ah did."</p>

  <p>"How long did you sleep?"</p>

  <p>"'Deed I caint tell. I aint know nuffin else till Miss Penny wake me up
  again."</p>

  <p>"So she woke you up?"</p>

  <p>Aunt Maria perceived that she had made a slip. "Yessuh! Yessuh!" she
  stammered. "Miss Penny done want a drink of watah."</p>

  <p>"How did she wake you?"</p>

  <p>Again Aunt Maria's tongue slipped. "She done shook mah ahm."</p>

  <p>"So she was out of bed?"</p>

  <p>"No suh! No suh!" cried Aunt Maria in a panic. "I misrecollect that. She
  jes hollered at me."</p>

  <p>It would have been patent to a child that Aunt Maria was lying. The scene
  was intolerable to Pen's pride.</p>

  <p>"Aunt Maria, tell the truth," she said sharply.</p>

  <p>The poor old negress turned a face of complete dismay to her mistress.
  What was she to make of this? In her confusion she was unable to get anything
  else out.</p>

  <p>To Pen the chief detective said harshly: "Please be silent, Miss. You will
  have a chance to tell your story in a minute."</p>

  <p>Pen's eyes blazed. "You are not to suppose that you are entrapping me or
  my servant!" she said hotly. "I have no objection to your knowing that I went
  down to the beach last night and warned Mr. Counsell that he was liable to
  arrest!"</p>

  <p>It had the effect of a bombshell there in the room. For a second all the
  men stared at Pen open-mouthed. Then of one accord the reporters made a rush
  out into the hall where the telephone was. He who first laid hand on it was
  allowed to get his call in first. Pen was too angry now to be terrified by
  further publicity. Their precipitancy merely disgusted her. Was there no such
  thing as human dignity?</p>

  <p>Pendleton Broome's swivel chair had come forward with a snap. He looked
  clownish. He was the only one really surprised by Pen's disclosure. What
  astonished the others was that she should have admitted it. For a fleeting
  instant Pen felt sorry for the little man, but she had too much on her mind
  for the feeling to linger. The detective was not surprised, but he had
  counted on dragging out the admission, and it annoyed him excessively to have
  it flung in his face. He affected to be consulting with his subordinates
  while he recovered himself.</p>

  <p>"You had better question me," Pen said. "Aunt Maria knows nothing
  more."</p>

  <p>"Allow me to be the judge of that," he said sarcastically.</p>

  <p>Pen shrugged. He went on questioning the negress, but she was reduced to a
  gibbering state. In the end he had to let her go. Aunt Maria hung in the
  hall, just around the corner of the door, listening with stretched ears. The
  reporters straggled back into the room.</p>

  <p>Pen and the detective faced each other. The man cleared his throat and
  settled his collar, gave attention to his finger nails, and glanced
  carelessly out of the window&mdash;all time-honored devices to break up the
  composure of one's opponent. Pen merely looked at him. Suddenly he rasped at
  her:</p>

  <p>"So you assisted this murderer to escape?"</p>

  <p>"Don't speak to me like that," said Pen quietly, with heightened color.
  "He is not yet proved a murderer." Meanwhile her inner voice was saying
  despairingly: "You should not antagonize him! You should not antagonize him!"
  But it was impossible for her to act otherwise towards this great, stupid
  bully.</p>

  <p>He smiled disagreeably; nevertheless he modified his tone. "What did you
  do it for?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He had had dinner and supper with us," said Pen. "I differed with my
  father as to its being our duty to inform against him."</p>

  <p>"Where did he go from here?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"What! It was a bright moonlight night. Didn't you have interest enough to
  watch which way he went after having warned him?"</p>

  <p>"He paddled straight out from the shore. I didn't wait. The motor-boat was
  coming back."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't they see your tracks in the sand?"</p>

  <p>"I walked at the edge of the water."</p>

  <p>"What did you want to deceive your father for?"</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said Pen with her chin up. "That is between my father
  and me."</p>

  <p>The detective abandoned this line of questioning. "Didn't Counsell tell
  you where he was going?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Didn't you talk down on the beach?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"What about?"</p>

  <p>"I had to tell him what was in the newspaper."</p>

  <p>"Didn't he know already?"</p>

  <p>"He did not."</p>

  <p>The detective looked around at his subordinates with a leer, and they all
  laughed. Instead of disconcerting Pen it had the effect of stiffening her.
  She looked at one after another so steadily that their eyes suddenly found
  business elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The chief said suddenly with the air of one springing a disagreeable
  surprise: "Had you ever seen Counsell before yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"Never," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure of that?"</p>

  <p>Pen merely looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Answer my question, please!"</p>

  <p>"I have already answered it."</p>

  <p>"Do you expect me to believe that you undertook to save a total stranger
  from the law?"</p>

  <p>"I have stated the facts."</p>

  <p>The detective sprang to his feet and shook a violent forefinger at
  Pen&mdash;the old trick of the inquisitor. "You have seen this man
  before!"</p>

  <p>"Don't shout at me," said Pen coolly. "I am not a criminal."</p>

  <p>"As to that we'll see," he said ominously. "Did you ever hear of accessory
  after the fact."</p>

  <p>"Well, if I am a criminal," said Pen, "I don't have to testify against
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Don't argue with me if you please," he said. "Just answer my
  questions."</p>

  <p>"Answer me a question if you please," said Pen clearly.</p>

  <p>He stared. He was not accustomed to having the tables turned like
  this.</p>

  <p>Before he could explode Pen asked her question: "You are from New York,
  aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"What of it?"</p>

  <p>"What are your rights in Maryland?"</p>

  <p>His face turned ugly. "You'll see!" He addressed one of his men. "Keesing,
  you have heard this young woman's admissions. There's a justice of the peace
  over on the Island. Go to him and make the necessary affidavit to secure a
  warrant for her arrest."</p>

  <p>The man left the room. Pen believed this to be a bluff, and scornfully
  smiled. Her father was impressed though. He wilted down in his chair, and put
  out an imploring hand towards his daughter. He was incapable of speaking.</p>

  <p>"Do you want anything else of me?" Pen coolly asked her questioner.</p>

  <p>Seeing that his threat had failed of effect, the detective judged it
  prudent not to prolong this scene. "That is all for the present," he said
  loftily. "You will please not leave the house."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Pen, "but until I am arrested I shall do just what I am
  accustomed to do."</p>

  <p>She left the room with her head up and went on up the stairs. She was not
  at all pleased with herself though. That inner voice said remorselessly: "You
  have only angered him without doing Don any good." To be sure, she had seen
  sympathy in the eyes of some of the reporters, but they could not say
  anything of course that might endanger their working agreement with the
  detectives. At the thought of danger to herself Pen smiled. She was in the
  frame of mind that welcomes persecution. But her heart was full of terror for
  Don. She had not foreseen that the place would be overrun like this. He was
  so near! And the detective's order to remain in the house suggested that they
  suspected he might still be on the place.</p>

  <p>On her knees at her front window she watched the men leave the house in a
  body. Some shrubbery cut off her view of the gate, and she could not tell
  which way they turned after passing through it. Fortunately but an hour or
  two of daylight remained.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="IV"
     id="IV"></a>IV. &mdash; BESIDE THE LITTLE TEMPLE</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Pen was sure that the house was emptied of strangers
  she went downstairs to see about the belated supper. She was mad with anxiety
  to know what was happening outside, but whatever comes, people must eat.
  Everything in the kitchen was at sixes and sevens of course, and Aunt Maria
  nowhere to be seen.</p>

  <p>The old negress presently waddled in panting. She was both terrified and
  delighted by the gale of excitement that had suddenly blown upon the settled
  peace of Broome's Point. In order to divert her mistress' wrath, she made
  haste to give Pen the latest news from out-of-doors. It appeared that the
  detectives and the reporters had jointly hired the empty tenant cottage
  outside the gate, and were busy establishing themselves there. They had sent
  over to the island for supplies, and for all the cots and bedding available.
  They had hired a white woman from up the Neck to cook for them.</p>

  <p>"Huh!" said Aunt Maria scornfully. "All Mis' Hat Dawkins evah cook is fat
  back and cawn pone!"</p>

  <p>Pen breathed more freely.</p>

  <p>Pen and her father supped alone together. The events of half a lifetime
  seemed to have occurred since the last time they had sat down without
  guests.</p>

  <p>That was breakfast the day before. By now every vestige of Pendleton's
  self-important air was gone. The situation had become too big for him. He was
  too much overcome even to blame Pen for anything that had happened. As always
  when things became difficult he depended like a child on Pen's superior
  strength. He had to blame something so he railed ceaselessly against the evil
  chance that had brought Counsell to their door.</p>

  <p>Pen, busy with her own thoughts let him run on. Her brain was clicking
  like a well-oiled piece of machinery. Like a brave fighter she had to count
  up all the chances against her. How was she going to get out of the house
  that night, and how reach Don when their enemies were camped squarely beside
  her path? How could she guide him to a safer hiding-place, and yet leave the
  way open to carry him what he needed from time to time? How could she get him
  away from that dangerous neighborhood altogether? But perhaps after all
  Broome's Point was the safest place in the world for him. But if he stayed
  near what prodigies of courage, of astuteness, of resourcefulness would be
  demanded from her! Not for an instant would she be able to relax. Nerved as
  she was it was a prospect to make her tremble.</p>

  <p>Pen enjoyed one great advantage in knowing every foot of ground around the
  place. The daily hunt for her vagrant turkeys, as well as the search every
  Spring for their nests, had taught her that. She knew she could find her way
  on the darkest night, but she was a good deal troubled by the natives
  wandering around the place. A party of them had built a fire over in the
  northeast corner of the grounds as if they intended to bivouac there. The
  darker the night the better for her. She watched the sky anxiously. It was
  quite heavily overcast, but with the moon at the full there would be a good
  deal of diffused light just the same.</p>

  <p>Another danger was that her dog Dougall might betray her. She got around
  that by instructing Thedo' to shut him up in the barn. She had a convenient
  reason for doing so in that Doug had not been at all hospitable to the
  strangers during the day. "He might hurt somebody," Pen said.</p>

  <p>The hours after supper were very hard for Pen to put in. Her plans were
  complete now, but she needed darkness and quiet to put them into motion.
  Somebody had brought their mail over from the Island, and Pendleton was
  absorbed in the latest accounts of the Counsell case. There was nothing about
  Broome's Point as yet save the bare announcement that Counsell had turned up
  there in a canoe. Pen was obliged to read the paper too, though it nauseated
  her. This day's story contained nothing of especial significance. There was
  an interview with Ernest Riever the millionaire who had put up the reward for
  Counsell's capture. Pen determined to ask Don about him.</p>

  <p>Towards dark one of the detectives without so much as by your leave, came
  and took up his station in a chair on the front porch. Pen hearing him
  slapping at the mosquitoes out there, smiled dryly to herself. She went out
  into the dark kitchen and found as she expected, that there was another man
  on the kitchen porch. This relieved her mind. Much better to know where the
  watchers were than to have them concealed about the grounds. Pen had her own
  way of getting out of the house.</p>

  <p>She could not get her father started to bed until she first made believe
  to go herself. She lay down on the outside of her bed fully clothed. When,
  after an age-long wait, she heard the sound of his snores from across the
  hall, she rose again and flitted noiselessly downstairs. For the past hour
  she had heard no sound from outside. She was accustomed to moving around the
  house in the dark, and she already had everything she wanted to carry with
  her placed handy to her hand. Wrapping each article separately in newspaper
  she put them all in a jute bag. Then satisfying herself that the watchers
  were still on the front and the back porch, she made her way down cellar.
  There was a possibility that there might be other men stationed out in the
  grounds, but she had to chance that.</p>

  <p>On the north side of the house under the kitchen the cellar communicated
  with the outside by half a dozen steps and inclined doors in the old style.
  The milk was brought in this way and the doors were always open. A clump of
  bushes outside accounted for the fact that the opening had not yet been
  discovered. This was the blind side of the house.</p>

  <p>For a moment Pen lingered behind the bushes listening, then came out. All
  along the northern side of the grounds ran a wind-break of arbor-vitae. There
  was a gap in it, torn by the winter gales. Pen made for that. She neither ran
  nor crouched. While she wanted to escape observation, if she were seen, she
  wished to know of it. The fatal thing would be to unwittingly lead someone to
  Don's hiding-place.</p>

  <p>She passed through the gap and hid herself on the other side to make sure
  she was not followed. Nobody came through.</p>

  <p>She then had to make a long detour around the house grounds, across the
  old paddock and the stable yard in the rear, across the road which led up the
  Neck and thence via a small triangular field into the woods. Within shadow of
  the woods she waited again to make sure she was not followed across the
  field. Nothing stirred behind her. She could see pretty well.</p>

  <p>There was no path through this part of the woods, and it was a matter of
  infinite difficulty to make her way through the underbrush and the thorny
  creepers without betraying herself. She forced patience on herself and
  proceeded foot by foot. The distance was not far and she laid a true course.
  She came out on her own path in the woods. Her heart began to beat in her
  throat. A hundred paces further lay the little temple.</p>

  <p>He heard her coming and appeared ducking under his mosquito curtain. His
  arms went out to her involuntarily. Pen fearful of some outburst made a
  warning sound:</p>

  <p>"Shh!"</p>

  <p>That unthinking gesture of his melted her completely. How natural to have
  flung herself into his arms. All her carefully built-up strength seemed to
  run away like water. She fought against it desperately. Not for an instant
  could she afford to relax. She must think and be strong for both of them. She
  turned aside from his begging arms.</p>

  <p>"I was delayed," she whispered faintly. "Much has happened."</p>

  <p>"What does it matter?" he said warmly. "You're here! This is the longest
  day I've ever lived through. You told me you wouldn't be here till night, but
  I couldn't help expecting you. Every time a leaf stirred I thought it was
  you!" He sought to draw her to him.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't!" whispered Pen sharply. "We're surrounded by danger. We must
  plan. This place is no longer safe. You must listen to me. Listen
  carefully."</p>

  <p>His arms dropped to his sides. Pen hurriedly began to tell her story.</p>

  <p>He interrupted her.</p>

  <p>"Come inside. The mosquitoes are too bad."</p>

  <p>She hung back a little. Could she withstand him in the close intimacy of
  his little tent? She must! Steeling her breast she followed him in.</p>

  <p>They sat side by side on the ground, nursing their knees and looking out
  through the mosquito curtain at the little temple outlined against the pale
  sky. Their shoulders pressed warmly together. That contact deprived Pen of
  the power of thinking, and she moved away a little. That hurt him; she knew
  it by the hang of his head. But she went doggedly ahead with her story.</p>

  <p>When she came to the end Don said bitterly: "Well I've had plenty of time
  to-day to think things over. There's only one course open to me. I've got to
  give myself up."</p>

  <p>Pen had expected this. "Wait!" she said urgently. "We must talk things
  over. You must read the papers I brought you before you make up your mind.
  You don't know yet what you're up against. I don't understand what makes the
  newspapers so bitter. Everybody who reads the stories is roused to a sort of
  craze to hunt you down. What sort of a trial would you get? Why they were
  even ready to arrest me because I took your part!"</p>

  <p>Don was wildly indignant. "You have to go through such things while I sit
  here in safety!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"That was nothing," said Pen. "He didn't mean it really."</p>

  <p>"I can't stand it!" cried Don. "You don't know what I'm going through.
  Sitting here idle thinking about these things. I'd go out of my mind!"</p>

  <p>"I do know what you're going through," murmured Pen.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I did get away," he went on. "Would my life be worth saving with
  this accusation hanging over me? What sort of a life would I lead?"</p>

  <p>"But the truth must come to light!" insisted Pen. "We will bring it to
  light."</p>

  <p>"How can I fight for myself tied hand and foot like this?"</p>

  <p>"You could use me," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"That's just it!" he said bitterly. "I couldn't!"</p>

  <p>"You haven't much of an opinion of women, have you?"</p>

  <p>"You don't understand me. I don't doubt but you're a whole lot cleverer
  than I. But I have my pride. What would you think of a man who..." He ended
  with a shrug.</p>

  <p>"We just argue round in a circle," said Pen dejectedly.</p>

  <p>"So it seems."</p>

  <p>"It's a waste of time," she said more firmly. "Let us talk things over
  first and find out where we're at. Your first thought was that it was a case
  of suicide."</p>

  <p>"I've changed my mind," he said. "Dongan hadn't the nerve. He was the sort
  of man to cling to life. Besides the loss of seventy-five thousand wasn't a
  knock-out blow to him. He could have raised the money."</p>

  <p>"Then it was murder," said Pen. "That agrees with the doctor's evidence.
  Who do you think killed him?"</p>

  <p>"I swear I don't know," said Don helplessly. "I've been beating my brains
  all day without being able to hit out an idea. His life was as open as
  daylight."</p>

  <p>"You knew him well?"</p>

  <p>"About as well as one man can know another. We came of the same lot you
  see; old New York families that had been acquainted for three or four
  generations. Lord! we were too close for my comfort sometimes. He was one of
  these men with no reticence. His confidences were embarrassing. He was alone
  in the world, and he had a horror of his own company, see? Very often I was
  hard put to it to get away about my own concerns."</p>

  <p>"But you were much attached to him?"</p>

  <p>"Frankly, no!" said Don. "He was the sort of man you just take as a matter
  of course. Perfectly well-meaning, but a bit of a bore. No salt in him. I
  would never have gone in with him if I'd realized."</p>

  <p>"The newspaper said he was your benefactor."</p>

  <p>"Not exactly," said Don dryly. "When I came out of college I was at a
  loose end. I'm the last of my lot, you know. Not a near relation in the
  world. It's true Dongan offered me a partnership, but it was not altogether
  philanthropy. I had twenty-five thousand to put in. He had his seat on
  'change and he needed the capital."</p>

  <p>"You said he swindled you."</p>

  <p>"It was his first crooked deal I'm sure. Even now I can't understand it.
  He must have been possessed!"</p>

  <p>"How did it come out?"</p>

  <p>"Friday night we had dinner together. Lord! it seems like a year ago
  instead of five days...And now the earth is over him!" Don shuddered.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't think of that," said Pen quickly.</p>

  <p>"You're right!...He had something on his mind. Said he wanted to talk to
  me. So I went up to his rooms afterward. There he blurted out that he was
  long on Union Central. The stock had broken thirteen points that day. He was
  seventy-five thousand in the hole. Hadn't a sou, he said. Evidently he'd been
  bucking the market for some time. Well, that was bad enough, but he actually
  had the cheek to suggest that I take the debt on my shoulders. I was young,
  he said, I could live it down, whereas it would ruin him. In the end it came
  out that he had already entered the transactions in my name in our private
  ledger, knowing that I never looked in the book. That made me see red. Such
  treachery! I blew up. I withdrew from the firm on the spot. Told him he could
  have my twenty-five thousand until he was on his feet, and he could borrow
  the rest from his wealthy friends."</p>

  <p>"What did you do next?" asked Pen.</p>

  <p>"I was so blazing mad I scarcely knew what I was doing. My one idea was to
  get shut of the whole boiling. Rotten game the Street; I was fed up with it
  anyhow. This only capped the climax. I longed for something clean like
  paddling a canoe in open water. My canoe was up at a boat-house on Spuyten
  Duyvil creek. I flung a few things into a valise and went right up there and
  got it. I paddled right through the rest of the night; down to Perth Amboy
  and up the Raritan river. By morning I was cooled off. You see I'd no reason
  to worry about the firm. Dongan had plenty of wealthy friends. If he'd lived
  he could have raised the money."</p>

  <p>"How did your revolver get away from you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh I...I don't know. While I was packing I noticed it wasn't there, but I
  was too much excited to think about it."</p>

  <p>"Had Mr. Dongan any enemies?"</p>

  <p>"No. How should he have? A man like that. Never did a positive act in his
  life, either good or bad."</p>

  <p>"A love-affair maybe?"</p>

  <p>Don shook his head with a smile. "Not Dongan's line at all. He had no luck
  with the sex."</p>

  <p>"Who were his friends?"</p>

  <p>"He had no really intimate friends. Nobody who cared about him
  particularly. Plenty of associates of course. There was Ernest Riever."</p>

  <p>"I was going to ask you about him."</p>

  <p>"You know him?"</p>

  <p>"Only as a name,"</p>

  <p>"Son of Scott Riever the steel magnate. Scott Riever's one of the richest
  men in the country. Ernest is rich in his own right, too. He just fluffs
  around. Has a big place up in Westchester county where he raises peaches and
  so on. It's his hobby."</p>

  <p>"What sort of man is he?"</p>

  <p>"A queer Dick!" said Don deliberating. "A queer Dick!...Hard to describe
  offhand."</p>

  <p>"He has offered five thousand dollars reward for your capture," said
  Pen.</p>

  <p>Don was electrified. "What!" he cried. "The devil you say!...Riever has
  come out against me!...By God, that's funny!"</p>

  <p>"Does that make things clear to you?" Pen asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute!...Let me think!...It's damn funny!...Riever!...My
  God!"</p>

  <p>"Tell me," pleaded Pen. "Begin at the beginning. Do you know Riever
  well?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! It was I who introduced him to Dongan. He's the same age as me. We
  were class-mates in college. We passed as pals. But it was a queer sort of
  friendship. I never could make him out. I couldn't keep my end up with his
  gilded set. I went in for athletics. But he used to come around me all the
  time. Flattered me and so on. Yet he didn't seem to like me either. I'd catch
  him looking at me in no friendly way. He'd let out sneering remarks."</p>

  <p>"Is he a little man, ill-favored?" asked Pen.</p>

  <p>"Why yes. How did you know?"</p>

  <p>Pen smiled to herself. "Nothing. Go on. You were popular in college?"</p>

  <p>"So they said," Don said offhand. "College popularity doesn't saw much
  wood in later life."</p>

  <p>"But you were prominent?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes. Captain of the crew in my senior year."</p>

  <p>"I see. Go on about Riever."</p>

  <p>"Well, after we got out of college there was a sort of mix-up. Nasty mess.
  Riever had married upon graduation. Her name was Nell Proctor, daughter of
  the coal trust. I don't believe he cared anything about her, nor she about
  him. It was just the union of two powerful families that both sides were
  trying to bring about.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile I'd gone into the brokerage business. Riever would always be
  asking me up to his place and I went of course. I didn't like him any better
  than before, but I had to cultivate my graft. I don't suppose Riever's stock
  operations meant much in his life, but he was far and away the biggest
  customer Dongan and Counsell had. We got business merely through being
  associated with him.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mention, did I, that Riever had a rotten streak in him,
  particularly where women were concerned. As time went on I noticed the fair
  Nell growing ever paler and more tight-lipped and I guessed that an explosion
  was coming. Then Riever stopped asking me up there any more. I wondered. He
  still came around the office and gave us his orders. There was a lot of talk
  around town, and finally a fellow told me they were saying that Nell Riever
  had done me the honor...well you know."</p>

  <p>Pen's breast grew tight.</p>

  <p>"I laughed at the story. Why we'd scarcely ever exchanged a word in
  private. She wasn't my sort at all. Riever's attitude towards me hadn't
  changed in the least.</p>

  <p>"Soon there was a complete bust-up of the Riever establishment. Nell sued
  him for divorce. She had cause enough God knows. His affairs were notorious.
  He set up a countersuit and produced a letter in court that Nell had written
  to some unnamed man. Ernest had intercepted it. Well this letter was
  published and I knew by internal evidence that it was...well you know...it
  had been written to me. A man hates to tell these things about himself! Poor
  girl! Just a foolish impulse no doubt, that she regretted as soon as she had
  given away to it! Anyhow the letter was thrown out and she got her divorce
  with thumping alimony."</p>

  <p>Poor Pen was thinking to herself: "I wish I hadn't had to hear about this
  woman. I shall remember her!"</p>

  <p>Don went on: "My name had not been mentioned openly, and Riever still came
  around the office. He still made out to treat me as an intimate friend, but
  that was just to put off the gossips. I began to be aware of a change. Once
  or twice I caught his eyes fixed on me with an expression that was simply
  poisonous!"</p>

  <p>A sharp exclamation escaped from Pen.</p>

  <p>"Made me damned uncomfortable," said Don. "Not that I was afraid of him,
  poor little runt! But one hates to know that there are ugly feelings like
  that around. He got in the way of giving Dongan his orders. He and Dongan
  became quite thick."</p>

  <p>"Did this have any effect on Mr. Dongan's attitude towards you?" asked
  Pen.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Don, "now that you speak of it; Dongan had been acting queerly
  towards me for some time past. Relations were a little strained. But I never
  gave it much thought."</p>

  <p>"Would Mr. Dongan have consulted Mr. Riever about his speculations?" asked
  Pen.</p>

  <p>"Sure! Any tip that Riever let drop would be received as gospel."</p>

  <p>"How about that stock you spoke of?"</p>

  <p>"Union Central?"</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose Mr. Riever advised Mr. Dongan to buy it?"</p>

  <p>"Scarcely. Scott Riever's on the Board of Union Central. He'd have inside
  information if anybody had."</p>

  <p>"But suppose Mr. Riever purposely advised him wrong."</p>

  <p>"Why should he?"</p>

  <p>"To get at you through him."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Don.</p>

  <p>There was a silence while each was thinking hard.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," said Don. "There's a flaw in your reasoning. How could
  Riever have known that Dongan was trying to put it off on me?"</p>

  <p>Pen shrugged. "Who knows what may have passed between the two men? A
  suggestion may have been dropped."</p>

  <p>"I have it!" cried Don, "Riever could easily tell Dongan to put the orders
  through in my name so that it would not be guessed that the tip came from
  him. Everybody knew Riever and I were at outs, you see."</p>

  <p>"Well there you are," said Pen.</p>

  <p>There was another silence.</p>

  <p>"You know what I am thinking," said Pen at last.</p>

  <p>"My God, yes!" said Don. "Me too!...But it's incredible!"</p>

  <p>"Somebody shot Collis Dongan," said Pen simply. "Somebody who hated you.
  For look how cleverly the crime has been fastened on you. That is no
  accidental train of circumstances. Your revolver! And somebody keeps sending
  stuff to the newspapers that is cunningly designed to poison the public mind
  against you!"</p>

  <p>"But how could Riever get away with it?" asked Don in a maze. "He's too
  public a character. Like some sort of potentate you know. He never goes out
  alone. Even if he did shake his body-guard, every newsboy on the street would
  recognize him."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose he did it himself," said Pen, "But with his money he
  could easily get it done, couldn't he? One reads of such things."</p>

  <p>"But if I was his mark, why didn't he take a shot direct at me?" said
  Don.</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't satisfy a man like that," said Pen. "Instant death is
  painless."</p>

  <p>"But what do you know about Riever?" asked Don.</p>

  <p>"My intuition tells me," she said simply. "For years he has been jealous
  of you; jealous of everything you were that he was not. It was like a
  corroding ulcer in his breast. That letter of course brought it to a
  head...Don't you see? to drag you down, to disgrace you so completely, to
  bring you to such an unspeakable death, that is the only thing that would
  give him satisfaction."</p>

  <p>"Good God! I can't grasp such fiendish villainy!" cried Don.</p>

  <p>"I can," said Pen quietly. "...I guess my soul is older than yours."</p>

  <p>"Suppose we're right," said Don. "What good? There is not a scintilla of
  evidence!"</p>

  <p>"He showed his hand once," said Pen. "In offering that reward. Your going
  away on a trip was the one thing he couldn't have foreseen. It has upset all
  his calculations."</p>

  <p>"The reward aroused my suspicions," said Don. "But it's not evidence."</p>

  <p>"We'll get evidence."</p>

  <p>"We're up against it all right," said Don harshly. "What is known as the
  Riever group in New York controls a billion dollars, I guess."</p>

  <p>"Then you're satisfied that I was right, aren't you?" asked Pen.</p>

  <p>"How do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"If you gave yourself up you'd be playing directly into Riever's
  hands."</p>

  <p>Don dropped his head between his hands. "You're right!" he groaned. "But
  good God! how am I going to stand it!"</p>

  <p>Poor Pen! Her breast yearned over him; her arms ached to enfold him. But
  she could only sit there like a wooden woman, staring at the ground. There
  was nothing she could have said which would not have been a mockery.</p>

  <p>He said at last: "I ought to be in New York."</p>

  <p>"It would be impossible to make the trip just now," Pen said quickly. "If
  you only had somebody there to act for you."</p>

  <p>"I have friends, plenty of them," he said gloomily. "But whom could I
  trust in an affair of this sort? It's not their loyalty I doubt, but their
  good sense...Anyhow how could I get my side of the case before them?"</p>

  <p>"Couldn't I carry messages to your friends?" asked Pen diffidently.
  "Perhaps I could find someone competent to act for you...Perhaps I could get
  acquainted with Riever. If I could see him I'd <i>know</i>. A woman might
  discover his weak spot..."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't let you have anything to do with Riever," he said quickly.
  "He's a swine!"</p>

  <p>Pen was charmed by his proprietary air.</p>

  <p>"Besides all that would take money," Don went on dejectedly. "I have only
  a few dollars. A check would be fatal."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I could find the money," murmured Pen.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't let you do that," he said painfully. "Please don't speak of
  it."</p>

  <p>"But if it is necessary!" she persisted. "This is no time for the silly
  little conventions of life. We must speak of it again...What time is it?"</p>

  <p>He flashed a pocket light on his watch. "Two o'clock."</p>

  <p>Pen rose. "We must hurry," she said. "It gets light at four and we've a
  long way to go."</p>

  <p>"Where are we going?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"To the main woods, up the Neck. The detectives and the reporters are
  housed within a quarter of a mile of this spot. If they look around at all in
  the morning they can't help but discover the path that' leads here. Strangers
  wouldn't be kept off by the bad reputation of the place."</p>

  <p>"How can we get away without passing them?" Don asked. "Give me some idea
  of the lie of the land."</p>

  <p>"The woods are full of old roads," said Pen. "Since I was a child I have
  been exploring them. Some were laid out by my grandfather for the gentry to
  drive over. Others have been cut for the purpose of taking out logs. Across
  the pond there's a road comes down to the shore. We must make our way to
  that."</p>

  <p>Again they went through the business of packing up. In a few minutes they
  were ready to start. With Don's flashlight Pen searched all about the
  clearing to make sure that no evidence of his sojourn had been left there.
  Don made a bundle of his tent and tied it on his back. He took his
  grub-basket in his hand, and stuck his hatchet in his belt. Pen stuffed his
  bundle of clothes into the grass bag with the things she had brought. They
  started down to the water's edge.</p>

  <p>Don's spirits instantly began to rise. "I feel like a human being again,"
  he said. "Instead of a caged rat."</p>

  <p>From the spring Pen struck into the underbrush, using Don's flashlight to
  pick her way slowly and cautiously through the tangle. A few yards back from
  the water's edge it was more open.</p>

  <p>"We'll leave a wide open track behind us here," she said, "but I don't
  suppose those New York detectives are very good woodsmen."</p>

  <p>"Why couldn't we wade around the edge of the pond?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The bottom is soft. We'd sink to the knees."</p>

  <p>Finally they struck into the old road where the going was easy. They could
  walk abreast.</p>

  <p>"When Dad sells wood they haul the logs down here to the water's edge and
  float them out to the bay at high tide," said Pen.</p>

  <p>She warned him to avoid the paler spots in the road. These were patches of
  sand. "Doesn't matter so much if they find my tracks," she said, "anybody
  around here would tell them that I am always wandering."</p>

  <p>It was a hot still night with distant lightning. Something seemed to press
  down upon them from above. The woodsy smell compounded of leaf mold and pine
  needles was extraordinarily pungent. The silence under the trees was
  absolute. Not a leaf rustled, not a bird cheeped, not an insect strummed.
  Only when they paused to rest could they hear little stealthy stirrings in
  the mold.</p>

  <p>"Mink or weasel," said Pen.</p>

  <p>Though they had now put their enemies far behind them, out of respect for
  the great silence they still talked in murmurs. The wild creatures were less
  sensitive. Once they heard quite close the sharp bark of a fox, and again
  from farther away a wild laugh came ringing.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" asked Don startled.</p>

  <p>"Loon," said Pen. "There's another pond in that direction."</p>

  <p>Little by little they became one with the night and the wildness; their
  worldly concerns slipped off; their breasts were light. It was enough merely
  to smell and to hear; to stretch their muscles.</p>

  <p>"Why do people live in houses?" said Don.</p>

  <p>"Poor things! They know no better," said Pen.</p>

  <p>More than once the road forked but Pen always made her choice
  unhesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"How can you be so sure in the dark?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I just have a general notion," she laughed. "We couldn't go far wrong.
  The Bay is on one side of us, the fields on the other."</p>

  <p>After a long walk they came suddenly to the edge of the woods. A rail
  fence divided woodland and clearing. There was a barred opening into the
  field. Pen dropped her bag on the other side and vaulted over like a boy. Don
  more heavily encumbered had to climb over. On the other side some dim shapes
  rose awkwardly in the grass and trotted away.</p>

  <p>"My sheep," said Pen. "I know where we are. I mended that fence myself to
  keep them from straying."</p>

  <p>At one step they had entered the civilized world again. Up the river the
  steamboat blew for a wharf, and they could hear from far-off the barking of a
  dog, and all those vague little sounds that rise from a peopled land at
  night. The field was populous with crickets and the wide space was made
  lovely by myriad fire-flies floating about like vagrant stars. The field was
  a broad one, and the going rough underfoot. Young pine trees were springing
  up everywhere.</p>

  <p>"Hanged if I know where I am," said Don.</p>

  <p>"We're facing north now," said Pen. "That pale glow in the clouds is the
  reflection of the lights of Washington, seventy miles from here."</p>

  <p>"Fancy the Nation's capital...and this!" said Don.</p>

  <p>"That bunchy black shadow away off to the left is the grove of tall trees
  that surrounds our house. We have circled round it you see. The long line on
  the right is the main woods which fills the whole Neck for miles above. All
  our fields lie on this side. The woods are gradually taking them back."</p>

  <p>"If you put me in those woods will I ever see you again?" he asked
  apprehensively.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's not much more than a mile from the house. That's nothing."</p>

  <p>They came to another fence with a barred opening, and climbing over found
  themselves in a road.</p>

  <p>"What road is this?" asked Don.</p>

  <p>"There's only the one road," Pen said. "It runs back from the house
  between the fields and on through the woods up the Neck." She hesitated
  painfully. "What time is it?"</p>

  <p>The question brought back everything painful that they had put out of mind
  for awhile. Their hearts went down together. He threw the light on his
  watch.</p>

  <p>"Half-past three," he said.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Pen with a catch in her breath, "I dare not go any farther with
  you. It will be light in half an hour. Do you think you could carry
  everything the rest of the way?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, as far as that goes. But...but must you go?"</p>

  <p>"I must!...Listen! You are to keep along the road until it enters the
  woods. It dips into a hollow there and fords a small stream. You are to turn
  to the left there&mdash;to the left, remember, and ascend the stream, walking
  in the water. It has a firm sandy bottom, at least for a certain distance. As
  soon as you are out of sight of the road, better stop on the bank until it is
  light, so you won't mire yourself or step in a hole."</p>

  <p>He put out his hand to her. "When will I see you again?"</p>

  <p>"You are not listening!...You must keep on up the stream until you come to
  a clearing on the right-hand side. Up at the top of the rise there used to be
  a negro cabin. But it burned down. Only the chimney is standing. Don't pitch
  your tent in the clearing. It would be too conspicuous. Conceal it in the
  brush across the stream. I can reach you there direct from the fields. If I
  can't find you I'll whistle like a whip-poor-will. And you answer."</p>

  <p>"When will you come?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow night. Unless I am prevented."</p>

  <p>"Oh!...if you are prevented...!"</p>

  <p>Pen laughed shakily. "Not much danger! They'll have to be very clever to
  keep me in!"</p>

  <p>He clung to her hand. "Well...I'm not going to complain," he muttered.</p>

  <p>Pen clasped his hand in both of hers. "Oh, I know how hard it is! How
  hard!" she cried. "Try to be patient. It may not be for long!"</p>

  <p>"It can not be for long," he muttered. "A man has his limits!"</p>

  <p>"The search may drift away from Broome's Point," she said eagerly.
  "Anything may happen...Tomorrow night when I come I'll bring you some
  books."</p>

  <p>"Books!" he exclaimed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Well anyway at night we can wander around where we please."</p>

  <p>"If you work all day you've got to have your sleep at night," he said
  doggedly.</p>

  <p>"Sleep!" said Pen. "I've got all the rest of my life to sleep in!"</p>

  <p>He was still clinging to her hand. "It's so hard to let you go," he
  murmured. "Could you...Oh, I know I haven't any right to ask it...in my
  position..."</p>

  <p>Pen hated his humility. She stamped her foot. "Any right! What's your
  position got to do with it?"</p>

  <p>His head went up with a jerk. "Pen!" he cried.</p>

  <p>Pen was plain panic-stricken. "Good-night!" she said, jerking her hand
  free. "The sky is getting light behind you!"</p>

  <p>She all but ran down the road. Once she looked behind her. He was still
  standing there. If he had called her she would have had to go back, let the
  dawn break if it would. But he heavily shouldered his pack, and turned in the
  other direction.</p>

  <p>At the breakfast table next morning Pen suddenly interrupted her father's
  endless, querulous complaints by saying: "Well, how about me?"</p>

  <p>He stared. "Hey?" he said blankly.</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose I'm enjoying the present situation? Stared at, spied upon,
  my house overrun with riff-raff! It's intolerable!"</p>

  <p>"Of course!...Of course!" he stammered. "That's just what's troubling
  me."</p>

  <p>"I want to go away until it blows over," said Pen.</p>

  <p>Pendleton looked scared. "But...but would they allow you to?"</p>

  <p>"Pooh!" said Pen. "That threat of arrest was just a bluff."</p>

  <p>"Where would you go?"</p>

  <p>"Oh...anywhere."</p>

  <p>"I haven't the money," he said plaintively.</p>

  <p>"I'd pay my own."</p>

  <p>That old look of suspicion flickered up in his eyes. "Where would you get
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Well ...I could sell my sheep."</p>

  <p>"Sell your sheep!" he echoed. "Why, preposterous! Why, the sheep are the
  best part of our capital!"</p>

  <p>"My capital," corrected Pen.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he said stiffly. "But I'm your father I suppose. I have a
  right to prevent you doing anything so foolhardy. Just to gratify a momentary
  impulse. I forbid you to think of such a thing! Never speak of it again!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right," said Pen, dropping the matter so quickly that a more
  perspicacious man might have guessed she had not dropped it at all. As a
  matter of fact as soon as breakfast was over she took the <i>Sun</i>-paper to
  her room and looked up the quotations for sheep and lambs on the Baltimore
  market. Prices were low, but there was no help for it. She fell to studying
  ways and means.</p>

  <p>Later she was moving about the house setting things to rights and always
  planning, planning, when she heard a musical deep-toned ship's whistle from
  the river&mdash;the whistle of a stranger in those waters. She ran to the
  front windows and beheld a big yacht coming in from the bay. She was as slim
  and sheer as a pickerel with a piratical rake to her masts and funnel. The
  morning sun showed up her mahogany upper-works as red as blood, and
  dazzlingly picked out her polished brasses. A beauty! An anchor was let go
  with a mighty rattling of chain, and the yacht slowly came about in the
  stream.</p>

  <p>Pen knew by intuition that her coming had something to do with the matter
  that filled all their minds, but pride forbade her running out of the house
  to find out. With a great effort of will she kept on about her work,
  possessing her soul in what patience she could.</p>

  <p>Bye and bye there was a rat-tat-tat on the seldom-used knocker on the
  front door. Opening it. Pen beheld a ship's officer in natty blue uniform and
  gold braid. He took off his cap and offered her a note.</p>

  <p>It was addressed to herself. It was written on thick creamy paper embossed
  with a crest and the legend: <i>"Yacht Alexandra."</i> It was brief.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ernest Riever presents his compliments to Miss Pendleton Broome, and
  begs to know if it will be convenient for her to receive him this
  morning."</p>

  <p>Pen's brain whirled. She lowered her eyes and gave herself five seconds to
  regain her balance. Finally the suspicion of a dimple appeared at the corner
  of her lips. She looked up.</p>

  <p>"Please tell Mr. Riever that I shall be happy to see him at any time."</p>

  <p>She went slowly upstairs to change her dress.</p>

  <p>The sheep were saved!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="V"
     id="V"></a>V. &mdash; ON BOARD THE <i>ALEXANDRA</i></h2>

  <p class="first">UNDER the awning on the after deck of the <i>Alexandra</i>,
  Pen was reclining in a luxurious basket chair with her feet crossed on a rest
  in front of her. Her brow was clear, her lips smiling. To have seen her then,
  one would never have guessed that she had anything more on her mind than the
  deliciousness of luxury which she was experiencing for the first time in her
  life. As a matter of fact being a human, pretty girl she took to it like a
  cat to cream, but just the same there was a lot hidden behind her seeming
  open smile. She knew that she looked all right. Poor as they were, in Aunt
  Maria Pen possessed a laundress, one of a fast-disappearing race, and there
  was a bloom upon her simple gingham dress that matched the flower-like
  freshness of herself. It was mid-morning but Pen's undone chores troubled her
  not a bit.</p>

  <p>The <i>Alexandra</i> had been lying inside Broome's Point for two days. On
  the first day Riever had lunched with the Broomes; yesterday he had returned
  their hospitality. Of the two Pen's food was undoubtedly better, being
  fresher than the millionaire's, but she had tasted with delight all the
  expensive things she had read about which never came to Southern Maryland:
  Caviare, <i>petite marmite</i>, <i>pate de fois gras</i>, hothouse grapes,
  marrons, etc. This morning Riever had insisted on having the Broomes to
  breakfast on the yacht.</p>

  <p>A few feet from Pen the owner of it all was sitting on the wide divan that
  encircled the stern rail. Pendleton Broome sat beside him, and on the deck
  between the two men stood a little table bearing coffee cups and a box of
  such cigars as the elder man had never whiffed before even in dreams.
  Pendleton was holding forth to Riever in his usual style, while the
  millionaire listening politely, glanced at Pen out of the corners of his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>The coming of Riever had changed the situation not a little. Riever moved
  like an unacknowledged monarch. The tale of his wealth compelled men's
  homage. In his presence all voices were prone to become silky and backs to
  bend. Riever like many another monarch despised this homage while he insisted
  on it. His more intimate creatures therefore were careful to cultivate an
  offhand, man-to-man air towards their master while they utterly subordinated
  their souls to his. This just suited him.</p>

  <p>Well, Riever being what he was, he had only to drop a suggestion to
  Delehanty the chief detective to have all surveillance removed from over
  Pen's actions. She was now free to come and go as she chose. Of course
  nothing further had been said of the proposed warrant for her arrest.
  Delehanty had become as obsequious towards her as he had previously been
  arrogant.</p>

  <p>A curious relation existed between Pen and the millionaire. From the first
  he had been most courteous, but in the beginning it had been dictated merely
  by motives of policy. He could see a little further than the clumsy
  Delehanty, that was all. Pen recognized in him an adversary infinitely more
  dangerous. But he had changed. The second time she saw him she became aware
  that she had a power over him. In short he was powerfully attracted. Pen
  marveled at it. Riever, who presumably had only to pick and choose from among
  the beauties of the world! But though she could not understand how it had
  come about, she rejoiced in her power, and had no scruples whatever against
  using it.</p>

  <p>To anyone else beside Pen the explanation would have been obvious enough.
  It is all very well to buy yourself royally through a world of salable women,
  but it lays you open to a dangerous weakness. When you meet a woman who is
  obviously not for sale, you are apt to fall down before her most
  ignominiously. That was what had happened to Riever. Just because he was so
  rich Pen had instinctively adopted an independent air towards him that piqued
  him intolerably. Really independent. Then there was that highly individual
  charm of hers. And her independence was not indifference. With all his
  experience Riever had never met a woman like Pen. Or perhaps it would be more
  correct to say that a woman of Pen's spirit and transparent honesty had never
  before taken an interest in the ugly little man.</p>

  <p>When she was with Riever it need hardly be said that Pen was not nearly so
  honest as she seemed. In fact she concealed herself behind her apparent
  frankness. That is the great advantage of having a naturally honest look. It
  enables you to lie so well when you have a real need of lying. Since Riever
  had arrived the two had been almost constantly together, and a sort of subtle
  duel going on between them. Pen's object was to encourage him without giving
  of herself. He was the first man she had ever set out to encourage. It was a
  sufficiently intoxicating experience for the man. Pen's blandishments were
  very different from the sort that Riever had been accustomed to.</p>

  <p>As for Pen's father he had swallowed the lure of luxury, hook, bait and
  sinker. At this moment buttoned up to the neck in his old Prince Albert he
  seemed to be perspiring satisfaction. He had come into the sort of life that
  he regarded as his own. To see him stretch his arm over the stern rail and
  flick the ash off the expensive cigar with his little finger was a treat.
  Pendleton Broome was the sort of man who will always be flattered because he
  asked for it so plainly. It was Riever's cue to encourage him to the utmost.
  After his first meeting with the millionaire Pendleton had said to Pen:</p>

  <p>"I find I have not rusted out in my solitude. I can still keep my end up
  with men of the world. Riever listens to me with the most respectful
  attention."</p>

  <p>Pen had smiled to herself without answering.</p>

  <p>More had passed between the two men than Pen was as yet aware of. She knew
  that Riever had promised to look into the matter of the Broome's Point
  railway, thus raising her father's hopes to the skies, but she did not know
  that Riever had actually purchased half a dozen lots adjacent to the proposed
  terminal and that the inside packet of the old Prince Albert was at this
  moment crackling with greenbacks.</p>

  <p>Pendleton was saying self-importantly: "The original grade of the railway
  issues from the gully yonder. The plan was to build a long dock straight out
  to deep water. But there's a shoal off the gully. My plan would be to have
  the tracks turn along the shore to a point below the house where they could
  build all the docks they wanted right into deep water."</p>

  <p>Riever gave him only as much attention as was needed to keep him going.
  "But that would ruin the outlook from your house," he suggested idly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I shall not remain here after the railway comes," said Pendleton
  loftily. "I'd take an apartment in New York, and perhaps a house in
  Newport."</p>

  <p>"Newport is not what it was," remarked Riever,</p>

  <p>"Ah, the vulgar have taken possession I suppose," said Pendleton. "My
  father had a place there. My childish recollections of it are most
  pleasant."</p>

  <p>"People are scattered all over the map nowadays," said Riever.</p>

  <p>"That I presume is due to the introduction of the automobile," said
  Pendleton. He launched into a discussion of automobiles of which he knew
  nothing.</p>

  <p>Riever listening gravely, sent a quizzical glance in Pen's direction. But
  Pen was not to be tempted into making common cause with him against her
  father. She looked blandly ahead of her.</p>

  <p>Pendleton himself delivered them from boredom. He had observed Riever's
  interest in his daughter and was not without his hopes in that direction too.
  By and by he rose saying with a self-conscious air:</p>

  <p>"...Er...I have some important letters to get off this afternoon. If you'd
  be good enough to put me ashore Riever. You needn't hurry daughter."</p>

  <p>Under other circumstances Pen would have been deeply affronted by his
  transparent ruse. But as has been said, in this affair she had no conscience.
  She allowed it to be seen that she had no intention of moving.</p>

  <p>Riever made haste to summon the boat. Pendleton went down the ladder in
  his absurd three seasons' straw hat, bobbing his head and waving his hand
  airily. Towards the sailors his air of mingled condescension and
  goodfellowship was delicious.</p>

  <p>Pen glanced at Riever through her lashes as he returned to her. The little
  man held himself stiffly in his blue yachting togs and walked with a
  suggestion of a strut. The greatest tailor in the world could not endow his
  meager frame with beauty or grace, but it was not to be denied that his
  wonderfully made clothes lent him a certain distinction.</p>

  <p>He patted the cushions of that wonderful divan that encircled the stern.
  "Wouldn't you be more comfortable here?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" drawled Pen.</p>

  <p>"A cigarette?"</p>

  <p>"Never learned how," she said. "I'll make my first trials in private."</p>

  <p>"I'll send you a box."</p>

  <p>He sat down and feasted his eyes on her openly.</p>

  <p>He was no beauty. His face was a little reddened and roughened with
  incipient erysipelas. Don had said that he and Riever were of the same age,
  but the millionaire might have been of any age between twenty-five and
  forty-five; there was no look of youth about him. He was redeemed from
  insignificance by his assured habit of command. Yet his assurance did not go
  very deep. Pen had discovered that he might quite easily be put out of
  countenance, only nobody ever tried it. When he chose as at present, he could
  be most agreeable, but there was always a pained roll to his eyes, such as
  may be seen in the eyes of a bad-tempered horse, a look that boded no good to
  his underlings.</p>

  <p>A curious thing was that in their endless conversations Don Counsell was
  never referred to but in the most casual manner. Each had a secret to guard
  here. Pen kept her secret better than the man did. Riever wished it to be
  supposed that he had just happened in at Broome's Point on his yacht. That
  his coming at this time had only the slightest connection with the pursuit of
  Don Counsell, Pen knew better of course. On every hand she gathered evidence
  that Riever was the head and front of the pursuit. Riever was the secret
  source of the hideous clamor raised against the man Pen knew to be innocent.
  Twenty times a day Riever gave himself away to her love-sharpened
  eyes&mdash;but it was not evidence!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile they fenced with each other.</p>

  <p>"You should not encourage Dad in his delusions," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"You mean about the railway?" said Riever. "I could put it through with a
  nod of my head if I chose."</p>

  <p>"But you won't," she said.</p>

  <p>"How do you know I won't?"</p>

  <p>"You are so clearly only humoring him."</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens!" he said in mock dismay. "Do you undertake to read
  men?"</p>

  <p>"I don't undertake it," said Pen. "You can't help seeing what you
  see."</p>

  <p>"I could put it through," he said again, "if there was sufficient
  incentive."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Pen. And let the matter drop.</p>

  <p>He was trying to make her beg for the railway. What most fascinated and
  provoked him in her was his inability to make her ask him for anything, or
  take anything from him. Everybody else in the world asked him for things one
  way or another.</p>

  <p>He presently went on: "That's the trouble with life to a man like me: I
  have no particular incentive to do anything."</p>

  <p>Pen refused to recognize his money. "Why haven't you the same incentive as
  other men?" she demanded to know.</p>

  <p>"What are men's principal incentives?" he parried.</p>

  <p>"Well, love, ambition, the desire to excel other men, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Yes, one could go far for love," he said with a sidelong look.</p>

  <p>Pen without looking at him was aware of the look. She thought: "Men are
  funny! He's trying to make me philander with him in a crude way, and if I did
  he'd weary of me immediately!"</p>

  <p>It was Riever's desire to shine in her eyes that frequently betrayed him.
  She was not impressed by his wealth; very well, he had to find some way of
  making himself out a remarkable figure. He presently said with a casual
  air:</p>

  <p>"How about hate as an incentive?"</p>

  <p>Pen pricked up her ears. She answered as casually as he: "I always thought
  of hate as destroying a man instead of nerving him to do things."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he said. "Hate will carry a man as far as love&mdash;or
  farther." His feelings got the better of him. He forgot his casual air.
  "There's more in hate than love!" he went on with glittering eyes. "Men get
  tired of loving, but never of hating. There's more pleasure in hate because
  you never can entirely possess your lover, but you can destroy your
  enemy!...Do I horrify you?" he asked with a sudden harsh laugh.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," said Pen coolly. "Nothing of that sort horrifies me,
  though I might have to make believe to be horrified."</p>

  <p>"Not with me," he said, showing his yellow teeth.</p>

  <p>"It is comfortable not to have to make pretenses," Pen said. That was as
  near as she could come to philandering.</p>

  <p>"I believe you'd make a good hater," he hazarded.</p>

  <p>"Maybe," said Pen. "I've never had the experience like you."</p>

  <p>An instinct of caution occurred to him. "Oh, you mustn't take me too
  literally," he said laughing. "I haven't anybody to hate at present. But I
  have the capacity."</p>

  <p>It was too late. His glittering eyes had reminded Pen of Don's phrase: a
  poisonous look. It was precious evidence to her heart, but unfortunately not
  the sort of evidence she could take into court.</p>

  <p>She was reluctant to drop the subject of hatred.</p>

  <p>"The Borgias were good haters," she hazarded. "I lately read a story which
  told how Alexander Borgia caused a bed to be made for his enemies. It was so
  arranged that when a body warmed it it killed like a hammer-stroke."</p>

  <p>"A fanciful tale," said Riever. "All the killing poisons I ever heard of
  have to be introduced into the stomach, the blood or the lungs."</p>

  <p>He spoke as one who knows, and Pen, wondering, pursued the subject with
  further questions. It was like tapping a hidden spring in the man. With a
  curious relish he described the action of various poisons on the human
  system.</p>

  <p>"Cyanide is the neatest," he said. "There's your hammer-stroke."</p>

  <p>Pen thought: "Has he tried that too?...Collis Dongan was shot!"</p>

  <p>She betrayed nothing in her face, but Riever suddenly, with an uneasy
  glance, was impelled to explain how he came by so much knowledge. "You see my
  hobby is raising fruit," he said. "My peaches have scores of enemies;
  suckers, chewers, fungi and bacilli. I have to study to keep ahead of
  them."</p>

  <p>But he had been talking of the human system!</p>

  <p>She couldn't appear to pin him down of course. She had to let him range
  where he would, contenting herself with giving the talk a little push this
  way or that when the opportunity offered. She encouraged him to talk of his
  childhood and youth, to which he was nothing loath. He unconsciously drew her
  a picture of a willful, jealous, destructive boy, a little monument of
  selfishness. There was a bad crack in his nature.</p>

  <p>He hated beauty, moral and physical, but particularly physical beauty. Pen
  marked the pained sneer with which his eyes followed the stalwart young
  steward who carried away the cups. Riever had to have handsome servants to
  maintain his position, but their comeliness was a perpetual reproach to him.
  No wonder he had hated Don Counsell from the first, Pen thought. She guessed
  darkly that Riever was the kind that pursues beautiful women only to hurt
  them.</p>

  <p>He had been telling her with a laugh of the torments to which new boys
  were subjected in the fashionable school he had attended. One poor little
  wretch it appeared had been driven by his persecutors to the point of
  attempting suicide.</p>

  <p>"Weren't you sorry then?" asked Pen.</p>

  <p>"No!" he said. "I had to go through the mill when I came. It wasn't my
  fault that this kid had a soft streak in him. Besides conscience is only
  another name for weak-mindedness. I made up my mind early that I'd never be
  sorry for anything I did. A strong man laughs at conscience."</p>

  <p>Pen thought: "Funny kind of strength!"</p>

  <p>This was all very well but what good did it do her? They might talk for a
  month of mornings without her getting any further. And she had not a day to
  spare. How was she to get facts? The obvious thing would be to bribe his
  servants, to have his effects searched and so on. This was impossible for
  Pen. She was ready to despair of ever bridging the chasm between surmise and
  fact.</p>

  <p>The motor-boat which had taken Pendleton ashore, had proceeded on to the
  Island for the mail. It was now to be seen returning. This was Riever's own
  private mail service. On the day of his coming, deciding that the regular
  mail was too slow, he had instituted a double automobile service between
  Absolom's Island and Baltimore. Twice a day by this means he received his
  letters and the New York papers, particularly the papers. Pen had already
  marked with what a curious eagerness he awaited the New York papers.</p>

  <p>When the mail-bag was brought to him now he said after a momentary
  hesitation:</p>

  <p>"Put it in the saloon."</p>

  <p>Pen noted the eager roll of his eyes towards the bag. There was something
  in there that he desired to see even more than he wished to cultivate her
  company. With the idea of seeing the thing through, she said carelessly:</p>

  <p>"May I see a New York paper?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he said, and had the bag brought back. It was emptied out on
  the seat beside him. He handed Pen a paper.</p>

  <p>She opened it and feigned to read. At first he made believe to ignore the
  balance of the contents of the bag, and sat there as if awaiting her
  pleasure. But he was uneasy. His feet moved; his hands twitched. Finally as
  Pen showed no signs of losing interest in her sheet, he picked up another
  paper and opened it with hands that trembled a little.</p>

  <p>Pen found that she could not watch him from where she sat. He held his
  paper up between them. She lowered hers and rose. He was all attention.</p>

  <p>"This hasn't got what I want?" she said. "May I see another?"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for him to hand it to her she picked up another paper and
  seated herself on the divan with only the mail matter between them. From this
  point of vantage she could watch him very well without appearing to.</p>

  <p>He glanced over his sheet and she over hers. "Glancing," however, does not
  convey the strained intentness with which he was searching the news columns.
  Pen observed at once that it was not the Counsell case that interested him.
  That still occupied the most prominent position on the first page but his
  eyes merely skated over it. It was something else he was looking for. He
  turned the page and his intent eyes traveled it column by column.</p>

  <p>On the third page they came to a stop. Pen saw his grasp tighten on the
  paper until the edges of his thumb nails turned white. A little knot of
  muscle stood out on his jaw. Unfortunately Pen could not see his eyes, but
  from the extraordinary tenseness of his attitude she guessed the look in
  them. Whatever it was he read it was brief. He relaxed; a long breath escaped
  him. He let the paper fall and turned to Pen. There was a new brightness in
  his face. Certain lines of anxiety were smoothed out. Cynical satisfaction
  was writ large there. He all but laughed in his relief. He made no further
  pretense of reading the paper, but lit a fresh cigar and cocking it up
  between his lips puffed away like a man well pleased with the world.</p>

  <p>As well as she could Pen had marked in her mind the spot on the third page
  where his glance had rested.</p>

  <p>It was the New York <i>Courier</i> he was reading. She had to be careful
  not to betray her hand. She made believe to go on searching through the paper
  she had. Finally she let it fall.</p>

  <p>"It's not here either," she said.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" asked Riever comfortably.</p>

  <p>"One of the New York papers has a fashion department they call 'A Daily
  Hint from Paris'. But I don't know which one it is."</p>

  <p>"Can't say that I ever noticed it myself," said Riever grinning. "But try
  the <i>Courier</i>."</p>

  <p>This was more than she had dared hope for. She took the paper from him in
  a hand that she forced to be steady. For awhile she turned the pages in the
  haphazard way that one searches through a strange newspaper. Riever meanwhile
  was sitting beside her regarding his cigar with half closed eyes, and making
  a little humming sound between his teeth. Clearly he was intent upon thoughts
  that were miles away from her.</p>

  <p>Pen ventured to let her gaze rest on the third page. The make-up of that
  page, news and advertisements, was such that she had little difficulty in
  picking out what she was looking for. There was but the one short item of
  news near the bottom of the page in the middle column. This is what Pen
  read:</p>

  <p align="center">EAST-SIDE GANGSTER MISSING</p>

  <p>"A girl who gave her name as Blanche Paglar of Elizabeth St., became
  hysterical at police headquarters this morning upon being informed by the
  police that there was no clue to the disappearance of Henry, alias Spike
  Talley, 24, same address. The girl had previously reported that Talley had
  been missing since the night of May 27th. She received scant sympathy from
  the police who told her that if the young man had met with foul play it was
  probably in the pursuit of his own nefarious occupations. Spike Talley was a
  leading member of the notorious Chick Murphy gang, and is suspected of
  complicity in half a dozen crimes of violence."</p>

  <p>Pen turned a little giddy. Her heart pounded so that she thought Riever
  must hear it. Dared she credit what this story implied? Had she come upon the
  key to the whole mystery? Had she? Had she? She leaned back in the divan and
  held the paper up in front of her so that he could not see her face.</p>

  <p>When her breast quieted down she sternly reminded herself that this was
  but slim evidence on which to build a case. She might be mistaken altogether.
  She might be merely reading into the item what she desired to find there. She
  determined to put it to the test. But she had to wait awhile before she dared
  trust her voice.</p>

  <p>It was Riever who said at last coaxingly: "Put down the paper."</p>

  <p>Pen did so. Her face was perfectly composed now. Her voice even as she
  said: "Here's a curious little story."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" said Riever.</p>

  <p>"A girl goes to the police for help in finding her lover. They laugh at
  her because he was a gangster."</p>

  <p>For an instant Riever looked at her like an animal at bay, his teeth
  showing, his eyes senseless with terror. It was gone in a snap of the
  fingers, but it was enough.</p>

  <p>"I guess that's common enough," he said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"What a situation for a story," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, if you like that sort of story," he said, flicking the ash off
  his cigar.</p>

  <p>Pen said to herself with a swelling breast: "I have made a beginning!" No
  need for her to secure the paper. Those names and that address were etched on
  her brain.</p>

  <p>Riever's start of terror had been due to a reflex action of which he was
  scarcely conscious. He did not suspect that he had betrayed himself. He must
  have argued that it was impossible that Pen should connect him with that item
  in the paper. Her speaking of it could only have been a coincidence. So his
  satisfaction was undisturbed. They talked on about all sorts of things. But
  Pen was wild to get into action now.</p>

  <p>Her opportunity came when one of Riever's men came to ask if he had any
  orders for the boat. It was returning to the Island to get the regular mail
  which arrived about noon.</p>

  <p>Pen said to Riever: "This would be a good chance for me to get my shopping
  done. If I might..."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Riever. "If you must. May I come too?"</p>

  <p>This was awkward. It could not be evaded though. "It's your boat," said
  Pen, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Yours for this trip."</p>

  <p>"Charmed to have you," said Pen. "...But you can't look over my shoulder
  when I'm making my poor little purchases."</p>

  <p>"I'll wait in the boat for you."</p>

  <p>The slim mahogany tender which lay alongside had cost as much as many a
  well-to-do man's cruiser. Nothing like her had ever cleaved the waters of the
  Pocomico. She had the speed of a railway train. Pen was handed in to a little
  sheltered nook in the stern. Riever sank down beside her and they were off
  with a leap, throwing a wall of water back from either side of the bow.</p>

  <p>But Pen was oblivious to their passage. Her glance was far withdrawn.</p>

  <p>"What are you thinking about?" asked Riever.</p>

  <p>"My shopping," she answered instantly. "It's quite a problem. There's so
  little to choose from in the Island stores."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't you like to go up to Baltimore for a day?" he asked.</p>

  <p>This was what Pen had been angling for. "I might like it," she said,
  "but..." she finished with a shrug.</p>

  <p>"Well, there are the cars running up and down empty every day. Why not go
  up Monday morning?"</p>

  <p>"Monday is wash-day," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"Tuesday, then."</p>

  <p>Pen considered. "All right," she said. "I would like to go on
  Tuesday."</p>

  <p>"That's settled then."</p>

  <p>Pen saw from his look that he meant to come with her. That was to be
  expected. She must adjust her plans accordingly.</p>

  <p>In three minutes they were at the wharf in front of the store. It was like
  magic. The <i>Pee Bee</i> took a good twenty minutes to do it. Pen stepped
  out, a sailor was sent up to the Post-office, and Riever remained in the
  boat, a target for curious stares. He hated to be stared at, and he presently
  gave the word for the tender to wait out in the stream.</p>

  <p>The store was a rambling structure added to from time to time as business
  increased. The clerks were engaged in a continual marathon from one distant
  shelf to another. The three young men contended for the privilege of waiting
  on Pen, who was a prime favorite even with the touchy Island people who by
  turns resented and laughed at her father. Pen was entirely unaffected and
  friendly, quite unconscious of her own reserve. In short she kept alive a
  fine old tradition of gentility. She was "Pen" to the three youths and they
  were "George" and "Stanley" and "Roy" to her, yet a gulf separated them.</p>

  <p>In order to keep up her role of shopper Pen was obliged to purchase a chip
  basket which she did not want, and a number of articles which she could use
  of course, but which she had not intended to get that morning. Her purpose in
  coming to the Island was to send off a letter. She could not write it in the
  post-office because the sailor from the <i>Alexandra</i> was waiting there,
  so she bought paper and envelope in the store and wrote it on the
  counter.</p>

  <p>She had been revolving the opening sentences on her way over. So
  concentrated was she upon her task that the bustle, the running to and fro in
  the store disturbed her not a whit. Through the open door she could see the
  mahogany tender floating out in the creek with Riever sitting in his place
  smoking one of the endless succession of cigars, and she knew she was safe
  from interruption in that direction.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Blanche Paglar:</span></p>

  <p class="letter">I read in the New York "Courier" this morning of your
  search for Spike Talley. Perhaps I can give you a clue. I cannot hold out any
  hope to you that he is still alive, but anyway I suppose it would be a relief
  to you to learn the truth. But I don't want to deceive you. I am sure of
  nothing yet. I have only a suspicion. I thought if we could put what little I
  know with what you know we might clear up the whole thing.</p>

  <p><br>
  Having written this much Pen paused and reread it with a frown. It sounded
  too cut and dried. She wished to win this unknown girl's heart. It was
  nothing to Pen at that moment that Blanche had loved a gangster and was
  perhaps herself a criminal. All Pen considered was that Blanche had lost her
  lover, and that Pen's own lover was in terrible danger. That made them
  sisters. She continued, from the heart:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">I am a girl like yourself. I understand much that was not
  written in the paper. Like yourself I love somebody who is threatened by a
  worse fate than that which I suppose may have overtaken your friend. And at
  the hands of the same man. We ought to be friends. We ought to help one
  another.</p>

  <p><br>
  Pen's eyelids prickled as she wrote this. She forced down the emotion, and
  continued more soberly:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">I dare not write all I suspect to one who is still a
  stranger to me. Will you meet me in Baltimore on Tuesday at noon? I shall be
  waiting for you in front of the notion counter in Douglas' department store.
  Anybody will direct you to it. I don't know what you look like of course, but
  you may recognize me by a blue silk turban stitched with red. My hair and
  eyes are dark. You may take a good look at me before you make yourself known,
  and decide if I look like a person who can be trusted. Don't speak to me if I
  am not alone. Even if I am alone I may be watched, and it would be better for
  you to greet me like an old friend. I will enclose a post-office order for
  fifteen dollars to pay your fare to Baltimore and back.</p>

  <p><br>
  Pen was afraid to put her name to this. She hated anonymity, and realized
  that it would raise a justifiable suspicion in the other girl's breast, but
  within the past few days the newspapers had made the name of Pendleton Broome
  almost as famous as that of Donald Counsell. How could she take the risk?
  Suppose her letter ended in the newspapers? She turned hot and cold at the
  thought. Even the post-mark Absolom's Island would give too much away. But
  she had to take that chance. She couldn't put down a false name either. She
  finally signed her letter: <i>"Your Would-be Friend."</i></p>

  <p><br>
  When she finally held her letter enclosed, and addressed in her hand, her
  heart failed her for a moment. "It will only arouse her suspicions," she
  thought. "She'll never come!" Pen steeled her resolution. "In that case I'll
  go to her!"</p>

  <p>Pen got a blank check from one of the clerks, filled it out and cashed it.
  There went her chance of the new hat she needed so badly. Leaving her
  purchases in the store for the moment she went on up the road to the
  post-office. The store looked out over the waters of Back Creek. You went up
  a little rise and found yourself looking out over the river from the other
  side of the Island. The post-office stood on the corner where the road turned
  up-stream. It was only a couple of hundred yards from the store but outside
  the range of Riever's vision from the tender.</p>

  <p>The mail bus had just arrived and a certain proportion of the Islanders
  were hanging about outside the little building, waiting for the distribution.
  During this interval the door was always locked but Pen enjoyed privileges
  there. She knocked, and the postmaster, Sammy Cupples, seeing who it was,
  made haste to open.</p>

  <p>She made out her application for the money-order at the little desk in the
  corner, and Sammy paused long enough in the work of distribution to issue it,
  so that it might get in that day's mail. The bus went back immediately. It
  would reach Baltimore some time before night, and the letter would be
  delivered in New York the first thing Monday morning. When it dropped into
  the mail-bag a tight hand was laid on Pen's heart for a moment and she would
  have given anything to have it back. But the die was cast.</p>

  <p>Pen returned to the store. One of the youths carried her basket out on the
  wharf. The tender swept around in a graceful circle and came alongside.
  Riever stood up to hand Pen in. The Island boy's eyes goggled a little at the
  famous man. Riever looked his worst when he showed his yellow teeth in a
  loverly smile. Pen shuddered at him inwardly, thinking: "You would not be
  smiling if you knew what I had just done!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the man came with the mail they sped back to Broome's
  Point.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="VI"
     id="VI"></a>VI. &mdash; MOONLIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was night and Pen with her indomitable carriage was
  trudging along the road that led straight back between the fields. Under her
  arm was the inevitable grass bag. Chin up and back very straight there was
  always a sort of challenge in Pen's gait. As a child she had been just the
  same, one of those adorable little fighters who conceal a heart as tender as
  love itself. There was a photograph of her at the age of three with a look
  wistful, proud, and astonished at meanness. She still had that look.</p>

  <p>A fantastic tangle of wild grape, trumpet vine, elder bush and sassafras
  completely hid the rail fences and hemmed her in on either hand, and an
  occasional pointed cedar or seedling cherry rose against the night sky. The
  middle of the road and the screen of leafage on one side were drenched with
  moonlight. The moon dangled in the sky like a hanging lamp: one could see
  into the depths beyond her.</p>

  <p>Pen walked along with her face up to the moon in an attitude of surrender.
  Her face was haggard with emotion. All day she was obliged to wear a mask, to
  weigh every word she uttered. What a relief it was at last to let go, to let
  the moon have its way with her, to bathe in her silver stream. Relief in a
  sense but hardly pleasure, for when she let go she was so defenseless, so
  quivering that the stream of beauty hurt her. It enervated her so, she was
  terrified lest she might not be able to gird herself up again.</p>

  <p>For she knew her respite was only momentary. She longed for and dreaded
  what awaited her at the end of her walk. She couldn't give herself up to Don
  as she could to the moon. She had to put on another mask for him. A mask of
  cheer. He was her charge that she had to watch over and care for and beguile
  into contentment. The fact that he hotly resented being a charge on her did
  not make her task any easier. They had been getting on each other's nerves a
  good deal.</p>

  <p>Ever and anon as she walked, she glanced over her shoulder uneasily aware
  that a man could follow her quite close under the dark side of the green
  tangle, without her being aware.</p>

  <p>At the corner of the last field on the left she vaulted over the low bars.
  Inside a figure rose into the moonlight and a voice whispered her name:</p>

  <p>"Pen!"</p>

  <p>She was horribly startled. "Drop down again!" she whispered sharply.
  "Don't come after me until I am half way across the field."</p>

  <p>He obeyed sullenly. Pen walked on across the field with a sore heart. She
  had made him angry now. All day she lived for the moment of meeting and now
  it was spoiled.</p>

  <p>She headed diagonally across the field to that point in the woods which
  was nearest his camp. She could walk but slowly because the ground was so
  rough, old corn land that had been allowed to go to grass with the hills
  unharrowed. She would not look back until she was nearly across. A man's
  figure was rising over the swell of the field behind her. Anxiety attacked
  her. Suppose it was not Don but somebody who had followed her down the road.
  What would Don do? She dreaded to hear the sounds of a struggle, Don could
  take care of himself of course, but it would be the end of their secret. So
  well had that secret been kept that not one of all the searchers at Broome's
  Point now suspected that Don was still on the estate.</p>

  <p>Pen waited alongside the fence that bounded the far side of the field. It
  was Don, so her anxiety was relieved on that score. But he did not come to
  her. A few yards away he leaned back with his elbows on the top rail of the
  fence and gazed out across the moonlit field, making a perfect silhouette of
  masculine soreness.</p>

  <p>"I brought you some supper," ventured Pen.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he said ungraciously.</p>

  <p>"Won't you eat?"</p>

  <p>"Not hungry, thanks."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" she asked with a touch of defiance. She could not be
  meek, even with him.</p>

  <p>"You spoke to me like a dog!" he burst out. "Down Fido!"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she murmured. "But you startled me so. You see I was thinking
  maybe someone was following me in the road."</p>

  <p>"I just went a little way to meet you," he grumbled. "Nice welcome I
  got!"</p>

  <p>Having said she was sorry, Pen could not humble herself further. She
  remained silent.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're thinking I'm a thankless beast," he went on
  presently.</p>

  <p>"No," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"Well I am!" he said. "I appreciate what you do for me. Good God, that's
  just the trouble. You heap favors on me! You've got me on the rack!"</p>

  <p>They had been over this so often!</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm sick of it, too," Pen burst out as bitterly as he. "You're
  always trying to make out that I do things for you just to make you feel
  inferior! I hate to be benevolent. I never am. But what else could I do under
  the circumstances? Or you? Why can't you take it for granted?"</p>

  <p>"You mean you'd do as much for anybody?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>This of course in his perfect inconsistency, hurt him worse than what had
  gone before. He dug his chin into his breast and relapsed into silence.</p>

  <p>Pen yearned over him. She loved him so for his male roughness, his
  wrongheadedness, his school-boy pride. He was so absolutely different from
  herself, both weaker and stronger. It was circumstances which had given her
  the advantage over him; he was in a false position. She exulted in it a
  little however she might protest to the contrary. It is sweet to have the
  ascendancy, even in love. And she could dimly foresee other circumstances in
  which she would be most terribly at his mercy.</p>

  <p>She made overtures. "I'm hungry," she said.</p>

  <p>But the storm was still brewing in his breast. "A couple more days of this
  and I'll go clean off my head!" he said savagely.</p>

  <p>"How about me?" said Pen.</p>

  <p>"You don't have to squat under the bushes all day."</p>

  <p>"I have other troubles."</p>

  <p>"I have things to bear that you don't know anything about. I have never
  spoken of it."</p>

  <p>Instantly Pen, who had been feeling so pleasantly sure of herself, turned
  hot with jealousy. There was some other woman out in the world. Of course
  there would be! He was tormented because he couldn't communicate with her.
  Because he couldn't assure her of his innocence. How could she find out about
  her for sure?</p>

  <p>"If you'd tell me what it is," she said, schooling her voice, "perhaps I
  could help."</p>

  <p>"Not in this matter," he said with a bitter little laugh.</p>

  <p>Then she was miserably sure. Nevertheless she persisted, as the
  nightingale is supposed to press her breast against a thorn. "I've often
  wondered why you don't allow me to write to some of your best friends. Those
  you can trust I mean. The letters could be worded in such a way that they'd
  mean nothing if they fell into the wrong hands."</p>

  <p>"I've no one to write to," he said.</p>

  <p>Pen thought: "Of course he wouldn't trust another woman to write to her,"
  and was exquisitely unhappy.</p>

  <p>"Any news?" Don asked gloomily.</p>

  <p>"No," said Pen. She had previously determined not to raise his hopes by
  telling him about Blanche Paglar until something had come of it.</p>

  <p>There was a long silence between them, and Pen became wretcheder and
  wretcheder. When she could stand it no longer she put the bag down beside the
  fence and said in an offhand tone:</p>

  <p>"Well ...I must be getting back...I'll come again to-morrow night."</p>

  <p>She started to walk away with her sedate air, but a little quicker perhaps
  than would suggest perfect calmness.</p>

  <p>Before she had taken three steps he came after her. Pen broke into a run.
  He overtook her. Ah! if he had only taken her in his arms! But he only
  circled about her, spreading out his arms to bar her way.</p>

  <p>"Pen, <i>Pen</i>, don't leave me!" he said imploringly. "That would be the
  last straw!...Don't leave me to brood over my own hatefulness."</p>

  <p>The pain in his voice arrested her. She forgot her own pain. As in a flash
  she had a clairvoyant glimpse of what he must be going through day after day,
  the resolute young man compelled to skulk in the woods, while his name was
  bandied about with the stigma of murder upon it.</p>

  <p>"I'm a fool!" she said with a shaky little laugh. "To get sore...I won't
  go."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Pen, you're so good to me!" he groaned. "I'm a stubborn brute, Pen, I
  can't thank you properly. But Pen, I feel as if you were heaping a load on me
  that I'd never be able to struggle from under! But I ought not to feel that
  way, Pen."</p>

  <p>Ever since he had got hold of that little name he could scarcely address
  five words to her without using it, and every time he spoke it he caressed
  it. Pen was reassured.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about how you ought to feel," she murmured. "Much better for
  us to quarrel than to make pretenses to each other. Besides a lot of that
  talk about doing things for people and earning their gratitude is false. A
  person has really no right to put another person under a debt of
  gratitude."</p>

  <p>"The truth is, I'm afraid of you," he grumbled.</p>

  <p>It was delicious to her to have him softened and faltering like this. "I'm
  afraid of you, too," she confessed. "How silly we both are!"</p>

  <p>For a moment or two they were wildly and unreasonably happy, standing
  there in the bland moonlight close together but not touching. His face was in
  the shadow but Pen could feel his eyes stabbing her out of the dark. Her own
  went down. They were like reeds shaken in the same gust. In that moment Pen
  knew that whatever bonds might be upon him out in the world, he was hers.
  Still he did not speak; he did not draw her to him. In the end she had to
  wrench herself away from the magnetic attraction of his body, or else she
  must have flung herself into his arms.</p>

  <p>"Let's walk," she said hurriedly. "We're safe enough in this
  out-of-the-way corner. You must need exercise. We'll circle round the field.
  Over in the corner there's a path leading down to an arm of Back creek where
  Dad keeps his boat in the winter."</p>

  <p>Don came down to earth with a sigh. He had a curious way, when his
  thoughts annoyed him, of shaking his head like a dog, to clear it. Without
  saying anything he tied the jute bag to an overhanging branch out of reach of
  four-footed prowlers, and came along with Pen.</p>

  <p>They kept to the fence line, silent for the most part. Their breasts were
  oppressed by moonlight, that high, pure medium which nevertheless stirs us so
  poignantly. The moon herself is all very well in her way, a lovely lamp in
  the dark, but one can stare at the moon all night without being transported.
  One must turn one's back on the moon to experience her magic. It is the
  strange light she casts on the face of our mother Earth, and Earth's smile
  under moonlight, soft, subtle and infinitely suggestive, that thrill us, that
  disquiet us, that unlock our spirits. On the one hand as they walked the
  field lay spread with a bloomy, gossamer coverlet of moonlight; on the other
  hand the swelling tree masses rose in rich velvety blackness under a lazulite
  sky.</p>

  <p>Their two shadows soberly preceded them, always with a narrow space of
  moonlight between. Pen resented that little gap. She had forgotten about the
  supposed other woman, or if she remembered she no longer cared. She lived in
  the moment only; there was no more past, no future. She was in the grip of
  sensations that scarcely permitted her to breathe. Yet she had to conceal
  from him those sighs with which she sought to relieve her breast. Sometimes
  she fell behind a step just for the satisfaction of looking at him without
  his knowing, at the way his hair curled at the nape of his neck, at his flat,
  straight back, at the curious grace of his level walk. He was wearing an old
  pair of trousers and a shirt of khaki that she had brought him as being less
  conspicuous in the woods than his own white clothes. The thin garments
  betrayed his beauty to her.</p>

  <p>The moon was high in the sky and their shadows were short at their feet.
  Pen beheld a curious thing. The dewy grass refracting the strong moonlight
  made a silvery nimbus around the heads of the two of them.</p>

  <p>"Look!" she said with her shaky little laugh. "We've been canonized."</p>

  <p>"Not me," he said. "They just let me walk under your halo."</p>

  <p>Having circled round two sides of the field, they climbed over another
  pole gate and were swallowed up in the woods. Instantly the silence wrapped
  them as in a cloak, and the heavy air became charged with a curious
  significance. High over head they glimpsed the moon pacing with them over the
  tree-tops. She splashed the trunks fantastically, and occasionally lay down a
  bar of silver on the path, but for the most part the underworld was black,
  black, black; a crouching blackness that held its breath as if in preparation
  for a spring. The path was well-beaten but narrow. They had to walk in single
  file. Pen ahead.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you're here," murmured Pen.</p>

  <p>"It's a fearsome sort of place," he said. "It was not like this the other
  night we walked through the woods."</p>

  <p>"These woods have not been cut out," said Pen. "The old presences have
  never been disturbed."</p>

  <p>Finally the path with a sharp turn brought them abruptly out under the
  open sky again. It was as if something had been lifted off their heads. They
  had come to a low bank at the head of a straight, narrow arm of water thrust
  into the heart of the pines. A great bird arose from below them and passed
  away like a shadow with a soft swishing of wings. The path ended in a shaky
  little wharf with a single plank laid upon it. They stepped gingerly out upon
  it hand in hand, and stood looking down the reach. The South wind passed high
  above their heads and the surface of the water was perfectly unruffled.</p>

  <p>At the moment the moon was looking down the straight arm so squarely one
  might have said she had cleft the opening herself with her silver blade of
  light. Down at the end of the narrow arm they had the sense of a wider body
  of water running at right angles, a pearly, fairy-like strait. On the point
  which separated the two bodies of water stood a little white house gleaming
  wanly in the moonlight. In a window of the house, a curious note in that
  dreamy world of opal and pearl, shone an insistent yellow light.</p>

  <p>"Surely real people can't live there," murmured Don.</p>

  <p>"The worst kind, unfortunately," said Pen. "That's where the oystermen go
  to get drunk."</p>

  <p>They retraced their steps up the bank. When they trod firm earth again,
  Pen repossessed herself of her hand.</p>

  <p>"Where now?" asked Don.</p>

  <p>"There's no place to go but back."</p>

  <p>"Not yet," he pleaded. "Let's stay here awhile. There's plenty of time.
  There are no mosquitoes tonight."</p>

  <p>An old skiff had been dragged up on top of the bank and turned over.</p>

  <p>"Sit here," he urged.</p>

  <p>Blaming herself for her weakness, she sat upon it with her hands in her
  lap. The moonlight was strong upon her. There was a wall of undergrowth at
  her back. Her face and hands stood out against it sharply. Don dropped to the
  ground at her feet.</p>

  <p>"It's damp there," she objected.</p>

  <p>"Can't see you when I sit beside you," he said. "I can from here. With
  only your face and hands showing out of your black dress you look like a
  spirit."</p>

  <p>"A lost spirit!" she said with her little laugh.</p>

  <p>"Oh Pen!" he said in distress. "Why should you be unhappy?"</p>

  <p>"I hate the moon!" she said. "It makes a fool of me!"</p>

  <p>His touch of sympathy unnerved her. That and the glamorous destructive
  light that would not let her breast be. The last of her defenses collapsed.
  In spite of herself the tears welled up in her eyes and brimmed over. She
  lowered her head to hide them, but he caught the sparkle of the drops as they
  fell. It electrified him. He scrambled to his knees.</p>

  <p>"Pen! Pen!" he whispered brokenly.</p>

  <p>She covered her face with her hands. He dragged them down, and crushed
  them under his own hands on her knees.</p>

  <p>"Pen!" he gasped. "It breaks my heart to see you! What is the matter?"</p>

  <p>She strained away from him. "Nothing!" she said crossly. "I'm not the sort
  that cries!"</p>

  <p>"But you're crying now. I see your tears!"</p>

  <p>"It's nothing. I'm just nervous. Don't notice me."</p>

  <p>"Oh Pen, I love you so!" he groaned. "It kills me to see your tears!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a kind of horror.</p>

  <p>He dropped his head in her lap. "There it's out!" he groaned. "All evening
  I've been fighting against it. Every night I've been with you. I swore I
  wouldn't tell you. But here I am...just like a baby. God knows I'll regret it
  to-morrow!"</p>

  <p>"But why?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"Because it drives me wild to think of bringing unhappiness into your
  life. I'd sooner jump off the wharf yonder. It's unmanly to tell you
  now!"</p>

  <p>"Blessed unmanliness!" whispered Pen, brooding over him.</p>

  <p>Presently she jerked her head up as if she needed more air, more light.
  The moon shone in her wet face. It was transfigured.</p>

  <p>He was still humbled over her knees. "This isn't the way I wanted to come
  to the woman I love," he said bitterly. "I've nothing to offer you...less
  than nothing..."</p>

  <p>"Do you want to buy me or to love me," she murmured with soft
  reproach.</p>

  <p>He scarcely heard her. "It is impossible for you to respect a man who is
  as dependent on you as a baby!"</p>

  <p>Pen put her cheek in his hair. "Foolish one! What has respect to do with
  it?"</p>

  <p>"You can only be sorry for me!"</p>

  <p>Her hands turned over and found his face. "Foolish! Foolish! Foolish!" she
  murmured. "You must have got your idea of loving out of books!...How selfish
  you are!"</p>

  <p>He raised his head, struck by the word.</p>

  <p>Her voice deepened. "Don't you understand how sweet it has been for me to
  work for you; to lie for you; to steal food out of the house? Why do you
  begrudge it to me?...Oh, sometimes I could almost wish you <i>had</i>
  committed a murder so I could go with you and be disgraced with you!"</p>

  <p>"Pen!...Pen!" he cried amazed and full of delight. Then added quaintly in
  a voice of reproof: "You're talking wildly!"</p>

  <p>Pen laughed deep in her throat. She slipped off the boat to the ground
  beside him, where she could wreathe her arms about him, and hide her face on
  his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You're only a man," she murmured laughing and passionate. "What do you
  know about love?...Ah, but only let me love you and I will be content!"</p>

  <p>"You'll see whether I can love or not," he said, piqued.</p>

  <p>"Keep telling me," she murmured. "My ears are starving for it!"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you to order," he grumbled, manlike. "It must come of
  itself."</p>

  <p>But she knew from the timbre of his voice, from his arms, from the adoring
  droop of his head, and was content.</p>

  <p>He held her a little away from him that he might see her better. Pen
  yielded up her soul to him through her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Good God! how beautiful you are!" he whispered sharply.</p>

  <p>Their lips came together. They achieved forgetfulness.</p>

  <p>Even lovers must come back to earth. Pen drew away from him. "The dawn
  will surprise us," she murmured.</p>

  <p>He consulted his watch. "Only half-past two."</p>

  <p>"We must go."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! no!"</p>

  <p>"Well, we must begin to go," she amended. "I can't leave you quickly."</p>

  <p>She sat on the ground as Diana must have sat, her legs folded against her,
  her waist curving to preserve her equilibrium, both round arms up and her
  fingers busy with her hair.</p>

  <p>"How beautiful you are so," he murmured. "Don't move!"</p>

  <p>She laughed. "Help me up," she commanded, extending him her hands.</p>

  <p>As he pulled her to her feet he was for enfolding her again, but she put
  her hands up between them. "Not now! I want to get away from you a
  little."</p>

  <p>"Pen!" he cried reproachfully.</p>

  <p>She laughed. "Dearest! I just mean you have numbed me...I must get away
  from you in order to realize you."</p>

  <p>"You soon have enough of me," he grumbled.</p>

  <p>"Somebody must be the first to stop."</p>

  <p>"But you do love me, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Not always in the same way."</p>

  <p>"You do! You do! I know it now!"</p>

  <p>"Then why worry?...Come, it's a long way back. We can talk as we go."</p>

  <p>"But wait a minute. Pen. No, I won't touch you if you don't want me to...I
  want to tell you something. Oh, If I could only tell you right!...What this
  wonderful thing means to me!"</p>

  <p>"Sh! Dearest! It can't be told. It simply can't!"</p>

  <p>"But I must try."</p>

  <p>"You're not sorry then that you told me?"</p>

  <p>"No, by God! I don't deserve this...but I'm not sorry. That was just
  childish pride...If you really are the better man of the two I might as well
  make up my mind to it!"</p>

  <p>Pen laughed. "But I'm not!...Oh, my tongue is quicker than yours. I can
  tangle you all up in words. But you have a simplicity! I sit at your
  feet!"</p>

  <p>"Pen!"</p>

  <p>"Come on, I shouldn't have told you that!...Come on, I feel as light as
  air, now!" She whirled around and gave his elbows a little squeeze. "Isn't it
  blessed to be relieved of that horrible constraint that lay on us." She was
  off ahead again. "I can say whatever I like to you now without thinking...I
  expect I'll shock you sometimes. I'm no lady!"</p>

  <p>"I guess I can stand it," he said grinning.</p>

  <p>Pen had a hundred questions to ask as they went. The most trifling details
  of his childhood were important to her.</p>

  <p>"Have you any photographs of yourself as a child?" she asked eagerly. "How
  I should love them!"</p>

  <p>"All ages," he said lightly. Suddenly his voice became embittered. "I
  suppose they're in the hands of the police."</p>

  <p>"We'll get them back!" said Pen confidently.</p>

  <p>He stopped in the path. "Good God, Pen! <i>What is before us?</i> I had
  forgotten it!"</p>

  <p>"You are going to clear yourself."</p>

  <p>"But if I shouldn't be able to?"</p>

  <p>"Whatever happens to you, I share it," she said quickly.</p>

  <p>"But I've got to take care of you!"</p>

  <p>Ignoring this, she resumed her questions. Gradually she drew him back into
  a lighter mood.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you any brothers and sisters Don?"</p>

  <p>"No, I was an only child."</p>

  <p>"I, too. It's unnatural. I mean to have four."</p>

  <p>He pulled her to him. "Oh, my Pen!" he said a little hoarsely. "My heart
  almost stops beating at the thought!"</p>

  <p>She freed herself. "Bear!" she said. "I didn't invite you to assist me in
  bringing up my family!"</p>

  <p>"You've got to have some assistance," he said wickedly.</p>

  <p>She changed the subject. "I suppose you've been in love dozens of times,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"Not like this. Flirtations."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the last time is always the only time," she said mockingly.</p>

  <p>"Well, how about yourself?" he parried.</p>

  <p>"Not a flirtation!" said Pen ruefully. "Not the least little bit of a one.
  Only dreams."</p>

  <p>"The men were afraid of you," said Don sagely, "It takes courage to make
  up to a girl like you."</p>

  <p>"Conceit!" said Pen..."Tell me about your flirtations."</p>

  <p>"I forget," he said warily.</p>

  <p>"Well, the first one. You couldn't forget that."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't mean to tell you," he said coolly. He groped for his words.
  "You're the only woman who ever mattered a damn to me. If you don't know that
  now, you will know it...And it isn't that I want to make myself out any
  better than I am. Pretty poor average sort...But I won't tell you. I have a
  feeling that you're the sort to bedevil me into telling you things with a
  laugh, and then store them up and brood over them and magnify them."</p>

  <p>Pen sent him a curious glance through her lashes. "Good gracious! You're
  cleverer than I thought!" she said in a tone divided between mockery and
  pique.</p>

  <p>By the time they got out of the woods the moon had traveled a good bit
  towards the West. Now it almost hung over the taller splotch of black that
  marked the trees surrounding the big house.</p>

  <p>Don said: "Every night as soon as it grows dark I come out of my hole and
  lean on the fence and watch the house and wonder what you are doing inside.
  Why is it I never see a light in any of the windows facing this way?"</p>

  <p>"It just happens that none of those rooms are used," Pen said. "In the
  main house the back drawing-room and the guest room have windows facing this
  way, and in the kitchen wing there is the back kitchen and two servants'
  rooms upstairs...After this every night I'll put a light in one of the
  servants' rooms to tell you all is well. And when it goes out you'll know I'm
  starting. And if it goes out and comes on again you'll know I'm prevented
  from coming."</p>

  <p>"That would be bad news," he said.</p>

  <p>"We might get up a regular code of signals," Pen went on. "Suppose there
  was danger, and I couldn't come to warn you. Suppose I wanted to tell you to
  change your camp."</p>

  <p>"We'd have to fix on some spot beforehand so you would know where to find
  me."</p>

  <p>"That's the difficulty. I don't know any place safer than this. What place
  would be safe if they took it into their heads to search the woods?...There
  is a safe place though, that I have thought of."</p>

  <p>"Where's that?"</p>

  <p>"In the house itself."</p>

  <p>"What!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"If I could once get you inside we could snap our fingers at them."</p>

  <p>"How about the servants?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't tell them. Aunt Maria never goes upstairs. I tend to the
  upstairs myself. The third floor of the house is never visited at all."</p>

  <p>"Oh Pen, I couldn't!"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"To hide behind your skirts like that!"</p>

  <p>"I thought you were going to drop that nonsense."</p>

  <p>"It dies hard!" he groaned.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you're so reluctant to come to my house where I could see you as
  much as I wanted," she said sorely, "I won't ask you unless I am forced
  to...But if it should be necessary...Listen!...I'll put a light in each of
  the rooms over the kitchen. If you see two lights shining this way you are to
  hide all your things as well as you can, and come to the house."</p>

  <p>"Where would I meet you?"</p>

  <p>"I won't meet you outside. It would double the risk for the two of us to
  try to get into the house together. Listen! Make your way over the fields
  without going near the road. Give the negro cabin a wide berth. When you are
  abreast of the big house strike for the evergreen hedge that bounds that side
  of the grounds. You'll find a gap in it, broken by the wind. You know how the
  porch runs around three sides of the main building. At the end of the porch
  on that side there's a rough clump of mock orange bushes. Behind the bushes
  you'll find a way into the cellar. That's how I go and come. I'll be waiting
  for you in the cellar. Or if I'm not there wait till I come."</p>

  <p>"Oh Pen, I hate skulking!"</p>

  <p>"I love it!" said Pen. "If I know I'm in the right. It's an
  adventure!"</p>

  <p>They came to the tree where they had left the grass bag hanging.</p>

  <p>"Well..." began Pen.</p>

  <p>Don swung her around inside his arm. "Oh my Pen, how can I let you go
  to-night?" he groaned.</p>

  <p>"Ah, don't kiss me any more," she pleaded. "I don't want to be drowned
  again. I want to know I'm loving you."</p>

  <p>"But I must before I lose you!"</p>

  <p>She laid restraining hands on his arms. "Listen, dear," she murmured.
  "There's something I want to tell you. From the very bottom of my heart it
  comes. I love you so much you can make me your slave if you want. But you
  should have pity on me. You should help me to keep myself separate. For both
  our sakes. If sometimes I seem perverse and tricksy to you it is only because
  of the desperate need I have to keep something of myself back. If I become
  swallowed up in you as most women do in their men you'll tire of me. I'll
  lose my flavor for you. Let me give myself to you a mouthful at a time. Don't
  swallow me whole!"</p>

  <p>He but dimly understood her. "I'll try!" he said between a laugh and a
  groan. "You funny darling child!...But how can I keep from kissing you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want you always to keep from it," Pen said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="VII"
     id="VII"></a>VII. &mdash; THE TRIP TO TOWN</h2>

  <p class="first">ON Tuesday morning Pen, dressed for town, was breakfasting
  with her father in the high-ceilinged, shabby dining-room.</p>

  <p>The elder Pendleton pushed his plate from him and with an ostentatiously
  careless air, took a packet of crisp bills from his breast pocket and
  commenced to count them. It was hard to get any change out of Pen, but this
  time she laid down her fork and frankly stared.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get it?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>Pendleton exulted in the effect he was creating. He had rehearsed an
  answer to the inevitable question. "I didn't steal it, my dear."</p>

  <p>Pen refused to be diverted. "Where did you get it?"</p>

  <p>"I sold some lots."</p>

  <p>"To Mr. Riever?"</p>

  <p>"None other."</p>

  <p>"Oh, how could you?" she cried involuntarily.</p>

  <p>"And why not, I should like to know?" he demanded, up in arms immediately.
  Clearly his conscience was bad, though he appeared to have reason on his
  side.</p>

  <p>Pen was helplessly silent.</p>

  <p>"I consider it an excellent stroke of business every way," Pendleton went
  on, puffing a little. "It secures his interest in the railway."</p>

  <p>"He has no interest in the railway."</p>

  <p>"Then why should he buy the lots?"</p>

  <p>"He's buying you."</p>

  <p>Pendleton gave the bills a flirt. "Well I didn't sell myself too cheap,"
  he said with maddening complacency.</p>

  <p>Pen fumed in silence.</p>

  <p>Pendleton began to count off some of the bills. "I want you to take some
  of this," he said.</p>

  <p>"What for?" said Pen.</p>

  <p>"To replenish your wardrobe."</p>

  <p>"Not a cent!" said Pen indignantly. Reflecting that she was betraying too
  much heat she added: "I have plenty of clothes for down here."</p>

  <p>"Your summer dresses that you make yourself are very pretty, very pretty,"
  said Pendleton mollifyingly. "But sure you must be in want of the expensive
  little appurtenances of a lady's wardrobe; shoes, silk stocking, hats,
  parasols."</p>

  <p>"What would I be doing with a parasol at Broome's Point?" demanded Pen
  with a snort of scorn.</p>

  <p>"A smart yachting suit would be nice," he said suggestively.</p>

  <p>But Pen looked at him so dangerously he made haste to add: "But of course
  you know best. You know best!"</p>

  <p>"Put the money up," said Pen brusquely.</p>

  <p>"But my dear...!"</p>

  <p>"I refuse to dress myself at Mr. Riever's expense. The idea is
  revolting."</p>

  <p>"You will have to have money in town to-day."</p>

  <p>"I have a little. Enough to buy a pair of white shoes, and materials to
  retrim my last summer's hat. That will have to do."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you have to go against your obvious interests," he
  complained.</p>

  <p>Pen looked at him levelly. "Let's be frank with each other, Dad. If you
  have any notion of Mr. Riever and I making a match of it, I beg that you will
  put it out of your head. The idea is preposterous!"</p>

  <p>It made him writhe to have his secret wish dragged out into the crude
  light like this, nevertheless he was bound to fight for it still. "Why is it
  preposterous?" he demanded bridling. "He wouldn't be stooping to you?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I consider that I'd be stooping!" said Pen with her chin up.</p>

  <p>He ignored it. "It's only an accident that we are poor. Remember your
  grandfather had his place at Newport when his grandfather was still swinging
  a pick!"</p>

  <p>"That's only an accident, too," said Pen. "You miss the point. The
  question is not altogether whether he wants me, but whether I want him."</p>

  <p>Pendleton refused to take her seriously. "Oh, the fatal Broome pride!" he
  murmured.</p>

  <p>"He's a divorced man," said Pen wickedly. Her father held strong views on
  the subject.</p>

  <p>"We must not judge," said Pendleton blandly. "Circumstances alter cases.
  He may have been more sinned against than sinning."</p>

  <p>Pen smiled wryly. She did not particularly blame her father. It was at
  poor human nature that she was smiling.</p>

  <p>Encouraged by her silence he went on loftily: "Pride is an excellent thing
  in its way. But it becomes suicidal when you allow it to blind you to..."</p>

  <p>Pen bluntly interrupted him. "I wouldn't marry Mr. Riever if he was the
  last man on earth!"</p>

  <p>She saw, however, that Pendleton was entirely unconvinced.</p>

  <p>Presently she said: "I suppose it is useless to ask you to return that
  money?"</p>

  <p>By the way his hand closed over it, by the look of irresponsible cupidity
  that appeared in his eyes, she saw that it was indeed useless.</p>

  <p>"Then it ought to be used for necessary repairs to the place," she went
  on. "If we're going to continue to live here, the house must be painted, the
  roof and the porches mended. Modern implements ought to be got for the
  farm."</p>

  <p>"I will consider all that," he said loftily.</p>

  <p>"Better let me take it to town and deposit it," said Pen. "It will make
  too much talk if you put it in the Island bank."</p>

  <p>He shook his head obstinately. "It will improve our credit locally."</p>

  <p>Pen shrugged and let the matter drop. After all she was not implicated.
  Men must be left to follow their own blind ways, she told herself.</p>

  <p>At eight o'clock an automobile was at the door. Riever's people having had
  the worst places in the road mended at his expense, had brought this car down
  the Neck for his use around the Point. The millionaire resented having to put
  foot to the common earth any more than he could help&mdash;or perhaps it
  would be more correct to say that his entourage resented it. Riever, like all
  potentates, was largely at the mercy of his entourage. The <i>Alexandra</i>
  was crowded with "friends," secretaries, servants and persons of undefined
  status whose sole object in life lay in maintaining Riever's unacknowledged
  state. Three-quarters of Pen was appalled at the existence of such a
  situation in a democratic country, but the remaining quarter of her found it
  undeniably pleasant to share in his state. Everything about Riever moved with
  so beautiful a precision.</p>

  <p>For instance, she was carried down to the old steamboat wharf which had
  likewise been mended. As the automobile turned in front of the wharf the
  speed-boat drew alongside with Riever in it. They leaped to the Island. As
  they stepped out of the boat, before them was the car to take them to town,
  waiting with its engine running. Pen saw at once that it was not one of the
  ordinary cars used to carry Riever's mail back and forth, but a vehicle
  imported for this occasion. It was an astonishing car of foreign make, long
  and rakish in line with an immense aluminum engine hood and a smart,
  diminutive, coupe body. In other words, it represented unimagined power to
  carry around two little plutocrats; the last word in luxury. The driver rode
  outside.</p>

  <p>It was Pen's first ride in a superlative car. The springs were miraculous.
  One was but faintly aware of wheels underneath. The body swam along as
  smoothly as a high-bred lady, only curtseying slowly now and then to a rut.
  It was all slightly unreal to Pen. As they whirled through the village she
  had glimpses of the staring Islanders. It was only too clear what they were
  thinking. When an Island boy and his girl went to town together they
  generally came home married.</p>

  <p>It was a clear fresh morning. Pen would have loved to lean back in her
  cushioned corner and give herself up to the flying panorama through the
  windows. Nowadays there are few roads left like that in our country. The
  prospect was of a peaceful, long-settled land with nothing garish nor raw;
  not a factory, not a railway, not a rich man's house the whole way. But miles
  of pine woods, many old farms, a sleepy village now and then, glimpses of the
  blue Bay from high land; a rickety bridge over an arm of the Bay.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately Riever wanted to talk. It wore Pen out to talk to him
  because she couldn't be frank. Real frankness was unknown to Riever, though
  he could be amusing. His eyes never lost their watchfulness, nor his lips
  their superficial smile. This morning he was not amusing. For several days
  Pen had been aware that his temper was suffering as a result of the continued
  non-success of his efforts to run down Counsell. To Pen's secret dismay he
  commenced to talk about it now, watching her keenly meanwhile.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of the situation at the Point?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"How do you mean?" asked Pen.</p>

  <p>"Counsell appears to have given us the slip."</p>

  <p>Pen said to herself: "I must be bold. Half measures will never deceive
  him." She said to him calmly; "I hope he has."</p>

  <p>Riever bit his lip. "I wish I knew what it was about murder that appeals
  to women's imaginations," he sneered.</p>

  <p>"About murder, nothing," said Pen coolly. "Not to this woman. But no true
  woman could help sympathizing with a man hunted by a pack."</p>

  <p>"Even if he was guilty of a foul crime?"</p>

  <p>Pen was not to be betrayed into declaring her belief in Don's innocence.
  "Even if he was guilty," she said.</p>

  <p>"Then what about justice?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I fancy a woman's idea of justice differs from a man's. To kill for
  killing gets us nowhere."</p>

  <p>"I thought you thought him innocent," said Riever subtly.</p>

  <p>"How can one tell?" said Pen. "The newspapers are so contradictory."</p>

  <p>"I haven't noticed it," said Riever. "If there's any evidence in his favor
  it hasn't been brought to my attention."</p>

  <p>Pen seeing that she had made a slip, adroitly shifted to new ground.
  "That's just it," she said. "The newspapers are so clearly prejudiced, you
  can't help but feel there is another side to the story."</p>

  <p>"How do you suppose he made his getaway?" asked Riever, still watching
  her. "Every yard of the shore has been searched, every native
  questioned."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he paddled across the Bay," said Pen. "There are convenient
  railways over on the Eastern shore."</p>

  <p>"But we had our men there next day," said Riever. "And the canoe was not
  found. No, somebody must be hiding him."</p>

  <p>"Very likely," said Pen calmly.</p>

  <p>"But there's the reward I offered," said Riever, "You'd think that would
  be tempting."</p>

  <p>"Oh money isn't everything to everybody," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"You think maybe some maiden's fancy has been caught by his good looks?"
  he sneered.</p>

  <p>Pen looked at him full. "Oh, do you think he's good-looking?" she said
  with a little air of surprise.</p>

  <p>He was disconcerted. "I? No! But I'm no judge. At college they seemed to
  think him a regular Ph&oelig;bus Apollo, men and women alike."</p>

  <p>Pen carried the war straight into the enemy's camp. "You did not like him
  at college, did you?"</p>

  <p>"He was nothing to me one way or another," Riever said carelessly. "I
  scarcely ever saw him."</p>

  <p>"Liar!" thought Pen. She said: "I cannot quite understand your attitude.
  Why are you so bent on running him down. Is there an old score to settle
  between you two?"</p>

  <p>In the smooth mask of his face, Riever's eyes were not pleasant to see.
  "No indeed!" he said with a laugh. "I am not revengeful. But Dongan was my
  friend. I owe it to his memory."</p>

  <p>"I appreciate that," said Pen. "Still, to give up everything, and come
  down here yourself. To direct the hunt personally."</p>

  <p>"Delehanty is in charge, not I," said Riever quickly.</p>

  <p>Pen let it go at that.</p>

  <p>"As for coming down here," Riever went on, "that was just an impulse. I
  was so shocked at the moment I could think of nothing else...Perhaps it was
  foolish. But I can't say I regret it because it has made me acquainted with
  you."</p>

  <p>"You are polite," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"It's more than that," said Riever.</p>

  <p>After awhile he said: "You will not be sorry to see us go I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>A glad cry leaped to Pen's lips: "You are going!" But she caught it in
  time. "I sha'n't be sorry to see the last of Delehanty and his crew," she
  said calmly.</p>

  <p>"And the rest of us?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It will be hard to settle down into the old dull routine when you are
  gone," she said.</p>

  <p>"I might come back," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Father and I would always be happy to see you," said Pen demurely.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile they were bowling along the State road at better than forty
  miles an hour, but so smoothly that Pen had no sense of great speed except
  when she happened to catch a glimpse of some astonished face in the road.
  They had a highly accomplished chauffeur at the wheel and the heavy car held
  her speed up hill and down as steadily as a locomotive. Woods, fields and
  villages were thrust behind them with no sense of effort.</p>

  <p>As they drew near to Baltimore Pen began to wonder how she was going to
  get rid of Riever. He saved her the trouble by saying:</p>

  <p>"I have to go to the Hotel Bellevue for a conference. You'll keep the car
  of course, and load your purchases right into it. So much easier."</p>

  <p>Pen would have liked to dispense with the car as well as its owner, but
  did not see how that was to be accomplished plausibly. At any rate she
  reflected, the chauffeur could not follow her into the stores. The main thing
  was to be rid of Riever. But she rejoiced too soon.</p>

  <p>He said: "I'm taking it for granted you'll lunch with me at the Bellevue.
  We breakfasted so early I ordered lunch for twelve-thirty."</p>

  <p>This was awkward.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm sorry!" said Pen. "It will be impossible!"</p>

  <p>This man was not accustomed to be denied what he wanted. The spoiled child
  leaped out of his eyes. "Why?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"So much to do." said Pen. "This is a leisurely town. Not like New York.
  It takes time to be waited on."</p>

  <p>"But you've all afternoon."</p>

  <p>Pen was patient for her. "But think how seldom I get to town. I couldn't
  take an hour or two off for lunch."</p>

  <p>"Make it half an hour then."</p>

  <p>"Please excuse me to-day."</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well," he said in a pet. "Pick me up at the Bellevue whenever
  you are through."</p>

  <p>He was in a hateful temper the rest of the way. When he thought Pen was
  not looking at him his eyes darted sidelong jealous glances at her. Clearly
  his suspicions were aroused, and he was meditating some sort of mischief. It
  was a catastrophe. But Pen did not see how she could have acted
  differently.</p>

  <p>It lacked a few minutes of eleven when they reached town. Riever got out
  at the hotel and Pen went on about her shopping with an anxious breast. What
  would he do?</p>

  <p>She was soon informed on that score. As she proceeded from store to store
  she kept her eyes open about her and became aware finally of a man that
  turned up wherever she went. He was a burly individual dressed in clothes too
  warm for the season, and with an expression of unconsciousness that was
  almost comical in its transparency. Spy was writ large on him. Pen was a
  little appalled by this evidence of her adversary's power. He seemed to be
  able to summon his creatures out of the air. She reflected, however that it
  would be easy enough for Riever to send a man from his mail car down to the
  shopping district to pick up the imported car. There was no other car like
  it.</p>

  <p>Pen made several attempts to lose her follower in the crowds, but without
  avail. He looked like a fool, nevertheless he always succeeded in nosing her
  out like a too faithful dog.</p>

  <p>At noon she took up her stand in front of the notion counter at Douglas'
  with a fast beating heart. Outside the store she had sought to dismiss her
  car, saying she didn't know how long she'd be, but the chauf­feur had replied
  that he'd find a place to park nearby and would wait as long as she liked.
  Had he too, been instructed not to lose her? Inside the store she would not
  look, but she was horribly conscious that the burly spy was somewhere across
  the aisle pretending to examine silver articles. Watched or not, she had to
  keep her appointment. If the girl obeyed instructions all might yet be well.
  There would be nothing strange in her meeting a girl friend in a department
  store. But probably she would not look like a friend. Nevertheless, Pen's
  great fear was that the girl would not come at all. She already felt flat and
  despairing in prospect.</p>

  <p>Pen could not appear to be looking for anybody. With sightless eyes she
  inspected the stock of notions. There were scores of little baskets
  displaying pins, hair-pins, fasteners, tapes, hair-nets, all the
  multitudinous contrivances with which women keep themselves together. It is
  the busiest counter in a department store. Perspiring women elbowed her on
  either hand. An exasperated voice said at her shoulder:</p>

  <p>"If you don't want anything here would you kindly give me room!"</p>

  <p>Pen in a daze, gave way. She was saying to herself: "She'll never come. It
  was a wild scheme. You're only wasting your time..."</p>

  <p>Suddenly a high-pitched, metallic voice beside her exclaimed: "Well of all
  people! How are you?"</p>

  <p>Pen jumped as if the last thing in the world she expected was to be
  addressed. Half a dozen women turned around. Pen seemed to shrivel under
  their glances. But the other girl carried it off well. She was talking
  continually. Pen got a flash of hard, bright black eyes and a brilliant tight
  smile. It disconcerted her. She had expected&mdash;well, some sort of a
  pathetic figure. These eyes expressed an infinite sophistication that seemed
  to open a gulf between them.</p>

  <p>Pen's lapse was but momentary. Out of the tail of her eye she saw a burly
  figure pushing across the aisle, and the emergency nerved her. With an
  automatic reflection of the other girl's manner she began to talk back:</p>

  <p>"Upon my word! Who would ever have expected to find you here?" Without
  changing her smile she murmured: "We're watched. He's coming this way."</p>

  <p>The other girl's eyes signaled: "I get you!" She said loudly: "How are all
  the folks?"</p>

  <p>"Much the same as usual," said Pen.</p>

  <p>The burly one brushed by, his foolish eyes looking everywhere but at them,
  his mouth pursed up to whistle.</p>

  <p>When he had gone by, "Bull" murmured the black-eyed girl out of the corner
  of her mouth. "Pure-bred Jersey." Aloud she said vivaciously: "You must tell
  me all about everybody. Let's get out of this jam."</p>

  <p>With a hand under Pen's elbow, she steered her out of the press. Crossing
  the aisle they struck into a side aisle, deserted for the moment. Here the
  man could not come close enough to overhear their talk without giving himself
  away completely. They could see him loitering in the main aisle uncertain
  what to do.</p>

  <p>The black-eyed girl was an admirable actress. She kept up a running fire
  of questions: "How's Alfred? And the old man? And Maud?"</p>

  <p>Pen's spirits rose fast. It was dangerous, and it was fun. A genuine smile
  replaced the mechanical one. She rattled off some kind of answers, surprised
  at her own talkativeness.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the two were busily sizing each other up, Pen with shy glances,
  the other with bold ones. Pen saw a little creature beautifully formed, very
  pretty too, with petulant, doll-like features, frankly made up. The idea of
  the make-up was not to imitate nature, but to create an original artistic
  effect. She was smartly dressed in a plain black silk slip confined by a
  beaded girdle, Impudent little close-fitting hat, expensive gray slippers and
  stockings. She carried an exotic little beaded bag. She might have been
  anything or anybody almost. It is so hard to tell nowadays. Certainly she did
  not smack of the underworld as Pen imagined it. But Pen perhaps was not much
  of a judge.</p>

  <p>On the other hand Pen could hardly have been mistaken for anything but
  what she was. There was a sort of open reticence in her, a high
  unaffectedness that was in her blood and could not be hidden nor imitated.
  With all her assurance the other girl resented it a little. Without changing
  her outward manner the black-eyed one said:</p>

  <p>"Well, what's the big idea, Miss? I don't get you at all. Are you a bull
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Pen smiling.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you are you're a new type. I know them all. What did you get me
  down among the orioles for? Nobody down here's got anything on me."</p>

  <p>"I want to be your friend," said Pen.</p>

  <p>The other pulled down the corners of her lips mockingly. "Old stuff,
  sister. Every con game that ever was started opened with that. Can the
  friendship. You'll need it next winter. Give it to me straight. What's the
  likes of you doing, trailed by a bull?"</p>

  <p>"It's a long story," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"Well, my hearing's good."</p>

  <p>"If we could get away somewhere..."</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing! No back alley work for me. This is a first-rate public
  situation. Speak your piece."</p>

  <p>"I can't," said Pen helplessly. "There must be confidence between us
  first. You must know that it is something I can't blurt out in a place like
  this."</p>

  <p>The black eyes bored her through and through. Curiosity and suspicion were
  struggling there. It was strongly in Pen's favor, however, that she was being
  tracked by a detective. "Do you live in this town?" the girl demanded.</p>

  <p>"No," said Pen. "I came here to meet you."</p>

  <p>"Are you alone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, I warn you I'm not. If anything is to be tried on, I got a husky
  friend with me."</p>

  <p>Pen, glancing around guardedly, had no great difficulty in picking him
  out&mdash;a nonchalant youth leaning against a bargain counter. He was very
  well dressed in sporting style, topped with an exaggerated flat tweed cap.
  His cheeks were as smooth and pink as a girl's, but the glance of his blue
  eyes was disillusioned.</p>

  <p>"He may look like a boy soprano," said the girl dryly, "but I assure you
  he sings double-bass. It's Babe Riordan, side partner of Spike's, that I
  brought along. Understand wherever I go the Babe goes too."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you propose?"</p>

  <p>"I'd rather leave it to you," said Pen.</p>

  <p>Another lightning-like dart of the black eyes. "Oh!...Well, a room in a
  hotel's the safest place. The leading hotel here is the Bellevue..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, not there," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"He...the man I want to tell you about is there."</p>

  <p>The girl took three steps to a counter where there was a salesgirl
  disengaged. "What's the biggest hotel here next to the Bellevue?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"The Southland."</p>

  <p>"Thanks." She returned to Pen. "Make it the Southland in half an
  hour."</p>

  <p>"But the detective," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"Pooh! He's just out of the egg," said the other with a scornful glance.
  "He's still got his pin feathers stickin' on him. Listen. Babe and I will
  take a room at the hotel and you come call on us, see? That bird couldn't
  follow you up, could he?"</p>

  <p>"No, but he might hear me ask for you at the desk."</p>

  <p>"Don't ask. Listen. Babe will be watching for you in the lobby. He'll be
  sitting there reading a paper. You stroll by him and if everything's all
  right he'll flash a card under the paper with the room number on it, see? You
  get the number in your head and come right up in the elevator."</p>

  <p>Pen could not but admire the little creature's strategy.</p>

  <p>But the black eyes narrowed suspiciously again. "Mind, if there's any
  funny work about this, if there's anybody near you when you come by Babe you
  don't get the room number, see?"</p>

  <p>Pen nodded.</p>

  <p>The little one lifted her voice blithely: "Well ta-ta old girl. Call me up
  some time and we'll make a date to lunch together. Remember me to the
  folks."</p>

  <p>She pattered coolly away in the direction of the burly loiterer, and
  brushed by him with a negligent hand at her black hair. Pen turned in the
  other direction. The detective came after her. As she was about to leave the
  store she saw her opportunity. An elevator door was just about to close. She
  slipped inside and was carried aloft. Her follower had to wait for the next
  car. She crossed the building on an upper floor, came down in a car on the
  other side, and got out of the store without seeing the man again.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later she was knocking at the door of room 1214 in the
  Southland Hotel. The door was opened by one who remained invisible. Pen
  walked in with her heart in her mouth. Blanche was behind the door. She was
  smoking a cigarette. At the sight of Pen's face she laughed.</p>

  <p>"For Mike's sake don't look so scared, sister. Any bull would arrest you
  on suspish with that face. Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"I shook him off in the store," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"Good work!" Blanche seemed disposed to be friendlier, but was still wary.
  She said offhand: "Just to be fair and aboveboard I ought to tell you I carry
  a gun, sister." She held up the little beaded bag. It had no draw-string, and
  she carried it clutched about the neck. When she relaxed her grasp it opened
  wide revealing a wicked little automatic among her make-up.</p>

  <p>Pen shrank back, and Blanche laughed again. "You are a tender sprout!"</p>

  <p>"Is that boy coming up here?" asked Pen anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Sure!"</p>

  <p>"Couldn't I talk to you without him?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing! It 'ud hurt his feelings."</p>

  <p>"I've got things to tell you I couldn't say before a man!"</p>

  <p>Blanche frowned. "Say, you talk like a fillum!" She studied Pen afresh.
  "You don't look dangerous but...Say, you got to give me some line on your
  game or nothin' doin'!"</p>

  <p>"You've got to trust me," said Pen earnestly, "or we've had all our
  trouble for nothing."</p>

  <p>"Trusting's not what I'm good at, sister," said Blanche with a vigorous
  gesture. "You give me some line on your game first. Who the Hell are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Well I'm going to trust you," said Pen. She spread out her arms. "I'm
  Pendleton Broome."</p>

  <p>For once the little creature was shaken out of her uncanny
  self-possession. She whistled like a boy. Her eyes glistened with excitement.
  "The Don Counsell case!" she exclaimed. "You're in that!...Good God! has it
  got anything to do with me...with Spike?"</p>

  <p>"I think it has," said Pen. "That's for you to say when I've told you all
  I know."</p>

  <p>"Well shoot!...shoot!" said Blanche excitedly.</p>

  <p>They heard steps coming along the corridor.</p>

  <p>Blanche laid a hand on Pen's arm. "Maybe it would be just as well if we
  saved Babe's tender ears..."</p>

  <p>Babe himself opened the door and walked in.</p>

  <p>Pen observed at close range that his years probably numbered a few more
  than the eighteen she had at first given him. He was a graceful youth and a
  comely one, but his blue eyes were as hard as china. Both Blanche and the
  Babe had the look of unnatural high school children. Like actors they
  carefully cultivated and played up this infantile effect. The hard eyes of
  the young-old pair afflicted Pen with a kind of despair. How could she hope
  to win such eyes?</p>

  <p>The young man pulled off his cap and bobbed his head in Pen's direction.
  There was something about her that made him distrust his manners. His
  disillusioned eyes suggested that he could be masterful enough with his own
  kind of girl.</p>

  <p>"Our friend here says her tale ain't fit for men's ears," said Blanche
  flippantly.</p>

  <p>The young man scowled without looking at Pen. "What does she take us for,
  a pair of suckers?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm not afraid of her," said Blanche. "I know who she is."</p>

  <p>"Who is she?" he asked, as if Pen were not present.</p>

  <p>"Tell you later when I've heard the whole story."</p>

  <p>He hesitated, scowling.</p>

  <p>"Toddle along!" said Blanche.</p>

  <p>"You're foolish," he muttered.</p>

  <p>The black eyes flashed on him. "That's for me to say!"</p>

  <p>Pen thought with rising hope: "She's beginning to accept me."</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," said Blanche. "I'll satisfy you." To Pen she said
  suddenly: "Put up your hands!"</p>

  <p>"What for?" stammered Pen.</p>

  <p>They jeered at her innocence. "Put up your hands!" repeated Blanche.</p>

  <p>Pen obeyed, and Blanche with flying, practiced hands felt of her all over,
  while the young man stood by. Blanche nodded reassuringly to the Babe.</p>

  <p>"I'll wait outside," he said surlily.</p>

  <p>"Oh, if she wants to mix it up I'll oblige her," said Blanche in her flip
  way. "Though she is bigger than me."</p>

  <p>"I'll wait outside," he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Blanche sarcastically, "and have the maid report you to the
  office as a suspicious character. Go down and read your paper. I'll send a
  boy for you."</p>

  <p>He went.</p>

  <p>Blanche turned mockingly to Pen. "Now, darling!"</p>

  <p>Pen felt dimly that her flippant mockery concealed a sort of despair. She
  could admire the little creature's gameness and hardihood, but could not
  possibly meet her on that ground. It rendered her helpless. Meanwhile Blanche
  took a fresh cigarette, and called Pen's attention to the packet with a jerk
  of her head. Pen shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Well don't stand there like a wax-work in a store-window," said Blanche.
  "Disjoint yourself."</p>

  <p>Pen sat in an armchair with her back to one of the windows. She groped
  within herself for something to go on with. But she felt empty. Blanche moved
  restlessly around the room; plumped herself on the edge of the bed, and
  jumped up again. She glanced at Pen with increasing irritation. Apparently a
  silence drove her wild.</p>

  <p>"You're so different from what I expected," Pen murmured at last, "I
  scarcely know how to begin."</p>

  <p>"What did you expect?" queried Blanche. "A singing canary?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know...I got the idea from the newspaper that you were in
  trouble."</p>

  <p>Blanche stared, then laughed metallically. "Not me!" she said coolly. "I
  wasn't born yesterday."</p>

  <p>Pen perceived the nature of the misunderstanding, and blushed. "I mean, I
  thought you'd lost somebody...that you cared for."</p>

  <p>Blanche bared her teeth suddenly like a hurt animal. "Keep off that!" she
  said sharply.</p>

  <p>"But that's why I wrote to you."</p>

  <p>"Say!" cried Blanche, ugly and callous, "if it's only sob-stuff you're
  after, you come to the wrong shop, see? I don't deal in it! Me, I'm
  water-tight and nickel-plated!"</p>

  <p>"Why can't you be natural with me?" murmured Pen.</p>

  <p>"I am natural. If I wanted to work you for anything, I could turn the
  wringer till the tub overflowed. I'm famous for it. Real tears without the
  aid of the glycerine bottle. But you said you wanted to be on the level."</p>

  <p>"Do I look soft?" challenged Pen.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me," said Blanche, refusing to look at her. "I don't get you at
  all. You're completely outside my experience."</p>

  <p>Pen tried another line. "Have you been reading the newspapers about the
  Counsell case?"</p>

  <p>"Off and on. I've had troubles of my own."</p>

  <p>"Well," Pen said low-voiced&mdash;it cost her an effort to get it out,
  "Don Counsell is to me what I suppose Henry Talley was to you."</p>

  <p>If Blanche was softened she showed it in a sort of back-handed way. "You
  mean Spike," she said. "That's all he answered to."</p>

  <p>Pen's instinct began to show her the way. "How did he get that name?" she
  asked casually.</p>

  <p>Blanche fell into her little trap. She was standing at the other window
  idly twisting the cord of the blind between thumb and forefinger. Her back
  was to Pen. Her voice came muffled and jerky.</p>

  <p>"Because he was so tall. And slender. But not a gowk neither. A peach of a
  figure. Thoroughbred. Stripped he weighed 155, and not an ounce to spare. A
  runner, a swimmer, a boxer; anything that needed speed and wind. And a
  dancer. The best dancer at Steck's pavilion. Everything he did, he did out o'
  sight! Class, too. He could pass anywhere as a college boy or a Wall Street
  broker."</p>

  <p>She suddenly whirled around. "He was a gunman!" she cried defiantly. "Make
  what you like of it! He never asked for the good opinion of the likes of you,
  and neither do I! He was the coolest head of the lot. He went to his mark
  like a bulldog, and nothing could shake him off. What have you got to do with
  the likes of us? What do I care what you think? Both him and me had to fight
  our way since we were kids. We weren't going to take scraps from the tables
  of the rich. We were out to get the best there was for ourselves. We were
  outsiders. Well, the insiders were our enemies, and we went after them!"</p>

  <p>She turned back to the window and began to sob in a hard, dry way that
  scared Pen. The hurrying, toneless voice went on. "To everybody else he was
  cool and smooth as hard enamel. Not to me. He was human to me. Lighthearted
  as a boy when there was no business on hand. You were sure of having a good
  time with Spike. Make you die laughing with his wild, comical ways. He was a
  man. He was real. There was a fire in him...Oh God!"</p>

  <p>She turned and flung herself face down across the bed, her arms hanging
  down the other side. "He's gone! He's gone!" she moaned. "And I'm left!...Oh
  God, I can't bear it!"</p>

  <p>Pen went and sat on the bed, and put a hand on the other girl's shoulder.
  Blanche flung it off roughly. Rolling over, she sat up with her tormented
  face not a foot away from Pen's. Pen did not shrink.</p>

  <p>"You talk about loving a man! I know how your kind loves. Cool and dainty!
  What do you know about loving, brought up good with a home and a family and
  all? Everything provided for you. I never had nothing! Till I got him. He was
  the first who ever belonged to me...I had to fight every inch of my way and
  be on guard every minute. He had to, too, just the same. But we could let
  down with each other! It eased us!"</p>

  <p>She flung herself down in another wild burst of weeping.</p>

  <p>Pen let it wear itself out. "I am just the same as you underneath," she
  murmured.</p>

  <p>Blanche quieted down. In her abrupt way she got to her feet and went to
  the bureau. Emptying out the little beaded bag, she commenced to rub fresh
  color into her cheeks, making strange faces into the glass meanwhile. But the
  tears flowed faster than she could repair the damage.</p>

  <p>"Oh damn!" she cried, throwing down the rouge pad.</p>

  <p>She drifted around the room with her lithe, abrupt movements like a
  diminutive tigress, the baby face all woebegone and hollowed. "Why couldn't
  you leave me alone?" she said crossly. "What'd you want to get me going for!
  Now you know what's inside I hope you're satisfied!"</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the querulous tone Pen saw that she had been accepted as a
  fellow-woman. There was no more strangeness between them.</p>

  <p>"What do you want of me?" Blanche went on. "What good am I to anybody now?
  For two cents I'd fling myself out of the window and end it."</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd want to know what happened to Spike Talley," said
  Pen.</p>

  <p>It had an electrical effect on Blanche. She ran to Pen. "Do you know? Do
  you know? Do you know?" she demanded, moving her little clenched fists up and
  down.</p>

  <p>"I have only a suspicion. We must follow it out together."</p>

  <p>"Well, open it! open it!"</p>

  <p>Her tigerish look gave Pen a fresh fear. "You must promise me
  something!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God! What?"</p>

  <p>"Not to try to take the law into your own hands."</p>

  <p>"What are you trying to protect the man for?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not trying to protect him. I want to bring him into the prisoner's
  dock."</p>

  <p>"Well, I promise," said Blanche unwillingly. "Who was it?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know who Spike Talley was working for when he disappeared?"</p>

  <p>"No!" cried Blanche. "Don't torment me with any more questions. Who was
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I suspect it was Ernest Riever."</p>

  <p>The great name pulled Blanche up short. She stared at Pen with wide
  troubled eyes. "What for?" she whispered hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind very much," Pen faltered, "if I said I suspected that it
  was Spike Talley who shot Collis Dongan?"</p>

  <p>Blanche smiled scornfully. "Not at all," she said coolly. "If it was his
  job," Her eyes widened again. "I begin to get you," she said slowly. "You
  mean Riever hired Spike...and when the job was done...croaked him?"</p>

  <p>Pen nodded.</p>

  <p>"Maybe so," said Blanche somberly. "What do you know?"</p>

  <p>Pen told her. "You see it's next to nothing," she said agitatedly. "They
  wouldn't call it evidence...Just the same <i>I know!</i>...What can you add
  to it?" she implored, clasping her hands.</p>

  <p>Blanche stood with withdrawn gaze like a little statue of abstraction.
  "Not much...right off the bat," she murmured. "But it's a working theory.
  Things can be found out...Funny it never struck me that Dongan was killed the
  night Spike disappeared...I knew Spike was on a job, too...But everybody said
  Counsell did that...I can tell you one thing. It was a rich man Spike was
  working for. One of the richest. He said as much."</p>

  <p>"That's something," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"I knew it was dangerous work, too. Because I heard the price. It scared
  me. And I'm not easy scared. But I couldn't let on...We were going to marry
  on it and go out to California and live like other people. Raise
  things..."</p>

  <p>The tears began to flow again, but Blanche shook her head savagely. "I'm
  not going to cry again! I'm not going to cry any more till I see this
  through!"</p>

  <p>"Can you think of anything else?" begged Pen.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute...It was part of Spike's job to dress up every evening, big
  white shirt front and all, he was crazy about it, he could get away with it
  too...and have dinner at some swell joint..."</p>

  <p>"Could it have been the Hotel Warrington?"</p>

  <p>"That as well as another...Wait a minute...He brought me a menu card to
  show me. The top was torn off with the name of the hotel. But I have the rest
  of it home. Easy enough to find out if that's one of the Warrington
  cards."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes!" said Pen. "Anything else? Oh, think!"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute!...There was something else...Only a little thing...More
  than once Spike mentioned that his boss had elegant whiskey. Said it stood in
  a cut glass bottle on a table, and every time he went there his boss would
  say: 'Help yourself.' That seemed to strike Spike. So friendly from a man
  like that..."</p>

  <p>"Riever is an expert on poisons," said Pen aghast.</p>

  <p>Blanche's little face was like a mask of pain, the lips drawn taut over
  the exposed teeth. "I get you!" she murmured hoarsely. "The last time Spike
  helped himself..."</p>

  <p>The two girls stared at each other.</p>

  <p>Something seemed to click inside Blanche, and instantly she was her
  ordinary wary, hard, self-possessed little self again. She moved towards the
  telephone.</p>

  <p>"I'll send for the Babe," she said. "You can count on him the same as me.
  He looked up to Spike. He's got a good head on him too, for a kid. We'll go
  over everything together, and then the kid and I'll fluff back. In N'Yawk
  there's a dozen young fellows'll help. All pals of Spike's. I'll organize
  them."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="VIII"
     id="VIII"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE RETURN</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was five o'clock and the stores were closing as Pen
  sought for the big car. She picked it out from afar, parked in the double
  rank that lined the Lexington street hill. For five hours it had completely
  passed out of her mind, and she was terrified now of facing the justly
  indignant chauffeur. To be sure she had told him she didn't know how long she
  would be, but five hours!</p>

  <p>But it proved to be nothing in his life. That was how he spent the greater
  part of his days, waiting. It was easier to wait than to drive. He opened the
  door for her with a perfectly good-humored face, and Pen much relieved, asked
  him to drive to the Bellevue.</p>

  <p>She expected another ordeal here. What sort of report would Riever's agent
  have made to his master? Riever was on the lookout for her. Without appearing
  to, Pen studied his face. Little was to be read there, though. The malicious
  smile told her nothing, for she had learned that it was merely a trick of his
  ugly features. Often when his smile was most devilish he was really trying to
  ingratiate himself.</p>

  <p>When he got in, seeing Pen's meager bundles, he said: "Is that all you got
  all day?"</p>

  <p>Pen suspected a thrust, though it was a natural enough remark. "I ordered
  most of the things sent by mail," she said. "It is quicker."</p>

  <p>Before they had gone far Pen discovered that his humor had changed since
  morning. In a clumsy sort of way he was trying to express contrition for his
  ill-temper. He was not the sort of man who could bring out a frank apology.
  Pen wondered. The detective could not have given a disturbing report of her.
  Perhaps in order to conceal the fact that she had given him the slip, he had
  made up a harmless account of her day.</p>

  <p>At any rate Riever was softened. He was less glib. He looked at Pen in a
  new way. He asked her little questions about her day, apparently not with any
  idea of entrapping her, but because he wanted to share in her concerns. Pen
  was much confused by this new aspect of his. It raised unanswerable
  questions. Was it possible that the horrible creature was really touched? How
  could he have a heart? Suppose instead of fighting her he came crawling to
  her feet? How would she meet that situation? It was horrible! horrible! Yet
  she was thrilled with a sense of power too. She could not have any
  compunctions against making Riever suffer. If only she were able to handle
  him! She foresaw breathless danger.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile there they were cooped up together in the luxurious little cab.
  Had it been little Blanche Paglar sitting there beside Riever, her flesh
  would have been quivering with hatred. Pen was not of so simple a
  constitution. Her flesh took no alarm from his proximity. She could look at
  him coolly and speculatively. Her strongest feeling was one of contempt,
  seeing him begin to turn a little abject. He had terrible power, she never
  forgot that, but it was not in himself. There were moments when she found
  herself detached and a little sorry for him.</p>

  <p>But while she was considering him thus dispassionately (they had got out
  in the country by this time) he pulled a little case out of his side pocket
  and snapping it open revealed a slender bracelet of platinum and diamonds
  exquisitely wrought.</p>

  <p>"Will you accept it?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>Pen started as if she had been stung, and a surprising feeling of rage
  welled up in her. She could scarcely speak for it.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't possibly! I couldn't possibly!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't very expensive," he murmured deprecatingly. "I purposely picked
  out something inexpensive."</p>

  <p>Inexpensive! Pen stared at him. The thing had obviously cost thousands.
  But she saw that he was sincere in it.</p>

  <p>"It attracted me," he went on. "It's so hard to find anything that looks
  as if any thought or care had gone into it. That's why I got it."</p>

  <p>"You had no right to suppose that I would accept it," said Pen sorely.</p>

  <p>"I didn't suppose it. I just took a chance."</p>

  <p>Pen was reminded that she <i>must</i> keep on terms with him. "I'm sorry,"
  she said more mildly. "I couldn't possibly."</p>

  <p>"Is it because you detest me so?" he asked with ugly, curling lip.</p>

  <p>Pen was startled. Her anger had betrayed her. She put her wits to work to
  repair the damage. "Not at all!" she said coolly. "It's because you're so
  rich. It sickens me the way people fawn on you, all expecting something.
  That's why I can't take it."</p>

  <p>"You could take it...without being like other people," he said.</p>

  <p>A struggle was going on inside Pen. Not that she wanted the glittering
  bracelet. It was horrible to her. But her cooler self was saying: "You ought
  to take it to put his mind at ease. You can return it later. It is merely
  silly to be high-minded in dealing with a man like this!" But at the
  suggestion of taking it her fingers automatically closed until the nails were
  digging into her palms. It was useless to think of it. She knew that her
  fingers would break sooner than open to receive the little box.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she said. "Please put it away."</p>

  <p>He snapped the box shut and dropped it in his pocket again. For a good
  while he looked out of the window without saying anything. Pen could not read
  his thoughts. She said to herself: "Oh well. It's got to be understood that
  he can't give me things!"</p>

  <p>They dined in Annapolis. Evidently it had been ordered ahead by telephone.
  They were received by an expectant waiter, there were roses on the table, and
  the best that the little town afforded was ready and hot. Pen being a woman,
  could not but be pleased by such attentions, though a mocking little voice
  inside her whispered: "This is how silly women are snared!" She enjoyed the
  food thoroughly, and was charming to Riever, all the while a little dialogue
  went on within. One voice was saying accusingly: "Sitting here smiling and
  encouraging your lover's deadly enemy!" the other replying: "How else can I
  save my lover?"</p>

  <p>It was eight o'clock and beginning to grow dark when they came out of the
  hotel. Pen shivered with repulsion at the thought of being cooped up with
  Riever for the sixty-mile drive through the night. She said offhand:</p>

  <p>"Do you ever drive?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," he said unsuspectingly.</p>

  <p>"Let's put the chauffeur inside and ride out in the air. The moon will be
  up directly."</p>

  <p>Riever scowled, and a hateful answer leaped to his lips. But he bit it
  back. "All right," he mumbled.</p>

  <p>And so they rode.</p>

  <p>He proved to be a skillful chauffeur. There was something quite impressive
  in the nonchalant way he spun the wheel with one hand on a curve. He had a
  bland disregard for speed laws having learned that few constables had the
  temerity to stop so princely an equipage. They went through Camp Parole at
  forty miles an hour, but fortunately without hitting any of the dark-skinned
  inhabitants of that humble suburb. At the green light which marks the W. B.
  &amp; A. station they turned sharply and streaked away to the South to the
  throaty growl of an open exhaust.</p>

  <p>Their conversation was fitful as needs be on the front seat of a speeding
  car. But they were entirely friendly. The episode of the bracelet had been
  forgotten. Both pairs of eyes were hypnotized by the strong path of light on
  the yellow road before them. The bordering leafage was shown up in a queer
  chemical green like stage scenery. The moon came up, but what's moonlight to
  automobilists? The reticent moon disdains to compete with headlights.</p>

  <p>When they were within a few miles of Absolom's Island, Riever glancing at
  the clock under the cowl, said:</p>

  <p>"We've come too fast. I didn't order the boat until 9.45."</p>

  <p>He took his foot off the accelerator and the big car loafed along.
  Relieved of the strain, their eyes were free to wander around. All Riever's
  glances were for Pen's profile. He said abruptly:</p>

  <p>"You're a funny one! One would think you blamed me for having a lot of
  money."</p>

  <p>"Not blame you," said Pen. "Though I think it's unjust somehow. But you
  didn't make conditions."</p>

  <p>"Why is it unjust?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't ask me to argue it with you. I've never thought such things
  out. It's just a feeling I have."</p>

  <p>"If somebody offered you a fortune would you turn it down?"</p>

  <p>"Depends upon the condition attached," said Pen calmly.</p>

  <p>"If there were no conditions."</p>

  <p>"No, I wouldn't turn it down."</p>

  <p>"Good!" he said. "All they say against money may be true, but just the
  same when people make out to despise it they're lying."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"I like to talk to you," he said. "You're real."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Pen dryly.</p>

  <p>"What do you think about me, really?" he blurted out.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"Well, It's true nobody really knows anybody else," he said "I wish I
  could get myself over to you. Since I've known you I've realized more than
  ever what a lot there is missing in my life. Nobody knows me...There's a sort
  of wall cuts me off from everybody."</p>

  <p>It was very confusing to Pen's ideas to discover that a man could be a
  black villain and sentimental too. "Oh, I wish he wouldn't!" she thought
  uncomfortably. Aloud she said rather sharply:</p>

  <p>"Well, it's your own fault, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>He chuckled. "I love the way you come back at me," he said. "...I suppose
  it is my own fault. I ought to climb over the wall. But it's difficult. They
  put me behind it young."</p>

  <p>After awhile he said: "It's a great thought, isn't it, to think of having
  somebody you could be absolutely honest with?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Pen. She was reminded of Blanche and Spike.</p>

  <p>As Riever talked on she began to see how he reconciled villainy and
  sentiment in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Of course it would have to be a person with a strong mind. For when I say
  honesty I don't mean all this sickening cant about goodness and unselfishness
  and meekness that the church hands out. Nobody takes that seriously any more.
  Man is by nature a rapacious animal. Out for what he can get. Well, his
  highest function must be to realize his nature. Therefore I say that the
  highest type of man is the man who gets what he wants regardless."</p>

  <p>Pen thought wonderingly: "He actually looks upon himself as a romantic
  figure!"</p>

  <p>As she made no answer he asked somewhat uneasily: "That's right, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Not for me," said Pen. "Man may be a rapacious animal, but he is also
  capable of controlling his rapacity. And it seems to me it's only by
  controlling it that he can be even decently happy. I've read somewhere that
  beasts of prey always come to a violent end."</p>

  <p>Riever smiled in a superior sort of way. "You're stronger than most
  women," he said with a sneer. "But you can't let go of your religious tags. I
  suppose it's too much to expect."</p>

  <p>Pen only smiled.</p>

  <p>"Now I suppose I've offended you," he said presently.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least!" said Pen.</p>

  <p>"No, you don't give a damn one way or the other," he said sorely.</p>

  <p>Pen laughed. "Nothing I say pleases you!"</p>

  <p>"You please me," he muttered, "but..." The end of his sentence trailed off
  unintelligibly.</p>

  <p>What a queer mixture he was, Pen mused. Arrogance and self-distrust.
  Attempting to strut before her and collapsing at the lift of an eyebrow. She
  failed to take into account the terrible way in which her clear nature struck
  into the dark recesses of the ugly little man's being. He could assert
  himself strongly enough against anybody but her. And the more he was obliged
  to cringe to her, the more he desired her.</p>

  <p>As they bowled over the causeway to the Island Riever said: "I haven't
  given up hope of you, though. You have a natural hatred of sham. I'll teach
  you to face the truth yet!"</p>

  <p>Pen smiled on.</p>

  <p>At the steamboat wharf at the other end of the Island the speed boat was
  waiting, her starboard light a startling gleam of emerald in a dusky gray
  world, her white-clad crew sitting quietly in the moonlight. Pen and her
  packages were handed aboard and they flew for Broome's Point.</p>

  <p>Out on the water the moon indifferently resumed her sway. The whole earth
  was hers to tread on. The front of the island with its odd row of
  semi-detached, whitewashed shacks looked like something as foreign as
  Algiers. In the bow wave that rolled away from the speed boat there was a
  dull phosphorescent glow like saturated moonlight, and looking over through
  the shadow of the boat one could see fishes dart away like little balls of
  pale moonlight. Pen's face was as beautiful and passionless as the
  moon's.</p>

  <p>In the sheltered nook astern the face of Riever the would-be strong man,
  the Devil's advocate, broke up like any calfish boy's. He fumbled clumsily
  for her hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't!" whispered Pen sharply. "They'll see!"</p>

  <p>"What of it?" he mumbled.</p>

  <p>"I won't have it!" said Pen.</p>

  <p>His eyebrows went up in a stare of indignant amazement. Nobody had ever
  spoken to him like that. But as it had absolutely no effect, they gradually
  came down again into the likeness of a sulky schoolboy's.</p>

  <p>"Aw, Pen!"</p>

  <p>She struggled hard with her repulsion. "Well...well...I hate to be
  touched!"</p>

  <p>"One would think there was something the matter with me!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"This is simply weak of you," Pen said cunningly.</p>

  <p>He looked away grinding his teeth.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, as it was but three minutes to the Point, the scene could not
  be prolonged.</p>

  <p>As they drew close to the old wharf they made out that there were a number
  of men upon it with lanterns and flash lights.</p>

  <p>"What's going on there?" Riever asked his steersman.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't say, sir. Everything was quiet when we started over."</p>

  <p>They heard a hail from the wharf: "On board the <i>Alexandra!"</i></p>

  <p>And the answer; "Hello!"</p>

  <p>"Give us some light here, please!"</p>

  <p>The yacht's big search-light was thrown dazzlingly on the end of the wharf
  showing up all the figures in sharp silhouette.</p>

  <p>The speed-boat approached unnoticed from the other side. The instant she
  drew alongside Riever sprang out and ran across. Pen guessed what was
  happening, and her heart seemed to stop and sink like a stone. But she
  followed Riever with a composed face.</p>

  <p>All the men were looking over the other side, their heads down to keep the
  blinding glare out of their eyes. One had a rope with a grappling iron on the
  end of it. He was fishing for something while they all watched. The burly
  figure of Delehanty was conspicuous.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong here?" demanded Riever.</p>

  <p>"Don't know as there's anything wrong, sir. One of the men swimming here,
  said he dived into something suspicious. We're trying to locate it."</p>

  <p>As he spoke the man with the rope said: "I've got it!" And started to haul
  in.</p>

  <p>The green water surged up a little and the curved stem of the canoe rose
  out of it. The valise appeared, tied to a thwart.</p>

  <p>Delehanty's harsh voice cried: "Counsell's canoe, by God! He never went
  away from here!"</p>

  <p>Of one accord all the men turned and looked at Pen. She bore it
  unflinchingly. She disdained to turn away. Riever's face working
  uncontrollably with rage, looked truly devilish. Conscious that he was
  betraying himself, he turned his back sharply to the light.</p>

  <p>When she had given them their fill of looking, Pen turned and commenced to
  walk slowly away.</p>

  <p>"One moment. Miss!" said Delehanty.</p>

  <p>Pen half turned. "I'm going home," she said in a composed voice. "If I'm
  wanted you'll find me there."</p>

  <p>She walked on, taking care not to hurry herself. But her heart was beating
  with a bird's wings.</p>

  <p>"No, you don't!" cried Delehanty, and started after her.</p>

  <p>Riever with an odd, tense spring, caught his arm. There was a whispered
  colloquy, and as a result Delehanty stayed, and Riever went after Pen. The
  little man, tense with passion, had for the first time a sort of dignity. He
  was rather a terrible figure. Pen, hearing his cat-like steps behind her, was
  sorely afraid. He overtook her alongside the automobile that was waiting in
  the road.</p>

  <p>"Will you get in?" he asked in a queer, thick voice.</p>

  <p>Pen reflected that she would be safer in the car with the chauffeur than
  walking up the hill alone. She got in without speaking.</p>

  <p>During the short ride up to the house they exchanged no word. Pen was
  pressed into her corner, Riever into his. He sat as still as an animal, his
  back slightly hunched, his hands on his thighs. Ugly-looking hands he had
  that the moonlight could not dignify: too small for a man, furtive-looking,
  hands acquainted with evil. Pen shuddered at them. When they passed between
  the broken gates and rounded the shrubbery, Pen saw with dismay that all the
  windows of the big house were dark. Her father had gone to bed.</p>

  <p>When the car stopped she jumped out, avoiding Riever's offered assistance.
  Riever said to the chauffeur:</p>

  <p>"You needn't wait. I'll walk back."</p>

  <p>Pen was horribly afraid. Her instinct was to dart through the door, slam
  it in his face, and turn the key. But flight was too abject. If she yielded
  him ascendancy like that, she could never get it back again. She said to
  herself while her teeth chattered: "I'm not afraid of him! I'm not afraid of
  him! If I stand my ground I have nothing to fear!"</p>

  <p>The car went back. Riever stepped up on the porch by the two boxes his
  head sunk. Pen stood there.</p>

  <p>"You tricked me!" he said with a violent gesture, but taking care not to
  raise his voice. "You said he'd gone from here! He's been here ever since!
  You're hiding him now! What did you go to town for today? What was in those
  packages you made me bring home in my car, a disguise for him?"</p>

  <p>Pen was not dismayed by this. On the contrary as soon as he began to speak
  the man lost his curious, animal, impressiveness. Seeing him beside himself,
  Pen began to feel strong again.</p>

  <p>"I left the packages in the boat," she said scornfully. "No doubt by this
  time Delehanty has examined them."</p>

  <p>"What is this man to you?" demanded Riever.</p>

  <p>"I've already told you. No more than any poor hunted creature."</p>

  <p>"If you lied once you can lie again!"</p>

  <p>Pen shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Swear that he's not your lover!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"To <i>you?"</i> cried Pen indignantly.</p>

  <p>"Then he is your lover! You're keeping him close, I daresay. You don't
  shiver when he touches you!"</p>

  <p>A great anger came to Pen's assistance. "You fool!" she cried. "Your
  disgusting money has turned your head! Who do you think you are to speak this
  way to me? I owe you nothing. Neither oaths nor explanations. Nothing!"</p>

  <p>Riever could not stand up under it. His chin sunk, his body twisted. As a
  matter of fact he simply could not face the thought that the man he hated so
  had won the woman he desired. He snatched at any hope.</p>

  <p>"Well ...If you're not hiding him, where is he?" he mumbled.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Far away, I hope."</p>

  <p>"How could he have got away?"</p>

  <p>"He walked up the Neck road while you were searching the shores."</p>

  <p>"Oh God, if I could believe you!" groaned Riever.</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't help you," said Pen. She saw that with every word she was
  regaining the upper hand, and her heart was strong.</p>

  <p>A cajoling note crept into Riever's voice. "Well, you couldn't do him any
  further good by lying. If he's anywhere near we're bound to get him in the
  morning. Within an hour Delehanty'll send a party by boat up to the head of
  Back Creek. They'll form a line across the Neck. At dawn we stretch another
  line across this end and close up. He can't escape between them."</p>

  <p>Pen's heart contracted painfully, but she gave no outward sign. "What are
  you telling me this for?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You can't do him any further good. Leave him to his fate. Tell me where
  he is so I'll know you're on the square with me."</p>

  <p>"It's nothing to me whether you think I'm on the square or not."</p>

  <p>Riever raised his clenched hands in a gesture of impotent rage. "I've got
  to know!..."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't tell you if I knew," said Pen. "I wouldn't betray any man. Not
  you if you were in his place."</p>

  <p>With a painful struggle for self-command he took still another tone.
  "Well, that's all right. I'll say no more about him...But give me a
  pledge!"</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" she said coldly.</p>

  <p>Again the shaking gesture. "I can't stand this!"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you'll have to!"</p>

  <p>His voice became more abject. "Wait a minute! You don't understand. All I
  want is a word. You see how I am suffering. A word from you will end it!"</p>

  <p>Pen was too startled to be angry any more. A terribly dangerous situation
  faced her, and she needed all her wits with which to meet it.</p>

  <p>He took heart from her silence, her apparent uncertainty. "I'm asking you
  to marry me," he said with a touch of his old arrogance. "Do you get it? Mrs.
  Ernest Riever, Think what it means...What do you say?"</p>

  <p>"I won't answer you now," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"You've got to answer me!" he said violently. "I've got to know how you
  stand towards me!"</p>

  <p>She was silent.</p>

  <p>"Look at it as a young fellow would look at a chance to advance himself,"
  he rushed on. It was one kind of love-making. "Look what I have to offer you.
  A place in the sun! A place every living woman would envy you! Isn't that
  sweet to you? And by God! you'd grace it too, with your beauty and your high
  ways. You weren't shaped to wear print dresses, Pen. Think, think what you'd
  be. A sort of queen. A queen without any responsibilities. Carried about like
  a queen wherever you wanted to go, with an army to wait on you. Your
  slightest wish granted!"</p>

  <p>"I don't want to be a queen," murmured Pen a little dizzied by this rush
  of words.</p>

  <p>"Well then, anything you wanted...Do you want to do good? You can have
  whatever sums you want to lay out in good works. Absolutely without limit.
  You can make a name as a philanthropist such as nobody ever had before. You
  couldn't refuse such a chance&mdash;you couldn't!...What do you say?"</p>

  <p>"I will not answer you now," repeated Pen. There was nothing else she
  could say.</p>

  <p>He stared at her as if unable to credit that she should not jump at such a
  chance. "You've got to give me an answer!" he said showing his teeth. "I'm
  going to find out how you stand towards this murderer."</p>

  <p>"Be careful!" cried Pen.</p>

  <p>That cry of hers answered him really, but he would not face it. He became
  abject again. "Well, I'll say no more about him...Suppose you have a sort of
  fancy for him. All right. I'll give you a chance to save him...Marry me at
  once. Come away on the <i>Alexandra</i> with me, and I'll call off the chase.
  I'll withdraw the reward. With me out of it the case against Counsell would
  collapse like a pricked balloon. I couldn't offer fairer than that, could I?
  Come back with me now. The yacht has steam up. Will you? Will you?"</p>

  <p>Pen was shaken. "Would you really take me on such terms?" she
  murmured.</p>

  <p>"Oh God! I'd take you on any terms!" he groaned.</p>

  <p>The thought flew into Pen's brain: "You couldn't trust him!" She
  energetically shook her head. "I won't be rushed into anything."</p>

  <p>"Then I won't ask for a positive answer to-night," he stuttered, "But just
  a sign. Just a sign to show me I'm not hateful to you!...Kiss me, Pen!"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Kiss me, Pen...and I'll hold Delehanty back..."</p>

  <p>She yielded. That is to say she yielded with her mind. But the flesh
  rebelled. He gathered her in his arms taut as a bow-string. As his face
  approached hers she snapped. With a wild, blind reaction she tore herself
  free. No man could have held her. The open door was behind her. She darted
  through and slammed it shut. He put his shoulder against it, but she was at
  least as strong as he. She got the key turned.</p>

  <p>He beat on the door with the sides of his fists, cursing horribly, but as
  always, oddly careful not to make too much noise.</p>

  <p>Pen, nauseated with disgust, thought: "To be married to such a
  maniac!"</p>

  <p>Like a maniac he fell suddenly silent. She pictured him listening.
  Presently his voice came softly as if he had his lips to the crack of the
  door, wheedling, crafty, threatening; infinitely more disgusting than his
  rage.</p>

  <p>"Are you there?...Listen, I'll give you another chance. Open the
  door!"</p>

  <p>A silence.</p>

  <p>"If you don't he goes to the chair!...By God! I'll spend every cent I
  possess to send him to the chair. Do you get that? Better open the door!"</p>

  <p>A silence.</p>

  <p>"It'll be too late when he's strapped in the chair with the black cap on
  and the electrode at the back of his handsome white neck...You'll remember it
  was really you put him there...Twelve hundred volts they give them. You can
  smell them burning...Well, how about it?"</p>

  <p>"Go away!" said Pen.</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right! All right!" he cried violently.</p>

  <p>She heard him leap down by the boxes. Looking through the narrow pane
  beside the door, she saw him run along the drive brandishing his clenched
  fists over his head.</p>

  <p>Pen went up-stairs. A sudden weakness overcame her, and she could scarcely
  drag one foot after the other. As she reached the upper landing a door opened
  and her father came out, carrying a candle. She had to assume some semblance
  of self-possession.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, Dad."</p>

  <p>"I thought I heard a little commotion down-stairs. It wakened me."</p>

  <p>"Only the closing of the front door. You must have been dreaming."</p>

  <p>"Who brought you home?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Riever."</p>

  <p>A note of pleased excitement crept into Pendleton's voice. "You have been
  with him all day?"</p>

  <p>"Most all day."</p>

  <p>He paddled close to her, the candle shaking a little in his agitation. He
  was wearing an old-fashioned night-shirt slit at the sides, and revealing an
  unexpectedly plump calf. "Oh, Pen, it's all right between you two, isn't it?"
  he said. "It means so much to me!"</p>

  <p>Pen was too weary to get angry all over again. She merely smiled faintly
  at the irony of life.</p>

  <p>He had put off his grand airs with his clothes. He was as simple now as
  his old-fashioned shirt. "Pen dear, think what it means to me! A frustrated
  old man! I'm a failure. I can't do anything for you. And I see this chance
  for you to establish yourself! Don't let any romantic youthful folly stand in
  the way, daughter. There's nothing in it, I know. Safety is everything!"</p>

  <p>"Dad, you must leave this to me," Pen muttered painfully.</p>

  <p>"I will! I will!" he said brightly. "I have every confidence in you. If
  you think of the matter at all there can be but the one answer!"</p>

  <p>"Go to bed, dear," said Pen, kissing him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="IX"
     id="IX"></a>IX. &mdash; THE NIGHT LONG</h2>

  <p class="first">ONE of Delehanty's first measures was to have the big house
  watched. Even before Riever could have got back to the beach, Pen from her
  front window saw the little group come in by the drive, separate and lose
  themselves in the darkness. One came to the house. Pendleton let him in. By
  Mr. Delehanty's orders he was to keep watch inside the house all night. He
  was to remain in the hall of the second floor. Pendleton's outraged protests
  were in vain. The man brought a chair up from the dining-room, and planted it
  outside Pen's door. It was Keesing. Pen already had him down in her black
  books, a gaunt, red-haired young man, curiously eager to do spy work.</p>

  <p>Pen locked her door, and paced up and down her room, raging. Her weariness
  was forgotten. Trapped! trapped! trapped! she felt with every footfall. To be
  sure the flat roof of the porch ran around outside her windows. It would be
  no great matter to slide down one of the porch posts to the ground. But they
  were certainly watching her windows from the outside, counting on being able
  to humiliate her no doubt.</p>

  <p>Within the space of half an hour she nearly went out of her mind. Then
  there was a diversion. Once more the rat-tat-tat of the big knocker
  reverberated through the lofty halls, and Pendleton had to paddle down-stairs
  again. Pen listening with all her ears made out the rumble of Delehanty's
  voice. Some one else was speaking too.</p>

  <p>Finally Delehanty raised his voice: "Keesing!"</p>

  <p>"Yes sir?"</p>

  <p>The detective clattered down the uncarpeted stairs, and Pen opened her
  door a crack. She heard her father coming up, and from a certain lightness in
  his step guessed that he was bringing what he considered to be good news.</p>

  <p>Seeing her at her door he broke out: "It's all right, my dear. It's Mr.
  Riever and Mr. Delehanty. There's been a misunderstanding it seems. No
  intention of annoying us. They apologized most handsomely. The man is to be
  taken away. All the men are to be taken away."</p>

  <p>Pen smiled scornfully. "Do they expect me to be taken in so easily?" she
  thought.</p>

  <p>Pendleton went on: "Mr. Riever said if it would not be presuming too much,
  could he speak to you for a minute? Wants to apologize to you personally.
  Better go down, dear. God knows, this is no time for formality!"</p>

  <p>It was on Pen's lips to refuse scornfully, but curiosity was strong within
  her. If she expected to get the better of these men she must know what they
  were up to. Perhaps they intended to arrest her. But in that case they would
  hardly have got up this comedy of sending the men up and taking them away
  again. Virtually she had been under arrest while Keesing sat at her door.</p>

  <p>Declining the offer of her father's candle, Pen went down.</p>

  <p>Riever alone was framed in the opening of the front door, the moonlight
  behind him. When Pen got close enough she saw Delehanty and Keesing waiting
  in the grass below the porch. Pen stopped a little more than arm's length
  from Riever. She couldn't see his face well.</p>

  <p>"You needn't be afraid," he said in a voice smooth, yet a little
  truculent, too, a sort of hang-dog voice. "I just wanted to tell you that
  when I found Delehanty had had the house surrounded, and put a man inside I
  was sore. I made him call them off. I didn't want you to think I had a hand
  in it."</p>

  <p>Pen was a little disconcerted, this was such a violent change from half an
  hour before. It was highly characteristic though of Riever to ignore
  everything that had gone before, characteristic of the spoiled child of any
  age.</p>

  <p>"Much obliged," she said, trying to keep the note of irony out of her
  voice.</p>

  <p>If he heard irony he did not betray it. "Well...that's all I wanted to
  say. That I was sorry you were annoyed...Will you shake hands on it?"</p>

  <p>"Surely!" said Pen. She offered her hand with a mental reservation; "If
  you're deceiving me as I suspect, this doesn't count!"</p>

  <p>She thought he would never have done fondling her hand. She ground her
  teeth and endured it.</p>

  <p>"Well...good-night," he said at last.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," said Pen.</p>

  <p>When he had taken two steps he stopped. "I said all his men," he said with
  a sly note creeping into his voice. "Watch and make sure."</p>

  <p>Pen waited in the doorway. Riever stepping off the porch, spoke to
  Delehanty. Delehanty put a hand to his lips and blew a shrill whistle. Out of
  various shrubby corners of the grounds figures emerged and approached their
  chief. Like a scene in a melodrama Pen thought with curling lip. There were
  six of them. That was the number she had seen enter the grounds.
  "Good-night," said Riever in a purring voice. "Good-night, Miss," fawned
  Delehanty. "Good-night, Miss," said Keesing, taking his tone from his
  betters.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," said Pen clearly. They all moved off in a body towards the
  gates. Pen smiling scornfully, turned back up-stairs. "What sort of an
  imbecile do they take me for?...Presently they'll come sneaking back...Expect
  me to lead them to him, do they?" Suddenly the quality of her smile changed.
  "Well why not do it?...It's the best idea I've had yet..." She went into her
  room in a study.</p>

  <p>The big house was laid out on the simplest of plans. As you entered the
  front door the two drawing-rooms were on the left of the central hall, and an
  immense dining-room on the right, with a pantry behind it as big as the
  living-room in many a cottage. In the rear extension were the kitchen and
  various offices. The second floor was divided into four great chambers of
  equal size and a smaller room over the entrance where Pen kept her
  sewing-machine. Her father slept in the room over the dining-room. It had a
  door into the room behind it, which was his study, work-shop and general
  receptacle. Pen had the other front room and it also communicated with the
  room behind it, which was called the guest chamber. The door between the two
  rooms was always supposed to be locked.</p>

  <p>The second floor of the rear extension was on a lower level. That is to
  say you started down the big stairway and reached the rear rooms from the
  turn. The extension contained the famous bathroom long out of repair, various
  cupboards and store-rooms, and the two servants' rooms which looked to the
  rear. In the main block of the house there was a third story with four more
  big bedrooms, and above that again was the "cupalow."</p>

  <p>Pendleton had gone back to bed. Pen got two lamps and flitted into the
  rear extension. Her father accustomed to her peregrinations over the house at
  all hours, paid no attention, even if he heard. The two servants' rooms were
  not used, but each contained various articles of furniture. Pen lit her lamps
  and placed them far enough back from the windows so that the lamps themselves
  could not have been seen by anybody who might chance to look up from the yard
  below. Anyone who was not familiar with the house would naturally suppose
  that the two lighted windows were in the same room.</p>

  <p>Pen calculated. "I told him to pack up his things and hide them before
  starting. That will take him say half an hour. It will take him twenty
  minutes to cross the fields. He can't get here in much less than an hour.
  I'll start in half an hour."</p>

  <p>Returning to her own room, she dropped to her knees at one of the front
  windows, and peered over the sill. She strained her eyes to watch that part
  of the grounds that was within range. But the very mysteriousness of
  moonlight balked her. The moon was in the South throwing long shadows
  directly athwart the lawn. The trees and shrubs of the overgrown place
  offered scores of hiding-places. More than once she thought she saw dark
  spots that did not belong there, and shadows seemed to move. She could not be
  sure. For that matter she knew that men could come along the beach below and
  scramble up the honeysuckle vines. In this way they could surround the house
  without crossing the open space in front. She was morally certain the
  detectives had returned, but she could not spot them.</p>

  <p>At the end of half an hour she dressed herself in her black dress and put
  on stout shoes. With a wildly beating heart she stole down stairs, and let
  herself softly out on the porch, leaving the door open. Here, for the benefit
  of anybody who might be watching her, she gave an imitation of one terrified
  and undecided; walking unevenly up and down, coming to the edge and peering
  out, running back in the house in a sudden panic, timorously venturing forth
  again. Finally she took to the shrubbery.</p>

  <p>She ran to the gates, scuttling like a rabbit from clump to clump, her
  head continually over her shoulder. She wished to be followed, but she must
  not of course appear to wish to be followed. She wished to find out too, if
  she were followed, but she must at all costs keep her pursuers from guessing
  that she was on to them. It was very complicated.</p>

  <p>At the gates she hesitated, turning her head this way and that. The
  question was which way should she lead them. Eventually she meant to take
  them to the little temple above the pond, but in the meantime she had half an
  hour to kill. From one of the ground floor windows of the cottage a beam of
  light was streaming out. Crouching over she ran across the intervening grass
  and peered over the sill. Surely if anybody were watching her this would seem
  like a natural act.</p>

  <p>Riever and Delehanty were within the room. Delehanty had fallen asleep on
  a couch. Riever was pacing up and down. There was no strut in him now, he was
  not on parade. He moved with his more natural cat-like tread, but it was a
  cat with a load on his back. When he turned at the far end of the room and
  Pen saw his face, the features were composed enough, but in his eyes showed a
  wild, animal-like torment. But her soft heart was hard against him. Whatever
  he might be suffering it was only a tithe of what he owed. The swiftest of
  glances was sufficient for her. She dropped to the ground like a leaf, and
  creeping around the corner of the house, made for the road in front.</p>

  <p>Running by fits and starts she went down the hill to the beach. She
  lingered in the shadow of a bush looking out. Nothing human stirred. There
  was a breeze from the Southeast and from the other side of the point came a
  murmur of waves on the beach. But within the scimitar curve of white sand the
  water was like a mirror. Three hundred yards offshore the <i>Alexandra</i>
  floated, huge and ghostly in the moonlight, all dark except for her
  riding-light. Out in the bay the red light on Poplar point flashed
  intermittently. Out of the vast, gray stillness that recurring spark had a
  dreadful significance&mdash;like blood.</p>

  <p>Pen retraced her steps more slowly up the hill. If anyone had followed her
  so far, he would have to let her pass him now. He would be hidden somewhere
  alongside the road. The thought made her heart flutter. Though she had
  deliberately provoked it, there was a terrible excitement in being hunted. As
  she walked she kept her head fixed straight ahead, but her darting eyes
  searched among the bushes on her left. On the other side was a cut-bank which
  afforded no cover.</p>

  <p>And then she saw one of them. There could be no mistaking it. In the
  darkest shadow under the branches, the suggestion of a crouching human figure
  still as death. She could even tell that he was holding his head down to keep
  his white face from betraying him. He was less than ten feet from her. It was
  terribly hard to keep her muscles in order as she passed, and <i>just
  after</i> she passed. But satisfaction was mixed with her terror. Her ruse
  had not failed.</p>

  <p>Leaving the gates on her left she kept on around the turn of the road.
  Here she sought to play with them further by running again, running as hard
  as she could alongside the fence that bounded the vegetable garden. Looking
  over her shoulder she had glimpses of two pursuers, bent double in the road,
  and darting from shadow to shadow. She took them a quarter of a mile down the
  road and brought them back to the point where her own path struck off behind
  the cottage into the woods.</p>

  <p>At this point she hesitated for a long time looking all around her like a
  person wishing to make finally sure that she was not followed. As long as she
  stood still nothing stirred of course. Suddenly she put her head down and ran
  like a deer for the woods. As soon as she was within cover she stopped and
  looked back. Her pursuers were startled into showing themselves openly on the
  path. Three of them. Pen ran on to the little temple and flung herself down
  to recover her breath and await developments. She sat within the little
  circle of pillars with an arm flung across the cool gravestone and her cheek
  pillowed on it. It was quite dark there.</p>

  <p>But nothing happened. Nobody came plunging after her into the little
  opening. Not a sound was to be heard. The excitement of being chased died
  down, and a chill of apprehension struck to Pen's breast. What were they up
  to? They couldn't possibly see what she was doing in the little temple. Why
  didn't they find out then? The suspense became unbearable. Each minute was an
  age. She could have screamed aloud.</p>

  <p>Then she heard a twig snap&mdash;not in the direction of the path by which
  she had come, but on the other side of the clearing. It instantly became
  clear to her what was happening, and her breast quieted down. She heard other
  whispers of sounds, the brush of leaves against a passing body, a released
  pebble rolling down the bank. Naturally if they thought Don was in there with
  her they had to take their precautions. They had sent for help maybe.
  Certainly they were now surrounding the place.</p>

  <p>Then absolute silence fell again, and moment by moment her breast became
  tighter. It was worse now because she could feel the presences around her.
  Why didn't they do something? Suddenly a wicked little thought occurred to
  her. She smiled and at the same time shook with fear. She commenced to murmur
  half-audibly to herself. It was only a nursery rhyme, but she meant it to
  sound like conversation.</p>

  <p>It worked. A dazzling white beam suddenly flashed in her face. Pen
  screamed and scrambled to her feet. She did not have to act that. But oh! it
  was a relief to have it over with. As she stood up other lights were thrown
  on her. She could see nothing for the shifting, blinding circles. Some were
  held on her, others ran all over the place like quicksilver, like scrambling
  little devils of light nosing in the corners. One even ran around under the
  dome as if it expected to find Don clinging there like a bat.</p>

  <p>From behind one of the glares came Delehanty's growling voice: "Where is
  he?"</p>

  <p>"Who?" said Pen. She was cool enough now.</p>

  <p>"You know who I mean!" He checked on oath.</p>

  <p>"I am alone here," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"What did you come here for?"</p>

  <p>"To pray," she said demurely.</p>

  <p>"Hah!" He was hard put to it to control himself. "What place is this?"</p>

  <p>"The tomb of my ancestors."</p>

  <p>Somebody threw a line on the grave stone. The beautifully carved Gothic
  script was sharply outlined. A voice began to read:</p>

  <p>"Here lies the body of Pendleton Broome, beloved son of Pendleton Broome
  and Mary Camalier. Who departed this life..."</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" growled Delehanty. To Pen he said: "Look here, I want a
  straight answer. What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"I always come here when I wish to be alone," said Pen with delicate
  emphasis.</p>

  <p>"Hah!...Mitchell!" He conferred with one of his men.</p>

  <p>Pen still blinded by their lights could not see what was going on. A man
  edged around behind her. Delehanty who had put away his light was busy with
  something in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Now!" he said abruptly.</p>

  <p>Pen's arms were suddenly pinned to her sides. As she opened her mouth to
  protest Delehanty pressed his twisted handkerchief between her teeth. Pen
  struggled furiously, but it was pulled tight and knotted behind her head.</p>

  <p>Delehanty growled to his men: "Get back in your places. She's evidently
  got a date with him here. He'll be here yet. If you let him slip through your
  fingers, by Gad! I'll have you all broken."</p>

  <p>Pen hearing this, ceased to struggle, and smiled behind the gag.
  "Well...let them!" she thought. "It's all to the good!"</p>

  <p>Delehanty said to her: "March! young lady!"</p>

  <p>Pen, just to keep up appearances, moaned behind the gag, and hung
  back.</p>

  <p>Delehanty pushed her ahead of him in the path. "Get along back to the
  house with you!" he commanded.</p>

  <p>Pen made no further objections.</p>

  <p>He accompanied her back to the house. Reaching the porch he took off the
  gag.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Pen demurely.</p>

  <p>"Get inside," he said. "You won't be feeling so flip in the morning."</p>

  <p>He strode back towards the gates. But there was no certainty in his
  carriage. He suspected he had been fooled. Pen all but laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>Pen scampered across the porch, and into the house, closing and locking
  the door behind her. All her being hung on the agonizing question: was he
  there? She ran back through the hall into the kitchen. In the dark depths of
  the house her hands served her for eyes. She knew it so well. Her hand went
  unerringly to the knob of the door that gave on the cellar stairs. She ran
  down. At the foot of the stairs an agony of apprehension constricted her
  throat. She could not speak aloud.</p>

  <p>"Don!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>From out of the dark came the answering whisper: "Pen!"</p>

  <p>In the ecstasy of relief that flooded her Pen lost her grip on reality for
  a moment. Her knees gave under her. She sank down in a heap on the earthen
  floor.</p>

  <p>Don sought all around for her in the dark. "Pen! Pen!" he whispered
  urgently.</p>

  <p>He stumbled against her. He gathered her up and held her against him. She
  clung around his neck in a sort of desperation. But the warmth of him, the
  ripple of muscle under his cotton shirt, the strong rise of his breast
  against hers all seemed to pour a new life into her. He was very real!</p>

  <p>"Oh, my darling!" she whispered..."Oh Heavens, what a day!"</p>

  <p>"Something has happened?" he said.</p>

  <p>In her relief she felt a little light-headed. "A few things!" she
  giggled.</p>

  <p>"Tell me."</p>

  <p>"I will. Let's get out of this hole."</p>

  <p>"Is it safe?"</p>

  <p>"My dear!...Did you think I was going to store you among the
  potatoes?"</p>

  <p>"I'll carry you up."</p>

  <p>"No, I'm all right again. I must lead you."</p>

  <p>She pulled him after her towards the stairs. She made no allowance for his
  unfamiliarity with the place, and he fell over the bottom step with a
  clatter. Don went rigid. Pen laughed as women do in the dark.</p>

  <p>"Clumsy!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>In the kitchen he asked for water. She led him to the pail, and held the
  dipper to his lips. They both drank like hard driven horses, and sighed with
  refreshment. Then she led him up the back stairs. At the top she left him for
  a moment while she blew out the lamps in the back rooms. When they got to the
  main upper hall, through the transom over Pendleton's door they heard a sound
  like a saw being drawn very slowly through rotten wood. It started Pen off
  again. She hastily pulled Don into her room, and closing her door, smothered
  her laughter in his neck. It started him going. They quivered and rocked with
  suppressed laughter. They finally sank down on a sofa weak, but immensely
  refreshed. There is nothing like laughter.</p>

  <p>"What room is this?" whispered Don.</p>

  <p>"My room."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Pen!" he murmured on a deep note.</p>

  <p>"Don't you like being here?"</p>

  <p>He drew her hard against his side. "Oh Pen!...I can't tell you how it
  makes me feel!"</p>

  <p>"What more natural refuge could you have, dear?"</p>

  <p>"But where are you going to keep me, Pen?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Right here."</p>

  <p>He drew away from her. "Oh no, I couldn't let you."</p>

  <p>She became angry immediately. "Why not? Is it because of the danger to my
  reputation?...How perfectly silly under the circumstances!"</p>

  <p>"It isn't only that," he muttered sullenly. "It's the same old thing.
  Hiding behind your skirts. I can't bear it. Why, suppose I were found
  here?"</p>

  <p>All at once they seemed completely divided. "Oh, you make me so angry!"
  she said helplessly. "Thinking about what people would say! You think more of
  what people say than you do of me! What have you and I got to do with what
  people say?"</p>

  <p>"You're not quite fair to me," he said.</p>

  <p>The note of quiet stubbornness terrified her. Here was a force she could
  not gauge. "Oh, we must not quarrel!" she murmured with a catch in her
  breath..."Oh, Don, I love you so!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my Pen!" he murmured gathering her in his arms again.</p>

  <p>There was a blessed peaceful interlude.</p>

  <p>After awhile she murmured in a small voice: "Then you will stay here until
  we can think up something else?"</p>

  <p>But the quiet stubbornness was unaltered. "I won't promise anything. I
  must be free to decide."</p>

  <p>"But Don! After all the trouble I have had to get you here! You're in my
  castle, and I must know where I have you. Mustn't you let me decide for the
  time being?"</p>

  <p>"That's just the rub," he said ruefully. "You're so bossy. Pen. If you had
  me here right under your thumb I wouldn't be able to call my soul my
  own."</p>

  <p>Pen refused to see any humor in the situation. "Would it matter for a
  little while?"</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't want a tame man!"</p>

  <p>The ever-present fear leaped to her lips. "You're thinking of giving
  yourself up!"</p>

  <p>"No," he said soberly. "I've changed my mind about that. Since I've been
  reading the papers. I'll keep them on the look until I see a chance to make a
  good fight."</p>

  <p>Pen kissed him passionately. "Ah, that's a load off my breast!" she cried.
  "That's what kept me awake nights!"</p>

  <p>"But I must be allowed to play my own hand," he insisted.</p>

  <p>"All right, stubborn!...Now listen, while I tell you everything that
  happened to-day."</p>

  <p>On the sofa near the front windows, with her lips close to his ear she
  told him the story of Blanche Paglar. How sweet it was to feel in the
  pressure of his hand on hers how his excitement and his hope grew with the
  tale.</p>

  <p>He would not let himself hope too far. When she had come to the end, he
  said cautiously; "Well, that's a beginning. But it's a wild scheme, Pen. You
  mustn't bank too much on it. Suppose you're right about Riever&mdash;it
  begins to look as if you were right.&mdash;No jury would take the testimony
  of a lot of gangsters against that of the famous millionaire. And all old
  Riever's powerful friends would rally round him. We're not out of the woods
  yet."</p>

  <p>"I don't care so much about convicting Riever so long as we raise a
  sufficient doubt to make a jury afraid to convict you!"</p>

  <p>"But it would be a point of honor with that gang to convict me,
  see?...What happened after you got home?"</p>

  <p>She told him that part somewhat toned down. She suppressed the fact of
  Riever's proposal.</p>

  <p>Don said wisely: "I believe Riever's falling in love with you!"</p>

  <p>Pen smiled and kissed him.</p>

  <p>He laughed at her tale of how she had led the detectives into the woods,
  and left them there watching.</p>

  <p>"But wait a minute," he said. "After awhile it will begin to percolate
  into their thick heads that they've been sold. They'll begin to put two and
  two together. They'll realize that you drew them away from the house on
  purpose...Take it from me we'll have a visit from them before morning. You'd
  better let me go while the going's good!"</p>

  <p>Pen clung to him. "No! No! Can't you stay with me an hour without
  beginning to fidget?...They're going to comb the woods at dawn. Where could
  you go?"</p>

  <p>"But they'll search the house first."</p>

  <p>"No matter. I'm on my own ground here. I'm prepared for them...Wait a
  minute!"</p>

  <p>Leaving him, she unlocked the door into the back room, and disappeared for
  a few minutes. She returned through the other door.</p>

  <p>"Where've you been?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Preparing a line of retreat," she said smiling.</p>

  <p>"What time is it, Pen?"</p>

  <p>"Not midnight yet. Things have been moving fast."</p>

  <p>"You must be worn out, dear. Lie down and sleep. I'll keep watch."</p>

  <p>"Silly! Do you think I could sleep with you in the room?"</p>

  <p>"Then I'll go in the next room."</p>

  <p>"No! What's an hour or two's sleep?...Come and sit down again."</p>

  <p>On the sofa near the windows she leaned back against him, her head in the
  hollow of his shoulder. He sunk his cheek in her hair.</p>

  <p>"Pen, it's just a week to-day since we met. Isn't that strange?"</p>

  <p>"What's time got to do with it? I knew the very first moment."</p>

  <p>"I, too."</p>

  <p>"Story-teller! The first look you gave me was not that kind at all?"</p>

  <p>"What kind was it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, a kind of...kind of sprightly look. Observe little bright-eyes!"</p>

  <p>"Pen!"</p>

  <p>She laughed delightedly.</p>

  <p>"Well, it happened so soon afterwards it doesn't count."</p>

  <p>"I wonder how it is to a man," she murmured dreamily. "With me...well it
  was like hating you, you upset me so!"</p>

  <p>"You made me a little sore, too. You were so bossy!"</p>

  <p>"You always say that!"</p>

  <p>It was his turn to chuckle in his throat.</p>

  <p>"Dearest, I have a confession to make to you," she whispered. "Do you
  know, when I first read that story in the newspapers I was glad."</p>

  <p>"Glad?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course I knew that it wasn't true...And I knew that I shouldn't
  lose you."</p>

  <p>"Pen!...You wouldn't have lost me anyway. I was thinking about it when you
  came down to the tent splashing through the water. I wasn't going."</p>

  <p>"Oh Don how sweet that is to my ears!...Sometimes I have felt that
  circumstances forced me on you."</p>

  <p>"Nothing in it! You'd already got your hooks into me."</p>

  <p>"What an expression!"</p>

  <p>"You made goodness seem so charming!"</p>

  <p>"I, good?...If you knew!"</p>

  <p>"I do know. I know exactly what I mean. There's so much disgusting
  hypocrisy in the world a fellow gets to think that the bad people are the
  only honest ones. You taught me better."</p>

  <p>Pen turned and clung to him. A tear or two rolled down her cheeks. "Oh, my
  dear! ...It isn't true!...But it comforts me so!"</p>

  <p>Enfolded in happiness and delicious peace, they became sleepy in spite of
  themselves. Notwithstanding his sleepy protests, she drew herself away from
  him.</p>

  <p>"Stretch out," she whispered. "I will sit on the stool beside you where I
  can look at you. I love so to look at you!"</p>

  <p>"Pen! ...No! You sleep!...I'll keep watch!"</p>

  <p>But he sunk lower and lower. Soon he was gone. Pen sitting beside him
  could gaze her fill. The moon was coming in the front windows now. The direct
  rays did not fall on him, but there was light enough for her to see. All
  relaxed and helpless like that he seemed to belong to her more completely
  than he ever did awake&mdash;and stubborn. She could scarcely bear to look at
  him.</p>

  <p>In the end she slept too with her cheek on his breast.</p>

  <p>She was awakened, she knew not how long afterwards, by a sound. Even in
  the instant of waking she recognized the sound. It was the stealthy creak of
  the tin roof outside her window. At the touch of her hand on his cheek Don
  awoke all of a piece. He slipped noiselessly to the floor. They crept to the
  middle of the room.</p>

  <p>With her lips at his ear she breathed: "There's a man on the porch
  roof."</p>

  <p>"Did he look in?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. He couldn't have seen you through the screen."</p>

  <p>"If he tries to come in...?"</p>

  <p>"Slip through the door behind you."</p>

  <p>Don made to creep away from her. She laid a hand on his arm. "Wait!"</p>

  <p>There was no further sound from the man outside.</p>

  <p>"He's not coming in," Pen whispered. "He's out there to cut off your
  escape."</p>

  <p>A tremendous rat-tat-tat resounded through the empty halls.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have slept!" murmured Don.</p>

  <p>"It's all right!" whispered Pen. "I intended you should stay here."</p>

  <p>"I feel trapped within walls!"</p>

  <p>"You are safest here!"</p>

  <p>The knocking was imperiously repeated. Outside Pen's door they heard her
  father's agitated voice.</p>

  <p>"Pen, are you there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Dad," she said coolly.</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are, my dear. I'll go down."</p>

  <p>For the third time that night the worthy little man pattered down stairs
  in his bare feet.</p>

  <p>Pen opened her door an inch. She heard her father's prudent inquiry
  through the closed door, and a gruff voice outside reply:</p>

  <p>"Open the door!"</p>

  <p>Pendleton remonstrated, and the voice, Delehanty's, was brutally
  raised:</p>

  <p>"Open the door or I'll smash it in!"</p>

  <p>She heard the key squeak in the lock. Pendleton's remonstrances were
  drowned in the sounds made by the entrance of a number of men. Pendleton's
  voice was raised in agonized tones. Delehanty said:</p>

  <p>"We're going to search the house!"</p>

  <p>Pen had the sense that her little father was trying to bar them out by
  main strength. Signing to Don to remain where he was, she hastened to the
  head of the stairs. She called down:</p>

  <p>"Let them in, father. We have nothing to hide."</p>

  <p>Returning to her room she locked the door. Her father came upstairs
  accompanied by a pair of shod feet. His voice at Pen's door was utterly
  bewildered.</p>

  <p>"They insist on searching the house...searching the house! At this
  hour!"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all right," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"They say if you'll stay quietly in your room they'll leave that until
  last. There's a man out here on guard. Better dress, dear."</p>

  <p>"I shall be all right," said Pen.</p>

  <p>She turned and kissed Don with a smile on her lips. Her eyes shone with
  the light of battle.</p>

  <p>He looked more dubious. "Is your way of retreat still open?" he
  whispered.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well then...?"</p>

  <p>"Wait till they come up stairs."</p>

  <p>She listened with her ear at the crack of the door. Vague sounds arose
  from below. She was tormented by her inability to hear exactly. Finally she
  motioned to Don to stand back out of any possible range of vision, and
  opening the door, she put her head around it.</p>

  <p>Instantly a flash-light was thrown on her and a voice said:</p>

  <p>"You can't come out, Miss."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to come out," said Pen coolly, "I want to hear what's going
  on in my house."</p>

  <p>Now her ear practised in that house, could follow their movements very
  well. They were in the cellar. They took no precautions for silence. They
  came stamping up the cellar stairs, and were to be heard in the kitchen and
  the outer kitchen. They spread through the main rooms of the house. Pen
  smiled to herself, hearing them move heavy objects of furniture, looking for
  hiding-places in the walls. Finally they started up the main stairway, but
  were diverted into the rear extension. Doors were opened and shut, furniture
  pulled about. As they started to move back towards the front. Pen closed her
  door.</p>

  <p>"They're coming!" she breathed in Don's ear!. "Now's the time!"</p>

  <p>She took him to the door leading to the rear room. "Lock this door behind
  you and put the key in your pocket." She pointed to an open window in the
  corner of the room facing the rear. "There's your way out. The ironing-board
  is on the floor under the window. Stretch it across catty-cornered to the
  sash of the bathroom window. I pulled down the top sash ready for you. As you
  go, turn and close this window behind you. When you get in the bath-room pull
  the board after you. Don't touch that window. It squeaks. Wait in the
  bath-room with the door open. If you hear anybody coming that way slip down
  the back stairs and into the cellar. While you're in the bathroom watch this
  window. When they're through with this room I'll raise the window and leave
  it up. That's your signal to come back."</p>

  <p>There was a peremptory knock on the door of Pen's room. The lovers pressed
  hands and parted. Slipping through the door, Don closed it noiselessly and
  turned the key.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Pen asked.</p>

  <p>The voice of Delehanty brusquely replied: "Open the door, please."</p>

  <p>Pen wanted all the time she could gain. "Is my father there?" she asked as
  if in doubt.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my dear," said Pendleton quaveringly. "Please open."</p>

  <p>"One moment!"</p>

  <p>She turned down the covers of her bed, and rumpled them. Her ears were
  strained for sounds from the back, but she heard nothing. So much the
  better!</p>

  <p>"You've had plenty of time to dress!" said Delehanty harshly.</p>

  <p>She opened the door. There was a small crowd in the hall. One carried a
  brilliant acetylene lantern which filled the place with a strong white light
  and threw grotesque shadows upwards. All the detectives had their hats on;
  some were short, some tall. It was like a caricature in violent chiaroscuro.
  As for Pendleton, he had his pants pulled over his night-shirt and his bare
  feet looked piteous. A picture of ineffectiveness, he was still carrying a
  lighted candle in all that glare.</p>

  <p>Without so much as by your leave Delehanty strode into the room with three
  of his men at his heels. The chief was chewing an extinct cigar which smelled
  vilely. Pen choked with rage. She bit her lips to keep back an outburst. Her
  father went to her, and squeezed her hand imploringly. The three men spread
  around the room like well-trained dogs. One could imagine them sniffing. They
  were armed with electric torches with which to illumine dark corners.
  Delehanty went direct to the door into the rear room and rattled it.</p>

  <p>"What's behind here?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Another bed room," said Pen. "The guest-room."</p>

  <p>"Guest-room?" sneered Delehanty. "Where's the key?"</p>

  <p>"The door has been locked for many years. I couldn't tell you."</p>

  <p>"Well what's the door from that room into the hall doing locked?"</p>

  <p>"Because I keep certain things of value in there, I don't want the
  servants to go in."</p>

  <p>Pen's father must have wondered at this answer. But perhaps he was too
  confused to take in what she was saying. At any rate he kept quiet.</p>

  <p>"Is that key lost too?" sneered Delehanty.</p>

  <p>"No," said Pen calmly. "It's among the other keys on the rack in my
  sewing-room. My father will get it for you."</p>

  <p>Pendleton trotted obediently away with his candle.</p>

  <p>When he came back with it Delehanty's sleuths had completed their search
  of Pen's room. The whole party passed around through the hall to the door of
  the guest-room. The men showed excitement. They thought they had their man.
  Delehanty flung the door open and stepped back. He ordered his men to cast
  the light of their electric torches inside. This was to draw the fire of the
  supposed occupant. Pen's lip curled. Finally the men ventured across the
  threshold.</p>

  <p>The acetylene lantern filled the great bare chamber with light. It was
  meagerly furnished, a gigantic bedroom set of the carved walnut period, the
  bed with an old-fashioned mosquito bar, an air-tight stove, an humble little
  rocking-chair. The great expanse of white wall was guiltless of paper or
  tint, and showed long fine cracks running in every direction like the map of
  a complicated river system. The floor was covered with matting.</p>

  <p>Delehanty sniffed. "The air is fresh. There's been a window open in
  here."</p>

  <p>Pen's heart contracted. "The room is aired every day," she said
  quickly.</p>

  <p>Delehanty went to the window in the corner. The two windows at the side of
  the room were shuttered on the outside. He cast his light along the sill.</p>

  <p>"There's no dust here," he said accusingly.</p>

  <p>"There's no dust anywhere in my house," said Pen.</p>

  <p>Delehanty commanded the window to be opened. The acetylene light was held
  outside. This was the crucial moment. Pen held her breath.</p>

  <p>"What is there?" asked Delehanty,</p>

  <p>"Eighteen or twenty foot drop, sir."</p>

  <p>"Any gutter pipe or lightning rod?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"Close the window."</p>

  <p>Pen breathed again.</p>

  <p>The bare room offered but few places of concealment, under the bed, within
  the washstand, a shallow clothes closet in the wall. They even looked in the
  bureau drawers. Finally Delehanty with a grunt, moved towards the door. Pen's
  heart swelled big with triumph.</p>

  <p>She glanced at Delehanty's cigar. "Would you mind leaving the window
  open?" she said cuttingly.</p>

  <p>At a nod from the chief, one of the men flung up the sash. Pen felt a
  little quiver of inward laughter. There was something humorous in making the
  enemy transmit one's signals. All left the room and Pen locked the door. She
  handed the key to her father.</p>

  <p>"Please put it where you got it."</p>

  <p>Delehanty fixed her with an irascible, suspicious eye. "You come along
  with us the rest of the way. Miss. I want no trickery!"</p>

  <p>Pen shrugged.</p>

  <p>The search went on, that queer crew straggling through the rooms
  accompanied by their grotesque up-flung shadows. Through Pen's sewing-room
  and into Pendleton's bed-room. From thence they passed into the extraordinary
  room behind where he kept all his "Collections." He never threw anything
  away. Everything under the sun was to be found there. All around the walls
  were rickety, home-made tables heaped with his impedimenta.</p>

  <p>All this occupied the searchers quite a while. They threw his stuff about
  regardless of his protests.</p>

  <p>Finally there was the third story which Pen had long ago given up to dust
  and spiders and last of all the "cupalow" into which Keesing to Pen's
  amusement, ascended with drawn revolver.</p>

  <p>In the end Delehanty stamped down-stairs in a villainous temper, his
  soft-footed sleuths at his heels.</p>

  <p>At the front door Pendleton attempted to recover his dignity. "Now I trust
  you'll favor me with some explanation," he began.</p>

  <p>"Ah! ask your daughter for the explanation!" snarled the detective. "Take
  my advice, and keep her home nights!"</p>

  <p>They all went. Pendleton turned to Pen aghast.</p>

  <p>"What did he mean by that?"</p>

  <p>But Pen's heart was dancing. An irresponsible gale of laughter caught her
  up. She had a wicked impulse to see her father's bare feet twinkle. She
  caught his wrists (he still had the candle) and attempted to whirl him
  around.</p>

  <p>"Oh joy! Oh joy! Oh joy!" she cried. "They're gone!"</p>

  <p>"Pen! Have you gone crazy," he protested.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's the heat!"</p>

  <p>"Be quiet! What did the man mean?"</p>

  <p>"How do I know? A man will say anything when he's sore...Come on back to
  bed."</p>

  <p>She pulled him wildly to the foot of the stairs, Pendleton leaning back,
  and his bare feet slapping the floor absurdly. Pen laughed so she had to sit
  on the bottom step to recover.</p>

  <p>"Your levity is very ill-timed!" he said severely.</p>

  <p>That only made her laugh the more. "Come on! Come on!" she said, dragging
  him up-stairs.</p>

  <p>At the door of his room she kissed him, and gave him a push inside. She
  flew across to her own room and let herself in.</p>

  <p>"Don! Don!" she just breathed, holding out her hands.</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>She flew to the door between the two rooms. It yielded to her hand. The
  key was in it. So he had come back. The window in the corner was still open.
  It was very dark in the back room. She felt all around for him, softly
  whispering his name. Her breast contracted with apprehension. She ran back
  into the front room to make a light.</p>

  <p>As soon as the candle flame grew up she saw a piece of paper pinned to the
  wooden mantel. It looked like the fly leaf torn out of a book. There was a
  pencil scrawl upon it.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dearest</span>:</p>

  <p class="letter">Writing in the dark. That was too near a thing. Can't let
  you take such risks. I'm off on my own. Don't worry. Love.</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">D</span>.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="X"
     id="X"></a>X. &mdash; DAYS OF SUSPENSE</h2>

  <p class="first">PEN lay on her bed wide-eyed and dry-eyed until near dawn.
  It did not lessen her misery any that a good part of it was anger at having
  her will balked. She accused Don by turn of callousness, of ingratitude, of
  folly; she tried to tell herself that he was not worth saving, but without
  abating any of her torments of anxiety as to his fate. It was worse than
  anxiety; she had a horrible, dull certainty that he would be taken as soon as
  it became light. Like a wilful child intent only upon having his own way, he
  had run blindly out into their trap.</p>

  <p>After the briefest period of unconsciousness she was awakened by a stir
  outside the house. Looking out of the window she saw that the sun was but
  just up, the great square shadow of the house reached almost to the edge of
  the bank. Nevertheless early as it was, the house grounds were full of
  people, and more were arriving through the gates. These were Islanders,
  fisher-folk, or men from the farms in earth-colored garments. Under the bank
  she could hear the put-put of arriving motor-boats. Among the people the
  gross figure of Delehanty was conspicuous, moving about, picking out men here
  and there.</p>

  <p>Well, if he was still looking for men Don was not yet caught,
  nevertheless, Pen's heart sickened at the sight. It was clear enough what was
  happening. During the last few days popular interest in the chase had fallen
  off, but the news of the finding of the canoe had revived it. The blood lust
  was aroused again. When she got down to the kitchen Pen learned from the
  excited negroes that Riever had increased the reward to ten thousand dollars.
  That was what had brought the crowd.</p>

  <p>Like a woman who had died and whose body was condemned to drag on, Pen
  started things going in the kitchen and set the table for breakfast. When her
  father came into the dining-room even he who noticed so little, was struck by
  the contrast of her present look with the laughing mænad who had thrust him
  into his room the night before.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>Pen shrugged. She had to make some excuse. "Last night was too much for
  me," she muttered.</p>

  <p>"I thought so!" he said severely. "I told you you were acting
  wildly...Riever had nothing to do with that affair," he added
  irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>"What difference does it make?"</p>

  <p>Pendleton had already been out of doors, and he could talk about nothing
  but the latest developments of the case. In his new interest, his resentment
  against Delehanty had cooled. Pen could not gather from his talk what they
  were saying about her. No doubt they spared his feelings&mdash;or mocked him
  without his being aware of it. With the curious blindness that was
  characteristic of him, he had not yet connected the finding of the canoe with
  his daughter.</p>

  <p>"How strange that Counsell should have come back here after having paddled
  away!" he said. "And yet, how natural! It was the last thing anyone would
  suppose that he would do!"</p>

  <p>Pen let him run on, half attending.</p>

  <p>Worse was in store for her. Her father said:</p>

  <p>"Of course Riever has been entirely discreet in making his new
  announcement. He had it written out and sent it over to the Island last night
  to be posted up outside the store. His offer reads: 'Ten thousand dollars for
  the apprehension of Donald Counsell.' But everybody understands that it means
  dead or alive. Many of the men are armed."</p>

  <p>Pen thought she had experienced the extremity of torment. But this was
  saving for her. She half rose from her chair with a face of horror, and
  dropped back, again.</p>

  <p>"But this is murder!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" said little Pendleton blinking.</p>

  <p>"Cold-blooded murder!...Cynical murder!...To set an armed mob after a
  defenseless man...with the promise of reward!"</p>

  <p>"But he's desperate. If he's cornered he'll fight..."</p>

  <p>"He is unarmed!" said Pen.</p>

  <p>Her father's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>She saw that she had betrayed herself, but she was beyond caring. Pushing
  her chair back she went to the mantel and resting her arms upon it dropped
  her head on them.</p>

  <p>"Oh God! what sort of a world is it where such things are possible!" she
  cried.</p>

  <p>"Pen, what am I to think from this?" he stammered aghast.</p>

  <p>She could not be still in her agony. She paced up and down stretching up
  her arms for the ease to her breast which was not to be had.</p>

  <p>"Whatever you like!" she said.</p>

  <p>"You have been seeing him? You know where he is?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know now."</p>

  <p>"My God!"</p>

  <p>Pen hurried from the room, leaving him in a state of collapse.</p>

  <p>She still went about her daily tasks like a piece of mechanism. She had to
  keep in some sort of motion. She experienced strange lapses, discovered
  herself offering whole corn in her hand to the newly-hatched chicks; came to
  to find herself in places without any notion of what she had come for. Her
  father kept out of her way.</p>

  <p>It took a long time to organize the searchers. Delehanty was not taking
  any chance of failure. He was in no particular hurry since he had already
  sent a large party by boat to the head of the creek to cut off any escape up
  the Neck. Finally about ten o'clock the rest were ready. They set off in
  three parties, the first making its way along the river shore to comb the
  woods on the Absolom's Island side; the second setting off towards the
  lighthouse to surround the pond in the woods; the third and largest party
  heading straight back by the Neck road. Their instructions were to deploy
  along the edge of the woods, and wait until they got in touch with the
  parties on either flank. Two lads who brought motor-cycles over from the
  Island were delegated to act as messengers between Delehanty and the
  searchers.</p>

  <p>When they had gone an ominous Sabbath quiet descended on Broome's Point,
  which was harder to bear than the confusion. Delehanty went off to the
  cottage. There was no one to be seen but a few of the yellow-faced squatters'
  women from up the Neck who peered from under their sun-bonnets with shy,
  half-human eyes, and a group of old men standing by the porch discussing
  bygone murders with zest.</p>

  <p>Later, Pen came upon her father in the back kitchen, or dairy, evidently
  seeking to waylay her. He seemed not greatly affected by the scene in the
  dining-room, only for a hang-dog air, and a difficulty in meeting her glance.
  As a matter of fact Pen's tragic eyes intimidated him. For himself, he had
  been absorbed in trifles for so long that he could not feel anything very
  deeply.</p>

  <p>He said: "I suppose you've forgotten that we were to lunch on the yacht
  to-day."</p>

  <p>Pen stared at him. <i>Still</i> he had not understood!</p>

  <p>"I suppose you don't want to go," he said quickly.</p>

  <p>"No," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"What will Mr. Riever think," he said plaintively.</p>

  <p>"I don't care."</p>

  <p>The gathering storm on her brows warned him not to go any further. But he
  still hung around like a child.</p>

  <p>To get rid of him Pen said: "Why don't you go?"</p>

  <p>He brightened. "Well, I wasn't sure if it was proper..."</p>

  <p>"Oh go ahead! Tell him I'm sick. Tell him anything you like."</p>

  <p>"Well I will if you think it's all right. I want to talk business with him
  anyway."</p>

  <p>He donned the old frock coat and the comical, flat straw hat and set off
  as blithely as a child with a penny in its hand. Pen's glance after him was
  bitter. Nevertheless she was thankful to be rid of him.</p>

  <p>There came a time when Pen could no longer keep up even the pretense of
  doing her chores. Always with her mind's eyes she was following the
  searchers. They had come to the edge of the woods. They were spreading out.
  They were waiting until the parties on either side came up. Now they had
  climbed the fence and were advancing slowly with their guns held ready;
  ignorant, passionate men with their guns cocked! She went to her room and
  paced up and down with her clenched hands pressed to her breast. She could
  not stay there either. She came down on the porch where she could hear better
  and paced endlessly up and down, careless of who might be a witness to her
  agitation. All her faculties were concentrated on hearing. She was listening
  for shots.</p>

  <p>Time passed and there was no news. She sent Ellick, the more intelligent
  of Aunt Maria's sons down to the beach to pick up what he could. One or two
  negroes had come over in the boats. This was regarded as a white man's
  business and they were not allowed to take part in it. Nothing transpired
  until mid-afternoon when Ellick came back to say that the motorcycle boys had
  brought in Counsell's camping outfit which had been found in the woods. Of
  Counsell himself there was no word.</p>

  <p>A wild hope arose in Pen's breast. Suppose after all he had succeeded in
  getting away up the Neck before the line was drawn across it!</p>

  <p>Her hope soon sickened though. What good if he had escaped for the moment?
  There was but the one road eighty miles long, by which he could reach cities
  and crowds and safety. And by this time everybody along that road was on the
  <i>qui vive</i> to catch him, their mouths watering at the ten thousand
  dollar reward. What chance had he of succor? Where could he get food? Or on
  that sandy peninsula, water?</p>

  <p>She tormented her brain with futile calculations. Could he or could he not
  have made it? Delehanty had dispatched the party up the creek immediately
  after searching the house. Pen had heard the boats set off. By that time Don
  had had half an hour's start. A man walks perhaps four miles an hour, the
  boats averaged seven. It was four miles to the head of the creek, and but a
  step from the landing to the Neck road. Still Don ought to have got there
  first. But he might have turned aside to get something from his hidden store
  in the woods! Pen's brain whirled dizzily.</p>

  <p>At other times she pictured him crouching white-faced in the bush,
  listening to the relentless slow approach of the searchers, and knowing that
  the other side was watched too. Then the dash for freedom, the shots...That
  picture came back again and again. She could not shut it out. How gladly she
  would have heard the news that he had been brought in&mdash;unhurt.</p>

  <p>At five o'clock she beheld her father turning in at the gate accompanied
  by Riever, At the sight of the latter Pen saw red. Hideous little creature
  lunching on his fine yacht while his dollars sent men into the woods to
  murder! And now to come strutting ashore for an afternoon stroll with his
  expensive cigar cocked between his lips! How dared he present himself to her!
  Her impulse was to project herself down off the porch and tell him! But a
  last strand of prudence held. She went to her room instead.</p>

  <p>There she struggled with her feelings. Five o'clock! Faint though it might
  be, there was a real chance that Don had escaped. She must therefore go on
  fighting for him. And in order to fight for him effectually she must maintain
  some sort of relations with his loathsome enemy.</p>

  <p>There was a knock on her door, and her father said timidly: "Mr. Riever is
  down stairs, my dear."</p>

  <p>Pen answered composedly: "Very well. I'll be down directly."</p>

  <p>Pendleton was delighted. "Thank you, daughter," he purred.</p>

  <p>It induced a fresh access of anger in Pen. He had nothing to thank her
  for!</p>

  <p>Pendleton pattered happily down-stairs. Pen washed and dressed, never
  ceasing to admonish herself, and in the end achieved a fair measure of
  self-command, though her nerves were in bad shape.</p>

  <p>Riever was waiting with a certain air of bravado. Only an involuntary roll
  to his eyes betrayed the dark passions that ate him. She greeted him calmly.
  He looked secretly relieved.</p>

  <p>"I scarcely expected to see you," he said smoothly. "I just came to
  enquire how you are."</p>

  <p>"I'm all right," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"And to express my indignation at what happened last night. Delehanty
  certainly goes beyond all bounds! When I get back to New York I shall talk to
  the Commissioner about it!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the man must do his work," said Pen. "Surely, he doesn't expect me to
  be taken in by this palaver!" she thought.</p>

  <p>"He's supposed to exercise some discretion...You're really all right
  again?"</p>

  <p>"Quite all right."</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad!"</p>

  <p>It came to her that he didn't expect her to be taken in. He was satisfied
  if she would only appear to be taken in. For different reasons he was just as
  anxious to maintain relations as she was. He just wanted everything
  unpleasant covered up. That was the spoiled child of it. Pen thought: "I
  believe he'd actually marry me without inquiring into my feelings." Well, it
  made it easier for her.</p>

  <p>Pendleton made some transparent excuse to leave the room. Riever's shifty
  eyes gave a roll of terror, thinking that perhaps Pen might now insist on
  dragging the truth into the light.</p>

  <p>Pen however only said: "I'm surprised to see you on foot this
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>His face turned smug again. "I like walking," he said. "It's my ridiculous
  people that insist on having me carried every step."</p>

  <p>"Do you walk much in New York?" asked Pen.</p>

  <p>He was flattered by her interest. "Yes, very much," he said.</p>

  <p>"But I forget, you don't live in the city, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Have you a home there, too?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly a home, but a very pleasant little lodging."</p>

  <p>"Ah, an apartment."</p>

  <p>"No, I detest apartments. One always feels as if the hall servants were
  spying on your comings and goings.</p>

  <p>"You stay at your club then?"</p>

  <p>"No, clubs are all very well in their way, but I'm not a clubby person. I
  like to spread about among my own things. In a club too, the servants are
  always under your feet. In New York I like to get away from servants
  altogether. I am not so dependent on them as you seem to think."</p>

  <p>Pen's heart began to beat a little thickly. "And have you such a place?"
  she asked with interest. Apparently they were back just where they had been
  before the violent scene of the previous night.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Do tell me about it."</p>

  <p>"It's a quaint little house in an unfashionable neighborhood. It stands in
  the name of my valet. The beauty of it is none of my neighbors know me and I
  can go and come as I please. It's a <i>petit maison</i> in the French style,
  a little <i>entresol</i> below, overhead three tall windows lighting the
  <i>salon</i>, then a receding attic, and that's all. I don't suppose there's
  another house like it in town."</p>

  <p>"And the inside?" said Pen.</p>

  <p>"A <i>salle a manger</i> on the ground floor looking out on a little
  formal garden at the back. On the main floor the salon in front and a bedroom
  in the rear. In the attic, servants rooms. Just a little house for one...Or
  two," he added with a sidelong glance.</p>

  <p>"How interesting!" said Pen. "I'd like to see it."</p>

  <p>"I hope you will some day."</p>

  <p>"In what part of the town is it?" asked Pen casually.</p>

  <p>"On Thirty-Ninth Street east of Lexington."</p>

  <p>Pen lowered her eyes to hide the glint of satisfaction in them. "This will
  help Blanche," she thought. "I'll write it to-night."</p>

  <p>Presently he rose to go. "Tell me you will," he said.</p>

  <p>"Will what?" murmured Pen.</p>

  <p>"Come to see my little house some day?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing is impossible," said Pen turning away her head. If he chose to
  read coquetry in the action, that was his look-out.</p>

  <p>He held her hand loverly-wise for a long moment, Pen steeling herself not
  to shudder. Then he left the room.</p>

  <p>Pen began to laugh but there was no sound of mirth in it. She began to
  laugh and she could not stop again. The tears ran down her face and her whole
  body was shaken with tearing sobs. She ran to her room. She was horribly
  unstrung. It was long before she could get hold of herself again.</p>

  <p>The collapse eased the strain on her nerves. She came down-stairs and was
  able to resume her usual round of tasks. Time was passing, and still no bad
  news had been received. Hope grew stronger. Finally word was brought down the
  road that the search party had joined forces with the line of guards drawn
  across the Neck, and Don Counsell had not been taken. Pen was able to face
  the night unafraid.</p>

  <p>She presently learned that Delehanty had formed his men into several camps
  for the night. The automobile was kept busy running up the road with supplies
  for them. At the same time he was preparing to have the road well patrolled
  along its whole course through the woods. After dark a fugitive could not
  travel any distance except by the road.</p>

  <p>The night came on muggy and still and Pen was attacked by a fresh anxiety.
  For clouds of mosquitoes arose. She pictured Don fainting with hunger and
  thirst, and unable even to make a smudge for fear of betraying himself,
  vainly attempting to protect himself from the insects.</p>

  <p>She had a wild hope that he might be driven back to her. When the house
  had been searched they had found the open cellar door, and in the morning
  Delehanty had sent a man to shut the doors and screw them down. Before she
  went to bed Pen took lantern and screw driver and satisfying herself that she
  was not watched at the moment, knelt behind the bushes and opened the doors.
  She also left the way open for Don to return to her room by the route that he
  knew of.</p>

  <p>She went to bed praying that she might awaken to find him kneeling on the
  floor beside her. She did sleep for awhile, for Nature must have her due, but
  when she awoke she was still alone.</p>

  <p>When she came down-stairs in the morning she heard a new sound that froze
  her soul, the deep bay of hounds. Theodo' came into the kitchen, his eyes
  rolling wildly in an ashy face, to say that a couple of "man-huntin' dawgs"
  had been brought over from the Eastern shore to be put on Counsell's tracks.
  These mythical creatures filled the negro with an extremity of terror.
  Nothing would tempt him out of doors again. Meanwhile Pen's collie, Doug,
  locked up in the barn, hearing these trespassers on his preserve, and he
  unable to get at them, went frantic with rage.</p>

  <p>The bloodhounds were taken to the spot in the woods where Don's cache had
  been discovered, and were given the scent from Don's clothes. They picked up
  his tracks without difficulty and came back over the fields, giving tongue
  straight to the cellar door. Delehanty finding it unlocked again, searched
  the house once more. The dogs were led around the house. Pen observing from
  within, saw that they picked up the trail again outside the kitchen window.
  So Don had gone out that way. However they were soon confused amidst the maze
  of tracks that tramped down the house grounds in every direction. Again and
  again their guardians led them over the ground with no better success.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Delehanty having made a new disposition of his forces, the
  search in the woods was resumed. He had more men at his disposal on this day,
  and a second line of guards was drawn across the Neck higher up. Additional
  detectives arrived from New York and Baltimore, and these were dispatched by
  horse and motor to search every cabin within miles. At the same time
  motor-boats were patrolling all the adjacent shores, so that if the fugitive
  was forced out on the beach at any point he would instantly be sighted.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding these measures the second day passed like the first with
  neither sight nor sound of the fugitive. It was believed that he was still in
  the neighborhood, because the bloodhounds though they were led far and wide
  through the woods and up the road, had discovered no tracks leading away from
  Broome's Point.</p>

  <p>When the morning of the third day broke Pen had reached the point of
  desperation again. Not for a moment all night had she closed her eyes. She
  was now convinced that Don was lying exhausted and starving in some hidden
  spot in the woods. Probably no longer even able to give himself up. For she
  was sure he would not willingly perish without a fight to clear his name.
  When she first came out of the house the sight of a pair of buzzards circling
  high against the blue, turned her faint and sick.</p>

  <p>To spend another day of inaction was unthinkable. Madness lay that way.
  There was no longer any question of helping him to escape. If he was anywhere
  near he must be found, whatever might come of it. In her extremity Pen went
  to Delehanty to tell him she was going to take part in the search.</p>

  <p>The detective was considerably taken aback. He pushed out his lower lip
  and glowered at Pen. "What's the idea?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I want him found."</p>

  <p>"It isn't so long ago since you wanted to lose him."</p>

  <p>Pen shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Have you any information?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"No. But I know these woods."</p>

  <p>"We all know them now," said Delehanty dryly. He considered for a moment.
  "Come back in half an hour and I'll talk to you," he said brusquely.</p>

  <p>Pen supposed that he wanted to consult with Riever. She was in no humor to
  wait.</p>

  <p>"You forget I don't have to have your permission to search my own place,"
  she said. "I offer to work with you. If you don't want me to I'll go ahead
  alone." She turned to leave.</p>

  <p>"Hold on a minute!" said the detective, "you satisfy me that you're on the
  square with me, and I'll work with you fast enough."</p>

  <p>Pen was able to tell him the truth&mdash;without telling him the whole
  truth, "It's very simple," she said. "I don't want him to starve on the
  place, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Humph! You've lost touch with him, eh?" said Delehanty.</p>

  <p>Pen was silent. It was of little moment to her what they <i>thought</i> so
  they did not <i>know</i> anything.</p>

  <p>"What's your plan?" asked Delehanty.</p>

  <p>"For one thing," said Pen, "the fields have never been searched. I see you
  send your men up the road every morning. There are hollows in the fields
  where a man could lie concealed. Some of the fields are growing up with young
  pine that would afford cover."</p>

  <p><br>
  <br>
  Delehanty looked at her with unwilling respect. "Anything else?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"If he's in the woods when he heard the searchers approach how easy it
  would be to climb a tree until they had passed."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to search every tree in the woods?" he asked
  sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"No," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"Will you take a couple of my men along with you?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Delehanty scowled darkly.</p>

  <p>"I shall call him as I go," said Pen. "If he saw or heard others with me
  he wouldn't be so likely to answer."</p>

  <p>"Suppose you find him and he refuses to give himself up?"</p>

  <p>"After three days without food he'd hardly be in a position to
  resist."</p>

  <p>"Would you undertake to bring him in?"</p>

  <p>"You can lend me a revolver if you want. I have none."</p>

  <p>"Not on your life!" sneered Delehanty.</p>

  <p>Pen shrugged. She had only mentioned the revolver as a bit of stage
  business anyway.</p>

  <p>"Go and find him if you want," said Delehanty, "but excuse me from taking
  any chances of having my gun slipped to him."</p>

  <p>Pen went back to the house and made up a packet of sandwiches. As she was
  setting out the second time she ran into Riever coming in by the drive. He
  had evidently been with Delehanty, and under his forced air of politeness an
  extraordinary conflict of feelings was suggested; hope, distrust and a
  gnawing curiosity. He would not speak of what was in his mind, of course.</p>

  <p>"Where are you setting out for so busily?" he asked with a false air of
  blitheness.</p>

  <p>Pen was blunt enough. "I believe this man is starving somewhere on the
  place, and I'm going to find him if I can."</p>

  <p>Riever put on a look of gladness and delight. The guiding rule of his kind
  is that by assuming a thing to be so you make it so. He therefore assumed
  that Pen had come over to his side, that the millions had won out, that he
  and she were now one in sympathy. It need hardly be mentioned though, that
  his eye still rolled with a hideous doubt.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's fine of you!" he said..."But it's dangerous!"</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't hurt me," said Pen.</p>

  <p>Riever ground his teeth secretly. "How can you be sure?" he said with a
  great air of solicitude.</p>

  <p>"Because I helped him in the beginning. I fed him."</p>

  <p>"But you've thought better of it now?" murmured Riever.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to find him if I can."</p>

  <p>"I believe you're out after the reward!" Riever said, with a ghastly sort
  of facetiousness.</p>

  <p>Pen caught at the suggestion. If she were obliged to bring Don in, the
  money might make all the difference to them. "Well, why not?" she said. "I
  could use the money as well as anybody."</p>

  <p>There was a quality of eagerness in her voice that could hardly have been
  feigned. For the moment it lulled his doubts. "There's nobody I'd rather pay
  it to," he said grinning.</p>

  <p>"You mean that?" said Pen. "If I give him up to you, will you pay me the
  reward?"</p>

  <p>"If you give him up to me I'll double it!" he said meaningly.</p>

  <p>"All right!" said Pen. "If I'm successful to-day, I'll hold you to that."
  She made to walk on.</p>

  <p>Riever's face was full of triumph, but there was still a fear too, another
  sort of fear. "Wait a minute," he said. "Suppose you can't handle him?"</p>

  <p>"I have no fear of that," said Pen.</p>

  <p>He slipped his hand in his side pocket. "Here," he said, "take this." He
  produced an automatic pistol. "Do you know how to use it?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. He explained the mechanism.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," she said putting it inside her dress, and walked on.</p>

  <p>He strutted after her as far as the gates, and stood there watching. She
  turned into the path behind the cottage, and followed it into the woods. Her
  idea in making the little temple her starting-point was that Don in need of
  succor, might haunt the paths they had followed together.</p>

  <p>The sun was looking straight into the little glade through the side that
  opened above the pond, filling the place with a rich yellow light. Between
  the shadows of the pillars a broad beam lay athwart the inscription of the
  gravestone, picking out the curly flourishes of the letters that had been
  sculped with such loving care. Pen was indifferent now to her shadowy brother
  who lay under the stone. She had not remembered him in many days. Her
  thoughts were filled by a man of flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>"Don! Don!" she spoke softly, not expecting any answer there, and not
  getting any.</p>

  <p>She let herself down the bank to the spring around at the left which
  welled between the roots of a superb white oak that the axe had spared. For a
  tree which guards a spring is sacred even to a timber scout. Pen had hopes of
  the spring because it was one of the only two places that Don knew of where
  fresh water was to be obtained. She searched carefully about it but was not
  rewarded by finding any tracks. She made a wider circuit of the spot but
  could not see that the underbrush had been disturbed.</p>

  <p>She forced her way slowly through the tangle of thorny creepers and
  thickly-springing sassafras around the pond to the old wood road. It curved
  away secretly into the gloom; old, undisturbed, overgrown; Nature had painted
  in this ancient blemish. Years ago the bed of the road had been packed so
  hard that even yet nothing would take root there except a mossy growth like
  fur underfoot. But at either side bushes had taken advantage of the free
  light to spring up thickly. Now for the most part they met overhead, though
  there were places where the sun splashed through.</p>

  <p>Pen walked slowly, pausing often to softly call Don's name. Nothing
  answered her but bird sounds, and the soft chattering of leaves in the high
  sunlight. No breath stirred down below. She made wide detours through
  secondary roads, mere cuts through the woods that only a practised eye could
  follow now.</p>

  <p>It was noon when she came out at the edge of the fields. She sat down
  under the fence to rest, and, from a sense of duty, to eat something.
  Afterwards she struck clear across the rough, neglected, cleared land to the
  woods on the other side, then back again, shaping a course that took her
  through every hollow. Her experience with sheep had taught her the exact lay
  of the peninsula, how each depression gradually deepened into a gully,
  running off to some branch on one side or the other. But nowhere did she find
  what she was looking for.</p>

  <p>She spent several hours searching the banks of the little stream that
  meandered through the woods to the east of the fields. That was where she had
  sent him to make his camp that night. She found the site of his camp, but no
  evidences that he had revisited it. There were plenty of tracks in the mud of
  the stream, for the searchers had passed and re-passed this way, but no voice
  answered her soft calls.</p>

  <p>Finally she struck across the corner of the farthest field, making for the
  path which went down through the woods to the arm of Back creek, that path
  they had followed on another night, a night of happiness. She thought of the
  old skiff drawn up on top of the bank, and had a wild hope that he might have
  launched it and succeeded in making his way down the arm and across the main
  creek to the mainland. True, the skiff was leaky and rotten, but a desperate
  man might make it serve for a short voyage. She ran the last part of the
  way.</p>

  <p>The skiff was there, just as before! She dropped down upon it, weary of
  body and despairing of heart, and burst into tears.</p>

  <p>"Don! Don! Don!" she called for the last time.</p>

  <p>A green heron mocked her with its discordant croak.</p>

  <p>The sun was low, and there could be no further searching that day. Pen
  made her heavy way back through the woods, and across the wide field. As she
  walked a merciful apathy descended on her. She could suffer no more.
  Imaginary pictures of Don starving in the woods no longer rose before her
  mind's eye. She was conscious only of a ghastly vacuum inside her. Within it
  a little thought stirred like a snake: "This can't go on! If I don't hear in
  two or three days more..." She never completed the thought, but her soul was
  aware of her intention.</p>

  <p>As she was letting down the bars that admitted her to the road, a squad of
  men straggled by, searchers homeward bound. Pen hung back to let them pass.
  The business was in the nature of a lark to them; young men relieved for the
  time being from the tedium of their usual lives, they were talking loud,
  laughing, jostling each other in the road. They stared at Pen as unabashed as
  animals, and Pen busied herself with the bars. Nevertheless she was aware
  that one of them did not stare at her. She looked at him, and was struck
  first, by his curiously self-conscious air. She looked afresh, rubbed her
  eyes so to speak, and her heart stood still.</p>

  <p>It was Don.</p>

  <p>True, his chin was covered with a four days' growth of reddish stubble,
  his bare head was touselled and un-brushed, he walked with exactly the same
  shambling slouch as the others. But it was Don. He had passed her, but the
  line of his cheek was enough, and the muscular back under the cotton shirt.
  She recognized the old garments she had herself carried to him. Far from
  being the starving wreck she had pictured, his cheek was full and ruddy, his
  whole body notwithstanding the shamble he affected, full of spring. For an
  instant she thought they had taken him. But that was manifestly ridiculous.
  He was skylarking with the rest. His whole bearing was that of a leader
  amongst them.</p>

  <p>Pen leaned against the fence post. A welter of emotions seemed to shatter
  her; joy, incredulity, terror that her wits might be wandering, anger at his
  careless air of well-being.</p>

  <p>Bye and bye she put up the bars mechanically, and started to walk along
  the road with a dazed air. She could not take in what had happened. Dusk was
  falling. In a couple of hundred yards a figure stepped out from the shadow of
  the bordering growth.</p>

  <p>"Pen!" it whispered.</p>

  <p>Her first reaction was to a shaking anger. She was a little beside
  herself. Stamping her foot in the road she cried in a soft, strained voice:
  "You Don! Cutting up like a school-boy in the road! Is that all you have on
  your mind!"</p>

  <p>He fell back a step in surprise. Then he laughed softly like the boy she
  accused him of being. "But Pen...aren't you glad?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, laugh! do!" she said bitterly. "It's nothing to you what I've been
  through these last three days and nights!"</p>

  <p>"I told you not to worry," he said sheepishly.</p>

  <p>"Told me not to worry! What do you think I am?"</p>

  <p>"There was no way in which I could let you hear from me. I thought you'd
  understand everything was all right."</p>

  <p>"You didn't care! You didn't care!"</p>

  <p>He moved close to her, "Pen dear, don't quarrel with me! We have only a
  moment. Even this is risky. There are more men coming along the road."</p>

  <p>She attempted to push him away. "Don't touch me! You're heartless and
  unfeeling!"</p>

  <p>Even as she said it she began to sob. She swayed on her feet, and Don
  flung an arm about her. She clung to him piteously.</p>

  <p>"Oh my darling! my darling!...Thank God! I have you!...Don't pay any
  attention to what I say. I have suffered so. I was just at the end of my
  string. If I had not found you soon I...I..."</p>

  <p>"Hush, dearest!" he murmured, sobered and remorseful. "You mustn't say
  such things. I can't bear it!...It's true I never thought. I had such
  confidence in your strength."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were starving in the woods. I couldn't eat when I thought
  you had nothing! I couldn't sleep, seeing you lying there."</p>

  <p>"Hush! Hush!" he soothed her. "Everything is all right now. Pull yourself
  together, dearest. There are stragglers all along the road."</p>

  <p>Indeed they could now hear footfalls coming along behind them. They
  started to walk too, Don straining Pen hard against his side. Everybody was
  traveling the same way. Gradually Pen's breast quieted down.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It means I'm one of the searchers for Don Counsell," he said with a
  chuckle. "Only place they'd never think of looking for me."</p>

  <p>She looked at him a little aghast.</p>

  <p>"And I've made good in the job, too," he went on. "I'm considered quite a
  valuable man. Delehanty has put me in charge of a squad."</p>

  <p>"Delehanty!" she gasped. "Do you mean you have spoken to him?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? He doesn't know Don Counsell by sight. None of his men do. The
  only one who knows me is Riever, and I take damn good care to keep out of his
  way. Luckily it's easy. He doesn't bother with the rough necks. And you can
  always see him coming a long way off by his gang."</p>

  <p>"How did it come about?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Most natural thing in the world. My way is different from yours. You plan
  everything out, and I leave it to the inspiration of the moment. When I tried
  to get out by the cellar that night I heard a man down there. They had one
  out on the kitchen porch, too. So I took the screen out of the window on the
  other side, and dropped to the ground and hid in the shrubbery. I gradually
  made my way down to the beach. There were some natives camping there, but I
  was afraid to join them then, so I kept under cover until daylight. In the
  morning a raft of newcomers arrived from all over, and it was a simple matter
  to mix amongst them. They didn't all know each other."</p>

  <p>"But you speak differently from these people," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I kept my mouth shut as much as possible. I gave out that I was Frank
  Jones from New Jersey, see? That accounted for my Northern speech. I said I
  was off a coasting schooner. Meanwhile I've been practising their lingo, and
  I can already speak Mar'land at least well enough to deceive Delehanty and
  the other Northerners. Doggone it honey Ah reckon Ah kin <i>tawk</i>! 'Deed,
  can I! Gemmen, it's the <i>trewth!"</i></p>

  <p>Pen laughed down his neck.</p>

  <p>"Every day that passes makes my position more secure," he said. "I'm
  becoming known. At least Frank Jones is. This crop of saw-tooth is a
  wonderful disguise."</p>

  <p>He softly rubbed his chin against her cheek. Pen liked it.</p>

  <p>There came a hail from down the road ahead. "Hey, Jones!"</p>

  <p>They moved apart. Don answered: "Coming!" To Pen he said breathlessly:
  "How can we meet?...Oh woman, if you knew how I was hungering for you day and
  night!"</p>

  <p>"No! No!" said Pen. "Everything's going so well. We mustn't take
  risks...But we ought to have some way of communicating."</p>

  <p>"Name it quick!"</p>

  <p>She considered swiftly. "...Do you know my fattening-coop under the tree
  back of the kitchen?"</p>

  <p>"I can find it."</p>

  <p>"There's a little water-pan inside it. Look under that for a letter."</p>

  <p>"All right," he laughed. "If I'm pinched for swiping chickens you'll have
  to clear me!"</p>

  <p>He ran down the road. Pen followed at a sober pace&mdash;still a little
  dazed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="XI"
     id="XI"></a>XI. &mdash; PEN'S HAND IS FORCED</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a justly aggrieved father that Pen found awaiting her
  in the dining-room.</p>

  <p>"Half-past eight!" he said. "Where on earth have you been!"</p>

  <p>Pen was quiet and starry-eyed with happiness. It didn't matter much to her
  what she said. But she rather wished to avoid a scene. She juggled with the
  truth a little.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Delehanty wanted me to help him with the search."</p>

  <p>"Delehanty!...Wanted you!" he said amazed. It was too much for him.</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Riever," Pen added as an afterthought.</p>

  <p>The magic name mollified him a little. "Hum! Ha!...Well, if Riever
  knew...What suddenly started you off on this tack?"</p>

  <p>"I want this business over with!"</p>

  <p>"I confess I fail to understand you!" he said severely..."What help could
  you give them anyway?"</p>

  <p>"I know the place so well!"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say you have been searching the woods...with all these
  strangers about?"</p>

  <p>"I had only to raise my voice to bring a dozen to my aid...Besides, Mr.
  Riever lent me a revolver."</p>

  <p>"Oh!...Well you might have taken your father into your confidence...Did
  you find anything?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>A more perspicacious man might have remarked the little catch of joy with
  which she said it, but never Pendleton. "The supper is cold," he said
  fretfully. "Aunt Maria's gone home."</p>

  <p>"Never mind," said Pen. Out of the riches in her breast she could spare
  affection for him, the dear, trying child! She kissed his bald spot. "I'll
  make a cup of tea for myself."</p>

  <p>"I got the mail this afternoon," he grumbled. "There's a letter for
  you."</p>

  <p>"Eh?" said Pen sharply.</p>

  <p>"On your plate. I never saw the handwriting before."</p>

  <p>Pen glided swiftly around the table. "I never saw it either," she said.
  Which was perfectly true. A scrawling, half-formed hand. The post-mark "New
  York" told her all that she needed to know.</p>

  <p>She thrust it carelessly in her belt and went out into the kitchen.
  Pendleton looked affronted. He was terribly curious. Pen lit the oil stove
  and put the kettle on. Then she read her letter.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Miss</span>:</p>

  <p class="letter">I'm not much at writing. Please excuse mistakes. Well Miss
  Broome I guess you were right, all right. Everything bears out what you said.
  I and the fellows have made a good beginning, but we haven't cinched it yet
  by a good deal. Of course in a job like this you got to be absolutely
  bomb-proof before you put yourself under fire. I guess you get me. Just at
  present we're stalled for the lack of coin. I've raised every nickel I could
  amongst the fellows and it's all gone flooey. And not a job stirring. We got
  to have five hundred quick. A thousand would be better. Bring it up yourself.
  We got to have somebody to stop at a certain swell joint. None of us was able
  to get by with it. For God's sake get the money, if you have to purloin your
  old man's sock. Everything depends on your turning up with it the next day or
  so. No need for me to sign this.</p>

  <p><br>
  A few minutes later Pendleton entered the kitchen to find Pen leaning against
  the table in a brown study, the open letter in her hand. The kettle was
  boiling unheeded.</p>

  <p>"Who's your letter from?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh...that!" said Pen with a laugh. She was obliged to extemporize
  quickly. "Such an odd thing! Do you remember the little foundling that used
  to work for the Snellings on the Island? Something has led the child to write
  to me."</p>

  <p>"Let's see," he said, holding out his hand.</p>

  <p>"I can't. Dad. The poor little thing is telling me her troubles."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" snorted Pendleton, and passed on out of doors.</p>

  <p>Pen carried her supper into the dining-room. She sat, abstractedly
  stirring her cup, and munching a sandwich, while the same phrase ran around
  and around in her head. "Got to have five hundred, a thousand would be
  better!" Blanche might almost as well have asked her for a million, she
  thought sighing. Bye and bye Pendleton having finished his chores, came in
  again.</p>

  <p>"Sit down a minute, Dad," she said. "I want to talk to you."</p>

  <p>Anticipating something unpleasant, he dropped into a chair grumbling.</p>

  <p>"This business has about finished me up," said Pen. "I must get away for
  awhile."</p>

  <p>"You're looking particularly well to me," he said.</p>

  <p>She refused to be drawn off.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to make of you," he went on crossly. "A while ago you
  were all for helping in the search."</p>

  <p>"I hoped to end it," said Pen. "But I was unsuccessful."</p>

  <p>Pendleton scowled sulkily at the table. "You know what I want you to do,"
  he muttered.</p>

  <p>"That can wait," said Pen cautiously.</p>

  <p>"You may not get the chance, later."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I have the chance now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, let's talk plainly!" Pendleton burst out, but still not meeting her
  eye. "This is no time for false delicacy. Anybody could see that Riever wants
  you. He's given me to understand in the broadest way that you have only to
  say the word. Even after the extraordinary way you have acted. You still have
  a chance. What makes you hold back? You've got to marry somebody. Men are all
  much the same. Marriage is no bed of roses at the best!...Am I not your
  father? Would I be advising you to anything that wasn't for your good? It's a
  wonderful chance! a wonderful chance, I tell you!...And you talk about going
  away!" The little man was almost ready to weep.</p>

  <p>Pen schooled herself to patience. "If Mr. Riever is really in earnest my
  going away will not make any difference...It's said to be a very good move,"
  she added slyly.</p>

  <p>"Not where a man like Riever is concerned!" cried Pendleton. "He's
  accustomed to be courted, to be deferred to. He'd never get over such an
  affront. He'd pull up anchor and sail away never to return!"</p>

  <p>Pen thought: "Ah, if he would!"</p>

  <p>"What was in that letter you got?" demanded Pendleton. "Has that got
  anything to do with it?"</p>

  <p>Pen was startled. She saw, however, that it was merely a hit in the dark.
  He had no real suspicion. The best way was to ignore his question as unworthy
  of being answered. "Won't you give me the money?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Where am I going to get it."</p>

  <p>Pen was significantly silent.</p>

  <p>"A while ago you would not touch that money with a poker!" he burst
  out.</p>

  <p>"It is not easy to ask for it," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"How much do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Five hundred dollars!" said Pen with her heart in her mouth.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred dollars!" he stormed. "Five hundred dollars! Why you could
  go to your Cousin Laura Lee's and back for twenty!"</p>

  <p>"Wherever I went I would need clothes," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"I offered you money for clothes, and you scorned it!"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry now. I have thought better of it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have, have you? Well permit me to remind you that the clothes
  were to wear here, and not to go away in!" He started out of the room
  blustering noisily to cover his retreat. "Five hundred dollars! To ruin your
  chances! Never heard of such folly! Never speak to me of this again! Five
  hundred dollars!"</p>

  <p>He kept on talking right up-stairs. Pen remained sitting at the table
  looking at her empty hands.</p>

  <p>She sat thinking and thinking; stirring the tea which had long ago turned
  cold. The only possible way she had of raising money was through the sale of
  her sheep. She had considered that once before. Her father would try to
  prevent her of course, but she might drive them up the Neck road at night and
  put them on the steamboat from one of the Bay wharves. But Delehanty's men
  were watching the road at a dozen points.</p>

  <p>In her perplexity Pen felt a great longing to consult with Don. Two heads
  were better than one, she told herself. Perhaps the truth was she just wanted
  to be with him. She was thankful she had made an arrangement to communicate.
  In the ordinary course he could hardly expect a letter from her until the
  next day, but thinking of his boyish eagerness it seemed quite possible that
  he might come back that night on the chance of hearing from her. At any rate
  it was worth trying.</p>

  <p>She got a scrap of paper and a pencil, and wrote four lines:</p>

  <p>"I must see you. I'll put on an old dress and a sunbonnet and walk on the
  beach near the lighthouse at eleven. If you don't get this to-night I'll come
  tomorrow night."</p>

  <p>Pen put this into the agreed place, and returned to the house, wondering
  how she would put in the hour and a half that remained before eleven. She
  determined to watch to see whether he came for the note. So she went
  up-stairs rather noisily, and came down again very quietly, carrying with her
  what she needed for her disguise.</p>

  <p>She took up her position on a chair in the dark kitchen, placed against
  the wall in such a way that she could look obliquely through the window in
  the direction of her chicken coop. The moon was not up yet, and it was pitch
  dark under the tree. She could see nothing, but she was sure no one could
  visit the spot without her being aware of it.</p>

  <p>And after all she dozed. She had had little enough sleep of late, and now
  that the most pressing weight was lifted from her breast, the night laid a
  finger on her eyelids without her being aware of it. The katydids, the
  crickets, the distant murmur of the waves on the Bay shore gradually
  undermined wakefulness. Her head swayed against the wall.</p>

  <p>She awakened, scarcely knowing she had slept. Somebody was outside. She
  was electrically conscious of it, though for a moment she could hear nothing.
  Then a soft, masculine chuckle came out of the dark. There was more than one
  evidently, for men do not as a rule chuckle when alone. A voice
  whispered.</p>

  <p>"Doggone, if it ain't a coop, fellas! What say to a nice fat pullet for
  breakfast?"</p>

  <p>It suddenly came to her this was Don's voice, with his exaggerated
  Maryland drawl. Her heart beat fast.</p>

  <p>Another voice answered: "Watch yourself, Jones. Those damn birds'll raise
  the dead if you lay hand to them!"</p>

  <p>"On'y one squawk before I get her neck wrung," laughed Don. "I got the lay
  of the land. That whitewashed fence yonder marks the garden. Run down the
  rows to the next fence and you're safe!"</p>

  <p>A silence followed. Pen, straining her ears heard, or imagined that she
  heard the latch softly raised, the door opened, and the little pan softly
  moved inside. Then Don's voice again:</p>

  <p>"By Golly! It's empty!"</p>

  <p>The words were spoken in the conventional tones of disappointment but Pen
  and none but Pen could hear the thrilling little lift in his voice. She was
  assured that the note was tight clasped in his hands. The voices moved
  away.</p>

  <p>Pen cautiously consulted her watch. It was half-past ten. She must start
  at once in order to keep her appointment, for she must take a roundabout and
  difficult way. Pendleton's snores were resounding through the house, and in
  the back hall where the light could not betray her out-of-doors, she lit a
  little lamp and arrayed herself. She had a black cotton servant's dress that
  had been designed to fit a more ample figure than hers. She put it on and
  stuffed it out with old cotton until her own shape was altered beyond
  recognition. Drawing her hair straight back from her face, she twisted it
  into a tight knot behind, and pulled the sunbonnet over her head. For the
  dark it was a sufficiently effective disguise.</p>

  <p>It was still very dark out of doors. Slipping out of the back door, she
  made her way to the old paddock behind the house grounds, and gaining the
  road from here, climbed a fence on the other side and struck across the
  little triangular field for the woods. It was the way she had gone once
  before to meet Don. Forcing her way through the undergrowth she gained her
  own path and so reached the little temple. From this point she struck out a
  line that would bring her out on the Bay shore. The sound of the waves guided
  her. When she had gone a little way she began to catch glimpses of the
  Broome's Point light between the tree trunks, and that gave her an exact
  course.</p>

  <p>But this part of the woods was densely grown up, and it was hard, slow
  going. She had to feel her way through the tangle, and the thorns scratched
  her hands and tore her dress. She put her foot into unsuspected holes and
  came down heavily. It was only a couple of hundred yards, but she could
  progress but a foot at a time. It seemed as if an age passed before she slid
  down the steep bank and gained the sand. From around the point she heard six
  bells sounded melodiously aboard the <i>Alexandra</i>, and broke into a run.
  The tide was falling, and there was firm hard footing along the water's
  edge.</p>

  <p>The lighthouse stood on its spidery stilts only a hundred feet or so off
  the beach. As she came close Pen could make out old Weems Locket the keeper,
  standing on the little gallery that encircled his octagonal house, with a
  companion. She slowed down. The two were leaning on the rail looking out
  across the Bay, smoking cigars. Even if they had looked in her direction they
  could scarcely have seen her, for her black dress was lost against the bushes
  that bordered the sand. There was a fresh breeze off the water that swallowed
  sounds. The first narrow edge of a smoky, orange moon was rising out of the
  Bay.</p>

  <p>Pen breathed more freely after rounding the point. The old wharf was now
  about a quarter of a mile in front of her. The natives were camped on the
  beach on both sides of the wharf, and as she approached Pen could see the
  fires burning low in front of the tents, but no figures stirring. On board
  the <i>Alexandra</i> lights still shone from the deckhouse windows.</p>

  <p>Pen, not daring to go close to the tents, came to a stand about a furlong
  off. There was no sign of Don. But presently she heard somebody coming from
  the other direction, the way she had herself come, someone softly whistling a
  tune. Thinking she must have passed him somehow, she turned eagerly. On this
  side of the point the rising moon was hidden behind the intervening high
  ground. A figure emerged out of the murk and Pen instantly perceived that it
  was not Don. It was too late to escape then.</p>

  <p>"A skirt!" exclaimed a rough, young voice, surprised. "What are you doing
  out so late, sister?" He spread out his arms to bar her way.</p>

  <p>"Let me by!" murmured Pen.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Let's have a squint at you."</p>

  <p>He lit a match with his thumb-nail. Quick as thought Pen blew out the
  flame. The young fellow laughed. Pen tried to dart by him. He flung out an
  arm and gathered her in. She struggled in silent desperation.</p>

  <p>"Young and souple as willow, I swear," laughed the man. "What you got so
  much clothes on for?...Gee! you smell as sweet as honeysuck'!"</p>

  <p>Pen beat his face with her clenched fists. He simply lowered his head
  laughing, and clung to her. She had a sickening feeling of helplessness, and
  she dared not call for help. It was all over in half a minute. She heard
  running footsteps from the direction of the camp, and felt herself suddenly
  released.</p>

  <p>The newcomer was Don. "What's this?" he cried with an oath that startled
  Pen&mdash;and charmed her.</p>

  <p>"Hell, I didn't know it was your propitty, Jones," the other man said
  sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Damn you...!"</p>

  <p>Pen apprehended a blow about to be given, and as in a flash, the ghastly
  consequences of a fight there, were revealed to her. She flung her arms
  around Don, and clung to him without speaking. He understood. He conquered
  his rage with a groan.</p>

  <p>"Well ...get out!" he said thickly.</p>

  <p>The other man melted away into the dark.</p>

  <p>Pen and Don clung to each other. Of the two the man was the more shaken.
  Moments passed before he could speak. Then:</p>

  <p>"Oh my girl! my girl!"</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," Pen said. "I am not made of glass."</p>

  <p>"My fault because I was late," he groaned. "I couldn't get rid of those
  fellows I was with."</p>

  <p>"I am safe," Pen said. "Forget about it. I have something to tell you.
  There is little time."</p>

  <p>They started to walk slowly away from the direction of the camp. Pen
  repeated Blanche Paglar's letter to him word for word. It arrested his
  attention, and he quieted down. When they found themselves drawing too near
  the lighthouse, they turned and came slowly back, Don straining Pen against
  his side.</p>

  <p>When she had described her problem, Don said instantly: "There's just one
  thing to do. You must give me up to Riever and collect the reward."</p>

  <p>Pen's breast contracted sharply. She bitterly blamed herself. Why had she
  not foreseen that this was what he would say. She couldn't answer.</p>

  <p>"How about it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"But if it's the best thing to do?"</p>

  <p>"I simply couldn't!"</p>

  <p>"Listen, dearest, we must think this thing clean through to the end. These
  people in New York seem to have started something. Well, that being so, this
  seems to me as good an opportunity as any, for me to come out and put up my
  fight."</p>

  <p>"I must find out first how much they've learned."</p>

  <p>"She says it is not complete. But they've started something. They seem to
  be on the level with us. We must back them up before the trail grows
  cold."</p>

  <p>"I could find another way of raising the money."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather use Riever's money," he said dryly. "I've got to stand trial
  anyhow. It will take a whole lot of money, and I don't see any other way of
  raising it. There'd be a sort of poetic justice in making Riever pay the
  expenses of my trial. But we must act quickly. He's bound to find out that
  you and I are working together. Then he'd never pay you the reward."</p>

  <p>"How could I bring myself to do such a thing!"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute! Suppose we do nothing, what will happen? Oh, I'm in no
  particular danger now. In a few days they'll get sick of this search and give
  it up. I can see signs of it coming. Well, I can go back to the Eastern shore
  with the fellows I'm chumming with and get clean away. I've a new identity
  all established. But what then? What sort of a life would I have? I'd be a
  sort of wandering Jew without a friend in the world, except you, and I
  wouldn't dare communicate with you. I'd be one of the miserable floaters that
  have to do the dirtiest work for the least pay. God! when you are really on
  the outs of things you're up against it! You're at the bottom of a pit with
  smooth walls!"</p>

  <p>"Wherever you were I would be," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't take you!" he said simply. "Not that! Not unless we could hold
  our heads up."</p>

  <p>"How could I do it?" murmured poor Pen. "How could I make my lips shape
  the words?"</p>

  <p>"But if it was I you were doing it for, dearest...?"</p>

  <p>Slowly pacing up and down cheek to cheek, they endlessly and lovingly
  disputed the question without being able to come to a conclusion. In their
  deep preoccupation they became careless. The slab-sided moon rose over the
  high bank, and shone upon them full, and they gave no heed.</p>

  <p>The edge of the beach was bordered with the brittle woody bushes that the
  natives call water-weed. Pen and Don had paused in their pacing, and were
  standing looking into each other's faces with their clasped hands between
  them. Suddenly from behind a clump of bushes immediately alongside them rose
  the figure of a man. He was silhouetted against the moon with a significant
  raised arm.</p>

  <p>"Hands up, Counsell! I got you covered!"</p>

  <p>Don acted like a lightning flash. With a thrust out of his arms he sent
  Pen reeling backwards. She fell in the sand. At the same instant Don dived
  low through the bushes and caught the other man around the legs. He measured
  his length in the sand. It was so quick that he did not even fire. The pistol
  flew out of his hand. Pen following a blind instinct, scrambled on hands and
  knees and secured it.</p>

  <p>Don had flung himself on the other man, and they were struggling furiously
  and silently in the sand. Don kept on top. When Pen's eyes were able to
  distinguish between them, she saw that Don was planted on the other man's
  chest, holding one of his arms down with one hand, and pressing his other
  hand over the man's mouth. With his free hand the man struck ineffectually up
  at Don's body, or tried in vain to pull away the hand that covered his mouth.
  His legs were thrashing wildly.</p>

  <p>"Something to gag him with," panted Don.</p>

  <p>Pen tore off her sun-bonnet and rolling it up with the strings out handed
  it over. She sat on the man's right arm, when Don was obliged to release it.
  Somehow Don managed to force the twisted roll of cotton between his teeth,
  and with Pen's aid, passed the strings under his head and tied the gag with
  the knots in front. Sepulchral groans issued from beneath it.</p>

  <p>"Something to tie his hands and feet!" whispered Don.</p>

  <p>Pen, anticipating it, already had her apron off. She managed to tear off
  the band, which with the strings attached, made a useful lashing. Between the
  two of them they got the struggling man turned over, and finally got his
  wrists tied behind him. With the rest of the apron they bound his ankles
  together. Don rolled his coat around the man's head to stifle his groans, and
  they stood up and looked anxiously up and down the beach. They were about
  half way between the lighthouse and the tents. Nothing stirred in either
  direction.</p>

  <p>Don looked down at the helpless figure. "Who do you suppose it is?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Keesing, one of the detectives," said Pen. "I recognized his voice. He
  must have followed me down here...But I don't see how he could."</p>

  <p>Don shook his head. "More likely Pardoe&mdash;the man you ran into here,
  told him something and he came snooping around just on a chance. I gave
  myself away with my own talk."</p>

  <p>They were silent for a moment. Both were thinking of the same thing.</p>

  <p>Don said: "Well...I guess the die is cast for us now."</p>

  <p>Pen clasped her hands. "Oh, Don!"</p>

  <p>"You've got to march me out on board the yacht quick and give me up."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Don!"</p>

  <p>"This fellow will soon wriggle loose. Then the fat will be in the fire.
  You must see there's no other way."</p>

  <p>She nodded despairingly.</p>

  <p>"Come on," said Don. "...I guess Riever won't mind being roused up for
  such a purpose," he added grimly. "Bring the fellow's gun with you."</p>

  <p>They set off down the beach.</p>

  <p>"This man will tell Riever that I didn't intend to bring you in," said
  Pen.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to cook up some yarn...Tell Riever you were bringing me in
  when this fellow Keesing tried to horn in on the reward."</p>

  <p>There was no sound of waking life about the tents. On the beach in front,
  all sorts and sizes of skiffs were drawn up. They chose the first one that
  had oars lying in it. The falling tide had left it high and dry, and it
  required a strenuous effort on Don's part to launch it. At the scraping of
  the bottom on the sand, a voice issued out of the nearest tent:</p>

  <p>"Who's that?"</p>

  <p>A lean and disheveled shadow appeared in the tent opening.</p>

  <p>"It's Jones," said Don lightly. "Just want to take a lady for a little
  row."</p>

  <p>"Oh all right, Jones. Go as far as you like."</p>

  <p>"I'm popular with the gang," murmured Don dryly.</p>

  <p>He only had three hundred yards to row to the yacht. It was one thing to
  decide resolutely to give himself up, and another thing to put it into
  practice. He took half a dozen strokes energetically, and then loafed at the
  oars, gazing hungrily at Pen.</p>

  <p>Pen suddenly conscious of the absurd figure she must be making, put up her
  hands and unpinning her hair, shook it about her shoulders. Don drew in his
  oars, and creeping aft caught up the dark tide and pressed it to his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Oh, why do you do that now?" he groaned. "You are so beautiful that
  way?"</p>

  <p>Pen caught his head against her breast. "How can I? How can I? How can I?"
  she murmured.</p>

  <p>Don with a sigh went back to his oars.</p>

  <p>Pen with a twist or two, put up her hair in more becoming fashion. She
  began to pull out the various lengths of cotton with which she had stuffed
  out her bodice, and dropped them overboard. Don, the irrepressible, began to
  laugh shakily. Pen gasped, and laughed too. They looked at each other and
  laughed softly until they felt weak.</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" asked Don at last.</p>

  <p>Pen fishing around inside her dress nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm relieved," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, but it's dreadful to laugh now," Pen murmured remorsefully.</p>

  <p>"It's the only thing to do," said Don simply.</p>

  <p>He was sober enough when they touched the side of the yacht. He made the
  skiff's painter fast to the grating at the foot of the ladder, and stepping
  out, drew Pen up beside him.</p>

  <p>"Kiss me," he whispered. "Maybe it'll be the last...!"</p>

  <p>A murmur of pain was forced from Pen's breast.</p>

  <p>"I mean for a good while," he hastily added.</p>

  <p>They clung together. His face was wet from hers.</p>

  <p>The sound of a footfall on the deck overhead caused them to draw apart
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"Take the gun in your hand," Don whispered.</p>

  <p>They went up the ladder, Don in advance. On the deck an astonished
  watchman faced them.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I am Miss Broome," said Pen. "I want to see Mr. Riever."</p>

  <p>"He's turned in, Miss."</p>

  <p>In order to avoid frightening him unduly. Pen kept the pistol hidden in a
  fold of her skirt. "He must be awakened," she said. "It is important."</p>

  <p>The watchman, like everybody else on board the yacht, had gathered from
  watching his master that Pen was a person to be propitiated. "I'll tell him,"
  he said, and disappeared within the deckhouse.</p>

  <p>Pen and Don left alone on deck, leaned over the rail and pressing their
  shoulders together, gazed down at the black water etched with phosphorescence
  where the little waves lapped against the vessel's side and rolled back
  again.</p>

  <p>"I love you," Don whispered. "Whatever happens, you have made life to me
  worth living."</p>

  <p>Pen caught her breath. "Ah, don't speak," she murmured. "Or I sha'n't...be
  able to go through with it."</p>

  <p>They groped for each other's hands.</p>

  <p>They had not to wait long. They saw Riever coming through the lighted deck
  saloon before he could see them. The watchman accompanied him, and another
  man, a sort of valet-bodyguard. Riever was wearing a gorgeous orange and blue
  flowered dressing gown. His face looked puffier than by day, but his thin
  hair was carefully brushed. He had an expression of oddly strained
  eagerness.</p>

  <p>As they came through the door, one of the men turned a switch and the deck
  was flooded with light. Riever's sharpened gaze flew first to Pen's face, and
  from Pen to Don. For a fraction of a second he did not recognize him, but Don
  grinned, and said coolly:</p>

  <p>"Hello, Ernest!"</p>

  <p>Then he knew. His face became convulsed. "Counsell!" he cried in a high
  strained voice. He whirled on the watchman. "Blow your whistle! Rouse the
  ship!"</p>

  <p>The shrill, wailing sound pierced the night.</p>

  <p>Half beside himself Riever cried to Don: "You fox! I've run you to earth
  at last!"</p>

  <p>"You didn't," said Don, smiling at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"Well, you're caught! You've seen the last of the sun. You're done
  for!"</p>

  <p>Doors opened and slammed throughout the yacht. Feet came running. Among
  the first to arrive was the skipper from his quarters up forward, struggling
  into his coat as he ran. Pen looked on at it all, strangely detached. She
  felt as if she were watching the actors in the scene, including herself, from
  some point outside her body.</p>

  <p>To each new arrival Riever cried: "We've got Counsell!" It was almost a
  scream. "There he is! Secure him! Put him in the strong room forward of the
  staterooms. Have an armed guard at the door day and night. If he resists put
  him in irons!"</p>

  <p>The skipper and another clapped hands on Don's shoulders.</p>

  <p>Don said: "Take your hands off me, and I'll go with you quietly."</p>

  <p>Surrounded by his creatures, Riever, his face swollen and flaming, walked
  up close to Don and all but spat on him. He had lost all control of himself.
  He had forgotten Pen's presence. "You grinning blackguard!" he cried. "Grin
  while you can! You won't be grinning when they lead you out to the chair! And
  I'll be there to see it!"</p>

  <p>Pen turned away her face. She could not be angry at the little man; he was
  beneath it. She was sickened with disgust. As for Don, he merely drew down
  the corners of his lips aggravatingly, and drawled:</p>

  <p>"Be yourself! Be yourself, Ernest! You're all wet!"</p>

  <p>A titter was heard on the outside of the circle.</p>

  <p>"Take him away!" Riever cried furiously.</p>

  <p>Most of the men accompanied the skipper and his prisoner along the deck to
  the forward companionway. A steward or two was left hanging about the after
  deck, and a pretty, frightened stewardess, clutching a pink kimono about
  her.</p>

  <p>"Get away! Get away&mdash;all of you!" yelled Riever waving his arms.</p>

  <p>When they were left alone on deck Riever went to Pen where she stood on
  the same spot in the same position, the pistol hanging limply down. He said
  thickly:</p>

  <p>"My darling! Now I know you're mine!"</p>

  <p>A sharp little cry escaped Pen. She had overlooked this possibility.
  Instinctively her hands went up between them. She did not point the gun at
  him, but its mere presence in her hand was sufficient to bring him to a
  stand. She backed slowly to the rail. When she hit against it, she glanced
  down over her shoulder at the dark water with a curious lightening of the
  horror in her face.</p>

  <p>That glance overboard was not lost on Riever. He looked at her, scowling
  and pulling at his lip. Lest he should hear what would be intolerable to his
  self-love, he made haste to furnish reasons for her conduct.</p>

  <p>"Of course...you're all upset!" he muttered. "It's natural after such a
  strain ...I understand..."</p>

  <p>Pen was suddenly overcome by weakness. The gun clattered to the deck. She
  staggered to the nearest deck-chair and sank into it.</p>

  <p>Riever called sharply: "Carter!"</p>

  <p>The pink-clad stewardess appeared miraculously in the cabin doorway.</p>

  <p>"Miss Broome is faint," said Riever. "Get smelling-salts!"</p>

  <p>Pen wanted to keep the girl out on deck. "Wait!" she said weakly. "I'm not
  going to faint. I want nothing...I only want to go home."</p>

  <p>Riever bent over her. She closed her eyes to avoid seeing him. "Of course
  that's what you want," he murmured. "I'll take you just as quick as I can
  dress."</p>

  <p>Pen did not protest, because by this time she had regained sufficient
  self-possession to realize that, until this man had fulfilled his promise to
  her, she must not rebuff him too much, though she did indeed almost faint
  with horror at his nearness.</p>

  <p>As he left the deck he ordered the girl to stay with Pen. The girl came
  sidling towards her with an emotion in her face that she could not control.
  Her eyes were both hard and soft on Pen. In that look Pen saw as clearly as
  if it had been written on the girl that she was Riever's mistress, but at
  that moment the discovery caused her no feeling.</p>

  <p>"Can I get you anything, Miss?" the girl asked in a purring tone.</p>

  <p>"No thank you," said Pen. "You needn't wait."</p>

  <p>She retreated to the deck saloon, where she stood hovering in the doorway,
  stealing glances at Pen that were diffident, wistful and sneering.</p>

  <p>Riever came back fully dressed, and attended by various servitors. The
  speed-boat was brought around to the gangway ladder, and Pen handed in. She
  had picked up the gun and concealed it within her dress.</p>

  <p>"That skiff belongs to one of the men in the tents," she said
  pointing.</p>

  <p>A sailor was told off to row it ashore.</p>

  <p>They landed on the old wharf, and Riever led her up the hill. To Pen's
  relief they were followed a hundred feet or so behind, by a body-guard.
  Riever had his hand under her elbow. She would not allow herself to object to
  that, though her flesh crawled at his touch.</p>

  <p>"You feel better now?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Tell me how it came about."</p>

  <p>She had her story ready for him. She cut it as cunningly to the pattern of
  truth as she could. "I searched to-day in all the places I knew of, but I
  found no trace of him. On my way home along the road this evening I saw him
  returning amongst the other searchers. It seems he joined the searchers some
  days ago. That's why you couldn't find him."</p>

  <p>"What devilish cunning!" cried Riever.</p>

  <p>"It was growing dark," Pen went on. "He dropped behind the men he was
  with, and we had some talk. We couldn't say much there amongst all those
  people&mdash;I wasn't going to let them know, so I made an appointment with
  him to meet me on the beach at eleven, when I supposed everything would have
  quieted down. He suspected nothing."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he thinks he's irresistible!" sneered Riever. "...It was dangerous.
  You should have arranged to have men concealed there."</p>

  <p>"I wanted to deliver him up to you myself as I said I would."</p>

  <p>"You are wonderful!" murmured Riever.</p>

  <p>"I went armed," said Pen. "And I forced him to come with me. That's
  all."</p>

  <p>Riever carried her hand to his lips. "You are a woman in a thousand!" he
  cried. "I never heard of such pluck!"</p>

  <p>Pen pulled her hand away. "Please! <i>Please!"</i> she murmured. "I can't
  stand it!...Not to-night!"</p>

  <p>He eagerly snatched at the little promise she held out. "Ah, I won't press
  you," he said amorously. "I know how you must be feeling. Tender-hearted
  woman and all that. Cuts you all up to have to give up a man to justice. But
  believe me, he's a bad one through and through. You've done a service to all
  decent people. You'll soon see that yourself."</p>

  <p>Pen sighed with relief, that he had so ready an explanation of her
  agitation. "There's something else I must tell you," she went on. "As I was
  bringing Counsell along the beach a man interfered between us. I think it was
  one of the detectives. I suppose he wanted to share in the reward. Anyhow the
  two men fought on the beach. I let them fight it out. I helped Counsell
  because he was my prisoner. And he got the best of the other man and tied him
  up. I suppose he's lying there yet. Half way between the wharf and the
  lighthouse. As soon as it was over I forced Counsell to come along with me
  just the same as before."</p>

  <p>Riever laughed loudly. "What a woman you are!" he cried. "You've earned
  that reward ten times over! Don't you worry. Nobody else shall touch a cent
  of it!"</p>

  <p>That clear-eyed little familiar inside Pen whispered to her: "This is all
  very well, but as soon as he has time to think it over, he'll begin to see
  the holes in your story. You must get the money out of him to-night if you
  can."</p>

  <p>But how could she bring herself to speak of it?</p>

  <p>They lingered at the door of the big house. The body-guard was waiting off
  in the drive with his back discreetly turned. Riever took enormous
  encouragement from the fact that Pen did not try to hurry away from him.</p>

  <p>"What are your plans?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"We'll weigh anchor early to-morrow," Riever said, "and steam to Annapolis
  where I will obtain the necessary extradition papers. Then I'll have Counsell
  sent North by train. Before nightfall to-morrow he'll be lodged safe in the
  Tombs."</p>

  <p>"The Tombs?"</p>

  <p>"The New York City prison."</p>

  <p>Pen blushed crimson in the dark but doggedly forced herself to bring out
  the words: "But...how about...what you promised me..."</p>

  <p>Riever laughed. It had an unpleasant ring, though he probably meant it
  good-naturedly enough. "What a funny girl you are! Anxious about your thirty
  pieces of silver, eh? Don't worry! I'll see you in the morning before I
  go."</p>

  <p>Pen was obliged to let it go at that, though it was with a sickening
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>Riever's voice thickened again. "You've quieted down now," he murmured.
  "You're not going to let me go like this..."</p>

  <p>Pen's hands went up again, but he caught her roughly to him. He could not
  reach her face. He pressed a burning kiss on her neck. Pen tore herself away,
  and ran shudderingly to her room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="XII"
     id="XII"></a>XII. &mdash; THE <i>ALEXANDRA</i> SAILS AWAY</h2>

  <p class="first">NEXT morning Pen was late, for her, in getting down-stairs,
  and her father was before her. He had already been out-of-doors and had heard
  the startling news. He was pale with excitement, and his expression presented
  a comical mixture of elation and outraged parental authority.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" he cried. "Counsell is caught? And caught by you!"</p>

  <p>"That pleases you, doesn't it?" said Pen, in a quiet way very aggravating
  to an excited man.</p>

  <p>"Pleases me?" he cried. "My daughter starting out at night on such an
  errand! Wandering around the woods with a gun! Pleases me!" He ended on a
  more human note. "You might have told me when you came in, instead of letting
  me learn it from strangers!"</p>

  <p>"I was all in," said Pen simply. "I couldn't face the added excitement
  even of telling you."</p>

  <p>"Um! Humph! Ha!" he snorted. "What will become of your reputation?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Riever didn't seem to think it had suffered," Pen murmured slyly.</p>

  <p>"Ha!...Well, of course he wouldn't <i>say</i> so!...I sha'n't be able to
  sleep quietly for thinking what <i>might</i> have happened!"</p>

  <p>Pen saw that the indignant parent only wanted to put himself on record,
  and that underneath the man was delighted. She went ahead and gave him his
  breakfast. He ate it in a charming humor.</p>

  <p>Afterwards she went about her household chores waiting for Riever, sick
  with anxiety. Suppose he didn't come? Suppose even then, the yacht was
  getting ready to sail? She couldn't go out to see. She simply could not
  humiliate her pride to the extent of going down to the wharf to look for her
  money.</p>

  <p>After all Riever did come, and early, too. It still lacked a few minutes
  of nine. But he met Pendleton outside, who brought him in, and the two men
  were closeted in the front drawing-room for awhile. Pen felt by instinct that
  this interview boded her no good. Afterwards her father came to her in the
  kitchen saying:</p>

  <p>"Mr Riever wants to say good-by to you."</p>

  <p>He avoided Pen's eye as he said it, and there were complacent little lines
  about the corners of his mouth. "Riever has given him more money!" Pen
  thought with sinking heart.</p>

  <p>Pendleton did not accompany her back to the drawing-room. Riever was
  waiting for her, carefully dressed in his admirable, square-cut yachting
  suit. He was brisk, and inclined to be effusive, signs in Pen's eyes that he
  was secretly uneasy. But perhaps that was natural. His eyes were as devoid of
  expression as an animal's; she could not guess of what he was thinking; his
  words came merely from his lips.</p>

  <p>"How are you?" he asked solicitously. "Ah, pale, I see! Not much sleep
  perhaps? Well thank God! this nasty business is about over."</p>

  <p>Pen did not feel that this required any answer. She waited.</p>

  <p>"I said I'd come to see you before I set sail this morning," Riever went
  on briskly&mdash;and then came to a somewhat lame pause.</p>

  <p>Pen waited in an anxiety that was like a physical pain for him to produce
  a check-book or a bundle of notes. But he made no such move. There was an
  awkward silence. Finally he said as if at random:</p>

  <p>"By the way do you know what became of Keesing's revolver? He's making a
  fuss about it."</p>

  <p>"I haven't it," said Pen coolly.</p>

  <p>"He said you took it from him," Riever said with a light laugh&mdash;but
  his eyes were tormented.</p>

  <p>"He is mistaken," said Pen. "When he fell it flew out of his hand. I don't
  know what became of it."</p>

  <p>"He said you carried it away in your hand."</p>

  <p>"That was the pistol you gave me in the morning...You saw it," she added,
  feeling pretty sure that Riever had been in no condition to distinguish one
  pistol from another.</p>

  <p>"Why of course!" he said. "It's absurd." But there was no real conviction
  in his tones.</p>

  <p>"If you'll wait a moment I'll get it for you," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"Please don't bother," he said. "Keep it as a souvenir."</p>

  <p>There was another silence. Pen saw that he dared not accuse her openly.
  The matter had to be threshed out to a conclusion, so she grasped her nettle
  firmly.</p>

  <p>"What else did Mr. Keesing tell you?" she asked scornfully.</p>

  <p>Riever's attempt to carry it off lightly was painful to see. "Oh, I don't
  take any stock in it," he said with his laugh.</p>

  <p>"But I ought to know, shouldn't I?"</p>

  <p>Riever laughed excessively. "Said you had no intention of giving him up
  until he surprised you together. Said you were just walking up and down the
  beach talking." His eyes were darting ugly, pained glances at her.</p>

  <p>Pen laughed too. "In the full moonlight!" she exclaimed. She was secretly
  relieved. If Keesing had overheard their talk he would of course have
  repeated it.</p>

  <p>"I told you there was nothing in it," said Riever.</p>

  <p>"If I was...friendly with him, do you think I'm the sort of person to give
  him up?" demanded Pen.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not...But Keesing said after he had recognized Counsell, there
  was nothing else for you to do."</p>

  <p>"If I'd wanted to save the other man I could have shot Keesing," said Pen
  boldly.</p>

  <p>Riever stared. "Well...I believe you are capable of it," he muttered. That
  at least was honest.</p>

  <p>Pen followed up her advantage quickly. "Obviously a crude attempt to get
  the reward for himself," she said.</p>

  <p>"That's what I thought...But Keesing clearly understood that there was
  nothing in it for him, anyway. He didn't bring the man in."</p>

  <p>"Then it was just spite," said Pen.</p>

  <p>"No doubt," said Riever.</p>

  <p>Pen's heart sank. She was making no progress whatever. He would agree with
  everything she said, and act according to his own secret motives. She was
  determined to drag these out into the light.</p>

  <p>"Well, what are you going to do about it?" she asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Why, nothing!" he said with an air of surprise.</p>

  <p>"I mean about the money," said Pen firmly.</p>

  <p>He averted his head. "What do you want so much money for?" he
  muttered.</p>

  <p>"What does anybody want money for?" said Pen. "Thousands of things!"</p>

  <p>He came towards her eagerly. "Tell me what they are," he stuttered.
  "Anything...anything money will buy! You have only to name it!"</p>

  <p>"I can't take gifts from you," said Pen coldly. "I've earned this money,
  haven't I? You promised it."</p>

  <p>"I don't go back on my promises," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Well then?"</p>

  <p>"But just at the moment I haven't it by me."</p>

  <p>Pen thought: "It's all over!" And tasted despair.</p>

  <p>He went on more glibly: "One's money gets all tied up you know. And I've
  been under heavy expenses. Of course I can arrange it when I get back to
  town. I'll bring it to you myself. Just as soon as I can get this ugly
  business off my hands. It won't take long. Popular opinion demands that the
  man be tried speedily. And I can set certain influences at work. I fancy the
  trial will be brief. In six weeks you can expect to see me back again...And
  under much happier circumstances I trust. I'm afraid at present you have
  certain doubts of me. Almost a dislike. This has been such a beastly
  business! When I come back my whole aim will be to remove your doubts. To
  show you what I really am. And what you mean to me. Thank God! time is on my
  side!"</p>

  <p>Pen kept her eyes down to hide the thought she was sure must be speaking
  through them: "If you came back here under such circumstances I should kill
  you!"</p>

  <p>Her stillness frightened him. He began to hedge. "But what am I saying?
  You don't have to wait for your money till I come back. It is a matter I can
  arrange with my bankers. You may expect a check within a week."</p>

  <p>Pen was not deceived of course. She foresaw the silky, apologetic letter
  she would receive at the end of a week&mdash;without any check. She was
  silent.</p>

  <p>Riever's instinct warned him against making any loverly demonstration at
  such a moment. "Good-by," he said.</p>

  <p>Pen's generous, open nature imperiously demanded that she avow her true
  feelings, and crush him like the worm he was. It cost her a frightful, silent
  struggle to keep it in. She kept saying to herself mechanically: "We haven't
  convicted him yet. I must go on deceiving him!"</p>

  <p>Without raising her eyes, she offered him her hand. He carried it lightly
  to his lips, and quickly left the room.</p>

  <p>But how he got out, or what she herself did during the next half hour, Pen
  could never have told clearly. When she came back to the realization of
  things it was to find herself kneeling at one of the windows in her room
  listening to the clank of the yacht's anchor chain. The sound seemed to be
  striking on her bare heart.</p>

  <p>She saw the mud-hook slowly rise out of the water, and the yacht's screws
  set up a churning astern. The graceful vessel began to move. She came about
  in a wide circle and swept out of Pen's range of vision behind the trees. As
  she passed the lighthouse she saluted with three blasts of her melodious
  whistle, and the lighthouse bell tolled in answer.</p>

  <p>Somewhere in the bowels of that vessel, in darkness perhaps, and manacled,
  sat the bright-haired Don, grinning derisively at misfortune. He was
  depending on her; keeping himself up no doubt with the assurance that she had
  secured the money to save him...Pen's head dropped on her arms.</p>

  <p>Upon the departure of the yacht, the crowd at Broome's Point quickly broke
  up. Slow-moving oxcarts started up the Neck road, and noisy motor-boats put
  off up the river and across the Bay. Before it was midday the old unbroken
  peace had descended on the remote estate, and all that had happened in
  between seemed like a dream. As of old, the fish-hawks plunged for their
  wriggling prey, buzzards circled high in the blue, hens clucked contentedly
  at the kitchen door, and the turkeys set up a sudden gobbling in the
  fields.</p>

  <p>Pen could not long give herself up to despair. She must act if she wished
  to save her sanity. With a tormented face she went about the house in a whirl
  of activity. Black Aunt Maria's eyes rolled askance at her mistress.
  Pendleton remained down on the beach seeing the boats off. Pen suspected he
  was purposely keeping out of her way.</p>

  <p>When he came in to dinner he was affecting an air of busy abstraction.
  When Pen addressed him he would reply, gently:</p>

  <p>"Don't interrupt me, my dear. I have an idea just taking shape in my
  mind."</p>

  <p>This was an old dodge of his, when he wished to escape something
  unpleasant. Pen smiled to herself without mirth, and quietly bided her
  time.</p>

  <p>When he was finished eating he attempted to slide out of the room, but Pen
  was on the watch for that.</p>

  <p>"One moment, father."</p>

  <p>"Another time, my dear. I must get this down on paper before it escapes
  me."</p>

  <p>Pen put herself determinedly between him and the door. "Sorry," she said.
  "But I have some rights as well as your ideas."</p>

  <p>"Only an ignorant person sneers at ideas," he said loftily.</p>

  <p>Pen refused to be drawn aside. She began mildly: "Now that this business
  is over, I hope there's no objection to my going away for a little
  while."</p>

  <p>His eyes narrowed and hardened as a weak and stubborn man's must. "Why
  should you go away now?" he demanded. "The trouble is over. This is the best
  place to rest."</p>

  <p>"Just the same I must go," said Pen. "Will you give me the money?"</p>

  <p>"I'll take you for a visit to Cousin Laura Lee at Frederick," he said.
  "The trip will do us both good."</p>

  <p>"I must have more of a change than that," said Pen patiently. "I need six
  hundred dollars."</p>

  <p>"Preposterous!" he cried. "You know I have no such sum to fritter
  away!"</p>

  <p>"I have worked for you six years," said Pen wistfully. "A hundred dollars
  a year does not seem much!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you're going to measure your duty towards me in dollars and
  cents!"</p>

  <p>"But I'm not! I..."</p>

  <p>"That's enough. I am your father. I am the best judge of what is right for
  you."</p>

  <p>Pen was too sore at heart to be very patient. "You got more money from Mr.
  Riever this morning," she said at a venture.</p>

  <p>There was a significant exchange of glances, startled on his part, quietly
  assured on hers. He saw that it was useless to deny it.</p>

  <p>"Well if I did," he said with dignity, "you may be sure it wasn't a gift.
  I gave a fair return for it...Anyway, that's my capital. I can't spend
  it."</p>

  <p>"Did you undertake to keep me here for him?" Pen asked quietly.</p>

  <p>By the way he puffed out his cheeks and wagged his head she saw that she
  had guessed somewhere near the truth. She was unspeakably saddened. Her
  father! What was the use?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile he was noisy in his aggrieved protestations. "How can you say
  such a thing! Am I not your father? You must know that every act of mine is
  solely directed by a concern for your good. My life is devoted to that
  end."</p>

  <p>Pen struggled on, though she was convinced of the hopelessness of it. "I
  grant that," she said. "Willingly! But you might be mistaken..."</p>

  <p>"Never!" he cried, without any notion of his absurdity.</p>

  <p>"Well, we mustn't quarrel," said Pen. "I appeal to your affection for me.
  I seldom ask you for anything, I am not one of the flighty kind. You must see
  that I am in deadly earnest. I must go away! If I were kept here I should go
  out of my mind!"</p>

  <p>But cupidity had for the moment overcome his natural affections&mdash;as
  it has a way of doing. "Pooh! you're talking like a flighty girl now,'" he
  said loftily. "Permit me to be the judge of what is best for you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right," said Pen with a sudden change of tone. "Let's say no more
  about it."</p>

  <p>Pendleton was a little astonished by his victory, for his case was bad.
  "Well, that's my own girl!" he said, approaching her full of fine, fatherly
  approval.</p>

  <p>Pen cast an odd, cold glance at him and passed out into the pantry.
  Pendleton went up-stairs feeling acutely uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>During the afternoon they pursued the usual routine. Pen's first act was
  to let Doug out of the barn. The good dog was wild with delight. Pendleton
  went for the mail.</p>

  <p>When he came into the house for supper, his eyes sought Pen's face with a
  furtive anxiety. All was serene there, and his spirits rose mightily. In all
  these years Pendleton had learned little about his daughter's nature. He
  persisted in believing what he wished to believe. During the meal he was
  affable and discursive. Pen listened with a sufficient smile, and was as
  attentive as ever to his wants.</p>

  <p>They spent their usual quiet evening under the dining-room lamp, Pen with
  her mending, Pendleton with his newspaper. An instinct of caution warned him
  not to read aloud any of the comment on the Counsell case. The news of the
  grand denouement had not reached Baltimore in time for that morning's paper.
  They retired early. Pen offering her cheek for the usual good-night kiss.</p>

  <p>As soon as the sounds of Pendleton's snores began to issue through the
  transom over his door, Pen came out of her room again. She was dressed in hat
  and suit, and carried a small valise. She also had a note addressed to Aunt
  Maria, giving certain directions for breakfast. As Aunt Maria could not read,
  Pen knew that it would be brought to Pendleton's attention early.</p>

  <p>She slipped out of the house by the back door. Doug in his kennel whined
  with pleasure. She unfastened him with an admonition to silence. Doug was too
  experienced a dog to waste much energy in unnecessary noise. Pen walked
  swiftly back through the paddock, and through the stable yard gate to the
  road. Doug ran ahead with his tail high. It was a fair night with a pale sky,
  and dim stars.</p>

  <p>She was too early. She loafed along the road. At the gate to the distant
  field where the sheep were pastured, she leaned her elbows on the bars
  waiting for the moon, while Doug pursued his canine investigations far and
  near. He had all the lost time of his imprisonment to make up. Finally when
  the silver rim appeared, Pen let down the bars and whistled for him.</p>

  <p>"Fetch them out, sir!" she said. Doug knew his business thoroughly.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later the huddled little flock was striking into the woods,
  with Pen at its heels and Doug, all intent now upon his charges. Pen paused
  to let them drink their fill in the little stream that flowed across the
  road. They plodded on through clogging sand and around mudholes that never
  dried up from one year's end to another. There was no regular beat to the
  thudding little hoofs, for those in the van were always hanging back, and
  those in the rear running to catch up. They passed along in little gusts of
  sound, like nervous fingers drumming on a window pane. Pen was choked with
  dust. "What will I look like in the morning?" she thought.</p>

  <p>Little owls mourned far off, this way and that, and occasionally the bark
  of a fox brought Doug to a stand with raised ruff and murmured growl. Through
  openings in the branches, stray shafts of moonlight fell on the backs of the
  sheep making them look like little gray ghosts creeping along with bowed
  shoulders. There was a place miles deep in the woods where they passed a
  squatter's shack close beside the road. The nervous patter of hoofs brought a
  figure to the open door. In a curiously tense pose he watched them pass;
  transfixed; without a sound.</p>

  <p>It was ten miles through the woods to the fork in the road where you took
  the right-hand-turn down to the wharf at Hungerford's Run, three miles
  further. Endless it seemed to Pen, the way the road twisted aimlessly first
  off in one direction, then back in the other. It was level for the most part
  except for once or twice when it precipitated them into a gully with a branch
  over which Pen had to jump. In spite of scurrying hoofs their net progress
  was slow. Dawn had broken before they came out on the open road. Pen dreading
  curious eyes urged them on as fast as she could.</p>

  <p>She had one encounter. A farmer early at the plow, turned his team at the
  end of his furrow, just as Pen with her convoy passed in the road below. His
  jaw dropped; he all but rubbed his eyes at the strange spectacle of a
  modishly-dressed (to him) young lady covered with dust, driving a flock of
  sheep miles from anywhere. Pen did not know him, but he, by a process of
  elimination guessed who she must be. His face expressed a sort of agony of
  curiosity until the obvious explanation occurred to him, when it cleared.</p>

  <p>"Driving your sheep to the steamboat?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Pen, blushing, and looking straight ahead.</p>

  <p>He clambered over the fence, and slid down the bank to her side. "I just
  put up my clover last week," he said in friendly fashion. "Next field on the
  left. Drive 'em in and let 'em crop awhile. You got plenty time."</p>

  <p>Pen thanked him. He walked beside her, glancing at her from the corners of
  his eyes. He opened a gate for her, and the grateful sheep scattered inside
  to their breakfast.</p>

  <p>"You come far?" he ventured.</p>

  <p>Pen nodded.</p>

  <p>"Come through the woods at night alone!"</p>

  <p>"I had my dog."</p>

  <p>"Well it's more than I would have done. Why didn't you ride a hoss?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going up on the boat," said Pen. "Had no way of getting the horse
  back. The dog can find his own way of course."</p>

  <p>"Well, you're a good plucky young lady, I'll say...You'll find a good
  spring down at the foot of the slope, yonder. How about some breakfast, I'll
  be going home to mine, directly."</p>

  <p>"I brought it with me, thank you," said Pen, indicating the valise.</p>

  <p>With many a backward look he returned to his horses, and Pen was free to
  wash at the spring, and brush her clothes.</p>

  <p>Arriving at the dilapidated wharf a mile or so farther, she had to run a
  gauntlet of curious stares. Everybody wished to help her, and the sheep were
  quickly penned and tagged. Pen could see in the men's eyes what a storm of
  gossip would break loose once her back was turned, but she cared little about
  that.</p>

  <p>The steamboat on her up trip was due at eight o'clock. Pen's chief anxiety
  was lest it should be delayed long enough to allow her father to reach
  Hungerford's Run on horseback. Pendleton had no right to stop her of course,
  and nothing he might say could shake her determination; but she shuddered at
  the idea of washing the family linen there on the beach before strangers.</p>

  <p>However the <i>Princess Anne</i> arrived before her father, and the sheep
  were driven aboard. Pen put her arms around the good dog's neck, careless of
  who might witness her emotion.</p>

  <p>"I can't take you! I can't take you!" she murmured. "Do not blame me for
  it!"</p>

  <p>They had to lock Doug in the little warehouse before she could go aboard.
  Pen listened to him flinging himself against the door, and heard his sharp,
  anguished barks, feeling like a traitress.</p>

  <p>The steamboat proceeded on her leisurely course from wharf to wharf up the
  bay.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="XIII"
     id="XIII"></a>XIII. &mdash; IN CHAMBERS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Criminal Court Building in New York City is a huge
  square block of yellow brick with an incongruous cornice and grandiose
  trimmings. It is of the Tammany period. Among architectural aberrations,
  architects give it a leading place. It was run up on the site of an old pond,
  and was no sooner up than it threatened to fall down again. There was a great
  scare at the time, but that has long ago been forgotten. The monument still
  stands, secure in its ugliness.</p>

  <p>It is one of the busiest places in the city. It knows no long vacations
  during the heated term. Day in and day out the mills of justice grind
  feverishly without ever quite catching up with the grist that is offered.
  Judges from quieter jurisdictions up state have continually to be imported to
  relieve the overworked metropolitan incumbents.</p>

  <p>Within the building there is a vast enclosed court surrounded by wide,
  cement-paved galleries tier above tier. Every day during court hours these
  galleries are thronged with what is surely the most diverse collections of
  humanity ever brought together under a roof; witnesses principally, or
  friends of the accused. Every walk of life is represented; every stratum of
  society. But among the countless types four are repeated over and over;
  wary-eyed initiates of the underworld, weeping women, shabby insinuating
  lawyers looking for business, and detectives with eyes as wary as the gunmen,
  but better fed men and full of a conscious rectitude. Dozens of little dramas
  are going on simultaneously.</p>

  <p>On a certain stifling morning in mid-summer, amongst the dozens of
  court-rooms the interest of the building was focused in General Sessions,
  Part One, where the case of the People versus Counsell was being tried under
  Stockman, J. A murder trial. Common as they are in that building a murder
  trial never quite loses its zest, and this, owing to the prominence of the
  persons concerned, was a celebrated case. Every morning a great crowd
  struggled to get into the courtroom, though the evidence was not of a
  sensational nature. There was no woman in the case. It was a foregone
  conclusion too; one of those cases which had been tried out in the newspapers
  before being brought into court, and a verdict of guilty rendered. Nobody had
  a good word for the defendant except the morbid women who stormed the
  court-room doors, and who secured a majority of the seats inside, simply
  because they were more persistent than the men. These women always sympathize
  with the prisoner, particularly if, as in this case, he happens to be young
  and comely.</p>

  <p>As a result of the furore in the newspapers many days had been taken up in
  the effort to secure an impartial jury. But once the taking of evidence began
  the proceedings moved swiftly enough. Only two days had been required by the
  prosecutor to present his case. Hackett, the particular star of the
  district-attorney's office, handled it. He had scarcely been obliged to exert
  himself; everything was going his way. In three days more the defendant's
  direct testimony was all in. Counsell was his own principal witness. He had
  told a straightforward story on the stand, and a ruthless cross-examination
  had failed to shake it. Unfortunately for him he had no witnesses to support
  his story. Proof of it rested with the dead man. There had been no witnesses
  to the final scene between them. The trial had now reached the stage of
  rebuttal testimony offered by the People.</p>

  <p>When Court adjourned for the noon recess, Corveth of Defendant's counsel
  made his way out of the building with a heavy air of dejection. He was a
  young man, the same age as the prisoner, an old friend it was said, and he
  had full charge of Counsell's case. He had put up a strenuous fight for his
  friend, but not perhaps a brilliant one. He was a first-rate lawyer, but he
  lacked the art of certain famous pleaders who, when they have a bad case, set
  out to charm and dazzle judge and jury with moving if irrelevant eloquence.
  Corveth was in deadly earnest. He passionately believed in his client's
  innocence, but he had scarcely succeeded in proving it. And he had often
  irritated the Bench by his dogged fight on points of law which took up time
  without apparently getting anywhere. Even now it was a mistake of tactics for
  Corveth so clearly to betray his discouragement to the inquisitive observers
  in the galleries.</p>

  <p>Two hours later when he returned, the man's whole bearing had changed.
  Dejection had given place to an air of excitement so great that it was
  impossible to tell whether it was a pleasurable excitement or the reverse.
  His pale skin seemed to gleam with excitement; his clothing was a little
  disarranged; the man looked slightly stunned.</p>

  <p>He was escorting a heavily veiled woman, a young woman judging from her
  figure and carriage, and they were followed by such an oddly-assorted group
  as you could only find walking together in that building. Witnesses
  obviously. It included two other women, one a flashy, pretty little thing,
  with hard, assured eyes, the other a domestic servant apparently. The men
  ranged all the way from a highly prosperous gentleman, a banker possibly,
  down to a couple of taxi-drivers and a farm laborer. The word went around the
  galleries like wildfire that there was something up in the Counsell case, and
  a new crowd pressed to the doors of the courtroom. It was too late to get in.
  Corveth left his witnesses outside where they remained guarded by a couple of
  young men from his office against the questions of the curious.</p>

  <p>Within the court-room Corveth was seen to enter into an excited, whispered
  discussion with the defendant. Corveth was the excited one. Counsell appeared
  to be trying to soothe him. Their talk was interrupted by the entrance of the
  Judge.</p>

  <p>When the proceedings were opened Corveth rose and in a voice that trembled
  oddly said: "If it please your Honor since we adjourned important new
  evidence has been offered to me."</p>

  <p>The judge stared and bit his lip in irritation. There were so many cases
  on his calendar! Were they all to be dragged out past all reason by the
  lawyers! This of course was merely the grand stand play of a lawyer with a
  bad case. To do him justice, his Honor controlled his irritation before he
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Corveth, I trust you have taken thought of what you are saying. You
  have had every opportunity to present your case."</p>

  <p>"Twelve new witnesses have just been brought to me, sir, whose existence I
  never suspected."</p>

  <p>"Twelve! How could that be? You have been studying this case for weeks. In
  what manner were new witnesses brought to you at this late date?"</p>

  <p>"They were brought to me by a person interested in this case, who has been
  conducting an investigation unknown to me."</p>

  <p>"And you say their evidence is important?"</p>

  <p>"Of the utmost importance, sir. It throws an entirely new light on the
  case."</p>

  <p>In his irritation the overworked judge was understood to mutter: "I doubt
  it!"</p>

  <p>Corveth flushed crimson, but held his tongue.</p>

  <p>Observing the flush, his Honor went on more mildly, but still with
  bitterness: "Understand, Mr. Corveth, it is not your word that I doubt, but
  only your estimate of the importance of this evidence. A long experience on
  the bench has taught me that matters which appear of overwhelming importance
  to opposing counsel, have a way of shrinking sadly when they are brought out
  on the stand."</p>

  <p>A titter went around the court-room. The gavel rapped viciously.</p>

  <p>"Should this evidence not be admitted sir, it may put the State to the
  expense of a new trial."</p>

  <p>The Assistant District Attorney was on his feet. "I object. Surely it is
  grossly improper for Counsel to make such statements in the hearing of the
  jury."</p>

  <p>"It is only his opinion," said the judge wearily. "It will not appear in
  the record." To Corveth he said: "Well, what do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"To give me time to hear these persons' stories, sir. An adjournment until
  to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>The judge said nothing, but his face was set hard against it.</p>

  <p>"Or if Mr. Hackett is willing to go on with his evidence in rebuttal, I
  only ask for leave to re-open my case to-morrow. I can sit up all night."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hackett smiled rather pityingly. "With all respect to Counsel," he
  said, "I don't see that anything is to be gained by going on if Mr. Corveth
  is going to introduce an entirely new element."</p>

  <p>"I agree with you," said the judge. He appeared to have made up his mind.
  "Mr. Corveth," he went on, "you realize of course that if I give you this
  time the District-Attorney is entitled to a similar indulgence. Where would
  we end? These gentlemen on the jury have already been detained from their
  homes and their businesses for many days. I owe them the greatest
  consideration. I must have some further assurance of the importance of your
  evidence before I can consent to any delay. You say this story has just been
  told you by somebody. Is he present?"</p>

  <p>"It is a woman, your Honor. She is present."</p>

  <p>The court-room pricked up its ears.</p>

  <p>"Then why not put her on the stand?"</p>

  <p>"It would be useless, your Honor. She could give little or no direct
  testimony as to what occurred. She has <i>collected</i> the testimony and
  brought me the witnesses."</p>

  <p>"They are here, too? Then put your principal witness on the stand. I will
  give you as much latitude as I can in questioning him. And if anything
  important transpires I will grant the adjournment you ask for."</p>

  <p>"I thank your Honor. Unfortunately, as I understand it, none of these
  witnesses can tell a complete story of what happened. Each one can only add a
  link or two to the chain. You could scarcely judge from the testimony of any
  one of them how important their evidence would be taken collectively."</p>

  <p>His Honor sighed for patience, and bit his lip.</p>

  <p>"But if I might offer a suggestion, sir...?"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Could you not request the jury to retire and hear this lady's story in
  your chambers? You could then decide in a few minutes whether or not it
  warranted an adjournment."</p>

  <p>His Honor tapped his desk reflectively with a pencil.</p>

  <p>The Assistant-District-Attorney was protesting. "Your Honor whatever may
  come of this matter, an impression is being created here highly prejudicial
  to the case of the people..."</p>

  <p>Corveth interrupted him: "I should be quite willing to have Mr. Hackett
  present while this lady is telling her story, so that he may have the fullest
  opportunity to meet the evidence she has to offer."</p>

  <p>This more than anything Corveth had said, inclined the judge to believe
  that he really had something up his sleeve. Moreover it was a generous offer.
  The judicial face thawed a little on defendant's counsel. It then turned to
  the jury.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen of the jury I will ask you to retire for a few minutes to give
  me the opportunity of deciding whether this evidence is material to the
  case."</p>

  <p>The jury filed out in one direction, and his honor went the other, his
  silken robe billowing behind him. The court-room buzzed with an excited
  whispering: "What do you suppose is up?"</p>

  <p>Corveth brought the veiled woman to the Judge's room through another door.
  "Chambers" was simply a smallish room with a ceiling so lofty that it gave
  the effect of a room stood up on the wrong end. A wide flat-topped desk
  filled a great part of the floor space. His Honor, brought down from the
  eminence of his dais was revealed as a smallish man with a wise, humane face,
  much harassed as the result of over-work. In the little room he looked much
  more human.</p>

  <p>He waved the lady to a chair at his right hand. Hackett, with a cynical
  expression, lounged in a chair by the window. Corveth was too nervous to sit.
  As the lady seated herself she threw back her veil.</p>

  <p>"Miss Broome!" exclaimed the judge in surprise. "You have already
  testified in this case!" He looked reproachfully at Corveth. Corveth signed
  to him to wait.</p>

  <p>"Did you not tell all you know?" Judge Stockman demanded.</p>

  <p>Pen slowly shook her head.</p>

  <p>"How do you reconcile that with your conscience?"</p>

  <p>"I answered all the questions," she said softly. "Mr. Corveth could not
  ask me about these other matters, because he knew nothing of them."</p>

  <p>"But you are acting in the defendant's interest, I assume. Surely his
  Counsel had a right to know what was going on."</p>

  <p>"It was not from any lack of confidence in him," Pen said, with a warm
  glance at Corveth. "It would have been fatal to us if the least whisper of
  what we were doing had got about before we had complete proof. We tried our
  best to obtain a postponement of the trial. When that was denied it was very
  difficult to know what to do. Mr. Counsell decided, and I agreed with him,
  that we must go ahead and keep everything hidden. We did not tell Mr. Corveth
  because he is too honest to play a part. If he had known what we knew, our
  enemies would have read it in his face in the court-room. If we have acted
  wrongly I hope you will remember that we had a powerful and unscrupulous
  enemy."</p>

  <p>His Honor did not appear much impressed, though it was not hidden that he
  approved of Pen's exterior. "And do you think you have complete proof now?"
  he asked with an indulgent smile.</p>

  <p>"I obtained it only yesterday, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, tell me what you expect to prove."</p>

  <p>Pen looked rather helpless. "Mr. Corveth said I must be brief...There is
  so much to tell...I scarcely know where to begin..."</p>

  <p>Corveth prompted her. "Tell Judge Stockman what witnesses you have brought
  me and what you expect to prove by each one."</p>

  <p>Pen nodded. "The first witness will be a young woman named Blanche Paglar.
  She will testify that up to the day that Collis Dongan was shot she was
  friends with...I mean lived with..." She hesitated, blushing.</p>

  <p>Corveth helped her out with the legal euphemism.</p>

  <p>"Yes, she was the common-law-wife of a young man known as Spike Talley.
  She will testify that Talley told her at this time that he had undertaken a
  job for a rich man, whose name he never told her, and that he was to get ten
  thousand dollars for it."</p>

  <p>"What!" exclaimed Judge Stockman. "What sort of job?"</p>

  <p>"Talley was what is called a gangster or a gunman," said Pen. "When they
  say 'a job' they mean a killing, a murder."</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens!" exclaimed the Judge. "Do you mean to say you have had to
  associate with such people?"</p>

  <p>"They were kind to me," said Pen simply.</p>

  <p>"Go on."</p>

  <p>"She will testify that Spike Talley's duties in connection with his 'job'
  necessitated his putting on dress clothes every evening and going to a
  certain fashionable hotel to dine. He never told her the name of the hotel,
  but on one occasion he brought her a menu-card with the name torn off. That
  card will be identified as one from the Hotel Warrington."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed his Honor as the connection began to show.</p>

  <p>"Talley also told her that his 'boss' gave him a drink of whiskey every
  time he went to his house. He described to her how it stood on the sideboard
  in a handsome, square, cut-glass bottle, and how he was always invited to
  help himself."</p>

  <p>"The importance of this will appear later," murmured Corveth.</p>

  <p>Pen went on: "Blanche will testify that Spike Talley left her for the last
  time on the afternoon of May 27th, the day of the murder. Some days later she
  reported his disappearance to the police. They could find no trace of him, if
  indeed they ever looked. Blanche never connected his disappearance with the
  death of Collis Dongan, because the newspapers made out from the beginning
  that it was certain Mr. Counsell had committed that crime."</p>

  <p>His Honor was now thoroughly interested in Pen's story. Even
  Assistant-District-Attorney Hackett had lost a good deal of his scornful air.
  The judge said:</p>

  <p>"But if this Talley has disappeared can you prove anything?"</p>

  <p>"You'll see, sir...The next witness is a taxi-driver who was a friend of
  Spike Talley's. He will testify that at this time Talley came to his garage
  every evening and engaged the witness to drive him up to the Hotel
  Warrington. I could prove by waiters in the hotel that Talley dined there
  every evening&mdash;they have identified his photograph, but Mr. Corveth says
  it will hardly be necessary, because the next witness, Mr. Slaughter, would
  carry more weight.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Slaughter is a gentleman of means and position who resides at the
  Warrington. He will tell how he became acquainted with Talley through seeing
  him dine at the next table. Talley was a young man of much charm of manner.
  Mr. Slaughter never suspected what he was. The two became quite friendly, and
  on a number of occasions after dinner, Mr. Slaughter invited Talley up to his
  apartment which was on the same floor as Mr. Dongan's and Mr. Counsell's. Mr.
  Slaughter will further testify how on one occasion he discovered
  Talley...what would you say...flirting with the hotel maid on that floor, and
  remonstrated with him. Talley passed it off with a laugh. Talley visited him
  for the last time on the night of the murder.</p>

  <p>"The next witness will be the maid, Mary Crehan. She will tell how Talley
  'made up to her' as she says, and how on one occasion he took her to a moving
  picture theater. It appears from what she recollects of their conversation
  that Talley was pumping her for information as to the lay-out of Mr. Dongan's
  apartment, and Mr. Counsell's, and information as to the habits of the two
  men. But he did this so adroitly that the girl never thought of connecting
  him later with the shooting. She will testify how one evening after having
  talked with Talley in the corridor, she missed her keys. It never entered her
  head that the fashionably-dressed young gentleman had anything to do with it.
  She found them the next night in the cupboard on that floor where she was
  accustomed to leave them upon going off duty. The bunch consisted of half a
  dozen master keys which would admit her to any apartment on that floor.</p>

  <p>"The next witness is a locksmith, an acquaintance of Talley's, who will
  identify the maid's keys as the same bunch brought to him by Talley to be
  duplicated. He did duplicate them, and handed both sets to Talley. This was
  about ten days before the murder.</p>

  <p>"The next witness is another taxi-driver who had no acquaintance with
  Talley, but is prepared to identify his photograph as that of a man who
  engaged him outside the Hotel Warrington about midnight on May 27th."</p>

  <p>"Midnight?" interrupted Judge Stockman. "That was <i>after</i> the murder.
  Can't you connect this Talley directly with the deed?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. He was too clever...Besides that was not my principal object. I
  was looking for proof against his employer."</p>

  <p>"Oh, do you know him too?"</p>

  <p>Pen nodded.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"This taxi-cab driver could not at first remember the address to which he
  had driven Talley, but he gave us the locality, and when we drove with him
  through the streets of that neighborhood he unhesitatingly picked out the
  house."</p>

  <p>"How could he do that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it was a peculiar looking house; different from any other in the
  neighborhood, from any other in town probably. It is in Thirty-Ninth street,
  East of Lexington."</p>

  <p>"Go on."</p>

  <p>"He stalled his engine and had to get out of his car to start it. Thus he
  saw Talley admitted to the house, and had a glimpse of the man who admitted
  him. Out of a number of photographs handed him he picked out one which he is
  ready to swear is that of the man who admitted Talley."</p>

  <p>"He could have got but the briefest of glances."</p>

  <p>"But it is of a striking-looking man, your Honor."</p>

  <p>"What next?"</p>

  <p>Pen said slowly: "Talley was never seen alive after that."</p>

  <p>"What!" exclaimed Judge Stockman, "you charge a second murder!...Go
  on."</p>

  <p>"For many days we could get no further," Pen said. "Finally one of
  Talley's friends volunteered to break into that house to look for
  evidence."</p>

  <p>"But this is burglary!"</p>

  <p>"The witness, known as Babe Riordan, is prepared to waive immunity when he
  goes on the stand. If a charge is laid against him he will stand his
  trial."</p>

  <p>"Did he find anything in the house?"</p>

  <p>"He found the square, cut-glass whiskey bottle on the sideboard. It had
  been emptied, but we took it to a chemist, our next witness, who is prepared
  to testify that it contained well defined traces of cyanide."</p>

  <p>His Honor frowned. "Dubious evidence!" he said. "Even suppose a jury were
  inclined to believe the chemist, how would they know but that the last
  witness, a self-confessed burglar, remember, did not put the poison in the
  bottle himself?"</p>

  <p>"There is more evidence," said Pen. "It appears that according to the law
  a druggist may not sell such poisons without a doctor's prescription. A
  search was conducted through the various drug-stores in the neighborhood, and
  several prescriptions for cyanide traced back. One was traced to the man who
  occupies that house on Thirty-Ninth street."</p>

  <p>"The man identified by the second taxi-driver as he who admitted Talley to
  the house?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Ah then, you're getting closer to it. Who is this man?"</p>

  <p>Pen hesitated. "Mr. Corveth told me that his name should not be mentioned
  at this trial."</p>

  <p>His Honor looked a little nonplussed. "...Er...well perhaps not...perhaps
  not! Have you more evidence against him?"</p>

  <p>"We can show that three days before the murder he drew ten thousand
  dollars in cash from the bank."</p>

  <p>"Ah, the price named by the first witness. But what good will that do you
  if it is your contention that he murdered his tool instead of paying
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Because we can show that the day after the murder he re-deposited the
  amount in another bank."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Anything else?"</p>

  <p>"Our next task of course was to try to prove what had become of Talley's
  body. This took us many more days."</p>

  <p>"You engaged detectives to help you?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I hadn't money enough. But all of Spike Talley's friends helped
  me. They proved themselves as good detectives as professionals."</p>

  <p>"But they are only making out their friend to be a murderer!"</p>

  <p>"They seem not to mind that. According to their code he was simply doing
  his job. Instead of getting his pay for it he was murdered. They wish to
  avenge him by helping to convict his murderer. I might say that if it was not
  for me they would probably choose a more direct way of avenging him, but I
  have persuaded them that it would be a much more terrible punishment to bring
  the murderer into court."</p>

  <p>His Honor wagged his head. "You have been keeping strange company, young
  lady!"</p>

  <p>"I had no choice, sir."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know that these gunmen, gangsters, burglars and so on are
  not very credible witnesses."</p>

  <p>"They are not my principal witnesses, sir. I rely chiefly on Mr.
  Slaughter, the different professional men, the servants, the second
  taxi-driver, all of whom are obviously disinterested."</p>

  <p>"Where did you get so much information about what constitutes evidence and
  so on."</p>

  <p>"We had legal advice, sir. Not from Mr. Corveth, but from another lawyer,
  who once defended Spike Talley."</p>

  <p>"Go on."</p>

  <p>"We had the house on Thirty-Ninth street searched from top to bottom
  without discovering any clues as to what became of the body. It was not until
  we went to Mr...to the rich man's country place, that we began to make
  progress. We learned there, that two days after the murder, that was Sunday,
  the owner brought a barrel up from the city in the back of his automobile. He
  informed his servants that it contained a new poison with which he intended
  to spray his fruit trees&mdash;I should explain that he is an extensive
  raiser of fruit, and under his supervision the barrel was put in a little
  shed in one of the orchards where the spraying apparatus, the poisons and so
  on were kept."</p>

  <p>"Can't you establish a connection between the barrel and the house on
  Thirty-Ninth street?"</p>

  <p>"To a certain extent, yes. When we learned of the barrel some of us went
  back to the Thirty-Ninth street neighborhood to investigate. We have a grocer
  who will testify that he sold such an empty barrel to the man in question,
  who was particular to see that he got a perfectly fitting head to the barrel.
  He told the grocer he wanted to ship some china up to his country place. He
  carried the barrel away in his car."</p>

  <p>"Did the grocer know the man who bought the barrel?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. But he can identify the man. And describe the car."</p>

  <p>"Well, assuming that the barrel contained a body when it arrived at the
  country place, what became of it after that?"</p>

  <p>"We have one of the rich man's laborers to testify to that. On the
  following day, Monday, this man was ordered to assist his master in one of
  the orchards. The day is fixed in the man's mind because it was Decoration
  Day and he was disappointed of getting a holiday. I should tell you that the
  rich man personally supervised his orchards and often worked in them himself,
  so that his actions on this day excited no particular remark among his
  servants. He ordered the laborer to gather up all the piles of twigs and
  branches which had been pruned in that particular orchard during the winter,
  and make one great pile to be burned. He pointed out a spot of waste ground
  at a little distance from the trees where the fire was to be made. He then
  went away.</p>

  <p>"He returned to the orchard when the work was done. He then had a small
  can of coal oil. His laborer ventured to remonstrate with him on the danger
  of making so great a fire, but his master curtly replied that he knew what he
  was about. He sent the laborer on an errand to a distant part of the estate,
  saying that he would remain to watch the fire. The laborer after his rebuke,
  with a natural hope perhaps that the fire would get beyond his master,
  concealed himself behind some shrubbery at a little distance and watched.</p>

  <p>"He saw his master go to the spraying house, bring out the barrel (he will
  testify that there was no other barrel of that sort in the house) and roll it
  down the orchard to the great heap of branches. He saw him place it in the
  center of the pile, pour coal oil all around, and set it afire. When the
  flames sprang up, the master began to look about him suspiciously, and the
  laborer fearing discovery, hastened away and saw no more. He told what he had
  seen to his mates, but it does not appear that any of them suspected that a
  crime had occurred. All their master's actions appeared to them so arbitrary
  and eccentric they never tried to explain them. As one of them said, 'You
  never knew what the boss was going to do next!'"</p>

  <p>"Have you anything more?" asked the judge.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I will be the next witness. I will tell how the laborer took me
  to the spot where the fire had been, and how I searched it. Several weeks had
  passed, and the rains had leached out the ashes, but the place had not been
  disturbed by a rake or cultivator."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"In the center where the heat had been greatest there was nothing but
  washed out ashes, but all around the edge were the unconsumed ends of twigs
  and branches looking as if they had been arranged in an exact circle with all
  the charred ends pointing to the center. I searched every square inch of the
  spot while the laborer watched me."</p>

  <p>"Where was the master of the place?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I took care to inform myself beforehand that he was not going to be
  there at that time."</p>

  <p>"And you found...?"</p>

  <p>"Some little burned lumps of bone, but it was impossible to say of what. A
  little lump of gold that might have been a finger ring&mdash;Talley wore such
  a ring, but it had melted into a shapeless lump. A piece of scorched fabric
  barely recognizable as part of the brim of a man's silk hat. Finally, in a
  slight depression where water had gathered, part of a jawbone in which six
  teeth were still fairly intact."</p>

  <p>The Judge shook his head frowning. "Scarcely conclusive! Scarcely
  conclusive!"</p>

  <p>"There is one more witness, sir," said Pen. "Considerable dental work had
  been done on the teeth, and the fillings were still intact. One of the teeth
  it appeared was false, and it had been fastened to its fellows on either side
  in an ingenious fashion."</p>

  <p>"Ha!"</p>

  <p>"Talley it appeared was vain of his personal appearance, and employed a
  first-class dentist. The dentist is prepared to go on the stand and swear
  from the work on the teeth that this is a part of Talley's jaw.</p>

  <p>"From memory?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. He is a modern dentist. He will offer his record in evidence,
  which includes diagrams of the man's mouth, showing the work he did on it
  from time to time."</p>

  <p>Judge Talley forgetting judicial calm jumped up. "Ha! then you have a
  case!" he cried. "Eh, Mr. Hackett?"</p>

  <p>"If it can be proved to the satisfaction of a jury," said the
  Assistant-District-Attorney sourly.</p>

  <p>Judge Stockman paced slowly up and down. "This is
  extraordinary...extraordinary!" he murmured. He came to a stand in front of
  Pen. "Miss Broome, has this man been in court?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. But his representatives are always there. I don't doubt but he
  receives hourly reports of the proceedings."</p>

  <p>"I think you had better tell me the name of the man you accuse. Not with
  any idea of injecting it into this case, but simply that precautions may be
  taken against his escape. The police should be notified."</p>

  <p>Pen looked at Corveth, who nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is Ernest Riever," she said.</p>

  <p>The effect on the two men was electrical, Hackett jumped to his feet, and
  supported himself with a hand on the back of his chair.</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" he cried.</p>

  <p>Judge Stockman in his amazement was staring at Pen almost clownishly.
  "Riever...!" he stammered. "Riever!...Have you thought of what you are
  saying!"</p>

  <p>A little flame of indignation was lighted In Pen's cheeks. "If he did it,
  does it make any difference who he is?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not! Certainly not!...But Riever!...We must be very sure! This
  would cause the greatest sensation of our time!"</p>

  <p>"Best to proceed very slowly, sir!" said Hackett, pale with agitation.</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to do with it!" said Judge Stockman with undisguised
  relief. "My duty is simply to try Counsell. The rest is up to the
  District-Attorney."</p>

  <p>"No motive has been established," said Hackett.</p>

  <p>"True! True!" The Judge turned almost accusingly to Pen. "What possible
  reason could Riever have had?"</p>

  <p>Corveth answered for her. "I take it, it is not necessary to go into
  Riever's motives in this trial. But we are prepared to show a motive just the
  same. Do you remember the Riever divorce case three years ago?"</p>

  <p>"Dimly."</p>

  <p>"It was a counter-suit. Mrs. Riever won. Riever's case rested principally
  on a letter that he produced in court. It had been written by Mrs. Riever to
  some unnamed man. We can show that it had been written to Counsell, and that
  Riever knew it had."</p>

  <p>The judge stared. "Then your contention is that Riever had this
  inoffensive man Dongan killed merely so that he could get back at
  Counsell?"</p>

  <p>"There is more evidence on that point besides what Miss Broome has brought
  out here. I don't need to point out to you how nearly Riever succeeded in his
  object."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" exclaimed Judge Stockman.</p>

  <p>"That would be something new in criminal jurisprudence," sneered
  Hackett.</p>

  <p>"But not entirely unprecedented," corrected the breathless judge. "There
  was the famous Anstey case so often quoted when I was a young lawyer. And of
  more recent years the cases of the People vs. Reichardt and the People vs.
  Bowley...But good God!...Riever...!"</p>

  <p>The little judge seemed to have been brought to a complete stand. He
  stared ahead of him muttering: "Ernest Riever!...Good God!...What a sensation
  will be caused...!"</p>

  <p>Corveth said: "That is all Miss Broome had to tell you, sir."</p>

  <p>It brought the judge to himself with a start. "To be sure! To be sure!" he
  said, and cleared his throat. He looked his age. "I will adjourn court until
  tomorrow morning. Mr. Hackett, you will get in touch with the police I
  suppose. If I were you, I would not take more than one man into my
  confidence, say Inspector Durdan of the detective bureau."</p>

  <p>Hackett bowed in acquiescence.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, let us return to the court-room."</p>

     id="XIV"></a>XIV. &mdash; EXTRA!</h2>

  <p align="center">From the New York <i>Courier</i>, July 27th, 192&mdash;</p>

  <p>AT 3.40 this afternoon Ernest Riever was found dead in a house he
  occasionally occupied at &mdash; East 39th street, this city. He had shot
  himself through the head.</p>

  <p>The sensational developments in the Counsell case during the past two days
  were brought to a still more sensational conclusion this afternoon when
  Ernest Riever was discovered to have killed himself. Ever since yesterday
  morning it has been an open secret around town that Riever was the unnamed
  millionaire so often referred to in the new evidence brought forward in
  Counsell's defense. It now appears that Riever has been under the
  surveillance of the police for three days, and this afternoon detective
  officers were sent to the above address to arrest him. Their ringing at the
  door elicited no response, and as the men who had been detailed to trail
  Riever insisted that he was in the house, an entrance was forced.</p>

  <p>Mr. Riever was discovered lying in his dining-room with an automatic
  pistol in his hand. There was nobody else in the house. He had held the
  pistol under his chin pointing upward. There was smoke in the room, and the
  body was warm, indicating that the deed was done as the officers rang the
  bell. Death was instantaneous. So ends one of the strangest stories that has
  ever come to light in our courts.</p>

  <p>Mr. Riever's self-inflicted death renders the acquittal of Counsell merely
  a matter of form. It is said that the District-Attorney will now make no
  effort to refute the testimony tending to show that Collis Dongan was shot by
  an agent acting under Riever's instructions. The jury is expected to bring in
  a verdict without leaving their seats.</p>

  <p class="first">"DON'T drive so fast Don! It makes my hair rise the way you
  take these curves!"</p>

  <p>"I'll try to remember...Lord! but it's good to have an accelerator under
  your big toe again!...This lil' ole bus is about all I own, Pen!"</p>

  <p>"You'll soon get a fresh start, now...You're driving just as fast as
  ever!"</p>

  <p>"Sorry! I feel as if that mob was still behind us. Wasn't it ghastly!"</p>

  <p>"But they were friendly!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, friendly! Three days ago they would just as lief have strung me up to
  a lamp-post. I could feel it in the court-room."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't you suppose it was a feeling that they had been unjust to you
  that made them cheer so to-day when you appeared?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so. I don't trust mobs...Lord! when I came out and saw them massed
  in the street from curb to curb...thousands!...I could feel myself turning
  pea-green! I had no idea I had become so famous."</p>

  <p>"They have been reading about nothing else for days."</p>

  <p>"What a lot of idle people there must be!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think it's idleness altogether. But nothing ever happens to them.
  They only live in the news-papers."</p>

  <p>"A good many cars followed us out of town. When they saw which way we were
  heading I suppose they'll wire' the news, and cheering crowds will be waiting
  for us..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Don!"</p>

  <p>"I'll fool, 'em! I'll circle around outside Philadelphia and all the big
  towns."</p>

  <p>"It's horribly immoral our running off together in a car."</p>

  <p>"Oh, what do morals matter after what we've been through together!...We
  couldn't get married in New York with that mob at our heels. We can get
  hitched up wherever we happen to stop I suppose."</p>

  <p>"You take it coolly!"</p>

  <p>"I take it as a matter of course...Shouldn't I?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want to be rushed into it!"</p>

  <p>"Pen!...Have you any doubts of me?"</p>

  <p>"No! How can you say such a thing!"</p>

  <p>"Then what is it?...What brings the tears to your eyes, dearest?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing!...Only I want to be quiet when I am married!...I want to be
  quiet!...Things are still roaring about me!"</p>

  <p>"Would you like me to take you home first?"</p>

  <p>"No! I don't want you to leave me!"</p>

  <p>"Look out! You'll have us in the ditch!...What is it, dearest? It's
  immoral our going away together. But you don't want to marry me yet. But I
  mustn't leave you either!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't expect me to talk reasonably!...I don't want to talk...Marry me
  whenever you like, but don't talk about it...I just want to be quiet...with
  you!"</p>

  <p>"Suits me! I'll bring you to quiet. I know a little place in the Virginia
  foothills...Oh, my Pen!...Look behind us!"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Is there anybody in sight?"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to stop for a moment. Do you realize I haven't kissed you
  yet?"</p>
