  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01"></a>I. &mdash; DRAWN BLINDS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE village was beautiful. It was enfolded in a hollow of
  the Downs, and wrapped up snugly&mdash;first, in a floral shawl of gardens,
  and then, in a great green shawl of fields. Lilies and lavender grew in
  abundance. Bees clustered over sweet-scented herbs with the hum of a myriad
  spinning-wheels.</p>

  <p>Although the cottages which lined the cobbled street were perfect
  specimens of Tudor architecture, the large houses on the green were, chiefly,
  of later date. The exception was a mellow Elizabethan mansion&mdash;'Spout
  Manor', on Miss Asprey's printed note-paper&mdash;but known locally by its
  original name of 'The Spout'. This was the residence of Miss Decima Asprey,
  the queen of the village&mdash;an elderly spinster of beautiful appearance
  and character, and possessed of the essential private means.</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey's subjects were not only well-bred and charming, but endowed
  with such charity that there was no poverty or unemployment in the village.
  The ladies had not to grapple with a servant problem, which oiled the wheels
  of hospitality. If family feuds existed, they were not advertised, and
  private lives were shielded by drawn blinds. Consequently, the social tone
  was fragrant as rosemary, and scandal nearly as rare as a unicorn.</p>

  <p>A perfect spot. Viewed from an airplane, by day, it resembled a
  black-and-white plaster model of a Tudor village, under a glass case. At
  night, however, when its lights began to glow faintly, it was like some
  ancient vessel, with barnacled hull and figure-head, riding in the peace of a
  forgotten port.</p>

  <p>It was a spot which was rarely visited. There was no railway station, no
  floating population, and a stagnant birth-rate. Even Death seldom knocked at
  its doors, for the natives resented the mere idea of dying in such a
  delightful place.</p>

  <p>But local prejudice, which had discouraged the Old Gentleman with the
  Scythe, was not strong enough to bar the triumphant progress of the
  motor-bus. Denied passage through its streets, the reeling green monster
  dropped its fares just outside the village, before it looped back to the
  London road.</p>

  <p>One afternoon, in early summer, it brought a woman novelist from
  London&mdash;a thin, fashionable, attractive person, who wrote sensational
  serials, in order to live, although sometimes, when slumbering dreams
  stirred, she questioned their necessity. Although her high French heels
  seemed literally wrenched from city pavements, she had made the sacrifice in
  order to visit a friend, Joan Brook, who was companion to a local lady.</p>

  <p>At the invitation of Lady d'Arcy&mdash;Joan's employer&mdash;the novelist
  had been entertained at the Court, a massive biscuit-hued Georgian pile,
  surrounded with lush parkland, and about a mile from the village. During
  their tea they had both been conscious of mangled strands of friendship, as
  they talked of impersonal matters.</p>

  <p>Each viewed the other from the detached standard of criticism. Joan
  thought her friend's lips suggested that she had been affectionately kissing
  a freshly-painted pillar-box, while the novelist considered that the girl had
  run to seed badly. But when they walked back to the village they had been
  insensibly welded together in harmony, by the waving beauty of the fields,
  ripening for hay and steeped in the glow of sunset. Joan's sunburnt face
  proclaimed the fact that she never wore a hat, but the novelist, too, took
  off her tiny mesh of crocheted silk, without a thought of the set of her
  wave. Smoking as they sauntered, they entered the shady tunnel of the
  Quaker's Walk, half a mile of chestnut avenue.</p>

  <p>"Like it?" asked the novelist.</p>

  <p>"Love it." Joan's blue eyes glowed. "I know you think I'm buried. But this
  corpse hopes the Trump won't sound just yet. I've never been so happy."</p>

  <p>"Pray it may last...Any social life?"</p>

  <p>"Tennis and garden-parties, later on. The three big houses are the Hall,
  the Towers and the Court. The Court is ours. The Squire lives at the Hall.
  The rich people of the neighbourhood live at the Towers, but they're always
  away."</p>

  <p>"Any men?"</p>

  <p>"Two. The parson and Major Blair. The Major's a manly man and he belongs
  to Vivian Sheriff, the Squire's daughter. Vivian and I are the only girls
  here."</p>

  <p>The novelist raised her painted butterfly brows.</p>

  <p>"Let me get this straight," she said. "There's the Vivian-girl and the
  biological specimen. That leaves you and the padre. What's he like?"</p>

  <p>"Rather a thrill. Big and black, with a voice like a gong. You should hear
  him hammer and bellow on Sundays. But I believe he's the genuine thing."</p>

  <p>"Going to marry him?"</p>

  <p>Joan was conscious of a slight recoil, so that she had to remind herself
  of her former standard of modern frankness.</p>

  <p>"If he doesn't break away, I may," she replied. "After all, I've had to
  submit meekly to employers all my life, and I'd like to do some bossing
  myself, for a change. Purely, can't you see me telling the cottagers to boil
  their potatoes in their skins, and not to have any more babies?"</p>

  <p>"I'd believe anything of you, Brook," remarked her friend. "By the way,
  what's your Lady d'Arcy like?"</p>

  <p>"Big and vague, and drifts about aimlessly. I've nothing to do but to act
  as some sort of anchor. I get a big salary which I can't spend here. But it's
  not wasted at home. They're nearly sunk, bless 'em."</p>

  <p>The novelist's face was not painted to be revealing, but she nodded to
  show her sympathy with the prevailing economic depression as she studied Joan
  through her monocle. The girl was tall and strong, with a face expressive of
  character, and fearless eyes. She wore a sleeveless white tennis-frock and
  silver slave-bangles on her brown arms. Although she had grown more solid,
  she seemed to be of compact virtues and charm.</p>

  <p>"Well? The verdict?" asked Joan.</p>

  <p>"Guilty!" replied her friend. "You're a last year's model. You've put on
  weight. Your lips look indecently like lips. And&mdash;darling, I'm jealous
  as hell."</p>

  <p>"I know I wouldn't swap jobs with you." Joan gave a contented laugh. "This
  is really a marvellous place, Purley. Everyone has a pedigree and a private
  income. Everyone's kind. And, my dear, everyone's married."</p>

  <p>"I get it. No love-babies, no drains. Gosh, what a picture!" As the two
  women emerged from the gloom of the avenue they saw the village with its
  ancient cottages and choked flower-gardens, all steeped in the carnation glow
  of sunset. At each step they seemed to turn a fresh page of a fairy-tale,
  with illuminated borders jumbled with box-edging, sage, damson-trees,
  beehives and a patchwork quilt of peonies, pinks and pansies. Golden girls
  and boys skipped in the street, while cats were growing mysterious as they
  awaited the herald&mdash;twilight. Soon their real life would begin.</p>

  <p>The novelist surrendered herself to the enchantment, although her lip
  curled at evidence of the survival of the Feudal System, for all the children
  bobbed to the 'quality'.</p>

  <p>As they lingered on the green, Joan pointed to a solid house of buff
  stucco, adorned with a clock-tower.</p>

  <p>"That's 'Clock House'," she said. "The Scudamores live there. I hope we'll
  meet them, for they're types. They're terribly nice and terribly
  happily-married. I call them 'The Spirit of the Village'. <i>You'd</i> find
  them 'Copy'."</p>

  <p>The novelist stifled her groan, as Joan proceeded to do the honours of the
  village. She waved her cigarette towards a grey stone house which was backed
  by the Norman church.</p>

  <p>"The Rectory. <i>My</i> future home." She forced the note of impudence.
  "Just behind us is the doctor's house, but the walls hide it. It's Queen Anne
  and rather sweet. He and his wife always play tennis after dinner. You can
  hear them."</p>

  <p>As they stood, listening, the dull thuds behind the rose-red bricks
  mingled with the faint laughter of children and the cawing of rooks in the
  elms. Suddenly, the novelist fell prostrate before the cumulative spell of
  the village.</p>

  <p>"It's perfect," she declared. "I wonder if I could rent a cottage for the
  summer."</p>

  <p>"If you did you'd never go back to London," Joan told her. "Nobody ever
  goes away, not even for holidays. Look out. Here are the Scudamores."</p>

  <p>She guiltily hid her cigarette behind her back, as a middle-aged couple
  advanced, arm-in-arm, over the cobbles. The man had a clean-shaven,
  long-lipped, legal face, to proclaim him a lawyer with the best County
  connection, together with a nose which had been in his family for
  centuries.</p>

  <p>His wife was also tall, and possessed of bleached beauty and elegance. Her
  luxuriant fair hair was fast fading to grey, and her draperies were
  indefinitely grey-green in colour, like a glacier-fed river.</p>

  <p>She greeted Lady d'Arcy's companion with a gracious bow, but did not even
  glance at her companion.</p>

  <p>"She didn't really like me," murmured the novelist when the Scudamores had
  passed. "Do I look like a fallen woman? Tell her I'm respectable, if
  painted."</p>

  <p>"My dear," gurgled Joan, "she's so charitable that she would not take a
  chance of disliking you. That's why she wouldn't look. She's a bit
  overwhelming, but a real Christian...I say, Purley."</p>

  <p>As Joan paused and regarded her friend intently, the novelist braced
  herself to meet the inevitable question.</p>

  <p>"Can't you make a story out of this village?"</p>

  <p>"You <i>would</i> say that." The novelist's tone was acid. "But, my good
  woman, what possible copy could I find here? Jane Austen's beaten me to
  <i>Cranford</i>. The truth is, my child, if there'd been no Fall, there'd be
  no Publishers and no Lending Libraries."</p>

  <p>"But there must be a story everywhere," persisted Joan.</p>

  <p>"Not for me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come, Purley, have a shot at it. I want to be amused."</p>

  <p>The novelist puckered up her painted lips in a whimsical smile.</p>

  <p>"All right," she conceded. "But I'll have to follow my own special line.
  Something like this. This village seems an earthly paradise, with a
  population of kindly gracious souls. <i>But</i> the flowers are growing on
  slime. When twilight falls, they light their lamps and draw down their
  blinds. And then&mdash;when no one can see them they lead their <i>real</i>
  lives."</p>

  <p>"For example?" urged Joan.</p>

  <p>"Well, to begin with, that highly-respectable married couple, who
  disapproved of my lips, are not really married to each other, but are living
  in sin."</p>

  <p>"You priceless chump. Tell me the story of their double life."</p>

  <p>"No, I must outline my synopsis first and collect my characters...Hum. The
  Parsonage is hidden by those discreet yews, so the Rector hasn't got to wait
  until dark. I think, at this moment, he's throwing a bottle-and-pyjama party
  with some very hot ladies from town. As for your doctor, he's slowly
  poisoning his wife, and their tennis is his opportunity. When they've
  finished their game, she'll be thirsty, and her devoted husband will see to
  it that she gets the right quencher. Something safe, and very painful."</p>

  <p>"Ugh," grimaced Joan. "When I'm Mrs. Padre, I'll ban your novels in our
  village library."</p>

  <p>Once again she was urged to speak recklessly of her designs on the Rector,
  from a clouded feeling that she was protecting herself from the unforgivable
  charge of sentiment. Lighting another cigarette, she strolled after her
  friend, who was peering through the scrolls of lacey iron-work which
  ornamented the gates of 'The Spout'.</p>

  <p>In the distance, against a background of laurels, the novelist saw an
  austere, silver-haired woman, seated on a bench beside a lily-pond. Her hands
  were clasped and her eyes raised as though in meditation. She held her pose
  so rigidly that the folds of her white gown appeared to be carven marble,
  creating the illusion of an enshrined saint.</p>

  <p>But even as the novelist readjusted her monocle, the statue dissolved into
  life at a touch of warm humanity. Down the yew alley, pottered a little dumpy
  woman, carrying a glass of milk on a tray. The tall lady patted her
  shoulders, in thanks, and then drained the glass hastily, as though in
  obedience to the laws of nutrition, but with a supreme contempt for
  digestion.</p>

  <p>When she walked towards the house, followed by her companion, the
  difference in their heights was ludicrous, for she was above the usual
  stature, while her employee was below the average.</p>

  <p>"Miss Asprey and her companion, Miss Mack," whispered Joan. "She's an
  earthly saint, and so good she's not quite human. Miss Mack simply worships
  her, and runs after her like a little dog."</p>

  <p>"Then they shall go into my serial," announced the novelist. "Listen. In
  reality, your pure, saintly Miss Asprey is a secret sadist. Directly the
  blinds are drawn, she will begin to torture her poor little companion."</p>

  <p>"Can you help being a fool?" asked Joan unkindly.</p>

  <p>"You asked for this story, didn't you? Now I'll outline the plot, while
  we're waiting to go to the bus."</p>

  <p>Leaning against the white posts which ringed the green, Joan listened
  dreamily to her friend's sensational story, which foamed with melodramatic
  incidents. But even while she laughed at its utter absurdity, she resented
  it, subconsciously, as an outrage.</p>

  <p>'What's the matter with me?' she wondered. 'Purley's really terribly
  funny. It's only a leg-pull. But&mdash;it's cheap.'</p>

  <p>She was grateful when her friend grew tired, and glanced at her watch.</p>

  <p>"Better be pushing on," she remarked. "Although I just hate to leave
  this."</p>

  <p>The grass was like water-silk, mottled with bars of sunken gold and the
  cottages rocked through a lavender mist. Twilight was veiling the street as
  they walked towards the inn, but there were no lights in the village. People
  sat at open windows, or hung over gates, exchanging greetings and gossip with
  passers-by. Everyone seemed to be sharing the universal friendship of this
  interval 'between the lights'.</p>

  <p>The moment of withdrawal was at hand.</p>

  <p>Presently the novelist stopped, arrested by the sight of a dim, low,
  lath-and-plaster building, enclosed within a paved garden.</p>

  <p>"Gosh, I can smell mildew," she said. "I take it, that is the oldest house
  in the village."</p>

  <p>"I <i>knew</i> you'd make that mistake," exulted Joan. "Every tripper
  does. That's only a fake-antique, built from fragments of old barns, and it's
  got every sort of modern improvement. I love it, but the village resents it,
  especially as its owner is a newcomer. She's only been here eleven
  years."</p>

  <p>"Who's the lucky woman?" sighed the novelist.</p>

  <p>"Our local novelist&mdash;Miss Julia Corner."</p>

  <p>Instantly the writer registered that automatic nonrecognition of her
  profession towards other members of the tribe.</p>

  <p>"Never heard of her. What name does she write under?"</p>

  <p>"Her own, and she does jolly well, too. She's a dear old Jumbo, with a
  perfectly grim sense of humour."</p>

  <p>"Hum." The novelist thought of her own tiny mansion-flat. "Evidently, she
  makes virtue pay. Any special line?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, she's the President of our local Temperance Society, and she makes
  the children sign the Pledge."</p>

  <p>"Then, to pay her out for having a better house than me, I'll put her into
  my serial. She's a secret drinker and hides a bottle of whisky in her
  wardrobe. At this minute, she is lying under the bed, dead drunk."</p>

  <p>Even as she spoke, the oaken door, white with age, was opened, and a
  massive figure blocked the entry, waving a teapot, in welcome.</p>

  <p>"Come in for a cup of tea," she shouted.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, but we're catching the bus," called Joan.</p>

  <p>Instantly Miss Corner swayed down the flagged path to the garden gate,
  moving with the deceptive speed of an elephant. The writer from London saw a
  big red face, radiant with good-nature, bobbed iron-grey hair&mdash;cut in a
  fringe&mdash;and beaming eyes behind large horn-rimmed spectacles. Miss
  Corner wore an infantile Buster Brown blouse, adorned with wide collar and
  ribbon bow, and a grey tweed skirt.</p>

  <p>"I'm just writing a short tale for the Christmas Number of a Boy's
  Annual," she announced proudly. "It's commissioned, of course. I take a
  generic interest in boys. Won't you come in and be introduced to my
  collaborator&mdash;Captain Kettle?"</p>

  <p>She laughed heartily at her joke, but the source of her amusement was the
  stranger's painted lips and monocle. When Joan introduced her friend, she
  held out her big hand cordially.</p>

  <p>"A fellow writer?" she exclaimed. "What name do you write under?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, but we mustn't stop," said Joan hastily.</p>

  <p>"Pity," remarked Miss Corner. "I should love to talk shop. For instance,
  do you let yourself be grabbed by your characters, or do you go out
  deliberately to collect copy?"</p>

  <p>"She's already found a story in this village," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"Then I presume it's for your Parish Magazine," grinned Miss Corner.
  "Well, since you persist in going, I must return to my boys. Good-bye. Give
  my love to my special boy&mdash;Eros."</p>

  <p>They heard her chuckle rumbling from behind the sweet-briar hedge as they
  walked away.</p>

  <p>"What'd you think of her?" asked Joan.</p>

  <p>The novelist did not reply, for she was suddenly gripped with overwhelming
  nostalgia. At that moment, London seemed so far away&mdash;a place to which
  she would never return. She felt as though she were being held by the
  village&mdash;no longer a sunset pool of beauty&mdash;but a witched,
  forgotten spot of whispers, and echoes, and old musty twilight stories.</p>

  <p>"Are we far from the inn?" she asked wearily.</p>

  <p>"No. Nearly there."</p>

  <p>"Good. I could do with a gin-and-it."</p>

  <p>The King's Head was a long, low, ancient building, with the faded
  oil-painting of some dead monarch pendant above its doorway. A faint glow
  from a hanging ironwork lantern flickered feebly on peeling plaster walls and
  tiny lattice windows. The writer flopped down on an old settle and stared out
  at the spread of dark silent country.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you want a drink?" asked Joan hospitably.</p>

  <p>"No. Desire is dead."</p>

  <p>The friends sat in silence, which was presently broken by the
  novelist.</p>

  <p>"Do people ever <i>try</i> to get away from here?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"They don't want to," replied Joan. "Miss Asprey has a
  housemaid&mdash;Ada&mdash;who's the most beautiful girl I've seen. You'd
  think she'd want to go on the Stage or the Films, but her only ambition is to
  be Miss Asprey's parlourmaid. It would take about a ton of dynamite to shift
  her to Hollywood."</p>

  <p>The writer made no comment, for her very mind seemed root-bound.</p>

  <p>And then&mdash;suddenly&mdash;the miracle happened. Two golden sparks
  appeared in the distance, while a murmur vibrated through the darkness. As
  they watched, the lights grew brighter and larger, and then were lost in a
  dip of the landscape. But the hum deepened into a snarl, and round the bend
  of the road reeled a green monster motor-bus, with brilliant windows and the
  magic name 'LONDON' glowing in flaming letters.</p>

  <p>It looked so utterly incongruous in that forsaken wilderness, as to appear
  unreal, like a vision of the Mechanical Age of the Future projected before
  the incredulous vision of some dreamer in the Past.</p>

  <p>At the sight of it, the novelist's heart leaped in welcome. <i>London</i>.
  It reminded her that she was going back to grime and noise&mdash;to pavements
  and city lights. In her joy, she was swept away on a wave of insincere
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"I've loved every minute," she declared. "Good thing I'm going back, or
  the village might have got me, too."</p>

  <p>"Too?" echoed Joan. "What d'you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>The writer looked at her friend and was suddenly aware of the origin of
  her change.</p>

  <p>"You're in love, Brooky," she said accusingly. "The village can't get you,
  because a man's got in first. Well, good-bye. Don't forget to tell me how my
  serial works out."</p>

  <p>"I won't," promised Joan. "Shame you've got to go back."</p>

  <p>"A shattering shame."</p>

  <p>Joan was guiltily conscious of relief as she watched her friend climb
  briskly into the bus. In her turn, the novelist sank gratefully into her
  seat, and waved her hand in farewell. She was leaving peace and beauty, and
  she left them gladly. When the dark countryside began to slide slowly past
  the window, she watched it flow behind her, with a smile on her lips.</p>

  <p>She was going back to London.</p>

  <p>Joan stood before the inn and watched the motor-bus, until it had roared
  out of sight. Slowly the dust sifted down again, to mingle with the soil of
  its origin. The fumes of petrol rose higher and higher, until they were
  dissipated in the aether. The faint snarl of the engine sped on its journey
  to the last lone star.</p>

  <p>'I'm glad old Purley's gone,' thought Joan, lighting another cigarette for
  company.</p>

  <p>When she walked slowly through the village, the moon had risen and was
  silvering the old Tudor buildings, transforming them to ebon and ivory.
  Everyone had gone indoors; the lamps were lit and the blinds were drawn. Once
  again, the old ship rode at anchor in the dead port of Yesterday.</p>

  <p>Joan was reminded of her friend's serial, by those screened windows, and
  her lip curled with derision. She knew each lighted interior so well, and was
  familiar with the evening's procedure. Miss Corner was tapping away at her
  incredible epic of how the Mile was won by the smallest boy in the school.
  The doctor and his wife were reading, for they subscribed to a London
  Library. In this big house they listened in to classical music on the air,
  and in that small one they drank cocoa and played Patience.</p>

  <p>Everywhere was domestic drama, staged in the peace of Curfew. There were
  contented servants in comfortable kitchens; well-fed cats and dogs sleeping
  on rugs; clocks ticking away serene hours.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to tell her that her friend's fantastic melodrama was
  justified by even one instance of insecurity and misery, or what was really
  happening behind drawn blinds. Only the walls heard&mdash;and they kept their
  secret.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02"></a>II. &mdash; BICARBONATE</h2>

  <p class="first">TWO days had passed since the novelist's return to London,
  and nothing survived her visit but a few gnat-bites on her ankles and a filmy
  memory. The village retained even less of her personality; Joan washed her
  entirely from her mind, while no one mentioned the painted stranger with the
  monocle. The picture-paper which was printing her current serial was not in
  local circulation, so not even her work remained.</p>

  <p>But, although life flowed on with the tranquillity of a brimful glassy
  river, the peace and security of the village was about to be shattered. Like
  a certain small animal which precedes a beast-of-prey, the novelist had been
  the herald of disaster. The communal harmony was static; but the first
  disrupting incident was timed for that evening.</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry was late in coming home to dinner. He pushed open his
  garden-gate with his habitual sense of a mariner returning to port, as he saw
  the mellow red-brick front of the Queen Anne house. The shaven lawn was
  veined with evening sunlight, and the wide border of tall pink tulips and
  forget-me-nots&mdash;although imperceptibly past perfection&mdash;was still a
  cloud of shot azure and rose.</p>

  <p>He was met on the steps of the porch by a reproachful wife. He had married
  his dispenser&mdash;the daughter of an impoverished Irish peer&mdash;and,
  therefore a stranger; but the village had accepted her on the credential of
  her husband.</p>

  <p>At first sight, they appeared an ill-assorted couple. The doctor belonged
  to one of the oldest families, and was pale and thin, with a pleasant manner
  and a tired voice, while his wife was very dark and possessed a parched,
  passionate beauty.</p>

  <p>The black rings around her eyes and her crumpled evening-gown of golden
  tissue gave her the appearance of a disreputable night-club hostess greeting
  the dawn; but a strong scent of violet-powder was a clue to a domestic
  occupation. She had just finished the job of bathing two resisting infants,
  and, as maternity was, to her, an emotional storm, she had exhausted herself
  with their wriggles and her own intense rapture.</p>

  <p>"Well, Marianne," said her husband, kissing her lightly, "how's the
  family?"</p>

  <p>"In bed," replied Marianne Perry, in her deep, throbbing voice, "I do wish
  you'd been here to see them in their bath. Micky <i>nearly</i> swam."</p>

  <p>"Good. But you look a wet rag," remarked the doctor, as they walked
  through the wide, panelled hall. The western sun shone through
  delphinium-blue curtains, revealing an artistic interior, which was rather
  marred by scattered toys and two perambulators parked in corners.</p>

  <p>"Got a pain." Marianne clasped the region of her waist. "Darling, are you
  poisoning me, so that you can marry my rival, Miss Corner?"</p>

  <p>The doctor was false to the London novelist's conception of a
  double-character, for he displayed no anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Too many green gooseberries," he said lightly. "Better take some
  bicarbonate of soda. It'll settle you, one way&mdash;or the other."</p>

  <p>"Make me sick? I want my dinner, you brute." Marianne dragged the doctor
  away from the staircase. "No, you can't change. You're too late. Dinner's
  dished up."</p>

  <p>Arm-in-arm, they entered the dining-room, a pleasant, well-proportioned
  apartment, hung with oatmeal linen and furnished with a walnut suite. The
  table-silver was tarnished and the service sketchy, but the meal was
  remarkably good. Apparently the doctor was not making a success of poisoning
  his wife, for she ate with a good appetite, in spite of her alleged pain.</p>

  <p>"How's the practice?" she asked presently.</p>

  <p>"As usual," replied the doctor. "Nothing revealing."</p>

  <p>"Been to see Miss Corner?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Liar. Let me see your case-book."</p>

  <p>The doctor laid it on the tablecloth without comment.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to make up the books after dinner," announced his wife,
  flicking open the pages.</p>

  <p>She spoke with relish, for this was a favourite occupation. The village
  took its health seriously, and was punctilious in its payments, so that she
  knew that she was not merely rolling up a paper income when she added up the
  columns.</p>

  <p>"'J.C.', 'J.C.'," she murmured. "Miss Corner's as good as an annuity.
  What's the matter with her?"</p>

  <p>"Suppose you ask her yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I <i>know</i>. She's too fat. Is she rich?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"But, Horatio, that house cost thousands to build, and there is no money
  shortage there. She pays her cook seventy. She can't do it on her silly
  books."</p>

  <p>"No?"</p>

  <p>"'No?'" Marianne parodied her husband's toneless voice. "My good man, are
  you <i>ever</i> interested in anything or anyone?"</p>

  <p>"That's a curious charge to make." The doctor spoke with his usual
  inertia, but there was a fugitive gleam in his quiet eyes. "Actually, I
  endure a chronic condition of frustrate curiosity...I admit, I care nothing
  for anyone's income, so long as he pays my bill, and I can't get excited
  about common-or-garden ailments. <i>But</i>&mdash;I would like to know what
  is really at the back of anyone's mind."</p>

  <p>"Does anyone?" asked Marianne. "Do you know me?"</p>

  <p>"No." The doctor winced as his wife began to dismember a fowl with her
  usual furious energy. "I wish I did. I should know then why you insist on
  carving. You'd make a devastating surgeon."</p>

  <p>"I carve, because I hate to see you with a knife. You're so deadly
  professional that I feel I'm watching an operation. And that's a true message
  from the Back of Beyond, Mr. Curious...By the way, Micky's got a new word. It
  <i>sounded</i> just like 'bloody'. But I'm waiting for him to say it again,
  and living in hope."</p>

  <p>During the remainder of the meal, Marianne talked exclusively of her
  infants. Before it was actually finished, she sprang to her feet and again
  clasped her waist passionately.</p>

  <p>"I was a fool to have any dinner," she exclaimed. "My inside's woke up and
  is swearing at me like mad."</p>

  <p>"Bicarbonate," murmured her husband. "How about some tennis, later
  on?"</p>

  <p>"No, my beloved, Momma's no time to play with her biggest baby, this
  evening. After I'm through with the dispensing I'm going to get busy on those
  books."</p>

  <p>Her eyes glowed at the prospect, and she entirely forgot her interior
  grumbles.</p>

  <p>"I just love it," she declared. "Figures are a real joy to me. I ought to
  have been a bookie. And all the time I'm jotting down items I'm saying,
  'Here's a packet of rusks for baby', and 'Here's new woollen panties for
  Micky'. What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"Finish my novel."</p>

  <p>The doctor strolled into the drawing-room, which was a cool, pleasant
  place, of faint pastel-tints, and green from the shade of plane-trees.
  Stretched on the faded old-rose divan, with his boots wrinkling the silken
  spread, he lost himself in the translation of a Russian play. Presently,
  Marianne entered, loaded with stationery, which she dumped down on the
  bureau.</p>

  <p>She gave a cry at the disorder of the couch.</p>

  <p>"Curse you, darling. Those cushions are clean."</p>

  <p>The doctor slipped guiltily off the divan.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll go and smoke a pipe with the padre," he said.</p>

  <p>"Do. Go before I slay you. Give my love to that young man and tell him to
  stop shouting in the pulpit. As a mother, I protest against his waking up all
  the babies in Australia. And you needn't hurry back, for you're not popular.
  Leave me your novel."</p>

  <p>The doctor fished it up from the carpet.</p>

  <p>"Better not," he advised. "Like a woman, you'll miss its philosophy, and
  pick out all the improper bits. And then you'll slang men, generally, for
  their filthy taste...Good-bye, Marianne."</p>

  <p>He left his wife feverishly turning over the pages of a ledger, while he
  mounted the shallow wide oaken staircase, in order to wash and change his
  coat. When he had finished his toilet, he stole into the night-nursery, where
  the two babies lay asleep, each with doubled fists and damp, downy head.</p>

  <p>Although one was ten months the elder, there was a strong likeness between
  them; both were palpable little doctors, and outwardly ignored relationship
  with their temperamental mother. They were luxuriant babies, too, in
  expensive sleeping-suits, and tucked up under delicately-hued, ribbon-bound,
  air-cell blankets. Opulent satin bows decorated their white enamelled cots,
  and they had huge furry animal-toys for bed-fellows.</p>

  <p>As the doctor stood looking down at them, the door was softly opened, and
  Marianne entered. A strap of her golden gown had slipped from her shoulder,
  and a lock of dark hair fell over her cheek, giving her a semblance of
  utterly disreputable allure. She threw her bare arm around her husband's neck
  and completed a picture of domestic happiness.</p>

  <p>"Aren't they beautiful&mdash;<i>beautiful</i>?" she crooned.</p>

  <p>"They are," agreed the doctor.</p>

  <p>Marianne's clasp on his shoulder tightened to a clutch, and she burst into
  tears.</p>

  <p>"Ought we to have done it?" she cried. "They're so helpless&mdash;so
  entirely dependent on us. Suppose anything happened to you? Or to me?
  Strangers to care for them. Suppose the practice went down? What would become
  of them?"</p>

  <p>Her husband instinctively shut his eyes as though blinded by the glare of
  tragedy. The next moment he had recovered his self-possession, as he patted
  his wife's arm, with a gentle laugh.</p>

  <p>"You're morbid. It's probably due to acidity. You'd better go and take
  that bicarbonate."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03"></a>III. &mdash; THE HERALD</h2>

  <p class="first">TEN minutes later Dr. Perry lay stretched on a shabby
  'Varsity chair on the Rector's yew-shaded lawn, while his host paced the
  daisied grass, waving his pipe, and declaiming as he tramped. In his
  character of a human dynamo, he was a source of interest to the doctor's
  curious mind; and, as he smoked, he studied him with cool detachment.</p>

  <p>The Reverend Simon Blake was a tall, bull-necked man, of great muscular
  strength, with blunted, classic features, crisp coal-black hair, and
  flashing, arrogant eyes. He looked rather like the offspring of a union
  between a battered Roman emperor and an anonymous plebeian mother. His voice
  was strong and vibrant, and all his gestures expressed vehemence. He appeared
  never to have acquired the habit of sitting, and he talked continuously.</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry knew that his display of overflowing vitality was misleading,
  and that he was only in the process of rekindling fires which had blazed too
  fiercely, and died. It was the last back-kick of nervous tension which made
  him such a restless planet of a fellow. He had worked himself out in a
  Dockside parish, sticking to his job long after he was beaten. Not until he
  had crashed, both mentally and physically, had he consented to accept this
  living in the country.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, man," urged the doctor. "You're like the spirit of atomic
  energy."</p>

  <p>The Rector obediently dropped down on his protesting chair, with the force
  of machinery, only to spring up again.</p>

  <p>"This place, doctor," he said, "is perfect. I pray I may end my days here.
  Look at it, now."</p>

  <p>He waved his pipe towards the village street, which staged the usual
  sunset pageant. Children skipped and played on the cobbles, exactly like
  golden girls and boys and little chimney-sweepers, long passed to dust. Women
  gossiped over their garden gates, just as they had gossiped in Tudor times,
  and they talked of much the same things. At a quarter-to-eight, Mr. and Mrs.
  Scudamore emerged from the gates of the Clock House for their evening stroll.
  The lady wore a feathered hat and a fichu of real lace, and all the village
  did homage to the Honiton point.</p>

  <p>The doctor studied the Rector, and he&mdash;in his turn&mdash;watched the
  stately advance of the pair. The clergyman noticed how the lawyer's
  frost-bitten face thawed whenever he spoke to his wife, and he was delighted
  by her responsive smile. Yet they were not too engrossed in each other to
  pass a couple of sunburnt children, in old-fashioned lilac sun-bonnets. The
  little girl took a sugar almond out of her mouth, to prove that its colour
  had turned from pink to white, and the Scudamores rather overdid their
  pantomimic surprise at the miracle.</p>

  <p>The doctor's lip curled slightly, but the Rector beamed.</p>

  <p>"Lovers still," he said. "That's a perfect marriage."</p>

  <p>"In the sight of God <i>and</i> the neighbours," murmured the doctor. He
  added with a bleak smile, "There is only one danger in this 'God save the
  Squire and his relations' attitude. The villagers would be too sunken in
  tradition to complain, in case of abuse. They know they wouldn't be
  believed."</p>

  <p>"Abuse?" echoed the Rector. "<i>Here?</i> Are you mad?"</p>

  <p>"Probably. Most of us are, if we're normal. By the way, when I get a free
  Sunday I'm coming to hear you preach, padre. You're the one man who can keep
  me awake."</p>

  <p>The Rector grinned in a boyish, half-bashful manner.</p>

  <p>"I know I'm a noisy fellow," he confessed, "but oratory is my talent. It's
  out of place here, but I dare not let it rust. Besides, it may do secret
  good. Who knows?"</p>

  <p>He knew that his red-hot Gospel, with which he had blasted his old Parish
  to attention, was like a series of bombs exploding under the arches of the
  Norman church. But habit persisted, and he exhorted his hearers, every
  Sunday, to search their hearts for hidden sin. The congregation remained
  tranquil, while he liked the sound of his own organ-voice.</p>

  <p>The Scudamores had disappeared round the bend when the delicately-wrought
  iron gates of 'The Spout' were opened to let out a girl. In the distance she
  looked like Joan Brook; and the doctor, who was also misled, watched the
  sudden flicker of interest in the Rector's face. When she drew nearer,
  however, it was evident that Joan was only her model, for she was far more
  beautiful than Lady d'Arcy's companion.</p>

  <p>Her hair was red-gold, her eyes blue-green, and her complexion a compound
  of cherries and cream, while her features and her unwashed milky teeth were
  perfect. She wore a sleeveless white frock of cheap crêpe-de-Chine, silk
  stockings of the shade known as 'muddy water', and silver slave-bangles on
  her shapely arms. Only her red hands betrayed her dedication to the tasks of
  domestic service.</p>

  <p>It was Ada&mdash;Miss Asprey's famous housemaid, and the acknowledged
  beauty of the district. She crossed the green, and then lingered under the
  wall of the raised Rectory garden, in order to consult her wrist-watch,
  which, outwardly, was exactly like Joan Brook's. Directly she saw the two men
  smoking above her, she dropped as simple a curtsy as any of the village
  children.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Ada," beamed the Rector. "Finished with work?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," smiled Ada.</p>

  <p>"What do you find to do on your evenings out?" asked the Rector.</p>

  <p>"Plenty, sir."</p>

  <p>"And you never get bored, or miss the Pictures?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>no</i>, sir." Ada's violet eyes were filled with reproach. "I'm
  going home, to see our mother's new baby."</p>

  <p>"A new baby? Fine. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"A boy, sir."</p>

  <p>Glancing again at her watch, she dropped a second curtsy, and hurried in
  the direction of the Quakers' Walk.</p>

  <p>"Now, isn't that refreshing?" demanded the Rector. "Compare it with stuffy
  cinemas, with their crime and sex pictures...By the way, I didn't know Mrs.
  Lee had a baby. How old is he?"</p>

  <p>"About twenty-six," replied the doctor. "He's the Squire's new
  chauffeur."</p>

  <p>The Rector laughed heartily at himself.</p>

  <p>"Fell for it, didn't I? She took me up the garden. But after all, she's
  got the real thing, and that's better than watching canned love on a
  screen."</p>

  <p>"Hum, in the one case, fourpence may be the extent of the damage. In my
  profession I've learned that tinned goods may be less harmful than in their
  original state."</p>

  <p>"No." The Rector's eyes blazed. "Not here. There's no immorality in the
  village. And no class-hatred or modern unrest. They reflect the general tone
  of kindness and good breeding. I've never known a place with so little
  scandal. And the charity almost overlaps. No wretched slums, no leaky roofs
  or insanitary conditions."</p>

  <p>"I agree," said the doctor in his tired voice. "But this fact remains.
  None of the local ladies use makeup, not even my own civilised wife, because
  Mrs. Scudamore has decreed that paint is an outrage on good taste. Yet, do
  you ever see cracked lips, or damaged skins?"</p>

  <p>"What are you driving at?" asked the Rector.</p>

  <p>"Merely that they must use vanishing-cream and colourless lip-salve...The
  moral is, padre, that human nature remains the same, everywhere, and dark
  places exist in every mind."</p>

  <p>"Well, you probably know more about that than I do." The Rector's voice
  was regretful. "People no longer confide their difficulties and doubts to
  their parson. But, as a doctor, you must catch them off guard."</p>

  <p>"Do I?" The doctor smiled as he tried, in vain, to catch a small white
  moth. "No, padre, they always put on clean pillow-slips for the doctor's
  visit."</p>

  <p>The Rector made no comment; at last, even he was drugged to silence by the
  combined spell of twilight and tobacco. The purple and gold bars of sunset
  had faded from the sky&mdash;the voices of the gossiping women were stilled.
  People went indoors, to eat dinner or to prepare supper. The Scudamores made
  their stately re-entry of the Clock House&mdash;arm-in-arm, to the very last
  cobble-stone. In the gloom of the Quakers' Walk, Miss Asprey's beautiful Ada
  kissed and cuddled her mother's new baby, who had grown a Ronald Colman
  moustache.</p>

  <p>Lights began to prick the gloom, while the first star trembled in the
  faint green sky. Across the green, little golden diamonds, like clustering
  bees, glowed through the lattice-panes of Miss Asprey's Elizabethan
  mansion.</p>

  <p>The Rector was stirred, by the sight of them, to a revival of
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"As you say," he remarked, "no one can be perfect. Yet Miss Asprey is as
  nearly a saint as any woman can be. She has an influence on me which is
  almost spiritual. I go to see her whenever I'm worked-up and jumpy, and I
  come away with my prickles all smoothed down."</p>

  <p>The doctor studied him, through his glasses, as though he were something
  on a microscope-slide.</p>

  <p>"Do you? Interesting. As a matter-of-fact, I've also noticed that that
  good lady seems to possess some soothing quality. But it's disastrous to a
  man of my lethargic nature. After I've been at 'The Spout', I feel about as
  torpid as though I'd taken veronal. I used not to notice it, so I suppose I'm
  growing old, or extra slack."</p>

  <p>Both men spoke casually, and their words were lost upon utterance. They
  could not tell, then, that when they were plunged, later, into the dark
  labyrinth of mystery, a gramophone record of the evening's conversation would
  hold a clue to one of the key-positions.</p>

  <p>"You ought to take a holiday," advised the Rector.</p>

  <p>"Too much fag."</p>

  <p>The doctor's dragging voice was scarcely audible. Night was dropping on
  the village in veil upon veil of cloudy blue, citrine, and grey. The men sank
  lower in their chairs and sucked at their pipes, at peace with Nature and
  themselves. They might have been sunken in the subaqueous gloom of a
  fathomless sea&mdash;untroubled by the screws of steamers churning the waters
  above.</p>

  <p>Yet, even then, the first blow was about to fall on the village. Far away,
  in the distance, sounded the postman's double-knock. Presently, he appeared
  in sight, a little globe of a man, with steel-rimmed spectacles. He rejected
  the Rectory, but entered the gates of 'The Spout'. They heard his familiar
  rat-tat, and then they saw him come out of the garden again, and go on his
  way&mdash;but they did not recognise him for the herald of disaster.</p>

  <p>Presently the Rector stirred to life.</p>

  <p>"Chilly," he remarked. "We'd better go in and have a whisky."</p>

  <p>As the men rose stiffly from their low chairs, the Rectory gate creaked,
  and Rose&mdash;Miss Asprey's unhappily-named parlourmaid&mdash;stalked up the
  gravel drive. She was a gaunt, long-lipped dragoon of a woman, and had been
  in service at a Bishop's palace, so did not pay the local homage to the
  parson. Her voice was harsh as she gave her commands.</p>

  <p>"Miss Asprey's compliments, and will you please to come over, at
  once."</p>

  <p>"Is it urgent?" asked the Rector, not too pleased at the prospect, for his
  lighted study windows called him, and the whisky was waiting.</p>

  <p>"The mistress says please come at once, as it's <i>most
  important</i>."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, then, I'll be over directly."</p>

  <p>Rose's tall, black-and-white figure led the way down the path, as the
  Rector turned to Dr. Perry.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you won't wait for me?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks, padre, I will," replied the doctor. "I believe Gillie Potter is
  on the air tonight, so I'll amuse myself with your Wireless."</p>

  <p>As he looked after his host, his usually listless eyes were bright with
  interest, and he meant to wait until midnight, if necessary, for the Rector's
  return.</p>

  <p>For he was positive that his famished curiosity was going to have a feast,
  and that&mdash;for the first time in the history of the village&mdash;there
  would be no clean pillow-slips.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04"></a>IV. &mdash; ANONYMOUS</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN the golden diamonds gleamed through the windowpanes of
  Miss Asprey's dining-room, she was seated at her evening meal, with her
  companion, little Miss Mack, and quite unconscious that, across an empty
  stretch of grass, two men were discussing her character.</p>

  <p>As she sat in a high-backed carven chair, and mechanically ate what the
  parlourmaid had piled upon her plate, she seemed unaware of her surroundings,
  for she stared at the opposite wall, as though trying to pierce it with the
  intensity of her vision.</p>

  <p>In the early sixties, she was slender and upright as a girl. Her face bore
  traces of former beauty, in spite of many lines, and a sharpening of nose and
  chin&mdash;forerunner of the fatal nutcracker. The tint of her complexion was
  pale ivory, and her expression both pure and austere. She wore a black velvet
  dinner gown, which suited the silver glory of her hair so well as to suggest
  that even saints have their share of vanity.</p>

  <p>Although she looked so fragile, her appetite was enormous, but she
  appeared to eat without enjoyment&mdash;rather like a machine crushing fodder
  which was necessary for the repair of a body worn out by a consuming
  flame-like spirit. Not only was she a woman of tireless energy, broken by
  lapses into fierce concentrated meditation, but she adhered to the habits of
  her early life.</p>

  <p>The only child of wealthy parents, Decima Asprey had been at the same
  school in Germany as Miss Julia Corner; but she was much older than the
  novelist, and had left to be presented at Court. After one Season only, she
  grew tired of leading the life of an average Society girl, and went into
  Retreat, with the idea of becoming a nun. Commonsense prevailed, however, so
  that she chose a career better suited to her temperament, becoming Matron of
  a Home for Fallen Women, in a large industrial city.</p>

  <p>She did not spare herself in well-doing, and&mdash;like the
  Rector&mdash;she overworked and finally broke down. While she was only in the
  early thirties, she came to the village to recuperate, and stayed there for
  nearly thirty years. The Elizabethan mansion&mdash;Spout Manor&mdash;was then
  in the market, and after she had bought it she never slept under another
  roof, in contrast to Queen Elizabeth I's alleged habit for trying strange
  beds.</p>

  <p>Very soon her gently dominant character asserted itself, and she became
  ruler of the village. Mr. Sheriff&mdash;as head of the oldest
  family&mdash;held the prestige of Squire; the Scudamores were self-appointed
  guardians of the public tone; but above them all, shone Miss Decima
  Asprey.</p>

  <p>She sat at the head of the long dining-table, and the gaunt Rose waited on
  her assiduously, while little Miss Mack 'made a long arm', and helped
  herself. She was a stocky little woman, about twenty-five years younger than
  her employer, with a pale, clear, polished complexion, like a china doll's,
  light blue eyes, and faintly smiling lips. She looked rather stupid, through
  over-amiability, but serene and good.</p>

  <p>Upstairs, in her bedroom, a half-finished letter lay inside her blotter.
  It was addressed to a certain Miss Smith, of London, and was filled with
  praise of Miss Asprey, and contentment with her happy lot.</p>

  <p>'Miss Asprey is an Earthly Angel,' she had written. 'She took me in, when
  I was down and out, and I feel I can never do enough to repay her. She is so
  very kind and good, and gives me light work, which makes the time pass
  quickly and pleasantly. I look and feel much better. I am only living <i>to
  repay her for what she has done to me</i>. This house is beautiful, all wood,
  and everyone says it is like a Museum.'</p>

  <p>Now this was rather noble of little Miss Mack, for 'the Spout' was not at
  all to her personal taste. She preferred rose-pink wall-paper,
  electric-light, and a nice clean white tablecloth. Visitors might praise the
  historic perfection of the Tudor mansion, and rave over its furniture, which
  were all genuine period pieces; but they sat, for a short time only, on its
  hard oaken chairs, and then rolled away, on cushioned seats, back into the
  Twentieth Century.</p>

  <p>As she munched her bread-and-cheese Miss Mack's china-blue eyes roamed
  about the room, semi-lit by one hanging oil-lamp. The panelled
  walls&mdash;black with age&mdash;were rendered invisible by the shadows. The
  oaken table was bare, save for some mats of coarse hand-woven linen. The food
  was chiefly vegetarian&mdash;lentil-soup, salad, biscuits, butter, cheese and
  fruit. There was only barley-water to drink, although the temperature
  remained low at 'the Spout'.</p>

  <p>Miss Mack looked distrustfully at the dish of green-stuff, for she did not
  like raw lettuce, which did not satisfy her appetite, and only gave her
  flatulence.</p>

  <p>'If you're lucky, you get a rumble,' she thought. 'If you're unlucky, you
  get a slug.'</p>

  <p>Then she remembered the beautiful food she had once enjoyed, when she
  stayed with a farmer uncle in the country. When they killed a pig, there was
  a feast of good things&mdash;faggots, brawn, chitterlings, and a delicious
  dish, called 'Black pudding'. She had been told that it was made from the
  blood of pigs&mdash;but that did not alter the fact that it was both filling
  and savoury.</p>

  <p>In the distance, she could hear the postman's double-knock, but without
  interest, for few people wrote to the insignificant Miss Mack. Then her
  watchful eyes noticed that her idol, Miss Asprey, gave a slight shiver, and,
  instantly, she was on her stumpy feet, ready for service.</p>

  <p>"May I fetch you a shawl, Miss Asprey?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you." Miss Asprey rose and walked to the door, followed by Miss
  Mack, whom she waved back to her chair. "Please sit down and finish your
  meal," she commanded.</p>

  <p>When the door was closed behind her, Miss Mack spoke to Rose.</p>

  <p>"What are you having for supper, in the kitchen?"</p>

  <p>"Poached eggs and cocoa," was the reply.</p>

  <p>Miss Mack smacked her lips.</p>

  <p>"It's cold, this evening," she remarked. "And it smells dampish."</p>

  <p>"That's the water," Rose told her. "The mistress told me that, in the old
  days, this was a farm, with a real water-spout. You may depend on it, the
  water is still hiding itself, somewhere. Water never goes."</p>

  <p>She snapped her lips together and stood at attention, as Miss Asprey
  returned.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mack," she asked, "did you empty my waste-paper basket, today?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss Asprey," replied Miss Mack, with conscious virtue. "I gave the
  bits to Ada, and she burned them with the other rubbish, in the garden
  incinerator."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey nodded without comment, and relapsed into silence. As the
  postman's knock sounded louder, Miss Mack took her courage in both hands.</p>

  <p>"Miss Asprey, I wonder if I may have porridge for supper, please?"</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey raised her brows in surprise, and waved her white hand over
  the salad.</p>

  <p>"This is better for you. It supplies the Vitamin C which is necessary to
  your diet."</p>

  <p>"Porridge is more filling, Miss Asprey."</p>

  <p>"But you are getting too stout. Do you weigh, every morning, after your
  bath?"</p>

  <p>Miss Mack blinked at the unexpected question. The bathroom was a primitive
  cell, and, as there was no gas on the premises, the hot-water supply was
  dependent on the kitchen fire, plus a defective system of pipes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss Asprey," said Miss Mack untruthfully, for she dared not confess
  that she bathed only on Saturday night, when the cook was out, so that she
  could stoke up the stove herself. "And, if you please, may I have porridge
  for my supper? It's quite cheap."</p>

  <p>"If you really wish it, of course. And it's not a question of expense, but
  of your own good." Miss Asprey's voice was astringent, but her companion's
  china-blue eyes were serene.</p>

  <p>'I'll ask for poached eggs, next,' she decided. 'And, after that,
  something that's really tasty.'</p>

  <p>The postman's knock shook the house, and Rose stalked from the room. She
  returned, a minute later, with a letter on a pewter salver, which she offered
  to Miss Asprey.</p>

  <p>Miss Mack was still dreaming of savoury pudding,
  made&mdash;perhaps&mdash;with blood, so that she was not watching Miss Asprey
  with her usual dog-like fidelity. But, at the sound of a sharply-drawn
  breath, she looked up, to see Miss Asprey staring at an open letter.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that she was upset, for she waited to regain complete
  self-control before she spoke to the parlourmaid.</p>

  <p>"Rose, go to the Rectory and tell the Rector I wish to see him
  immediately, please." Then she turned to Miss Mack with another request.
  "When the Rector comes, bring him to me, in the parlour, please."</p>

  <p>Miss Mack obediently left her unfinished supper and waited in the dark
  porch, like a patient sentinel. When the Rector's huge figure loomed through
  the twilight, he was several paces in front of Rose, although that
  well-trained person was marching at the double.</p>

  <p>As the Rector looked down into the perpetually smiling face of the little
  woman, she delivered her employer's message.</p>

  <p>"Miss Asprey's expecting you in the parlour."</p>

  <p>Like a cyclone, the Rector whirled into the living-room, which, like the
  dining-room, was panelled and dimly-lit. There were violet window-curtains, a
  few books and a bowl of white lilac&mdash;but not a single cushion, rug, or
  newspaper. Miss Asprey was seated on an oaken settle, with a high back; and,
  as he entered, the Rector received his impression of her as one whose heart
  had never been warmed at the fires of Life.</p>

  <p>To his mind, she seemed to have withdrawn from grosser contact into the
  purity of her own soul. His surprise and shock was therefore the greater,
  when she spoke to him, without any greeting.</p>

  <p>"I sent for you, Rector, because I have just received an anonymous letter.
  It is an attack on my moral character. Will you read it, please?"</p>

  <p>He stared at her with incredulous horror, for once, at a loss for
  words.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;it's <i>impossible</i>," he said, at last.</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey held out the letter, with fingers which trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>"Read it," she repeated.</p>

  <p>To his eternal credit&mdash;for he was consumed by curiosity&mdash;the
  Rector refused.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "You may wish me to read it tonight, but you'll probably
  think differently, tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey shook her gleaming silver head.</p>

  <p>"I've nothing to fear from tomorrow, and I fear no one," she told him.
  "But, after reading this, perhaps, I fear myself. It fills me with
  doubts&mdash;makes me wonder if I know my own heart&mdash;as it really is. If
  I were a Roman Catholic, I should unburden myself in the Confessional. As it
  is, I have no other course but to ask you to read this letter, and
  then&mdash;if you can&mdash;grant me Absolution."</p>

  <p>"If that is really your wish, then I'll read it."</p>

  <p>Having made his protest, the Rector picked up the letter briskly. It was
  printed, in block letters, on paper of excellent quality, and was correctly
  composed and spelt. It began with I the sentence&mdash;'You presumed to sit
  in judgment on unfortunate women whom you dragged out of the gutter, probably
  against their own wish, but are you, yourself better than the lowest of
  these?' It continued in the same strain, each line covered with the slime of
  insinuation, as though a slug had crawled over the pages.</p>

  <p>The Rector exploded several times as he read it, and, at the end, he
  crushed it up angrily between his strong fingers and threw it on the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"<i>Foul</i>," he declared. "Any anonymous letter is a knife in the back,
  but this one is specially outrageous...Can you tell me, Miss Asprey, if you
  have any&mdash;any suspicions as to the writer?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Miss Asprey. "Besides, the writer does not matter. I only
  want to know what <i>you</i> think of me."</p>

  <p>True to his impulsive nature, the Rector acted without forethought. On
  this occasion, his muscles leaped to obey his instinct, before his mind
  creaked into motion, so that he was betrayed into a theatrical gesture.
  Stooping down, he kissed Miss Asprey's thin white hand, in silent homage.</p>

  <p>Before he could feel ashamed, he was rewarded by the glitter of suppressed
  tears in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"That's what I think," he told her. "But I also think that some
  evil-minded person is jealous of you."</p>

  <p>As the door creaked slightly he looked up sharply, and then picked up the
  letter. Presently he glanced towards Miss Mack, who sat, watchfully, in the
  shadow of the wall, and pounced on her with a question.</p>

  <p>"How do you spell 'judgment,' Miss Mack?"</p>

  <p>As he had expected, she spelt it, 'judgement'.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," he muttered. "Thank you." He turned to Miss Asprey. "This
  letter has been written by an educated person. Now, what, exactly, is your
  wish? Shall I try to trace it back to its source?"</p>

  <p>"But can you do that? It is anonymous."</p>

  <p>"I haven't the foggiest idea. But I have a friend&mdash;a chap with
  nothing to do, who's potty on puzzles. He'd enjoy getting his teeth into
  it."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey's answer was to replace the letter on the salver, and to apply
  a lighted match to one corner.</p>

  <p>"That is what I'm going to do with the letter," she said. "My mind is now
  completely at rest again."</p>

  <p>As she watched the paper blaze and then crumble into dust, her expression
  grew tranquil and the strain faded from her eyes.</p>

  <p>But the Rector was suddenly rent with a vague foreboding of future evil.
  Acting on impulse, he picked up the envelope, which had begun to catch fire,
  and pinched out the charred patch.</p>

  <p>"May I keep this?" he asked. "It may come in useful, supposing there's
  another letter."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey hesitated and then bowed her stately head.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," she said. "But I am confident the matter is ended...Thank you
  for coming. Good night."</p>

  <p>Miss Mack pattered across to the door, which she opened, to make the
  Rector understand that he was dismissed. He lingered, as he wondered whether
  he should try to repeat his success, and kiss the hand of the afflicted lady
  in farewell. But she seemed to have forgotten his existence, so he followed
  Miss Mack's hint, and left.</p>

  <p>He carried away with him a memory of Miss Asprey's face glimmering whitely
  against the dark wood, as though she were already enshrined, and fading away
  to the bleak immortality of a saint.</p>

  <p>He walked slowly back to the Rectory, in a depressed mood, and horrified
  at the mere idea that his perfect village sheltered a poisonous mind. But as
  he passed each person of the limited social circle in review, he was able to
  shake his head and brace his shoulders, as though he had shaken off a
  load.</p>

  <p>No one he knew could have done this thing. To his mind, it was obvious
  that this letter had been written by some unbalanced person who had known
  Miss Asprey in the past, and who bore her a grudge. The fact that the
  envelope was stamped with the village post-mark was of small importance, as
  this subterfuge could be arranged.</p>

  <p>When he entered his cheerful study, the whisky was on the table and the
  Wireless turned on. The essential parts of a fat spaniel&mdash;named
  'Charles', after Dickens&mdash;were crowded on the doctor's lap, while the
  dog, from his intelligent look, was helping their guest to solve a
  chess-problem in the evening paper.</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Dr. Perry eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Well," echoed the Rector, crossing to the table and juggling hospitably
  with the various bottles. "Soda or plain water, doctor? Say 'when'."</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry bit his lip and pulled Charles' silky ears for moral support,
  before he repeated his question.</p>

  <p>"Well? Was it so important?"</p>

  <p>The Rector laughed as he hunted in a cupboard for the biscuit-barrel.</p>

  <p>"It was nothing," he said. "She was just a bit upset. That's all."</p>

  <p>"I see," said the doctor quietly. "That's all." He took his glass.
  "Thanks. <i>Prosit</i>."</p>

  <p>The Rector felt sorry for his baffled curiosity, but he was guarding the
  secret of the Confessional. He turned to his dog, who was registering all the
  symptoms of acute starvation at the sight of the biscuits.</p>

  <p>"Here you are, Charles," he said, tossing him a cracknel. "You're an
  overfed scoundrel, but you know your poor fish of a master can't resist a
  moist nose and swimmy eyes. But it's no good our friend the doctor looking
  pathetic, is it, Charles? We've nothing for him. By the way, doctor, please
  don't mention the fact that Miss Asprey sent over for me this evening."</p>

  <p>"I quite understand." Dr. Perry laughed acidly. "You're giving me my own
  medicine&mdash;'Shall a doctor tell?'...My dear padre, not for worlds would I
  wish you to betray a confidence. There is no one I respect more than Miss
  Asprey, although there are many I like better. I am sorry she has suffered
  annoyance."</p>

  <p>"How do you know she has?" asked the Rector.</p>

  <p>"I don't, so, naturally, my mind is busy with every absurd
  impossibility...Well, I suppose I must go home and see if I still have the
  same wife."</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry glanced at the clock, tossed off his whisky, and rose to go.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, padre," he said, patting Charles' head. "I admire you for your
  admirable policy of silence, and I bear you no ill-will."</p>

  <p>The Rector's jaw dropped in surprise as the doctor added, "But I confess I
  should have liked your account of how the saintly Miss Asprey defended her
  honour."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05"></a>V. &mdash; ENTER FEAR</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Miss Asprey declared that the affair was ended she did
  not know that the parlourmaid was listening outside the door. Rose lingered
  in the hall, not only to satisfy her own curiosity, but to be forewarned of
  any annoyance which might threaten her mistress.</p>

  <p>She possessed a testimonial from a Bishop's wife to prove her loyalty and
  discretion, and she did not repeat an actual word of what she overheard.
  But&mdash;like an unconscious germ-carrier&mdash;she liberated the poison in
  her system by gradual leakage. Somehow or other, she conveyed an impression
  to the cook, who transferred it to the beautiful Ada, in the form of a hint.
  Ada promptly elaborated this to a whisper, and then passed it on to the
  Squire's chauffeur.</p>

  <p>Within twenty-four hours, through the Wireless of village communication,
  the rumour spread that Miss Asprey's moral character had been attacked in an
  anonymous letter from an evil-minded person, who was jealous of her.</p>

  <p>Miss Corner was sitting cross-legged in her library, smoking and reading,
  when her cook-housekeeper told her about the letter. The novelist was on
  friendly terms with her staff, as she studied their comfort; in fact, it was
  rather a local grievance that their bathroom was far superior to Miss
  Asprey's.</p>

  <p>The housekeeper's story fell rather flat, for Miss Corner was still
  bewitched by Edith Sitwell's <i>Bath</i>. She might sell cheap home-brew
  herself, with her insipid romances and absurd school-stories, but she could
  appreciate rare vintage&mdash;and her library-shelves testified to selective
  literary taste.</p>

  <p>She puffed away grimly at her cigarette, as she mechanically listened to
  the tale, while the shrunken pupils of her eyes betrayed the fact that she
  was still marooned in the Eighteenth Century, and half-drunken from the
  savour of exquisite language.</p>

  <p>'Russets, shalloons, rateens and salapeens.' The sentence swam through her
  brain, like an elusive gust of mignonette borne on a vanished summer
  breeze.</p>

  <p>Her housekeeper&mdash;Mrs. Pike&mdash;became conscious that her story had
  fallen unaccountably flat, and began to apologise for it.</p>

  <p>"Of course, madam, we don't know all that was in the letter. Depend on it,
  we've only been told the half."</p>

  <p>"In every story," remarked Miss Corner, "there's the half we tell, and the
  half that others tell, and the half that's true. Add that up, Mrs. Pike, and
  see what it comes to."</p>

  <p>Then, taking pity on the woman's bewilderment, she changed the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"I'm throwing a little bun-fight this afternoon," she said. "You must
  provide a lavish tea, for the look of the thing, for it'll all be left. I'm
  expecting Mrs. Sheriff, Mrs. Scudamore, and Lady d'Arcy."</p>

  <p>"Well, you'll have something to talk about, for a change," remarked Mrs.
  Pike, as she produced her housekeeping-tablet.</p>

  <p>As a matter-of-fact, the incident of the anonymous letter only seemed to
  prove that the life-blood of the little community was too healthy to admit
  infection. It was received either with raised brows of polite incredulity, or
  with gusts of healing laughter. Yet, even at this early stage, certain events
  indicated that the village was not immune to poison, but only resistant.</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry was motoring out to visit a country patient, when, at the
  cross-roads, he met Vivian Sheriff&mdash;the Squire's daughter&mdash;who was
  also driving a Baby Austin. They were not especially friendly, but their cars
  always insisted on stopping to fraternise with each other, so their owners
  had to make the best of it.</p>

  <p>"I'm just cooling my engine," explained the doctor hastily. "We've been
  exceeding the speed-limit. How's <i>your</i> little car behaving?"</p>

  <p>"Never better," boasted Vivian. "But my petrol's rather low." Then, as
  though dimly conscious that she was clutched in the grip of machinery, and
  had to await its Robot pleasure, she began to gossip.</p>

  <p>"Heard about Miss Asprey's anonymous letter?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The doctor had not heard; but, as he listened to Vivian, his eyes gleamed
  with interest, which gave way to resentment. This, then, was the origin of
  the Rector's secret mission. He, himself, had been present at the birth of an
  intriguing human development, and had been shut out in the cold.</p>

  <p>But the Rector, apparently, had lost no time in spreading the story. In
  the doctor's eyes his admirable policy of silence was now revealed as pure
  pose.</p>

  <p>'The fellow's nothing but a human gramophone,' he thought contemptuously,
  as the cars grew suddenly tired of each other and agreed to start.</p>

  <p>An hour later, when Dr. Perry met the Rector trudging along the road with
  his fishing-tackle his greeting was rather cool. He still felt slightly
  disgusted, while the Rector was horrified by his own unworthy suspicion, as
  Dr. Perry's parting remark kept stirring in his mind. <i>How did the doctor
  know that the letter attacked Miss Asprey's moral character?</i></p>

  <p>Both men talked of fly-fishing, but did not refer to the letter. The
  doctor offered the Rector a lift, which was refused. A little of the poison
  had spread.</p>

  <p>The subject was also raised at the Hall, where Lady d'Arcy was having
  lunch with the Squire's family. Mrs. Sheriff, who was a youthful,
  flaxen-haired little person&mdash;rather gummy, but with a sweet and
  self-sacrificing disposition&mdash;was human enough to be mildly excited.</p>

  <p>"I wonder who wrote it," she exclaimed, with school-girlish interest.</p>

  <p>Her husband pulled down his lip, and the vague Lady d'Arcy drifted up to
  the occasion, for the Rector had made no idle boast that the village was
  almost free from the vice of scandal.</p>

  <p>"Not one of <i>us</i>," said Lady d'Arcy, in her lightest voice and
  changed the subject.</p>

  <p>Her speech sounded above reproach, but the Squire frowned, pulled his lip
  again, and grew thoughtful. The village accepted no one who had not been a
  resident for fifteen years. Companions and governesses did not count, of
  course, while Mrs. Perry crept in under her husband's wing.</p>

  <p>There remained only the Martins&mdash;the rich absentee owners of the
  Towers&mdash;and the local novelist.</p>

  <p>Miss Julia Corner had entirely returned from Bath, and was her usual
  genial self when she acted as hostess at her tea-party. She wore a white
  muslin peasant blouse, with juvenile short sleeves and a round neck. A string
  of corals encircled her fat neck and her grey fringe was freshly-cut. She
  flourished her tea-pot dangerously as she beamed upon her guests, who were of
  the younger generation.</p>

  <p>Owing to some curious run of bad-luck, both the Squire's wife and Lady
  d'Arcy had sent deputies. Kind little Mrs. Sheriff&mdash;when she pleaded a
  racking headache&mdash;had rebelled against her husband, and insisted that
  Vivian should take her place. The vague Lady d'Arcy, who was sufficiently
  practical to make use of others&mdash;merely told Joan to offer her
  apologies.</p>

  <p>Joan's inventive powers proved equal to the strain, and she was only too
  glad to stay, for, although she had acquired a certain respect for Art, in
  Chelsea, she was a backslider where Miss Corner's comfortable home was
  concerned.</p>

  <p>It had its own electric-plant, so that the novelist was able to indulge
  her passion for brilliant lighting, and it possessed a perfect system of
  central-heating. In spite of the scraps of Fourteenth-century barns which
  composed its outer walls, its interior was entirely modern, with built-in
  drawers and cupboards, amusing metal furniture, aluminium-sprayed rubber
  curtains and planet-lamps. In the place of pictures, there were numerous
  mirrors.</p>

  <p>"I like to see a lot of Julias," explained Miss Corner. "Those fat girls
  are my company. You've heard, haven't you, how a fat girl can love, even if
  no one loves her?"</p>

  <p>Vivian's smile was polite and non-committal, for she was not feeling
  entirely at her ease. She was a pretty girl&mdash;fair-haired and
  turquoise-eyed&mdash;with exquisite colouring. Like most of the local ladies,
  she had the delicate air of one reared entirely under glass, so that, in
  comparison with her, Joan looked like a rosy apple placed beside a hot-house
  peach.</p>

  <p>They appeared to be the same age, although, in reality Vivian possessed
  only the sterilised youth of the village.</p>

  <p>She raised her gossamer brows when Joan began to talk about the anonymous
  letter.</p>

  <p>"What do <i>you</i> think about it, Miss Corner?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Thrilled," replied the novelist. "It's been said that the anonymous
  letter-writer is the only really interesting criminal."</p>

  <p>"I think it's disgusting," said Vivian. "And to send it to Miss
  Asprey&mdash;of all people."</p>

  <p>"Why should she be exempt?" demanded Miss Corner. "She's not sacred, is
  she?"</p>

  <p>"No. But she's so&mdash;so spiritual. I've rather a passion for her. I
  think she must have an aura&mdash;a blue or violet one. Anyway, I'm sure
  she's an influence for good. Whenever I am at 'The Spout', I'm conscious of
  being in a state of perfect peace."</p>

  <p>As it was difficult to connect Vivian with any emotion, neither Joan or
  Miss Corner were impressed.</p>

  <p>"You're lucky," declared the novelist. "I wish I could say the same. She
  always seems to drain my brain dry of ideas, and she makes me feel like a wet
  rag. In fact, when I'm in process of literary gestation I don't dare go near
  her barn."</p>

  <p>"Barn?" echoed Vivian reproachfully. "Miss Asprey's house and furniture
  are perfect Tudor period."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I don't sit down in the Sixteenth Century. It's true that Nature
  has thoughtfully provided me with padding&mdash;but it's not fair to count on
  guests bringing their own cushions...But Miss Brook has nothing to eat."</p>

  <p>Miss Corner broke off to offer Joan a selection of cakes.</p>

  <p>"Those flaky things are dee-licious," she said, "but they're not safe to
  be let loose without a plate. They're the underhand kind that spit cream in
  your eye. Here you are, my dear&mdash;plate and nappy. I'm not one of your
  Society sadists, who tempt pure young girls to eat oranges in public...Hum.
  Mrs. Scudamore's late."</p>

  <p>The novelist glanced at the clock and poured herself another cup of tea,
  while her eyes grew speculative, with pin-prick pupils.</p>

  <p>"Let's get back to Miss Asprey," she said. "Have you noticed that though
  she looks as if a puff of air would blow her away, she's unusually strong.
  And her brain still bites like a badger...Sometimes, I wonder if she draws
  her reserves from others, now that she's growing old. When I first came here
  I wasn't conscious of being affected by her, and it's odd the way her powers
  don't seem to fail with age. You know, my dears, there <i>are</i> people who
  sap your vitality."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;human vampires?" Vivian's flower-like face grew pink. "But
  that's a <i>terrible</i> thing to say of Miss Asprey."</p>

  <p>Joan hastened to change the subject.</p>

  <p>"I wonder you don't keep a pet, Miss Corner," she said. "Cats and dogs are
  better company than looking-glasses."</p>

  <p>"I'd love to," replied the novelist wistfully. "But&mdash;I'm alone."</p>

  <p>"That's what I meant."</p>

  <p>"And that's what I meant, too. If anything happened to me, what about
  them? I'm too fond of animals to risk them."</p>

  <p>Joan missed the hint of tragedy which clouded the novelist's eyes, for she
  was looking at the inch of Oxford-blue ribbon on Miss Corner's broad white
  chest.</p>

  <p>"Is that your Temperance badge?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the novelist. "That is to show I drink nothing&mdash;in
  public."</p>

  <p>Joan laughed with her hostess, because she remembered her friend's
  ridiculous serial.</p>

  <p>"I think Miss Asprey's letter is nothing but a silly practical joke," she
  declared. "And if the joker follows it with a second, <i>you</i> will,
  probably, be accused of being a secret drinker."</p>

  <p>"But I <i>am</i>," grinned Miss Corner. "Only, no one in the village
  possesses any sense of humour, except the doctor."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Perry?" cried Vivian incredulously. "He's always so quiet."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. Beware the dog that doesn't bark. Did you know he has a secret
  passion for <i>me?</i> There <i>is</i> someone who loves a fat girl...This is
  our guilty signal."</p>

  <p>She picked up an empty black-and-gilt tea-cup, and, crossing to one of the
  small windows, balanced it on top of the open casement.</p>

  <p>With the insolence of youth, Joan thought she was rather pathetic. And the
  novelist, from her safe vantage of experience, pitied Joan. 'No beauty, no
  money, no talent,' she reflected. 'If she grabs the parson, her market's
  made. If she doesn't, Heaven help her.'</p>

  <p>She looked up with her usual beam of welcome, as her loyal, stupid
  maid&mdash;May&mdash;announced Mrs. Scudamore.</p>

  <p>The important lady made her usual gracious entrance and created her
  special impression. She was wearing a last year's gown and coatee, of grey
  lace, and appeared, definitely, a middle-aged English-woman, of the type that
  is accepted as representative, on the Continent.</p>

  <p>Her good features were just a shade too large; she displayed too much
  hair, and not enough style.</p>

  <p>But everyone paid instinctive homage to the Spirit of the Village. Joan,
  who was lounging back in her chair, with outstretched feet, drew herself
  upright. Vivian looked relieved, as though welcoming moral support, while
  Miss Corner whispered to May, 'Fresh tea-pot.'</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore was very gracious to everyone. Presently, when she was
  sipping tea and subduing one of the treacherous cakes&mdash;after having
  declined a plate&mdash;she spoke, smilingly, to Joan.</p>

  <p>"What were you laughing about when I came in? You sounded very merry."</p>

  <p>"I expect we were talking about Miss Asprey's anonymous letter," replied
  Joan.</p>

  <p>"An anonymous letter? <i>Here?</i>...Oh dear."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore gave a faint scream. She&mdash;the exponent of perfect
  manners&mdash;had committed the unpardonable breach of spilling her tea. It
  was a complete catastrophe, for she dropped both the cup and saucer, smashing
  the china and drenching the beautiful gold-and-blue Persian carpet.</p>

  <p>Miss Corner was entirely kind, and hid her natural feelings under a cover
  of good-natured laughter. Presently, when the mopping operations were over,
  Mrs. Scudamore recovered her poise and asked for further details about Miss
  Asprey's letter.</p>

  <p>"How very unpleasant," she remarked. "It betrays an odious mind. But it is
  really too absurd. A charge of immorality against Miss Asprey&mdash;of all
  people. And at <i>her</i> age."</p>

  <p>"Age has nothing to do with it," shouted Miss Corner. "I'm fifty-five, and
  I'd do <i>anything</i> for the sake of literary experience."</p>

  <p>Joan saw the swift, involuntary glance which flashed between Mrs.
  Scudamore and Vivian.</p>

  <p>'I <i>wish</i> you hadn't said that,' she thought.</p>

  <p>Unaware of any need of caution, Miss Corner went from bad to worse.</p>

  <p>"I simply can't understand all this silly worship of Miss Asprey," she
  said. "You see, <i>I</i> went to school with her. Of course, I was much
  younger, for she's sixty-four. But, even then, I was a little novelist, only
  my books were more mature than <i>The Young Visitor</i>. Decima was one of
  the big girls, with long, fair pigtails&mdash;but <i>I</i> took her measure,
  all right."</p>

  <p>"Fair plaits. She must have looked like Marguerite," murmured Vivian.</p>

  <p>"Marguerite, without the guts to go to hell. And I don't see she's made a
  success of her life. She chucked her job when she was still a young woman.
  After all, I've stuck to mine."</p>

  <p>Annoyed by the lack of response from her guests&mdash;for even Joan looked
  thoughtful&mdash;Miss Corner began to brag.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I'm too proud about my work, but I've given&mdash;and I still
  give&mdash;a lot of happiness. All she did was to drag miserable girls into
  her Hostels, cram them with thick bread-and-butter, and set them to scrub
  floors and sing hymns."</p>

  <p>She flashed her glasses aggressively at her guests.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose anyone has any notion of my huge fan-mail," she boasted.
  "Little boys&mdash;I love boys&mdash;write to me, begging for another of
  Joey's adventures. 'Dearest Miss Corner, I can hardly bear to wait for the
  next instalment. You don't know how thrilled I am by naughty Sam.' Or,
  'Please, <i>please</i>, dear Miss Corner, tell me some more about Jimmy. I
  just adore him.' That's my reward, and please Heaven, <i>I</i>'ll die in
  harness."</p>

  <p>Joan thought that the letters sounded more like the effusions of little
  girls, and felt guilty of disloyalty, when&mdash;at the hoot of a
  motor-horn&mdash;Miss Corner gave her a conspiratorial wink. Unabashed by
  Mrs. Scudamore's surprised expression, she crossed to the window and removed
  the signal.</p>

  <p>Two minutes later, when Dr. Perry entered the room, his hostess received
  him with a brimming cup.</p>

  <p>"Here's your rotten weak China," she said. "Never mind. If I'm spared,
  I'll yet turn you into a strong Indian."</p>

  <p>The doctor looked intently at Miss Corner, before he seated himself beside
  Joan, to the girl's secret satisfaction. Although she had chosen the Rector
  for her own, she considered Dr. Perry the most interesting man in the
  village. While there seemed nothing special in him to understand, she was
  aware that she did not understand him.</p>

  <p>"We've been talking about <i>it</i>," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"It?" He laughed slightly. "Oh, you mean the famous, or
  rather&mdash;infamous&mdash;letter...Who told you about it?"</p>

  <p>"The padre."</p>

  <p>"The padre, of course. The professional custodian of secrets. Ridiculous,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Joan noticed that he was only giving her a corner of his attention, for
  his eyes still lingered on Miss Corner. It was plain, from her understanding
  smile, that he was on terms of intimacy with the novelist. While Joan was
  sufficiently experienced to know that the laws of attraction are
  inexplicable, Miss Corner's grinning red face reminded her so strongly of the
  Leg of Mutton, in <i>Alice Through the Looking-Glass</i>, that she discarded
  the possibility of a romantic attachment for an uglier motive.</p>

  <p>'Miss Corner's a rich spinster,' she thought. 'Suppose he is ingratiating
  himself with her, to get her to leave him her money. Mercy. I'm as bad as old
  Purley.'</p>

  <p>But she knew that her friend would carry her lurid speculations a stage
  further, and she shuddered as her imagination suddenly shied at a gruesome
  reflection.</p>

  <p>'A gentle smiling poisoner.'</p>

  <p>She wrenched the idea from her mind.</p>

  <p>'I'm a horror,' she thought contritely. 'It's Purley's fault. She started
  it, and now suspicion seems in the air.'</p>

  <p>Restored to commonsense, she listened to Mrs. Scudamore, whose large, mild
  eyes were like searchlights, picking out the faces of her social disciples in
  order to secure their attention.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she hinted gently, "<i>I</i> shall not allude to the letter
  when I next meet Miss Asprey. My silence will assure her of my entire
  sympathy. But I should only insult her if I let her think that I'd given even
  a minute's thought to such a wicked and ridiculous slander."</p>

  <p>Her reassuring smile was the unspoken rider to her little speech. 'Now,
  you all know how to behave.'</p>

  <p>"Yes." Vivian's fair face flushed, and she spoke too quickly. "Shall we
  all promise, that, <i>whatever we may hear about each other</i>, we won't
  believe it?"</p>

  <p>At the unguarded request, everyone stared at her, aghast, for her words
  seemed to hint at the actual existence of secret swamps. In the silence that
  followed a dark flicker shook through the room.</p>

  <p>It was the first warning of the approach of Fear.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06"></a>VI. &mdash; A COUNTRY WALK</h2>

  <p class="first">THE next day was sultry, with blazing sunshine and a
  cloudless sky. Hot weather always filled Joan with extra energy, so that
  after she had safely settled Lady d'Arcy for the afternoon, she determined to
  walk to the top of the Downs, to get a breeze.</p>

  <p>When she came out of the tenebrous Quakers' Walk, the thatched cottages of
  the village looked like golden bee-hives, and the old pump seemed to nod in
  the drowsy heat. Everyone seemed to be under the spell of the Sleeping
  Beauty, for Joan met no one in the cobbled street.</p>

  <p>When she passed the picturesque water-fed garden of Spout Manor, however,
  she saw Miss Mack looking through the gate. Her placid face and smiling lips
  gave her an appearance of complete happiness; but there was a suggestion of
  bars about the ironwork through which she peered, which made the little woman
  seem vaguely pathetic.</p>

  <p>"Hulloa," called Joan. "Glorious, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," smiled Miss Mack. "Are you going for a walk?"</p>

  <p>"Rather. Right to the top of the Downs."</p>

  <p>"How nice. I'd like to be a hiker&mdash;too."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;wear shorts and carry a rucksack?"</p>

  <p>Joan glanced at the squat little figure and stilled her heartless
  grin.</p>

  <p>"Where's Miss Asprey?" she asked, as she thought of the anonymous
  letter.</p>

  <p>"Gardening, over there."</p>

  <p>Miss Mack looked rather furtively to where a tall, thin form in a grey,
  knitted suit, stooped over a flower-border, in the distance. Then, as though
  eager to keep the girl a little longer, she touched Joan's safety-pin
  brooch.</p>

  <p>"That's pretty," she said. "But it's not properly fastened. You'll lose
  it."</p>

  <p>As her podgy fingers busied themselves with the pin, Joan&mdash;although
  not more tolerant of middle-aged society than the average girl&mdash;suddenly
  felt called upon to make a sacrifice.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you come with me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to," cried Miss Mack. "I've nothing to do for Miss Asprey."</p>

  <p>"Fine. Now, I've got to drop some mags at St. James's House. Get
  ready&mdash;strong shoes and a stick&mdash;and never mind about shorts. I'll
  come back in a few minutes and collect you."</p>

  <p>As the little woman pattered eagerly up the drive, Joan felt almost
  rewarded, even while she grumbled inwardly.</p>

  <p>"What a fool. Dished my whole afternoon."</p>

  <p>She carried a pile of magazines, which Dr. Perry had lent to his wealthy
  patient. Like most of the residents, Lady d'Arcy was meticulous in ordering
  only biographies and books of travel from her London Library; but she
  borrowed every novel and magazine that she saw in her friends' houses.</p>

  <p>As the gates clanged behind Joan, Marianne Perry sauntered across the
  daisied lawn to meet her. She wore a green pyjama-suit and looked as though
  the doctor had blacked both her eyes; yet she managed to preserve her odd
  attraction.</p>

  <p>"Oh, why did you fag with these?" she cried, as she took the magazines and
  threw them on the grass. "It's too marvellously hot."</p>

  <p>"You look cool, anyway," Joan told her.</p>

  <p>"Don't mention my pyjamas," implored Marianne. "They're my painful
  subject. When I first wore them I was fool enough to think I was going to
  shock the village; but Mrs. Scudamore merely said they were very decent and
  comfortable, if not exactly becoming."</p>

  <p>"Like her," nodded Joan. "She's always on guard against any charge of
  prudery. But she really is terribly sensible. Where are the babes?"</p>

  <p>"Having a sun-bath. Like to see my private Zoo? Can you stand indecent
  exposure?"</p>

  <p>Marianne sauntered across the lawn to a distant corner, where two naked
  infants, crowned with enormous coolie straw hats, were staggering around
  their play-pen. Her black-ringed eyes were almost ravenous with maternal
  passion, but she spoke with affected detachment.</p>

  <p>"Amusing brats, aren't they? Terribly out of proportion, although Micky's
  growing to his head and tummy."</p>

  <p>Then she clasped her slim waist.</p>

  <p>"I'm sun-bathing, too, for a cure," she explained. "I seem to have an
  everlasting pain. Nothing much, and the doctor will call it unripe
  fruit."</p>

  <p>"It sounds rather like a grumbling appendix," declared Joan with the swift
  and sure touch of unprofessional diagnosis.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," agreed Marianne. "I accuse my husband of experimental
  poisoning, but I can't get him to come clean."</p>

  <p>Although the words were intended for a joke, Joan did not feel amused.
  They seemed out of place on this day of burning summer, while the gracious
  Queen Anne house mellowed with the passing of yet another day, and babies
  gurgled and sprawled in the shade of pink horse-chestnuts.</p>

  <p>She felt slightly out of tune with the glory of the year, when she reached
  the gates of 'The Spout'. To her surprise, Miss Mack was not ready for the
  walk, although she was waiting on the drive. Ada&mdash;her red-gold hair
  burnished by sunlight&mdash;was cutting the grass, while Miss Asprey,
  complete with shady hat and walking-stick, stood by the gate.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you ready, Miss Mack?" asked Joan.</p>

  <p>"No. I'm sorry, but I'm too busy to come this afternoon," was the placid
  reply.</p>

  <p>"But I thought you said you had nothing to do," said Joan. Miss Asprey
  smiled in benign encouragement on her little companion.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mack forgot she has to address envelopes for a Charity Appeal," she
  explained. "You like doing them, don't you, my dear?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, I do," was the instant reply.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mack tells me you want company on your walk," went on Miss Asprey,
  turning to Joan. "If I can fill the gap, I shall be very glad."</p>

  <p>In spite of the rare fascination of her smile, Joan felt a prick of
  rebellion against the queen of the village.</p>

  <p>"That's terribly nice of you," she said, without enthusiasm. "But I wanted
  to get up on the Downs. Won't it be too much for you in this heat?"</p>

  <p>"I think not. Are you ready? Then shall we start?"</p>

  <p>Joan still felt antagonistic to Miss Asprey; but they had barely gone a
  dozen yards before an incident occurred which made her veer round like a
  weathercock.</p>

  <p>A little boy was dragging along a puppy, on a lead, with such careless
  jerks that a rare visitor stopped to reprove him. He merely stared at the
  stranger blankly, and pulled on the puppy again.</p>

  <p>It was then that Miss Asprey commanded the situation.</p>

  <p>"Bertie," she said, in her firm, pleasant voice, "you cannot keep that dog
  any longer without a licence. I promised I would buy one, if you were gentle
  with it. But, as you've been rough, it's going to be given to a kind little
  girl."</p>

  <p>At her imperious wave, Ada ran out of the garden and listened to her
  instructions. Picking up the puppy, she carried it back to 'The Spout',
  laughing and ducking her head as the dog tried to lick her face. Miss Asprey
  looked down at the boy's quivering lips.</p>

  <p>"Animals are not toys, Bertie," she said, "and you cannot treat them as
  such. But I am going to give you a toy dog, to teach you to be gentle with a
  real one, later on. I warn you that if you kick it, or throw it down, I shall
  take it away."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey walked away, having dispensed justice to the general
  happiness. Bertie was beaming with dumb pleasure, while Miss Mack waved a
  smiling farewell, from the gates. Ada made even the pup wag a paw to her
  mistress, and Joan repented her own disloyalty.</p>

  <p>'She's really kind' she thought, 'but she's not sloppy. After all, Miss
  Mack must have known about those envelopes. <i>I</i> should have to stay in,
  to get out an Appeal. After all, we're paid to do our jobs.'</p>

  <p>They soon passed through the sleepy village&mdash;gold-powdered, with
  dusty-blue shadows&mdash;and reached 'The King's Head', where the road looped
  to meet the highway to London. Here the rolling sea of green fields sloped,
  gently and imperceptibly, upwards to the low eminence of the Downs. Joan
  became conscious that she was leading, and fell back, with an apology.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry. I'm afraid I am walking too fast for you."</p>

  <p>"What is your usual pace?" asked Miss Asprey.</p>

  <p>"The usual four miles an hour."</p>

  <p>"The usual? Then I'm afraid I am a back-number. I follow the example of
  the Roman Legion. Their pace was three miles an hour, up hill and down dale,
  and they never hurried or slackened."</p>

  <p>"That's all right for me," said Joan virtuously, conscious of the
  obligation of youth towards age. "I'll be a Roman Legion, too, for the
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"May I keep you to that?" asked Miss Asprey. "I hate to preach, but I
  always think discipline is good for us all. Especially myself."</p>

  <p>Curbing her own impatience to push on towards the ridge of the Downs, Joan
  tried to surrender herself to the delights of the country. There was the hum
  of insects, the scent of hot grass, the singing of larks quivering in the
  blue air. Little yellow butterflies flitted across the path. The fields were
  ripe for hay, with coral and white flashes of sorrel and moon-daisies, and
  the hedges were laden with may, beginning to brown.</p>

  <p>But it seemed to Joan that something was lacking. "Mind if I smoke?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear child, why ask? You are your own mistress."</p>

  <p>Joan lit a cigarette, but Miss Asprey did not stop while she performed the
  usual business of shielding the flame. When the girl looked up, the grey
  figure was several paces ahead.</p>

  <p>'The Roman Legion's not exactly matey,' thought Joan.</p>

  <p>She smoked a couple of cigarettes, but the trend of the path was always
  upwards, and the sun blazed down fiercely on her uncovered head.</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind, I'll take off my shoes and stockings," she said.
  "Don't stop. I'll soon catch you up."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," agreed Miss Asprey, as she continued to walk.</p>

  <p>Joan did not find her plan the anticipated success, for the ground proved
  too bumpy and stubbed her toes. When she had put on her shoes and stockings
  again Miss Asprey's tall grey figure was some distance away.</p>

  <p>She enjoyed her run to catch up with her companion, for she worked off
  some of her steam of suppressed irritation; but the uphill sprint winded her,
  so that she was forced to appeal to the inexorable grey back.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind&mdash;stopping for me to&mdash;get my breath?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," was the gentle reply. "I'm sorry. But I thought you were a
  Roman legionary."</p>

  <p>There was a flicker of mockery in her smile which put Joan on her mettle.
  She walked on instantly, without stopping to rest. But the ridge appeared as
  far off as before&mdash;a thin green line against the fierce blue sky.</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey seemed unaffected either by heat or exertion. It was obvious
  that she was trying to find subjects which would interest Joan, for she broke
  off a lucid analysis of the International Debt problem, to talk about Swiss
  winter resorts. It was with mingled envy and surprise that Joan noticed that
  while she, herself, occasionally gasped for breath, Miss Asprey's voice was
  entirely under control.</p>

  <p>'Is she trying to rub it in that I'm one of the rotten younger
  generation?' she thought. 'If so, I'll take her on, and walk her to a
  finish.'</p>

  <p>She made a spectacular spurt, but Miss Asprey continued to walk at her
  usual pace, and Joan fell back again. In order to take her thoughts off her
  growing discomfort, she tried to lead the conversation to a subject of more
  human interest.</p>

  <p>"I suppose your Rescue Work was frightfully interesting," she said.</p>

  <p>"Frightfully," agreed Miss Asprey.</p>

  <p>"Did you get many failures?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But one success redeemed fifty failures."</p>

  <p>"Were the girls grateful?"</p>

  <p>"We didn't expect gratitude."</p>

  <p>Joan mopped her face and glanced at Miss Asprey. 'She's walking like a
  machine,' she thought. 'She's only a Robot.'</p>

  <p>Some of her annoyance betrayed itself in her next sentence.</p>

  <p>"Personally, I've a lot of sympathy with those wretched girls. It seems to
  me pretty damnable to dress them in hideous uniforms and set them to wash
  other people's pretty things."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey turned her silver head and regarded Joan with amused, tolerant
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you send your own lingerie to a laundry?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Joan. "I wash them, myself. But I'm a poor 'working
  goil'."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And rich women naturally expect their maids to do their private
  laundry. So, you see, our girls had not to undergo that special refined
  mental torture that you are inventing for them."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think me a fool," said Joan bluntly, as once again she was
  conscious that the village reservoir of cool commonsense was drawn through
  the channels of such antiseptic minds as Miss Asprey's and Mrs.
  Scudamore's.</p>

  <p>The ground now rose before them at a sharp gradient, so that she was
  forced to stop talking, in order to reserve herself for the last stiff pull.
  When she reached the summit she threw herself, panting, down on the short
  turf, while Miss Asprey looked at her with a smile of gentle compassion.</p>

  <p>"My dear child," she said, "why didn't you tell me you were exhausted? You
  should have rested."</p>

  <p>"I'm all right, thanks. I simply loved it," declared Joan.</p>

  <p>She shut her eyes and lay still, until Miss Asprey, who was standing like
  the statue of a saint erected to guard the encircling countryside, glanced at
  her watch.</p>

  <p>"Time to go back," she said. "We must adhere to the timetable of the Roman
  Legion."</p>

  <p>True to her declaration, she continued to walk at her three miles an hour,
  while Joan ran down the slopes with a sense of joyous freedom. It was good to
  feel that every step was taking her nearer home, for a walk in the company of
  a Roman legionary had proved only a penance. In the glow of her sudden
  warmth, she remembered poor little Miss Mack.</p>

  <p>"Miss Asprey," she said, "will you let Miss Mack come with me next
  time?"</p>

  <p>There was a perceptible pause before Miss Asprey spoke. Instead of
  replying to Joan's question, she, in her turn, asked another.</p>

  <p>"Have you taken any special liking to Miss Mack?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Joan. "But I feel there should be some common bond between
  us." She laughed lightly. "We're both upper servants. And I'm so lucky. Lady
  d'Arcy gives me such a lot of freedom."</p>

  <p>"So you contrast poor Miss Mack's lot with your own?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. I'm sure you're wonderfully good to her, too."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. Do you consider her unhappy?"</p>

  <p>Joan thought of Miss Mack's plump smiling face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," she cried.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad of that," said Miss Asprey quietly. "It would grieve me to think
  otherwise. And it would be a terrible reflection on myself...But I'm going to
  ask you not to invite her again to accompany you on any of your
  excursions...It's not good for her."</p>

  <p>Joan felt as though she'd received a slap in the face.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;but why?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Because," Miss Asprey's voice was like tinkling ice&mdash;"she is of a
  different disposition to yourself. I don't want her to be
  over-excited&mdash;or grow restless. Believe me, I have her welfare at
  heart."</p>

  <p>Joan gazed resentfully at the ivory profile against the burning blue sky.
  It was so bleak, so purged of human passion&mdash;that she was reminded of
  the mental detachment of the Inquisition, when it tortured bodies to gain
  souls.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well," she said coldly. "I won't ask her."</p>

  <p>A few yards lower down, she gave a little cry.</p>

  <p>"Hang. I've lost my brooch."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," said Miss Asprey. "You were not wearing a brooch."</p>

  <p>"But I was," persisted Joan. "Miss Mack warned me that the pin wasn't too
  safe."</p>

  <p>"In that case," remarked Miss Asprey, with a perceptible tightening of her
  well-cut lips, "you have probably lost it on your climb. It may be on the
  top, where you lay down. We'll go back and search for it."</p>

  <p>"No, thanks," said Joan quickly. "It's worth twopence."</p>

  <p>"But even a twopenny brooch has that value. As you're so tired, sit down,
  and I'll go back for it."</p>

  <p>Joan bit her lip as she staggered to her feet.</p>

  <p>'She only wants to humiliate me,' she thought. 'I'm going, too, if it
  kills me. She saw that I resented Miss Mack&mdash;and she is going to punish
  me. She's not a saint. She's <i>cruel</i>.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07"></a>VII. &mdash; THE EXTRA GUEST</h2>

  <p class="first">AS Miss Corner had a sheltered garden, with a southern
  aspect, her strawberries were first in the neighbourhood to ripen. This was
  her signal to give the opening garden-party of the season. Directly she
  received her gardener's report, she sent out her invitations.</p>

  <p>There were no refusals, and even the Squire did the novelist the rare
  honour to be present. He was a big, burly man, both blustering and
  sentimental, who advertised his loyalty, during the War, by decorating his
  car with the Union Jack, and who erected grave-stones over the pets whose
  death had not caused him a pang. He had the moral support of the entire male
  population, while there was a full muster of ladies.</p>

  <p>Joan Brook stood by herself on the path beside the raised Kelway border,
  on purpose to watch the scene, for this form of typical country entertainment
  was new to her, and she wanted to see the village in its party frock.
  Everyone wore new summer finery, reserved for the occasion. The small tables
  dotted about the lawn displayed the dishes of strawberries, which gave the
  'signature' to the party. An imported string-orchestra played 'Valses from
  Vienna', and the weather was perfect, with fountains of white cloud spouting
  up into a vivid blue sky.</p>

  <p>Miss Julia Corner, in pale pink chiffon, stenciled with enormous roses,
  and a flopping crinoline hat, felt the thrill of a successful hostess as she
  beamed on her guests. As far as she could estimate from her rough count of
  heads, nearly everyone had arrived. Her loud laughter rang out and her petals
  seemed to expand visibly in the warm air, as she gave the signal for the tea
  to be carried out on the lawns.</p>

  <p>The poor soul had no knowledge of an unbidden outsider&mdash;a dark,
  shapeless blur&mdash;which slunk outside the gate, awaiting its opportunity
  to steal inside.</p>

  <p>Joan, too, was unconscious of any shadow, or threat of impending trouble,
  as she lingered by the delphiniums and columbines, for her attention was held
  by Mrs. Perry. Although the doctor's wife looked, as usual, beautiful
  wreckage, it was clear that she possessed the essential quality of
  attraction, for most of the men were clustered around her. Even the Squire
  was indulging in a heavy flirtation, for which, afterwards, he would be
  furiously angry with the lady.</p>

  <p>Joan was disturbed by the approach of the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Admiring us?" he asked lightly.</p>

  <p>"I'm admiring your wife," replied Joan.</p>

  <p>"That's nice of you. She always manages to convey the impression of an
  Evelyn Brent adventuress, which is quite clever of her. The sad truth is, she
  concentrates exclusively on her babies."</p>

  <p>"Does she?" Joan's voice was so incredulous, as she remembered the
  sun-bathing episode, that she hastened to make amends. "No wonder," she added
  quickly. "They're perfect darlings. Aren't you lucky?"</p>

  <p>"Are we? I wonder. Insecurity is every parent's nightmare. Doctors go out
  of fashion."</p>

  <p>"But not <i>here</i>."</p>

  <p>"No." The doctor smiled. "I think I'm fairly dug-in here. You know, my
  family has lived in this place for centuries...But why are you perched up
  here, alone?"</p>

  <p>"To watch."</p>

  <p>"I understand. I'm also a spectator of the Divine Comedy. But&mdash;I
  should place <i>you</i> on the stage."</p>

  <p>Joan was slightly annoyed by the manner in which the doctor glanced across
  to the Rector, who&mdash;clad in clerical grey&mdash;was hurling himself
  through the different groups, rather like an animated version of
  Michelangelo's Sun being projected into Space.</p>

  <p>"If it comes to that," she remarked, "I'm not so sure that <i>you</i> are
  as passive as you seem."</p>

  <p>"Ah. I'm intelligent enough to recognise that for flattery. There is
  nothing so dull as a country G.P. He is only interesting when he stands in
  the Dock, on a capital charge."</p>

  <p>His detachment was so stressed that Joan tried to startle him into
  interest.</p>

  <p>"You mean murder?" she asked. "Of course, I don't want to boast, but I had
  a relative who was hanged. And not for something he didn't do, either. He
  murdered his wife."</p>

  <p>"Horrible."</p>

  <p>"Let's be modern, and call it rather too strong a dose of human
  nature...Different to this village." Joan laughed. "It's nearly Heaven on
  earth. Take one example. I'm here. The best people have never asked me to
  their parties before."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you like us," said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"I do. And yet&mdash;I've a feeling I'm not sure of&mdash;of one
  person."</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry flashed her an interested glance.</p>

  <p>"Who?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Although indiscretion was Joan's special failing, instinct warned her it
  would be wiser not to utter a hint of treason against the queen of the
  village.</p>

  <p>But the doctor's eyes had followed hers, and he noticed that she was
  glancing at a group of ladies gathered near the gates. Miss Asprey had just
  arrived.</p>

  <p>"<i>Who?</i>" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"No one," replied Joan, in an effort to confuse the trail. "I was only
  talking in a general sort of way. All the people here are so marvellously
  kind that I sometimes wonder if they <i>could</i> be cruel. For instance,
  there's&mdash;there's Mrs. Scudamore. Her own marriage is perfect. Well,
  suppose I was a tarnished heroine, how would she treat me?"</p>

  <p>"She would be perfectly just."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure of it. But would she <i>understand?</i> Would she feel we were
  both women who loved our men, and there was nothing between us, but five
  minutes in some dirty Register Office?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not. Why should she understand the self-indulgence of a
  temptation to which she, herself, would never yield?"</p>

  <p>In spite of the chill in Dr. Perry's voice, Joan was satisfied with the
  success of her ruse.</p>

  <p>"Why, there's Miss Asprey," she cried innocently.</p>

  <p>The queen of the village walked slowly across, the lawn, like an actress
  taking the stage. She wore a sober grey gown, with white collar and cuffs,
  which suggested a Quakeress, until the fact emerged that the materials were
  soft dull satin and exquisite lace. It was her first public appearance since
  the episode of the letter, and she moved with poise and dignity, although she
  leaned upon a silver-headed cane.</p>

  <p>Her appearance was a signal for a demonstration of silent sympathy. There
  was a definite stir in her direction and she was overwhelmed with welcomes.
  Those who could not reach her, tried to catch her eye with their smiles. Only
  Joan, in her new spirit of criticism&mdash;stood outside the circle of her
  court.</p>

  <p>"Does an attack on your moral character make you limp?" she asked the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"When you've lived here as long as Miss Asprey," replied the doctor,
  "you'll make the acquaintance of every drop of uric acid in your system. The
  'Spout' is damp, and Miss Asprey suffers from sciatica. It's very brave of
  her to come...Shall we go and speak to her?"</p>

  <p>Joan followed the doctor rather reluctantly, for she remembered certain
  painful and breathless hours in the company of a tireless walker. There was
  no hint of muscular trouble about Miss Asprey on that occasion. A confused
  memory of drawing-room gossip swam into her brain.</p>

  <p>'I was whacked, while she was fresh. Did she suck my strength? Oh,
  idiot.'</p>

  <p>Although she shook off her sensational suspicion, the late entrance still
  struck her as staged to attract attention.</p>

  <p>But as she drew near enough to see Miss Asprey's face she was ashamed of
  her thoughts. The elderly woman's expression was stern with the bleak
  spiritualism of one who had burnt away all gross elements in the fires of
  martyrdom. Her response to the general homage was so gently indifferent that
  it was plain that she did not care a fig for popularity.</p>

  <p>Then&mdash;once again&mdash;came the jar of an ugly little incident. Miss
  Corner, like an overblown pink rose, rushed across the lawn to speak to her
  guest.</p>

  <p>"My goodness, Decima, I never noticed before that you've not brought Miss
  Mack? Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"In bed, I hope," was the quiet reply. "I was going to make her apologies
  when you were called away. We are both of us so sorry that she is unable to
  come. But she has violent neuralgia."</p>

  <p>Everyone accepted the explanation, with one exception. Although there was
  now a gap in the ranks of Miss Asprey's court, Joan turned away and stood
  gazing at the scene, as though it had suddenly grown unreal.</p>

  <p>It was a charming spectacle of shaven lawns, roses, and the best people.
  The hired waiters rushed round with plates of strawberries and pitchers of
  cream. A trellis covered with clusters of mauve wistaria provided touches of
  tender colour on the soft prevailing green.</p>

  <p>Everything was beautiful&mdash;yet what did it conceal? The novelist,
  Purley, had talked of flowers growing on slime. Joan remembered the smile as
  horribly apposite to her suspicion.</p>

  <p>For she could not square Miss Asprey's excuse with her own knowledge of
  facts.</p>

  <p>Only fifteen minutes previously, when she had passed the garden of 'The
  Spout', in Lady d'Arcy's car, she had waved to Miss Mack, who was standing
  behind the gate. There was no sign of pain or illness about the little
  companion's smiling face; yet, probably because of the iron bars, she again
  managed to convey a pathetic impression of a prisoner.</p>

  <p>Joan was gritting her teeth&mdash;a survival of a bad nursery
  habit&mdash;when the Rector came up, balancing a plate of strawberries in
  either hand.</p>

  <p>"Why aren't you mopping up strawberries?" he asked. "It's what we're here
  for. Come along with me. This looks like our table. Reserved for us, isn't
  it, John?"</p>

  <p>The waiter beamed, for the Rector was the prince of good mixers, and Joan
  sat down, in the shade of a copper-beach, with a sense of relief. Unlike the
  doctor, the Rector had come to refresh her body, and not to pick her brain.
  He, too, was a comparative new-comer, so that she felt removed to a more
  familiar plane.</p>

  <p>"Saw you talking to the doctor," remarked the Rector. "Nice fellow, but a
  bit precious."</p>

  <p>The first drop of poison had established a small but definitely inflamed
  area, for the relationship of the two men was now on a different basis. They
  no longer smoked in the fraternal silence of Freemasons, but talked with the
  geniality of two men-of-the-world.</p>

  <p>"My stock's down with him," confessed Joan. "Just because I tried to
  thrill him by telling him that we had a murderer in our family."</p>

  <p>"You should have called him an assassin. That sounds historical. He'd have
  gone down all right as an ancestor."</p>

  <p>It was the most uncharitable remark that Joan had heard from the Rector,
  but it made her feel at ease, so that she was betrayed to fresh
  indiscretion.</p>

  <p>"The fact is," she said, "the doctor's family is older than the Peerage,
  and his stock must be played out. It's time it was extinct, in the cause of
  Progress. A real modernist would say that he ought to collect his entire
  family in the oven, and turn on the gas."</p>

  <p>Her clear voice carried to the next table, where the Scudamores were
  presenting a Darby and Joan idyll, as they had tea together. Mrs. Scudamore,
  who was very impressive in purple, looked up and stared at Joan&mdash;her
  lips set and her eyes startled, as though she could not believe her ears.
  Even the Rector pulled down his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Look here, my dear," he said, "I can understand your modern language,
  although I cannot speak it, but do remember that these people understand only
  King's English."</p>

  <p>"I'll remember. Sorry."</p>

  <p>As Joan gazed at the Rector, for the first time she believed the story of
  his crash. Usually, he looked as though he would be better for a little
  blood-letting, in order to drain off his surplus energy; but, today, his eyes
  were tired and his mouth sunken.</p>

  <p>"You look rather dissipated about your eyes," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"Poached eggs?" asked the Rector. "They come from a bad night. I still get
  them, sometimes. I had supper with the Jameses last night, at the
  Constabulary, and Mrs. James is a clinking cook. Sausages and
  mash&mdash;supreme. I gorged, so when I got to bed I had a sort of recurring
  dream, which took it out of me."</p>

  <p>"One of the embarrassing kind?"</p>

  <p>"No. I dreamed I was having a fight with someone&mdash;I used to be an
  amateur heavy-weight&mdash;and I was taking terrific punishment. I was
  furious at getting licked, but, what maddened me most, was the fact,
  that&mdash;somehow&mdash;I couldn't see whom I was fighting with. The chap
  kept ducking and dodging, to hide his face. Yet I had a feeling it was
  someone I knew, that made it seem rather horrible. Anyway, I got so worked up
  that I woke up in a shocking state."</p>

  <p>"You still are," sad Joan. "You're holding your plate crooked."</p>

  <p>The Rector absently wiped the trickle of cream from his coat, as he looked
  around him.</p>

  <p>"Is it my fancy?" he asked. "Or is this party not quite a blazing
  success."</p>

  <p>He did not know that the dark huddle outside the gate had now crashed the
  party. Hiding in its corner, it only waited a signal from the hostess, to
  mingle with her guests.</p>

  <p>But it seemed to the Rector that there was a slight general atmosphere of
  constraint. Miss Asprey had reminded the company of the anonymous letter.
  While its authorship was still unknown, there was bound to be some
  uneasiness. So there occurred those little frosted pauses in the conversation
  which were heralds of the fatal ice-jam.</p>

  <p>Miss Corner, however, was unaware of any blight. She was a dynamic
  hostess&mdash;rushing from group to group, with gales of laughter, and a
  balloon inflation of her rosy flounces&mdash;organising competitions,
  compelling people to play croquet, and lighting fresh cigarettes as fast as
  she threw them away.</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry watched her, as the party wore on, and cup and ices succeeded
  tea. She called to the orchestra to play the waltz from 'Congress Dances',
  and executed a few steps of a solo, as she exhorted her guests to live, love,
  and laugh.</p>

  <p>Finally, she threw herself down, panting, on a garden chair. It was the
  first time she had sat down, that afternoon, and Dr. Perry took the chance to
  bring her iced cider-cup.</p>

  <p>She beamed on him as she wiped her heated face.</p>

  <p>"Here comes my hero," she shouted. "Did you know that the doctor is the
  hero of every one of my novels?"</p>

  <p>No one could possibly know, as Miss Corner's books were unread in the
  village, but she went on to explain.</p>

  <p>"I've written twelve novels, and I've put an entirely different kind of
  hero in each. But it's always the doctor. For he's, really, a dozen different
  men, and he covers the lot with one hat."</p>

  <p>Everyone laughed politely, while the doctor gave a deprecating smile.</p>

  <p>"That should make me sound interesting, even to my wife," he sad.</p>

  <p>At the sound of her name, Marianne Perry, who was re-fastening the
  Squire's buttonhole, suddenly jabbed in the pin, and turned away abruptly, to
  join another group. Her thin, scarlet lips were quivering and her eyes
  smouldering with rage, as she whispered huskily to the Squire's wife.</p>

  <p>"How <i>dare</i> she say that of my husband?"</p>

  <p>Kindly Mrs. Sheriff was surprised by her vehemence.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear," she explained, "it was only a joke."</p>

  <p>"A joke that goes too far," declared Marianne. "A doctor <i>must</i>
  inspire confidence, because he holds a position of trust. I don't call it a
  joke to imply that my husband isn't quite what he seems to be, but a bit
  more. We&mdash;we've babies to think of."</p>

  <p>She added, "especially <i>now</i>."</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;now?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you <i>know</i>."</p>

  <p>As Marianne bit her lip to regain her self-control, poor Miss Corner
  unconsciously applied the match which blew up her party. She flashed her
  glasses round the lawn and then crossed to Miss Asprey, speaking with the
  easy familiarity of one old school-mate to another.</p>

  <p>"Well, Decima, anything fresh about your anonymous letter?"</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey raised her heavy ivory lids.</p>

  <p>"No," she replied. "It is best forgotten."</p>

  <p>"No idea as to who wrote it?" went on Miss Corner, unabashed.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Miss Corner suddenly exploded into a fit of laughter. "Perhaps <i>I</i>
  could make a guess," she said.</p>

  <p>As though her words were a signal, the dark blotch, huddled in a corner of
  the garden, quivered into hideous life and mingled with the other guests.</p>

  <p>With the entry of Fear, Miss Corner's party was practically killed, for
  its spirit had soured and died. The continual hum of conversation was now
  broken by sudden awkward pauses. Immaculate men and elegant ladies stood in
  the usual little clusters, but each one gave the impression of whispering to
  his friend, while he tried to overhear his neighbour. For the same thought
  was in every mind.</p>

  <p>'There is someone here who has slandered a good woman. <i>I</i> may be the
  next victim.'</p>

  <p>Usually, the Squire was the first to leave any social function, for even
  Mrs. Scudamore waited for his signal. On this occasion, however, Miss Asprey
  made the important move. She rose unobtrusively and whispered to Miss
  Corner.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, dear Julia. Let me slip away quietly. I don't want to break up
  your party, but I feel I must return to my poor Miss Mack."</p>

  <p>But the queen of the village could not leave without the notice of her
  subjects. The Squire was next to react to the moral rot. He looked at his
  watch, caught his wife's eyes, and asked her to collect Vivian, who was
  playing clock-golf with the manly Major Blair.</p>

  <p>Immediately his car rolled away there was a general departure, which was
  swift and concentrated. Miss Corner&mdash;her red face perplexed, but
  smiling&mdash;stood and shook hands, while she listened to a collection of
  assorted compliments and excuses. Within ten minutes, she was left alone in
  her garden, amid a desert of empty chairs, drained tea-cups and
  strawberry-hulls.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm damned," she remarked, as she lit a fresh cigarette and sat
  down to think.</p>

  <p>Presently, Mrs. Pike came out on the lawn, although not quite certain of
  her reception.</p>

  <p>"It's over a bit early, isn't it, madam?" she asked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's nothing for us to complain of," said Miss Corner briskly.
  "You can get cleared away. And I can return to the excellent company of Mr.
  Strachey. You really ought to read him, Mrs. Pike."</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Pike knew that the most detached hostess must feel the failure of
  an expensive entertainment, and she showed her sympathy.</p>

  <p>"It's a <i>shame</i>...I wonder <i>why</i>."</p>

  <p>Miss Corner winked at a bed of flamingo-red sweet-Williams.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, Mrs. Pike," she said, "that is the half of your story which we
  do <i>not</i> know."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08"></a>VIII. &mdash; PAYING THE BILL</h2>

  <p class="first">BY the next day, Fear had slunk back to its lair, so that
  the social life of the village again flowed on tranquilly. The Scudamores'
  evening parade was punctual and affectionate as usual. But there was one
  difference.</p>

  <p>Miss Corner was not met casually in any drawing-room. It was true that her
  name was not left out of invitation-lists purposely; but it was not included.
  And nobody knew exactly why&mdash;or could be prevailed on to discuss the
  situation. It was just an instinctive matter of sensitive feelers.</p>

  <p>Miss Corner was not affected by the social frost, for it gave her more
  time for her new school-serial&mdash;all about a boy who topped the
  Examinations, in spite of the fact that his rival cheated&mdash;which was
  rather an indictment on the accuracy of the text-books from which he
  cribbed.</p>

  <p>She had to break off, however, when the bills for the garden-party came
  in. Her brow puckered as she wrote cheques for the orchestra, the waiters,
  hired chairs, cream and ices. Then, as the acid of the situation bit home to
  her practical nature, she exploded into a heart-felt 'Damn'.</p>

  <p>Presently, she took up a blank engagement-book.</p>

  <p>"Lady d'Arcy's At Home," she murmured. "Too fine a day to waste on shoddy
  minds, when I could meet Maurois. But the walk will be good for my
  overweight."</p>

  <p>Joan Brook also disliked the prospect of giving up her afternoon of
  precious liberty, while Lady d'Arcy was equally depressed.</p>

  <p>"You must stay in, Brooky," she said. "An appalling sacrifice. Just asking
  to be bored&mdash;and my garden calling."</p>

  <p>The kindly lady did not know that boredom was not to be her portion, or
  that she was destined to make local history. As she sat in front of the
  tea-tray, and murmured the platitudes of a hostess, her big, grey-green eyes
  were mournfully fixed on her sheets of irises, while her thoughts hovered,
  like butterflies, over her flowers.</p>

  <p>To Joan, also, the scene had the blurred quality of a dream. The vast
  drawing-room, with its dark polished surfaces and rippling reflections of
  greenery, seemed a shady cavern from which she, too, looked out wistfully
  into the quivering heat. She could hear the hum of bees beating on the warm
  air, like a myriad invisible spinning-wheels, as she fixed her eyes on a
  distant streak of brilliant yellow, which marked the union of the gardens
  with the buttercup-pastures.</p>

  <p>It was the static At Home, with its familiar guests, tea equipment, and
  refreshment; everything was as usual&mdash;polite boredom, corpulent silver,
  and a smother of cream. Joan dutifully shouted down a dowager's ear-trumpet,
  and listened to an interchange of political views, drawn from the same
  source&mdash;the leader of the only newspaper read by the best people.</p>

  <p>She looked up with a sense of relief when the footman announced Mrs.
  Perry, for the doctor's wife was always an irritant quality. On this
  occasion, Marianne did not fail Joan. She swooped in, dressed in amber, and
  heavily scented with some Oriental attar of geraniums. Soon, without warning,
  she threw a smoking bomb into the drowsy drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, sweeping the politicians off the board, "what do you
  think about Miss Corner's confession?"</p>

  <p>"Confession?" echoed Lady d'Arcy. "What has Miss Corner confessed to?"</p>

  <p>"Writing the anonymous letter to Miss Asprey. She practically admitted it
  at her garden-party."</p>

  <p>"But that was only her nonsense. Why should she give herself away?"</p>

  <p>"To throw dust in our eyes, of course. Besides, who else could have
  written it? She's always been jealous of Miss Asprey. And she lives alone,
  and very likely, broods. My husband says that every anonymous letter-writer
  is a pathological case."</p>

  <p>There was a painful pause, for all present were of kindly disposition, and
  scandal was almost an unknown quality. Although they were aware of an
  undercurrent of throbbing interest, they were relieved when Lady d'Arcy, so
  to speak, re-spread the smother of cream over the conversation.</p>

  <p>"We have no actual proof," she said blandly.</p>

  <p>"What proof can you have?" persisted Marianne. "An anonymous letter is not
  witnessed, like a legal document."</p>

  <p>Pent up in one corner, fluid Lady d'Arcy overflowed in another.</p>

  <p>"But is it English to suspect someone who's not been proved guilty?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>The doctor's wife drew up a corner of her scarlet lip, exposing a tooth,
  almost in a snarl.</p>

  <p>"It's rather a personal matter with me," she said, "as, naturally, I
  objected to a remark she made about my husband. I may ask you, Lady d'Arcy,
  is it English to say anything that might discredit a professional man, who
  has two little children dependent on him?"</p>

  <p>Joan had ceased to shout down the ear-trumpet, for this was not the static
  At Home. Thrilled with excitement, she looked around her, at the guests, from
  Mrs. Scudamore&mdash;wrapped in the non-committal calm of 'good
  form'&mdash;to Vivian Sheriff, who was sitting in the window.</p>

  <p>Under the brim of her mushroom hat, Vivian's face looked pinkly infantile,
  and her frock was frilled baby-blue. But her eyes held almost painful
  tension, as she spoke.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, it's as well, for us to be on our guard."</p>

  <p>"Guard against what?" asked Mrs. Scudamore, speaking for the first time.
  "No harm has been done."</p>

  <p>"Not yet. But this may be only the beginning."</p>

  <p>As Vivian spoke, once again a black flicker quivered across the
  sun-drenched garden.</p>

  <p>Marianne was first to respond to the toxic quality of Fear. Her voice was
  sharp as she broke into a nervous tirade.</p>

  <p>"I think anyone who writes an anonymous letter is a real danger. Whenever
  there's been some terrible crime&mdash;a little child murdered&mdash;there's
  always a pest of these letters. I suppose it's some warped sense of
  humour&mdash;Heaven help them&mdash;but they all add to the mental torture of
  the parents. I&mdash;I speak as a mother. Besides, they confuse the real
  clues and hinder the Police. Personally I should have no mercy on an
  anonymous letter-writer."</p>

  <p>"I agree." Mrs. Scudamore's voice was so low as to be almost inaudible.
  "The idea of any kind of cruelty repels me. But&mdash;in such a case&mdash;I
  should be ruthless, so that good might result."</p>

  <p>Everyone gasped, for the social oracle had spoken. Then Vivian broke the
  pause, with a nervous giggle.</p>

  <p>"Miss Corner's coming up the drive."</p>

  <p>Instantly, Lady d'Arcy gave Joan the first direct order she had
  received.</p>

  <p>"Miss Brook, will you please tell William I am not at home?"</p>

  <p>Hardly able to credit her ears, Joan slipped out into the hall, paved like
  a chess-board, with black-and-white marble flags. Unfortunately, the front
  door was open, so that she could see Miss Corner&mdash;red and
  beaming&mdash;wiping her heated face, as she waited in the porch. But she was
  too short sighted to recognise the girl, who kept in the shadow of the wall,
  as she whispered Lady d'Arcy's instruction to the footman.</p>

  <p>Joan returned to the drawing-room, just as the bell pealed through the
  hall. She heard a murmur of voices, followed by an ominous silence. And then
  the gravel crunched once more under Miss Corner's footsteps.</p>

  <p>Looking through the window, Joan saw the back of her broad figure trudging
  down the drive.</p>

  <p>Perhaps a front view of the lady might have salved Joan's troubled mind,
  for Miss Corner's face was still red and beaming.</p>

  <p>"Fools," she remarked to a passing bumble-bee. "But it's typical of a
  mentality that accepts her."</p>

  <p>The sun beat down fiercely, but she deliberately rejected the
  shade-dappled park for the long tramp through the fields. Swinging her arms,
  she pounded along the ribbon of bumpy path, inhaling the scents of hot pollen
  and dog-roses. Beads of moisture gathered on her forehead, and trickled down
  her neck and cheeks, but she did not wipe them away, when she reached the
  dark tunnel of the Quaker's Walk.</p>

  <p>The cooler temperature made her shiver slightly, so that she walked still
  faster, until a familiar voice behind her caused her to stop.</p>

  <p>"Is this a dirt-track? I've had to run to catch you up."</p>

  <p>In spite of his statement, Dr. Perry looked cool and composed, as usual,
  in his light summer suit. As he remarked Miss Corner's distressed condition,
  his expression was both pained and pleased, for, allied with his
  compassionate nature, was the zeal of the collector who spikes his bug.</p>

  <p>"You've got too hot," he said reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"I've been trying to disperse my atoms," explained Miss Corner. "But
  they're the most faithful ever. I lose them, only to find them somewhere
  else. I'm told I'm composed of a pound of chemical dirt and a pail of water.
  Well, I find it hard to believe."</p>

  <p>"But you should really keep in the shade," persisted the doctor.</p>

  <p>"I hate the shade. This avenue gives me a churchyard chill. And I hate to
  think of death."</p>

  <p>Her loud laugh rolled down the avenue.</p>

  <p>"The people here take that as proof that I'm not sure of my future abode.
  But I don't go to church, because I can't stand the rubbish that young man
  preaches. He's all delivery&mdash;and not one original idea."</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry did not hide his pleasure.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;and I&mdash;are in the minority," he smiled.</p>

  <p>"Very much so. Of course the village raves about him. All the same, when
  they go to book the best seats I think they'll be rather surprised to find
  there's no Box-Office in Heaven. Blow them."</p>

  <p>"Anything special the matter?" asked the doctor curiously.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Only, tell me a funny story. A pathological one, all about
  things not mentioned in polite society."</p>

  <p>"Medical facts are never gross, Julia. But you sound as if you'd been
  having an overdose of refinement. My Marianne suffers from the same
  complaint. She was groaning all through lunch. I suppose you've just come
  away from Lady d'Arcy's At Home?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, come away, but I never went to it. I was informed, at the door, that
  Lady d'Arcy was not at home."</p>

  <p>For once Dr. Perry was startled out of his composure.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, Julia," he said, gently patting her big shoulder. "You had
  all the luck."</p>

  <p>"Don't I know it?... Horatio, you really are a friend. I want you to know
  something...I've left you all my money."</p>

  <p class="first">EVEN though the lethal quality was absent, there was fresh
  evidence that the poison of the anonymous letter had spread, when Dr. Perry
  and his wife decided to give their bi-seasonal tennis-party. It was always
  the second event on the social programme, according to precedent.</p>

  <p>When they discussed their list of names, Marianne mutinied against Miss
  Corner's name being included, but&mdash;rather to her surprise&mdash;Dr.
  Perry made no protest.</p>

  <p>"Leave her out, certainly," he said, "if you think it wise."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he looked down at the tow head of the elder baby, Micky, who
  was frogging round the dining-room. Even his blue rompers bore traces of
  Marianne's maternal devotion, in their small sprays of hand-embroidery; and,
  as her black-ringed eyes followed his course, which jagged like a
  temperature-chart, her expression changed.</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "She's as good as an annuity to us. We can't risk
  offending her."</p>

  <p>"I don't think there's any real risk of that," said the doctor quietly.
  "Julia's too big to nurse a grudge."</p>

  <p>The invitations were finally sent out, after several unimportant names had
  been struck off the list; for the doctor's wife was selective, and also an
  alien, so had not acquired that spirit of wholesale kindliness which animated
  village hospitality.</p>

  <p>But, when the acceptance came in, she was aghast by one important refusal.
  Miss Asprey regretted being unable to attend, as she had arranged a picnic on
  the Downs, as a little treat for Miss Mack.</p>

  <p>"That's a dig at me," declared Marianne, "just because I didn't invite her
  companion. Hang it, why should I? Miss Mack doesn't play tennis. I don't want
  any paper at my shows."</p>

  <p>The doctor went on tying flies, in silence, but his wife knew what was in
  his mind. Miss Asprey's absence would be noticed.</p>

  <p>"They'll think she wouldn't come because of Miss Corner," she said. "It'll
  look as if we were taking sides&mdash;and a doctor's position should be
  impersonal. The truth is, there's not room here for both of those good women.
  One of them ought to be painlessly bumped off."</p>

  <p>The second refusal was a sharper shock, for Mrs. Sheriff wrote, expressing
  regret that no one from the Hall could come, owing to indisposition. Even the
  doctor's composure was shattered.</p>

  <p>"<i>Who's</i> ill?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"She doesn't say," replied Marianne. "Well, that's done us in. It's going
  to be a flop."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary," muttered the doctor, reading the note. "Mrs. Sheriff
  doesn't seem to realize that it's adding insult to injury to plead illness of
  which I've no official knowledge. I wonder who's been called in."</p>

  <p>"Oh, darling"&mdash;Marianne's voice was impatient&mdash;"no one's ill.
  That's only an excuse, because they don't want to meet your special
  friend&mdash;the famous authoress who nobody's ever heard of."</p>

  <p>As a matter-of-fact, the Squire's refusal was a gesture of self-respect.
  He did not like to remember that he had made himself cheap with an
  odd-looking woman like Mrs. Perry.</p>

  <p>"I don't play tennis," he barked, when the invitation-card was received at
  the Hall.</p>

  <p>"You can watch," suggested Mrs. Sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Watch rabbits? If I want to watch tennis, I'll go up to Wimbledon."</p>

  <p>"Then shall I refuse for you, and accept for Vivian and myself?" asked his
  wife.</p>

  <p>"No, refuse for the lot...There's been some gossip about a letter. I don't
  want to get mixed up with village scandal."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sheriff was sorry, for the opportunities for Vivian to meet Major
  Blair were limited; but the Squire had the satisfaction of knowing that he
  had put Mrs. Perry in her place. She would understand that he was not her
  spaniel, to come when she whistled. A man had to be careful with a woman of
  her type; he could still remember the glint of her eyes through her lashes,
  and the stirring of her hair on his cheek, when she whispered to him.</p>

  <p>Even as Marianne anticipated, her party was not a success, although she,
  herself, was partly to blame. She was too self-centred and restless to make a
  good hostess; when she talked to a guest, her eyes were elsewhere, and she
  rarely listened to what was said.</p>

  <p>The weather, also, was close, with a hot grey-blue sky, so that the ices
  melted on their plates before they were served. But the real reason for the
  social blight was the absence of Miss Asprey and the party from the Hall.</p>

  <p>It was an inexplicable double which made the guests look thoughtful. They
  had to supply the answer to their own question, and, apparently, reached the
  same conclusion, for when Miss Corner arrived there was not the usual
  eagerness to secure her as a partner.</p>

  <p>In spite of her short sight, the novelist was the best tennis player in
  the neighbourhood, with a forehand drive like the kick of a horse. She
  carried four racquets under her arm, and was complete in a short, white,
  sleeveless tennis frock, and eye-shade.</p>

  <p>Her jolly red face beamed over the courts as she waited for the play to
  begin.</p>

  <p>"Enter Helen," she said, bowing to the circle of chairs. "Wonder what my
  form's like. Well, anyhow, you'll know I shan't try to hit two balls."</p>

  <p>Her loud laughter rolled, as she pointed to her scrap of Oxford blue
  ribbon pinned to her snowy chest. But, presently, she grew impatient of the
  delay.</p>

  <p>"Are we waiting for the Queen to come? What's keeping us? Shall we spin
  for the shady side? Where's my partner?"</p>

  <p>Before the pause became awkward, Joan Brook rushed into the breach.</p>

  <p>"Would you like a real handicap, Miss Corner?" she asked. "I'm only a
  rabbit."</p>

  <p>"You can't be bad enough for me," shouted Miss Corner. "I love a fight to
  the finish&mdash;with all the odds against me. Lead on, Macduff."</p>

  <p>The novelist gave no sign of feeling any loss of popularity, but there was
  a glint behind her glasses which told that she was on her mettle. Although it
  was her first game of the season, she gave a great demonstration of strength
  and agility. Joan had no chance to show what she could do, for Miss Corner
  poached every ball.</p>

  <p>She went up to the net and smashed, like Horatius defending the bridge,
  and she gambolled and leaped, like some infuriated seal. When the set was
  won&mdash;on her play alone&mdash;she shook hands with her opponents, and
  then with herself.</p>

  <p>"Give you your revenge, later," she remarked "Won't we, Miss Brook?"</p>

  <p>She beamed on Joan, but the Rector had recognised the fighting spirit, and
  was anxious to prove that he belonged to the Church Militant.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd partner me, later," he pleaded.</p>

  <p>"You'll learn more by playing <i>against</i> me, padre," she told him.
  "Put me in a tight corner, with my back against the wall, and I can rise to
  the occasion."</p>

  <p>Although Dr. Perry, Joan and the Rector accompanied her, like a
  body-guard, with a tacit understanding to protect her from that indefinite
  withdrawal, which indicated the general feeling, Miss Corner did not require
  their services.</p>

  <p>"Party's hanging fire a bit," she whispered to Dr. Perry. "Leave it to me,
  Horatio. I'll pull it round."</p>

  <p>The pitifully poor quality of her humour was evident, during tea, when she
  played practical jokes, asked ancient riddles, and told bewhiskered jokes.
  The fact that her audience did not appear amused, was accepted by her as
  their own deficiency.</p>

  <p>As a matter-of-fact, most of the guests were bewildered and uneasy. The
  story that Lady d'Arcy had refused to receive the novelist, had gone round
  the village, and everyone was startled and shocked, for it was an offence
  against the general charity.</p>

  <p>Gentle Mrs. Scudamore&mdash;with the self-deception that is part of human
  nature&mdash;forget that she, herself, had initiated the persecution, and was
  pained by the hostile atmosphere. Later on, when she reviewed the party, she
  congratulated herself on the good-fortune which seemed to shield her from any
  direct contact with Miss Corner.</p>

  <p>On the one occasion when the novelist had blundered to her side, she had
  been giving her famous recipe for mint-jelly, to another guest, so,
  naturally, had to look into vacancy, in order to concentrate on the exact
  quantities.</p>

  <p>Lady d'Arcy, having made her gesture, was not guilty of the discourtesy of
  the cut direct; but she drifted aimlessly before Miss Corner's approach, like
  a captive balloon bumping over the grass.</p>

  <p>Apparently impervious to social chill and torrid atmosphere alike, Miss
  Corner put up a spectacular effort during her return match, working at the
  game with electric energy. But, from the nature of her remarks, when she hit
  a ball which was 'out', it was obvious that she was playing to the
  gallery.</p>

  <p>"Oh, go to&mdash;Bath," she shouted. "I mean&mdash;'Go to Coventry'.
  That's more topical."</p>

  <p>The spectators were careful not to look at each other, while they politely
  applauded Miss Corner's next brilliant shot.</p>

  <p>When the set was won, Dr. Perry congratulated the panting champion.</p>

  <p>"Not another stroke," he said. "As usual, you've overdone it."</p>

  <p>She slapped his shoulder, with the familiarity which always enraged his
  wife.</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry over me, Horatio. My troubles will be over before yours
  have begun."</p>

  <p>He did not smile, as he looked at her intently.</p>

  <p>"When are you going away?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Are you telling me to go home?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. But <i>when</i> are you going for that holiday?"</p>

  <p>"Day after tomorrow, Grandpa."</p>

  <p>"Oh, where are you going?" asked Joan enviously.</p>

  <p>"Austrian Tyrol," replied Miss Corner. "I'm going to wear little trousies,
  and a hat with a feather, and blow a horn, and run up and down mountains, all
  day."</p>

  <p>"Are you shutting up your house?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It's a general exodus. Mrs. Pike is going on a conducted tour to
  Belgium, and May is going to Ramsgate. I'm taking them both, by bus, to
  Cheltenham, tomorrow, and seeing them into their right trains. And then I
  shall come back, and have one blessed night on my lonesome. Next afternoon, I
  shut up the house and catch the evening boat-train from Victoria."</p>

  <p>The doctor mopped his face, as though he suddenly felt the heat.</p>

  <p>"Good," he said. "Keep to that programme."</p>

  <p>"I will," promised Miss Corner, collecting her racquets. "Where's my bag?
  Which of you has stolen it?"</p>

  <p>When the Rector had found it, lying under a chair, she held it up, and
  broke into a recitation.</p>

  <p class="poem">"'Who steals my purse, steals trash...<br>
  But he, that filches from me my good name,<br>
  Robs me of that, which not enriches him,<br>
  And makes me poor indeed.'"</p>

  <p>Clowning to the last, she snatched up the Rector's hat, and handed it
  round the circle, with gales of laughter.</p>

  <p>As the Rector contrasted her self-abandon and high spirits with the timid
  restraint of the polite guests, she seemed&mdash;to him&mdash;the only vital
  person in a company of ghosts.</p>

  <p>But the doctor saw her as a shade, herself, fading away on an empty stage,
  after the curtain had fallen and the last note of the orchestra died into
  silence.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE SECOND LETTER</h2>

  <p class="first">THE next day was overcast and sultry, with the sputter and
  grumble of a distant thunderstorm. Apparently, the weather affected Dr.
  Perry, for he was silent and preoccupied, during dinner. Presently he spoke
  to his wife, who was eating raw cabbage and carrots.</p>

  <p>"Expect a pain, Mary Ann."</p>

  <p>"Spoken like a doctor," said Marianne. "You're all archaic about food.
  Uncooked vegetables are marvellous for the complexion."</p>

  <p>"If you can digest them. But you're no ostrich."</p>

  <p>"I'm certainly not." Marianne's voice was meaning. "I see all there is to
  be seen."</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry raised his pale face from his plate.</p>

  <p>"In that case," he said, "have you seen Miss Corner today?"</p>

  <p>"I have...This afternoon...By the King's Head...She'd just come off the
  bus."</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry drummed on the table cloth.</p>

  <p>"I've worried about her," he said. "Rushing over to Cheltenham, today,
  with a long journey, and a night in the train, before her. She's asking for
  it. But she's stubborn as a mule. And she has hardly slept this week."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>"By her light. I wish I could persuade her to take a sleeping-draught
  tonight."</p>

  <p>Marianne sprang to her feet, anxious to work off her nervous energy.</p>

  <p>"The usual?" she asked. "I'll toss one together now, on spec. It'll be
  ready, when you are."</p>

  <p>"No." Dr. Perry frowned thoughtfully at a bowl of floating pansies. "I'll
  mix it myself. I'm not sure what she'll best respond to&mdash;and I want it
  to be effective."</p>

  <p>Later in the evening, when his wife was in the night-nursery, indulging in
  a rapture of idolatry, Dr. Perry came out of the dispensary, a small
  dark-blue bottle in his hand. As he crossed the green, it was growing dusk; a
  red line, searing the sky, was all that remained of a spectacular sunset. The
  Scudamores had returned to the Clock House, and the street was deserted.</p>

  <p>In the distance sounded the postman's faint double-knock. Miss Corner was
  leaning over her garden-gate. She wore a drill coat and smelt of the good red
  earth, with which she was plastered.</p>

  <p>"Well, Horatio," she boomed, "I'm working off the effects of your
  party."</p>

  <p>"You ought to be resting," he said reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was you," she told him. "That remark gives you away. I've
  just smashed my glasses&mdash;but it's no use your trying on your wife's fur,
  and pretending you're little Esau. It is the voice of Horatio Perry."</p>

  <p>"Smashed your glasses?" The doctor spoke sympathetically. "But, surely,
  you've an extra pair?"</p>

  <p>"Left them at the optician's, when I was in Cheltenham this morning. But
  I've just got through to them, on the phone, and they have promised to rush
  them over, by special messenger, before I start. Bless them...And you, too,
  my friend, shall have my blessing."</p>

  <p>"I'll accept it, if you will take something of mine, in exchange," said
  the doctor persuasively, as he held out the small bottle. "I know you hate
  them but I specially want you to take this draught, tonight."</p>

  <p>"Filthy stuff," grimaced Miss Corner. "I'd rather try the hat-cure for
  toothache. Know it? You go to bed with a hat and a bottle of whisky. You hang
  up the hat on your bed-knob, and drink the whisky. When you can see three
  hats, your toothache's cured."</p>

  <p>The doctor listened patiently to the familiar joke, and gave a passable
  imitation of joining in her laughter. But he returned to his point.</p>

  <p>"Gardening, on top of yesterday's tennis, is altogether too much for your
  blood-pressure, Julia. You worry me. I speak as a friend. I want you to
  consider <i>me</i>, for a change. A good night will help you through
  tomorrow. Promise me to take a draught."</p>

  <p>"All right, hand it over," said Miss Corner. "Is it the usual poison?"</p>

  <p>"No, it's extra-strong, so be careful of your quantities. Shall I come in
  now, and pour out the exact dose?"</p>

  <p>"No. I've still two hands. And two eyes. I may be blind as a bat, but I
  saw all there was to be seen, yesterday...Well, if the cap fits me, I'll wear
  it, provided it's a becoming shape."</p>

  <p>She laughed loudly, but her face grew so crimson that Dr. Perry looked
  grave.</p>

  <p>"Don't let this silly business keep you awake tonight," he urged.</p>

  <p>"I give you my word, it shan't, Horatio," promised Miss Corner. "Honestly,
  it's nothing to me. I get nothing out of the people here. Their minds are
  like dried mustard...Anything for me, Mr. Postman?"</p>

  <p>She broke off to beam at the globular little postman, who had just rolled
  up to the gate.</p>

  <p>"Yes, one, mum," he replied.</p>

  <p>Miss Corner glanced at the envelope, and then raised her bushy
  eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"The address is printed. It must be some youthful fan-mail. I just love my
  little boys...Do you mind?"</p>

  <p>In spite of her explanation, Dr. Perry's eyes glinted behind his glasses,
  as he watched Miss Corner scan the letter. Then, her mouth puckered, her
  jovial face creased, and she shook in an explosion of laughter.</p>

  <p>"Well," she gasped. "<i>Well</i>. It's anonymous, and I'm accused of being
  a secret soaker. <i>Me</i>&mdash;a pillar of Temperance. I&mdash;I keep a
  bottle of whisky in my wardrobe...Oh dear, oh dear...here, read it for
  yourself."</p>

  <p>Since Miss Corner had given him the gist of the letter, Dr. Perry felt
  protest was unnecessary. A little thrill of triumph ran through him as he
  thought of the Rector. This time he was privileged to receive a lady's
  confidence.</p>

  <p>He noticed that the note, which was brief, was printed, in Roman
  characters, on paper of a good quality. It contained the word, 'decrescent',
  and was correctly spelt.</p>

  <p>"Am I to take this seriously?" he asked. "It's really too absurd. Of
  course, it's meant as a joke."</p>

  <p>"Self-evident," agreed Miss Corner. "It must be from Miss Asprey's secret
  admirer. Joan Brook warned me I should probably be the next victim."</p>

  <p>"Oh, did she?" The doctor's voice was interested. "That is an intelligent
  young lady...Well, what are you going to do about it?"</p>

  <p>"Can I do better than follow Miss Asprey? I shall burn it."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;is that wise?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? The cases are identical. Miss Asprey's letter didn't do her a
  ha'porth of harm, because it accused her of the one thing no one could
  believe, past, present or future. Mine is the same."</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry looked dubious as he remembered the sympathy with which the
  first victim had been overwhelmed, and contrasted it with Miss Corner's
  present unpopularity.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;you want me to be silent about this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Miss Asprey did," said Miss Corner. "It seems the most effective way of
  spreading it abroad."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. I'll say nothing. But&mdash;may I tell my wife?"</p>

  <p>"You may, doctor. Only warn her it's a secret."</p>

  <p>Miss Corner burst into a shout of laughter. After she had said 'Good-bye',
  her broad shoulders continued to shake, and she rocked with merriment as she
  walked back up the flagged path. At her door, she turned to wave, and her
  voice floated out into the quiet night.</p>

  <p>"Laugh, clown, laugh."</p>

  <p>When Dr. Perry told his wife about the anonymous letter, she was thrilled
  by the new excitement. Possessed of quick sympathy, and a warm, generous
  disposition, allied to blazing indiscretion of speech and conduct, she was
  filled with remorse for her own suspicion, together with a wish to make
  instant atonement.</p>

  <p>"I'll go straight over to Mrs. Scudamore, and tell her how terribly we've
  misjudged her," she declared, springing from the divan. "And I'll ask her to
  come over with me, to Miss Corner's, and put it right with her."</p>

  <p>"Sit down," urged her husband. "You're not the Town Crier. It's too late
  to go to the Clock House."</p>

  <p>"But I shan't sleep. I'll be thinking, all night, of that poor plucky
  soul, eating out her heart, and pretending it was all a joke. 'Laugh, clown,
  laugh'. It's tragic."</p>

  <p>In spite of her dismal prophecy, Marianne was asleep long before her
  husband. He tossed for hours, continually snapping on his torch, to see his
  watch. About two o'clock he got up and stole to the spare room, from whose
  windows was a view of Miss Corner's house.</p>

  <p>For the first time, for nearly a week, no light gleamed through the
  darkness, to tell him that the novelist was sitting at her typewriter. Dr.
  Perry drew a deep breath, shivered slightly, and went back to his room.</p>

  <p>Miss Corner was still in bed when the milkman made his first delivery. As
  there was no maid to answer the door, he left a bottle of milk upon the back
  door-step.</p>

  <p>It was there, unopened, when the baker's boy called about noon. Mrs. Pike
  had cancelled the daily orders, but he obeyed some mental urge of his own,
  and put a small cottage loaf on the step, just to keep the milk company.</p>

  <p>Miss Corner was due to catch the two-thirty bus; but the house remained
  silent as the morning slipped into afternoon. Only the clock ticked, and,
  sometimes, a bee buzzed in through the open landing windows.</p>

  <p>About half-past one the optician's assistant, from Cheltenham, pealed the
  front-door bell; but no one answered him, although he rang and knocked
  repeatedly. As his orders were explicit that he must deliver the glasses,
  personally, he decided to ask for information about Miss Corner's
  movements.</p>

  <p>He had barely closed the garden gate, when he met Mrs. Scudamore, with
  Marianne Perry, to whom he confided his difficulty.</p>

  <p>"She has probably overslept," said Mrs. Scudamore.</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Marianne, "my husband gave her a draught last night."</p>

  <p>"Well," remarked the youth, glancing at his watch, "she'll lose her bus,
  and so will I, at this rate."</p>

  <p>"Give me the glasses," said Mrs. Scudamore. "You needn't wait. I will be
  responsible for their delivery."</p>

  <p>She signed the form, and then joined Marianne, who was hammering on the
  white oaken door of Miss Corner's house.</p>

  <p>"I've rung and rung," she declared, her voice breathless from
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"Come round to the back," said Mrs. Scudamore.</p>

  <p>The sight of the milk-bottle and loaf upon the door-step made them look at
  each other, with an unspoken question in their eyes. But Mrs. Scudamore
  remained mistress of the situation.</p>

  <p>"Shall we see if it is possible to get inside?" she asked.</p>

  <p>They went around the house, only to discover each door and window
  fastened, although the upper casements were open. Marianne looked at the
  flagged pathway, in vain hope to find some gravel. Presently, she scooped a
  handful of earth, knotted it inside her handkerchief, and hurled it through
  Miss Corner's bedroom window.</p>

  <p>"Miss Cor&mdash;ner," she shouted.</p>

  <p>No familiar red face, with beaming eyes and grey fringe, was pushed
  between the curtains. The silence fell, and seemed to spread out over the
  garden.</p>

  <p>"She's sleeping like a log," murmured Mrs. Scudamore.</p>

  <p>Marianne said nothing, but the same poisonous suggestion slid into her
  mind.</p>

  <p>"Can she&mdash;is she&mdash;drunk?"</p>

  <p>Marianne shook away the thought impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Let's do something," she cried. "Let's smash a pane."</p>

  <p>But, as the wife of a lawyer, Mrs. Scudamore knew the procedure.</p>

  <p>"That's against the law," she said. "We must get a policeman to do it.
  Your husband is her doctor. I think we had better consult him about it."</p>

  <p>The doctor was standing on the drive of St. James' House, for he had only
  just returned from visiting a case in the country. He was not too pleased to
  see Mrs. Scudamore, as he wanted his lunch; but directly he had grasped the
  drift of his wife's story he jumped back into the dust-filmed car.</p>

  <p>"I'll get Sergeant James, at once," he said. "Don't trouble any more, Mrs.
  Scudamore. I'll call at the Clock House with the news. Mary Ann, you'd better
  have your lunch."</p>

  <p>But the doctor only fought the air when he tried to stem the powerful tide
  of Marianne's curiosity. When he returned from the Village
  Constabulary&mdash;Sergeant James seated beside him&mdash;his wife was
  waiting outside the locked door of Miss Corner's house.</p>

  <p>"Silent as the grave," she declared.</p>

  <p>As they watched the policeman smash a small diamond pane, in order to undo
  the catch of the casement, Miss Asprey's housemaid, Ada, in her attractive
  grey and white livery, ran across the green.</p>

  <p>"The mistress would like to hear if Miss Corner is ill," she said
  breathlessly.</p>

  <p>The message was obviously her own inspiration, for, after she had been
  ordered to return, she hung about the garden. She approved of us, however,
  for when the policeman looked rather doubtfully at the small Tudor window,
  she volunteered to open the door to them.</p>

  <p>There was a touch of farce about the episode, as she dived through the
  narrow aperture, like a harlequin, and her legs kicked in the air. Marianne
  gave an hysterical giggle, which made the doctor silence her sharply.</p>

  <p>"Nerves," she whispered. "I'm scared stiff."</p>

  <p>Her dread was shared by the three of them, as they waited outside the
  mouldered door. Dr. Perry thought of the last time it was shut by the
  mistress of the house, and of her dynamic personality&mdash;too vibrant with
  life, for safety, like an overdriven engine. He heard again her laughter and
  her parting shout&mdash;'Laugh, clown, laugh' before the curtain fell.</p>

  <p>When the door was opened by Ada, in her livery, the touch of formality
  struck a bizarre note, which, somehow, added to the horror.</p>

  <p>Sergeant James was first to enter, but the doctor led the way up the
  shallow oaken stairs. They all felt the silence of the house, even as they
  shattered it by the crash of their entrance.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere had been sealed.</p>

  <p>The afternoon sun was streaming into the big, comfortable bedroom, with
  its furniture of unpolished Italian walnut. By the window was the typewriter,
  to which Miss Corner talked, and on the walls were the mirrors, which
  supplied her with company.</p>

  <p>The novelist was in bed, her face turned to the wall, so that only her
  grey hair was visible. The table, by her side, held a small dark-blue bottle
  and an empty tumbler. There was also an old-fashioned silver candle-stick,
  whose saucer was full of flakey ash and spent matches.</p>

  <p>Sergeant James glanced significantly at the electric bed-lamp, while Dr.
  Perry bent over the pillow, in order to see Miss Corner's face. When he
  raised his head again, his expression made the official question
  unnecessary.</p>

  <p>"Is the deceased cold?" asked the policeman.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the doctor. "She's been dead for hours." He added, as he
  took up the bottle, and smelt the glass, "apparently she's taken an overdose
  of veronal by accident."</p>

  <p>"How d'you know it was an accident?"</p>

  <p>"Because she was short-sighted, and she smashed her glasses, last night.
  There they are, on the toilet-table."</p>

  <p>Sergeant James nodded as he picked up the pair of broken spectacles. But
  his eyes snapped, as he asked another question.</p>

  <p>"What's this letter she's been burning? Looks rather fishy." He picked up
  a scrap of charred envelope, which retained traces of ink. "The address is
  printed."</p>

  <p>"Then it must be the anonymous letter she got last night," burst out
  Marianne.</p>

  <p>Her white lips testified to the severity of her shock, but her
  self-control was so complete that the doctor knew that, later, he would have
  to cope with an emotional reaction.</p>

  <p>Sergeant James looked from husband to wife, and then quickly blocked
  Marianne's view of the doctor so that she could not be influenced by any
  warning signal.</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to know, mum, if there was anything special in the letter,
  to upset her?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," cried Marianne. "Oh, no. It was all too absurd; too futile for
  words. It accused her of drinking, when she's a total abstainer. It only made
  her laugh."</p>

  <p>"Anything else, mum?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it said she always kept a bottle of whisky inside her wardrobe."</p>

  <p>Before the doctor could make a movement to stop him the policeman crossed
  to the big wardrobe, and threw open the doors, revealing a row of gowns on
  hangers.</p>

  <p>Then Marianne gave a horrified gasp, and Ada's eyes grew bigger, as he
  plucked aside the garments, and drew out a bottle of whisky.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; INQUEST</h2>

  <p class="first">SUICIDE is an ugly word. Everyone shied from it, so that it
  remained unspoken. But, before nightfall, the village was stiff with
  conflicting rumours. It was whispered that Miss Corner had been the victim of
  a baseless suspicion&mdash;since the anonymous letter-writer had proved her
  innocence&mdash;in primitive fashion&mdash;with a lethal puncture of
  toxin.</p>

  <p>Everyone was overcome with pity and remorse. The doctor had said that she
  had taken, in error, an overdose of sleeping-mixture. This story was
  accepted, as coming from an official source, especially as Miss Corner's
  slap-dash methods were well-known, and the episode of the smashed glasses was
  authentic.</p>

  <p>Besides, everyone wanted to believe it. Because the village feared she
  might have been driven to take her own life, it was the more determined to
  prove to itself that such an extreme course was an impossibility.</p>

  <p>Yet, underneath the stream of foaming excitement, stole the poisoned
  undertow. Ada had been warned by both Sergeant James and Dr. Perry, not to
  talk about the discovery of the whisky-bottle. But, unfortunately, she was in
  no awe of the police, as she happened to be closely related to it, and had
  seen it eat with its mouth full. Also, she was an adept in dropping a hint,
  and had a wide circle of friends.</p>

  <p>The whisper spread, from house to house, about the secret of the wardrobe;
  and every repetition held its tincture of horror. While the stimulant,
  itself, could be accepted on medical grounds, everyone asked the same
  question.</p>

  <p>'<i>Who</i> was the unknown enemy, who had exact knowledge of a lady's
  privacy, and who used it, as a weapon, to stab her in the back?'</p>

  <p>Fear&mdash;no longer a formless huddle, or a black flicker&mdash;stalked
  the village that night; like a garrotter, it lurked in the shadows, only to
  mark its prey before it leaped. The blinds were drawn earlier than usual,
  and, for the first time, four walls heard the circulation of scandal.</p>

  <p>When&mdash;true to his promise&mdash;Dr. Perry called at the Clock House,
  he was cheered by a sane and wholesome atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore had proved her quality by remaining mistress of the
  situation. There was no reflection of social disorder in the peace and
  comfort of her drawing-room, with its soft neutral tints, its collection of
  miniatures, and its great bow-fronted cabinets of family glass and silver.
  The air was fragrant with bowls of forced sweet-peas, and a small wood fire
  burned in the old-fashioned steel grate.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore wore a high-necked evening-gown of black lace and ornaments
  of old silver and jade. Her well-dressed crown of hair gleamed in the shaded
  lamp-light, as she read aloud to her husband, who was pasting stamps into his
  album. It was a picture of domestic bliss, which was anodyne to the doctor's
  nerves.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore thanked him for calling, and the lawyer said the whole
  thing was distressing. Both accepted the doctor's explanation of an overdose,
  taken by mistake, and hoped that the sad affair would soon be forgotten.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Scudamore betrayed the fact that Fear had, at least, flicked a
  single seam of his dinner jacket, in one cautious question.</p>

  <p>"What about this anonymous letter? Is the writer anyone we
  know&mdash;should you think?"</p>

  <p>The doctor's reassurance restored Darby and Joan to their former fireside
  peace.</p>

  <p>"As a medical man," he told them, "I take a pathological view of the
  writer. It's probably some hysterical woman, who is working off suppressed
  steam. It may do her good, and it will do us no harm. As for the bull's eye
  she scored, that was purely a lucky shot in the dark."</p>

  <p>But when Dr. Perry reached his home he had to face a more difficult task.
  The gracious old hall was unlighted, and looked cheerless and untidy with its
  clutter of forgotten toys. As he anticipated, he found Marianne in the
  night-nursery. She had not changed for dinner, and was still dressed in the
  creased suit of strawberry silk she had worn in Miss Corner's bedroom.</p>

  <p>Her face looked green with worry as she spoke in a husky whisper.</p>

  <p>"Horatio, she's <i>dead</i>...I didn't realise it at the time."</p>

  <p>"Yes," nodded the doctor. "I feel it, too."</p>

  <p>"No, I won't be a hypocrite," declared Marianne passionately. "I'm
  thinking of <i>them</i>."</p>

  <p>She glanced at the babies, sleeping in their opulent cots. "D'you know
  what I've been doing?" she asked. "I got out your Pass-Book and I've been
  adding up all the cheques from her that we've paid in this year...It's
  awful...We've lost our best patient."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense. We don't live by Miss Corner alone. What concerns me most is
  that I've lost a friend."</p>

  <p>Marianne did not notice her husband's drawn face as she began to pace the
  room.</p>

  <p>"I know, I know," she declared. "But it's been such a terrible day, and
  I'm frightened tonight. It seems to me&mdash;somehow&mdash;that this is the
  beginning of the end. And baby held on to my finger with his little fist.
  Just as if he was <i>asking</i> me to take care of him."</p>

  <p>As he listened to her, Dr. Perry lost his patience to the extent of
  wishing to strike a woman&mdash;a delicate attention which Marianne might
  have appreciated, as showing understanding of her special temperament. But he
  was too civilised to understand such subtleties, so he lost his
  opportunity.</p>

  <p>"You're exaggerating to a ridiculous degree," he said coldly. "When you
  consider our own favoured conditions and compare them with those
  Outside"&mdash;the whole of England was 'Outside,' to the village&mdash;"it
  amounts to sheer wicked ingratitude. Marianne, I'm ashamed of you. If
  everyone was like you no one would have the courage to have children at
  all."</p>

  <p>Then he looked into her tortured eyes and realised that she was grilling
  in her own special hell. Unable to bear the thought of the agony of her
  sleepless night, he was goaded into indiscretion.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, Marianne," he said. "<i>I</i> don't. But then I know Julia's
  death won't affect us financially. Don't mention it to anyone&mdash;but she's
  left all her money to me."</p>

  <p>The violence of Marianne's relief took the form of a tempest of tears,
  while she hugged her husband and her sleeping babies. After she had awakened
  them, the doctor left her to her just business of putting them to sleep
  again, and went downstairs to his novel.</p>

  <p>He had not been reading for long, when the door opened and Marianne stood
  looking at him, with a strange, withdrawn expression in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing." She shut the door. "Horatio, I've been in the dispensary. I've
  measured up...That was a very strong draught you gave Miss Corner."</p>

  <p>"Of course it was," he replied lightly. "She's taken so many that she
  complained they had lost their effect. I specially wanted her to have a good
  night. Besides, you could see, for yourself, she'd poured out a
  double-dose."</p>

  <p>"I know...Will there be a post-mortem?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry stared back at his wife.</p>

  <p>"My evidence would make it unnecessary, as I've been attending her
  constantly. Besides Scudamore, as Coroner, will want the minimum of
  fuss."</p>

  <p>"Of course. He'll be all for hush-hush."</p>

  <p>"<i>But</i>," went on the doctor, "in my own interest, I shall insist on
  one."</p>

  <p>"<i>Ah!</i>" Marianne's sharply released breath was almost a sob. "Will
  you do it yourself?"</p>

  <p>"In the circumstances, no. I shall get Rawlings to do it. He's a
  police-surgeon, so it should be his natural job."</p>

  <p>"Oh, darling, darling." Marianne nearly strangled him with the vehemence
  of her hug. "God alone knows how much I love my babies&mdash;and you. I shall
  sleep soundly tonight."</p>

  <p>And&mdash;behind drawn blinds&mdash;someone else looked through the
  darkness, as though it were a lighted mesh, and broke the silence with a
  laugh...Someone else&mdash;someone anonymous&mdash;passed a good night,
  cheered with the prospect of a crop of future developments...</p>

  <p>True to Dr. Perry's prediction, the inquest on Miss Corner was an affair
  of taste and discretion. As there was no unpleasant Public Institution in the
  village, it was held in the old Tithe-Barn&mdash;a beautiful Elizabethan
  building. Mr. Scudamore, as Miss Corner's solicitor, had charge of her legal
  affairs; her only two relatives&mdash;male cousins&mdash;had expressed
  regret, and the information that they would attend the funeral, presumably as
  the preliminary to the reading of her Will.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Pike, recalled from her first Continental holiday, was back at Miss
  Corner's house, getting things ready for the funeral, and later, for the
  Sale. Although overcome with sorrow, she was glad to be back in England,
  although she had only got as far as Ostend, which she disliked intensely.</p>

  <p>She never went abroad again, but she continued to judge the whole of the
  Continent from her personal experience of eight homesick hours at a Belgian
  seaport. For thus are racial prejudices implanted.</p>

  <p>Both she and May gave evidence at the inquest. May proved loyal, and
  stupid to the verge of dumbness; but the Coroner framed his questions that
  she might mutter the requisite 'yes' or 'no', which satisfied everyone.</p>

  <p>The formal identification had been followed by Dr. Perry's evidence. He
  stated that he had attended Miss Corner, who, ever since he knew her, had
  lived, practically, under sentence of death, owing to advanced heart-disease
  and high blood-pressure. He added that she would not follow medical advice
  and indulged in dangerous over-exertion. She had been engaged in strenuous
  gardening, on the evening of her death, so, had been pre-disposed to succumb
  to an overdose of veronal, which she had poured out, in error.</p>

  <p>Prominence was given to the accident of the smashed glasses, but the
  anonymous letter was touched on but lightly. Dr. Rawlings&mdash;a
  police-surgeon from a neighbouring town, gave corroborative evidence as to
  Miss Corner's state of health&mdash;a jury-man asked a question about the
  anonymous charge of intemperance brought against the local Temperance
  leader.</p>

  <p>And then&mdash;when everything was practically over Dr.
  Rawlings&mdash;recalled&mdash;-stated that the post-mortem had revealed the
  deceased to be of entirely abstemious habit. Dr. Perry bolstered up his
  testimony, while Mrs. Pike swore that her mistress drank only water, but was
  a terror for tea.</p>

  <p>Both she and May declared that there was never a drop of intoxicant kept
  in the house, even for visitors. Mrs. Pike stated that, in her opinion, the
  bottle of whisky which was concealed in the wardrobe, had probably been
  bought, by Miss Corner, in Cheltenham, in order to try a cure for insomnia,
  as her mistress hated drugs and threw most of the doctor's draughts down the
  sink.</p>

  <p>No one raised any more awkward facts, or asked tactless
  questions&mdash;and the Jury brought in a verdict of 'Death from
  Misadventure.'</p>

  <p>The funeral took place the next day, and was strictly private. Dr. Perry,
  Mr. Scudamore, Mrs. Pike and the two relatives were the only official
  mourners, although the church and graveyard were crowded. Many people sent
  their cars, and there was a large display of floral tributes.</p>

  <p>One of the cousins had obviously attended solely to mark his respect, so
  brought no flowers; but the other, who was an optimist, carried a wreath, and
  remarked that 'blood was thicker than water'&mdash;a tactless and slighting
  reference to Miss Corner's preferential campaign.</p>

  <p>The optimist's hope was slaughtered directly they returned to the house,
  and listened, in the library, to Miss Corner's Will. It was short and to the
  point. Mrs. Pike received an annuity of two pounds a week, and May a legacy
  of a hundred pounds. The residue of the estate, after payment of all debts,
  was bequeathed to Dr. Horatio Perry.</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry kept his eyes fixed on a dark-blue cube on the Persian carpet,
  so that no one might read their expression. Although he had buoyed up
  Marianne with hope, he, himself, had questioned whether Miss Corner had
  actually carried out her promise.</p>

  <p>Surcharged with relief, he asked no question as to the amount he might
  expect to receive; but Mr. Scudamore recognised the delicacy of his position,
  and whispered, "details later."</p>

  <p>The relatives consulted their watches, and Mrs. Pike served the Madeira
  and rich biscuits she considered proper to the occasion. Shortly afterwards
  the cousins left to catch their train, via the bus.</p>

  <p>When they had gone, the lawyer lit his cigar, and enlightened Dr. Perry
  with a slow and deliberate explanation of Miss Corner's financial position.
  He remarked that she had played for safety, so had invested her small private
  fortune in an annuity. In addition to this income, she made considerable sums
  of money from her writing, so that she was able to afford a lavish and
  luxurious scale of living. She also gave large contributions to charity and
  had many pensioners. It was true that there was a mortgage on the house,
  which cost many thousands to build, but her assets would exceed her
  liabilities.</p>

  <p>"All things considered, she will 'cut up' very creditably," said the
  lawyer. "She spent well, and no one will be poorer for her death. Of course,
  Perry, from your point of view, she died a few years too soon. When she made
  this Will in your favour, only four months ago, she told me that she was
  going to pay off the mortgage on the house, out of income, in order to leave
  the property clear. Still&mdash;you <i>will</i> receive the residue."</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry smiled and thanked the lawyer for his precise information.</p>

  <p>"I leave this house a richer man than I entered it," he said. "I am very
  grateful to my friend."</p>

  <p>On his homeward way, he looked rather depressed; but, in the end, his
  philosophy prevailed. It was true that he had lost his most lucrative
  patient; but, all the same, he retained the best practice in the
  district.</p>

  <p>What he dreaded most was Marianne's reception of his news. For a few days,
  she had soared in a riot of imagination. Miss Corner's death was nothing to
  her, for she had never liked the novelist. In her mind, she was nothing but
  an old stump which should be uprooted to make room for her two young
  saplings.</p>

  <p>The doctor found her in the Dispensary, engaged in counting out
  liver-pills and placing them in a small cardboard box for Miss Asprey's gaunt
  parlourmaid&mdash;Rose.</p>

  <p>She wheeled round, like a flaming comet.</p>

  <p>"How much?" she cried. "Quick, <i>quick</i>."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Scudamore thinks I may count on something in the neighbourhood of
  about two hundred pounds," he said. "Of course, it may even be a little more.
  It all depends on how much the house may fetch and on her few remaining
  Royalties."</p>

  <p>Marianne's lips gaped apart and she stared at her husband in frozen
  silence.</p>

  <p>Through the window of the dining-room the housemaid saw two ladies coming
  up the drive. She met them at the open front door. They stated their errand,
  and&mdash;at their request&mdash;she led them across the hall, to the
  Dispensary.</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry saw the crack of the opening door, too late to stem his wife's
  fury of disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Only two hundred," she screamed. "It would have paid you better to keep
  her alive."</p>

  <p>"Hush," whispered the doctor, just as Miss Asprey entered, followed by the
  faithful Miss Mack.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; UNDERGROUND</h2>

  <p class="first">THE inquest was followed by a complete dislocation of the
  social life of the village. As Miss Corner was not popular, besides
  being&mdash;according to the local standard&mdash;a new-comer, her death
  should have been only a slight interference. But no one liked to issue
  invitations from fear of refusals; so strawberries ripened to be made into
  jam, and roses bloomed only for their owners' admiration.</p>

  <p>When Miss Asprey realised that the steady stream of friendship was
  restricted to trickles&mdash;where two or three gathered together over
  private tea-tables&mdash;she made a move, for the general good. When she met
  Mrs. Scudamore, on the green, she asked her a pointed question about her
  garden. Mrs. Scudamore's reply showed understanding, for when gardens
  attained perfection, they were, so to speak, thrown open to the public.</p>

  <p>"It should be perfect next week. I suppose, Miss Asprey, yours will soon
  reach its peak?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, very soon it will be at its best. I have a new variety of
  water-iris, which I hope you will see when it blooms."</p>

  <p>"I hope so. Life must go on." Mrs. Scudamore took the plunge. "I intend to
  give a garden-party, next week."</p>

  <p>"Then we must discuss our dates, so that they do not clash," remarked Miss
  Asprey, with a smile. "I agree with you. Life <i>must</i> go on."</p>

  <p>The Rector welcomed his card of invitation to Miss Asprey's party as a
  hopeful sign that the village life was becoming normal. He was acutely
  worried over the business of the second letter, and was beginning to show
  signs of his old enemy, nerves. He was a man who never thought about health,
  and who did not recognise illness; but his crash had been so catastrophic
  that he shrank from the evidence of familiar symptoms.</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey's party really seemed an omen of happier days. There were no
  refusals, and even the Squire's tall white hat might be seen, through the
  gates, as the distinctive seal of success. It was a hot day, so that the
  ferny dampness of the garden was most acceptable. Everyone admired the new
  water-irises&mdash;a few clumps&mdash;and congratulated Miss Asprey on their
  creation.</p>

  <p>Joan Brook, who welcomed every distraction, was in excellent spirits as
  she walked perilously on the narrow rims of the small water-maze. The
  original vulgar spout of Tudor times had undergone many changes, but it
  remained faithful to the garden, either in the form of small, natural
  streams, or confined in shallow stone culverts.</p>

  <p>She looked up at the approach of little Miss Mack, in her best
  frock&mdash;printed reseda-green foulard.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Miss Brook," she asked, "when are we going to have our picnic on the
  Downs?"</p>

  <p>Joan remembered her promise to Miss Asprey, as she looked down into the
  expectant face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know when I'll be free," she said, after an awkward pause.
  "You must remember, Miss Mack, that you and I are 'Servants of the
  Private'."</p>

  <p>Miss Mack showed no sign of disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Do you call it 'servitude', when you love the person who employs you?"
  she asked.</p>

  <p>"But I don't love Lady d'Arcy," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"Don't you? She's very good to you."</p>

  <p>"What of it? <i>I</i>'m good to her."</p>

  <p>"Are you?" Miss Mack spoke with the simplicity of a child.</p>

  <p>"Miss Asprey's very good to me&mdash;but I'm not always good to her...But
  I love her very much."</p>

  <p>Joan played with the idea of arrested development, only to dismiss it as
  she looked again at Miss Mack. Apparently, she was responsible for the
  practical management of the party, and she displayed cool competency, which
  could not be reconciled with mental deficiency.</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey merely posed on a stone settle, in the shade of ancient
  mulberry trees, like an antique, but still beautiful, piece of statuary. Yet
  she was not too detached to keep her companion under constant observation.
  Joan, who was on the watch for sinister developments, ever since her walk,
  noticed this fact with a sense of discomfort.</p>

  <p>'There's something queer between those two women,' she thought.</p>

  <p>Still playing her favourite part of spectator, she remarked that this
  party seemed a complete success, although on a simpler scale than Miss
  Corner's. Vivian Sheriff, in pale pink, had annexed Major Blair, to his
  apparent content. Dr. and Mrs. Perry made a friendly quartette with the
  lawyer and his wife, as they drank tea at the same table. Even the Rector's
  face had lost some of its strain.</p>

  <p>When Ada brought her cucumber sandwiches, she welcomed her with a friendly
  smile, for Joan was fortunate in having no sense of social values.</p>

  <p>"Ada," she said, "I dare you to copy my new dress. I don't want to be
  wiped out by you again."</p>

  <p>Ada did not attempt to contradict the obvious fact of her superior beauty,
  but she did her best to make her voice sound convincing.</p>

  <p>"Well, miss, they do say there's some that prefer dark girls."</p>

  <p>"I'm not one of them," said Joan. "If I were you, Ada, I'd go straight to
  Hollywood."</p>

  <p>"All the visitors tell me that; but my girl-friend says there's a catch in
  these big wages. A lot of these film stars get about one week's work in the
  year, and all the rest of the time they've got to stick on their own
  Insurance stamps."</p>

  <p>"Your girl-friend comes from London, doesn't he?" asked Joan, who knew all
  about the Squire's chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"Yes, miss. Pimlico." Ada lowered her voice. "Have you heard about the
  doctor coming into all Miss Corner's money? Thousands and thousands of
  pounds. My girl-friend says he's been lucky, both ways."</p>

  <p>"<i>Both</i> ways? What d'you mean, Ada?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he was lucky she poured out that big overdose. Because my
  girl-friend says the <i>proper</i> dose would have bumped her off. You see,
  she's been sloshing his stuff down the drain, instead of drinking it, and he
  said, at the inquest, that he'd made this one extra strong."</p>

  <p>Joan looked thoughtful as Ada passed on with her tray.</p>

  <p>'So that's what they're saying in the village,' she thought. 'A sharp lot,
  these rustics. I wonder what our lot thinks...Poor Miss Corner.'</p>

  <p>It was odd how much she missed and regretted the noisy, good-natured
  woman. In spite of her overdone laughter and her under-exposed jokes, she was
  bracing as the East wind in her fearless contempt of local prejudice.</p>

  <p>Joan actually found herself resenting Vivian's pale pink frills, because
  they reminded her of poor Miss Corner's party frock. She was gazing, quite
  mournfully, at the grating through which the brown brook-water was pouring,
  under a low arch hung with dripping hart's tongues, when the Rector spoke to
  her.</p>

  <p>"What are you watching so intently?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Joan. "I'm just fascinated by the idea of the underground
  stream which must be flowing somewhere under the garden. You see, it
  disappears through this grating and it doesn't come up again until it reaches
  the pool. Hidden things are so thrilling. I do wonder just exactly where it
  is."</p>

  <p>"The doctor could tell you. He claims to be a water diviner."</p>

  <p>"That would appeal to <i>him</i>," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't to me," snorted the Rector. "I hate all underground
  things."</p>

  <p>Joan noticed that since his face had grown thin, his nose appeared beakier
  and his nostrils more arrogant. With the first signs of ill health, the Roman
  Emperor was more in evidence, while the anonymous plebeian lady was retiring
  into the background.</p>

  <p>"I've seen you looking fitter," she remarked, with typical British
  understatement. "Been dreaming again?"</p>

  <p>"Surely I've never bored you with my dreams? What a rotten cad to
  victimise a poor helpless girl."</p>

  <p>"Well, <i>have</i> you been fighting again with your unknown man?"
  persisted Joan.</p>

  <p>"I have," admitted the Rector. "Several times, in fact. Only&mdash;I'm not
  quite certain that it is a man."</p>

  <p>He was led on, by the interest in Joan's eyes, to further confidence.</p>

  <p>"Of course, there's a simple explanation of every dream. When I woke up
  last night I was wound up in the sheets, like a cocoon. So, naturally, when I
  dreamed I was struggling with this unseen lady&mdash;or gentleman&mdash;I
  felt a sensation of ghastly pressure, as though I were being slowly coiled to
  death."</p>

  <p>Joan burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>"Well, don't let it get you down," she said. "You only want your dream
  explained in a scientific way. Why don't you ask the saintly Miss Asprey to
  tackle the job?"</p>

  <p>To her surprise and annoyance, the Rector turned away.</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind, I will go and talk to her," he said.</p>

  <p>Joan bit her lip as she watched his tall figure bent in homage over Miss
  Asprey's seat. It seemed incredible&mdash;but she thought she detected that
  glint in the mystic's eyes which is always present when one woman takes
  another woman's man.</p>

  <p>Like the most successful diplomatists of history, the Rector had
  discovered that a queen likes to be treated as a woman; his voice was
  deferential, but his eyes were more independent, as he sank by her side.</p>

  <p>"At last," he said. "I've been waiting for a chance to find you
  alone."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey's smile accepted his tribute; and, as she talked to him of her
  water-irises, Helen Wills-Moody, the Gold Standard, the souls of animals, and
  how to steam peas in lettuce leaves, he insensibly lost his gloom. Presently
  Miss Asprey commented on his looks with the sympathy which Joan had denied
  him.</p>

  <p>"You're worried," she said. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"I'm in a funk." The big man spoke like a schoolboy. "A man of my weight,
  with nerves. I'm terribly ashamed. But&mdash;the truth is&mdash;I'm
  positively dreading another anonymous letter."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey was looking at the place where the stream reappeared after
  looking through the darkness of its underground channel. Although actually
  the same dark-brown current that had stolen through the grating, it now
  spouted out, in silver spray, into a shallow flower-ringed pool.</p>

  <p>Unlike Joan, who found mystery in its unknown course, she welcomed it back
  to the light. To the Rector there was something symbolic about the different
  mental attitudes.</p>

  <p>"You need not fear another letter," said Miss Asprey. "I am certain there
  will never be one."</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that?" asked the Rector eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;the writer is dead."</p>

  <p>Her reply gave the Rector a shock of surprise.</p>

  <p>"You mean," he asked, "that Miss Corner wrote that letter to herself?"</p>

  <p>"That is my conviction."</p>

  <p>"But why? <i>Why?</i>"</p>

  <p>"Because it was obvious to her that she was suspected of writing the first
  letter. <i>My</i> wretched letter...It was most regrettable that the secret
  ever leaked out. Of course, I don't suspect <i>you</i> of breach of
  faith&mdash;but someone overheard us...The effects were fatal to her. But it
  was all sheer bad luck. For, if she had not poured out that overdose, it
  would have all blown over, with time."</p>

  <p>The Rector was impatient at being side-tracked.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe," he asked, "that she thought it would draw suspicion off
  herself, if she, in turn, was a supposed victim of this anonymous pest?"</p>

  <p>"I am certain of it. She did not have a high opinion of the local
  intellects."</p>

  <p>"But have you grounds for your belief?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally. I was at school with Julia Corner. An intelligent child, in
  eternal gym tunic, with fat, black-stockinged legs. Even then, she was proud
  of using words not in general circulation. 'Decrescent' was one of her
  favourites, then, and it has remained so ever since."</p>

  <p>"I see." The Rector lowered his voice, as he instinctively raised his arm
  to prevent a money-spider, which was running over his sleeve, from deserting
  him. "But whatever induced her to mention the&mdash;whisky?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, poor Julia." Miss Asprey's voice was compassionate. "That was her
  fatal sense of humour. We both know she never drank spirits. She bought that
  bottle, secretly, purely as a medicine for insomnia. But I can imagine how it
  appealed to her sense of the ridiculous when she hid it in her wardrobe. Of
  course, she never counted on its being discovered after her death.
  Because&mdash;she never expected to die."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure of that," declared the Rector. "Miss Corner loved life too well
  to commit suicide."</p>

  <p>Both became silent, lest one thought should seem to suggest another; for,
  although Dr. Perry's legacy&mdash;of unknown value&mdash;was the chief topic
  of conversation in the village, neither would mention it, from some remote
  fear that it might appear too apposite.</p>

  <p>For this was not the usual sleepy-pear conversation of social convention,
  but the friction of two keen minds, when the unspoken word is more
  significant than speech. The money-spider ran on to Miss Asprey's dress, and
  the Rector let it go, unnoticed, as he frowned in the garden.</p>

  <p>"Unconvinced?" asked Miss Asprey.</p>

  <p>"I'm weighing it up," replied the Rector. "You see, I want to accept your
  theory. That puts me on my guard."</p>

  <p>"I understand. And something else." Miss Asprey gave a wintry smile.
  "Naturally, you think of me as an old woman, who has grown mentally lazy, in
  retreat. But, like yourself, I've stood in the thick of the fight, when I was
  up against every kind of character&mdash;weak, warped, or vicious. I had to
  be prepared for emergencies, and make lightning decisions. So my mind was
  always just one leap ahead of the person I was dealing with. You may not
  believe it, my friend, but I retain that mental habit."</p>

  <p>The Rector shed the scepticism with which he had first listened to her
  gentle boasting as he realised that during their conversation, she had really
  anticipated his own thoughts. Had she greeted him with sympathy, he would
  have assured her of his complete fitness, and changed the subject. But her
  trivial gossip had paved the way for his confidence.</p>

  <p>However, he would not give in to her, altogether.</p>

  <p>"There is one flaw in your argument," he said. "If Miss Corner was known
  to be fond of the word 'decrescent', others, besides yourself, must have
  noticed the fact."</p>

  <p>He was startled by Miss Asprey's reaction to his theory. The calm of her
  face was shattered by unfamiliar distorting lines, and a dusky red stained
  the ivory of her skin.</p>

  <p>"<i>No</i>." Her voice rang with suppressed passion. "That would be too
  horrible. It would mean that one of our friends is a&mdash;a maggot in our
  minds, eating our thoughts&mdash;boring into our intimate secrets, just to
  betray them out of sheer mental cruelty."</p>

  <p>"Please, <i>please</i>," urged the Rector. "Of course, I meant nothing of
  the kind."</p>

  <p>He sank his voice as Joan Brook strolled across the lawn. Apparently she
  was not within earshot of the pair, but her hearing was remarkably keen, so
  that she managed to catch a sentence uttered by Miss Asprey.</p>

  <p>"I would mean that someone <i>here</i> is a secret sadist."</p>

  <p>Joan's face lit up with interest, for the words awoke a memory of a
  fairy-tale Tudor village, flushed in sunset afterglow, and an incredible
  serial told upon a green, of lurid lantern-slides thrown on the screen behind
  drawn blinds.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; SICK FLOWERS OF SECRECY</h2>

  <p class="first">AS Miss Asprey's garden-party had been a success, Mrs.
  Scudamore was the more surprised and upset when the answers to her own
  invitations began to arrive at the Clock House. Among the acceptances were so
  many important refusals that she consulted her lawyer, who was, incidentally,
  her husband.</p>

  <p>Mr. Scudamore, who felt the situation as keenly as herself, told her what
  she must do.</p>

  <p>"But, love," she said, "we've never put off a party before."</p>

  <p>"Then, we must create a precedent, my sweetheart," her husband told her.
  "If we don't, we risk a failure. That would be a new experience for us,
  too."</p>

  <p>"You're right, as always, love. But I insist on this. The cards must be
  printed."</p>

  <p>It was thus that Mrs. Scudamore formalised her panic policy, when she sent
  out her printed regrets, cancelling her party, owing to a family
  bereavement.</p>

  <p>The Rector was not sorry when he received his intimation, since
  entertainments at the Clock House were rather formal. He did not know that
  the card he tossed so gladly into the waste-paper basket, signified the last
  nail in the coffin of village hospitality, for he had regained his former
  good spirits.</p>

  <p>Since his sub-conscious mind had ceased to harry him, he was no longer
  plagued with his recurrent dream. After he had thought 'all round' Miss
  Asprey's theory, he accepted it. Because she had to wear the halo which the
  village had hung over her, it did not alter the fact that she was the same
  woman who had held, for years, a post which called for both administrative
  and executive powers. Time had not clouded her brain nor diminished her
  energy.</p>

  <p>It was certain that poor Miss Corner had written her own anonymous letter,
  so, with her death, the visitation was at an end. At its worst, it was but
  the flicker of a slightly disordered mind. And yet the Rector felt as though
  some unclean thing had been buried at the crossroads, with a stake driven
  through its heart.</p>

  <p>The weather continued perfect, so he worked off his surplus energy on the
  links, and in digging up a crippled parishioner's garden. After a happy and
  sweaty afternoon of planting, in the cool of the evening he walked across the
  wide waving fields, to have dinner at the Hall.</p>

  <p>Life seemed specially good to him, just then, and he was in excellent
  spirits during the meal, for he liked the Squire and his family, and also his
  guests, who told smoking-room stories before him, and took his amusement for
  granted. He had often played golf with Major Blair&mdash;who was a man of
  typical sporting cut, and usually accepted as handsome, on account of a good
  build.</p>

  <p>His small, good-natured eyes were slightly piggy, and they puckered into
  slits when he laughed. About half-way through the meal he began to twinkle
  with amusement.</p>

  <p>"Oh, before I forget it," he said, "did any of you get letters, too?"</p>

  <p>The Rector's heart gave a sharp knock as Major Blair went on to
  explain.</p>

  <p>"I mean, an anonymous letter. I got mine, yesterday, printed like a kid's
  writing, warning me that my awful past was known and that I'd soon be for
  it."</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul," rapped out the Squire. "What are you doing about it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Tore it up. Of course, I've done all the usual things. I should
  hope so, indeed. But no one would blackmail me, and get away with it. I'm not
  that sort of ruddy fool."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," remarked the Squire. "Treat these pests with contempt."</p>

  <p>"I always think," said a lady, who claimed to have original opinions,
  "that if you don't think of unpleasant things, you can make yourself think
  they've not happened. And then, they <i>haven't</i>."</p>

  <p>"Then you've got that fiver I refused you today," said her husband.</p>

  <p>A wave of laughter rippled round the table. The arrival of gooseberry-fool
  reminded Mrs. Sheriff of a local lady who had worn gooseberry-green at a
  wedding, and she asked if anyone had seen the social page of a certain
  newspaper. The episode was over.</p>

  <p>But it left the Rector badly shaken. Miss Corner was dead. He, himself,
  had consigned her body to dust. Yet the evil lived on.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he remembered Mrs. Scudamore's cancelled party, and he wondered
  if there was any connection between it and Major Blair's anonymous letter.
  His heart hammered, and his head began to swim at a new and horrible
  possibility.</p>

  <p>He asked himself whether others in the village had also received
  poison-letters, but had kept their own secrets. As he looked round the
  dinner-table, he fancied that some of the faces appeared self-conscious, or
  too composed, as though they were on their guard.</p>

  <p>Then he shook off his suspicion. This was a typical dinner-party, of the
  more jovial brand. When the meal was over they played idiotic balancing-games
  in the drawing-room, so that the Rector shed his morbid fancies in his own,
  and his neighbours', undignified sprawls on the carpet.</p>

  <p>He walked home under the starlight, smoking the Squire's excellent cigar;
  and he felt at peace with the world, until he passed the churchyard, where
  Fear was lurking behind the stones. That cold breath upon his cheek reminded
  him that it was characteristic of the village not to ventilate any personal
  unpleasantness.</p>

  <p>'The only way to fight this evil is to come out into the open,' he
  thought. 'But, if they refuse to talk we're beaten.'</p>

  <p>His housekeeper had lit his lamps in the study and put out the tantalus,
  ready for his return. The faithful spaniel, Charles, guarded the
  biscuit-barrel with his last drop of blood. The Rector fed him, and exchanged
  gossip, while he reached for a letter upon the mantel-piece.</p>

  <p>The next second, he felt winded, as though someone had hit him a violent
  blow below the belt. The address was printed in the familiar Roman
  characters, and, as he tore open the envelope, he noticed the characteristic
  good quality of the paper. The letter consisted of two short sentences.</p>

  <p>'Your turn will come. I know all your past life.'</p>

  <p>The Rector sank back in his chair and poured himself out a stiff drink.
  Not until he had actually experienced it for himself had he realised the
  demoralising effect of an anonymous letter.</p>

  <p>Since houses are not made of glass, nearly every life must hold a few
  shaded episodes&mdash;indiscretions, or occasions for remorse, in the absence
  of actual sin. Once in a lifetime even the mildest parish-worker will flame
  with the fires of some primitive lust, and the eyes of the primmest curate's
  wife betray their memories of Babylon.</p>

  <p>The letter made the Rector supremely uncomfortable, and it also made him
  think furiously, as he raked among the ashes of his past. He had entered the
  Church after a conversion which had run on parallel lines with St. Paul's.
  During his 'Saul' phase, he had had a good time, which had been very bad, and
  which had helped him, later, to his complete understanding and success with
  prostitutes and drunks.</p>

  <p>But although he alternatively grinned and sweated, as he resurrected each
  discreditable incident&mdash;reviving the memory of his hefty spade-work
  while digging a merry pathway to hell&mdash;in the end, he wiped his face
  with a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Like Major Blair, he had done only 'the usual things', so did not fear
  blackmail. And, like the Major, he tore up the letter and threw the scraps
  into the grate.</p>

  <p>The Rector spent the next few days in a round of parochial visits. He did
  not call on his poor parishioners, whose society he really enjoyed, but rang
  the bells of only the big houses. In nearly every case, his hostess was at
  home to him; but his worst suspicions were confirmed.</p>

  <p>There was a complete stoppage of all social intercourse. He met no other
  casual caller in any drawing room. The village was dead, with the paralysis
  which follows the generation of poison.</p>

  <p>Very soon, he found that he was growing affected by the general complaint.
  In the middle of some friendly chat, he would suddenly remember his anonymous
  letter, look up into a smiling face, and wonder 'Is it <i>you?</i>'</p>

  <p>His chance came on Sunday, when he literally thundered from his pulpit. It
  must be confessed he rather enjoyed himself, as he denounced, in particular,
  the secret enemy, who exuded venom, and the congregation, in general, for
  being accessories after the fact.</p>

  <p>His fine organ voice rose up to the Norman arches and sank down to the
  vaults; he begged for a confidential visit, in his vestry, or a letter giving
  an instance of personal attack.</p>

  <p>Except for a liberal collection in aid of something with a lot of
  initials, his sermon had no effect. The clot in the village circulation
  refused, obstinately, to be dislodged.</p>

  <p>In despair, the Rector decided to call on the Squire, as his most
  important parishioner, and to ask his advice. When he reached the Hall, he
  found the great man in the library, very sorry for himself, with a bright
  blue patch on his cheek.</p>

  <p>"Bee," he said, regrettably repeating his explanation. "A <i>bee</i> bee.
  Stung me, when my wife was taking the swarm. I was only looking on, too. Odd.
  My wife would run from a rabbit, yet she's got those confounded bees eating
  out of her hand."</p>

  <p>He was still talking of his wife's freak courage, when the sandy little
  lady, herself, entered, to enquire about her husband's stung cheek.</p>

  <p>She greeted the Rector with rather a scared expression in her pale blue
  eyes, for she had heard his last sermon.</p>

  <p>"Any fresh trouble?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"What trouble?" boomed the Squire.</p>

  <p>The Rector explained the general situation and appealed to the Squire.</p>

  <p>"My feeling is," he said, "that this thing must be stopped. So I came to
  consult you."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," declared the Squire. "It's a matter for the police. I'll
  put Sergeant James on the job. He will watch the pillar-boxes and all
  that."</p>

  <p>"Yes, the police are up to all the dodges. But I was just wondering.
  Suppose the writer is a woman?"</p>

  <p>"Probably is. The place is stiff with them."</p>

  <p>"Exactly." The Rector still looked doubtful. "But do you like the idea of
  arresting a woman? I don't. May I suggest an alternative?"</p>

  <p>"Fire away."</p>

  <p>"I have a friend, Ignatius Brown, one of the idle rich. He rather fancies
  himself as Sherlock Holmes. He's not so clever as he thinks he is, but he's
  keen, and he should be more than a match for anyone here. Shall I ask him
  down."</p>

  <p>"No," said the Squire. "We don't want any amateurs. I'll instruct
  James."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he caught his wife's eye. Her lips were pursed and she first
  nodded violently and then shook her head vehemently.</p>

  <p>The Squire knew, from experience, how to interpret these conflicting
  signals, for, suddenly, he changed his mind.</p>

  <p>"All right, then," he said. "Suppose you write to your friend?"</p>

  <p>When the Rector had gone, the Squire turned to his wife. Although he
  usually bullied her, there were times when he followed her advice; for, if
  the Squire had no positive virtues, he had some rather good faults.</p>

  <p>"What the hell did you butt in for, Katie?" he asked pleasantly.</p>

  <p>Little Miss Sheriff caught hold of her big husband by the buttonhole, as
  unceremoniously as though he were one of her bees.</p>

  <p>"Osbert," she said, "whatever you do, <i>don't</i> call in the
  police."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because, dear, I'm not sure it would be wise...I don't understand these
  things, myself, but poor Miss Corner used to talk to me about inhibitions.
  Some times, they may take very funny forms."</p>

  <p>The Squire's blue patch looked purple as his face grew red with anger.</p>

  <p>"What the dickens are you driving at?" he shouted. "<i>Who</i> suffers
  from inhibitions?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I'm sure I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you do. You're hiding something. Is it anyone in this house?"</p>

  <p>"No one. <i>No one</i>."</p>

  <p>Little Mrs. Sheriff's eyes were suffused with tears, and she almost
  screamed her denial. But the poison of the letters had spread, for she looked
  around her, and then lowered her voice.</p>

  <p>"Osbert, I sometimes wonder if we were wise when we wouldn't let Vivian
  marry young Belson. After all, he <i>was</i> killed in the War, so we
  shouldn't have been drawn in with his family."</p>

  <p>"Stop hinting," roared the Squire, "and tell me what you really
  think."</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Mrs. Sheriff stooped down and kissed a roll of her
  husband's red neck.</p>

  <p>"Dear," she whispered, "I don't know <i>what</i> to think. But, please,
  please, don't call in the police. I'm afraid of what mud they might stir
  up."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE TWITCH OF THE TWIG</h2>

  <p class="first">AS the Rector had anticipated, Ignatius was prompt to accept
  his invitation. He arrived, in his Lanchester, about noon, when the thatched
  cottages were stewing in sunshine and the honeybees sipping from clove-pinks
  and monkey-musk. He viewed the vista of Tudor architecture from the study
  window, and expressed approval.</p>

  <p>"A beautiful spot. I may come here to live, when I retire from the
  complicated business of doing nothing...In fact, by merely looking out of
  this window, I rather think I've solved part of your little problem."</p>

  <p>The Rector smiled at the familiar adjective, 'little', which Ignatius
  always applied to the concerns of others.</p>

  <p>His friend was very short and slight; at a distance, his insignificant
  figure suggested a schoolboy&mdash;but this impression was dispelled by a
  first glance at his face, which was lined, and acutely intelligent.
  Also&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;he did not suffer from any inferiority
  complex.</p>

  <p>The Rector agreed with his praise of the village, even while he
  sighed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's perfect. No one leaves the village, except to die."</p>

  <p>Ignatius glanced at his friend's troubled face. Then he used the old
  College name, as he patted the big man's shoulder with mingled affection and
  patronage.</p>

  <p>"Cheer up, Tigger. Suppose you tell me all about your little trouble."</p>

  <p>"<i>Little?</i>" The Rector exploded. "Man, it's not little. It's like
  some canker eating at the roots of a healthy organism."</p>

  <p>"Exactly&mdash;how?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Fear</i>. Everyone suspects his neighbour. Social intercourse is being
  destroyed."</p>

  <p>"Good thing too. That's just another name for scandal."</p>

  <p>"No, Ignatius, not here. This is&mdash;this was&mdash;a perfect place."
  The Rector began to pace the study as he burst into a vehement tirade.</p>

  <p>"I want you to try to realise what this village means to me. I used to be
  a materialist. For years I worked in a sink of iniquity where both men and
  women appeared vile. Oh, I know a finer spirit would have seen flashes of the
  Light. But I saw none. I just plugged away at the evil. Then, after I
  crashed, I came here...And I received new vision. An Ideal. I found
  <i>regeneration</i>."</p>

  <p>He broke off with a shame-faced laugh.</p>

  <p>"Sorry. I forgot I'm not in my pulpit. But I'm really in great
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"A few harmless unsigned letters. Tut-tut. Suppose you give me their full
  history."</p>

  <p>Ignatius did not appear to listen while the Rector was talking. Apparently
  he was more interested in blowing smoke-rings. But at the end of the tale he
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"Good. I have the facts. I gather this village has a stagnant population
  of life-residents. But I suppose you get occasional new-comers? Who's the
  latest?"</p>

  <p>The Rector bit his lip.</p>

  <p>"A Miss Brook," he replied. "She's companion to Lady d'Arcy, and she's
  been here for a few months only."</p>

  <p>"And the letters have been written since her arrival?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But she's a charming girl&mdash;nice and clean-minded. No one could
  suspect her."</p>

  <p>"Of course not. It's obvious that she is the last person to be
  suspected."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked the Rector, in surprise, although his face cleared.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you attach any significance to my remark that, by merely looking
  out of the window, I'd solved half your problem?" Ignatius spoke in an acid
  voice. "I don't talk for effect. Directly I realised the beauty of the
  village, I knew that it was a partner in crime with your anonymous
  letter-writer. For it is so lovely that, as you remarked&mdash;you see,
  <i>I</i> remember&mdash;no one voluntarily leaves it."</p>

  <p>"But is that harmful? Our ancestors didn't travel, and they did very
  well."</p>

  <p>"Who told you that? You only know they're dead. Keep fowls too long on the
  same bit of soil, and it sours. The same applies to human beings. It's not
  good to become root-bound."</p>

  <p>"I don't agree. I could give you instances of people who have never left
  their homes, and who lead happy, useful lives."</p>

  <p>"I grant you that," said Ignatius. "But you, in turn, must concede to me
  the exception, who would be adversely affected. Remember, I'm here to deal
  with an exceptional case. Suppose you tell me&mdash;if you can&mdash;who has
  lived longest here, without going away?"</p>

  <p>The Rector thought for a minute.</p>

  <p>"When I said people never go away, I meant very rarely," he explained.
  "One family&mdash;the Martins of the Towers&mdash;have been away nearly two
  years, globe-trotting."</p>

  <p>He spoke casually, little dreaming the importance of the return of the
  absentee family, as he answered his friend's question.</p>

  <p>"Only the other day someone remarked to me that she's not slept under a
  strange roof for nearly thirty years."</p>

  <p>"Then, <i>that's</i> your suspect." The little man's voice was triumphant.
  "Who is she?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Asprey. The first person to receive an anonymous letter. And,
  certainly, the last person in the world, to write one."</p>

  <p>"I must be judge of that," said Ignatius. "I shall have the lady under
  special observation."</p>

  <p>He drew out his note-book and screwed his monocle tighter.</p>

  <p>"You've stated, that from the evidence of good-quality paper, correct
  spelling, and accurate intimate knowledge, that this pest must belong to your
  own little social circle," he said. "Now I want to know their names, and all
  the information you can give me about them, especially about Miss
  Asprey."</p>

  <p>The Rector&mdash;who did not know shorthand&mdash;was impressed by the
  dots and dashes with which his friend covered pages of his note-book.
  Ignatius&mdash;who did not know shorthand, either&mdash;had counted on making
  this effect. He guessed accurately that the Rector would rank an ordinary
  Commercial-College accomplishment higher than his own exceptional memory.</p>

  <p>"I want to meet all these people as soon as possible," he said. "You must
  give a party."</p>

  <p>"No one would come."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, some typical country entertainment." Ignatius shut his eyes
  and snapped his fingers, as though summoning some elusive memory. "Wait. A
  dim shaded light. The temperature of a furnace. Smell of hot mashed grass and
  peaches. Dahlias stuck into squares of cardboard. Give it a name."</p>

  <p>"You mean a flower-show." The Rector shook his head. "Too early."</p>

  <p>"Then there's no help for it. I must go to church. Draw me a diagram of
  the important pews and name them, like a theatre-plan."</p>

  <p>The Rector obediently sketched a rough plan, although he disliked the
  secular comparison.</p>

  <p>"I usually have a full muster," he said. "So you'll see most of my
  parishioners before the Service begins."</p>

  <p>"All of them," corrected Ignatius. "They'll come to see <i>me</i>."</p>

  <p>The Rector grinned, and then his eyes grew grave. "Ignatius," he said,
  "this thing's far worse than you suspect. May I rely on your help?"</p>

  <p>"No. Help implies a division of labour. But&mdash;you can leave it all to
  me."</p>

  <p>Stooping to pat the dog, Ignatius addressed it in a humbler voice.</p>

  <p>"Charles Dickens, I'm only a little man. But don't they ever give
  <i>you</i> lunch?"</p>

  <p>The Rector leaped to the bell, full of regrets for his lack of
  hospitality. Although his friend was accustomed to the cookery of expert
  chefs, he thoroughly enjoyed the simple meal. At the end of it he insisted on
  sending for the housekeeper, to offer his congratulations. A little later, he
  fell asleep, on the lawn.</p>

  <p>When tea was finished, he re-opened his campaign.</p>

  <p>"I propose a tour of the village. You must stop everyone we meet.
  Introduce them to me, but do the talking, so that I shall be free to
  observe."</p>

  <p>The Rector's eye lit up at a sudden memory.</p>

  <p>"Just come and see the church, first," he said.</p>

  <p>As he had expected, Joan Brook was doing the Altar flowers, for Lady
  d'Arcy. He noticed, at once, that Ignatius and Joan were mutually impressed;
  their eyes met in a long intent look, as though each were appraising the
  other.</p>

  <p>Then Joan, with characteristic rashness, spoke too quickly. "You've come
  down about the letters?"</p>

  <p>Ignatius threw the Rector a reproachful look.</p>

  <p>"Did you tell her that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He didn't," said Joan hastily. "Only, a long time ago, he told me about
  you."</p>

  <p>"You see, someone else has a memory besides yourself," remarked the
  Rector, who was obviously proud of Joan's penetration.</p>

  <p>"I see that someone has a memory for <i>your</i> remarks," said Ignatius.
  "How far back does your memory go, Miss Brook?"</p>

  <p>"Goodness knows. My most vivid memory is pinching money from my mummy's
  purse."</p>

  <p>"Mine is of fighting a baby smaller than myself," said Ignatius. "I
  suppose I was about eleven months old, but it was a gorgeous sensation. I
  lost sight of that infant, so I go through life, looking for someone smaller
  than myself, to lick."</p>

  <p>Joan's laugh rang out too loudly, considering that she was in church, so
  the Rector did his best about it.</p>

  <p>"My earliest memory," he said gravely, "is of sitting on my dad's knee, in
  the firelight, while he told me stories."</p>

  <p>"But he wouldn't be old then," remarked Joan. "Were they angel
  stories?"</p>

  <p>"No. The Dick Turpin kind. I suppose they came under the category of
  crime."</p>

  <p>Even as the Rector smiled, he stiffened again. Ignatius, who responded to
  a mental atmosphere, was conscious of a slight recoil, like a sensitive plant
  which has been touched by a rough finger.</p>

  <p>He watched, with interest, as Dr. Perry walked up the aisle to be
  introduced, in his turn, to the visitor.</p>

  <p>"Here's the lucky man," said the Rector, literally scooping up heartiness.
  "He's just come into a fortune."</p>

  <p>"So I'm told," remarked Dr. Perry, almost inaudibly.</p>

  <p>"Are you going all round the world?" asked Joan enviously. "<i>I</i>
  would."</p>

  <p>"I may pass from this world to the next, but, at present, I don't
  contemplate going round it."</p>

  <p>"But, aren't you terribly excited?" persisted Joan.</p>

  <p>"Too soon. The estate will take a long time to wind up. Probably, the
  house won't sell. Property's a drug in the market."</p>

  <p>"When it does," said the Rector, "I want a new peal of bells from
  you."</p>

  <p>"I'll remember, padre." The doctor's professional glance marked the
  Rector's bagged eyes and sunken face. "Still fussing over this absurd
  letter-business?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I admit, I'm worried."</p>

  <p>"Don't. Remember the Arab proverb&mdash;'It is but for a night, oh
  Muleteer'."</p>

  <p>For a man who had just come into a fortune, the doctor's smile was
  strangely wistful.</p>

  <p>"I want to consult you about a convalescent case in the village, padre,"
  he said. "I think, between us, we ought to manage a change to the
  seaside."</p>

  <p>As the doctor and Rector drew apart, Ignatius, who was examining a mural
  tablet, spoke in an undertone to Joan.</p>

  <p>"That doctor has an arresting face. It's almost spiritual. That is how our
  husky friend, the padre, should look."</p>

  <p>His comparison did not make him popular with Joan, who glared at him.</p>

  <p>"I don't agree. I like a man to look like a <i>man</i>."</p>

  <p>"Do you estimate manhood in terms of stones and inches?" asked Ignatius
  bleakly.</p>

  <p>Joan's slip was unintentional, for she bit her lip and began to talk too
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"I love the doctor. I'm never ill, but he gave me gas when I had a tooth
  out. I swore horribly, and kicked him in the face. He was really sweet about
  it. He said I was only a bit amusing...I think it's foul the way people are
  putting the letter on him."</p>

  <p>Ignatius' alert expression was like that of a pointing dog.</p>

  <p>"So he's the latest suspect?" he murmured. "I wonder why?"</p>

  <p>"I should say it was obvious," said Joan. "People say the
  letters&mdash;all except Miss Asprey's&mdash;show intimate personal
  knowledge. And, you see, a doctor's got a sort of privileged position."</p>

  <p>"Only, there's another man who has better&mdash;and more
  numerous&mdash;opportunities to watch people's houses, and their owners, when
  they're off guard," observed Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"The window-cleaner."</p>

  <p>"But there's not one in the village. The gardeners or chauffeurs clean the
  windows."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Ignatius, "I suppose I mustn't deprive you of the
  doctor."</p>

  <p>Joan resented the slight inflection of scorn in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Not me," she said. "Not I, or whatever it is. Dr. Perry is far too fine
  for that sort of thing. An anonymous letter-writer must have a mind like
  mud."</p>

  <p>Because contradiction was second nature to Ignatius, he had to put Joan in
  her place.</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily," he told her. "I know a very nice man whose employer
  kept his dog on the chain. Now this man dared not make an open complaint, as
  he had a wife and family dependent on him. So he wrote, anonymously, to his
  employer, telling him that his conduct was the scandal of the
  neighbourhood&mdash;with no detriment to himself, and excellent results for
  the dog."</p>

  <p>Joan merely smiled as she collected her belongings.</p>

  <p>"Say 'good-bye', for me, to the padre," she said, glancing towards the
  west door, where the Rector was parting from the doctor.</p>

  <p>The Rector waited until they reached the green before he spoke to his
  friend about Joan.</p>

  <p>"What d'you think of her?" he asked casually.</p>

  <p>"She's interesting," was the reply. "Although she doesn't pluck her brows,
  her eyes have that slightly Oriental look. She'd go straight up&mdash;or
  down&mdash;as the case may be. No half measures about that young lady."</p>

  <p>"You mean, she has both courage and character?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Ignatius changed the subject. "I'm grateful to you, Tigger, for
  putting me on to your little problem. I'm in the position of a water-diviner.
  I hold my twig over buried human nature. And I never know when it is going to
  twitch."</p>

  <p>He stopped, arrested by the sight of the beautiful Elizabethan
  manor&mdash;'The Spout'. The tall iron-work gates were open, so that they had
  a clear view of a tall, gracious lady, with a strip of white Spanish lace
  over her silver hair, and a little dumpy woman&mdash;who&mdash;in spite of
  the heat&mdash;wore a grey woollen jersey.</p>

  <p>"Miss Asprey and her companion," whispered the Rector.</p>

  <p>"A charming picture," said Ignatius. "Things are often not what they seem
  on the surface. So, I'm going to presume, that the tall patrician lady is the
  companion, and the little plebeian the mistress of the house."</p>

  <p>"Wrong," the Rector told him. "In my perfect village, appearances are
  <i>not</i> deceptive. Come on."</p>

  <p>But Ignatius lingered, to gaze at the garden.</p>

  <p>"So that is Miss Asprey," he murmured. "To my mind, Tigger, that is a
  situation ripe with possibilities. Two women living together&mdash;one on
  top, the other below. One rich, the other poor. One in the power of the
  other."</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean?" asked the Rector irritably. "Are you referring to the
  fact that Miss Asprey pays Miss Mack a salary?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. She pays her to be bullied."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish. Miss Asprey's a delightful and considerate employer. And even
  supposing&mdash;for the sake of argument&mdash;that she was not, Miss Mack is
  a free agent. At a moment's notice she could pack up and go."</p>

  <p>Ignatius walked on, frowning at the vista of Tudor cottages.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "she could leave, provided that her willpower was not
  sapped. Sometimes, the prisoner will stay in his cell, after the door is
  unlocked, because the wish to escape is dead."</p>

  <p>"Ignatius," remarked the Rector, "for a clever man, you are talking like a
  fool."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Ignatius. "But remember, I have to consider every
  likely&mdash;and unlikely&mdash;contingency. And I want you to remember what
  I say now. <i>If</i> the key to your problem lies in that special house, then
  the situation is very grim indeed."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; ROMEO FROM LONDON</h2>

  <p class="first">IGNATIUS proved a true prophet, for curiosity drew the
  village, in bulk, to church, the next morning. The important visitor proved a
  disappointing spectacle, looking more insignificant than usual, as he slumped
  down in his seat, in an apparent wish to escape notice.</p>

  <p>As the Service proceeded, however, the frostbitten little man thawed
  visibly, and he began to display interest in Miss Asprey's pew. Some among
  the congregation noticed, with amusement, that his attention had been
  attracted by Miss Asprey's housemaid.</p>

  <p>Ada looked beautiful in the plain white dress which her mistress decreed
  as the correct wear for Church; moreover, she had no competition, for she sat
  between Miss Asprey and Miss Mack.</p>

  <p>Although her sea-blue eyes looked demure, she was up to every move of the
  game, and knew exactly when to drop her prayer-book, and where to pitch it.
  Ignatius gave himself away completely, for he leaped instantly across the
  aisle, to pick it up.</p>

  <p>In order to return it, he had to stretch across Miss Mack; but she
  appeared unconscious of the incident, while Miss Asprey never relaxed a
  muscle. She sat, rigid as a statue, with her hands tightly clasped and her
  austere lips set in concentrated meditation.</p>

  <p>The Rector's sermon was both dramatic and sincere, but Ignatius was
  unmoved by its appeal and deaf to his friend's elocution, as he sat, looking
  at Ada, as though thanking Heaven for the gift of a beautiful face.</p>

  <p>He was abstracted and silent during lunch, and, after the meal was over,
  he went out to walk on the village green. As he stood by the gates of 'The
  Spout', Ada appeared, in her legitimate Sunday finery&mdash;a long frilled
  frock of yellow floral voile, printed with marigolds and a large flopping
  hat&mdash;both copied from an Ascot photograph in the <i>Daily Mail</i>.</p>

  <p>She did not seem surprised to see Ignatius, who made the conventional
  opening gambit.</p>

  <p>"Haven't we met before?"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't born yesterday," remarked Ada instantly.</p>

  <p>"I see that you are as sensible as you are pretty," said Ignatius. "As a
  sensible man, myself, I dislike the company of fools."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you're so sensible, you'll know <i>you</i> haven't an earthly
  chance with me," was Ada's pert comment.</p>

  <p>Ignatius did his best to appear humble, but failed.</p>

  <p>"I admit I'm not much to look at," he told her, "but I have quite an
  impressive car."</p>

  <p>"I know. Lanchester." Ada's eyes sparkled. "Shall we go for a ride?"</p>

  <p>"No. I want exercise. I'm afraid of getting fat...But, if you come for a
  walk, you shall have the use of the car tonight, without me. And you can
  choose your chauffeur."</p>

  <p>Ada was impressed by the stranger's hint, but she hid her surprise so
  successfully, that Ignatius glanced at her with new respect.</p>

  <p>"All right, then, it's a snip," she said, steering, from instinct, towards
  the shade of the Quakers' Walk.</p>

  <p>They had not gone far under the chestnuts when she knew that this was not
  going to be the usual walk. Contrary to her experience the gentleman from
  London did not advise her to train for the Pictures. Instead, he talked to
  her of Paris and New York, which she knew more than he did, for she had seen
  them, in the pictorial Press.</p>

  <p>Soon, however, she found that she was back at 'The Spout', although she
  could not remember how the return journey had been accomplished.</p>

  <p>"Does Miss Asprey give you every Sunday afternoon?" asked Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"I take it," replied Ada.</p>

  <p>"Is Miss Mack also free?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"But what work has she to do on a Sunday?"</p>

  <p>"Her usual work. Nothing," replied Ada tartly.</p>

  <p>"Lucky Miss Mack. Don't you envy her?"</p>

  <p>"No, that I don't."</p>

  <p>Ada's voice was so emphatic that Ignatius dared to question her
  further.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Ask her yourself," replied Ada.</p>

  <p>As she was plainly on her guard, Ignatius tried another line of
  attack.</p>

  <p>"Poor Miss Mack," he said. "I thought she looked such a pathetic soul. So
  plain. So hopeless."</p>

  <p>"Don't you pity her," advised Ada. "She made her own bed when she put
  herself up. <i>Now</i>, she's neither flesh, fowl, or good red herring."</p>

  <p>"Oh. So she's been promoted recently?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. She used to do house-work, like us. But she smarmed Miss Asprey, so
  now she's a sekkertary. She sits, all day, with Miss Asprey, and hardly
  speaks to us."</p>

  <p>"And how do you know that she smarmed to get the delightful job of being
  shut up continually with an old woman? Miss Asprey might have advanced her,
  on her merits."</p>

  <p>"I never said I <i>knew</i> that," corrected Ada. "I said she smarms Miss
  Asprey. I've heard her, over food."</p>

  <p>"What food?" asked Ignatius sharply.</p>

  <p>"Things for supper. She wants the same as we get in the kitchen?"</p>

  <p>"And she gets it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, after a bit. Miss Asprey's very kind."</p>

  <p>Ignatius began to walk quicker, unconsciously tapping the trunks of each
  tree, with his stick.</p>

  <p>"Is Miss Mack never free to go out?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"She's too fat and lazy," explained Ada. "She used to have a bit of
  colour, but now she's gone white and waxy. I believe she eats starch."</p>

  <p>"There may be another explanation," said Ignatius. "There seems to be
  rather a gulf between Miss Mack and yourself. Does she try to give you
  orders?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, she tries it on, but we just laugh at her, to her face. You ought to
  hear her. 'I'm mistress here'."</p>

  <p>Ada tossed her head so violently that her light crinoline hat was
  dislodged, so that the breeze blew it to the ground. She did not notice her
  loss, as she went on with her boast.</p>

  <p>"If I was to give notice, Miss Asprey would have to train another
  housemaid. But if Miss Mack was to give notice, there'd be a hundred letters
  begging for her job."</p>

  <p>"You've a retentive memory for what you overhear, Ada," said Ignatius. "Is
  Miss Asprey fond of Miss Mack?"</p>

  <p>"She's a kind mistress, to us all," was the cautious reply.</p>

  <p>"Does she scold?"</p>

  <p>"No. She just says, 'You've had your warning. I shall not speak twice.
  Next time, you'll go'."</p>

  <p>"Has she ever warned you, Ada?"</p>

  <p>"Not she. She knows experienced housemaids are rare."</p>

  <p>"And has she warned Miss Mack?"</p>

  <p>"What would be the use?" Ada laughed. "She'd never get <i>her</i> to go.
  Put her out at the front door, and she'd come in, at the back, like a little
  dog. I heard Miss Asprey tell her to go, with my own ears. But she stayed
  on."</p>

  <p>Ada tossed her bead again, and apparently missed something, for she gave a
  faint scream.</p>

  <p>"I never. I've lost my hat."</p>

  <p>"Here it is," said Ignatius, giving her the crinoline straw shape he was
  hiding behind his back. "You'll be losing your head next."</p>

  <p>"Not me," boasted Ada. "It's screwed on too tight...Well, well, I'm always
  losing little things, but I've never lost my hat before."</p>

  <p>In spite of her hint, Ignatius made another attempt to pump her.</p>

  <p>"Things are very uneven," he said. "It's a shame a pretty girl like you
  has to do the work, while a lump like Miss Mack leads a lady's life. Wouldn't
  you like to change places with her?"</p>

  <p>"Not me, thanks."</p>

  <p>Ignatius had worked back to his original point, but this time Ada was
  forewarned and ready with her answer, before he put his inevitable
  question.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I wouldn't change faces with her," was her official reason.</p>

  <p>Then she looked at her watch and screamed.</p>

  <p>"Time to turn. I've got the tea to get."</p>

  <p>On the way back, Ignatius deserted 'The Spout' and began to talk generally
  about the village. Ada, who was now in her element, did not need prompting,
  as she reeled off spool after spool of local gossip. But, presently, both
  grew silent, as each reviewed the conversation. When they parted at the gate
  of 'The Spout', Ada was quick to notice that Ignatius made no reference to a
  future meeting.</p>

  <p>'Trying to get me to miss-call the mistress, you poor sap,' she thought
  scornfully, as she walked up the drive. 'Well, my lord, you got nothing out
  of me but what I wanted you to know.'</p>

  <p>But Ignatius&mdash;strolling across the green&mdash;also claimed a
  victory, on points.</p>

  <p>'Shot her to bits, like a clay pigeon. Poor Ada...Bit of luck her hat
  blowing off. It gave me a pointer as to which way the wind <i>might</i>
  blow.'</p>

  <p>Ignatius did not attend Evening Service, although he asked tenderly after
  the different members of the congregation, when he met the Rector, at
  supper.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Sheriff felt faint, and left before the sermon," the Rector told
  him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. Squire's wife. Sandy hair. Weighs about seven stone. Probably
  eats too much. This is an example of Pelmanism, Tigger, and not an attempt to
  emulate S.H."</p>

  <p>At that moment, up at the Hall, Mrs. Sheriff was making the most of her
  indisposition, as she lay on a divan, while Vivian anointed her forehead with
  lavender-water.</p>

  <p>"It's that palpitation again," she complained. "I <i>know</i> it's
  heart&mdash;although Dr. Perry <i>will</i> call it stomach."</p>

  <p>No one contradicted her, although it was well-known that she was too
  optimistic over the strength of her digestion to act as a buffer between
  over-eating and pain.</p>

  <p>"He's a terrible man," she said. "But you'd better send for him,
  Vivian."</p>

  <p>"No." The Squire's voice was aggressive. "If you must see a doctor, ring
  up Rawlings."</p>

  <p>"Drag a strange doctor all the way from Cheltenham?" cried his wife.
  "Whatever for?"</p>

  <p>"Because I don't want Perry called in here again."</p>

  <p>Both Mrs. Sheriff and her daughter stared at the Squire. Had Ignatius been
  present, he would have noticed that, while the elder woman was merely
  astonished, Vivian's eyes showed fear.</p>

  <p>She seemed terrified of what her father was about to say; for, directly he
  spoke, her face grew tranquil again.</p>

  <p>"I don't like this legacy business," roared the Squire. "I've no use for a
  man who takes money from a woman. A spinster, too."</p>

  <p>"But, Osbert," argued Mrs. Sheriff, "poor Miss Corner's dead."</p>

  <p>"Makes no difference."</p>

  <p>"But you inherited money from an unmarried woman."</p>

  <p>"She was my god-mother. My old dad chose her, on purpose, because she was
  rich. Don't be a fool. He must have sucked up to her, while she was
  alive."</p>

  <p>Vivian thought it time to intervene.</p>

  <p>"If you sent for him, Dr. Rawlings wouldn't come, Father. Professional
  etiquette. He knows Dr. Perry's our doctor."</p>

  <p>"He's not. I won't have him in the house. Besides, he wouldn't come out on
  a Sunday. He doesn't want the money. The fellow's a rich man now."</p>

  <p>To quote from the B.B.C., 'the debate continued.'</p>

  <p>Whatever the outcome, when darkness had fallen Dr. Perry had received no
  welcome summons to the Hall.</p>

  <p>Lit by the silver lamp of the moon, Ignatius Brown and the Rector strolled
  through the village. The night was warm and still, and the street was
  deserted. The last courting-couple had returned from the gloom of
  honeysuckle-twined lanes. Bats blundered low, and owls hooted from an oak
  mentioned in the Domesday Book. Bowers of jessamine glimmered like small
  white stars, and the air was heavy with their fragrance.</p>

  <p>The wide spread of empty fields blurred to the semblance of a grey
  tideless sea, and, once again&mdash;as the faint lights crept out to
  starboard and port&mdash;the village seemed to ride at anchor, like a
  gracious derelict three-decker, in the forgotten harbour.</p>

  <p>Ignatius fell under its familiar spell.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to call any man a liar, Tigger," he said. "But I must
  confess to being sceptical about any secret evil here."</p>

  <p>"All the same, I hold you to your promise," remarked the Rector.</p>

  <p>Everyone was indoors; behind each lighted blind or curtain they could see
  the concealed glow of lamp-light. Sometimes they heard music, or snatches of
  talk and laughter. For the windows were open, although the tradition of the
  screened interior was unviolated.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the Rector was goaded to betray his sense of blindfold
  impotence.</p>

  <p>"I wish to Heaven," he burst out, "I could draw up every blind, and see
  for myself what's inside."</p>

  <p>As though some night-fairy waited on his wish it was immediately granted.
  Someone crossed to the window, at which they gazed, and drew aside the
  curtain, revealing a charming domestic interior, of chintz wall-paper, old
  china and pink-shaded lamps. By the door, one middle-aged gentlewoman kissed
  a middle-aged brother good night.</p>

  <p>The next minute she put out the light and the house shrank back into the
  prevailing darkness.</p>

  <p>"Apparently," gloated Ignatius, "the village heard you. So it showed you a
  sample room in a model village."</p>

  <p>His words were true. The parlour of Rose Cottage was typical of other
  drawing-rooms in its light, comfort, and peace.</p>

  <p>In one house a woman rose from her chair, where she sat reading. She, too,
  kissed her company, and&mdash;at the door&mdash;looked back into the cheerful
  room, with a smile.</p>

  <p>But once outside, her face was that of a dead woman, as she drew from her
  bag a bit of crumpled paper, covered with printed letters.</p>

  <p>Someone knew. The years of false security and happiness were over. She
  groped her way up the stairs through the dense blackness of fear.</p>

  <p>"I can't face it," she whispered. "Never. <i>Never</i>. I'll die first...
  I'll&mdash;<i>die</i>."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE LOST INITIAL</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Rector returned from matins, the next morning, 'with a
  message from Miss Asprey, for Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"She is full up with engagements, but will see you at three-thirty, today.
  She can spare you about fifteen minutes only, so I would advise you to be
  punctual."</p>

  <p>In his anxiety not to be late, Ignatius ignored the advice; for he rang
  the bell of the Tudor mansion at twenty minutes past three. Rose, the gaunt
  parlour-maid looked rather grave when he mentioned the time of his
  appointment, but showed him into the empty library.</p>

  <p>His lined face lit with enthusiasm at the beauty of the panelling and
  ancient furniture; but, after glancing at the wooden seats, he decided not to
  sit down. It was natural, therefore, as he paced the room, to glance casually
  at the bureau, which held nothing more private than unopened letters and
  circulars.</p>

  <p>He did not pry or do anything which he would not have done in the presence
  of the mistress of the house. When he crossed over to the shelves, he merely
  read the titles of some of the oldest books&mdash;relics of a little
  Victorian girl's school days.</p>

  <p>He opened some of these, at random, and restored them almost directly; but
  his conscience was so clear that he retained the copy of <i>Alice in
  Wonderland</i>, although he heard Miss Asprey's step in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me for looking at the date of your edition," he said, holding up
  the battered volume. "But 'Alice' is our common talisman. I'm horribly
  envious. Your edition is earlier than my own."</p>

  <p>"That is one of the rewards of age," remarked Miss Asprey, with her
  special gracious smile.</p>

  <p>She waved Ignatius to a carved chair, and sat down herself, as a signal
  that the interview had begun.</p>

  <p>"I understand, from our Rector," she said, "that you wished to see me on
  the subject of my anonymous letter. If you will listen to me, I think you are
  making a great mistake."</p>

  <p>"I should be very glad to hear your views," Ignatius assured her. "I know,
  from what I've heard of your former work and experience, that your advice
  will be valuable."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey's austere face softened slightly at the flattery.</p>

  <p>"As you say," she remarked, "I probably know more about the seamy side of
  life than you do. And I know that it is unwise to stir up mud. At the very
  beginning I wished to suppress the miserable letter. It was nothing. It did
  no harm to me, or anyone else...Nothing that has happened since has made me
  change my original view. The letter is still nothing."</p>

  <p>"But there have been other letters," Ignatius reminded her.</p>

  <p>"So I hear. But have they caused any harm?"</p>

  <p>"Not to those who received them. But they've certainly created an
  unpleasant and harmful atmosphere."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey waved her thin white hand.</p>

  <p>"Give it time," she said. "It will all pass."</p>

  <p>In her bleak purity she reminded Ignatius of her own Madonna lilies which
  filled a tall jar on the window-seat. But the saint possessed the business
  virtue of punctuality, for she glanced rather pointedly at the grandfather's
  clock in the corner.</p>

  <p>Taking the hint, Ignatius drew out an envelope from his note-case.</p>

  <p>"I understand your letter was enclosed in this," he said. "Now, are you
  <i>certain</i> you cannot detect the slightest sign of a familiar
  handwriting? So many people use Roman capitals."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey shook her head, after a perfunctory glance. "No," she replied.
  "And, please, burn that envelope. The episode is best forgotten."</p>

  <p>Without undue haste, Ignatius tactfully relieved her of it.</p>

  <p>"You are beginning to convert me to your views," he said. "The letters
  seem harmless, since there is no suggestion of blackmail. But that <i>may</i>
  follow. That is why we want to find out who wrote them."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey opened her lips, as though to speak, and then closed them
  again. She was obviously impatient when Ignatius asked an irrelevant
  question.</p>

  <p>"What pious initials, you have," he remarked. "'D.V.' I know your name is
  Decima' because it is my favourite name. What does 'V.' stand for?"</p>

  <p>"A ridiculous name, which I discarded a long time ago," snapped Miss
  Asprey.</p>

  <p>She rose, to end the interview, and then, after a slight hesitation, spoke
  to Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"As you are a stranger here, you cannot understand the attitude of the
  village. But I assure you that to meddle is no kindness. I think most of us
  would prefer to pay some small sum&mdash;which we could well
  afford&mdash;rather than ventilate our grievance. Privacy means
  <i>everything</i> to us. And everything that's worth having must be paid
  for."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said Ignatius. "You would rather bleed inwardly than
  expose your wound. But doesn't it depend on where you're shot?"</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you."</p>

  <p>"A soldier running from the battle-field might be reluctant to show his
  wound; but he couldn't disguise the fact if he'd been peppered in the
  face."</p>

  <p>"Then you mean to go on until you find someone who is lost to all sense of
  dignity?" asked Miss Asprey coldly.</p>

  <p>"For the sake of the general good, I must find someone who will talk,"
  translated Ignatius. "Good afternoon, and thank you for seeing me."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey stood like a statue as she waited for Rose to answer the bell.
  Her parting bow was stiff as he was shown from her presence.</p>

  <p>It was a relief to exchange the chill of the house for the sunshine of the
  drive, so Ignatius lingered to admire the water-fed garden. Ada&mdash;looking
  her best in her blue sweeping overall&mdash;shook her duster ostentatiously
  from a window overhead, but he did not glance in her direction.</p>

  <p>He did his best to dim the intelligence of his eyes as a little dumpy
  woman pattered out of the house. It was Miss Mack.</p>

  <p>With a memory of Ada's criticism, he studied her keenly, for signs of
  illness or unhappiness. But her face, though pale, was firm and tranquil, her
  smile was serene, and her blue eyes clear as those of a china doll.</p>

  <p>"Lovely day," he observed. "I suppose you're going for a walk?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Miss Mack, "I'm going to weed the garden."</p>

  <p>"And do you prefer that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't mind."</p>

  <p>Ignatius glanced up at the floating fluff from Ada's duster, and then
  lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>"Can we talk somewhere without being overheard."</p>

  <p>Miss Mack's face seemed incapable of showing surprise, but she displayed
  her grip of the situation.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to see our new water-irises?" she asked, leading the way
  across the lawn, to the pool. Her eyes were smiling blue crescents as she
  looked up at him.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to insure?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No, not in your sense," replied Ignatius. "Indeed, it is rather difficult
  to explain my impulse. But I'm an idle chap myself, so I'm rather sorry for
  workers&mdash;or rather, those who cannot choose their work...Will you make
  me a promise?"</p>

  <p>"What kind of promise?" asked Miss Mack.</p>

  <p>"Nothing alarming. But, if you should be in trouble, at any time, will you
  let me know? Here's my card. I may be able to help you."</p>

  <p>Miss Mack did not lose her smile, but she accepted the card.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said. "But if I was in trouble, of course, I should go to
  Miss Asprey for help."</p>

  <p>"That means one of two things," remarked Ignatius. "Either you will
  <i>not</i> be in trouble, or that you are very loyal. Good-bye."</p>

  <p>As he walked down the drive, he had the feeling that Miss Asprey was
  looking at him from the window of the library, and that she had been a
  spectator of the scene.</p>

  <p>'Good work,' he chuckled as he shut the gates.</p>

  <p>During tea, the Rector tried to pump him about his visit to Miss
  Asprey.</p>

  <p>"Did you find out anything new?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect to," replied Ignatius. "I merely called on her, to check
  up on the facts."</p>

  <p>"In that case, I don't know why you bothered her at all. She couldn't tell
  you what she doesn't know herself."</p>

  <p>"No, but she could tell me something she does know. And that's her second
  name."</p>

  <p>"She hasn't one." The Rector spoke with authority. "She has shown me the
  testimonial and presentation plate she received when she gave up her Rescue
  work. I distinctly remember the name in the inscription was 'Decima',
  only."</p>

  <p>"In that case, she has been known by the one initial for at least thirty
  years, and before she came here to live. So no local person could possibly
  have known she possessed a second."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed the Rector.</p>

  <p>He looked rather surprised when Ignatius showed him a creased
  envelope.</p>

  <p>"Where are your eyes, Tigger? Didn't you notice the address on the
  envelope you've been treasuring as a proof?" The Rector shook his head.</p>

  <p>"At the time, I was too staggered to be observant," he explained.
  "Afterwards, I just chucked it inside a drawer and locked it up. But, anyway,
  it's complete vindication of the village. The letters come from Outside."</p>

  <p>Ignatius did not confirm his comforting theory. He rose to his feet and
  threw his cake to Charles.</p>

  <p>"I'm off to see the doctor," he said.</p>

  <p>"These mysterious comings and goings seem hopeful," remarked the Rector.
  "Have you some definite theory?"</p>

  <p>"I have a definite theory and an indefinite one. I prefer the second,
  which suggests a daisy of a problem. This may prove merely a dislocation, or
  it may be a complicated compound fracture. I shall have to follow up the
  commonplace solution, for want of an adequate finger-post...Oh, curse the
  woman."</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"I mean the one person who could clear up a small, but vital point, always
  supposing she told the truth."</p>

  <p>"And won't she speak?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>The Rector was properly shocked at such lack of public spirit.</p>

  <p>"But cannot she be induced to be open?" he asked. "Can't you appeal to her
  sense of fair play?"</p>

  <p>"She hasn't any. That line of talk gets you no further with the dead. My
  missing witness is Julia Corner."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; POSTMAN'S KNOCK</h2>

  <p class="first">THE beautiful old rose brick walls hid all but the roof of
  St. James' House. As Ignatius crossed the lawn, he noticed the plentiful crop
  of daisies, and a large canvas swimming-bath, brimful with water, which was
  warming in the sunshine. At the front door, two white nurses were removing
  two white babies from snowy perambulators.</p>

  <p>Hearing the children's voices, Marianne came rushing out, to smother them
  in maternal passion; but she restrained herself, as she saw Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to see the doctor?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Regretfully, yes," he replied, accepting the invitation of her eyes. "But
  not professionally."</p>

  <p>"Of course not. You're staying at the Rectory. I saw you in church."</p>

  <p>"And I saw <i>you</i>."</p>

  <p>In regarding the baby's mother, Ignatius appeared blind to the fact that a
  baby was waving a hand in languid welcome. In spite of her pose of
  detachment, Marianne had to call his attention to this rare honour.</p>

  <p>"The family has just returned. Isn't it a collection? But I suppose we
  must consider Posterity."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Ignatius formally saluted the baby and then turned his back on it.
  "Nothing annoys me more than to be called on to make sacrifices for a lot of
  unknown people who'll enjoy all those discoveries of the future, which are
  denied to me. I wrote a poem on the subject, for our School Magazine. It
  began, 'Posterity, Posterity, It isn't you&mdash;it isn't me, then why the
  Dickens should we be The victims of Posterity?'"</p>

  <p>His face relaxed at Marianne's tribute of laughter, so that he began to
  overlook her flamingo-red frock and haggard charm. Vivid colour always
  disturbed him, and he classified her among the man-eating species.</p>

  <p>"Could I see the doctor?" he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"I'm terribly sorry." Marianne shook her head with a violent sway of coral
  earrings. "He went up to London by the early train, and won't be back until
  dinnertime."</p>

  <p>"Then, may I call later?"</p>

  <p>"Do." She hesitated and then spoke on impulse. "And, if it's anything to
  do with these blasted letters, good luck to you. They've simply shot the
  village to bits."</p>

  <p>Ignatius&mdash;who felt the pull of her attraction even under his tough
  rind, walked hastily towards the gates. He wanted to be removed from the
  radius of such dangerous magnetism.</p>

  <p>After dinner, when he was about to start on his second visit, he enlisted
  the aid of the Rector.</p>

  <p>"Stroll over with me, Tigger, and keep Mrs. Perry out of the way. It's
  always sound policy to break up the combination of husband and wife. They
  kick each other during Contract Bridge."</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry and his wife were just finishing their coffee when the two men
  were announced. But the Rector proved a spare part, for, apparently, the
  doctor had anticipated the need for privacy. After a few minutes' chat, he
  rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Shall we come to my study?" he asked.</p>

  <p>He gave the impression of an exhausted man, although, according to his
  story, his visit to London had been a pleasure-jaunt.</p>

  <p>The evening was rather gloomy, so a small fire was burning in the grate.
  Ignatius sat looking at the leaping flames as he mentally reviewed his
  impressions. He had noticed that the furniture and decorations of the house
  showed extravagant expenditure, which had not been maintained. Even the sun
  had entered into the conspiracy to impair credit, for the brocade curtains,
  as well as the carpet, were faded and slightly shabby.</p>

  <p>Money was being spent like water, but it was the waste of a leaky tap,
  which did not make the grass grow. Ignatius remembered the absurd ostentation
  of the nursery parade, and he laid the blame on Marianne.</p>

  <p>"That lady's a cash-register, which gives no change. I should say the poor
  devil could do with his legacy."</p>

  <p>As the doctor remained silent, he produced an old copy of the local
  newspaper.</p>

  <p>"I've read the report of the inquest on Miss Corner," he said. "It's very
  long and seems to cover the ground. But can you tell me of any additional
  details which have been left out of this account?"</p>

  <p>The doctor was slow in skimming the newspaper.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, at last, "you have all the facts here."</p>

  <p>"Then I must congratulate all of you on your loyal discretion."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," said the doctor quietly.</p>

  <p>"I think you do," insisted Ignatius. "It is obvious to the meanest
  intelligence that the most significant fact was ignored. The Coroner must
  have noticed it, besides yourself, and, probably, everyone in the Court."</p>

  <p>The doctor smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"You're being rather unusual, Mr. Brown," he said. "Most clever people
  under-rate the intelligence of others. You go to the other extreme. But we
  stagnate here. You must not expect too much from us."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I am sure that your intelligence is acute."</p>

  <p>"In that case, why should I tell you what you profess to know
  already?"</p>

  <p>"Only to save time," replied Ignatius. "I hope you will forgive my
  discourtesy when I say I did not wish your charming wife to be present at
  what I want to be a <i>secret</i> interview."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed the doctor, "Marianne is indiscreet. It is unfortunate that
  she mentioned the anonymous letter to Sergeant James."</p>

  <p>"My point of view exactly. For she established the fact that <i>you</i>
  knew the contents of the letter on the evening it was received."</p>

  <p>"Of course. I mentioned, in my evidence, that she first read the letter,
  and was merely amused by it. So she gave it to me to read."</p>

  <p>"Yet, although every intelligent person in the Court knew that it was
  nearly dark when the last post was delivered, no one expressed surprise that
  the short-sighted Miss Corner should be able to read the letter without her
  glasses, which were previously smashed?"</p>

  <p>The doctor said nothing, so Ignatius continued.</p>

  <p>"Since it was obvious that Miss Corner knew the contents of that letter,
  by heart, it also follows that she wrote that letter to herself."</p>

  <p>"That might be the inference," said the doctor. "After all, there is no
  harm in her wishing to clear herself of a false suspicion. Perhaps her method
  was a bit childish and ingenuous, but she was rather fond of the
  bludgeon."</p>

  <p>Ignatius noticed that the doctor had quite recovered from his attack of
  reticence, and seemed anxious to talk about Miss Corner.</p>

  <p>"She under-rated the local intelligence," he said. "Really, she was an
  extraordinary mixture of simplicity and acuteness. But she had a fund of good
  nature and courage and was the most vital person I knew. I cannot tell you
  how much I miss her."</p>

  <p>The doctor's listless eyelids drooped no longer and his voice was
  animated. Ignatius, who was watching him closely, believed that his regret
  was genuine.</p>

  <p>"People played her too low," continued the doctor, "because she believed
  in her own literary trash. But <i>was</i> her attitude so absurd? She made
  money by her writing, and she always declared that no fiction could be a
  financial success if written with the tongue in the cheek. It seems to me a
  sign of brain-power that she willed herself to believe in her own poor stuff.
  Besides, it gave her pleasure and that, in itself, was a tonic for her."</p>

  <p>Ignatius made an admirable listener, while the doctor continued to talk in
  the same strain, in a post-mortem oration to his friend. But, at its end, he
  harked back to an original remark.</p>

  <p>"You spoke, just now, of a 'false' suspicion. But I possess evidence that
  Miss Corner <i>did</i> write that letter to Miss Asprey."</p>

  <p>"<i>No</i>," declared the doctor. "She was incapable of such poisonous
  spite."</p>

  <p>"We'll soon clear up that point," said Ignatius. "Can you tell me the
  initial of Miss Asprey's second Christian name?"</p>

  <p>"She hasn't a second name," declared the doctor. "On one or two occasions,
  I've required her signature on certificates."</p>

  <p>"Apparently, she hasn't had one for about forty-five years," said
  Ignatius. "Names go through cycles of unpopularity or ridicule, and, as a
  child, she took a violent dislike to her second name. It was 'Victoria'.
  Please keep it a secret, for her sake...But although no one here knows that
  fact, the envelope which contained the anonymous letter was addressed to
  'Miss D. V. Asprey'."</p>

  <p>In the pause which followed, the postman's double-knock shook the hall.
  Then Ignatius became aware, from the fixity of the doctor's expression, and
  the flicker of his eyes behind his glasses, that he was really thinking
  rapidly, while he affected to register shocked surprise.</p>

  <p>Although he disliked to rush a dramatic situation, he hastened to make his
  point.</p>

  <p>"That letter was written by someone who knew Miss Asprey in her youth. She
  and Miss Corner were old school-fellows. Now what is the obvious
  inference?"</p>

  <p>He was too late, for the doctor had reached his mental goal.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he said. "Miss Corner's non-complicity is proved by the fact
  that two other anonymous letters have been received after her death."</p>

  <p>"Exactly." Ignatius made the catch for which he had bowled. "Innocuous
  affairs, to the padre and Blair, both containing a vague childish threat,
  which the writer has never followed up. Don't they rather give the show
  away?"</p>

  <p>"What show?" asked the doctor.</p>

  <p>"That they were written by a loyal friend of Miss Corner's, in order to
  prove her innocent of writing the first letter to Miss Asprey."</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry bit his lip.</p>

  <p>"If you mean that I wrote those letters," he said, "I absolutely deny
  it."</p>

  <p>Ignatius rose.</p>

  <p>"That settles it," he said. "I can only thank you for wasting your time
  over our little problem."</p>

  <p>As, in his turn, the doctor got up, the door of the study was thrown open,
  and Mrs. Perry rushed in, followed by the Rector.</p>

  <p>"Horatio," she cried, "do look at this letter. It's printed. I believe
  it's one of <i>them</i>."</p>

  <p>In tense silence, Dr. Perry tore open the envelope and crossed to the
  window, in order to read what was written on the sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>While he frowned, in hesitation, unable to decide the wiser
  course&mdash;whether to show the letter which vindicated him from Ignatius'
  charge, or to keep its contents a secret&mdash;Marianne, who was looking over
  his shoulder, put an end to his difficulty.</p>

  <p>One bare arm thrown around her husband's neck, she read it aloud, in
  triumphant tones:</p>

  <p>"'Every one in the village knows that you poisoned Miss Corner for her
  money'."</p>

  <p>The words had scarcely left her lips, when she realised her mistake. The
  swirl of her orange gown was like a flame licking the dust, as she spun round
  and held the letter in the fire. Then she caught her husband's arm.</p>

  <p>"Well, darling," she cried, "that lets you out. You were in London, today,
  so you couldn't have written <i>this</i> letter...Oh, don't <i>flutter</i> at
  me. We know, and <i>they</i> know what they've been hinting in the
  village."</p>

  <p>Her voice suddenly shook with fury, as she turned to Ignatius with a
  choked command.</p>

  <p>"Stop suspecting my husband and find out who wrote this cruel, wicked
  lie."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE TRAP</h2>

  <p class="first">"I WAS wrong to distrust a matrimonial alliance," chuckled
  Ignatius, when he and the Rector had returned to the study, where the
  faithful Charles was guarding the biscuits. "Mrs. Perry spilled the beans
  most effectively. I like the doctor. Poor devil, I wonder he has a patient
  left, or a shilling in his pocket."</p>

  <p>"But she's really kind-hearted," said the Rector. "She sits up with the
  doctor's poor patients, and is always first with beef-tea."</p>

  <p>"Made from the best cut," remarked Ignatius acidly. Then he filled his
  glass and held it up. "Here's to our anonymous friend. He's finding his
  range."</p>

  <p>"How? That letter was an infamous lie."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but it was a definite charge, and not a vague warning. What we have
  to do is to try and wander in the labyrinth of a chocked mind. If he aims to
  create an atmosphere of general fear and suspicion, he has spread some useful
  poison this time."</p>

  <p>"'He'?" repeated the Rector. "Then you think it's a man?"</p>

  <p>"I do not. On a numerical basis, the chances are the writer is a woman. I
  use the masculine pronoun solely for convenience...What a confounded nuisance
  that woman is."</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Corner."</p>

  <p>"Remember she's dead, Ignatius."</p>

  <p>"Dead or alive, she's nothing but a name, to me. Hang it, I can't be
  sentimental over your excellent Miss Corner. If she hadn't blundered it, and
  confused the issues, I could have easily solved your little problem."</p>

  <p>It was plain to the Rector that his friend was in excellent spirits; his
  peaked face wore an elfin grin as he waved his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Your mystery," he said, "is a snake, which I'm out to scotch. But the
  miserable Miss Corner has chopped it in two, and the halves go wriggling off
  in opposite directions. I don't know whether to follow the harmless tail, or
  the poisonous head."</p>

  <p>"Then it may be harmless?" asked the Rector eagerly.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, all the facts point to a mere village storm in a teacup.
  Jealousy between two single women. One writes the other a
  spite-letter&mdash;gets suspected&mdash;so writes one to herself. Then, most
  unfortunately dies. So a loyal friend writes two foolish anonymous letters,
  to clear her name."</p>

  <p>"We'll give them their names," said the Rector. "Miss Asprey, Miss Corner
  and the doctor. How have you established your facts?"</p>

  <p>As he listened to Ignatius, he kept rubbing his eyeballs and pulling his
  lids, in the way of a man troubled with nerves.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said. "It seems to be Q.E.D. Only Miss Corner could have known
  Miss Asprey's second name."</p>

  <p>"That is the assumption," agreed Ignatius. "But I <i>must</i> know it for
  a fact. The full name was written in the fly-leaf of all Miss Asprey's old
  books that I had time to examine. I wanted to find out about what period she
  suppressed the second. If she was then in her teens, it is unlikely Miss
  Corner would know it, for Miss Asprey was a senior girl when they first met,
  and she left the school soon afterwards."</p>

  <p>He hit the arm of his chair.</p>

  <p>"Confound the Corner woman. Why did she go and die? If I'd a monkey's paw,
  and could bring her back from the grave, to speak, I wouldn't weaken."</p>

  <p>The Rector could believe the boast as he looked at the little man's grim
  lips.</p>

  <p>"But why is all this so important?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because," declared Ignatius, "everything hinges on the fact as to who
  wrote that first letter."</p>

  <p>He stopped to point to the moths winging around the lamp.</p>

  <p>"I'm like one of them&mdash;attracted by a lurid possibility. Your little
  problem may take the wrong turning, and develop into a sinister plot of a
  malignant personality."</p>

  <p>"And you want it to be the poison-head?"</p>

  <p>"Heaven forbid." Ignatius spoke piously, but insincerely. "But, if it is,
  I should count it rare luck to be on the spot, to help."</p>

  <p>Although he stressed the last word, the Rector appeared lost to a sense of
  gratitude.</p>

  <p>"It seems commonsense to concentrate on the tail-end," he said. "If you're
  right about Miss Corner, I suppose the letters will cease, and the village
  will slowly return to normal."</p>

  <p>Ignatius gave a gleeful chuckle.</p>

  <p>"That was the position, until tonight," he reminded his friend. "But we
  have evidence that the anonymous letter-writer is still active. You see,
  Perry couldn't have written his own letter, because he was in London today.
  And only a lunatic would have entrusted anyone else to post a printed
  envelope."</p>

  <p>"How about his wife?"</p>

  <p>"No, you can leave her out. It was a bad shock to her. Neither of them
  would have brought such a dangerous charge."</p>

  <p>"Then, where, exactly, do we stand now?"</p>

  <p>"In No-man's-land. I propose, for the present, to keep a tab on both ends
  of our snake, and await developments."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"As regards the poison-end, I'm going to instruct a private enquiry agent
  to make a few investigations as to the past history of two selected persons.
  As regards the tail-end&mdash;if the writer is just a harmless
  joker&mdash;I'm going to lay a little trap for him."</p>

  <p>"Trap?"</p>

  <p>At the ominous word, the Rector looked up with a startled expression, as
  though he actually heard the clang of steel jaws.</p>

  <p>"Just a crude sort of booby-trap," explained Ignatius, "I've been often to
  the Post Office and established friendly relations with your post-mistress.
  She strikes me as intelligent and discreet. So, I'm going to enter into
  partnership with her, and get out a new issue of stamps."</p>

  <p>The Rector pulled Charles' silky ears. Presently, he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I don't like it. I'd rather leave things as they are."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Ignatius, "I'll go back to London."</p>

  <p>"No." The Rector spoke to his dog. "We can't let him do that, after
  dragging him down. Can we, Charles?"</p>

  <p>"Don't appeal to Charles," said Ignatius stiffly. "He's a gentleman and
  wouldn't hurt my feelings."</p>

  <p>The gentlemanly Charles instantly gave a most vulgar display of slobber to
  prove that he was friendly to both the opposing parties. Presently Ignatius
  relaxed sufficiently to explain.</p>

  <p>"You see, this trap may not work, or prove too slow in action. But I'd
  like to be on the spot, in case something turned up. So I propose to put up
  at the inn. I'm making too much work for your housekeeper."</p>

  <p>"You old hypocrite, you know Mrs. Wells adores you&mdash;help her
  taste."</p>

  <p>"I only know she looks on me as a slum-product, to be fattened," said
  Ignatius. "What does Charles say?...Thank you, Charles, quite enough. I'll
  stay."</p>

  <p>The next morning, before the Post Office was officially open, Ignatius
  called upon Miss Cassie Reed, the postmistress. She came originally from
  Peckham, and was sharp as a needle. She was further, grey-haired, spectacled,
  fresh-coloured and cropped; and, in her youth it must have been rather
  difficult to distinguish her from a boy.</p>

  <p>Ignatius found her a refreshing change from the Rector, for she grasped
  the salient points of his proposal almost before they were explained, and
  became saturated with the spirit of intrigue.</p>

  <p>"I'll help you gladly," she said. "Anonymous letters are pesty things. It
  won't be difficult, since it's only gentry."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" asked Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"Well, the gentry never buy single stamps, only books, unless it's for
  Charity appeals, when they want whole sheets. Now, suppose I make out a
  secret list of names of those who always buy books, and number them. Like
  this. 'Miss Asprey, 1. Lady d'Arcy, 2.' And so on. And then I'll lightly
  pencil all the books with a corresponding number."</p>

  <p>She proceeded to explain, as though Ignatius were one of the village
  lads.</p>

  <p>"If Miss Asprey comes in to get stamps, I'll sell her No. 1 book."</p>

  <p>"But wouldn't Miss Mack buy Miss Asprey's stamps for her?" asked
  Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"Quite likely. Miss Brook always buys stamps for Lady d'Arcy. But we can't
  help that."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Ignatius. "That's snag number one. The second snag is, we
  don't know whether they'll ask for a two-shilling book, or a
  three-shilling."</p>

  <p>"We'll only number the two-shilling books," decided Miss Reed, "I'll tell
  them we're out of threes."</p>

  <p>"Good," approved Ignatius. "If you'll let me have the books, I'll mark
  them. It'll be a dreary business. Every stamp in each book must be lightly
  pricked in its distinctive position."</p>

  <p>"I'll help you," offered Miss Cassie Reed.</p>

  <p>"No thank you," declined Ignatius. "I must keep the key to them in my own
  head."</p>

  <p>"As you wish."</p>

  <p>It was clear that Miss Reed considered that she was not being trusted, for
  she pencilled the books in silence, which she broke only to introduce the
  subject of finance.</p>

  <p>"If you leave enough money to cover these," she said, in a thorny voice,
  "you will have it back when you return the books to stock, unused. Two pounds
  will do."</p>

  <p>Ignatius took out a ten-pound note.</p>

  <p>"There are certain things which money cannot buy," he told her.
  "Discretion, secrecy, tact, rare intelligence. So you'll understand I'm not
  trying to make a sale, when I say, I hope you won't bother about change."</p>

  <p>Miss Cassie Reed proved his equal in summing up the situation.</p>

  <p>"You're right," she said. "There <i>are</i> things money can't buy, so I
  won't try to buy your own silence. Eight pounds won't go far, if this leaks
  out, and I lose my job. But it will help towards my holiday. It seems to me
  we're in the same boat."</p>

  <p>"Then we must trust each other," said Ignatius.</p>

  <p>They shook hands on their bargain and he left the Post Office with his
  bait.</p>

  <p>As he anticipated, marking all the stamps proved a monotonous occupation,
  but he would entrust it to no one else.</p>

  <p>"A prick ever so lightly out of its correct position might fasten
  suspicion on an innocent person," he said. "But don't look so black, Tigger.
  I doubt if we shall get a single bite."</p>

  <p>"Then why all this fag?" asked the Rector.</p>

  <p>"Because we can neglect nothing. A child may get a bite with his bent pin,
  while the expert angler catches nothing. All the same, this scheme is full of
  holes...Look out, you clown."</p>

  <p>The Rector had dropped a newspaper over the rows of open stamp-books,
  disturbing their correct positions.</p>

  <p>Looking up for some explanation, Ignatius saw Dr. Perry standing at the
  open French window.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE TAIL-END</h2>

  <p class="first">AS the days slipped placidly away, it really seemed as if
  the Rector was justified in his hopes of the innocuous tail. On the surface,
  village life appeared to be normal, and the social tone to be still fragrant
  as lavender. Lilies bloomed in profusion, fruit ripened, and gardens achieved
  new beauty. The weather, too, was perfect, for, while it was fine by day,
  some rain usually fell in the night.</p>

  <p>Now that his subconscious self had ceased to pluck at his
  memory&mdash;jangling the chords to nightmare confusion&mdash;the Rector was
  no longer plagued by his recurrent dream of fighting an unseen enemy. He had
  quite accepted the theory that poor Miss Corner was responsible for the first
  two letters, and that some brainless person had carried on the poor joke.</p>

  <p>"It all fits in with your own reasoning," he told Ignatius. "All these
  letters were mainly harmless, even the last. It is just as absurd to accuse
  Perry of medical mal-practice as it is to accuse Miss Asprey of having a
  past."</p>

  <p>"Murder," corrected Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"Still more absurd...At the time it left a nasty taste, but that was
  because Mrs. Perry threw a scene."</p>

  <p>"Um. Seen Perry lately?"</p>

  <p>"No, he's always busy."</p>

  <p>"Interesting chap. By the way, you seem to have ruled out the possibility
  of there being a poison-head to our snake."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Ignatius looked through the window out at the drowsy golden
  street, steeped in the noon-tide glow. Two local ladies, with shady mushroom
  hats and white sunshades, lined with green, were exchanging garden bulletins
  and recipes for gooseberry-jelly. A sandy kitten in the gutter chased a white
  butterfly.</p>

  <p>"I admit," he said, "that everyone seems very pleasant, and on friendly
  terms with each other. But what's under the surface? People don't mix."</p>

  <p>"You mean, entertain? Give them time," urged the Rector. "With the end of
  the letters, things will slowly return to normal."</p>

  <p>Ignatius smiled impishly and rubbed his hands.</p>

  <p>"But how do you know the letters have stopped?" he asked. "My twig still
  twitches&mdash;and over the most unlikely people. Feebly, I admit. But
  there's <i>something</i> underneath all this."</p>

  <p>He broke off, to stare, as Dr. Perry's Baby Austin, grey with dust, slowly
  plugged up the street.</p>

  <p>The doctor had spent most of the morning motoring over impossible lanes
  and cart-ruts, out to a case in the country. The man was a panel-patient, so
  it was not a profitable morning, although satisfactory from a medical
  standpoint.</p>

  <p>But although Dr. Perry's calls kept him busy, the health of the village
  was unusually good. His wealthy patients suffered chiefly from synthetic
  illness. They knew enough about certain ailments to recognise symptoms, which
  were the prelude to pain or discomfort, when they immediately sent for the
  doctor, who did the rest.</p>

  <p>At present, there was only one authentic case of illness, and that was at
  the Hall. But the seasonal hay fever and rheumatism had sent out their usual
  preliminary notices. Two wealthy maiden-ladies walked in their garden, in the
  cool of evening and admired their flowers.</p>

  <p>As the elder straightened herself from stooping over a bed of pansies, she
  clasped her hands over the small of her back.</p>

  <p>"I felt a slight twinge," she told her sister. "My Enemy is near."</p>

  <p>"Yes," nodded the younger lady. "I sneezed, this morning, passing a field.
  It's time to send for the doctor."</p>

  <p>The elder sister looked thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Sheriff tells me the Squire is delighted with the doctor from
  Cheltenham," she said. "He probably knows the latest theories about
  rheumatism. Dr. Perry never varies his treatment. I think it's enterprising
  to seek fresh advice. Especially when it's recommended."</p>

  <p>The younger sister looked defiant.</p>

  <p>"I shan't see him," she declared. "<i>I</i>'m faithful to my dear Dr.
  Perry."</p>

  <p>As her loyalty took the form of ignoring her hay fever&mdash;which ran its
  usual course&mdash;Dr. Perry did not reap any real benefit.</p>

  <p>Although he professed pleasure at the general good health of the
  community, there were times when he wondered if there were smuts floating in
  the atmosphere which were not washed away by the nightly rains. Both the
  Rector and Ignatius had been present during the reading of the unlucky
  letter, and&mdash;in his opinion&mdash;the Rector was a windbag. But he said
  nothing of his suspicion to his wife, who, with the babies, spent most of her
  time lying in the sun, like lizards.</p>

  <p>Another person who did not revel in the present idyllic conditions was
  Joan Brook. With the sudden jam of social life, she had few opportunities of
  seeing the Rector. Since the country appealed to her more than ever, she
  traced her restlessness back to its right cause.</p>

  <p>She was a resolute girl who did not shirk issues. Because she could not
  meet the Rector at tennis-parties, she set out on a definite
  hunting-campaign.</p>

  <p>'Man-fever,' she told herself defiantly. '<i>I</i> don't care, when it's
  only one. I'm young&mdash;and we like each other. So why not?'</p>

  <p>But the spirit of perversity entered into the game; in the days when she
  was merely interested, their paths were always crossing. But now that she
  cared, the Rector seemed always just round the corner.</p>

  <p>About this time, she began to dread the nights. Her bedroom in the huge
  biscuit-stucco house was small, and faced West, so that it was well-baked in
  the evening, while the trees, which made the park look so cool, blocked any
  current of air.</p>

  <p>Joan always woke up to be haunted by a dread of her future. In those hours
  of thick blackness, she saw herself as a bit of stale, realistic fiction. It
  might have been Miss Corner, turning in her grave, to sum up the familiar
  position.</p>

  <p>'No looks&mdash;no money&mdash;no talent. If I don't marry him, Heaven
  help me'.</p>

  <p>But she always rose with the lark, ready for cereals, as well as fruit,
  with her breakfast, and eager to go on with her campaign.</p>

  <p>Every evening, after dinner, she strolled over the fields, to the village,
  in the hope of a casual encounter. On her way, she crossed the glorified lane
  which led to the Hall&mdash;a long, low building, which had been restored
  after fire, but which possessed one original Tudor wing.</p>

  <p>The drive and formal entrance was reached by the main road; but, on this
  side of the house, part of the grounds stretched down to the hedge. Nearly
  every evening Joan caught a glimpse of Vivian Sheriff and Major Blair,
  playing tennis or strolling in the rose-garden.</p>

  <p>Their friendship was now losing its blurred outlines of casual
  comradeship, and sharpening into a definite affair.</p>

  <p>When Joan watched them, she knew that she was jealous of Vivian's
  security.</p>

  <p>At the worst, she was provided for&mdash;at the best, she would step with
  the triumphant thump of the Wedding March. It was no wonder that her
  smoke-blue eyes held no depth, and there was no undertone beneath her light
  prattle. Vivian was safe.</p>

  <p>The mere fact that a girl, possessed of the gay, reckless spirit of the
  buccaneer, should envy the prospect of being merely settled, proved that Joan
  had a sharp attack of her special man-fever.</p>

  <p>She looked up at the sound of a motor-horn, and saw Ignatius, more
  insignificant than ever, lost in the interior of his impressive car.</p>

  <p>"Like a ride?" he asked. "Wherever you choose."</p>

  <p>"All right. Take me to Babylon, and back again."</p>

  <p>Joan was not often subtle, so she felt rather proud of herself when
  Ignatius caught her mood.</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "Candlelight is too compromising. But I will take you
  around England, and return you here, before it is dark."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, no." Joan shook her head. "Too tame."</p>

  <p>He sighed, as though he, too, at some time, had maddened to the faint,
  far-away drum of the age-old call. Then his voice grew acid.</p>

  <p>"If you come for a ride, at least, you won't be afraid of having to walk
  home. According to a former remark of yours, you can hardly confuse me with a
  cave-man."</p>

  <p>Joan bit her lip.</p>

  <p>"I know I'd rather go for a ride with you than a walk with Miss Asprey,"
  she said quickly.</p>

  <p>Her imprudent speech made Ignatius forget a rankling memory.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>With spirited exaggeration, in which she forgot her antipathy to Ignatius,
  she told him the story of her painful experience.</p>

  <p>"There was I, my dear, blown, panting, winded, dead to the world&mdash;my
  knees giving, my tongue hanging, my back cracking&mdash;while she just
  <i>rolled</i> on, like an oiled devil-on-wheels&mdash;at exactly three miles
  an hour. And all for a wretched twopenny-halfpenny brooch...But she had to
  get even with me for something else."</p>

  <p>"And what was that?" asked Ignatius curiously.</p>

  <p>Conscious that the Major and Vivian had strolled down to the white gate
  which opened out to the lane, Joan confided the story of little Miss Mack's
  disappointment and her promise to Miss Asprey.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't have told that to anyone but you," she said. "Everyone here
  worships her for a saint. But I'm a newcomer, so I see things as they
  are."</p>

  <p>Ignatius looked at her intently.</p>

  <p>"I wish I'd been able to talk to you before," he said. "You interest me
  very much. It's evident that you believe that one's own original
  impression&mdash;however bizarre&mdash;should be accepted before the general
  attitude."</p>

  <p>"I do," said Joan. "I know I'm a horn blunderer. I've dropped more bricks
  than any other girl of my weight in England. But the whole trouble is&mdash;I
  usually hand round the truth."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure of it. You've got breadth between your eyes. I shouldn't think
  you could tell a lie."</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not a liar. I was brought up by a grandmother, who was a queer
  old character, but pretty fine in her way. She had some grim ethics, but they
  seemed to work out all right. She used to say, 'Never tell a lie. Lies are
  miserable, petty things that brand you a coward. <i>But</i>, if you ever have
  to tell one, tell a big lie and <i>stick</i> to it.'"</p>

  <p>"Now I know that, you may have me guessing, one day. But it's fine."</p>

  <p>In spite of his praise, Joan knew that she was sharing his attention with
  the postman, who was trudging through the wild parsley which bordered the
  lane.</p>

  <p>"The last post," said Ignatius. "That postman is the hero of our scenario.
  I wonder what he is bringing Miss Sheriff."</p>

  <p>Vivian&mdash;slim as a crescent moon in her white frock&mdash;slipped out
  of the garden and took a letter from the postman. They heard the glassy
  tinkle of her laugh as she rejoined the Major.</p>

  <p>"He's brought her no thrill, anyway," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"Don't believe it," Ignatius told her. "Like all of us, she has her secret
  life."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Joan thought of her novelist-friend as she stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Odd you should say that," she remarked. "But I have to go. I'm paid for
  my company. Give my love to the little Rector."</p>

  <p>"Little?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I always call people 'little' when I like them."</p>

  <p>Ignatius accepted the oblique compliment, and&mdash;as Joan had
  anticipated&mdash;recalled her to the Rector's memory, by praising her, at
  dinner.</p>

  <p>When the sunset glow was drowning in the violet sea of twilight, they
  strolled over the green. The Rector glanced at the tower of the Clock House,
  and suddenly felt sociable.</p>

  <p>"The Scudamores will be back from their walk. Let's go in. They're so
  normal, they always do me good."</p>

  <p>The lawyer and his wife had proved their moral superiority to the new
  conditions. Although they did not give any formal entertainment, after their
  one experience of refusals, they continued to invite other couples to dine,
  while Mrs. Scudamore rarely drank her afternoon tea without the company of a
  picked acquaintance or friend.</p>

  <p>Directly the two men were inside, they felt the formal atmosphere of the
  house; even the cat dressed for dinner, for his shift-front was immediately
  white against his black coat.</p>

  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Scudamore were in the pleasant drawing-room, drinking
  barley-water, which they invited their guests to drink, on the score of
  health. From health, it was a natural step to illness.</p>

  <p>"Heard how the Squire is today?" asked the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"Is he ill?" asked the Rector. "Perry's never mentioned going to the
  Hall."</p>

  <p>The lawyer and his wife exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>"Probably he was taken ill, when he was in Cheltenham, so saw a local
  doctor," said Mrs. Scudamore. "I know it was sudden."</p>

  <p>"That sounds probable," agreed the Rector, shying from the same unpleasant
  possibility which was troubling the lawyer. "What's the matter with him?"</p>

  <p>"Blood-poisoning. Sharp attack, which might have proved fatal, only it was
  taken in time...No, they wouldn't have had time to wait to get Perry...But
  this is the funny part about it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Scudamore was glad to get away from the doctor, for he stressed his
  account of the illness. Ignatius listened with boredom, which suddenly
  sharpened to attention.</p>

  <p>"He had some fish at a restaurant, in Cheltenham, which was tainted. He
  only swallowed enough to taste it, and then sent it away and ordered
  something else&mdash;cold meat in jelly. And that was where he went wrong.
  The Squire told me that the doctor explained to him, that, as he'd eaten so
  little fish, and was in very good shape, it would have passed harmlessly
  through his system...But he chose a second dish which had jelly; and the
  gelatine proved the right medium to incubate the poison-germs."</p>

  <p>They all agreed it was tough luck. And then Ignatius looked around the
  discreetly tinted room, with its stiff arrangement of good furniture, its
  family treasures and shaded lamps, and deliberately asked an inapposite
  question.</p>

  <p>"Have you received an anonymous letter, Mr. Scudamore?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," replied the lawyer. "In my opinion the whole unsavoury
  nonsense is ended."</p>

  <p>"I agree with my husband," said Mrs. Scudamore.</p>

  <p>"My wife should be in a position to judge," said the lawyer proudly. "She
  probably meets more people socially, than anyone else in the village,
  although she never listens to gossip."</p>

  <p>Ignatius saw that their assurance was, to the Rector, as drink to a
  droughty man. He bowed his head in his old grand manner, like a Roman Emperor
  accepting tribute, as Mrs. Scudamore gazed at him with her large mild
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I think your attitude is the only right one, Rector. We must go on as
  <i>usual</i>, and forget. A sore cannot heal if it is perpetually
  rubbed."</p>

  <p>Ignatius felt that she was trying to say, in a lady-like manner, 'For
  Heaven's sake, padre, get rid of that little brute, who will keep stirring a
  wasp's nest, in the hope of gingering up a last stinger'.</p>

  <p>While they sat and smoked&mdash;with the exception of their
  hostess&mdash;the last post was brought in to Mrs. Scudamore. It was one
  letter in a thick white envelope, with a crest, and the lawyer could not
  resist the temptation of a comment.</p>

  <p>"That looks like Mrs. Bevan's handwriting."</p>

  <p>"Yes," smiled his wife, "that must be the invitation to the wedding." She
  added, in explanation, "The Bishop's eldest daughter is being married next
  month. I promised to be present."</p>

  <p>Ignatius saw the pleasure that the Rector received from this item of
  social intelligence. The mere name of 'Bishop' seemed a spell to exorcise the
  spirit of malicious slander.</p>

  <p>Ignatius was so silent on their homeward walk that the Rector began to
  exult.</p>

  <p>"You're sulking," he declared, "because you don't want to be cheated out
  of your puzzle. But Scudamore is the most level-headed lawyer in the
  district, and he held the same view as myself."</p>

  <p>Ignatius shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking about the Squire's illness," he said. "It gave me a useful
  pointer. Suppose the original poison was present in the village, lying
  dormant, probably harmless, until the chance introduction of the innocent
  gelatine. But what, exactly, <i>is</i> our gelatine? I should know if I could
  make certain who wrote that first letter...And, when I try to solve that
  problem, I find myself blocked by another."</p>

  <p>"And what is that?" asked the Rector indulgently.</p>

  <p>"The problem of a woman," replied Ignatius. "A woman who never
  smiles."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; POSTAL REGULATIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">AS the days merged into each other, without jar or incident,
  even Ignatius seemed to accept his status in the village as a summer guest.
  The Rector was glad of his company, for he was an easy visitor, and his own
  car provided his entertainment. Insignificant as a monkey on a milk-float, he
  steered his glittering monster through the winding lanes, with Charles
  Dickens&mdash;who had acquired a luxury complex&mdash;for passenger.</p>

  <p>He developed one habit, however, which gradually got on the Rector's
  nerves. Every evening, when the first distant knock sounded down the street,
  he used to go to the gate and watch the postman's tubby figure, rolling from
  door to door.</p>

  <p>"<i>What's</i> he bringing?" he used to ask. "Which of them is going to
  get theirs tonight?"</p>

  <p>One morning he announced his intention of paying a visit to the Post
  Office.</p>

  <p>"I must find out if any of our new issue of stamps is in circulation," he
  said.</p>

  <p>The Rector suddenly became preoccupied with his dog. "Charles, you're
  getting fat. Too many rides...I never thought much of that idea of yours, old
  man."</p>

  <p>"Neither did I," agreed Ignatius. "I confess I know nothing about setting
  traps. It is the business of the police. If you had given them the job they
  would know how to tackle it, from A to Z...But you must admit, I am specially
  in the dark, as everyone has thoughtfully destroyed all the evidence. I have
  only one envelope to work on."</p>

  <p>"One for me," said the Rector. "Of course, I tore up mine. It's a natural
  recoil."</p>

  <p>"Never mind. My mind is still working on remote possibilities. For your
  sake, I'm not neglecting sidelines. Miss Reed's trap seemed clumsy and
  creaky, but it may catch something. I'm off to see."</p>

  <p>Ignatius drew on his hat, which shaded his face, so that he looked like a
  slim school-boy, and strolled into the garden. The Rector shouted after him a
  piece of news.</p>

  <p>"I've a visitor coming for lunch. Another parson. One sharp."</p>

  <p>Unaware of future benefits, Ignatius pulled a face at the prospect, while,
  behind his back, the Rector grimaced like a culprit expectant of blame.</p>

  <p>Directly Ignatius entered the Post Office&mdash;a floral bower of white
  Seven Sisters rose-clusters&mdash;he learned the secret of the Rector's
  uneasy conscience. Miss Cassie Reed nodded to him coldly, and held out a
  ten-pound note.</p>

  <p>"I've been expecting you," she said. "Please to take this back. I'm not
  going on with it."</p>

  <p>In spite of his former pose, Ignatius was staggered by the check.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you sold any of the books of stamps?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, one, I'm sorry to say. To Lady d'Arcy."</p>

  <p>Ignatius recalled a vast vague lady to his memory.</p>

  <p>"Why have you changed your mind?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I never liked it, from the first," declared Miss Reed. "But I thought
  that as you were staying with the Rector, <i>he</i> wanted it. I remembered
  his sermons. And I was carried away, to help. I slept on it, but still I
  didn't like it, one little bit. After I sold the first book to Lady d'Arcy I
  felt a traitor to my position of trust."</p>

  <p>"And then, I suppose, you tackled the parson?" asked Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I spoke to the Rector, and told him that it was a sacrifice of all
  my principles. And when he said that he had nothing to do with it, himself, I
  destroyed the list of names and took all the marked books of stamps out of
  the drawer."</p>

  <p>"But you mustn't be put to any loss," declared Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"That's all right. The stamps have their face-value. I can dispose of them
  to friends in London, and elsewhere...But not <i>one</i> shall be sold in
  this district, where they might do harm."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad of that," said Ignatius. "But I'm exceedingly sorry to have
  given any pain to a lady of your high principle."</p>

  <p>Miss Reed made her swift mental comment. 'Soft soap. He wants something
  else.'</p>

  <p>But although Ignatius made his request, he had no real hope.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's no good asking you if any more printed envelopes have been
  delivered in this village?"</p>

  <p>"That's right," agreed Miss Reed. "It isn't. And it's no use trying to
  bribe the postman. I knew we're supposed to read all the postcards, in the
  country, but that's only comic-paper stuff. You'll get nothing out of
  Tomlinson, but what he wants you to know&mdash;and that's not enough to
  spread on the head of a pin."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wouldn't dream of bribing a Post Office official," protested
  Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"And why not indeed? You tried to bribe <i>me</i>."</p>

  <p>Ignatius looked at her, marking her neat grey crop, her tight, shrimp-pink
  face, her spikey blue eyes. At that moment he knew why crimes were committed.
  This hostile little woman could tell him what&mdash;at that stage, he wanted
  to know most.</p>

  <p>He had that object only in view when he proposed the stupid issue of
  marked stamps. It was merely a Knight's move&mdash;an oblique approach to his
  objective. He had hoped to establish a partnership between them, in order to
  gain her confidence, and, gradually, to pave the way to a betrayal of
  official confidence.</p>

  <p>He looked so small and dejected, as he turned to go, that Miss Reed, who
  was, herself, as light as a sparrow, felt sorry for him.</p>

  <p>"I can never forgive myself," he told her. "I hope you will bear me no
  ill-will."</p>

  <p>"Now that I'm straight with myself, I've nothing against you," she said.
  "But I stand for the Government of England."</p>

  <p>When Ignatius walked out of the Post Office he almost expected to see the
  Union Jack floating from the small building, and to hear the strains of the
  National Anthem.</p>

  <p>It was not until his stratagem had failed that he knew how much he had
  counted on it. He strolled through the village, glancing at the passers-by,
  with baffled curiosity. They all wore their masks&mdash;or were they their
  usual morning faces? Not a single person looked short of a night's rest,
  except the Rector.</p>

  <p>'Of course,' he argued, 'an anonymous letter would be merely an annoyance,
  until it went near the bone. No one here may have walked in the mud, or been
  out in the rain.'</p>

  <p>On the green, he was accosted by Marianne Perry, rather to his annoyance.
  She looked a beautiful wanton, in a transparent frock, although its
  colour&mdash;a deep coffee cream&mdash;could not irritate his fastidious
  taste.</p>

  <p>"Will you have lunch with a murderer's wife?" she asked lightly.</p>

  <p>He did not smile as he answered her in his most formal manner.</p>

  <p>"I should be delighted. Only I have to return to a clerical
  lunch-party."</p>

  <p>"I know," she nodded. "Roast saddle of mutton and onion-sauce. I make you
  a better offer. Come in, and have one on the house. No? What can I do for
  you? You look lost. Shall I tell you the way to the Rectory?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks, no. I have no wish to be led up the garden."</p>

  <p>Marianne nodded and left him. A laughing lady, of fluid lines and fleet
  feet, she skimmed over the Green, and ran into her garden.</p>

  <p>There was the usual nursery festival on the lawn, where the babies, with a
  nurse and nursemaid in attendance, were splashing about in the canvas
  swimming-bath.</p>

  <p>As Marianne lingered to admire Mickey, who was 'almost' swimming, her
  smile faded, and a horseshoe of worry appeared between her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Isn't he rather pale, Nurse?" she asked. "You don't think he's
  anaemic?"</p>

  <p>The nurse pursed up her lips. Marianne paid her the high salary she had
  demanded on the strength of her short engagement by a titled lady; but the
  woman was a born bluffer, and chiefly justified her wages by her extravagant
  suggestions.</p>

  <p>As Marianne possessed the mentality which despised Jordan, her confidence
  in her expensive nurse was absolute. She waited anxiously while the woman
  thought of a new way to waste the doctor's money.</p>

  <p>"The children ought to go to the sea," she declared. "It is too relaxing
  here. They want salt water to strengthen their bones."</p>

  <p>"Then they must go," declared Marianne.</p>

  <p>Whistling like a blackbird, she ran into the study, where the doctor, in a
  shabby alpaca coat, was raking through the pigeon-holes of his desk to find a
  formula.</p>

  <p>"Horatio," she chanted, "you've got to send the family to the sea."</p>

  <p>"No," said the doctor. "The change of food and habits will do more harm
  than good. Babies are best in the country."</p>

  <p>"But Nurse says they must go."</p>

  <p>"Then that settles it. I suppose Nurse will pay?"</p>

  <p>"Aha, I'm glad you mentioned payment. Her wages are due tomorrow. Write me
  out a nice big cheque, darling."</p>

  <p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Waste of time," he drawled. "It wouldn't be met."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"For the usual reason. No money in the bank."</p>

  <p>His wife stared at him with startled eyes.</p>

  <p>"But what am I to do about Nurse?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Fire her, and look after the babes yourself."</p>

  <p>Instantly Marianne's overstrung temperament galloped away with her.</p>

  <p>"I <i>couldn't</i>," she stormed. "I'd be lost without her. What would my
  babies do?"</p>

  <p>"They will do very well if you will follow my instructions."</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i>. You're only a doctor. What do you know about children? It
  needs a woman to understand them. Nurse can't go."</p>

  <p>In order to soothe her, the doctor desperately suggested her favourite
  occupation.</p>

  <p>"Instead of working yourself up over nothing, suppose you rake in a little
  money? Send out your bills."</p>

  <p>Marianne's face smoothed at the idea.</p>

  <p>"It's a bit early," she said, "but I'm on to it. Your bookkeeper will now
  carry on."</p>

  <p>The doctor returned to his search. After about fifteen minutes he found
  the missing paper, and went into the dispensary, to find his wife standing at
  the window. She was watching the children on the lawn, and there was
  something so rigid about her pose that his attention was attracted.</p>

  <p>"When are you going to begin your bills?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I've finished them," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Already?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. There wasn't much."</p>

  <p>As they stared at each other, she tried to smile stiffly. Her husband saw
  that she was now completely steadied by the severity of the shock. It was
  also a bad blow to him, for he had been in constant demand, owing to a slight
  epidemic of measles. Always a dreamer, he had not realised the non-profitable
  nature of his work.</p>

  <p>"It's the slack season," said Marianne. "You'll have to sack your
  book-keeper."</p>

  <p>Even as she made her poor joke, her face suddenly contorted, and she ran
  out of the room.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, unconscious of any local thunder, in the midst of prevailing
  fine weather, Ignatius had returned&mdash;against the collar&mdash;to the
  Rectory. When he was introduced to the guest, things appeared to be even
  worse than he had feared. The clergyman was not their contemporary, but the
  father of one of the Rector's college friends, and was well over seventy.</p>

  <p>He was a stout little man, silver-haired and florid, and with a great
  store of enthusiasm. In fact, he used so many adjectives to describe the
  charm of the village that the Rector, touched on his vulnerable spot,
  impulsively invited him to stay to tea.</p>

  <p>"I shall be only too charmed," said Mr. Jenkins. "My inspection was too
  hurried to do the church real justice."</p>

  <p>Ignatius grew still more bored, as lunch dragged on, and the Reverend
  Jenkins wandered in the mist of the past. The old man's voice droned on
  incessantly, as he revived ancient recollections and memories, and told
  stories about dead men and demolished buildings. But presently, at the
  mention of a chance date, Ignatius sat up, alert and bristling with
  interest.</p>

  <p>"You had the living of St. Giles forty years ago?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, thirty-five. I was there for six years."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you came across a Miss Asprey, who was Lady Superintendent of
  a Rescue Home in your Parish?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Asprey?" repeated Mr. Jenkins. "Yes. Yes, indeed. I knew her
  well."</p>

  <p>"What was she like?"</p>

  <p>"A beautiful woman."</p>

  <p>"I mean&mdash;in character?"</p>

  <p>As the old clergyman paused before answering him, Ignatius glanced at the
  Rector, and saw that his expression was slightly resentful, as well as
  anxious. Then the reply came.</p>

  <p>"She was one of the best women I've been privileged to meet. In fact, she
  was almost a saint. She seemed to have no faults. She did noble,
  self-sacrificing work, which sometimes puzzled her, by its seeming futility.
  But, as she was frail, she is, probably, now in Heaven, and understands all
  that was obscure."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, she's not in Heaven," chipped in Ignatius. "She lives here, in a
  fine old Elizabethan house, and does herself well."</p>

  <p>"In-deed?" Mr. Jenkins looked taken aback. "You don't say so? Well, well.
  How time flies."</p>

  <p>But the Rector, who rather regretted his afternoon of boredom, suddenly
  saw a way out.</p>

  <p>"When we've finished doing the church," he said, "we'll go and call on
  Miss Asprey. You'll both enjoy talking over old days."</p>

  <p>"Charmed," his guest assured him. "It will be most delightful, I am sure.
  It is thoughtful of you to suggest such a pleasure."</p>

  <p>But he looked so reflective that Ignatius guessed the origin of his
  eclipse. With his habitual malice, he could tell exactly when the excuse put
  in its opportune appearance, for the old clergyman suddenly became his old
  bright and voluble self.</p>

  <p>He praised the village even more than before, and waited until coffee
  before he glanced at his watch, and groaned.</p>

  <p>"I'm so truly grieved, but I shall not be able to accept your kind
  invitation to stay, after all. I have an engagement which I cannot break.
  What time does the next bus start?"</p>

  <p>"I'll drive you back, if you like," suggested Ignatius spitefully.</p>

  <p>"Not for worlds," protested the old clergyman, hurriedly putting on his
  soft hat, and toddling to the door. As he said 'Good-bye' he renewed his
  thanks, and also added a message for Miss Asprey.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell her how sorry I was not to have the opportunity of renewing
  our old friendship? Please remember me to her, and say how glad I am that
  she's been spared to continue her useful, happy life?"</p>

  <p>When their guest had gone, the Rector was triumphant.</p>

  <p>"I hope you are satisfied now," he said. "You have a genuine testimonial
  of Miss Asprey's character from one who knew her in her work, which is a
  different thing from knowing her socially, as we do. The truth about people
  comes bursting out, when you're both in daily contact, on the same job."</p>

  <p>"Yes," admitted Ignatius, "I am sure that old apple-woman told the truth.
  A bit too much of it, in fact."</p>

  <p>"Then I hope you'll no longer see anything grim in the situation, when two
  women live together, on unequal terms?"</p>

  <p>An elfin grin flickered over Ignatius' face.</p>

  <p>"Your old friend." he remarked, "praised Miss Asprey to the skies, so long
  as he thought she was a bit of still-life. But he was definitely anxious to
  avoid meeting her in the flesh. That is why I regard the situation as even
  grimmer than before."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; HAPPY DAYS</h2>

  <p class="first">A WEEK later, Ignatius decided to go back to London.</p>

  <p>"It seems futile to stay here, waiting for nothing to happen," he told the
  Rector. "All I've learned, from recent observation, is that Vivian Sheriff
  and Joan Brook don't like each other, and that the doctor is not in love with
  his wife. Sorry not to have been more helpful."</p>

  <p>"But you've been of enormous use," declared the Rector, who hailed his
  friend's departure as an omen of peace. "It was you who pointed out that Miss
  Corner wrote the first two letters, and that those written after her death,
  were just practical jokes."</p>

  <p>"No. I pointed out that Miss Corner certainly wrote her own letter, and
  <i>might</i> have written the first, to Miss Asprey. If she didn't, then
  you're only beginning your troubles."</p>

  <p>The Rector changed the subject.</p>

  <p>"I shall miss you," he said, "and Charles will miss the car. I'm afraid
  his pride will have a nasty knock when it goes. He thinks I've bought it for
  his special use."</p>

  <p>He was now drifting on with the imperceptible flow of village life, where
  the salient incidents were sunrise and sunset, and the rest, only the hours
  between. All in his circle seemed to have forgotten the unpleasant episode of
  Miss Corner's death, and their subsequent scare. It was as though they knew
  subconsciously that so long as they did not gather together in numbers they
  were safe from the herd-instinct to panic at a chance shot.</p>

  <p>But, though Fear was no longer apparent, as a black shapeless terror,
  hiding in the shadows, the Rector sometimes wondered if he had really gone. A
  nasty little doubt persisted that, perhaps, the grim visitor was invisible to
  him, because he stalked boldly in the daylight.</p>

  <p>It might even be that the local ladies and gentlemen had grown so
  accustomed to him that they found a strange and perverse pleasure in his
  company, and enjoyed furtive talks with him, in secret holes and corners,
  when no one was near to see.</p>

  <p>Then he remembered the doctor's Arab proverb, 'It is but for a night, oh
  Muleteer', and he told himself that he must be patient and wait. The trouble
  would pass.</p>

  <p>Two nights before Ignatius was due to return, he and the Rector went to
  the Clock House for dinner. It was the Scudamores' usual formal meal, with
  iced drinks and conventional talk, which acted as a sedative on the Rector's
  twitching mind. Presently Mr. Scudamore mentioned a hopeful piece of local
  news which seemed to hint at a social revival.</p>

  <p>"I hear the Towers is to be opened again."</p>

  <p>Ignatius looked up from his asparagus.</p>

  <p>"Is that the big nightmare of pepper-pot turrets, on the London road?" he
  asked. "Who lives there?"</p>

  <p>"The Martins. A very wealthy family. They have been abroad, travelling,
  for two years."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore&mdash;a real helpmate&mdash;supplemented her husband's
  information.</p>

  <p>"They have four unmarried daughters&mdash;charming, unaffected
  girls&mdash;but one has recently become engaged to an Italian count. The two
  eldest girls&mdash;Miss Martin and Constance&mdash;are coming first, and the
  others will follow."</p>

  <p>"I think I've heard about them," remarked Ignatius drily. "Aren't they the
  people, who remember nothing of the places they've visited, except the
  shops?"</p>

  <p>But the lawyer and his wife strangled this sort of conversation at its
  birth.</p>

  <p>"I don't think that is correct," said Mr. Scudamore. "The Martins are so
  accustomed to travel that they probably accept their own experiences as
  common knowledge."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure that is so," agreed Mrs. Scudamore. "I always think it is rather
  sweet the way they try to find topics of everyday interest when they meet
  their stay-at-home friends."</p>

  <p>Ignatius thought wistfully of a certain gossip at his Club&mdash;a man
  notorious for his barbed tongue&mdash;and he longed for his bitterness, as an
  antidote to the Scudamores' syrup.</p>

  <p>As he looked around the discreetly-lit table, with the symmetrical lace
  mats on the polished mahogany, and the light arrangement of Iceland poppies,
  to tone with the amber shades of the candles, he had no premonition how
  fantastic this memory would appear in the light of a certain unborn
  event.</p>

  <p>The evening was hot, so their coffee was served on the verandah. They were
  drinking it&mdash;still on their best behaviour&mdash;when the garden gate
  was burst open and a girl swung through. It was Joan Brook&mdash;flushed with
  exercise, bare-headed, and wearing a short cape of its own material over her
  white dinner-frock.</p>

  <p>Her eyes sparkled at the sight of the Rector, and his own heavy face lit
  up in response.</p>

  <p>Joan explained to Mrs. Scudamore that she had brought her an invitation to
  have tea with Lady d'Arcy, the following afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Of course, it was my job to write you a note," she laughed. "But I'm
  often restless in the evening, so I made it an excuse for a walk."</p>

  <p>"My wife couldn't wish for a more attractive letter," the lawyer assured
  her, while his wife made a mild attempt at a joke.</p>

  <p>"I shall ask Lady d'Arcy for my stamp...Won't you have some coffee, Miss
  Brook? Will you sit here?"</p>

  <p>She led Joan to a chair, at the extreme end of the line, where she was
  separated from the Rector by two places. But the girl, with customary
  directness of purpose, talked to him, across Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen you for ages."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed the Rector. "I don't know how it is. We always seem to miss
  each other, these days."</p>

  <p>"No parties," exclaimed Joan. "I don't know what's come to the village. It
  doesn't seem the same place."</p>

  <p>Ignatius was amused to notice how quickly Mrs. Scudamore changed the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"Is Vivian Sheriff's engagement announced yet?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Is she engaged?" asked Joan rather sharply.</p>

  <p>"That is what I wish to know. Of course, there will be an engagement.
  Major Blair goes to the Hall, every day: and Vivian is not the girl to make
  herself cheap with a man whose intentions are not serious."</p>

  <p>"But what about his?" asked Joan.</p>

  <p>She was so accustomed to modern casual intercourse that she could not
  understand that she had dropped her usual brick.</p>

  <p>"Nice chap, Blair," said the Rector hastily. "I like him, because he's the
  only player on the links I can lick."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed the lawyer, "Blair's a man."</p>

  <p>As he made the inevitable classification, Ignatius caught Joan's eye, and
  a smile flickered between them. He lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>"I wonder why women never marry the men who understand them."</p>

  <p>"I wonder too," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"We're a case in point," continued Ignatius. "Our minds march, or, rather,
  limp together. Yet you wouldn't marry me if I was the last man alive; and I'm
  a born celibate."</p>

  <p>"You were born one," said Joan flippantly, "but you may die double."</p>

  <p>Ignatius stuck to his point.</p>

  <p>"I do understand you. I saw that you were annoyed to hear of Vivian
  Sheriff's engagement."</p>

  <p>Joan glared at him, and then relaxed to confidence.</p>

  <p>"It seemed rather unfair," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"Because she has what you want most. Security."</p>

  <p>"How did you know that?... But my mother has only got my father's pension,
  so we have to help. And both my brothers are out of jobs."</p>

  <p>She bit her lip and broke off.</p>

  <p>"What made me tell you that? I must be mad. I never talk of my family to
  anyone."</p>

  <p>"But I understand you. And that is more than our friend, the padre, ever
  will."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore&mdash;a gracious hostess in her second-best dinner
  gown&mdash;silver-grey brocade&mdash;came forward.</p>

  <p>"We would like to keep you, Miss Brook," she said sweetly, "but you must
  get back to the Hall, before it is dark."</p>

  <p>Against her will, Joan glanced at Ignatius and caught his responsive grin.
  Although she was completely fearless, she knew that it was useless to
  protest.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I may send a verbal reply to a verbal invitation," went on Mrs.
  Scudamore. "Will you tell Lady d'Arcy that I am sorry, but I have a previous
  engagement."</p>

  <p>Formal words&mdash;which Joan was to remember later.</p>

  <p>She walked back to the Court, feeling disappointed and resentful. She had
  scarcely exchanged a dozen words with the Rector, and Vivian Sheriff was
  nearly engaged. Because she was unhappy, she increased her own misery by
  jealous comparison and an orgy of self-pity.</p>

  <p>'She's got everything. He's with her now, and, perhaps, they're
  kissing...And I'm alone. It's a waste of life. I'm missing everything, buried
  here in the country. Yet I must stay, because of the salary. I'm sacrificed
  to my family.'</p>

  <p>Her guess about the lovers was fairly near the mark. As she lingered near
  the white gate of the Hall, on the other side of the fence, Major Blair was
  holding Vivian in his arms. But, when he tried to kiss her, she pushed him
  away.</p>

  <p>"I'm not that sort of girl," she said.</p>

  <p>As a matter-of-fact, although Vivian had accepted casual kisses as
  incidental to flirtations, she was timid and conventional by nature. Women
  have always been the same throughout the Ages, when every girl becomes, in
  her turn, the modern girl. Her conduct is not dependent on any period, but on
  her disposition. It is only the popular definition of morality, and the
  general acceptance or rejection of any breach, which is topical.</p>

  <p>At present Vivian was on her guard against any familiarity. She meant to
  marry Major Blair, and she knew that he was staggering on the brink of a
  proposal. But until the announcement was sent to the <i>Times</i> and
  <i>Morning Post</i>, she could not feel sure of her man.</p>

  <p>Her tactics met with success, for the Major looked at her with admiration,
  as she smoothed her fair sleek hair back into its line.</p>

  <p>"I know you've not that sort of girl," he said.</p>

  <p>"Not very modern, I'm afraid," shrugged Vivian. "It's living in the
  country, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you're not that sort of girl," went on the Major, stressing the
  point. "I've no use for equal standards of morality or mucking about with
  experimental marriage. A man will always be a man, but a woman will find that
  falling off the bus doesn't pay."</p>

  <p>Vivian knew of girls who extracted every advantage by sitting on both
  sides of the fence, but she remained discreetly silent.</p>

  <p>"I'd never marry any woman with a past," declared the Major. "Marriage is
  too big a risk, unless you know all about the girl&mdash;who her people
  are&mdash;and all that."</p>

  <p>Vivian turned her face away and looked reflectively down the vista of a
  sweet-briar pergola, grey-green in the twilight. A rabbit ran across the
  distant tennis court, showing its white scut. The harsh note of the corncrake
  sounded from the hedge and the scent of honeysuckle hung over all.</p>

  <p>It was an ideal pastoral setting for a proposal, and she waited, in happy
  expectation. She could tell, by his heavy silence, that the Major was
  thinking of her.</p>

  <p>But while he was making up his mind to take the plunge, Joan Brook called
  to Vivian, from the gate.</p>

  <p>"What luck finding you here. It'll save a walk up to the Hall. I've a
  message from Lady d'Arcy. Can Mrs. Sheriff come to tea to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied Vivian astringently. "<i>I</i>'m not her
  secretary, and I don't keep a tab on her engagements."</p>

  <p>She regretted her lapse immediately, and summoned up her usual
  sweetness.</p>

  <p>"Shall I run up to the house and find out if she is free for tomorrow?
  Thanks so much for coming."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she gently disconnected the Major, whose arm was still in
  hers.</p>

  <p>Joan looked from her slim white figure to the Major, who towered above
  her. His face&mdash;burned to the hue of port wine&mdash;was a blotch in the
  dusk, and his teeth were a flash of white over shadow, as he smiled at
  Vivian. In her present mood of discontent, born of frustrate destiny, she
  resented the couple.</p>

  <p>They were so patently County people, who understood each other. Secure
  people, with plenty of War Loan, reared in the same traditions, and adherents
  to the same social code. She felt the gulf between herself and them, and was
  urged, by savage irony, to speak to them in their language.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if your mother would ring up Lady d'Arcy? If I wait for an
  answer it will be dark before I get back to the Court."</p>

  <p>The Major understood this kind of speech, for he opened the gate.</p>

  <p>"I'm just pushing off," he said, "so I'll walk back with you. You mustn't
  go up that drive alone...See you tomorrow, Vivian."</p>

  <p>His voice was casual, but his smile conveyed meaning. Then he set off
  briskly, as if, in his opinion, Lady d'Arcy's companion was a fine girl, and
  could last the pace.</p>

  <p>Unconscious that she had dropped her most devastating brick, and wrecked a
  proposal, Joan nodded back to Vivian, and increased the pace to five miles an
  hour, certain that, whenever she stopped, the Major would not walk on
  alone.</p>

  <p>Vivian sauntered back slowly through the rose-garden, past the tennis
  court and the fish-pond, and up the triple terraces, to the house. Her
  thoughts were tinged with triumph, for she was positive that the Major was
  going to propose, although she also knew that it would take very little to
  put him off.</p>

  <p>But for the War, she would probably have been a matron of many years'
  standing. The Squire and his wife believed in early marriage and had paired
  off the rest of the clutch. Each girl got engaged automatically during her
  first Season and each boy had his own home, while still in the twenties.</p>

  <p>Vivian, the youngest, was almost engaged to Dr. Perry, in the summer of
  1914. But while she was a V.A.D. in the local hospital she fell in love with
  a Second Lieutenant. It was the most hopeless, inarticulate affair, for, in
  spite of the crash of social barriers, young Belson was too shy and dazed by
  Vivian, to do more than worship her, as a miner might stare up his shaft at
  the evening star.</p>

  <p>When the War was over, one flaming memory was left to Vivian, when she and
  Belson, chaperoned by an officer and his wife, had spent a week-end at a
  bungalow in the country.</p>

  <p>After a blissful interlude of peace and perfect companionship the senior
  officer was recalled from leave by a telegram. He and his wife rushed off
  immediately, leaving the others to catch a later train.</p>

  <p>They lost it instead. Yielding to the temptation, they called it Fate, and
  spent their precious respite in the bungalow. Time was so short for lovers,
  and each knew that their parting was near. It was a completely proper
  episode, for, in the absence of any chaperonage, they were on their best
  behaviour.</p>

  <p>It was enough for them to feel that they slept under the same roof, and
  met at breakfast, as though they were actually married.</p>

  <p>Only one unlucky incident blotted a perfect holiday. Near midnight, as
  they sat together in the lounge, someone knocked at the front door. Yielding
  to panic, they turned out the light, and waited in the dark. But, instead of
  going away, the intruder hung about the garden. When young Belson thought it
  was safe to light the lamp again, they had a snapshot glimpse of a face
  looking at them, through the window.</p>

  <p>The man instantly grasped the delicacy of the situation, for he melted
  discreetly into the night.</p>

  <p>That was a long time ago. Young Belson was shot in Flanders and was duly
  forgotten. Mrs. Sheriff's two young boys were killed at Jutland, and she
  became a semi-invalid for years. Dr. Perry did not propose, so Vivian became
  her mother's companion, which justified her spinster status.</p>

  <p>But she was tired of being at home and wanted to be her own mistress.
  Besides, she was really fond of Major Blair. As she undressed in her bedroom,
  that night, she examined her small flower face closely in the glass. It had
  fewer lines than Joan's, yet the fact remained that she was in the thirties,
  and beginning to sag. It was high time she was married.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a dark shadow shook through the cheerful little room, and Fear
  tapped her on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"The Major is yours," it whispered, "if nothing puts him off. Suppose he
  knows that you spent a night alone with a man. What would he think of you
  then? Remember, <i>somebody knows</i>."</p>

  <p>Although it was a hot summer night, Vivian felt herself grow cold. In the
  same period which had succeeded War-madness, she never thought of her
  indiscretion without a shudder. But she knew that, even though she was merely
  thoughtless, appearances were against her.</p>

  <p>"What would my people say, if they knew?" she asked herself. "Or Mrs.
  Scudamore?"</p>

  <p>It was the thought of Mrs. Scudamore which really made her sweat. She
  could imagine how those large, mild eyes would film with the frost of
  incredulous horror if ever she heard the story. For no one who knew the
  circumstances could believe in her innocence.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Mrs. Scudamore's self-control was being severely tested in
  her own drawing-room, where she partnered Ignatius in a game of Contract
  Bridge. Although Ignatius was a brilliant player, his thoughts had strayed so
  completely that he had forgotten what was trumps&mdash;an incident which lost
  them the rubber.</p>

  <p>Even he had to admire the lady's assumed unconsciousness of his mistake,
  and the gracious smile with which she paid her score. But when the Rector
  took him to task for his play, on their homeward walk, he only laughed
  heartlessly.</p>

  <p>"I've given her something to remember me by. What does it matter? They'll
  square up together, after we're gone. Their sort always does."</p>

  <p>"Their marriage is certainly a splendid partnership," said the Rector
  stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Is it? I don't like them. They're self-righteous humbugs."</p>

  <p>The Rector was horrified.</p>

  <p>"You can't get away with that," he declared. "They're pleasant, well-bred
  people, and the soul of hospitality."</p>

  <p>"You mean, they invite you to the Clock House. But they don't make you
  feel at home."</p>

  <p>"They always make me feel at home," said the Rector. "And I specially
  liked Mrs. Scudamore's manner to Joan Brook tonight. She was as considerate
  as if she was her own daughter."</p>

  <p>"That's because Miss Brook is a nice girl. But if she came to the Clock
  House, one snowy night, with a baby in her arms, and asked for a night's
  lodging, it would be a different affair."</p>

  <p>Ignatius broke off to chuckle.</p>

  <p>"I can see old Scudamore," he continued, "in correct dinner kit,
  explaining that he could not admit her, because of consideration and respect
  for his wife. And Mrs. Scudamore would agree, by dignified nods, while she
  shut the door, so that the servants should not hear. Afterwards they would go
  back to their Patience."</p>

  <p>"You fatuous idiot," said the Rector patiently. "I suppose you can't help
  it."</p>

  <p>"That's right. Put up with me, as I'll soon be gone. Only Charles will
  regret me and my car. But, remember this...Mrs. Scudamore may go to church,
  but she does not worship God. She worships only the opinion of the
  neighbours. You'll find her out, one day."</p>

  <p>The Rector laughed as he opened the Rectory gate. On the other side of the
  green, the Clock House still glowed with hospitable light. Behind those drawn
  blinds a charming domestic episode was taking place, as the lawyer divided
  his winnings with his wife.</p>

  <p>"I could hardly keep silent," he declared. "That miserable little man
  would be rightly punished if everyone refused to play Bridge with him. It was
  most ungentlemanly to penalise a lady in such a disgraceful manner."</p>

  <p>"I could hardly believe my eyes, when he led that club," said Mrs.
  Scudamore, gathering up her share. "Thank you, love. By the way, I hope I did
  not show my annoyance."</p>

  <p>"No, my dear one, you were wonderful. I noticed that the padre was
  impressed. Past midnight, my dear. Time for bed."</p>

  <p>The servants had gone upstairs long before, and the Scudamores never left
  a room in disorder. They emptied ash-trays, put away the cards, plumped up
  the cushions. Then, together, they went the round of the ground-floor,
  shutting windows and extinguishing the lights.</p>

  <p>Jeremy, the cat, was visited, to see that he occupied his basket, and was
  not creating a scandal by joining the communal concert on the green. Finally,
  the Scudamores, arm-in-arm, went up to bed.</p>

  <p>The shallow steps of the mahogany staircase were thickly covered with
  blue-and-red Turkey carpet. On the square landing, a marble lady, with a very
  good figure, which was completely draped, held up a cluster of lamps with
  rosy shades, so that the polar-bear rug was dyed pink. There was also a tall
  mirror, a palm&mdash;its shining fronds free from dust&mdash;and a marble
  console table, which held a jug of barley-water and two glasses.</p>

  <p>The lawyer smiled appreciatively as he poured out their customary
  night-cap.</p>

  <p>"Bar one slight episode, a very pleasant evening," he said, as he clinked
  his glass against his wife's. "My love to you. Happy days."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore sipped daintily and echoed his Toast.</p>

  <p>"My <i>love</i> to you. And Happy Days."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; LIFE AND DEATH</h2>

  <p class="first">THE next morning Mr. and Mrs. Scudamore were having
  breakfast in the prim morning-room of the Clock House. The sunlight streamed
  in through the east window, drawing sweetness from the mauve and white stocks
  on the table, and gleaming on the silver coffee-pot. The lawyer and his wife
  were finishing their conventional meal of ham-and-eggs, with marmalade and
  toast. He had extracted the essential parts of the <i>Morning Post</i>, and
  she had read the Births, Deaths and Marriages in the <i>Times</i>.
  Afterwards, they would exchange papers, and he would take away the
  <i>Times</i>, leaving her the <i>Post</i>.</p>

  <p>On this special morning, Mr. Scudamore was going up to London for the day,
  on business.</p>

  <p>"I hope to be back by seven, by the latest," he said. "Perhaps, and even
  probably, I shall be earlier. It all depends on which motor-bus I catch. They
  don't connect rigidly with the trains."</p>

  <p>"Then, dearest, shall we say seven-fifteen for dinner?" asked his wife.
  "You will be hungry and not want to wait."</p>

  <p>"Excellent, love. What are you doing today?"</p>

  <p>"I think I shall stay at home and finish off stray ends of work. I want to
  let the maids go to the Durley Dairy Show this afternoon, and I don't like to
  leave the house empty."</p>

  <p>"No, it is unwise."</p>

  <p>The lawyer accepted the current fiction that any unprotected woman could
  foil the felony of the most brutal tramp, by merely sitting in her own
  drawing room. But, since burglary was unknown in the village, she was safe
  enough.</p>

  <p>She looked up in faint surprise as the front-door bell rang. A minute
  later, a maid told the lawyer that Dr. Perry wished to see him.</p>

  <p>Husband and wife exchanged glances, their brows slightly raised; then the
  lawyer wiped his mouth, carefully avoiding treading a crumb into the carpet
  and crossed to the door.</p>

  <p>"Rather an unusual time for a visit," he observed. "It may be urgent. Will
  you excuse me, my dear?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Perry was standing in the study, examining a photograph of Lucerne,
  with a hint of that glazed and desperate resignation which is present in a
  dentist's waiting-room. His shabby, well-cut suit hung loosely on him, giving
  an impression of thinness, but his pale face was tranquil.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to disturb you at breakfast, Scudamore," he said. "But I wanted
  to know how Miss Corner's Sale went. When can I expect my legacy?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible to say," replied the lawyer. "The house will have to be
  disposed of by private treaty. All the bids were under the reserve."</p>

  <p>"Tiresome." The doctor's voice was light. "I rather want some ready money.
  My wife tells me my family needs a change of air."</p>

  <p>"But they are looking extremely well."</p>

  <p>"They <i>are</i> well. But my wife seems to think that sea air is
  indicated."</p>

  <p>From its immobility, the lawyer's shaven face might have been composed of
  grey asbestos; his long upper lip was grim in his effort not to betray
  understanding of a friend's financial need.</p>

  <p>"I can advance the money out of my own account," he said, "if that is more
  convenient to you."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. It would he rather useful."</p>

  <p>"Will tonight do? I'm catching the London train, at Cheltenham. Or shall I
  write a cheque now?"</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow will do excellently. You won't want to bother with business
  tonight. It's not so urgent. Thanks very much."</p>

  <p>Mr. Scudamore returned to the morning-room, where he reported every word
  of the conversation to his lady. Husband and wife shared each other's
  secrets, and Mrs. Scudamore never betrayed a business confidence.</p>

  <p>"It's that woman," declared the lawyer. "She's draining him for the
  children."</p>

  <p>"I agree, my love," said his wife. "Marianne is to blame. It is terrible
  when a woman thinks more of her children than of her husband."</p>

  <p>"Very terrible," agreed the lawyer, who had no children. His face
  expressed concern, for although he was many years the doctor's senior, both
  belonged to old local families. When Perry was a charming, quiet young man,
  he inherited St. James' House, together with a small private income and an
  excellent practice.</p>

  <p>At that time, everyone expected him to marry Vivian&mdash;the Squire's
  youngest daughter; but the War and sundry romantic complications
  intervened.</p>

  <p>Marianne Perry was always on her best behaviour at the Clock House, and
  the Scudamores accepted her for her husband's sake; but both resented her
  unbridled temperament and extravagance which had turned the gracious Queen
  Anne house into a nursery Bedlam.</p>

  <p>"He ought to have married Vivian," sighed Mrs. Scudamore.</p>

  <p>"You're right, my love," said the lawyer. "Mrs. Perry is doing his
  practice no good. The wife of a professional man should be a real help, in
  every way. Especially in a neighbourhood where an unblemished reputation is
  essential, in order to create and hold confidence."</p>

  <p>"Yes, my love. But I am proud that our standard is so high."</p>

  <p>"I feel the same." The lawyer looked at his wife with a fond smile.
  "Dearest, you are looking blooming. But, in the communal interest, don't you
  think you might have a neuralgic headache, or a touch of rheumatism? Nothing
  painful, but something which requires medical attention."</p>

  <p>"Dearest, you are always so thoughtful for others. I don't like false
  pretences, even in small things, but I promise you that the doctor shall soon
  pay a professional visit to the Clock House."</p>

  <p>She glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"And now, sweetheart, it is time for you to go," she said.</p>

  <p>The maid was waiting in the hall, with the lawyer's hat, umbrella and
  brief-case; but it was Mrs. Scudamore who flicked his coat-collar with a
  clothes-brush and checked his belongings. She also made sure that his
  buttonhole&mdash;a mauve carnation, flecked with crimson&mdash;was
  secure.</p>

  <p>Arm-in-arm, they strolled across the shaven lawn. At the gate, the lawyer
  raised his tall silk hat and kissed his wife, while she looked up at him with
  proud eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you realise you are out of fashion?" she asked with gentle irony.
  "Mrs. Perry tells me that spats are no longer worn. The smartest men wear
  patent leather boots with grey suede tops, and stiffened collars, of the same
  material as their shirts."</p>

  <p>The lawyer clicked.</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear. I'm afraid you will have to put up with me, as I am. Didn't I
  put up with a wife who always looks a gracious gentlewoman, while fashionable
  women cropped their heads and cut their skirts to their knees?"</p>

  <p>They made a charming study in mutual admiration. The lawyer was spruce in
  grey striped trousers, a black morning-coat, white slip and linen spats, and
  a tall hat. His wife wore a dark-prune silk dress, relieved with muslin
  collars and cuffs. A black velvet band encircled her throat, to hide the
  strings of her neck.</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Scudamore looked at his watch, and kissed his wife again. That
  was their private farewell, but the neighbours were given the benefit of
  their public parting. Holding her husband's arm, Mrs. Scudamore walked with
  him across the green, as far as the pond, where she remained
  standing&mdash;watching him until he had disappeared around the angle of the
  wall of St. James' House.</p>

  <p>He turned and raised his hat before he passed out of sight, while she
  waved to him. She saw him go, with the usual pang, as though he had passed
  out of her life, for ever, and she walked slowly home, with a sense of
  desolation in her heart.</p>

  <p>So, true lovers part.</p>

  <p>But when she had entered the gates of the Clock House, she reacted to the
  charm and order of the garden. Life swung her up again in the daily routine,
  and her step was as light as a girl's as she went to inspect an experimental
  bed of zinnias.</p>

  <p>While she stood, the sun streaming down on the coronet of her graying
  hair, she turned at the sound of hurrying footsteps, to see Mrs. Perry
  running up the drive, and committing the unforgivable sin kicking gravel over
  the grass in her haste.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore thought she must be the herald of disaster, until she saw
  that Marianne's eyes were brilliant and her teeth flashing in the
  sunlight.</p>

  <p>"I've news for you," she cried. "Marvellous&mdash;shattering&mdash;news.
  Another baby."</p>

  <p>"Another?" Mrs. Scudamore literally gasped, as she remembered the doctor's
  financial strait. "Congratulations," she added, with an effort. "What does
  your husband think of&mdash;of the increase?"</p>

  <p>"He hasn't had time to think. I stunned him with the glad tidings, half a
  minute ago. You've got the news red-hot. I just managed to scream it out to
  Nurse, and told her to spread it around the house."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore felt herself stiffening at this violation of reserve, which
  outraged every tradition of her code.</p>

  <p>"Isn't this announcement rather premature?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You can't get glorious news too soon," declared Marianne. "Think of it.
  It's too marvellous. New life. Life is the only thing that matters and death
  the only tragedy."</p>

  <p>"I don't hold that view," said Mrs. Scudamore. "When we die, our real life
  may begin."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Perry burst into a shriek of laughter.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you cheerful? But I must fly back. Meals must be ordered, if the
  house fall."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore, who never neglected the obligation of a hostess, walked
  with her to the gate.</p>

  <p>"Of course, you want me to keep it private that you expect a visit from
  the stork," she said.</p>

  <p>Marianne grimaced at the allusion to the conventional medium.</p>

  <p>"Don't," she groaned. "No damned bird shall steal my thunder. And spread
  it all you can. I want the world to know."</p>

  <p>A faint smile touched Mrs. Scudamore's withered, but well-cut lips.</p>

  <p>"You should keep calm," she said. "There's nothing to get excited about.
  Babies are merely incidental to marriage."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" flashed Marianne. "You've never had one. Life is the
  greatest thing of all."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore shook her head.</p>

  <p>"When you've been married as long as I have," she said, "you will know
  that the greatest thing is love."</p>

  <p>As Marianne rushed across the green, back to St. James' House, she felt a
  certain contemptuous pity for Mrs. Scudamore.</p>

  <p>'Poor old thing, all dolled up, for nothing to happen. No children. That
  beautiful house and garden wasted on one lousy cat.'</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore walked into her spacious hall, scented with a bowl of
  freshly-cut mignonette, and contrasted the delight and security of a well-run
  house and a balanced budget with the leaky finances and slip-shod management
  of the doctor's home.</p>

  <p>'Poor Horatio. Why didn't he marry Vivian? He didn't know, when he called,
  this morning, of the ultimate tragedy.' She stooped, to encourage her cat,
  who was washing vigorously, in order to satisfy the high standard of
  cleanliness which prevailed at the Clock House.</p>

  <p>"Good Jeremy. Such a lot of shirt-front to wash. Good cat."</p>

  <p>Then she went into the kitchen to order the dinner, for, as Marianne had
  declared, meals must be ordered, whatever the cosmic conditions.</p>

  <p>"Make it seven-fifteen," she said. "The master will be tired. Give me
  something that is easily prepared for my own lunch. Directly you've washed
  up, you can all go to the Dairy Show."</p>

  <p>"What about your own tea?" asked the cook dutifully.</p>

  <p>"I'll get it myself."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, madam. Suppose there should be visitors?"</p>

  <p>"I shall not be at home to anyone."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore went through her usual morning routine. She put on her
  thick gloves and a shady hat and did a little ladylike gardening. After she
  had washed her hands, she drank a glass of buttermilk, and went into the
  drawing-room, to write letters.</p>

  <p>She sat longer than usual at the bureau; one letter in particular, was
  difficult to compose, besides which she had to plan a list of dinners for the
  week. There was also some printing to be done, chiefly labels for jam; as she
  was noted for neat handiwork.</p>

  <p>Just as she finished declining the invitation to the wedding of the
  Bishop's daughter, owing to a previous engagement, lunch was announced. As
  she ate, she finished a novel, the end of which she was anxious to know. It
  proved satisfactory, for everyone got married.</p>

  <p>At intervals, she raised her eyes from the pages, to look through the
  window at St. James' House. Life was rioting through that house. She could
  almost see it quiver, like the jags of summer lightning, electric with
  creative force.</p>

  <p>Then she gazed around the order of her prim room, and shook her head. Love
  was best.</p>

  <p>A maid brought her coffee out to her, on the verandah, and announced that
  the kitchen regions were left in order. A little later, she heard discreetly
  lowered voices and the crunching of gravel, as the entire domestic staff
  crossed the drive, on its way to the trades-people's entrance. Slightly
  self-conscious in their best finery, the girls pretended to be oblivious of
  their mistress, who passed them in review.</p>

  <p>"Parker," she called.</p>

  <p>The kitchen-maid, unfamiliar in a yellow hat, stepped bashfully
  forward.</p>

  <p>"Parker," said her mistress quietly, "have you ever seen <i>me</i> wearing
  a yellow hat?"</p>

  <p>"No, mum," murmured the girl.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, if you want to look like a lady, you must dress like
  one."</p>

  <p>"Go up and put on your white hat," commanded the cook. "And be sharp."</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Scudamore&mdash;always considerate of her
  staff&mdash;intervened.</p>

  <p>"No, she mustn't make the rest of you late for the bus. Go as you are,
  Parker. Only, I want you to count how many <i>ladies</i> wear yellow hats at
  the Show."</p>

  <p>The domestic staff went on its way, and silence fell on the Clock House.
  Mrs. Scudamore sat and looked at the lawn, mottled with shade and sunlight.
  Presently, she went into the kitchen and poured out a saucer of milk, which
  she placed in the corner of the verandah, where the cat&mdash;who was settled
  in his ways&mdash;would expect to find it, at four o'clock.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, she went all over the house, going to every room, from attic
  to cellar. There is a certain fascination in roaming through an empty
  dwelling, which was felt by Mrs. Scudamore.</p>

  <p>The order and cleanliness which was evident in the unused attics pleased
  her sense of housewifery. One was full of empty cardboard dress-boxes, all
  neatly piled, and shelves of jam-pots, which showed no trace of dust.</p>

  <p>When she descended to a lower floor, she ran her finger over the enamel
  ledges in the White Room, to see if it lived up to the alleged purity of its
  name, while her heart swelled with the pride of a hostess at her own little
  arrangements for the comfort of her guests.</p>

  <p>On the writing-table of her husband's study, was placed the latest
  portrait of himself. It was there as a companion to her own photograph, for
  she insisted that she could not be separated from him, even in pictorial
  form.</p>

  <p>It presented him at his grimmest phase, but she looked at it intently,
  before she kissed the glass of its frame. Then she placed the copy of the
  <i>Morning Post</i>, together with the letter, on the blotter, tore a
  forgotten leaf from the calendar, and went out.</p>

  <p>The end of her journey was in the small tiled scullery.</p>

  <p>Opening a drawer, she found a pile of cloths, with which she sandbagged
  the window. After fastening a label&mdash;written that morning&mdash;to the
  outside of the door, with drawing-pins, she shut herself inside the
  scullery.</p>

  <p>A warning was printed on the paper in large letters.</p>

  <p>'BEWARE OF THE GAS'.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; THE LAWYER PULLS UP A BLIND</h2>

  <p class="first">AT four o'clock, Jeremy&mdash;the cat&mdash;who was punctual
  as the Greenwich Time Signal, drank his milk and washed his shirt-front, in
  readiness for dinner. Two hours later, the servants, excited and happy,
  returned from the Dairy Show, to discover the tragedy of a dead mistress.</p>

  <p>It was Parker of the yellow hat, who heroically stormed the gas-filled
  scullery, to open the windows and drag out the lifeless body, while the
  distracted cook telephoned for Dr. Perry.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore&mdash;although punctilious in the fulfillment of
  promises&mdash;was unable to keep her word to her husband, that the doctor
  should pay an early professional visit to the Clock House. Dr. Perry had just
  been called away to a case in the country. However, the voice at the other
  end of the wire added that the Cheltenham doctor's car had been seen to pass
  through the village, on its way to the Hall.</p>

  <p>Not long afterwards, the Squire's new doctor arrived at the Clock House,
  only to tell them what they already knew. Mrs. Scudamore had been dead for
  several hours. Efficient in all things, she had made a neat and thorough job
  of her exit.</p>

  <p>But, although he could not restore her to life, the doctor proved of use,
  for he met Mr. Scudamore on his return from London, and told him the tragic
  news.</p>

  <p>The lawyer, although plainly stunned, did not break down. He read the
  letter, addressed to himself, which lay on his study table, and then went
  upstairs to his wife's room, where he remained for a little time. Afterwards,
  he asked the doctor to send for the Rector.</p>

  <p>When he heard the news over the telephone, the Rector was not only
  shocked, but cold with uncomprehended fear.</p>

  <p>"<i>Suicide?</i>" he repeated blankly.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid there's no doubt about it," replied the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Horrible. How's Scudamore?"</p>

  <p>"Bearing up wonderfully. He has iron self-control. Can you come over soon?
  I don't want to leave him alone."</p>

  <p>"I'll be across in five minutes," promised the Rector.</p>

  <p>He was surprised to find everything apparently normal at the Clock House,
  for he had vaguely expected to see visible signs of disruption. The cat, with
  one green eye fixed on his invisible watch, had changed for dinner, and sat
  waiting on the verandah, a patient gentleman in correct black-and-white.</p>

  <p>When the front door was opened by the cook, the Rector had a glimpse,
  through an open door, of the dining-table ready laid for dinner, with all the
  usual flower-vases and candle-sticks.</p>

  <p>"The master's bearing up wonderfully," she said. "The doctor's just gone.
  I'm glad you've come, parson. Perhaps you'll stay to dinner and get him to
  eat something, to keep up his strength."</p>

  <p>"I'll do my best," promised the Rector.</p>

  <p>The lawyer was pacing the drawing-room when he entered. His face looked
  grey as an extinct volcano, but his voice was under complete control.</p>

  <p>"Good of you to come," he said, as the Rector, unable to speak, gripped
  his hand. "You have heard my wife has committed suicide. There will be an
  Inquest. I want you to hear the true facts from me."</p>

  <p>The muscles of his face worked painfully, like machinery which is wrenched
  the wrong way, in his effort to keep his tone steady, as he dropped his
  bombshell.</p>

  <p>"My wife and I were not married, to each other."</p>

  <p>The Rector stared in incredulous horror around the prim drawing-room,
  which to him had been the typical apartment of a decorous married couple, and
  which now, was bracketed with a love-nest. He stared from the family
  miniatures on the wall to the lawyer's white linen spats.</p>

  <p>Then the unconscious actor within him arose to meet the drama of the
  situation. His voice throbbed with feeling as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you like. It will make no difference. I have always admired
  Mrs. Scudamore."</p>

  <p>The lawyer did not respond to his emotion, for he began to speak in dry
  precise phrases.</p>

  <p>"I want you to understand it was entirely my fault, not hers. It was
  generally believed I married a widow. But she is legally married to a drunken
  brute, who is now an incurable, in a Mental Home. We fell in love&mdash;and I
  swept her off her feet. I literally wrenched her from her moorings of
  innocence. When she came away with me, she went against the whole grain of
  her nature."</p>

  <p>"I understand," murmured the Rector, as the lawyer paused.</p>

  <p>When he went on speaking, he used the present tense, a significant symptom
  of a mind still too jammed by shock, for realisation.</p>

  <p>"My wife comes of a clerical family, with rather a rigid outlook. Her
  father was a Dean and she moved in an exclusive social circle. Her nature is
  strictly conventional. She has no imagination and little sympathy. She is
  censorious towards others and very sensitive to any outside criticism of
  herself...I tell you this, because of my love for her. It may help you to
  realise something else."</p>

  <p>For a moment, he was overcome, for he covered his eyes with his hand. The
  Rector waited, in silent sympathy, for him to regain mastery over his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Now that you know what her nature was, don't you see that it would have
  been easier for her to have felt remorse for her conduct? It would have
  salved her conscience to be miserable. She would have looked upon her
  suffering in the light of expiation...But she loved me so entirely that she
  insisted that we must be <i>happy</i> in our love. She said it was my due,
  and that there must be no question of sacrifice. She often said that she
  never wished the past undone, and that we must justify our love by a life of
  perfect happiness and understanding."</p>

  <p>As the lawyer paused for breath, the Rector thought of those evening
  walks, which advertised the Scudamores' wedded companionship, and the
  conventional atmosphere of the Clock House, which had hall-stamped it as the
  home of a happily-married professional couple.</p>

  <p>And he understood. It was in this happiness that Mrs. Scudamore had made
  the supreme sacrifice to love.</p>

  <p>"I think she was wonderful," he said.</p>

  <p>"I see. You <i>do</i> understand," remarked the lawyer. "Thank you. Now I
  have something else to say."</p>

  <p>His voice grew stronger with his anger.</p>

  <p>"I want you to know that my wife was hounded to her death by poisonous
  anonymous letters. She had been receiving them for some time past, but she
  said nothing of them to me. They contained vague, cowardly charges, saying
  her secret life of hypocrisy was known, and that she would be exposed in her
  true light. The last one warned her that the end was near."</p>

  <p>The Rector listened, aghast and cold with horror. It was what he had
  feared when he first heard of Mrs. Scudamore's suicide, but he had forgotten
  his premonition.</p>

  <p>"She left me a letter," went on the lawyer, "saying she could not bring
  disgrace on me, or ruin my professional career...And, all this time, she has
  been her usual self&mdash;serene, sensible, gay. She has never given one sign
  of any secret trouble. But, at the end, she lost her grip. Those damnable
  letters got her down."</p>

  <p>The lawyer crossed to the door.</p>

  <p>"Will you see her?" he asked, taking the Rector's assent for granted, and
  leading the way.</p>

  <p>In the hall, he stopped to speak to the cook, who still waited, expectant
  of orders, outside the dining-room door.</p>

  <p>"Give the cat his dinner."</p>

  <p>The Scudamores' bedroom was so plainly the room of a married couple who
  believed in perpetual companionship, that the Rector almost felt he ought to
  apologise for his presence there, to the lady lying on the big double bed. It
  was a huge apartment, handsomely furnished, and not crowded, although every
  bit of solid furniture was duplicated. Mr. Scudamore's dressing-room was
  evidently only a store-room for his spare clothes.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scudamore was wearing her prune silk dress, and looked darkly
  composed, and ladylike, even in death. There was no sign of being reduced to
  the common level of mortality, for she faintly preserved an illusion of
  superiority. Her hair was still in perfect order. Apparently, no essential
  hairpin had fallen from its place, in the struggle to recall her to life.</p>

  <p>The Rector bent over her and impulsively kissed a cold hand. As he did so,
  he had a confused memory of a similar homage paid to Miss Asprey.</p>

  <p>'<i>Who</i> had stabbed her so cruelly in the back?' he asked himself
  fearfully.</p>

  <p>As the lawyer looked at his wife, he nearly broke down.</p>

  <p>"If she had only told me," he muttered. "I should have known how to deal
  with those letters. If there had been any scandal to face, we'd have faced it
  together. It was such an <i>unnecessary</i> sacrifice."</p>

  <p>Regaining his self-control, he walked from the room, followed by the
  Rector. When the two men reached the hall, the Rector was reminded of his
  promise to the cook, by another glimpse of the dining-table.</p>

  <p>"Have you had dinner?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Presently," was the vague reply.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;what about a stiff shot of whisky?"</p>

  <p>"No, no. The doctor gave me something to brace me."</p>

  <p>Although Mr. Scudamore was plainly anxious to be alone, the Rector made
  another effort.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to be a nuisance," he said, "but might I stay with you? Just
  for company. I wouldn't say one word. But you would know someone was
  there."</p>

  <p>Mr. Scudamore tried to smile as he shook his head. "Very kind of you,
  Rector, but I'm all right. I have some important writing to do."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he opened the front door. Then his eye fell on the prosperous
  cat, who was washing after a good dinner.</p>

  <p>"There is something you can do for me," he said. "Could you get the cat a
  good home? It belonged to my wife. I couldn't bear to see it round."</p>

  <p>That speech should have warned the Rector. But the lawyer's face was so
  calm, and his voice so dry and precise, that he was fooled into believing
  that all was well.</p>

  <p>"I'll have him at the Rectory," he promised eagerly. "My dog's a sociable
  beggar. They won't fight."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Mr. Scudamore.</p>

  <p>The two men shook hands and the Rector went out of the open door.</p>

  <p>When he had gone a few yards down the drive, he stopped to light a
  cigarette, in order to soothe his jangled nerves. As he did so, he heard the
  report of the shot with which the lawyer blew out his brains.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; THE SNAKE-HEAD</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Rector got away from the Clock House as soon as he
  could, having left Dr. Perry in charge. When he returned to the Rectory, he
  appeared so broken by the double tragedy that Ignatius confined his comments
  to practical sympathy.</p>

  <p>But, as he watched the Rector swallow that stiff shot of whisky which he
  had recommended to the lawyer, his own interest boiled over.</p>

  <p>"This is a really extraordinary twist." he said. "Especially after our
  dinner at the Clock House, and my remarks to you afterwards."</p>

  <p>"I remember them. Don't rub them in now," groaned the Rector.</p>

  <p>"I'm not gloating. The fact is, for the first time, I am moved to admire
  the Scudamores. They actually star in Love's Register with Paul and
  Virginia."</p>

  <p>A whimsical grin touched his lips.</p>

  <p>"It's curious to picture an elderly, respectable solicitor, complete with
  spats, being whirled through Eternity, clasped to his paramour. But I can't
  imagine the stately Mrs. Scudamore without any clothes...What's
  angel-skin?"</p>

  <p>"Don't&mdash;know."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I. But I was once privileged to pay a lady's bills, in return
  for the freedom of her murky mind. As my interest in her was purely
  metaphysical, I had no knowledge of her wardrobe. But I remember the
  item&mdash;'angel-skin'."</p>

  <p>He broke off to speak to the dog.</p>

  <p>"Charles Dickens, don't you agree with me that, at this minute, Mr. and
  Mrs. Scudamore are defying the whirlwind in bath-sheets of angel-skin?"</p>

  <p>"Shut up," growled the Rector.</p>

  <p>"Good. I've got you roused. My object is achieved."</p>

  <p>The Rector, who was holding his head in his hands, looked up, and smiled
  faintly.</p>

  <p>"It's decent of you not to crow," he said. "Especially as it has turned
  out to be your snake-head."</p>

  <p>"Did you see any of the anonymous letters?" asked Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"No. Mrs. Scudamore destroyed them all before her&mdash;her
  <i>murder</i>."</p>

  <p>"Now, Tigger, don't overdo it and sanctify her. I told you I didn't like
  her, because I thought her a humbug. That holds still. The whole truth is
  that she killed herself because she couldn't endure the thought of exposure.
  She hadn't the guts to sit tight, and she left the poor old boy to face the
  music...Can you imagine Joan Brook throwing in her hand before her bluff was
  called?"</p>

  <p>"They're different generations," said the Rector. "Still, I agree it was
  an unnecessary sacrifice. Poor Scudamore called it that."</p>

  <p>He rubbed his eyes wearily, and then bounded to his feet with his old
  energy.</p>

  <p>"I clean forgot. This will be an awful shock to Miss Asprey. I'll go over
  now, and break it gently, before she hears it from one of her maids."</p>

  <p>The vivid interest which licked Ignatius' face was like a white tongue of
  lightning.</p>

  <p>"I'll come, too," he said eagerly. "I suppose it's not too late?"</p>

  <p>"No, they'll still be up."</p>

  <p>But when the two men had passed through the gates of The Spout', no light
  shone through the diamond-paned windows. As they walked through the gurgling
  darkness of the garden, they were conscious of a damp desolation, as though
  an ancient house had lived too long.</p>

  <p>The lantern glowed in the porch, so the Rector knocked on the old oak
  door.</p>

  <p>"They must be sitting in the study," he whispered.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, Ada&mdash;whose sleepy eyes brightened at the sight of
  Ignatius&mdash;showed them into the front panelled parlour, where Miss
  Asprey, seated in a high-backed carven chair, was reading by the light of a
  single lamp. Miss Mack sat somewhere in the shadow, and was knitting.</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey raised her silver head, and looked at the Rector with faint
  surprise. Ignatius, who lingered in the background, admired the butterfly
  touch with which the Rector broke the news to the frail lady.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to call so late, but I have some dreadful news for you. Mr. and
  Mrs. Scudamore are both dead. A double suicide."</p>

  <p>Although she looked so ethereal, Miss Asprey proved resistant to the
  shock. She maintained her self-control, and gave no sign of nervous tension.
  Her lips did not quiver, and the thin white hands, which held a heavy book,
  did not tremble. As she listened, the lines of her face were rigid, as though
  carven in marble.</p>

  <p>Only Ignatius noticed that first swift interchange of glances between her
  and Miss Mack.</p>

  <p>"This is a terrible shock," said Miss Asprey. "Terrible. I can hardly
  realise it. It was thoughtful of you to come, Rector."</p>

  <p>"My first thought was for you," he assured her. "I knew what a blow it
  would be."</p>

  <p>"It is indeed. If it is not too painful for you, may I hear the
  details?"</p>

  <p>She listened to the story with a certain detached compassion.</p>

  <p>"But why did they do this dreadful thing?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He followed her. And she was driven to it by poisonous anonymous
  letters," declared the Rector, his voice shaking with anger.</p>

  <p>"Still, I don't understand? What had she to fear?"</p>

  <p>"Exposure. I suppose it's all over the village, by now. She wasn't married
  to Scudamore."</p>

  <p>"<i>Oh!</i>" Miss Asprey's strangled exclamation was almost a sob. But
  Ignatius noticed a faint flush of human interest on her cheek. He also
  remarked the tonic effect of the tragedy upon another life of dull routine,
  for the little companion's smiling face held suppressed excitement.</p>

  <p>When Miss Asprey spoke, her voice was wrung with pity.</p>

  <p>"Poor souls. We must not judge them. Sorrow expiates sin, and they must
  have suffered, every hour of their lives."</p>

  <p>The Rector thought of Mr. Scudamore's final speech for the defence.</p>

  <p>"There were condoning circumstances&mdash;" he began, but Miss Asprey
  stopped him.</p>

  <p>"Nothing can condone sin, but suffering may help to atone." She glanced at
  the antique clock, which was still patiently carrying on with its job of
  chopping up time. "Thank you for coming. I appreciate your thought
  deeply."</p>

  <p>The Rector moved to the door.</p>

  <p>"It's late," he said, "and you'll both want to go to bed."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I think," she murmured, "that <i>they</i> will sleep better to-night than
  any of us."</p>

  <p>The Rector was silent on the homeward way. When they reached the study,
  Charles met them, and plainly indicated that, while they were welcome to the
  worthless whisky, he was guarding the precious biscuits with his life. The
  Rector fed him, and then glanced at Ignatius, who had sunk into a chair.</p>

  <p>"You look peaked, Ignatius. I've ridden you too hard with my parochial
  worries."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Ignatius, "it was the atmosphere of Miss Asprey's room.
  Although it was raw, it was also close&mdash;and I respond like a pimpernel,
  to atmosphere."</p>

  <p>"That's queer," remarked the Rector. "Miss Asprey is the sort of Spartan
  who lives in a perpetual draught."</p>

  <p>"Then she's had a change of heart. Didn't you notice that every window was
  shuttered?"</p>

  <p>"No. Then that explains why we didn't see any light."</p>

  <p>"We haven't seen it for several nights...Where are your eyes?...Directly I
  entered the room, I was vaguely reminded, by those bars, of a
  prison-house."</p>

  <p>But the Rector's thoughts were elsewhere.</p>

  <p>"Ignatius," he appealed, "you won't go back now?"</p>

  <p>"Aha. Ignatius Stock is booming," gloated the bitter little man. "But I'll
  see you through, padre. Sit down, and let me think."</p>

  <p>The Rector dropped heavily into a chair, while Ignatius smoked in silence.
  Presently he spoke, out of a blue haze.</p>

  <p>"Those letters contain no suggestion of blackmail. That is unusual. But
  they threaten. So they would appear to be actuated by some disordered mind,
  which craves to make others suffer...And yet, I have a strong suspicion that
  there is a purpose behind them, and an ugly purpose, too. <i>What?</i> I
  shall know when I find out why a certain woman never smiles."</p>

  <p>But the Rector&mdash;worn out&mdash;had dropped off to sleep.</p>

  <p>Across the Green, Dr. Perry was still at his post, and too stimulated by
  the double tragedy to feel weariness. True to his character of spectator, he
  had forgotten his own worries in the human problem of the Scudamores.</p>

  <p>He remained for some time at the Clock House, for he had to send for the
  woman who acted as professional layer-out in the village, and also to
  interview the police, in the person of Sergeant James.</p>

  <p>When, at last, he returned home, his wife's reception was like a blow in
  the face.</p>

  <p>"Horatio. Have you got the cheque?"</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, staring at her blankly. "He was going to write it,
  tomorrow." He glanced at the bedroom clock, and added, with a strained laugh,
  "it's tomorrow now."</p>

  <p>"Then he's let you down. Damn him."</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake, Marianne, <i>don't</i>."</p>

  <p>"I will. I'm thinking of my babies. My babies."</p>

  <p>"They'll be all right, if you'll only listen to reason and sack the
  nurse."</p>

  <p>"I won't. They shan't be sacrificed. I'll starve first."</p>

  <p>St. James' House was almost hidden from the green, by those tall,
  rose-brick walls; but the bedroom windows were visible to passers by. They
  glowed in mellow yellow squares, symbolic of the golden life of a happy
  marriage.</p>

  <p>Behind the drawn blinds were a distracted woman and an exasperated man.
  Angry faces&mdash;raised voices. An unfamiliar couple, unknown to their own
  social circle. Then the doctor made an effort to calm his wife.</p>

  <p>"Things will be better soon."</p>

  <p>"They won't," declared Marianne. "They'll be worse. Everyone will say
  <i>you</i> wrote those letters."</p>

  <p>"Why should they? I received one myself."</p>

  <p>"But nobody knows that."</p>

  <p>"The padre and his friend know. You thoughtfully read the letter out to
  them."</p>

  <p>Shaken by the gales of inconsistency, Marianne shifted her position.</p>

  <p>"And they talked about it. They spread it all over the village that you
  poisoned Miss Corner, to get her money. I <i>know</i> it...Why doesn't the
  Squire send for you any more? If he did, all the others would. They follow
  him, like a flock of sheep...Horatio, you've <i>got</i> to get him back, or
  my babies will starve."</p>

  <p>As she threw herself across the bed, in a passion of tears, the doctor
  crossed to the door. She raised herself and stared at him, through the black
  cowlicks of her hair.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"To another woman."</p>

  <p>With a sudden change of mood, Marianne began to laugh.
  "That&mdash;anyway&mdash;is a lie."</p>

  <p>But her husband kept his word. He hurried blindly out of the house,
  crossed the green, and entered the churchyard, through a small iron
  side-gate. Threading his familiar way between the sunken graves of the poor
  and the railed vaults of the wealthy, he stopped before a mound which was
  still raw.</p>

  <p>He had come, for consolation, to his friend, Julia Corner.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; NIGHT-SCENE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE next day the village hummed with the news. Everyone was
  shocked and filled with pity, but the chief emotion was excitement. The local
  ladies and gentlemen were all kindly, charitable souls, but each, in turn,
  had chafed under Mrs. Scudamore's mild, reproachful gaze and lifted brow.</p>

  <p>While Miss Asprey ruled by sweet saintliness, she stood as guardian of the
  conventional law. It was only human nature to be intrigued by the fact that
  she had actually filled a position which she would have been first to condemn
  in another.</p>

  <p>When Vivian Sheriff heard of the suicides she was almost stunned with
  shock. Obedient and law-abiding, she had faithfully observed the traffic
  signals of Mrs. Scudamore's uplifted hand. The fact of her violent death
  filled her with horror, but the story of her double life was a heavier
  blow.</p>

  <p>Her mother was twittering about the tragedy, all over the morning-room. To
  get out of range of her squeaks and moans, Vivian lit a cigarette and went
  into the rose-garden.</p>

  <p>She rarely smoked, so the tobacco soon soothed her nerves. It was a
  brilliant morning&mdash;blue and windy&mdash;with dew still sparkling in
  pockets on the rose-walk, where the ramblers hung in scarlet clusters.</p>

  <p>In spite of the tragic news, Vivian was light-hearted, that day, for she
  was expecting a letter from Major Blair. She had not seen him since Joan
  intervened, at a critical moment, as he had gone to London, on business. But
  he had rung her up to say he would write to her.</p>

  <p>Vivian knew that he never sent a letter, if he could use the telephone or
  telegraph-wire, so she could gauge the significance of his promise. Her hopes
  were high as she waited for the postman, who was late in reaching the
  Hall.</p>

  <p>But, although she tried to concentrate on brides-maids and
  engagement-rings, her thoughts persisted in returning to Mrs. Scudamore.</p>

  <p>'I was so afraid of her. And all the time...It doesn't bear thinking
  of.'</p>

  <p>The postman appeared round the bend of the lane, and she ran to the gate
  to receive the letters. There was a large number, and she carried the pile to
  a rustic table, to sort them out.</p>

  <p>Almost the first one she picked up was addressed to her, in Major Blair's
  thick, black handwriting. Her fingers trembled slightly as she tore it open.
  It was written from his Club, and began with the most effective opening
  gambit for holding interest.</p>

  <p>Will you marry me?'</p>

  <p>Vivian's heart beat very little faster, for she was not emotional; but her
  small pink face was wreathed in smiles as she read the letter through to its
  satisfactory end. Then she let it slip to the ground, while her imagination
  ran riot.</p>

  <p>'Diamonds,' she decided.</p>

  <p>Presently, she looked at the rest of the letters, to find, at the bottom
  of the pile, one envelope addressed to herself, in printed characters. With a
  nasty little sinking feeling, she tore it open, and stared at the
  roughly-blocked message.</p>

  <p>'You are not married yet. Remember, there's many a slip. Wait until the
  Major knows <i>all about you</i>. I will show you up next.'</p>

  <p>Vivian pushed her fingers distractedly through her hair and tried to
  think, only to be horrified by her first coherent thought.</p>

  <p>'Thank Heaven, Mrs. Scudamore can't know.'</p>

  <p>Then, as the situation began to be revealed in a stronger light, she
  relieved her feelings with an hysterical laugh.</p>

  <p>'It <i>would</i> come, just now. But who sent it? The only person who
  knows, doesn't care any more. Suppose he does, and is jealous. But that's
  absurd. If I tax him with this, I shall only be giving myself away to him. Or
  even putting ideas into his head...No, I must take no notice. This is one of
  those letters that are going about, at present. Just a lucky shot in the
  dark.'</p>

  <p>Vivian was a cool-headed little person, and not liable to panic. Because
  her conscience was clear on the main issue, she was able to sum up the
  position better than Mrs. Scudamore.</p>

  <p>But, as she walked slowly back to the house, the poison began to seep
  slowly through her system, numbing the pleasure of anticipation. Little black
  threads of doubt swam before her mental vision.</p>

  <p>'Suppose Fred gets a letter about <i>me</i>. He'd be too angry to treat it
  like his own. He has two standards, one for himself and one for women. He'd
  ask questions, and I might give myself away...Or this might be a genuine
  letter about the bungalow. If so, I'm sunk. Fred would shy at the least hint
  of scandal.'</p>

  <p>Fear stalked her through the garden and up the shallow steps of the
  terrace.</p>

  <p>As she lingered in the hall, she could hear her parents' voices in the
  morning-room. But, instead of telling them of the Major's letter, she left
  the post in the hall while she put through a long-distance call to
  London.</p>

  <p>It was not until she had accepted the Major's proposal of marriage, over
  the telephone, that she felt a shade more secure. Smoothing back the sleek
  wave of her fair hair, with a slightly self-conscious gesture, she walked
  into the morning-room and made her welcome announcement.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were going to be left on the shelf," roared the Squire.</p>

  <p>"Vivian didn't want to leave her mother," said Mrs. Sheriff. She added
  hastily, "I'll send the announcement to the <i>Times</i>, today."</p>

  <p>"No," suggested Vivian. "Better wire it over the phone. It's quicker."</p>

  <p>"I will. And I must let Lady d'Arcy know at once. I'll ring her
  up&mdash;and Mrs. Scudamore."</p>

  <p>"You'll have trouble in getting through to Mrs. Scudamore," remarked the
  Squire grimly. "Her line's permanently out of order."</p>

  <p>"Oh dear, I forgot. How dreadful of me." Mrs. Sheriff lowered her voice.
  "Vivian, I want to send flowers. But is it the usual funeral?"</p>

  <p>"They're burying the usual body," grunted the Squire.</p>

  <p>"You don't understand, Osbert. This is suicide. There are probably
  differences. Flowers may be in bad taste...I do wish someone could tell
  me."</p>

  <p>She knew that she was missing Mrs. Scudamore, who would have known exactly
  how to behave in such a case. Even now, she vaguely feared to offend the
  guardian of public taste by outraging her funeral.</p>

  <p>"Anyway," she said, blinking away a tear, "I shall go and see her, and
  strew some of my own lilies inside her coffin, where no one will see them.
  But I should like her to have known about Vivian. She'd have been most
  interested."</p>

  <p>The postman proved the bearer of other important news that morning. Among
  the letters which he brought for Ignatius, was one that the little man read
  with keen interest.</p>

  <p>He looked up from the flimsy, typed pages with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>"I've just got the reports in from my confidential enquiry agent. In view
  of the latest development they're invaluable. They prove that I am on the
  right track."</p>

  <p>The Rector frowned.</p>

  <p>"Are you burrowing into the private affairs of my parishioners?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I told you I had done so. Don't you ever listen to me? I say nothing that
  is irrelevant."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;what have you discovered?"</p>

  <p>"A little back-history of two ladies. Don't worry. It is all very
  discreet."</p>

  <p>"It's indecent."</p>

  <p>"No, they'll never know. I keep within limits. I would <i>like</i> to
  question the old clergyman who lunched here the other day; but I knew that it
  would be an outrage, and that he would refuse&mdash;and properly so&mdash;to
  tell me anything."</p>

  <p>The Rector sighed heavily.</p>

  <p>"When will all this end?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Soon, I hope," replied Ignatius. "But it is essential to get a specimen
  of the handwriting&mdash;or rather, the printing&mdash;of our anonymous
  friend. We have only Miss Asprey's envelope. That's where you can be
  useful."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Preach on the tragedy, and make it one of your special efforts. Heavy
  guns. Don't ask your congregation for their secrets&mdash;for you won't get
  them. But appeal for the envelope in which any letter has been sent. Someone
  might have kept theirs."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me that there have been other letters, besides Mrs.
  Scudamore's?" asked the Rector, aghast.</p>

  <p>"My good man, they've been broadcast over the village. Everyone knows
  about them&mdash;except you."</p>

  <p>The Rector took the taunt in silence. He was horrified to learn that, all
  this time, a poisonous sewer had been flowing just under the surface of his
  clear, sparkling river. The village was tainted by an undertow.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "I will do my best to induce someone to speak."</p>

  <p>Even though the world in general had to wait twenty-four hours for the
  formal announcement of Vivian's engagement, the news was soon known locally,
  through the usual village wireless. It was a pleasant antidote to the
  Scudamore tragedy. Only one person&mdash;Joan Brook&mdash;was not moved to
  unselfish pleasure.</p>

  <p>She was still restless and unhappy on her own account, and was too honest
  to force jubilation over the good-fortune of a girl she did not like.</p>

  <p>That evening, after sunset, Ignatius met her, drooping on the green.</p>

  <p>"So you've overcome your fear of the dark?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She smiled back, glad, for once, of his spiteful company.</p>

  <p>"Amusing fiction, isn't it? I've got two fists and a complete set of
  finger-nails, besides a kick like a kangaroo...Hulloa, Edie."</p>

  <p>She broke off to greet a tall, overgrown girl of about sixteen, who had
  just emerged from the shadow of the chestnut avenue. She was walking quickly
  while she finished eating a wedge of Cornish pasty, cramming the crust inside
  her mouth, in her haste to swallow it.</p>

  <p>"Eating as usual?" went on Joan. "You'll lose your waistline. Anyone would
  think you were kept short."</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>no</i>, miss," protested Edie. "I get plenty to eat in my place.
  But mother's baking, and she gave me this, just to try."</p>

  <p>Joan looked after her retreating figure.</p>

  <p>"That girl worries me," she said. "She goes home, every evening, to see
  her mother, and I meet her coming back, always eating. But she is growing
  thinner. What d'you make of it?"</p>

  <p>It was Ignatius' chance, and he took it.</p>

  <p>"It is evident that she doesn't get enough to eat at her employer's and
  dare not complain, because of local prejudice. Probably her mother is in poor
  circumstances and is supported by charity."</p>

  <p>"Good shot. That girl's mistress is a philanthropist and does an awful lot
  of good. But she's terribly refined, and thinks it's gross to eat too much.
  She and her daughter divide an egg between them for their lunch, and their
  old cook-housekeeper is a shrivelled mummy, and does the same...It's not
  meanness. They simply don't understand a growing girl has an appetite. I
  expect there's a regular allowance for food and it's never been altered. But
  isn't it hopeless?"</p>

  <p>"It illustrates an abuse of the Feudal System, which seems to work so
  excellently here. I've no doubt that girl's family is much better off than
  most families on the Dole. So, naturally, her mother would forbid her to say
  a word."</p>

  <p>"If she did, she wouldn't be believed," declared Joan. "Suppose, for
  instance, <i>I</i> tackled her mistress, she would merely suspect Edie of
  telling lies, and me of being a mischief-maker. She could only be influenced
  by the pressure of public opinion. And there's no one here&mdash;not even the
  Rector&mdash;who would attack a pillar of all the charitable societies."</p>

  <p>She shook back her mane of hair impatiently.</p>

  <p>"What's the use of talking when you can't do anything? I am going to
  stroll through the village before I get back. I love it when it's lit up and
  everyone indoors."</p>

  <p>Ignatius walked with her to the end of the village. Joan was silent, most
  of the time, as she gazed into shadowy gardens, choked with flowers and lumpy
  with bee-hives, or lingered to stare at lighted windows.</p>

  <p>They turned back when they reached the dark stretch of country, outside
  the 'King's Head'. On their return journey, Joan was moved to another
  confidence.</p>

  <p>"I'm always fascinated by this night-scene. It reminds me of something out
  of a play. I have a friend who writes, and she once turned it all into a
  sensational serial. According to her, everyone here led a double life. The
  extraordinary part is, she was right about the Scudamores."</p>

  <p>"Did she say they were not married?" asked Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"She said they were living in sin, and she made up an idiotic yarn,
  describing Mrs. Scudamore's absurd French farce pyjamas and the bucket of
  champagne, tied up with a pink ribbon bow."</p>

  <p>"What else did she say?"</p>

  <p>"I forget. Oh, she pretended Miss Corner was a secret drinker. That was
  rather odd, too, for I heard they found a bottle of whisky inside her
  wardrobe. She said, too, that the doctor was poisoning his wife."</p>

  <p>"I wish he would. But he won't. Anything else?"</p>

  <p>"You <i>are</i> interested," laughed Joan. "Let me think. Yes, this really
  will amuse you. She declared that Miss Asprey was a monster of cruelty and
  that she ill-treated her poor little companion."</p>

  <p>"Aha. Suppose we investigate."</p>

  <p>Ignatius halted outside the delicately-wrought iron gates of 'The Spout',
  and looked through the bars at clumps of spectral lilies in the distance. The
  faint glug of water only was audible. Not a light glimmered through the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>"The stream flows right under the house," whispered Joan. "The scullery
  floor is always damp. Isn't it odd to think of it creeping through the
  darkness?"</p>

  <p>"To my mind, it's odder why the windows should be closed, on such a hot
  night," said Ignatius. "I can only think of one reason for it."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Someone doesn't want to be overheard. Sound travels far, at night."</p>

  <p>Even as he spoke, Joan gripped his wrist. He could barely see the white
  oval of her face as she stared fearfully at him, through the gloom.</p>

  <p>"Hush," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Come away," said Ignatius, pulling her across the green. He paused at the
  entrance to the Quakers' Walk. "I'll walk back with you to the Court," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"No." Joan shook her head. "I want to run. And run."</p>

  <p>"I understand. Good night. And don't dream."</p>

  <p>Ignatius turned to go, and then suddenly wheeled round.</p>

  <p>"Joan," he said, "I am going to say to you what I said to Miss Mack. If
  ever you should be in trouble, will you come to me? I may be able to
  help."</p>

  <p>The girl caught her lip with her teeth.</p>

  <p>"Why should you bracket me with Miss Mack?" she asked. "I'm sure I don't
  know. But there it is. Absurd. Good night."</p>

  <p>"No, wait. I want to ask you something."</p>

  <p>Joan looked around the empty twilight-smudged green, before she spoke.</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i> did you hear, just now?"</p>

  <p>"The same as you," replied Ignatius. "The voice of a woman&mdash;brutal
  and unfamiliar. And then a low whimper, as though another woman cried out in
  pain."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; ULTIMATUM</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Rector's sermon, the following Sunday, was memorable. It
  was not only an example of fine oratory, but was imprinted with sincerity.
  Ignatius, who listened in a spirit of detached criticism, could detect no
  note which did not ring true.</p>

  <p>The Rector spoke with such subdued intensity that it was clear he was
  taxing his self-control to the utmost. He pointed out that the recent tragedy
  was a crime in which some of those present had an indirect share. If not
  actually guilty, they were accessories after the fact, by their obstinate
  silence.</p>

  <p>The beautiful spirit of the village was being eaten away by hidden
  corruption, which could only be destroyed if everyone shared the
  responsibility. He had been shown the first letter by one whose
  self-sacrifice was stronger than her personal repugnance of publicity.
  Unfortunately, no one else was sufficiently unselfish and brave to follow
  this example. He asked now for so little&mdash;merely the envelope in which
  any letter had been enclosed.</p>

  <p>Ignatius sidled crabwise in his chancel pew, in order to study the bulk of
  the congregation which filled the nave. He noticed that their faces did not
  show their usual blank serenity, as though they were encased in protecting
  cellophane. But, while they were obviously grave and troubled, it appeared
  that each person was concerned with the responsibility of his neighbour.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that the volume of communal thought arising from the
  congregation was so compelling as to reach him, almost in the form of
  words.</p>

  <p>'Surely, after this, <i>someone</i> will do <i>something</i>.'</p>

  <p>The Rector had himself well in hand until the end of his sermon, when his
  pent-up fires suddenly burst through their thin crust in an eruption of
  molten heat. Unconscious of his congregation, unconscious of himself, he was
  carried away to say more than he had ever intended, when he had roughed out
  the skeleton outline of his sermon.</p>

  <p>He told them that, while they were to blame, he, himself, was equally
  guilty. He had failed them, because he had not been able to win their
  confidence. Although he loved the village&mdash;almost more than life
  itself&mdash;if he could not induce them to speak, he must leave them and go
  out into the wilderness.</p>

  <p>"The cup will be almost too bitter for me to drain," he said. "I am in
  your hands."</p>

  <p>Ignatius&mdash;swift as a ferret on the trail&mdash;studied the general
  reaction to the sermon. For the first time in his experience, the
  congregation forgot its well-bred passivity. It had been severely shocked,
  and it showed it.</p>

  <p>Little Mrs. Sheriff appeared on the point of tears. The Squire looked
  grimly Napoleonic, as though he were willing the congregation to a general
  confession. Miss Asprey's great grey eyes glowed with the flame of martyrdom,
  as befitted one who had already made her sacrifice.</p>

  <p>Ignatius had many other fleeting impressions before he remembered to
  observe a certain young lady in whom he was interested. He noticed that
  little Miss Mack smiled up at her employer, as though seeking guidance for
  her own emotions. But when he looked at Joan Brook he was too late to trap
  the message of her eyes. She sat, looking down at her clasped hands, with
  lowered lids.</p>

  <p>He remained in his pew after the rest of the congregation had filed out
  into the sunlit churchyard. Presently the choir joined them, and the
  organist&mdash;a girl from the village&mdash;finished putting away her music.
  She and the sexton were the last to leave the building.</p>

  <p>The Rector had remained in the vestry for some time; but there was no
  murmur of voices to tell Ignatius that any member of the parochial flock had
  lingered behind to confess. After glancing at his watch, he resolved to walk
  back to the Rectory alone.</p>

  <p>He was about to leave the shelter of the porch, when he heard the sound of
  footsteps on the paved path outside. Acting on impulse, he slipped back into
  the church, and hid behind a pillar.</p>

  <p>Someone entered the dim building and lingered in the doorway. It was Miss
  Asprey. She advanced a few paces down the aisle, her eyes still glowing and
  her lips sternly compressed.</p>

  <p>Ignatius thought that she was on her way to the vestry. Instead, she
  paused beside her pew and then entered it, to kneel in prayer.</p>

  <p>Engrossed in watching her, he did not hear the door being opened again;
  but the patter of footsteps caused him to turn so sharply that he almost
  collided with Miss Mack.</p>

  <p>She uttered a faint squeak, and then held out an ivory-covered Church
  Service, as though in explanation.</p>

  <p>"Is Miss Asprey inside?" she whispered. "I think she must have missed her
  prayer-book and gone back to find it. I carried it back, with my own."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Ignatius, "she is looking for it now...But I hoped that you
  were making this opportunity to see me alone."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," murmured Miss Mack.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you do. Don't you remember I once offered to help you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes. You were very kind. I don't know why. Please let me find Miss
  Asprey."</p>

  <p>Ignatius barred her way.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid to speak," he whispered. "She doesn't know you are here.
  Come outside."</p>

  <p>Miss Mack opened her lips dumbly and shut them again. At the same moment,
  Miss Asprey turned her head and saw them standing in the doorway. As she rose
  from her knees, her tall black figure looked grim and commanding in the dim
  light from the old stained-glass windows. She advanced in their direction so
  silently and swiftly, that her thin cloak blew out, like a cloud, about to
  envelop them.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mack." Her voice held reproof. "I did not expect you to follow me
  <i>here</i>."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said the little companion humbly. "I thought you were looking
  for your prayer-book."</p>

  <p>"I see. That was kind. Thank you." Miss Asprey turned to Ignatius. "I was
  going to see the Rector in the vestry," she told him "Will you ask him, from
  me, not to carry out his threat to leave us."</p>

  <p>"A <i>conditional</i> threat," Ignatius reminded her.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I cannot imagine how anyone could listen to such an appeal and not
  respond. Will you implore him not to punish the many for the sin of one?"</p>

  <p>"But don't you think you could tell him what is in your mind much better
  than I can? Miss Mack and I will wait for you here."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey shook her head and gave him her rare smile.</p>

  <p>"I can trust my message to <i>your</i> memory. And tell him also, not to
  punish himself for the sin of us all. I know what it would mean to him to
  leave the village. For I, too, love it. Come, Miss Mack."</p>

  <p>Ignatius watched the grotesque contrast of the two figures&mdash;one, tall
  and thin, the other short and broad, as they walked under the lime avenue to
  the churchyard gate. Then he pulled, a grimace as though in mockery, at their
  retreating backs, before he followed a path overgrown with ivy and grass,
  which led round to the vestry.</p>

  <p>The Rector was still inside&mdash;waiting. He looked up eagerly as the
  door opened to admit Ignatius. His face grew heavy with disappointment and
  his shoulders sagged again.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;<i>you?</i>"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I." Ignatius spoke briskly. "You've taken too much out of yourself.
  Still&mdash;a fine sermon. Let me congratulate you."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked the Rector. "It has met with no response."</p>

  <p>"Give it time. Besides, it has. Miss Asprey was coming to see you, but was
  frightened away."</p>

  <p>"Miss Asprey. But I don't want the sheep that is already saved. I want the
  sinner that repenteth...What was she coming for?"</p>

  <p>The Rector was slightly affected when Ignatius delivered Miss Asprey's
  message with the fidelity of a dictaphone.</p>

  <p>"By the way," remarked Ignatius, "you rather sprung your decision upon all
  of us. Is it a sudden one?"</p>

  <p>"So sudden that I did not know it myself when I mounted the steps of the
  pulpit. But&mdash;the words came...I must stand by them."</p>

  <p>"It might be a good forcing move," decided Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"No, no. You don't understand. A Power outside my own will compelled me to
  speak."</p>

  <p>The Rector was exalted still by his recent inspiration. But he was soon
  overtaken by reaction, and sunken in a trough of depression. The shadow of
  his renunciation hung heavy over him.</p>

  <p>He had been pained by the sequel to the Scudamore tragedy. A strange
  Coroner had held the inquest on them, and he had conducted it without that
  tact and discretion which had been a feature of the dead Coroner's enquiries
  at Miss Corner's inquest. Every fact regarding their private lives had been
  dragged into the daylight, and duly recorded in cold print.</p>

  <p>The Rector was also vaguely worried because the Scudamores' cat, Jeremy,
  refused to stay with him. Although it was absurd, he felt that he had broken
  faith with the dead lawyer.</p>

  <p>But the cat was troubled with no inhibitions, and knew exactly what it
  wanted. It had never settled in the Rectory, although the housekeeper had
  made valiant efforts to 'feed it in'. It spent the first few days in
  canvassing the district, always returning punctually for its meals. Then,
  having ascertained that the Clock House was permanently shut up, it took up
  its abode with a wealthy spinster.</p>

  <p>The Rectory had not proved to Jeremy's taste. He had another objection,
  besides the dog, and the irregularity of the time-table. He had come from a
  respectable house, and could not be sure that the Rector was married to the
  housekeeper.</p>

  <p>When the bell had ceased to clang for Children's Service, Ignatius, who
  was alone in the Rectory, pulled himself out of his old 'Varsity chair, and
  strolled on the green.</p>

  <p>The peace of the Day of Rest hung over the village. The children were
  inside the church&mdash;the parents rested after their heavy midday meal.
  Ignatius exchanged the blazing sunshine for the green shadows of a lane, dark
  and fragrant with lime-trees, and wandered past secluded gardens, until he
  reached a small gate, set in a clipped laurel-hedge.</p>

  <p>It was the side-entrance to 'The Spout'. He stood there, admiring the
  picturesque medley of vegetables, fruit-bushes and flowers when he heard the
  slide of high heels. Ada&mdash;the apple-bloom tints of her face deepened to
  damask-roses&mdash;was running down the path, perilously greened with moss.
  She wore the long flounced frock which showed that she was off-duty, and her
  best crinoline straw hat.</p>

  <p>When she saw Ignatius she forgot to dip in the regulation curtsy, which
  was her mark of respect to one of the Rector's household. Instead, she spoke
  to him in the independent manner which had marked their walk, when he was
  only a casual visitor, who was, presumably, interested in her beauty.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen her?"</p>

  <p>"Who?" asked Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mack."</p>

  <p>"No, I've met nobody."</p>

  <p>"Then she didn't come in this way. Blessed if I can make it out."</p>

  <p>"What's the mystery?" asked Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"Well," explained Ada, "everyone's out. I seen them all go, with my own
  eyes, the mistress and all. The mistress said no one need come back until
  time to get tea. But I forgot my gloves, and I came back...And I'm sure I
  heard footsteps moving about overhead."</p>

  <p>"Well, why didn't you go upstairs to investigate, instead of coming out
  into the garden?"</p>

  <p>Ada blushed.</p>

  <p>"I was scared, because they were such funny footsteps. They were creaky
  ones&mdash;not like anyone walking about...They say the house is haunted...So
  I just ran. Then, it came over me, all of a sudden, that perhaps Miss Mack
  had crept in, the back way. But if she had, you'd have seen her."</p>

  <p>"Why should it be Miss Mack?" asked Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"Because the steps seemed to come from her room."</p>

  <p>"But why should she creep?"</p>

  <p>Ada suddenly awoke from her trance of bewilderment, and her blue eyes
  became positively fierce.</p>

  <p>"Now you're asking," she cried. "I've got my suspicions. And I'm going to
  find out. I'll only say this. Things disappear, and they don't walk off
  alone."</p>

  <p>"May I come too?" asked Ignatius eagerly. "Just in case, it should be the
  ghost."</p>

  <p>Ada remembered her fear of the empty house, and nodded. She blazed out a
  discreet track through overgrown raspberry-canes and filbert-clumps, in order
  to keep out of sight of the windows. When they reached the cobbled pathway
  before the house, she opened a small door, which led to a lobby.</p>

  <p>"We'll listen at the top of the back-stairs," she said.</p>

  <p>Ignatius followed her up the narrow, twisty steps to a baize-covered door,
  which Ada cautiously pushed ajar. Before them stretched the length of a
  passage, lit by one small window at its end. Its bare, waxed oaken boards
  were uneven with age, and it was broken into different levels by an
  occasional step.</p>

  <p>"Hush," said Ada, holding up a warning finger.</p>

  <p>A dead, heavy silence invaded the whole house. But, as they strained their
  ears, faint sounds carne from one of the rooms, as of a creaking floor.
  Someone was inside, stealing about on a furtive quest.</p>

  <p>"It's old Mack," whispered Ada. "I've waked up at night, and thought I've
  heard someone snooping all round the house. Then I said 'Mice'. But I've lost
  my new pearls...You see? She's crept back, when everyone was out, to see what
  she could find lying about. But we'll cop her...<i>Look</i>."</p>

  <p>Ada pointed to an old oaken door, where the iron latch was being slowly
  raised, as though by an invisible hand.</p>

  <p>"Whose room?" asked Ignatius, as the latch remained stationary, at
  half-cock.</p>

  <p>"Mack's. She's hiding what she's took. But I'll tax her and make her turn
  out her drawers, before me...<i>Oh</i>."</p>

  <p>She gasped as the door silently opened and Miss Asprey appeared in the
  entrance. There was something so furtive in her crouching attitude, as she
  stood, listening, that Ignatius felt his pulse hammer with excitement.</p>

  <p>And then, suddenly, the silence of the old house was shattered by a hail
  of footsteps running up the central well-staircase. Ada had closed the door,
  so that they could see the passage no longer, but they heard Miss Mack's
  voice raised in a shrill scream, like a rabbit mad with terror of a
  stoat.</p>

  <p>"Get out of my room. You'll never find it. It's <i>mine</i>."</p>

  <p>Ada quickly crabbed down the stairs, followed by Ignatius. She did not
  speak as they hurried through the garden. When, however, they reached the
  gate, cut in the laurel-hedge, her voice was cool.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, sir. I'm going home now, to see my mother. I'm sorry to
  have troubled you about nothing."</p>

  <p>"<i>Nothing</i>, Ada?" repeated Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, sir." Ada's blue eyes were blank. "I'm going to be married soon,
  and Miss Asprey had promised to give me my wedding dress and all my
  linen."</p>

  <p>"I understand. You have a kind mistress."</p>

  <p>"A good, kind mistress, sir. If she's a bit rough on Miss Mack sometimes,
  it's no more than she deserves, setting herself up to be better than others,
  until she's got to be no use to no one."</p>

  <p>Ignatius raised his hat and made a sweeping bow.</p>

  <p>"I do homage to the Spirit of the Village. Ada, I admire you. You have
  seen nothing&mdash;heard nothing. Neither have I."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; THE STAMP</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Rector hardly slept that night, for his heart was heavy
  and his brain over-stimulated. Whenever he dozed, it was only to experience
  the horrors of nightmare, when he imagined he was in conflict with an
  invisible foe.</p>

  <p>He had grown to regard this dream as symbolic of his struggle with the
  anonymous letter-writer, although he knew it was but the reflection of his
  own thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Am I never going to lick&mdash;<i>You?</i>" he muttered, as he scraped
  the lather from a jaded face.</p>

  <p>When he walked down the shallow stairs, covered with worn Brussels, the
  hall was flooded with light streaming in through the open garden door.
  Charles was chasing a ball on the lawn. In the kitchen, the cook was boiling
  eggs to the gramophone record of "The sun has got his hat on."</p>

  <p>It was all typical of a homely and cheerful life which the Rector had
  grown to love. Still oppressed by the threat of leaving it, he found it
  difficult to summon up his usual smile when he met the postman at the front
  door.</p>

  <p>But it was good news that he carried into the dining-room, with his
  letters. Fate had rejected his sacrifice, and had regarded it as a
  'Gentleman's Offer', for immediate settlement.</p>

  <p>The Rector opened a bulky letter, addressed in a spidery handwriting, and
  drew out a printed envelope, which was folded inside.</p>

  <p>"I've got it," he shouted joyously, as he threw it across to Ignatius,
  while he read the covering letter.</p>

  <p>It was from a Mrs. Pomfret&mdash;an elderly lady of piety and pedigree.
  She explained that she had just received an anonymous letter, containing so
  foul and baseless an accusation that no Power on Earth could induce her to
  show it to anyone.</p>

  <p>'I feel degraded by being even a recipient of such filth,' she wrote. 'But
  I regard you as a Roman Catholic regards the Confessional. I received the
  letter late on Saturday night, and as we have no kitchen fire during the
  summer, I immediately locked it away, until I could conveniently burn it. The
  next morning, after I listened to your wonderful sermon, I had a hard battle
  with my conscience, and, I am thankful to say, it prevailed. I could never
  forgive myself if our dear Rector had been driven from us by my silence. But
  no one will ever know the cost to my own feelings.'</p>

  <p>The Rector looked up to see Ignatius holding the envelope in the jet of
  steam from the spirit kettle.</p>

  <p>"I want to have a look at the stamp," he explained. "It's a long shot, but
  it may be <i>marked</i>."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't disturb any child at its play," remarked the Rector. "I only
  want to impress on you the need for absolute secrecy over this letter. Mrs.
  Pomfret has made a real sacrifice, and I would rather cut off my right hand
  than cause her pain."</p>

  <p>"I don't mind your first insult, but I resent your second," snapped
  Ignatius, as he peeled off the stamp, and pressed it against the
  window-pane.</p>

  <p>Then he gave a thin high cry.</p>

  <p>"It is marked. Can't you see a pin-prick of light in one corner?"</p>

  <p>"But I understood none of the marked stamps were sold," said the
  Rector.</p>

  <p>"One book was sold, to Lady d'Arcy. She was No. 3 on our list. And this
  stamp is pricked in No. 3 position."</p>

  <p>The Rector pressed his eyes in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"But surely you don't accuse <i>Lady d'Arcy</i> of writing an abominable
  letter to Mrs. Pomfret?"</p>

  <p>"I do not. She isn't capable of two consecutive thoughts."</p>

  <p>"Then who do you suspect?"</p>

  <p>As Ignatius remained silent, the Rector stared at him, and then averted
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;Joan Brook?" he asked dully.</p>

  <p>"It can be no one else," agreed Ignatius, sitting down again, and
  beginning to butter toast. "She's not the sort of secretary who spends her
  spare time up in her own room, scribbling letters. No, our Joan is a
  rambler-rose. She wanders here, there, and everywhere. So she's not likely to
  buy stamps for her own use. She's the kind who would nip one, when wanted,
  from Lady d'Arcy's book."</p>

  <p>The Rector began to pace the room.</p>

  <p>"Surely," he said distractedly, "you cannot think that Joan has been
  writing these letters? It's unthinkable that she hounded the Scudamores to
  their death. She couldn't."</p>

  <p>"She could. But I don't say she has. Sit down and finish your
  breakfast."</p>

  <p>The Rector sat down and mechanically crammed his pipe, while Ignatius went
  on talking.</p>

  <p>"I have to consider possibilities. Miss Brook is one. She is a girl of
  strong character, with unusual determination and a love of excitement. Depend
  on it, she knows her own attraction, and thinks she's entitled to a better
  deal from Life than she's got. So she may break out, like this, in a general
  attack on fortunate people, who have what's been denied to her. The very
  danger of it would appeal to her, for she's no coward."</p>

  <p>He looked at the Rector in a meaning manner as he added, "Remember, she's
  leading an unnatural life."</p>

  <p>"She's not," declared the Rector indignantly. "She is self-supporting and
  has an excellent post. There are hundreds of girls in the same position who
  are leading useful, happy lives."</p>

  <p>"True. But Miss Brook has just that tincture of the unknown quantity which
  differentiates her from the herd. She is wasting her life dry-nursing a woman
  with mental palsy...She ought to be married."</p>

  <p>Glancing sideways, like a malicious elf, he grinned at the Rector.</p>

  <p>"Lucky man," he said. "You won't have to leave the village now."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed the Rector. "But&mdash;after this&mdash;it doesn't matter
  much...You told me you wanted a specimen of printing. You've got it...Where
  do we stand now?"</p>

  <p>"We don't stand. We balance. I must have positive proof before I make any
  charge. This stamp might have been given to some other person, who chanced to
  borrow one. I should like to get another envelope, for purposes of
  comparison."</p>

  <p>The Rector drew a deep breath at the reprieve.</p>

  <p>"Meantime, you leave Joan under a cloud," he said.</p>

  <p>"No, she is assumed innocent, until she is proved guilty. You've had so
  quick a response to your appeal, that we may expect some more luck. Mrs.
  Pomfret can't possess the only sensitive conscience."</p>

  <p>The Rector continued to frown.</p>

  <p>"I can't leave things like this," he declared. "The suspense is torture. I
  <i>must</i> tackle Joan about it. I know I can believe her."</p>

  <p>"No, you must leave that part to me," commanded Ignatius. "You'd only
  wreck the whole thing. Remember, you're under a pledge of secrecy to Mrs.
  Pomfret...How can we get hold of Miss Brook in a natural way?"</p>

  <p>"We might call on Lady d'Arcy this afternoon," suggested the Rector. "I'll
  talk to her and give you your chance to sound Joan. I shall have to trust
  you. Don't frighten her. Give her every loophole to clear herself, and don't
  judge by the surface."</p>

  <p>Ignatius merely smiled in an acid manner. He drove the Rector, and his
  inevitable dog, over to the Court, that afternoon, when his car covered the
  distance so quickly that Charles&mdash;who expected an outing&mdash;was
  plainly disgusted at this misuse of his property.</p>

  <p>It was a still hot day, when the trees in the park hung motionless, in
  dark-green umbrellas of shade, and clouds of gnats danced in the sunshine,
  like quivering sheets of bronze gauze.</p>

  <p>When they reached the pillared portico of the vast biscuit Georgian
  erection, they were disappointed to see another car waiting on the drive.
  Blind to the workings of Destiny, they could not tell that Lady d'Arcy's
  visitors were to be instrumental in clearing up their mystery.</p>

  <p>These turned out to be the Misses Martin, of the Towers; and both the
  Rector and Ignatius heard them before they actually entered the drawing-room.
  Lady d'Arcy, looking utterly lost, was being battered by the barrage of
  conversation; while Joan&mdash;cool and attractively sunburnt in
  white&mdash;did her best to reassemble her, and to shield her from direct
  hits.</p>

  <p>Even after the interruption of the two men's arrival, Miss Martin held the
  general attention, by sheer determination and powerful lungs. She and her
  sister were exactly what Ignatius had expected from Mrs. Scudamore's
  description of 'unaffected', as applied to wealth; for both were good natured
  and frank to rudeness.</p>

  <p>They talked exclusively of their travels, or rather, of a special topic
  incidental to their travels.</p>

  <p>"The Arabs are terrible thieves. They stick up the price of everything.
  Cairo's quite played-out. It's lousy with tourists, and there's not even the
  smell of a bargain. But the Chinese are a shade more honest. We got some
  gorgeous shawls dirt-cheap in Canton, didn't we, Con?...Italy, now that's a
  beautiful country. Real blue sky, not like this. We nearly bought up one
  village shop. They didn't know the value of their goods. But there's nothing
  in Rome&mdash;except the sights."</p>

  <p>Constance Martin agreed with everything her sister said, and added some
  specialised information on the subject of securing a bargain.</p>

  <p>"We want to see the gardens," declared Miss Martin, "and then we must push
  off. We're doing all our return-calls in one day, so as to get them
  over."</p>

  <p>"Yes, we've just come from 'The Spout,'" said Constance. "The old lady
  looks as if she was cracking at last."</p>

  <p>Everyone looked slightly startled at this description of the immortal
  Saint Asprey. Then Joan intercepted a glance which flashed between Ignatius
  and the Rector. As the men rose to go, she asked a question.</p>

  <p>"Oh, padre, how are my Altar flowers standing the heat?"</p>

  <p>"Dropping all over the place," answered Ignatius quickly.</p>

  <p>"I was rather doubtful of that white campanula. I'll bring down some fresh
  flowers this evening."</p>

  <p>"A wasted afternoon," complained the Rector as they drove back through the
  park.</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure," said Ignatius. "I am interested in Miss Brook's
  personality. Exactly how astute is she? Was that a clever move of hers to
  secure sanctuary?"</p>

  <p>"How could she tell we were going to ask her anything?"</p>

  <p>"She'd only to look at you, to know something was on your mind. And she's
  familiar with your special obsession. She's cleverer than you. The question
  is&mdash;Is she cleverer than I?"</p>

  <p>Ignatius stood, as sentry, at the Rectory gate that evening, when he
  reported Joan's arrival at the church, to the Rector. A few minutes later,
  the two men entered the ancient building, through the West door. Directly she
  saw them, Joan left her station on the Altar-steps and went to meet them.</p>

  <p>"I've tidied up," she said, nodding towards the vases. Then she turned
  directly to the Rector. "You're not really going, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Not now," he replied gravely.</p>

  <p>"Oh...Then someone sent you something? What is it? An anonymous letter, or
  only the envelope?"</p>

  <p>"The envelope...Do <i>you</i> know anything about it?"</p>

  <p>Joan shook her head, with a light laugh.</p>

  <p>"How should I? Who was this letter sent to?"</p>

  <p>"That I cannot say."</p>

  <p>"I see. You're to do all the asking, and I'm to do all the telling. Sorry.
  It doesn't appeal."</p>

  <p>Ignatius saw that the Rector was helpless before the mockery of her smile.
  When he intervened, his own eyes were inquisitorial, and his lips hard as
  twisted wire. They compelled Joan to be serious, and she looked at the
  ruthless face. "Miss Brook"&mdash;his voice cut like a whip&mdash;"the letter
  has been traced to you."</p>

  <p>"To me?" Joan's voice was light, but she was plainly on guard. "How is
  that possible?"</p>

  <p>"By the stamp."</p>

  <p>"Still, I don't understand? Did it tell you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was marked."</p>

  <p>"That's interesting, because I haven't bought any stamps since I've come
  here. I <i>never</i> write letters."</p>

  <p>"Then how do you communicate with your family and your friends?"</p>

  <p>"I ring them up and talk to them over the phone."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come, Miss Brook," said Ignatius impatiently. "Surely you cannot
  expect me to believe that you never write even a note?"</p>

  <p>"If I do, it's only an occasional one. So I take one of Lady d'Arcy's
  stamps. A secretary's perks, you know. Isn't there a proverb about not
  muzzling the ox that treads out the corn, or something?"</p>

  <p>As Joan made her fatal admission, Ignatius glanced at the Rector, and saw
  that the blow had been a heavy one. At that moment, he was almost sorry for
  the girl, because of the airy triumph with which she believed she had proved
  her innocence. He was about to question her further, when the Rector
  intervened.</p>

  <p>"That's enough. You're not the Counsel for the Prosecution."</p>

  <p>His voice softened as he turned to Joan.</p>

  <p>"Joan, I wonder if you'd be very angry if I asked you a question. Whatever
  your answer is, I shall believe you. And the matter will be closed for
  ever."</p>

  <p>Joan opened her lips impulsively, and then hesitated. Ignatius guessed at
  the swift chase of her thoughts as she first pressed her finger against her
  teeth, and then glanced at her watch.</p>

  <p>"I'll answer anything, of course," she declared, "as long as it's not my
  real age. But you'll have to cut it short for I'm due back at the Court, to
  make up a four at Bridge, after dinner. So I've got to hurry. If you'll come
  outside with me, while I throw these in the stoke-hole, it will save
  time."</p>

  <p>As the Rector picked up her empty basket, she snatched up the bundle of
  dead flowers and ran from the church, towards the furnace-house. Ignatius
  followed her, with an offer to help; but she almost thrust him aside, as she
  mounted the tiny flight of steps and faced the Rector.</p>

  <p>"What is your question?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He looked closely into her clear eyes.</p>

  <p>"Have you written an anonymous letter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She looked back at him with a steady, unfaltering gaze. "No," she replied.
  "Never."</p>

  <p>"Thank you." The Rector caught his breath. "Will you forgive me?"</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to forgive. Don't be sorry about nothing. My basket.
  Thanks. Good-bye, padre. I'm glad you're not going."</p>

  <p>She took not the slightest notice of Ignatius, who was regarding her with
  a twisted grin.</p>

  <p>"I admire that girl," he said, after she had swung out of the churchyard.
  "I've never heard a more convincing lie."</p>

  <p>"<i>Lie</i>?" repeated the Rector.</p>

  <p>"Of course it was. Didn't you notice a significant fact? Directly she
  realised she was for it, she wouldn't let you ask that question inside the
  church? Some spiritual repulsion, or superstitious fear of being struck dead
  for perjury."</p>

  <p>"I won't listen to such a slander," declared the Rector hotly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right. But she invented that excuse about the stokehole. There's
  not been a fire there for a long time, and it's not been used as a receptacle
  for rubbish."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence, as the truth bit home to the Rector.</p>

  <p>"What am I to do?" he asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. After that lie I reserve judgment on Miss Brook. I want more
  evidence to hang her&mdash;<i>another</i> specimen of printing from the
  anonymous one."</p>

  <p>The sudden lightening of the big man's face showed how much he hung on the
  words of his puny friend.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe her?" asked Ignatius. "Or is the dream ended?"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. I believe <i>in</i> her."</p>

  <p>The Rector scarcely spoke during dinner. Half-way through the meal, he
  suddenly leaped to his feet, and put down his plate on the carpet.</p>

  <p>"Charles," he called, "dinner. Ignatius, may I borrow your car?"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; COMPANY</h2>

  <p class="first">IGNATIUS did not see the Rector again until the next
  morning, when he appeared at breakfast still sodden with sleep.</p>

  <p>"When did you get home?" asked Ignatius curiously.</p>

  <p>"Very late," was the reply. "Thanks for the car. I went night-riding."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were going to the Court?"</p>

  <p>"I did."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;am I to congratulate you?"</p>

  <p>The Rector glared at the question.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going rather too far?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Probably. I don't ask for confidence&mdash;only
  marmalade...Thanks...Please yourself."</p>

  <p>The Rector smiled drearily.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he said, "you're being logical. I said I had faith in Joan,
  so it naturally followed that I had to prove it, in the only way.
  But&mdash;it's deadlock."</p>

  <p>Ignatius was not often surprised, but the Rector had secured his interest.
  As he considered Joan's longing for security, and her strong feeling for the
  Rector, he could not credit the news that she had refused his offer of
  marriage.</p>

  <p>"These wretched letters are stopping the way," declared the Rector. "I
  don't wish to discuss my private affairs, even with you, but one thing hangs
  on another. I asked Joan to marry me, last night, and I thought she was going
  to accept me. And then, quite suddenly, she changed her mind."</p>

  <p>"How?" asked Ignatius eagerly.</p>

  <p>"She said that, until it was discovered who was writing the letters,
  everyone in the village was under a cloud, and that she, apparently, was
  under special suspicion. It was no use my swearing I believed in her
  innocence&mdash;it had to be proved. She said that, after we were married, if
  anything went wrong I might remember, and doubt her."</p>

  <p>Ignatius' peaked face was kindled to enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i> a girl," he declared. "She means to have the whole of you,
  not a part. She's out to get you, hook, line, and sinker."</p>

  <p>"If she is, she shows it in a curious way."</p>

  <p>"No, Tigger, she's right. That black day is bound to come, when the devil
  would make you distrust her. Well, to reward her for her courage and
  acquisitive instinct, I suppose I must get this cleared up."</p>

  <p>"I confess I don't know where we are at all, now," said the Rector dully.
  "Ought we to call in the police, after all?"</p>

  <p>"You'd better consult the Squire. But I warn you it might prove dangerous.
  The police would know how to set a more effective trap than your little
  Postmistress."</p>

  <p>The old startled expression shot into the Rector's eyes at the mention of
  a snare.</p>

  <p>"Do come out into the open yourself," he urged. "<i>Whom</i> do you
  suspect?"</p>

  <p>"Two persons&mdash;and one of them is Miss Brook. I confess I incline to
  my second choice, from a point of psychological interest. But I'm still in
  need of a second specimen of printing, in order to prove my theory."</p>

  <p>The Rector's heart was very heavy when he walked through his loved
  village. It was a crystal day, when he seemed to be gazing through water at
  the sharp green outlines of the distant Downs. The cottage gardens were
  crammed with flowers. Summer was holding out her hands to touch Autumn's
  fingertips, so that both Seasons contributed their offerings. Dahlias,
  sunflowers, hollyhocks and phlox grew beside pansies, pinks, marigolds and
  snapdragons.</p>

  <p>In his mood of depression all this profusion of beauty made the contrast
  of the reality more poignant. In the old days, even Death respected the
  village's leisurely procedure, for he never paid a professional visit without
  the preliminary of warning taps on each door.</p>

  <p>But, within three months, three prominent lives had been ruthlessly cut
  short. Who would be next to go?</p>

  <p>As the thought flashed through the Rector's mind, a familiar figure, who
  was standing by the War Memorial, crossed the sun-speckled Green, and began
  to walk by his side.</p>

  <p>The Rector accepted his company, as a matter-of-course, and with none of
  the shrinking horror with which he first glimpsed a black shape, which hid in
  corners, and stalked footsteps.</p>

  <p>Although he did not know that he walked with Fear, the current of his
  thoughts was directed into dark channels. He thought of the three new graves
  in the churchyard, and wondered when there would be another.</p>

  <p>Underneath its beauty, the village was soaked with intrigue.</p>

  <p>A secret chain of letters was passing from door to door, yet he had been
  able to see only an occasional broken link. Everyone was in the conspiracy,
  either as active agents or passive pawns.</p>

  <p>The place itself had changed. Lawns were shaven and flower-borders
  prolific; but there was no bi-weekly garden-party, while tennis-racquets and
  croquet-mallets were used only in family games.</p>

  <p>Who was responsible for it? Even as he asked the question, Fear whispered
  several selected names into his ear.</p>

  <p>Vivian Sheriff hooted him out of her way, as she drove Major Blair back
  with her, to the Hall. The Rector broadened his smile of greeting, in order
  to make it include congratulations, and was chilled by her perfunctory
  response.</p>

  <p>The girl had none of the radiance he had expected to see in a future
  bride. She wore a white knitted cap, and her flower-face&mdash;unshaded by
  the customary brim&mdash;looked smaller, as though shrunken by worry.</p>

  <p>'Remorse?' he wondered. 'Is it <i>you?</i>'</p>

  <p>The doctor had declared the writer to be a pathological case, and Fear
  reminded him that all the ingredients for such a condition could be found at
  the Hall. The Squire dominated both his wife and his daughter, so that either
  might be driven to find some crooked vent for self-expression.</p>

  <p>Then Fear switched off to another more interesting theory.</p>

  <p>After all, the Squire was an honest John Bull, with all the national
  virtues, while the Hall was typical of English family life. It was likelier
  that the Sheriffs' happiness and prosperity had roused the envy of one who
  was not so fortunately-placed. One whose personal attractions entitled her to
  expect a better deal from Life.</p>

  <p>Since her engagement, Vivian would be doubly an object of jealousy. If,
  instead of being a suspect, she were another victim, her dimmed radiance
  would be explained.</p>

  <p>'But I believe in Joan,' declared the Rector. 'Besides, why should she
  envy Vivian when she refused to wear my ring?'</p>

  <p>Fear explained exactly why she had made her gesture. It was a bold move to
  avert suspicion. For she was in a tight corner. The stamp had been traced to
  her, and she had told a deliberate lie.</p>

  <p>That had not been explained away. Probably it was part of Ignatius' policy
  to let her think she was safe, so that she might be lured on to further
  indiscretion. Another false step might plunge her in the morass.</p>

  <p>He could not trust Ignatius. After all, he only knew him as a little
  eccentric, whose wealth had made him a useful friend in their College days.
  What did one man know of an-other's heart? It was conceivable that he was
  spiteful and bored by a thwarted existence.</p>

  <p>Fear filled the Rector with the impulse to strike blindly at friend and
  foe. He could not distinguish between them in this blindfold nightmare. He
  was utterly baffled and lost.</p>

  <p>If he invited the Squire to call in the police, he would set in motion a
  machine that operated with relentless precision. Should Joan get in its way,
  she would be caught up and effectively dealt with. It was hopeless to
  expostulate with metal, or to appeal for mercy to a Robot.</p>

  <p>In spite of the sun, the Rector grew cold. He shivered, when Fear poked
  him in the ribs with a chill finger-tip, just to show the world they were on
  familiar terms.</p>

  <p>'If I do nothing,' thought the Rector, 'the Enemy will soon strike again.
  Another tragedy. Another grave.'</p>

  <p>He stopped before a Tudor cottage, as Miss Asprey walked grandly down its
  garden-path. Before he could introduce his interesting Companion,
  Fear&mdash;after a glance of recognition at Miss Asprey&mdash;espied a dark
  lady on the green, and hastened off, to act as cavalier to Marianne
  Perry.</p>

  <p>The Rector looked at the worn, ivory features of Miss Asprey, with a sense
  of sudden release from oppression.</p>

  <p>"Have you been visiting Harper?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Miss Asprey. "Dr. Perry is with him now, so I left. We met
  over his bed, and had our usual argument. A charming man, but, like most
  doctors, a materialist. He will not admit the importance of the spiritual
  issue in physical illness."</p>

  <p>"I suppose that would depend on what's the matter," said the Rector.</p>

  <p>"That is my own point of view. Of course, I have explained the principles
  of diet and ventilation to Mrs. Harper, and I insist that she carries out my
  instructions. But Harper's spirit is sick, and he needs healing by
  prayer."</p>

  <p>The Rector could not disagree, for his wide experience had introduced him
  to cases of special sickness which had not responded to drugs.</p>

  <p>"There's no one who can give him spiritual treatment better than you," he
  said. "You always make me feel refreshed."</p>

  <p>"Do I?" Miss Asprey did not smile. "Lately, I've wondered if my powers are
  beginning to dim. My will does not dominate in the old way."</p>

  <p>"You can always dominate me," said the Rector.</p>

  <p>He was rewarded by the radiance of her face. With a stately inclination of
  her graceful neck, she left him before Dr. Perry could reach the gate.</p>

  <p>"Confound that saintly woman," he remarked, lightly. "She's won another
  round. The Harpers have been pouring my medicine down the sink."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with Harper?" asked the Rector.</p>

  <p>"Aha, padre, now you're trespassing on my preserves. I'll only say he is
  in good company, for his complaint is the same as the Squire's. I give it
  different names, just to mark the difference in their bills."</p>

  <p>"How is the Squire getting on?" he asked unthinkingly.</p>

  <p>"How should I know? He's not my patient."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Perry, I forgot. But he's not looking in good shape. He's missing
  you."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, his own doctor probably knows more about the treatment
  of his complaint than I do. What he doesn't know is how to humour him."</p>

  <p>In spite of the breach between them, the Rector felt the old tug of
  attraction. The doctor's composure was soothing and static. He was under
  vague suspicion of having ingratiated himself with a woman patient in order
  to get her money, and was generally suspected of carelessness in his
  administration of a sleeping-drug. The results had been excellent for him,
  and, in view of his increase of inherited income, the village felt slightly
  apprehensive of his professional services.</p>

  <p>Yet, when they met him personally, the old loyalties persisted.
  Impulsively, the Rector held out the olive-branch.</p>

  <p>"Why do you never come over in the evenings?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear padre," replied the doctor, "you have your private detective. I
  might interrupt delicate operations."</p>

  <p>The Rector had a fleeting memory of the episode of the marked stamps.
  Apparently, he had not been quick enough in his efforts to hide them.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you mean Ignatius Brown," he said. "But he likes you."</p>

  <p>"Thanks for the hint. <i>Now</i>, I'll be on my guard."</p>

  <p>"Well, even if you won't come over, it's good to have a chat again," said
  the Rector. "I wish you'd tell me if you think Miss Asprey is losing her
  grip."</p>

  <p>"Not she." The doctor shrugged. "She will live for ever."</p>

  <p>"Good. How are things with you, doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Excellent, thanks. Family flourishing&mdash;and nothing could be
  better."</p>

  <p>"Then <i>you're</i> lucky...Do you remember warning me that there were
  dark places, even here? I didn't believe you. But since then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As his voice broke, the doctor finished his sentence.</p>

  <p>"Since then, things have been rather interesting. By the way, what does
  Miss Brook think of Vivian's engagement? Personally, I'm rather amused by it.
  She looks so pensive, now she's reached the peak of her ambition."</p>

  <p>"You don't like her, do you?" ventured the Rector.</p>

  <p>"It's common history I once liked her rather too well. So I may be in the
  second stage of friendship. But I must be getting along. Good-bye,
  padre."</p>

  <p>The doctor walked home slowly. As he passed the blank windows of the Clock
  House he looked up at them with a speculative expression.</p>

  <p>'I wonder if their way out has been the anticipated success,' he
  reflected. 'Annihilation should be restful. Well, they, at least, have solved
  their problem.'</p>

  <p>He pushed open the gate, and then recoiled slightly, as his wife flew to
  meet him. He had learned, from painful experience, to associate these
  tempestuous rushes of welcome with fresh demands.</p>

  <p>His first glance showed him that Marianne was in a state of agitation, as
  the result of ten minutes spent in the company of a dark Stranger. Fear had
  been in a sociable mood that day, for he had insisted in accompanying the
  lady home, in order to see her charming and beautiful children. And he had
  made the most of his opportunity.</p>

  <p>Marianne had pounced down on the elder baby, and discovered that he was
  suffering from septic blood-poisoning. At least, that was what the superior
  nurse had hinted, as she stressed, once more, the advantages of a visit to
  the seaside.</p>

  <p>What had really happened was that Mickey had been stung by an insect, who,
  in harmony with the prevailing tone of the village&mdash;chose to remain
  anonymous. He knew he was only a humble bug, and that his bite could do no
  mischief.</p>

  <p>But Mickey was of an industrious nature, and had lost no time in getting
  to work. He had a pale, sensitive skin, which responded immediately to
  vigorous rubbing, so that he got excellent results. His mother became almost
  hysterical at the sight of the patch of inflammation.</p>

  <p>"He's been stung by a mosquito," declared the nurse. "A naughty fly stung
  you, didn't it, darling?"</p>

  <p>"No," corrected Mickey. "Rat."</p>

  <p>He had just learned the word, and was practising it. Marianne screamed,
  and then caught side of her husband, opening the gate.</p>

  <p>"Horatio," she screamed. "Come to Mickey, <i>at once</i>."</p>

  <p>In his usual leisurely manner, Dr. Perry examined the child's arm, and
  then carried him, in silence, into the surgery.</p>

  <p>"Get me two large surgical bandages," he said gravely to his wife.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you're not going to operate," she asked faintly.</p>

  <p>"You will see what I'm going to do to save life."</p>

  <p>Smiling faintly, the doctor applied witch-hazel to Mickey's arm, before he
  bandaged both his hands, to the baby's delight.</p>

  <p>"Keep those on, until the irritation is gone," he said. "It will soon die
  down, now that he is unable to scratch...And Nurse, you might see that his
  nails are kept shorter. I don't propose to make a mandarin of my son."</p>

  <p>When the shocked woman had carried Mickey away, Marianne turned on her
  husband.</p>

  <p>"Why did you speak to her like that? It was positively an insult."</p>

  <p>"It was&mdash;but will she recognise it? Can you give me any hope?"</p>

  <p>His words were the signal for the storm to break, as Marianne overwhelmed
  him with reproaches and abuse. The doctor made no attempt to listen or to
  argue, he was only conscious of irritation and noise.</p>

  <p>In the same detached spirit, he looked at her, and was aware
  that&mdash;devoid of her exotic allure and poise&mdash;she was merely a
  gesticulating skinny woman, with outstretched hollow palms.</p>

  <p>He was fond of his children, and very fond of his wife; but peace was
  essential to his happiness. He could have found entire satisfaction with a
  milk-veined wife like Vivian, or accepted second-best, in a well-ordered
  celibate existence.</p>

  <p>"You've no right to be a father," stormed Marianne.</p>

  <p>By his silence the doctor seemed to agree with her. In reality, he was
  seeing a jovial red face, and beaming eyes under a shock of iron-grey hair.
  His whole heart was wrung with longing for his friend, Julia Corner.</p>

  <p>She would have helped him through this crisis, not only with her
  cheque-book&mdash;for she turned borrowing into just another link of
  friendship&mdash;but with her good-nature and understanding, and the stimulus
  of her excellent brain, of which, he&mdash;alone&mdash;had knowledge.</p>

  <p>But Julia was in her grave. Lucky woman.</p>

  <p>As he thought wistfully of the blessed blank of annihilation, a chance
  remark recalled him back to the surgery, with the shower of sunlight falling
  through its glass roof.</p>

  <p>"Horatio," said Marianne vehemently, "do answer. Let me borrow the money
  for a seaside holiday for my babies, from Mrs. Sheriff. She's so kind, she'll
  lend it, when she knows the circumstances."</p>

  <p>The doctor's eyes glittered in his pale face and his low voice suddenly
  vibrated with passion.</p>

  <p>"Marianne," he said, "I <i>forbid</i> you to talk about my private affairs
  to anyone in the village."</p>

  <p>"But you borrowed from Mr. Scudamore."</p>

  <p>"Strongly against my own wish. But he was my solicitor, and a very old
  friend. Besides, I was only forestalling my legacy...But I will not tolerate
  my financial troubles being made public property. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I understand that you'd sacrifice your children to your ridiculous
  pride. And I'll promise nothing. I don't care if you leave me and go to your
  <i>other</i> woman."</p>

  <p>She spoke in mockery, and was utterly confounded when he repeated her
  words.</p>

  <p>"My 'other' woman. Be careful. I may take you at your word."</p>

  <p>Marianne tried to laugh, but was startled by the fixity of her husband's
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Horatio," she implored, "don't look like that. You frighten me. I won't
  say one word, I promise you...You almost make me believe&mdash;. Kiss me,
  darling. Tell me there's no one else."</p>

  <p>Her arms were around his neck, almost strangling him with their pressure;
  but he did not see the lips he kissed.</p>

  <p>His view of them was blocked by a raw grave.</p>

  <p>"<i>If</i> there is another woman," he said, "remember this: Should you
  drive me to her bed I shall never leave it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch29"
     id="ch29"></a>XXIX. &mdash; THE PHILANTHROPIST</h2>

  <p class="first">AS the days passed without further proof of confidence from
  his parishioners, the Rector's unhappiness grew acute. It seemed to him that
  everyone in the village was either leaving the sacrifice to his neighbour, or
  preferred to lose the Rector sooner than violate his essential reserve.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to be done, but wait, and cheer himself with the
  reflection that Ignatius was mistaken in his theory of a wholesale broadcast
  of anonymous letters.</p>

  <p>Ignatius also chafed at the check. One morning he startled the Rector with
  a new idea.</p>

  <p>"Has Miss Mack ever travelled?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" replied the Rector.</p>

  <p>"Do you think she would like a short Continental holiday?"</p>

  <p>"I should imagine so."</p>

  <p>"Then, suppose we invite her to take one? I'm in the mood for
  philanthropy."</p>

  <p>The Rector looked at his friend's bleak face, but saw only the birth of
  malice in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"What are you driving at now?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I merely wish to find out if I'm still on the right track. So
  far, I have only my theory, but everything is beginning to dovetail so neatly
  that it needs but one specimen of printing for me to lay down my hand.
  Meantime, I cannot be too certain of my thesis."</p>

  <p>He broke off, to glance through the window, between the sweeping boughs of
  the cedar trees which shaded the lawn. Outside the gate was a small car,
  which its owner was on the point of leaving.</p>

  <p>"It's that Martin girl," groaned Ignatius. "She met me yesterday, and took
  an interest in my car. Refuse all invitations for me."</p>

  <p>The Rector grinned, for he knew that the Miss Martins would regard a
  wealthy bachelor as natural quarry. He stepped through the French window and
  met Constance Martin on the drive.</p>

  <p>"I want you and your friend to come to lunch today," she shouted.</p>

  <p>The Rector did his best in the matter, but, as he refused to tell lies on
  behalf of his Ignatius, he ended by promising to come.</p>

  <p>The bitter little man came out of his ambush, when he returned to the
  dining-room, and was furious to hear of the arrangement.</p>

  <p>"At least, I shall have an interesting memory to sustain me during the
  ordeal," he said. "I expect some entertainment at 'The Spout'."</p>

  <p>"What will this freak of philanthropy cost you?" asked the Rector.</p>

  <p>"About fifty pounds, I suppose. But I do not anticipate being called on to
  pay. Miss Mack will refuse my offer."</p>

  <p>"Don't be too sure."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think Miss Asprey will prevent her from going?"</p>

  <p>"I'm certain she will do nothing of the kind."</p>

  <p>When the two men reached the front door of 'The Spout', the Rector looked
  at Ignatius, before he knocked.</p>

  <p>"Am I to ask for Miss Mack?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"No, Miss Asprey. Miss Mack will be with her."</p>

  <p>He proved a true prophet, for when Rose showed them into the study the
  ladies were together. Miss Asprey stood at the window, while Miss Mack sat at
  the desk, dutifully opening envelopes.</p>

  <p>"Shall I go?" she asked in an undertone, humbly eager to efface
  herself.</p>

  <p>"No," commanded Miss Asprey, "please stay. I shall want you later."</p>

  <p>She welcomed the Rector with her gracious smile, which, to Ignatius,
  appeared forced. Even the Rector thought there was an element of gloom about
  the dim ancient room, for the casement window was unusually small and looked
  onto a sunless lawn, where the brook&mdash;brown and turgid&mdash;flowed
  between stone copings.</p>

  <p>He dutifully talked to Miss Asprey about the usual things, in order to
  pave the way to his friend's offer. While he did so, he was conscious of the
  soothing atmosphere which seemed to radiate from Miss Asprey. His worries
  were insensibly dulled and his brain ceased its restless spin.</p>

  <p>Ignatius broke the peace with an abrupt question.</p>

  <p>"Have you travelled much, Miss Asprey?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him in faint surprise.</p>

  <p>"In my youth," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Have <i>you</i>, Miss Mack?"</p>

  <p>In her turn, Miss Mack stared at him with round china-blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"No," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes."</p>

  <p>"Good. Then you have your chance to do a good turn to some friends of
  mine. That is, if Miss Asprey sanctions the scheme."</p>

  <p>Ignatius went on to embellish his lie with the natural gusto which
  accompanies such flights of fancy.</p>

  <p>"These are the facts. These friends&mdash;four ladies&mdash;have planned a
  short holiday to Switzerland and&mdash;the Italian Lakes. Unfortunately, one
  of their number has been obliged to fall out, at the last moment, and three
  is an awkward number. So they have appealed to me to fill the gap."</p>

  <p>"Are you going?" asked Miss Mack. "How nice."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid my sex debars me from the pleasure. But, as the reservations
  are made and paid for, my friends have asked me to find them a congenial
  fourth. Someone who is well-bred, even-tempered, discreet, appreciative,
  tranquil&mdash;in fact&mdash;the perfect companion. Naturally, my thoughts
  flew to Miss Mack."</p>

  <p>Ignatius turned to Miss Asprey.</p>

  <p>"Could you spare her for a fortnight?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," replied Miss Asprey, without a second's pause. Ignatius
  looked at Miss Mack, who was smiling uncertainly. "Then will you come?" he
  asked. "May I write to my friends and tell them I have been successful?"</p>

  <p>The little woman's eyes were eager, but she hesitated as she glanced at
  Miss Asprey.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't quite know," she said.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it appeal to you? There will be no pecuniary obligation and you
  will place my friends under a debt of gratitude. By the way, they believe in
  comfort. No climbing or walking. They will motor, by easy stages, and stay at
  the best hotels. The food will be excellent."</p>

  <p>Miss Mack licked her pale pink lips with the tip of her tongue</p>

  <p>"It sounds very tempting," she said. "You're sure there will be nothing to
  pay?"</p>

  <p>"Not one penny."</p>

  <p>"You're all very kind to me. I think I would like to come."</p>

  <p>The Rector's heavy face beamed with pleasure, but he also seemed to find
  humour in the situation as he glanced at Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"When do your friends leave England?" asked Miss Asprey. "We must lose no
  time in getting Miss Mack's things ready."</p>

  <p>She appeared so genuinely pleased at the prospect of the holiday for her
  companion that Ignatius said 'Good-bye', not only to his fifty pounds, but to
  a similar amount; for he would be pledged to find someone to accompany Miss
  Mack.</p>

  <p>"About a fortnight hence," he replied. "I've forgotten the exact date, but
  I'll look up their letter directly I get back to the Rectory."</p>

  <p>"No, please don't trouble to do that," said Miss Mack. "I find I shall not
  be able to come, after all."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked Miss Asprey peremptorily.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to leave you, Miss Asprey."</p>

  <p>The Rector felt almost stunned with the shock of her refusal, especially
  as Ignatius shot him a glance of triumph. Miss Asprey's composed expression
  gave no clue to her real feelings, as she began to expostulate with her
  companion, in the quiet authoritative tones which are used to influence a
  child.</p>

  <p>"But, Miss Mack, this is an opportunity which must not be lost. I can do
  without you perfectly well. Indeed, it is my wish that you go."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Miss Asprey," murmured Miss Mack.</p>

  <p>"Don't you want to travel?" asked Ignatius.</p>

  <p>The eager glitter of the little woman's eyes answered his question.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied, "indeed I do. But my place is with dear Miss Asprey.
  I'm happiest here, doing my duty. I know what is best for me. And <i>no
  one</i> can make me change my mind."</p>

  <p>She got up from her desk and crossed to the door.</p>

  <p>"Will you please excuse me, Miss Asprey?" she asked, as she went out of
  the room.</p>

  <p>The Rector turned to Miss Asprey, who sat as still as a woman carved in
  stone.</p>

  <p>"What marvelous loyalty you inspire," he said impulsively.</p>

  <p>As Miss Asprey smiled faintly at the compliment, Ignatius spoke with a
  tinge of irony.</p>

  <p>"In that case, Miss Asprey should have a corresponding influence on one of
  Miss Mack's pliant disposition. Can I rely on you, to talk her round?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can promise to do nothing of the kind," was the cold reply.
  "Miss Mack is a free agent. I do not believe in coercion. You have heard she
  has my permission to go."</p>

  <p>As Ignatius made no comment, but continued to hold her with his eye, her
  expression changed from saintliness to faint arrogance. When she spoke, she
  conveyed the impression of accepting a challenge.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes a stranger will succeed, where a friend will fail. Suppose, Mr.
  Brown, <i>you</i> try the experiment of making a woman change her mind? I
  sincerely wish her to go...It might be wiser if you interviewed her alone. As
  I am her employer, she may be unconsciously influenced by my presence."</p>

  <p>Nothing could have been fairer than her offer. Yet each one knew
  instinctively the issue. No power on earth could shift Miss Mack from her
  allegiance to her employer.</p>

  <p>"You'll have a shot at it, won't you?" whispered the Rector, as the men
  walked down the drive.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'll play the game. But my cheque-book's saved." Ignatius chuckled
  gleefully as he slapped his pocket. "Have I made my point?"</p>

  <p>"What point?" asked the Rector defensively.</p>

  <p>"That a prisoner may cling to his cell after the door is open."</p>

  <p>The Rector made no comment. He was once again a victim to depression,
  while Ignatius was in high spirits. He even forgot to grumble as they drove
  to the Towers.</p>

  <p>"As my car is so obviously the attraction, and not myself," he remarked,
  "I suppose there will be a place laid for it at the luncheon-table."</p>

  <p>When they reached the huge house, bristling with turrets and flashing with
  glass, he disliked its crowded luxury and restless atmosphere. The Martin
  girls were too hearty, and confused him with their constant chatter. He
  endured the long, heavy meal, by reminding himself that there was a
  time-limit to his discomfort.</p>

  <p>When he was smoking a cigarette, after lunch, the moment of release was so
  near that he managed to be agreeable to Constance Martin, who had attached
  herself to him.</p>

  <p>"Are you quite settled in?" he asked benevolently.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Constance, "we're old inhabitants. I've even had one of the
  blinking anonymous letters, to make me feel at home."</p>

  <p>"Where is it?" asked Ignatius quickly.</p>

  <p>"Burned, of course. I don't keep that sort of muck lying round, for my
  maid to read."</p>

  <p>"Envelope, too?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I can tell you what was in it, if it amuses you. It was a lot of
  bilge about the wonderful bargains we'd got abroad, and it hinted that we'd
  got some better bargains which we did not talk about. I can't remember the
  exact words, but the letter practically accused us of shop-lifting."</p>

  <p>Ignatius bit his lip with disappointment, as he thought of another lost
  opportunity.</p>

  <p>"Damnable," he said, with such feeling that Constance mistook it for
  sympathy with herself.</p>

  <p>"Pretty foul," she agreed. "I opened the letter, but, after all, it might
  have been meant for anyone of us. It was addressed to 'Miss C. Martin', and
  we all have the same initial. My eldest sister is 'Cathleen', and the two
  youngsters that you haven't met, are 'Carol' and 'Cherry'."</p>

  <p>It was plain that Constance wanted him to have the freedom of her family,
  for she spoke of future introductions.</p>

  <p>"The others will be soon here, and we're going to dig in, for a bit. After
  all, we've been on the move for two years, so it's about time."</p>

  <p>Ignatius assured her of his anticipatory pleasure; but he was silent and
  snappy on their homeward journey. Only the dog was privileged to receive his
  confidence, as he sank into a chair and whispered in Charles' silky ear:</p>

  <p>"It's the one we both suspected. But we have to prove it to meaner
  intelligences."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch30"
     id="ch30"></a>XXX. &mdash; THE ENVELOPE</h2>

  <p class="first">A WEEK later, when Vivian Sheriff received her third
  anonymous letter, she took counsel with her familiar
  companion&mdash;Fear.</p>

  <p>He had attached himself to her, probably from an impulse of
  loyalty&mdash;since it was she who was responsible for his introduction to
  the village, where he had enjoyed such marvellous social success.</p>

  <p>The spirit of self-confident levity which had prevailed at Miss Corner's
  tea-party was akin to a new broom, chasing every shadow from the corners. It
  was only after Vivian had suddenly quailed at her memory of an old
  indiscretion&mdash;so that she tried to establish a pact of
  self-protection&mdash;that the black flicker had shot through the sunlit
  room.</p>

  <p>As Vivian sat at the breakfast-table, biting her lips over the letter,
  Mrs. Sheriff looked at her anxiously. She noticed that her daughter had lost
  some of her colour, and that there were violet shadows under her eyes.</p>

  <p>Although excitement might be responsible for her washed-out appearance,
  there was no doubt that Vivian had lost her spring. Her engagement
  represented the peak of her ambition, and yet she was unable to find pleasure
  in answering the crop of congratulatory letters which had poured in since the
  formal announcements to the Press.</p>

  <p>As a matter-of-fact, she was worried to death. Fear had become the
  mainspring of the daily round. She was not so much afraid for her own future,
  since her commonsense refused to submit to panic. But she was overwhelmed
  with a sense of responsibility.</p>

  <p>Although she was of somewhat shallow disposition, she was both
  conscientious and serious. Mrs. Scudamore's death had been a bad blow to her,
  for she had always preferred the company of older women, partly because of
  the lack of competition, and partly because her mind was less flexible than
  that of the average girl.</p>

  <p>The lawyer's wife had been her model and inspiration; and after the first
  shock of the exposure, she felt a sense of personal loss.</p>

  <p>Although she was then guiltless of keeping back important evidence, the
  arrival of the first letter had changed the position. She believed that
  she&mdash;alone&mdash;had a clue as to the writer. But while she would not
  hesitate to sun-bathe publicly, in the penultimate shred, she shrank from any
  advertisement of her private affairs.</p>

  <p>Fear sat beside her as she read the printed warning, and looked over her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"There may be someone else in the village who has received a letter,
  today," it hinted. "If you don't speak, someone else may turn on the
  gas."</p>

  <p>Give the devil his due&mdash;Fear worked to good purpose that day; for
  even while he achieved his own object of making Vivian's heart flutter and
  her lips pale, she suddenly sprang to her feet&mdash;her blue eyes glazed
  with desperate resolution.</p>

  <p>Her mother looked at her with rather a scared expression; Fear was
  wholesale in his attentions to ladies, and had spent some of his time in the
  company of Mrs. Sheriff. She could not forget those terrible inhibitions of
  which Miss Corner had hinted.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going, Vivian?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"To see the Rector, Mother."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't tell him too much."</p>

  <p>As Vivian stared at her in surprise, she attempted a confused
  explanation.</p>

  <p>"I thought, perhaps, you wanted some spiritual advice about marriage. I
  don't think that part of it should be neglected. And when you talk to a
  clergyman, you're led on to say more than you mean."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for the hint," smiled Vivian. "I'm only going to stagger him
  with my guilty Past."</p>

  <p>Leaving her mother reassured by her statement, Vivian drove her car under
  the flickering green shadow of the lane, until she reached the mouth of the
  chestnut tunnel, which she used as her parking-station. By means of this
  precaution, she took the Rector and Ignatius, by surprise, as they sat and
  smoked the first pipe of the day under the cedar.</p>

  <p>As the Rector went to meet her, she looked up at him in helpless
  appeal.</p>

  <p>"I'm frightfully early. But I couldn't help it. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He tried to encourage her with his smile.</p>

  <p>"Have you come about the Banns? Or do you want a Special Licence?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, nothing like that. It's private."</p>

  <p>The Rector's face changed.</p>

  <p>"Shall we come to my study?" he asked, glancing at Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"No. Mr. Brown can hear what I have to say."</p>

  <p>Ignatius, who was studying her, rather admired her self-control. Her small
  white form was lost in the depths of the big 'Varsity chair; but although she
  looked fragile as a convolvulus, her face was composed and her hands were
  still.</p>

  <p>"It's not easy to explain," she said. "But I've had three anonymous
  letters."</p>

  <p>"And, of course, you've burned them all?" broke in Ignatius
  venomously.</p>

  <p>"Of course...The awful part is that I'm afraid I know <i>who</i> wrote
  them. Naturally, I don't like even to think it, much less tell anyone
  else."</p>

  <p>"But it is your duty," said the Rector gravely. "We have had one tragedy.
  At all costs, we must prevent another."</p>

  <p>"I know. That's what frightens me. If I don't speak, it might be
  murder."</p>

  <p>Vivian clasped her hands tightly and apparently went off at a tangent.</p>

  <p>"You remember the War? When sometimes there wasn't time to get married, so
  one got carried away...Well, it <i>didn't</i> happen to me. I want you to
  remember that. After he was killed, I was sorry I hadn't the same pluck other
  girls had. It was wicked of me, but I was...But <i>now</i>, everything's
  different. Supposing I <i>had</i>. You can imagine what my feelings would be
  now. I should be mad with fear of exposure. But, because I nearly did, I can
  understand why Mrs. Scudamore killed herself...So I know what these letters
  would mean to someone who <i>had</i>."</p>

  <p>"One minute, Miss Sheriff," broke in Ignatius. "Are we to understand that
  you are threatened with exposure of some trifling indiscretion?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, an indiscretion." Vivian clutched at the word. "I'll tell you
  everything."</p>

  <p>She took rather a long time to tell them about the visits to the bungalow,
  and its sequel, because of her insistence on the frigidly correct behaviour
  of young Belson and herself.</p>

  <p>"We were not even friendly friends, if you know what I mean. Just
  <i>friends</i>. That's what makes it so unjust&mdash;so scandalous, that he
  thought the worst."</p>

  <p>"How do you know he did?" asked Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"Because he changed completely. He's never been the same to me since."</p>

  <p>As the Rector appeared confused, Ignatius enlightened him tactfully.</p>

  <p>"You're talking of the man who rang the bell and then looked through the
  window of the bungalow, aren't you?" he asked. "Do you suspect him of writing
  these letters?"</p>

  <p>"Who else can it be? He's the only one who knows about me. And he must
  know a lot of secrets about his patients." The Rector raised his heavy brows
  significantly. "Are you accusing Dr. Perry?" he asked sternly. Vivian did not
  answer the question.</p>

  <p>"I have told you all I know," she said. "I must go now. Good-bye."</p>

  <p>The Rector's face was shadowed with gloom, but he forced a smile.</p>

  <p>"All this has been very painful for you," he said. "Thank you sincerely.
  You've been very brave."</p>

  <p>"I've only done my duty."</p>

  <p>Vivian glanced at Ignatius, but he had no compliments to offer her, as he
  thought of the burned evidence.</p>

  <p>"Please don't come with me to the gate," she said. "One can slip out so
  much easier alone. I don't want the doctor to know I've been here. He may
  suspect."</p>

  <p>She fluttered a few paces down the drive, like a white butterfly, and then
  flitted back, holding something which she offered to the Rector.</p>

  <p>"I nearly forgot. Here's your envelope you asked for...And please
  remember. I never <i>did</i>."</p>

  <p>The Rector was not aware that his face expressed doubt, until Ignatius
  spoke, as though in answer to some question.</p>

  <p>"No, Tigger, she <i>didn't</i>. She hasn't the guts. But if Miss Brook
  ever spins you that yarn, you'd better investigate." With a sudden change of
  mood, he kissed his hand to the white figure just slipping through the
  gate.</p>

  <p>"Our thanks are due to that delicate and protesting lady," he said. "May I
  trouble you for that envelope? And now I must ring up the garage for my car.
  I'm going up to London immediately. Back tonight."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" asked the Rector.</p>

  <p>"In London? I'll tell you later. At present, I'm going into the study, to
  write a note to Dr. Perry. It's a bit premature, but it may be important.
  Will you see that it is sent to him, by hand, and without delay?"</p>

  <p>The Rector gazed at his remorseless face with troubled eyes. "Must you?"
  he muttered. "In spite of everything, I always like the fellow."</p>

  <p>Ignatius merely smiled. Without meaning to do so, Vivian had placed him on
  the rack of suspense, by withholding the important envelope until the last
  moment. In unconscious imitation, he remained silent, until just as his car
  was moving.</p>

  <p>"That was a lucky lunch at the Towers," he remarked. "It was then that
  Miss Martin told me that our anonymous friend had made the inevitable false
  step."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch31"
     id="ch31"></a>XXXI. &mdash; THE WAY OUT</h2>

  <p class="first">IN spite of the ferment of his mind, the Rector was faithful
  in the commission of his trust. His house-keeper delivered the note into the
  doctor's hands not more than ten minutes later than Ignatius' departure to
  London.</p>

  <p>The doctor, who was in his surgery, looked at the word 'Urgent' on the
  envelope with dull eyes. Nothing was of importance to him that day, least of
  all the stringency of another person's business.</p>

  <p>During the past week he had lost his curiosity&mdash;or rather, his
  curiosity was focused exclusively on one subject. As a matter of purely
  academic interest, he wondered which was the most effective method of
  committing suicide.</p>

  <p>Of course he had not the least intention of taking his own life. He
  assured himself of that repeatedly. The present offered too many problems,
  the chief of which was the adjustment of expenditure with income.</p>

  <p>This should have been easy, for, as Joan had once declared, the favoured
  families of the village all possessed pedigrees and private incomes. She had
  also stated that everyone was married&mdash;and therein lay the rub.</p>

  <p>Had the doctor remained a bachelor, he could have lived in comfort at St.
  James' House, without the aid of any tributaries to swell the main stream of
  his dividends. But, since his marriage, he had converted Stock repeatedly, in
  order to meet Marianne's constant demands.</p>

  <p>Even so, Life had been a pleasant jumble, in the days before the first
  anonymous letter. He thought wistfully of that vanished Past, which held the
  Scudamores and Julia Corner.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the village had not been Life itself&mdash;but merely its
  reflection in the magic mirror of a crystal pool. There was no ugliness or
  turbulence to make it real&mdash;only the beauty and fantasy of a dream.</p>

  <p>But a wind had blown over the water, and flawed the surface to a
  distorting-glass. Nothing remained the same.</p>

  <p>The sun shone through the glass roof of the surgery striking through the
  rows of bottles and sprinkling the walls and ceiling with rainbow
  reflections. When the wind shook the trees outside, these luminous spots
  danced like fairies. The doctor watched them, half mesmerised by the
  quivering colours, as he sighed for that vanished tranquillity, when his
  leisurely days had been filled with professional visits, which differed from
  a social call, principally by the fact that he was paid to drink tea.</p>

  <p>Gone were the wealthy spinsters and comfortable widows, with their prudent
  avoidance of illness and their punctual cheques. Even although they still
  resided in the village, in reality, they were living in a different
  planet.</p>

  <p>But the doctor did not contemplate suicide. Nothing was further from his
  thoughts. On the whole, he found the situation rather amusing. For all these
  pleasant people were still his friends. Had anyone of them a hint as to the
  actual state of his finances there would have been a run on his professional
  services.</p>

  <p>Only, a whisper had stolen abroad, which vaguely connected him with the
  poison-letters. No one believed the rumour, but each person waited on his
  neighbour. It was herd-instinct, which caused them to stampede in a huddle,
  and then, immediately afterwards, to fall apart, in distrustful clusters.</p>

  <p>'They're not cruel,' reflected the doctor. 'They're afraid.'</p>

  <p>His eyes fell on the note in his limp hand. Although he was incurious, he
  was on the point of opening it when he heard his wife's steps in the
  hall&mdash;now sharp on the parquet, now dull, over a rug.</p>

  <p>At this minute he did not wish to see her. She had been in an especially
  perverse mood at breakfast, not leaving him in peace, and stinging his brain,
  like a mosquito, so that it still felt swollen and incapable of consecutive
  thought.</p>

  <p>She burst into the surgery, electric with energy which shamed his own
  sluggishness.</p>

  <p>"Who's that note from?" she asked instantly.</p>

  <p>The doctor instinctively put it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"No one in particular. From the Rectory," he replied.</p>

  <p>"How explicit." Marianne looked at him with a spice of mockery. "Horatio,
  <i>did</i> you wake up this morning?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure. I feel rather stagnant."</p>

  <p>"Then why on earth don't you <i>do</i> something?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing to do."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll tell you something <i>I</i> want done," said Marianne briskly.
  "Nurse says that if the babies are not to go to the sea, the best thing to do
  is to rig up a sun-shelter on the roof, where they'll be out of the way of
  mosquitoes."</p>

  <p>"Brilliant woman. Her obvious deduction is that mosquitoes cannot walk
  upstairs."</p>

  <p>Marianne flamed at the hint of satire in the doctor's quiet voice.</p>

  <p>"At least she takes an interest in my babies' welfare which is more than
  their father does," she said angrily. "Oh, don't look at me in that doped
  way...Do wake up."</p>

  <p>"The last thing I wish to do."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, go to sleep again and make a thorough job of it."</p>

  <p>"Strange you should say that." The doctor's voice was almost inaudible.
  "But, unfortunately, one always wakes up again." Marianne turned towards the
  door.</p>

  <p>"I can make nothing of you, in this mood," she told him. "If I were you I
  should take a cold bath."</p>

  <p>"I've had one."</p>

  <p>"A hot one, then. It might stimulate you to some sort of action."</p>

  <p>She spoke with contempt, which melted in a sudden change of mood. In one
  lightning swoop, she was on her knees beside him, and holding him close.</p>

  <p>"Darling, think of me," she said, as she kissed him vehemently.</p>

  <p>"Strange you should do that," murmured the doctor.</p>

  <p>The slam of the door woke him partially, so that he began to think of
  Marianne's suggestion. A hot bath? It was really rather curious that she
  should have given such topical advice.</p>

  <p>While he had been dreamily thinking of the different methods of committing
  suicide, the one which appealed most was opening a vein. He had evidence that
  the lawyer had made a shockingly messy business of his exodus, while Mrs.
  Scudamore's end was a trifle ignominious. She seemed to him rather too
  stately a lady to finish up adequately in a scullery.</p>

  <p>He again assured himself that he had no intention of committing suicide.
  It was merely an interesting speculation. His ears began to burn, and he
  remembered the old superstition.</p>

  <p>At that moment, two persons were speaking of him In a beautiful old-world
  garden, two ladies, with flat heels and high insteps, reviewed their
  flower-borders and talked of those preliminary aches which heralded the
  Enemy.</p>

  <p>"I don't care," declared the younger sister, who was still defiant, "I
  shall not call in a strange doctor. I shall remain faithful to my dear Dr.
  Perry."</p>

  <p>Her nose was dominant, since it was an heirloom, but her mouth was gentle.
  The corners turned up as her elder sister made a suggestion.</p>

  <p>"In that case, why don't you send for him?"</p>

  <p>"Can we?" queried the younger lady. "The Squire never calls him in now. I
  never enquired the reason, for I refuse to talk scandal about my dear doctor.
  But men understand these things better than we do."</p>

  <p>"The Squire blows his own nose&mdash;not yours," said her sister bluntly.
  "You have to do that for yourself. You know your late summer hay fever is
  near. Better tell Markham to ring up Dr. Perry."</p>

  <p>The debate continued...Meanwhile, with the letter, still unopened, in his
  pocket, the doctor forced himself to mount the shallow stairs to the
  bathroom.</p>

  <p>He paused on the square landing, to look down at the hall, as though he
  was viewing a scene from some play. Through the open front door, was a slice
  of sunlit turf, the brilliance of flowers, the drip of windy shadows. Doves
  cooed and babies laughed and shouted. A red reflection from the stained glass
  window lay on the oaken floor like a crimson rose.</p>

  <p>Still heavy as a log, the doctor entered the bathroom and turned on the
  hot-water tap. The floor was sloppy, but he did not notice it. The disorder
  which seemed to be the logical result of the babies' baths, failed to rouse
  him to distaste.</p>

  <p>He took off his coat and threw it on a chair, where it hung upside down,
  so that the note slipped from the pocket to the floor. The doctor looked at
  it, but made no effort to pick it up, as he again thought of the village.</p>

  <p>'A beautiful dream. No one here is really alive except the Rector and Joan
  Brook, who don't belong. The Squire, for all his noise, is only a bit of
  tradition. Most of the people are descendants of their ancestors. In fact, we
  are all characters from some book, with a pleasant plot.'</p>

  <p>Even Julia Corner, now that her bright colours were dimmed and her loud
  laughter withdrawn into the eternal silence, seemed to him a creation of her
  own fiction. Then he remembered the exception&mdash;his own wife, with her
  passion for life, which projected her&mdash;like a flaming comet&mdash;into
  the future.</p>

  <p>She wanted no compromise, but welcomed the rack and the turn of the screw;
  the ecstasy of the wind; the joy of waking to each fresh day, because of the
  next leaf, still untorn from the calendar. Passion, pain, unrest&mdash;all
  that was life; her hands were greedily opened to clutch at the whole of
  it.</p>

  <p>The doctor suddenly felt a wave of tenderness for Marianne. As he thought
  of her, Fear, who was still her faithful cavalier, left her, to act as
  <i>valet-de-chambre</i> to her husband.</p>

  <p>"You love your wife and your children," it whispered. "You want to make
  them secure, don't you? Listen. You have only begun to nibble at your
  capital. A good lump remains, which would he increased by your Insurances. If
  your wife had to depend on herself, she would be forced to economise for the
  sake of her babies. Her income, though small, would be certain. She would not
  starve."</p>

  <p>The doctor shivered slightly as he acknowledged the inexorable logic. He
  could see no flaw in it.</p>

  <p>The bath was full and he tested its temperature with his elbow. It felt
  soothingly hot, so that he could imagine the pleasure of lying in it, as in
  some warm embrace in which he could sleep for ever.</p>

  <p>"You have a corn," whispered Fear. "Hadn't you better fetch your case of
  instruments?"</p>

  <p>The doctor slipped on his dressing-gown, but was too torpid to tie the
  girdle. When he reached the hall, the sunny stretch of boards was warm to his
  feet. A kitten stopped chasing a ball to run after his dangling tails. It
  followed him to the surgery and stalked him up the stairs.</p>

  <p>But when it reached the bathroom it spied the letter lying on the floor,
  and began to kill it. As it lay on its back, holding the letter in its front
  paws and kicking it furiously with its back legs, the doctor smiled faintly.
  Obedient to the natural instinct to prevent destruction, he languidly plucked
  the note from the kitten's mouth.</p>

  <p>"Want to know what's in it?" he asked. "All right, Kitty, I'll read it to
  you."</p>

  <p>As he tore open the envelope the expression of his face changed to intent
  surprise. The note was from Ignatius.</p>

  <p>'You may be interested to know,' it ran, 'that I have positive proof of
  the identity of the person who has been circulating the anonymous letters.
  Before night she will have left the village, and tomorrow everyone will know
  her name. This is a premature announcement, so you must regard it as
  confidential. But I have reason to believe that you have suffered some
  personal annoyance, so I wish you to be first to hear. In short, to quote
  your own Arab proverb: 'The night is over, oh Muleteer.'</p>

  <p>As he read, the blood rushed to the doctor's brain, flooding him with new
  life. Hope was in the air, whispering to him that the Old Order would soon
  return. He had forgotten about his corn as he sang in his bath.</p>

  <p>When he came out of the bathroom, the kitten perched on his shoulder,
  Marianne met him on the landing.</p>

  <p>"Had a good soak?" she asked. "You seem to be awake, at last."</p>

  <p>"I'm feeling rather cheerful," he told her. "We've both been too depressed
  to remember that there is always the Swing of the Pendulum."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the telephone-bell rang loudly. Marianne, who dashed to
  answer it, beckoned to her husband, as she listened to the message.</p>

  <p>"The Laurels speaking. It's Miss Featherstone's parlour-maid. Is the
  doctor at home?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch32"
     id="ch32"></a>XXXII. &mdash; TWO VISITS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Rector hardly knew how to get through the day until
  Ignatius returned. His mind spurt in circles of suspense, hope and fear. When
  he hurried out to meet the car his first glance told him that his friend had
  returned in triumph.</p>

  <p>He spoke to his chauffeur and then leaped to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Burgess and I want a quick sandwich and a long drink," he said, "before
  we start off again. Leave her there, Burgess. The housekeeper will find you
  something."</p>

  <p>The little man led the way to the dining-room, where he sank into a
  chair.</p>

  <p>"I drove coming back," he told the Rector. "Exhausting. Well, Padre, very
  soon I shall clear the village of an undesirable alien."</p>

  <p>"Alien?" repeated the Rector dully. "Then&mdash;it's not the doctor."</p>

  <p>"Heavens, no. It's a woman, of course...How long have you been here,
  Tigger?"</p>

  <p>"Nearly three years."</p>

  <p>"Good. I suppose, when you have to write to one of the Miss Martins, you
  would put her Christian name on the envelope, to save confusion?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. Everyone calls them by their Christian names. They're nice,
  informal girls."</p>

  <p>"That's all." Ignatius sprang to his feet, and went out of the
  dining-room, munching a sandwich. "Want to know where I've been?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, you'll soon know."</p>

  <p>The Rector remained silent, partly from fear of what he might learn, and
  also, from some confused wish to test his strength of character. He told
  himself that if he could not suffer the torture of suspense for a limited
  period he was a spineless coward.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he could see that Ignatius was in his unhuman mood, when he
  seemed akin to an elemental, and older than the hills.</p>

  <p>Unresponsive to any touch of nature, he wanted to lead up to his efforts,
  after the manner of a show-man. Cramming another sandwich into his mouth, he
  led the way to the waiting car, where he gave an order to the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"Court."</p>

  <p>The Rector sat silent and sweating during the short drive. When they
  reached the house, Ignatius asked to see Miss Brook. They waited in the
  drawing-room, from whose vast windows they looked out at parterres of
  gladioli, instead of irises. Two minutes later, Joan&mdash;radiant with
  expectation&mdash;ran into the room.</p>

  <p>"You want to see <i>me?</i>" she asked eagerly, glancing at the
  Rector.</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> did," said Ignatius. "Have you a portable typewriter?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>"Then will you bring it over to the Rectory tomorrow morning to do some
  private and confidential secretarial work?" Joan stared at him in
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"I should hardly like to ask Lady d'Arcy's permission," she said.</p>

  <p>"She'll spare you, when she knows the circumstances," Ignatius told her.
  "I want you&mdash;with the help of the Rector&mdash;to make copies of the
  confession of the person who has been writing these anonymous letters, and
  send one to everyone in the village."</p>

  <p>Joan's mouth, as well as her eyes, opened in amazement. "You know?" she
  gasped. "Oh, who is it?"</p>

  <p>Ignatius looked at her with his ancient wizened grin.</p>

  <p>"You'll know that tomorrow. If it's any consolation to you, you will get
  the early edition of the news, before the rest of the village."</p>

  <p>Joan made a gesture of exasperation.</p>

  <p>"But I can't wait." She nodded towards the Rector. "Does <i>he</i>
  know?"</p>

  <p>"No, so you needn't hope to get it out of him. But, very soon, he is
  coming with me to interview the lady in the case."</p>

  <p>"Lady? <i>Oh!</i>" Joan gazed intently at Ignatius, a dawning horror in
  her eyes. "I believe I can guess where you're going," she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think you can," he replied.</p>

  <p>"It's terrible...But I seem to have known it all along."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you've been behind the scenes. Do you remember that night when we
  strolled through the village? By the way, you gave me a useful hint."</p>

  <p>"I? When?"</p>

  <p>"When you pointed out the importance of a first impression."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad I was of some use." Joan looked at the Rector with glowing eyes.
  "But I can't believe that the village will really return to normal
  again."</p>

  <p>"In a week your broken social round will be in full circle again,"
  declared Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"It's too wonderful. The old times back again. And we have to thank you
  for it all."</p>

  <p>The Rector knew what she meant. The barrier between them was lowered. Her
  smile was not only happy, but possessive. It made him feel confused and
  overwhelmed before this sudden rush of good fortune.</p>

  <p>Ignatius' acid voice recalled the lovers to earth.</p>

  <p>"I've not so much to thank you for, after all, Miss Brook. Miss Corner
  fouled the trail once, and you might have done so, for the second time. Your
  lie was both stupid and dangerous. It might have involved you in a serious
  tangle. Of course, you were afraid of losing your post. Weren't you?"</p>

  <p>As Joan bit her lip in uncertainty, Ignatius assured her.</p>

  <p>"There is no danger of that now, for nothing will go further than this
  room. Besides, your grandmother has been dead for a long time...Why did you
  write that anonymous letter to Mrs. Pomfret?"</p>

  <p>Joan's smile became suddenly audacious.</p>

  <p>"I thought your memory would explain that," she said. "Don't you remember,
  the first time we met, telling me a tale about a dog?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I invented it."</p>

  <p>"Did you? That's amusing, for it gave me a useful pointer. Mrs. Pomfret
  was half-starving her little servant. I told you about it, when we met her,
  that evening."</p>

  <p>Ignatius hid his annoyance.</p>

  <p>"You did. Mrs. Pomfret spoke of a foul and baseless accusation. Was your
  letter abusive?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. I wrote as one lady to another. I pretended I was one of
  her friends. I said I was distressed by the outrageous and untruthful
  whispers which were circulated through the village, about Edie looking so
  pale and thin. I didn't believe one word of them, myself, but I thought it
  was my duty to let her know."</p>

  <p>"But, Joan," broke in the Rector, "you're making a terrible accusation.
  Mrs. Pomfret would be the very last person to be cruel to a girl."</p>

  <p>Joan grimaced expressively at Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"What did I tell you?" she asked. "<i>No one</i> would believe it. But
  it's all right now. It was a mistake and it's been put right. <i>She</i> was
  horrified, too...That was a lucky <i>lie</i> of yours, Mr. Brown."</p>

  <p>"Yours, too," said Ignatius. "It's given me an opportunity of appreciating
  your true character. Good evening, Miss Brook."</p>

  <p>He walked from the room, so that the Rector was able to say 'good-bye' to
  Joan, in private. When he came down the steps of the portico&mdash;his face
  and heart on fire&mdash;he was chilled by Ignatius' direction to the
  chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"Spout."</p>

  <p>The drive seemed a fantastic nightmare to the Rector, so terrible and
  incredible was the implication of the address. Old hints returned to his mind
  with hideous meaning. Joan's wide eyes and parting lips, which showed that
  she shared the knowledge, was the bitterest memory.</p>

  <p>He told himself that he had lost so many ideals&mdash;suffered so much
  disillusionment. He could not bear to witness a saint crash down from her
  pedestal.</p>

  <p>It was growing dark, and the day was drowning in a downfall of fine rain.
  They reached the 'Spout', in a raw twilight. The ancient house showed a blank
  face with no glimmer of light; and, as they waited for the door to be opened,
  they heard, all around them, the gurgles of imprisoned water.</p>

  <p>The place seemed haunted with sin and suffering. When the gaunt
  parlourmaid opened the door, the Rector&mdash;who was worked up to the limit
  of his endurance&mdash;shrank back, as though the atmosphere of the interior
  was tainted.</p>

  <p>He felt that the old house was unhappy, and sick unto death. Its peace had
  fled, and&mdash;like him&mdash;it could dream no more of the past.</p>

  <p>Rose showed them into the panelled parlour, which was close from lack of
  air, and dampy warm. All the shutters were fastened, and a choked fire
  smouldered in the dog-grate.</p>

  <p>The two women sat in their usual places&mdash;Miss Asprey in the pool of
  lamp-light, and Miss Mack in the shadows. Both looked up as the men entered,
  but, before Miss Asprey could speak, Ignatius crossed to Miss Mack, and held
  out the envelope which Vivian Sheriff had given him.</p>

  <p>"Yours," he said.</p>

  <p>She looked at him with her placid smile. Her glossy face and serene
  light-blue eyes reminded the Rector of a china doll. Then he glanced at Miss
  Asprey and noticed how the veins of her hands stood out in swollen cords, as
  she gripped the arms of her chair.</p>

  <p>Her tense attitude and frozen expression testified to the extremity of
  fear. She was waiting for a thunderbolt to crash down and destroy her.</p>

  <p>Miss Mack took the envelope, glanced at it, and then walked to Miss
  Asprey's chair.</p>

  <p>"<i>Yours</i>," she said.</p>

  <p>A violent shudder ran through Miss Asprey, leaving her so still and rigid
  that it might have been a current of electrocution which had blasted her
  life.</p>

  <p>Ignatius' acid voice bit the silence.</p>

  <p>"I've been waiting for you to make your false step, Miss Mack. You made it
  when you addressed that letter to 'Miss C. Martin'. As the four sisters all
  possess the same initial, no resident would have made that slip."</p>

  <p>As Miss Mack's face remained blank, he went on to explain. "Since the
  Martins have been abroad for two years, it is conclusive that the person who
  addressed that envelope, has been in the neighbourhood for less than two
  years. That person would naturally take it for granted that the two ladies,
  who are at present at the Towers, were 'Miss Martin' and 'Miss C. Martin',
  respectively&mdash;especially as she was not formally introduced to
  them."</p>

  <p>"The letter might have been intended for anyone of them," said Miss Mack
  coolly. "They all brag of their bargains."</p>

  <p>"A shrewd hit," commented Ignatius. "But&mdash;how did you know what was
  in their anonymous letter?"</p>

  <p>Miss Mack made no attempt to clear herself; her calm smile proclaimed her
  mistress of the situation.</p>

  <p>"Why do you come to me?" she asked. "Miss Brook is more of a stranger than
  me."</p>

  <p>"Another shrewd hit. Only I happen to possess a specimen of her printing.
  I have just returned from London, where I submitted Miss Brook's envelope,
  and this one, to an expert in handwriting. He has stated definitely that Miss
  Brook did not address this envelope."</p>

  <p>"Of course not," said Miss Mack, wriggling again out of the net.
  "<i>She</i> did."</p>

  <p>She pointed to Miss Asprey, who sat in her chair, white and stiff as a
  dead woman.</p>

  <p>"Can you prove this?" asked Ignatius softly.</p>

  <p>"I can prove that she wrote the first letter&mdash;the one to herself. She
  started the game with herself, so that no one should suspect her. But I've
  got the copy of that letter in her own writing. When the people here see
  that, they'll know who's been sending these letters, and driving the poor
  Scudamores and Miss Corner to their deaths."</p>

  <p>Again the spasm rent Miss Asprey's frozen calm. Miss Mack glanced at her
  employer, as she went on speaking.</p>

  <p>"She'll be driven from the village. Everyone knows that nobody writes a
  letter to herself, saying she's no better than she ought to be, unless
  there's something underneath."</p>

  <p>The Rector looked at Miss Asprey, expectant of her denial. To his dismay,
  she presented a pitiful spectacle of guilty shame. Her ivory face was
  crimson, her eyes were downcast, and her fingers shook as they tried to clasp
  the arms of her chair.</p>

  <p>Ignatius, too, looked at her, as he spoke in a voice tinged with
  respect.</p>

  <p>"As you say, Miss Mack, no one could write such a letter but Miss Asprey.
  It would be hopeless to try to make you understand the almost terrifying
  purity of a nature which holds so little of earth that she seems to belong to
  the Company of Angels and Archangels. Miss Asprey cannot be satisfied with
  less than perfection, which is impossible to human nature. She has no faults
  of her own, so she has burdened herself with the reflections of other
  people's sins."</p>

  <p>As he listened, the Rector feared that Ignatius had exceeded the limits of
  credulity; no one could possibly swallow such gross flattery.</p>

  <p>To his astonishment, however, Miss Asprey's response to the overdose was
  almost instantaneous. Within two sentences, she changed from a shamed culprit
  to her familiar composed and magnificent self.</p>

  <p>It was so plain to him that Ignatius knew exactly how to handle the
  delicate situation that he gave up worrying over the outcome, and followed,
  with keen interest, the duel between Ignatius and Miss Mack. There was no
  doubt that she would be exceedingly difficult to corner, for her smiling
  indifference was akin to a coating of grease. She made no attempt to proclaim
  her innocence, but&mdash;confident that she could slip out of any
  grasp&mdash;she merely challenged Ignatius to prove her guilt.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you mentioned the draft of that first letter," said Ignatius. "I
  was just going to bring up the matter myself. Of course, I knew you had
  it...I want it, please."</p>

  <p>"So do I," smiled Miss Mack. "Are you making me an offer?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"What's your price?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Asprey's promise not to prosecute."</p>

  <p>"Prosecute?" Miss Mack elevated her fair brows.</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"Blackmail."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that? Miss Asprey has never written me any cheques,
  except for my salary."</p>

  <p>The Rector feared that Ignatius had, himself, received a check. He was up
  against an intangible adversity he could not fight&mdash;the Spirit of the
  Village, which resented any advertisement of private business. The little man
  knew it, and his air of confidence was a shade overdone, as he appealed to
  Miss Asprey.</p>

  <p>"I shall have Miss Asprey's evidence," he said, "that she has paid you
  sums of money, from time to time, for your silence. Her word will be taken
  before yours."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey shook her head with cold dignity.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she said, "but I prefer to do nothing in the matter."</p>

  <p>Ignatius was silent for a minute, before he turned to Miss Mack with fresh
  assurance.</p>

  <p>"In that case, Miss Mack, it rests with you to clear yourself. You can
  show us your Post Office Savings Book, and let us see if your deposits
  correspond with your salary."</p>

  <p>Miss Mack grasped the point, for, in her turn, she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "Besides, it doesn't matter. I have the copy of her
  letter. She doesn't want her friends to know she wrote that."</p>

  <p>Once again the convulsive quiver tore Miss Asprey's frame. To calm her,
  Ignatius spoke with quiet authority.</p>

  <p>"No one will ever know. Miss Asprey appealed to the Confessional. It
  should not fail her."</p>

  <p>He turned to Miss Mack.</p>

  <p>"This is my offer. From that tacit admission that your Bank is the Post
  Office, the sums that Miss Asprey has already paid you cannot exceed a
  certain figure. I imagine that she would prefer to write off her loss, rather
  than be exposed to annoyance."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey inclined her stately head.</p>

  <p>"So," went on Ignatius, "she will not prosecute you. My car will take you
  to London tonight, and leave you at the Saint Monica Hostel for Women, where
  you are expected. Another good and easy situation will be found for you. We
  are taking into consideration the rather peculiar circumstances of your case.
  So Miss Asprey will continue her interest in you, but it will be passive, and
  not active. I warn you that there will be a certain supervision of your
  actions, so it will be wiser for you to be more circumspect, in the
  future...Isn't that a good and generous offer?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Miss Mack.</p>

  <p>"Then, consider the alternative. Your money will soon be spent. What will
  be your future, without friends, without work, without a reference? You are
  not attractive enough for night-life, and not clever enough for crime. You
  will be where you were before Miss Asprey befriended you&mdash;down and
  out."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Miss Mack.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you are sensible. In return, I will only ask for that draft of
  Miss Asprey's letter, together with your signature to this confession...Would
  you like to read it first?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, please," replied Miss Mack.</p>

  <p>She took the typewritten sheet, and scanned it with deliberation, before
  she returned it.</p>

  <p>"You want something for nothing," she said. "No, thank you. I'm <i>not</i>
  going. I can show that draft to the Squire. I'm sure Miss Asprey would rather
  I stayed with her, instead. Wouldn't you, Miss Asprey?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the low reply.</p>

  <p>The Rector, who was ignorant of what cards were held, thought that
  Ignatius was beaten. But the little man had kept his trump for the end of the
  game.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "you will go tonight. There is still one point I have not
  mentioned. Miss Asprey, out of mistaken nobility, has concealed your past
  career. So you will be a discredited witness and a target for reproach. No
  one would believe your word, <i>then</i>, before Miss Asprey's."</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey made a vehement gesture of dissent.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Brown, I will <i>not</i> permit this. It is against my principles
  to trample on the fallen. That is my own secret&mdash;and hers."</p>

  <p>"You can please yourself, so long as it was your secret, only," Ignatius
  reminded her. "But I made it my business to find out this interesting lady's
  past. For the sake of public morality I shall make it known, if Miss Mack
  doesn't listen to reason."</p>

  <p>Miss Mack's china-blue eyes retained their tranquillity as she sat in
  thought. Presently she smiled at Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"You asked me to go abroad," she said. "I would prefer to oblige you by
  joining those ladies."</p>

  <p>Ignatius was so amused by her sheer impudence, that, for a moment, the
  Rector thought he would weaken. But such gestures were not part of his mental
  outfit.</p>

  <p>"I remember," he said, turning the knife with conscious cruelty. "Easy
  motoring and excellent food. I'm sorry, Miss Mack, but Opportunity does not
  knock twice...Let it be a warning to you not to refuse my second offer."</p>

  <p>"I'll sign," said Miss Mack calmly.</p>

  <p>Ignatius produced his fountain-pen, and he stood over her, watching the
  firm, deliberate strokes, as she signed her name to the confession.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said. "How long will it take for you to pack?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty minutes."</p>

  <p>"I have allowed you half an hour, when the car will be round."</p>

  <p>"All right...Is your chauffeur married?"</p>

  <p>Another flicker touched Ignatius' lips at this touch of
  ultra-respectability.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, "but he's very respectable. You can trust him...Please
  bring the draft with you when you come down."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch, when Miss Mack had pattered obediently from the
  room.</p>

  <p>"If you will put up with me, I should like to see her off the premises,"
  he said. "I'm afraid the ethics of strict justice and morality are not
  satisfied by my compromise&mdash;but, in the circumstances, it is the best I
  can do."</p>

  <p>"I am grateful," said Miss Asprey, "for your tact and forbearance."</p>

  <p>"Then that's all right. Shall I open the windows?"</p>

  <p>"Please do. Wide."</p>

  <p>Ignatius waited for the Rector to unfasten the shutters. Miss Asprey drew
  a deep breath of relief as the night-air swept into the room, in a rainy gust
  of wind.</p>

  <p>"Have you been to Palestine?" asked Ignatius, breaking an awkward
  pause.</p>

  <p>Miss Asprey told him that she had visited the Holy Land, in her youth, and
  the period of waiting was bridged by mutual comparisons of travel. Presently,
  Miss Mack returned, buttoned into a tweed coat, and looking a pleasant,
  homely little woman.</p>

  <p>"Here it is," she said, giving Ignatius a sealed envelope. "Good-bye, Miss
  Asprey. Thank you for all your kindness."</p>

  <p>Before she could reach the door, Ignatius called her back.</p>

  <p>"One minute, please, Miss Mack," he said smoothly, holding out the paper
  he had just ripped from the envelope. "There seems to be a little mistake.
  This is only a copy of the draft. A very creditable copy, I admit, only I
  seem to recognise certain slight characteristics, which I noticed, just now,
  in your signature...I want the original, please."</p>

  <p>Still smiling, Miss Mack opened her large hand-bag, and gave him a second
  paper&mdash;dirty and creased&mdash;which, after a close scrutiny, he
  accepted.</p>

  <p>"Your property," he said, as he handed it to Miss Asprey. Then he turned
  to Miss Mack.</p>

  <p>"Allow me to see you to your car," he said, opening the door for her, and
  following her from the room.</p>

  <p>When they were alone, the Rector spoke to Miss Asprey. "May I burn it?" he
  asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Please do."</p>

  <p>With shaking fingers, he stuffed the paper into the dying fire. As he
  watched it blaze up, and then crumble to ash, he heard a sigh tremble through
  the room.</p>

  <p>A saint was secure on her pedestal.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch33"
     id="ch33"></a>XXXIII. &mdash; IGNATIUS EXPLAINS</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was pouring when the two men returned from Spout Manor,
  and the study looked so cheerless that the Rector put a match to the fire. He
  was about to light the lamp, when Ignatius stopped him.</p>

  <p>"No. I have a story to tell. All good stories should be told by
  firelight."</p>

  <p>The little man was wrought up to a pitch of jubilant vanity, when he was
  alive to every dramatic effect. As he sat hunched up in his big chair,
  hugging his knees on which he rested his pointed chin, he looked like a
  gnome, peeping out from the roots of a hollow oak.</p>

  <p>The glow from the fire flickered on his lined face, accentuating its
  hollows and exaggerating the malice of his grin. He clawed in the air, to
  demand silence.</p>

  <p>"No questions, please, unless absolutely necessary to your
  understanding."</p>

  <p>He paused, to create the necessary suspense, before he began.</p>

  <p>"You remember the Squire's illness, and how the poison in his system was
  liberated by its unlucky combination with gelatine. At the time I remarked
  that there might be a parallel between his case and your little problem. And
  I was right.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mack was our poison; yet, although she had been in the village for
  nearly two years, she had been a negative quantity. Her nature is cruel,
  unscrupulous, ungrateful, and treacherous; she has no moral sense and is dead
  to any feeling of shame.</p>

  <p>"But, fortunately, she is stupid, so she did not know how to
  liberate&mdash;or shall we say, commercialise&mdash;her power for evil."
  Ignatius broke off his story to digress.</p>

  <p>"That was why, later on, she did indulge in general blackmail. It would
  have been a dangerous policy, of course, and what I should have expected of
  Miss Brook, if she had chosen the wrong turning, instead of being an
  exceedingly nice girl. But she has the character which Miss Mack does not
  possess.</p>

  <p>"To resume my tale, she remained&mdash;a dormant toxin&mdash;in the
  village system; yet, even in her turgid phase, she displayed her force. She
  has a will, which operates, not by pressure, but by suction. I believe that
  some of you had experience of her draining powers, although they were
  naturally attributed to Miss Asprey, as the mistress of Spout Manor. Who
  would dream of connecting healing&mdash;or morphine&mdash;properties, as the
  case might be, to the humble little companion, sitting meekly in her
  corner?</p>

  <p>"But, all the time she was living with Miss Asprey her stronger will was
  gradually giving her the mastery over her employer, although, owing to her
  lack of brain, she only made use of her power by asking for small
  favours&mdash;such as special food-fancies and getting her work reduced to a
  minimum. Later on, she went to more extreme lengths when her hatred of fresh
  air forced Miss Asprey to submit to closed windows. But I believe, in the
  beginning, Miss Asprey was unconscious of the true position.</p>

  <p>"Now, I must enlighten you as to Miss Asprey's real character. Everyone
  believes her to be a saint. She is very nearly one&mdash;unselfish,
  charitable, religious, and singularly free from faults...But she has one
  human failing, and that is vanity. She likes the homage she receives.
  Exposure, or ridicule, would be more than she could bear.</p>

  <p>"From childhood, she has suffered from a handicap which she has concealed
  under a show of icy austerity, and fine self-control. She is a victim to
  acute emotionalism. She had a bad break-down, at school, and another when she
  was obliged to give up her Rescue work.</p>

  <p>"In spite of her forced withdrawal, she continued her efforts to help
  others. Out of charity, she gave a home to Gertrude Mack, who had just served
  a term of imprisonment for shop-lifting. She was very kind to her, but,
  perhaps, was a shade too official. I am inferring this. She'd been used to
  deal with some very loose characters. There is no doubt that Miss Mack
  resented her treatment. But&mdash;all the time&mdash;while she was apparently
  supine, she was slowly sapping Miss Asprey's mental strength, until she had
  reduced her to so much pulp.</p>

  <p>"But still&mdash;the poison remained latent.</p>

  <p>"Presently, Miss Mack began to break out again. She pilfered from the
  maids, and, on one occasion, she took a brooch from Miss Brook. Miss Asprey
  would not give her away, for she evidently feared that exposure would destroy
  any chance Miss Mack had of a resurrection. So, in order to protect her
  friends from her attentions, she had to curtail Miss Mack's liberty. Then,
  she began to hate her employer...And, at this point, you come in, my
  friend."</p>

  <p>"I?" cried the Rector.</p>

  <p>"I asked you not to interrupt...Yes, you, my husky friend&mdash;a black
  bull of a fellow, with a hypnotic finger and chest-notes like thunder. I'm
  not blaming you, of course. If Miss Mack had not paved the way for you, and
  left poor Miss Asprey scooped out like a hollow nut, she would have got
  spiritual pleasure and profit from your red-hot Gospel.</p>

  <p>"But, as things were, your words fell on a hot-bed of hysteria. You goaded
  the poor, overwrought soul to the point of convicting herself of non-existent
  sin. Perhaps, also, she was worried by inhibitions; or you might have stirred
  up some residue from the mud of her Rescue Work.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, there she was, a damned miserable sinner, with no way of getting
  it out of her system. She wanted the relief of the Confessional...So she
  adopted the singular course of writing herself an anonymous letter,
  convicting herself of imaginary sin, which she showed to you. When you, so to
  speak, gave her Absolution, the crisis was past. She had worked the poison
  out of her system&mdash;so her scheme was, after all, a success.</p>

  <p>"Unluckily, someone gossiped, and the thing got about. Miss Corner got
  suspected&mdash;so wrote herself a letter also, to prove that she was a
  victim, and not the culprit. Then she, most unfortunately, passed out, for
  she was a valuable witness. After her death, the trouble began, for there was
  a general nasty feeling, and the rumour of suicide.</p>

  <p>"This was the signal for Miss Mack's sluggish brain to wake up. Directly
  after Miss Asprey had written her letter, the companion found a rough draft
  of it in the waste-paper-basket. Although she did not realise its value, she
  kept it. After Miss Corner's death, she saw its significance. That draft was
  proof that Miss Asprey had written the first letter, so would be under
  suspicion of having written others.</p>

  <p>"In fact, I don't see how any ordinary person could believe her innocence
  in the face of such damning evidence. Who&mdash;but myself&mdash;would accept
  a fantastic tale of her <i>wanting</i> her parson to know of her self-alleged
  moral depravity?</p>

  <p>"Well, Miss Mack now put her suckers into action. She realised that Miss
  Asprey would have to face the stigma of forcing Miss Corner to commit
  suicide&mdash;for that was the vague general notion. So she skilfully spread
  lying rumours, and began her anonymous letter campaign.</p>

  <p>"Her idea was to create a general atmosphere of fear and suspicion which
  would be attributed to Miss Asprey. Of course, she struck blindly, in the
  dark. She hated all the people who had money and security, but she was rather
  like a vicious child, hitting an adult below the belt. She believed these
  superior people immune to her attacks.</p>

  <p>"I can guess, therefore, at her reaction to the Scudamore suicides. I had
  one glimpse of her eyes when she heard the news. It's my belief, it made her
  drunk with power. After that, she must have got hold of some secret
  information, for she began a specially cruel persecution of Dr. Perry, which
  did him a lot of harm.</p>

  <p>"All the time, she was safe as a sharp-shooter who uses another body for
  his screen. Miss Asprey would receive the blame for whatever she did. She
  began to bleed her, as the price of her silence. Then, she spread her net a
  bit too wide, to include Miss Martin. You know the result."</p>

  <p>Ignatius stopped talking. In the leaping firelight, his eyes seemed sunken
  into pits above his pre-historic smile.</p>

  <p>"Now do you understand," he asked, "how that first innocent letter,
  written by poor Miss Asprey, proved the harmless gelatine which inoculated
  the poison?"</p>

  <p>He waited in vain for applause. Charles yawned, and walked pointedly to
  the biscuit-barrel. The Rector sighed deeply and lit the lamp.</p>

  <p>"Better have some light," he said dully. "And I think we'll both be better
  for a spot of Johnny Walker. You've certainly earned your drink, Ignatius.
  How long have you been talking?...But it's a terrible tale."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" smiled Ignatius, "I'm used to groping in the labyrinths of choked
  and distorted minds. It's exhilarating to follow the thread and prove myself
  right. Before I'd slept one night in the village, I had suspected the
  truth."</p>

  <p>The Rector and Charles exchanged sceptical glances, but Ignatius continued
  to gloat.</p>

  <p>"That first evening we went for a walk, and saw two women in the garden of
  Spout Manor. Instantly, I concluded, by her slight undefinable air of
  mastery, that Miss Mack was the mistress. My first impression is <i>never</i>
  wrong. After you told me of my mistake, I continued to linger on the
  possibility of strange relations between those two women, shut up together in
  that old house...Besides, you had already warned me to distrust Miss Asprey's
  air of ineffability."</p>

  <p>"I did not," declared the Rector.</p>

  <p>"Not in so many words," said Ignatius. "But, surely, you, yourself, must
  have been astonished when she insisted on your reading the alleged attack on
  her moral character? How did that square up with her character for dignity
  and austere reserve?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," admitted the Rector.</p>

  <p>"You see, therefore, I attended church, with some foreknowledge of Miss
  Asprey's hysteria. I studied her reaction to your sermon, while I was
  apparently, admiring her maid. <i>Again</i>, I was right, for I detected all
  the signs of suppressed neurosis. After that, it was a logical conclusion to
  see her in the character of a possible victim. And I began to concentrate on
  Miss Mack."</p>

  <p>"How?" asked the Rector.</p>

  <p>"I lost no time," explained Ignatius. "The same afternoon, I took Ada for
  a walk, and picked her brains. She was sharp, and suspected that I wanted to
  find out if Miss Asprey was severe to Miss Mack&mdash;a fact, which&mdash;if
  it was noticed&mdash;would have been approved by the servants."</p>

  <p>Ignatius broke off to chuckle.</p>

  <p>"Poor Ada. I learned that, firstly, Miss Mack had boasted of being
  mistress of the house; secondly, that the two women were always shut up
  together; and, lastly, that Ada had been losing personal trifles.</p>

  <p>"That evening, you showed me the envelope which had contained Miss
  Asprey's letter. As I was looking out for any trifle which might be helpful,
  I remarked the two initials. 'Miss Asprey' would have been the natural
  address, unless she habitually signed her initials, or unless the letter was
  written by someone who knew her very well.</p>

  <p>"The next morning, I made discreet enquiries of the Postmistress, and a
  few others, and established the fact that the lady was known, locally, as
  'Miss Asprey', although everyone knew her Christian name&mdash;'Decima'. But
  no one could tell me of a second Christian name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Was that why you called on her?" asked the Rector.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I went early, purposely, to get a peep at her old books. I
  wanted to find out <i>when</i> the second initial was dropped. I failed in my
  design, but Miss Asprey confirmed my guess at the dropped second name. She
  also revealed herself to me as a preordained victim for blackmail, owing to
  her sensitive vanity. Like a soldier who has been shot in rather a ridiculous
  place, she would rather suffer anything than admit that she had accused
  herself of having a Past."</p>

  <p>Ignatius stopped to smile at a recollection.</p>

  <p>"Wait," he said, "I must be fair to her. Once, she was on the point of
  confession. It was after your historical sermon, when you threatened your
  flock with desertion. She came back to the church, but Miss Mack followed
  her, and headed her off. She could not screw up her courage for a second
  effort. I realised, <i>then</i>, the strength of Miss Mack's hypnotic hold
  over her."</p>

  <p>"Go on," said the Rector, with his first show of real interest.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mack seemed to suspect me, for she followed me into the garden, when
  I visited Miss Asprey. To throw her off the scent, I pretended to believe she
  was the victim of Miss Asprey's secret cruelty, and offered my help...Then, I
  reviewed the situation.</p>

  <p>"As I told you, there were two explanations. The obvious was that Miss
  Corner had written both letters. <i>But</i>&mdash;if she did not know Miss
  Asprey had a second Christian name, the only other person who could
  conceivably have written it, was Miss Asprey herself."</p>

  <p>The little man's face radiated joy in his acuteness.</p>

  <p>"The one explanation seemed to entail another. I was perplexed as to the
  hold Miss Mack had over her employer, and guessed there must be some
  evidence. I remembered, too, that Miss Mack was the natural custodian of the
  waste-paper-basket. It seemed probable that Miss Asprey would not write her
  anonymous letter without first making some sort of rough draft, in her own
  writing. It was evident that, when she made her printed copy, the mere
  repetition of the charges had inflamed her to such a state of emotional
  frenzy that she unconsciously used her discarded initial when she addressed
  the envelope.</p>

  <p>"She would not, therefore, realise the importance of the draft, which she
  presumably threw away."</p>

  <p>Ignatius crowed with triumph, as he waved a long finger at the Rector.</p>

  <p>"You see, Tigger? I knew there must be a draft, which Miss Mack had got
  hold of, and which was proof of authorship of the letters. When I had
  established this probability, I instructed a private enquiry agent to find
  out something about Miss Asprey and Miss Mack. He had no trouble in verifying
  Miss Mack's past, as a thief. He also got in touch with a contemporary of
  Miss Asprey's, who was at her last school, with her, and she told him of her
  hysteria.</p>

  <p>"I had further proof of this, when that old clergyman came to lunch. Of
  course, decency forbade me to ask questions of him, and he would have told me
  nothing, if I had. But it seemed evident, from his reluctance to meet Miss
  Asprey again, that he wished to spare her a painful and embarrassing memory.
  So I was sure that she had given way to a violent fit of hysteria, when she
  crashed, and gave up her work, and that he had been a witness of it."</p>

  <p>"I see now," said the Rector, "why it all hinged on who wrote that first
  letter."</p>

  <p>"At last," sighed Ignatius. "I don't think there is much more to add. I
  kept my eye on that poison-head. The Scudamore tragedy proved that letters
  were being received, while, in the absence of general blackmail, Miss Asprey
  appeared to be the natural victim. I also discovered that Miss Asprey
  searched the house, to discover the draft, and, on one occasion, obtained it,
  for there was a struggle, when Miss Asprey was hurt. Joan Brook was with me
  when we heard her cry out in pain."</p>

  <p>"Horrible," shuddered the Rector.</p>

  <p>"It was. To my mind, there was something hideously grim in the way those
  two women clung to each other, like vines. In order to protect her guests,
  Miss Asprey did not dare let Miss Mack out of her sight, while even my offer
  of travel would not tempt the leech to leave her victim...Of course, I had to
  await developments and definite proof. And that is all."</p>

  <p>The Rector stopped rubbing his eyeballs.</p>

  <p>"I know I should thank you, Ignatius," he said. "But I'm thinking of my
  beautiful village. It stood for so much. What is left to me?"</p>

  <p>"Everything," declared Ignatius. "All this should confirm your belief in
  human nature. To begin with, I expect nearly everyone here has received an
  anonymous letter; but they only reacted to the general uneasiness, and
  certainly did not lose their sleep. All this proves a marvellously healthy
  moral record, and sound consciences.</p>

  <p>"Miss Asprey shows up well, too. Although she worshiped popularity, she
  laid herself under suspicion of bullying her companion, rather than expose
  Miss Mack in her true character of a shop-lifter.</p>

  <p>"Even my old enemy, Miss Corner, was rather decent, for, although she
  didn't care specially for Miss Asprey, she never gossiped about old
  school-days.</p>

  <p>"The Scudamore tragedy was nothing but a triumph of false social values.
  And the whole wretched business has served to rid Miss Asprey of a dangerous
  parasite, who would not have been satisfied until she drained her dry."</p>

  <p>The Rector's face was a study in conflicting emotions, as he listened to
  the long speech. Presently, the light returned to his eye, as he felt a gush
  of his old joy of life. He wanted to thank his friend for his deliverance,
  but found himself suddenly tongue-tied. Therefore, although he did not know
  it, he showed his gratitude to Ignatius in the way most calculated to please
  him. He asked him a last question.</p>

  <p>"You spoke of a woman who never smiled. Who is she?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Mack, of course," replied Ignatius.</p>

  <p>"But she is always smiling," said the Rector.</p>

  <p>Ignatius was in his element, as he explained.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly why I said she never smiles. A person will smile to
  express certain pleasant emotions&mdash;kindness, joy, amusement, and so on.
  But, as no one can experience perpetual happiness, a perpetual smile cancels
  itself out. I was on my guard directly I realised that Miss Mack's smile was
  no clue to her nature, but was worn as a mask."</p>

  <p>A little later, Ignatius took his last walk through the village,
  accompanied by the Rector. The rain had ceased and the air was washed and
  fragrant. The black-and-white Tudor cottages gleamed under the starlight,
  like models of ebon and ivory. Every window was screened with its glowing
  blind of rose or orange.</p>

  <p>Each house preserved its privacy, even while it had nothing to hide. There
  were no sinister secrets. Inside was domestic peace&mdash;contented maids in
  the kitchen, well-fed cats on the rug. Clocks ticked serenely, and music was
  drawn from the air.</p>

  <p>The postman's knock sounded faintly in the distance. He was bringing the
  last post&mdash;family news, invitations, Charity appeals, receipted
  bills.</p>

  <p>That was all. For nothing had happened here. Nothing would ever
  happen.</p>
