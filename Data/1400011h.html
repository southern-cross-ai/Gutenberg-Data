  <h3>Previously published in <i>Men, Women and Guns</i></h3>

  <p class="first">If you pass through the Menin-Gate at Ypres, and walk up the
  slight rise that lies on the other side of the moat, you will come to the
  parting of the ways. You will at the same time come to a spot of
  unprepossessing aspect, whose chief claim to notoriety lies in its
  shell-holes and broken-down houses. If you keep straight on you will in time
  come to the little village of Potige; if you turn to the right you will
  eventually arrive at Hooge. In either case you will wish you hadn't.</p>

  <p>Before the war these two roads&mdash;which join about two hundred yards
  east of the rampart walls of Ypres&mdash;were adorned with a fair number of
  houses. They were of that stucco type which one frequently sees in England
  spreading out along the roads that lead to a largish town. Generally there is
  one of unusually revolting aspect that stands proudly by itself a hundred
  yards or so from the common herd and enclosed in a stuccoesque wall. And
  there my knowledge of the type in England ends.</p>

  <p>In Belgium, however, my acquaintance with this sort of abode is extensive.
  In taking over a house in Flanders that stands unpleasantly near the Hun, the
  advertisement that there are three sitting, two bed, h. and c. laid on, with
  excellent onion patch, near railway and good golf-links, leaves one cold. The
  end-all and be-all of a house is its cellar. The more gloomy, and dark, and
  generally horrible the cellar, the higher that house ranks socially, and the
  more likely are you to find in it a general consuming his last hamper from
  Fortnum &amp; Mason by the light of a tallow dip. And this applies more
  especially to the Hooge road.</p>

  <p>Arrived at the fork, let us turn right-handed and proceed along the
  deserted road. A motor-car is not to be advised, as at this stage of the
  promenade one is in full sight of the German trenches. For about two or three
  hundred yards no houses screen you, and then comes a row of the stucco
  residences I have mentioned. Also at this point the road bends to the left.
  Here, out of sight, occasional men sun themselves in the heavily-scented air,
  what time they exchange a little playful badinage in a way common to Thomas
  Atkins. At least, that is what happened some time ago; now, of course, things
  may have changed in the garden city.</p>

  <p>And at this point really our journey is ended, though for interest we
  might continue for another quarter of a mile. The row of houses stops
  abruptly, and away in front stretches a long straight road. A few detached
  mansions of sorts, in their own grounds, flank it on each side. At length
  they cease, and in front lies the open country. The poplar-lined road
  disappears out of sight a mile ahead, where it tops a gentle slope. And half
  on this side of the rise, and half on the other, there are the remnants of
  the tit-bit of the whole bloody charnel-house of the Ypres salient&mdash;the
  remnants of the village of Hooge. A closer examination is not to be
  recommended. The place where you stand is known in the vernacular as Hell
  Fire Corner, and the Hun&mdash;who knows the range of that corner to the
  fraction of an inch&mdash;will quite possibly resent your presence even
  there. And shrapnel gives a nasty wound.</p>

  <p>Let us return and seek safety in a cellar. It is not what one would call a
  good-looking cellar; no priceless prints adorn the walls, no Turkey carpet
  receives your jaded feet. In one corner a portable gramophone with several
  records much the worse for wear reposes on an upturned biscuit-box, and lying
  on the floor, with due regard to space economy, are three or four of those
  excellent box-mattresses which form the all-in-all of the average small
  Belgian house. On top of them are laid some valises and blankets, and from
  the one in the corner the sweet music of the sleeper strikes softly on the
  ear. It is the senior subaltern, who has been rambling all the preceding
  night in Sanctuary Wood&mdash;the proud authors of our nomenclature in
  Flanders quite rightly possess the humour necessary for the production of
  official communiqués.</p>

  <p>In two chairs, smoking, are a couple of officers. One is a major of the
  Royal Engineers, and another, also a sapper, belongs to the gilded staff. The
  cellar is the temporary headquarters of a field company&mdash;office, mess,
  and bedroom rolled into one.</p>

  <p>"I'm devilish short-handed for the moment, Bill." The Major thoughtfully
  filled his pipe. "That last boy I got a week ago&mdash;a nice boy he was,
  too&mdash;was killed in Zouave Wood the day before yesterday, poor devil.
  Seymour was wounded three days ago, and there's only Brent, Johnson, and
  him"&mdash;he indicated the sleeper. "Johnson is useless, and
  Brent&mdash;&mdash;" He paused, and looked full at the Staff-captain. "Do you
  know Brent well, by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"I should jolly well think I did. Jim Brent is one of my greatest pals,
  Major."</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps you can tell me something I very much want to know. I have
  knocked about the place for a good many years, and I have rubbed shoulders,
  officially and unofficially, with more men than I care to remember. As a
  result, I think I may claim a fair knowledge of my fellow-beings. And
  Brent&mdash;well, he rather beats me."</p>

  <p>He paused as if at a loss for words, and looked in the direction of the
  sleeping subaltern. Reassured by the alarming noise proceeding from the
  corner, he seemed to make up his mind.</p>

  <p>"Has Brent had some very nasty knock lately&mdash;money, or a woman, or
  something?"</p>

  <p>The Staff-captain took his pipe from his mouth, and for some seconds
  stared at the floor. Then he asked quietly, "Why? What are you getting
  at?"</p>

  <p>"This is why, Bill. Brent is one of the most capable officers I have ever
  had. He's a man whose judgment, tact, and driving power are perfectly
  invaluable in a show of this sort&mdash;so invaluable, in fact"&mdash;he
  looked straight at his listener&mdash;"that his death would be a very real
  loss to the corps and the Service. He's one of those we can't replace,
  and&mdash;he's going all out to make us have to."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" The question expressed no surprise; the speaker seemed
  merely to be demanding confirmation of what he already knew.</p>

  <p>"Brent is deliberately trying to get killed. There is not a shadow of
  doubt about it in my mind. Do you know why?"</p>

  <p>The Staff-officer got up and strolled to a table on which were lying some
  illustrated weekly papers. "Have you last week's <i>Tatler</i>?" He turned
  over the leaves. "Yes&mdash;here it is." He handed the newspaper to the
  Major. "That is why."</p>

  <p>"<i>A charming portrait of Lady Kathleen Goring; who was last week married
  to that well-known sportsman and soldier Sir Richard Goring. She was, it will
  be remembered, very popular in London society as the beautiful Miss Kathleen
  Tubbs&mdash;the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Silas P. Tubbs, of Pittsburg,
  Pa.</i>"</p>

  <p>The Major put down the paper and looked at the Staff-captain; then
  suddenly he rose and hurled it into the corner. "Oh, damn these women," he
  exploded.</p>

  <p>"Amen," murmured the other, as, with a loud snort, the sleeper awoke.</p>

  <p>"Is anything th' matter?" he murmured, drowsily, only to relapse at once
  into unconsciousness.</p>

  <p>"Jim was practically engaged to her; and then, three months ago, without a
  word of explanation, she gave him the order of the boot, and got engaged to
  Goring." The Staff-captain spoke savagely. "A damn rotten woman, Major, and
  Jim's well out of it, if he only knew. Goring's a baronet, which is, of
  course, the reason why this excrescence of the house of Tubbs chucked Jim. As
  a matter of fact, Dick Goring's not a bad fellow&mdash;he deserves a better
  fate. But it fairly broke Jim up. He's not the sort of fellow who falls in
  love easily; this was his one and only real affair, and he took it bad. He
  told me at the time that he never intended to come back alive."</p>

  <p>"Damn it all!" The Major's voice was irritable. "Why, his knowledge of the
  lingo alone makes him invaluable."</p>

  <p>"Frankly, I've been expecting to hear of his death every day. He's not the
  type that says a thing of that sort without meaning it."</p>

  <p>A step sounded on the floor above. "Look out, here he is. You'll stop and
  have a bit of lunch, Bill?"</p>

  <p>As he spoke the light in the doorway was blocked out, and a man came
  uncertainly down the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Confound these cellars. One can't see a thing, coming in out of the
  daylight. Who's that? Halloa, Bill, old cock, 'ow's yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Just tottering, Jim. Where've you been?"</p>

  <p>"Wandered down to Vlamertinghe this morning early to see about some
  sandbags, and while I was there I met that flying wallah Petersen in the
  R.N.A.S. Do you remember him, Major? He was up here with an armoured car in
  May. He told me rather an interesting thing."</p>

  <p>"What's that, Jim?" The Major was attacking a brawn with gusto. "Sit down,
  Bill. Whisky and Perrier in that box over there."</p>

  <p>"He tells me the Huns have got six guns whose size he puts at about
  9-inch; guns, mark you, not howitzers&mdash;mounted on railway trucks at
  Tournai. From there they can be rushed by either branch of the line&mdash;the
  junction is just west&mdash;to wherever they are required."</p>

  <p>"My dear old boy," laughed Bill, as he sat down. "I don't know your friend
  Petersen, and I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that he is in all
  probability quite right. But the information seems to be about as much use as
  the fact that it is cold in Labrador."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," answered Brent, thoughtfully&mdash;"I wonder." He was
  rummaging through a pile of papers in the stationery box.</p>

  <p>The other two men looked at one another significantly. "What hare-brained
  scheme have you got in your mind now, Brent?" asked the Major.</p>

  <p>Brent came slowly across the cellar and sat down with a sheet of paper
  spread out on his knee. For a while he examined it in silence, comparing it
  with an ordnance map, and then he spoke. "It's brick, and the drop is sixty
  feet, according to this&mdash;with the depth of the water fifteen."</p>

  <p>"And the answer is a lemon. What on earth are you talking about, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"The railway bridge over the river before the line forks."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! My good fellow," cried the Major, irritably, "don't be absurd.
  Are you proposing to blow it up?" His tone was ponderously sarcastic.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly," answered the unperturbed Brent, "but something of the
  sort&mdash;if I can get permission."</p>

  <p>The two men laid down their knives and stared at him solemnly.</p>

  <p>"You are, I believe, a sapper officer," commenced the Major. "May I ask
  first how much gun-cotton you think will be necessary to blow up a railway
  bridge which gives a sixty-foot drop into water; second, how you propose to
  get it there; third, how you propose to get yourself there; and fourth, why
  do you talk such rot?"</p>

  <p>Jim Brent laughed and helped himself to whisky. "The answer to the first
  question is unknown at present, but inquiries of my secretary will be
  welcomed&mdash;probably about a thousand pounds. The answer to the second
  question is that I don't. The answer to the third is&mdash;somehow; and for
  the fourth question I must ask for notice."</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you driving at, Jim?" said the Staff-captain, puzzled.
  "If you don't get the stuff there, how the deuce are you going to blow up the
  bridge?"</p>

  <p>"You may take it from me, Bill, that I may be mad, but I never anticipated
  marching through German Belgium with a party of sappers and a G.S. wagon full
  of gun-cotton. Oh, no&mdash;it's a one-man show."</p>

  <p>"But," ejaculated the Major, "how the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Have you ever thought, sir," interrupted Brent, "what would be the result
  if, as a heavy train was passing over a bridge, you cut one rail just in
  front of the engine?"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" the Major again started to speak, and was again cut
  short.</p>

  <p>"The outside rail," continued Brent, "so that the tendency would be for
  the engine to go towards the parapet wall. And no iron girder to hold it
  up&mdash;merely a little brick wall"&mdash;he again referred to the paper on
  his knee&mdash;"three feet high and three bricks thick. No nasty parties of
  men carrying slabs of gun-cotton; just yourself&mdash;with one slab of
  gun-cotton in your pocket and one primer and one detonator&mdash;that and the
  psychological moment. Luck, of course, but when we dispense with the working
  party we lift it from the utterly impossible into the realm of the remotely
  possible. The odds are against success, I know; but&mdash;&mdash;" He
  shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"But how do you propose to get there, my dear chap?" asked the Major,
  peevishly. "The Germans have a rooted objection to English officers walking
  about behind their lines."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but they don't mind a Belgian peasant, do they? Dash it, they've
  played the game on us scores of times, Major&mdash;not perhaps the bridge
  idea, but espionage by men disguised behind our lines. I only propose doing
  the same, and perhaps going one better."</p>

  <p>"You haven't one chance in a hundred of getting through alive." The Major
  viciously stabbed a tongue.</p>

  <p>"That is&mdash;er&mdash;beside the point," answered Brent, shortly.</p>

  <p>"But how could you get through their lines to start with?" queried
  Bill.</p>

  <p>"There are ways, dearie, there are ways. Petersen is a man of much
  resource."</p>

  <p>"Of course, the whole idea is absolutely ridiculous." The Major snorted.
  "Once and for all, Brent, I won't hear of it. We're far too short of fellows
  as it is."</p>

  <p>And for a space the subject languished, though there was a look on Jim
  Brent's face which showed it was only for a space.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Now when a man of the type of Brent takes it badly over a
  woman, there is a strong probability of very considerable trouble at any
  time. When, in addition to that, it occurs in the middle of the bloodiest war
  of history, the probability becomes a certainty. That he should quite fail to
  see just what manner of woman the present Lady Goring was, was merely in the
  nature of the animal. He was&mdash;as far as women were concerned&mdash;of
  the genus fool. To him "the rag, and the bone, and the hank of hair" could
  never be anything but perfect. It is as well that there are men like
  that.</p>

  <p>All of which his major&mdash;who was a man of no little
  understanding&mdash;knew quite well. And the knowledge increased his
  irritation, for he realised the futility of trying to adjust things. That
  adjusting business is ticklish work even between two close pals; but when the
  would-be adjuster is very little more than a mere acquaintance, the chances
  of success might be put in a small-sized pill-box. To feel morally certain
  that your best officer is trying his hardest to get himself killed, and to be
  unable to prevent it, is an annoying state of affairs. Small wonder, then,
  that at intervals throughout the days that followed did the Major reiterate
  with solemnity and emphasis his remark to the Staff-captain anent women. It
  eased his feelings, if it did nothing else.</p>

  <p>The wild scheme Brent had half suggested did not trouble him greatly. He
  regarded it merely as a temporary aberration of the brain. In the South
  African war small parties of mounted sappers and cavalry had undoubtedly
  ridden far into hostile country, and, getting behind the enemy, had blown up
  bridges, and generally damaged their lines of communication. But in the South
  African war a line of trenches did not stretch from sea to sea.</p>

  <p>And so, seated one evening at the door of his commodious residence talking
  things over with his colonel, he did not lay any great stress on the bridge
  idea. Brent had not referred to it again; and in the cold light of reason it
  seemed too foolish to mention.</p>

  <p>"Of course," remarked the C.R.E., "he's bound to take it soon. No man can
  go on running the fool risks you say he does without stopping one. It's a
  pity; but, if he won't see by himself that he's a fool, I don't see what we
  can do to make it clear. If only that confounded girl&mdash;" He grunted and
  got up to go. "Halloa! What the devil is this fellow doing?"</p>

  <p>Shambling down the road towards them was a particularly decrepit and
  filthy specimen of the Belgian labourer. In normal circumstances, and in any
  other place, his appearance would have called for no especial comment; the
  brand is not a rare one. But for many months the salient of Ypres had been
  cleared of its civilian population; and this sudden appearance was not likely
  to pass unnoticed.</p>

  <p>"Venez, ici, monsieur, tout de suite." At the Major's words the old man
  stopped, and paused in hesitation; then he shuffled towards the two men.</p>

  <p>"Will you talk to him, Colonel?" The Major glanced at his senior
  officer.</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;I think not; my&mdash;er&mdash;French, don't you
  know&mdash;er&mdash;not what it was." The worthy officer retired in good
  order, only to be overwhelmed by a perfect deluge of words from the
  Belgian.</p>

  <p>"What's he say?" he queried, peevishly. "That damn Flemish sounds like a
  dog fight."</p>

  <p>"Parlez-vous Français, monsieur?" The Major attempted to stem the tide of
  the old man's verbosity, but he evidently had a grievance, and a Belgian with
  a grievance is not a thing to be regarded with a light heart.</p>

  <p>"Thank heavens, here's the interpreter!" The Colonel heaved a sigh of
  relief. "Ask this man what he's doing here, please."</p>

  <p>For a space the distant rattle of a machine-gun was drowned, and then the
  interpreter turned to the officers.</p>

  <p>"'E say, sare, that 'e has ten thousand franc behind the German line,
  buried in a 'ole, and 'e wants to know vat 'e shall do."</p>

  <p>"Do," laughed the Major. "What does he imagine he's likely to do? Go and
  dig it up? Tell him that he's got no business here at all."</p>

  <p>Again the interpreter spoke.</p>

  <p>"Shall I take 'im to Yper and 'and 'im to the gendarmes, sare?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bad idea," said the Colonel, "and have him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>What further order he was going to give is immaterial, for at that moment
  he looked at the Belgian, and from that villainous old ruffian he received
  the most obvious and unmistakable wink.</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;thank you, interpreter; I will send him later under a
  guard."</p>

  <p>The interpreter saluted and retired, the Major looked surprised, the
  Colonel regarded the Belgian with an amazed frown. Then suddenly the old
  villain spoke.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Colonel. Those Ypres gendarmes would have been a
  nuisance."</p>

  <p>"Great Scot!" gasped the Major. "What the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What the devil is the meaning of this masquerade, sir?" The Colonel was
  distinctly angry.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to see if I'd pass muster as a Belgian, sir. The interpreter was
  an invaluable proof."</p>

  <p>"You run a deuced good chance of being shot, Brent, in that rig. Anyway, I
  wish for an explanation as to why you're walking about in that get-up.
  Haven't you enough work to do?"</p>

  <p>"Shall we go inside, sir? I've got a favour to ask you."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">We are not very much concerned with the conversation that
  took place downstairs in that same cellar, when two senior officers of the
  corps of Royal Engineers listened for nearly an hour to an apparently
  disreputable old farmer. It might have been interesting to note how the
  sceptical grunts of those two officers gradually gave place to silence, and
  at length to a profound, breathless interest, as they pored over maps and
  plans. And the maps were all of that country which lies behind the German
  trenches.</p>

  <p>But at the end the old farmer straightened himself smartly.</p>

  <p>"That is the rough outline of my plan, sir. I think I can claim that I
  have reduced the risk of not getting to my objective to a minimum. When I get
  there I am sure that my knowledge of the patois renders the chance of
  detection small. As for the actual demolition itself, an enormous amount will
  depend on luck; but I can afford to wait. I shall have to be guided by local
  conditions. And so I ask you to let me go. It's a long odds chance, but if it
  comes off it's worth it."</p>

  <p>"And if it does, what then? What about you?" The Colonel's eyes and Jim
  Brent's met.</p>

  <p>"I shall have paid for my keep, Colonel, at any rate."</p>

  <p>Everything was very silent in the cellar; outside on the road a man was
  singing.</p>

  <p>"In other words, Jim, you're asking me to allow you to commit
  suicide."</p>

  <p>He cleared his throat; his voice seemed a little husky.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! sir&mdash;it's not as bad as that. Call it a forlorn hope, if
  you like, but..." The eyes of the two men met, and Brent fell silent.</p>

  <p>"Gad, my lad, you're a fool, but you're a brave fool! For Heaven's sake,
  give me a drink."</p>

  <p>"I may go, Colonel?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you may go&mdash;as far, that is, as I am concerned. There is the
  General Staff to get round first."</p>

  <p>But though the Colonel's voice was gruff, he seemed to have some
  difficulty in finding his glass.</p>

  <p>As far as is possible in human nature, Jim Brent, at the period when he
  gained his V.C. in a manner which made him the hero of the hour&mdash;one
  might almost say of the war&mdash;was, I believe, without fear. The blow he
  had received at the hands of the girl who meant all the world to him had
  rendered him utterly callous of his life. And it was no transitory feeling:
  the mood of an hour or a week. It was deeper than the ordinary misery of a
  man who has taken the knock from a woman, deeper and much less ostentatious.
  He seemed to view life with a contemptuous toleration that in any other man
  would have been the merest affectation. But it was not evinced by his words;
  it was shown, as his Major had said, by his deeds&mdash;deeds that could not
  be called bravado because he never advertised them. He was simply gambling
  with death, with a cool hand and a steady eye, and sublimely indifferent to
  whether he won or lost. Up to the time when he played his last great game he
  had borne a charmed life. According to the book of the words, he should have
  been killed a score of times, and he told me himself only last week that he
  went into this final gamble with a taunt on his lips and contempt in his
  heart. Knowing him as I do, I believe it. I can almost hear him saying to his
  grim opponent, "Dash it all! I've won every time; for Heaven's sake do
  something to justify your reputation."</p>

  <p>But&mdash;he didn't; Jim won again. And when he landed in England from a
  Dutch tramp, having carried out the maddest and most hazardous exploit of the
  war unscathed, he slipped up on a piece of orange-peel and broke his right
  leg in two places, which made him laugh so immoderately when the contrast
  struck him that it cured him&mdash;not his leg, but his mind. However, all in
  due course.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The first part of the story I heard from Petersen, of the
  Naval Air Service. I ran into him by accident in a grocer's shop in
  Hazebrouck&mdash;buying stuff for the mess.</p>

  <p>"What news of Jim?" he cried, the instant he saw me.</p>

  <p>"Very sketchy," I answered. "He's the worst letter-writer in the world.
  You know he trod on a bit of orange-peel and broke his leg when he got back
  to England."</p>

  <p>"He would." Petersen smiled. "That's just the sort of thing Jim would do.
  Men like him usually die of mumps, or the effects of a bad oyster."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," I murmured, catching him gently by the arm. "And now come to
  the pub over the way and tell me all about it. The beer there is of a less
  vile brand than usual."</p>

  <p>"But I can't tell you anything, my dear chap, that you don't know
  already!" he expostulated. "I am quite prepared to gargle with you,
  but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Deux bières, ma'm'selle, s'il vous plaît." I piloted Petersen firmly to a
  little table. "Tell me all, my son!" I cried. "For the purposes of this
  meeting I know nix, and you as part hero in the affair have got to get it off
  your chest."</p>

  <p>He laughed, and lit a cigarette. "Not much of the heroic in my part of the
  stunt, I assure you. As you know, the show started from Dunkirk, where in due
  course Jim arrived, armed with credentials extracted only after great
  persuasion from sceptical officers of high rank. How he ever got there at all
  has always been a wonder to me: his Colonel was the least of his difficulties
  in that line. But Jim takes a bit of stopping.</p>

  <p>"My part of the show was to transport that scatter-brained idiot over the
  trenches and drop him behind the German lines. His idea was novel, I must
  admit, though at the time I thought he was mad, and for that matter I still
  think he's mad. Only a madman could have thought of it, only Jim Brent could
  have done it and not been killed.</p>

  <p>"From a height of three thousand feet, in the middle of the night, he
  proposed to bid me and the plane a tender farewell and descend to terra firma
  by means of a parachute."</p>

  <p>"Great Scot," I murmured. "Some idea."</p>

  <p>"As you say&mdash;some idea. The thing was to choose a suitable night. As
  Jim said, 'the slow descent of a disreputable Belgian peasant like an angel
  out of the skies will cause a flutter of excitement in the tender heart of
  the Hun if it is perceived. Therefore, it must be a dark and overcast
  night.'</p>

  <p>"At last, after a week, we got an ideal one. Jim arrayed himself in his
  togs, took his basket on his arm&mdash;you know he'd hidden the gun-cotton in
  a cheese&mdash;and we went round to the machine. By Jove! that chap's a
  marvel. Think of it, man." Petersen's face was full of enthusiastic
  admiration. "He'd never even been up in an aeroplane before, and yet the
  first time he does, it is with the full intention of trusting himself to an
  infernal parachute, a thing the thought of which gives me cold feet;
  moreover, of doing it in the dark from a height of three thousand odd feet
  behind the German lines with his pockets full of detonators and other
  abominations, and his cheese full of gun-cotton. Lord! he's a marvel. And I
  give you my word that of the two of us&mdash;though I've flown for over two
  years&mdash;I was the shaky one. He was absolutely cool; not the coolness of
  a man who is keeping himself under control, but just the normal coolness of a
  man who is doing his everyday job."</p>

  <p>Petersen finished his beer at a gulp, and we encored the dose.</p>

  <p>"Well, we got off about two. We were not aiming at any specific spot, but
  I was going to go due east for three-quarters of an hour, which I estimated
  should bring us somewhere over Courtrai. Then he was going to drop off, and I
  was coming back. The time was chosen so that I should be able to land again
  at Dunkirk about dawn.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you much more. We escaped detection going over the lines,
  and about ten minutes to three, at a height of three thousand five hundred,
  old Jim tapped me on the shoulder. He understood exactly what to do&mdash;as
  far as we could tell him: for the parachute is still almost in its
  infancy.</p>

  <p>"As he had remarked to our wing commander before we started: 'A most
  valuable experiment, sir; I will report on how it works in due course.'</p>

  <p>"We shook hands. I could see him smiling through the darkness; and then,
  with his basket under his arm, that filthy old Belgian farmer launched
  himself into space.</p>

  <p>"I saw him for a second falling like a stone, and then the parachute
  seemed to open out all right. But of course I couldn't tell in the dark; and
  just afterwards I struck an air-pocket, and had a bit of trouble with the
  bus. After that I turned round and went home again. I'm looking forward to
  seeing the old boy and hearing what occurred."</p>

  <p>And that is the unvarnished account of the first part of Jim's last game
  with fate. Incidentally, it's the sort of thing that hardly requires any
  varnishing.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The rest of the yarn I heard later from Brent himself, when
  I went round to see him in hospital, while I was back on leave.</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake, lady, dear," he said to the sister as I arrived,
  "don't let anyone else in. Say I've had a relapse and am biting the
  bed-clothes. This unpleasant-looking man is a great pal of mine, and I would
  commune with him awhile."</p>

  <p>"It's appalling, old boy," he said to me as she went out of the room, "how
  they cluster. Men of dreadful visage; women who gave me my first bath;
  unprincipled journalists&mdash;all of them come and talk hot air until I get
  rid of them by swooning. My young sister brought thirty-four school friends
  round last Tuesday! Of course, my swoon is entirely artificial; but the
  sister is an understanding soul, and shoos them away." He lit a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I saw Petersen the other day in Hazebrouck," I told him as I sat down by
  the bed. "He wants to come round and see you as soon as he can get home."</p>

  <p>"Good old Petersen. I'd never have brought it off without him."</p>

  <p>"What happened, Jim?" I asked. "I've got up to the moment when you left
  his bus, with your old parachute, and disappeared into space. And of course
  I've seen the official announcement of the guns being seen in the river, as
  reported by that R.F.C. man. But there is a gap of about three weeks; and I
  notice you have not been over-communicative to the half-penny press."</p>

  <p>"My dear old man," he answered, seriously, "there was nothing to be
  communicative about. Thinking it over now, I am astounded how simple the
  whole thing was. It was as easy as falling off a log. I fell like a stone for
  two or three seconds, because the blessed umbrella wouldn't open. Then I
  slowed up and floated gently downwards. It was a most fascinating sensation.
  I heard old Petersen crashing about just above me; and in the distance a
  search-light was moving backwards and forwards across the sky, evidently
  looking for him. I should say it took me about five minutes to come down; and
  of course all the way down I was wondering where the devil I was going to
  land. The country below me was black as pitch: not a light to be
  seen&mdash;not a camp-fire&mdash;nothing. As the two things I wanted most to
  avoid were church steeples and the temporary abode of any large number of
  Huns, everything looked very favourable. To be suspended by one's trousers
  from a weathercock in the cold, grey light of dawn seemed a sorry ending to
  the show; and to land from the skies on a general's stomach requires
  explanation."</p>

  <p>He smiled reminiscently. "I'm not likely to forget that descent,
  Petersen's engine getting fainter and fainter in the distance, the first pale
  streaks of light beginning to show in the east, and away on a road to the
  south the headlamps of a car moving swiftly along. Then the humour of the
  show struck me. Me, in my most picturesque disguise, odoriferous as a family
  of ferrets in my borrowed garments, descending gently on to the Hun like the
  fairy god-mother in a pantomime. So I laughed, and&mdash;wished I hadn't. My
  knees hit my jaw with a crack, and I very nearly bit my tongue in two.
  Cheeses all over the place, and there I was enveloped in the folds of the
  collapsing parachute. Funny, but for a moment I couldn't think what had
  happened. I suppose I was a bit dizzy from the shock, and it never occurred
  to me that I'd reached the ground, which, not being able to see in the dark,
  I hadn't known was so close. Otherwise I could have landed much lighter. Yes,
  it's a great machine that parachute." He paused to reach for his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Where did you land?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"In the middle of a ploughed field. Couldn't have been a better place if
  I'd chosen it. A wood or a river would have been deuced awkward. Yes, there's
  no doubt about it, old man, my luck was in from the very start. I removed
  myself from the folds, picked up my cheeses, found a convenient ditch
  alongside to hide the umbrella in, and then sat tight waiting for dawn.</p>

  <p>"I happen to know that part of Belgium pretty well, and when it got light
  I took my bearings. Petersen had borne a little south of what we intended,
  which was all to the good&mdash;it gave me less walking; but it was just as
  well I found a sign-post almost at once, as I had no map, of course&mdash;far
  too dangerous; and I wasn't very clear on names of villages, though I'd
  memorized the map before leaving. I found I had landed somewhere south of
  Courtrai, and was about twelve kilometres due north of Tournai.</p>

  <p>"And it was just as I'd decided that little fact that I met a horrible
  Hun, a large and forbidding-looking man. Now, the one thing on which I'd been
  chancing my arm was the freedom allowed to the Belgians behind the German
  lines, and luck again stepped in.</p>

  <p>"Beyond grunting 'Guten Morgen' he betrayed no interest in me whatever. It
  was the same all along. I shambled past Uhlans, and officers and generals in
  motor-cars&mdash;Huns of all breeds and all varieties, and no one even
  noticed me. And after all, why on earth should they?</p>

  <p>"About midday I came to Tournai; and here again I was trusting to luck.
  I'd stopped there three years ago at a small estaminet near the station kept
  by the widow Demassiet. Now this old lady was, I knew, thoroughly French in
  sympathies; and I hoped that, in case of necessity, she would pass me off as
  her brother from Ghent, who was staying with her for a while. Some retreat of
  this sort was, of course, essential. A homeless vagabond would be bound to
  excite suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Dear old woman&mdash;she was splendid. After the war I shall search her
  out, and present her with an annuity, or a belle vache, or something dear to
  the Belgian heart. She never even hesitated. From that night I was her
  brother, though she knew it meant her death as well as mine if I was
  discovered.</p>

  <p>"'Ah, monsieur,' she said, when I pointed this out to her, 'it is in the
  hands of le bon Dieu. At the most I have another five years, and these
  Allemands&mdash;pah!' She spat with great accuracy.</p>

  <p>"She was good, was the old veuve Demassiet."</p>

  <p>Jim puffed steadily at his pipe in silence for a few moments.</p>

  <p>"I soon found out that the Germans frequented the estaminet; and, what was
  more to the point&mdash;luck again, mark you&mdash;that the gunners who ran
  the battery I was out after almost lived there. When the battery was at
  Tournai they had mighty little to do, and they did it, with some skill, round
  the beer in her big room.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know what my plan was. The next time that battery left
  Tournai I proposed to cut one of the metals on the bridge over the River
  Scheldt, just in front of the engine, so close that the driver couldn't stop,
  and so derail the locomotive. I calculated that if I cut the outside
  rail&mdash;the one nearest the parapet wall&mdash;the flange on the inner
  wheel would prevent the engine turning inwards. That would merely cause
  delay, but very possibly no more. I hoped, on the contrary, to turn it
  outwards towards the wall, through which it would crash, dragging after it
  with any luck the whole train of guns.</p>

  <p>"That being the general idea, so to speak, I wandered off one day to see
  the bridge. As I expected, it was guarded, but by somewhat
  indifferent-looking Huns&mdash;evidently only lines of communication troops.
  For all that, I hadn't an idea how I was going to do it. Still, luck, always
  luck; the more you buffet her the better she treats you.</p>

  <p>"One week after I got there I heard the battery was going out: and they
  were going out that night. As a matter of fact, that hadn't occurred to me
  before&mdash;the fact of them moving by night, but it suited me down to the
  ground. It appeared they were timed to leave at midnight, which meant they'd
  cross the bridge about a quarter or half past. And so at nine that evening I
  pushed gently off and wandered bridgewards.</p>

  <p>"Then the fun began. I was challenged, and, having answered thickly, I
  pretended to be drunk. The sentry, poor devil, wasn't a bad fellow, and I had
  some cold sausage and beer. And very soon a gurgling noise pronounced the
  fact that he found my beer good.</p>

  <p>"It was then I hit him on the base of his skull with a bit of gas-pipe.
  That sentry will never drink beer again." Brent frowned. "A nasty blow, a
  dirty blow, but a necessary blow." He shrugged his shoulders and then went
  on.</p>

  <p>"I took off his top-coat and put it on. I put on his hat and took his
  rifle and rolled him down the embankment into a bush. Then I resumed his
  beat. Discipline was a bit lax on that bridge, I'm glad to say; unless you
  pulled your relief out of bed no one else was likely to do it for you. As you
  may guess, I did not do much pulling.</p>

  <p>"I was using two slabs of gun-cotton to make sure&mdash;firing them
  electrically. I had two dry-cells and two coils of fine wire for the leads.
  The cells would fire a No. 13 Detonator through thirty yards of those
  leads&mdash;and that thirty yards just enabled me to stand clear of the
  bridge. It took me twenty minutes to fix it up, and then I had to wait.</p>

  <p>"By gad, old boy, you've called me a cool bird; you should have seen me
  during that wait. I was trembling like a child with excitement: everything
  had gone so marvellously. And for the first time in the whole show it dawned
  on me that not only was there a chance of getting away afterwards, but that I
  actually wanted to. Before that moment I'd assumed on the certainty of being
  killed."</p>

  <p>For a moment he looked curiously in front of him, and a slight smile
  lurked round the corners of his mouth. Then suddenly, and apropos of nothing,
  he remarked, "Kathleen Goring tea'd with me yesterday. Of course, it was
  largely due to that damned orange-skin, but I&mdash;er&mdash;did not pass a
  sleepless night."</p>

  <p>Which I took to be indicative of a state of mind induced by the rind of
  that nutritious fruit, rather than any reference to his broken leg. For when
  a man has passed unscathed through parachute descents and little things like
  that, only to lose badly on points to a piece of peel, his sense of humour
  gets a jog in a crucial place. And a sense of humour is fatal to the
  hopeless, undying passion. It is almost as fatal, in fact, as a hiccough at
  the wrong moment.</p>

  <p>"It was just about half-past twelve that the train came along. I was
  standing by the end of the bridge, with my overcoat and rifle showing in the
  faint light of the moon. The engine-driver waved his arm and shouted
  something in greeting and I waved back. Then I took the one free lead and
  waited until the engine was past me. I could see the first of the guns, just
  coming abreast, and at that moment I connected up with the battery in my
  pocket. Two slabs of gun-cotton make a noise, as you know, and just as the
  engine reached the charge, a sheet of flame seemed to leap from underneath
  the front wheels. The driver hadn't time to do a thing&mdash;the engine had
  left the rails before he knew what had happened. And then things moved. In my
  wildest moments I had never expected such a success. The engine crashed
  through the parapet wall and hung for a moment in space. Then it fell
  downward into the water, and by the mercy of Allah the couplings held. The
  first two guns followed it, through the gap it had made, and then the others
  overturned with the pull before they got there, smashing down the wall the
  whole way along. Every single gun went wallop into the Scheldt&mdash;to say
  nothing of two passenger carriages containing the gunners and their officers.
  The whole thing was over in five seconds; and you can put your shirt on it
  that before the last gun hit the water yours truly had cast away his regalia
  of office and was legging it like a two-year-old back to the veuve Demassiet
  and Tournai. It struck me that bridge might shortly become an unhealthy
  spot."</p>

  <p>Jim Brent laughed. "It did. I had to stop on with the old lady for two or
  three days in case she might be suspected owing to my sudden
  departure&mdash;and things hummed. They shot the feldwebel in charge of the
  guard; they shot every sentry; they shot everybody they could think of;
  but&mdash;they never even suspected me. I went out and had a look next day,
  the day I think that R.F.C. man spotted and reported the damage. Two of the
  guns were only fit for turning into hairpins, and the other four looked very
  like the morning after.</p>

  <p>"Then, after I'd waited a couple of days, I said good-bye to the old dear
  and trekked off towards the Dutch frontier, gaining immense popularity, old
  son, by describing the accident to all the soldiers I met.</p>

  <p>"That's all, I think. I had words with a sentry at the frontier, but I put
  it across him with his own bundook. Then I wandered to our Ambassador, and
  sailed for England in due course. And&mdash;er&mdash;that's that."</p>

  <p>Such is the tale of Jim Brent's V.C. There only remains for me to give the
  wording of his official report on the matter.</p>

  <p>"I have the honour to report," it ran, "that at midnight on the 25th ult.,
  I successfully derailed the train conveying six guns of calibre estimated at
  about 9-inch, each mounted on a railway truck. The engine, followed by the
  guns, departed from sight in about five seconds, and fell through a drop of
  some sixty feet into the River Scheldt from the bridge just west of Tournai.
  The gunners and officers&mdash;who were in two coaches in rear&mdash;were
  also killed. Only one seemed aware that there was danger, and he, owing to
  his bulk, was unable to get out of the door of his carriage. He was, I think,
  in command. I investigated the damage next day when the military authorities
  were a little calmer, and beg to state that I do not consider the guns have
  been improved by their immersion. One, at least, has disappeared in the mud.
  A large number of Germans who had no connection with this affair have, I am
  glad to report, since been shot for it.</p>

  <p>"I regret that I am unable to report in person, but I am at present in
  hospital with a broken leg, sustained by my inadvertently stepping on a piece
  of orange-peel, which escaped my notice owing to its remarkable similarity to
  the surrounding terrain. This similarity was doubtless due to the dirt on the
  orange-peel."</p>

  <h2><a name="story2"
     id="story2"></a>II. &mdash; THE FATAL SECOND</h2>

  <h3>Previously published in <i>Men, Women and Guns</i></h3>

  <p class="first">IT was in July of 1914&mdash;on the Saturday of Henley Week.
  People who were there may remember that, for once in a way, our fickle
  climate was pleased to smile upon us.</p>

  <p>Underneath the wall of Phyllis Court a punt was tied up. The prizes had
  been given away, and the tightly packed boats surged slowly up and down the
  river, freed at last from the extreme boredom of watching crews they did not
  know falling exhausted out of their boats. In the punt of which I speak were
  three men and a girl. One of the men was myself, who have no part in this
  episode, save the humble one of narrator. The other three were the
  principals; I would have you make their acquaintance. I would hurriedly say
  that it is not the old, old story of a woman and two men, for one of the men
  was her brother.</p>

  <p>To begin with&mdash;the girl. Pat Delawnay&mdash;she was always called
  Pat, as she didn't look like a Patricia&mdash;was her name, and she
  was&mdash;well, here I give in. I don't know the colour of her eyes, nor can
  I say with any certainty the colour of her hair; all I know is that she
  looked as if the sun had come from heaven and kissed her, and had then gone
  back again satisfied with his work. She was a girl whom to know was to
  love&mdash;the dearest, most understanding soul in God's whole earth. I'd
  loved her myself since I was out of petticoats.</p>

  <p>Then there was Jack Delawnay, her brother. Two years younger he was, and
  between the two of them there was an affection and love which is frequently
  conspicuous by its absence between brother and sister. He was a cheery
  youngster, a good-looking boy, and fellows in the regiment liked him. He rode
  straight, and he had the money to keep good cattle. In addition, the men
  loved him, and that means a lot when you size up an officer.</p>

  <p>And then there was the other. Older by ten years than the boy&mdash;the
  same age as myself&mdash;Jerry Dixon was my greatest friend. We had fought
  together at school, played the ass together at Sandhurst, and entered the
  regiment on the same day. He had "A" company and I had "C," and the boy was
  one of his subalterns. Perhaps I am biassed, but to me Jerry Dixon had one of
  the finest characters I have ever seen in any man. He was no Galahad, no
  prig; he was just a man, a white man. He had that cheerily ugly face which is
  one of the greatest gifts a man can have, and he also had Pat as his fiancée,
  which was another.</p>

  <p>My name is immaterial, but everyone calls me Winkle, owing
  to&mdash;&mdash; Well, some day I may tell you.</p>

  <p>The regiment, our regiment, was the, let us call it the Downshires.</p>

  <p>We had come over from Aldershot and were week-ending at the Delawnays'
  place&mdash;they always took one on the river for Henley. At the moment Jerry
  was holding forth, quite unmoved by exhortations to "Get out and get under"
  bawled in his ears by blackened gentlemen of doubtful voice and undoubted
  inebriation.</p>

  <p>As I write, the peculiar&mdash;the almost sinister&mdash;nature of his
  conversation, in the light of future events, seems nothing short of
  diabolical. And yet at the time we were just three white-flannelled men and a
  girl with a great floppy hat lazing over tea in a punt. How the gods must
  have laughed!</p>

  <p>"My dear old Winkle"&mdash;he was lighting a cigarette as he
  spoke&mdash;"you don't realise the deeper side of soldiering at all. The
  subtle nuances (French, Pat, in case my accent is faulty) are completely lost
  upon you."</p>

  <p>I remember smiling to myself as I heard Jerry getting warmed up to his
  subject, and then my attention wandered, and I dozed off. I had heard it all
  before so often from the dear old boy. We always used to chaff him about it
  in the mess. I can see him now, after dinner, standing with his back to the
  ante-room fire, a whisky-and-soda in his hand and a dirty old pipe between
  his teeth.</p>

  <p>"It's all very well for you fellows to laugh," he would say, "but I'm
  right for all that. It is absolutely essential to think out beforehand what
  one would do in certain exceptional eventualities, so that when that
  eventuality does arise you won't waste any time, but will automatically do
  the right thing."</p>

  <p>And then the adjutant recalled in a still small voice how he first
  realised the orderly-room sergeant's baby was going to be sick in his arms at
  the regiment's Christmas-tree festivities, and, instead of throwing it on the
  floor, he had clung to it for that fatal second of indecision. As he
  admitted, it was certainly not one of the things he had thought out
  beforehand.</p>

  <p>He's gone, too, has old Bellairs the adjutant. I wonder how many fellows
  I'll know when I get back to them next week? But I'm wandering.</p>

  <p>"Winkle, wake up!" It was Pat speaking. "Jerry is being horribly serious,
  and I'm not at all certain it will be safe to marry him; he'll be
  experimenting on me."</p>

  <p>"What's he been saying?" I murmured sleepily.</p>

  <p>"He's been thinking what he'd do," laughed Jack, "if the stout female
  personage in yonder small canoe overbalanced and fell in. There'll be no
  fatal second then, Jerry, my boy. It'll be a minute even if I have to hold
  you. You'd never be able to look your friends in the face again if you didn't
  let her drown."</p>

  <p>"Ass!" grunted Jerry. "No, Winkle, I was just thinking, amongst other
  things, of what might very easily happen to any of us three here, and what
  did happen to old Grantley in South Africa." Grantley was one of our majors.
  "He told me all about it one day in one of his expansive moods. It was during
  a bit of a scrap just before Paardeburg, and he had some crowd of irregular
  Johnnies. He was told off to take a position, and apparently it was a fairly
  warm proposition. However, it was perfectly feasible if only the men stuck
  it. Well, they didn't, but they would have except for his momentary
  indecision. He told me that there came a moment in the advance when one man
  wavered. He knew it and felt it all through him. He saw the man&mdash;he
  almost saw the deadly contagion spreading from that one man to the
  others&mdash;and he hesitated and was lost. When he sprang forward and tried
  to hold 'em, he failed. The fear was on them, and they broke. He told me he
  regarded himself as every bit as much to blame as the man who first gave
  out."</p>

  <p>"But what could he have done, Jerry?" asked Pat.</p>

  <p>"Shot him, dear&mdash;shot him on the spot without a second's
  thought&mdash;killed the origin of the fear before it had time to spread. I
  venture to say that there are not many fellows in the Service who would do
  it&mdash;without thinking: and you can't think&mdash;you dare not, even if
  there was time. It goes against the grain, especially if you know the man
  well, and it's only by continually rehearsing the scene in your mind that
  you'd be able to do it."</p>

  <p>We were all listening to him now, for this was a new development I'd never
  heard before.</p>

  <p>"Just imagine the far-reaching results one coward&mdash;no, not coward,
  possibly&mdash;but one man who has reached the breaking-point, may have.
  Think of it, Winkle. A long line stretched out, attacking. One man in the
  centre wavers, stops. Spreading outwards, the thing rushes like lightning,
  because, after all, fear is only an emotion, like joy and sorrow, and one
  knows how quickly they will communicate themselves to other people. Also, in
  such a moment as an attack, men are particularly susceptible to emotions. All
  that is primitive is uppermost, and their reasoning powers are more or less
  in abeyance."</p>

  <p>"But the awful thing, Jerry," said Pat quietly, "is that you would never
  know whether it had been necessary or not. It might not have spread; he might
  have answered to your voice&mdash;oh! a thousand things might have
  happened."</p>

  <p>"It's not worth the risk, dear. One man's life is not worth the risk. It's
  a risk you just dare not take. It may mean everything&mdash;it may mean
  failure&mdash;it may mean disgrace." He paused and looked steadily across the
  shifting scene of gaiety and colour, while a long bamboo pole with a little
  bag on the end, wielded by some passing vocalist, was thrust towards him
  unheeded. Then with a short laugh he pulled himself together, and lit a
  cigarette. "But enough of dull care. Let us away, and gaze upon beautiful
  women and brave men. What's that little tune they're playing?"</p>

  <p>"That's that waltz&mdash;what the deuce is the name, Pat?" asked Jack,
  untying the punt.</p>

  <p>"'Destiny,'" answered Pat briefly, and we passed out into the stream.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A month afterwards we three were again at Henley, not in
  flannels in a punt on the river, but in khaki, with a motor waiting at the
  door of the Delawnays' house to take us back to Aldershot. I do not propose
  to dwell over the scene, but in the setting down of the story it cannot be
  left out. Europe was at war; the long-expected by those scoffed-at alarmists
  had actually come. England and Germany were at each other's throats.</p>

  <p>Inside the house Jack was with his mother. Personally, I was standing in
  the garden with the grey-haired father; and Jerry was&mdash;well, where else
  could he have been?</p>

  <p>As is the way with men, we discussed the roses, and the rascality of the
  Germans, and everything except what was in our hearts. And in one of the
  pauses in our spasmodic conversation we heard her voice, just over the
  hedge:</p>

  <p>"God guard and keep you, my man, and bring you back to me safe!" And the
  voice was steady, though one could feel those dear eyes dim with tears.</p>

  <p>And then Jerry's, dear old Jerry's voice&mdash;a little bit gruff it was,
  and a little bit shaky: "My love! My darling!"</p>

  <p>But the old man was going towards the house, blowing his nose; and
  I&mdash;don't hold with love and that sort of thing at all. True, I blundered
  into a flower-bed, which I didn't see clearly, as I went towards the car, for
  there are things which one may not hear and remain unmoved. Perhaps, if
  things had been different, and Jerry&mdash;dear old
  Jerry&mdash;hadn't&mdash;&mdash; But there, I'm wandering again.</p>

  <p>At last we were in the car and ready to start.</p>

  <p>"Take care of him, Jerry; he and Pat are all we've got." It was Mrs.
  Delawnay speaking, standing there with the setting sun on her sweet face and
  her husband's arm about her.</p>

  <p>"I'll be all right, mater," answered Jack gruffly. "Buck up! Back for
  Christmas!"</p>

  <p>"I'll look after him, Mrs. Delawnay," answered Jerry, but his eyes were
  fixed on Pat, and for him the world held only her.</p>

  <p>As the car swung out of the gate, we looked back the last time and
  saluted, and it was only I who saw through a break in the hedge two women
  locked in each other's arms, while a grey-haired gentleman sat very still on
  a garden-seat, with his eyes fixed on the river rolling smoothly by.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was on the Aisne I took it. Through that ghastly fourteen
  days we had slogged dully south away from Mons, ever getting nearer Paris.
  Through the choking dust, with the men staggering as they walked&mdash;some
  asleep, some babbling, some cursing&mdash;but always marching, marching,
  marching; digging at night, only to leave the trenches in two hours and march
  on again; with ever and anon a battery of horse tearing past at a gallop,
  with the drivers lolling drunkenly in their saddles, and the guns jolting and
  swaying behind the straining, sweating horses, to come into action on some
  ridge still further south, and try to check von Kluck's hordes, if only for a
  little space. Every bridge in the hands of anxious-faced sapper officers,
  prepared for demolition one and all, but not to be blown up till all our
  troops were across. Ticklish work, for should there be a fault, there is not
  much time to repair it.</p>

  <p>But at last it was over, and we turned North. A few days later, in the
  afternoon, my company crossed a pontoon bridge on the Aisne, and two hours
  afterwards we dug ourselves in a mile and a half beyond it. The next morning,
  as I was sitting in one of the trenches, there was a sudden, blinding
  roar&mdash;and oblivion.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I will pass rapidly over the next six weeks&mdash;over my
  journey from the clearing hospital to the base at Havre, of my voyage back to
  England in a hospital ship, and my ultimate arrival at Drayton Hall, the
  Delawnays' place in Somerset, where I had gone to convalesce.</p>

  <p>During the time various fragments of iron were being picked from me and
  the first shock of the concussion was wearing off, we had handed over our
  trenches on the Aisne to the French, and moved north to Flanders.</p>

  <p>Occasional scrawls came through from Jack and Jerry, but the people in
  England who had any knowledge at all of the fighting and of what was going
  on, grew to dread with an awful dread the sight of the telegraph-boy, and it
  required an effort of will to look at those prosaic casualty lists in the
  morning papers.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly without warning, as such news always does, it came. The War
  Office, in the shape of a whistling telegraph-boy, regretted to inform Mr.
  Delawnay that his son, Lieutenant Jack Delawnay of the Royal Downshire
  Regiment, had been killed in action.</p>

  <p>Had it been possible during the terrible days after the news came, I would
  have gone away, but I was still too weak to move; and I like to think that,
  perhaps, my presence there was some comfort to them, as a sort of connection
  through the regiment with their dead boy. After the first numbing shock, the
  old man bore it grandly.</p>

  <p>"He was all I had," he said to me one day as I lay in bed, "but I give him
  gladly for his country's sake." He stood looking at the broad fields. "All
  his," he muttered; "all would have been the dear lad's&mdash;and now six
  inches of soil and a wooden cross, perhaps not that."</p>

  <p>And Pat, poor little Pat, used to come up every day and sit with me,
  sometimes in silence, with her great eyes fixed on the fire, sometimes
  reading the paper, because my eyes weren't quite right yet.</p>

  <p>For about a fortnight after the news we did not think it strange; but
  then, as day by day went by, the same fear formulated in both our minds. I
  would have died sooner than whisper it; but one afternoon I found her eyes
  fixed on mine. We had been silent for some time, and suddenly in the
  firelight I saw the awful fear in her mind as clearly as if she had spoken
  it.</p>

  <p>"You're thinking it too, Winkle," she whispered, leaning forward. "Why
  hasn't he written? Why hasn't Jerry written one line? Oh, my God! don't say
  that <i>he</i> has been&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush, dear!" I said quietly. "His people would have let you know if they
  had had a wire."</p>

  <p>"But, Winkle, the Colonel has written that Jack died while gallantly
  leading a counter attack to recover lost trenches. Surely, Jerry would have
  found time for a line, unless something had happened to him; Jack was
  actually in his company."</p>

  <p>All of which I knew, but could not answer.</p>

  <p>"Besides," she went on after a moment, "you know how dad is longing for
  details. He wants to know everything about Jack, and so do we all. But oh,
  Winkle! I want to know if my man is all right. Brother and lover&mdash;not
  both, oh, God&mdash;not both!" The choking little sobs wrung my heart.</p>

  <p>The next day we got a wire from him. He was wounded slightly in the arm,
  and was at home. He was coming to us. Just that&mdash;no more. But, oh! the
  difference to the girl. Everything explained, everything clear, and the next
  day Jerry would be with her. Only as I lay awake that night thinking, and the
  events of the last three weeks passed through my mind, the same thought
  returned with maddening persistency. Slightly wounded in the arm, evidently
  recently as there was no mention in the casualty list, and for three weeks no
  line, no word. And then I cursed myself as an ass and a querulous
  invalid.</p>

  <p>At three o'clock he arrived, and they all came up to my room. The first
  thing that struck me like a blow was that it was his left arm which was
  hit&mdash;and the next was his face. Whether Pat had noticed that his writing
  arm was unhurt, I know not; but she had seen the look in his eyes, and was
  afraid.</p>

  <p>Then he told the story, and his voice was as the voice of the dead. Told
  the anxious, eager father and mother the story of their boy's heroism. How,
  having lost some trenches, the regiment made a counter attack to regain them.
  How first of them all was Jack, the men following him, as they always did,
  until a shot took him clean through the heart, and he dropped, leaving the
  regiment to surge over him for the last forty yards, and carry out gloriously
  what they had been going to do.</p>

  <p>And then the old man, pulling out the letter from the Colonel, and trying
  to read it through his blinding tears: "He did well, my boy," he whispered,
  "he did well, and died well. But, Jerry, the Colonel says in his letter," and
  he wiped his eyes and tried to read, "he says in his letter that Jack must
  have been right into their trenches almost, as he was killed at point-blank
  range with a revolver. One of those swine of German officers, I suppose." He
  shook his fist in the air. "Still he was but doing his duty. I must not
  complain. But you say he was forty yards away?"</p>

  <p>"It's difficult to say, sir, in the dark," answered Jerry, still in the
  voice of an automatic machine. "It may have been less than forty."</p>

  <p>And then he told them all over again; and while they, the two old dears,
  whispered and cried together, never noticing anything amiss, being only
  concerned with the telling, and caring no whit for the method thereof, Pat
  sat silently in the window, gazing at him with tearless eyes, with the wonder
  and amazement of her soul writ clear on her face for all to see. And
  I&mdash;I lay motionless in bed, and there was something I could not
  understand, for he would not look at me, nor yet at her, but kept his eyes
  fixed on the fire, while he talked like a child repeating a lesson.</p>

  <p>At last it was over; their last questions were asked, and slowly,
  arm-in-arm, they left the room, to dwell alone upon the story of their
  idolised boy. And in the room the silence was only broken by the crackling of
  the logs.</p>

  <p>How long we sat there I know not, with the firelight flickering on the
  stern set face of the man in the chair. He seemed unconscious of our
  existence, and we two dared not speak to him, we who loved him best, for
  there was something we could not understand. Suddenly he got up, and held out
  his arms to Pat. And when she crept into them, he kissed her, straining her
  close, as if he could never stop. Then, without a word, he led her to the
  door, and, putting her gently through, shut it behind her. Still without a
  word he came back to the chair, and turned it so that the firelight no longer
  played on his face. And then he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I have a story to tell you, Winkle, which I venture to think will
  entertain you for a time." His voice was the most terrible thing I have ever
  listened to..."Nearly four weeks ago the battalion was in the trenches a bit
  south of Ypres. It was bad in the retreat, as you know; it was bad on the
  Aisne; but they were neither of them in the same county as the doing we had
  up north. One night&mdash;they'd shelled us off and on for three days and
  three nights&mdash;we were driven out of our trenches. The regiment on our
  right gave, and we had to go too. The next morning we were ordered to counter
  attack, and get back the ground we had lost. It was the attack in which we
  lost so heavily."</p>

  <p>He stopped speaking for a while, and I did not interrupt.</p>

  <p>"When I got that order overnight Jack was with me, in a hole that passed
  as a dugout. At the moment everything was quiet; the Germans were patching up
  their new position; only a maxim spluttered away a bit to one flank. To add
  to the general desolation a steady downpour of rain drenched us, into which,
  without cessation the German flares went shooting up. I think they were
  expecting a counter attack at once..."</p>

  <p>Again he paused, and I waited.</p>

  <p>"You know the condition one gets into sometimes when one is heavy for
  sleep. We had it during the retreat if you remember&mdash;a sort of coma, the
  outcome of utter bodily exhaustion. One used to go on walking, and all the
  while one was asleep&mdash;or practically so. Sounds came to us dimly as from
  a great distance; they made no impression on us&mdash;they were just a
  jumbled phantasmagoria of outside matters, which failed to reach one's brain,
  except as a dim dream. I was in that condition on the night I am speaking of;
  I was utterly cooked&mdash;beat to the world; I was finished for the time.
  I've told you this, because I want you to understand the physical condition I
  was in."</p>

  <p>He leaned forward and stared at the fire, resting his head on his
  hands.</p>

  <p>"How long I'd dozed heavily in that wet-sodden hole I don't know, but
  after a while above the crackle of the maxim, separate and distinct from the
  soft splash of the rain, and the hiss of the flares, and the hundred and one
  other noises that came dimly to me out of the night, I heard Jack's
  voice&mdash;at least I think it was Jack's voice."</p>

  <p>Of a sudden he sat up in the chair, and rising quickly he came and leant
  over the foot of the bed.</p>

  <p>"Devil take it," he cried bitterly, "I know it was Jack's
  voice&mdash;<i>now</i>. I knew it the next day when it was too late. What he
  said exactly I shall never know&mdash;at the time it made no impression on
  me; but at this moment, almost like a spirit voice in my brain, I can hear
  him. I can hear him asking me to watch him. I can hear him pleading&mdash;I
  can hear his dreadful fear of being found afraid. As a whisper from a great
  distance I can hear one short sentence&mdash;'Jerry, my God, Jerry&mdash;I'm
  frightened!'</p>

  <p>"Winkle, he turned to me in his weakness&mdash;that boy who had never
  failed before, that boy who had reached the breaking-point&mdash;and I heeded
  him not. I was too dead beat; my brain couldn't grasp it."</p>

  <p>"But, Jerry," I cried, "it turned out all right the next day; he..." The
  words died away on my lips as I met the look in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You'd better let me finish," he interrupted wearily. "Let me get the
  whole hideous tragedy off my mind for the first and the last time. Early next
  morning we attacked. In the dim dirty light of dawn I saw the boy's face as
  he moved off to his platoon; and even then I didn't remember those halting
  sentences that had come to me out of the night. So instead of ordering him to
  the rear on some pretext or other as I should have done, I let him go to his
  platoon.</p>

  <p>"As we went across the ground that morning through a fire like nothing I
  had ever imagined, a man wavered in front of me. I felt it clean through me.
  I knew fear had come. I shouted and cheered&mdash;but the wavering was
  spreading; I knew that too. So I shot him through the heart from behind at
  point-blank range as I had trained myself to do&mdash;in that eternity
  ago&mdash;before the war. The counter attack was successful."</p>

  <p>"Great Heavens, Jerry!" I muttered, "who did you shoot?" though I knew the
  answer already.</p>

  <p>"The man I shot was Jack Delawnay. Whether at the time I was actively
  conscious of it, I cannot say. Certainly my training enabled me to act before
  any glimmering of the aftermath came into my mind. <i>This</i> is the
  aftermath."</p>

  <p>I shuddered at the utter hopelessness of his tone, though the full result
  of his action had not dawned on me yet; my mind was dazed.</p>

  <p>"But surely Jack was no coward," I said at length.</p>

  <p>"He was not; but on that particular morning he gave out. He had reached
  the limit of his endurance."</p>

  <p>"The Colonel's letter," I reminded him; "it praised the lad."</p>

  <p>"Lies," he answered wearily, "all lies, engineered by me. Not because I am
  ashamed of what I did, but for the lad's sake, and hers, and the old people.
  I loved the boy, as you know, but he failed, and <i>there was no other
  way</i>. And where the fiend himself is gloating over it is that he knows it
  was the only time Jack did fail. If only I hadn't been so beat the night
  before; if only his words had reached my brain before it was too late. If
  only...I think," he added, after a pause, "I think I shall go mad. Sometimes
  I wish I could."</p>

  <p>"And what of Pat?" I asked, at length breaking the silence.</p>

  <p>The hands grasping the bed tightened, and grew white.</p>

  <p>"I said 'Good-bye' to her before your eyes, ten minutes ago. I shall never
  see her again."</p>

  <p>"But, Great Heavens, Jerry!" I cried, "you can't give her up like that.
  She idolises the ground you walk on, she worships you, and she need never
  know. You were only doing your duty after all."</p>

  <p>"Stop!" he cried, and his voice was a command. "As you love me, old
  friend, don't tempt me. For three weeks those arguments have been flooding
  everything else from my mind. Do you remember at Henley, when she said, 'He
  might have answered to your voice?' Winkle, it's true, Jack might have. And I
  killed him. Just think if I married her, and she did find out. Her brother's
  murderer&mdash;in her eyes. The man who has wrecked her home, and broken her
  father and mother. It's inconceivable, it's hideous. Ah! don't you see how
  utterly final it all is? She may have been right; and if she was, then I, who
  loved her better than the world, have murdered her brother, and broken the
  old people's hearts for the sake of a theory. The fact that my theory has
  been put into practice, at the expense of everything I have to live for, is
  full of humour, isn't it?" And his laugh was wild.</p>

  <p>"Steady, Jerry," I said sternly. "What do you mean to do?"</p>

  <p>"You'll see, old man, in time," he answered. "First and foremost, get back
  to the regiment, arm or no arm. I would not have come home, but I had to see
  her once more."</p>

  <p>"You talk as if it was the end." I looked at him squarely.</p>

  <p>"It is," he answered. "It's easy out there."</p>

  <p>"Your mind is made up?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely." He gave a short laugh. "Good-bye, old friend. Ease it to her
  as well as you can. Say I'm unstrung by the trenches, anything you like; but
  don't let her guess the truth."</p>

  <p>For a long minute he held my hand. Then he turned away. He walked to the
  mantelpiece, and there was a photograph of her there. For a long time he
  looked at it, and it seemed to me he whispered something. A sudden dimness
  blinded my eyes, and when I looked again he had gone&mdash;through the window
  into the night.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I did not see Pat until I left Drayton Hall after that
  ghastly night, save only once or twice with her mother in the room.</p>

  <p>But an hour before I left she came to me, and her face was that of a woman
  who has passed through the fires.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Winkle, shall I ever see him again? You know what I mean."</p>

  <p>"You will never see him again, Pat," and the look in her eyes made me
  choke.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me what it was he told you before he went through the
  window? You see, I was in the hall waiting for him," and she smiled
  wearily.</p>

  <p>"I can't, Pat dear; I promised him," I muttered. "But it was nothing
  disgraceful."</p>

  <p>"Disgraceful!" she cried proudly. "Jerry, and anything disgraceful. Oh, my
  God! Winkle dear," and she broke down utterly, "do you remember the waltz
  they were playing that day&mdash;'Destiny'?"</p>

  <p>And then I went. Whether that wonderful woman's intuition has told her
  something of what happened, I know not. But yesterday morning I got a letter
  from the Colonel saying that Jerry had chucked his life away, saving a
  wounded man. And this morning she will have seen it in the papers.</p>

  <p>God help you, Pat, my dear.</p>

  <h2><a name="story3"
     id="story"></a>III. &mdash; SPUD TREVOR OF THE RED HUSSARS</h2>

  <h3>Previously published in <i>Men, Women and Guns</i></h3>

  <p class="first">It would be but a small exaggeration to say that in every
  God-forsaken hole and corner of the world, where soldiers lived and moved and
  had their being, before Nemesis overtook Europe, the name of Spud Trevor of
  the Red Hussars was known. From Simla to Singapore, from Khartoum to the
  Curragh his name was symbolical of all that a regimental officer should be.
  Senior subalterns guiding the erring feet of the young and frivolous from the
  tempting paths of night clubs and fair ladies, to the infinitely better ones
  of hunting and sport, were apt to quote him. Adjutants had been known to hold
  him up as an example to those of their flock who needed chastening for any of
  the hundred and one things that adjutants do not like&mdash;if they have
  their regiment at heart. And he deserved it all.</p>

  <p>I, who knew him, as well perhaps as anyone; I, who was privileged to call
  him friend, and yet in the hour of his greatest need failed him; I, to whose
  lot it has fallen to remove the slur from his name, state this in no
  half-hearted way. He deserved it, and a thousand times as much again. He was
  the type of man beside whom the ordinary English gentleman&mdash;the
  so-called white man&mdash;looked dirty-grey in comparison. And yet there came
  a day when men who had openly fawned on him left the room when he came in,
  when whispers of an unsuspected yellow streak in him began to circulate, when
  senior subalterns no longer held him up as a model. Now he is dead: and it
  has been left to me to vindicate him. Perchance by so doing I may wipe out a
  little of the stain of guilt that lies so heavy on my heart; perchance I may
  atone, in some small degree, for my doubts and suspicions; and, perchance
  too, the whitest man that ever lived may of his understanding and knowledge,
  perfected now in the Great Silence to which he has gone, accept my tardy
  reparation, and forgive. It is only yesterday that the document, which
  explained everything, came into my hands. It was sent to me sealed, and with
  it a short covering letter from a firm of solicitors stating that their
  client was dead&mdash;killed in France&mdash;and that according to his
  instructions they were forwarding the enclosed, with the request that I
  should make such use of it as I saw fit.</p>

  <p>To all those others, who, like myself, doubted, I address these words.
  Many have gone under: to them I venture to think everything is now clear.
  Maybe they have already met Spud, in the great vast gulfs where the mists of
  illusion are rolled away. For those who still live, he has no
  abuse&mdash;that incomparable sportsman and sahib; no recriminations for us
  who ruined his life. He goes farther, and finds excuses for us; God knows we
  need them. Here is what he has written. The document is reproduced exactly as
  I received it&mdash;saving only that I have altered all names. The man, whom
  I have called Ginger Bathurst, and everyone else concerned, will, I think,
  recognise themselves. And, pour les autres&mdash;let them guess.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In two days, old friend, my battalion sails for France; and,
  now with the intention full formed and fixed in my mind, that I shall not
  return, I have determined to put down on paper the true facts of what
  happened three years ago: or rather, the true motives that impelled me to do
  what I did. I put it that way, because you already know the facts. You know
  that I was accused of saving my life at the expense of a woman's when the
  <i>Astoria</i> foundered in mid-Atlantic; you know that I was accused of
  having thrust her aside and taken her place in the boat. That accusation is
  true. I did save my life at a woman's expense. But the motives that impelled
  my action you do not know, nor the identity of the woman concerned. I hope
  and trust that when you have read what I shall write you will exonerate me
  from the charge of a cowardice, vile and abominable beyond words, and at the
  most only find me guilty of a mistaken sense of duty. These words will only
  reach you in the event of my death; do with them what you will. I should like
  to think that the old name was once again washed clean of the dirty blot it
  has on it now; so do your best for me, old pal, do your best.</p>

  <p>You remember Ginger Bathurst&mdash;of course you do. Is he still a budding
  Staff Officer at the War Office, I wonder, or is he over the water? I'm out
  of touch with the fellows in these days&mdash;(<i>the pathos of it: Spud out
  of touch, Spud of all men, whose soul was in the Army</i>)&mdash;one doesn't
  live in the back of beyond for three years and find Army lists and gazettes
  growing on the trees. You remember also, I suppose, that I was best man at
  his wedding when he married the Comtesse de Grecin. I told you at the time
  that I was not particularly enamoured of his choice, but it was <i>his</i>
  funeral; and with the old boy asking me to steer him through, I had no
  possible reason for refusing. Not that I had anything against the woman: she
  was charming, fascinating, and had a pretty useful share of this world's
  boodle. Moreover, she seemed extraordinarily in love with Ginger, and was
  just the sort of woman to push an ambitious fellow like him right up to the
  top of the tree. He, of course, was simply idiotic: he was stark, raving mad
  about her; vowed she was the most peerless woman that ever a wretched being
  like himself had been privileged to look at; loaded her with presents which
  he couldn't afford, and generally took it a good deal worse than usual. I
  think, in a way, it was the calm acceptance of those presents that first
  prejudiced me against her. Naturally I saw a lot of her before they were
  married, being such a pal of Ginger's, and I did my best for his sake to
  overcome my dislike. But he wasn't a wealthy man&mdash;at the most he had
  about six hundred a year private means&mdash;and the presents of jewellery
  alone that he gave her must have made a pretty large hole in his capital.</p>

  <p>However that is all by the way. They were married, and shortly afterwards
  I took my leave big game shooting and lost sight of them for a while. When I
  came back Ginger was at the War Office, and they were living in London. They
  had a delightful little flat in Hans Crescent, and she was pushing him as
  only a clever woman can push. Everybody who could be of the slightest use to
  him sooner or later got roped in to dinner and was duly fascinated.</p>

  <p>To an habitual onlooker like myself, the whole thing was clear, and I must
  quite admit that much of my first instinctive dislike&mdash;and dislike is
  really too strong a word&mdash;evaporated. She went out of her way to be
  charming to me, not that I could be of any use to the old boy, but merely
  because I was his great friend; and of course she knew that I
  realised&mdash;what he never dreamed of&mdash;that she was paving the way to
  pull some really big strings for him later.</p>

  <p>I remember saying good-bye to her one afternoon after a luncheon, at which
  I had watched with great interest the complete capitulation of two generals
  and a well-known diplomatist.</p>

  <p>"You're a clever man, Mr. Spud," she murmured, with that charming air of
  taking one into her confidence, with which a woman of the world routs the
  most confirmed misogynist. "If only Ginger&mdash;&mdash;" She broke off and
  sighed: just the suggestion of a sigh; but sufficient to
  imply&mdash;lots.</p>

  <p>"My lady," I answered, "keep him fit; make him take exercise: above all
  things don't let him get fat. Even you would be powerless with a fat husband.
  But provided you keep him thin, and never let him decide anything for
  himself, he will live to be a lasting monument and example of what a woman
  can do. And warriors and statesmen shall bow down and worship, what time they
  drink tea in your boudoir and eat buns from your hand. Bismillah!"</p>

  <p>But time is short, and these details are trifling. Only once again, old
  pal, I am living in the days when I moved in the pleasant paths of life, and
  the temptation to linger is strong. Bear with me a moment. I am a sybarite
  for the moment in spirit: in reality&mdash;God! how it hurts.</p>

  <p class="poem">"Gentlemen rankers out on the spree,<br>
  Damned from here to eternity:<br>
  God have mercy on such as we.<br>
  Bah! Yah! Bah!"</p>

  <p>I never thought I should live to prove Kipling's lines. But that's what I
  am&mdash;a gentleman ranker; going out to the war of wars&mdash;a private. I,
  and that's the bitterest part of it, I, who had, as you know full well,
  always, for years, lived for this war, the war against those cursed Germans.
  I knew it was coming&mdash;you'll bear me witness of that fact&mdash;and the
  cruel irony of fate that has made that very knowledge my downfall is not the
  lightest part of the little bundle fate has thrown on my shoulders. Yes, old
  man, we're getting near the motives now; but all in good time. Let me lay it
  out dramatically; don't rob me of my exit&mdash;I'm feeling a bit theatrical
  this evening. It may interest you to know that I saw Lady Delton to-day:
  she's a V.A.D., and did not recognise me, thank Heaven!</p>

  <p>(<i>Need I say again that Delton is not the name he wrote. Sufficient that
  she and Spud knew one another</i> <i>very well, in other days. But in some
  men it would have emphasised the bitterness of spirit.</i>)</p>

  <p>Let's get on with it. A couple of years passed, and the summer of 1912
  found me in New York. I was temporarily engaged on a special job which it is
  unnecessary to specify. It was not a very important one, but, as you know, a
  gift of tongues and a liking for poking my nose into the affairs of nations
  had enabled me to get a certain amount of more or less diplomatic work. The
  job was over, and I was merely marking time in New York waiting for the
  <i>Astoria</i> to sail. Two days before she was due to leave, and just as I
  was turning into the doors of my hotel, I ran full tilt into von
  Basel&mdash;a very decent fellow in the Prussian Guard&mdash;who was seconded
  and doing military attaché work in America. I'd met him off and on hunting in
  England&mdash;one of the few Germans I know who really went well to
  hounds.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! Trevor," he said, as we met. "What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Marking time," I answered. "Waiting for my boat."</p>

  <p>We strolled to the bar, and over a cocktail he suggested that if I had
  nothing better to do I might as well come to some official ball that was on
  that evening. "I can get you a card," he remarked. "You ought to come; your
  friend, Mrs. Bathurst&mdash;Comtesse de Grecin that was&mdash;is going to be
  present."</p>

  <p>"I'd no idea she was this side of the water," I said, surprised.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes! Come over to see her people or something. Well! will you
  come?"</p>

  <p>I agreed, having nothing else on, and as he left the hotel, he laughed.
  "Funny the vagaries of fate. I don't suppose I come into this hotel once in
  three months. I only came down this evening to tell a man not to come and
  call as arranged, as my kid has got measles&mdash;and promptly ran into
  you."</p>

  <p>Truly the irony of circumstances! If one went back far enough, one might
  find that the determining factor of my disgrace was the quarrel of a nurse
  and her lover which made her take the child another walk than usual and pick
  up infection. Dash it all! you might even find that it was a spot on her nose
  that made her do so, as she didn't want to meet him when not looking at her
  best! But that way madness lies.</p>

  <p>Whatever the original cause&mdash;I went: and in due course met the
  Comtesse. She gave me a couple of dances, and I found that she, too, had
  booked her passage on the <i>Astoria</i>. I met very few people I knew, and
  having found it the usual boring stunt, I decided to get a glass of champagne
  and a sandwich and then retire to bed. I took them along to a small alcove
  where I could smoke a cigarette in peace, and sat down. It was as I sat down
  that I heard from behind a curtain which completely screened me from view,
  the words "English Army" spoken in German. And the voice was the voice of the
  Comtesse.</p>

  <p>Nothing very strange in the words you say, seeing that she spoke German,
  as well as several other languages, fluently. Perhaps not&mdash;but you know
  what my ideas used to be&mdash;how I was obsessed with the spy theory: at any
  rate, I listened. I listened for a quarter of an hour, and then I got my coat
  and went home&mdash;went home to try and see a way through just about the
  toughest proposition I'd ever been up against. For the Comtesse&mdash;Ginger
  Bathurst's idolised wife&mdash;was hand in glove with the German Secret
  Service. She was a spy, not of the wireless installation up the chimney type,
  not of the document-stealing type, but of a very much more dangerous type
  than either, the type it is almost impossible to incriminate.</p>

  <p>I can't remember the conversation I overheard exactly, I cannot give it to
  you word for word, but I will give you the substance of it. Her companion was
  von Basel's chief&mdash;a typical Prussian officer of the most overbearing
  description.</p>

  <p>"How goes it with you, Comtesse?" he asked her, and I heard the scrape of
  a match as he lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Well, Baron, very well."</p>

  <p>"They do not suspect?"</p>

  <p>"Not an atom. The question has never been raised even as to my national
  sympathies, except once, and then the suggestion&mdash;not forced or
  emphasised in any way&mdash;that, as the child of a family who had lost
  everything in the '70 war, my sympathies were not hard to discover, was quite
  sufficient. That was at the time of the Agadir crisis."</p>

  <p>"And you do not desire revanche?"</p>

  <p>"My dear man, I desire money. My husband with his pay and private income
  has hardly enough to dress me on."</p>

  <p>"But, dear lady, why, if I may ask, did you marry him? With so many others
  for her choice, surely the Comtesse de Grecin could have commanded the
  world?"</p>

  <p>"Charming as a phrase, but I assure you that the idea of the world at
  one's feet is as extinct as the dodo. No, Baron, you may take it from me he
  was the best I could do. A rising junior soldier, employed on a staff job at
  the War Office, <i>persona grata</i> with all the people who really count in
  London by reason of his family, and moreover infatuated with his charming
  wife." Her companion gave a guttural chuckle; I could feel him leering. "I
  give the best dinners in London; the majority of his senior officers think I
  am on the verge of running away with them, and when they become too
  obstreperous, I allow them to kiss my&mdash;fingers.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Baron," she spoke rapidly, in a low voice so that I could
  hardly catch what she said. "I have already given information about some
  confidential big howitzer trials which I saw; it was largely on my reports
  that action was stopped at Agadir; and there are many other
  things&mdash;things intangible, in a certain sense&mdash;points of view, the
  state of feeling in Ireland, the conditions of labour, which I am able to
  hear the inner side of, in a way quite impossible if I had not the entrée
  into that particular class of English society which I now possess. Not the
  so-called smart set, you understand; but the real ruling set&mdash;the
  leading soldiers, the leading diplomats. Of course they are
  discreet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you are a woman and a peerless one, chère Comtesse. I think we may
  leave that cursed country in your hands with perfect safety. And, sooner
  perhaps than even we realise, we may see der Tag."</p>

  <p>Such then was briefly the conversation I overheard. As I said, it is not
  given word for word&mdash;but that is immaterial. What was I to do? That was
  the point which drummed through my head as I walked back to my hotel; that
  was the point which was still drumming through my head as the dawn came
  stealing in through my window. Put yourself in my place, old man; what would
  you have done?</p>

  <p>I, alone, of everyone who knew her in London, had stumbled by accident on
  the truth. Bathurst idolised her, and she exaggerated no whit when she
  boasted that she had the entrée to the most exclusive circle in England. I
  know; I was one of it myself. And though one realises that it is only in
  plays and novels that Cabinet Ministers wander about whispering State secrets
  into the ears of beautiful adventuresses, yet one also knows in real life how
  devilish dangerous a really pretty and fascinating woman can
  be&mdash;especially when she's bent on finding things out and is clever
  enough to put two and two together.</p>

  <p>Take one thing alone, and it was an aspect of the case that particularly
  struck me. Supposing diplomatic relations became strained between us and
  Germany&mdash;and I firmly believed, as you know, that sooner or later they
  would; supposing mobilisation was ordered&mdash;a secret one; suppose any of
  the hundred and one things which would be bound to form a prelude to a
  European war&mdash;and which at all costs must be kept secret&mdash;had
  occurred; think of the incalculable danger a clever woman in her position
  might have been, however discreet her husband was. And, my dear old boy, you
  know Ginger!</p>

  <p>Supposing the Expeditionary Force were on the point of embarkation. A wife
  might guess their port of departure and arrival by an artless question or two
  as to where her husband on the Staff had motored to that day. But why go on?
  You see what I mean. Only to me, at that time&mdash;and now I might almost
  say that I am glad events have justified me&mdash;it appealed even more than
  it would have, say, to you. For I was so convinced of the danger that
  threatened us.</p>

  <p>But what was I to do? It was only my word against hers. Tell Ginger? The
  idea made even me laugh. Tell the generals and the diplomatists? They didn't
  want to kiss <i>my</i> hand. Tell some big bug in the Secret Service?
  Yes&mdash;that anyway; but she was such a devilish clever woman, that I had
  but little faith in such a simple remedy, especially as most of them
  patronised her dinners themselves.</p>

  <p>Still, that was the only thing to be done&mdash;that, and to keep a
  look-out myself, for I was tolerably certain she did not suspect me. Why
  should she?</p>

  <p>And so in due course I found myself sitting next her at dinner as the
  <i>Astoria</i> started her journey across the water.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I am coming to the climax of the drama, old man; I shall not
  bore you much longer. But before I actually give you the details of what
  occurred on that ill-fated vessel's last trip, I want to make sure that you
  realise the state of mind I was in, and the action that I had decided on.
  Firstly, I was convinced that my dinner partner&mdash;the wife of one of my
  best friends&mdash;was an unscrupulous spy. That the evidence would not have
  hung a fly in a court of law was not the point; the evidence was my own
  hearing, which was good enough for me.</p>

  <p>Secondly, I was convinced that she occupied a position in society which
  rendered it easy for her to get hold of the most invaluable information in
  the event of a war between us and Germany.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, I was convinced that there would be a war between us and
  Germany.</p>

  <p>So much for my state of mind; now, for my course of action.</p>

  <p>I had decided to keep a watch on her, and, if I could get hold of the
  slightest incriminating evidence, expose her secretly, but mercilessly, to
  the Secret Service. If I could not&mdash;and if I realised there was danger
  brewing&mdash;to inform the Secret Service of what I had heard, and,
  sacrificing Ginger's friendship if necessary, and my own reputation for
  chivalry, swear away her honour, or anything, provided only her capacity for
  obtaining information temporarily ceased. Once that was done, then face the
  music, and be accused, if needs be, of false swearing, unrequited love,
  jealousy, what you will. But to destroy her capacity for harm to my country
  was my bounden duty, whatever the social or personal results to me.</p>

  <p>And there was one other thing&mdash;and on this one thing the whole course
  of the matter was destined to hang: <i>I alone could do it, for I alone knew
  the truth.</i> Let that sink in, old son; grasp it, realise it, and read my
  future actions by the light of that one simple fact.</p>

  <p>I can see you sit back in your chair, and look into the fire with the
  light of comprehension dawning in your eyes; it does put the matter in a
  different complexion, doesn't it, my friend? You begin to appreciate the
  motives that impelled me to sacrifice a woman's life; so far so good. You are
  even magnanimous: what is one woman compared to the danger of a nation?</p>

  <p>Dear old boy, I drink a silent toast to you. Have you no suspicions? What
  if the woman I sacrificed was the Comtesse herself? Does it surprise you;
  wasn't it the God-sent solution to everything?</p>

  <p>Just as a freak of fate had acquainted me with her secret; so did a freak
  of fate throw me in her path at the end...</p>

  <p>We hit an iceberg, as you may remember, in the middle of the night, and
  the ship foundered in under twenty minutes.</p>

  <p>You can imagine the scene of chaos after we struck, or rather you can't.
  Men were running wildly about shouting, women were screaming, and the roar of
  the siren bellowing forth into the night drove people to a perfect frenzy.
  Then all the lights went out, and darkness settled down like a pall on the
  ship. I struggled up on deck, which was already tilting up at a perilous
  angle, and there&mdash;in the mass of scurrying figures&mdash;I came face to
  face with the Comtesse. In the panic of the moment I had forgotten all about
  her. She was quite calm, and smiled at me, for of course our relations were
  still as before.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there came the shout from close at hand, "Room for one more
  only." What happened then, happened in a couple of seconds; it will take me
  longer to describe.</p>

  <p>There flashed into my mind what would occur if I were drowned and the
  Comtesse was saved. There would be no one to combat her activities in
  England; she would have a free hand. My plans were null and void if I died; I
  must get back to England&mdash;or England would be in peril. I must pass on
  my information to someone&mdash;for I alone knew.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! one more." Another shout from near by, and looking round I saw
  that we were alone. It was she or I.</p>

  <p>She moved towards the boat, and as she did so I saw the only possible
  solution&mdash;I saw what I then thought to be my duty; what I still
  consider&mdash;and, God knows, that scene is never long out of my
  mind&mdash;what I still consider to have been my duty. I took her by the arm
  and twisted her facing me.</p>

  <p>"As Ginger's wife, yes," I muttered; "as the cursed spy I know you to be,
  no&mdash;a thousand times no."</p>

  <p>"My God!" she whispered. "My God!"</p>

  <p>Without further thought I pushed by her and stepped into the boat, which
  was actually being lowered into the water. Two minutes later the
  <i>Astoria</i> sank, and she went down with her...</p>

  <p>That is what occurred that night in mid-Atlantic. I make no excuses, I
  offer no palliation; I merely state facts.</p>

  <p>Only had I not heard what I did hear in that alcove she would have been
  just&mdash;Ginger's wife. Would the Expeditionary Force have crossed so
  successfully, I wonder?</p>

  <p>As I say, I did what I still consider to have been my duty. If both could
  have been saved, well and good; but if it was only one, it <i>had</i> to be
  me, or neither. That's the rub; should it have been neither?</p>

  <p>Many times since then, old friend, has the white twitching face of that
  woman haunted me in my dreams and in my waking hours. Many times since then
  have I thought that&mdash;spy or no spy&mdash;I had no right to save my life
  at her expense; I should have gone down with her. Quixotical, perhaps, seeing
  she was what she was; but she was a woman. One thing and one thing only I can
  say. When you read these lines, I shall be dead; they will come to you as a
  voice from the dead. And, as a man who faces his Maker, I tell you, with a
  calm certainty that I am not deceiving myself, that that night there was no
  trace of cowardice in my mind. It was not a desire to save my own life that
  actuated me; it was the fear of danger to England. An error of judgment
  possibly; an act of cowardice&mdash;no. That much I state, and that much I
  demand that you believe.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">And now we come to the last chapter&mdash;the chapter that
  you know. I'd been back about two months when I first realised that there
  were stories going round about me. There were whispers in the club; men
  avoided me; women cut me. Then came the dreadful night when a man&mdash;half
  drunk&mdash;in the club accused me of cowardice point-blank, and sneeringly
  contrasted my previous reputation with my conduct on the <i>Astoria</i>. And
  I realised that someone must have seen. I knocked that swine in the club
  down; but the whispers grew. I knew it. Someone had seen, and it would be
  sheer hypocrisy on my part to pretend that such a thing didn't matter. It
  mattered everything: it ended me. The world&mdash;our world&mdash;judges
  deeds, not motives; and even had I published at the time this document I am
  sending to you, our world would have found me guilty. They would have said
  what you would have said had you spoken the thoughts I saw in your eyes that
  night I came to you. They would have said that a sudden wave of cowardice had
  overwhelmed me, and that brought face to face with death I had saved my own
  life at the expense of a woman's. Many would have gone still further, and
  said that my black cowardice was rendered blacker still by my hypocrisy in
  inventing such a story; that first to kill the woman, and then to blacken her
  reputation as an excuse, showed me as a thing unfit to live. I know the
  world.</p>

  <p>Moreover, as far as I knew then&mdash;I am sure of it now&mdash;whoever it
  was who saw my action, did not see who the woman was, and therefore the
  publication of this document at that time would have involved Ginger, for it
  would have been futile to publish it without names. Feeling as I did that
  perhaps I should have sunk with her; feeling as I did that, for good or evil,
  I had blasted Ginger's life, I simply couldn't do it. You didn't believe in
  me, old chap; at the bottom of their hearts all my old pals thought I'd shown
  the yellow streak; and I couldn't stick it. So I went to the Colonel, and
  told him I was handing in my papers. He was in his quarters, I remember, and
  started filling his pipe as I was speaking.</p>

  <p>"Why, Spud?" he asked, when I told him my intention.</p>

  <p>And then I told him something of what I have written to you. I said it to
  him in confidence, and when I'd finished he sat very silent.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he muttered at length. "Ginger's wife!"</p>

  <p>"You believe me, Colonel?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Spud," he said, putting his hands on my shoulders, "that's a damn rotten
  thing to ask me&mdash;after fifteen years. But it's the regiment." And he
  fell to staring at the fire.</p>

  <p>Aye, that was it. It was the regiment that mattered. For better or for
  worse I had done what I had done, and it was my show. The Red Hussars must
  not be made to suffer; and their reputation would have suffered through me.
  Otherwise I'd have faced it out. As it was, I had to go; I knew it. I'd come
  to the same decision myself.</p>

  <p>Only now, sitting here in camp with the setting sun glinting through the
  windows of the hut, just a Canadian private under an assumed name, things are
  a little different. The regiment is safe; I must think now of the old name.
  The Colonel was killed at Cambrai; therefore you alone will be in possession
  of the facts. Ginger, if he reads these words, will perhaps forgive me for
  the pain I have inflicted on him. Let him remember that though I did a
  dreadful thing to him, a thing which up to now he has been ignorant of, yet I
  suffered much for his sake after. During my life it was one thing; when I am
  dead his claims must give way to a greater one&mdash;my name.</p>

  <p>Wherefore I, Patrick Courtenay Trevor, having the unalterable intention of
  meeting my Maker during the present war, and therefore feeling in a measure
  that I am, even as I write, standing at the threshold of His Presence, do
  swear before Almighty God that what I have written is the truth, the whole
  truth, and nothing but the truth. So help me, God.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The fall-in is going, old man. Good-bye.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="story4"
     id="story4"></a>IV. &mdash; PRIVATE MEYRICK&mdash;COMPANY IDIOT</h2>

  <h3>Previously published in <i>Men, Women and Guns</i></h3>

  <p class="first">No one who has ever given the matter a moment's thought
  would deny, I suppose, that a regiment without discipline is like a ship
  without a rudder. True as that fact has always been, it is doubly so now,
  when men are exposed to mental and physical shocks such as have never before
  been thought of.</p>

  <p>The condition of a man's brain after he has sat in a trench and suffered
  an intensive bombardment for two or three hours can only be described by one
  word, and that is&mdash;numbed. The actual physical concussion, apart
  altogether from the mental terror, caused by the bursting of a succession of
  large shells in a man's vicinity, temporarily robs him of the use of his
  thinking faculties. He becomes half-stunned, dazed; his limbs twitch
  convulsively and involuntarily; he mutters foolishly&mdash;he becomes
  incoherent. Starting with fright he passes through that stage, passes beyond
  it into a condition bordering on coma; and when a man is in that condition he
  is not responsible for his actions. His brain has ceased to work...</p>

  <p>Now it is, I believe, a principle of psychology that the brain or mind of
  a man can be divided into two parts&mdash;the objective and the subjective:
  the objective being that part of his thought-box which is actuated by outside
  influences, by his senses, by his powers of deduction; the subjective being
  that part which is not directly controllable by what he sees and hears, the
  part which the religious might call his soul, the Buddhist "the Spark of
  God," others instinct. And this portion of a man's nature remains acutely
  active, even while the other part has struck work. In fact, the more numbed
  and comatose the thinking brain, the more clearly and insistently does
  subjective instinct hold sway over a man's body. Which all goes to show that
  discipline, if it is to be of any use to a man at such a time, must be a very
  different type of thing to what the ordinary, uninitiated, and so-called free
  civilian believes it to be. It must be an ideal, a thing where the motive
  counts, almost a religion. It must be an appeal to the soul of man, not
  merely an order to his body. That the order to his body, the self-control of
  his daily actions, the general change in his mode of life will infallibly
  follow on the heels of the appeal to his soul&mdash;if that appeal be
  successful&mdash;is obvious. But the appeal must come first: it must be the
  driving power; it must be the cause and not the effect. Otherwise, when the
  brain is gone&mdash;numbed by causes outside its control; when the reasoning
  intellect of man is out of action&mdash;stunned for the time; when only his
  soul remains to pull the quivering, helpless body through,&mdash;then, unless
  that soul has the ideal of discipline in it, it <i>will</i> fail. And failure
  <i>may</i> mean death and disaster; it <i>will</i> mean shame and disgrace,
  when sanity returns...</p>

  <p>To the man seated at his desk in the company office these ideas were not
  new. He had been one of the original Expeditionary Force; but a sniper had
  sniped altogether too successfully out by Zillebecke in the early stages of
  the first battle of Ypres, and when that occurs a rest cure becomes
  necessary. At that time he was the senior subaltern of one of the finest
  regiments of "a contemptible little army"; now he was a major commanding a
  company in the tenth battalion of that same regiment. And in front of him on
  the desk, a yellow form pinned to a white slip of flimsy paper, announced
  that No. 8469, Private Meyrick, J., was for office. The charge was "Late
  falling in on the 8 a.m. parade," and the evidence against him was being
  given by C.-S.-M. Hayton, also an old soldier from that original battalion at
  Ypres. It was Major Seymour himself who had seen the late appearance of the
  above-mentioned Private Meyrick, and who had ordered the yellow form to be
  prepared. And now with it in front of him, he stared musingly at the office
  fire...</p>

  <p>There are a certain number of individuals who from earliest infancy have
  been imbued with the idea that the chief pastime of officers in the army,
  when they are not making love to another man's wife, is the preparation of
  harsh and tyrannical rules for the express purpose of annoying their men, and
  the gloating infliction of drastic punishment on those that break them. The
  absurdity of this idea has nothing to do with it, it being a well-known fact
  that the more absurd an idea is, the more utterly fanatical do its adherents
  become. To them the thought that a man being late on parade should make him
  any the worse fighter&mdash;especially as he had, in all probability, some
  good and sufficient excuse&mdash;cannot be grasped. To them the idea that men
  may not be a law unto themselves&mdash;though possibly agreed to reluctantly
  in the abstract&mdash;cannot possibly be assimilated in the concrete.</p>

  <p>"He has committed some trifling offence," they say; "now you will give him
  some ridiculous punishment. That is the curse of militarism&mdash;a chosen
  few rule by Fear." And if you tell them that any attempt to inculcate
  discipline by fear alone must of necessity fail, and that far from that being
  the method in the Army the reverse holds good, they will not believe you.
  Yet&mdash;it is so...</p>

  <p>"Shall I bring in the prisoner, sir?" The Sergeant-Major was standing by
  the door.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'll see him now." The officer threw his cigarette into the fire and
  put on his hat.</p>

  <p>"Take off your 'at. Come along there, my lad&mdash;move. You'd go to sleep
  at your mother's funeral&mdash;you would." Seymour smiled at the conversation
  outside the door; he had soldiered many years with that Sergeant-Major. "Now,
  step up briskly. Quick march. 'Alt. Left turn." He closed the door and ranged
  himself alongside the prisoner facing the table.</p>

  <p>"No. 8469, Private Meyrick&mdash;you are charged with being late on the 8
  a.m. parade this morning. Sergeant-Major, what do you know about it?"</p>

  <p>"Sir, on the 8 a.m. parade this morning, Private Meyrick came running on
  'alf a minute after the bugle sounded. 'Is puttees were not put on tidily.
  I'd like to say, sir, that it's not the first time this man has been late
  falling in. 'E seems to me to be always a dreaming, somehow&mdash;not
  properly awake like. I warned 'im for office."</p>

  <p>The officer's eyes rested on the hatless soldier facing him. "Well,
  Meyrick," he said quietly, "what have you got to say?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, sir. I'm sorry as 'ow I was late. I was reading, and I never
  noticed the time."</p>

  <p>"What were you reading?" The question seemed superfluous&mdash;almost
  foolish; but something in the eyes of the man facing him, something in his
  short, stumpy, uncouth figure interested him.</p>

  <p>"I was a'reading Kipling, sir." The Sergeant-Major snorted as nearly as
  such an august disciplinarian could snort in the presence of his officer.</p>

  <p>"'E ought, sir, to 'ave been 'elping the cook's mate&mdash;until 'e was
  due on parade."</p>

  <p>"Why do you read Kipling or anyone else when you ought to be doing other
  things?" queried the officer. His interest in the case surprised himself; the
  excuse was futile, and two or three days to barracks is an excellent
  corrective.</p>

  <p>"I dunno, sir. 'E sort of gets 'old of me, like. Makes me want to do
  things&mdash;and then I can't. I've always been slow and awkward like, and I
  gets a bit flustered at times. But I do try 'ard." Again a doubtful noise
  from the Sergeant-Major; to him trying 'ard and reading Kipling when you
  ought to be swabbing up dishes were hardly compatible.</p>

  <p>For a moment or two the officer hesitated, while the Sergeant-Major looked
  frankly puzzled. "What the blazes 'as come over 'im," he was thinking;
  "surely he ain't going to be guyed by that there wash. Why don't 'e give 'im
  two days and be done with it&mdash;and me with all them returns."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to talk to you, Meyrick." Major Seymour's voice cut in on these
  reflections. For the fraction of a moment "Two days C.B." had been on the tip
  of his tongue, and then he'd changed his mind. "I want to try and make you
  understand why you were brought up to office to-day. In every
  community&mdash;in every body of men&mdash;there must be a code of rules
  which govern what they do. Unless those rules are carried out by all those
  men, the whole system falls to the ground. Supposing everyone came on to
  parade half a minute late because they'd been reading Kipling?"</p>

  <p>"I know, sir. I see as 'ow I was wrong. But&mdash;I dreams sometimes as
  'ow I'm like them he talks about, when 'e says as 'ow they lifted 'em through
  the charge as won the day. And then the dream's over, and I know as 'ow I'm
  not."</p>

  <p>The Sergeant-Major's impatience was barely concealed; those returns were
  oppressing him horribly.</p>

  <p>"You can get on with your work, Sergeant-Major. I know you're busy."
  Seymour glanced at the N.C.O. "I want to say a little more to Meyrick."</p>

  <p>The scandalised look on his face amused him; to leave a prisoner alone
  with an officer&mdash;impossible, unheard of.</p>

  <p>"I am in no hurry, sir, thank you."</p>

  <p>"All right then," Seymour spoke briefly. "Now, Meyrick, I want you to
  realise that the principle at the bottom of all discipline is the motive that
  makes that discipline. I want you to realise that all these rules are made
  for the good of the regiment, and that in everything you do and say you have
  an effect on the regiment. You count in the show, and I count in it, and so
  does the Sergeant-Major. We're all out for the same thing, my lad, and that
  is the regiment. We do things not because we're afraid of being punished if
  we don't, but because we know that they are for the good of the
  regiment&mdash;the finest regiment in the world. You've got to make good, not
  because you'll be dropped on if you don't, but because you'll pull the
  regiment down if you fail. And because you count, you, personally, must not
  be late on parade. It <i>does</i> matter what you do yourself. I want you to
  realise that, and why. The rules you are ordered to comply with are the best
  rules. Sometimes we alter one&mdash;because we find a better; but they're the
  best we can get, and before you can find yourself in the position of the men
  you dream about&mdash;the men who lift others, the men who lead
  others&mdash;you've got to lift and lead yourself. Nothing is too small to
  worry about, nothing too insignificant. And because I think, that at the back
  of your head somewhere you've got the right idea; because I think it's
  natural to you to be a bit slow and awkward and that your failure isn't due
  to laziness or slackness, I'm not going to punish you this time for breaking
  the rules. If you do it again, it will be a different matter. There comes a
  time when one can't judge motives; when one can only judge results. Case
  dismissed."</p>

  <p>Thoughtfully the officer lit a cigarette as the door closed, and though
  for the present there was nothing more for him to do in office, he lingered
  on, pursuing his train of thoughts. Fully conscious of the aggrieved wrath of
  his Sergeant-Major at having his time wasted, a slight smile spread over his
  face. He was not given to making perorations of this sort, and now that it
  was over he wondered rather why he'd done it. And then he recalled the look
  in the private's eyes as he had spoken of his dreams.</p>

  <p>"He'll make good that man." Unconsciously he spoke aloud. "He'll make
  good."</p>

  <p>The discipline of habit is what we soldiers had before the war, and that
  takes time. Now it must be the discipline of intelligence, of ideal. And for
  that fear is the worst conceivable teacher. We have no time to form habits
  now; the routine of the army is of too short duration before the test comes.
  And the test is too crushing...</p>

  <p>The bed-rock now as then is the same, only the methods of getting down to
  that bed-rock have to be more hurried. Of old habitude and constant
  association instilled a religion&mdash;the religion of obedience, the
  religion of esprit de corps. But it took time. Now we need the same religion,
  but we haven't the same time.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In the office next door the Sergeant-Major was speaking soft
  words to the Pay Corporal.</p>

  <p>"Blimey, I dunno what's come over the bloke. You know that there
  Meyrick..."</p>

  <p>"Who, the Slug?" interpolated the other.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Well 'e come shambling on to parade this morning with 'is puttees
  flapping round his ankles&mdash;late as usual; and 'e told me to run 'im up
  to office." A thumb indicated the Major next door. "When I gets 'im there,
  instead of giving 'im three days C.B. and being done with it, 'e starts a lot
  of jaw about motives and discipline. 'E hadn't got no ruddy excuse; said 'e
  was a'reading Kipling, or some such rot&mdash;when 'e ought to have been
  'elping the cook's mate."</p>

  <p>"What did he give him?" asked the Pay Corporal, interested.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. His blessing and dismissed the case. As if I had nothing better
  to do than listen to 'im talking 'ot air to a perisher like that there
  Meyrick. 'Ere, pass over them musketry returns."</p>

  <p>Which conversation, had Seymour overheard it, he would have understood and
  fully sympathised with. For C.-S.-M. Hayton, though a prince of
  sergeant-majors, was no student of physiology. To him a spade was a spade
  only as long as it shovelled earth.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Now, before I go on to the day when the subject of all this
  trouble and talk was called on to make good, and how he did it, a few words
  on the man himself might not be amiss. War, the great forcing house of
  character, admits no lies. Sooner or later it finds out a man, and he stands
  in the pitiless glare of truth for what he is. And it is not by any means the
  cheery hail-fellow-well-met type, or the thruster, or the sportsman, who
  always pool the most votes when the judging starts...</p>

  <p>John Meyrick, before he began to train for the great adventure, had been
  something in a warehouse down near Tilbury. And "something" is about the best
  description of what he was that you could give. Moreover there wasn't a dog's
  chance of his ever being "anything." He used to help the young man&mdash;I
  should say young gentleman&mdash;who checked weigh bills at one of the dock
  entrances. More than that I cannot say, and incidentally the subject is not
  of surpassing importance. His chief interests in life were contemplating the
  young gentleman, listening open-mouthed to his views on life, and, dreaming.
  Especially the latter. Sometimes he would go after the day's work, and,
  sitting down on a bollard, his eyes would wander over the lines of some dirty
  tramp, with her dark-skinned crew. Visions of wonderful seas and tropic
  islands, of leafy palms with the blue-green surf thundering in towards them,
  of coral reefs and glorious-coloured flowers, would run riot in his brain.
  Not that he particularly wanted to go and see these figments of his
  imagination for himself; it was enough for him to dream of them&mdash;to
  conjure them up for a space in his mind by the help of an actual concrete
  ship&mdash;and then to go back to his work of assisting his loquacious
  companion. He did not find the work uncongenial; he had no hankerings after
  other modes of life&mdash;in fact the thought of any change never even
  entered into his calculations. What the future might hold he neither knew nor
  cared; the expressions of his companion on the rottenness of life in general
  and their firm in particular awoke no answering chord in his breast He had
  enough to live on in his little room at the top of a tenement house&mdash;he
  had enough over for an occasional picture show&mdash;and he had his dreams.
  He was content.</p>

  <p>Then came the war. For a long while it passed him by; it was no concern of
  his, and it didn't enter his head that it was ever likely to be until one
  night, as he was going in to see "Jumping Jess, or the Champion Girl
  Cowpuncher" at the local movies, a recruiting sergeant touched him on the
  arm.</p>

  <p>He was not a promising specimen for a would-be soldier, but that
  recruiting sergeant was not new to the game, and he'd seen worse.</p>

  <p>"Why aren't you in khaki, young fellow me lad?" he remarked genially.</p>

  <p>The idea, as I say, was quite new to our friend. Even though that very
  morning his colleague in the weigh-bill pastime had chucked it and joined,
  even though he'd heard a foreman discussing who they were to put in his place
  as "that young Meyrick was habsolutely 'opeless," it still hadn't dawned on
  him that he might go too. But the recruiting sergeant was a man of some
  knowledge; in his daily round he encountered many and varied types. In two
  minutes he had fired the boy's imagination with a glowing and partially true
  description of the glories of war and the army, and supplied him with another
  set of dreams to fill his brain. Wasting no time, he struck while the iron
  was hot, and in a few minutes John Meyrick, sometime checker of weigh-bills,
  died, and No. 8469, Private John Meyrick, came into being...</p>

  <p>But though you change a man's vocation with the stroke of a pen, you do
  not change his character. A dreamer he was in the beginning, and a dreamer he
  remained to the end. And dreaming, as I have already pointed out, was not a
  thing which commended itself to Company-Sergeant-Major Hayton, who in due
  course became one of the chief arbiters of our friend's destinies. True it
  was no longer coral islands&mdash;but such details availed not with cook's
  mates and other busy movers in the regimental hive. Where he'd got them from,
  Heaven knows, those tattered volumes of Kipling; but their matchless spirit
  had caught his brain and fired his soul, with the result&mdash;well, the
  first of them has been given.</p>

  <p>There were more results to follow. Not three days after he was again upon
  the mat for the same offence, only to say much the same as before.</p>

  <p>"I do try, sir&mdash;I do try; but some'ow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And though in the bottom of his heart the officer believed him, though in
  a very strange way he felt interested in him, there are limits and there are
  rules. There comes a time, as he had said, when one can't judge by motives,
  when one can only judge by results.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't only try; you must succeed. Three days to barracks."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">That night in mess the officer sat next to the Colonel.
  "It's the thrusters, the martinets, the men of action who win the V.C.'s and
  D.C.M.'s, my dear fellow," said his C.O., as he pushed along the wine. "But
  it's the dreamers, the idealists who deserve them. They suffer so much
  more."</p>

  <p>And as Major Seymour poured himself out a glass of port, a face came into
  his mind&mdash;the face of a stumpy, uncouth man with deep-set eyes. "I
  wonder," he murmured&mdash;"I wonder."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The opportunities for stirring deeds of heroism in France do
  not occur with great frequency, whatever outsiders may think to the contrary.
  For months on end a battalion may live a life of peace and utter boredom,
  getting a few casualties now and then, occasionally bagging an unwary Hun,
  vegetating continuously in the same unprepossessing hole in the
  ground&mdash;saving only when they go to another, or retire to a town
  somewhere in rear to have a bath. And the battalion to which No. 8469,
  Private Meyrick, belonged was no exception to the general rule.</p>

  <p>For five weeks they had lived untroubled by anything except
  flies&mdash;all of them, that is, save various N.C.O.'s in A company. To them
  flies were quite a secondary consideration when compared to their other
  worry. And that, it is perhaps superfluous to add, was Private Meyrick
  himself.</p>

  <p>Every day the same scene would be enacted; every day some sergeant or
  corporal would dance with rage as he contemplated the Company Idiot&mdash;the
  title by which he was now known to all and sundry.</p>

  <p>"Wake up! Wake up! Lumme, didn't I warn you&mdash;didn't I warn yer 'arf
  an 'our ago over by that there tree, when you was a-staring into the branches
  looking for nuts or something&mdash;didn't I warn yer that the company was
  parading at 10.15 for 'ot baths?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't 'ear you, Corporal&mdash;I didn't really."</p>

  <p>"Didn't 'ear me! Wot yer mean, didn't 'ear me? My voice ain't like the
  twitter of a grass'opper, is it? It's my belief you're balmy, my boy,
  B-A-R-M-Y. Savez. Get a move on yer, for Gawd's sake! You ought to 'ave a
  nurse. And when you gets to the bath-'ouse, for 'Eaven's sake pull yerself
  together! Don't forget to take off yer clothes before yer gets in; and when
  they lets the water out, don't go stopping in the bath because you forgot to
  get out. I wouldn't like another regiment to see you lying about when they
  come. They might say things."</p>

  <p>And so with slight variations the daily strafe went on. Going up to the
  trenches it was always Meyrick who got lost; Meyrick who fell into shell
  holes and lost his rifle or the jam for his section; Meyrick who forgot to
  lie down when a flare went up, but stood vacantly gazing at it until
  partially stunned by his next-door neighbour. Periodically messages would
  come through from the next regiment asking if they'd lost the regimental pet,
  and that he was being returned. It was always Meyrick...</p>

  <p>"I can't do nothing with 'im, sir." It was the Company-Sergeant-Major
  speaking to Seymour. "'E seems soft like in the 'ead. Whenever 'e does do
  anything and doesn't forget, 'e does it wrong. 'E's always dreaming and 'alf
  balmy."</p>

  <p>"He's not a flier, I know, Sergeant-Major, but we've got to put up with
  all sorts nowadays," returned the officer diplomatically. "Send him to me,
  and let me have a talk to him."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir; but 'e'll let us down badly one of these days."</p>

  <p>And so once again Meyrick stood in front of his company officer, and was
  encouraged to speak of his difficulties. To an amazing degree he had
  remembered the discourse he had listened to many months previously; to do
  something for the regiment was what he desired more than anything&mdash;to do
  something big, really big. He floundered and stopped; he could find no
  words...</p>

  <p>"But don't you understand that it's just as important to do the little
  things? If you can't do them, you'll never do the big ones."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;I sees that; I do try, sir, and then I gets thinking, and
  some'ow&mdash;oh! I dunno&mdash;but everything goes out of my head like. I
  wants the regiment to be proud of me&mdash;and then they calls me the Company
  Idiot." There was something in the man's face that touched Seymour.</p>

  <p>"But how can the regiment be proud of you, my lad," he asked gently, "if
  you're always late on parade, and forgetting to do what you're told? If I
  wasn't certain in my own mind that it wasn't slackness and disobedience on
  your part, I should ask the Colonel to send you back to England as
  useless."</p>

  <p>An appealing look came into the man's eyes. "Oh! don't do that, sir. I
  will try 'ard&mdash;straight I will."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but as I told you once before, there comes a time when one must
  judge by results. Now, Meyrick, you must understand this finally. Unless you
  do improve, I shall do what I said. I shall tell the Colonel that you're not
  fitted to be a soldier, and I shall get him to send you away. I can't go on
  much longer; you're more trouble than you're worth. We're going up to the
  trenches again to-night, and I shall watch you. That will do; you may
  go."</p>

  <p>And so it came about that the Company Idiot entered on what was destined
  to prove the big scene in his uneventful life under the eyes of a critical
  audience. To the Sergeant-Major, who was a gross materialist, failure was a
  foregone conclusion; to the company officer, who went a little nearer to the
  heart of things, the issue was doubtful. Possibly his threat would succeed;
  possibly he'd struck the right note. And the peculiar thing is that both
  proved right according to their own lights...</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">This particular visit to the trenches was destined to be of
  a very different nature to former ones. On previous occasions peace had
  reigned; nothing untoward had occurred to mar the quiet restful existence
  which trench life so often affords to its devotees. But this time...</p>

  <p>It started about six o'clock in the morning on the second day of their
  arrival&mdash;a really pleasant little intensive bombardment. A succession of
  shells came streaming in, shattering every yard of the front line with
  tearing explosions. Then the Huns turned on the gas and attacked behind it. A
  few reached the trenches&mdash;the majority did not; and the ground outside
  was covered with grey-green figures, some of which were writhing and
  twitching and some of which were still. The attack had failed...</p>

  <p>But that sort of thing leaves its mark on the defenders, and this was
  their first baptism of real fire. Seymour had passed rapidly down the trench
  when he realised that for the moment it was over; and though men's faces were
  covered with the hideous gas masks, he saw by the twitching of their hands
  and by the ugly high-pitched laughter he heard that it would be well to get
  into touch with those behind. Moreover, in every piece of trench there lay
  motionless figures in khaki...</p>

  <p>It was as he entered his dugout that the bombardment started again.
  Quickly he went to the telephone, and started to get on to brigade
  headquarters. It took him twenty seconds to realise that the line had been
  cut, and then he cursed dreadfully. The roar of the bursting shells was
  deafening; his cursing was inaudible; but in a fit of almost childish
  rage&mdash;he kicked the machine. Men's nerves are jangled at times...</p>

  <p>It was merely coincidence doubtless, but a motionless figure in a gas
  helmet crouching outside the dugout saw that kick, and slowly in his bemused
  brain there started a train of thought. Why should his company officer do
  such a thing; why should they all be cowering in the trench waiting for death
  to come to them; why...? For a space his brain refused to act; then it
  started again.</p>

  <p>Why was that man lying full length at the bottom of the trench, with the
  great hole torn out of his back, and the red stream spreading slowly round
  him; why didn't it stop instead of filling up the little holes at the bottom
  of the trench and then overflowing into the next one? He was the corporal
  who'd called him balmy; but why should he be dead? He was dead&mdash;at least
  the motionless watcher thought he must be. He lay so still, and his body
  seemed twisted and unnatural. But why should one of the regiment be dead; it
  was all so unexpected, so sudden? And why did his Major kick the
  telephone?...</p>

  <p>For a space he lay still, thinking; trying to figure things out. He
  suddenly remembered tripping over a wire coming up to the trench, and being
  cursed by his sergeant for lurching against him. "You would," he had been
  told&mdash;"you would. If it ain't a wire, you'd fall over yer own perishing
  feet."</p>

  <p>"What's the wire for, sergint?" he had asked.</p>

  <p>"What d'you think, softie. Drying the washing on? It's the telephone wire
  to Headquarters."</p>

  <p>It came all back to him, and it had been over by the stunted pollard that
  he'd tripped up. Then he looked back at the silent, motionless
  figure&mdash;the red stream had almost reached him&mdash;and the Idea came.
  It came suddenly&mdash;like a blow. The wire must be broken, otherwise the
  officer wouldn't have kicked the telephone; he'd have spoken through it.</p>

  <p>"I wants the regiment to be proud of me&mdash;and then they calls me the
  Company Idiot." He couldn't do the little things&mdash;he was always
  forgetting, but...! What was that about "lifting 'em through the charge that
  won the day"? There was no charge, but there was the regiment. And the
  regiment was wanting him at last. Something wet touched his fingers, and when
  he looked at them, they were red. "B-A-R-M-Y. You ought to 'ave a
  nurse..."</p>

  <p>Then once again coherent thought failed him&mdash;utter physical weakness
  gripped him&mdash;he lay comatose, shuddering, and crying softly over he knew
  not what. The sweat was pouring down his face from the heat of the gas
  helmet, but still he held the valve between his teeth, breathing in through
  the nose and out through the mouth as he had been told. It was automatic,
  involuntary; he couldn't think, he only remembered certain things by
  instinct.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a high explosive shell burst near him&mdash;quite close: and a
  mass of earth crashed down on his legs and back, half burying him. He
  whimpered feebly, and after a while dragged himself free. But the action
  brought him close to that silent figure, with the ripped up back...</p>

  <p>"You ought to 'ave a nurse..." Why? Gawd above&mdash;why? Wasn't he as
  good a man as that there dead corporal? Wasn't he one of the regiment too?
  And now the Corporal couldn't do anything, but he&mdash;well, he hadn't got
  no hole torn out of his back. It wasn't his blood that lay stagnant, filling
  the little holes at the bottom of the trench...</p>

  <p>Kipling came back to him&mdash;feebly, from another world. The dreamer was
  dreaming once again.</p>

  <p class="poem">"If your officer's dead and the sergeants look white,<br>
  Remember it's ruin to run from a fight."</p>Run! Who was talking of running?
  He was going to save the regiment&mdash;once he could think clearly again.
  Everything was hazy just for the moment.

  <p class="poem">"And wait for supports like a soldier."</p>

  <p>But there weren't no supports, and the telephone wire was broken&mdash;the
  wire he'd tripped over as he came up. Until it was mended there wouldn't be
  any supports&mdash;until it was mended&mdash;until&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>With a choking cry he lurched to his feet: and staggering, running,
  falling down, the dreamer crossed the open. A tearing pain through his left
  arm made him gasp, but he got there&mdash;got there and collapsed. He
  couldn't see very well, so he tore off his gas helmet, and, peering round, at
  last saw the wire. And the wire was indeed cut. Why the throbbing brain
  should have imagined it would be cut <i>there</i>, I know not; perhaps he
  associated it particularly with the pollard&mdash;and after all he was the
  Company Idiot. But it was cut there, I am glad to say; let us not begrudge
  him his little triumph. He found one end, and some few feet off he saw the
  other. With infinite difficulty he dragged himself towards it. Why did he
  find it so terribly hard to move? He couldn't see clearly; everything somehow
  was getting hazy and red. The roar of the shells seemed muffled
  strangely&mdash;far-away, indistinct. He pulled at the wire, and it came
  towards him; pulled again, and the two ends met. Then he slipped back against
  the pollard, the two ends grasped in his right hand...</p>

  <p>The regiment was safe at last. The officer would not have to kick the
  telephone again. The Idiot had made good. And into his heart there came a
  wonderful peace.</p>

  <p>There was a roaring in his ears; lights danced before his eyes; strange
  shapes moved in front of him. Then, of a sudden, out of the gathering
  darkness a great white light seared his senses, a deafening crash overwhelmed
  him, a sharp stabbing blow struck his head. The roaring ceased, and a limp
  figure slipped down and lay still, with two ends of wire grasped tight in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"They are going to relieve us to-night, Sergeant-Major." The two men with
  tired eyes faced one another in the Major's dugout The bombardment was over,
  and the dying rays of a blood-red sun glinted through the door. "I think they
  took it well."</p>

  <p>"They did, sir&mdash;very well."</p>

  <p>"What are the casualties? Any idea?"</p>

  <p>"Somewhere about seventy or eighty, sir&mdash;but I don't know the exact
  numbers."</p>

  <p>"As soon as it's dark I'm going back to headquarters. Captain Standish
  will take command."</p>

  <p>"That there Meyrick is reported missing, sir."</p>

  <p>"Missing! He'll turn up somewhere&mdash;if he hasn't been hit."</p>

  <p>"Probably walked into the German trenches by mistake," grunted the
  C.-S.-M. dispassionately, and retired. Outside the dugout men had moved the
  corporal; but the red pools still remained&mdash;stagnant at the bottom of
  the trench...</p>

  <p>"Well, you're through all right now, Major," said a voice in the doorway,
  and an officer with the white and blue brassard of the signals came in and
  sat down. "There are so many wires going back that have been laid at odd
  times, that it's difficult to trace them in a hurry." He gave a ring on the
  telephone, and in a moment the thin, metallic voice of the man at the other
  end broke the silence.</p>

  <p>"All right. Just wanted to make sure we were through. Ring off."</p>

  <p>"I remember kicking that damn thing this morning when I found we were cut
  off," remarked Seymour, with a weary smile. "Funny how childish one is at
  times."</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;but natural. This war's damnable." The two men fell silent.
  "I'll have a bit of an easy here," went on the signal officer after a while,
  "and then go down with you."</p>

  <p>A few hours later the two men clambered out of the back of the trench.
  "It's easier walking, and I know every stick," remarked the Major. "Make for
  that stunted pollard first."</p>

  <p>Dimly the tree stood outlined against the sky&mdash;a conspicuous mark and
  signpost. It was the signal officer who tripped over it first&mdash;that
  huddled quiet body, and gave a quick ejaculation. "Somebody caught it here,
  poor devil. Look out&mdash;duck."</p>

  <p>A flare shot up into the night, and by its light the two motionless
  officers close to the pollard looked at what they had found.</p>

  <p>"How the devil did he get here!" muttered Seymour. "It's one of my
  men."</p>

  <p>"Was he anywhere near you when you kicked the telephone?" asked the other,
  and his voice was a little hoarse.</p>

  <p>"He may have been&mdash;I don't know. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Look at his right hand." From the tightly clenched fingers two broken
  ends of wire stuck out.</p>

  <p>"Poor lad." The Major bit his lip. "Poor lad&mdash;I wonder. They called
  him the Company Idiot. Do you think...?"</p>

  <p>"I think he came out to find the break in the wire," said the other
  quietly. "And in doing so he found the answer to the big riddle."</p>

  <p>"I knew he'd make good&mdash;I knew it all along. He used to dream of big
  things&mdash;something big for the regiment."</p>

  <p>"And he's done a big thing, by Jove," said the signal officer gruffly,
  "for it's the motive that counts. And he couldn't know that he'd got the
  wrong wire."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"When 'e doesn't forget, 'e does things wrong."</p>

  <p>As I said, both the Sergeant-Major and his officer proved right according
  to their own lights.</p>

  <h2><a name="story5"
     id="story5"></a>V. &mdash; JAMES HENRY</h2>

  <h3>Previously published in <i>Men, Women and Guns</i></h3>

  <p class="first">James Henry was the sole remaining son of his mother, and
  she was a widow. His father, some twelve months previously, had inadvertently
  encountered a motor-car travelling at great speed, and had forthwith been
  laid to rest. His sisters&mdash;whom James Henry affected to
  despise&mdash;had long since left the parental roof and gone to seek their
  Fortunes in the great world; while his brothers had in all cases died violent
  deaths, following in the steps of their lamented father. In fact, as I said,
  James Henry was alone in the world saving only for his mother: and as she'd
  married again since his father's death he felt that his responsibility so far
  as she was concerned was at an end. In fact, he frequently cut her when he
  met her about the house.</p>

  <p>Relations had become particularly strained after this second matrimonial
  venture. An aristocrat of the most unbending description himself, he had been
  away during the period of her courtship&mdash;otherwise, no doubt, he would
  have protected his father's stainless escutcheon. As it was, he never quite
  recovered from the shock.</p>

  <p>It was at breakfast one morning that he heard the news. Lady Monica told
  him as she handed him his tea. "James Henry," she remarked reproachfully,
  "your mother is a naughty woman." True to his aristocratic principle of
  stoical calm he continued to consume his morning beverage. There were times
  when the mention of his mother bored him to extinction. "A very naughty
  woman," she continued. "Dad"&mdash;she addressed a man who had just come into
  the room&mdash;"it's occurred."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;have they come?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;last night. Five."</p>

  <p>"Are they good ones?"</p>

  <p>Lady Alice laughed. "I was just telling James Henry what I thought of his
  Family when you came in. I'm afraid Harriet Emily is incorrigible."</p>

  <p>"Look at James!" exclaimed the Earl&mdash;"he's spilled his tea all over
  the carpet." He was inspecting the dishes on the sideboard as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"He always does. His whiskers dribble. Jervis tells me that he thinks
  Harriet Emily must have&mdash;er&mdash;flirted with a most undesirable
  acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"Oh! has she?" Her father opened the morning paper and started to enjoy
  his breakfast. "We must drown 'em, my dear, drown&mdash;&mdash; Hullo! the
  Russians have crossed the&mdash;&mdash;" It sounded like an explosion in a
  soda-water factory, and James Henry protested.</p>

  <p>"Quite right, Henry. He oughtn't to do it at breakfast. It doesn't really
  make any one any happier. Did <i>you</i> know about your mother? Now don't
  gobble your food." Lady Monica held up an admonishing finger. "Four of your
  brothers and sisters are more or less respectable, James, but there's
  <i>one</i>&mdash;there's one that is distinctly reminiscent of a dachshund.
  Oh! 'Arriet, 'Arriet&mdash;I'm ashamed of you."</p>

  <p>James Henry sneezed heavily and got down from the table. Always a perfect
  gentleman, he picked up the crumbs round his chair, and even went so far as
  to salvage a large piece of sausage skin which had slipped on to the floor.
  Then, full of rectitude and outwardly unconcerned, he retired to a corner
  behind a cupboard and earnestly contemplated a little hole in the floor.</p>

  <p>Outwardly calm&mdash;yes: that at least was due to the memory of his
  blue-blooded father. But inwardly, he seethed. With his head on one side he
  alternately sniffed and blew as he had done regularly every morning for the
  past two months. His father's wife the mother of a sausage-dog! Incredible!
  It must have been that miserable fat beast who lived at the Pig and Whistle.
  The insolence&mdash;the inconceivable impertinence of such an unsightly,
  corpulent traducer daring to ally himself with One of the Fox Terriers. He
  growled slightly in his disgust, and three mice inside the wall laughed
  gently. But&mdash;still, the girls are ever frail. He blushed slightly at
  some recollection, and realised that he must make allowances. But a sausage
  dog! Great Heavens!</p>

  <p>"James&mdash;avançons, mon brave." Lady Monica was standing in the window.
  "We will hie us to the village. Dad, don't forget that our branch of the
  Federated Association of Women War Workers are drilling here this
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens! my dear girl&mdash;is it?" Her father gazed at her in
  alarm. "I think&mdash;er&mdash;I think I shall have to&mdash;er&mdash;run up
  to Town&mdash;er&mdash;this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd have to, old dear. In fact, I've ordered the car for you.
  Come along, Henry&mdash;we must go and get a boy scout to be bandaged."</p>

  <p>James Henry gave one last violently facial contortion at the entrance of
  the mouse's lair, and rose majestically to his feet. If she wanted to go out,
  he fully realised that he must go with her: Emily would have to wait. He
  would go round later and see his poor misguided mother and reason with her;
  but just at present the girl was his principal duty. She generally asked his
  advice on various things when they went for a walk, and the least he could do
  was to pretend to be interested at any rate.</p>

  <p>Apparently this morning she was in need of much counsel and help. Having
  arrived at a clearing in the wood, on the way to the village, she sat down on
  the fallen trunk of a tree, and addressed him.</p>

  <p>"James&mdash;what am I to do? Derek is coming this afternoon before he
  goes back to France. What shall I tell him, Henry&mdash;what <i>shall</i> I
  tell him? Because I know he'll ask me again. Thank you, old man, but you're
  not very helpful, and I'd much sooner you kept it yourself."</p>

  <p>Disgustedly James Henry removed the carcase of a field mouse he had just
  procured, and resigned himself to the inevitable.</p>

  <p>"I'm fond of him; I like him&mdash;in fact at times more than like him.
  But is it the <i>real</i> thing? Now what do you think, James
  Henry?&mdash;tell me all that is in your mind. Ought I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was then that he gave his celebrated rendering of a young typhoon,
  owing to the presence of a foreign substance&mdash;to wit, a fly&mdash;in a
  ticklish spot on his nose.</p>

  <p>"You think that, do you? Well, perhaps you're right. Come on, my lad, we
  must obtain the victim for this afternoon. I wonder if those little boys like
  it? To do some good and kindly action each day&mdash;that's their motto,
  James. And as one person to another you must admit that to be revived from
  drowning, resuscitated from fainting, brought to from an epileptic fit, and
  have two knees, an ankle, and a collarbone set at the same time is some good
  action even for a boy scout."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was not until after lunch that James Henry paid his
  promised call on his mother. Maturer considerations had but strengthened his
  resolve to make allowances. After all, these things do happen in the best
  families. He was, indeed, prepared to be magnanimous and forgive; he was even
  prepared to be interested; the only thing he wasn't prepared for was the
  nasty bite he got on his ear. That settled it. It was then that he finally
  washed his hands of his undutiful parent. As he told her, he felt more sorrow
  than anger; he should have realised that anyone who could have dealings with
  a sausage-hound must be dead to all sense of decency&mdash;and that the only
  thing he asked was that in the future she would conceal the fact that they
  were related.</p>

  <p>Then he left her&mdash;and trotting round to the front of the house, found
  great activity in progress on the lawn.</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens! James Henry, do they often do this?" With a shout of joy he
  recognised the speaker. And having told him about Harriet, and blown heavily
  at a passing spider and then trodden on it, he sat down beside the soldier on
  the steps. The game on the lawn at first sight looked dull; and he only
  favoured it with a perfunctory glance. In fact, what on earth there was in it
  to make the soldier beside him shake and shake while the tears periodically
  rolled down his face was quite beyond Henry.</p>

  <p>The principal player seemed to be a large man&mdash;also in
  khaki&mdash;with a loud voice. Up to date he had said nothing but "Now then,
  ladies," at intervals, and in a rising crescendo. Then it all became
  complicated.</p>

  <p>"Now then, ladies, when I says Number&mdash;you numbers from Right to Left
  in an heven tone of voice. The third lady from the left 'as no lady behind
  'er&mdash;seeing as we're a hodd number. She forms the blank file. Yes, you,
  mum&mdash;you, I means."</p>

  <p>"What are you pointing at me for, my good man?" The Vicar's wife suddenly
  realised she was being spoken to. "Am I doing anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"No, mum, no. Not this time. I was only saying as you 'ave no one behind
  you."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I'll go there at once&mdash;I'm so sorry." She retired to the rear
  rank. "Dear Mrs. Goodenough, <i>did</i> I tread upon your foot?&mdash;so
  clumsy of me! Oh, what is that man saying now? But you've just told me to
  come here. You did nothing of the sort? How rude!"</p>

  <p>But as I said, the game did not interest James Henry, so he wandered away
  and played in some bushes. There were distinct traces of a recently moving
  mole which was far more to the point. Then having found&mdash;after a
  diligent search and much delight in pungent odours&mdash;that the mole was a
  has-been, our Henry disappeared for a space. And far be it from me to
  disclose where he went: his intentions were always strictly honourable.</p>

  <p>When he appeared again the Earl had just returned from London, and was
  talking to the tall soldier-man. The Women War Workers had departed, and, as
  James Henry approached, his mistress came out and joined the two men.</p>

  <p>"Have those dreadful women gone, my dear?" asked the Earl as he saw
  her.</p>

  <p>"You're very rude, Dad. The Federated Association of the W.W.W. is a very
  fine body of patriotic women. What did you think of our drill, Derek?"</p>

  <p>"Wonderful, Monica. Quite the most wonderful thing I've ever seen." The
  soldier solemnly offered her a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"You men are all jealous. We're coming out to France as V.A.D.'s
  soon."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Derek&mdash;you ought to have seen their first drill. In one
  corner of the lawn that poor devil of a sergeant with his face a shiny purple
  alternately sobbed and bellowed like a bull&mdash;while twenty-seven W.W.W.'s
  tied themselves into a knot like a Rugby football scrum, and told one another
  how they'd done it. It was the most heart-rending sight I've ever seen."</p>

  <p>"Dear old Dad!" The girl blew a cloud of smoke. "You told it better last
  time."</p>

  <p>"Don't interrupt, Monica. The final tableau&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which one are you going to tell him, dear? The one where James Henry bit
  the Vicar's wife in the leg, or the one where the sergeant with a choking cry
  of 'Double, damn you!' fell fainting into the rhododendron bush?"</p>

  <p>"I think the second is the better," remarked the soldier pensively. "Dogs
  always bite the Vicar's wife's leg. Not a hobby I should personally take up,
  but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They all laughed. "Now run indoors, old 'un, and tell John to get you a
  mixed Vermouth&mdash;I want to talk to Derek." The girl gently pushed her
  father towards the open window.</p>

  <p>It was at that particular moment in James Henry's career that, having
  snapped at a wasp and partially killed it, he inadvertently sat on the
  carcase by mistake. As he explained to Harriet Emily afterwards, it wasn't so
  much the discomfort of the proceeding which annoyed him, as the unfeeling
  laughter of the spectators. And it was only when she'd bitten him in the
  other ear that he remembered he had disowned her that very afternoon.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">But elsewhere, though he was quite unaware of the fact,
  momentous decisions as to his future were being taken. The Earl had gone in
  to get his mixed Vermouth, and outside his daughter and the soldier-man sat
  and talked. It was fragmentary, disjointed&mdash;the talk of old friends with
  much in common. Only in the man's voice there was that suppressed note which
  indicates things more than any mere words. Monica heard it and
  sighed&mdash;she'd heard it so often before in his voice. James Henry had
  heard it too during a previous talk&mdash;one which he had graced with his
  presence&mdash;and had gone to the extent of discussing it with a friend. On
  this occasion he had been gently dozing on the man's knee, when suddenly he
  had been rudely awakened. In his dreams he had heard her say, "Dear old
  Derek&mdash;I'm afraid it's No. You see, I'm not sure;" which didn't seem
  much to make a disturbance about.</p>

  <p>"Would you believe it," he remarked later, "but as she spoke the
  soldier-man's grip tightened on my neck till I was almost choked."</p>

  <p>"What did you do?" asked his Friend, a disreputable "long-dog." "Did you
  bite him?"</p>

  <p>"I did not." James Henry sniffed. "It was not a biting moment. Tact was
  required. I just gave a little cough, and instantly he took his hand away.
  'Old man,' he whispered to me&mdash;she'd left us&mdash;'I'm sorry. I didn't
  mean to&mdash;I wasn't thinking.' So I licked his hand to show him I
  understood."</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean. I'm generally there when my bloke comes out of
  prison, and he always kicks me. But it's meant kindly."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact that is not what I mean&mdash;though I daresay your
  experiences on such matters are profound." James was becoming blue-blooded.
  "The person who owns you, and who is in the habit of going
  to&mdash;er&mdash;prison, no doubt shows his affection for you in that way.
  And very suitable too. But the affair to which I alluded is quite different.
  The soldier-man is almost as much in my care as the girl. And so I know his
  feelings. At the time, he was suffering though why I don't understand; and
  therefore it was up to me to suffer with him. It helped him."</p>

  <p>"H'm," the lurcher grunted. "Daresay you're right. What about a trip to
  the gorse? I haven't seen a rabbit for some time."</p>

  <p>And if Henry had not sat on the wasp, his neck might again have been
  squeezed that evening. As it was, the danger period was over by the time he
  reappeared and jumped into the girl's lap. Not only had the sixth proposal
  been gently turned down&mdash;but James's plans for the near future had been
  settled for him in a most arbitrary manner.</p>

  <p>"Well, old man, how's the tail?" laughed the soldier. James Henry
  yawned&mdash;the subject seemed a trifle personal even amongst old friends.
  "Have you heard you're coming with me to France?"</p>

  <p>"And you must bring him to me as soon as I get over," cried the girl.</p>

  <p>"At once, dear lady. I'll ask for special leave, and if necessary an
  armistice."</p>

  <p>"Won't you bark at the Huns, my cherub?" She laughed and got up. "Go to
  your uncle&mdash;I'm going to dress."</p>

  <p>What happened then was almost more than even the most long-suffering
  terrier could stand. He was unceremoniously bundled into his uncle's arms by
  his mistress, and at the same moment she bent down. A strange noise was heard
  such as he had frequently noted, coming from the top of his own head, when
  his mistress was in an affectionate mood&mdash;a peculiar form of exercise he
  deduced, which apparently amused some people. But the effect on the soldier
  was electrical. He sprang out of his chair with a
  shout&mdash;"Monica&mdash;you little devil&mdash;come back," and James Henry
  fell winded to the floor. But a flutter of white disappearing indoors was the
  only answer...</p>

  <p>"She's not sure, James, my son&mdash;she's not sure." The man pulled out
  his cigarette case and contemplated him thoughtfully. "And how the deuce are
  we to make her sure? I want it, and her father wants it, and so does she if
  she only knew it. They're the devil, James Henry&mdash;they're the
  devil."</p>

  <p>But his hearer did not want philosophy; he wanted his tummy rubbed. He lay
  with one eye closed, his four paws turned up limply towards the sky, and
  sighed gently. Never before had the suggestion failed; enthusiastic admirers
  had always taken the hint gladly, and he had graciously allowed them the
  pleasure. But this time&mdash;horror upon horror&mdash;not only was there no
  result, but in a dreamy, contemplative manner the soldier actually deposited
  his used and still warm match carefully on the spot where James Henry's wind
  had been. Naturally there was only one possible course open to him. He rose
  quietly, and left. It was only when he was thinking the matter over later
  that it struck him that his exit would have been more dignified if he hadn't
  sat down halfway across the lawn to scratch his right ear. It was more than
  likely that a completely false construction would be put on that simple
  action by anyone who didn't know he'd had words with Harriet Emily.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Thus James Henry&mdash;gentleman, at his country seat in
  England. I have gone out of my way to describe what may be taken as an
  average day in his life, in order to show him as he was before he went to
  France to be banished from the country&mdash;cashiered in disgrace a few
  weeks after his arrival. Which only goes to prove the change that war causes
  in even the most polished and courtly.</p>

  <p>I am told that the alteration for the worse started shortly after his
  arrival at the front. What did it I don't know&mdash;but he lost one whisker
  and a portion of an ear, thus giving him a somewhat lopsided appearance;
  though rakish withal. It may have been a detonator which went off as he ate
  it&mdash;it may have been foolish curiosity over a maxim&mdash;it may even
  have been due to the fact that he found a motor-bicycle standing still, what
  time it made strange provocative noises, and failed to notice that the back
  wheel was off the ground and rotating at a great pace.</p>

  <p>Whatever it was it altered James Henry. Not that it soured his
  temper&mdash;not at all; but it made him more reckless, less careful of
  appearances. He forgot the repose that stamps the caste of Vere de Vere, and
  a series of incidents occurred which tended to strain relations all
  round.</p>

  <p>There was the question of the three dead chickens, for instance. Had they
  disappeared decently and in order much might have been thought but nothing
  would have been known. But when they were deposited on their owner's
  doorstep, with James Henry mounting guard over the corpses himself, it was a
  little difficult to explain the matter away. That was the trouble&mdash;his
  sense of humour seemed to have become distorted.</p>

  <p>The pastime of hunting for rats in the sewers of Ypres cannot be too
  highly commended; but having got thoroughly wet in the process, James Henry's
  practice of depositing the rat and himself on the Adjutant's bed was open to
  grave criticism.</p>

  <p>But enough: these two instances were, I am sorry to state, but types of
  countless other regrettable episodes which caused the popularity of James
  Henry to wane.</p>

  <p>The final decree of death or banishment came when James had been in the
  country some seven weeks.</p>

  <p>On the day in question a dreadful shout was heard, followed by a flood of
  language which I will refrain from committing to print. And then the Colonel
  appeared in the door of his dug-out.</p>

  <p>"Where is that accursed idiot, Murgatroyd? Pass the word along for the
  damn fool."</p>

  <p>"'Urry up, Conky. The ole man's a-twittering for you." Murgatroyd emerged
  from a recess.</p>

  <p>"What's 'e want?"</p>

  <p>"I'd go and find out, cully. I think 'e's going to mention you in 'is
  will." At that moment a fresh outburst floated through the stillness.</p>

  <p>"Great 'Eavens!" Murgatroyd reluctantly rose to his feet. "So long, boys.
  Tell me mother she was in me thoughts up to the end." He paused outside the
  dug-out and then went manfully in. "You wanted me, sir."</p>

  <p>"Look at this, you blithering ass, look at this." The Colonel was
  searching through his Fortnum and Mason packing-case on the floor. "Great
  Heavens! and the caviar too&mdash;imbedded in the butter. Five defunct
  rodents in the brawn"&mdash;he threw each in turn at his servant, who dodged
  round the dug-out like a pea in a drum&mdash;"the marmalade and the pâté de
  fois gras inseparably mixed together, and the whole covered with a thick
  layer of disintegrating cigar."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't me, sir," Murgatroyd spoke in an aggrieved tone.</p>

  <p>"I didn't suppose it was, you fool." The Colonel straightened himself and
  glared at his hapless minion. "Great Heavens! there's another rat on my
  hairbrush."</p>

  <p>"One of the same five, sir. It ricocheted off my face." With a magnificent
  nonchalance his servant threw it out of the door. "I think, sir, it must be
  James 'Enry."</p>

  <p>"Who the devil is James Henry?"</p>

  <p>"Sir Derek Temple's little dawg, sir."</p>

  <p>"Indeed." The Colonel's tone was ominous. "Go round and ask Sir Derek
  Temple to be good enough to come and see me at once."</p>

  <p>What happened exactly at that interview I cannot say; although I
  understand that James Henry considered an absurd fuss had been made about a
  trifle. In fact he found it so difficult to lie down with any comfort that
  night that he missed much of his master's conversation with him.</p>

  <p>"You've topped it, James, you've put the brass hat on. The old man
  threatens to turn out a firing party if he ever sees you again."</p>

  <p>James feigned sleep: this continual harping on what was over and done with
  he considered the very worst of form. Even if he had put the caviar in the
  butter and his foot in the marmalade&mdash;well, hang it all&mdash;what then?
  He'd presented the old buster with five dead rats, which was more than he'd
  do for a lot of people.</p>

  <p>"In fact, James, you are not popular, my boy&mdash;and I shudder to think
  what Monica will do with you when she gets you. She's come over, you may be
  pleased to hear, Henry. She is V.A.D.-ing at a charming hospital that
  overlooks the sea. James, why can't I go sick&mdash;and live for a space at
  that charming hospital that overlooks the sea? Think of it: here am I,
  panting to have my face washed by her, panting&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>For a moment he rhapsodised in silence. "Breakfast in bed, poached egg in
  the bed: oh! James, my boy, and she probably never even thinks of me."</p>

  <p>He took a letter out of his pocket and held it under the light of the
  candle. "'Not much to do at present, but delightful weather. The hospital is
  nearly empty, though there's one perfect dear who is almost fit&mdash;a Major
  in some Highland regiment.'</p>

  <p>"Listen to that, James. Some great raw-boned, red-kneed Scotchman, and she
  calls him a perfect dear!" His listener blew resignedly and again composed
  himself to slumber.</p>

  <p>"'How is James behaving? I'd love to see the sweet pet again.' Sweet pet:
  yes&mdash;my boy&mdash;you look it. 'Do you remember how annoyed he was when
  I put him in your arms that afternoon at home?' Do you hear that,
  James?&mdash;do I remember? Monica, you adorable soul..." He relapsed into
  moody thought.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At what moment during that restless night the idea actually
  came I know not. Possibly a diabolical chuckle on the part of James Henry,
  who was hunting in his dreams, goaded him to desperation. But it is an
  undoubted fact that when Sir Derek Temple rose the next morning he had
  definitely determined to embark on the adventure which culminated in the
  tragedy of the cat, the General, and James. The latter is reputed to regard
  the affair as quite trifling and unworthy of the fierce glare of publicity
  that beat upon it. The cat, has, or rather had, different views.</p>

  <p>Now, be it known to those who live in England that it is one thing to say
  in an airy manner, as Derek had said to Lady Monica, that he would come and
  see her when she landed in France; it is another to do it. But to a
  determined and unprincipled man nothing is impossible; and though it would be
  the height of indiscretion for me to hint even at the methods he used to
  attain his ends, it is a certain fact that in the afternoon of the second day
  following the episode of the five rodents he found himself at a certain
  seaport town with James Henry as the other member of the party. And having
  had his hair cut, and extricated his companion from a street brawl, he hired
  a motor and drove into the country.</p>

  <p>Now, Derek Temple's knowledge of hospitals and their ways was not
  profound. He had a hazy idea that on arriving at the portals he would send in
  his name, and that in due course he could consume a tête-à-tête tea with
  Monica in her private boudoir. He rehearsed the scene in his mind: the quiet,
  cutting reference to Highlanders who failed to understand the official
  position of nurses&mdash;the certainty that this particular one was a
  scoundrel: the fact that, on receiving her letter, he had at once rushed off
  to protect her.</p>

  <p>And as he got to this point the car turned into the gates of a palatial
  hotel and stopped by the door. James Henry jumped through the open window,
  and his master followed him up the steps.</p>

  <p>"Is Lady Monica Travers at home; I mean&mdash;er&mdash;is she in the
  hospital?" He addressed an R.A.M.C. sergeant in the entrance.</p>

  <p>"No dawgs allowed in the 'ospital, sir." The scandalised N.C.O. glared at
  James Henry, who was furiously growling at a hot-air grating in the floor.
  "You must get 'im out at once, sir: we're being inspected to-day."</p>

  <p>"Heel, James, heel. He'll be quite all right, Sergeant. Just find out,
  will you, about Lady Monica Travers?"</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon, sir, but are you a patient?"</p>

  <p>"Patient&mdash;of course I'm not a patient. Do I look like a patient?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, there ain't no visiting allowed when the sisters is on
  duty."</p>

  <p>"What? But it's preposterous. Do you mean to say I can't see her unless
  I'm a patient? Why, man, I've got to go back in an hour."</p>

  <p>"Very sorry, sir&mdash;but no visiting allowed. Very strict 'ere, and as I
  says we're full of brass 'ats to-day."</p>

  <p>For a moment Derek was nonplussed; this was a complication on which he had
  not reckoned.</p>

  <p>"But look here, Sergeant, you know..." and even as he spoke he looked
  upstairs and beheld Lady Monica. Unfortunately she had not seen him, and the
  situation was desperate. Forcing James Henry into the arms of the outraged
  N.C.O., he rushed up the stairs and followed her.</p>

  <p>"Derek!" The girl stopped in amazement. "What in the world are you doing
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Monica, my dear, I've come to see you. Tell me that you don't really love
  that damn Scotchman."</p>

  <p>An adorable smile spread over her face. "You idiot! I don't love anyone.
  My work fills my life."</p>

  <p>"Rot! You said in your letter you had nothing to do at present. Monica,
  take me somewhere where I can make love to you."</p>

  <p>"I shall do nothing of the sort. In the first place you aren't allowed
  here at all; and in the second I don't want to be made love to."</p>

  <p>"And in the third," said Derek grimly, as the sound of a procession
  advancing down a corridor came from round the corner, "you're being inspected
  to-day, and that&mdash;if I mistake not&mdash;is the great pan-jan-drum
  himself."</p>

  <p>"Oh! good Heavens. Derek, I'd forgotten. Do go, for goodness' sake.
  Run&mdash;I shall be sacked."</p>

  <p>"I shall not go. As the great man himself rounds that corner I shall kiss
  you with a loud trumpeting noise.'</p>

  <p>"You brute! Oh! what shall I do?&mdash;there they are. Come in here." She
  grabbed him by the wrist and dragged him into a small deserted sitting-room
  close by.</p>

  <p>"You darling," he remarked and promptly kissed her. "Monica, dear, you
  must listen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sit down, you idiot. I'm sure they saw me. You must pretend you're a
  patient just come in. I know I shall be sacked. The General is dreadfully
  particular. Put this thermometer in your mouth. Quick, give me your
  hand&mdash;I must take your pulse."</p>

  <p>"I think," said a voice outside the door, "that I saw&mdash;er&mdash;a
  patient being brought into one of these rooms."</p>

  <p>"Surely not, sir. These rooms are all empty." The door opened and the
  cavalcade paused. "Er&mdash;Lady Monica...really."</p>

  <p>"A new patient, Colonel," she remarked. "I am just taking his
  temperature." Derek, his eyes partially closed, lay back in a chair,
  occasionally uttering a slight groan.</p>

  <p>"The case looks most interesting." The General came and stood beside him.
  "Most interesting. Have you&mdash;er&mdash;diagnosed the symptoms, sister?"
  His lips were twitching suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Not yet, General. The pulse is normal&mdash;and the
  temperature"&mdash;she looked at the thermometer&mdash;"is&mdash;good
  gracious me! have you kept it properly under your tongue?" She turned to
  Derek, who nodded feebly. "The temperature is only 93." She looked at the
  group in an awestruck manner.</p>

  <p>"Most remarkable," murmured the General. "One feels compelled to wonder
  what it would have been if he'd had the right end in his mouth." Derek
  emitted a hollow groan. "And where do you feel it worst, my dear boy?"
  continued the great man, gazing at him through his eyeglass.</p>

  <p>"Dyspepsia, sir," he whispered feebly. "Dreadful dyspepsia. I can't sleep,
  I&mdash;er&mdash;Good Lord!" His eyes opened, his voice rose, and with a
  fixed stare of horror he gazed at the door. Through it with due solemnity
  came James Henry holding in his mouth a furless and very dead cat. He
  advanced to the centre of the group&mdash;laid it at the General's
  feet&mdash;and having sneezed twice sat down and contemplated his handiwork:
  his tail thumping the floor feverishly in anticipation of well-merited
  applause.</p>

  <p>It was possibly foolish, but, as Derek explained afterwards to Monica, the
  situation had passed beyond him. He arose and confronted the General, who was
  surveying the scene coldly, and with a courtly exclamation of "Your cat, I
  believe, sir," he passed from the room.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The conclusion of this dreadful drama may be given in three
  short sentences.</p>

  <p>The first was spoken by the General. "Let it be buried." And it was
  so.</p>

  <p>The second was whispered by Lady Monica&mdash;later. "Darling, I had to
  <i>say</i> we were engaged: it looked so peculiar." And it was even more
  so.</p>

  <p>The third was snorted by James Henry. "First I'm beaten and then I'm
  kissed. Damn all cats!"</p>

  <h2><a id="story6"
     name="story6"></a>VI. &mdash; A FIRE IN BILLETS<br>
  A Farm near Bailleul, December 1914</h2>

  <h3>Previously published in <i>Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.</i></h3>

  <p class="first">"'Tis a fine body of men that they are," remarked Sergeant
  Cassidy to me, as I sat with him one day in the house where he was slowly
  recovering from the wound in his foot, which had caused his temporary absence
  from the plains of Flanders. As he spoke his eyes followed the fire engine,
  drawn by two grand white horses, disappearing in the distance. The bell was
  still clanging faintly, as he absent-mindedly felt in his pocket, to find
  that as usual he'd left his cigarettes upstairs.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a fine body of men that they are," he remarked again, as he took one
  of mine. "But, by jabers! sir, seeing them going up the street there, brings
  to my mind the last fire that I was present at, over yonder." On this
  occasion he indicated Northumberland with a large hand; but, no matter.</p>

  <p>"You'll mind," he went on after a reflective pause, "that those farms over
  the water are not what you would call the equals of Buckingham Palace for
  comfort. The majority of them are built in the same manner all over the
  country, and when you've seen one you've seen the lot. There's the farm
  itself, in which reside the owners and the officers. The officers have a room
  to themselves, but in these farms all the rooms lead into one another. Mr
  Tracey &mdash; you mind him, sir, the officer with the spectacles, fat he was
  &mdash; he was powerful set on washing, which is not to be encouraged in that
  trying weather; and he was rendered extremely irritated by the habit of the
  ladies of the farm, who would walk through the room when he was in his
  bath.</p>

  <p>"I mind one morning, perishing cold it was, when I came up to the kitchen
  to see him, and I looked through the door. Two of the old women of the farm
  were in the room, and they'd left both the doors open, while they had a bit
  of a set-to about something. Poor Mr Tracey was sitting in his bath, shouting
  at them to go out of the room and shut the door. He'd lost his spectacles,
  and his towel had fallen in the bath, and the draught was causing him great
  uneasiness. 'Twas a terrible example of the dangers of washing in those
  parts."</p>

  <p>Sergeant Cassidy shook his head reflectively.</p>

  <p>"Still," he continued after a moment, "'twas of the farms I was speaking.
  They have most of them two barns which run perpendicular to the farmhouse, so
  that the three buildings enclose a sort of square yard in the middle of them.
  The barns are full of straw and hay and the like, and there it is that the
  men sleep, though 'tis well to climb up to the loft, and not to remain on the
  ground floor. The reason will be clear to you. These folks are very partial
  to pigs and hens and cows, and they are not particular where the animals go
  at night. When therefore I was roused from my sleep on one occasion by a
  fearful yell from below, I was not surprised.</p>

  <p>"'Mother of Heaven! 'tis the Germans,' says the man next to me, hunting
  for his gun.</p>

  <p>"''Tis nothing of the sort,' I says, as I looked through the loft. ''Tis
  the pig, going to bed, and she has sat on the face of Angus MacNab.'</p>

  <p>"'The dirty beast has sat on me face,' cried MacNab, as he saw me.</p>

  <p>"'Then 'tis the pig I'm concerned about,' says I, and I went back to my
  blankets. I have no patience with them Scotchmen."</p>

  <p>Sergeant Cassidy again availed himself of my cigarette case. "But where
  does the fire come in, Cassidy?" I asked, as he lit up.</p>

  <p>"I am just coming to that, sir. As you can imagine, the soldier will not
  stop his smoking because he is in the middle of hay and straw. It is too much
  to ask of any man. There are strict orders about it, of course, but &mdash;
  well, an officer like you will understand, sir. One day &mdash; it was about
  eleven o'clock in the morning &mdash; one of the men says to me, 'Look at the
  barn.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis fired,' I cried, and there was smoke coming out at the top of the
  thatching. 'Run, ye blackguards, run. It's water and buckets we'll be
  wanting.'</p>

  <p>"The first man in was the dirty schemer O'Toole, him that had been excused
  duty that very morning by the doctor for gout in the foot.</p>

  <p>"'I have my bull's-eyes saved,' he says to me as I came up.</p>

  <p>"'You flat-faced malingerer,' says I, 'you have fatigues for a month as
  well.'</p>

  <p>"And then the officers came out. ''Tis fired, it is,' I says to the Major.
  Do you recall the Major, sir. A terrible sarcastic man he was &mdash; with an
  eyeglass.</p>

  <p>"He puts it in his eye as I spoke. 'I didn't imagine the damn'd thing was
  frostbitten,' he says. 'Who's the fool who did it?'</p>

  <p>"Then the boys got the water going. We had a ladder placed up to the loft,
  and we handed the buckets up to the men above. The lads kept a chain of full
  buckets on the move from hand to hand. But it was hopeless from the
  start.</p>

  <p>"'Get the animals out, boys,' I shouts.</p>

  <p>"Then the fun began. The old women were out wringing their hands and
  weeping, and the old farmer was shouting to the interpreter, with a little
  pig under each arm. The interpreter goes up to the Major, and tells him that
  the farmer said there was a fire engine in the village. So the Major he sends
  off one of the officers to get it. Meantime one of the pigs had knocked down
  the old women, and then got entangled in their skirts. When that little
  box-up came to rest in the middle of the refuse pit, the skirts were on the
  pig. Oh! 'twas great. The fair at Ballygoyle was not in it. Then Mr Tracey he
  climbs up the ladder to the loft, and gets an empty bucket in the chest, as
  they threw it out.</p>

  <p>"''Tis hopeless, sir,' he says to the Major when he could again speak, for
  the wind he had lost.</p>

  <p>"So the Major orders all the men out of the barn, and we started pouring
  water on the house to keep it from spreading. And then after about an hour
  the fire engine arrived. 'Twas the most amazing contraption you ever did see.
  'Twas an old tub on two wheels, with a hand-pump attached, and it had been
  brought by three old gentlemen with grey hair &mdash; one of them with a
  wooden leg. 'Twas the local fire brigade &mdash; the rest had gone to the
  war. The old man with the wooden leg took on something terrible. He hopped
  about crying 'Oh! Oh!' and we thought he was hurt till the interpreter said
  he wanted the tub filled with water. Just as we had it filled the old pig
  knocked it over, and we had to fill it again. A terrible machine it was! When
  it was filled, those of the lads who could speak for laughter started to
  pump, while one of the old gentlemen took the nozzle, and climbed up the roof
  of the farmhouse, that he might the better direct the water. He had his thumb
  over the end of the nozzle to get the pressure up, and 'twas a powerful thumb
  he had, for the hose burst near the Major, and the water took him in the
  stomach. The lads were pumping with a will, and in stepping back the Major
  overbalanced and fell into the refuse pit in the centre of the courtyard. Oh!
  a terrible sight he was as he got up. All the men spent the afternoon looking
  for his eyeglass. And then the old gentleman on the roof was overcome by the
  heat, and fell off, and was only saved from destruction by going into a tub
  of pigwash. 'Twas a great diversion, as, having his head downwards, he was
  nearly drowned."</p>

  <p>I could stand it no more, so I rose to go. "Were the people compensated,
  Cassidy?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"They will be, sir," he answered, "they will be &mdash; though it's my own
  belief the old ruffian of a farmer set light to it himself. 'Twas poor hay
  that he had, and he will be paid as if 'twas best quality."</p>

  <h2><a id="story7"
     name="story7"></a>VII. &mdash; MEDICAL INSPECTION<br>
  Cleanliness is Next to...</h2>

  <h3>Previously published in <i>Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.</i></h3>

  <p class="first">The other morning was not one of my best. Somehow in the
  days of peace I had always laboured under the delusion that, if ever we did
  go to war, we should at any rate enter simultaneously into an era when the
  ordnance cease from troubling and the doctors are at rest. So having found
  how great the delusion really was, my heart yearned for Sergeant Cassidy. His
  views on life in general, especially with regard to those branches of the
  Service whose mission in life is the annoyance of everyone else, would, I
  thought, be as balm to my anguished soul.</p>

  <p>I found him in bed. His foot had relapsed.</p>

  <p>"Cassidy," I said, as I handed him my cigarette case, "I am in trouble. A
  doctor has just inspected us, and was very put out to find the ration meat
  for the men floating in the soak-pit of a neighbouring ablution bench. It was
  not put there by my instructions, as I told him, but he was unappeasable.
  Again, a Board Inventory, the property of the Army Service Corps, has been
  defaced, in that false figures have been added by some person or persons
  unknown. Personally I suspect the solicitor, who is at present doing
  cook-mate, of having feloniously inserted the figures 94 opposite the item
  'Shovels, coal, ordinary. Mark 6A.' We have not, as you know, got 94 shovels,
  coal, ordinary, Mark 6A. We haven't got one. It has been lost, and personally
  I again suspect the solicitor: but the stout gentleman who was making his
  weekly or yearly inspection has already reported it to the Army Council. He
  gave me to understand that if we do lose the war, it will probably be owing
  to that Inventory Board." I sighed deeply and relapsed into silence.</p>

  <p>"'Tis always the same, sir," he answered kindly: I needed sympathy. "'Tis
  always the same. The great thing is to discover their little weaknesses
  before they come round to see one. Of course the circumstances you mention
  are peculiar. I doubt me that, even had you discovered their peculiarities,
  so to speak, you would have escaped entirely &mdash; for as you say, sir, the
  soak-pit is no place for the meat to rest in at all. Still, 'tis a most
  important thing, and should be looked into on all occasions of that
  nature.</p>

  <p>"I mind me now of a thing which took place some fortnight before I got the
  little souvenir in my foot. We were in billets; 'twas the billet of which I
  have already spoken, where the barn was burnt down. One day the doctor comes
  to me and says, 'Cassidy,' he says, 'it's inspected we'll be.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis not the first time that same thing has happened,' says I, 'and we
  will survive. Do not be uneasy, sir. 'Twill be all right.'</p>

  <p>"I should tell you that our doctor was not a soldier at all: one of those
  civilians, he was, who came in at the beginning. His principal duty when we
  was resting in billets was the obtaining of food and drink for the officers,
  at which same game, so I heard, he was hard to beat. One of them gentlemen
  who has a way with him: he would coax a bottle of the stuff out of a
  lime-kiln, and most of them cafés were worse than that after the boys had
  been there for a bit. A cheery gentleman he was, who always got mistakes in
  his returns. You mind them returns, sir &mdash; in triplicate they are
  generally, and he could not abide them same. Oh! there was a terrible box-up
  when he made a mistake on one occasion, and mixed up the number of orderlies
  that he had with the number of men that had been inoculated for the enteric.
  For he had but two orderlies, and one hundred and sixty of the boys had the
  inoculation taken.</p>

  <p>"Of course he was not used to inspections, but I told him 'twould be all
  right. 'Twas the chief of all the doctors was coming, he said, and as he
  always got his returns wrong, he was anxious that all should be well. So we
  went round together, and he poked his nose into all the places where the men
  slept, and the cook-houses, and the like. I turned them on to the cleaning
  up, and soon the smell was not quite so bad as usual. We had everything ready
  the night before, and the men had knocked off, when the doctor comes to me in
  a terrible state.</p>

  <p>"'Cassidy,' he says, 'we have the bath forgot.'</p>

  <p>"'Bath,' says I, 'what will we be wanting with a bath? Have not the boys
  their buckets? And it is not the Hotel Cecil that we have.'</p>

  <p>"'Cassidy,' he says, 'the chief doctor is the devil on a bath for the men.
  That and a tub in which to wash their clothes we must have, or it's lost I
  am. I heard just now 'twas the first thing he'd look for.'</p>

  <p>"'Bedad,' says I, 'if 'tis the peculiarity of the chief doctor we will get
  a bath, or my name is not Michael Cassidy. &mdash; O'Toole,' I shouts, 'you
  lazy blatherer, I'm wanting you.' 'Twas the scheming malingerer that had been
  excused duty for the gout in the foot, and had us all beat when we ran to the
  burning barn, to save his peppermint bull's-eyes. You mind I told you of that
  same O'Toole. I says when he comes, 'Hunt round and find a bath.'</p>

  <p>"'A bath!' says he, 'and where will I be finding that same?'</p>

  <p>"'Is it me that would be saving you that trouble?' I cries. 'The doctor
  wishes a bath; do not let me see your ugly face till you have one found.'</p>

  <p>"'I'm thinking,' says I, when he had gone, 'that if we cannot get a bath,
  it is a hole we might dig in the field, and line it with the waterproof
  sheets. They did that same, the squadron in the next farm, but owing to the
  difficulty of seeing which was hole and which was not when they had it filled
  with the water, the old sow fell in at the same time as the sergeant-major,
  and there was a terrible commotion.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis something better we must have, Cassidy,' he says. 'The chief doctor
  is a terrible man, and he has it against me that I told him in triplicate
  that I had one hundred and sixty orderlies.'</p>

  <p>"At that moment back comes O'Toole. 'I have it found,' he cries. 'There is
  a big tub yonder of metal, that they use for the pig-wash, and empty it
  is.'</p>

  <p>"'It will serve,' says I when I see it. 'Can ye paint, O'Toole?'</p>

  <p>"'I can that,' he says.</p>

  <p>"'There is a man with some whitewash,' I says, 'painting the farm. Get
  that same and write BATH upon that tub.'</p>

  <p>"'But the wash-tub,' cries the doctor. 'We have it forgot.'</p>

  <p>"'Is there another of them tubs, O'Toole?' I says.</p>

  <p>"'There is not,' he says. 'I have the farm searched.'</p>

  <p>"'What will we do?' cried the doctor. 'The chief doctor is a devil for
  wash-tubs; and, Cassidy,' he says coaxingly, 'there's that matter of the
  orderlies.' Oh! he had a way with him, had the doctor.</p>

  <p>"''Tis not I that will be failing you,' I cries, and I thinks for a
  moment. I looks at the tub, and then sudden-like I gets the idea.</p>

  <p>"''Tis big enough,' I says, 'tis plenty big. O'Toole,' I cries, 'O'Toole,
  ye blackguard, you will paint BATH as I have told you on this side of that
  tub, and on the other you will paint WASH-TUB. Do you follow me,
  O'Toole?'</p>

  <p>"'I do that,' he says, and goes off for the whitewash.</p>

  <p>"The doctor was gazing at me. 'What is the notion?' he says, 'for the
  chief doctor will not be deceived.'</p>

  <p>"'Leave it to me, sir,' I says: 'leave it to me,' for I had the scheme in
  my mind.</p>

  <p>"The next day I sent for O'Toole. 'You have it marked,' I says. 'That is
  good. Now listen while I tell you, you dirty malingerer. The chief doctor is
  inspecting us this day, and the devil he is on baths and washtubs. You will
  place the tub against the wall in the barn with the word BATH outwards. The
  chief doctor is coming at eleven, but it's late he may be. On the other hand
  he may be early. So at a quarter to eleven you will remove your clothes, and
  stand by the bath.'</p>

  <p>"'But, Sergeant!' he says.</p>

  <p>"'There is no but,' says I. 'When the chief doctor appears you will
  receive the signal from Angus MacNab, who will be at the door, and you will
  get into the water. You will get into the water, I say, and when the chief
  doctor comes in at the door you will pretend that you like it.'</p>

  <p>"'But it's dead I shall be!' he cries.</p>

  <p>"''Twill be no loss,' says I. Then I sends for six of the boys. 'The chief
  doctor is coming,' I says, 'and the devil he is on baths and wash-tubs. I
  have the bath fixed for O'Toole; but when I shall give the signal for which
  you will watch, you will rush in and seize the tub and carry it round to the
  other side of the barn, and put it against the wall with WASH-TUB showing. I
  will see the chief doctor goes round the other way; then when he appears you
  will be washing your socks. There will be water in it from the bath of
  O'Toole.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis only one pair of socks that I have,' says one.</p>

  <p>"'Then 'tis high time they were washed,' says I. 'Be off, you blackguards,
  and may Heaven help you if you have the doctor let down.'</p>

  <p>"At eleven-thirty the chief doctor arrives. ''Tis the bath I would see,'
  he says.</p>

  <p>"''Tis occupied, sir,' says I, giving the sign to Angus MacNab. 'Twas high
  time too, for O'Toole had been dressed only in his shirt for three-quarters
  of an hour.'</p>

  <p>"When we got to the barn there was O'Toole standing in the water. He was
  blue with the cold, and shivering like a leaf in the wind.</p>

  <p>"'Ah! my man,' says the chief doctor, ''tis a bath you're having, I
  see.'</p>

  <p>"'Sit down, you varmint,' I whispers, 'sit down and splash. It's enjoying
  yourself you are.'</p>

  <p>"'And how often do you take a bath?' says the chief doctor.</p>

  <p>"'Every day,' mutters O'Toole, when he could speak for the chattering of
  his teeth, for I had my eye fixed upon him.</p>

  <p>"'Very good indeed,' says the chief doctor. 'A most satisfactory
  arrangement,' he remarks to our own doctor. 'And now I will inspect the place
  where they have the clothes washed.'</p>

  <p>"'Get out,' I says to O'Toole as they goes out.</p>

  <p>"''Tis dying I am,' he says, as the six men rushes in for the tub.</p>

  <p>"'Step it, you blackguards!' I cries. 'I will keep them diverted till you
  have it in place.'</p>

  <p>"With that I catches up the party, and asks the Colonel concerning one of
  the cookhouses nearby. The doctor keeps him occupied inside, I having given
  him the wink, and then out come the boys with the tub. They stuck going
  round, as the passage was narrow, but I had them fixed with my eye, and they
  suddenly fell through together. The tub upset and the water was received by
  Angus MacNab. There was a terrible noise as it fell on the bricks, but they
  was out of sight when the doctor appeared.</p>

  <p>"'And now the wash-tub,' he says.</p>

  <p>"'Round here, sir,' says I, and with that I leads the party to the other
  side of the barn. They had it fixed, as he comes up.</p>

  <p>"'But it is empty,' says he. 'You cannot wash clothes without water. And
  what is that at the bottom?'</p>

  <p>"He pointed to a watery-looking grey object at the bottom of the tub.</p>

  <p>"''Tis the shirt of O'Toole," whispers one of the men to me, 'that slipped
  in by mistake.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis a shirt,' says I, 'the owner of which has been in contact with a
  horse with the ringworm.' At that moment I heard the voice of O'Toole from
  inside as he looked for his shirt, and I went on a little louder, the better
  to drown his horrible language. 'I have the men instructed that they are to
  empty the water away after washing any of his garments.'</p>

  <p>"'But why does he not wash his own?' asks the Colonel.</p>

  <p>"'In this unit, sir,' says I, 'the medical officer is that particular that
  we has a special squad trained in washing.'</p>

  <p>"'Indeed,' says he, and looked at me close. 'Twas a mercy he did not look
  at our own doctor, for he was purple in the face, and unable to speak with
  ease. 'Indeed,' says he, and fixes his eye on the one sock which was all the
  whole six could muster between them for the washing. 'I trust they are not
  overworked.'</p>

  <p>"I have since wondered whether he suspected anything," murmured Cassidy,
  as he took another of my cigarettes.</p>

  <p>I left the great man smoking reflectively, and as I reached the front door
  the sense of my great inferiority descended like a pall. What would he have
  done had the meat been found in the soak-pit? But at this moment I was nearly
  run over by a motor omnibus.</p>

  <h2><a id="story8"
     name="story8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE BRIDGE<br>
  An Incident During the Retreat</h2>

  <h3>Previously published in <i>Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.</i></h3>

  <p class="first">"I have been wondering, sir," remarked Cassidy to me the
  next day, "whether we were not perhaps a little hard on those five boys
  yesterday, that we saw in the train."</p>

  <p>I had strolled round in the afternoon to hear from him the story of Dennis
  O'Rourke, and what had happened at the Bridge.</p>

  <p>"It is not maybe that they are afraid, sir," he went on, "for I'm thinking
  that if they were, they would be far more frightened of saying so, but it is
  that they do not realise; and 'tis hard to see how they can, for it has not
  been brought home to them &mdash; none of those little things that one sees,
  which serve to make one understand what it means.</p>

  <p>"I remember one day &mdash; 'twas in the early stages when we were drawing
  them after us into France. 'Twas hot &mdash; hot as the devil &mdash; and
  towards the evening I was riding quiet like, along a nice shady road, for all
  the world as it might have been a lane in England. For the time there was but
  little noise of firing at all &mdash; 'twas just a bit of a lull &mdash; but
  we had seen them, and we knew they were coming, coming in motor-'buses, and
  the saints know what else; in thousands and thousands they were pouring along
  after us, though at the time we did not know 'twas as bad as it was. Oh!
  'twas cruel; but as I say, I was away on my own &mdash; the sappers mostly
  were those days, being split up for the different jobs &mdash; and as I rode
  along the road I saw a lad leaning over the hedge sucking a straw. Away back
  behind him was a great house and stables, and I said to him, I said, "'Bong
  soir,' I said.</p>

  <p>"'Cheese it,' he answers. 'Who are you bong-soiring?'</p>

  <p>"When I heard him talking plain like that, I pulled up and looked at him.
  'I thought you were a Frenchie,' I said to him, 'till you opened your beer
  trap. Do you grow here, or are you touring the country for fun?'</p>

  <p>"'I ride for the stable up yonder,' he said, pointing with his thumb.</p>

  <p>"'Bedad!' I said, ''tis a training stable you have,' for it had not struck
  me they had those things in France at all.</p>

  <p>"'Did you think it was a potted meat factory?' he said.</p>

  <p>"'I did not,' I said; 'but unless you hop it pretty quickly it precious
  soon will be.'</p>

  <p>"'What are you meaning?' said the trainer, who had come out and overheard
  what I said.</p>

  <p>"'Unless you and your horses and your lads hop it smartly,' I said to him,
  'it's hopping in another direction you'll be before the morning, for by that
  time the Germans will be upon you.'</p>

  <p>"'Are you sure?' he said, 'for I have some valuable horses with me, and I
  would not lose them.'</p>

  <p>"'Am I sure?' said I. 'Would I be riding for three days without ceasing,
  with a thirst like the morning after, if I were not sure?'</p>

  <p>"'What will I do?' he said, 'for 'tis the first I have heard of it.'</p>

  <p>"'Do!' I said. 'The first thing you will do is to give me a drink, and my
  horse as well, and then you will gather your lads and you will ride south,
  and you will not stop riding for a week or so; for if you do not, 'tis little
  riding you'll any of you do again.'</p>

  <p>"When he saw I was in earnest 'twas a terrible blather he got into, and
  the last I saw of him he was riding into the dusk with his boys behind him
  and his stud of twelve horses, while the old woman who cleaned his house was
  hopping along beside him in the road, hanging on to his stirrup leather
  &mdash; and she a martyr to the indigestion as one of the lads told me. I
  know not what happened to him, but the next morning I saw his house fired,
  and 'twas a mercy I had the whisky removed. 'Tis the little things like that
  that make the people realise what war is; and we have not had the like in
  England at all, and it perhaps would be a good thing if we had, I'm after
  thinking."</p>

  <p>He paused to light another of my cigarettes.</p>

  <p>"But it was of Mr O'Rourke I would tell you, sir," he went on. "'Twas the
  morning after the little affair of which I have just told you, that we
  received the orders to go at once to a bridge nearby and have it prepared for
  the demolition. Mr O'Rourke was in charge, and I was with him, and we had
  about a dozen of the lads. When we got there we found 'twas a big one over a
  river &mdash; a sort of suspension bridge, and 'twas evidently an important
  one. 'Twas another scorching day, and Mr O'Rourke he says, 'Let's get it
  fixed up quick, boys,' he says, 'and it's a bathe we can have.' Well, there
  is not the necessity for me to tell you the details of the fixing &mdash; of
  how we placed the gun-cotton on the cables, and the leads were running to the
  exploder hidden behind a tree on our own side. We tested it all, and we had
  the bit of fuse and another detonator fixed up in case of any failure in the
  electricity. When we had it done, some of the lads had a bathe, and we lay in
  the shade of a few trees, most of us fast asleep &mdash; for you will mind
  that our orders were only to prepare it for the demolition, and not actually
  to blow it up. 'Twas still &mdash; 'twas just peace: the heat haze shimmering
  in the blue, and the buzz of the little flies and things, to send one to
  sleep, for we were well behind our own men. Two hours later &mdash; well, we
  will come to that, sir, but it will give you an idea of how those fellows
  came on. It seemed as if we had been there but a minute, but maybe it was
  half an hour, when with a crash one of the Horse Batteries galloped over the
  bridge. The dust rose in great choking clouds, and through it we could see
  the drivers &mdash; their collars open, their faces grey with it, some with
  hats and some without, themselves sitting down and riding like men possessed,
  while their horses sweated and galloped and the guns swayed behind. In a
  second they were gone, and only the dust remained.</p>

  <p>"Mr O'Rourke he turned to me and he said, 'They were going fast even for
  the Horse,' he said, 'along a road; and I would to Heaven it had been the
  other way they were galloping,' for I should tell you, sir, they were going
  south. Five minutes later we heard them come into action a quarter of a mile
  behind us. 'Covering the retreat again,' he muttered; and barely had he
  spoken when an Infantry regiment came in sight &mdash; going the same way. Mr
  O'Rourke and I we went into the centre of the bridge to keep our eye on the
  charge, and we watched them come by. Walking dogged they were, with a fixed
  sort of stare, and some were asleep as they marched, and some were whistling
  through lips that made no noise. The sweat was caked on them, and they were
  grey from head to foot, and the officers were staggering up and down cheering
  them on &mdash; for those lads had been going without rest at all for ten
  days and more. And one of the sergeants said to me as he went by, he said,
  'There are thousands of them, and they're close behind.' When they had gone I
  went to Mr O'Rourke and I said to him, 'It's close work it's going to be,
  sir, I'm thinking, for they are near behind.'</p>

  <p>"And then up galloped a staff officer.</p>

  <p>"'Are you the Engineer officer in charge?' he said.</p>

  <p>"'I am that,' said Mr O'Rourke.</p>

  <p>"'There are still two squadrons of Lancers between you and the Germans,'
  he said, 'and they will be across soon, for they are only covering the
  Infantry who have just gone over. When they are over blow up the bridge, and
  do not linger to admire the view, for it will be unhealthy.'</p>

  <p>"'Very good, sir,' says Mr O'Rourke.</p>

  <p>"'And,' says he, 'let there be no mistake, for the love of Heaven; for
  should the charge fail we are undone. This bridge is the most important of
  any there are to be destroyed, and they must not get it.'</p>

  <p>"'They will not get it,' says Mr O'Rourke; and with that he galloped away.
  When he had gone we walked off the bridge. 'Pray Heaven, Cassidy,' he said,
  'that all is well, for we will not have much time, if there is a fault, to
  adjust it.'</p>

  <p>"'It will be all right, sir,' said I, 'for we have it tested.'</p>

  <p>"And then the Cavalry started coming back.</p>

  <p>"'Clear out, you boys,' shouted an officer; 'they are in touch with us,
  and we cannot hold them longer.'</p>

  <p>"'Cassidy,' said Mr O'Rourke, 'take the men back, for it is no good them
  stopping here.'</p>

  <p>"'Would we be leaving you, sir?' I cried.</p>

  <p>"'You would not,' he said; 'but what good can you do? for if the charge
  fails there will be no time to relay it, and if it succeeds 'twill be easier
  for me to get away alone than if you are all here.'</p>

  <p>"I saw his point, and I knew he was right &mdash; though it went against
  the grain to leave him in the lurch, as it were. But he would not alter, and
  so I took them away &mdash; muttering and cursing they were. I took them to a
  little rise under cover two or three hundred yards away, where it was easy to
  clear from when the bridge was down without being fired on. Before I went I
  said to him, I said, 'We will be yonder, and it's there we will wait for you.
  If you go that way round you can get there easily.' Just after we got there
  we saw a major gallop over the bridge with his orderly behind him, and he
  shouted something to Mr O'Rourke. We saw him running to the exploder and
  fixing the leads, and then he paused and straightened himself up behind the
  tree. From where we were we could see two Uhlans coming near the bridge, with
  more of them, hundreds of them, behind. And then he forced down the handle of
  the exploder. 'Mother of Heaven!' I screamed, for nothing happened. He did it
  again, and it failed again. You will mind, sir, that from where he was he
  could not see the Uhlan and they could not see him &mdash; but we could see
  both of them from the rise. The men were sobbing and cursing. A corporal
  caught my arm, and he muttered, 'It was not to fail,' he said, 'and it has.
  What will we do?' 'What can we?' I said, 'for they are on the bridge.' And
  then of a sudden we saw the lad creeping along under cover of the trees, and
  he reached the bridge and ran like a hare to the charge. The Uhlans saw him
  too, and rode at him; and the men started screaming and cheering, for they
  were off their heads, and they thought he would be able to do something. 'But
  what can he do?' I groaned, 'for the fuse will not burn quick enough. They
  are too close.' He reached the charge first, and his revolver was drawn. It
  was drawn, I say, but it was not at the Uhlans it pointed. For a second he
  stood there, with his head thrown back, and it seemed to us as if he laughed
  at them. And the lads saw what was in his mind, and they were silent &mdash;
  saving only one, and he threw himself on the ground sobbing. And the Uhlans
  saw what was in his mind, and one pulled his horse over backwards trying to
  get off the bridge, while the other rode at him. And then he fired. From the
  range of an inch he fired into the gun-cotton, and the roar of the detonation
  shook the heaven. And he and the Uhlans disappeared. They were there one
  minute and the next they were not. And then, with a great sort of rending
  crash, the whole thing fell into the river below.</p>

  <p>"We looked for a moment and then we stumbled away &mdash; and the most of
  us could not see with ease, for the lads had loved him well."</p>

  <p>Cassidy paused and looked into the fire. "So it was not a failure," I said
  softly as I left him.</p>

  <h2><a id="story9"
     name="story9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE CHARGE OF THE COOKS<br>
  Zillebeeke, November 1914</h2>

  <h3>Previously published in <i>Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.</i></h3>

  <p class="first">"I wonder if by chance you recall the fat lad that was cook
  for the officers' mess when we used to go on the manoeuvres in England,"
  remarked Cassidy to me one day. We were strolling slowly through the Park,
  getting his foot into work again; but scenting one of his more expansive
  moments, I suggested a seat.</p>

  <p>"A great lad he was," he went on when we had made ourselves comfortable,
  "and it was cook he was for the officers over yonder. You recall his name,
  sir &mdash; Michael M'Doolan. 'Tis true that he was not the equal of a French
  chef, but he was a worthy lad to work under our doctor, of which same
  gentleman and his way with the people I have already told you. Of course you
  will understand, sir, that before we came into the billets, and whenever we
  are fighting, the doctor has no time to do anything but his job, and so 'tis
  the cook who does what he can for the officers, such as milking any cow the
  owner has forgotten about, or the like.</p>

  <p>"I remember one day &mdash; we had come up to where we are now, sir
  &mdash; it being a day in November, and we were all working pretty hard just
  then. You'll mind, sir, our hours are different to the others, for we are on
  always, and we never know when we shall be wanted or where we have to go. The
  officers all go out each night with parties of men and work in front of the
  trenches and on the different jobs, and come back in the morning &mdash; when
  they want a bit of food before they go to sleep. 'Tis the same with the men.
  They all come back into the farm or the dug-out behind the firing-line, where
  they get a chance of lying up during the day.</p>

  <p>"In the place where we were then the officers were in a farm. 'Twas a bit
  draughty, as there was more hole than wall, owing to the shells, and it was
  not over-distant from the firing-line itself, but hidden from it by a little
  hill. On the day I speak of I was walking from my own bit of a pigsty to
  their farm, when I felt the zip of a bullet as it went past my head. Thinks I
  to myself, 'That was as close as was convenient,' when another one zips past
  too. I was taking no risks, so I jumped into the ditch, the better to think.
  'If there is not a blackguard drawing on me,' I says to myself, 'may I never
  again see Ballygoyle; but where is it that he is, for it is not in the
  firing-line that he can be?' seeing, as I have told you, we were hidden from
  it by a hill. I crept along the ditch to the officers' farm, and there I
  finds M'Doolan. The officers and men were all out, but he was not alone, for
  there were gathered with him behind the wall of the farm the four other cooks
  for the mess.</p>

  <p>"'What the devil are you all doing here?' I said, as I got out of the
  ditch. 'Is it a mothers' meeting that it is, or why are you not at the
  dinners?'</p>

  <p>"'Do you see the farm yonder?' says M'Doolan, pointing to one we could
  just see.</p>

  <p>"'I do,' says I, following his finger.</p>

  <p>"'They have us marked from there,' he says. 'There are three of them, I
  think, and it's sniping us they've been for the last two hours.'</p>

  <p>"''Twas from there, was it,' I says, 'that it came?' and I looked through
  a hole at the farm.</p>

  <p>"'Have they been at you, Sergeant?' they says.</p>

  <p>"'Why else would I be in the ditch?' says I. 'I am not after training as a
  Boy Scout.'</p>

  <p>"At that moment there came another shot. There was a terrible 'cluck,' and
  all was still. M'Doolan, he jumped up and rushed out before we could stop
  him, shouting, 'The devils, the devils!' at the top of his voice.</p>

  <p>"'Come back, you fool,' I cried, and went out and pulled him in. I pulled
  him in, I say, but he was peering through the different holes in the wall
  like a man possessed.</p>

  <p>"'Was it a cluck I heard behind there?' he says &mdash; in a terrible way
  he was &mdash; 'was it a cluck, for if so 'twas Rosie.'</p>

  <p>"'Rosie,' I says, 'what are you talking about, and who's your Rosie at
  all?'</p>

  <p>"'It was,' he cries, peering through one of the holes, 'for I can see her
  &mdash; and it's dead she is.'</p>

  <p>"I looked out and I saw a hen lying in the corner with most of its
  feathers off, and she certainly did not look very lively."</p>

  <p>"''Tis only a hen,' I cried in disgust. 'Away with you and your
  Rosie.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis not that,' he says; ''tis the Major. 'Tis terrible particular he is
  about getting his egg in the morning when he comes in, and when we comes here
  a week ago I found little Rosie. She was the only one left, and saving only
  that an ammunition wagon passed over her the day before yesterday she has
  been doing well. Oh! 'tis a terrible thing she has passed away, Sergeant.</p>

  <p>"'Why, only this morning she failed to do her duty, and when I went out
  there was nothing. The Major he says, "M'Doolan," he says, "where the deuce
  is the Hen Fruit? Hen fruit, you fool!" he cries, irritable-like, when I
  looks at him puzzled, "produce of the feathered biped &mdash; egg?"'</p>

  <p>"'She has misfired, sir,' I says. ''Tis either the wagon which passed over
  her two days ago, or else the round of ammunition she ate yesterday &mdash;
  but she is looking unwell.'</p>

  <p>"' "Well, put her in a corner and sing to her this morning," he says, "and
  she'll either lay an egg or the bullet &mdash; but for Heaven's sake get hold
  of eggs somehow."</p>

  <p>"'Well, I was doing my best. I had her in the corner over there, and it
  was hypnotising her I was. She was standing on one leg, and something was
  happening. I was clucking to her, when a bullet went between my legs from
  that same devil yonder. So I hopped it, but little Rosie stayed on, for I
  watched her, and 'tis an egg she would have laid before evening, for it was
  in earnest she was. And now what will I be after saying to the Major about it
  at all?'</p>

  <p>"''Tis rot you're talking,' I says. 'If the hen has been shot &mdash; and,
  bedad, after it had been run over by a wagon, and had eaten a round of
  ammunition, and had been looked at by you close, 'twas a merciful end for the
  poor bird &mdash; why are you five great hulking blatherers here? Away with
  you, and capture the house and the snipers. Are not five Sappers enough to do
  it, even if they are cooks?'</p>

  <p>"'Less of your even and your cooks, Sergeant,' says one. 'We will do it at
  once.'</p>

  <p>"Bedad! sir," laughed Cassidy, "you'd have laughed to see those five.
  M'Doolan elected himself the commander, and off they went up the ditch in
  great style, for all the world like a herd of hippopotamuses going to water.
  I followed them to see the fun. When they came to the end of the ditch they
  were still about two hundred yards from the house where they were. You'll
  mind, sir, the line was a bit mixed up just there, and there were a lot of
  the German snipers behind our own lines and all over the place. M'Doolan in a
  voice like a foghorn, gathered them together behind a refuse-heap and
  explained the situation.</p>

  <p>"'Two of you,' he says, 'will fire at the devils from here, to keep them
  engaged like, while we three will go round the back and rush them,' and away
  they crept. The two that were left behind were not in a manner of speaking
  marksmen, but as they had not fired a shot since the beginning they were all
  over it. They plastered the house and the ground and the refuse-heap they
  were lying behind with bullets, and one of them struck a cow in the next
  field &mdash; leastways with a bellow of pain she disappeared towards the
  trenches.</p>

  <p>"But the diversion served, for the snipers had all their attention on the
  refuse-heap, and M'Doolan and his two warriors reached the back unobserved.
  They crept up the stairs, and M'Doolan had his gun in one hand and Rosie in
  the other, for he was minded she should revenge herself. There were only two
  of them there, and they were occupied, as I have said, with the two outside.
  They crept into the room, and then with a whoop they were on them. M'Doolan
  tackled one. He hit him in the stomach with his rifle and in the face with
  Rosie, so that he dropped his gun and started praying. The other two had not
  their rifles, but one of them hit the second German over the head with a
  bottle of curry powder, while the other collared him by the legs. The first
  of them was trying to get Rosie's foot out of his mouth, and the other was
  sneezing curry when I got there; and it was a great diversion, for M'Doolan
  was taking no risks, and he still had them covered with his gun, while the
  other two were trying to gather up what was left of the curry powder.</p>

  <p>"'Murderers!' roars M'Doolan, brandishing Rosie in front of them, 'could
  you not have let her be while she laid her last egg? You Huths, you Gons!' he
  says, getting a trifle mixed. ''Tis my prisoners you are.' With that he
  seized them both, and when the other two had taken their guns he marched them
  out. 'Twas a great procession. We went down the road with the Germans in
  front, the one plucking curry powder from his mouth and the other feathers.
  The first man we ran into was the Major.</p>

  <p>"'What the devil is this!' he cries, putting up his eyeglass.</p>

  <p>"'We have avenged the death of Rosie, sir,' says M'Doolan, holding up the
  hen. 'Those two devils slaughtered her as she was getting ready to lay the
  egg for your breakfast tomorrow.'</p>

  <p>"'Great Scott!' says he, 'let's hear about it.'</p>

  <p>"So M'Doolan told him the story. When he had finished the Major looked at
  him and then he looked at the Germans. One had still got his teeth full of
  feathers and the other was covered with a sort of yellow foam. Lastly he
  looked at the hen, and then he laughed.</p>

  <p>"'Take 'em away,' he says to me; 'take 'em away, and send 'em to
  headquarters with my compliments.'</p>

  <p>"'But Rosie, sir,' says M'Doolan. 'Is it roast or boiled you will have
  her?'</p>

  <p>"The Major he looks at M'Doolan and laughs again. ''Tis a second Napoleon
  you are, M'Doolan,' he says, 'and it is well you have done to capture them
  two; but with regard to your cooking, do which you like, for we will not know
  the difference.' "</p>

  <h2><a id="story10"
     name="story10"></a>X. &mdash; THE SPY<br>
  November 1914, near Messines</h2>

  <h3>Previously published in <i>Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.</i></h3>

  <p class="first">"It seems strange," I remarked one morning to Sergeant
  Cassidy, as we sat together in the Park, whither he had hobbled on his
  crutches, "that those fellows run their spy system so well. Why aren't they
  spotted more easily?" Only that morning I had been reading in the paper of a
  German officer who had spent some four or five days behind the British lines,
  his identity only being suspected when he was back safely behind his own
  again.</p>

  <p>"Maybe, sir, maybe," answered my guide and counsellor. "But 'tis not so
  strange after all, when you come to think of it. For when a man dressed as a
  French officer comes behind the English lines, and another dressed as an
  English officer is himself behind the French, 'tis hard to tell where you
  are. For our knowledge of the language is not all it might be, and 'tis hard
  to tell if it's a German talking English or a Frenchman &mdash; even for the
  officers."</p>

  <p>Reluctantly I was compelled to admit that my gardener's unhealthy wish for
  pens, ink, and paper, and my aunt's notorious predilection for cheese in all
  forms &mdash; the only blot on our otherwise stainless escutcheon &mdash;
  which in the days of my youth I had so frequently translated into perfect
  French, had not fitted me for the onerous task of spy-hunting behind the
  lines.</p>

  <p>"But, bedad, it's right that you are, sir," continued Cassidy, when he had
  temporarily taken over my cigarette case. "They are extraordinary &mdash; the
  way they send men behind our lines and find things out, and no one can deny
  that those same men are full of pluck. For they know the penalty when they
  are found out &mdash; and there is not much glory over their work at all.
  They do what our own officers would not like the doing of, because they would
  be after thinking it was dirty work.</p>

  <p>"I mind me once when we caught one of them at it. 'Twas more by luck than
  anything else that we did that same, but 'tis a story that bears the
  telling."</p>

  <p>A temporary lull occurred at that moment, owing to the excitement of his
  catching what I believe is known as the "glad-eye" from a passing fairy, and
  very nearly slipping off the seat. When he had waved his crutch twice, and
  comparative calm again reigned, I ventured to recall the great man to the
  affairs of earth.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about the spy, Cassidy," I said firmly.</p>

  <p>"What a peach!" he murmured. "Begorrah &mdash; a darling; and 'tis Irish
  she was with her eyes." He sighed deeply. "But 'tis of the spy you would be
  hearing, sir. For the proper understanding of what I would be telling you, it
  is clear you must know how the firing line is at the present moment &mdash;
  and what the lads are after doing. You will mind that there are farmhouses
  &mdash; dotted they are all over the place &mdash; and barns and old mills
  and the like. Those same barns were occupied by the Germans in most cases
  before they were taken over by us as we pushed them back. Of course, as you
  know, they have not moved at all lately, but I am speaking of maybe two or
  three months ago. What was easier than for those fellows to leave a stray man
  or two behind them who was able to talk the English or French, and put a
  telephone or the like in one of those same barns which was connected with
  their own lines, and where they knew they would be?</p>

  <p>"You will mind also that the lingo they speak up in the North, where they
  are now, has a heathenish sound to it, and a man might be a German or a Jew
  from Patagonia before one was the wiser for it. And there is another thing
  too, sir, that you must be after bearing in mind, and that is the importance
  of this same spying. For with the aeroplanes and the like, 'tis impossible to
  move the lads during the day, as it is seen they would be, and any big
  massing of them is bound to be known. So 'tis at night that the moves are
  done, and 'tis then that these fellows come in. For you will mind that, with
  the line as it is, if maybe a bit of a hill like is captured &mdash; though
  it may only be an advance of a few hundred feet &mdash; yet the new position
  may enfilade their line, and when the guns are brought up may cause them
  great uneasiness for two or three miles. Then maybe the winning of that
  little bit of ground may allow our lads to get the range of a railway they
  are using, or the like. So you will see, sir, that those little advances are
  much more important than they would appear in the papers; but the success of
  them depends on secrecy, and if 'tis given away beforehand by a spy, the lads
  have no chance.</p>

  <p>"We were in a farm at the time. 'Twas a funny old bird that had that same
  farm, all screwed up and wizened like. The boys called him Gilbert the
  Filbert &mdash; and his appearance was like to a monkey that had not washed
  for months. It was all alone in the farm he was, so the interpreter told me
  &mdash; you mind that all our regiments and batteries yonder have a French
  interpreter with them &mdash; and his wife had died of the shock when the
  Germans had been in the farm.</p>

  <p>"I says to him, I says when he told me, 'By the Holy Saints,' I says, 'if
  the old lady's face was like most of those I've seen creeping about round
  here, 'twas probably a heavy casualty list those Boches had themselves when
  they see her.'</p>

  <p>"We never saw him most of the day. Down in the café he was, they said
  &mdash; or rather 'estaminet,' as they call 'pubs' in those parts &mdash;
  drinking to drown his grief. The old devil! 'Twas great the way he had us
  boiled. Well, one morning the General he comes round to the farm, and his
  staff with him. I misremember what actually he had come for; 'twas an
  inspection or something, but 'tis of no account. When 'twas all over the
  officer gentlemen were sitting in the farm having a bit of lunch, and from
  what Mr Tracey told me after, the General was talking a bit open like about
  the intentions of the big guns, and what they were going to do. Nothing much,
  you mind me, but things it would be inconvenient for them German lads to
  know. Now, in that farm we were in then there was a cellar &mdash; they have
  them in many of them &mdash; where they keep the beer and the like."</p>

  <p>Cassidy paused a moment and laid his hand on my arm. "While I think of it,
  sir," he said impressively, "when you get there, be careful of that same beer
  &mdash; for 'tis cold on the stomach it lies, and there is but little warmth
  in it."</p>

  <p>I duly noted the fact, for when an expert speaks it behoves all who can to
  read, mark, learn and inwardly digest.</p>

  <p>"As I was after saying," he went on, after a short but solemn pause,
  "there was a cellar in this same farm, and one way of reaching it was from
  the room where the officers were sitting. As luck would have it, the lad who
  was the cook &mdash; that same M'Doolan of whom I have already told you
  &mdash; had run short of milk, and the officers were thinking a little hot
  milk and rum would be good for their health. The Doctor &mdash; the lad that
  had the way with him &mdash; was a great believer in it as a medicine, and
  the Major, I am told, did not disagree with him on the matter. So M'Doolan
  was in a great way, for the General was minded to try it, and devil a drop of
  the cow oil was there. He was shouting for Gilbert, and making a noise he
  said was like a cow, for not a word of the lingo could he speak. 'Twas a
  terrible commotion, and when he came outside to find the old man, making this
  noise, we thought the ration lorry was upset.</p>

  <p>"''Tis not another drop the old cow will lay if she hears you,' I
  says.</p>

  <p>"'I cannot find Gilbert,' says he, 'and the General is dying of thirst and
  the cold.'</p>

  <p>"Away he goes, and for some reason he went into the cellar, for there was
  another way in besides the one I have told you of. He gets in, and, bedad, he
  had not been gone a minute before there was a noise like a Black Maria
  inside.</p>

  <p>"''Tis the cow,' I cried. 'He has her caught, and it's milking her he
  is.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis not,' he cries. ''Tis Gilbert, and 'tis a spy he is, the dirty
  devil.' And with that be comes up with the old farmer man. He had him by the
  back of the neck, and his clasp knife was in his other hand, to make him move
  the faster. 'I found him,' he says, 'with his ear at the door of the
  officers' room, and 'tis listening he was to the General.'</p>

  <p>"And then, as you may think, there was the devil and all. The lads came
  running, and the officers appeared, and the General, wiping his moustache,
  for without the necessary milk they had been drinking it neat.</p>

  <p>"'What is it at all?' he says, 'and why is there all this commotion?'</p>

  <p>"''Tis a spy, sir,' says M'Doolan, 'and it's his ear he had to the door
  when I caught him.'</p>

  <p>"And then a change came over them all, and they became very silent. The
  Major puts in his eyeglass and looks at the men. 'You may dismiss,' says he,
  quiet like, and they dismissed. The General he looked at the farmer, and then
  he turned to the Major.</p>

  <p>"'Is this the source,' says he, 'of the leakage of information?' For I may
  tell you, sir, that though at the time I did not know of that same &mdash; Mr
  Tracey, he told me after &mdash; there had been a great leakage, and the
  reason had them all beat. 'What have you to say?' he says, and he turned to
  the farmer.</p>

  <p>"The farmer he stood there, sullen like, for it was afraid to move he was,
  seeing that M'Doolan's clasp knife was touching his neck.</p>

  <p>"'<i>Comprends pas</i>,' he says, or some such words, though not knowing
  the language I could not say exact like.</p>

  <p>"'Go down, Tracey,' says the Major, 'and search the cellar'; and Mr Tracey
  he went off. While he was away we were all silent, and the General's face was
  stern, for we knew without the searching. In a few minutes Mr Tracey came
  back, and in his hand he held a telephone.</p>

  <p>"''Twas under the sacks, sir,' he says to the General. 'I cut the leads
  and here it is.'</p>

  <p>"The General looked at the telephone, and then at the farmer. 'What have
  you to say?' he says, and his voice was terrible to hear.</p>

  <p>"I was watching the farmer, and 'twas a strange sight, for on the sudden
  he seemed to change. He realised 'twas the end, and he straightened himself
  up. 'Twas acting he'd been, and he was not an old man at all. He brought his
  heels together and stood to attention, giving him look for look.</p>

  <p>"'Nothing,' he says.</p>

  <p>"'You know the penalty?' says the General.</p>

  <p>"'I do,' he says, and he did not falter.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it was the change in him, but the Brigade Major he gives a
  start and then he looks at him close. 'Good God!' he says, 'were you not
  shooting with Lord&mdash;?' &mdash; he mentioned one of the quality &mdash;
  'were you not shooting with him last year?'</p>

  <p>"'I was, Major Drayton,' says he, and his voice was cold.</p>

  <p>"Major Drayton turns away, and his mouth was sneering, for he liked not
  finding him a spy.</p>

  <p>"'Is there any letter you wish to write?' says the General. 'I will send
  it for you when I have read it.'</p>

  <p>"'There is not,' he says, still standing stiff and rigid like.</p>

  <p>"'Is there anything you would wish to say?' says the General.</p>

  <p>"'One thing, and one thing only,' says he, and his voice rang out clear
  and loud. I remember it well, for the lads were looking from the barn to see
  what was occurring. 'We have different ideas,' he says, 'you and I. There are
  thousands of us doing this &mdash; glorying in it &mdash; for 'tis the work
  of a man. I am of the Prussian Army, and I tell you that your day is over.
  For you English your star is setting &mdash; you have ceased to be a great
  nation &mdash; you are on the wane. What matter my death? There are others.
  For years we have prepared, we have made ready, we have waited &mdash; and
  now your hour has come. It is <i>der Tag</i>,' and he raised his hand above
  his head.</p>

  <p>"Everyone was silent, and the General was silent too, for the man was
  terribly in earnest. At last the General spoke, and his voice was not
  terrible any more. 'We will not argue the matter,' he said. 'As you say, we
  see things differently. Perhaps in time you and your nation will find that
  you have made a terrible mistake, and that the star of England has not set,
  but is blazing fiercer than ever.' And then he paused, and the officers round
  stood stiffly &mdash; just like the German &mdash; and one, I remember,
  caught his breath in a sob almost, for he was young and just out. 'There is
  no more to be said,' went on the General, 'and as you have no letter to write
  I will not delay. You will be shot in half an hour.'</p>

  <p>"The German he saluted, and not a muscle of his face moved.</p>

  <p>"'Twas very gravely and quietly the officers saluted too, for, German or
  no German, spy or no spy, he was a brave man."</p>

     name="story11">XI. &mdash; A DAY OF PEACE</a></h2>

  <h3>Previously published in <i>No Man's Land</i></h3>

  <p class="first">"For the fourteenth morning in succession I rise to a point
  of order. Why is there no marmalade?" The Doctor glared round the breakfast
  table. "I perceive a pot of unhealthy-looking damson, and a tin of golden
  syrup, the greater part of which now adorns the infant's face. Why is there
  no marmalade?"</p>

  <p>"Could I remind you that there is a war on two miles up the road, my
  splay-footed bolus-booster?" With a grand rolling of his R's, the man who had
  driven a railway through the Rocky Mountains, and who now boasted the badges
  of a subaltern in His Majesty's Corps of Royal Engineers, let drive. "Ye come
  to live with us much against our will, because you're a poor homeless
  wanderer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All dressed up and nowhere to go," broke in the Doctor mournfully.</p>

  <p>"You come to live with us, I say," went on the Scotchman, "and then do
  nothing but criticise our food and our morals."</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows they both need it. Pass me what's left of the syrup, little
  one. Scrape the rest of it off your chin, my cherub, and wrap it up in a
  handkerchief and take it up to the trenches with you."</p>

  <p>"You're vewy wude." The junior subaltern adjusted the balance in the
  matter of the letter R with the Scotchman. Two months ago he had been at
  home&mdash;in peace time he would still have been at school. But of such
  mixtures is the present British Army made. "It's my face."</p>

  <p>As a statement of fact the remark left nothing to be desired; as a
  statement of expediency, when other infants were present, the same cannot be
  said. Words, in fact, were trembling on the tongue of a veteran of six months
  when the C.O. came suddenly into the room.</p>

  <p>"Bring me an egg," he shouted to the mess waiter in the kitchen next door.
  "Listen to this, my bonnie boys." He produced a paper from his coat pocket
  and sat down at the table. "Secret. A large object has fallen beside the sap
  leading out to Vesuvius crater. It is about the size of a rum jar, and is
  thought to be filled with explosive. It has been covered with sandbags and
  its early removal would seem desirable, as the sap is frequently
  bombarded&mdash;Damn it, this egg's addled. Take it away, it's got spots on
  it. Where did I get to? Oh! yes&mdash;bombarded with aerial darts and rifle
  grenades." He replaced the paper in his pocket and reached for the
  teapot.</p>

  <p>"Thought to be filled with explosive!" The Scotchman looked up
  sarcastically from the letter he was censoring. "What's it likely to be
  filled with?"</p>

  <p>"Marmalade, ducky," remarked the Doctor, still harping on his
  grievance.</p>

  <p>"In addition to that the Pumpkin desires my presence at the Centre
  Battalion Head-quarters at 10 ak emma." The C.O. was prodding his second egg
  suspiciously.</p>

  <p>The Pumpkin, it may be explained in parenthesis, was the not unsuitable
  nickname of the Divisional General.</p>

  <p>"Is the old man coming round the trenches?" Jackson, the subaltern in
  whose tender care reposed the crater of Vesuvius and all that appertained
  thereto, including rum jars, looked up with mild interest.</p>

  <p>The C.O. glanced at the message beside him. "'The G.O.C. wishes to meet
  the Engineer Officer in charge of Left Section, at Centre Battalion
  Headquarters, at 10 a.m., A.A.A. Message ends.' There in a nutshell you have
  the glorious news."</p>

  <p>Breakfast is never a loquacious meal, and for a while silence reigned,
  broken only by a few desultory remarks as to the vileness of the food
  produced by the officer responsible for the mess catering, and the exorbitant
  price he demanded for it&mdash;statements which had staled with much vain
  repetition.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake dry up," he remarked peevishly. "You've had sardines on
  toast twenty-one nights running; what more do you want? Listen to the words
  of Sapper Mackintosh&mdash;the pudding-faced marvel. This"&mdash;he held up a
  letter&mdash;"is the fifth which he hopes will find the recipient as it
  leaves him at present&mdash;in the pink, and with the dreadful pains in his
  stummik quite gone."</p>

  <p>"Our Doctor has a wonderful bedside manner," remarked the Scotchman. "Did
  ye no hear the story of him and the lady way back by Hazebrook?"</p>

  <p>"That'll do," said the Doctor, rising hurriedly. "She had very bad
  rheumatism&mdash;that poor girl."</p>

  <p>"I know she had, Doc," put in the C.O. heartily. "And when I think of the
  way you eased her sufferings I became lost in admiration over the noble
  nature of your calling. In the meantime I'd be glad if you'd see one of the
  men in the Head-quarters Section. From the strange explosive noises he made
  when I spoke to him before breakfast I gathered by the aid of an interpreter
  that he had somewhat foolishly placed his complete set of uppers and lowers
  on a truss of compressed hay, and one of the mules has eaten them."</p>

  <p>He strolled to the door on his way to the kitchen in the next house that
  served as his office.</p>

  <p>"You'd better be careful with that rum jar, Jacko. Unless you're pretty
  certain there's no danger, I'd put a slab of gun-cotton against it where it
  is, and pop her off. No sense in running any risks carrying it back."</p>

  <p>"Right-ho! I'll have a look as soon as I go up. Are you coming, Mac?" He
  turned to the Scotchman.</p>

  <p>"In five minutes, my boy. I have to perform a few blasting operations on
  my pipe before I start, and then I'm with you." He pulled a battered veteran
  out of his pocket, and peered into its noisome bowl.</p>

  <p>"Not indoors, man, for heaven's sake!" The Doctor backed hurriedly out of
  the room. "The last billet you cleaned your pipe in they complained to the
  Mayor of the village."</p>

  <p>"Go away, Doctor, go away. Go and put chloride of lime round the cook-
  house," Mac was shouting through the window at the receding medico. "And ask
  yon woman if she has a hairpin. My pipe...." But the Doctor was out of
  sight.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later the room was empty save for a batman clearing the
  breakfast table.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Now as a general rule the Sappers do not live in the
  trenches, but go up there each day and most nights, the remainder of the time
  being spent in dwellings of dubious sanitation and indubitable draughtiness a
  mile or so in rear. To each company a certain front is allotted, and it is
  their joy and pride to maintain this front and the network of trenches behind
  it spotless and untarnished, what time they minister ceaselessly to the
  lightest whim of its heroic defenders&mdash;usually known by the generic term
  of P.B.I., or poor bally Infantry. Which, of course, is not what really
  happens, but one likes to think thus beautifully.</p>

  <p>In addition to the Infantry, other people thrust themselves forward in a
  manner which requires firmness and tact to deal with: gunners require O.P.'s,
  or observation posts; other gunners require trench mortar emplacements;
  dangerous men with machine guns sit up and take notice, and demand concrete
  and other abominations; while last, but not least, the medical profession
  demand secret and secure places in which to practise their nefarious trade.
  Finally, the Ordnance Department is with one always. It was that branch of
  the great Machine which caused the frown on the face of the Sapper Captain,
  hitherto alluded to as the O.C., while next door the batman cleared the
  breakfast table.</p>

  <p>"We're six bicycles short, you say, Quartermaster-Sergeant?" he exclaimed
  irritably, gazing at some papers in front of him, while he filled his
  pipe.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; and two more with wheels buckled, and three that free-wheel
  both ways."</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean&mdash;free-wheel both ways?"</p>

  <p>"The pedals rotate, sir, with great speed, but the bicycle remains
  motionless." When a man habitually calls an armchair, A chair, arm&mdash;
  Officers, for the use of, one&mdash;his conversation is apt to become
  stilted.</p>

  <p>"How were the wheels buckled?" demanded the Captain when he had digested
  this great thought.</p>

  <p>"Two of the officers, sir&mdash;playing what I believe they called bicycle
  polo with a brick and two pick-helves&mdash;had&mdash;er&mdash;a slight
  mishap."</p>

  <p>"When did it happen?"</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;after dinner, sir, one night." The N.C.O. looked tactfully out
  of the window.</p>

  <p>The officer did not pursue the topic. "Well, what about these six that
  have been lost?"</p>

  <p>"Completely destroyed by shell-fire," said the C.Q.M.S. firmly. "I have
  prepared a statement of what happened for your perusal and signature." He
  handed the officer a written paper and respectfully withdrew a few paces to
  avoid any semblance of coercion.</p>

  <p>"'The six bicycles were placed on the morning of the 10th ult. against the
  entrance to the R.E. Dump at A.21, C.2.4. It would appear that during the
  absence of the riders a hostile shell of large calibre fell on the six said
  bicycles, completely demolishing them, for when the riders returned after the
  day's work merely a few fragments remained scattered round the shell
  crater.'"</p>

  <p>The Captain read it over slowly, and then, in tones of awe, a murmured
  "Wonderful" wafted through the office.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir?" The N.C.O. was again at his side.</p>

  <p>"I said wonderful, Quartermaster-Sergeant&mdash;quite wonderful. Do you
  think they'll swallow it?"</p>

  <p>"It has been done before, sir." The tone was non-committal. "And one of
  the six was undoubtedly badly punctured by a stray rifle bullet before we
  lost it&mdash;er&mdash;that is, before it was finally destroyed by shell-
  fire."</p>

  <p>"Right." With the air of a man who communes with great destinies, the
  Captain signed his name. "Anything more?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at present, sir. The question of the consumption of Candles,
  Tallow dip, Pounds Twenty-four, stolen from our yard by the 940th Tunnelling
  Company has come back again with remarks from the Chief Ordnance Officer at
  the Base&mdash;but it will wait until you come back from the trenches."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad of that," remarked the Captain, rising. "I'm not feeling very
  strong this morning, and candles, tallow dip&mdash;especially lbs. 24 of
  them&mdash;would cause a relapse. Orderly"&mdash;he strolled to the
  door&mdash;"my bicycle, please."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later he was riding slowly down the road towards the place
  where there was "a war on." A cool mist hung over the fields on each side of
  him, and in the early morning stray cobwebs glistening with moisture brushed
  lightly across his face.</p>

  <p>"<i>B'jour, monsieur.</i>" A woman standing in the door of a roadside
  <i>estaminet</i> greeted him as he passed&mdash;a woman undisturbed by the
  guns that at times roared close by; a woman whose house was one concentrated
  draught, which whistled through what had once been walls and now were holes
  held together by odd bricks.</p>

  <p>He returned the greeting and rode on, while once again the
  comparison&mdash;never far absent from those who live "within
  range"&mdash;came into his mind: the comparison between England and
  France&mdash;between the country which has only learned of war through its
  soldiers, and the country whose women and children have learned of it first
  hand, even unto death. All was absolutely silent&mdash;the peace and glory of
  a summer's morning hung over everything, while the smell of the wet clover
  came faintly to his nostrils. A military policeman at the corner saluted
  smartly, while a small boy in a little cart drawn by three straining dogs
  raced him blithely up the village street. At the end of the battered houses
  still occupied by their owners, and the temporary abode of half a battalion
  of infantry resting from a spell in the trenches, progression by bicycle
  became a little harder. Great branches lay across the road, and pits torn out
  of the pave by bursting shells made steering a trifle intricate; while
  occasionally one of the many signal wires which had slipped during the night
  and was hanging low above his head, scraped the top of his steel helmet.</p>

  <p>Once more the familiar "<i>B'jour, monsieur</i>"&mdash;this time from an
  old dame who sat day in day out in a corner under a wall selling chocolate.
  Just above her head, so that by raising her arm she could have touched it,
  the nose of a "dud" German shell poked out from the brickwork.</p>

  <p>Ruin, desolation&mdash;and shrouding it all the cool damp mist of seven
  o'clock in July.</p>

  <p>"The very man!" A voice hailed him from behind, and a gunner subaltern
  materialised. "Are you going up the line?"</p>

  <p>"I am&mdash;at once." The Sapper placed his bicycle against a heap of
  sandbags. "What does my dear one desire?</p>

  <p>"The accursed Hun placed two large obuses into the Ritz yesterday
  afternoon. What do you propose to do about it?" They were strolling slowly
  through the sopping grass.</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;if I can possibly avoid it," answered the Sapper firmly.
  "You select for an O.P. the most prominent house in the locality&mdash; put a
  signaller on the top of it with a large flag&mdash;wait till midday, when the
  sun is at its brightest, and then send a message back that the bully beef is
  bad. You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Laddie," interrupted the gunner, "desist. All that you say is true and
  more&mdash;but we must stick to the Ritz, if we can. It commands a soul-
  inspiring view of the trenches behind that new crater in a way we can't get
  from anywhere else. What I want you to do is to cover the cellar with boards.
  Yesterday the second shell knocked two men insensible, and they fell
  backwards into it. As they nearly drowned, it will be obvious, even to your
  intelligence, that it contains&mdash;amongst other things&mdash;water.
  Moreover, the water is deep, and stinketh. If, therefore, my brainy
  <i>confrþre</i>, you will authorise me to draw planks twelve, I myself will
  cover yon hole with my own fair hands. The cadaverous gentleman at your
  store, whose face has been passed over by some heavy body, proved both
  unsympathetic and suspicious this morning when I asked him for them.
  Wherefore, if you will sign&mdash;" He held out a book to the Sapper.</p>

  <p>"'Please issue bearer with twelve planks 9 inch by 2 inch; length, 6
  feet.'" The Sapper glanced at the page and signed. "There you are, James.
  Tell him to get them cut for you."</p>

  <p>"I was going to, dearie. How marvellously your brain grasps the importance
  of these trifling details! Are you passing the Ritz by any chance? If so,
  tell my warriors to come down to the Store."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you coming up?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it's too light. I have to be careful whom I'm seen with." He
  turned back and was quickly lost in the white mist&mdash;though for some time
  afterwards the faint strains of musical items selected from <i>The Bing
  Boys</i> followed the Sapper as he walked on.</p>

  <p>Occasional voices came mysteriously from apparently nowhere, as a party of
  men went up one of the deep communication trenches close by him&mdash;a
  trench invisible in summer until you actually stood over it, for the long
  rank grass hid everything: grass splashed with the red of great masses of
  poppies, and the white of the daisies, with odd little patches of blue
  cornflowers and borage, and buttercups glinting yellow. Just rank luxuriant
  vegetation, run wild&mdash;untouched for more than a year.</p>

  <p>Suddenly out of the mist there loomed the Ritz&mdash;the name of the
  broken-down, shell-battered house which served his late companion as an O.P.
  The Sapper gave the message as requested, and stepped down three stairs into
  the communication trench, which passed close under one of the crumbling
  walls. There was no necessity, as far as safety was concerned, to get into
  the trench for several hundred yards&mdash;the mist effectually prevented any
  chance of being seen from the German lines half a mile farther on.</p>

  <p>But he was mindful to see the condition of the trench&mdash; whether the
  sides were crumbling, and whether the floor was suitably provided with
  trench-boards and bricks. Twisting, winding with the poppies and the weeds
  meeting over his head, and the water brushing off them against his face and
  coat, he walked slowly on. Seven feet deep, perhaps three feet wide, it might
  have been a sunken Devonshire lane in model, and a faint red tinge in the
  soil helped the illusion.</p>

  <p>Stale as it all was, unprofitable and a weariness to the flesh as it had
  all become, the strangeness of it still struck him at times. He wondered
  lazily what the people he knew at home would think if they were following him
  at that moment on a tour of inspection. Especially his Uncle John. Uncle John
  was something in the City, and looked it. He lived near Ascot, and nightly
  slept with a gas-mask beside his bed. He could imagine Uncle John trembling
  audibly in that quiet model lane, and assuring his faithful wife of his
  ability to protect her. He laughed at the picture in his mind, and then with
  a slight frown stopped.</p>

  <p>The trench bent sharply to the right, and almost subconsciously he noticed
  a hole framed in thick wood, half filled in, in the wall in front of him. The
  top had broken. He bent and peered through it. It went right through the wall
  in front, and beyond, the same deep communication trench could be seen
  stretching away. Just a loophole placed in a traverse through which a rifle
  could be fired along a straight thirty yards of trench, if the Germans ever
  got in. But to fire a rifle to any purpose the loop-hole must not be broken,
  and so the Sapper made a note before resuming his stroll.</p>

  <p>Rounding a bend, a big white board at a cross-roads confronted him. It
  advertised two or three salient facts written in large black letters. It
  appeared that by turning to the right one would ultimately reach Leicester
  Square and an aid post, to say nothing of the Charing Cross Road, which was a
  down trench. By turning to the left, on the contrary, one would reach Regent
  Street and a pump. It also stated that the name of our wanderer's present
  route was the Haymarket, and further affirmed that it was an up trench. For
  it will be plain to all that, where a trench is but three feet wide, it is
  essential not to have men going both ways in it&mdash;and further, it will
  also be plain why the aid posts occur in the down ones.</p>

  <p>A further interesting and momentous piece of information was imparted from
  another board, to the effect that the name of the trench by which one could
  reach the pump on one hand and the aid post on the other was Piccadilly, and
  that it constituted the reserve line of the position.</p>

  <p>In other words, it was not merely a communication trench, but was recessed
  and traversed like a fire trench. In very fact, it was a fire
  trench&mdash;the third of the system. In front was the support line, known as
  Pall Mall, and in front of that, again, the firing line, whither later the
  Sapper proposed to wend his way. He wanted to gaze on "the rum jar reputed to
  be filled with explosive." But in the meantime there was the question of the
  pump&mdash;the ever-present question which is associated with all pumps. To
  work or not to work, and the answer is generally in the negative.</p>

  <p>He turned to the left down Piccadilly, wondering what particular ailment
  had attacked this specimen of the breed, and had caused the Adjutant of the
  battalion to write winged words anent it. The aspect of the trench had
  changed; no longer did the red, white, and blue of the tangled wild flowers
  meet over his head, but grey and drab the sandbag walls rose on each side of
  him. Occasionally the mouth of a dug-out yawned in the front of the trench, a
  dark passage cased in with timber, sloping steeply down to the cave below.
  Voices, and sometimes snores, came drowsily up from the bottom, where odd
  bunches of the South Loamshires for a space existed beautifully.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, old man&mdash;how's life?" He rounded a traverse to find an
  officer of the battalion lathering his chin for his morning shave. A cracked
  mirror was scotched up between two sandbags, and a small indiarubber basin
  leaked stealthily on the firing step.</p>

  <p>"So-so! That bally pump of yours won't work again, or so the cook says.
  Jenkins, pass the word along for Smithson. He is the cook, and will tell you
  the whole sordid story."</p>

  <p>"Quiet night?" The Sapper sat down and refilled his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Fairly. They caught one of our fellows in the entrance to his dug-out up
  in the front line with an aerial dart about seven o'clock. Landed just at the
  entrance. Blew the top of his head off. Good boy, too&mdash;just been given
  his stripe. Oh, Smithson!&mdash;tell the Engineer officer about that pump.
  Confound!&mdash;I've shaved a mosquito bite!"</p>

  <p>The cook&mdash;a veteran of many years&mdash;looked at the placidly
  smoking Sapper and cleared his throat. On any subject he was an artist; on
  pumps and the deficiencies of Ally Sloper's Cavalry&mdash;as the A.S.C. is
  vulgarly known&mdash;he was a genius.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, it's like this 'ere. That there pump is a funny kind o' pump.
  Sometimes it gives you water and sometimes it don't."</p>

  <p>"You surprise me," murmured the Sapper.</p>

  <p>"Now, if I might be so bold, sir, I would suggest that another well be
  sunk, sir&mdash;starting fresh-like from the beginning. Then I could keep my
  heye on it, and see that no one wasn't a-monkeying with it. As it is, wot
  with the stuff we're a-getting and the shortage of tea and the distance I
  'ave to go for water, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you expect?" A bitter voice from round the traverse rudely
  interrupted the discourse. "We make pumps to pump water&mdash;not dead rats.
  Wasting my time, that's what it is. Where 'ave I put it? In that there
  perisher Smithson's dug-out, and 'e can 'ave it for his dinner." The plumber
  previously sent up on receipt of the Adjutant's note came round the corner,
  and, seeing his officer, stopped and saluted.</p>

  <p>"That there pump's all right, sir. There was a dead rat in it. They
  <i>will</i> leave the cover off the well." He perceived the horrified
  Smithson, and fixed him with the frozen eye.</p>

  <p>"Right. Then you can rejoin your section." The Sapper rose, the plumber
  departed, the cook faded away, and for a space there was silence.</p>

  <p>"Damn that fellow Smithson&mdash;he's the limit." The Infantry Officer
  laughed. "I'll rend him for this."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes it gives you water, and sometimes it don't," remarked the
  Sapper pensively. "Last time it was a sock. Bye-bye. I hope he'll enjoy his
  dinner."</p>

  <p>He followed the plumber back along Piccadilly, composing in his mind a
  suitable answer to the message of despair from the Adjutant.</p>

  <p>"With ref. to your min. of yesterday I would suggest that a larger flow of
  somewhat purer water would be available if the practice of inserting deceased
  rodents in the delivery pipe was discontinued forthwith. I am fully alive to
  the fact that what the eye does not see the heart does not grieve about, and
  I realise that, viewed from that standpoint only, the grave of the little
  animal in question could not well be improved on. I also realise that it adds
  that flavour to the tea which is so sought after by the true connoisseur.
  But, desiring to view the matter from the clearer vantage point of an
  unbiassed onlooker, I venture to suggest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His meditations were interrupted by a procession of gunners each carrying
  on his shoulder an unpleasant-looking object which resembled a gigantic dumb-
  bell with only one blob on the end&mdash;a huge spherical cannon-ball on a
  steel stalk. They were coming from Leicester Square, and he met them just as
  they turned up the Haymarket. Waiting until they had all gone by, he followed
  on in the rear of the party, which suddenly turned sharp to the left, and
  disappeared into the bowels of the earth.</p>

  <p>"No. 7," murmured the Sapper to himself. "I wonder if the officer is new?"
  He turned to a bombardier standing at the entrance to the passage. "Is your
  officer here?"</p>

  <p>"He's down below, sir." The man drew to one side, and the Sapper passed up
  a narrow deep trench and went "down below" to the trench-mortar emplacement,
  a cave hewn out of the ground much on the principle of an ordinary dug-out.
  But there were certain great differences; for half the roof had been removed,
  and through the hole thus formed streamed in the early morning sun. A screen
  of rabbit wire covered with bits of grass, lying horizontally over the open
  hole when the gun was not firing, helped to conceal it from the prying eyes
  of Hun aeroplanes. Let into the ground and mounted and clamped to a stand was
  the mortar itself&mdash;while beside it sat a very young gunner officer, much
  in the attitude of a mother beside her firstborn. He was obviously new to the
  game, and the Sapper surveyed him with indulgent eye.</p>

  <p>"Good morning." The Gunner looked up quickly. "I'm the Sapper Officer on
  this bit of line. You've just come in, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, early this morning. Everything seems very quiet here."</p>

  <p>"From four till eight or nine it's always peaceful. But I don't know that
  you'll find this spot very quiet once you start pooping off. This particular
  emplacement was spotted some two months ago by the wily Hun, and he got some
  direct hits on it with small stuff. Since then it hasn't been used. There are
  lots of others, you know."</p>

  <p>"I was ordered to come to this one," answered the boy doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Right-oh! my dear fellow&mdash;it's your funeral. I thought I'd just let
  you know. Are you letting drive this morning?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;as soon as I get the order to fire."</p>

  <p>The boy was keen as mustard, and, as I have said, very young&mdash; just
  another infant. He had not long to wait, for hardly were the words out of his
  mouth when a sergeant came in.</p>

  <p>"Captain's compliments, sir, and will you fire two rounds at G. 10 C. 5
  4?"</p>

  <p>Rapidly and without confusion the men did their appointed jobs; the great
  stalk slithered down the gun, the bomb&mdash;big as a football&mdash; filled
  with high explosive was fixed with a detonator, the lanyard to fire the
  charge was adjusted. Then every one cleared out of the emplacement, while the
  Sapper took his stand in the trench outside.</p>

  <p>"Let her rip." The lanyard was pulled, and with a muffled crack the huge
  cannon-ball rose into the air, its steel stalk swaying behind it. Plainly
  visible, it reached its highest point, and still wobbling drunkenly went
  swishing down on to G. 10 C. 54&mdash;or thereabouts. A roar and a great
  column of black smoke rose from the German lines.</p>

  <p>Almost before the report had died away, the gun was sponged out, and
  another inebriated monster departed on its mission. But the Sapper was
  already some way up the Haymarket. It was not his first view of a
  trench-mortar firing.</p>

  <p>A vicious crack from a rifle now and then broke the stillness, and
  proclaimed that the sun was clearing away the morning mist, and that rest-
  time was nearly over; while the sudden rattle of a machine gun close by him,
  indulging in a little indirect fire at a well-known Hun gathering place a
  thousand yards or so behind their lines, disturbed a covey of partridges,
  which rose with an angry whirring of wings. Then came four of those
  unmistakable faint muffled bursts from high above his head, which betokened
  an aeroplane's morning gallop; and even as he automatically jerked his head
  skywards, with a swishing noise something buried itself in the earth not far
  away. It is well to remember that even Archibald's offspring obey the laws of
  gravity, and shells from an anti-aircraft gun, burst they never so high,
  descend sooner or later in the shape of jagged fragments&mdash;somewhere. And
  if the somewhere is your face, upturned to see the fun...!</p>

  <p>The Sapper, with the remembrance fresh in his mind of a pal looking up in
  just such a way a week before, quickly presented the top of his tin hat to
  the skies, and all that might descend from them. There had been that same
  swishing all round them as they stood watching some close shooting at one of
  our own planes. He recalled the moment when he cried suddenly&mdash;"Jove!
  they've got him!" He had turned as he spoke to see the officer with him,
  slipping sideways, knees crumpling, body sagging. "Good God! old man, what is
  it?" The question was involuntary, for as he caught the limp figure&mdash;he
  knew.</p>

  <p>The plane was all right: the German shells had not got it; but a piece of
  shrapnel, the size of a match-box, had passed through that officer's eye, and
  entered his brain. He had laid him on the firing-step, and covered his
  head&mdash;or what was left of it....</p>

  <p>He reached Pall Mall, to be once again confronted with a large white
  notice board. To the right were Boyaux 93 and 94&mdash;to the left, 91 and
  90. Straight on to the front, 92 led to the firing line. With his ultimate
  destination Vesuvius crater and the rum jar in view, he turned to the right,
  and walked along the support trench. It was much the same as Piccadilly: only
  being one degree nearer the front, it was one degree more warlike. Boxes of
  bombs everywhere; stands for rifles on the firing-step, which held them
  rigidly when they fired rifle grenades; and every now and then a row of grey-
  painted rockets with a red top, which in case of emergency send up the
  coloured flares that give the S.O.S. signals to those behind. Also men: men
  who slept and ate and shaved and wrote and got bored. A poor show is trench
  warfare!</p>

  <p>"Look out, sir. They've knocked it in just round the corner last night
  with trench mortars." A sergeant of the South Loamshires was speaking.
  "Having a go at Laburnum Cottage, I'm thinking."</p>

  <p>"What, that sniper's post? Have you been using it?"</p>

  <p>"One of our men in there now, sir. He saw an Allemand go to ground in his
  dug-out half an hour ago through the mist, and he reckons he ought to finish
  breakfast soon, and come out again."</p>

  <p>The Sapper crawled on his stomach over the <i>dÚbris</i> that blocked the
  trench, and stopped at the entrance to Laburnum Cottage, officially known as
  Sniper's Post No. 4. In a little recess pushed out to the front of the
  trench, covered in with corrugated iron and surrounded by sandbags, sprawled
  the motionless figure of a Lance-Corporal. With his eye glued to his
  telescopic sight and his finger on the trigger of his rifle, he seemed hardly
  to be breathing. Suddenly he gave a slight grunt, and the next instant, with
  a sharp crack, the rifle fired.</p>

  <p>"Get him?" asked the Sapper.</p>

  <p>"Dunno, sir," answered the sniper, his eye still fixed to the telescope.
  "Three 'undred yards, and 'e ducked like 'ell. It wasn't far off 'is nibs,
  but one can't tell for sure." He got down and stretched himself. "I've waited
  'alf an 'our for the perisher, too, without no breakfast." He grinned and
  scrambled over the broken-down trench to remedy the latter deficiency, while
  once more the Sapper walked on. No need with this particular regiment to
  suggest rebuilding the broken-in trench; it would be done
  automatically&mdash; which cannot be said of them all.</p>

  <p>At last he reached Boyau 94, and turned up towards the firing-line. Twenty
  yards from the turn a mass of barbed wire crossed the trench above his head,
  the barbed wire which ran in front of the support line. For it is not only
  the fire-trench that is wired&mdash;each line behind is plentifully supplied
  with this beautiful vegetable growth.</p>

  <p>The mist had cleared away, and the morning sun was blazing down from a
  cloudless sky, as he reached the front trench. Just to his left a monstrous
  pair of bellows, slowly heaving up and down under the ministrations of two
  pessimistic miners, sent a little of God's fresh air down to the men in the
  mine-shafts underneath. The moles were there&mdash;the moles who scratched
  and scraped stolidly, at the end of their gallery thirty or forty yards in
  front, deep down under the earth in No Man's Land.</p>

  <p>A steady stream of sandbags filled with the result of their labours came
  up the shaft down which the pipe from the bellows stretched into the
  darkness&mdash;sandbags which must be taken somewhere and emptied, or used to
  revet a bit of trench which needed repair.</p>

  <p>To right and left there stretched the fire-trench&mdash;twisting and
  turning, traversed and recessed&mdash;just one small bit of the edge of
  British land. A hundred yards away, a similar line stretched right and left,
  where other pessimistic miners ministered to other monstrous bellows, and
  Piccadilly was known as Unter den Linden. The strange stagnation of it
  all!</p>

  <p>Look through the periscope at the country in front. Not a sign of life in
  the torn-up crusted earth; not a movement between the two long lines of wire.
  A few poppies here and there, and at one point a motionless grey-green lump
  close to the farther wire. Impossible to tell exactly what it is from the
  periscope&mdash;the range is too far. But, in No Man's Land, such strange
  grey&mdash;and khaki&mdash;lumps may often be seen. The night, a wiring
  party, perhaps a little raid or an officer's patrol, and&mdash;discovery. You
  cannot always get your dead back to the trench, and the laws that govern No
  Man's Land savour of the primitive....</p>

  <p>The Sapper watched the phlegmatic bellows-heaver for a few moments
  curiously. His stoical indifference to any one or anything save the job in
  hand, the wonderful accuracy with which he spat from time to time, the
  appalling fumes from his short clay pipe, all tended to make of him an
  interesting study. Supremely apathetic to friend or foe, Generals or Huns, he
  did his shift without comment and, as far as could be seen, without
  thought.</p>

  <p>"Where are you putting the earth?" asked the Sapper after watching for a
  while.</p>

  <p>"Round corner, in a 'ole." The speaker pointed with his pipe, and the
  subject dropped.</p>

  <p>The officer turned away smiling slightly, and decided on the inspection of
  the rum jar. The answer was clear and succinct, even if not couched in the
  language of the old army discipline. He inspected the hole, and, finding it
  was at the back of the trench, in a crater that was formed nightly by German
  <i>minenwerfer</i>, and that more earth there not only would not block the
  trench but, <i>mirabile dicta</i>, would be an actual advantage, he passed on
  and shortly came to a passage leading out of the front of the trench.</p>

  <p>The passage was labelled Sap No. 130, and presented exactly the same
  appearance as the boyaux which ran out of the support line to the front
  trench. Only when one got into it did the difference become apparent, for
  whereas the boyaux had continued until finally opening into a new trench, the
  sap was a cul-de-sac, and finished abruptly in a little covered-in recess
  built into a miniature mountain of newly-thrown-up earth. And this great,
  tumbled mass of soil was the near lip of Vesuvius crater&mdash;blown up half
  way between the two front lines.</p>

  <p>Over the top of the mountain there was no passage. A man standing or
  crawling there in daytime would have been in full view of German snipers at a
  range of forty yards; while had he accomplished it in safety, he would have
  slithered down the farther side into a great cavity shaped like an egg-cup,
  at the bottom of which a pool of dirty, stagnant water was slowly forming.
  Moreover, if we imagine the man continuing his journey and climbing up the
  other side, he would run the gauntlet of the English snipers as he topped the
  farther lip, before reaching the German sap which ran out in just such a
  similar cul-de-sac to the one already described.</p>

  <p>Thus are craters consolidated; each side holds the lip nearest to them,
  and hurls curses and bombs at his opponents on the other. The distance
  between the sapheads is perhaps twenty or twenty-five yards, instead of the
  hundred odd of the parent fire-trenches; and any closer acquaintanceship is
  barred by the egg-cup crater, which stretches between them.</p>

  <p>"Keep down, sir&mdash;well down. Lot of sniping today." A sergeant of the
  South Loamshires whispered hoarsely to the Sapper as he reached the end of
  the sap&mdash;it is etiquette to whisper in a sap. Three men inside the
  recess were drinking tea with the calmness born of long custom, while lying
  on his side, with a periscope to his eye, was Jackson, the subaltern.</p>

  <p>"Anything fresh, Jacko?" muttered the Sapper, crouching down beside
  him.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I think they're coming closer with their left sap round the
  crater. Their periscope seems to be nearer than it was yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Let's have a look." The two changed position, and the Captain turned the
  periscope gently round until he got the exact direction. Absolute stillness
  brooded over the ground he could see; a few rough strands of wire straggled
  about, and disappeared into the great mound of earth that formed the
  <i>dÚbris</i> of the crater.</p>

  <p>There were the enemies' trenches&mdash;a railway embankment behind them
  with a derelict row of trucks&mdash;a great chimney, gaunt and desolate, with
  the buildings at its foot in ruins. But it was not on these old friends that
  he was concentrating; his target was the bit of ground just in front of him
  that lay close to the thrown-up earth of Vesuvius, along which the German sap
  was reputed to be creeping nearer.</p>

  <p>At last he got what he wanted. Close at hand, perhaps twenty yards away,
  there stuck up out of the ground a motionless stick with something on the
  end&mdash;the German's periscope. Now it is reputed to be a fact by several
  people of apparent truthfulness that it is possible, in circumstances such as
  these, for each watcher to see the other man's eyes reflected from the
  mirrors of the periscopes; and it is an undoubted fact that the laws which
  govern the refraction of light would allow of this phenomenon. Personally, I
  am glad to say I have never seen a German's eye through a periscope; but then
  personally I am inclined to doubt if any one has. It must be quite dreadful
  to see a thing like a poached egg regarding you balefully from the top of a
  stick a few yards away.</p>

  <p>At last the Sapper got up. "He's no nearer, Jacko. What do you think,
  sergeant?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think they were working last night, sir," one of the tea-
  drinkers answered.</p>

  <p>"There was a party of 'em out, and we bunged some bombs. We 'eard 'em
  padding the 'oof back."</p>

  <p>"Been pretty quiet, then?"</p>

  <p>"Except for that there rum jar, sir," answered the sergeant. "We thought
  we was napoo[1] when we 'eard that little bundle of fun a-coming."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen it, Jacko?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it rolled into the sap, and I've had it put into the fire-trench.
  I'm taking it back to blow it up. I think it's a percussion fuse, but it
  seems fairly safe. I've sent for a stretcher to carry it on."</p>

  <p>"Let's go and have a look at it."</p>

  <p>The two officers walked down the sap and back into the trench, and started
  to investigate with a professional eye the object lying on the fire-step.
  Apparently of steel, and painted a dull grey, it looked harmless
  enough&mdash;but all those little love offerings of the Hun are treated with
  respect. About the size of an ordinary rum jar, with a fuse of sorts in place
  of a neck, it was at the time an unknown brand of abomination, to them at any
  rate.</p>

  <p>"It differs only in appearance, I fear," remarked the Captain, after
  inspecting it gingerly, "from other presents they give us. Its object is
  undoubtedly nefarious. Where do you propose to blow it up?"</p>

  <p>"In that little quarry near the Ritz. Will that do all right?"</p>

  <p>"Most excellently." With a smile he looked at his watch. "Just set your
  watch by mine, Jacko&mdash;and poop it off at 10.5 ak emma. Do you take
  me?"</p>

  <p>The other looked puzzled for a moment; then his face cleared.</p>

  <p>"I'd forgotten for the moment that Centre Battalion Head-quarters was not
  far from the quarry," he grinned. "Sir&mdash;I take you."</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, the day is hot, and the Pumpkin is fat, and the flies are
  glutinous. He doesn't want to see the trenches any more than I do&mdash; and
  one's mission in life is to anticipate the wishes of the great."</p>

  <p>It was just as he finished speaking that from up the line in the direction
  of the Haymarket there came four dull, vicious cracks in succession, and some
  clouds of black smoke drifted slowly over his head.</p>

  <p>"Just about No. 7 T.M. emplacement," he muttered to himself. "I hope to
  heavens..."</p>

  <p>"Put it on the stretcher carefully, boys." His subaltern was speaking to
  the two men who had arrived with a stretcher. "Have you got the slab of gun-
  cotton?"</p>

  <p>"Corporal 'Amick 'as gone to get it at the store, sir. He's a-going to
  meet us at the quarry."</p>

  <p>"Right-ho! Walk march."</p>

  <p>The cavalcade departed, and the Captain resumed his morning walk, while
  his thoughts wandered to the beer which is cold and light yellow. For many
  weary months had he taken a similar constitutional daily; not always in the
  same place, true; but variety is hard to find in the actual trenches
  themselves. It is the country behind that makes the difference.</p>

  <p>Time was when communication trenches existed only in the fertile brain of
  those who were never called upon to use them; but that time has passed long
  since. Time was when the thin, tired breaking line of men who fought the
  Prussian Guard at Ypres in 1914&mdash;and beat them&mdash;had hard work to
  find the fire-trenches, let alone the communication ones; when a daily
  supervision was a nerve-shattering nightly crawl, and dug-outs were shell-
  holes covered with a leaking mackintosh. It was then that men stood for three
  weeks on end in an icy composition of water and slime, and if by chance they
  did get a relief for a night, merely clambered out over the back, and
  squelched wearily over the open ground with bullets pinging past them from
  the Germans a few score yards away.</p>

  <p>But now there are trenches in canal banks where dead things drift slowly
  by, and trenches in railway embankments where the rails are red with rust and
  the sleepers green with rot; there are trenches in the chalk, good and deep,
  which stand well, and trenches in the slush and slime which never stand at
  all; there are trenches where the smell of the long grass comes sweetly on
  the west wind, and trenches where the stench of death comes nauseous on the
  east. And one and all are they damnable, for ever accursed...</p>

  <p>But the country behind&mdash;ah! there's where the difference comes. You
  may have the dead flat of pastoral Flanders, the little woods, the plough,
  the dykes of Ypres and Boesinghe; you may have the slag-heaps and smoking
  chimneys of La BassÚe and Loos; you may have the gently undulating country of
  Albert and the Somme. Each bears the marks of the German beast&mdash;and,
  like their inhabitants, they show those marks differently. Ypres and the
  North, apathetic, seemingly lifeless; the mining districts, grim and dour;
  the rolling plains still, in spite of all, cheerful and smiling. But
  underlying them all&mdash;deep implacable determination, a grand national
  hatred of the Power who has done this thing....</p>

  <p>He turned out of the Old Kent Road into a siding which harboured the dug-
  outs of the Centre Battalion.</p>

  <p>"Is the General here yet, Murdock?" A tall sergeant of the
  regiment&mdash;an old friend of his&mdash;flattened himself against the side
  of the trench to let him pass.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir." The sergeant's face was expressionless, though his eyes
  twinkled. "I think, sir, as 'ow the General is feeling the 'eat. 'E seems
  worried. 'E's been trying to telephone."</p>

  <p>The Sapper, with a suppressed chuckle, went down some steps into a
  spacious dug-out. The darkness made him temporarily blind, so he saluted and
  stood still just inside the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Damn you, don't blow at me! What's that fool blowin' down the thing for?
  I <i>have</i> pressed a button&mdash;confound you!&mdash;and rung the bell
  twice. No&mdash;I didn't ring off; somebody blew at me, and the machine fell
  on the floor."</p>

  <p>"The General is trying to get through to his château." A voice full of
  unholy joy whispered in the Sapper's ear, and that worthy, whose eyes had got
  accustomed to the gloom, recognised the Adjutant.</p>

  <p>"I gathered that something of the sort was occurring," he whispered
  back.</p>

  <p>But the General was at it again. "Who are you&mdash;the R.T.O.? Well, ring
  off. Exchange. Exchange. It is the Divisional General speaking. I want my
  head-quarters. I say, I want my&mdash;oh, don't twitter, and the bally
  thing's singin' now! First it blows and then it sings. Good God! what's
  that?"</p>

  <p>A deafening explosion shook the dug-out, and a shower of earth and stones
  rained down in the trench outside.</p>

  <p>"They're very active this morning, sir," said the Sapper, stepping
  forward. "Lot of rum jars and things coming over."</p>

  <p>"Are you the Sapper officer? Good morning. I wish you'd get this accursed
  instrument to work."</p>

  <p>"There may be a line broken," he remarked tactfully.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I shall have to go back; I can't hear a word. The thing does
  nothin' but squeak. Now it's purring like a cat. I hate cats. Most annoyin'.
  I wanted to come round the front line this morning."</p>

  <p>"In very good condition, sir; I've just been all round it. Mighty hot up
  there, General&mdash;and swarms of flies."</p>

  <p>"And they're puttin' over some stuff, you say?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;quite a lot."</p>

  <p>"Hum! Well, of course, I fully intended to come round&mdash;but, dash it
  all, I must get back. Can't hear a word the fellow says. Does nothing but
  play tunes." The Pumpkin rose and stalked to the door. "Well, I'll come round
  another morning, my boy. I wonder, by Jove! if that last one was meant for
  this head-quarters? Devilish near, you know." He walked up the stairs,
  followed by his staff officer. "Good mornin'&mdash;mind you see about that
  telephone. Cursed thing blows."</p>

  <p>"Dear old Pumpkin," murmured the Adjutant as his steps died away. "He's a
  topper. His figure's against him, but he's got the heart of a lion."</p>

  <p>"He has," answered the Sapper, preparing to follow his footsteps. "And the
  men would do anything for him."</p>

  <p>"What price that rum jar I sent in a bird about?"</p>

  <p>"That was the last explosion you heard," laughed the Sapper. "I wasn't
  leaving anything to chance. I am going to go and drink beer&mdash;iced beer,
  in long glasses. <i>Toujours à toi</i>."</p>

  <p>He was gone, leaving the Adjutant staring. A few moments later he
  clambered out of the trench, and struck out for the crumbling church that
  betokened a road and the near presence of his bicycle.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A day of peace&mdash;yes, as things go, a day of perfect
  peace. Away down South things were moving; this was stagnation. And
  yet&mdash;well, it was at dinner that night...</p>

  <p>"For the fourteenth night in succession I rise to a point of order." The
  Doctor was speaking. "Why is the lady with the butterfly on her back pushed
  away into one corner, and that horrible woman with the green wig accorded the
  place of honour?"</p>

  <p>I would hurriedly state that the Doctor's remarks were anent two pictures

  <p>"Yes, the lady with the gween wig is dweadful." The boy sipped his
  port.</p>

  <p>"Infant, I'm shocked at you. The depravity of these children
  nowadays..."</p>

  <p>An orderly came into the room with an envelope, which he handed to the
  Captain.</p>

  <p>The C.O. spread out the flimsy paper and frowned slightly as he read the
  message.</p>

  <p>"T.M. Emp. No. 7, completely wrecked by a direct hit 9.30 a.m. this
  morning, A.A.A. Please inspect and report, A.A.A., C.R.E., 140th
  Division."</p>

  <p>"Delayed as usual," grunted the Scotchman. "I was there just after it
  happened, and reported it to the O.C. Trench Mortars. Did you not hear, sir,
  for it's useless repairing it? That position is too well known."</p>

  <p>"Were there any casualties?" The Sapper Captain's voice was quiet.</p>

  <p>"Aye. The poor lad that was crooning over his gun when I saw him this
  morning, like a cat over her undrowned kitten, just disappeared."</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean, Mac?"</p>

  <p>"It was one of the big ones, and it came right through the wire on top of
  him." The gruff voice was soft. "Poor bairn!"</p>

     name="story12">XII. &mdash; OVER THE TOP</a></h2>

  <h3>Previously published in <i>No Man's Land</i></h3>

  <p class="first">"On the afternoon of the 21st we gained a small local
  success. Our line was advanced on a front of six hundred yards, over an
  average depth of a quarter of a mile. All the ground gained was successfully
  consolidated. Up to date eighty-six unwounded prisoners have passed through
  the corps cage, of whom three are officers."</p>

  <p>Thus ran the brief official notice so tersely given in the "Intelligence
  Summary," known to the ribald as "Comic Cuts"; later it will appear even more
  tersely in the daily communiquÚ which delights the matutinal kipper and twin
  eggs of England. It's all so simple; it all sounds such a ridiculously easy
  matter to those who read. Map maniacs stab inaccurate maps with pins; a few
  amateur strategists discourse at length, and with incredible ignorance, on
  the bearing it&mdash;and countless other similar operations&mdash; will have
  on the main issue. And the vast majority remark gloomily to the other members
  of the breakfast table that there is nothing in the paper as usual. Nothing,
  my friend! I wonder....</p>

  <p>This is not a story; there is no plot; it is just what happens every day
  somewhere or other in the land of glutinous, stinking mud, where the soles
  are pulled off a man's boots when he walks and horses go in up to their
  bellies; where one steers a precarious and slippery course on the narrow
  necks of earth that separate shell holes, and huddled things stare up at the
  sky with unseeing eyes. They went "over the top" themselves&mdash;ten days
  ago&mdash;in just such another local success. Nothing, my friend! Perhaps
  you're right; it's mainly a sense of proportion that is needed in war, as in
  other things....</p>

  <p>"Good morning, dear old soul." The machine-gun officer emerged from a
  watery hole of doubtful aspect, covered with a dented sheet of corrugated
  iron and a flattened-out biscuit tin&mdash;the hole that is, not the officer.
  "We have slept well, thank you; and the wife and family are flourishing.
  Moreover&mdash;you're late."</p>

  <p>The Sapper regarded him pessimistically through the chilly mist of an
  October dawn. "Entirely owing to my new and expensive waders being plucked
  from my feet with a sucking noise. A section of haggard men are now engaged
  in salvage operations. Shall we process?"</p>

  <p>"We shall&mdash;in one sweet moment, not before. Sweet, brave heart,
  because&mdash;" He put his head round the corner. "Jones&mdash;the raspberry
  wine&mdash;<i>toute suite</i>. Just a hollow tooth full, and we will gambol
  like young lambs the whole long weary way."</p>

  <p>"It is well," remarked the Sapper, returning the empty mug to the soldier
  servant. "Personally I like it burnt at night, with a noggin of port. You put
  it in a mug, add three spoonfuls of sugar, set light to it, and let it burn
  for seven minutes. Then add some port, and drink hot. Man, you can lead an
  army corps..." His voice died away as the two officers departed on their
  three-mile squelch to the front line, and the unshaven Jones gazed after them
  admiringly.</p>

  <p>"A hartist!" he murmured admiringly, "a plurry hartist. Personally, the
  rasberry juice, any old 'ow for me." He disappeared from view, and further
  disclosures would be tactless....</p>

  <p>And so we lift the curtain on the dawn of the 21st. Doubtless the setting
  is frivolous, but it has served to introduce two of the supers who go to make
  up the final scene. In the portion of the front line for which they were
  bound there lay the battalion which was cast for the principal part, and it
  is the prerogative of stars to have their entrance led up to....</p>

  <p>The mist hung thick over the shell-torn ground as the two officers walked
  on. In places stretches of half-demolished wire and blown-in trenches showed
  where the Germans had put up a fight. Stray graves, ours and theirs, were
  dotted about promiscuously, and little heaps of dirty and caked equipment
  showed that salvage work was in progress. Away to the left a few crumbling
  walls and shattered trees marked a one-time prosperous agricultural village,
  from which with great regularity there came the sighing drone of a German
  crump followed by a column of black smoke and a shower of bricks and
  <i>dÚbris</i>. But the place was dead; its inhabitants gone&mdash;God knows
  where. And soldiers: well, soldiers have a rooted dislike to dead villages
  near the trenches.</p>

  <p>A strange squat object loomed suddenly into sight&mdash;a well-known
  landmark to those who wandered daily behind the lines. Derelict, motionless,
  it lay on a sunken road, completely blocking it; and the sunken road was
  heavy with the stench of death. It is not good for the Hun to take liberties
  with a tank, even if it is temporarily <i>hors-de-combat</i>.</p>

  <p>A man limping wearily, his head bandaged, his face unshaved, his khaki
  coated with half-dry mud, plodded heavily towards them.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me the way to the dressing-station, sir?" He had stopped
  and, swaying slightly, stood in front of the two officers.</p>

  <p>"Straight on, lad. You'll find it somewhere back there." The machine-gun
  officer pointed vaguely into the mist. "About half a mile."</p>

  <p>"You ain't got a drop of water, 'ave you, sir? The water party got lost
  last night, and we've only had about a teacupful this last twenty-four
  hours."</p>

  <p>But when going up to visit the trenches water-bottles are a useless
  encumbrance, and, with a tired sigh, the wounded Tommy resumed his thirsty
  way in the direction of the dressing-station.</p>

  <p>"Cooked, poor devil," remarked the Sapper, as he disappeared. "Pretty
  nearly finished."</p>

  <p>"But he'll be his mother's own bright boy again when he gets his nose
  inside that aid post. We go left here, I think."</p>

  <p>They paused for a moment to get their bearings&mdash;a matter of some
  importance and no little difficulty.</p>

  <p>It may seem an easy thing to walk up to the trenches. One goes on, and
  ultimately one arrives, the casual reader will surmise. And with luck the
  casual reader will be right. But there are certain small points which may
  have escaped his ken and which render the task of reaching the front line a
  trifle harder than walking to the club for lunch.</p>

  <p>In the first place the aspect of the ground is not of that cheerful and
  varied type which has inspired so many gifted landscape painters. No trees
  and little rivers, no cottages and flowering paths delight one's eye. It is
  impossible to say: "Take the turn to the left after passing the cactus bush,
  and keep straight on till you come to the asparagus bed; and then you'll see
  the front trench on your right."</p>

  <p>The local cactus bush or its equivalent is hurled into space twice daily,
  thereby largely interfering with its use as a landmark. The local asparagus
  bed or its equivalent differs only from the remainder of the ground in the
  fact that a mule passed peacefully away on it some weeks previously. And one
  day even that difference vanished. The mule passed away again&mdash;in small
  fragments.</p>

  <p>Even the front trenches where they exist have a variegated career. At
  certain periods quite a large proportion of them are in the air at the same
  time, in company with the village just behind; and when they come down again
  it is more than likely their position will change to the next row of damp and
  unpleasant holes.</p>

  <p>That is the trouble: the whole ground is one huge hole. Holes are the only
  features of the landscape: big holes, little holes, damp ones, smelly ones;
  holes occupied and holes to let; holes you fall into and holes you
  don't&mdash;but, holes. Everywhere holes. The cactus bush is a hole; the
  asparagus bed is a hole; the trenches are holes. The whole country looks like
  a disease. A large amount of the wandering must perforce be done at night;
  and should the casual reader still doubt the difficulty of finding one's way,
  let him imagine three voluntary descents, and as many compulsory ones, into
  the wet brand of hole; let him further imagine a steady downpour of rain, no
  sign of a star, and a shrewd suspicion that if he's walked as far as he
  thinks he has in the right direction he ought to be in the front line; and
  then let him imagine&mdash;holes. Whenever he moves he either negotiates or
  fails to negotiate&mdash; holes. Having, in scrambling out of holes turned
  round twice he doesn't know which way he's facing; he only knows there
  are&mdash;holes. Toc&mdash; toc&mdash;toc; the slow tapping of a German
  machine-gun sounds from the direction he had fondly imagined Battalion
  Head-quarters to be; the swish of bullets come nearer as the Hun sweeps the
  ground; a flare goes up, showing&mdash; holes. Another compulsory descent; a
  phut! as a bullet passes over his head, and the swishing passes on. Shortly
  that swishing will come back, and in the meantime are there not&mdash;holes?
  But as for the front trench, whither he is bound, the contest is unequal. No
  man can fight&mdash;holes.</p>

  <p>A further point which is worthy of remark <i>en passant</i> may possibly
  escape the notice of the uninitiated. It is a well-known fact, and will be
  vouched for by all who have experienced the Somme, that that part of the
  ground which is not hole is carried, like the unexpended portion of the day's
  rations, on the person. Acres of soil have been removed from their original
  abode and have been carried laboriously to other acres. They have then been
  brought back again; not by boot only, but by hand, and face, by hair and
  teeth. It is reported&mdash;though I will not vouch for the accuracy of the
  statement&mdash;that on one occasion a relieving battalion completely
  defeated a small German counter-attack by standing on the parapet and kicking
  viciously towards the advancing Huns. The enormous mass of soil thus
  propelled not only crushed the hated foe but effectually buried him. However,
  that is by the way. We are digressing far from the Sapper and the machine-gun
  officer who stood by a derelict tank in the damp mist of an October dawn and
  cogitated on the direction of their particular piece of front line.</p>

  <p>"It is amazing," said a voice behind them, "that man can have descended to
  such a state of congenital idiocy as to do all this to an inoffensive carrot
  field."</p>

  <p>The Brigade-Major, followed by the Brigadier, joined the two officers.
  Behind them the signal officer plucked France from his face. And then of a
  sudden five officers disappeared. A droning roar rose with extreme rapidity
  to that pitch of loudness that denotes undesirable closeness; a mass of black
  fumes and flying mud shot up twenty odd yards away; a flight of cockchafers
  seemed to pass into the distance as the jagged fragments whizzed
  overhead&mdash;and five faces appeared as suddenly from the ground. Holes
  have their uses at times.</p>

  <p>"This sunken road is always hairy," remarked the signal
  officer&mdash;known to his intimates as Sigs&mdash;giving the General a
  hand-up from his particular lair. "It were unwise to linger, sir."</p>

  <p>"Another quarter-mile and we hit Essex Trench," remarked the Brigade-
  Major. "Sally's head-quarters are there." The five officers passed on,
  squelching loudly, and once again peace and silence reigned in the sunken
  road....</p>

  <p>And now we come to the principal actors in the drama. Crowded in Essex
  Trench, damp with mist, were the men of the South Loamshires. A few were
  scribbling notes, and an all-pervading smell of frying bacon permeated the
  air. One or two, wrapped in great-coats, with a mackintosh sheet over them,
  still slept peacefully&mdash;but the whole regiment was stirring into life.
  The morning of the day had come. To many it was a new experience; to others
  it was stale&mdash;going over the top. But, new or old, not a man but
  realised that by evening the roll of the regiment would have many gaps; new
  or old, not a man but realised that his name might be one of those gaps. Just
  the luck of the game; perhaps nothing, perhaps a Blighty, perhaps...</p>

  <p>It is well without doubt that the lower the intelligence the less the
  imagination. To ninety per cent. of these men the situation lost much of its
  edge; to the remaining ten the edge was sharpened. What is to be is to be, in
  war as elsewhere. Fatalism as regards one's own prospects is inevitable;
  essential. But fatalism is an unsatisfying creed; the word "Why?" is apt to
  creep into the back of a man's mind, and the word "Why?" when the
  intelligence is low, is a dangerous one. For the word "Why?" can only be
  satisfactorily answered by the realisation of the bigness of the issue; by
  the knowledge that individual effort is imperative if collective success is
  to be obtained; by the absolute conviction that no man can be a law unto
  himself. To the ten per cent. these facts were clear; but then, to the ten
  per cent. the "Why?" was louder. The factor of their composition which said
  to them "Why?"&mdash;clearly and insistently&mdash;even as they lay
  motionless under their coats or outwardly wrangled for bacon and
  tea&mdash;that very factor supplied the answer.</p>

  <p>To the thinkers and dreamers there comes at such times the greater
  knowledge: the knowledge which lifts them above self and the trivialities of
  their own lives; the knowledge that is almost Divine. They appreciate the
  futility&mdash;but they realise the necessity. And in their hearts they laugh
  sardonically as the shadow of Dream's End clouds the sky. The utter futility
  of it all&mdash;the utter necessity now that futility has caught the world.
  Then they realise the bacon is cold&mdash;and curse.</p>

  <p>To the ninety per cent. it is not so. Not theirs to reason so acutely, not
  theirs to care so much; to them the two dominant features of this
  war&mdash;death and boredom&mdash;appeal with far less force. For both depend
  so utterly on imagination in their effect on the individual. Death is only
  awful in anticipation; boredom only an affliction to the keen-witted. So to
  the ninety, perhaps, the "Why?" does not sound insistently. It is as well,
  for if the answer is not forthcoming there is danger, as I have said. And one
  wonders sometimes which class produces the best results for the business in
  hand&mdash;the business of slaughtering Huns.... The small one that rises to
  great heights and sinks to great depths, or the big one, the plodders.</p>

  <p>But I have digressed again. It is easy to wander into by-paths when the
  main road is prosaic, and the study of a body of men before an
  attack&mdash;the men who fear and don't show it, the men who fear and try not
  to show it, the men who don't care a hang what happens&mdash;cannot but grip
  the observer who has eyes to see. Almost does he forget his own allotted part
  in the drama; the psychology of the thing is too absorbing. And it can only
  be realised when seen first hand.</p>

  <p>Let us leave them there for the time&mdash;that battalion of the South
  Loamshires. Sally&mdash;as the C.O. is generally known&mdash;has talked with
  the Brigadier and the Brigade-Major. He knows that zero hour is 11.30 a.m.;
  he knows his objective&mdash;Suffolk Trench; he knows the strong point at its
  northern end which the sappers are going to consolidate. The Sapper has found
  his section subaltern and his section nursing coils of barbed wire and
  shovels, and has been informed with much blasphemy that the guide had lost
  his way, and the party had been wandering all night. The machine-gun officer
  has delivered words of wisdom to various guns' crews&mdash;both Lewis and
  otherwise&mdash;who came under his eagle eye at intervals along the trench.
  Just the prosaic main road; the details are tedious; the actual orders
  uninteresting. The attack would either succeed or it would fail; the strong
  point would either be consolidated or it would not. The orders&mdash;the
  details&mdash;are necessary adjuncts to the operation; of no more interest
  than the arrangements for pulling up the fire curtain. Only if the fire
  curtain sticks, the play is robbed of much of its natural charm to the
  onlooker.</p>

  <p>"Bring me some more breakfast. That walk gives one the devil of a hunger."
  The Brigadier was back once more in his dug-out, while, outside, the mist had
  lifted and the autumn sun shone down on a world of mud.</p>

  <p>The Brigade-Major was shaving; the Staff Captain&mdash;a non-starter in
  the morning's walk&mdash;was demanding corrugated iron from the unmoved
  Sapper.</p>

  <p>"I tell you this roof is a disgrace. Cascades of water pour through into
  the soup at dinner. Why don't you do something?"</p>

  <p>"What do you propose I should do, brave heart? Sit on the roof and catch
  it?"</p>

  <p>The subject was a complicated one, touching deep problems of supply and
  demand, to say nothing of carrying parties; so let us leave them to their
  warfare.</p>

  <p>The signal officer was looking wise over something that boomed and buzzed
  alternately; the machine-gun officer may, or may not, have been enjoying
  another toothful.</p>

  <p>In short, the supers, the stage-managers had departed. The last directions
  had been given, and the play was due to start in an hour and a quarter. All
  that could be done for its success had been done by those who were behind;
  now it was up to the men who sat and sprawled in the mud-holes in front, with
  the blue smoke of their cigarettes curling upwards and their equipment and
  rifles stacked beside them.</p>

  <p>A desultory bombardment on each side droned stolidly on, while away to the
  front three British aeroplanes, seemingly come from nowhere, tumbled and
  looped round two Germans like mosquitoes over a pool. A row of sausage
  balloons like a barber's rash adorned the sky as far as the eye could see.
  Just an everyday scene on the Somme, and meanwhile the actors waited.</p>

  <p>"Come up to the top. There's ten minutes to go." The Staff Captain and the
  Sapper&mdash;their dispute settled&mdash;strolled amicably to the top of the
  hill behind the dug-out and produced their field-glasses. Away in front Essex
  Trench could be seen, and the men inside it, standing to. For them the period
  of suspense was nearly over&mdash;the curtain was just going up.</p>

  <p>"One minute." The Sapper snapped his watch to and focussed his glasses.
  "They're on."</p>

  <p>Suddenly from all around, as if touched by a spring, an ear-splitting din
  leaped into life. In the valley behind them it seemed as if hundreds of
  tongues of flame were darting and quivering, sprouting from what a moment
  before was barren ground. The acrid smell of cordite drifted over them, while
  without cessation there came the solemn boom&mdash;boom&mdash;boom of the
  heavier guns way back. Like the <i>motif</i> of an opera, the field-guns and
  light howitzers cracked and snorted, permeating everything with one
  continuous blast of sound; while the sonorous roar and rumble of the giant
  pieces behind&mdash;slower, as befitted them&mdash;completed the mighty
  orchestra. Neither man could hear the other speak; but then, they were both
  watching too intently for that.</p>

  <p>Hardly had hell been let loose when a line of men arose from Essex Trench
  and walked steadily to their front. Just ahead of them great clouds of smoke
  rose belching from the ground: clouds into which they vanished at times, only
  to reappear a moment later. They were advancing behind a creeping barrage,
  and advancing with the steadiness of automatic machines.</p>

  <p>"Good lads! Good lads!" The Staff Captain's lips framed the words; his
  voice was inaudible.</p>

  <p>Every now and then a man pitched forward and lay still; or muttered a
  curse as he felt the sting of something in his arm. A section on the left
  dropped suddenly, only to worm on again by ones and twos, trying to avoid the
  dreaded toc-toc&mdash;slow and menacing&mdash;of a German machine-gun. Then
  the bombers were there. Crouching back, a man would pull the pin out of his
  bomb, run forward, and hurl it into the trench where the Germans were huddled
  in groups. And away behind the South Loamshires, on the shell-pocked ground
  that now boiled and heaved like some monstrous sulphur spring, with thick
  black and yellow fumes drifting slowly across it, there lay the first fruits
  of the harvest: a few of the gaps in the evening's roll-call.</p>

  <p>On the flank a machine-gun was going, taking them in enfilade. In front,
  Germans&mdash;numbers of Germans&mdash;glared snarling at them out of the
  trench, or whimpered in a corner with arms upraised, as was the nature of the
  beasts. A non-commissioned officer picked up a bomb and hurled it at the
  advancing platoon sergeant; only to cry "<i>Kamerad</i>" when it failed to
  explode....</p>

  <p>And so the South Loamshires, or such as were left of them, came to their
  objective; the first part of the play was over. The machine-gunner who had
  enfiladed them passed in his checks, fighting to the end, brained with the
  butt of a rifle.</p>

  <p>Occasionally a wounded man crawled into the trench; a German officer sat
  sullenly in a corner stanching a gaping hole in his leg. Behind them, towards
  the Essex Trench, the air was now clearer; the bombardment had moved over the
  line they had won, and thundered down on the German communications.</p>

  <p>"Runner!" A Company Commander stood shakily trying to patch up a wound in
  his arm. As far as he could tell from a hasty reconnaissance, he was the
  senior officer present. "Give this to the C.O.: 'Objectives won. Situation on
  right doubtful. Estimated casualties two hundred.'" He handed the man a slip
  of paper.</p>

  <p>At a steady lope the runner went over the back of the trench, into the
  barrage of German shrapnel and high explosive. They saw him reach it, stop
  suddenly, twist round, and slither slowly forward.</p>

  <p>"Runner down, sir." A sergeant standing by spoke almost casually.</p>

  <p>"Runner!" Once again the officer called; once again a man went off at a
  jog-trot. They saw him reach his predecessor; stop a moment and bend down. He
  looked round and shook his head and went steadily on. The luck of the
  game&mdash;that's all. And it's only when one's sitting still&mdash;waiting,
  that one asks "Why?" Ten minutes later he was with the C.O., waiting for the
  answer to take back.</p>

  <p>And so the drama is over; the play has been a success. From the wings the
  Staff Captain and the Sapper have returned to Brigade Head-quarters.</p>

  <p>"Saw 'em getting over the top, sir. Then they got into the smoke and we
  lost 'em. Like a witches' cauldron."</p>

  <p>"We shan't hear anything for two hours." The General thoughtfully knocked
  the ashes out of his pipe. They were his men who had gone into that witches'
  cauldron; with them daily he lived and daily died. Their Dream's End was his
  too. But&mdash;a sense of proportion, always. "We might as well have lunch,"
  he remarked casually.</p>

  <p>Gradually the bombardment died away, though from time to time the guns
  burst into sullen mutterings, as though hungry at being baulked of their
  food.</p>

  <p>The same old aeroplanes&mdash;or different ones&mdash;buzzed busily about;
  the same old stoical balloons looked more rash-like than ever.</p>

  <p>And then suddenly outside the brigade office there was a stir.</p>

  <p>A runner had hove in sight, and the signal officer emerged to get his
  tidings.</p>

  <p>"Good," he muttered to himself; "the old man will be pleased." He went
  into the General's dug-out.</p>

  <p>"Message just through, sir, from C.O. South Loamshires: 'Objectives
  obtained. A.A.A. Situation on right somewhere obscure. A.A.A. Estimated
  casualties 200 all ranks. A.A.A. Will be consolidated tonight. A.A.A.'"</p>

  <p>The "old man" <i>was</i> pleased.</p>

  <p>And so, on the afternoon of the 21st, we gained a small local success. We
  advanced our line on a front of six hundred yards over an average depth of a
  quarter of a mile, etc., etc.</p>

  <p>It wasn't much, my friends at home; but&mdash;that runner will run no
  more, and some eighty odd of that odd two hundred have cooked their last
  ration of bacon. Their "Why?" is answered.</p>

  <p>No, it wasn't much; but it wasn't&mdash;nothing.</p>

  <h2><a id="story13"
     name="story13">XIII. &mdash; BENDIGO JONES&mdash;HIS TREE</a></h2>

  <h3>Previously published in <i>No Man's Land</i></h3>

  <p class="first">My story&mdash;such as it is&mdash;concerns a camouflage
  tree and Bendigo Jones: both of which&mdash;or whom&mdash;will require a
  little more introduction. That Bendigo would indignantly repudiate any such
  necessity, I am fully aware; nevertheless, even at the risk of offending him,
  I propose to outline briefly his claims to greatness, before embarking on the
  incident in his military career which forms the subject of these pages.</p>

  <p>First however&mdash;the camouflage tree. It is only meet that the material
  and sordid details of the stage properties should be given, before branching
  into any discussion of the capabilities of the actor. The phrase, then, does
  not imply&mdash;as the ignorant might possibly be led to believe&mdash;a new
  type of tree. It does not grow in the tropics amongst a riotous tangle of
  pungent undergrowth; it does not creak sadly in the north wind on the open
  hill. It shelters not the hibiscus anthropoid, it gives not lodging to the
  two-tailed newt. From a botanical point of view, the tree is a complete and
  utter frost. It is, in point of hard and bitter fact, not a tree at all.</p>

  <p>"Camouflage" is that which conceals: it is a fraud, and speaketh not the
  truth. I am not even certain whether it is a noun or a preposition, but the
  point is immaterial. Along with other canons of military matters, its virtue
  lies in its application rather than in its etymology. What the eye doth not
  see the trench mortars do not trouble is as true today as when Noah first
  mentioned the fact; and camouflage is the application of this mighty
  dictum.</p>

  <p>The value of any particular piece of camouflage depends entirely on its
  capability for deceit; but to the youthful enthusiast I would speak a word of
  warning. I have in mind the particular case of young Angus MacTaggart, a lad
  from Glasgow, with freckles and a sunny disposition. He was a sapper by
  trade, and on his shoulders there devolved, on one occasion, the job of
  covering a trench mortar emplacement with a camouflage of wire and grass
  which would screen the hole in which sat the mortar from the prying gaze of
  Hun aeroplanes. It was a deep hole, for the mortar was large; and the screen
  of wire was fastened to a framework of wood. When the gun wished to do its
  morning hate, a pessimistic individual first scoured the heavens with his
  glasses in search of Hun planes. If the scouring revealed nothing, the screen
  was lowered, and the gun was made ready. Then the detachment faded away, and
  the gun was fired by a man of great personal bravery by means of a long
  string. Ever since the first trench mortars, which consisted of a piece of
  piping down which a jam-tin bomb was dropped, in the hopes that when the
  charge at the bottom was lighted, the bomb would again emerge, I have
  regarded trench mortars as dangerous and unpleasant objects, and the people
  who deal with them as persons of a high order of courage. One remembers the
  times when the bomb did not emerge, but stuck half way and exploded
  violently; one remembers when the entire gun fell over and propelled the bomb
  in the direction of battalion headquarters; above all, one remembers the
  loathing and contumely with which the mere arrival of the trench mortar in
  any part of the trenches was greeted. Then there was no attempt at
  camouflage; one's sole endeavour was to avoid being killed by the beastly
  thing.</p>

  <p>To return, however, to Angus. Though of a sunny disposition, as I have
  said, he was a somewhat earnest individual&mdash;and thorough withal. He
  determined that as a camouflage, <i>his</i> should stand pre-eminent; it
  should be the model and pattern of all camouflages. He succeeded.</p>

  <p>Labouring at night&mdash;largely with his own fair hands&mdash;he produced
  a screen cunningly woven with grasses and weeds which he swore would defy the
  most lynx-eyed pilot. He even went so far as to place in the centre of it a
  large bunch of nettles, which he contended gave it an air of insouciance and
  lightheartedness that had been lacking before.</p>

  <p>Now, as I mentioned above, the value of camouflage depends on its
  capability for deceit; and it is by this criterion that I claim his work as a
  success. It should be added, however, in no uncertain tones, that it is the
  Germans whom one is desirous of deceiving, and that is where my warning to
  the youthful enthusiast comes in.</p>

  <p>The thing came too quickly for warning. Suddenly from above the
  inhabitants of the hole, with whom Angus was consuming a midday glass of
  port, was heard the voice: "It must be somewhere about here, sir, I think."
  The voice was right&mdash;it was.</p>

  <p>They came through in a phalanx of fire, and descended abruptly on the
  detachment below. It was a magnificent compliment to the work, but it was
  unfortunate that the General should have been the one to consume the nettles.
  However, I have always thought that Angus's voice of disgust as he
  contemplated the wreckage of his screen did not improve matters.</p>

  <p>"The door," he remarked, with painful distinctness, "is full of
  possibilities." With that he left.</p>

  <p>I trust the moral of my digression is obvious.... Having then, in a few
  well-chosen phrases, discussed one type of camouflage, I would pass on and
  lead the thirster for information still farther into the by-paths of
  knowledge. Just as there are many and divers types of deceit, varying from
  that which conceals what is, to that which exposes what is not&mdash;involved
  that last, but think it out&mdash;so are there many types of camouflage. And
  the particular one with which I am concerned, deals with a tree.</p>

  <p>On a certain slight eminence in what was otherwise a flat and dreary
  outlook, there stood the stump of a tree. It was a tired stump, strongly
  reminiscent of the morning after. It had had a hard life, and much of its
  pristine glory had faded. No longer did the sprightly sparrow chirrup
  cheerfully to its young from leafy branches; no longer did cattle recline in
  its shade during the heat of the day. It was just a stump&mdash;a stump
  complete with splinters.</p>

  <p>Its sole claim to notoriety lay in its position. It commanded a view of
  the German lines which was not to be had elsewhere; in fact, from the
  eminence on which it stood you could obtain the only good observation of the
  opposite trenches in that particular sector of the line.</p>

  <p>It was the Brigade Major who first suggested the idea in the fertile brain
  of the C.R.E. of the Division, who happened to be talking to him at the
  moment. They were in the support line trenches, and close to where they
  stood, the tree&mdash;gaunt, repulsive and toothpicky&mdash;raised its
  stunted head to heaven.</p>

  <p>"What a pity that tree ain't hollow!" ruminated the Staff officer
  thoughtfully. "Splendid view from it of the Huns. Can't do anything in that
  line, can you, Colonel?"</p>

  <p>The C.R.E. thoughtfully considered the proposition. "Afraid not, old boy,"
  he answered after a few moments' deliberation. "Bit of a job hollowing out a
  tree. All the same, you're quite right. It would make a great O.P."</p>

  <p>"Why not make another down in your yard, and put it up instead?" The
  Brigadier joined in the discussion. "We must have better observation in this
  sector if we possibly can."</p>

  <p>"Cut this one down one night and put up a dummy in its place." The C.R.E
  once again considered the wretched stump. "Not a bad idea, General; the only
  question is who is to do it. It will have to be a good model, or the Huns
  will spot the difference; and..." Suddenly his face cleared. "By Jove! I've
  got it&mdash;Bendigo Jones. He's the man for the job."</p>

  <p>"And who the deuce is Bendigo Jones?" asked the General, as the Sapper
  rapidly jotted down something in his note-book. "He sounds like a prize
  fighter or the inventor of a patent medicine."</p>

  <p>"Bendigo Jones, General, is my latest acquisition. I have it on no less an
  authority than his own that he is a very remarkable man. I gather that he is
  futurist by inclination, and dyspeptic by nature, which I take to be a more
  or less natural sequence of events. At present he adorns my office, and looks
  intense."</p>

  <p>"He sounds rather like a disease," murmured the Brigade Major. "From what
  you say, I gather he considers himself an artist."</p>

  <p>"He sculpts, or whatever a sculptor does when he gets busy." The Colonel
  smiled gently. "How he ever blew out here I cannot imagine, but these things
  will occur. I offended him mortally, I regret to say, the first day he
  arrived, by confessing that I had never even heard his name, much less seen
  his work, but I think he's forgiven me. I allowed him to arrange the timber
  yard today more aesthetically, and the Sergeant-major thinks he is soft in
  the head, so Bendigo is supremely happy."</p>

  <p>"He sounds a perfect treasure," remarked the Brigadier drily. "However, as
  long as he models that tree and we get it up somehow, and I never see him, I
  shall be quite happy, old boy."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done," answered the C.R.E., "by our little Bendy himself. A
  life-size, hollow camouflage stump shall replace the original, complete with
  peephole and seat."</p>

  <p>Thus lightly was settled the immediate future of one of the world's great
  ones. In view, however, of the fact that the world is so often lamentably
  ignorant of greatness, it now becomes necessary for me to carry out my second
  introduction and enlighten the Philistines as to what they have missed by
  their miserable and sordid materialism.</p>

  <p>Be it known then that for several years Bendigo Jones had been in the
  habit of inflicting upon a long-suffering and inoffensive public a series of
  lumps of material. What these lumps were supposed to represent no one has yet
  discovered; and I am given to understand that unless the proud perpetrator
  noted it himself on completion, he too was usually unable to elucidate the
  mystery. It was not of great account, as he ran not the slightest risk of
  contradiction whatever he said; and as no person ever willingly went twice to
  his exhibitions, he could vary the title daily without fear of discovery.
  Another great point about his work was its many-sidedness. A lump looked at
  from one side would perhaps represent "Pelican with young," while on the
  other "The Children's Hour, or six o'clock at Mud View Villa," would be
  depicted. This, needless to say, economised greatly in space and matter; and
  in case any special exhibit failed to arrive in time, or was thrown away by
  mistake, an old one turned upside down at once remedied the defect.</p>

  <p>His nearest approach to fame occurred during the period which followed the
  perpetration of his celebrated "Mother with her Child." It was announced that
  the gifted sculptor had worked on it for five years; and a certain amount of
  light was thrown on his methods by an interview he managed to get published
  in some obscure journal.</p>

  <p>"Rising with a hoarse cry," ran this effusion, "Mr. Bendigo Jones hurled
  himself at his work. With a single blow he removed a protuberance, and then
  sank back exhausted.</p>

  <p>"'You see the difference,' he cried, 'you see how I have altered her
  expression.'</p>

  <p>"'Whose?' I murmured dazedly.</p>

  <p>"'Why, the face of the woman. Ah! dolt, blockhead, have you no
  eyes&mdash;have you no soul?'</p>

  <p>"'But you told me that was a church at sunset,' I remonstrated feebly.</p>

  <p>"'What has that to do with it?' he shouted. 'It is what I like to make it,
  fool. What is a name? Nothing&mdash;a bagatelle. I have changed my mind every
  day for the last five years, and now my life's work is done&mdash; done.'</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bendigo Jones sobbed quietly, and I stole away. It was not for me to
  gaze on such grief. And as I went through the open window I heard his final
  whisper.</p>

  <p>"'It shall be none of these things. I will pander to vile utilitarianism.
  It shall be&mdash;"A City Magnate at Lunch."'"</p>

  <p>It may be remembered that when it was finally put on view in London,
  enormous interest was aroused by an enterprising weekly paper offering prizes
  to the extent of a thousand pounds to any one who could guess what it was;
  and though Bendigo Jones's pocket was helped considerably by his percentage
  of the gate money, his pride suffered considerably when the answers were made
  public. They ranged from, "Model of the first steam engine when out of
  control," to "An explosion of a ship at sea," both of which happy efforts
  gained a bag of nuts. The answer adjudged most nearly correct was sent in by
  a Fulham butcher, who banked on "Angry gentleman quarrelling with his
  landlord on quarter-day": which at any rate had the merit of making it
  human.</p>

  <p>But I have digressed enough; I will return to my sad story. How our friend
  ever did arrive in France is as much of a mystery to me as it was to the
  Colonel; presumably a ruthless government, having decided it required men,
  roped him in along with the other lesser lights. The fiat went forth, and so
  did Bendigo&mdash;mildly protesting: to adorn in the fullness of time the
  office of the C.R.E. of whom I have spoken. And he was sitting there
  exhausted by his labours in helping the Sergeant-major rearrange the timber
  yard aesthetically, when a message arrived that the Colonel wished to speak
  to him.</p>

  <p>"I understand, Jones, that you are a sculptor," remarked that officer
  genially, as our hero entered the office. "Now, can you model a tree?"</p>

  <p>Bendigo gazed dreamily out of the window. "A tree," he murmured at length.
  "A little, beautiful tree. Green with the verdant loveliness of youth...
  green... green."</p>

  <p>"It isn't," snapped the Colonel. "It's brown, and damned hideous, and full
  of splinters."</p>

  <p>"Only to the eye of unbelief, sir." The sculptor regarded him
  compassionately. "To us&mdash;to those who can see things as they ought to
  be&mdash;more, as they spiritually are... it is different."</p>

  <p>A door closed somewhat hastily, and the sounds from the next room seemed
  to indicate that the Adjutant's cough was again troubling him. The Colonel
  however remained calm.</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt, Jones," he remarked dispassionately, "that what you have
  just said has some meaning. It is even remotely possible that you know what
  it means yourself. I don't; and I do not propose to try. I propose, on the
  other hand, to descend to the sordid details of what I wish you to do. You
  will commence without delay." He leaned back in his chair, and proceeded to
  fill his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Up the line there is a tree stump standing on rising ground, which I wish
  you to copy. The model must be sufficiently good to deceive the Germans. It
  will be hollow, and of such a size as will accommodate an observer. The back
  will be hinged. When your model is made, the real tree stump will be removed
  one night and the sham one substituted. Do you follow me?"</p>

  <p>It is more than doubtful if he even heard. A slight attack of dyspepsia
  shook him as the Colonel finished speaking, and he passed his hands twice
  through his hair. "The thought&mdash;the future vista&mdash;is beautiful," he
  murmured. "And think; think of the advertisement. Tomorrow, sir, I will gaze
  upon it, and fashion it in clay. Then I will return and commence the great
  work."</p>

  <p>He faded slowly through the door; and after a long pause the Colonel
  spoke. "I wonder," he remarked thoughtfully to the Adjutant who had returned:
  "I wonder why such things are...."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I am given to understand that the arrival of Bendigo Jones
  at the scene of his labours the next morning caused such a sensation amongst
  those privileged to witness the spectacle that the entire trench was blocked
  for two hours. To only a chosen band was vouchsafed the actual sight of the
  genius at work; the remainder had to be content with absorbing his remarks as
  they were passed down the expectant line. And it was doubtless unfortunate
  that the Divisional General should have chosen the particular moment when the
  divine fire of genius was at its brightest to visit the support line in
  company with his G.S.O.I. and a galaxy of other bright and shining luminaries
  of the military world.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this extraordinary crush in the trench this
  morning?" he remarked irritably to his Staff officer, as the procession was
  again held up by a knot of interested men.</p>

  <p>"I really don't know, sir," murmured that worthy. "It's most unusual;
  it's..."</p>

  <p>His words were drowned by howls of delighted laughter from round the
  traverse in front, and the next moment a perspiring soldier forced his way
  into the bay where the great ones were temporarily wedged. It was the special
  runner who was carrying the latest gem from the lips of Bendigo&mdash;at work
  a little farther up&mdash;to the expectant and breathless audience.</p>

  <p>"Hay! little sandbag! Ho! little sandbag! 'Ow beautiful hart thou in
  textchah."</p>

  <p>"Go on, Bill. Did the perisher say that?" An incredulous member of the
  group looked doubtful.</p>

  <p>"Did 'e say it?" The carrier of news looked scornfully at the doubter.
  "Did 'e say it? Lumme! 'E said it twice, and then he buried 'is mug in its
  loverly fragrant surface, and pricked his nose on Ginger's bayonet. 'E's mad,
  boys; 'e's as mad as a plurry 'atter; 'e's got bats in 'is belfry."</p>

  <p>Now, in spite of what I know of Bendigo Jones, I must admit that this
  reputed remark taxes even my credulity. Mad he undoubtedly was when viewed by
  the sordid standards of the vandals around him, but this inspiring ode to a
  sandbag grew somewhat, I cannot but help thinking, in the transmission. The
  regrettable thing was that it should have reached this stage when it was
  unwittingly presented to the Divisional General.</p>

  <p>"Gangway!" he roared, as the hilarity remained unabated: "gangway!" He
  elbowed his way through the suddenly silent throng and confronted the special
  runner. "Now, my man, tell me&mdash;what is all this tommy rot about?"</p>

  <p>"Bloke farther up the trenches, sir, wot don't seem quite right in the
  'ead." Somewhat confused at the sudden appearance of the powers that be, the
  perspiring harbinger of bons mots relapsed into an uncomfortable and
  depressing silence.</p>

  <p>"Not right in the head," barked the General. "God bless my soul! It must
  be the heat. Dreadful. What shall we do, Curtis?" He appealed for support to
  his Staff officer.</p>

  <p>"I think, sir, the Doctor might precede us," answered the other
  resourcefully, "and see if the man is dangerous. If so, no doubt he will
  arrange for his removal before he does any harm."</p>

  <p>The A.D.M.S., or Assistant Director of Medical Services&mdash;the official
  title of the principal bolus booster in a Division&mdash;emerged with a
  sickly smile from behind a corner, and advanced unwillingly to the head of
  the procession.</p>

  <p>"Excellent idea," remarked the General affably. "You can prescribe for him
  when you see the symptoms, old boy. Probably a most interesting
  case&mdash;provided he doesn't stab you on sight."</p>

  <p>"Sit on his head, Doc., if he comes for you," remarked the Staff officer,
  gracefully handing over the position of leader, "and, above all, dear old
  thing, don't let him bite you. Give him a Number Nine to chew, and we'll bind
  him when he becomes unconscious."</p>

  <p>"It's all jolly fine for you to laugh," said the Doctor peevishly. "I'm
  fat and you're thin, and you can hide behind me."</p>

  <p>They reached the bay of the trench next to Bendigo, just as a further
  great utterance was starting on its way. In the excitement of the moment,
  caused by the General's sudden appearance, much of this gem was lost.</p>

  <p>What was heard, however, did not diminish the Doctor's alarm.</p>

  <p>"Howls in the leafy verdure," he remarked anxiously. "Good Heavens,
  General, he must be up the tree stump!"</p>

  <p>"That's all right, sir!" remarked a sergeant reassuringly. "'E's quite
  'armless. It's his spirit mind, 'e says. He thinks the tree is full of
  leaves."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but who is howling in it," asked the General irritably. "I
  don't hear a sound."</p>

  <p>"It's his spirit mind again, sir," answered the sergeant respectfully.
  "There ain't no one 'owling really; 'e means howls wot 'oot."</p>

  <p>The procession paused awhile to digest this momentous fact, and the Staff
  officer seized the opportunity to again comfort the Doctor.</p>

  <p>"Get him at once, old sport, before he becomes homicidal. You never know
  when the phase will change. He may fish in his tin hat with a bent pin first
  or he may shoot you on sight, but I'd go at once if I were you. You stand
  more chance."</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly the sight which confronted them on rounding the traverse
  justified their worst fears. The Doctor recoiled with a choking noise and
  endeavoured to wave the Staff officer forward.</p>

  <p>"Not on your life, Doc.," remarked that worthy grimly&mdash;"not on your
  life. Go right in; and with your bulk you oughtn't to feel it much, wherever
  he kicks you."</p>

  <p>Personally, I maintain the whole thing was rather hard on Bendigo. Before
  sending him up the line he should have been labelled; some warning as to his
  habits should have been noised abroad by the town crier. Then the unfortunate
  episode with the General would never have occurred. He would have made
  allowances, and withdrawn early for light refreshment.</p>

  <p>But when a man whose face is of the type peculiar&mdash;the sort that you
  give the baby to play with&mdash;practises the habits of fourteen years
  unsuccessful dyspeptic futurism in a support line trench on a hot day, the
  result is likely to be full of incident. True&mdash;the wretched Bendigo knew
  no better; but no more did the General. And life is made of these trifling
  misunderstandings....</p>

  <p>The entranced spectators stiffened to attention as the procession of great
  ones&mdash;partially hidden behind the Doctor&mdash;advanced with due
  military precautions. Even the phlegmatic and weary Sapper who was assisting
  the genius, with base utilitarian details, such as the size of the trap door
  at the back of the proposed model, showed signs of animation. Not so Bendigo.
  With an expression on his face suggestive of great internal pain, he remained
  seated on the fire-step muttering softly to himself and clasping to his bosom
  a large lump of what appeared to be mud.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he placed it on the step beside him and rose with an air of
  determination. The staff performed two or three nimble steps of the foxtrot
  variety to the rear, and as they did so Bendigo sprang to the assault. With a
  sweeping half-arm blow he struck the mud and the mud retaliated. While it
  lasted the action was brisk, but the issue was never in doubt. After two
  minutes in fighting, Bendigo withdrew exhausted, and most of the mud went
  with him. What was left looked tired.</p>

  <p>"A clear case of shell shock," muttered the Staff officer nervously in the
  Doctor's ear. "For Heaven's sake do something!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but what the deuce am I to do?" Perspiring freely the gallant
  officer advanced slowly in the direction of Bendigo, who suddenly perceived
  him.</p>

  <p>The sculptor smiled wearily and pointed a languid hand at the result of
  his labours. "A great work, my friend," he murmured. "One of my most
  wonderful studies."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," remarked the Doctor cautiously. "Don't you
  think&mdash;er&mdash;you'd better lie down?"</p>

  <p>"The leafy foliage; the wonderful green effect; the tree&mdash;as I see
  it. Fresh, fragrant, superb." Bendigo burbled on, heedless of his mundane
  surroundings.</p>

  <p>"What is the fool talkin' about?" howled the General, who was standing on
  tip toe trying to see what was happening.</p>

  <p>"Hush, sir, I beg of you!" The Doctor looked round nervously. "A most
  peculiar&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I won't hush," roared his irascible senior. "Why should I hush? Some
  idiot is standing on my feet; and I'm wedged in here like a sardine. Let me
  speak to him." The General forced his way forward. "Now, you&mdash;my man,
  what the devil are you doing? And what's that damned lump of mud on the fire-
  step?"</p>

  <p>"I am Bendigo Jones," returned the other dreamily. "Sculptah&mdash;
  artist&mdash;genius."</p>

  <p>"I didn't ask who you were," barked the now infuriated General. "I asked
  you what that thing that looks like an inebriated blancmange is meant to
  be."</p>

  <p>"That model?" Bendigo bent forward and gazed at it lovingly. "That is
  yonder tree as I see it. The base materialist with the foot rule will inform
  you of the mundane details."</p>

  <p>The Sapper alluded to scowled heavily at the unconscious Bendigo. Somewhat
  uncertain as to what a base materialist might be, he felt dimly that it was a
  term to be resented.</p>

  <p>"I was sent up 'ere, sir, with 'im to help 'im make a model of that there
  stump," he remarked morosely. "That's the fifteenth mess 'e's made this
  morning; and 'e's carried on 'orrible over the 'ole lot. If I might say so,
  sir, 'e don't seem quite right in his 'ead."</p>

  <p>"I am inclined to agree with you," answered the General grimly. "He must
  be swept up and..."</p>

  <p>Exactly what fate was in store for Bendigo will never be known. One of
  those visitations of fate which occur periodically in the trenches
  interrupted the General's words, and ended the situation in more ways than
  one.</p>

  <p>"Look out, sir," cried a sergeant, with a sudden shout. "Rum jar
  coming."</p>

  <p>It came: wobbling, turning, and twisting, the little black object
  descended from the skies towards them, and the crouching occupants of the
  trench heard it hit the ground a few yards away. Then it burst with a
  deafening roar: a roar which was followed by an ominous creaking.</p>

  <p>It was the phlegmatic Sapper&mdash;the base materialist&mdash;who broke
  the news first.</p>

  <p>With an expression of great relief on his face he gazed over the top of
  the trench. "Thank 'Eavens! you can't make a sixteenth, mate. The whole
  plurry tree's nah poo."</p>

  <p>"Nah poo," murmured Bendigo Jones. "Nah poo. What is nah poo?" He stood up
  and peered over the top also. "I see no change. To some eyes it might seem
  that the tree had fallen; to mine it lives for ever&mdash;fragrant and cool."
  He descended and trod heavily on the General's toe. "To you, sir, as a man of
  understanding, I give my morning's labours. I have rechristened it. It
  symbolises 'Children at play in Epping Forest.'"</p>

  <p>Magnificently he thrust the lump of disintegrating dirt into the arms of
  his outraged superior. "It is yours, sir; I, Bendigo Jones, have given you my
  masterpiece."</p>

  <p>Then he departed.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The only man who really suffered was the base materialist.
  Two hours later he rolled up for his dinner, in a mood even more
  uncommunicative than usual.</p>

  <p>"'Ullo, Nobby," remarked the cook affably, "you don't seem yer usual
  chatty self this morning. An' wot 'ave you got on your neck?"</p>

  <p>"Less of it," returned the other morosely. "It's Hepping Forest. And
  that"&mdash;he plucked a fragment from his hair&mdash;"that is the bally
  twins playin' ''Unt the slipper.'"</p>

  <p>Even the cook was stirred out of his usual air of superiority by this
  assertion, and contemplated the speaker with interest. "You don't say." He
  inspected the phenomenon more closely. "I thought as 'ow it was mud."</p>

  <p>"It is." Nobby was even more morose. "It belonged to that 'orror Bendigo
  Jones, and 'e went and give it to the General." The speaker swallowed once or
  twice. "Then the General, 'e gives it back, in a manner of speaking. Only
  Bendy had gone by the time it come, and&mdash;I 'adn't. Lumme! wot a
  life."</p>
