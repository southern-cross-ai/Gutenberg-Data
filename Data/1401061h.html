<h3>GRATEFULLY DEDICATED TO<br>
THE READERS OF "MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION"</h3>

<h2>PUBLISHERS' PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION</h2>

<p class="first">IN 1929 appeared the First Edition of a book
with the odd title, <i>Magnificent Obsession</i>. Two well-known
general publishing houses had declined the book&mdash;one because
it was too much of a story and not sufficiently a religious book,
and the other because it was too much a religious book and not
sufficiently a story&mdash;and both on the ground that it was not
likely to justify the expense of publication. The author had then
offered the manuscript to a house that made a specialty of
publishing in the religious field. There it was accepted and
published. The first printing was one of three thousand copies;
the second, one of fifteen hundred.</p>

<p>It is interesting to know that when the book was first offered
to the trade it was sold as a religious work. Dealers placed it
among the sermons and ethical essays. It was fully six months
later before booksellers began to consider it as a novel.</p>

<p>Novels that appear in the Best Seller List usually achieve
their popularity and their ratings immediately. If they are to
become "Best Sellers," they give evidence of it within thirty
days after publication. <i>Magnificent Obsession</i> did not
reach the Best Seller List until a year after it was published;
but having arrived there, it remained on the list for eighteen
months. Modestly advertised in religious journals, its popularity
came chiefly from the word-of-mouth publicity that it received.
In this publicity the interest of several eminent clergymen in
various parts of the country was strikingly effective. Those men
lent their influence to the book, reviewing it before their
congregations and church conventions.</p>

<p>After the book had been out for a year the jacket was altered
slightly by the addition of this sentence: "It has frequently
been said of this strange story that the people who read it are
never quite the same again."</p>

<p>The book evoked an amazing flood of letters from its readers.
These letters came from every state in the Union, every province
in Canada, and from Great Britain. Reading clubs in Germany
studied it. London preachers reviewed it in their pulpits. It has
been translated into many languages. It has been on the air and
on the motion-picture screen. By a highly conservative estimate
two million persons have read <i>Magnificent Obsession</i>.</p>

<p>Among the queries presented in those letters, several
constantly recurred. One almost always found was this: "Is the
complete Journal of Doctor Hudson available?"</p>

<p>For several years it has been Mr. Douglas's intention to
answer that question in the affirmative.</p>

<p><i>Doctor Hudson's Secret Journal</i> is not a sequel to
<i>Magnificent Obsession</i>. It is rather an expansion of the
philosophy that made <i>Magnificent Obsession</i> important,
illumined by other experiences of Doctor Hudson's than those
recorded in the novel.</p>

<p>The persons who found inspiration in <i>Magnificent
Obsession</i> will, we believe, feel a deep satisfaction in
seeing the tenth anniversary of that extraordinary book
celebrated by the publication of <i>Doctor Hudson's Secret
Journal</i>.</p>
  <hr>

<h2>AUTHOR'S FOREWORD</h2>

<p class="first">SHORTLY after the quiet appearance of
<i>Magnificent Obsession</i>, eleven years ago, the author became
aware that he had not completed his task.</p>

<p>The letters which began to pour in were not of the sort
usually referred to as "fan mail." Nobody wanted an autograph, a
photograph, or a lock of hair. Not many bothered to remark that
they had been entertained by the story. But they all asked
questions and most of the questions were serious, wistful, and
challenging.</p>

<p>The theme of the novel had derived from a little handful of
verses midway of the Sermon on the Mount, but all references to
the enchanted passage were purposely vague, the author feeling
that a treasure hunt in Holy Writ would probably do his customers
no harm. Within the first twelve months after publication, more
than two thousand people had written to inquire, "What page of
the Bible did the sculptor carry in his wallet?" We left off
counting these queries, but they have continued to come, all
through these intervening years.</p>

<p>Second in importance to this inquiry was a very searching
question, phrased in terms ranging all the way from polite
hinting to forthright impudence: "Do you honestly believe in this
thing&mdash;or were you just writing a story?" After a while,
letters began to arrive from persons who said they had tried it,
and it worked; though they were careful not to be too specific in
reporting their adventures, aware that if they told they would be
sorry. A few lamented the cost of unrewarded experiments and
denounced the whole idea as a lot of hooey.</p>

<p>The task of dealing sympathetically with this strange
correspondence became a grave responsibility. No stock letter,
done on a mimeograph, would serve the purpose. It was necessary
that individual replies be sent to all earnest inquirers. One
dared not risk the accusation that, having advocated an expensive
and venturesome technique for generating personal power, the
author was thereafter too busy or lazy to care whether anybody
benefited by such investments. It was interesting to observe how
wide a variety of people came forward with questions. A single
post might contain inquiries from a high school boy, a college
professor, a farmer's wife, a physician, a pious old lady, an
actress, a postman, a preacher, and a sailor. Some of the
questions were practically unanswerable, but it wasn't quite fair
to limit one's reply to a laconic "I don't know." Frequently
one's counsel was pitiably inadequate, but not because it was
coolly casual or thoughtlessly composed. I suppose that if all of
these letters were compiled and printed they would fill several
volumes as large as the novel which evoked them.</p>

<p>A third question, which began to show up promptly, inquired,
"Is the complete text of Doctor Hudson's journal available in
print?" The correct answer to that was "No." It not only wasn't
in print; it had not been written. Occasionally someone would
counter, "How were you able to quote from Doctor Hudson's
journal, if there never was any such thing?"&mdash;an amusingly
artless question, to be sure; but an obviously honest tribute to
the realism of a document which had no existence in fact.</p>

<p>Readers of <i>Magnificent Obsession</i> will recall that,
early in the story, an eminent brain surgeon. Doctor Wayne
Hudson, lost his life by drowning. Among his effects there was
found a journal containing some amazing memoirs. Because of the
singular nature of these experiences. Doctor Hudson had concealed
his story in a baffling code, hoping by this means to insure it
against a hasty perusal by persons who might view it with
careless indifference or a half-contemptuous incredulity.</p>

<p>Throughout the novel, "quotations" from and adversions to this
laboriously decoded journal provided the explanation of young
Merrick's belief and behaviour as he endeavoured to follow in his
mentor's footsteps. And perhaps it is not an unreasonable request
if the people who have found a measure of inspiration in those
brief and detached fragments from the Hudson journal should want
to see the whole of it.</p>

<p>This book is related to <i>Magnificent Obsession</i> as an
overture rather than a sequel. Therefore it may be read without
any bewilderment by persons unacquainted with the novel.</p>

<p>But it is only natural if, during the belated composition of
this journal, the author should have visualized an audience
largely composed of those to whom Doctor Hudson is no stranger. I
find myself surveying this audience&mdash;however widely
scattered over the earth&mdash;as an assembly of people friendly
to one another&mdash;and to me. I feel that we are somehow
related in a common cause, a common quest. In this audience there
are many hundreds of gracious souls to whom I am indebted for
confidences and comradeships which have enriched my life and
emphasized for me the significance of spiritual forces.</p>

<p>I am particularly hopeful that this book may be approved by my
friends of the clergy who were primarily responsible for the wide
distribution of the novel. Too frequently one hears discrediting
criticism of the ministers on the ground that they are too much
occupied with the material success of their own denominations;
that they are inhospitable to new evaluations of enduring
verities; that they are more concerned with "churchianity" than
Christianity. This indictment is, for the most part, unfair.</p>

<p>In <i>Magnificent Obsession</i> there was no talk about the
importance of attending religious services or supporting
religious institutions in any manner whatsoever. Nobody in the
book ever put his nose inside a church, except on one occasion
when Bobby Merrick went to hear his friend. Doctor McLaren, by
special and urgent invitation.</p>

<p>This attitude was not intended to convey a feeling of
disregard for religious organizations on the part of the author.
The Church was conspicuously and wilfully omitted from the story
for the reason that in almost all of the "religious" novels the
Church serves as the axis on which the plot spins. It was my hope
to interest not only the people who rely upon the Church for
their moral and spiritual instruction but to suggest a way of
life to many others&mdash;seldom approached in this
manner&mdash;who have never looked to the Church for answers to
their riddles.</p>

<p>It was with some trepidation that the author adopted this
course, for he had spent most of his life in the service of the
Church; his closest friends were church people; he hoped they
would take no offence; he wondered if they would understand. And
they understood.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that <i>Magnificent Obsession</i> had
almost nothing to do with the Church, plus the fact that most of
the people in the novel were distinctly worldly, and some were
addicted to debatable habits, and a few were shockingly profane,
it was the clergy of America and the British Empire who carried
that novel to success. They may have wished that it contained
fewer cuss-words and cocktails, but they had the sportsmanship to
overlook the frailties it admitted and approve the faith it
upheld. It was well worth the bother of writing a
novel&mdash;just to find that out.</p>

<h2>BRIGHTWOOD HOSPITAL, DETROIT, MICHIGAN<br>
<i>October sixth,
1913, 11 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">THIS has been an eventful day. We formally
opened our new hospital this afternoon. The city's medical
profession was ably represented and many of our well-to-do
philanthropists came for tea and a tour of inspection.</p>

<p>Everybody commented on our astounding luck in disposing of the
shabby old building in Cadillac Square for a quarter of a
million. Lucky, they said, that our site had been chosen for the
new skyscraping office building. And what a lucky dog I was,
added the mayor, that this exquisitely landscaped four-acre tract
came onto the market just as we had begun to look for a new
location.</p>

<p>I nodded an appreciative assent to all of these pleasant
comments on my good luck, but felt rather traitorous; for it
wasn't luck. Nothing that has happened to me since June of 1905
could be properly called luck. I am in the grip of something that
I don't understand; but, whatever it is, there's nothing
capricious about it.</p>

<p>But if I had blurted out some such remark to the mayor or good
old Mrs. Arlington, or Nick Merrick, there would have been a lot
of explaining to do (or dodge) so I cheerfully agreed with them
that I was lucky. Had I told them the whole story about our
acquirement of the new hospital, they would have thought me stark
mad.</p>

<p>Billy Werner called up from New York, about four, to offer
congratulations and regret he could not be here. He said, "We're
square now, Doc, except for the interest on that loan." And I
said, "Don't ever try to pay that back, Billy. It might upset the
apple-cart."</p>

<p>Frequently, during these past few years, I have fairly burned
with desire to confide in someone. The weight of my secrets has
been almost crushing at times. But I have this load to carry
alone as long as I live. The strange events which have come to
pass through my private investments do not permit of an airing:
their good results might be jeopardized. I know a few other
people whom I suspect of bearing the same sort of burden, but we
can't discuss it. I often wonder if it is not more difficult to
suppress a great exaltation than to conceal a secret sorrow.</p>

<p>An hour ago, Nancy Ashford paused at my office door to say
good night. She was drooping a little with fatigue from the day's
unusual excitements.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, wearily, "you have put over a great
project."</p>

<p>I wanted to invite her in and tell her how we got this new
hospital. It wouldn't have taken very long. She knows the
beginning of the story. I needed only to say, "Nancy, do you
remember the woman we had with us for six months, the one with
the broken neck?"</p>

<p>And Nancy would have replied, "Of course&mdash;Mrs.
Werner&mdash;and her husband was sore about the bills."</p>

<p>I would have gone on from there. Mrs. Werner had had the best
room in the hospital and a deal of extra attention, much of which
was unnecessary but expensive. Everybody assumed that the Werners
were wealthy. He had a big store downtown, and they lived in a
beautiful home. There was a rumour that they were extravagant.
She was always travelling about, and he was reputed a
gambler.</p>

<p>It wasn't my job to supervise hospital statements, but
Werner's must have been pretty high. When he was billed for the
surgery, the amount was not excessive, but it was in the same
general bracket with the other expenses of his wife's illness. I
was not informed, until some time afterwards, that when he paid
the bill he made quite a scene, protesting that he had been
overcharged.</p>

<p>About that time there was a story afloat about town that
Werner was in serious straits financially. He had offended the
president of his bank and had been unreasonably cocky with almost
everybody else. He had no one to turn to in his emergency.
Perhaps his irascibility, in his dealings with us, was all of a
piece with his other blunders. But&mdash;once upon a time he had
been able to build up a fine business. Something had happened to
him. He needed to be rehabilitated.</p>

<p>One morning, in <i>The Free Press</i>, I noticed a conspicuous
advertisement of Werner's home for sale at a cruel sacrifice. On
impulse, I went down to his office immediately. He was reluctant
to see me and greeted me with a glum grunt and a surly scowl. I
told him I had come to lend him twenty thousand&mdash;the amount
he had asked for his house. He could put that into his business,
and perhaps save his home. He was suspicious, and wanted to know
what rate of interest I expected. I said I didn't want any
interest because I intended to use it for another purpose. He
asked me if I was feeling well, and brought me a drink of
water.</p>

<p>Of course, that small loan wouldn't have been a drop in his
dry bucket, considered as mere dollars and cents. But the fact
that I had volunteered to let him have it when he was all but on
the rocks, and it seemed like pouring so much money into a
rat-hole&mdash;and he knew that I knew it&mdash;had the effect of
a shot of strychnine.</p>

<p>He paced up and down the room, for a minute or two, and then
snapped out, "Thanks, Doc. You'll not regret it."</p>

<p>"Not if you keep it a secret," I replied. "This must not be
told."</p>

<p>I made no effort to keep track of his activities but it was
evident that Werner had gone at it again with tremendous energy.
Perhaps he plunged recklessly. I do not know the details of that
story. But soon he was enlarging his store and in command of his
mercantile field. Three years after that, he organized the
company that put up the new office building. Because he had
conceived the project, his board of directors deferred to his
judgment in many matters including the selection of a site. He
urged the purchase of our old hospital.</p>

<p>So&mdash;that's the way we got the new hospital. But I
couldn't recite any of this even to Nancy, who would have been
stirred and mystified by the story. I can hear the way she would
have murmured, "Well&mdash;of all things!"</p>

<p>I did not detain her. I simply smiled, nodded, and told her to
go to bed; that she had earned a good night's rest. A remarkable
woman. Sometimes I wonder how much she knows about my odd
investments. She has witnessed my signature, occasionally, on
papers that must have excited her curiosity. Perhaps she thinks I
am living a double life. I should like to set her mind at ease
about that. But it is impossible. My lips are sealed. She will
have to draw her own conclusions.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">I suppose I should be content with the rewards
of my dynamic discovery, even if not permitted to disclose it to
others. It has brought me innumerable satisfactions; an excellent
rating in a difficult field of surgery, a position of influence
in civic affairs, a comfortable home, and&mdash;above
all&mdash;the enduring gratitude of a large number of persons
whose lives have been reconditioned through these
investments.</p>

<p>But it is a lonesome sensation, sometimes, to feel that one is
in league with a catalytic force as versatile as electricity,
prompt as dynamite, stirring as a symphony, warm as a
handclasp&mdash;but available only on condition that one does not
tell. To confide what one has done to achieve this peculiar power
might be very costly, not only to oneself but to others whose
welfare is integrally related to one's own success.</p>

<p>Not to confide it, especially to one's close and trusted
friends, seems unconscionably selfish; yet there is no
way&mdash;so far as I know&mdash;for confiding the theory unless
one divulges the practice, which would necessitate a narrative of
specific events.</p>

<p>But for a long time I have had it in mind to record at least a
few of these facts for the guidance and encouragement of someone
who might wish to experiment with this thing after I am gone. To
record some of these events in a private journal and deposit the
book in my safe would seem entirely feasible, except for the risk
that the book might fall into the hands of some person who would
read it without imagination or the slightest glimmer of
sympathetic understanding. Hence my decision to write the book in
cipher. I do not think that anyone will go through the drudgery
of decoding it unless he is interested in the contents. Whenever
he finds that the job isn't worth the bother, the reader can
quit. And the sooner he quits, the safer the secret.</p>

<p>I would give a good deal to know&mdash;at this
writing&mdash;what sort of person will have the time, patience,
and disposition to translate this book. I hope he will not be in
too much of a hurry to learn the secret. I intend to approach the
matter with a deliberation that may exasperate my reader. But if
he isn't concerned enough to persevere, he probably would not
know how to use the secret even if he discovered it.</p>

<p>If you have got this far, my friend, perhaps you will have
decided that I am crazy. This will be incorrect. I have contrived
to lay hold upon a principle that has expanded my life and
multiplied my normal energies. I have a consuming curiosity to
know more about this thing; and if you are still engaged in
deciphering this book you share this curiosity. If I am crazy for
writing it, you are equally crazy for reading it. I warn you that
if you go much farther, it will get you, as it got me. But I am
not crazy.</p>

<p>Eventually the time may come, though I shall not live to see
it, when mental aberrations are regarded with the same sympathy
now bestowed upon physical disabilities. As the matter stands at
present, while it is no disgrace to have an ailment of the heart,
you are viewed with aversion if there is anything wrong with your
head. I understand this feeling; and, to a considerable extent,
share it myself.</p>

<p>Of course, when I am dealing professionally with a brain
tumour, my patient's mental disorder does not offend or annoy me,
for I have a scientific interest in his dementia as an inevitable
concomitant to the pressure on his brain. Indeed, the phenomena
of his lunacy sometimes aid me in defining the field of the
pressure.</p>

<p>But&mdash;professional curiosity aside&mdash;I am very
uncomfortable in the society of people whose minds are upset. I
dislike hysterics. I have a strong distaste for exhibitionism in
any of its manifestations. I have no use for the mentality that
hankers to be unique. I have no patience at all with eccentrics
who go chasing about after ridiculous isms and fantastic ologies.
I like normal people and I should like to be considered normal
myself.</p>

<p>When a man tells me that his Aunt Alicia roused suddenly in
the middle of the night, dressed, packed a bag, and took a train,
at the behest of some esoteric hunch that her bankrupt nephew was
on the brink of a tragedy, and arrived at the nick of time to
talk him out of his revolver and into a new resolution, I
instinctively add this fellow's name to the list of those with
whom I shall not be going on a canoe-trip around the world.</p>

<p>I try to avoid the balmy, the monomaniacs, the religious
fanatics, the obsessed, except in my hospital where it is my
business to see them. I would walk a mile to escape a
conversation with somebody who had gone in for spiritualism,
astrology, yogism, or an expectation of the return of Christ by a
week from Tuesday. I take no stock in magic. Belief in the
supernatural comes hard with me. I automatically shy off at
reports of miracles, both classic and contemporary.</p>

<p>And the reason I am so tiresomely insistent upon the orderly
and conservative nature of my own mind, and my distaste for
persons with odd kinks, quirks, maggots, crotchets,
hallucinations, and various benign psychoses, is that I want the
reader of this journal to believe that I am as sane as anybody he
knows. I insist on this, at the outset, my friend, for I shall be
documenting some very strange events.</p>

<p>It is broad daylight now, and we are both weary. I have to be
in the operating chamber at ten, and I assume that you, too, have
something important to do. It is unlikely that an idle person
would have access to this book.</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>October tenth, 1913, 9.30 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">IT all began on a fine June morning in 1905.
Nothing has been the same since. Life took on a new meaning, that
day.</p>

<p>It was the first anniversary of my wife's death. I had found
it hard to reconcile myself to that loss, and the recurrence of
the date revived in sharp detail the whole pitiful story of
Joyce's unwilling departure and my unspeakable desolation.</p>

<p>For some time it had been in my mind to order a suitable
marker for her grave. I had been tardy about it, hoping that my
financial circumstances might improve. But there was no sign of
such improvement. My affairs were growing more dismaying.</p>

<p>Restless and lonely, I resolved to visit some concern dealing
in memorial stones and see whether I could afford to honour my
dear girl's grave with a little monument. It was while engaged in
this errand that I came by the secret of personal power.</p>

<p>Joyce and I had been very companionable. Not only were we
naturally congenial, but her long illness had bound us together
in a tender intimacy hardly to be achieved under any other
circumstance. During the last year of her life, which we spent in
Tucson, I made no attempt to do anything but keep her comfortable
and amused. I tried to stand between her and all the little jars
and irks and shocks. When the baby cried, I promptly found out
what she wanted and got it for her. I have been doing that ever
since, and if she isn't a spoiled child she has every right to
be.</p>

<p>I loved my wife no more for her devotion to me than my own
sympathy for her. I think we love best those whom we serve most
zealously. It is an ennobling experience to love anyone in need
of tender ministries. The time comes when nothing else matters
much but the happiness of one's beloved.</p>

<p>There are plenty of afflictions more difficult to deal with
than pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient is usually hopeful,
cheerful, wistful. As physical vitality ebbs, the psychical
forces flow with the strength and speed of a harvest tide.</p>

<p>If it ever becomes your destiny to entertain an invalid over
any considerable length of time, it will be to your advantage if
the patient's disability has not struck him below the belt. Your
heart and lung people are optimists.</p>

<p>Of course I couldn't help knowing that Joyce was doomed. Had
she been only one-tenth as sweet and patient, my sense of
obligation to her would have kept me by her side. But I sincerely
enjoyed that final year with her. We read innumerable books,
lounged in the sun, swam in the pool, played together like
children; and all this at a period of my career when&mdash;under
normal conditions&mdash;I should have been working eighteen hours
of every twenty-four to get a start in my profession.</p>

<p>Once in a while I would be swept by a surge of dismay over my
inability to do anything at all when it was so obvious that I
should have been going forward with my vocation. But these
misgivings gripped me less frequently and more feebly as the days
passed. The sunshine was genial, the air was sedative, my excuse
for indolence was valid. I almost forgot I wanted to be a
doctor.</p>

<p>Even now, after more than nine years, I cannot bring myself to
the point of relating the events of Joyce's last hours, the sad
and all but interminable journey home, the funeral,
and&mdash;afterwards&mdash;the enervating depression; the feeling
that life was barely worth the bother; the almost sickening
aversion to the thought of resuming the old routine in the
clinic.</p>

<p>The people at the hospital were very kind and forbearing. I
must have been a dreadful nuisance. It should have been easy
enough to see that my heart wasn't in it. But they seemed to
understand; Doctor Pyle, especially. Pyle had always been a bit
crusty, and I hadn't known him very well. They used to say of
Pyle that if you could let him do all the abdominal surgery with
the understanding that the patient would never see him again, he
might become popular. Next morning after removing a kidney or a
gall-bladder, Pyle would call on his uncomfortable victim and
offer him some such amenity as, "What in hell are you making so
much racket about? Lots of people in this hospital with more pain
than you have."</p>

<p>But it was good old Pyle that helped
me&mdash;roughly&mdash;back into the harness. I still hated it,
and it galled me, but I wore it. Pyle fitted it on me again,
muttering many a what-in-hell, but apparently bent on making
something of me&mdash;a very unpromising project. One day I told
him I believed I had better give it all up and go into
business.</p>

<p>"What kind of business?" he growled. "If you went out as grim
and glum and licked as you look to-day, you couldn't sell silver
dollars for a nickel apiece. You stick to your job, young
fellow."</p>

<p>So&mdash;I stuck to the job; but I didn't like it.</p>

<p>It was in that state of mind that I went to look for the
little tombstone. I told the manager it would have to be
something inexpensive. He was quite obliging, treated me as
considerately as he might if I had come to spend a thousand
dollars. We agreed upon a small block of granite at what I
thought was a merciful price. Then he asked me what I wanted
engraved on the stone. I wrote Joyce's name and the dates.</p>

<p>"Would you like a brief epitaph?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Is it necessary?" I wondered.</p>

<p>"It is customary," he replied.</p>

<p>I told him I had nothing in mind, and he suggested that I go
out into the production room where many monuments were in
process. Perhaps I might see something suitable. It was a good
idea.</p>

<p>He opened the door and considerately left me to explore on my
own. Several stone-cutters glanced up and nodded as I paused to
watch their work. I wasn't very much impressed by the various
texts they were carving. None of them sounded much like anything
Joyce would have been likely to quote.</p>

<p>Presently I came to the half-open door of a large studio where
a man was at work on an amazingly beautiful piece of statuary.
High above me on the catwalk of the scaffolding, and intent upon
his occupation, the man did not notice me standing there until I
had time to survey his creation deliberately. This fellow was not
a mere stonecutter; he was a sculptor, and an uncommonly good
one, I surmised.</p>

<p>The piece he was working on seemed to be nearing completion.
It was a triumphant angelic figure, heroic size, gracefully
poised on a marble pedestal, altar-shaped; an exquisitely
modelled hand shading the eyes which gazed into the far horizon,
entranced by some distant radiance. It occurred to me that no man
could have invested those eyes with such an expression of
serenity and certitude unless he himself was convinced, beyond
all doubt, that something was to be seen Out There. The statue
was august in its simplicity. It had all the combined delicacy
and strength of a Canova. On the face of the altar-shaped
pedestal there was engraved, in gothic lettering and in high
relief, a text which was not decipherable from where I stood. My
movement for a better view caught the sculptor's attention. He
must have seen that I was impressed.</p>

<p>"Come in," he said, cordially. "My name is Randolph. Anything
I can do for you?"</p>

<p>"My name is Hudson. I have been looking about for a suitable
epitaph to have engraved on a tombstone."</p>

<p>Randolph leaned over and pointed down with the handle of his
mallet.</p>

<p>"How do you like this one?" he asked.</p>

<p>The inscription read, "Thanks Be to God Who Giveth Us the
Victory."</p>

<p>"Means nothing to me!" I remarked, rather testily, I fear. "If
there is a God, He probably has no more interest in any man's
so-called victory, which can always be circumstantially
explained, than in the victory of a cabbage that does well in a
favourable soil."</p>

<p>"Then you're related to God same as a cabbage," chuckled
Randolph. "That's good." He resumed his work, deftly tapping his
chisel. "I used to think that," he went on, talking half to
himself. "Made a little experiment, and changed my mind about
it." He put down the mallet, leaned far forward; and, cupping his
mouth with both hands, confided, in a mysterious tone, "<i>I've
been on the line!</i>"</p>

<p>He did not have the tone or stance of a fanatic; spoke
quietly; had none of the usual tricks by which aberrations are
readily identified; talked well, with absolute self-containment.
"Victory? Well&mdash;rather! I now have everything I want and can
do anything I wish! So can you! So can anybody! All you have to
do is follow the rules! There's a formula, you know. I came upon
it by accident!" He took up his chisel again.</p>

<p>He was a queer one. I felt shy and embarrassed. Clearly, he
was cracked, but his manner denied it. I tried to remember that
he was an artist, with permission to be eccentric; but this was
more than an eccentricity. He made me shivery. I wanted away.
So&mdash;I was backing through his doorway when he called,
"Doctor&mdash;do you have victory?"</p>

<p>"Victory over what?" I demanded, impatiently. I had not told
him I was discouraged; hadn't mentioned I was a doctor... I never
did find out how he guessed that&mdash;the question being
eclipsed by more important mysteries.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;over anything&mdash;everything! Listen!" He climbed
swiftly down from his scaffolding, and gliding stealthily toward
me as if he had some great secret to impart he whispered into my
ear&mdash;his hand firmly gripping my coat-lapel, somewhat to my
own anxiety&mdash;"Would you like to be the best doctor in this
town?"</p>

<p>So&mdash;then I knew he was crazy, and I began tugging myself
loose.</p>

<p>"Come to my house, to-night, about nine o'clock," he said,
handing me his card, "and I'll tell you what you want to
know!"</p>

<p>I must have looked dazed, for he laughed hilariously, as he
climbed up again. I laughed too as I reached the street&mdash;the
epitaph matter having completely left my mind for the time. I had
never heard so much nonsense in my life. "Like hell," I growled,
as I started my car, "will I waste an evening with that
fool!"</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>October nineteenth, 1913, 8.30 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">AT nine o'clock I was at Randolph's door... When
these words are read I shall be unable to answer any queries as
to my motive in going there that night. And that will be
fortunate; for I have no explanation further than to say (and
this will unquestionably be regarded with distrust and
disappointment) that I was propelled there against my wishes. I
had no thought of going; went in response to some urge over which
I had no control... I was downtown to dinner, that evening;
returned home at eight; went immediately to bed&mdash;quite
contrary to my custom, for I never retired before
midnight&mdash;and began reading a book, unable to concentrate on
a line of it. I could not keep my eyes off the clock. It ticked
louder and louder and my heart beat faster and faster until the
two of them seemed synchronized. At length, becoming so nervous I
could no longer contain myself, I rose, dressed hastily, dashed
out for my car, and drove to Randolph's address without regard to
boulevard stops or angry traffic officers. My mouth was dry, my
heart thumping.</p>

<p>"You had not intended to come, had you?" inquired Randolph,
taking my hat.</p>

<p>"No!" I replied, sourly.</p>

<p>"That's what I feared," he said, gently, "but I felt so sure
you needed to have a talk with me that I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is what I want to know!" I demanded. "<i>What did you
do?</i>"</p>

<p>He grinned slyly, rubbed his hands together softly,
satisfiedly, and said, "Well&mdash;I earnestly wanted you here;
and, as I told you, this morning, whatever I earnestly
want&mdash;<i>it comes! I wanted you here! You came!</i>"</p>

<p>He motioned me to a seat&mdash;I was glad enough to accept it
for my knees were wobbly&mdash;in a living-room furnished in
exquisite taste. His daughter, whom he had gracefully presented,
promptly excused herself, and left us alone. Offering me a cigar,
he leisurely filled a long-stemmed churchwarden pipe for himself,
and drew his chair closer. In his velvet jacket, at his ease, he
was all artist; quite grizzled, wore a short Van Dyke beard; had
a clear, clean, gray eye that came at you a bit shyly and
tentatively, but left you no way of escape.</p>

<p>He lost no time in preliminary manoeuvres. Reaching to a small
book-table, at his elbow, he took up a limp-leather Bible. I knew
then that I was in for it. Impetuously, I resolved upon an
immediate, if inglorious exit. Savagely, I put up a protesting
hand and said firmly, "Now&mdash;if it's that, I don't care to
hear about it!"</p>

<p>To my surprise, he put the book back on the table, and calmly
puffed at his pipe, thoughtfully, for a while; then replied,
"Well&mdash;neither do I&mdash;except as it's really an important
history of a great religious system. Quite useful, I presume; but
I'm not specially interested in it&mdash;except one page&mdash;"
He blew a few smoke rings, his head tilted far back against his
tall chair, "&mdash;And I have cut that page out... I just wanted
you to see this particular copy of the Bible. I was about to
say&mdash;when you plunged in with your impatient
remark&mdash;that this copy of the Bible lacks the secret formula
for power. I keep that one page elsewhere!"</p>

<p>"What's on it?" I inquired, annoyed at my own confession of
interest.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;" he replied casually, "it's just the rules for
getting whatever you want, and doing whatever you wish to do, and
being whatever you would like to be. But&mdash;you're not
interested in that; so we'll talk about something else."</p>

<p>"What is on that page?" I demanded&mdash;my voice sounding
rather shrill.</p>

<p>"Do you really want to know?" he challenged, leaning forward
and fixing me intently with his gaze.</p>

<p>"Yes!" I barked.</p>

<p>His next words came slowly, incisively, single-file.</p>

<p>"<i>More - than - you - have - ever - wanted - to - know -
anything - before?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes!" I admitted&mdash;and meant it.</p>

<p>"Say it!" he commanded.</p>

<p>I repeated it: "<i>More - than - I - have - ever - wanted - to
- know -anything - before!</i>"</p>

<p>His manner changed instantly.</p>

<p>"Good! Now we can talk!"</p>

<p>He went down into an inside pocket and produced a morocco
wallet. From the wallet, he extracted a folded page. I did not
leave Randolph's house until four o'clock, and when I finally
went out into the dark, considerably shaken, I was aware that my
life would never be the same again. Whatever of success has come
to me in my profession dates from that hour and can be explained
in terms of the mysterious potentiality which Randolph
communicated to me that night. I had reached out my hand greedily
for the page Randolph unfolded, but he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not just yet," he said, smiling at my eagerness. "I mean to
let you see it; but I must tell you something about it, first.
This page contains the rules for generating that mysterious power
I mentioned. By following these instructions to the letter, you
can have anything you want, do anything you wish to do, be
whatever you would like to be. I have tried it. It works. It
worked for me. It will work for you!"</p>

<p>Combined impatience and incredulity brought a chuckle from me
which he did not resent.</p>

<p>"You saw that piece I was working on when you came in this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" I exclaimed&mdash;sincerely.</p>

<p>"You liked it that much?" He was pleased with my
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Nothing short of a masterpiece!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should be more grateful for that compliment.
doctor; but I really have had very little to do with it... You
may be interested to learn that I was an ordinary stonecutter
until about three years ago, hacking out stamped letters with a
compression chisel. From my youth, I had cherished an ambition to
do something important in stone. But there was never any money
for training; never any time for experiment. Such crude and hasty
attempts as I had made, from time to time, had netted nothing but
discouragement.</p>

<p>"One day I went to the church my little girl attended, and
heard a preacher read what is on this page. It evidently meant
nothing to him, for he read it in a dull, monotonous chant. And
the congregation sat glassy-eyed, the words apparently making no
impression. As for me, I was profoundly stirred. The remainder of
the hour was torture, for I wanted out where I could think.</p>

<p>"Hurrying home to our bare little house, I found&mdash;with
considerable difficulty, for I was not familiar with the
Bible&mdash;that page from which the minister had read. There it
was&mdash;in black and white&mdash;the exact process for
achieving power to do, be and have what you want! I
experimented."</p>

<p>With that, Randolph handed me the magic page. Some twenty
lines of it were heavily underscored in red ink. In silence he
puffed his pipe while my eye traversed the cryptic paragraphs,
and when I looked up, inquiringly, he said:</p>

<p>"Of course, you will not realize the full importance of all
this, instantly. It seems simple because it was spoken
dispassionately, with no oratorical bombast or prefatory warning
that the formula he was about to state was the key to power!"</p>

<p>Edging his chair closer to mine, he laid a long hand on my
knee and looked me squarely in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Doctor Hudson&mdash;if you had a small, inadequate brick
house, and decided to give yourself more room, what would you
need for your building?... More brick... If you had a small,
inadequate steam-engine, you would want more steel to construct
larger cylinders&mdash;not a different kind of steel to house a
different kind of steam, but merely more room for expansion...
Now&mdash;if you had a small, inadequate personality, and wanted
to give it a chance to be something more important, where would
you find the building materials?"</p>

<p>He seemed waiting for a reply, so I humoured him.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;according to the drift of your argument, I presume
I would have to build it out of other personalities. Is that what
you're driving at?"</p>

<p>"Precisely!" he shouted. "But&mdash;not 'out of'!...
<i>Into!</i>... Glad you said that, though; for it gives me a
chance to show you the exact difference between the right and
wrong methods of making use of other people's personalities in
improving one's own... Everybody is aware, instinctively, that
his personality is modified by others. Most people go about
imitating various scraps and phases of the personalities that
have attracted them&mdash;copying one man's walk, another's
accent, another's laugh, another's trick of gesture&mdash;making
mere monkeys of themselves... This theory I am talking about
doesn't ask you to build your personality <i>out of</i> other
personalities, but <i>into</i> them!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid all that's too deep for me," I admitted
befuddledly.</p>

<p>He rose and stamped back and forth in front of the grate,
shaking his shaggy mop of grizzled hair, and waving his
long-stemmed pipe as if trying to conjure a better
explanation.</p>

<p>"See here! You know all about blood transfusion. That's in
your line. Superb!... One man puts his life into another man....
Doctor&mdash;how do you accomplish a blood transfusion? Tell me
in detail!"</p>

<p>I explained the principles of transfusion, briefly, and
Randolph seemed mightily pleased, especially with that feature of
it which concerned the problem of coagulation.</p>

<p>"You will notice there," pointing to the page in my hand,
"that this first step toward the achievement of power is an
expansion&mdash;a projection of one's self into other
personalities. You will see that it has to be done with such
absolute secrecy that if, by any chance, the contact is not
immediate and direct&mdash;if, by any chance, there is a leak
along the line of transfer&mdash;the whole effect of it is
wasted! You have to do it so stealthily that even your own left
hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>Randolph returned to his chair, and went on, in a lowered
voice:</p>

<p>"Hudson&mdash;the first time I tried it&mdash;I can tell you
the incident freely because nothing ever came of it, although it
had cost me more than I could afford, at the time, to do
it&mdash;the chap was so grateful he told a neighbour of mine, in
spite of my swearing him in. He had been out of work and there
had been a long run of sickness in the family, and he was too
shabby and down at heel to make a presentable appearance in
asking for a job. I outfitted him. He told it. A neighbour
felicitated me, next day. So there was more than sixty dollars of
my hard-earned cash squandered!"</p>

<p>"Squandered!" I shouted, in amazement. "How squandered? Didn't
he get the job?"</p>

<p>Randolph sighed.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said. "He found a job. I was glad enough for
that, of course. But&mdash;that didn't do <i>me</i> any good!
You'd better believe&mdash;the next time I made an outlay I
informed the fellow that if I ever heard of his telling anybody,
I would break his neck."</p>

<p>He laughed merrily at the remembrance of the incident.</p>

<p>"The man thought I was crazy!" he added, wiping his eyes.</p>

<p>"And you weren't?" I inquired, in a tone that sobered him.</p>

<p>"Really&mdash;it does sound foolish, doesn't it? I
mean&mdash;when you first hear of it. I don't wonder you're
perplexed."</p>

<p>"I am worse than perplexed," I admitted, bluntly. "I'm
disgusted!"</p>

<p>"You might well be," admitted Randolph, "if I were trying to
get power, that way, to stack up a lot of money for my own
pleasure. All I wanted was the effective release of my latent
ability to do something fine!... And, as for being disgusted
because I requested the man not to tell anybody what I had done
for him, if that offends you, you wouldn't like the Lord
himself!... For he often said that to people he had helped."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," I said... "Not very well acquainted
with what he said... Go ahead with your story."</p>

<p>"Thanks... But, first let me lead you just a little farther
into the general philosophy of this... On the night of the day I
made my first successful projection of my personality&mdash;I
cannot tell you what that was&mdash;I dare not&mdash;I went
literally into a closet in my house, and shut the door. That's
the next step in the program, as you have read there on that
page. You see&mdash;I was very much in earnest about this matter;
and, having already bungled one attempt, I was resolved to obey
the rules to the letter... Later, I discovered that the principle
will work elsewhere than in a closet. Just so you're
insulated."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;Randolph&mdash;for God's sake!" I exploded. "What
manner of wild talk is this?"</p>

<p>"I confess I can't understand," said Randolph, impatiently,
"why you find this so hard to accept! Why&mdash;it's in line with
our experience of every other energy we use! Either we meet its
terms, or we don't get the power. What did Volta's battery or
Faraday's dynamo amount to, practically, until Du Fay discovered
an insulation that would protect the current from being
dissipated through contacts with other things than the object to
be energized?... Most personalities are just grounded! That's all
that ails them!</p>

<p>"So, I went into a closet; shut the door; closed my eyes;
quietly put myself into a spiritually receptive mood; and said,
confidently, addressing the Major Personality&mdash;<i>I have
fulfilled all the conditions required of me for receiving power!
I am ready to have it! I want it! I want the capacity to do just
one creditable work of statuary!</i></p>

<p>"Now&mdash;you may be inclined to believe that I experienced a
queer delusion, at that moment. As a scientific man, you may
think that my mental state can easily be accounted for by
principles well known to psychology. If you think that, I have no
objection. The fact that a process of achieving power by the
expansion of the human personality admits of an explanation, in
scientific terms, does not damage its value at all, in my
opinion. I dare say the time will come when this matter is made a
subject of scientific inquiry.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;whether it is explicable or not, I can truthfully
assure you that upon finishing my experiment in that closet, I
received&mdash;as definitely as one receives a shock from an
electrode, or a sudden glare of light by opening a tightly
shuttered room&mdash;a strange inner illumination!</p>

<p>"It was late in the night. I came out of that dark, stifling
little closet with a curious sense of mastery. It put me erect,
flexed the muscles of my jaw, made my step resilient. I wanted to
laugh! I tried to sleep; and, failing of it, walked the streets
until dawn. At eight-thirty, I approached the manager of the
factory and asked for six months' leave. When he inquired my
reason, I told him I had it in mind to attempt a piece of
statuary.</p>

<p>" 'Something we might use, perhaps?' he asked.</p>

<p>" 'I am confident of it,' I said, surprised at my own
audacity. It was enough that I had determined to survive somehow,
without wages, for six months; but now I had made an extravagant
promise to the manager. He was thoughtful for a while and then
said:</p>

<p>" 'I'll give you a chance to try it. For the present, you are
to have your usual pay, and a studio to yourself. If you produce
something we can place, you will share in the sale. Your hours
will be your own business. I should be glad if you
succeeded.'</p>

<p>"I began work at once in a flutter of excitement. The clay
seemed alive in my hands! That first day was a revelation. It was
as if I had never really lived before! All colours were more
vivid. I want you to remember that, Hudson. See if you have the
same reaction. Grass is greener; the sky is bluer; you hear the
birds more distinctly. It sharpens the senses&mdash;like
cocaine.</p>

<p>"That night, I went into my closet again, and was immediately
conscious of a peculiar intimacy between myself and That Other;
but it was not so dynamic as on the previous night. I decided
that if I was to get any more power that way, I would have to
make some further adjustments of my own spiritual equipment.</p>

<p>"That was on a Friday, the tenth of June. On the first day of
September, I invited the manager in to see the cast I had made.
He looked at it for a long time without any remark. Then he said,
quietly, 'I have some people who may be interested in this.'</p>

<p>"It was the figure of a child, a chubby little fellow about
four years old. The boy was posed on one knee. He had just raised
up from his play with a little dog that stood tensely alert, in
front of him, with a ball in his mouth, waiting for the child to
notice him. The boy's shirt was open at the throat. His tight
little knickers were buttoned to broad suspenders. The legs were
bare to the knee. He was looking straight aloft, his little face
all squinted up with baffled amazement, wonderment, curiosity.
His small square hand shaded his eyes against a light almost too
bright for him, the head tilted at an angle indicating that he
had heard something he could not quite understand and was
listening for it to be repeated.</p>

<p>"The next afternoon, the manager's clients came in&mdash;a man
and his wife. She was in black. They had recently lost their
little boy. She cried at first, heart-breakingly. But, after a
while, she smiled. It made me very happy when she smiled. I knew
then that I had been able to express my thought.</p>

<p>"I was told to go on with my project and put it into white
marble... Quite incidentally, the people adopted the boy I had
used for a model."</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>October twenty-sixth, 1913, 10 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">IT was about four o'clock when I left Randolph's
house that night. I was in a grand state of mystification. I went
home resolved that I would make an experiment similar to his.
Before I went to bed, I tried to project my thoughts to some
remote spiritual source, but was conscious of no reaction
whatsoever. In the morning I decided that I had been most
outrageously imposed upon by an eccentric and scowled at my own
reflection in my shaving-mirror. Nobody but a visionary could do
these things with any hope of success, and I was, by training and
temperament, a materialist and a very cold-blooded one, at that.
All that day, however, I was aware of being on a quiet,
unrelenting search for some suitable clinical material to be used
for an experiment in the dynamics of personality-projection...
The strangest feature of my mood, however, was the fact that the
power I had begun, rather vaguely, to grope for&mdash;under
Randolph's urging&mdash;was not the mere satisfaction of an
ambition to make myself important or minister to my own vanity...
For the first time, my profession seemed to me not as a weapon of
self-defence but a means of releasing myself!</p>

<p>The last thing Randolph said to me, at the door, was this
caution: "Be careful how you go into this, my friend! I do not
know the penalties this energy exacts when misused... I've no
notion what dreadful thing might have happened to the Galilean if
he had turned those stones into bread!... But, I warn you!... If
you're thinking of going into this to feather your own nest,
you'd better never give it another thought... I'm not
sure&mdash;but I think it's terribly dangerous stuff to fool
with!"</p>

<p>My own experiences are hereinafter set forth as possible aids
to whoever has had the curiosity to translate this journal. I
trust I have made it quite clear why I have chosen this peculiar
method of passing it along. Had I ventured to report my
experiments, it would have been at the expense of my reputation
for sanity. I do not know of a single friend to whom I could have
told these things without putting an unpleasant constraint
between us. It has been a hard secret to keep. It is equally
hard, I am discovering, to confide&mdash;even with the
realization that these words are unlikely to be read during my
lifetime. I dislike the idea of being thought a fool&mdash;dead
or alive.</p>

<p>You&mdash;whoever you are&mdash;may be inclined to read
on;&mdash;perhaps personally interested in making an experiment;
perhaps just curious. I wonder&mdash;would it be asking an
unreasonable favour&mdash;if you would not consent to stop, at
this point, if you are smiling?... You see, some of these
experiences of mine have meant a great deal to me, emotionally. I
don't believe I should want them laughed at... If the thing
hasn't gripped you a little by now, put it down, please, and
think no more about it... If however you seriously wish to
proceed, let me counsel you, as Randolph counselled me, that you
are taking hold of high tension! Once you have touched it, you
will never be able to let go... If you are of the temperament
that demands self-indulgence to keep you happy and confident
enough to do your work&mdash;and many inestimably valuable people
are so built and cannot help it any more than tall men can help
being tall&mdash;leave all this alone, and go your way!... For if
you make an excursion into this, you're bound! It will plaster a
mortgage on everything you think you own, and commandeer your
time when you might prefer to be using it for yourself... It is
very expensive... It took the man who discovered it to a cross at
the age of thirty-three!</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>October twenty-seventh, 1913, 2 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">I WAS required to stop writing last night
because of a summons to the hospital and now I find that I cannot
go to bed without finishing what I had meant to say. This subject
is not to be taken lightly and I hope to safeguard you against
any misdirected experiments.</p>

<p>It is important that you should know how serious are the
conditions to be met by any man who hopes to increase his own
power by the way of the technique I pursued under instructions
from Randolph.</p>

<p>I must mention them at this juncture, because it is quite
possible these words may be read by some impulsive enthusiast
who, eager to avail himself of the large rewards promised, may
attempt experiments from which he will receive neither pleasure
nor benefit; and, dismayed by failure, find himself worse off in
mind than he was before.</p>

<p>Indeed, this was my own experience at first, Randolph having
neglected to warn me that certain conditions were imperative to
success. I learned them by trial and error.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind, at the outset, that no amount of
altruistic endeavour&mdash;no matter how costly&mdash;can
possibly benefit the donor, if he has in any manner neglected the
natural and normal obligations to which he is expected to be
sensitive. Not only must he be just before attempting to be
generous; he must figure this particular investment of himself as
a higher altruism, quite other than mere generosity.</p>

<p>Every conceivable responsibility must have had full attention
before one goes in search of opportunity to perform secret
services to be used for the express purpose of expanding one's
personality that it may become receptive of that inexplicable
energy which guarantees personal power.</p>

<p>My own life had been set in narrow ways. I had had but small
chance to injure or defraud, even had I been of a scheming
disposition. There had been a minimum of buying and selling in my
program. I had lived mostly under strict supervision&mdash;in
school, in college, and as an interne&mdash;with no chance to
make many grave or irretrievable blunders.</p>

<p>Once I began to discharge my obligations, however, it was
startling to note how considerably I was in the red. For example:
I found that there were a good many men, scattered here and
there, who had been scratched off my books. Either actually, or
to all practical intents, they had been told to go to hell. In
some cases, there had been enough provocation to justify my
pitching them out of my life, I thought. But, more often than
otherwise, they were to be remembered as persons with whom I had
sustained some manner of close contact&mdash;close enough to make
a disruption possible. I discovered that almost without exception
the people I had pushed away from me&mdash;consigned to hell, if
you like&mdash;were once intimately associated with me... So far
as I was concerned they had gone to hell taking along with them a
very considerable part of me!</p>

<p>To lose a friend in whom one had invested something of one's
personality was, I discovered, to have lost a certain amount of
one's self.</p>

<p>The successful pursuit of the philosophy now before you
demands that you restore whatever of your personality has been
dissipated, carted off by other people. If any of its essential
energy has been scattered, it must be recovered.</p>

<p>The original proposer of this theory, aware of the importance
of insuring against such losses, advised that all
misunderstandings should be settled on the spot. When an
estrangement takes a friend out of your normal contacts with him,
he leaves with part of you in his hand. You must gather up these
fragments of yourself, by some hook or crook, so that you have at
least all of the personality that rightfully belongs to you,
before you attempt its larger projection.</p>

<p>In the next place: you may make the mistake of seeking far and
wide for opportunities to build yourself into other personalities
through their rehabilitation. A happy circumstance kept me from
doing that. Strangely enough, the first really important service
I was permitted to do, prefatory to experimenting with this
mysterious dynamic, was for the daughter of the man who had shown
me the way to it... I risked what small repute I had, and put a
mortgage on whatever I might hope to acquire, by the performance
of an operation that saved her life, and, quite incidentally,
brought me three pages of comment in the next edition of the
<i>Medical Encyclopaedia</i>.</p> <hr>

<h2>BRIGHTWOOD HOSPITAL<br> <i>Sunday Night, November ninth,
1913</i></h2>

<p class="first">THAT operation on Natalie Randolph's fractured
skull marked the beginning of my specialization in brain surgery,
and because of its importance in determining the nature of my
professional activities, I feel that the events which immediately
preceded it should be recorded here. If you prefer to consider
them as coincidental rather than causative, you are quite at
liberty to make that deduction. In my own opinion, my investment
in Tim Watson and the success of my operation on Natalie Randolph
were integrally related.</p>

<p>On Wednesdays and Saturdays, that summer, I was on duty in the
Out-Patient Department of our Free Clinic. This assignment was
extremely distasteful. Ailing indigence, bathed and fumigated and
in bed, clad in a sterilized hospital gown, was one thing; sick
poverty, on its feet&mdash;with black fingernails, greasy
clothes, a musty smell, and a hangdog air&mdash;was offensive to
me. I was not a snob. I was born poor and brought up in a home
where the most rigid economies were practiced. The first new suit
of clothes I ever owned (it cost sixteen dollars) was purchased
when I entered high school. But&mdash;all the same&mdash;I
thoroughly detested those long, hot, midsummer afternoons in the
dingy Free Clinic, and I am afraid I made very little effort to
disguise my aversion to the dull and dirty patients who grimly
applied for its benefits.</p>

<p>For the most part, it was a thankless task. Not many of them
co-operated with us. They wouldn't take their medicine according
to directions; complained that their treatment did them no good;
the majority of them were surly, stupid, and stubborn. Many of
the men stank of cheap liquor and tried to wheedle you out of a
half-dollar to buy more.</p>

<p>Perhaps if there had been only a few patients to deal with,
during an afternoon, one might have been more disposed to analyse
their disgusting infirmities with more sympathy and listen to
their assorted misfortunes with more interest; but they came too
thick and fast for painstaking attention. In my own defence I
must insist that it wasn't their poverty that exasperated me, for
God knows I was having a struggle to make both ends meet, myself.
My salary was small, and it was difficult to economize. Little
Joyce required the attention of a full-time practical nurse, who
served also as my housekeeper. Those were difficult days, and I
was in a position to be sympathetic with any man whose pockets
were empty.</p>

<p>But I hated that clinic. Our elders and betters on the
hospital staff pretended to believe that it was good practice for
us young fellows; but it wasn't. It was the worst training
imaginable, tending to make a doctor cold-blooded and
careless.</p>

<p>One afternoon in latter August, within a few minutes of the
closing hour, a young chap was shown into my cramped cubicle with
his left hand bound in a dirty rag. He was about eighteen, six
feet tall, lean as a bean-pole. He had a good head, thatched with
a tousled mop of the reddest hair I had ever seen. His eyes were
blue and edged with premature crow's-feet which gave them a
defiant hardness. If it hadn't been for the pair of boyish
dimples in his tanned cheeks, he would have looked decidedly
tough. He was bareheaded and badly sunburned; wore a soiled gray
suit that wasn't big enough for his rangy frame, a blue shirt
with a rumpled collar, and a pair of cheap and dusty
sneakers.</p>

<p>I pointed indifferently to the other chair. He sat down and
began unwrapping the hand.</p>

<p>"Pretty bandage," I remarked. "What was it, originally, a
shirt-tail?"</p>

<p>He drew a sardonic grin, dropped the rag on the floor, and
extended his injured hand. It was badly swollen and there were
deep abrasions across the knuckles.</p>

<p>"Looks as if it's broken," I guessed.</p>

<p>"Yeah," he agreed, "right there: those two metacarpals."</p>

<p>"Know your bones, eh?" I glanced up and met his eyes.</p>

<p>"What's that called?" I revolved a finger-tip lightly on his
wrist.</p>

<p>"Sesamoid."</p>

<p>"Would you say that was a bone?"</p>

<p>"Umm&mdash;well&mdash;it's partly cartilage."</p>

<p>"Want to tell me how you got hurt&mdash;and when? This hand
has been neglected. It's in bad shape."</p>

<p>"Last night. The freight was pulling out of the yards and
picking up speed faster than I thought. I missed my hold, and
fell on my hand."</p>

<p>"You must have had something in your hand, or you would have
met the gravel with your palm down."</p>

<p>He liked my deduction and his eyes lighted a little.</p>

<p>"That's right," he said. "Handful of chocolate bars."</p>

<p>"You swiped them," I announced casually.</p>

<p>He nodded and asked me how I knew. And I told him he must have
been very hungry to have hung on to the candy when he might have
broken his fall more safely with his open hand.</p>

<p>"And if you had had the money to buy the chocolate bars," I
continued, "you would have bought a hot dog or a hamburger
instead."</p>

<p>"I didn't have time to think which was the safest way to
land."</p>

<p>"That's true," I agreed. "When you are very hungry, your
stomach does your thinking for you. Are you hungry now?"</p>

<p>He nodded, adding, "But if you're going to set this hand, I'll
need a little ether, won't I?"</p>

<p>"What do you know about such things?" I inquired.</p>

<p>He grinned.</p>

<p>"My father was a doctor," he said, "and I've read a lot of his
books." He made a self-deprecatory little gesture. "About the
only books I ever did read. I hated school."</p>

<p>Having confided that much, he responded to my encouragement
and told me some more. His name was Watson. His father had died
when he was ten. His mother had married again. The stepfather had
resented his presence in their home. After a while, his
mother&mdash;unable to defend him without a constant
battle&mdash;began to take sides with her husband, in the
interest of peace.</p>

<p>"But I don't blame her," the boy went on. "I wasn't very easy
to get along with. I played hooky pretty often. And once I
operated on a cat. I got licked almost to death for that."</p>

<p>"How about the cat?" I couldn't help asking.</p>

<p>"He got well. I didn't hurt him. Doped him with
chloroform."</p>

<p>"You'll have to tell me about the operation when we've
finished with yours," I said, rising. "Come on. I'll fix you up.
What's your first name, Watson?"</p>

<p>"Timothy. Tim."</p>

<p>"All right, Tim. Follow me. No&mdash;don't put that rag on
again. You're in enough trouble without that."</p>

<p>As I led him into the operating chamber, he was interested in
everything but his injury. I think he would have been willing to
undergo an amputation rather than miss the experience of seeing
our preparations to reduce his fractures and clean up his cuts.
The last thing he said before the anaesthetist put the cone over
his lean face was, "Gee&mdash;it must be great to be a
doctor!"</p>

<p>They renovated him and put him to bed. I was under no
obligation to look at him again that evening; but I went over to
the hospital about nine. He was awake&mdash;and smiled.</p>

<p>"How does it feel, Tim?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"About the way it ought to, I think."</p>

<p>"In the morning you may have some ham and eggs for
breakfast."</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;I'll be discharged?" he asked, a bit
anxiously.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I think we will keep you here for a few days; make
sure those scratches heal safely. You hadn't any other plans, had
you?"</p>

<p>Tim chuckled.</p>

<p>"Plans!" he echoed. "Hell&mdash;no."</p>

<p>I surprised myself by saying, "Well&mdash;maybe we can make
some. Well see. I'll drop in again in the morning."</p>

<p>He reached out his good hand and I took it. At the door, I
paused to say, "Good night." But his face was turned away, and he
did not reply.</p> <hr>

<h2>BRIGHTWOOD HOSPITAL<br> <i>November 14, 1913, 8.30
p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">THE lacerations on young Watson's knuckles
showed no signs of infection when I examined him the next
morning, and the fractures would take care of themselves. He
could have been safely discharged at once. Under ordinary
procedure we would have sent him packing without delay. But I
couldn't bear to turn him out into the street.</p>

<p>My own early experiences in Detroit had much to do with my
interest in this chap. At his age I had wanted to study medicine;
an absurd aspiration, for I had no resources at all. My chance
came through what seemed at the time to have been a lucky
accident. In recent years I have had reasons for changing my mind
about "accidents." I do not mean that there are no accidents: I
mean that many unexpected events, classified as accidents,
deserve to be called something else.</p>

<p>My thoughts on this subject are still in a fluid state, but I
shall share them with you, my friend, and you may make of them
whatever you like.</p>

<p>I am not inviting you to believe (or to believe I believe)
that everything occurs by design and decree. Such a
theory&mdash;if pursued to its logical end&mdash;would destroy
human freedom and make mere puppets of us all. But I do think
that if a man is suddenly interrupted by some unheralded
event&mdash;not of his own contriving&mdash;and is thereby
deflected for a time from the course he had been pursuing, he
would be well advised to keep his eyes open for some new and
valuable opportunity which this circumstance may provide. Even if
the so-called accident involves a great deal of pain and
hardship, the victim may have a right to suspect that he has been
very far off the track leading to the full development and
expression of his powers; that severe discipline may be necessary
to recondition his mind for a discovery of his unrecognized
talents and capacities.</p>

<p>Every day, here at Brightwood, where so many victims of
accidents put in for repairs, I see patients who haven't the
slightest notion that their experience might be turned to good
account. They whine and growl and fret over the discomforts of a
tedious convalescence; and, after a few restless weeks of
uncapitalized apathy, they pull on their pants and leave, with
nothing to show for their time but a receipted hospital bill.</p>

<p>Once in a blue moon, somebody gets the idea that he may have
been laid up for a purpose, like a ship in dry-dock getting her
barnacles scraped off. To such as these, who have confided to me
that they have found comfort in this supposition, I have lent
some encouragement; but I have never taken the initiative in such
a discussion. In my capacity as a surgeon, I can't go about
telling people they have been whacked on the head to give them a
chance to reorganize themselves and find out what they are good
for. Such talk would quickly discredit a man in my position. His
colleagues would crack jokes at his expense. He would soon be
regarded as some sort of faith-healer; a quack, at heart; a
fellow who plays around with the angels. No&mdash;if I'm serving
as a surgeon I must be respected as a sound scientist; and there
is no room in science&mdash;at present&mdash;for a theory of this
character.</p>

<p>And, curiously enough, everything in me naturally revolts
against such notions. Even in the face of my own experiences and
observations, if some friend of mine should break down and
confide to me his belief that almost nothing happens by accident;
that Fate, or a busy-body Providence, or some such other-worldly
Mr. Fixit trots about banging misdirected people on the topknot,
or laying them low with a lumbar tumour, to the excellent end
that they might have time to orient themselves in regard to their
gifts, their duties, and their destinies, I should think him a
little bit unhooked.</p>

<p>To save his face, I should probably concede that strange
things do happen; that many an apparent misfortune has turned out
to be a blessing. I might tell him about an eminent lawyer of my
acquaintance, whose father owned a planing-mill and wanted his
boy to learn the trade; and the boy collided with a saw and lost
three fingers, ruining him for a career in the mill.
But&mdash;all the same&mdash;I should privately rate the man an
eccentric, who maintained that our seeming accidents are planned
for us and our ultimate good, and it wouldn't surprise me if he
turned up, some day, with the confidential report that he had
just lunched with some prominent member of the Heavenly Host.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">You see, my friend, I am trying to be honest
with you about all this. It is a dangerous subject to talk about,
and surely no man dares be dogmatic when he expresses an opinion
on it.</p>

<p>In the laboratory, many an experiment that is utterly
bewildering to the layman is clear enough to the chemist. If you
pour water into sulphuric acid the effect is far different than
if you had poured sulphuric acid into water&mdash;a startling
phenomenon that baffles the uninformed, though the chemist knows
the secret.</p>

<p>But this thing that we have been talking about&mdash;you may
experiment with it as long as you like, and not know much more
about it than when you began. In this field, nobody is an expert;
everyone is a layman. And when any man sets out to prove, by his
own experience, that we are all in the grip of spiritual forces,
he will demonstrate nothing but his mental untidiness.</p>

<p>Doubtless there are plenty of real accidents which shouldn't
have happened; involve no hidden purpose; hold no possibilities
for good. Almost anybody could compile a few cases in which
painful events opened a way to happiness&mdash;if not to
greatness. I know a woman who broke her leg and wrote a highly
successful novel while she was convalescing, but I have seen many
women with broken legs who did not write novels or discover any
other opportunity to make capital of their enforced leisure. I
once amputated an infected arm that had got into trouble with a
rusty fish-hook. The fellow was a loafer, with no interest in
anything but fish and fishing. It was all he could talk about. We
had him with us for weeks, and to entertain him we ransacked the
libraries for books about fish. He went out, at length, and found
a good job in a government fish-hatchery; and, to the amazement
of everybody, distinguished himself as an expert in the
disabilities of salmon, or something like that. But I have cared
for many a loafer who never amounted to anything afterward.</p>

<p>You can't afford to be doctrinal when you consider accidents
as the work of Providence. One man accidentally burns some rubber
on the kitchen stove and discovers vulcanization; another fellow
has much the same sort of accident and merely sets the house on
fire. One man accidentally spills some camphor into a pan of
collodion and gets celluloid; another man accidentally upsets a
bottle of something into a pan of something else, and goes out
through the skylight. One redoubtable reformer gets tossed into
jail, and whiles away the time by writing <i>Pilgrim's
Progress</i>. Another equally good and zealous martyr goes to
jail and merely gets lousy.</p>

<p>But the ways of Providence are well worth thinking about, if
one can do it in a spirit of inquiry rather than with a
determination to organize a cult and enlist disciples. This thing
will not stand the strain of being woven into a creed: I am sure
of that.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Something tells me, though, that all persons in
trouble should be exposed to a consideration of this subject,
even if it doesn't obey a formula.</p>

<p>I have often wondered if it might not be an interesting
experiment, in a hospital, to hand each patient&mdash;on arrival,
or as soon as he is able to read anything&mdash;a little manual
of advice.</p>

<p>As the matter stands, it's nobody's business to offer counsel
on this subject. A few stark injunctions are tacked to the wall.
Don't clog the plumbing. Don't throw banana-skins out of the
window. And so forth. All the advice the patient gets presupposes
that he is a destructive fool whose previous experience in public
institutions has been limited to the calaboose and the
poorhouse.</p>

<p>There is a wide-open market here for some friendly talk to
these unhappy guests. The little booklet might run something like
this:</p><br>

<p class="quote">We are honestly sorry for people who, through no
fault of their own, are obliged to undergo discomfort, pain, and
boredom, in this hospital. But it is not our fault, either, that
you encountered the illness or accident that brought you
here.</p>

<p class="quote">This is not a hotel. Hotels must pay their own
way or close up. Hospitals do not pay their way, but they do not
close up; for, at the end of the year, the deficit is absorbed by
a company of kind-hearted people who believe that we are trying
to do our best. We hope you will share in this belief; for it is
important to your comfort&mdash;and perhaps also to the
promptness of your recovery&mdash;if you consider this place as a
friendly refuge; not a mere money-making repair-shop.</p>

<p class="quote">Our nurses are well-trained. Part of this
training is in the control of their personal feelings. If they do
not seem very much upset over your gas-pains, that does not mean
they are indifferent: it means only that they are disciplined.
They have many distasteful tasks to perform, and they do them
without showing how they feel on the subject; but that does not
mean they are insensitive. They are just as human as anyone else;
have their own little frets and forebodings; their days of
disappointment and depression. Sometimes a patient's cheerfulness
will help a nurse to a fresh grip on herself.</p>

<p class="quote">Your doctor wants you to get well as rapidly as
possible. In this matter, you and he share the same wish. He will
appreciate your full co-operation. Some morning when you are
feeling unusually well, you may offer him a little witticism, and
be dismayed to note that he fails to respond to it. But that
isn't because he is indifferent. More likely it is because he has
just put in an hour and a half of tense and trying service in the
operating-room; and he doesn't feel jocular. If he can sense your
sympathetic understanding of his mood, your attitude will be of
much benefit to him.</p>

<p class="quote">In short&mdash;if you want to get the largest
degree of satisfaction out of your experience in this hospital,
join hands with us, almost as if you were a member of the
organization. If you believe in the hospital, and in the skill
and sincerity of the doctors and nurses, you will not be troubled
by the little vexations and irritations which menace the peace of
many patients.</p>

<p class="quote">Perhaps we, who are devoting our energies to the
care of the sick and injured, should be contented if we were able
to dismiss you fully restored and sound as you were before.</p>

<p class="quote">But we have an ambition still higher than that.
It would gratify us immensely if&mdash;when you leave us to
resume your activities&mdash;you might go out not only repaired
physically but reinvigorated in mind and heart.</p>

<p class="quote">In the normal ways of an uneventful life, people
do not often have a chance to find out how much pain they can
endure, or how long they can wait. Here they can take their own
measure, and discover their strengths. Many a man, in
peace-time, has wondered how stalwart he might be on a
battle-field, facing danger, risking agonies. Circumstances may
provide him a chance to learn, in the hospital, whether he has
what it takes to be a good soldier. We do not conduct these
examinations. The patient examines himself, and marks his own
grade. Ever afterward he will be pleased and proud if he passes
with credit. No matter what may happen to him, in the future, he
will always know exactly how much disappointment, anxiety,
inconvenience, and pain he can stand. It's worth something to a
man to find that out. So&mdash;if you have been informed that the
doctor is taking out your stitches to-morrow, you can do yourself
a good turn&mdash;that will last you all your life&mdash;if you
face up to this in the morning without flinching. You have always
wondered, when you saw others in trouble, whether you could take
it. Now you know. It's a very gratifying thing: almost everybody
finds out that he is braver than he thought he was. It's worth
going through a lot of perplexity and pain&mdash;just to be
assured on that matter.</p>

<p class="quote">Sometimes people who hadn't succeeded in making
anything very important of themselves&mdash;either inside or
outside of themselves&mdash;have discovered, during the enforced
leisure of a convalescence, certain neglected gifts which they
have thereafter exercised to their immeasurable satisfaction.</p>

<p class="quote">In many instances, this self-discovery has
resulted in such a marked expansion of interest and success in
after-life, that the beneficiary has wondered whether Destiny had
not shunted him off his course in order to let him take stock of
his resources.</p>

<p class="quote">We suggest, therefore, that you give a little
thought to this subject while you are with us. Was it an
accident? Was it a misfortune? Was it a mishap that brought you
here? Think this over. We think about it a great deal.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Young Watson's case vividly recalled my own
first acquaintance with Detroit. It was in mid-August. We had
threshed the wheat, the day before, and my father and my uncle
were starting, that morning, on a few days' fishing trip. I had
strongly hinted that I should like to go along, but there seemed
no room for me.</p>

<p>Barnum and Bailey's big show was to be in Detroit that day. I
knew better than to ask if I might go. I had saved something like
six dollars, which would be ample to cover expenses; but I knew I
should be reproached if I squandered my money in this manner.
But, having been left out of the fishing excursion, after a hard
summer's work, I felt that I was badly treated and would be quite
justified if I helped myself to a day's outing.</p>

<p>Father and Uncle Jim were to start at five. I quietly sneaked
out of the house at four, walked three miles to the little
station at Wimple, and waited for the milk-train to come along.
Arriving in Detroit at noon, I took a street-car to the circus
grounds where I spent one of the most exciting days of my life. I
saw it all; the menagerie, the demobilization of the garish
parade, the circus and spectacular pageant "The Burning of Rome."
I also patronized several units of the side-show. It was
six-thirty before I left the grounds and boarded a crowded
street-car for the business district. My train did not leave
until nine-thirty.</p>

<p>After a long ride, we were clanging through brighter lights
and heavier traffic, so I got off and sauntered along the edges
of the crowd on the broad pavement, staring into the shop
windows. Besides my return ticket, I had a little money left, and
decided to look for a cheap restaurant. There didn't seem to be
one on this street, so I turned the corner and walked a couple of
blocks, looking for an eating-place that might fit my
resources.</p>

<p>Presently I came to a caf that had a very imposing front.
Several very elegant turnouts were drawn up along the curb, the
drivers lounging near their horses' heads. I ambled past,
inspecting them with admiration. A tall, handsome man with a
flushed face lurched out of the caf and walked unsteadily down
the street, pausing before a pair of beautiful roans harnessed to
an open stanhope. One of the drivers called to his neighbour,
"Doc's pretty well oiled."</p>

<p>I followed along slowly, though it wasn't much like me to take
a curious interest in anyone's humiliation. The near horse, tied
to the hitching-post, had tugged his bridle off and seemed about
to bolt. "Doc" was making an unsuccessful effort to put the
bridle on.</p>

<p>"Let me do it," I said.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, thickly, "if you think you can."</p>

<p>It wasn't easy to do, for the horse was nervous, but I
managed.</p>

<p>"You know how to drive?" asked Doc. "I'll give you two dollars
if you drive me home."</p>

<p>I told him I had to take a train at nine-thirty, but if he
thought I could drive him home and get back in time, I would do
it&mdash;adding that I didn't want to be paid for it. My attitude
seemed to please him; for, shortly after we started, he professed
an interest in me. I told him where I lived; that I had come to
the circus; that this was the first time I had ever been in the
city alone; that I wished I could stay in the city; that I didn't
like to work on the farm; that I wouldn't stay on the farm if
there was any chance to get away. All this was in reply to
questions, for I was not naturally garrulous.</p>

<p>Then it was "Doc's" turn. He told me he was Doctor Cummings.
My heart gave a hard bump. We often read of Doctor Cummings in
the papers. He was said to be one of the finest surgeons in the
country. It was hard to believe that I was sitting by his side,
driving him home. And he was talking to me as if I really was
somebody. He told me that his hostler had been away for two days
on a spree; couldn't depend on the fellow any more; wondered if I
could stay and look after the horses until he could find another
man.</p>

<p>I did not pause to consider what my father might think of
this, nor how much my mother might worry if I failed to show up
at home. All I could think of was the fact that I should be
working for a doctor&mdash;one of the greatest doctors! I said I
would stay.</p>

<p>"And so you don't like the farm," remarked Doctor Cummings.
"Anything else in mind?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'd laugh, sir," I confessed, adding, "I have
never told anybody."</p>

<p>"But me," encouraged Doctor Cummings, "and I won't tell."</p>

<p>"I want to be a doctor," I confided, "but I'm afraid it's no
good. We haven't the money. I'm not even sure my father can
afford to send me to high school."</p>

<p>He didn't say anything for a while. Then he asked me my name
and I told him. Then there was another long silence.</p>

<p>"So&mdash;you are not interested in anything but medicine; is
that right?" he said, rousing from what must have been a little
nap.</p>

<p>"That&mdash;and swimming," I replied.</p>

<p>"You like to swim?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose you must swim pretty well."</p>

<p>"Like a water spaniel," I boasted. "If I can't be a doctor,
I'll have to be a professional swimmer."</p>

<p>There was another long pause.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you stay here for a while, Wayne, and look after
my horses," said Doctor Cummings, "and we will see what we can
do. I don't think there's much of a future in swimming."</p>

<p>So&mdash;that was how I got my chance to study medicine. I
began it by being Doctor Cummings' shadow. I was his hostler,
errand boy, and diplomatic agent. Drunk or sober, he was always
kind to me. And he gave me my opportunity to go to school. If it
had not been for my meeting him, that night, when he needed
someone to look after him, my whole life might have been set in a
different key.</p>

<p>Perhaps that circumstance was accidental; but I don't think
so.</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>November twentieth, 1913, 9 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">DURING that summer I frequently spent Sunday
evenings with Randolph. On these occasions I would finish at the
hospital about four and drive home in the primitive but expensive
Cadillac that Joyce had bought before we went to Arizona&mdash;an
extravagance we could not afford, but it was her money. And I
didn't have the heart to tell her how low we were in funds. She
was not to be here long, and it was no time to be economical.</p>

<p>After making sure that my little girl was being properly cared
for (it would presently be her bedtime), I would drive out to
Randolph's sequestered home on the north side, where there would
be a light supper and some good talk, with my host usually
initiating the conversation. I think it was these serious but
stimulating chats with Randolph that sustained my spirit through
that perplexing period. But for him I fear I might have found my
professional duties too irksome to be borne. I had very little
work to do that presented any challenge. The nearest approach to
it had been an emergency case&mdash;a pretty bad
concussion&mdash;that had come in, late one night, when the only
ranking surgeon available was Doctor Pyle, who, though a very
able abdominal man, never tackled a head if there was anybody
else at hand competent to do it. This operation wouldn't wait;
and Pyle, remembering that I had been much attracted to brain
surgery while in school, summoned me in. It was not a difficult
operation&mdash;as such things go&mdash;and the patient made a
prompt recovery, as he should have done. I lived on the thrill of
that experience for many days. But events calculated to stir my
interest and professional pride were few and far between. It was
Randolph who held me up.</p>

<p>Looking back from this distance, I think Randolph was wise in
not pressing me too urgently with his strange theory. After the
first few days' enchanted wistfulness, following the night when
Randolph confided his secret for more important living, the sheen
faded perceptibly from this promising prospect. This was, of
course, inevitable. It is very difficult to endure an unabating
emotional storm, even if that were desirable. And I want to call
your attention to this fact, before it is overlooked.</p>

<p>If you, my friend, are moved to a deep interest in this
subject, keep it in mind that your resolve to pursue it does not
insure you against the inescapable sag that follows an
unaccustomed emotional exaltation. If this thing really lays hold
upon you, it is likely that you will feel&mdash;for a few days,
at least&mdash;as if you had come into the possession of some
magic, good for all weathers; and, when you find the same old
rain dampening your spirit as usual, you are very apt to say,
"Oh&mdash; what the hell!" Let me assure you that this witchery
does not guarantee against any further experience of boredom;
neither does it pledge that from henceforth you will enjoy all
your routine tasks and smile steadily at your
disappointments.</p>

<p>In other words&mdash;don't consider this thing as a Pullman
car in which you have engaged a berth, with the understanding
that it will carry you forward&mdash;waking or
sleeping&mdash;toward your desired destination.</p>

<p>Randolph made no effort to fan the flame he had lighted in me.
To the contrary, he counselled an exercise of cool common-sense
in accepting the theory that had literally transformed his
life.</p>

<p>"Some day," he would remark placidly, "you will find a
project, and then you can attempt an experiment. But don't go
feverishly sniffing about for a beneficiary. That would certainly
put you into the wrong state of mind. It would mean that you
wanted to do someone a service with the expectation of material
reward."</p>

<p>And I needed this counsel, too; for that's what I had been
doing. For example: there was an old orderly at the hospital who
had been there for a long time, and couldn't keep up with his
job. They let him out, and I promptly nosed into his affairs to
see if I could do him some little kindness. I was emphatically
snubbed by the family, for they considered me a part of the
heartless hospital organization that had tossed the old man out
onto the scrap-pile for the relatives to gather up. He was a
surly old codger, and before I had finished my proffered
ministration I realized that I had picked the wrong fellow for
clinical material. I told Randolph about it and he grinned.</p>

<p>"Better let the family attend to such matters," he advised.
"It is their responsibility and it will be good for them to
accept it. It is quite possible, though," he added, with a
twinkle, "that the family's haughty repudiation of your interest
in papa will require them to take much better care of him than
they might have if you hadn't welded them together with their own
outraged pride. So&mdash;perhaps it isn't a total loss&mdash;what
you did."</p>

<p>And we had a middle-aged nurse who was worried over the
truancy of her twelve-year-old boy. This problem had provided the
woman with so many alibis that I decided to look into the case.
The boy was indeed a problem. While I was trying to think of
something to do about it, I observed that the incorrigible's
silly mother&mdash;utterly mistaking my motives&mdash;coyly
conceived the idea that I was interested in her. When it became
clear that she was even more eager to help me than I was to help
her obnoxious son, we both dropped the matter by mutual
consent.</p>

<p>Randolph was amused. "Don't grow impatient for an
opportunity," he said. "Doubtless you will recognize it when it
comes."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Young Watson had been in the hospital since
Wednesday afternoon's clinic. I think he knew I should have
discharged</p>

<p>him, for he was bright and uncommonly well versed&mdash;for a
youngster and a layman&mdash;in medical procedure.</p>

<p>On the Sunday of which I am writing now, he had said, when I
called in the morning to see him, "You have been very good to me.
Doctor Hudson. But I shouldn't stay much longer."</p>

<p>"Want to go?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It isn't that," he replied, "but I am well now."</p>

<p>"Have you any place&mdash;in particular&mdash;to go?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no," he confessed, "but it doesn't matter
much&mdash;does it&mdash;whether I go out bumming it
to-day&mdash;or Tuesday?"</p>

<p>"We'll make it Tuesday," I said, reproaching myself for
implying that there might be a solution to his problem in a day
or two. There was nothing I could do for him. I might have tried
to find him some menial job, but even that would have been
impossible with his broken hand. It would be five or six weeks
before he would have any practical use of it. I couldn't support
him until he was able to work at starvation wages. I had no room
for him in my apartment. No&mdash;it was quite out of the
question.</p>

<p>That evening, Randolph and young Natalie and I had supper
under the big maple on their secluded rear lawn; and, after the
girl had excused herself, we sat smoking our pipes. Randolph
wanted to know, after a considerable pause in the conversation,
whether anything interesting had happened in the hospital. It had
been a fairly typical, fairly tiresome week, I said. The clinics
had been about as drab and dirty as ever.</p>

<p>"Just one enlivening, and rather perplexing incident," I went
on. "A young fellow came in the other day with a broken hand;
hurt it falling off a freight-car; quite an unusual chap, for a
tramp; very likable boy; left home on account of family trouble;
the old stock story of a beastly stepfather and a mother who is
badgered into being a stepmother; deceased father a doctor; the
boy had access to his medical library; pretty well posted on
Physiology. I could have discharged him, almost at once, but I
didn't like to turn him loose."</p>

<p>Randolph blew several smoke-rings, but made no comment. "I'll
have to let him go, in a couple of days," I continued. "He can't
work with a broken hand; and, in any case, he has no training for
a city job. Eventually&mdash;after he is sick of tramping and
riding on freight trains&mdash;he'll have to stop somewhere and
work on a farm. Might amount to something, I think, if he were
taken in hand. But I can't see it as my job." I paused to give my
host a chance to make some rejoinder. Randolph, with his eyes
half closed and his head tipped back, continued to blow
smoke-rings.</p>

<p>"He's probably a bum&mdash;at heart," I went on. "Probably
couldn't settle down to anything. requiring perseverance." I
puffed meditatively on my pipe for a while, and asked, "What do
you think?"</p>

<p>Some moments elapsed before he gave any sign that he had heard
what I had been saying; just sat there blowing rings and staring
into the darkening sky and the arriving stars. Then he slowly
turned toward me, drew a short sigh, smiled apologetically, and
said, "Forgive me, Hudson. I'm afraid I was wool-gathering. It's
such a glorious night! Shall we go in? The dew is falling.
Besides&mdash;I want to beat you at chess."</p>

<p>I felt rebuffed. It was not at all like Randolph to be so
inattentive. We rose and walked toward the house, his hand in the
crook of my arm, as if to reassure me of his comradeship. On the
doorstep he paused, detaining me, and said-just above a whisper,
"I didn't mean to be so rude."</p>

<p>It miffed me a bit to have Randolph binding up my babyish
bruises, and blotting my tears and blowing my little nose for me;
and I replied, crisply, "I didn't mean to be so
uninteresting."</p>

<p>He refused to be annoyed; chuckled a little; gave me a
friendly slap on the shoulder, and said, "You were not
uninteresting, Hudson; you were just unimpressed."</p>

<p>"By the sky&mdash;you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;the sky is impressive, to-night; that's a
fact."</p>

<p>We played chess until eleven. Randolph came along out with me
to the gate. As I climbed into my car, he said, "Be careful now,
Hudson. Good night. God bless you!"</p>

<p>It was an odd thing for Randolph to say. Be careful. God bless
you. Almost as if he was giving me farewell advice. In the
guarded, urgent tone of one sending another forth on some sort of
hazardous mission. Be careful now. God bless you. The words
resounded in my ears.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">That night I went through my modest wardrobe,
remembering that Watson was about my height, though lacking
fifteen pounds of my weight, and selected a suit of clothes for
him. And a couple of shirts and some collars.</p>

<p>There was a small room in the apartment which had been used as
a "den." I had my books in there, a desk, a couple of chairs; but
the room could be spared. I dragged everything into my bedroom.
Next morning, on the way to the hospital, I stopped at a
furniture store and bought an inexpensive cot.</p>

<p>I wasn't sure that Watson would be willing to avail himself of
my hospitality, but I had decided to put it up to him. He was up
in the solarium when I called on him at ten.</p>

<p>"Tim," I said, "I am going to let you go now."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Tim. "I'm ready."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I should like to have you stay with me, at my home,
for a few days. You are well enough to be out of the hospital,
but not quite well enough to be on the road. Will you do
that?"</p>

<p>Tim shook his head.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be fair," he said. "I'm not going to impose on
you. You don't owe me anything. You've done enough."</p>

<p>"But I'm afraid I should fret about you&mdash;and you don't
want me losing sleep on your account. Better do as I say. You
will be at liberty to go&mdash;any time you like."</p>

<p>He drew a quizzical face and did not reply for some
moments.</p>

<p>"All right," he agreed, reluctantly. "But I don't want to be a
panhandler. Maybe there's something I could do to help
myself."</p>

<p>"We'll see," I said.</p>

<p>I drove him home at noon.</p>

<p>"I can wash your car," said Tim. "That's good," I said. "It
needs it."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">When I got up, the next morning, I found Tim
running a dry mop around the edge of the rugs, holding the end of
the handle under his left arm, and making a very satisfactory job
of it, too.</p>

<p>I had a notion to tell him he needn't try to do any work under
such conditions, but fortunately thought better of it. If he
wanted to make an effort to show his gratitude, he had a right to
do it.</p>

<p>I have had many occasions to meditate on this subject. Anyone
who has had experience in giving&mdash;and getting&mdash;knows
that it is much easier to be generous than grateful. Generosity
expands you; builds you up; stiffens your spine. But if you are
on the receiving end of this philanthropy, you either have to do
something to earn it and demonstrate your gratitude, or the gift
is likely to tear you down. It is indeed more blessed to give
than to receive.</p>

<p>And I think that what passes sometimes for ingratitude is an
insurmountable feeling of chagrin. It should be kept in mind that
any gift&mdash;no matter how much it may seem to be to a man's
immediate advantage&mdash;can do him a permanent injury if it has
the effect of damaging his pride. Persons who find delight in
helping others should exercise the greatest of tactfulness.</p>

<p>Of course any sensible person will agree to this, for it is so
obvious; but it is not easy to practice. One time I gave a fairly
good suit of clothes to a fellow; and, because he looked hungry,
I put a dollar into one of the pockets. He had no opportunity to
find the money, in my presence. I had found a box, so that the
chap wouldn't have to go down the street with his new possessions
over his arm. Early the next morning, he showed up at my door
with the dollar, and I told him to keep it, which he did with
honest reluctance. Afterward it occurred to me that I had made a
serious mistake. The man thought it quite possible that I had
overlooked the dollar. He wanted to demonstrate his integrity. If
I had permitted him to do this gracious thing for me, it would
doubtless have gone a long way toward repairing his self-esteem
which had suffered when he accepted the clothing.</p>

<p>My proper move in this affair was to receive the dollar&mdash;
and without making too much fuss about it, which would have been
equivalent to saying that I was amazed to find such nobility in a
man who looked so crooked. Had I merely thanked him respectfully
for the money, in the same way I might have thanked my neighbour
for restoring something I had lost, my dealings with him would
have been perfect. He would have had the clothes, and the
consciousness that he had also my esteem, which might have meant
a great deal more to him&mdash;at that stage of his unfortunate
experiences&mdash;than the clothes. There's a lot of very
careless, thoughtless, injurious charity. It takes more brains to
give something away than to sell it.</p>

<p>I let Tim Watson do anything he wanted to try to do, about the
apartment. He dusted all of my books, he cleaned and refilled my
pens, he answered the telephone with all the dignity of an
experienced butler. You would have thought he was in the employ
of some very important person. This may sound silly, but I think
Tim did me and my professional standing a great deal of good on
the telephone&mdash;even if my young colleagues at the hospital
did tease me about it.</p>

<p>"This is Doctor Wayne Hudson's residence."... "May I ask who
is speaking, please?"... "Thank you. I shall see if the doctor is
at liberty to come to the telephone."</p>

<p>I know that Tim's technique was ever so much better than mine.
I had been in the habit of scurrying to the telephone and saying,
"Hullo." Tim cured me permanently of that careless, self-damaging
method of answering a telephone call. It seemed to please him
greatly when I thanked him for the favour. I think he grew a
couple of inches. He replied, tactfully, that "a scientific man,
with lots of important things on his mind, couldn't pay much
attention to such small matters."</p>

<p>It did Tim a vast amount of good to contrive an apology for me
that would save my face.</p>

<p>Soon I discovered that it was one of the most fascinating
games I had ever played&mdash;this casting about for occasions
which might build Tim up. And I think that his gratifying
response to my constructive efforts in his behalf assured me that
any sacrifice I might have to make for him would be
justified.</p>

<p>It delighted me to see that what I was doing for Tim had not
only done his personality no damage, but was rapidly calling out
good talents which he had never been given a chance to
exercise.</p>

<p>Little Joyce helped, too. She immediately became devoted to
him. If she needed any spoiling, at that early period of her
life&mdash;which I can't believe possible&mdash;Tim slavishly
attended to it; and the undisguised affection she showered upon
him must have made him feel exalted. Sometimes a man will get
much the same quality of spiritual uplift from his dog. Dogs make
good evangelists because they overlook so many obvious
imperfections. One can't say as much for cats, who seem to have
no capacity for concealing their contempt.</p> <hr>

<h2>BRIGHTWOOD HOSPITAL<br> <i>November twenty-fifth, 1913, 10.30
p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">NANCY ASHFORD and I have been holding an
informal conference in my office for the past hour. Sometimes I
wonder how I could get along without her uncommonly wise counsel.
I'm afraid I have come to take Nancy too much for granted. If
anything were to happen to her, I might find out how heavily I
had depended on her business efficiency and loyal
comradeship.</p>

<p>The past few days have been exceptionally trying. I should not
have thought it possible for a nine-year-old child to stir up so
much excitement. It seems clear enough now that a public school
is no place for Joyce; at least, not yet. So we have gone back to
the nurse-governess idea. Nancy found the new teacher&mdash;a
Miss Wingate&mdash;who gives promise of being a good choice. She
is considerate but she will be firm. She is well-balanced and has
the instincts of a lady. Joyce likes her&mdash;so far. One has to
make allowances for my child's wilfulness and instability. We
have had too many different types of people working on this job.
But I couldn't be both father and mother.</p>

<p>It has often struck me as a peculiar thing that so many
people, who have been able to redirect and improve the lives of
comparative strangers, are helpless when they try to do something
beneficial for their own flesh and blood.</p>

<p>I raised this question with Nancy to-night, and she offered an
explanation. Persons living restless, unhappy, undisciplined
lives are so because they are in a battle with themselves. Their
conscience gets after them for their misdemeanours, and shames
them until they resent any counsel from their "censor mind."
Nancy thinks it a fallacy to believe that conscience is always a
wise counsellor. She holds that a conscience is just as likely to
be defective as a thyroid gland. That is to say, an over-active
thyroid can throw one's whole emotional machinery out of balance;
and an over-zealous conscience can be so brutally intolerant and
tactless that it destroys what little self-esteem you have left,
after committing some indiscretion.</p>

<p>I couldn't help showing my amusement over this fantastic
theory, but Nancy stood by her guns.</p>

<p>"That's why some children resent parental advice," she
continued. "They are constantly besieged by an abnormally
energetic conscience; and they are so integrally blood-related to
their parents, and have so many quirks and kinks in common, that
father's admonition is just another annoying harangue of the sort
that the conscience delivers."</p>

<p>"I gather, then," said I, "that a child's unwillingness to
heed her father's advice is not because she lacks a
conscience&mdash;but has too much of it"; and then added, "Nancy,
sometimes you have the foolest ideas&mdash;but I'll admit they
satisfy, even when they haven't a leg to stand on."</p>

<p>"I'd rather hold on to a legless idea that had the makings of
consolation in it," she replied, "than a sound idea that makes
you unhappy."</p>

<p>"But you have given up Santa Claus," I drawled.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and that was a mistake. I was much happier when I
believed in Santa Claus," she said, pensively, "&mdash;and
better, too."</p>

<p>"You couldn't be any better than you are, Nancy," I said. "I
never knew anyone with a sweeter soul."</p>

<p>She shook her head a little, smiled, rose, said "Good night,"
and closed the door softly behind her. That's the way it always
is when I express some appreciation: Nancy thinks of an errand
she has to do without delay.</p>

<p>I wish I could obey the dictates of my own heart. Maybe Nancy
shares that wish. We have never discussed it. She is absolutely
indispensable to this hospital. She is its brain and soul. She
has an important ministry here. Everybody leans on her; the
staff, the nurses, the patients. I have no right to disrupt this
relationship. Sometimes I have almost permitted my desires to get
the better of me in this matter. I think I know how she feels.
Perhaps I could break her down and override her convictions about
her clearly appointed duty. If I told Nancy that I needed her
more than Brightwood, she might agree; but she would never be
happy about it&mdash;and neither would I.</p>

<p>Once, a couple of years ago&mdash;we were still down in the
old building in Cadillac Square&mdash;she came into my office
with an open telegram in her hand and the tears running down her
cheeks. Her father was dead. I impulsively drew her into my arms
and she pressed her forehead hard against my white coat; then
laid her cheek against my heart and clung to me tightly for a
long moment. I was much moved. Presently she released herself,
glanced up, dabbed at the corners of my eyes with her
handkerchief&mdash;an act very like the one she had performed
almost every day in the operating-room when she was a surgical
nurse and would wipe the perspiration from my face&mdash;and
said, softly, "Thanks&mdash;for the tears." But there has never
been a repetition of such mutual affection, and it has not always
been easy to be restrained.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">On several occasions I have observed that it has
been comparatively easy to finance an investment in somebody
else, when it would have been difficult to do as much for myself.
I do not pretend to understand this; much less explain it. I
simply state it as a fact, and you may appraise it for whatever
it seems to be worth.</p>

<p>On the tenth day of September, 1905, I was so hard up that it
was doubtful whether I could pay the month's current bills in
full; yet, on that day, I decided to make arrangements for Tim
Watson to enter the university at my expense.</p>

<p>I sold the Cadillac for seven hundred dollars, a good price.
The car had cost a great deal more, but that was all it was worth
now, and I was lucky to get that much. It would be a long haul to
sponsor Watson through college and the medical school. And I
wouldn't have a car to fetch to market every September. But I was
ready to take the risk, and see what came of it.</p>

<p>I asked for the next day off, and went to Ann Arbor. Everybody
was gracious and co-operative. I engaged a room for Tim, and
found a place where he could work for his board; had a conference
with the Registrar; even had the audacity to call on President
Angell, and came away feeling that I amounted to something. It
was a great day for me. When I walked down to the station to take
the train home, I wore a broad smile. People whom I passed gave
me a second look, and sometimes they grinned. I remembered what
Randolph had said about his own sensations. He had declared that
the grass was greener, the sky bluer. It was a fact! One became
acutely conscious of the birds. All colours were more vivid. The
people on the street seemed more friendly, more alive. I had done
something to myself: there was no doubt of that.</p>

<p>I had not told anyone where I was going. During the day,
several calls had come in at the house inquiring for me, and were
informed that I was at the hospital, and called back to say I was
not there. Tim was getting anxious. I found him pacing the
pavement in front of the apartment house when I arrived at
seven.</p>

<p>"Hope I haven't worried you," I said. "I have been to Ann
Arbor, arranging for you to enter college, a week from Wednesday.
It's all settled&mdash;your pre-medic course."</p>

<p>Tim said nothing. He seemed stunned. He held his red head on
one side, quizzically, staring at me with a stupefied incredulity
that made me laugh. I led the way in, and he followed me like a
sleep-walker. We went up to the apartment where the middle-aged
maid met us saying that dinner was ready and drying up.</p>

<p>*lf you'll excuse me," mumbled Tim, "I don't want any." He
went to his little room and shut the door.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with him?" asked Lizzie, grimly.</p>

<p>"He'll be all right," I said. "Keep something warm for
him."</p>

<p>About nine o'clock he came into our small living-room and sat
down close beside me.</p>

<p>"Doctor Hudson&mdash;" he began, nervously.</p>

<p>"Don't try to make a speech, Tim," I interposed. "You're going
to be a doctor; and doctors aren't often very good speech-makers.
I know how you feel. You are very happy&mdash;and so am I. I have
never been this happy before."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," gulped Tim.</p>

<p>"I know you will," I declared. "Now&mdash;I want you to
promise me that you will never tell this to a living soul. It is
nobody's business but ours how you got a chance to go to the
university. It is our secret. I have a reason&mdash;and a very
good one&mdash;for wanting this to remain private. Will you
promise?"</p>

<p>Tim promised&mdash;and we shook hands on it.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Two Sundays elapsed before I went out to see
Randolph again. I had phoned what time I would be there and he
was waiting for me at the gate. I had gone out on a street-car,
getting off at the nearest point, two blocks away.</p>

<p>"I see you're afoot," said Randolph, extending his hand. "Car
laid up?"</p>

<p>"Sold it," I said, casually. "Hadn't much use for it.
Street-cars go everywhere and are less expensive."</p>

<p>It was too chilly to have supper on the lawn. A table had been
set up in the living-room near the fireplace. The maid was off
duty and Natalie served us. I had not noticed before how rapidly
the girl was blossoming into a young woman. She was becoming very
pretty.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, when Natalie had supper with us, she made no
effort to participate in the conversation and excused herself
promptly when the coffee came on. To-night she was willing to
talk. Randolph seemed surprised and pleased. I drew her out, and
she chattered about her school, her teachers, and the thrill she
was having&mdash;every afternoon&mdash;at a riding academy. It
was her first close acquaintance with horses, and she was having
the time of her young life. Natalie seemed a different person.
She had never before paid me the compliment of showing the
slightest interest in me. Now she looked me squarely in the eyes
and talked animatedly, as if we were long-time comrades and
contemporaries.</p>

<p>When she left us, for a moment, to bring on the salad,
Randolph chuckled a little, and said, "I don't know what you've
done to Natalie."</p>

<p>"She's a charming girl," I said. "I'm glad she wanted to
talk."</p>

<p>"I think," said Randolph, slowly, "she has just discovered
something in you that she had not recognized before; a high
capacity for friendship, maybe."</p>

<p>It was a delightful evening. Natalie went to her own room,
about ten, shaking hands with me before she left and saying, very
prettily, that I must come again soon. I was much stirred and a
little bewildered, too, over this unaccustomed attention.</p>

<p>Randolph and I discussed almost everything of current
interest. I surprised myself by taking the lead in most of our
conversation. When I rose to go, he said, "You're in uncommonly
high spirits to-night, Hudson. Perhaps your work at the hospital
is growing more pleasant."</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied. "I have really enjoyed it, lately."</p>

<p>Randolph looked me steadily in the eyes and drew a sly smile,
accompanied by a slow wink.</p>

<p>I grinned, in spite of my effort to be poker-faced. He reached
out his hand and I took it. He laid his other hand on our warm
clasp and affectionately patted my fingers.</p>

<p>"I am very happy for you, my friend," he said, softly. "It is
easy to see that life has taken on a new meaning for you."</p>

<p>And that was true. I had begun to live!</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Perhaps I have been tedious in my presentation
of the circumstances which preceded my operation on Natalie
Randolph's head; but, to an understanding of my state of mind in
that event, it is important that you shall have had the whole
situation laid before you.</p>

<p>The investment I had made in Tim Watson might or might not be
the making of him: but it had already begun to appear that it was
going to be the making of me.</p>

<p>My relation to the hospital changed, almost overnight. The new
vigour I felt within myself must have shown through, for not only
did I approach my tasks with an entirely different attitude, but
it was easy to see that the personnel of the hospital had noted
the change in me. These observations were, for the most part,
inarticulate, but they were certified to in various ways. By some
I was regarded with wide-eyed curiosity; by others with unusual
displays of personal interest and friendship.</p>

<p>On the following Wednesday morning, Doctor Shafter, who was
then considered the best brain surgeon in town, asked me if I
would assist him in an operation that afternoon. I replied that I
should like to, but that I was on duty in the Free Clinic. Within
a half hour. Doctor Means&mdash;our superintendent&mdash;sent
word that I was to be relieved at the Clinic so that I might be
with Doctor Shafter. I felt very proud of this assignment.
Incidentally, I was never sent to the Free Clinic again.</p>

<p>It would be difficult for me to explain what were the outward
manifestations of my new relation to life and work. Perhaps my
recognition of this new and vital force had found immediate
expression in my manner and behaviour. The old indifference was
gone. I had acquired&mdash;without conscious effort&mdash;a
confident stride, a more erect carriage, a capacity for making
every motion count. The thing&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;had
actually deepened my voice and given it a new resonance. When I
gave an order, people hustled; not as if they were scared, but
anxious to serve.</p>

<p>However much my colleagues and the nurses may have been
bewildered over my strange metamorphosis, they weren't any more
bewildered than I was. Crusty old Pyle came the nearest to
voicing what must have been the general consensus about my case
when he stopped me in the corridor long enough to remark, dryly,
"They say that even a blind pig will find an acorn once in a
while. Congratulations!"</p>

<p>Natalie Randolph was brought into the hospital at four-thirty
in the afternoon of November twenty-seventh. She had been thrown
from a horse, striking her head on the hard asphalt pavement. The
nearest available physician&mdash;a Doctor Juniper (since
deceased)&mdash;had made a hasty examination and prompt
arrangements with the hospital. The ambulance made a quick trip.
Doctor Means, locating me by telephone in the Men's Surgical,
told me of the accident and said that Mr. Randolph wished me to
be on hand when Natalie arrived.</p>

<p>She was quite a pathetic little figure in her trim riding
habit. Her face was scratched and already purplish; her
corn-yellow curls were matted and stained with blood. Frequently,
in such cases, there is a brief revival of consciousness before
the coma settles in; but Natalie had not roused. Her respiration
was irrhythmic, almost undetectable in its declensions. The
injury was a compound parietal fracture, the deepest one I had
ever seen.</p>

<p>My afflicted friend Randolph hovered close to the table. His
face was ghastly white but he had himself well in hand.</p>

<p>"How about it?" he whispered. I shook my head, and told him it
looked very bad. "But you'll do something; won't you?" he asked,
desperately.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not immediately," I replied. It was going to be hard
to tell Randolph the truth.</p>

<p>Doctor Means, assuming that Doctor Shafter would be called in,
had telephoned his house immediately upon hearing of the
accident, only to learn that the surgeon was on a train <i>en
route</i> for Chicago where he was to spend the next
day&mdash;Thanksgiving&mdash;with his daughter.</p>

<p>But after a brief consultation it was agreed that an operation
was impractical.</p>

<p>"I don't think Shafter would touch it," muttered Pyle. Then he
turned to Randolph and said, "I'm afraid there is very little to
be done here, sir."</p>

<p>Randolph clutched at my sleeve and tugged me a little way
apart.</p>

<p>"Hudson," he whispered, "will you try? I know that some
life-giving energy has come to you, lately. Perhaps you will be
able to accomplish a great act here. I trust you completely. May
I tell them that you will operate, at my request?"</p>

<p>It was a terrific responsibility, and for a moment I was at a
loss for words. I wondered what my elders and betters would think
of my audacity if I consented to attempt something that even the
experienced Shafter&mdash;in Pyle's opinion&mdash;would not
venture upon. While I debated this serious problem, Randolph
stepped back into the group about the table and announced, in a
firm voice, "Gentlemen, I have asked Doctor Hudson to operate."
Nobody looked up. I could feel their reaction.</p>

<p>Doubtless if Natalie had been less gravely hurt, there might
have been further deliberation; perhaps a suggestion that we had
better wait until Shafter could be returned; perhaps a protest
from Pyle that it wouldn't be fair to commit so difficult a task
to a young surgeon with no more experience than I had had in the
repair of head injuries. But no one protested. In this case it
really made very little difference what was done or by whom.</p>

<p>Pyle's only comment to me was, "It's too bad, my boy, that you
are expected to do this. But we all know the circumstances, and
we'll see to it that it does you no damage. Mr. Randolph thinks
you can do it, and his wishes should be served. You haven't the
ghost of a chance, but Randolph will have the satisfaction of
knowing that an attempt was made."</p>

<p>I consented to try, but decided to wait a few hours until we
had suppressed the haemorrhage by introducing a hypertonic
solution. It was almost three o'clock in the morning before I
felt that the surgery might be attempted.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, my hope began to mount from the moment I
started the operation. Perhaps it was Randolph's amazing faith
that I could do it; perhaps my awareness of the new strength I
had lately found gave me confidence. It surprised and delighted
me to find myself working with steady hands, and not a trace of
nervousness. And when, at last, I made the final suture, I had a
feeling that Natalie might recover. I went to Randolph, as soon
as I had washed up. He was keenly anxious, but bright with
hope.</p>

<p>"You have saved her&mdash;I think," he said, questing my eyes
for assurance.</p>

<p>"We must wait&mdash;and see," I replied, prudently; but
Randolph knew, by my tone, that I was not disheartened. He wrung
my hand, and murmured, "God bless you!"</p>

<p>If you are interested in the history of this case, from a
professional standpoint, you will find it fully documented in the
<i>Medical Encyclopaedia</i> (edition of 1907). You will note
that this was the first occasion when depressed fragments of bone
were approached by a rongeur through a burr-hole opening in the
adjacent normal skull. This technique is quite common practice
now, but it had never been tried before. And it wouldn't have
been attempted then if the case had been less desperate.</p>

<p>It was indeed a very close thing&mdash;our saving Natalie. And
the operation was by no means the end of our dilemma. We had a
post-traumatic haematoma on our hands that required the most
vigilant watching and care for the next three weeks. But Natalie
slowly recovered. Her appreciation of my solicitude was very
sweet, and our friendship became one of the most precious
experiences of my life.</p>

<p>One night in early February&mdash;we had taken her home that
day&mdash;Randolph said, "You remember, Wayne, my telling you of
my earliest experiment in sculpture, and my earnest
request&mdash;to Somebody or Something Outside&mdash;for a chance
to do just one creditable piece of statuary?"</p>

<p>I remembered&mdash;and thought I knew what he was leading up
to.</p>

<p>"Now you have had your big chance," he continued, "to do a
monumental thing in brain surgery. It has already directed
attention to you. You will have many opportunities, in the
future, to test your faith as well as your skill. Never forget
how you came by it. Don't ever let yourself believe, when you
have become eminent as a brain surgeon, that this new technique
you hit upon in Natalie's case was something that you invented in
a time of emergency. <i>I say it was handed to you&mdash;from the
Outside!</i>"</p>

<p>"I believe that," I said, sincerely. "I don't understand it;
but I believe it."</p>

<p>And I still believe it.</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>February eighth, 1914, 9 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">YOU will observe, my friend, that some time has
elapsed since the last entry was made in this journal. The
interruption has not been due to negligence, but indecision
whether to continue.</p>

<p>As I stated, at the outset, the purpose of these memoirs was
to give my reader&mdash;whoever he might be&mdash;a glimpse of
the cause-and-effect relationship between private investments in
other people's upbuilding, and the rewards of such investments
accruing to the donor and empowering him to accomplish things
otherwise impossible.</p>

<p>I wanted to go on record with my belief, arrived at by
experience, that if an act of human rehabilitation is secretly
wrought, the development is manifest not only in the life of the
beneficiary but the benefactor. In other words, if I do something
for you that builds you up for increased usefulness, my own
capacity is augmented by that much. I do not mean that if I do
something of value for you on Thursday I may expect to exercise
some new power by Saturday at the latest; for this thing doesn't
always operate on a cash-and-carry basis. But I do
insist&mdash;and I have consistently demonstrated this to my own
satisfaction&mdash;that you cannot add to another's personal
power without increasing your own.</p>

<p>Having finished my narration of the peculiar experiences of
1905 when, under the direction of Clive Randolph, I tested this
theory and found a new and promising way of life, it occurred to
me that either I had made my case&mdash;in the opinion of my
reader&mdash;or would be unable to do so, no matter how much
additional evidence was piled up. I debated whether it would
serve any good purpose to offer more testimony of the same
sort.</p>

<p>But something has happened lately which throws light on this
subject from another angle. I think you should have your
attention called to it.</p>

<p>In my previous entries, I have tried to give you a brief but
fairly comprehensive account of my own adventures in this strange
field. I want now to tell you what little I know&mdash;knowledge
achieved mostly by deduction and guessing&mdash;concerning
another person's experience in self-investment. You will note, as
you proceed, that there are a couple of open gaps in this story
of Dorothy Wickes which will never be filled in. At these
intervals you are at liberty to exercise your own imagination as
I have exercised mine.</p>

<p>And now that I have decided to resume work on this journal,
perhaps it will be well if I carry on a little farther with some
of my experiences subsequent to the operation on Natalie
Randolph, an event that promptly gave me a new rating in my
profession and set me going toward a larger success than I had
dreamed of.</p>

<p>It may interest you to learn something more about Tim Watson
and his reaction to college life. It is quite possible that you
may be acquainted with Watson. Indeed it is possible that Tim may
be reading these words himself. If so, he will suffer no chagrin
in perusing my report of him; for, from the very first, it was
evident that this loyal young fellow meant business. His marks
were exceptionally good&mdash;better, on the whole, than my own
grades in college&mdash;and his conduct, so far as I know, was
above reproach. I was never given one minute's anxiety about
him.</p>

<p>At the close of his freshman year, he returned to Detroit,
found a job in the Olds Motor Works, where he was quick to learn,
made good wages, and saved his money like a miser. When it was
time for him to go back to school in September, while he did not
have quite enough cash to see him through the entire year, it was
unnecessary for me to do very much for him; though by that time I
was able to aid him without making any sacrifice. I had
discontinued work in the field of general surgery, and was giving
full attention to diseases and injuries of the brain. Patients,
in increasing numbers, were being referred to me from
considerable distances. Sometimes they were brought into the
hospital; sometimes I made long trips. Brain surgery is not the
most pleasant vocation in the world. You do very well if you can
hold your mortality down to fifty per cent. Most of the cases
that recover have a long and tedious convalescence, the patient
growing more crotchety and fretful every day. I mention this only
because the burden rested heavily on me, and I was very thankful
to sense the increasing devotion of Tim Watson.</p>

<p>I had not altered my habits of living, to any appreciable
extent. We had moved to a more commodious apartment, had found
more efficient household help, and I had bought another car.
Otherwise, our manner of life had not been affected by the
improvement in my income. It would have been impossible for Tim
not to observe that I was now in a position to make things easier
for him, but there never was the slightest hint that he would
lean on me. Quite to the contrary, he began mothering me in a
manner that was a bit embarrassing at times. He was so solicitous
of my comfort that I began to feel quite elderly in his company,
though there were but fifteen years between us. One evening, in
summer, when he had dragged a big chair across the room for me,
so that I might read under what he thought was a better light, I
said, rather testily, I fear, "Damn it; you don't have to fag for
me as if I were a hundred!"</p>

<p>"I like to do little favours for you," said Tim. "It isn't
that I think you're old. Certainly I wouldn't think that after
yesterday."</p>

<p>The day before, I had come off with some kudos in an aquatic
tournament&mdash;my chief recreation was had in the
water&mdash;and Tim had been much impressed.</p>

<p>His affectionate comment made me feel quite contrite; and, if
anything, a bit older.</p>

<p>I had occasion to be very proud of him. In 1908, he graduated
with a <i>cum laude</i>. His courses, during the Junior and
Senior years, were definitely pre-medic, leaving him only two
more years to do in the Medical College after achieving his A.B.
I took Joyce along with me to the Commencement exercises. He led
the child about, afterward, showing her off to his friends. She
was very pretty. I was proud of them both. Tim deferentially
asked permission to take Joyce with him to luncheon when he
learned I had been invited to lunch with a half-dozen of my
professional colleagues. He did this in the presence of my
learned friends, and his filial attitude&mdash;plus the fact that
when he left with Joyce he addressed her as "sister"&mdash;evoked
a natural curiosity which I ventured to appease by remarking,
dryly, "This young man is not my son, gentlemen. He is my
grandson."</p>

<p>Of course I have always felt sure that it was my investment in
Tim&mdash;at a time when the expense of it was
considerable&mdash;that put me in a state of mind to work at my
job with the highest possible efficiency. The investment had been
amply justified. It had paid out handsomely. Now that it was
reasonably clear that Tim was going to be a success, my
satisfaction was complete.</p>

<p>He wanted me to get him a job, that vacation, as an orderly in
the hospital, or an ambulance driver, or almost any sort of
labour that would keep him in the hospital atmosphere with which
he had become somewhat familiar; but I wouldn't consent to
it.</p>

<p>"You will probably be back here as an interne after you have
finished with the Medical School," I said, "and it will be much
better for you if the nurses haven't made your previous
acquaintance by ordering you to empty the slop."</p>

<p>"But I shouldn't mind that," he replied. "If an orderly does
his job efficiently and obediently, he ought to be
respected."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," I agreed, impatiently, "and so he is. But the
orderly defines his position, in relation to other natural
objects, and he mustn't try to come back later as a doctor."</p>

<p>Tim nodded, not very enthusiastically, and said he supposed I
was right. But I could see there was something on his mind that
needed release, so I said, "Well&mdash;what's the rest of it? Go
on."</p>

<p>"It's about this caste idea," said Tim, feeling his way. "I
don't like it. From what I hear and see, there's too much of it
in the medical profession; experienced nurses doing the wrong
thing, and knowing they're doing the wrong thing, simply to obey
a bad order that some doctor has issued through ignorance or
mistake; and aware that it's doing the patient harm. Everybody
afraid of everybody else, all the way up the line, from the man
with the mop to the man with the scalpel, including the student
nurses, who are afraid of the graduate nurses, and the graduate
nurses, who are afraid of the superintendent of nurses, who is
afraid of the interns, who are afraid of the older doctors. It's
the bunk! It's a crime!" Tim's long speech had grown a bit shrill
toward the end.</p>

<p>I tried to explain that while there were probably occasional
unfortunate occurrences connected with hospital discipline, in
the long run it was better for everybody to understand the limits
of his own authority and initiative. Otherwise, everything would
be on the loose, with nobody in particular responsible for what
happened.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see that," agreed Tim. "But I also see a lot of red
tape that doesn't do anybody a service. I'd like to see a
hospital proceed on the theory that it's there to accommodate the
patients rather than the doctors and the nurses. I've been
looking into this thing a little, and asking questions. In most
of the hospitals, the business office is entirely too fussy. A
patient comes in sick as a dog and deserving every consideration,
but the business office has to devil the life out of the fellow
with questions that have no immediate bearing on his case and
could be asked, just as well, a week later; and all this cruel
nonsense practiced to accommodate some brittle little clerk who
wants to keep his index-card system in order."</p>

<p>"I don't believe they do much of that in our hospital," I
protested. "I'd look into it&mdash;if it was any of my business.
I'm not on that end of the machine."</p>

<p>Tim stood up and waved a long arm, energetically.</p>

<p>"There you are!" he shouted. "That's what I mean!"</p>

<p>I couldn't help being amused over the youngster's indignation.
It wasn't like Tim to pop off like that; so I knew the matter
went pretty deep with him. I told him I thought he was on the
right track, to have the patient's welfare at heart. I also
promised to ask a few questions, quietly, in our hospital.</p>

<p>As a result of that investigation, which I pursued
deliberately for a month or more&mdash;considerably to my
dismay&mdash; I began to nourish the idea of a private hospital
in which common-sense discipline would take precedence over a
growing tendency to mechanize the healing arts. It was for this
reason that we organized Brightwood, and I have Tim to thank for
unwittingly launching a project that has been a great
satisfaction to us all. I realize that the disciplinary measures
which are required in a very large hospital have to be more
exacting than in a small one. But when I discovered that patients
were roused at five a.m., from a deep sleep, to give some student
nurse a chance to practice reading her clinical thermometer, I
resolved to lay plans for the establishment of Brightwood.</p>

<p>Tim again spent the summer working in the automobile factory
where he had been employed before. He must have been rather good
at it, for his wages were excellent. I often wondered, through
those days, whether he wasn't tempted a little to carry on in
that game; for it was the coming profession, if a man wanted to
make money; incomparably more promising, in that respect, than
the practice of medicine.</p>

<p>It gratified me that he wanted to be with me as much as
possible week-ends. I found him increasingly companionable. A
couple of times I took him with me on Sunday evenings at the
Randolphs. He and Natalie were immensely congenial. I rather
thought&mdash;and hoped&mdash;that he would make an effort to
cultivate that friendship, for it was easy to see that the girl
had attracted him. So far as I know, he made no attempt to enlist
her interest in him. But I nourished the hope that something
might come of it later.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">One of my earliest cases at Brightwood was a
brain tumour operation on a Mr. James Wickes. They were poor
people, Wickes having been out of employment for more than a year
in consequence of his illness. There was a twenty-two-year-old
son, also unemployed, for some unspecified reason. Accompanying
the sick man to the hospital was his wife, a discouraged,
taciturn little mouse, and a daughter Dorothy who was eighteen,
bright, and uncommonly attractive. Her clothes were of
inexpensive stuff but modishly cut and she wore them with
confidence.</p>

<p>They made no bones about their poverty.</p>

<p>"My daughter is the only one working now," explained Mrs.
Wickes, nervously. "Fifteen dollars a week&mdash;in a store. And
I must say she is a good girl. She gives us all of it, she does."
My glance wandered over Dorothy's stylishly made ensemble, and
Mrs. Wickes defensively added, "She makes all her own
clothes."</p>

<p>I reassured them about the financial problem, told them there
was a fund available for hospitalization; that there would be no
charge for surgery, if an operation were required. After a few
days' observation, it was evident that the patient had a very
slim chance. The case was operable, but practically hopeless.
Dorothy had come alone, that Sunday afternoon. I took her into my
office and told her that while I intended to operate, the next
morning, I seriously doubted whether I could save him. She was
grieved, but not surprised. I drew a little diagram for her,
outlining the appallingly large area involved. She drew her chair
closer to my desk and seemed avidly interested in the
pencil-sketch.</p>

<p>"Can you draw?" she inquired. Her blue eyes were wet, but they
lighted as she asked the irrelevant question.</p>

<p>"That much," I admitted, with a shrug. "Can you?"</p>

<p>She nodded, confidently.</p>

<p>"I have had no chance to take lessons," she said, "But I can
draw."</p>

<p>It seemed to me that the conversation had taken rather an odd
turn, in view of the fact that I had been doing a rough sketch to
show the girl how little hope I could offer that her father might
survive. And then it occurred to me that Dorothy had been casting
about for something she might do to earn the money required by
her father's hospitalization. If that was it, I reflected, her
attitude deserved encouragement,</p>

<p>"What sort of things do you draw?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Boats," she answered, decisively.</p>

<p>"Just boats?"</p>

<p>"Boats and docks&mdash;and that's the trouble. I can't draw
boats well enough to hope ever to sell a picture. Maybe, if I
knew the principles of drawing, I could get a job as a dress
designer. I have ideas for dresses, and I believe I could make
some money that way."</p>

<p>"I should like to see your sketches sometime," I said,
non-committally. "You tell your mother what I have told you.
Don't upset her with a report that this is definitely hopeless,
but give her warning." I rose, and Dorothy considered herself
dismissed. That was about three-thirty. At five, she was back at
the hospital. The girl at the information desk, remembering that
she had called earlier, told her to go into my office and sit
down. I found her there, waiting for me.</p>

<p>"You said you wanted to see some of my drawings," explained
Dorothy, laying a portfolio before me.</p>

<p>"But I didn't mean to cause you a special trip," I
protested.</p>

<p>She drew out a marine sketch and held it up. I had seen wetter
water in pictures, but it was obvious that the girl was a keen
observer and had talent. The shadows of the ropes and spars
rippled in rhythm with the choppy swells of the breeze-swept
harbour. It wasn't a great picture, but it held out great
promise.</p>

<p>"Did you draw that?" I inquired. She nodded. "Didn't copy it?"
I asked. "Sketched it from life?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Doctor. Is it any good?"</p>

<p>"Good? Of course it's good!"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Well&mdash;we had to let James Wickes go from
the hospital to a mortuary, as I had ruefully anticipated;
though, had he lived, I suspect that his survival would have been
of small satisfaction to himself and his family. The next few
days were so heavily weighted with serious duties that I had but
little time to think about the Wickes family. On the next Sunday
afternoon at five, when I was about through with the day's work,
I found Dorothy waiting for me, just outside my office door. I
invited her to come in. She sat down on the edge of her chair and
tugged nervously at her gloves.</p>

<p>"It's about one of my girl friends in the store," she began,
without preamble. "I'm so dreadfully sorry for her. She is almost
crazy with worry. I want to ask your advice."</p>

<p>"Is this what I'm afraid it is?" I asked.</p>

<p>Dorothy nodded, and flushed a little. "But she's a very nice
girl&mdash;just the same," she declared loyally.</p>

<p>"Not you&mdash;by any chance," I suggested, looking her
squarely in the eyes. But the eyes did not flinch. She shook her
head. "That's good," I said. "I believe you. Well&mdash;go on.
Tell me anything you want me to know; though I hope you're not
going to ask me to think of a quick way out of this for your
friend, because I am quite definitely not in that line of
business."</p>

<p>"N-no&mdash;I wasn't going to ask that, exactly," said Dorothy
reluctantly, "though of course it would be just awfully sweet of
you."[1]</p>

<p class="footnote">[1] Among Doctor Hudson's papers I found the
notes of an address he had delivered before the State Medical
Association on March 9, 1914, the subject of which may have been
inspired by this conversation. In his address. Doctor Hudson
states it is his belief that many young persons, confronted by
this problem, do not always realize the gravity of their efforts
to escape from their desperate predicament. They cannot see
farther than the immediate threat of disgrace. Doctor Hudson
advised that when a medical man is approached on this matter by
people half-insane with worry, instead of treating them with cold
anger, it would be to his credit if he viewed the circumstances
in a spirit of sympathetic understanding, and tried to suggest
some ethical procedure which would not only safeguard the life of
an unborn child but shield the mother from a ruinous collapse of
personality. This is, I think, an interesting side-light on the
man's nobility; and on his courage also, for this is a ticklish
subject. (R. M.)</p>

<p>I couldn't help grinning, though I suppose I should have been
indignant. She was as transparent as glass, with no more
realization of her unpleasant implications than a
six-year-old.</p>

<p>"No," I reiterated, firmly. "Sometimes these cases are very
sad, indeed; but&mdash;there's nothing we can do about them."</p>

<p>"It's too bad," sighed Dorothy. "I read a story once about the
older sister of Jairus' daughter; you know, the little girl that
Jesus raised from the dead?"</p>

<p>I remembered the narrative, but said I hadn't recalled that
the child had an older sister.</p>

<p>"Not in the Bible, she didn't," agreed Dorothy, "but in this
story that I read. Shall I tell you&mdash;or haven't you
time?"</p>

<p>"Tell me&mdash;if it isn't too long."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;after Jesus had brought back the little girl to
life, he left the house and was on his way up the road and pretty
soon a beautiful young woman stepped out of the shrubbery and
asked if she could speak to him. So&mdash;they sat down, and she
told him that she loved a young Roman centurion, but her people
would not consent to their friendship&mdash;much less their
marriage. And now she was in trouble. And she would be disgraced;
likely driven from home.</p>

<p>" 'You gave my little sister her life back,' she said. 'Can't
you speak a word that will save mine?'" Dorothy paused.</p>

<p>"So&mdash;what did he do?" I inquired, with sincere
interest.</p>

<p>"The author of the story didn't say. He just stopped
there&mdash; and left you guessing&mdash;like in <i>The Lady or
the Tiger</i>."</p>

<p>I observed that it was a prudent way to finish the piece, even
if it did leave you a bit curious over the outcome. She nodded
agreement, and remarked that the problem must have put the Master
in an embarrassing position. "For he was always so kind and
helpful to everyone," she murmured, meditatively. Then, after a
little pause, she searched my eyes, and asked, "What do
<i>you</i> think he would have done?"</p>

<p>I glanced at my watch&mdash;an ignoble trick&mdash;and replied
that I shouldn't be impudent enough to make a decision for the
Lord; adding that perhaps we'd better proceed now with the main
story.</p>

<p>"Millie&mdash;that's my friend&mdash;" said Dorothy, settling
to her task, "&mdash;can't stay in the store very much longer.
And she can't stay at home much longer, either."</p>

<p>It was a fairly long narrative of a selfish aunt's too exigent
attentions. After Millie's mother had died and their home was
broken up, she had been taken in, at the age of twelve, by her
mother's sister Susan, a half-psychopathic woman of forty, with a
bare subsistence income, a lame foot, and a weak heart.</p>

<p>She was too sensitive about her lameness to venture out of the
house, except on short errands to the near-by grocery, and her
erratic heart was much on her mind. One of the first things
Millie had learned, upon coming to live with her, was that Aunt
Susan mustn't be upset.</p>

<p>Shy, reticent, and self-conscious. Aunt Susan lived the life
of a hermit, unsparing in her stifling affection for the unhappy
child, but dreading the intrusions of Millie's young friends. So
Millie gave up trying to entertain any of her girl companions;
and, when she was invited to parties. Aunt Susan was distressed
over what might happen to her ward. As Millie grew older, this
cruelly strict supervision became more and more galling. If she
was five minutes late in getting home from school, full
explanations were in order. Aunt Susan, sitting at a front
window, gnawing her thumbnail, would meet Millie at the door,
shrill and shaky and scared.</p>

<p>"And that's the way it went," continued Dorothy, "All through
her high-school days. She never had any fun. Sometimes we said,
'Come on! Let your old lady worry a little, if she wants to.' But
Millie couldn't risk a heart attack; and, anyhow, she wouldn't
have a good time, knowing that her Aunt Susan was hobbling about
through the house, half crazy with anxiety."</p>

<p>I nodded my understanding, and said, "Too much devotion."</p>

<p>"That has been the hard part of it," Dorothy agreed. "The good
old lady has simply strangled Millie with her love and kisses;
never lets her alone for a minute; fusses with her hair, pats her
on the cheek, stuffs her with home-made chocolates, insists on
reading aloud, in the evenings, the sappiest, sloppiest,
goody-goodiest stories, out of funny old books, about sweet and
obedient girls who took care of grandpa until he died of it.
And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And so Millie finally broke through the fence," I suggested,
feeling that I now had the picture fairly well in hand. "Any
chance of a marriage? That might help quite a bit."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he could stand it," doubted Dorothy. "He
would have to live there. Auntie's heart would go back on her if
Millie tried to make a home elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know about those hearts," I said, "the kind that
cave in whenever their custodians can't have their own way about
everything. There's an awful lot of heart disease that's just one
way of putting on a tantrum."</p>

<p>"They're really worse than tantrums," declared Dorothy.</p>

<p>"That's right," I agreed. "You can spank a tantrum&mdash;but
you're afraid to paddle a defective heart." We sat there in
silence for a minute; then I said, "I'm afraid Millie will have
to figure this out, herself. Perhaps her best course is for her
to make a clean breast of it to her Auntie."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Dorothy, regretfully, "but Aunt Susan
will have a fit."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, not very helpfully, "people have had
fits&mdash; and got over them. By the way&mdash;have you been
drawing any more pictures?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I think I should like to make a little investment in you," I
said. "Your boats are pretty good, and they would be ever so much
better if you had some lessons. And perhaps you would be able to
do one for me. I, too, am very fond of the water."</p>

<p>Her blue eyes widened and her pretty lips parted.</p>

<p>"Do you think I could&mdash;really?" she said, just above a
whisper.</p>

<p>"It's worth trying. I know a man who is well posted on local
art schools. I want you to go and see him. He will give you good
advice. I shall tell him to expect you."</p>

<p>"Now?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"When you get anything on your mind, you certainly don't waste
much time; do you?" I teased.</p>

<p>"But this is so important," "she replied soberly.</p>

<p>"Very well. I'll call him up. Perhaps he will be free to talk
to you this evening."</p>

<p>I stepped back into my private office, closed the door and
telephoned to Randolph, finding him at home as I had expected. I
told him I had been talking with a young woman who thought of
taking a course in drawing. Would he give her some counsel? Might
she come out to-night? I omitted to say that I had any further
interest than that in this art course.</p>

<p>"He will see you this evening," I announced to Dorothy,
writing Randolph's address on a card. "And now I have an urgent
request to make of you. You are not to tell Mr. Randolph that I
am having anything to do with this matter. I don't care what else
you tell him about yourself; but you're not to tell him
that."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I'd <i>like</i> to tell him," insisted Dorothy. "If
he is your good friend, wouldn't he be glad to know that you were
being kind to me? And what you did for us&mdash;about father,
too."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;maybe&mdash;but that's not the point. The point is
that I do not want this told. I don't want it told about your
father, either. I'm very particular about this. Tell your mother
never to talk about any of this&mdash;not even to her closest
friend."</p>

<p>"That's funny," said Dorothy, bewilderedly.</p>

<p>"It isn't funny, at all!" I replied, bluntly. "It is an
investment. And investments aren't funny. They may be foolish,
but they're never funny."</p>

<p>Dorothy blinked her long eyelashes a few times, and shook her
head a little, dizzily; then she said, "I hope you won't lose too
much by&mdash;by investing in me; but what about father?"</p>

<p>"Now don't worry me," I commanded, rising. "You're too young
to understand. I couldn't explain this to you, if I tried. You
wouldn't know what I was talking about."</p>

<p>"Maybe I'm not as dumb as I look," she said, smiling.</p>

<p>I was anxious for her to go now. I had had a long day, and
needed some relaxation. I opened the door for her.</p>

<p>"Of course you are!" I declared.</p>

<p>"I hope," she said, gently, extending her hand, "that I can
pay it all back, sometime. Doctor Hudson."</p>

<p>"That's all right." I waved a large overhand dismissal. "I
don't want any of it back; not a nickel of it; do you understand?
I'm expecting to make use of it."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;good-bye!" she said, dazedly, fingering her cheap
beads. Then she backed out through the door, regarding me with an
odd expression such as one sees sometimes on the faces of people
visiting a zoo.</p>

<p>Pyle came in, a few seconds later, and wanted to know what was
so funny.</p>

<p>I said, "You wouldn't think it was funny if I told you."</p>

<p>"Maybe not," he growled. "You aren't&mdash;may I venture to
inquire&mdash;losing your mind?"</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>February twelfth, 1914, 11 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">I HAVE just returned from the annual banquet of
the Lincoln Club where the commemorative speeches were, I
thought, a little better than usual; perhaps because they were
briefer.</p>

<p>One journeyman soothsayer predicted the early outlawry of war,
on the ground that with modem weapons available to all nations,
no one of them could resort to arms without ruining itself.</p>

<p>The nations, he deposed, had proved "again and again" that war
is a futile waste of men and property. I couldn't help feeling
that the good man's spirit was ever so much better than his
logic. Anything that has been proved "again and again" might have
to be proved yet again&mdash;and again. I sincerely hope that his
forecast is more sound than his reasoning.</p>

<p>Pyle arrived home from Munich yesterday. We have been taking
considerable interest at Brightwood in the rapid improvement of
X-ray apparatus; and Pyle was sent over&mdash;financed chiefly
(and not very enthusiastically) by Nick Merrick&mdash;to
investigate Lilienfeld's new adaptation of the hot cathode ray
tube. Strangely enough, while Pyle was abroad. Doctor Coolidge of
Schenectady perfected a tube that implements the ray much more
effectively. This amuses Merrick, who is intensely patriotic and
hoots at the idea that we have to inquire of Germany for the
latest tricks in applied science.</p>

<p>Pyle seems more than a little disturbed over what he thinks is
a dangerous interest in militarism over there. Of course, we have
had some inkling of this in the press, but Pyle says it has a
more sinister appearance in Berlin than it has when we read about
it over here. He thinks England is apprehensive.</p>

<p>But if our wiseacres, who talked at the dinner to-night, have
any notion of the seriousness of the situation in Europe, they
kept their frets nicely concealed. The general consensus seemed
to indicate that the world had beaten its spears into
pruning-hooks, and that lions and lambs may now frolic together
in a state of amity.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">You will recall that I had sent the Wickes girl
to Randolph for advice about lessons in drawing. I had
volunteered, without giving the matter any deliberation, to
finance this undertaking. It couldn't cost very much. The lessons
would probably be taken after Dorothy's working hours; in the
evening, perhaps. I was to learn more about that, presently.</p>

<p>At half-past ten, that Sunday night, Randolph called up to say
that my young friend had spent the evening there, and thanked me
for the privilege of her acquaintance. I chuckled a little over
this odd remark and assured him the thanks were all mine to
offer, adding, "Bright girl; don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Better than bright," declared Randolph. "She's got
something."</p>

<p>I waited a few seconds for him to add a few decorations to
this cryptic comment; and, when he didn't avail himself of the
opportunity, I inquired whether she had shown him her
sketches.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "&mdash;and a few glimpses of her
soul."</p>

<p>"Sounds as if you might have had a fairly serious
conversation," I remarked, with mounting curiosity.</p>

<p>"Same sort of conversation that you and I had, the first time
we met. Remember?"</p>

<p>"Of course. But this is quite interesting. I should have
supposed she would be too full of art talk to take much stock in
your personal investment theory."</p>

<p>"The two subjects," said Randolph, tutorially, "aren't so very
far apart. I told her how I happened to do the piece of memorial
statuary that gave me standing as a sculptor."</p>

<p>"And Miss Wickes wondered whether a brave experiment in secret
philanthropy might make a painter of her," I surmised. "Is that
it?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;she was mightily impressed. It seemed to me that
she caught the idea with remarkable promptness, almost as if she
had heard about it somewhere else." Randolph paused a moment, and
then asked, "You haven't been talking to her about it?"</p>

<p>"No. But Dorothy is a very intelligent young woman, and you
probably did a neat job of expounding your theory. She needn't
have heard it before. At least, she did not get it from me.
Well&mdash;did you arrive at any conclusions about the sort of
instruction she should have?"</p>

<p>"Tentatively&mdash;yes. There's nobody here who could do much
for her. The girl has an instinctive flair for movement,
composition, perspective. I shouldn't like to see her in the
hands of some schoolmasterish artist who might recommend a change
of technique. There's an authentic talent here that's far too
valuable to be fooled with. What she needs, above everything
else, is release from her job; a change of atmosphere;
association with gifted young people in some art colony, perhaps;
and the guidance of a teacher who will offer her inspiration and
encouragement rather than the mere bare bones of planes and
contours and&mdash; "</p>

<p>"Hi! Wait a minute! Hold everything!" I pleaded. "I'm in over
my head."</p>

<p>"So you are," agreed Randolph, apologetically. "I hadn't meant
to inflict so much trade-lingo on you. What it all boils down to
is that your friend needs emancipation, for a while, from
everything that distracts her mind. If she can raise the
money&mdash;we didn't talk about that&mdash;I think she should go
to one of the coasts and pursue her special interest, which seems
to be ships and wharves. She might go to California. A couple of
months might be sufficient to demonstrate what further study she
should do, and under what type of master."</p>

<p>"Thanks," I said, "for the attention you have given her. I
hope she can find some way to follow your advice."</p>

<p>I refilled my pipe, and walked about through the house, trying
to accommodate myself to this project. I got out my pencil and
added up a row of figures. The thing had sounded a little more
formidable than it really was. Say three months in California.
That's the travel expense and modest living costs. Then, there's
the equivalent of her wages at the store, which the family will
require. That isn't very much. The whole job might run to six
hundred and fifty dollars. Doubtless worth doing.</p>

<p>Dorothy called me up, the next evening, at dinner-time, to
inquire when she might see me. I told her to come at once to my
house.</p>

<p>She was somewhat flustered, when I showed her to a big chair
in my library, and her excitement accented her vitality. I had
thought her a very pretty girl, but had not credited her with as
much character as I now saw in her face. It was more mature than
I had thought.</p>

<p>For a while we discussed the suggestions Randolph had
offered.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," she said, "that this must seem to you more like
financing a nice vacation than a project to make a real artist of
me. It's so different from the plan you had in mind for me that I
shall not blame you if you don't think well of it."</p>

<p>I assured her that Mr. Randolph's opinion on such a matter as
this should have precedence over anything I might think, and
added that it seemed entirely reasonable to me.</p>

<p>She seemed very reluctant about accepting my proposal to cover
her wages at the store while she was gone, but consented when it
was pointed out that the whole proposition was otherwise
impracticable.</p>

<p>"Mr. Randolph's belief is," I reminded her, "that what you
need now is a period without drudgery and without care. But you
couldn't have a free mind if you had left your mother without
support."</p>

<p>Then I asked her if she had given any thought to the place she
might go to, and she shook her head. I thought this very odd. It
seemed to me that if somebody had made me a proposition of this
sort, I should have made haste to investigate travel literature,
consult maps, and secure data about the best locations for the
purpose.</p>

<p>"But you are decided on Southern California?" I said. She
smiled a little, nodded&mdash;but not very convincingly, I
thought. Then I began to put two and two together and thought I
would add them up and see what they totalled. "I suppose you will
be too much absorbed by your work, out there, to write to me," I
said, casually.</p>

<p>Her eyes brightened, quickly, as I went on.</p>

<p>"I don't think you should have any distracting obligations on
your mind&mdash;not even letter-writing. So&mdash;I shall not
feel bad if I do not hear from you until you are back home
again."</p>

<p>Dorothy was radiant. She said I was very considerate. She
hoped she could prove her gratitude, some day.</p>

<p>So&mdash;then I knew she wasn't going to California. She was
going to use this money for something else&mdash;and I thought I
knew what this something else was. Very well; if that's the way
it is, it is still a fine investment, I thought; a finer
investment than the other.</p>

<p>I moved over to my desk and wrote her a cheque for the full
amount I had felt would cover the project, and as I handed it to
her I said, "Now, I think this will do it. You need not make an
accounting to me. I don't care to have a detailed report. What we
are trying to do is to give you a chance to improve as an artist.
You are to spend this money as you like; whatever will contribute
to our hope for your success&mdash;that's what we want."</p>

<p>She drew a quick little sigh of combined relief and gratitude,
and said, softly, "Oh, thank you! I am so hopeful!"</p>

<p>At the door, I said, "I'll expect to see you, then, in
May."</p>

<p>"And I'll be thinking about you&mdash;and your wonderful
kindness," said Dorothy, holding on to my hand. "And I'll give
you the first important picture that I paint."</p>

<p>And she did. I can see it from where I sit, as I write these
words. It won a prize in an art exhibition put on by the
Architectural League of New York.</p>

<p>But she didn't paint it in California.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Of course I never asked her, and she never told
me, how she invested that money. I do know that she didn't leave
town. One day, Nancy Ashford remarked, "By the way, I saw that
lovely Wickes girl, this afternoon, when I was shopping. What a
charming young woman she is getting to be!"</p>

<p>"That's nice," I replied, trying to make it sound casual. "Did
you talk to her?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;she was busy. I don't think she saw me."</p>

<p>I had a notion to say, "That, also, is nice," but checked
myself in time.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon in May Dorothy showed up at the hospital.
She was carrying the picture. It was indeed a lovely
thing&mdash;and so was she.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" I said, "you've done it! Have you shown it to
Mr. Randolph?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," she declared, coyly. "Think I'd show it to
anybody until you had seen it?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we will do," I said. "I had expected to go
out to the Randolphs' to-night for dinner. I'll call him up and
tell him I am bringing you along&mdash;you and the picture."</p>

<p>She was delighted. On the way, I ventured to ask how
California was&mdash;in a vague sort of way&mdash;so she wouldn't
suspect, by my silence on that subject, that I had discovered her
secret. She replied, with equal indefiniteness, that California
was very nice indeed, and added that Detroit was very nice, too.
I could find no fault with either of these remarks, and pursued
my inquiries no further.</p>

<p>Randolph was excited! Of course, I thought the picture was a
magnificent piece of work; but I was no artist. Randolph knew
what he was talking about&mdash;and he didn't talk about anything
else that night. Natalie was sober, as she looked at the
painting. Then she said, quietly, "Now you can do anything you
want to do; can't she, father?"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">I did not see Dorothy again for a month. It was
at the hospital, Sunday afternoon. She was aware of my usual
schedule of work on Sundays, and I found her waiting for me. I
was sincerely glad to see the girl. She had matured,
surprisingly. She was now at work on another marine sketch, she
said, and felt sure she could sell it. It was most gratifying to
see the firmness of her self-confidence.</p>

<p>She was on the point of leaving when I said, "Oh&mdash;by the
way; you never told me how your friend Millie made out with her
little problem."</p>

<p>Dorothy was tugging on her gloves. Her eyes drifted to the
window and she replied, slowly, "She went to a sanatorium
somewhere, away up in the Adirondacks. Her lungs weren't very
strong. Her Aunt Susan consented to her going, when Millie told
her that the money was provided for people with that trouble."
Dorothy paused, but did not meet my eyes. Then, cautiously, she
proceeded. "It must have been only a slight touch of T.B. She is
well again&mdash;and back in the store, with a little better
position."</p>

<p>Perhaps I should not have pressed this inquiry any farther,
but I was too sorely tempted.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;as I recall the story," I rejoined, "Millie also
had a slight touch of something else. Did she get over that,
too?"</p>

<p>Dorothy's lips tightened in a reluctant little grin, but she
did not risk facing me.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, after some hesitation, "and it was
adopted, by very nice people. It will have a good home."</p>

<p>"I am glad," I said. "Very glad."</p>

<p>Dorothy's face lighted and she looked me squarely in the eyes.
She gave me her hand.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;good-bye&mdash;for this time," she said, sweetly.
"And&mdash;thanks&mdash;for&mdash;for everything. You've given me
such a wonderful chance to be what I want to be."</p>

<p>I held her hand for a moment, debating a reply. It would have
been very pleasant to me if I could have risked saying I had
guessed the secret, and was proud of her. But I felt that any
such comment might damage the joy she had found. These are things
you can't talk about.</p>

<p>I simply smiled into her eyes and said good-bye. She waved a
hand as she went through the door, and her lips were parted in a
radiant smile. I know that she knows that I know&mdash;and she is
glad that I wouldn't venture a word about it.</p>

<p>Dorothy and I now belong to a strange little fraternity that
makes no signs, speaks no pass-words; but has a mutual
understanding that is rich and deep and full.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">These are crowded days. We are having an
increasing number of emergency cases. More people are driving
automobiles. The roads are being unproved. Everybody is driving
faster. Last year there were sixty-six persons killed outright in
this country; double the number for the preceding twelve months.
I wonder how this reckless destruction of life is to be checked.
No one seems to be doing anything about it. Perhaps the lawmakers
would be more alert to this problem if they could spend a day in
our hospital and see the mangled people brought in for
repairs.</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>June nineteenth, 1914, 10 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">Watson and his young protg Leslie Sherman were
here for dinner to-night and have just left for the hospital
where Tim had a post-operative case to see. Sherman was keen on
going along, for he begins his internship with us next week and
is bursting with curiosity over his new duties.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, Tim and I drove over to Ann Arbor to see
Sherman get his M.D. I was much amused over Tim's motherly
concern and undisguised pride. You would have thought him an
elderly relative. There are, I believe, four years between their
ages.</p>

<p>I have been suspecting, for some time, that Tim was helping
this handsome young fellow through his medical course; and now I
feel sure of it. Perhaps this accounts, in no small measure, for
the amazing progress that Watson has made in his work at
Brightwood.</p>

<p>I have forgotten whether I reported, in this journal, that
Watson received his medical degree in June of 1910. One of the
difficulties of keeping a journal in code is that once the entry
is made, and a few weeks have passed, the author himself can't
find what it contains unless he goes to an enormous amount of
bother. If my reader thinks this is funny, he is welcome to his
amusement.</p>

<p>If I did not mention Tim's graduation from the Medical School,
I should have done so; for it was an event of much importance to
both of us. Of course, even if I had not provided a way for him
to attend college, he might have contrived to do it by some other
means; but it has been of immense satisfaction to me to have had
a part in this brilliant chap's unfolding. It has been my
privilege to witness this evolution&mdash;almost hour by
hour&mdash;since that midsummer afternoon, ten years ago, when a
rangy, red-headed, penniless young tramp showed up at the dirty
old Free Clinic on Fort Street with a broken hand and an
astonishing fund of medical patter.</p>

<p>Immediately after graduation from the Medical School, he came
to Brightwood for his internship, but I am not sure that he ever
was an interne. Nobody on the staff blamed me for the preference
I showed him. They all knew I was deeply interested in his
future, and I think they felt it was justified. Had he been my
son, Watson could not have received more attention. He not only
stood in at my most interesting operations but was as welcome to
watch Pyle at work and McDermott and Harper.</p>

<p>Nancy Ashford, who has an unusual capacity for attaching
herself to promising people, flattering and cajoling and
badgering them so that they work like dogs rather than disappoint
her, pretended from the first that she was Tim's aunt&mdash;a
relationship he has always played up to with effortless
skill.</p>

<p>Had he been but one-half as intelligent and industrious, he
could hardly have avoided success; for all the ways were greased,
and everybody gave him a push, no one&mdash;not even Tim,
himself&mdash;knew exactly when his "internship" was over and his
work as a junior on the staff began. He certainly had an early
start. To the best of my knowledge, he was the youngest surgeon
of my generation ever to have full responsibility for a major
operation.</p>

<p>You will credit me, I hope, with a fair attempt to explain
Watson's youthful arrival at a high rating in his profession, on
the ground of his exceptional opportunities&mdash;plus his alert
mind and indefatigable diligence. My own belief is, however, that
all these fortunate factors in combination could not have made
Watson what he is, to-day, without the additional inspiration of
some personal investment in another's upbuilding. Tim
unquestionably has the inner glow&mdash;or whatever this peculiar
radiance may be called&mdash;that is to be had by one means
only.</p>

<p>This strange motivation began to show up in him about a year
ago last September. He never confided anything about it to me,
but I think he knew that I knew that he knew, judging from chance
remarks that tumbled accidentally into our intimate
conversations. That he was making sacrifices on somebody's behalf
was apparent. His modest stipend from the hospital was going
somewhere; for he never had any money, never went any place, had
no social life at all; yet seemed smugly satisfied to live on
nothing, and could stand any amount of chafing about his
parsimony.</p>

<p>Through his college days, Tim had a very small part in my own
social life&mdash;such as it was. Naturally we saw but little of
him while he was in Ann Arbor, and during vacations he worked
hard at jobs which made a considerable demand oil his physical
energy. He saw very little of the Randolphs. After he came to
Brightwood, I suggested occasionally that it might be pleasant
for him to renew this acquaintance, but he was prompt with
excuses; appreciated my thought, but had something else to
do.</p>

<p>One Sunday evening, about a year ago, I prevailed on him to
accompany me to their home. I knew he was having a good time. I
knew also that he had been more than pleasantly stirred by
Natalie's fresh young beauty and grace. This delighted me. It was
what I had secretly hoped for. I have never sought any prizes as
a matchmaker, but I thought it would be interesting if Tim and
Natalie should find each other as attractive as I had found them
both to be.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that Natalie was at her very best, that night,
and I couldn't help feeling that they were congenial.</p>

<p>On the way back, I clumsily remarked, with a pretence at
playfulness, "I'm afraid I have started something, Tim, by
letting you and Natalie see each other again."</p>

<p>"You must never be afraid of anything," drawled Tim, tossing
back one of my pet clichs.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should explain, at this juncture, that I had
latterly become convinced that fear plays a very conspicuous role
in most of the diseases of a psycho-physiological character; and
I have been saying&mdash;perhaps too frequently&mdash;that many
people would be able to build up their resistance to disease and
increase their vitality if they identified their various phobias
and went bravely to the mat with them. I have been contending
that any sort of fear&mdash;no matter how apparently
inconsequential&mdash;filters through all of a man's thought
processes. He had better grapple with his pet fear, whatever it
is.</p>

<p>Take insomnia, for example: here we find, very frequently,
that the difficulty isn't rooted in a physical disability, but
can be accounted for by a little phobia. The victim goes to bed
wondering whether he will be able to sleep to-night. He is afraid
he can't. He lies there fretting over the possibility that he may
have this thing to contend with, all the rest of his life.</p>

<p>My counsel is that the man should turn on the light, open a
book, and assume that he doesn't need any sleep at this time or
Nature would be attending to it. He doesn't get scared if it
happens that he isn't very hungry, some day at noon; nor is he so
silly as to force food down his throat simply because he has been
accustomed to eat at this time of the day.</p>

<p>Let him talk himself out of his fear of insomnia, on this
common-sense basis. I have done it, myself. Plenty of nights,
after I have spent a crowded day of perplexing
duties&mdash;involving life-and-death decisions&mdash;I have gone
to bed fairly sure that I should mentally reconstruct the whole
string of dilemmas, hour after hour. I learned to handle that
problem by going forth to meet my insomnia, more than halfway.
And I have conquered this fear. I believe I have done a fairly
good job of conquering <i>all</i> of my fears. The only thing I
am really afraid of now is fear. Perhaps I talk about it too
much. I didn't blame Tim for teasing me with it, especially when
I had invited such a retort by my facetious comment concerning
him and Natalie.</p>

<p>"She is a lovely girl," I declared, fervently.</p>

<p>Tim agreed to this, in such a forthright manner that there was
but little left for me to say on the subject unless I wanted to
be impudent enough to ask him whether he was likely to be seeing
more of her.</p>

<p>After a studious silence, he said, "I think you would like to
see me try to get Natalie interested in me; isn't that so?"</p>

<p>"I had not realized that my hope had been quite so
transparent," I replied.</p>

<p>"If a high school boy," said Tim, irrelevantly, "likes a girl,
but has only ten cents in his pocket, he can buy a bag of peanuts
for her entertainment, and they can sit on the steps of the
library and swear that they belong to each other. And no harm is
done. They both know that it would be a half-dozen years before
this decision could lay a real obligation on either of them. My
own attitude toward heart affairs," he continued, deliberately,
as if he had thought it all out and composed his speech with
care, "is conditioned by the fact that I shall be twenty-nine
years old on my next birthday. I am not in the fortunate position
of the youngster who can&mdash;without any impudence&mdash;offer
a girl everything when he has nothing to offer. Any man of my
age, who encourages a young woman to believe that he has an
interest in her, is something of a cad, I think, if he has no
means of seeing it through to an honest conclusion."</p>

<p>"Naturally&mdash;I agree to all that," I broke in.
"But&mdash;young women have been willing to wait patiently until
their men have accumulated something&mdash;especially in the case
of professional men, whose early income is small."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I daresay," responded Tim, half-impatiently,
"but&mdash;well&mdash;let's suppose a case. So long as you have
been thinking about Natalie Randolph, let us talk about her. I
imagine that she is about twenty-three. She enjoys an active
social life. Her friends are pairing off. They go to the
theatres, and downtown to dinner, and for drives in the country.
They play golf and ride. Now&mdash;I cannot do any of these
things. My work is exacting and my funds are meagre. But I have
some pride. And I shouldn't accept the gift of Natalie Randolph's
time&mdash;not an hour of it!&mdash;in my present situation."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if it's money, Tim&mdash;" I ventured.</p>

<p>"No; thank you, sir," said Tim, promptly. "I'm getting all the
money I'm worth."</p>

<p>We thought it better to change the conversation then, and we
have never renewed it. But I think that Watson is in love with
Natalie Randolph. And I think also that if he had the use of his
income, he would be seeing something of her. Of course, that
makes his investment infinitely more valuable. I hope young
Sherman turns out to be something. His chance has been well paid
for.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Yesterday noon, after the Commencement, Tim and
Leslie invited me to have lunch with them and I gladly consented.
We found my car, parked several blocks from the auditorium, and
Tim drove. Before we had gone very far, I began to be a bit
nervous. We were headed toward the Michigan Central station, and
I knew there was only one restaurant in that vicinity worth
patronizing. I should have been glad enough to go to Tony's by
myself, and had done so many times; but I did not like the idea
of going with anyone else.</p>

<p>It would have been very awkward, however, for me to have
raised an objection, now that we were almost there.</p>

<p>"Tony's will probably be crowded," said Tim, as we got out of
the car, "but it's the best place in town to eat."</p>

<p>At that point, I should have said I knew that. I should have
added that I had been here. It would have been much better, too,
if I had said I knew Tony. There was no reason why I couldn't
have admitted that much; but I didn't want to discuss Tony with
anybody. Tony and I had a secret that was several years old.</p>

<p>The restaurant was full, as Tim had threatened; full of
students, alumni, young faculty men, tobacco smoke, miscellaneous
noise, and the tempting aroma of broiled steaks and chops. Tony,
himself&mdash;rotund, deliberate, and unrattled&mdash;was moving
ponderously about, making room for his clients.</p>

<p>Sherman remarked that Tony was becoming a snob; wearing a
white coat; just because it was Commencement, and there were
out-of-town guests.</p>

<p>"Doesn't he generally wear a white coat?" I was hypocrite
enough to ask, feeling that I ought to contribute something to
the conversation.</p>

<p>"Doesn't wear <i>any</i> colour of coat," obliged Tim. "Polo
shirt; no sleeves; big white apron. I don't think it improves him
to put on style."</p>

<p>Presently Tony ambled our way and caught sight of us. His
enigmatic old face lighted as he approached. He extended two big
fat hands, palms up, fingers spread, grasped me warmly, and said,
"Doc! Eet ees too long since you come!" He shrugged a massive
shoulder and gave a despairing glance around the room. "Now what
shall Tony do with you?"</p>

<p>I told him we were quite willing to wait until there was an
available table.</p>

<p>"Aren't we?" I said to my hosts, whose faces registered about
as much inquisitiveness as they could hold. Tony, noting my
company, bobbed a little bow to each of them, and said,
considerably to my embarrassment, and doubtless to their further
mystification, "You are dam' lucky yawng fellows!"</p>

<p>A table was cleared, presently, and we sat down. Tony asked if
we would let him arrange for our luncheon, and we were glad
enough to trust his expert judgment. After the old chap had
paddled away, Tim drawled, "I take it that you and Tony have met
before." It was quite funny, and we all laughed. I was glad
something had been said to ease the tension.</p>

<p>"It's a rather long story," I remarked, after a while.</p>

<p>"Whenever he says a story is long," said Tim, pretending to
offer a confidence to Leslie, "he just means it's a story you
couldn't blast out of him with dynamite." </p>

<p>I recognized a former classmate at an adjoining table, and
went over to shake hands. When I returned, it was taken by
consent that we wouldn't be talking any more about my
acquaintance with Tony. And I observed that when the good old
chap came with our incomparable steaks&mdash;which he insisted on
serving, himself&mdash;he seemed to have sensed that it wasn't
the right time for him to make any more allusions to our
friendship. He was standing behind the cash register when we came
up to settle our account.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you didn't give us a cheque," said Tim. "How much
is it, please?"</p>

<p>Tony's face grew very stern.</p>

<p>"Doc Hudson&mdash;he settle hees bill! Gooda-bye, Doc. Come
again. You come&mdash;too," said Tony, slowly wagging his head to
my young companions.</p>

<p>We thanked him, and when we were outside, Tim&mdash;who is a
fairly competent mimic&mdash;said, ostensibly for Sherman's
benefit, "Doc Hudson&mdash;he settle hees bill. Dam' lucky yawng
fellows&mdash;to be with Doc Hudson!" And then he added, "Any
other place. Doctor, you'd like to visit? You don't happen to
have a secret with a good tailor, do you?"</p>

<p>But we dropped the matter there, and Tim has never referred to
it since.</p>

<p>It is growing late and I am tired. Perhaps I shall tell you
the story about Tony, some other time.</p> <hr>

<h2>BRIGHTWOOD HOSPITAL<br> <i>October fifth, 1914, 10.30
p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">NANCY ASHFORD has been spending the past hour in
my office. There is only one thing to talk about now, so we
talked about that.</p>

<p>For two months the war has driven every other current topic
into total eclipse&mdash;and no wonder. You pick up the morning
paper and distrust your own eyesight, though goodness knows the
type is big and black enough to be read by the born blind. Every
hour more people are being swept into this thing; and, once in,
they can't get out.</p>

<p>Without asking for them you can get cocksure opinions, in any
club lounge or Pullman smoker, on the scope, duration, and
outcome of this incredible affair; and the editorials&mdash;quite
indiscreetly, it seems to me&mdash;are already defining our
national sympathies and antipathies. Surely, if our attitude as a
nation really has to be documented, it should be expressed by the
State Department. It is certainly not a job for the
journalists.</p>

<p>I find myself growing more and more dissatisfied with the
manners and morals of the public press. It has become the most
potent influence on the thought of our people; and, fully
conscious of its power, it has about left off appealing to the
reader's calm commonsense, apparently feeling that it can do a
more flourishing business by pandering to prejudice and fear.</p>

<p>I shocked Nancy by remarking that general literacy is a
dangerous accomplishment.</p>

<p>"What a silly thing to say!" hooted Nancy, who takes much
stock in modern progress and grows dewy-eyed when she talks about
the recent inventions.</p>

<p>Forced to defend my statement, I maintained that it is a good
thing for people to know how to read if what they read is good
for them to know. If their reading inflames their aversions and
fans their slumbering hatreds; or, by insidious propaganda,
teaches them aversions they had not previously held, their
ability to read does them damage and makes them a menace to the
public peace.</p>

<p>I had never thought this through carefully, and in any other
company than Nancy's I might have hesitated to air my
unconsidered views. I admitted as much to her, and she drawled,
"Go right ahead. Doctor, and see how far you can wade before you
get mired."</p>

<p>With this encouragement, I began to expound. And I am
recording our conversation here because I want you to think about
this matter earnestly. Of course it may be that when these words
are read, there will have come a complete change of
conduct&mdash;if not of character&mdash;on the part of the
papers. As the matter stands, the very large majority of them are
definitely on the side of degradation. When sternly queried, they
reply that they are giving the public what it demands. My own
opinion is that they developed the public taste. And bad taste it
is, too.</p>

<p>I reminded Nancy that the people of the world&mdash;until
recent times&mdash;believed what they were told to believe,
without much independent thinking.</p>

<p>"They lived on their prejudices," she assisted, slyly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but that word needs to be examined. It has come to
mean stupidity and stubbornness, but a prejudice isn't
necessarily a bad idea. For example: nobody ever tried to murder
me and I have never tried to murder anyone else. I never saw a
murder committed; never knew anybody who had committed a murder.
Neither by experience nor observation do I have direct knowledge
on this subject; but I am uncompromisingly against it. I have a
prejudice."</p>

<p>"You and me both," laughed Nancy. "But where do we go from
here?"</p>

<p>"Before printing was invented," I continued, undistracted,
"back in the benighted old days when people lived almost
exclusively on their prejudices&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And boiled turnips&mdash;and polluted water&mdash;"
interposed Nancy, who is standing firm for our modern
civilization.</p>

<p>"That's irrelevant," I complained, crisply. "They lived on
their prejudices; but these prejudices were authorized by
established institutions. They had dignity. You weren't yelled
at, from every corner, by discordant voices. The prejudices
weren't peddled around on the street. The Church handed you a
creed. It may have contained some statements that a contentious
individualist might disavow; but this creed was a respectable
product of earnest thinking by many wise and sincere men. It may
have had its imperfections, but it had solidity, maturity,
sanction. At least, it wasn't something that an unlicensed hawker
served, smoking hot, for a penny! It wasn't something that a
newspaper man had pounded out on his typewriter, between
nine-thirty and ten, with a boy at his elbow waiting to grab each
article of faith as it climbed out of the machine.</p>

<p>"The State," I went on, gathering momentum, "provided the
unlettered public with a pattern for patriotism. This patriotism
was a prejudice, if you like; but it had roots. It had stability.
You didn't have to be told&mdash;by some paragrapher or
free-lance columnist&mdash;what patriotism was, and how it
worked, and what it expected you to do. The State taught you your
loyalties. You didn't derive them from the yipping and snarling
of the scribes."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;that's a pretty long speech," observed Nancy, when
I had run down. She struck a match to indicate that I might be
benefited by a cigar. I regarded her gesture with reproach, but
drew out a cigar and she lighted it for me. "Has some particular
newspaper man made you mad?" she asked.</p>

<p>I shook my head. As individuals, they were fine fellows. I had
had the most pleasant relations with them. They were bright,
congenial, obliging. I couldn't remember ever having asked a
favour that they hadn't granted. No&mdash;it wasn't personal.</p>

<p>But the papers were a bad influence. To begin with, they had a
mighty low regard for the people's intelligence, imputing to them
a sort of brutishness that isn't a normal characteristic of the
average citizen. They assumed that the people had no respect
whatever for private griefs; no sensitiveness about pushing
themselves in to gaze upon another man's misfortunes. The press
would risk its very life and limbs to take photographs of
mourners weeping at the grave of an accident victim. It would
force its way into a hospital to torture an interview out of the
next of kin, in some sad circumstance. Only half-witted and
mentally diseased persons would have the morbid curiosity to
flatten their noses against the windows of homes afflicted by
tragedy; but the newspapers did it, on the assumption that the
public is psychopathic. Their arrogant impudence knew no limits.
They had utter contempt for the dignity of the courts, and taught
the public to share their rude defiance.</p>

<p>All that being true, what could you expect of the press at a
moment when the public needed to be kept steady and dispassionate
in their attitude toward a world-cataclysm crowded with
menace?</p>

<p>Nancy reminded me that we believed in free speech. But I think
it is to the people's serious disadvantage that they are able to
buy, for two cents, a stimulant to hatred, morbidity, savagery,
and scorn for the elementary decencies.</p>

<p>If it is illegal to peddle heroin, cyanide, and nitroglycerine
on the street, what excuse is there for the general distribution
of printed matter that debases the mind? If a manufacturer is
required by law to state on the ketchup bottle that it contains
benzoate of soda, the newspaper should be made to say&mdash;at
the top of page one&mdash;"This edition contains stuff that whets
the appetite for ghoulishness, sadism, and similar
psychoses."</p>

<p>Nancy said I was getting excited again, so we agreed to wheel
out the newspapers, and discuss a few other agencies dealing with
the public's thought. According to report, some inspired ass on
the local Board of Education had inquired, yesterday, whether it
wasn't about time to discontinue the teaching of German
literature in the high schools. I wonder if we are going to allow
our prejudices to unbuckle our reason. Here pops up a glowing
patriot, who&mdash;only thirty days after a European war
begins&mdash;wants his children sheltered from the sinister
influence of Goethe and Schiller. I suppose the next thing to
expect will be a frantic attack on Mozart. Perhaps they'll ban
the performance of <i>Parsifal</i>.</p>

<p>"Maybe I'll have to go to the calaboose," I growled, "for
using a Zeiss microscope."</p>

<p>"You'd better be careful where you make such remarks," advised
Nancy. "They'll say you're pro-German."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I'm not," I muttered. "Far from it!"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Nancy bade me good-night at that point, sweetly
suggesting that I go home and sleep it off, which I mean to do
presently. But I want to add a reflection or two before I stop
writing.</p>

<p>I wonder what manner of influence, if any, the churches may
exert in this bewildered time. If they were able to unite on a
policy calculated to steady the public mind, it might produce
good results. I do not know much about the churches. I do not
attend their services. Sometimes, on Saturdays, I have glanced
over the sermon topics announced for the next day. I regret to
say that I do this largely for entertainment, and it does me no
credit to be amused by these irreverences. For the most part, the
topics imply a gift of omniscience, on the part of the clergyman,
which reflects sadly on his mental housekeeping. The out-and-out
lunatic always has a disturbance of the ego. In some instances
his ego atrophies, and he develops an inferiority complex. In
many more cases his ego becomes inflamed and distended, resulting
in "hallucinatory omnipotence." Sometimes he thinks he is
Napoleon. Sometimes he is Moses. Not long ago I saw a
sermon-topic, "What God Thinks of Detroit." I wonder just what is
the difference between the mental condition of the cracked old
man who says he is Moses, and the up-and-coming prophet at the
Holiness Tabernacle who knows what God thinks of Detroit. Very
sad business, this. And the saddest feature of this humourless
state of mind is the assumption that people will come to
listen.</p>

<p>I presume that in the dignified old churches a more reasonable
policy is pursued. I know that my good friend Dean Marquis, of
the Episcopal Cathedral, isn't going to get off any such
balderdash; nor is Doctor Spence likely to make himself
ridiculous in the presence of a churchful of conservative
Presbyterians. I daresay there are a dozen or more who wouldn't
countenance the sort of thing that obviously goes on in the big
wooden tabernacle.</p>

<p>But&mdash;that's exactly where the trouble is, you see.
Reverends Marquis and Spence and Rossman and the other
intellectuals are dealing with a clientele largely composed of
privileged people, who&mdash;it may be assumed&mdash;have learned
how to think calmly. They cannot be easily stampeded.</p>

<p>The enormous crowds that gather in the big tent, where
"Buster" Beecham, the saxophone-playing evangelist, holds forth,
and in the wooden tabernacle, where "Bob" Somebody thinks for
God, are not people of privilege. They are excitable and more
reliant upon their emotions than their intelligence. It is absurd
to hope that the Gospel of Peace&mdash;as interpreted in these
places&mdash;will have a steadying effect upon people's minds.
That's where the trouble is: the very people who are most in need
of steadiness are the least likely to have it offered to
them.</p>

<p>Last Saturday I noted that one howling sensationalist was
going to preach on "When a Christian Should Fight." Doubtless he
is getting ready to rattle the sabre.</p>

<p>As I understand the original message of Galilee, it was
distinctly pacifistic, whatever may have been the shocking
history of Christianity as a militant force. In peace-time the
churches are for peace. In time of war they join the army.
Indeed, they mobilize a little ahead of the army!</p>

<p>I wonder whether there is, to-day, any powerful influence at
work in this country that may keep the public on an even keel. I
doubt it; and I am very unhappy about it.</p>

<p>The papers say, to-day, that three hundred and fifty thousand
people jammed the churches of Detroit yesterday to pray for
peace, in response to the President's nation-wide appeal. I
wonder how much good such prayers accomplish. It has been my
experience that before a prayer for a great favour can be offered
with any hope of success, one has to put up some security; some
valuable collateral, to attest one's sincerity and willingness to
toss into it everything one can assemble. I expect our people
would have to bring forward a mighty fine record for internal and
privately possessed peace, before they could hope to do much with
their petition for Europe.</p><br>

<h2>BRIGHTWOOD HOSPITAL<br> <i>May sixth, 1915, 4.30
p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">IT has been a long time since I wrote anything
in this journal. Many events, which in less tempestuous times
might have been worth mentioning here, have seemed utterly
insignificant in the face of the general stress.</p>

<p>To be quite honest, I had almost forgotten about this little
book. And I doubt if I should be writing in it now had it not
been for the fact that I stumbled upon it, a little while ago,
while searching in my office safe for a deed to some country
property.</p>

<p>Of course I might have set down in this journal a day-by-day
commentary on the appalling things that are happening overseas
and their repercussions on this side; but this project was not
conceived as a history of contemporary movements in the world. It
had but one motive: to record my own experiences in
self-investment and the rewards accruing from such adventures
into the lives of other people.</p>

<p>When you read these words, the Great War will undoubtedly be
over; for it will reach its end by sheer exhaustion, one of these
days, if not by a decisive victory. You will have more
information than you want on this subject. You may be bored by
any reference to it here. But it is a live issue, I beg you to
believe; and one can't think or talk or write about anything that
doesn't swing on this one pivot.</p>

<p>The President has had an unenviable job; trying, on the one
hand, to serve the wishes of the majority who want us to be kept
out of it, at almost any cost of national dignity, and the
passionate patriots who strongly counsel him to put an end to the
temporizing with something that we will have to do, pretty soon,
whether we like it or not.</p>

<p>Most of the men with whom I associate are feeling that the
President's diplomatic notes of protest to Germany have now
reached a point of futility where they are beginning to seem a
bit ridiculous.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday night, at a Chamber of Commerce dinner, one
militant speaker satirized this situation rather cleverly. I
doubted whether it was in very good taste to do it, but it was
undeniably amusing. He illustrated by taking off an exasperated
mother issuing requests, entreaties, and commands to her
incorrigible nine-year-old brat. The monologue began in a
comradely mood, and moved on through dulcet cooing to indignation
and hysteria.</p>

<p>"Johnny&mdash;please be mother's fine little friend&mdash;and
don't do that: that's a good boy."</p>

<p>"Johnny&mdash;mama is going to be offended."</p>

<p>"Mama doesn't want to scold her little boy."</p>

<p>"Must mama tell papa?"</p>

<p>"Johnny! Now you listen to me!"</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;you do that once more, young man, and you'll see
what happens to you."</p>

<p>"<i>Johnny!</i> Stop that&mdash;this minute! This is the last
time I am going to speak to you!"</p>

<p>"<i>Johnny!</i>"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">It sounded funny, at the moment; but it isn't
really very funny. The President is in an awkward position. He is
probably as anxious as anyone else to preserve the national
honour, and it must be a bitter dose to have oneself reviled for
spineless cowardice when one's big hope is to save our people
from avoidable bloodshed. And there's another question, too. Far
as I can learn, we haven't much of an army to send over there,
even if we should decide that our patience is exhausted. One
hears all manner of conflicting opinions on how long it would
take to mobilize, equip, and train an army strong enough to be
effective.</p>

<p>The typical speech, urging a declaration of war, is amusingly
illogical. The harangue usually begins on a highly altruistic
note, demanding that we plunge into this mess "to save
civilization," and ends by threatening that if we don't the
Germans will come over here and lick the pants off of us, after
they have finished with France and England. So&mdash;we have two
excellent reasons for going in. We can help save civilization;
and, incidentally, save our own skins. I feel that these two
appeals&mdash;so divergent in motive&mdash;instead of being
placed in the custody of a single orator, should be handled by
specialists. One man could present the idealistic appeal,
accenting our selfless interest in humanity at large; and another
man could present the more practical aspects of our case in
particular.</p>

<p>I have a lot of sympathy for the President. Many people
think&mdash;and I find myself sharing this view&mdash;that Mr.
Wilson would ease his own strain somewhat if he took advantage of
the statesmanly counsel to which he has access. He seems to be
trying to do it all himself. I said that to Pyle, the other day,
and he replied, "Well&mdash;Lincoln didn't have any very valuable
advisers; did he? And there was a time when George Washington
seemed to be playing a lone hand."</p>

<p>I had to admit that these things were true; but, all the same,
I think a lot of the responsibility, that now seems concentrated
in one man, might be shared. After all&mdash;the President does
have a Cabinet.</p>

<p>But it is easy to criticize. I know that if I were placed in
such a perplexing position as that of the President, I should
find the gravity of it insupportable. Even without any such
crushing cares, I am neurally fagged by this long-continued
tension. Perhaps it might not afflict me so much if I were in a
less depressing occupation. More and more I am confronted with
brain surgery in which half of the cases are potential funerals
before I see them. Maybe, in normal times, my task would not
weigh on me so heavily. Maybe, if my job were not so dreadfully
serious, I could view the world's predicament&mdash;and our own
national perplexity&mdash;with less fretting. The combination of
the two is very wearing.</p>

<p>When the news broke, to-day, about the sinking of the
<i>Lusitania</i>, yesterday afternoon, I felt that we had turned
a sharp corner on the road that inevitably leads to war. In the
event that we go into it, I may be needed; and, if so, I shall
go, of course, and "do my bit," as the saying goes, these
days.</p>

<p>But, in the meantime, I realize that I must try to find some
quiet retreat where I may spend a day, occasionally, apart from
the racket and strain. I asked Carter to give me a going over,
the other day, and he thinks there is a slight aneurism; advised
me to take it easy. How can I take it easy? He might as well
suggest to the Fire Department to take it easy! The cases I deal
with won't wait until the surgeon has himself a two months'
vacation.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I inadvertently acquired a little
ten-acre tract of untamed scrub-oak and briars on the rocky east
shore of Lake Saginack. There was a decent old chap named
Baldwin, who had brought his wife into the hospital for an
abdominal operation that revealed a malignant condition. It was
Pyle's case. He advised them not to go back to the country; to
remain in town, if possible, close to medical attention. Baldwin
got into conversation with me about his problem. It developed
that he had very little to go on. There was this unpromising
tract on Lake Saginack (the wrong side) which he could put up as
security for a loan. I knew he needed the money in a good cause,
so I let him have it, and took a deed to the land. His wife died,
and he followed her, not long afterward. One of these days, I
shall build a little cottage up there, and sneak away from town,
week-ends. Meantime&mdash;I think I shall pitch a good tent, and
try camping out. I have never done anything of the sort and I
daresay it will be deucedly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Perhaps I forgot to say that I built a commodious home, on the
north side of town, two years ago. Joyce spends most of her time
in a girls' school, but she entertains her friends at home during
vacations, and she needed something better than an apartment. The
money was well spent, I think, though I can't see that Joyce is
any the less restless in our more attractive quarters.</p>

<p>Of course I cannot expect to get her interested in going out
with me to the lake. She would be bored to death. I am not sure
what the solitude may do for me, if I attempt this. But if I
don't arrange for something of the sort, I may get into trouble.
At least, that's what Carter said, and he is a very good heart
man.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">I have just come from another wearisome
interview with Maxine Merrick&mdash;Cliff's widow&mdash;who has
been under observation here for a week; thinks she is going
crazy; and so do I. Far as I can determine, the only thing that
ails her is self-pity and too much concentration on the bad
treatment she has had. It is true that Cliff treated her like a
dog, and broke her spirit; but now that he is out of the picture
there seems no reason why she should not brace up. There is
nothing physiologically wrong with Maxine's head. Her trouble is
emotional instability. I feel sorry for her, and sorrier for good
old Nick, who has been trying to compensate for Cliff's neglect.
It is a pity that Nick couldn't have had a son for whom he might
feel some pride. He has built a huge country house&mdash;a costly
mansion&mdash;on the west shore of Saginack, and is living there
alone with a battery of servants. I doubt if he gets much
pleasure out of it. If I were in his place, I should travel. But
Nick wouldn't know what he was looking at, if he did travel,
unless it had something to do with machinery; and he can see more
machinery here in Detroit than anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>Maxine has now developed into a typical hypo. She has pains.
She has pains in her inner ear. She has a pain in her neck.
Watson, who has examined her, says she <i>is</i> a pain in the
neck. She also has much discomfort in her left shoulder, in her
lower abdomen, and in her heels. Not that she hasn't been
diligent in trying to find relief. She has been to Carlsbad and
Aix-les-Bains; she has been to Lourdes. Every so often, in the
past three or four years, she has packed her trunks and a maid or
two and her badly spoiled son, Bobby, and has galloped away for
another sort of treatment. She has had violet rays, mud packs,
and Hindu philosophy. She has tried Battle Creek, Theosophy,
Arizona, Christian Science, White Sulphur Springs, the Wisdom of
the East, and enough colonics to sap the vitality of an army
mule.</p>

<p>At present, her anxiety over her own disabilities is somewhat
distracted by the untimely arrival of Bobby from the Culver
Military Academy where, she said, he had been getting along so
nicely. Bobby came to see her yesterday, carrying a huge armful
of red roses. You can't help liking him; neither can you help
feeling that he must have missed a large number of spankings to
which he was justly entitled.</p>

<p>Maxine sent for me to come to her room and meet Bobby, whom I
had not seen for a long time. He conversed, without reticence,
about his recent retirement from Culver. I rather expected he
would try to throw the blame for his expulsion onto the school,
but he didn't; was entirely unabashed in reporting that they had
"put up with a lot," and declared that the Colonel was a mighty
fine man. Bobby was very tender in his attitude toward his
mother, but I don't see how he can have very much respect for
her, in her unbalanced condition. I sympathize with the boy. His
father was no good, and his mother is a damn fool. I wonder what
will become of him. He's bright enough to be anything he wants to
be.</p>

<p>When I dropped in to see Maxine, this afternoon, she was
sitting up in bed, attractively jacketed in something made of
pink satin and white feathers, and intent upon a little book.
Without preliminaries, she asked me what month I was born in; and
informed me&mdash;after a good deal of leafing back and
forth&mdash;that I was very firm, very strong, and very stubborn,
as indicated by my astral control which, she had discovered, is
Alpha of the Nebulae Andromeda. I thanked her for assigning to me
such of these attributes as might be considered complimentary,
and asked her if her bowels had moved well, to-day, which she
seemed to feel was irrelevant.</p>

<p>"Right while I'm telling you," she complained, "about your
horoscope, you ask me a rude question that shows you weren't
paying the slightest attention."</p>

<p>I assured her that the two topics were not so incongruous as
they seemed; that her defective elimination and her interest in
Astrology might be more closely related than she thought. Maxine
laughed a little, which I considered a good sign. It has been a
long time since she has exhibited any appreciation of humour.</p>

<p>But it was only a fleeting promise. Pretty soon she was back
on one of her pet subjects: what to do next in the great cause of
her health and what she calls "mental rearmament." Most of our
current clichs have a military flavour.</p>

<p>What Maxine really needs is something constructive to do, but
I hesitate to suggest a philanthropy. I am sure she would be an
insufferable nuisance on the board of a charity, and she would
unquestionably make a mess of any attempt to befriend an
individual.</p>

<p>Before I left, she showed me some literature she had received
from a goofy colony in Southern California where you study what
Maxine says is an eclectic derived from Rosicrucianism, Bahaism,
and Buddhism, in combination with a vital diet, cosmic breathing,
and systematic meditation. I told her it was just the place for
her, and I hope she goes. I don't like to see the hospital taking
her money. I should like to have given her a stern lecture about
her amazing silliness, but it wouldn't have done the slightest
bit of good. [1]</p>

<p class="footnote">Had Doctor Hudson foreseen that it would fall
to the lot of Maxine Merrick's son to transcribe this journal (a
most unlikely circumstance when viewed from the date of this
entry), his comments on her eccentricities might have been less
severe. I suppose he was sorely tried by my mother's hypochondria
and general instability. At this period of her life she was
indeed difficult and pitiably unhappy. (R. M.)</p>

<p>As I was in the act of locking the safe, there was a tap on
the door, and to my surprise and delight Natalie Randolph breezed
in. It has been a long time since I have seen anything so pretty.
Natalie certainly knows how to dress.</p>

<p>She was very animated, very much on tip-toe.</p>

<p>It was the first time she had ever honoured me with a
voluntary call, and I was curious to know what her errand might
be.</p>

<p>"It's easy to see," I remarked, "that you haven't come to
consult me professionally. You never looked healthier in your
life."</p>

<p>"I had a few minutes to wait," she explained, "and I thought
I'd run in and say Hello&mdash;if you weren't too busy."</p>

<p>I assured her that I would never be too busy to talk to her;
inquired about her father; answered questions about Joyce; asked
whether she had come to see one of our patients.</p>

<p>She flushed a little, most becomingly, and said, "I have
driven over to carry off one of your doctors for dinner. Do you
mind?"</p>

<p>I tried not to seem too foolishly pleased, and had sense
enough not to press any questions. Mind? Of course, I didn't
mind!</p>

<p>"It's going to do Brightwood Hospital a lot of good," I said,
"if one of our doctors is seen in the company of such a charming
young woman. What we need over here is a little more class."</p>

<p>She made a puckery little mouth at me, told me to be careful
what I said to impressionable young women, offered her hand, and
dashed away.</p>

<p>I hope this thing comes off. Tim deserves a girl like Natalie.
He has been pretty sly&mdash;keeping this a secret from me.</p>

<h2>BRIGHTWOOD HOSPITAL<br> <i>May tenth, 1915, 9.30
p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">LATE Friday afternoon I had a telephone call
from my friend Doctor Russell in Chicago asking if I could run up
and attend a consultation the next day. I asked him what it was
about and he said it was a glioma. I might have suspected as
much, for whenever I am called to a medical centre as well
equipped as Chicago the case is almost sure to be one of the
forty-nine gliomas.</p>

<p>If it should happen that you do not know anything about this,
it may be sufficient to tell you that a glioma is an intracranial
cyst&mdash;and it is no picnic, either for the patient or the
surgeon.</p>

<p>If you do know anything about it&mdash;and it is indeed quite
probable that the person who comes into possession of these
memoirs is well informed on medical matters&mdash;it may have
come to your attention that it has been my good fortune to have
experienced a considerable success with these gliomas. Until
nearly six years ago, I tried to content myself with the usual
procedure.</p>

<p>The customary technique was to empty the cystic cavity, and
let it go at that. I assume that every surgeon suspected there
was a localized tumour nodule responsible for the secretion of
the fluid that caused the pressure and set up the general
derangement and degeneration of the brain; but it is very serious
business to go exploring in a cystic cavity, in a blind search
for something practically indistinguishable from the convolutions
of normal brain tissue.</p>

<p>My own practice was to drain the cavity, and hope for the
best; and I think that almost every other neurologist believed in
the same procedure.</p>

<p>On the first Saturday of July, 1909, I operated on a young
woman who, three years earlier, had been hospitalized elsewhere
with a cerebellar cyst. The surgeon had done what I should have
done in that instance. He had emptied the cystic fluid. There was
nothing unusual about the history of the case, after that. The
patient made a fairly satisfactory recovery. That is what one
might expect. Customarily, a gratifying convalescence promptly
ensued. In the course of a year&mdash;possibly up to two
years&mdash;you would begin to find the same old symptoms showing
up again; early morning headaches, nausea, faulty vision, and an
ataxic gait.</p>

<p>This erratic and violent nausea, by the way, frequently misled
medical men, formerly, who were disposed to look for the trouble
in the gastro-intestinal tract. But I suppose you know that.</p>

<p>On the occasion to which I am referring, my patient had all
the stock symptoms that had been exhibited immediately prior to
her previous operation. I did the only thing that was indicated;
drained the cavity; and would have stopped with that.</p>

<p>But I was having a few peculiar symptoms that day, myself. I'm
afraid I can't describe this sensation very well, but I felt
something that might almost be defined as prescience. I don't
mean prescience in relation to a divining of future events, but
something like prescience in respect to a sensitivity a little
beyond one's reach. Am I making myself clear, at all?
Well&mdash;it was as if the nerves in my fingers extended to the
end of the probe; as if the probe were an integral part of my
hand, alert as the antennae of a bee.</p>

<p>Of course, if you want to think that one acquires this faculty
by constant exercise, backed by the utmost concentration, you are
taking a very commonsense view of the matter. You have a good
deal of testimony on your side. Blind persons, who read Braille,
offer an excellent example of what diligent training will do to
make a fingertip cognitive. I hope you will not object to this
word cognitive. The intelligent blind man will tell you that he
can read Braille with the tip of his right index finger, almost
as rapidly as you can read a newspaper by sight. If he uses the
tip of the second finger of his right hand, he has to spell the
words&mdash;letter by letter. If he runs the tip of his little
finger over the raised letters, he can't read Braille any better
than you can. It might&mdash;by accommodation&mdash;be said that
this blind man's little finger, in respect to literacy, is still
an infant. His second finger, in respect to literacy, is five
years old. His index finger is adult. Does that help any to
illustrate what I am trying to say about this "cognitive" quality
that came into my hand? I believe that I could read, with the tip
of my probe, where the tumour nodule was located!</p>

<p>Let me repeat&mdash;if you want to think this had come about
through practice, all very well; but the fact is that I had never
been so acutely conscious of that faculty before, or so confident
that I could exercise it with any hope of success. So&mdash;I
went after that nodule. Hunting for a needle in a haystack,
compared to this quest, is merely child's play.</p>

<p>I was very fortunate, that day. After the removal of the
tumour, my patient's recovery was rapid and decisive. She
regained her health and there has been no recurrence of her
trouble. Since then, I have approached these cases with a great
deal of confidence. They are still serious enough, but we have
cut down our operative mortality from fourteen per cent to four,
which is a nice gain.</p>

<p>There are a few other men, in my specialty, who have had much
the same success. How they came by their faculty of prescience
(if you can endure that not very adequate word in this
connection), I do not know. But I know how I came by mine. And
I'm not ashamed to admit it, no matter how crazy it sounds.</p>

<p>I performed that epochal operation on a Saturday afternoon in
July. On the Tuesday before, I spent six hours with Tony
Bontempini, shopping for a kitchen range, assorted pots and pans,
stone dishes and steel cutlery, so that he could open up a little
restaurant. There is no doubt in my mind but I found there were
nerves in my probe, in my lancet, in my scalpel, because I made
something important of Tony.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Tony Bontempini had been a patient of mine. A
railroad surgeon had brought him in, one afternoon in April, with
about the sorriest-looking head I ever saw, which is saying quite
a bit. The railroad doctor hadn't the slightest notion that Tony
would survive any attempted repairs, and neither had I. It was
one of those cases that make a cold shudder run down your spine,
no matter how accustomed you may be to compound fractures. Nancy
lost her lunch.</p>

<p>I asked the doctor why he had gone to the bother to bring this
man away out to Brightwood, and he said he wanted Tony to die in
some institution, where, it might be conjectured, everything had
been done for him. The doctor didn't even wait to consult; said
we could 'phone him when it was all over, and he would attend to
the rest of the job.</p>

<p>In other words, Tony Bontempini was a pretty sick man. I
wouldn't have bet ten cents on him.</p>

<p>Before leaving the hospital, the railroad doctor&mdash;a very
good fellow, but quite inured to the sight of bad
accidents&mdash;remarked that it was rather a pity, for the
affair was no fault of Tony's. Tony hadn't been careless. There
was an old chap in the section-gang who was very hard of hearing.
Tony saw him about to be mowed down by a shunted freight-car; had
grabbed him to drag him to safety; and was himself struck a
crushing blow by the protruding end of a coupling-rod.</p>

<p>When the doctor was gone, I went up to have another peep at
Tony. He was breathing stertorously, but with fairly steady
rhythm. Watson drifted in, and after watching for a while,
remarked that Tony must have some good stuff packed away. At
nine, Tony was still pumping along at the old stand.</p>

<p>"He seems to be practically indestructible," I said to Tim.
"I'm going to get in there and see if anything can be done."</p>

<p>I have seen people die, who might have been saved if they had
been a little bit sicker. So long as there is a ray of hope, a
surgeon is likely to be prudent; sometimes too prudent. If the
patient is going to die, anyhow, and it doesn't matter what you
do to him, you are likely to be audacious. Once in a while that
audacity will do the trick. I've seen it happen. It happened to
Tony. He must have had the constitution of a horse, or he
couldn't possibly have survived what we had to do to him. Tim
muttered, "I've never seen this much of the inside of a head
since I studied Anatomy."</p>

<p>Little by little, Tony came plodding back from wherever he'd
been, and I wondered whether we had really done him a service.
All he was good for was a pick-and-shovel job. It was obvious
that he could never do anything like that again. And he seemed to
realize that the outlook was most unpromising. You couldn't get a
rise out of him. He was glum, torpid, incommunicative. I think he
understood English much better than he pretended; responding to
questions concerning his appetite, his discomforts, his physical
wants, but becoming dumb as a moron if you tried to interest him
in anything that might distract his mind and lift his
depression.</p>

<p>The railroad doctor began to call up, with increasing
frequency, to learn how Tony was getting along and when he might
be discharged. I do not think that the doctor was positively
annoyed by Tony's recovery, but it would have been a much less
complicated situation if Tony had confirmed the early
forecast.</p>

<p>Every afternoon, the nurse would wheel Tony up to the solarium
where he sat staring at the sunshine, taking no stock of his
fellow convalescents, and pretending not to understand them when
they tried to be pleasant. Finally I got an order to discharge
Tony as soon as he was able to be released. I couldn't keep him
any longer. I went to his room and told him; expressed my hope
that he would find something to do. The railroad was going to
arrange some sort of compensation, no doubt. They were always
quite decent about such things, I had found. But Tony didn't want
to be kept in idleness. The prospect of a pension was merely
another cross to bear.</p>

<p>After a protracted silence, he made a weary, despairing little
gesture with his bony hand, and said, in a dull monotone, "Eet
ees no good, Doc. You are a dam' fine feller. Fix Tony's head.
But Tony ees no good&mdash;no more&mdash;no good."</p>

<p>"Perhaps there is something else you can do, Tony," I said,
not very hopefully. "You mustn't work with a shovel, any more,
and you mustn't work in the hot sun. But there are indoor jobs.
Is there anything you know how to do?"</p>

<p>"I cook&mdash;mebbe. Aw&mdash;not so good," he shrugged,
self-deprecatingly, "&mdash;just&mdash;what you call plain cook.
But&mdash;nobody want poor, seeck wop for cook."</p>

<p>I grabbed at this straw as we were going down for the last
time.</p>

<p>"Cook!" I exclaimed, happily. "Now we've got something."</p>

<p>"Aw&mdash;no, Doc," protested Tony. "Mebbe&mdash;in soma poor
leetle dump&mdash;by myself&mdash;but not to work all day."</p>

<p>I had an inspiration.</p>

<p>"Tony," I said, brightly, "over in Ann Arbor there is a big
college. You know what I mean?"</p>

<p>Tony nodded, comprehendingly, and muttered "Footaball," which
made me grin a little, so accurately had he hit the thing smack
on the button.</p>

<p>"Many hungry boys," I went on. "Eat all day; eat all night;
eat anything, everything; eat on stools, eat standing up; eat
out-of-doors&mdash;in the rain&mdash;in the snow&mdash;" Could I
believe my eyes? Tony was pulling a reluctant grin. It was the
first one he had ever put on in my society. I continued, with
enthusiasm. "Good place for little restaurant. I want you to go
there and start one. I am going with you! We are going to-morrow!
I shall set you up in business. It won't cost very much. We will
find a little room somewhere and buy you a skillet."</p>

<p>Tony grinned, and rubbed his jaw hard with the palm of his
hand, like an embarrassed child. Then he rubbed both fists in his
eyes; and, after a good deal of swallowing, muttered that I was a
damn fine feller. I couldn't take any more of that, at the
moment, so I went away.</p>

<p>Next day, I went head over heels into an adventure that I knew
nothing about; but Tony seemed to know what we wanted. You
wouldn't have recognized him for the same fellow, as we drove to
Ann Arbor; chattered like a magpie; understood everything I said
to him&mdash;all but my earnest request that he must never, never
tell.</p>

<p>He couldn't get this through his head, but he consented. He
warmed genially to my suggestion that
if&mdash;sometime&mdash;some cold night, maybe&mdash;a hungry
chap came in, looking pretty hollow, perhaps it would be well to
feed him&mdash;and forget the loss. I wasn't quite sure how Tony
would feel about that proposal, but he nodded, emphatically, and
said, "Alia right, Doc. Tony will turn no one away hungry."</p>

<p>He proved to be a good bargainer. I was doubtful of his wisdom
when he selected his location. It was a long-abandoned, shabby
storeroom, about a block from the railroad station.</p>

<p>"You won't be able to catch a very profitable class of trade
down here, Tony," I protested. "This is off the beat. The
students won't come into a place like this&mdash;so close to the
racket and dirt of the railroad."</p>

<p>Tony grinned, superiorly.</p>

<p>"College fellers," he declared, "same as any other yawng
fellers. Lika de railroad, lika de noise, lika de dirt.
Homeseeck&mdash;come down to seea de railroad. Tony feed 'em.
Gooda place."</p>

<p>I gave in, and we rented the storeroom from an old codger who
let us have it at our own figures and almost kissed us when we
made an advance payment. Then we bought the range, and the rest
of the stuff. I took Tony to the bank I knew best and introduced
him, placing some money at his disposal.</p>

<p>"Gooda-bye, Doc," said Tony, when I was ready to go. "I paya
you back&mdash;soma day."</p>

<p>"I don't want it back. I have other plans for that money. Do
you understand, Tony?"</p>

<p>"Hella, no!" said Tony, scratching his head, and regarding me
anxiously.</p>

<p>"No matter," I called after him. "Good-bye, Tony!"</p>

<p>"Gooda-bye, Doc," he said, waving his hat.</p>

<p>That was Tuesday.</p>

<p>On Saturday I did the first of that long string of gliomas
with which I have had such gratifying success. Maybe these two
matters have no relation. Maybe they occurred coincidentally. My
own opinion is that my investment in Tony Bontempini made me
aware of what I had in my cognitive hand. Sometimes my
friendliest colleagues have pleasantly remarked that I am "a good
guesser." But I am not a guesser. I wouldn't say this anywhere
else than in a private journal that will not be read while I am
living: I have what might be called a prescient hand.</p>

<p>And I know how I got it!</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">It was pleasant to hobnob with Clark Russell
again. We were classmates in the Medical School. I always
considered him a brighter and more responsive student than
myself, and admired him greatly. We meet frequently. He was very
fortunate in marriage. Clara Russell has an excellent mind,
shrewd wit, and an amazing capacity for developing lasting
friendships. Whenever I go to Chicago on a professional errand,
if I have an hour or two to spare, I see the Russells. Sometimes
I go out to their home. If the time is short, we meet down-town
for dinner.</p>

<p>I arrived in Chicago Saturday morning. We went into
consultation over Russell's glioma at nine. I said, "I can't see
why you called me in. You knew what it was." And Russell replied,
amusingly, like a small boy caught in the jam-pot, "I thought
perhaps you'd like to take it out." So&mdash;I operated, though
it isn't going to do very much good, for the growth was a
glioblastoma multiforme, which will presently reinstate itself,
and fully a third of them are malignant. Our patient was a woman
of fifty. She will be free of her bad headaches for a year or
two. It's worth an operation. One of these days, she will die. So
will Russell and I. And you. But, in the meantime, we have a
right to be relieved of our aches and pains, if we can find a
way. I think this sort of surgery is justified, even if it
doesn't hold out much promise of permanent recovery. What is
permanent recovery? How permanent do you think you are?</p>

<p>I dined that night with the Russells: and, because I had
planned to take a ten o'clock train for home, we had our dinner
at the Blackstone. We talked about the war. Russell is sure we
are going to be in it presently, and I suppose he is right. At
all events, we had no debate on the matter. I aired my recent
reflections on the deplorable lack of steadying agencies at a
time when the public needed reliances in which the people might
place their trust. I was pretty stern about the newspapers, and I
had some unflattering things to say about the churches.</p>

<p>Clara conceded my points, in the main, but wanted to call my
attention to at least one church&mdash;the one she attends&mdash;
where this matter is receiving proper attention. I inquired about
it, and Clara said it was Trinity Cathedral. Then she went on to
quote generously from some of the recent remarks of the preacher
there. Dean Harcourt. I had occasionally seen his name in the
papers.</p>

<p>As I have said, I have a great deal of respect for Clara
Russell's intelligence. Anything that she thinks is sound is
likely to be worth consideration. I listened attentively to what
she had to say. She believes that if the people at large had
access to Harcourt's august philosophy it would brace them
up.</p>

<p>"The intellectuals, you mean," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Not exclusively," she said. "That is the triumphant thing
about Dean Harcourt's sermons. They appeal to the intellectuals,
but are understood by people who have never learned how to think
straight. They learn it there. I wish you could hear him."</p>

<p>The Russells went home at nine-thirty. I went up to pack my
tackle, expecting to go to my train, only a ten minutes'
taxi-drive. Then I decided, impulsively and to my own surprise,
that I would stay over and hear this man Harcourt in the morning.
For I needed some bucking up myself.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Nancy Ashford, whom I had not seen since my
return from Chicago, has just been in to tell me I have been
working long enough and should go home to bed. This is good
advice, and I shall defer a report of my visit to Trinity
Cathedral until my next leisure hour. All I care to say about it
now is that I was strangely moved by that event and I believe
that if this man Harcourt could be harnessed up somehow to a
wide-spread channel of communication he could do a great deal for
the public.</p>

<p>I asked Nancy if anything interesting had happened, and she
said, "Your attractive young friend, Natalie Randolph, was here
again this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Came for Tim, likely," I remarked, with satisfaction. "That
affair gives promise. It will be good for both of them. I hope
they make a go of it. Couple of thoroughbreds."</p>

<p>"It isn't Tim," said Nancy. "It's Leslie Sherman."</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>June twenty-fifth, 1915, 11 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">JOYCE is at home again for her summer vacation.
I think twelve years must be a difficult age for a girl. She
isn't a mere child, and has a long way to go before she is a
young woman. I am not quite sure how we are going to amuse her
here.</p>

<p>She says she doesn't want to study during vacation, and one
cannot blame her for that. She has no very serious interest in
the piano or any other music. Having been out of town for so many
months, she seems to have lost connection with her former friends
here. I asked her if she would like to invite a couple of her
school companions as house guests for a while, but she thinks
they are all spending their holidays with their families; many of
them at the seashore. Joyce wonders why we can't go to the
seashore, too; but it is quite impossible for me to get away now.
I suggested a girls' camp, but she doesn't like the discipline;
admits that she is too lazy to keep up with the various
activities.</p>

<p>I am afraid I have not done a very good job in bringing up
this child. Joyce has fleeting seizures of demonstrative
affection for me, interspersed with longer periods of detachment.
She is restless, and I cannot contrive anything to occupy her
mind. Everything will be all right when she returns to school in
September. She has a good many of the erraticisms of her
Grandfather Cummings; not all of them, I devoutly hope.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">In my last entry in this journal I referred to
the interesting experience I had, a few days ago, at Trinity
Cathedral in Chicago. I was much impressed by some remarks made
by the preacher. Dean Harcourt. I judge him to be a little east
of fifty, though his manner is more venerable, due, no doubt, to
the fact that he is a victim of infantile paralysis, seriously
crippled, and bearing the deep criss-cross lines about his eyes
which certify to the pain he has endured. There is tracery around
the mouth, too, that tells its own story; though there isn't the
slightest indication of self-pity, rebellion, or despair. Quite
to the contrary, it is a reposeful face. I never saw a man whose
outward bearing seemed so well deserving of the word "spiritual."
He inspires confidence. You have a feeling that nothing could
shatter him or make him afraid or quench his inner glow.</p>

<p>I tried to analyse the whole event, that Sunday morning. I was
deeply moved, yet curious to discover the predominant factors
which had stirred me; whether the organ, the choir, the
architecture, the solemn reverence of the place, the sermon, or
the man himself. I suppose it was the perfect harmony and
complete integration of all these persons and properties.</p>

<p>In the very first place, you had a sense of the solidarity and
sureness and effortless self-confidence of the building itself.
It was massive and it was sincere. The walls not only looked like
stone: they were stone. I thought a little about this as I
approached. Some of our churches are built of concrete blocks, in
imitation of stone. And some of our wooden steeples, fussy with
jigsaw ornamentation, are painted gray to resemble stone. I had
never considered this matter, but it occurs to me now that a
church should never be an imitation of something. If the people
cannot afford to build their church of stone, let it be made of
wood; but, in that case, let the wood be wood.</p>

<p>This may seem to be cavilling over a very small matter. The
more that I think about it, the more important it grows. If the
church wants to have a steadying effect upon the people, it must
begin the task by being absolutely honest. The individual may not
pause to ask himself why it is that the church he attends does
not compose his spirit, but I think it must have a disquieting
effect on him if the building itself is an architectural fraud.
If he can't believe in the integrity of the structure, how is he
going to believe in the soundness and sincerity of the
institution?</p>

<p>I hope I am not making too much of this, but I think the
feeling of repose, reliance; the feeling that I was, for a little
while, in the custody of something substantial, enduring, and
impeccably honest, had a lot to do with my mood, that day.
Everything was genuine. The candles on the altar were candles;
they were not electric lamps fashioned to resemble candles: they
were candles.</p>

<p>There was something about that stately music that had the
essence of permanence. It was elemental stuff.</p>

<p>In the village church that we attended, when I was a
youngster, the minister&mdash;a kind, well-meaning man, with an
obsequious smile but no dignity either of speech or
bearing&mdash;would open the service with a short prayer in which
Deity was verbally patted on the shoulder after the manner of a
genial greeting between a couple of lodge brothers, and then the
good man would announce a song, such as&mdash;"Only an
Armour-bearer, Proudly I Stand." Or&mdash;"Let the Lower Lights
be Burning." The announcement of the song was always accompanied
by an informal&mdash;sometimes jocular&mdash;admonition urging
the congregation, whom he habitually addressed as "folks," to
join heartily in the singing. Often he would add, playfully, "If
you can't keep on the tune, try to make a joyful noise."</p>

<p>I realize that this may be an exceptional case of irreverence;
or perhaps "gaucherie" might be a less severe and more accurate
designation. But from what I can learn about the prevailing
habits of the majority of our churches in this country, I
strongly suspect that the difference between that village church
procedure and the current customs of our churches is a difference
of manner rather than mood. The idea seems to be that the church
is a social club; and, as such, should avoid anything like
formality. Let us all loudly sing now, folks, and make whoopee
for the Lord.</p>

<p>As I sat there in Trinity Cathedral, waiting for the service
to begin, I felt conscious of an other-worldly environment. This
was not a club. An usher had quietly shown me to a seat. He had
not pawed me. Nor had his manner indicated that I was doing
Trinity Cathedral a very good turn by honouring it with my
presence. I gathered that Trinity Cathedral hadn't been fretting
about the possibility of my non-attendance. The place was very
quiet. Everybody faced the thing alone.</p>

<p>Presently the organ began. One couldn't see the organist at
work, and one couldn't see the organ. It gave the swelling music
a chance. The vested choir came down the broad, stone-flagged
aisle. The people stood. The choir filed slowly into the chancel,
singing. Two young men in vestments supported on either side the
tall, white-haired, crippled man, who came into the chancel from
an adjacent door. There were prayers, chants, readings from the
Bible, stately hymns. I confess I was almost suffocated with
emotion when the august hymn began&mdash;"O God Our Help in Ages
Past; Our Hope for Years to Come." I had been so dreadfully
upset; so beaten down with worries; so riddled with
anxieties&mdash;in my professional work&mdash;and anxieties over
the stunning deeds of violence abroad. My eyes burned and flooded
while that confident hymn confessed its faith in the
everlastingness of the Divine Guidance. "A thousand ages in Thy
sight are like an evening gone." Here was permanence for you.
"Time like an ever-rolling stream." The hot tears rolled down my
cheeks. It was the first time my neural tension had been relieved
for a long, long time.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">When I began to write this, I had it in mind
only to record a few of the things that Dean Harcourt said, that
morning; but it occurred to me that you might be a little more
impressed by them if you realized the mood I was in when I heard
them. As I have said, I was deeply moved, that day. I suppose
almost anything the man might have said would have found me
wistfully receptive.</p>

<p>I don't think there had been a sermon topic announced, and I
am not sure that the Dean began by stating his theme, but what he
talked about was the insured life. It was a tribute to our spirit
of co-operation, he thought, that we had been able to insure so
many of our interests. Once upon a time, if a man's house burned
down or his horses were stolen, he took his loss alone. We had
now reached the point in our socialization where we were bearing
one another's burdens.</p>

<p>The Dean digressed a little here to remind us of the great
progress we had been making in this field. Only a little while
ago, as Time is counted in terms of epochs, the social order was
hardly aware of itself as an integer. The handful of kind-hearted
men and women in a community did what they could to aid their
neighbours and kindred in distress, but the kindness was
sporadic. There was no enduring momentum to it.</p>

<p>"May one suggest to the dismayed," said the Dean, "that
instead of deploring the long way we must yet go until we have
reached an era of universal amity, we rejoice over the
immeasurably longer way we have come from an era of universal
suspicion, distrust, and fear. This is not a single day's
march&mdash;from the jungle to the city of light&mdash;but we are
much closer to the light than we are to the jungle. We are not
there yet, but we know which way we are headed. There have been
many detainments, many detours. It has not been&mdash;and may not
be&mdash;a straight and steady course toward the Golden Age, but
the general direction is forward; the general movement is upward.
We cannot afford to be patient, if patience&mdash;in our
opinion&mdash;means apathy; but we can well afford to be patient,
if patience means poise. We are not indignant with our ancestors
because they moved no faster, nor should we be too critical of
ourselves if, in our time, we have days of plodding with leaden
feet."</p>

<p>All things considered, thought the Dean, we had not done so
badly. One of the evidences of our increasing willingness to
befriend one another was manifest by the widespread interest in
insurance. If a man's house burns down, the community builds
another.</p>

<p>"It will not build him another unless he has previously given
evidence that he, himself, would help restore another man's
house; but if he has declared his willingness to assist in
defraying the cost of another's accident or illness or death or
the care of his helpless survivors, he can expect that the age he
lives in will do for him whatever he stands ready to do for
others. There are many imperfections and inequities in our social
order which need correction, but our present system warrants our
optimism. We have a right to be hopeful&mdash;and hope, I think,
is the first requisite of courage."</p>

<p>Perhaps these words that I am trying to quote, and I believe I
am recording at least the substance of them, may sound trite and
obvious; but, in the solemn stillness of that place, they had a
peculiar steadying quality. The world&mdash;in spite of its
problems&mdash;wasn't galloping a tam-o'-shanter to the devil.
The world was operating on a long-term schedule. Its defects were
many, but they were not as many as they were a hundred years ago.
We were too close to this movement to observe its progress. Did
William the Conqueror come forth from his tomb, and survey the
world, he would observe the course and distance we had come.
Sometimes it is difficult for us to note the world's
advancement&mdash;but William could see it, if he came back.</p>

<p>So much, then, for progress, of which insurance was a good
sign. It had come to pass that we could insure almost anything;
insure an outdoor pageant against the loss occasioned by rain;
the pianist could insure his hands and the dancer her feet.</p>

<p>But there were still some possible losses which a man must
bear alone; some risks he would have to carry without aid.</p>

<p>Here the Dean remarked that it would be indeed a great comfort
if one could insure one's memories so that they would ever bless
him, and never burn.</p>

<p>"You can insure your memories," said the Dean, "but you will
have to do it by yourself. And they are very real property, too.
Some of them are assets; some of them are liabilities. Be careful
what kind of memories you store up to live on in a rainy
day."</p>

<p>Let me repeat: perhaps this sounds commonplace, apart from its
setting. But everything was so strangely hushed. It seemed as if
you were getting a direct message from Headquarters!</p>

<p>"Be spiritually thrifty!" advised Dean Harcourt. "Put aside
some memories that will nourish you in your declining years. Be
mindful not to stock memories that will keep you awake nights. It
will be too bad&mdash;too bad&mdash;if, every time there is a
little cessation of the noise and confusion, you hear the sound
of people sobbing&mdash;people who loved you. It will be very
good if, when the noise about you subsides a little, you can
remember the words and tones of gratitude&mdash;gratitude of
people who lived more abundantly&mdash;because of
<i>you</i>."</p>

<p>This whole affair made a profound impression on me. I do not
think that I shall live long enough to forget it. I hope my
reference to it may be of benefit to you.</p>

<p>I went out of the Cathedral feeling that I had been fitted
with a new balance-wheel. I wish everybody had access to such an
inspiration in these troubled times.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">I am driving up to my "estate" on Lake Saginack
to-morrow. The idea of pitching a tent up there is, I feel,
absurdly impractical. But perhaps I may want to build a little
cottage there. It is not so very far away. I might have a good
deal of satisfaction in a quiet place like that. I am taking
Joyce along, but I fear she will not find it very entertaining. I
do wish I could think of something that might give pleasure to
this restless child.</p> <hr>

<h2>BRIGHTWOOD HOSPITAL<br> <i>December fourth, 1915, 9
p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">HENRY FORD'S peace ship sailed this afternoon
from Hoboken and the papers are amused. Perhaps they cannot be
blamed, for this excursion does seem a bit fantastic.</p>

<p>But it isn't much harder to believe that a dozen unauthorized
pacifiers could hope that they might stop the war than that such
a war could have been precipitated. The whole thing is an
incredible nightmare!</p>

<p>Of course the main point of weakness in this well-meant
adventure is the conspicuous absence of anyone officially
empowered to represent the United States government. Assuming
that this party of altruistic cruisers voices the thoughts and
hopes of many millions of American citizens&mdash;and I think it
does&mdash;it has no recognized standing. Governments&mdash;not
private citizens&mdash;make wars. And when wars come to an end,
the governments end them.</p>

<p>Ford's project is put on by laymen. It is very doubtful
whether the governments of the countries involved will pay the
slightest heed to it; except, perhaps, to sneer at it. But it is
by no means an ignoble gesture, however futile. I was glad to see
that none of the spoofing paragraphers has insinuated that Henry
might be doing this to show off; for that wouldn't have been
true. Henry does not hanker for front page publicity. He is not a
vain man. Nobody can accuse him of exhibitionism. He has gone
into this thing sincerely.</p>

<p>And in spite of all the editorial snickers, I'll bet there are
a lot of people, throughout this country, who are earnestly
hoping, perhaps expecting, that something may come of this
expedition.</p>

<p>I am mentioning this event here because it is likely that when
these words are deciphered the Great War will have passed into
ghastly history, and I want you to realize the mental condition
of our people in these closing days of 1915. If a man as bright
and cold as Henry Ford will charter a ship, at the instigation of
a not very thoroughly credentialled Hungarian woman, and sail for
Europe with a little group of newspaper men and parsons,
intending to stop the war "and get the men out of the trenches by
Christmas," you can get a general idea of the dishevelled state
of mind in which the less bright and more volatile find
themselves. We've got to the point where we think that nothing
short of a miracle can save civilization. And if the Ford
expedition accomplishes anything, the feat will prove that our
surmise has been correct.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Dorothy Wickes has sold two more pictures for
excellent prices. She has stopped working in the store; has moved
her family to better quarters.</p>

<p>Somehow I had gathered that her older brother Harry was not
passionate on the subject of work. But a chance remark of
Dorothy's, a few months ago, gave me a better impression of the
chap, and I exercised myself a little to find out what he thought
he could do.</p>

<p>Harry said he believed he might be useful in a shop handling
art supplies. I liked this. It has been my observation that when
some member of a family exhibits a special talent, the brothers
and sisters are likely to be jealous. Their favourite method of
showing how they feel about it is to manifest a cool
indifference&mdash;if not positive contempt&mdash;toward
everything related to the fortunate one's art or trade.</p>

<p>Harry Wickes not only didn't have a trace of this sulkiness in
him: he was exultant over the honour that had come to the family;
proud of his sister and intensely interested in what she was
doing. He had no artistic talent himself, but it delighted him
that Dorothy had it. His enthusiasm and glad surprise must have
meant a very great deal to her in those days when she was trying
so hard to express herself. Now he wanted a job selling
drawing-boards, pencils, easels, paints, canvas, and brushes,
because they were the implements of Dorothy's success.</p>

<p>When I learned this, I made an effort to find him a place in
an art shop. He has done very nicely. I think there is a pleasant
future for him in this trade. I see him frequently.</p>

<p>More and more I am believing in what someone has styled "the
contagion of character." And I make a deliberate endeavour to
expose myself, whenever possible, to the influence of people who
possess some peculiar nobility.</p>

<p>I venture to call your attention to the importance of this. Of
course, it would be the very supremacy of selfishness if one were
to pick one's friends on a basis of what they had to give forth.
There are plenty of people, in need of our attention, who have
very little with which to repay us. But I feel that we are well
within our rights if we cultivate the acquaintance of persons
whom we have discovered to be in possession of specialized
talents in the field of character-building. One such acquaintance
may serve as a stimulant to us; another as a sedative. One man
laughs his fears and frets away and another growls at them. It is
fortunate for us if we can recognize the exact effect that other
people have on us. Then we know when to seek or avoid them.</p>

<p>These persons may or may not be of our own social stratum. I
find that I get a good deal of solid satisfaction from people who
seem to live narrowly restricted lives. Some of them are like
beavers. They don't know anything but how to build dams; and, if
their dams are torn down, they begin immediately to build again.
So&mdash;if you find you are no good at building dams, or get too
easily upset when the dams you have built are torn away, you can
learn much by observing the beavers; provided, of course, that
you do not frighten them away.</p>

<p>There is, for example, an orderly at Brightwood named Blake.
He has a fourteen-year-old daughter at home with the mental age
of four. He is quite devoted to her and insists that she is going
to be all right. I listen to him, with sincere interest, whenever
he wants to talk about Dolly, whose name, I think, is singularly
appropriate. No amount of persuasion has succeeded in convincing
him that he should place Dolly in a school for backward children.
He thinks she is better off at home, and&mdash;in the
circumstances&mdash;I agree with him. It may come to pass, some
years from now, that the child will be too grave a problem for
Mert Blake and his wife to handle; but there is plenty of time to
decide on that matter. For the present, the child may as well
stay where she is.</p>

<p>Mert tells me that Dolly is getting on nicely with her
spelling; especially with the names of animals that are not too
difficult. She spelled "mouse," the other day.</p>

<p>Now I don't want you to leap to the conclusion that Mert Blake
is a soft-headed sap with a mentality not much more advanced than
Dolly's. Down inside himself, Mert knows that Dolly hasn't really
grown an inch or gained a pound mentally since she was a mere
tot, and he knows as well as I do that she is never going to know
any more than she knows now. There is a constant ache in Mert's
mind that never eases. It is aching when he wakes up in the
morning, and it is still aching when he goes to sleep at night.
He sees the neighbours' budding young girls, ready for high
school.</p>

<p>And Mert&mdash;who is no fool&mdash;knows that I know all
about Dolly; for I have gone through her with a lantern; and, if
there was anything to be done for her, Mert knows that I should
have had a go at it.</p>

<p>And&mdash;all the time that her is chattering away, with an
optimistic smile, about Dolly's fine progress&mdash;and all the
time that I am punctuating his lively reports with little
exclamations of pleased surprise&mdash;Mert knows that we are
both playing relief parts in a heart-breaking tragedy. I like
Mert because he has the stuff in him that enables him to do that.
Not everyone has an authentic talent for it. I wouldn't exchange
a half hour's chat with Mert Blake for a dozen dinner engagements
with as many brilliant intellectuals.</p>

<p>I have thought that this might be worth mentioning to you. It
has become my practice to nourish my own character by exposing it
to the influence of specially endowed personalities who, by
sublimating their griefs or by inventing ingenious compensatory
devices, have&mdash;unwittingly, perhaps&mdash;made themselves
very important.</p>

<p>It's quite easy to miss chances to improve oneself in this
way. I might have skipped the blessing of Mert Blake's friendship
if it had not been for Tim Watson's remarks to me on the subject
of caste in a hospital. Once upon a time, I should have
considered it the wrong thing to do&mdash;from a standpoint of
good discipline&mdash;to encourage Mert to come into my office
and sit down and talk about Dolly. I have happily graduated from
all such nonsense. And I strongly recommend to you the policy of
establishing close and comradely connections with people who have
something of spiritual fineness in them, regardless of their
social rating. Don't be misled by the fact that the man may use
very faulty diction, and have uncouth manners, and be in need of
a thousand dollars' worth of dental attention. If he is a
spiritual athlete (Can you bear this phrase?), you can afford to
watch him do his tricks.</p>

<p>Most people of our sort pick their friends on a sheer basis of
propinquity, congeniality, and social equality. If you want to
build character, you must not be content to know only persons who
are no stronger than yourself.</p>

<p>Young Wickes' range of interests is not very wide. You
couldn't load what Harry doesn't know about almost everything
into the largest moving-van on the road; but he has got something
in him that I should like to have more of.</p>

<p>I do not believe that I am, by nature or habit, a jealous or
envious person. That is: I do not think that whatever jealousy or
envy I may have tucked away in me is virulent enough to show
through in my bearing and conversation. But&mdash;not to be
envious is, after all, a negative virtue. Wickes has moved over
into the positive zone, in respect to this matter.</p>

<p>He asked me, point-blank, one Saturday night when we were at
dinner together down-town, why I "bothered" with him. And I told
him, with equal candour, that he had been given a clean-cut
talent for magnanimity (which I had to define for him), and that
it built me up, quite a bit, to be in his company. He blinked a
little, but got the idea. I daresay he later examined this gift
of his, in his mirror, and decided to give it a little more air
and light.</p>

<p>Next time I met Dorothy, she said, "What have you done to
Harry?"</p>

<p>"Have I done something to Harry?" I countered.</p>

<p>"You know you have." Her tone was intimate. We were the same
age now. She searched my eyes from under long lashes. "Harry is a
precious darling&mdash;and you are making him more precious,
every day."</p>

<p>"That's nice," I replied. "You ought to know. When a fellow's
sister thinks he is a precious darling "</p>

<p>"I'd like to swap a few stories with you," broke in Dorothy.
"I don't see why we can't. If you'll tell me what you've been
doing to Harry, I'll tell you what I did for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" I pointed my finger directly into her pretty face, and
grew very stern. "<i>Do you want to spoil it?</i>"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Randolph tells me that Natalie and Leslie
Sherman are engaged. I wonder if Leslie knew that Tim was
interested there. I hope he did not.</p>

<p>If Tim has been hurt, you wouldn't know it by his manner. But
he always did have himself well in hand. You could skin him alive
without getting an outcry. I like this about him, though I think
that in order to achieve such distinction a man has to sacrifice
a lot of emotional sensitivity which is really imperative to
normal living. I can't help admiring stoicism in other people,
but I think the overhead charges on its maintenance come pretty
high. You bottle up too many urgent wishes and you can't be sure
whether the chemical reaction is going to make a saint or a
sourpuss.</p>

<p>Whenever a person espouses a martyrdom, he needs to be mighty
careful about the mood in which he goes to the stake. I have
known a lot of fried prigs.</p> <hr>

<h2>BRIGHTWOOD HOSPITAL<br> <i>June seventeenth, 1916, 10.30
p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">NATALIE and Leslie Sherman were married this
evening at the Randolph home. There were only about twenty
guests, but the affair did not lack distinction, the house
beautifully decorated and the excellent dinner served expertly by
the best caterers in town. Natalie, who grows more winsome every
day, was dazzling in white satin and orange blossoms. She had
wanted a church wedding, but economy is in the air just now and
such pageants are not popular.</p>

<p>But while this restriction may have been slightly
disappointing to Natalie, I daresay Leslie was not annoyed by the
fact that he assumes his new obligations at a time when frugality
is fashionable; for, so far as I am aware, he has no resources
beyond his small income at Brightwood.</p>

<p>Tim Watson was Leslie's best man. His athletic figure showed
up to great advantage in his evening clothes. I observed that the
bridesmaids were pleasantly impressed. Whether Tim consented to
stand up with Leslie because (a) he really doesn't care, any
more; or, (b) wanted to prove there was no constraint between him
and his long-time chum; or, (c) thought he would be healthier if
he cauterized his wounds&mdash;nobody is going to know. Tim keeps
his own counsel. Perhaps he is part Indian.</p>

<p>On several occasions in the past few months I have been on the
point of writing something in this book, but most of the things I
might have recorded will be accessible to you elsewhere.</p>

<p>What part we intend to take in the European war has been the
one burning question that monopolizes all conversation. The
controversy between the preparedness advocates and the
peace-at-any-pricers grows more acrimonious; or, rather, the
onslaughts of the militant group against the pacifists are
becoming more savage. The latter are on the defensive; and, I
think, on the decline.</p>

<p>Anyone who would have risked saying, a year ago, in the
conservative atmosphere of St. Paul's Cathedral, that "a pacifist
is an anarchist," might have found himself criticized; but it was
said there, a month ago, and it does not appear that the
statement has been challenged. Thus far have we moved toward a
warlike mind.</p>

<p>Many solidly substantial men, whose normal attitude toward
debatable questions has testified to their sound judgment and
sportsmanly tolerance, have lately given themselves to
expressions of opinions so hot that they sizzle and sputter. A
man can hardly believe his ears. Conservative old codgers, some
of whom have never been notorious for any other extravagance, are
now quoted as making wild remarks utterly foreign to their
training and temperament.</p>

<p>There is manifest, on every hand, a pious lip-service to
patriotism. The theatre orchestra always plays the National
Anthem now, with unprecedented vigour; standing in a row, facing
the audience, and blowing itself pop-eyed and purple, perhaps to
give assurance of its own loyalty, for the names and personal
architecture of many of our professional musicians are
unmistakably Teutonic.</p>

<p>With the unleashing of the brasses and tympani, everyone
bounds to his feet and assumes what feels like a military
posture; stiff, severe, statuesque. Out of the tail of our
patriotic eye, we invoice our neighbour's behaviour in regard to
this solemn rite; and should he be detained by so little as a
split second in displaying a zeal that matches ours&mdash;perhaps
while retrieving his hat from under the seat&mdash;we furtively
analyse his physiognomy to see if he is something other than pure
Nordic.</p>

<p>We have also learned to salute the flag more ceremoniously.
which is doubtless good for us. We were always a bit too casual
toward the sacred emblems of our patriotism. But we have been
well cured of that apathy. We now not only pay our own devout
tribute to the Stars and Stripes with deep fervour; we also
scrutinize the other fellow pretty carefully to make sure that
his obeisance has the sanctioned form and substance.</p>

<p>Any man with a German name is out of luck. The fact may be
that Fred Schroeder (unfortunately nicknamed Fritz) is of the
fourth generation of his family since its migration to this
country, and it may be that his grandfather's brave old bones
rest in the National Cemetery at Gettysburg: but nobody is going
to listen to Fritz while he explains that America is his native
land. Fritz is regarded with suspicion. If&mdash;alarmed over his
unhappy situation&mdash;he seeks to mend matters by spelling his
name "Shrader," we conclude that he did have something to be
frightened about, and a self-deputized committee of
super-patriots visits his meat shop to challenge his loyalty.
Children on the school playground boo and catcall at his hapless
little Gretchen.</p>

<p>It has occurred to me that a few of these minor tragedies of
the war might well be mentioned here. As for the more epochal
events, you will learn them from other sources. But perhaps
history will not bother to reconstruct the atmosphere in which we
are living now. Here we are, riddled by factional disputes, angry
and distrustful; humiliating honest people with whom we never had
a quarrel and for whom we had respect, all because of a war four
thousand miles away.</p>

<p>If we can contrive to get ourselves into such a mental state
as this&mdash;before taking up arms&mdash;I wonder what may
happen to our skittish brains in the event we decide to toss
ourselves into it.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">The American is not a very good hater, perhaps
for lack of time. To be a really competent hater, you have to
give yourself to it with earnest diligence. You can't hate
efficiently and get much else attended to, for you have very
little nervous energy left over. A man will burn less carbon
while sawing wood than while maintaining a steady, glowing
hatred.</p>

<p>Our people have always been anxious to succeed in their
business undertakings. To make money, acquire property, equip for
a rainy day, and have something to bequeath to the children, has
been of more importance to us than the relative superiorities of
races and nations. We are all comparatively recent imports from
ancient lands. Most of us rejoice that it is our happy lot to
have escaped from worn-out soils and age-long feuds. If we could
sell a man something, at a profit, we didn't care what language
he spoke; nor did we inquire into his former loyalties and
inherited antipathies. It was our boast that these things were
so. It was our first point of national distinction&mdash;the
ability of all these polyglot, polychrome people to live together
in neighbourly fashion. We are now in the process of tossing this
unique merit to the winds, and&mdash;whether or not there is to
be war for us&mdash;we are going to regret this tragic
blunder!</p>

<p>Now that it is popular to disparage our own citizens of German
extraction, we have gone into it with a thoroughness that is no
more cruel than ridiculous. We are calling sauerkraut "liberty
cabbage." This, in my opinion, practically completes our recent
struggle to achieve a finished asshood.</p>

<p>But no man, if he values his reputation at all, can afford to
speak his mind on this matter. He mustn't laugh. Indeed&mdash;
however absurd these things are&mdash;he doesn't want to laugh.
It has passed the point of being ludicrous. It isn't funny any
more.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">The dispatches concerning the German army's
inhuman atrocities continue to come, growing in volume and
appalling details; mutilations, crucifixions, eyes gouged out,
hands dismembered. Belgian refugees are coming over; most of them
small children. It is said that some of these unfortunate little
things are without hands, though it has been difficult to locate
anyone who has, himself, seen these cases.</p>

<p>Many of our preparedness orators say that they have talked
personally with people who had seen such mutilations, but I have
not heard any man say that he saw such things with his own
eyes.</p>

<p>Yet the dispatches, reporting such atrocities, come to us with
what appears to be official sanction. While it is very difficult
to believe that any nation in this modern world would resort to
such frightfulness for the sake of terrorizing the enemy, it is
absolutely inconceivable that the high officials of a nation
would deliberately concoct and disseminate such stories about
another nation unless there were properly attested facts to
warrant it.</p>

<p>If Germany has actually committed these crimes, she will have
to pay dearly for them. And if the other people have been
maliciously lying about this, that too will have to be paid for.
No cause can be worth very much that has to win its way by
mutilating civilians and prisoners; nor can any cause be worth
very much that has to win its way by a campaign of wilful
defamation of a nation's character. If it may be assumed that
these premises are sound, I think it is of great importance that
we find out, pretty soon, whether the atrocity stories are true
or false. If true the barbarians should be crushed, no matter
what it costs to do it; if false, any further talk about our side
as "a righteous and holy cause" is, of course, a lot of
hypocritical nonsense; though it would ill become us to criticize
anyone else for hypocrisy&mdash;much less nonsense&mdash;in our
enfeebled mental condition.</p>

<p>My friend&mdash;if I were to hand these pages to a newspaper,
to-night, I should unquestionably spend to-morrow at police
headquarters, trying to give an account of myself. But I want to
document my thoughts about war&mdash;as of this date&mdash;and
put them away for safe-keeping. I have no notion what mood our
nation will be in when you read these words. If the war is over,
and the public's sanity has been approximately restored, you may
not find my opinions on this matter differing very much from the
prevailing thought of your time. If the war is not over&mdash;or
another war is in sight&mdash;you will realize how imprudent it
would be for me to express my feelings publicly. I am a very
unhappy man. I have taken pride in my practice of living above
fear. I have held that if a man is afraid of anything, his fear
filters through everything he thinks and does. And now I think
that I am afraid to stand up and say to my neighbours that I
think war is a degrading thing, that war soils everything it
touches, that no war can be truthfully considered "holy."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">The American Medical Association has been in
convention here since Friday. A couple of distinguished army
surgeons have made speeches; but, in view of our theoretical
neutrality, neither Surgeon General Rupert Blue nor Assistant
Surgeon General Rucker adverted to the war, which I thought was
in excellent taste and a commendable pattern of speech and
behaviour.</p>

<p>Doctor Blue said that the physician's greatest enemies are
ignorance and intemperance. I couldn't help wondering, while he
spoke, whether&mdash;when he referred to intemperance&mdash;he
wasn't thinking of intemperate talk as well as intemperate
habits.</p>

<p>Doctor Charles Mayo made a statement that I find difficult to
understand. He was tracing the progress of the race, particularly
stressing the advancement in medicine and surgery. It was a very
thoughtful address. The conclusions he arrived at, however, were
a bit startling.</p>

<p>"The Slavs," he declared, "will be the coming nation of the
earth."</p>

<p>Surely this is not the logical outcome of the scientific
progress that had been laid before us in such a masterly array of
facts. If the Slavs are to dominate a world that has been blest
by scientific discovery and invention, one naturally gathers that
these people have been and are in the vanguard of this evolution,
and may be expected to rule as a reward for their superior
contributions to our advancement. But I can't recall any
outstanding service that the Slavs have performed in this
field.</p>

<p>The doctor further went on to say that we ourselves are
destined to be a commercial nation of the meanest type. I can't
agree with this, either. Just because we have become temporarily
upset mentally, and have been showing up at a disadvantage, it
does not follow that we have permanently lost our souls. We have
pounded ourselves pretty hard on the subject of our greed, our
frantic grab-and-get ambitions; but I think it should be
remembered that we have been quite soft-hearted toward other
peoples in distress.</p>

<p>I think it was a generous act when we returned the indemnity
to China that had been paid to reimburse us for our losses in
their revolution, asking them to spend the money on scholarships
for their boys. Whenever there has been a great catastrophe
affecting the people of cities and nations thousands of miles
away, we have subscribed huge sums for their relief, without any
other motive than human kindness. I wonder if the Slavs are to
take the lead in world philanthropy. If so, they should get
themselves going in this direction. At present, they do not seem
to know whether they are afoot or horseback.</p>

<p>As a cosmic prophet, I think that Doctor Mayo is one of the
most brilliant surgeons in this country.</p>

<p class="first">I had a few sketches drawn for a cottage on Lake
Saginack, but the time is not propitious. I doubt if I would use
it, even if it were built. Besides, it will be prudent to
economize now. If we have to get into the war, it will be very
costly.</p> <hr>

<h2>HOTEL PONTCHARTRAIN, DETROIT<br> <i>December second, 1917,
8.30 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">I GAVE up housekeeping a week ago, drained the
plumbing, locked the shutters, and moved to this hotel. It wasn't
worth the bother to maintain my establishment, under existing
conditions.</p>

<p>Joyce is at school in Philadelphia&mdash;or I hope she is, the
management having reluctantly consented to let her remain, on
probation, with the understanding that she is to be more
obedient. I have had a merry time, these past few weeks, with
this mischievous young lady who has a gift for getting into
scrapes.</p>

<p>Nate Swihart&mdash;who for the past three years has been my
man of all work&mdash;is at Camp Custer, marching twenty miles
per day with full equipment which, he writes me, includes
everything but the piano. Gladys, his wife and my cook, has been
threatening to die of loneliness and worry, so I have packed her
off to Owosso where she will live with her parents "for the
duration."</p>

<p>My decision to retire from the irksome farce of keeping my
house going was precipitated by the alarming coal shortage. I
have suspected that a good deal of the country's noisy economies,
in recent months, was part of the phenomena of our patriotism;
but the resolve to save coal is certainly not an affectation. The
fuel situation is so grave that unless it is relieved promptly
the factories will have to shut down.</p>

<p>We are all on a war basis now, with everything regimented.
Heatless Mondays, lightless Tuesdays, meatless Fridays. Save
sugar, save butter, save flour, save coal, save peach-stones,
save democracy. Posters everywhere, advising, challenging,
prohibiting, threatening. It is a hell of a way to live, after
one has gone one's own gait for more than two score years.</p>

<p>And yet, if one can endure this temporary sacrifice of
personal liberty, without too much irritation, it has its
commendable points. There is nothing that this country has needed
more than discipline. We have had plenty of laws, but very spotty
enforcement. The average good citizen has fallen into the habit
of obeying such laws as he finds convenient. For the present,
everybody walks the chalk. Unquestionably this gives us more
respect for the government, and for ourselves too.</p>

<p>This generation of children has had a minimum of supervision,
either at home where their parents are too busy or too
pleasure-loving to oversee their conduct, or at school where the
new psychology encourages Junior to express himself. It is the
first unspanked generation in the history of the world. Now that
military mores have the right of way, even the little children
are readjusting their ideas to fit the time.</p>

<p>One would have thought that our soldiers, suddenly tugged out
of their civilian freedom to be barked at by cocky young
sergeants, might have resented such treatment; but they seem to
have accepted it as good sports, and when hard put upon they
sing, "We're in the army now." And so are all the rest of us in
the army now&mdash;or what comes to the same thing. Little Junior
eats his oats without grousing, having been sharply informed that
he should be mighty thankful he has oats to eat, seeing what the
Belgian children are living on. And Junior's erstwhile
bridge-playing mother works all day at Red Cross Headquarters
making bandages and other hospital necessities, while Junior's
father is losing his excess fat as he gallops about selling
Liberty bonds. The whole family is invigorated.</p>

<p>I find democracy a more comfortable form of government, but
there is no denying the fact that this temporary autocracy has
been beneficial to most of our people. The majority of us
indulged ourselves too much. We have overheated our houses in
winter. We have eaten too much meat and sugar and white bread.
Moreover, we have lacked a unifying motive to stimulate our herd
loyalty. Many people were too individualistic for their own good,
striving for some manner of uniqueness which often resulted in
mere silly posing.</p>

<p>You might be amazed at the difference all this has made in the
public health. Fully a third of the rooms at Brightwood are
unoccupied. My own business has not been affected, one way or the
other, diseases of the brain not seeming to discriminate much
between peace-time and war-time; but Pyle's days are not so
crowded, nor Carter's, nor Jennings's.</p>

<p>Perhaps it has not been such a bad thing for us to have had a
sniff of dictatorial, militarized government, after so long an
experience of an easy-going democracy. Of course, the thing is a
novelty now, amply justified by an emergency. We might fret under
it if it were permanent. We might even fret under it now, if we
feared it might become permanent.</p>

<p>And it might easily become permanent, I think. The federal
government has discovered how simply and promptly it can get
whatever it wants. The states have largely waived their
accustomed rights to exercise their individual prerogatives,
willing to conform to orders from The Top, for the sake of
expediency. To-day, if the national government resolves upon some
drastic action at ten o'clock, it publishes the decree at eleven,
and by noon the thing is in full operation in high gear.</p>

<p>This naturally pleases the government, whose power is now
concentrated, and it must be of immense gratification to be able
to shout an order to a hundred million people and hear an
immediate "Aye, aye, sir!" I surmise that the federal government
will be very reluctant to hand this privilege back to the states,
after the present emergency is over.</p>

<p>I do not pretend to know very much about the philosophy of
history. I am not sure that anyone knows much about it, judging
from the wide divergence of expert opinion on the subject. But I
think it is generally agreed that democracy is not a hardy
perennial. Even a temporary compromise of democracy endangers its
life. It wouldn't surprise me if&mdash; when the war is
ended&mdash;we never fully recover the liberties we have given
up. Whether it would be a good thing to have a permanent
concentration of more power in the national capital would depend,
of course, upon the manner in which such power was exercised. If
the leadership was wise and just, you might get a better
government than was had under the old system. There is something
to be said for a benevolent despotism. The trouble is to find
your benevolent despot.</p>

<p>I should give a good deal to know how all this is coming out.
Washington is packed and jammed with government employees. When
the war is over, I wonder whether these extra thousands will be
willing to go back to their homes and resume their former
occupations.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Shortly after war was declared, I presented
myself for service as a surgeon, and was promptly
rejected&mdash;as I had anticipated&mdash;on account of the
faulty heart. Owens, of the Medical Examining Board, kindly
attempted to condole with me over my rejection, but I assured him
that I was quite contented to remain in my hospital and do my
accustomed work.</p>

<p>I could afford to be entirely honest in making this statement,
for the question of a doctor's courage in enlisting for service
was not at issue. The army doctor's personal risk is negligible.
He is not a combatant. He is probably as safe in the camp
hospital as he is at home.</p>

<p>Pyle registered as willing to go, but the board put him on the
reserve list, on account of his age, and he will not be called.
They have plenty of doctors.</p>

<p>Tim Watson was promptly accepted and is at Fort Sheridan where
his duties are light and not very interesting. Tim has always
been very ambitious, especially in developing his surgery. At
present he is mainly occupied with administering cathartics and
looking at lame feet. If he is sent abroad, it will be a
different story; but, until now, he is doing nothing that
couldn't be done as well by a trained nurse. When he wrote me
this, I requested that he be released on leave, for important
work at Brightwood. It was thirty days before I had a reply, but
when it came it was a most impressive document&mdash;an assembly
of printed forms, duly stamped and signed by a dozen officials
located in district, regional, and national headquarters. The
upshot of the voluminous communication&mdash;which I did not take
time to read in full&mdash;was that my request could not be
granted; so Tim stays by his castor oil bottle and acknowledges
the salutes of tired youngsters who have stubbed a toe.</p>

<p>Leslie Sherman is at Camp Custer. I don't think the war has
discommoded him seriously. Natalie is living at the Post Tavern
in Battle Creek, and Leslie sees her every day or two. Randolph
has closed up his house and is living in New York.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">It is of much interest to me, in these days, to
note what the sudden imputation of military authority is doing to
different types of men.</p>

<p>For many years I have preserved a delightful friendship with a
man named Zimmerman, who lives in Ann Arbor. We were quite
comradely during our freshman and sophomore years. Dan got into
the manufacturing business and became very well-to-do. He was a
fine executive.</p>

<p>He has always taken a vital interest in military affairs, and
has ranked high in the National Guard. When the Officers'
Training School was opened at Plattsburg, Dan was early on the
ground. Then he was sent to Texas, during our difficulty with
Mexico. Now he is at Camp Custer, a major.</p>

<p>I was called over there a few weeks ago on a professional
errand which concerned a young non-com in Dan's outfit, and
learned that his men were sincerely devoted to the major and
proud to be under his command. He came into the room, while I was
in the camp hospital, and exhibited the same concern for the
young patient that he might have shown toward a nephew. Everybody
had stood at attention when Dan strode in, tall, bronzed,
physically fit. I liked the gentle tone with which he said,
"Please be at ease." I don't think he lost a mite of
prestige.</p>

<p>Now&mdash;Dan Zimmerman, I happen to know, is not much of a
back-slapper. He is essentially an aristocrat, lives in a
palatial home, moves in an exclusive social set, and has the
general bearing of an English squire. At a hasty glance, you
might have guessed that there would be a pretty wide gap between
this major and the rookies. But Dan, without the sacrifice of his
authority or any negligence in discipline, had his men welded
into one solid chunk&mdash;and all of them ready to follow him
anywhere.</p>

<p>It is going to be good for these chaps to have this sort of
association with aristocracy at its best. They can't help being
finer men after having observed the effortless sportsmanship of
Dan Zimmerman. He wore his uniform as if he had been born in it;
and, because it came naturally to him to obey and command, he
inspires not only confidence and loyalty, but affection.</p>

<p>A few blocks from Brightwood Hospital there is a high-class
food store. The manager is an amiable and hard-working fellow
named Brink. Jim Brink has grown up with the business, and knows
all about it. His clientele is composed mostly of wealthy people
who know exactly what they like in the way of delicacies and are
able to pay for them; or, at least to order them and consume
them, though I suspect that Jim carries on his books a good many
assets which would make a banker laugh.</p>

<p>I shouldn't think of envying Jim his job. All day long, for
years, he could be found saying&mdash;to customers quite too
valuable to be handled by a mere sales-person&mdash;"Yes,
indeed, Mrs. Northby, if we haven't got it, we will find it for
you."&mdash;"Yes, yes, Mrs. Highwall, we will make a special
delivery, of course. Thank you! Thank you&mdash;very, very
much!"</p>

<p>It was difficult to imagine Jim in any other setting than his
snobbish shop; but, to the amazement of everybody, he decided
that the government needed him badly. He went to Grayling to
train. He is at Camp Custer, now, with the rank of second
lieutenant.</p>

<p>Not very long ago, a private in his company, on leave for a
day to visit a sick relative, got into a trolley accident a few
miles from here and was seriously hurt. Because it was thought he
had a skull fracture, they brought him to Brightwood. The head
injury did not amount to much, so Pyle put him together again, a
tedious job, for the young fellow was broken in a half-dozen
places.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Lieutenant Brink showed up at the hospital.
Announcing at the desk that he had come for the private, whose
name I have forgotten, he was referred to Doctor Pyle, who at the
moment was with me in an operation. Informed that he would have
to wait a little while, the lieutenant became very much annoyed;
came up to the operating-room, pushed the nurse out of the way
who told him he must not come in, and stalked&mdash;booted,
belted, spurred, and bright-buttoned&mdash;to the side of the
table.</p>

<p>Pyle, half-stunned over this amazing impudence, glanced up and
said, "Why&mdash;Good morning, Jim."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Brink, sir, if you please," snapped Jim. "I have
come for Private (whatever-his-name was)."</p>

<p>"You had better leave him for another week or ten days,"
advised Pyle, swallowing his indignation. "He isn't able to
travel yet."</p>

<p>"I shall be the judge of that," growled Jim. "Where is
he?"</p>

<p>This was too much for Pyle, who is not accustomed to this kind
of talk, and he exploded.</p>

<p>"You get out of here, Brink! You know better than to invade an
operating-room in street clothes. Just because you've harnessed
yourself up in leather&mdash; "</p>

<p>"That will do!" broke in Jim, shrilly. "I want my
man&mdash;and if you don't take me to him I shall put you under
arrest."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Pyle, breathing hard, "you arrest me&mdash;
and we'll see what comes of it."</p>

<p>Jim stiffly consented to wait until the operation was over,
but insisted on taking his cripple away with him in a taxi; had
to have him lifted in, though he himself did not assist. Pyle
thought he might have to go to Battle Creek and make
explanations, but heard no more about it.</p>

<p>So&mdash;here we have a pretty nice little problem in
psychology. It doesn't require very shrewd deduction. Jim Brink
is compensating for years and years of boot-licking. A few months
ago, he was the most obsequious little yes-yesser in this town; a
grinning, fawning, stickily sweet toadier who always seemed to be
saying, "No bother at all. Glad to do it, I assure you. And you
may kick me if you want to." Now he is a disgusting type of the
<i>brute in buttons!</i> I suppose it is one of the hazards of
war that impressionable young men have to be exposed to close-up
contacts with freshly hatched officers who are trying to mend
their damaged personalities after long and bitter experience in
some relationship where they have played expertly the role of
whipping-boy.</p>

<p>I am told that cases of this sort, while far from being in the
majority&mdash;thank God!&mdash;are frequent enough to constitute
a menace to the efficiency of the army; for a contemptible fellow
like that couldn't hope to enlist the honest loyalty of his
subordinates, and wouldn't dare lead the way for his men in
battle where so many accidents have been known to happen to
officers who had earned the hatred and contempt of their
troops.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">It has been interesting to note the predictions
of our local prophets in respect to the ultimate good that is to
result from the World War. They seem generally agreed that
civilization will take a fresh grip on itself and march forward
into a new day.</p>

<p>I haven't been to any of the churches, but I read reports of
the sermons in the papers. They are very heartening; perhaps a
bit too optimistic. I have clipped a few of these pulpit
observations, and am going to record them briefly here. When you
read this, you will note that we are fairly hopeful of the
future, and justify the savage means by the noble end to be
achieved.</p>

<p>One prominent minister said, not long ago, "There are signs
now which indicate that every autocracy will be driven from the
earth through the agency of this war, and that government of the
people, for the people, and by the people will be established
everywhere. At the close of the war there will be a greater
brotherhood of individuals and nations than the world has ever
known." Perhaps this is a pretty tall order, but it seems to meet
with general approval. Everybody thinks the war should do us all
a lot of good. I hope so.</p>

<p>Another preacher declared, "This great conflict is hastening
the coming of Jesus in his reign over mankind. It will end in his
crowning as King of Kings and Lord of Lords." This strikes me as
being a bit hysterical, to say nothing about its being illogical.
I can't think that a world-wide acceptance of the Galilean
teacher would be the natural outcome of a general war. War
doesn't seem to be the right build-up for it. Of course it is
conceivable that everybody will be so weary and hurt and
remorseful, when it is done with, that we will all resolve to
follow a different program in the future. But it is certainly a
hope that has little encouragement from history. All sorts of
special interests are banking on the war to solve their assorted
problems. One preacher sees the complete abrogation of class
distinctions, another forecasts the end of disputes between
capital and labour. Life in the trenches, where rich and poor
have mingled their blood in a common cause, will bring about an
enduring brotherhood. Maybe there is some sound sense to this. At
all events, we are taking much comfort in the thought.</p>

<p>I see that a Mrs. Kohut&mdash;a prominent leader in Jewish
education&mdash;speaking at the Temple Beth El, said, "The war
will develop an international psychology which will end forever
the persecution of our race." This, I feel, is worth looking
forward to; for the Jew has surely taken an awful lot of beating,
in the past dozen centuries, and I expect he will be right
thankful to get some sound insurance against any more of it in
the future.</p>

<p>There are a good many howls for revenge and punishment which,
it seems to me, would be more fitly spoken in camp than in
church. One parson is quoted as saying, "The war must go on until
Germany is on her knees begging for mercy and the militarists are
punished in their persons for their hellish wrongs." This chap is
probably not a bad fellow when things are normal, but his value
as a leader of people's thinking&mdash;in a time of
excitement&mdash;is questionable. I surmise that he is the sort
of chap who, when the house is on fire, would throw the baby out
the window and carry its cradle downstairs in his arms. As a
spokesman for Christ, who said to his enemies, "Father, forgive
them for they know not what they do," this brother seems to be
slightly off the old reservation.</p>

<p>New York papers quote one of their eminent clergymen as
shouting in his pulpit, "To hell with the Kaiser!" I have, often
wondered whether, with all the accumulated inhibitions of speech
and conduct laid upon him, a preacher might not sometimes wish
that an occasion would arise permitting him to let himself out a
little. Doubtless it was the irksomeness of a steady devotion to
piety that led the medieval sculptors&mdash;at work on stone
angels, apostles, martyrs, and such things, for the great
cathedrals&mdash;to have each his own pet rock, out in the back
yard, on which he operated for amusement, off hours. These
sculptors probably got so damn sick of the uprolled eyes and
penitential smirks of the saints that they had to do a grotesque
and sinister gargoyle to restore their emotional balance. This
war has given the preachers a chance to yell "hell," "damnation,"
and "filthy swine!" It is in questionable taste, but probably
provides a sort of much needed neural laxative, human nature
being such as it is.</p>

<p>I do not possess a monopoly of this thought. Last week I
attended a luncheon in Ann Arbor, of doctors and University
executives. In the course of general talk about the table,
somebody referred to the wild intemperance of speech in the
pulpits, and President Hutchins dignifiedly observed,
"Yes&mdash;the war has been a Godsend to the preachers."</p>

<p>I should have liked to hear him express his opinions on the
subject a little more fully. Hutchins is one of the wisest men I
know. The University has been very fortunate in her choice of
presidents. Everyone feared, when Doctor Angell retired, that it
would be difficult to find anyone who could so widely command the
love and esteem that he had earned. Hutchins has it. It does me
good to be in his presence. This man has ballast! It is a great
blessing that a person of his august mind directs the University
in these trying days.</p> <hr>

<h2>BRIGHTWOOD HOSPITAL<br> <i>October sixteenth, 1918, 2
a.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">I HAVE not been outside for three days. This
hospital is a pesthouse. Every available inch is filled with
influenza victims.</p>

<p>It may seem odd to you that I am taking time, in this
distressing situation, to make an entry in my long neglected
journal; but, utterly fagged as I am, I cannot sleep. Neither can
I think about anything else but this catastrophe. So I shall
briefly record what is going on here&mdash;and
everywhere&mdash;all over the country.</p>

<p>This is by far the worst scourge that our people have ever
known. We have had sporadic epidemics of "flu" for many years,
but not this type. Usually the disease, in its primary stages,
has been hardly distinguishable from a stubborn cold. It would
drag along for weeks, leaving the patient a depleted prey to
whatever he was naturally vulnerable; arthritis, sinus and
mastoid troubles&mdash;or, indeed, almost anything; heart,
sometimes. Now and then a pneumonia developed. It was a tedious
thing; particularly hard on elderly people and others with low
vitality.</p>

<p>The influenza we have now is swift and savage. One of its
peculiarities is the high rate of mortality among young people.
The better equipped they are with physical resources, the more
promptly it consumes them. It is mowing down the young doctors
and nurses in appalling numbers. You may use your imagination on
what is happening in these big cantonments where&mdash;even at
their best&mdash;the camp hospital is more or less makeshift and
not rigged to care for a large-scale pestilence.</p>

<p>The disease gives very brief warning. It strikes a hard blow.
The patient melts like wax under high temperatures, while you
stand there helpless. Nothing does any good. If it was smallpox,
we would know what to do.</p>

<p>In any other circumstance, I should have gone to Battle Creek
to-day&mdash;yesterday&mdash;to be present when they shipped
Leslie Sherman's body back to his family home in Bay City. He was
sick, in the crowded camp hospital, only four days. I couldn't
leave Brightwood. There was nothing I could have done for him,
anyway. The doctors over there know as much about this deadly
stuff as I do; more, maybe; certainly no less. You can't subtract
anything from nothing.</p>

<p>I have just been talking with the Battle Creek Sanatorium.
They say Natalie is holding her own; perhaps rallying a little,
though you can't count much on the usual signs for encouragement.
Your patient will seem to have passed a crisis; temperature
begins to recede; you begin to take heart. In an hour or two your
patient is subnormal; other customary warning-signs absent; no
cyanosis, no Cheyne-Stokes respiration. Now your man is alive;
now he is dead. Just like that.</p>

<p>Randolph had just arrived from New York; quite unfit to
travel. They had put him to bed. Natalie has not been told about
Leslie. I shall call up again in the morning.</p>

<p>We are growing seriously short of help here. We have five
nurses in bed. I know that McDermott was running a temperature
to-night, though he denied it and got almost peevish when I
accused him of it.</p>

<p>The papers are quoting various persons as believing that the
flu germs were released in several regional centres in this
country by enemy agents. I suspect that this is a precious lot of
poppycock. We have been imputing to the Germans a great deal more
ingenuity than they possess.</p>

<p>I had a comforting telegram from Joyce to-night. She has spent
her first month in Capital Seminary; and, from early reports, I
honestly believe we have struck the right place for her. It is
the first time she has ever seemed to be contented in school.</p>

<p>Recent letters extol the charm of the teachers and the
comradeliness of the girls. Joyce writes that each new girl is
assigned a Junior adviser, who gives her helpful hints about her
studies, her manners, and her adjustment to the school's
regulations. This seems a desirable arrangement, especially in
our case, for we have had a difficult time in as many as three
reputable schools, and if we can contrive to keep our footing now
it will be a great comfort to a lot of people&mdash;including the
young lady's papa.</p>

<p>During the past couple of weeks I have been hearing much about
Joyce's beautiful mentor. My child's description of this Miss
Brent involves a string of adjectives not often used except in
services of worship. I hope Joyce's infatuation is not a mere
passing fancy. If she will hang on to the Brent girl, and accept
her counsel, for love's sake, perhaps we will have solved our
problem. I hope so. It's about time!</p>

<p>The teachers at Capital Seminary have had the good sense to
prohibit the girls from going into any public places, since the
epidemic set in; and, so far, they are free of it. I am mighty
glad that Joyce is fairly well insured against it. This is, at
least, something to be thankful for, in my distress over
conditions here with which I cannot cope.</p>

<p>I must resume my too great burden now. I have rested for an
hour. Nancy Ashford consented to go to bed at midnight. She is
completely tuckered out; but, so far, unaffected by The
Thing.</p> <hr>

<h2>HOTEL PONTCHARTRAIN<br> <i>November eleventh, 1918,
Midnight</i></h2>

<p class="first">THE war is over. We thought so last Thursday,
but the announcement was premature. This time the news seems to
be authentic.</p>

<p>The celebration began long before daybreak and still continues
with remarkable vigour. It is growing hoarse, and a bit rowdy,
but it has a good deal of vitality left; enough, I think, to keep
everybody in this hotel awake all night.</p>

<p>We are calling what has happened the "armistice." I'll bet
there aren't forty people in Detroit who had ever used that word
in a sentence until a few days ago. I'll bet also that
ninety-five per cent of the population had never heard the word
before. Two thirds of them don't know now what it means. All they
care is that it stands for Peace. Germany has asked for an
armistice, which means that the war is over! Nobody has bothered
to look up the word, which means "a truce; a temporary cessation
of hostilities."</p>

<p>There will be a conference of the powers to determine what
manner of peace terms are to be offered to Germany, and it is
expected that such terms&mdash;whatever they are&mdash;will be
accepted, for Germany is not in a position to put up much of a
debate on this subject. If the Allies want to, they can strip
Germany clean to the hide. And I suppose a great deal of pressure
will be put upon the council to do that. In their present temper,
the people of the Entente will not be very magnanimous.</p>

<p>Personally, I think there is something to be said for the old
Chinese doctrine of "face-saving." So often I have seen how
nicely this works out in man-to-man relationships. I wonder why
it might not be practicable in the settlement of difficulties
between nations.</p>

<p>There is nothing worse that can be done to an individual than
the destruction of his self-respect. Of course, if he wrongs you,
it is just and right that he make amends. But I think great care
should be exercised that his personal pride is not destroyed. In
the heat of passion, you may get some satisfaction from seeing
him down on all fours with his chin in the mud, confessing that
he is a lousy scoundrel, unfit for association with decent men.
But the trouble is that after you have done that to him he has
nothing more to lose; and a man who has nothing to lose makes a
very mean antagonist.</p>

<p>I think that when Grant told Lee to keep his sword, thus
implying that he had been at war with a brave man, a gentleman
whom he respected, his act was of priceless value in the
unprecedented rapid healing of the wound between the North and
the South. Grant had a chance that day&mdash;and I daresay he
would have had a lot of applause from short-sighted people,
clamorous for a long-term vengeance&mdash;Grant had a chance to
humiliate Lee by a display of cocky arrogance, and make the South
sore forever and ever! I never realized how much was at stake
there until I began to speculate on the present problem abroad.
Grant was a great man, that day!</p>

<p>Then he told Lee that the Confederates could take their horses
home with them, and whatever other equipment was needful on their
farms, as to say that the South&mdash;far from being
ruined&mdash;would now be resuming the usual activities.</p>

<p>Looking back on it from this safe distance, I think we have
been disposed to minify the enmity generated by that war. It was
a hard-fought thing, and the mutual hatred it developed was
fierce, passionate, virulent. But it was not contemptuous. That
was what ultimately saved the Union. People can fight and hate
each other, and get over it, so long as they concede
gallantry.</p>

<p>I hope this magnanimity may be observed when the peace is made
in Europe. Otherwise, "armistice"&mdash;in this case&mdash;may
eventually mean no more than it means in the dictionary.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">The flu, which strikes fast and hard, has eased
up appreciably, at Brightwood, anyhow, where the number of new
cases is falling off. Things are by no means normal, but they are
so much better that we are beginning to breathe more freely.
Doubtless this diminution of the epidemic may be attributed to
the city's strict quarantine enforcement, and the closing of
theatres, churches, and other places of public assembly where the
contagion operated at a deadly advantage.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Dorothy Wickes came to the hospital this
afternoon to tell me that Harry, who is in France with the
Rainbow Division, was well and in good spirits when she last
heard from him, a letter dated October thirteenth. Naturally, she
was rejoicing over the peace, and the prospect of having her
brother back home in the near future.</p>

<p>"Of course," she admitted, suddenly shadowed, "some terrible
things could have happened to him since that letter was written;
but"&mdash;brightening quickly&mdash;"I have a feeling that he is
safe." Then she asked, soberly, "You believe in hunches; don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Well," I replied, cautiously, "I believe in my own
hunches."</p>

<p>"Did a hunch ever let you down?" she asked, childishly.</p>

<p>'Yes," I confessed. "Occasionally."</p>

<p>"Do you have a hunch that Harry is coming home?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, adding that I hadn't really laid hold on any
deep convictions about it; but, now that she asked me, I felt
quite confident I should be seeing Harry again.</p>

<p>"I have that hunch too," said Dorothy. "Don't you think that
two hunches are better than one?"</p>

<p>"Twice as good," I declared, reasonably enough, I thought.</p>

<p>There was a little pause before Dorothy inquired, with blue
eyes wide, "Where do hunches come from?"</p>

<p>I toyed with my watch-chain and smiled ineffectively.</p>

<p>"I've noticed that whenever you're stuck," drawled Dorothy,
with the bland impudence of a five-year-old, "you begin to wonder
what time it is. Does that watch trick of yours mean that you
want to get rid of me; or, do you do that when you're
alone&mdash;and stuck?"</p>

<p>Never having examined myself on this matter before, I
hesitated in replying, a chink she promptly filled with "But
maybe you're never stuck&mdash;when you're alone." And when I
failed to answer quickly she added, "Are you?"</p>

<p>Now, ordinarily, I should find this sort of impertinence very
annoying and would make an effort to discourage any more of it;
but Dorothy Wickes and I are close friends, in spite of the
disparity of our ages. I like her immensely, partly because she
is such a lovely creature, and mostly because she is so
sensible.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "I get stuck when I am alone. Just at the
moment I am feeling quite jubilant over the prospect of being
unstuck from a problem that accounts for much of this gray
hair."</p>

<p>"Hunch?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"A little better than a hunch."</p>

<p>"Want to take your hair down?" she inquired,
companionably.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon?" I said&mdash;unfamiliar with the phrase which
appears to be a recent device when inviting a confidence.</p>

<p>"I mean," explained Dorothy, with a puckery-lipped grin, "do
you want to tell all? If so&mdash;I have plenty of time."</p>

<p>"It's about my daughter," I said. "She has been away, nearly
all of the time, for years, in girls' schools, because she has no
mother and I could not give her the attention she needed."</p>

<p>And then I proceeded to give Dorothy, who was most attentive,
a fairly comprehensive sketch of my anxieties&mdash;through the
years&mdash;winding up happily with my recent assurance that
things might now be much less troublesome.</p>

<p>"Of course," I added, "I cannot expect this Miss Brent to be
at Joyce's elbow twenty-four hours of the day. There's the
Christmas vacation, for instance. Joyce will come home. This
young set that she was training with, last summer, may upset
everything."</p>

<p>"Perhaps this Miss Brent could come home with her as a guest
through the holidays," ventured Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Not very likely," I said, doubtfully. "All of two years
difference in their ages. This girl probably has her own home and
friends. But&mdash;it's well worth looking into."</p>

<p>"I should think," said Dorothy, "that if Miss Brent has had
such an unusual influence on Joyce, she might be willing to make
a little sacrifice of her own holiday pleasure. Maybe it could be
put up to her on that basis."</p>

<p>"You are about her age," I said. "What would you think if
somebody made such a proposal to you?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if I was aware of all the circumstances, and
believed that I might help, I think I would do it. And"&mdash;she
added&mdash;"I've a hunch that Miss Brent will do it&mdash;if she
can. She must be a pretty good sort, or she couldn't have had
this effect on Joyce."</p>

<p>I said I would take her advice, and see what comes of it. I
wrote to Joyce this evening, asking her if she would like to
invite her friend here for the holidays. Joyce will undoubtedly
consent. I hope it works out. I should be glad to see this
interesting girl, myself.</p>

<p>I said as much to Dorothy, before she left, this afternoon,
and she grinned impishly.</p>

<p>"But I suppose you haven't any hunches about that?" she
teased.</p>

<p>"If you are implying that I might become interested in Miss
Brent for any other reason than the one you know," I said, "it
may clear the air for you if you remember that I am twice as old
as this young lady."</p>

<p>Dorothy poised her head on one side, wisely, and said, "Even
so&mdash;there's no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No fool like an old fool," I assisted.</p>

<p>"Suppose I had said that," chided Dorothy.</p>

<p>"It would have been true," I declared.</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't have liked it."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;no; perhaps not."</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME &mdash;<br> <i>January twenty-eighth, 1919, 10
p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">FOR quite too long a time my entries in this
journal have been a dismal record of tragic events.</p>

<p>I am not by nature a morbid person and I have had no pleasure
in reporting these various frights and frets, but they have
bulked so large, during these past few years, that it was
impossible to ignore them.</p>

<p>I have made sketchy notes on the war, or such aspects of it as
might be remarked by a remote spectator. I have dragged you
through at least the edge of our devastating pestilence. I have
occasionally adverted to my personal perplexities, chief of which
was my worry about my wilful child.</p>

<p>It will gratify you to learn, after wading through this almost
interminable wilderness of woe, that my mind is now more at ease
than it has been for a quadrennium.</p>

<p>Of course the one overpowering torture that had dwarfed all
other agonies was the war. We are done with that now, and a sort
of peace has been arranged for. You will have been fully informed
about that, so I shall add nothing farther about the nature of
this peace, except to say that many thoughtful people are
wondering whether it gives promise of durability.</p>

<p>It seemed to be taken by common consent, the world over, that
our President would guide the deliberations of the Peace
Conference. This seems rather strange, too, for Mr. Wilson made
no bones about his hope that this parley would establish a
working agreement for international amity in the future, rather
than to conduct an autopsy over the late German Empire.</p>

<p>It must have been a serious disillusionment to this lonesome
idealist when he discovered that the delegates had not assembled
primarily to implement a practical peace, but to punish a beaten
foe. If correctly reported, that Conference must have resembled
nothing quite so much as an avaricious group of expectant
brothers and sisters, cousins and second cousins, nephews and
nieces, in-laws (and outlaws), convened to divide among
themselves the realty and personal effects of a stricken relative
who had died intestate.</p>

<p>Once this division of property is amicably agreed upon, and
everyone has made off with his share, it may be presumed that the
peace has been concluded. This arrangement, however, is shakily
founded upon the belief that our belligerent relative is indeed
deceased. Should it turn out that he is not dead but only in a
deep coma from which he may emerge some day, it is not
inconceivable that he may insist upon a restoration of his
goods.</p>

<p>With customary generosity, the United States has not asked for
so much as an old brass hat, for a souvenir; and, in token of
their appreciation of our magnanimity, the other surviving
relatives have voted us the privilege of financing a good deal of
the expense incident to the last illness, until such time as our
kinfolk can conveniently liquidate.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson has found himself in the awkward position of having
proposed to the enemy peace terms which he is now unable to
confirm. I suppose the main trouble here grew out of the fact
that he made this tentative offer on his own hook, without making
doubly sure that his proposals would be approved at home and
abroad. If this was a blunder, I can see how a man might easily
make such a mistake with the very best intentions in the world.
Because it was a time of great stress, everybody had been willing
to confer unprecedented power upon the President. The only way
you could insure a solid front and a steady drive was to let the
President hold all the reins.</p>

<p>I surmise that almost any man, empowered with such authority,
might come to feel that suggestions and queries and
counsel&mdash;however well meant&mdash;were distracting
annoyances which shouldn't be added to his already crushing load.
Of course, his attitude&mdash;in that event&mdash;presupposes
that this one man&mdash;and he alone&mdash;can provide the
necessary wisdom and direction. Any practicing psychiatrist will
tell you that no man can carry a burden like that very far
without crumpling under it.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">As for the epidemic, it has been considerably
relieved. I don't think we learned much about it. I'm sure I
didn't. When fatal, it almost invariably wound up in a swift
pneumonia. Whether these pneumonias were all of the same type, I
do not know. They were similar in their deadly effectiveness.</p>

<p>My most grievous personal loss, during the worst of this
plague, was occasioned by the death of my valued friend Clive
Randolph. He practically reorganized my life. He helped me to
whatever I am and have. It is difficult to believe that he is
gone. His spirit was so bright with light and energy that one
can't consent to its being extinguished. Nor can one be quite
contented with the thought that Randolph will continue to speak
through the lives he has illumined. Perhaps this sort of
immortality should suffice for any man. But&mdash;even
so&mdash;it is not easy to dispose of Randolph by declaring him
henceforth an inspiring memory in the minds of grateful friends.
Personal survival is a baffling doctrine, hard to accept. But,
for me, it is more worthy of credence than the thought that
Randolph, as a person, has readied the end of his life. I have no
convictions about heavenly harps, streets of gold, or any
celestial properties or employments. I have no guess to offer
concerning Randolph's present abode or manner of living. But I
strongly suspect that&mdash;somewhere, somehow&mdash;he is alive.
If this seems unscientific, and lacking in sound evidence, keep
it in mind that until you have stood by the open grave of a
cherished friend the testimony in favour of immortality is not
yet all in.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Natalie's convalescence was naturally retarded
by the shock of her bereavement. To have lost her husband and her
father within a few days, and in circumstances which made it
impossible for her to be with them, was an almost insurmountable
grief. It must be said for her, however, that Natalie's
acceptance of this tragedy was a credit to her training and her
personal character.</p>

<p>By the middle of December she was sufficiently recovered to
leave the Sanatorium. I had visited her there several times. She
had told me of her intention to go to Denver for a few weeks with
an uncle and aunt who lived there. But shortly before it was time
for her to start, Natalie had word that her uncle was ill.
Realizing that she would be only an additional burden to her
relatives at this time, she accepted my invitation to come to
Detroit and remain through the holidays.</p>

<p>I reopened the house, sent for Gladys, found some additional
help, and prepared&mdash;not without some uneasiness&mdash;to
entertain three young women; Natalie, physically frail and
emotionally upset; Joyce, who might or might not manage to adjust
herself to the mood of a recently bereaved guest; and Miss Brent,
whom I had never seen and whose reaction to this delicate
situation was indeterminable, though&mdash;from what Joyce had
written of her&mdash;I was willing, in advance, to give her the
benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>Natalie was with me for three days before the school girls
arrived. I brought a lively young nurse over from Brightwood,
rather for my unhappy guest's entertainment than any need of
professional care. It was natural, I think, that Natalie should
have talked quite freely to me, almost as if I were a relative.
She seemed eager to discuss future plans. Her father had confided
to her the general nature of the estate she would inherit. It was
pleasant, but not surprising, to learn that Randolph had amply
provided for her. There was some valuable real estate, besides
their home which would be easily marketable in case Natalie
decided to give it up&mdash;as she undoubtedly would; a
respectable list of conservative stocks and bonds, and fifty
thousand dollars worth of life insurance.</p>

<p>So&mdash;we didn't have that to fret about. Natalie's future,
considered from an economic standpoint, was safely guaranteed.
She doubted whether she could be contented to live with her uncle
and aunt, even if that were agreeable with them. She had seen
little of them in recent years and had very few friends in
Denver. She wasn't sure that Detroit was the place for her, with
its inevitable reminders of her former happiness and present
desolation. New York might provide distractions, but it sounded
pretty lonely without her father. As for going to live with
Leslie's people, that was definitely out. "I hardly know them,"
she said. "It wouldn't be fair to them&mdash;or me, either.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I have thought," she went on, "that foreign travel
might help me; new things to see; hew acquaintances who wouldn't
be talking to me about my trouble. I could take a long trip;
around the world, maybe; be gone a year."</p>

<p>I let her prattle on, without interruption, about an extended
tour. Apparently she had been thinking about it a good deal; for
she seemed well posted on the subject. Only half attentive to her
recitation of possible itineraries, I found myself reviewing some
of the cases I had known of bereaved people who had fled from
their loneliness at home to experiment with loneliness
abroad.</p>

<p>My opportunities for observations in this field have been
fairly frequent. As has often been remarked in this journal,
brain surgery is not always successful. In the past dozen or more
years I have been invited to counsel with many bewildered
persons&mdash;women, mostly&mdash;who, having lost their
husbands, wonder what to do with themselves. If they are left
with meagre resources, the problem is to find something
profitable to do. This isn't always easy, but it is easier than
to deal with the widow who has been well provided for. A typical
case finds the widow possessed of more ready cash than she has
ever seen before. Plenty of times&mdash;in cases where the death
was the result of an accident, and I see my share of
them&mdash;the life insurance carries double indemnity, which
materially increases the inheritance.</p>

<p>I know at least a score of widows who, to-day, would be much
happier and in better health&mdash;mentally and
physically&mdash;if they hadn't been left a nickel. People do not
often look for work unless they need to do so, and sometimes the
only insurance they can get that will defray the emotional
expense of a serious bereavement is to be found in some
responsible job, a job with a lot of wear and tear to it, one
that demands an alert mind and a dextrous hand.</p>

<p>When Natalie had disembarked at Singapore, or somewhere, to
give me a chance to comment, I surprised her by saying, "I wish I
could be a little more enthusiastic over this, my dear."</p>

<p>Her eyes widened inquisitively.</p>

<p>"Don't you want me to?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," I replied, slowly. "If you had been left
penniless, I know that your friends would think it a great pity.
They would say, 'Poor Natalie! As if it wasn't enough to bear a
double bereavement, she will now have to go to work!' But,
however sympathetic and kind, these friends will be missing the
point exactly. They would be thinking, 'If Natalie had not
suffered such frightful blows, it might not be so terrible for
her to have to go to work.' Such reasoning is incorrect. It is
<i>because</i> Natalie has been dealt these exceptionally hard
blows that she <i>should</i> find work to do."</p>

<p>"You mean that&mdash;seriously?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; seriously. I don't believe you are going to find
an anodyne for your sorrow aboard a ship, or in the Alps, or on
the Riviera. I don't think it is going to help you, the least
bit, to make casual acquaintances on a voyage or in foreign
hotels."</p>

<p>"But perhaps you do not care for travel?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do, and I hope the time may come, before long, when
I may be free to do it. And you, too. Some day you will travel
with enjoyment. But I think you'd better reorganize your life
first. You see"&mdash;I went on, encouraged a little by her show
of interest&mdash;"the chief ground of your distress at present
is the loss of your motive for living. You had two important
employments; loving and cherishing your husband and your father.
Of course, you are dreadfully lonely without their love and care
for you; but the most serious feature of your bereavement is not
the loss of what they were doing for you, but of what you had
been doing for them. You had a responsible job, and now you have
lost it. Do you see what I mean? If you sit down now with folded
hands, to brood upon your loss, you are ruined. And you're too
young and sweet and capable to be wasted. We couldn't afford to
lose Leslie, and we couldn't afford to lose your father; but we
can't solve these problems by losing You!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't do anything," muttered Natalie, half to herself.
"What could I do? I ride horses, but I couldn't show anyone else
how. I play the piano, but I couldn't teach it. I trained Scotty
to do some clever tricks, but I don't believe we could go on the
stage."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know," I growled. "And you bake nice angel food
cakes. You couldn't earn enough money to keep yourself in
shoelaces, doing any of these things. But&mdash;if you honestly
want a job, we'll find you one."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I certainly don't want to go through the motions
of doing something, aware that I wasn't earning my wages," said
Natalie. "It's worth thinking about. I'll be open to
suggestions."</p>

<p>Perhaps I have made too long a story to account for Natalie's
present employment in the Winslow Art Store. It was easy enough
to arrange. They were short-handed. Young Wickes, whose division
is still retained with the Army of Occupation, may not be home
for some time yet. Mr. Winslow was glad enough to avail himself
of Natalie's services. He and Randolph were long-time friends,
having so many common interests. I think he assumed that Natalie,
having grown up in an atmosphere of applied arts, might come
fairly well informed about the implements of these
professions.</p>

<p>Natalie went to work on the sixteenth. She came to see me last
Sunday. I was amazed at the change in her face and manner. She
was positively radiant. I have often marvelled at what blood
transfusions will do. That's what the new job had done for our
girl. Almost back to normal was Natalie. She bubbled with
enthusiasm over her new interests. They were paying her twenty
dollars a week and she had resolved to live on it.</p>

<p>"Just to show myself that I'm capable of paying my way," she
explained proudly. "And&mdash;anyway&mdash;it will be interesting
to find out how people manage on small incomes. Maybe I'll get
tired of it," she added, "but&mdash;so far it has been like a new
game. I've never had to study the luncheon menu before, with
economy as the main consideration."</p>

<p>I found myself deeply interested in Natalie's adventures. It
had been a long time since I had done much skimping. As she
rattled along with her droll story of the joys and excitements of
her self-imposed frugality, I vividly recalled the days when the
new suit of clothes&mdash;albeit not made of very good
stuff&mdash;brought me pride and confidence. I know I got more
profit from the book that I couldn't buy in September, and had to
wait for until another cheque came in. One's purchases, in those
days, were made with care. Natalie was valuing what she owned,
for the first time in her life, she said.</p>

<p>"It's really amazing," she went on, "what very nice things you
can get at the ten-cent stores. They have almost everything." She
fondly patted a glittering brooch at her throat. "How much do you
think I paid for that?" she asked, lowering her tone,
confidentially.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if it's real," I replied, judicially, "I should
think it must have cost about two million, five hundred thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>"A quarter!" confided Natalie.</p>

<p>She had taken a room in a private house on a once fairly
prosperous residence street, lately grown shabby and cluttered
with little one-man shops. Her neighbour on one side was a
locksmith. Natalie had already got acquainted with him, through
the Horner family with whom she lived.</p>

<p>"Jim makes keys while you wait," she remarked, in passing.</p>

<p>"Do you call him Jim?" I couldn't help asking.</p>

<p>"Why not? That's his name."</p>

<p>There was no Mr. Horner. We hadn't learned what had become of
him, but we guessed he wasn't dead or Mrs. Horner would have said
so. There was a son, about twenty-two, who worked in a factory.
His name was Ethan but everybody called him Jack.</p>

<p>"I can see how they might," I said.</p>

<p>"But he doesn't sit in a corner," observed Natalie. "Soon as
evening dinner&mdash;or supper, rather&mdash;is over, Jack
hurries down to a bowling alley. I'm afraid he doesn't contribute
much to the family's upkeep. But his mother idolizes him and is
always quoting the funny things he used to say when he was
little. I think he outgrew that." Natalie was stripping her
gloves onto her fingers.</p>

<p>"No, no, no," I protested, "not yet. Tell me some more about
the Horners. By the way&mdash;is your room comfortable?"</p>

<p>"It isn't what the movies show you when they do an impressive
boudoir scene," admitted Natalie, "but it is warm and the bed can
be slept in if you're pretty tired. People who work all day don't
require expensive mattresses. Same thing goes for food. Pot roast
is quite tasty if you have worked hard enough to be hungry. The
rest of the Horners? Well&mdash;Winnie is seventeen and in high
school. She has a beau who doesn't look any too good to me; and
I'm afraid the affair is rather serious, for he helps Winnie with
the dishes almost every evening."</p>

<p>"Sounds to me," I put in, "as if this boy's heart is in the
right place."</p>

<p>"It isn't his heart," explained Natalie. "His heart's all
right."</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;I persisted&mdash;"any young fellow who will wash
the dishes for his gal must have something to him."</p>

<p>"No, sir!" declared Natalie stubbornly. "He is going to be
doing that for Winnie, all their lives. He'll wash the dishes,
and Winnie will have to go out and earn the living."</p>

<p>I was amazed at the versatility of her new interests. I don't
suppose Natalie knows a nickel's worth about domestic-relations
problems as comprehended by the group-lingo of Social Science
experts. But she has her eyes open, and it is going to be of
great value to her to have discovered a few facts about the way
people live who are not of her social rating. It's a new life for
her. It has taken her mind off her trouble.</p>

<p>"Any more besides Winnie?" I wondered.</p>

<p>"I have been saving Sammie for the last," said Natalie.
"Sammie is ten. He belongs to me. Very lovable little
fellow."</p>

<p>"Sickly?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;he isn't very strong. How did you know?"</p>

<p>"You said he was lovable&mdash;and ten years old."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose he wants to be?" asked Natalie,
mysteriously.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't know. Fireman, maybe?"</p>

<p>"Doctor!"</p>

<p>My thoughts were busy for a moment with several reels of
reminiscences.</p>

<p>"We will always need doctors," I said.</p>

<p>"You know&mdash;" murmured Natalie, dreamily. "Now that
Leslie's gone&mdash;and so early in his life&mdash;"</p>

<p>I tapped my lips significantly with my finger-tips, and shook
my head.</p>

<p>Natalie's eyes were thoughtful and her lips presently parted
in a slow smile. She nodded her head, understandingly. I wonder
how much Randolph may have talked to her about such things. It is
evident that she knows the principles. She gave me her hand, at
parting, and said softly, "Funny. That's what Father would have
done&mdash;if I had started to tell him what I had been
thinking." Then&mdash;after a pause&mdash;she had slipped her arm
through mine, affectionately&mdash;"You and Father had a lot of
secrets; didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," I replied, "but we never shared them."</p>

<p>"I often wondered," she said, just above a whisper. "I knew
how devoted you were to each other. I knew Father had secrets.
His life was full of little mysteries. I always thought you had
some, too." She looked up into my face and shook her head
inquiringly, as she went on, "But you never told each
other&mdash;about your secrets?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Did any of your secrets leak out&mdash;just a
little&mdash;around the edges?"</p>

<p>"Just a little, I'm afraid. But we always pretended we hadn't
noticed."</p>

<p>"The way one does, before Christmas, when one stumbles upon a
parcel&mdash;in a closet&mdash;on a high shelf?"</p>

<p>I thought it was time we terminated this conversation, and
accomplished it by remarking that one rarely stumbled over things
on high shelves.</p>

<p>I think Natalie is in a fair way to make her life mean
something very important. How glad Randolph must be&mdash;if he
knows!</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">It had been my intention to write something
here, to-night, about the gratifying change in Joyce's
disposition and behaviour&mdash;all of which is to be accounted
for by the quiet influence of Helen Brent. I had thought also of
recording a few of my impressions of this charming girl who has
so singularly stirred my heart. I am too tired to do this
adequately. Indeed I am reluctant to do it at all. I have
discovered that if you want to remember something, there's no
better way than to write it down. Perhaps I should not write
anything about this girl. It may be much better sense if I try to
forget her. Did you ever try to forget anything? A tricky job,
that. [1]</p>

<p class="footnote">[1} Yes, sir! (R. M.)</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>January twenty-ninth, 1919, 9 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">WE have been <i>en route</i> to National
Prohibition for some time and now we have got it. Enough states
have ratified the Constitutional Amendment to make it effective,
and the Secretary of State announces to-day that it is so
ordered.</p>

<p>The Drys are ecstatic, as they have every right to be, seeing
how long and zealously they have battled for this, and are in a
mood to chant, "Rest, soldier, rest, thy warfare o'er."</p>

<p>I have seen this prohibition movement in all its phases:
township option, county option, state option. When the township
was the unit, the enforcement was nearly perfect. It was
everybody's business, and the officials had no alternative but to
be lily white. When the county attended to the enforcement, it
was still pretty well done, though infractions of the law were
more frequent than when the township carried the responsibility.
When whole states went dry, it didn't work quite so well. Many of
the close observers thought the county had done a better job.</p>

<p>Now the whole country is dry, and Washington is going to see
to it that the law is enforced. I surmise that there is trouble
ahead, but I wouldn't risk saying so where anyone could hear me;
for I might be considered a Wet. I am not a Wet... I have had
plenty of opportunities to know what strong liquor has done to a
great many people. It has been responsible for much poverty,
illness, violence, and humiliation.</p>

<p>Being a surgeon, I have had no choice whether or not to drink.
For many years there has not been one moment when, waking or
sleeping, I might not be summoned immediately to perform some
delicate, life-or-death operation requiring the utmost precision
of eye and hand. So, I couldn't drink if I wanted to, and am
therefore disqualified to regard my own abstinence as a
virtue.</p>

<p>For this reason I have tried to avoid seeming self-righteous
on the subject. And I shouldn't presume to regulate another man's
habits.</p>

<p>Of course, in my professional capacity I frequently warn
gluttonous patients against digging their graves with their
teeth, and I advise the hard drinker that the human liver&mdash;
however sturdy and obliging&mdash;is not rigged to deal happily
with copper and fusel-oil. But never, as a citizen at the polls,
have I had the impudence to vote that my neighbours shall not
have a gin-fizz or a third helping of pickled tripe and fried
onions.</p>

<p>Privately I wish that strong liquors could be abolished by
common consent. So very many people drink who do not know how,
and what a pestiferous nuisance they are when they have overdone
it. Too many youngsters have had easy access to it at a period of
their immaturity when surely they are lightheaded enough without
seeking any artificial devices to numb their wits. Not many
adolescent brains are important enough to be preserved in
alcohol. I fear that my Joyce has a tendency to experiment with
it. I hope she has not inherited her eminent grandfather's
proclivities in this direction.</p>

<p>Now that enforcement is in the hands of the Federal
Government, I suspect that it will be handled clumsily, with a
minimum of effectiveness and a maximum of expense. The issue will
probably be regarded as another political football. If I were a
captain in the Dry Army, I wouldn't unlace my boots yet.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">As I was writing here, last night, I briefly
alluded to the satisfaction I had in Joyce's visit home, during
the holiday vacation. I had not supposed it possible for so great
a change of attitude and disposition in the course of a few
weeks.</p>

<p>To be sure, Joyce is getting to be a young lady now and she is
aware that a little more dignity of decorum is expected of her.
But one would think she might have been somewhat impressed by
that fact a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>No; there is only one way to account for the new Joyce. She
has been completely carried away by the charm of her student
counsellor, whom she worships with full devotion.</p>

<p>And this I can readily understand; for Helen Brent is indeed
an adorable creature. From the first moment, I felt that she
belonged to us. Not to me; to us.</p>

<p>My sober judgment warns me against dwelling too much on my
impressions of this endearing person, but I shall indulge myself,
for a moment, and then avoid any further reference to my own
feelings toward her.</p>

<p>I met them at the train. It was a bright, crisp morning. The
station was crowded, because holidays were at hand and everybody
was going somewhere or meeting friends. The gate-man reluctantly
let me go through. I did not know what car my people would be in.
By the time I arrived on the platform, there was much confusion.
I tramped hurriedly back and forth, trying to watch several
vestibule-exits where emerging passengers were gathering about
their baggage.</p>

<p>Presently I identified Joyce's corn-yellow head. She was
pointing out their tackle to a red-cap. I began threading my way
through the crowd when this lovely girl gave me both hands and a
comradely smile. I have never seen such vivid contrasts of
colour; hair so black it was blue, with an even fringe framing a
close-fitted toque on an extraordinarily white forehead; dark,
long-lashed eyes, set wide apart; expressive lips&mdash;and
dimples. When she spoke, her voice was of a deep contralto
quality; a very unusual timbre; it makes everything she says
sound like a confidence. Perhaps that helped to create the
illusion that we were old friends.</p>

<p>"You're Helen," I said, a bit rattled. "So glad you've
come."</p>

<p>She tucked a hand under my elbow and we moved on to join
Joyce.</p>

<p>"I knew you by your picture," she said.</p>

<p>Joyce was all over me for a moment, and we three started down
the platform, arm in arm. I was immensely proud of them. I
couldn't help being amused by the almost startling difference
between them; Joyce such a striking blonde, Helen as brunette as
something Latin. I don't think they will ever be mistaken for
sisters.</p>

<p>There was a wave of almost poignant tenderness swept through
me, as we marched along; not only toward my own dear girl, who
was clinging tightly to me, but toward the new one too, hugging
my arm as if she belonged to me. It was quite exhilarating.</p>

<p>After we had gone a little way and were about to descend the
steps, Helen, wanting to make sure the boy with the bags was in
tow, slowed our gait and turned halfway round to look back, but
she did not relax her tight hold on me. She was so close that
when she turned, her face brushed my sleeve. It was almost a
caress, and it warmed my heart. I hope I am not making myself
ridiculous in your sight. It stirs me deeply to recover that
enchanted moment.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Many persons are distrustful of themselves when
standing on the edge of high precipices. The possibilities of the
situation seem to exercise a sort of hypnotic urge. It isn't that
they have a temptation to destroy themselves; but there is a
strange infatuation here that startles persons who become
suddenly aware of their unsuspected phobia.</p>

<p>I found myself a little bit unsure of myself in the close
presence of Helen Brent. I believe and hope that she did not
realize the effect she had on me. I know she did not, or she
would have gone to more pains in avoiding chance contacts
offering opportunities for a caressing touch.</p>

<p>Joyce is lazy and took advantage of her liberty to breakfast
in bed. Helen had hers with me. It is my habit to glance over the
telegraph news in <i>The Free Press</i>, in my library, before
breakfast. On the next morning after the girls arrived, Helen
sauntered into the library, came to my chair, took my hand, and
said, "Breakfast. I'm hungry. Take me to it, please." She had on
some sort of lounge costume; black velvet skirt and a
high-buttoned chartreuse smock belted with a heavy cord and
tassels. It was such an exquisite outfit, and so uncommonly
becoming, that I told her she shouldn't ever wear anything
else.</p>

<p>"If you feel that way about it," she replied, in that husky
voice of hers that will be always getting her into trouble, I
fear, "I'll never wear anything else. But"&mdash;she
added&mdash;"it will look funny sometimes&mdash;at the theatre,
and ball games."</p>

<p>I liked the way she made friends with Natalie, who&mdash;to my
surprise&mdash;wanted to talk with her about Leslie; his good
humour, his kindness, his diligence as a doctor. I hadn't thought
Natalie would open up that way to a stranger. But Helen isn't a
stranger. She has some peculiar faculty of&mdash;belonging to
you. I'm afraid I can't do any better than that. I know this will
sound silly unless it should happen that you meet this woman,
some time. Then you will know what I mean. [1]</p>

<p class="footnote">[1] I know what you mean. (R.M.)</p>

<p>We three made the most of the holidays; went to see
<i>Aida</i> and <i>Pirates of Penzance</i>, put on by the Chicago
Grand Opera Company, had dinner downtown at The Pontchartrain and
the Statler and the Cadillac; saw Charlie Chaplin in a rollicking
farce in which&mdash;attending a show&mdash;he climbs back and
forth over outraged people seated in the same row and gets
embroiled with the orchestra; one of the silliest, one of the
most devastatingly ridiculous things I ever saw. In one of the
more riotous moments, when we had all laughed until we were half
hysterical, Helen pushed her forehead hard against my arm and
said, "I'm not going to look, any more. I've got a pain in my
side." I took her hand, and she held it tight, like a little
child.</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME &mdash;<br> <i>February twenty-fourth, 1919, 10
P.M.</i></h2>

<p class="first">YESTERDAY noon Nick Merrick called up to inquire
whether I could conveniently dine and spend the evening with him
at his country place on Lake Saginack.</p>

<p>It was an unusual request. I had never been invited there
except on a couple of occasions when Nick was having a large
dinner party. When he wants to talk to me about anything, he
suggests luncheon at one of the down-town clubs. It wasn't like
him to invite me out to his home on such short notice, and when
he added, "There will be no one else," I concluded that he wished
to consult me about something of importance.</p>

<p>I had made other plans for the evening, but felt that I owed
it to Nick to comply with his request, so I promised to go. About
three he called up again to suggest that I plan to stay the night
and avoid a late drive back to town. I felt sure then that Nick's
confidences promised to be somewhat extensive.</p>

<p>I had often wondered why he wanted to build that palatial
twenty-room mansion away out there in the country. Mrs. Merrick
was long since dead, and Cliff, too. Maxine was an inveterate
traveller, and when in the States she lived mostly in hotels and
sanatoria. Nick is essentially a city man. His whole life has
been spent in the clatter of big factories and the amiable buzz
of the Columbia Club.</p>

<p>Once I tried to sound him out a little on his pastoral
interests, and discovered&mdash;what I had already
suspected&mdash;that he didn't know a dahlia from an aster or an
azalea from an hydrangea or a hawthorn from a flowering crab.</p>

<p>He maintains a herd of pedigreed Guernseys and a staff of
trained dairymen to look after them, but I doubt whether there is
anything in this project that amuses Nick beyond the fact that
his milk costs about five dollars a quart. It is good milk.</p>

<p>Nick also raises fancy Berkshires. One day he told me some of
the distinguishing marks of a Berkshire. The undercarriage of the
hog's head should be shaped like a rocker. This tilts up the
snout. The forehead should overhang, leaving almost no face, at
all. A really damn good Berkshire hog, said Nick, should be
barely able to see out between his eyebrows and his nose. The
legs should be short and slim. There had been a movement to breed
for slimmer legs, Nick explained, but the thing had gone too far.
The improved legs weren't strong enough to carry the hog, so they
had been obliged to breed the sturdier legs back on again.</p>

<p>These genetic phenomena amuse Nick, but I can't believe that
he gets very much entertainment out of it; for he has nothing to
do with it aside from looking at his expensive pigs,
occasionally, when someone visits him. I saw them, one afternoon,
couple of years ago. They are clean as cats. At precise
intervals, in their recreation yard, lathe-turned and
rope-wrapped posts are planted for the accommodation of the hogs
when they want to scratch.</p>

<p>There are also pens of highly bred poultry, cages of
pheasants, and a green-tiled duck-pond with a little fountain in
the middle.</p>

<p>Every morning, weather permitting, Nick takes a stroll,
inspecting his livestock. Then, if the day is bright, his
poker-faced Powell drives him into town where he has an office on
the top floor of one of the new skyscrapers and an ancient
secretary who shares alone with God the knowledge of Nick's
reasons for coming in; for he is done with business and makes no
pretence of keeping himself informed about the dizzying progress
of the industry which he helped to inaugurate. I understand that
the stock market reports, and a succinct summary of the previous
day's business in the Axion Motor Company are always laid on his
desk, and the inkwell is kept filled.</p>

<p>Last night I found out why Nick built the big house he calls
Windymere. It is intended for Bobby. Bobby is unlikely ever to do
anything but play, and this will be just the place for him. He
will undoubtedly do a great deal of travelling about. His
appetite for going places was acquired early. He had made seven
round-trips to Europe before he was eighteen. But Windymere is to
be his permanent address, and he will be here at least every four
years to vote the Republican ticket. It takes six men to keep the
lawn in order that slopes a quarter-mile to the lake shore where
there is a commodious boat-house containing a high-powered
speed-boat, a cabin cruiser with a capacity of ten passengers,
and a couple of sail-boats. It was to talk with me about Bobby
that Nick invited me out. I was so sorry for the old man I could
have cried.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">I arrived about half-past six. The day had been
quite spring-like, but after sundown it was snappy. Nick had a
comforting fire in his big library and the welcome he gave me was
as warm. He had been reading a new detective story, and queried
me about my taste in such fiction. When I confessed that I wasn't
up on the subject, he informed me&mdash;and quite soberly,
too&mdash;that if a man really needed a time-killer, there was
nothing equal to it. His library shelves are loaded, almost floor
to ceiling, with crime and mystery tales. I daresay these
shockers are diverting, but it seems a pity that Nick's range of
reading is so restricted. There are so many other things in
which, one would think, he might find enjoyment.</p>

<p>After dinner&mdash;a man's dinner, oxtail soup, superb steak,
baked potato, head lettuce salad, cheese, and coffee&mdash;we
returned to the crime-and-mystery museum. Our table talk had
dealt mostly with the peace, which Nick thinks is impracticable,
and with prohibition, in which he has even less confidence. He
gets it from his men on the farm that liquor in plenty is coming
across the Canadian border, and believes it will not be long
until a systematic evasion of the law will develop a new
industry; says we will have a bootlegging profession, same as we
have wholesale fish dealers.</p>

<p>In the library we settled into luxurious leather chairs,
before the grate, and lighted our cigars. They were good cigars;
much too good for me, because I do not often set fire to anything
that costs a dollar.</p>

<p>"I had a rather distressing letter, this morning," began Nick,
puffing industriously. "Thought I'd like to talk to you about
it."</p>

<p>But first, he announced, he would have to tell me something of
the circumstances which had produced it.</p>

<p>"My grandson, after several years of getting kicked out of one
prep school into another, finally struck his stride at the
University. He is a junior now. I haven't had any complaints
about his conduct over there. Of course, boys will be boys, and
you can't hold too tight a rein. Bobby spends a good many of his
week-ends over here, always brings three, four, half a dozen of
his fraternity chaps along. Naturally, they are a bit noisy. They
take over the house and raise hell with it. They drink and play
poker and sleep late in the morning and upset the servants. But I
suppose they're not any worse than other high-spirited young
fellows, enjoying a couple of days away from the grind of college
work."</p>

<p>I nodded, comprehendingly, and remarked that such festival
occasions must bore him.</p>

<p>"Not any more," explained Nick. "This is the third year of it.
I used to try to play host, but I gave that up. When the racket
begins, on Friday night, I pack a bag and go into town." He
paused, for a moment, and added, "Maybe that wasn't the thing to
do. They might have behaved a little better if I had been on the
premises."</p>

<p>"Anything special happened?" I wondered. Nick reached into his
breast pocket and produced the letter. He did not open it at
once; just sat there slowly tapping his thumb with it.</p>

<p>"I had this by special delivery early to-day. It is from an
old friend of mine in Grand Rapids, Knute Larson. Knute was with
me in the Axion Company for many years; retired now. His family
is pretty much scattered. Only one left in whom he has any
particular interest: his grandnephew. This boy is one of my
Bobby's closest friends. He has been over here so often that we
feel quite well acquainted with him. Several times Knute has
dropped me a line or two, thanking me for hospitality to his
youngster. I had gathered that Knute liked to have the boy visit
us." Nick drew the letter from the envelope and adjusted his
nose-glasses.</p>

<p>The contents of the Larson communication did not surprise me
very much, after the introduction Nick had given it. Mr. Larson
was more than grateful for the many kindnesses shown to young
Knute at Windymere, but it was becoming more and more evident
that the boy would be much better served if he could be induced
to pay serious attention to his university work.</p>

<p>" 'I have heard from the dean,' " read Nick. " 'He happens to
be an alumnus of the same fraternity to which our boys belong. I
hope this is not going to worry you, but the dean says your Bobby
is not good for young Knute.' "</p>

<p>"I should have thought," I put in, "that if the dean felt this
way about Bobby, he might have hinted as much to you, and given
you a chance to counsel with Bobby about it."</p>

<p>Nick puffed vigorously, for a while, before replying.</p>

<p>"I was afraid you'd ask me that. Doc," he growled. "Fact is;
the dean has spoken to me about it, a couple of times."</p>

<p>"And how did Bobby feel about it when you talked to him?"</p>

<p>Nick shook his heavy mop of white hair, and made a jabbing
little gesture of futility.</p>

<p>"Oh, he just screwed up his face, the way he has always done,
ever since he was a baby, when someone tries to correct
him&mdash;and said the dean was a prissy old sissy. 'His trouble
is,' Bobby said, 'that he has to live on college wages&mdash;and
he's jealous. Always dragging me in to pan me for showing the
other fellows a good time.' "</p>

<p>"Maybe the dean has a case, Nick," I suggested. "Perhaps you
might solve your problem if you reduced Bobby's allowance."</p>

<p>"I would," agreed Nick, promptly; "I have! But this damn-fool
mother of his makes it up to him. I can't forbid him the house!
And I can't stand here and play policeman every week-end!"</p>

<p>We were both silent for some moments, and then I inquired
again whether anything in particular had happened to provoke the
Larson letter. Nick scowled and nodded.</p>

<p>"They celebrated Washington's birthday over here," he said
glumly, "and drove back to Ann Arbor late in the night. Seems
they got into a little accident on the road; hit a farmer's
market-cart."</p>

<p>"Sounds as if it might have been early, rather than late," I
remarked, grinning a little.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I guess so," grumbled Nick. "They were all asleep
but this young Knute. He was driving. They tried to settle with
the old man, but he had them arrested. Knute spent the forenoon
in the calaboose."</p>

<p>"And your friend Larson thinks it's time to change the program
a little."</p>

<p>"Exactly&mdash;and so do I. But I don't know where to begin,"
admitted Nick, helplessly. "Can't take him out of school. No use
sending him somewhere else. He probably wouldn't go, anyhow. He's
not dependent on me. Has plenty of money of his own."</p>

<p>"Bobby has never struck me as the sort that would stand up and
defy you," I said.</p>

<p>Nick promptly rushed to his grandson's defence.</p>

<p>"No, no," he exclaimed. "He wouldn't be mean about it. Bobby's
polite enough. Picked that up in France. He would just grin and
pat me on the back&mdash;and do as he pleased."</p>

<p>It occurred to me that if Bobby had had a little less money
and a few more spankings his prospects would be brighter. Without
taking second thought, I said that aloud. Nick shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Bobby is a fine boy," he said, half to himself. "It isn't his
fault that he hasn't been brought up like other boys. His father
died when he was a mere child; and you know how unstable his
mother is. And I never felt it was my job to be his nurse."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" I said, "something will have to be done." I was
glad Nick didn't take my comment for more than it was worth, and
ask me what I had in mind. "Does he ever talk as if he wanted to
do anything&mdash;in particular?" I asked, to chink the long
pause.</p>

<p>It was at this point that I could have wept for good old
Nicholas Merrick. He leaned forward&mdash;sagged forward&mdash;in
his chair, with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his
mottled hands, silently shaking his head.[1]</p>

<p class="footnote">[1] This thing has nearly broken my heart. I
wish I had known how deeply Grandpre had grieved about me. I am
glad he has lived to see a little brighter prospect for me. (R.
M.)</p>

<p>After a long, agonizing minute, he straightened up slowly and
said, "Doc, my boy Cliff disappointed me, poor chap. I was too
busy, when he was young, to give him proper direction. I have
hoped that Bobby might find himself and amount to something. He
has some very good traits, a fine mind, a nice disposition.
Everybody likes him. He makes friends easily. Why, sometimes,
when he is here alone with me, he goes to the piano and plays for
me by the hour; things he knows I like.
But&mdash;mostly&mdash;he's whooping it up with his rake-hell
friends. What would you do&mdash;if you were in my place?"</p>

<p>I have never been at such a complete loss for adequate words.
I tried to console Nick with the empty surmise that Bobby might
come to his senses; mumbled something about his being young yet;
that he might tire of loafing and carousing, and give himself to
a worth-while job. But, all the time, I felt that Nick was
assaying my hollow phrases at their exact value.</p>

<p>"If we could get him into a little different atmosphere" mused
Nick.</p>

<p>"Yes," I agreed, woodenly, "different atmosphere. That's
right. That might do it." A very silly rejoinder. Bobby carries
his own atmosphere along with him. "What he needs," I went on,
"is the influence of some sound young friend who isn't a mere
playboy."</p>

<p>Then it occurred to me that I might as well give Nick a
glimpse of my own problem, and its happy solution, so I told him
about Joyce. And the amazing change that had come over her
through her devotion to Helen. Nick was very attentive. His
deep-lined face brightened.</p>

<p>"Now that is fine!" he said, momentarily dismissing his own
perplexity to rejoice with me. "All the girl wanted was proper
direction. And there weren't any rules or regulations that would
keep her in line. What she had to have was the inspiration of
somebody she liked. Think it will last&mdash;when she gets out of
school, and away from this other young woman?"</p>

<p>I could only tell him that I hoped so. Our conversation lagged
a little. Perhaps that was my fault. Nick's comment about the
time to come, after Joyce's school days are over, when she may be
seeing little or nothing of Helen, depressed me.</p>

<p>For I have responded, as gratefully as Joyce, to the
tenderness and radiance of this exquisite girl. She is much in my
thoughts; much too much.</p>

<p>Nick and I played three games of Russian Bank in which I was
so decisively licked that his victories could hardly have brought
him any satisfaction. I'm afraid my mind wasn't on it. The good
old boy dragged out his watch, about ten-thirty, and
considerately observed that I had to work next day. He took me to
my room with a graciousness of hospitality that would have done
credit to a prime minister bedding down his king, patting the
pillows to make sure they were the right ones. Poor, rich, old
Nick!</p>

<p>Ever since I was a lad, I have read and heard about the
inadequacy of wealth to provide happiness. Mostly, I have let all
such platitudes in at one ear and out at the other; for these
reflections were usually offered by parsons and professors whose
knowledge of money was limited to the fact that they didn't have
any. I suppose the typical essay on "What I Would Do with a
Million" is usually written by some poor devil who hopes to sell
his piece for enough to pay an overdue gas-bill.</p>

<p>But, last night after I went to bed, it occurred to me as a
solemn and somewhat startling fact that large wealth is really
about the most feeble resource anyone can lean on who is in
search of happiness.</p>

<p>Take Nick's wealth, for example. It made a rotter of his only
son. It induced Nick into an early retirement that has made him
utterly wretched. It is going to ruin his grandson.</p>

<p>Bobby is Nick's last stand. Everything else has palled on him.
Nothing left but Bobby.</p>

<p>And now Bobby is no good.</p>

<p>It is too bad.</p>

<p>I wish there was something I could do, but I'm sure I don't
know what it would be.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">This was Pyle's birthday and I invited him to
dine with me at The Pontchartrain. Tim Watson and Natalie came
in, and tarried a moment at our table. It pleased me to see them
together. I hope something may come of this, eventually. I must
try to have sense enough not to seem too much interested.</p>
<hr>

<h2>BRIGHTWOOD HOSPITAL<br> <i>June twenty-sixth, 1919, 10
p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">HELEN came home with Joyce two weeks ago,
expecting to spend at least a month with us, but upon receiving a
summoning letter yesterday from her uncle, left for Philadelphia
this morning, greatly to our disappointment.</p>

<p>I have been blue and restless all day. My saner judgment tells
me it is probably for my own good that Helen has been called
home. More and more I have been looking to this girl for my
happiness. And the fact that I find myself, to-day, distrait and
day-dreamy and indifferent to my tasks, surely should be enough
to warn me against this tug at my heart. It will not be long
until there will be no occasion for Helen's present relation to
Joyce, and then I shall have to give her up.</p>

<p>She hasn't talked very much about her home life, but one
gathers that it is pretty bleak. Doubtless that accounts for her
tender attitude toward me. Her uncle, with whom she has lived for
years, is a taciturn, frugal, small-time lawyer, whose clientele
is limited to a group of elderly people&mdash;widows and
spinsters, mostly&mdash;living on incomes derived from
conservative bonds and rentals of small business houses. Mr.
Brent paddles about, collecting rents, overseeing repairs,
ousting undesirable tenants and haggling with the others. It is
that sort of legal practice. I infer that it is not very
lucrative, and I suspect that the nature of it has made the old
man mean.</p>

<p>It seems that Helen has a little income from a trust left by
her deceased father, which accounts for her ability to go to a
fairly expensive school. I hope the uncle is dealing honestly
with her in the handling of this money. And I have no reason to
suspect that he is not, aside from my own observation that
penurious people&mdash;adept at driving hard bargains and
pinching pennies&mdash;sometimes find it difficult to release
their grip on money that rightfully belongs to others. If this
old man has worn the same derby hat for seven years, which Helen
has humorously reported in mentioning Uncle Percival's
eccentricities, I think it is not improbable that he would
consider himself morally justified in withholding from his niece
the full payment of funds to be spent on what he might consider
unnecessary fripperies.</p>

<p>It certainly is none of my business to be making these
deductions, and the very fact that I am mentally sticking my nose
into their affairs means nothing more or less than that my
personal interest in Helen has grown out of all proportion to my
slim claim on her friendship. It's not my habit to mole into
people's private lives.</p>

<p>But&mdash;though I suppose I should despise myself a little
for these petty sleuthings&mdash;I have been thinking a great
deal about Helen's probable home life, since she left here on
such short notice this morning, and I have constructed a picture
of old Percival Brent which certainly does not flatter him. Helen
says that her Uncle Percival's patron saint is Noah, his main
interest in life being preparation for a rainy day.</p>

<p>When I was a boy, in the country, there were stories about
stingy farmers whose policy it was to eat the spotty apples
first, from the barrels in the cellar. By the time some more were
needed for the table or for cooking, there would be another batch
of apples which had become defunct in the meantime. So&mdash;the
family ate half-rotten apples all winter. I think the same
psychology prevails with the inveterate rainy-day economist. It
is always a rainy day. It begins to rain on such people when they
are thirty, and the sun never shines again.</p>

<p>Not much wonder that Helen responds to a little brighter home
environment. I know that is why she snuggles close to me. I have
to repeat that to myself, over and over, to keep my head.</p>

<p>Uncle Percival's son Monty, who lives at home, is in a
brokerage house. Probably posts the board. Unlike his papa, Monty
is not fretting much about a rainy day. Helen seems very fond of
him, probably because of her concern over his improvidence rather
than in admiration of his virtues. Father and son do not have
much in common, naturally, and they can eat dinner together at
the family table without a syllable of conversation. I suspect
that when this Monty goes broke, he wangles some money out of his
cousin. When Helen refers to him, it is usually with a quick
little sigh and an anxious shake of her head. "Poor, dear Monty,"
she calls him. It wouldn't surprise me if it was some scrape of
poor, dear Monty's&mdash;may his tribe decrease&mdash;that rushed
her off to Philadelphia to-day.</p>

<p>I realize&mdash;you needn't tell me&mdash;that I have made a
dismaying self-disclosure in the things I have said here. But it
frets me to know that Helen is unhappy, and I can't help mulling
over the obvious causes of it. I think that between sour old
Percival and slick young Monty the girl's life is deucedly
unpleasant. It would be a god-send to her if she could be
emancipated from such a dreary and stultifying atmosphere.</p>

<p>Perhaps some cold-blooded psycho-analyst would suggest that my
wish to get Helen out of that glum and frustrating home is not
quite so altruistic as I have been making myself believe. He
might inquire if I wasn't more concerned about rigging some good
excuse to get her into our home. Very well, professor, I'll admit
it, if that tickles your vanity. If Helen were in straitened
circumstances I could propose that she come to us as Joyce's
companion and counsellor, when her school days are over. As
matters are, it would be an impertinence to hint at such a thing.
But I cannot think of anything else that sounds the least bit
plausible. I must put this enchanting creature out of my
thoughts.</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>June twenty-eighth, 1919, Midnight</i></h2>

<p class="first">JOYCE, lonely without Helen, went down to the
Winslow Art Store this afternoon for a glimpse of Natalie. At
dinner this evening she reported having met Harry Wickes, who has
just arrived from France. She raved about him with shrill,
boarding-school enthusiasm and accused me of having tried to
conceal him from her.</p>

<p>"You might have told me about him," she said, reproachfully.
"You must have seen a lot of him, from the way he talks about
you."</p>

<p>"Sorry," I said. "You're almost always away, you know. And
Harry has been abroad for a long time."</p>

<p>"I asked Natalie to come to dinner next Saturday evening,"
said Joyce. "And I invited Harry too. Hope you don't mind. I
think he's marvellous!"</p>

<p>I agreed that Harry is a fine fellow, and said I was glad she
was having him here, provided it would be agreeable with Natalie.
Joyce felt sure about that. How could Natalie help liking
him?</p>

<p>"Harry has an uncommonly bright and pretty sister, too," I
said. "Perhaps you might enjoy meeting her. Would you like to ask
her to come with Harry?"</p>

<p>"Next time," said Joyce. "How about asking Tim? You said he
and Natalie were friendly."</p>

<p>I grinned and Joyce made a nose at me.</p>

<p>"Of course you may ask Tim," I said. "He hasn't been here for
months. And that will leave you free to back young Mr. Wickes
into a corner and get acquainted." I had never teased Joyce about
a young man before, and apparently I hadn't done a very neat job
of it, for she scowled a little as she stabbed at her salad.</p>

<p>"I can't see why you are saying that," she protested. "I'm not
in the habit of making war on every good-looking boy I meet."</p>

<p>"It was in fun, you know."</p>

<p>She drew a conciliatory little smile and said she knew that;
then added, "But I don't like to be teased about such
things&mdash;any more than you would."</p>

<p>I glanced up to meet her eyes, and said, "I?"</p>

<p>"Sure! You would turn a cartwheel, right out through the
window, if I teased you."</p>

<p>"What about?" I asked, indiscreetly.</p>

<p>"What about!" she echoed hollowly, and then, in a tone of
elaborate irony, mumbled, "As if you didn't know."</p>

<p>I was considerably shaken by this unexpected challenge. Surely
if anybody ever made an earnest effort to sublimate his feelings,
I had been doing so. And this mere child had seen through me. I
told her I should like some more peas, and she rang the bell. My
failure to make a rejoinder didn't help my case very much.</p>

<p>"It's all right with me," said Joyce, maternally, when the
maid had retired. "I'm sure I don't care. You know how very fond
I am of her."</p>

<p>"Helen?" I asked, rather unnecessarily, perhaps.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, darling," recommended Joyce.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" I said, not quite sure that it was well, "I
certainly hope you haven't been imprudent enough to discuss with
Helen whatever ideas you may have on this subject."</p>

<p>Joyce shook her head and pursed her pretty lips.</p>

<p>"No," she said, crisply, "I haven't mentioned it. I wouldn't
need to. She can't very well help knowing. She's pretty
bright&mdash;for her age."</p>

<p>I winced a little over that last phrase. We were about through
with our dinner while this distressing conversation was going on.
I suggested that we have coffee in the library. It seemed that
complete candour was in order now. I couldn't leave this matter
dangling. It was too important.</p>

<p>Joyce drew up a low stool in front of my chair, refused the
coffee, and folded her arms across my knees.</p>

<p>"I've hurt your feelings, Daddy/' she murmured. "I was
horrid."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you weren't horrid," I said, "but&mdash;you
bewildered me a little. I've made no secret of my fondness for
Helen. She is one of the most charming girls I ever knew.
But&mdash;I haven't been romancing with her, if that's what you
mean."</p>

<p>Joyce put her face down into her folded arms and shook her
head. Then, without looking up, she mumbled, "I know you haven't,
darling; but you're in love with her." And when I did not reply
promptly, she added, "You know that."</p>

<p>"My dear," I said, "it isn't always easy to supervise your
feelings toward people. Some you dislike, for no very good
reason, and they seem to sense it&mdash;no matter how much pains
you take to conceal it. And some people you like, perhaps without
knowing exactly why, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Daddy, don't!" said Joyce, thickly. "If you aren't going to
talk honestly about it, let's drop it."</p>

<p>"Very well," I declared. "If it gives you any pleasure to put
your father on the grill, I'll admit that Helen is very dear to
me. If I were fifteen years younger&mdash;ten years
younger&mdash;I should try to win her love."</p>

<p>"Try to win her love!" repeated Joyce. "Are you blind? Or are
you trying to spoof me?"</p>

<p>"Are you attempting to make me believe," I demanded, "that you
think Helen Brent is fond of me&mdash;in that way? It couldn't
be!"</p>

<p>Joyce straightened up, clasped her slim hands around her
knees, and looked up steadily into my face.</p>

<p>"Are you being truthful. Daddy?" she asked, soberly.</p>

<p>"Never more so!" I declared, sincerely. "Helen has never given
me the slightest reason for thinking that she considers me
otherwise than as a devoted friend&mdash;old enough to be her
father. Doubtless it is because she has no father that she treats
me with such tender solicitude."</p>

<p>"She likes to be close to you," said Joyce, reminiscently.</p>

<p>"Let's analyse that," I suggested. "When she was with us, last
Christmas, and we were starting out to spend the evening, you
probably saw Helen tuck my scarf closer about my throat; but that
was the sort of attention a young person shows toward an elderly
person. In fact, it defined our relation."</p>

<p>Joyce smiled knowingly.</p>

<p>"But you are not an old man, Daddy. You swim, and golf, and
drive like the devil was after you, and go everywhere performing
tricky surgery. Helen doesn't think you need your throat bundled
up."</p>

<p>"You're on the wrong track, my lass," I said,
condescendingly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;maybe," she conceded, arching her brows. Rising,
she kissed me lightly on the forehead and sauntered toward the
door. "Have you read <i>My Antonia</i>?" she paused to inquire.
And when I said I had not, she suggested that I do so. "I am in
the middle of it now," she said. "If you'll excuse me, I'll go
back to it. You know how it is&mdash;when you're in suspense
about a story."</p>

<p>"Run along, dear," I said, cheerfully enough. "When you are
through with it, I'll read it&mdash;if you can recommend it as a
book that keeps you in suspense."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you cared much for such stories," drawled
Joyce, a bit slyly, as if she were inviting me into a commitment.
"I thought you liked stories that put you to sleep."</p>

<p>"Not always," I replied, gratified over the change of
conversation. "Suspense is good for you, sometimes; helps to keep
your blood in circulation. I don't object to a story that keeps
me awake."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I'll tell you one then," said Joyce, slowly
sidling through the doorway. "Helen carries your picture in her
card-case."</p>

<p>I'm afraid my heart gave a strange little bump that wasn't the
fault of my aneurism; but I decided not to be left sitting with
Joyce's half-malicious valedictory.</p>

<p>"And what if she does?" I retorted. "That doesn't mean a
thing! If she carries my picture&mdash;and it's mighty sweet of
her&mdash;she has about the same reason she would have for
carrying the picture of her philosophy professor&mdash;or Uncle
Percival, if he wasn't such a grim old icicle. For the present,
Helen considers me as an anchor. She wants something substantial
to lean on." I realized, too late, that this final remark had not
been happily selected.</p>

<p>Joyce, framed in the doorway, slowly nodded her head several
times, in mock acceptance of my speech.</p>

<p>"Something to lean on," she repeated. "I've seen her do
it."</p>

<p>"Jealous?" I asked.</p>

<p>Joyce ambled toward me, her lips twisted into a pout.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I'm not jealous," she said, defensively. "I think
I'm rather glad. You've been lonesome&mdash;for years and years.
I'm crazy about Helen. It would be gorgeous to have her
here&mdash; always! Only&mdash;what peeved me was your taking
this hoity-toity attitude, as if you were Moses&mdash;and I was
nothing but&mdash; but&mdash; "</p>

<p>"The Ten Commandments," I suggested, when she failed to
complete the pass. "Come here." I wiggled a finger. She sat on my
lap, and dabbed at her eyes. I pulled her down into my arms.</p>

<p>"I ought to be slapped," she muttered, huskily.</p>

<p>"Me, too," I admitted. "I should have been more generous with
my answers to your questions. But, darling, I really don't know
the right answers. All that I can tell you is this: I do love
Helen, and&mdash;that's the end of it. I'm never going to tell
her, and I sincerely hope you won't. Because, if you do, we can
never have her here again. Promise?"</p>

<p>Joyce raised up to look me squarely in the eyes.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;you don't intend to ask her to marry you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not!"</p>

<p>"But you two would be enormously happy!"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't work," I said.</p>

<p>"Poor Daddy!" Joyce patted my cheek.</p>

<p>Her tender words and the caress added several more years.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">I deeply regret that this conversation occurred.
It is very doubtful if Helen and I can retain the sweet
relationship we have had. I should like to believe that Joyce
will have sense enough to keep my secret, but I wouldn't bet much
on it; and I shall not know&mdash;certainly&mdash;that she hasn't
confided it. This doubt will make me self-conscious. Helen will
sense it, and wonder why. Even if Joyce doesn't tell, Helen will
feel this constraint. The situation troubles me.</p>

<p>I hope I'm not indulging in self-pity. But this precious woman
has been good for me. It has restored my youth to have her close
to me and be aware of her dear companionship. Aside from my work,
my life&mdash;for many years&mdash;has been lonely. Surely no one
would have begrudged me this beautiful friendship.</p>

<p>And now my child has unwittingly ruined it. If Helen comes
here again, she will find me remote, austere, casual. I won't be
able to resume our friendship freely.</p>

<p>When the tact was passed around, my daughter must have
contented herself with a very modest serving.</p>

<p>Here goes for another sleepless night.</p>

<p>Joyce knew a story that would keep me awake.</p> <hr>

<h2>BRIGHTWOOD HOSPITAL<br> <i>July fifth, 1919, 9.30
p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">LATE this afternoon McDermott and I were
together in an operation. It turned out to be a fairly simple
mastoid, and I did little but look on. Mac had thought he might
run into something deeper. We were both glad his suspicions were
groundless, and so was the patient who seemed almost as much
interested in the case as we were.</p>

<p>It was a tedious affair and by the time we were into our
street clothes it was six-thirty. Mac suggested that we have
dinner here. It has been a long time since I have done that. We
met Tim Watson, on our way down, and invited him to join us. Our
table conversation was of considerable interest to me, and I am
going to recapitulate it briefly. We were discussing the
increasing disregard for law and order, and the probable outcome
if this tendency is permitted to go on unchecked.</p>

<p>The subject arose as a corollary to our unanimous indignation
over yesterday's inexcusable racket. There is a city ordinance
prohibiting the sale or shooting of firecrackers, but for the
past week all sorts of noisy and dangerous fireworks were to be
had almost any place in town. The patients at
Brightwood&mdash;and we are far out in a residential zone where
you would think we should be protected&mdash;were kept awake and
on edge all night of the third and all day and all night of the
fourth.</p>

<p>At the four corners of our grounds, which occupy the entire
block, there are conspicuous signs reading
"Quiet&mdash;Please&mdash;Hospital." It was generally agreed that
there was more shooting in our block than anywhere else we had
been, during this period.</p>

<p>McDermott insisted it was the signs, requesting quiet, that
accounted for this annoyance. Mac thinks the rowdies see the
notices and growl, "To hell with your rules!" And light a
cannon-cracker the size of a rolling-pin, and toss it into the
hospital grounds.</p>

<p>We asked one another, "Who are these people? Where do they
come from? Who breeds this stock?" These queries set us going on
our serious talk about the mounting inconsiderateness of our
time. It would seem that a certain element of our population is
utterly callous to the fundamental claims of common decency. Tim
thinks we are rapidly becoming a nation of boobs.</p>

<p>I do not think that I am personally acquainted with a man or
boy who would deliberately throw a nerve-splintering explosive
onto the lawn of a hospital. But there are such people. Who are
they? How did they get that way? Do they derive from any
particular species? Or are they just unclassified halfwits and
hoodlums?</p>

<p>McDermott, who is I fear slightly prejudiced in favour of
persons speaking something that resembles the English language,
thinks we have been far too lax with our immigration
restrictions; says the public's bad manners have been imported.
While I do not share his certainty that this fully explains the
growing impoliteness and disregard of the ordinary amenities, I
do believe that the country is too heavily stocked with aliens
who have no interest in the American way of living.</p>

<p>Now that bootlegging is rampant&mdash;as might have been
expected, with the Federal Government in charge of prohibition
enforcement&mdash;it is significant that the very large majority
of the men arrested every day for liquor-smuggling and
liquor-peddling are foreigners bearing other than English
names.</p>

<p>Mac had an evening paper along with him, which he proceeded to
spread out over the table and into the hollandaise sauce, and
began drawing little circles around the names of persons figuring
in to-day's crime news. "Look!" he said, "See what I mean?"</p>

<p>It really was amazing! It appears that we are supporting an
imported underworld composed of people who arrogantly defy our
laws. In what other nation, inquires McDermott, would such a
thing be permitted?</p>

<p>Tim thinks the war had a lot to do with the prevailing
rudeness; says the demobilized soldiers, released from rigid
restraints, are eager to exercise their liberty; thinks they
enjoy the distinction of being "tough guys."</p>

<p>I ventured the opinion that the automobile has had much to do
with making people inconsiderate. A naturally rude fellow will
impose on other people, when he is behind the steering wheel of a
car where they can't get at him. The bigger coward he is, on
foot, the more bravely impudent he is, on wheels.</p>

<p>We still don't know what sort of people touched off the
firecrackers around the hospital. But we do know that there is
being developed, in this country, a contempt for law and the
elementary civilities. I wonder if the big factories haven't
something to do with it. Until the recent techniques of mass
production came in, men in industry found joy in their work. The
cabinet-maker produced a bureau; all of it. He designed it,
fitted it together with skill, applied its hardware, varnished
it, fetched it to market. Now, his son's contribution to the five
thousand identical bureaus that the big furniture factory has
contracted for, is limited to the job of feeding an automatic
machine that dowels the boards with a punch&mdash;and a whack.
You can't expect this young fellow to find any joy in that sort
of occupation. He has to find his pleasure apart from his work.
And he doesn't know how. He goes out looking for excitement.
Firecrackers, perhaps.</p>

<p>I have made some notes on our conversation, to-night, because
the problem we discussed is likely to grow more and more serious.
Unless this increasing contempt for authority and indifference to
the public welfare is effectively dealt with, the tendency may
become a grave menace to the very life of this nation.</p>

<p>Evidently it is an easy step from impoliteness to vandalism,
and from vandalism to disregard of life and safety. If we are not
vigilant, there may come a day when life in this land will be
cheap, and property rights insecure.[1]</p>

<p>When the hoodlum class has become sufficiently important,
numerically, to be aware of its united power, it may either
decide to make war on honest and industrious citizens at the
polls, or stage a revolution.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">For the past hour I have been in my office,
talking with Nancy Ashford, who returned this evening from a two
weeks' vacation in the country near harbour Beach on Lake
Huron.</p>

<p>One of our pet nurses, Cynthia Bates, hails from that
neighbourhood and is forever extolling the peace and quiet of the
shore farms. Nancy, physically and emotionally worn by her heavy
responsibilities, thought it might be good for her to escape into
such a tranquillizing environment.</p>

<p>Her report was amusing. Nancy had the usual experience of the
city dweller who, battered by the rasp of traffic and the
suffocating contacts with the urban pack, seeks repose in the
open spaces and among persons of simple life. The first day of
this serenity is so delightfully healing to the bruised spirit
that one doubts whether one will ever be able to return to the
racket. And the first night, one sleeps like a
baby&mdash;probably because well done up from a long journey. The
next night&mdash;but I'll let Nancy describe it.</p>

<p>"The next night was mosquito night. They had a fiesta. And I
was in the front row. Martha was sorry they didn't have electric
lights&mdash;I mean the house; not the mosquitoes&mdash;and so
was I; for that meant I couldn't read in bed. There was a two
candle power kerosene lamp on the table. I couldn't see to read
by it, but it was just right for the mosquitoes to find their way
about. And&mdash;so far as the peace and quiet went&mdash;I never
heard so much noise; noises I wasn't used to. The katydids! My
word! And the frogs! And the bugs!"</p>

<p>"Bugs?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;not that kind. Martha is clean as a pin. I mean
gnats and various things that fly around and sing&mdash;and carry
hypodermic kits."</p>

<p>"How was the food?" I inquired. "You can generally get some
very nice saddle-leather, at these country places, served with
brown gravy."</p>

<p>"The food was wonderful!" replied Nancy, fervently. "Martha is
a grand cook. I wish we could induce her to come to Brightwood.
I've had about all I can take from Emmons."</p>

<p>"Drinking again?"</p>

<p>"And surly&mdash;and impudent&mdash;and untidy."</p>

<p>"Very well: get Martha."</p>

<p>"She would like to come. I talked to her about it. But she
lives with her brother. They're twins. They've never been
separated. We would have to find a job for Perry."</p>

<p>"That might not be hard," I said. "What can he do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Nancy, with a little sigh. "Perry has a
stiff knee that's gone to his head. It has made him sour as a
pickle. He might be taught to help with the furnaces and mow the
lawn and&mdash;odd jobs. He is handy with tools. Made his own
motor-boat. Took the engine out of an old flivver."</p>

<p>"Did you take a ride in it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He didn't invite me. Perry's about as companionable as
a&mdash;a porcupine. But Martha is a darling! And I can't see how
she endures that lonely life up there with nobody to talk to but
this sorehead." Then Nancy went on to eulogize Martha's wide
range of domestic accomplishments, and repeat her wish that the
frustrated woman might be given "a chance to live."</p>

<p>"All right," I agreed. "Bring her on. We can find something
for Perry. Maybe the change of scenery would be good for him
too."</p>

<p>So&mdash;we left it at that. Nancy hopes it will work out
happily; and, for her sake, I do too; though it won't bother me
very much, if it doesn't; I'm not responsible for what goes on in
the hospital kitchen. It's Nancy's job.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">I fear I have forgotten to report on the dinner
party we had, a little while ago, attended by Natalie and Tim and
Harry Wickes.</p>

<p>It was expected, at least by me, that Natalie and Tim would
consolidate and leave Harry to the mercy of Joyce. From the first
it was evident that Natalie and Harry have discovered their
mutual indispensability.</p>

<p>If Tim has been in doubt whether to pursue his interest in
Natalie, I think he may now set his mind at ease on that
subject.</p>

<p>About nine, he put in a call to Brightwood, and regretted to
learn that he had to leave us at once. I hope Tim is not going to
fret, and I don't believe he will. I should like to see him in a
home of his own. I wonder if he might like Dorothy. We must
arrange to have them over together some evening.</p>

<p>Joyce heard from Helen to-day. Uncle Percival insists on her
spending the rest of the summer at home. It's a very drab life
for her. I wish we could do something about it.</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>August twentieth, 1919, 10.30 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">ON several occasions, during the past year or
more, I have talked vaguely with my good friend, Fred Ferguson,
about a small cottage I thought of building on my few arid acres
overlooking Lake Saginack.</p>

<p>Fred has always made a little joke of it. As the best-known
architect in town, he doesn't waste his time on such
insignificant projects, and he has doubted whether I would make
much use of a house in that uninviting region.</p>

<p>Last night, we found each other at the Columbia Club, and had
dinner together. Mrs. Ferguson was out of town, and Joyce is a
guest at Windymere over the week-end where Bobby Merrick is
entertaining a dozen young friends from town. I wasn't keen on
Joyce's accepting the invitation, but I didn't care to have a row
with her.</p>

<p>Fred, as usual, wanted to know how the little house was coming
on; and when I assured him that I still had the thing seriously
in mind he said, "Why don't we drive out there to-morrow and look
the place over&mdash;and make a few pencil-sketches."</p>

<p>I picked him up this morning about ten and we arrived shortly
after one. The last two miles are off the highway on a narrow
gravelled road. I must say that the country round about is
anything but attractive; a lot of dwarfed pine and brambles. Of
course, everything is seared now with the usual midsummer
drought. I felt a bit chagrined over the general appearance of my
untamed property, as we turned into the ill-conditioned lane and
proceeded slowly toward the unfenced west boundary of the tract
which overhangs the water at an elevation of some eighty feet.
Fred was saying nothing as we got out of the car and sauntered
through the briars to the ledge. I rather expected he would
remark, presently, that the situation was bad and that I had
better not waste any money on it. He looked for a long time at
the lake and the land, and then said, "If you really want a
little hideout, Doc, where you can rusticate in peace, I think we
can build something suitable. It's a great view. And all you
need, to make a lovely setting for your house, is a good job of
landscaping, a deep well, and some competent person to keep up
the grounds."</p>

<p>We sat down on the parched grass and Fred continued thinking
aloud. I might as well make up my mind, he said, that there would
be a nice little item of expense&mdash;at the outset&mdash;for
the engineering. There should be a low stone wall fronting the
lake, and some grading and excavation necessary to make a safe
and comfortable way down to a boat-house and swimming-wharf.</p>

<p>"But it will not be of much satisfaction," he went on, "if you
think of it as a mere summer place. If you are willing to go into
this thing right, build an all-year house and put some people in
it who will take care of it and the grounds. If it isn't that
important, I shouldn't do it, at all, if I were you."</p>

<p>Then he began drawing some tentative plans for a house, part
of it to serve the caretakers; two-thirds of it for the master, a
couple of guest bedrooms, and&mdash;most important of all&mdash;a
large living-room with a grand view. As the design unfolded, my
interest increased. I need a place of this sort. I have stuck too
close to my work.</p>

<p>"If you mean business," said Fred, "you would do well to have
a good landscape man come out here and get some of your heavier
plantings started. It takes a little time to do that."</p>

<p>"I would probably not live long enough to see trees of any
size," I said.</p>

<p>"Not like the ones across the lake, certainly," agreed Fred,
pointing to the beautiful panorama on the western shore. "The
Fosters' grove of firs must be very old; big trees long before
they built their place. Nick Merrick paid a pretty penny for his
landscaping."</p>

<p>"You built that house; didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It's a great place; don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Gorgeous! But I wouldn't want it. Too big."</p>

<p>"Neither would I," agreed Fred. "I wonder if the old boy is
happy in it."</p>

<p>"Ought to be," I said. "He has everything; all the modern
conveniences; fancy livestock, flower gardens, fresh air, the
lake."</p>

<p>"I don't think Nick makes much use of the lake," drawled Fred.
"Young Bobby has a little fun, occasionally, in that big
speed-boat. Have you seen him lately?"</p>

<p>I said I hadn't. Fred grinned enigmatically.</p>

<p>"Have you?" I asked, surmising that he wanted a little
encouragement.</p>

<p>"Bobby's going to be a second edition of Cliff," muttered
Fred. "A good deal brighter than Cliff&mdash;but a waster. They
tell me he is doing a fairly good job at the University; finishes
in February. But he goes at a pretty fast clip."</p>

<p>"Does your Arthur see anything of him, over there?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>"No," snapped Fred. "I put my foot down on that. He's no fit
company for any young fellow with an ounce of ambition. Art was
considerably upset because I wouldn't let him go to Bobby's house
party that's on now at Windymere."</p>

<p>"You must have your boy under good control," I observed, "or
he would have gone, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;he knows better than to pull a trick like that on
his daddy. However&mdash;I must say for the boy that he generally
votes the right ticket. We haven't had much trouble with him.
I've explained to him that we're not well enough off to let him
grow up to be a bum. He has got his living to make. Young Merrick
will never have to work." After a little pause, he added, "I
expect that bunch, over there to-day, is plastered to the
eyebrows."</p>

<p>I made no reply for a long time; then I couldn't help saying,
"My Joyce is there."</p>

<p>"Sorry," said Fred, a bit flustered. "I guess I spoke out of
turn. However&mdash;I daresay your girl can take care of herself,
all right."</p>

<p>"I hope so," I said. "It's hard to know just what to do when
these youngsters insist on having their own way."</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;that's right, Doc," said Fred, soothingly. "Big
problem." He scrambled to his feet. "Well&mdash;shall we call it
a day&mdash;and go home?"</p>

<p>Our conversation had suddenly depressed me. We drove another
mile north on the gravelled road, at Fred's suggestion, to see
what the country looked like, further out. I hadn't been that
far, before. Half a mile from my place we found an unoccupied
house, not in bad repair, and sauntered around it, peering in
through cobwebbed windows.</p>

<p>"Somebody tried to live here," I said, "and gave it up."</p>

<p>"They probably hoped to make a living," said Fred. "Anyone who
wants a house in this neighbourhood will have to make his living
somewhere else."</p>

<p>We had some difficulty keeping our conversation alive, on the
way home. It was still a bright day, but my own sky was overcast.
I let Fred out at his house, and returned to the hospital to see
if everything was all right. Or, perhaps my car proceeded over to
Brightwood by force of habit. Or, perhaps I felt, subconsciously,
that was the one stable fact left to reassure me. In any event, I
went to the hospital, where things seemed unusually quiet. I did
not talk to anyone.</p>

<p>I had my dinner at home alone. I suppose it was a good dinner,
but I had no appetite. Afterward I began a letter to Helen, but
found I had nothing in particular to say to her that I dared to
say. So I tore it up. Then I decided to write a few pages in this
journal, but you can see that I am in no mood for that either.
Life is very flat to-night.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Nancy has succeeded in bringing Martha Ruggles
and her irascible brother to Brightwood. Martha is proving to be
the jewel that Nancy had thought her. Grim old Perry who, for all
that he is Martha's twin, appears to be about ten years her
senior, is going to be a problem. Can't work with anybody. Thinks
he is being made fun of, and I daresay he is.</p>

<p>He regards everyone with suspicion. Nancy thinks he is jealous
of Martha's responsible position and growing popularity with our
Brightwood family.</p>

<p>My heart goes out to the old codger. I think it's the stiff
knee that has made him so standoffish. If so, that means he is
uncommonly sensitive. I have a notion he would respond to a
little tactful attention.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon I waved a hand to him as he was hobbling
across the grounds behind a big lawnmower. He paused, a moment,
and regarded me with an impassive stare, but did not return my
salute. An hour later one of the orderlies met me in a corridor
and said, confidentially, "This here new feller, with the game
leg, is out in the parkin' lot, a-tinkerin' with your motor. He's
got the spark-plugs all out, a-fussin' with 'em.</p>

<p>"I know about that, Danny," I said, failing to add that I had
just now found it out. "And perhaps you'd better get back to your
own job before it outgrows you." I hate a tattler.</p>

<p>It annoyed me a little to have this report about Perry. I
would have to tell him, too, to mind his own business. When I
left the hospital, my car had more pep and snap than it had had
for many a day. Perry had cleaned and readjusted the spark-plugs;
probably had known they needed it when he heard the engine come
into the lot.</p>

<p>I couldn't help chuckling over this droll affair. Perry is
going to be worth cultivation, I think. Yesterday's episode is
funny enough to make a dog laugh, but it has its pathos, too.
Sour old Perry never gets an amiable word because he doesn't
deserve it. I wave a hand to him, and he merely scowls at me.
Then he ditches his lawnmower and goes out to do me a favour. I
must see more of Perry, but I'll have to be very careful.</p>

<p>I think he has all the natural instincts of a squirrel. He
could be trained to eat out of your hand, but it would be a
mistake to pat him on the back.</p> <hr>

<h2>BLACKSTONE HOTEL, CHICAGO<br> <i>August twenty-eighth, 1919,
8.30 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">I CAME here for a consultation with Russell. We
had it this afternoon and I am going back to Detroit to-night.
Russell really shouldn't have asked me over, for there was
nothing to be done. A sixteen-year-old boy dived into a shallow
pool. Anyone would know, from the character of the respiration,
that the blow had fractured the odontoid process. You can't do
anything about that.</p>

<p>Russell said, "I know&mdash;but the family wanted to do
everything possible." And then he added that he wanted my
confirmation of his own diagnosis. I told him I thought he could
confirm that, in about three days, with an autopsy.</p>

<p>It was a great pity. They were very fine people, and the boy
will be a sad loss to them. I can't get accustomed to these
things. After the consultation, I had an hour's talk with the
parents. They were bewildered; hungry for almost any kind of
consolation. I am not sure that I gave them anything but my time
and sympathy. I suggested that they have a talk with Dean
Harcourt, after they have laid their boy away. They know he can't
live more than a day or two. We gave them no false hopes. I do
not think it is a kindness, in such cases, to offer any
encouragement. And neither does Russell. The truth&mdash;taking
it by and large&mdash;is more satisfactory than a lie, however
kindly meant. You encourage a family to hope&mdash;when there
isn't the ghost of a chance&mdash;and they keep themselves strung
up almost to the breaking-point for a period of days; and then
they have to take the blow when their nervous equipment is
disabled.</p>

<p>I used, occasionally, to practice that sort of benign deceit,
but stopped it when I realized&mdash;with a start&mdash;that it
wasn't their own feelings I had been trying to protect so much as
mine. I had thought I was being humane when I was only being
cowardly. I didn't want to witness their grief. I wanted them to
take their hard wallop when I wasn't present to see them writhe.
You'll find, if you look into it, that your sympathies can play
some queer tricks on you. There's a lot of fraudulent consolation
offered by people who are merely trying to protect their own
emotions against a distressing scene.</p>

<p>Somebody is in an awful mess, and you say, "There, there;
don't fret. Maybe this is going to come out all right." And you
damn-well know it isn't going to come out all right. It's already
out&mdash;and it's all wrong! What you're really trying to do is
to give them a little sniff of ether until you've had time to
escape.</p>

<p>Of course, it is a mistake to argue with grief, but it's a
bigger mistake to dismiss it with "Now, now; there, there."</p>

<p>Pyle had an interesting patient at Brightwood, a few weeks
ago; a serene and friendly little woman, who had been
hospitalized for some deep surgery. Pyle asked me to call on her,
when she was convalescent. In the course of our talk, I inquired
about her family. She had lost a boy, an only child, when he was
twelve. I said, "That's too bad." She shook her head and smiled.
"No," she said, quietly, "I've never felt that way about it. It
was the great experience of my life&mdash;having him for twelve
years. I live it over and over. Those memories are very precious.
They comforted me so much when I was sick."</p>

<p>I repeated this conversation to the Brownings, this afternoon.
I told them they couldn't hope that their Lawrence would recover,
but they had a right to hope for an early arrival of the day when
their possession of him&mdash;for sixteen years&mdash;would
become an enduring blessing. Mrs. Browning murmured, "Larry has
had such a short life." I told her they might extend it by
investing something&mdash;in Larry's name. Her husband, eager to
comfort her, said they would do that; a gift to the hospital,
maybe.</p>

<p>"Or, better, an investment in a person," I suggested. "Stake
some worthy young fellow to an education that will fit him for
constructive service&mdash;and that will be Larry, carrying on;
Larry as a doctor, perhaps; Larry as a teacher; Larry as a
violinist. Find a chap that can be trained to make people well,
or informed, or happy. Then Larry will live for a long time
yet."</p>

<p>I never stepped out of a professional consultation before, to
go into a lay consultation with the family. Perhaps I might not
have done so to-day if I hadn't been out to the Cathedral this
morning. I arrived here at nine, coming early on purpose to hear
Harcourt. I have been under the spell of this, all day.</p>

<p>Harcourt is a straight and steady thinker. And everything he
says sounds as if it was coming from Somewhere Else. Of course,
the environment has a good deal to do with that. After you've
been stilled by the impressive music and the ancient ritual, you
drift into a sort of hypnosis which makes you peculiarly amenable
to Harcourt's suggestions.</p>

<p>And yet he doesn't make the slightest effort to impose on your
emotions. I can't quote the text he used. There is a Gideon Bible
here on the chiffonier, but that doesn't do me any good; for I
have forgotten where the text was: something about "The eye
cannot see, nor the ear hear, the things God hath prepared for
those who love Him; for He reveals them to us by His spirit."</p>

<p>For a little while, the Dean talked very beautifully about
one's aesthetic response to the God we find in Nature. It was a
prose poem. God in the sunrise; God in the sunset; offering two
entirely different revelations of Himself; the eastern view at
dawn inviting joy and work; the western view proposing a tranquil
thought of rest. "That is what sunsets are made for," said the
Dean, "to give you mental repose."</p>

<p>If you use your imagination a little on this, you will get the
Dean's general idea of God's appeal to the human eye; in the
silent, patient majesty of big trees; in the august austerity of
high mountains; in the confident onrush of rivers cascading
toward the sea, and never coming back until&mdash;chastened and
humbled&mdash;they return in quiet showers falling on still
pastures and in snowflakes on the hills. That sort of thing.</p>

<p>Then he talked about God's self-disclosures to the human ear;
in music, of course; and in the eternity-message of the surf; and
in the cadences of a voice beloved.</p>

<p>These were aesthetic appeals, said the Dean, and nobody was to
minify their importance. "These messages," he went on, "are in
the nature of spiritual oxygen. Without them, we cannot live as
spiritual beings." Then he talked a little about the properties
and phenomena of oxygen. We have to breathe to live, and it's the
oxygen that we're after. We can't get on without it, and we
recover it from the air by breathing. "When people become
anaemic, spiritually, it may be for lack of oxygen. Perhaps there
are no sunsets where they live. Perhaps they never see mountains
or hear a waterfall. We get our spiritual oxygen through the eye
and ear&mdash;and the other senses."</p>

<p>Then he talked about nitrogen. You can't live without it, but
you must work for it. You can't breathe it. It is not free. It is
in the soil, in the plants, in the wheat, in the meat; but not
free.</p>

<p>Spiritual nitrogen, on which the soul feeds, must be captured.
You must invest, you must be willing to wait with the patience of
a farmer, you must not quit sowing because there was a drought.
But if you strive, God will reveal to you, by His spirit, some
self-disclosures which He cannot give you in a sunset, or by
starlight, or by music. "Many people who can breathe," said the
Dean, "are hungry."</p>

<p>Then he talked about what one may do to acquire this needful
nitrogen; the investment of one's life in the upbuilding of other
people, the steady alignment of oneself with the forces that lead
up and on; costly adventures, sometimes; the more costly, the
more rewarding.</p>

<p>The sermon was in the nature of a strong stimulant. I wish I
had easier access to this man. I have not met him personally, and
I shall not seek to do so. He is&mdash;from the distance in feet
and inches that has been between him and me&mdash;the most
engaging personality I have ever seen or heard; but I shall not
risk a disillusionment by asking for an introduction to him: I do
not want him to inquire how the weather is in Detroit, or tell me
he is glad I came to his church. I don't want anything out of
Harcourt when he isn't standing in his pulpit with his black gown
on. Maybe I should find him just as helpful, in private talk; but
I am not going to venture the experiment.</p>

<p>Back in the country, when I was a youngster, they always
inquired whether the candidating preacher was a good mixer. Maybe
that was the reason the people never kept one preacher very long.
He was a mixer, and while he mixed, the people starved to death
spiritually. At least, I surmise they did; for they were always
in rows with one another, which couldn't very well have happened
if they had been spiritually alive.</p> <hr>

<h2>THE SHOREHAM, WASHINGTON<br> <i>September seventeenth, 1919,
10 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">I AM in good spirits to-night, after a month or
more of anxiety. Joyce is again in Helen's custody, and
everything is going to be all right.</p>

<p>Their school resumed work to-day. I came down with Joyce,
explaining that I had an errand in Baltimore, which is true,
though I purposely timed my appointment there to coincide with
her journey. She was candidly suspicious of my motive, and
inclined to be resentful when she learned we were travelling
together.</p>

<p>"I hope you aren't afraid I might elope with some stranger,"
she said, ineffectually trying to be jocular.</p>

<p>"Not at all," I declared, '*but I have to go down, anyway, and
I shall be very proud to be seen in your company. Of course," I
added, pensively, "if you're ashamed to have your infirm parent
along, I can go on a later train."</p>

<p>There wasn't much she could do, after that, but assure me of
her great joy, so we planned the trip; and, on the surface, it
was pleasant enough. But Joyce's surmise that, in my opinion, she
needs a bit of supervision, isn't a bad guess. In fact she knows
that I have been disturbed about her recent social activities.
She has been playing around with a pretty gay set, seeing
entirely too much of young Merrick and a chap named Masterson,
who thinks he is going to be a story-writer.</p>

<p>I made an effort to learn something about the nature of these
frequent engagements, some of which have kept her out late, but
her accounts of their various diversions have been disquietingly
sketchy, and her attitude on the subject decidedly cool. I have
been less in Joyce's confidence, during the past couple of weeks,
than ever before.</p>

<p>I think I once adverted, in this journal, to the very close
relation between one's emotional states and certain types of
heart trouble. I cannot too strongly insist that this is true. I
have discovered, in my own case, that a few days of fretting will
so intensify my heart disability that I am obliged to add that
anxiety to the other worry.</p>

<p>My aneurism has bothered me so constantly, of late, that I
decided to consult Ramsey at Johns Hopkins. I have an engagement
to see him to-morrow afternoon. But I am feeling ever so much
better, to-night; so very much better that I am half minded to
call him up and cancel the appointment.</p>

<p>I know very well the reason for my sudden improvement. My girl
is safe in Helen Brent's hands. I still have an
aneurism&mdash;and it will unquestionably get me some
day&mdash;but, to-night, I am fit as a fiddle.</p>

<p>Joyce gave herself the pleasure of teasing me, this morning,
when I said I would go out to Chevy Chase with her.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;how funny!" she shrilled. "I thought you detested
getting yourself messed up with a lot of fond mammas and old maid
professors. There must be something else out there, darling, that
you want to look at. What could it be?"</p>

<p>I think she had repented a little, by the time we arrived; for
she was prompt to find Helen, and when we met, her attitude was
intended to put us at ease. I feel assured, now, that
Joyce&mdash;however scatter-brained on occasions&mdash;has not
abused my confidence by reporting to Helen the conversation we
had about her.</p>

<p>By special dispensation, the girls were permitted to come
down-town to dine with me. It was a delightful evening. How
quickly Joyce reacted to the gracious presence of her charming
friend. Instantly, she dropped her recent role of blas and
world-weary cynicism&mdash;a part she is quite too flighty to
play convincingly&mdash;and became what she is, and ought to
admit being, an impressionable school-girl, with a wide knowledge
of the movie stars, a low opinion of Trigonometry, and an
insatiable appetite for chocolate fudge. She is about as
sophisticated as a pet rabbit. I have been so exasperated over
her silly attempts to be a bored duchess that it was refreshing,
indeed, to witness her return to a becoming simplicity.</p>

<p>Joyce never does things by halves. Having decided to set her
clock back, she came very near recovering her perambulator, which
had the effect of increasing the three years between herself and
Helen to about ten, and lessening by that much the chasm between
her lovely friend and me. I think Helen was a little bewildered,
at first, over this manoeuvre, but soon adjusted herself to my
child's metamorphosis.</p>

<p>While we were lingering over our coffee, Joyce&mdash;who
hadn't wanted any&mdash;said she was anxious to get a note off in
the mail and thought she would go and write it, if we'd excuse
her.</p>

<p>"I am greatly relieved, my dear," I said, as Joyce moved off.
"She is a different person when she's with you."</p>

<p>"I'm not conscious of doing anything to her," said Helen.</p>

<p>"That's just it!" I said. "You don't admonish or criticize.
It's effortless. That's the charm of your influence. It's not
because of anything you do. It's simply because you're you."</p>

<p>Her lips parted in a slow smile and her eyes lazily met
mine.</p>

<p>"You always say nice things to me," she said. "They build me
up." There was a little pause. "You like to build people up;
don't you?"</p>

<p>"You don't need any building up, Helen," I said,
sincerely.</p>

<p>"More than you'd think," she replied, soberly. "In my home no
one goes to much bother about it." Then, impulsively candid, she
added, "I think I'm at my best with you."</p>

<p>Perhaps she was hoping only to say something that would please
me, but her tone was so obviously sincere that it stirred me
deeply. I have been thinking seriously about it, since they left,
a while ago.</p>

<p>Suppose it is true. Suppose that Helen really feels that way.
I wonder if she might think that a constant companionship between
us would give her a self-assurance valuable enough to compensate
for the sacrifice she would have to make&mdash;of her youth.</p>

<p>Of course I would make a gallant effort to meet her age
halfway. I think her comradeship might rub out a few of my years.
She would unquestionably take on a quick maturity. But would it
be fair?</p>

<p>I reason this all out, neatly, and almost persuade myself that
the thing is possible, feasible, practical, commendable. And then
the implacable figures&mdash;unadorned by any elaborate
circumstantial extenuations&mdash;stand out like a problem in
simple arithmetic. I am a fool for giving way to this desire. I
shall not make a middle-aged matron of this radiant girl. It
wouldn't be right. But&mdash;God!&mdash;how I need her!</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">And I am going over to Baltimore to-morrow to
see Ramsey. The fact that my heart doesn't worry me to-night is
of no lasting significance. I daresay the present apparent
well-being of my heart is a simple psychological phenomenon, on
the order of the bad toothache that suddenly lets up when one is
on the way to the dentist.</p>

<p>I'll go to Baltimore in the morning. And I'll make an honest
effort to put Helen out of my mind. The thing is impossible; and
I may as well reconcile myself to that fact before I commit some
serious blunder. As it stands, I can have her for a devoted
friend. Perhaps I should be satisfied with that.</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>November twenty-seventh, 1919, 10.30
p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">TO-DAY was Thanksgiving. My chief grounds for
gratitude were provided by a telegram from Joyce saying that
Helen's attack of flu&mdash;of which I was informed, day before
yesterday&mdash;is very light, and that she is already on the
mend.</p>

<p>Helen is going home for a few days, to rest up, according to
Joyce's wire; though I think she would be far better off where
she is, in the hospital. I had a big notion to telegraph her to
that effect, but decided it was none of my business.</p>

<p>Joyce thought it better to remain in Washington through the
Thanksgiving recess and avoid the danger of picking up a flu germ
on the train, which I felt showed uncommon wisdom. I wish now
that I had urged them both to leave early and come here for the
vacation. We could have put Helen into Brightwood, when she took
sick.</p>

<p>This evening I had a little party at The Pontchartrain. I've
had a private tip that this fine old hotel is presently going out
of business. No announcement has been made yet, but it won't be
long.</p>

<p>My guests were Natalie, Dorothy, Harry, young Minton&mdash;
who has just come to Brightwood as assistant to Carter, and Nancy
Ashford. My decision to invite Nancy was somewhat of a surprise
to both of us. I never take her anywhere. Our business relations
at the hospital require us to see so much of each other that I
have thought it a safe policy to restrict our friendship to the
contacts we have there. It would be so easy to set people
chattering, if we went out together socially. I hate gossip.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, in the course of a little conference with
Nancy, she wanted to know whether I expected to be in town
to-day. I told her I had no other plans, except for an informal
dinner down-town with some young friends.</p>

<p>"Why don't you join us?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Sure you want me to?" countered Nancy, candidly.</p>

<p>"Of course!" I told her who would be there. "Do you good to
get out of here for a few hours."</p>

<p>"Won't Doctor Minton think it's odd?" Nancy's eyes registered
perplexity.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" I observed, loftily, "Doctor Minton's thoughts
haven't become very important around here yet."</p>

<p>"Don't you like him?" asked Nancy.</p>

<p>"Sure!" I said, firmly. "Only he has no right to do any
thinking about anything at Brightwood until he has been with us
for ten years, at least."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Nancy. "Thanks. Shall I meet you down
there&mdash;in Peacock Alley?"</p>

<p>"I'll come for you," I said. "About seven."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," said Nancy, stringing out the last syllable
derisively. "I'll go down in a taxi."</p>

<p>So&mdash;we left it that way. Damn it! If I'd had sense enough
to ask Nancy Ashford to marry me, ten years ago, she might have
done it; and we would have been immensely congenial. She would
have taken Joyce in hand and made a normal, stable child of her.
But Brightwood needed Nancy more than I did. If I were a little
more wise than I am, I might propose this to Nancy&mdash;even
now. But I doubt whether she would be the least bit interested.
We have been associated in business too long to pitch our
relations in any other key. We are very fond of each
other&mdash;but&mdash;that's as far as it goes.</p>

<p>Nancy nearly took my breath away to-night. I haven't seen her
in anything but hospital harness for a long time. She is
certainly a stunningly beautiful woman, with that youthful face
and white hair and trim lines. She was in black. It fitted as if
she'd been melted and poured into it.</p>

<p>Naturally, she had the opposite side of the table. I admired
the poise and assurance with which she accepted her hostess role.
I was very proud of Nancy Ashford, to-night. Occasionally I
caught her eye, and it came over me that she and I were very
close friends; very dependent on each other; very much more
intimately bound up together than I had thought. As a matter of
fact, I haven't thought much about it&mdash;for a long time. We
had our work to do. I wish I had a map of her mind.</p>

<p>Natalie, who sat on my right, showed me her engagement ring.
It hadn't been bought at the ten-cent store. I suppose Harry will
be paying for it over a considerable period. Natalie was
starry-eyed. I think this match is perfect. Harry is thoroughly
fine.</p>

<p>Dorothy, as usual, was very pretty, and self-contained.
Dorothy doesn't say much, but her eyes are bright. Doctor Minton
seemed to enjoy looking into them.</p>

<p>It was the traditional Thanksgiving dinner; turkey, mashed
potatoes and gravy, baked squash, cranberry sauce, etc. I wonder
what it is that a hotel does to a turkey that utterly relieves it
of any taste, at all. Have you ever noticed that? It always looks
fairly appetizing, and tastes like a lukewarm slice of
linoleum.</p>

<p>I drove Nancy home, over her mild protest. We talked mostly
about hospital affairs. When I let her out, she said, "It's none
of my business, but if I were you I shouldn't throw young Minton
and your Dorothy Wickes at each other."</p>

<p>"You think he's a trifler?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't surprise me," said Nancy.</p>

<p>"I hope he hasn't been making passes at any of our girls, here
at Brightwood," I growled.</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Nancy, quickly. "He is far too clever to do
that. But&mdash;I think he feels pretty sure that women ought to
find him practically irresistible."</p>

<p>"Do you think Dorothy was impressed?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;Doctor Minton is a handsome young fellow, witty,
amiable. Doubtless she enjoyed his attentions which, I thought,
were quite marked. Don't take this too seriously, please.
Only&mdash;as I said&mdash;if I were you I shouldn't contrive
occasions to further their acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the tip," I said. "Your hunches are usually
right."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">I wrote a letter to Helen to-night, inviting her
to spend the Christmas holidays with us. Perhaps I shouldn't have
done it.</p>

<p>I have again and again explained to myself how imprudent it
would be to pursue this hopeless friendship any farther. But, in
the face of my sober judgment, I wrote the letter. I even pressed
the invitation urgently. Heretofore, on similar occasions, I have
merely added my hope to Joyce's that she would come for a visit.
This time I told her that I was very anxious to have her come,
adding that Joyce&mdash;of course&mdash;joined heartily in the
invitation.</p>

<p>After I had written the letter I walked down to the corner and
mailed it, which is certainly proof enough that I wanted to make
sure my commonsense&mdash;possibly restored by
daylight&mdash;will have no chance to deter me from committing
this indiscretion.</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>December second, 1919, 9 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">JOYCE arrived home unexpectedly this morning. I
was at the hospital when she telephoned from the house. She was
sullen, sore, and uncommunicative. As soon as I could get away I
drove home and queried her.</p>

<p>The story was hard to extract. She has not yet confided the
full details, and may not do so. The most I can make of this
half-hysterical, disjointed, incoherent report is that she
slipped away from the school, just before dinner, the day before
yesterday, and went down-town in a taxi.</p>

<p>At the Raleigh she met, by appointment, two local girls who
had been expelled from the school, last spring, for
insubordination. They were her guests at dinner, and afterward
they went to a night club with three young men friends of the
Washington girls, and danced. She showed up in Chevy Chase
shortly after two, which she thinks is not very late for a young
woman of her age to be out, but the management seems to have
thought otherwise.</p>

<p>So they suspended her for the remainder of the year; and here
she is, at home, apparently much pleased over her recollection of
the things she said to the Principal before she left. I surmise
that these final impudences were of a flavour to insure my
daughter's future status in the esteem of the institution. It is
very unlikely that they will ever take her back.</p>

<p>I tried to be patient and sympathetic as Joyce shrieked and
blubbered her story. According to her view of the scrape, she has
been persecuted. She had done nothing deserving of censure; much
less suspension. It was just a few hours of innocent fun. She had
been in respectable company, and behaving discreetly. These
unwanted old prissies, instead of being cattishly jealous because
a girl had been invited out of their stuffy little reformatory
for some fresh air and lively music, should have been glad that
at least one of their charges still had enough pep left to
exercise her human rights&mdash;and so forth&mdash;and so on.</p>

<p>I knew better than to come to the defence of the school
management, at this stage of Joyce's dramatization of her woes,
and when I said, "Too bad," she shouted, "How do you
mean&mdash;'too bad!' I'll bet you don't mean it's too bad the
way they've thrown me out! You mean I'm too bad, and it's too bad
I am human, and too bad I like a little fun! That's what you
mean!"</p>

<p>By two o'clock I felt that I had had about all of this that
was good for me, and returned to the hospital. Before I left the
house I heard Joyce telephoning to one of her girl friends whose
acquaintance she made in the summer.</p>

<p>I came home early for dinner, this evening, hoping to find her
in a less rebellious mood. She had left a note for me, saying she
would be out for dinner. I suspect that I am now in for an
indeterminate period of anxiety. I wish I knew what to do. I
can't lock her up.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">There is one comforting ray of hope. I had a
letter from Helen to-day, in reply to my latest to her, saying
she is almost well again and is planning to be with us through
the Christmas holidays. Of course she had not yet learned of
Joyce's misfortune. I hope this does not affect her decision to
come, and I don't think it will; except possibly to make Helen
more sure she should come&mdash;and see what may be done for our
unhappy girl.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Nancy tells me to-day that our Perry Ruggles
slapped old Danny Ulrick yesterday. She says there has been bad
blood between Perry and Danny for some time. Yesterday Danny made
some remark that annoyed Perry. There was no fight. Danny, having
been soundly&mdash;and no doubt appropriately&mdash;slapped,
immediately demobilized himself and went at full gallop to report
his injury to the superintendent.</p>

<p>"I sent for Perry to come to my office at once," said
Nancy.</p>

<p>"And what did he have to say for himself?" I asked, with much
interest.</p>

<p>"He didn't come," said Nancy.</p>

<p>So&mdash;I suppose we will have to let Perry out of our
organization. I shall try to see him to-morrow and find out
whether there is anything we can do to save Martha. Nancy says
Martha is much chagrined. But if old Perry goes, Martha insists
that she will have to follow him.</p>

<p>I wouldn't have Nancy Ashford's job if it was the last bit of
employment left in the world.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Carter told me this afternoon that he wanted me
to be more circumspect with my digitalis. I had been feeling so
well, for a few weeks, that I had let the dosage run down. I feel
like an old man to-night.</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>December twenty-third, 1919, 4 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">I HAVE not been well for the past three weeks.
Until yesterday, I have been going to the hospital in the
mornings and coming home early in the afternoon. Joyce does not
realize that I have been ill. This is not her fault, for I have
made light of the fact that I am not pursuing my usual schedule
of work.</p>

<p>She sleeps all forenoon, and is gone for the remainder of the
day. A few times I have waited up for her, but she resents it and
is frank to say so.</p>

<p>Yesterday things came to a little crisis with me. I passed out
cold in the operating-room. It was an intracranial tumour&mdash;
a long, tiresome, exacting task. Fortunately I had Tim Watson
with me.</p>

<p>I have no recollection of fainting. When I roused, I was
propped up in bed, with Carter counting my wrist. I suddenly
remembered that I had been operating, and tried to raise up; but
I was too weak. Carter said, "You're all right. Take it easy.
Watson's carrying on. You were all done but the sutures. He can
manage."</p>

<p>"Queer," I mumbled. "Nothing like that ever happened to me
before. Didn't have the slightest bit of warning."</p>

<p>"It needn't happen any more," said Carter, encouragingly. "It
was a long job&mdash;and you're not quite up to par. You'll be
fit, after you've rested a little."</p>

<p>"I think I'll get up now," I said.</p>

<p>"Not yet," advised Carter. "I want you to stay right where you
are for a couple of hours. I'll be back presently."</p>

<p>I settled back on the pillows and noticed a hypodermic syringe
on the table. The Bates girl was standing there. I said, "What
was that?" She pretended she didn't know, which was of course the
proper behaviour for her. I said, "Hand it to me." She did so,
rather reluctantly. There was a minute particle of the solution
adhering to the point of the needle. I touched it to the tip of
my tongue. It was nitroglycerine. I hadn't fainted because of
fatigue. It was a heart attack.</p>

<p>Carter drove me home about four, Minton following in Carter's
car to pick him up. I didn't go to bed and Carter didn't insist
on it; said I would be just as well off lounging on the
davenport, not too flat. It sounded like good advice. Joyce did
not come home for dinner.</p>

<p>I feel ever so much better, to-day, than for several days. I'm
not fretting about myself. Carter said I should be quiet to-day,
and he evidently reinforced his suggestion. I know the stuff he
gave me has codeine in it. It accounts for my peace of mind.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Helen is coming to-morrow. I am not going to try
to meet her. Joyce can tell her I had to be at the hospital. I
hope I shall be well enough to entertain her properly. It would
be too bad if her visit were spoiled. Perhaps I can keep her from
finding out that I have had this little upset. If I am as much
better to-morrow as I am to-day, maybe she will not notice. Joyce
hasn't remarked about it. Gladys knows, but I told her not to say
anything.</p>

<p>Joyce insists that she is very happy over Helen's coming for
Christmas, but seems a bit embarrassed. Helen has been back at
school and of course knows the story of Joyce's escapade. Perhaps
they have had some correspondence about it: I don't know.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to to-morrow with mingled feelings.</p>
<hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>Christmas Eve, 1919, Midnight</i></h2>

<p class="first">THIS is indeed a Merry Christmas! My heart is
overflowing with joy!</p>

<p>I must try to record to-day's experiences in orderly fashion,
but it will not be easy to do. Five minutes ago I parted with
Helen at the foot of the stairs. I know that as long as I live
the memory of that enchanted moment will quicken my pulse.</p>

<p>This morning I rose in better health than I have had for a
month. I had a notion to accompany Joyce to the station. But I
had told her that she was to meet Helen without me, and she had
seemed pleased over the prospect. Perhaps she felt it was going
to be easier for her if she had an hour alone with Helen, at the
outset.</p>

<p>I drove to Brightwood. There had been a brain tumour operation
scheduled for nine-thirty this morning but they had postponed it.
I amazed my colleagues&mdash;and worried them, too, I
fear&mdash;by announcing that I was going to do the operation.
While we were scrubbing up for it, Tim said, "Are you sure you
want to do this? We can put it off a few days, you know. Give you
a little more time to get your strength back." I assured him I
had never felt more fit. So&mdash;we went into it. My hand was
never steadier. I think Tim and the nurses were relieved when I
had finished. I know they thought I ought to be at home in
bed.</p>

<p>It was after one before I could leave the hospital. For many
years it has been my custom to give small Christmas presents to
the nurses, orderlies, and all the help. Nancy always makes out
these cheques in figures consistent with the nature of the
employment and seniority in service. The cheques are enclosed in
gay greeting cards and distributed during the morning of the day
before Christmas.</p>

<p>It is difficult to account for the way some little traditions
get themselves established. I suppose that the first time we
issued these Christmas cheques, some employee&mdash;eager to show
his gratitude&mdash;came to my office at once to extend the
season's greetings. And then all the rest of them followed
suit.</p>

<p>At all events, I can expect&mdash;on the day before
Christmas&mdash; that before I leave the hospital our entire
outfit will swarm in on me with assorted felicitations and
expressions of thanks.</p>

<p>This morning I forgot about it. I daresay my absent-mindedness
was to be accounted for by my eagerness to go home and welcome
Helen. Shortly after eleven, I was on my way out of the building
when I met Nancy.</p>

<p>"You can't go," she said, in a stage whisper. "Have you
forgotten?"</p>

<p>It suddenly dawned on me what she meant.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Nancy," I said. "I'm afraid it slipped my mind."</p>

<p>"You feel all right; don't you?" she asked, anxiously. "You
mustn't stay&mdash;if you don't."</p>

<p>I assured her that wasn't the reason. I had forgotten; that
was all.</p>

<p>"Then you'd better wait," she advised. "They will be
disappointed if you don't."</p>

<p>I hesitated a little.</p>

<p>"Think so?" I queried. "I was hoping I might get away
early."</p>

<p>Nancy shook her head.</p>

<p>"If it isn't something positively urgent, you ought to wait."
Nancy seemed to have something on her mind. "You see," she went
on, slowly, "there's a rumour going around that you're not very
well. Everybody knows what happened. I think it will be just as
well if they all have a chance to see you to-day, and find out
for themselves that you're all right."</p>

<p>I have always despised loose chatter and indiscriminate
gossip. Nancy's report that there was a lot of buzz at Brightwood
over my little collapse annoyed me.</p>

<p>"You saw to it that they all had their usual gifts?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Nancy.</p>

<p>"And now I'm expected to sit in my office, for a couple of
hours, just to prove to them that I haven't had a stroke of
paralysis&mdash;or something. Well&mdash;I don't like the
idea."</p>

<p>"But you'll do it," wheedled Nancy, "because I asked you."</p>

<p>I turned about, took off my hat and coat, and trailed along
after her to my office. Presently they began streaming in, the
word that I was ready to receive them having got about quickly by
the mysterious grapevine process of communication. I tried to
greet them all with the usual exuberance, but I'm afraid the
affair wasn't quite satisfactory. Most of them came to my desk
with anxious, questioning eyes, as if they were trying to make a
quick diagnosis. Their attitude perplexed me; chilled me a
little. Some of them seemed almost strangers. I tried my best to
be natural, probably overdoing it; and a few of the brassier ones
showed an enthusiastic cordiality that was too strident to be
spontaneous.</p>

<p>When it appeared that my large family had all been in, and I
was making ready to leave&mdash;with the disturbing sensation
that if they had been apprehensive about me before, they would
probably be even more so now&mdash;grim old Perry Ruggles hobbled
through the doorway and confronted me with a heavy frown. I was
pulling on my overcoat.</p>

<p>"I ain't a-takin' it," he growled, deep in his throat. He laid
the cheque down on the desk, and pushed it toward me with a
work-worn finger. "I ain't been nothin' but a lot o' trouble to
yuh." It was plain to see that Perry had composed this speech
with all the wormy abasement of the Prodigal Son. I could hardly
keep my face straight. "Yuh've paid me more'n I earned," he
rumbled. "Ef 't-waren't fer Martha, yuh wouldn't hev me around,
'n' I wouldn't blame yuh. I'm no good here."</p>

<p>I walked to the door and closed it, returned to my desk, and
seated myself. "Sit down, won't you?" I said. "Let's have a
little chat about it."</p>

<p>Perry gingerly lowered himself into the chair, and sat on the
edge of it, scowling inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you haven't been entirely happy here. Perry," I
began, "but that's probably because the work you have been asked
to do has not interested you very much. You have known you were
employed here because we needed your sister. I understand your
feeling, and I know I should feel the same way myself. I have
been trying to think of something more pleasant for you to
do."</p>

<p>Perry's lips were still pursed tightly, but his brow had
smoothed a little.</p>

<p>"I don't like it&mdash;in town," he muttered. "Neither does
Martha, fer that sake. Ef 't-waren't fer Miss Ashford, a-bein' so
good t' her, she'd go back t' the country with me."</p>

<p>Suddenly I had an inspiration.</p>

<p>"Perry," I said, "I have a little place up on Lake Saginack
where I am going to build a house in the spring; soon as the
weather permits. I have had a lot of trees planted there, and
shrubbery. How would you like the job of caretaker?"</p>

<p>Perry rubbed his jaw carefully, which I interpreted as a
bargaining gesture. This, I felt, was enough progress for one
session. And I was anxious to get away.</p>

<p>"What all would I hev t' do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We can figure that out," I said, rising. "You stay here and
try to content yourself for the present&mdash;and we'll talk
about the other thing when we get around to it. And as for this
little Christmas gift," I added, "I shall be more pleased if you
take it. If you feel you do not deserve it, how about converting
it into a present for someone else?"</p>

<p>Perry's upper lip lifted in amazement, and he blinked a few
times. I suppose it was the first time that an idea of this
nature ever collided with Perry. His expression was so amusing
that I had to hold on tight to keep from ruining our delicate
relationship.</p>

<p>"Didn't you ever do anything like that?" I asked. "It's great
fun." Then&mdash;perhaps because I had already startled Perry
with a strange suggestion, I thought I would see whether he could
survive another harder jolt. "It's even more fun," I went on, "if
you give the present to someone who isn't expecting anything, and
will be surprised."</p>

<p>Perry drew a crooked grin and said he 'lowed almost anybody'd
be surprised ef they got a present frum him. This struck us both
as being very funny indeed and we laughed together. Perry's
merriment was noisily uncouth, but short-lived. He quickly
resumed his habitual frown, apparently repenting that he had let
himself go in this unseemly manner.</p>

<p>"If you don't happen to know anyone to try this out on," I
said, "I'd like to make a suggestion. Have you ever noticed this
sharp-nosed little kid that comes every day with somebody's
lunch?"</p>

<p>Perry eyed me suspiciously from under shaggy brows.</p>

<p>"Yeah," he replied, unpleasantly. "That's this here Ulrick
feller's grandson."</p>

<p>"He's certainly a ragged little rascal," I remarked. "I
suppose everything he wears has been passed along to him, after
it has been worn out by his brothers."</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Perry sourly. "I guess so. Old man Ulrick has
to feed a passel of 'em."</p>

<p>I picked up the cheque and handed it to Perry.</p>

<p>"There you are," I said. "You go and see how much fun you can
have with it."</p>

<p>"Yuh mean&mdash;get some shoes, er sumpin, fer that kid?"
Perry's tone was loaded with distaste. "By Gar! That's more'n old
Ulrick'd ever do fer any o' my kin, I'll bet!"</p>

<p>"I think you're probably right," I said. "I imagine that Danny
has missed a lot of fun in his life. I suppose he has had his
nose on the grindstone so hard that he never had a chance to give
himself a treat."</p>

<p>"Himself a treat?" echoed Perry, derisively. "Yuh mean&mdash;
I'd be givin' myself a treat ef I got this kid some shoes?"</p>

<p>"Of course," I declared. "I must go now. Perry. Good luck with
your experiment."</p>

<p>Perry blocked my way.</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;but see here," he muttered. "Ef I do that, old
Ulrick will think I'm a-tryin' t' be friendly like, and we ain't
spoke fer weeks."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, in that case," I remarked casually, "maybe you'd
better not do anything about it. If it's more fun not to speak to
old Danny than to get his grandson some shoes, let it go. I
expect you're right. If you gave the shoes to the kid, old Danny
would probably want to speak to you&mdash;and, of course, that
would be annoying. Just forget about it. Perry. Bye-bye. Merry
Christmas." I went out and left him standing there.</p>

<p>On the way out, I met Nancy again. I had a broad grin on my
face, and Nancy said, "What have you been up to?" Perry was
hobbling down the hall. She tipped her head slightly in his
direction and asked, "Have you, by any chance, been entertaining
yourself at that poor thing's expense?"</p>

<p>I nodded, and assumed the guilty look of a child caught in the
jam-jar.</p>

<p>"Does&mdash;does he know it?" asked Nancy, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I think so," I said, soberly. "And I believe he was
entertained a little, too. Did you ever hear Perry laugh?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" she declared. "Want to tell me?"</p>

<p>"No," I said. "Not now. Merry Christmas, Nancy!"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Helen's greeting was very tender, giving me both
hands, her smiling eyes full of sincere affection. I wanted to
kiss her. Had my feelings toward her been simply that of a
middle-aged parent, welcoming his child's best friend into his
home, I might have done so. But I knew I could not pretend to
exercise a doting father's privilege in greeting a young guest.
If I kissed Helen, it wouldn't be a mere gesture of hospitality.
So&mdash;I rejected the impulse, but retained her hands, and I am
afraid that as I looked into her uplifted eyes she must have
divined my wish; for she flushed a little, and seemed anxious to
include Joyce quickly into our mutual expression of
happiness.</p>

<p>They were dressed for the street, Joyce having secured tickets
for a matine. It was suggested that they might be able to find a
seat for me, but I declined, thinking it much better to let them
be alone together. I was very happy. The old relationship between
the girls had been resumed, and it was easy to see that Joyce was
finding much satisfaction in readjusting herself to match Helen's
poise and manner. The strained, half-rebellious expression had
vanished from my child's mobile face. Helen exercises some
strange witchery that transforms Joyce into a person of beauty
and charm.</p>

<p>I spent the afternoon alone with my thoughts. It was good to
feel physically fit again. It was good to see Joyce doffing her
brittle affectations. It was very healing to my spirit to have
Helen near me again.</p>

<p>It was almost six when they returned, tarrying before the open
fire, for the temperature had dropped, and they were chilled. At
Joyce's suggestion, we dressed for dinner. I was glad she had not
wanted to go out. We met in the library at seven. I was proud of
my dinner companions. They were very lovely. Joyce was in blue
and Helen in coral.</p>

<p>Our talk skipped about, with no central purpose; no serious
intent. When the dessert came on, there was a little lull in our
conversation, and I remarked&mdash;quite fervently&mdash;that it
was a very happy occasion; that it was delightful to have Helen
with us. I surprised myself by saying, "I don't see how we can
ever let you go."</p>

<p>"Why need she ever go?" said Joyce, turning fond eyes toward
Helen. "You're happier here than anywhere else; aren't you,
darling?"</p>

<p>My heart skipped a beat. I hoped Helen would appraise the
remark as one of Joyce's undeliberated disbursements, and make
some rejoinder that would tag it as a spontaneous outburst of
affection.</p>

<p>Helen did not reply, for a moment. A slow flush crept up her
cheek, and she did not lift her eyes.</p>

<p>"See?" exclaimed Joyce, ecstatically. "It's true! Let's keep
her, Daddy!"</p>

<p>It was a pretty tense moment. At least it was for me. And when
Gladys popped in to tell Joyce that Mr. Masterson wanted her on
the telephone I was pleased that something had intervened to
remove her until we could tug the conversation back to firmer
ground.</p>

<p>"Joyce," I said, when she was gone, "sometimes does her
thinking afterward." I chuckled a little, as if I had thought the
situation mildly amusing. Helen, still pink, smiled, but made no
comment.</p>

<p>"Of course," I went on, drawing an aimless little design on my
ice-cream, "I couldn't imagine anything more wonderful&mdash;
than to have you with us&mdash;always."</p>

<p>Helen slowly reached out her hand and laid it on mine. I
wrapped my fingers tightly about it, and searched her eyes. She
gave a quick little intake of breath. I rose and drew her to her
feet. She came into my arms, and I kissed her. Her response was
all that a starved heart could wish.</p>

<p>After a long moment, I released her a little, and said, rather
breathlessly, "My darling&mdash;I have wanted you&mdash;so very
much!"</p>

<p>"I know," she whispered. "It's all right."</p>

<p>"Can you forget how many years there are between us?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"I forgot that," she murmured, "a long time ago."</p>

<p>I held her close to me again.</p>

<p>"Joyce will be coming back," she said, softly.</p>

<p>"Shall we tell her&mdash;now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Of course. She would know, anyhow. And we mustn't leave her
out. That would spoil everything&mdash;for all three of us."</p>

<p>What a sensible creature she is! I suppose that's the first
and biggest reason I have for loving her. She intuitively
understands. She knows what to do, what to say, how to say it,
when to say it. She has <i>savoir faire</i>. <i>Savoir faire</i>
is not an achievement, but a talent. You have it, or you don't.
No amount of cultivation will give it to you. Helen possesses it
in its perfection.</p>

<p>We resumed our places at the table. Joyce rejoined us, and
asked airily what we had been talking about in her absence.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;for one thing"&mdash;I tried to keep my voice
steady&mdash; "I repeated to Helen your wish that she remain with
us&mdash; always."</p>

<p>Joyce's eyes widened and she stared at us with curiosity.</p>

<p>"It was all your fault," said Helen.</p>

<p>"You darlings!" exclaimed Joyce. She pushed back her chair,
threw her arms around Helen's neck, and kissed her. Then she came
to me, hugged me tight, kissed me&mdash;and cried like a little
child; because she was excited, I think. I know she didn't cry
because she was unhappy.</p>

<p>Arm in arm we went back to the library for coffee. Joyce, who
had quite recovered her balance, said she didn't want any, and
would be back after a while.</p>

<p>Helen said, "I hope Joyce is going to like this idea."</p>

<p>"After she gets accustomed to it," I said. "It's new to all of
us."</p>

<p>"Not to me," murmured Helen.</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;the idea that it has really come to pass," I
said. "As for wishing it might happen, I haven't thought about
anything else for a long time."</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered. "I know."</p>

<p>My sense of well-being surged through me like a transfusion. I
remembered an old text that I hadn't thought of for years, and
repeated it, half to myself. "They shall mount up on wings as
eagles. They shall run and not be weary. They shall
walk&mdash;and not faint."</p>

<p>"Is that the way you feel?" asked Helen, softly, knowing the
answer.</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"That wasn't said of people in love," she said, smiling, "but
of those who trust in the Lord."</p>

<p>"Very well," I said, "I also trust in the Lord. He has been
very kind&mdash;and I am on His side."</p>

<p>Joyce came down, at eleven, in a fluffy dressing-gown and
asked us whether we were getting along all right without her
chaperonage. I hope she isn't going to adopt this role
permanently. It's bound to be an awkward situation if she poses
us as lovers who need her mature counsel.</p>

<p>She left us, after a while, kissing us both and telling us not
to sit up too late.</p>

<p>Helen and I practically discussed our future plans. I asked
her if she could consent to an early marriage and she seemed
entirely willing. I suggested a trip to Europe for the three of
us, and she thought it a grand idea.</p>

<p>I put my arm about her and went with her to the stairway. I
kissed her good night. She moved up on the next step, where she
was on a level with me, and kissed me again.</p>

<p>I am very happy. Life has been very good to me.</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>December twenty-seventh, 1919, 11.30
p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">THE three of us spent the evening discussing
travel plans. Joyce is entering whole-heartedly into our program,
seeming to be in full approval of our early wedding; and, of
course, bubbling with enthusiasm over the prospect of our trip to
Europe.</p>

<p>Helen goes home to-morrow. She had expected to remain until
after New Year's Day, but feels now that she should not delay her
preparations for our marriage which, we have agreed, is to occur
on the eleventh.</p>

<p>It is really at Helen's insistence that we are being married
so soon. I was content to wait until she had graduated in June.
But she thinks that if I need her at all I need her now.
Naturally we have talked over Joyce's problem candidly. Helen
thinks that if Joyce is permitted to run at large here, for
another five or six months, it may be difficult to reclaim her.
She thinks, also, that my own worry over Joyce should be relieved
at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>I do not know exactly how much sacrifice it entails, on
Helen's part, to give up school, this close to graduation. She
assures me that she is glad to do it, and seems not to be
fretting over it.</p>

<p>So we are arranging to be married in a fortnight. It will be a
very simple wedding, with a half-dozen friends in attendance. And
on the next Thursday afternoon we sail on the <i>Aquitania</i>
for Cherbourg.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">In spite of Nancy Ashford's tactful but urgent
warning, the other day, that all Brightwood was chattering about
my ill health, it had not occurred to me that this anxiety had
become a subject of formal discussion by the staff.</p>

<p>I had no operations scheduled for to-day, and did not arrive
at the hospital until half-past ten. After making a few visits on
patients of mine, I put in a call to Ann Arbor and told Doctor
Leighton I was going away presently on a two months' vacation.
There are only three head cases here now, under observation, and
waiting for surgery. Two of them Watson can handle alone.
Leighton promised me he would look after the third, and any other
cases which may show up, though I think Tim can give a good
account of himself in all but a few problems. Leighton says he
will be available whenever Watson wants him.</p>

<p>At noon, when I was preparing to leave, Nancy came in and said
that Doctor Pyle wished to see me. I thought this odd, for I had
encountered Pyle two or three times in the course of the morning
and he had had every opportunity to talk. Apparently this was
something private.</p>

<p>"Know what Pyle has on his mind?" I asked, casually.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Nancy&mdash;but she did not elaborate and I
respected her prudence.</p>

<p>"I hope it isn't anything that will detain me very long," I
said. "I have an engagement at home."</p>

<p>"Shall I see if I can find him?" suggested Nancy. "Perhaps he
can come at once&mdash;and get it over with."</p>

<p>I said, "Very well," and Nancy slipped away. I confess I
didn't like her employment of the phrase&mdash;"Get it over
with"&mdash;a stock remark with us when counselling agitated
patients to submit to surgery.</p>

<p>Pyle seemed quite a bit flustered when he came in. Ever since
I have known the testy old chap&mdash;and that is a very long
time&mdash;he has had a funny trick of tipping up his lower lip,
when embarrassed or bewildered, and gnawing absurdly at the tip
of his diminutive goatee. In order to accomplish this manoeuvre,
he is obliged to spread his mouth almost from ear to ear,
achieving a mirthless grin that startles persons who observe this
phenomenon for the first time.</p>

<p>He was pursuing this little whisker with his upper incisors as
he took the chair opposite me, and I knew that something had gone
wrong. Pyle had come on a difficult errand.</p>

<p>I gave him a cigar, lighted it for him, and said, "What's the
matter, beloved? You look as if you might have taken the wrong
kidney out of somebody."</p>

<p>"We must have a little chat, Hudson," he began, ignoring my
chaff. "About your health. It's getting breezed around that
you're in bad shape. Also that you insist on keeping up with your
usual schedule. Now, if that goes on much longer, it is going to
hurt you&mdash;and it might hurt Brightwood. We think you should
take a vacation."</p>

<p>"Who are we'?" I snapped.</p>

<p>"The staff," replied Pyle. "All of us. It's unanimous. We met,
afternoon before Christmas, and talked it over. Felt like
traitors, of course. Hated to do it in your absence. Everybody
was agreed to that. Everybody was sympathetic&mdash;and on your
side&mdash;and wanting to do the right thing. I hope you will
understand that. Nobody thinks you're done for. But we all feel
that you should get away&mdash;for six months, maybe. Rusticate.
Travel. Play."</p>

<p>Without giving me an opening, the good old boy carried on with
his suggestions. He had a large envelope, crammed with cruise
advertisements. Apparently he had gone to no end of bother to set
up a half-dozen tentative trips for me.</p>

<p>"Now, here you have&mdash;" said Pyle, spreading out a map of
the world on my desk, and inching his chair closer, after the
approved manner of a high-pressure salesman. "Now, here you have
a delightful tour around the world. Go west, stop at Honolulu,
smell the flowers, listen to the marimbas&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean the ukuleles," I put in. "Do I? Very well, then. The
ukuleles! And then you go to Tahiti! Think of that, Hudson!
Tahiti! Marvellous! I confess I've always wanted to do that, but
I've been so damned healthy that nobody ever thought of shipping
me away for a rest. This will be a great thing for you, Hudson.
Take your daughter along. Stop in Europe on the way back. Spend
some time in Germany with the brain tinkers. Now&mdash;you do
that! This is very important!"</p>

<p>Of course I knew it would be up to me to tell Pyle&mdash;and
all the rest of them&mdash;about my plans for the European tour,
but I hadn't quite got myself nerved up to confide about the
wedding. Perhaps this irresolution means nothing less than that I
expected Pyle to be utterly disgusted when he learned of it. The
fact that I was postponing the hour when this news must come to
light disturbed me. I wasn't ready to tell him; not yet. I would
organize a little speech, explaining it all, so he could
understand how I happened to decide on matrimony. I couldn't tell
Pyle that I had fallen in love with a girl young enough to be my
daughter, but I could tell him she would be a steadying influence
for my Joyce. And this would be true enough for all practical
purposes. But I must have a little more time to consolidate my
campaign of self-defence.</p>

<p>So&mdash;I heartily agreed with Pyle that I had been working
too hard; told him I had plans made to build a cottage up on
Saginack and go up there, for two or three days every week, soon
as the nice weather came along.</p>

<p>Pyle gnawed his goatee, while I was elaborating on this, and
it was easily to be seen that I wasn't making much of an
impression. He interrupted me, presently, to inquire what was
going to become of me&mdash;and all the rest of us&mdash;in the
meantime.</p>

<p>I saw then that I might as well let him have it. I said,
"Pyle, I hope this won't knock you cold. I'm going down to
Philadelphia, week after next, to marry my daughter's school
friend. Miss Helen Brent."</p>

<p>Pyle was stunned. If I had pulled a pistol out of my pocket
and shot myself, I doubt if his strained expression of
incredulity could have registered a bigger shock. I couldn't help
grinning. I waited a moment for him to recover, and when it was
obvious that the blow had struck his speech centre, I went on to
give him some details; told him about our projected trip to
Europe&mdash;and everything.</p>

<p>He gradually came up out of his semi-conscious condition, and
I gave him a fresh cigar. He bit the end off mechanically, and
drew back a little, defensively, when I approached with a lighted
match. I know he thought I had lost my mind. I laughed. And he
finally found his tongue.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;well," he croaked feebly. "That's
very&mdash;surprising. Many happy returns."</p>

<p>Then I began at the beginning and told him all about it,
making no bones about the worry I had had with Joyce, Helen's
remarkable hold on her, and the circumstances leading up to our
recent decision. I don't know whether Pyle accepted any of it as
reasonable, but when he left he was at least able to get away
without assistance. At the door he wanted to know how much of
this was a secret, and I told him it should be
sufficient&mdash;for the present&mdash;to say that I was going
abroad with my daughter. They could learn the rest of it when it
happened.</p>

<p>Then, after some hesitation, he asked how much of the story he
should tell to Mrs. Ashford. This distressed me a little. The
fact is, I should have confided in Nancy at once. It isn't quite
fair for me to have kept this a secret from her, seeing how close
we have been, through all these years.</p>

<p>I daresay Pyle has had it in the back of his old head, for a
long time, that Nancy and I would marry, some day. And I suppose
it might strike him that such a match would be immeasurably more
suitable.</p>

<p>"I'll tell her myself," I said. And Pyle went out, and closed
the door.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">I called up Fred Ferguson, this afternoon, and
told him I was going away for a couple of months, and wondered
whether he could get the plans for my house in the country ready
for me to see by the end of next week. He thought he could. I
hope they can get going on it, so I can have some use of it
during the coming summer.</p>

<p>This has been an eventful day and I am very tired. I am
feeling the reaction from the difficult interview I had with
Pyle. I suppose I should have sent for Nancy, after he left. I
mustn't let much more time slip by until I tell her.</p>

<p>There is really no reason why I should feel any embarrassment
about this. The relations between Nancy and me certainly do not
call for any apologies. I never gave her any reason to think that
we belonged to each other, except in the bonds of an invaluable
business friendship. Perhaps I'm making a mountain of a
mole-hill. Maybe Nancy has no such thoughts in her head. I hope
not. Still, I wish I didn't have this to look forward to. Damn
it!&mdash;why should I feel so sensitive about letting my friends
into this secret? It's nobody's business&mdash;is it&mdash;whom I
marry? I don't owe anyone an explanation. Perhaps I should have
said something to Tim.</p> <hr>

<h2>AT HOME<br> <i>January eighth, 1920, 11.30 p.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">THIS is undoubtedly the last entry I shall make
in my journal until after our return from abroad. The day has
been confusingly crowded with last-minute duties. I hope I have
not forgotten anything of importance. Joyce and I are leaving
to-morrow for Philadelphia where the wedding occurs on the
morning of the eleventh. The time is growing short.</p>

<p>I am very restless to-night, and in need of diversion. To be
quite frank, I might not otherwise be writing this. I have no
inclination to read, I am not sleepy; besides, I told Joyce I
would wait up for her, hoping it might encourage her return at a
reasonable hour. She has gone somewhere with young Masterson.</p>

<p>There is no need for anxiety about the successful management
of affairs at Brightwood during my absence. The staff is
harmonious, loyal, efficient; and Nancy is at the helm. Nancy has
given her full approval of my plans. There has been no
constraint. I am glad of that.</p>

<p>I find that for many years I have been assuming that
Brightwood, without my constant oversight, might promptly
disintegrate. Of course I haven't been vain enough to say that to
myself in so many words, but the bare fact that I have never felt
free to take an extended vacation is proof that I felt the
hospital could not get along without me.</p>

<p>It occurred to me to-day, after interviewing several members
of the staff, that it wouldn't matter much if I never came back
to Brightwood at all. When I bade good-bye to Nancy I remarked to
that effect. Naturally she comforted my vanity by saying they
would be simply marking time and hoping to keep things running
smoothly until I returned.</p>

<p>I told her I had discovered a sin that the prayer-book had not
taken into account. I recited what I could remember of the litany
used at Trinity Cathedral in Chicago. This quaint confession had
invited the good Lord to deliver us from all evil and mischief;
from the crafts and assaults of the devil; from envy, hatred, and
malice; but, I observed, it should also have prayed that we be
delivered from indispensability. And in all seriousness I believe
it disrupts a man's honest dealings with himself
when&mdash;perhaps unwittingly&mdash;he begins to think that his
home and his business couldn't possibly carry on without him.</p>

<p>Among the many callers who came this afternoon to extend their
good wishes was my excellent old friend Caleb Weatherby. I had
not seen him for nearly a year. He is spending the worst of the
winter here. Before our return from Europe, he will have gone
back to his home on Lake Moosehead in Maine. He had read in the
papers that I was going abroad and came to pay his respects.</p>

<p>I cannot remember having spoken of him in this journal. He
insists that I saved his life, and this may not be far from the
truth, though the rescue was effected in a manner that may strike
you as amusing. And if you have any fondness for baked beans, the
story may make you hungry.</p>

<p>Late last fall, a year ago, Doctor Grant, one of our local
physicians, called up one day to ask if he might bring in for
observation a patient who had attempted suicide and was so deep
in melancholia that he would probably finish the job at the first
opportunity. Grant said the case history indicated a healthy and
stable mind, until quite recently, and he felt that only a
pathological condition could account for a depression so stubborn
and dangerous.</p>

<p>Weatherby was brought in, the next morning, by his son. I did
not at once see the old gentleman but had an hour with the son, a
personable and fairly prosperous business man of thirty-eight to
forty, who seemed loyally concerned about his father's
plight.</p>

<p>He gave me the facts briefly. Weatherby, senior, had spent his
life in Maine. He had always been active and most of his time had
been spent out of doors, cutting timber, running a mill, making
maple products. A few months before his wife had died, Weatherby,
junior, and his wife had proposed to the old gentleman that he
come to Detroit and live with them, because he was lonely and
without employment. It was his first experience in a large city.
After a few days, he began to be moody, taciturn, and glum. They
tried to interest him in their own affairs, took him to the
movies, made an effort to include him in their social life; but
to no avail.</p>

<p>I thought I had a pretty good picture of the old fellow's
dilemma. The problem of an old man, who comes to live with his
son and his daughter-in-law, is much more serious than for the
old lady who finds herself in the same circumstances. There are
plenty of little things she can do to entertain herself, and
small services she can perform which preserve her self-respect as
a useful member of the household. She can knit stockings, sew on
buttons, feed the baby, help in the kitchen on the maid's day
out. There is very little that an old man can do. In the case of
Weatherby, the enforced idleness and sense of dependence had made
him loathe himself. He would sit for days on end, refusing to
speak, and now he had gone to the limit of desperation by
attempting suicide.</p>

<p>That afternoon I went up to my new patient's room. For a man
approaching seventy, he was as fine a specimen of physical
fitness as I have ever seen; nor have I ever seen anyone more
stolidly depressed. He was sitting by the window, with his big,
shaggy head in his hands, and when I told him who I was he did
not look up. I sat down near him and began asking him leading
questions but could get nothing out of him but grunts and growls
and shrugs.</p>

<p>After a while he grew exasperated and barked out shrilly that
I could go to hell with my questions, that he was tired of
living, that he had lived too long, that he was only a nuisance,
that he wished he was dead, that he was sorry the poison hadn't
got to work before they pumped him out, that he was going to do a
better job, next time; that it was none of my damn business how
he felt, and would I go away and leave him alone?</p>

<p>I then resorted to the familiar technique of agreeing with
him, which occasionally has the effect of making a
functional&mdash;but almost never a
pathological&mdash;melancholic rouse to his own defence. Slipping
to the edge of my chair and pocketing my notebook and consulting
my watch, to sign that I had lost interest and was about to
depart, I ostentatiously stifled a yawn, the old man regarding me
with sour distaste but with a trace of grim curiosity.</p>

<p>"You're probably right, Mr. Weatherby," I drawled. "You are
sixty-eight. A man at that age is, as you say, a nuisance and far
better off dead. Any old duffer of your years is practically
worthless, even if he has fairly good health; and I suppose
you've been puny and sickly, most of your life."</p>

<p>That popped him! If I had touched off a cannon cracker under
his chair he couldn't have responded any more promptly. It
delighted me to see how mad he was!</p>

<p>As soon as he had yelled, "Puny! Sickly! Me!" I knew there
wasn't anything the matter with that fine old head. "Puny?" he
shouted. By Gemini, he'd bet he could take me outside and tie me
into a hard knot! Then the glitter faded from his eyes and he
suddenly subsided, with slumped shoulders, into his habitual
gloom. But this did not discourage me. Apparently it had been a
long time since he had blown the whistle, and the noise had
startled him.</p>

<p>"Well," I remarked, with an infuriating grin, "we frequently
find frail people making big threats. Now, tell me the truth, Mr.
Weatherby, didn't you have quite a lot of lung trouble when you
were a young man?"</p>

<p>This time he got down to business! "Lung trouble! Who? Me?
Hell!" Then he proceeded to inform me that at the age of fifteen
he was doing a man's work in the woods; came from sturdy stock;
his father had been killed by a falling tree at the age of
seventy-six, still able to swing an ax with the best of 'em. Then
he melted back into his chair again and scowled at the
window.</p>

<p>"How did that happen?" I inquired. He shook his head crossly
and did not reply. I thought I would try another bait. "I saw
your son," I said. "Sort of mean-looking fellow. Not much wonder
you're tired of living with such a sour crab. I suppose his
wife's a nagger. Probably that's what makes him abuse you. Two of
'em in cahoots to drive you out of their house."</p>

<p>At that, he turned on me venomously. He'd have me understand
that his son was one of the finest men in the world, and his wife
had done everything to make him comfortable. And anybody who said
she was a nagger was a dirty liar. Nobody could be any sweeter
than Florence. Then the old man's eyes gushed sudden tears, and I
saw that we were really making some headway. His hands were shaky
as he filled his pipe, and his noble old nose was a-drip. He was
still mad at me, but I knew now that I could make him talk, and
felt it was time to conciliate.</p>

<p>"Of course I don't think your boy is mean," I said, gently.
"And I don't think his wife is a nagger. And I know they both
love you. But&mdash;you wouldn't talk to me, and I had to do
something about it."</p>

<p>He nodded, understandingly, and puffed in silence.</p>

<p>"And the fact is," I went on, "I never saw a healthier man
than you are. You don't look as if you'd ever seen a sick day in
your life. That probably comes from living in the woods. Must be
a great experience to live up there in Maine. I wish you would
tell me something about it."</p>

<p>That was exactly what he wanted to talk about, and for the
next hour he gave me a treat. In the coldest weeks of the winter
they felled the trees and dressed out the timber. Then, at the
first thaw, they reopened their little mill. It ran by
water-power, and operated only for a couple of months while the
early spring freshets made the stream bank-full. In the mill,
they sawed up lumber and ground meal and feed. There was a fine
maple grove, hard by. They gathered the sap and boiled it down.
In the mill there was a big brick chimney and a huge
fireplace.</p>

<p>And it was at this point that we came to the beans, which
played so important a part in Caleb Weatherby's
reconditioning.</p>

<p>"We used to bake beans in that fireplace," rumbled the old
man. "And they were beans, let me tell you! No beans like that
any more. People have forgot how to make 'em."</p>

<p>"How?" I demanded. "I like baked beans. But it's hard to get
them cooked right. Too dry, I think."</p>

<p>"There you are," agreed Weatherby. "Hard as buckshot, and dry
enough to choke you to death. The way we fixed our beans: first
we soaked 'em, of course, and then boiled 'em; put 'em in a stone
pot, with plenty of salt pork, and salt and pepper and mustard,
and an onion with a clove stuck in it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And molasses," I assisted, when he paused to recollect.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but not sorghum. We boiled down the maple syrup
until it was thick as sorghum, and poured in plenty; and then we
did the thing that made 'em different! Level teaspoonful of
ginger. Ever hear of ginger in beans?"</p>

<p>I hadn't, but it sounded all right, for I was hungry. It
occurred to me that we might now tap the old torpid cistern again
and see if we could get into it and bounce out of it.</p>

<p>"Look here!" I said. "If you're really serious about
committing suicide, how about coming over to my house, some day,
before you do it, and make up a nice big pot of those beans for
me?"</p>

<p>The old man pulled a twisted grin and relighted his pipe.</p>

<p>"By Gemini&mdash;that's a pretty cool way to talk," he
growled, with a mirthless chuckle. "You want me to make you a pot
o' them Maine beans&mdash;and then I can go and kill myself, if I
want to."</p>

<p>"Well," I explained, brightly, "you said you were going to
kill yourself, anyhow, and the beans do seem very good. I
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right," declared Weatherby, nodding his head. "I'll just
do that for you. When shall I come?"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Our Gladys has had the run of the house for so
long that she lacks the discipline of a well-trained servant. She
has had no illusions about her value to my establishment and
talks back quite freely. Whenever our views have failed to
coincide, I have promptly abandoned my position. Gladys is indeed
a treasure; but, unfortunately, she has long since found that
out. I confess it was with some diffidence that I informed her,
in the morning at breakfast, that a fine old gentleman from Maine
was going to spend the next day in her kitchen, making us a nice
big pot of baked beans.</p>

<p>Gladys was a bit stunned at first, but presently recovered
sufficiently to inquire what was the matter with her baked beans,
and since when did we have to hire some old man to come all the
way from Maine&mdash;</p>

<p>"Just a minute," I broke in, firmly, though I suspected it was
going to take longer than that; "this gentleman is so lonely in
Detroit that it has made him ill."</p>

<p>"In the head?" inquired Gladys, remembering my specialty.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;he's not insane, if that's what you're wondering.
He has nothing to do, and he's tired of sitting around idle. But
he does know how to make marvellous baked beans. And I want you
to let him do anything he wants to do in the kitchen&mdash;all
day to-morrow."</p>

<p>Gladys sniffed and was about to deliver an oration. I had
heard them before, and recognized the early symptoms. I held up
my cup for more coffee and proceeded with my remarks. I told
Gladys she had a chance to do something for this good man.</p>

<p>"Lots of people," I went on, "are going around half dead, and
wishing they were wholly dead, because there's nobody to talk to
about the only thing they're interested in. And one of the finest
investments you can make, in restoring life to such wilted and
discouraged people, is to make them see that this one thing
they've got is important; worth doing; worth talking about. If
you want to give yourself a happy day, Gladys, stand by this old
man and make a big fuss over his ability to cook beans."</p>

<p>"And keep the kitchen in a muss all day," grumbled Gladys,
quite truthfully, no doubt.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," I capitulated, with a beaten sigh. "If it's
more important that you keep your kitchen nice and tidy,
to-morrow, than to humour a lonesome old fellow who needs
somebody to build him up and make him think more of himself, you
just forget it."</p>

<p>I waited for Gladys to retire to her domain, but she stood
there thoughtfully scowling. Gladys is not pretty when she
meditates.</p>

<p>"Of course," I went on, mumbling through my toast, "I said to
myself, 'Gladys will get the idea at once, and be glad to do it.
Gladys will stand at the old boy's elbow and watch him mix up his
mess, which she could probably do very much better&mdash;and she
will oh and ah and be surprised&mdash;and pleased to learn; and
that will make the old fellow so proud of himself that he'll be
glad he's alive; swell up until he'll pop a button off his
waistcoat.' "</p>

<p>Gladys kept on standing there, after I paused, so I thought I
might as well finish her off.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;that's all right, Gladys. I know how necessary it
is to keep things neat and clean, and not be bothered by
strangers that we don't know. After all, it's none of our
business whether this old man's lonely or not. He has got some
folks here in town. They can look after him."</p>

<p>I pushed back my chair and left the room, but was in no great
rush to leave the house. I knew that Gladys needed a little time
to digest the dose I had given her. Sometimes I have wished I
could administer an idea hypodermically. She was waiting at the
foot of the stairs, when I came down.</p>

<p>"You can bring him," she said. "I'll treat him decent."</p>

<p>"Thanks," I said. "I rather thought you might, when you had
considered it a little more." Then I added, confidentially,
"Now&mdash;you can either let this be a tiresome burden to you,
or you can have a grand day. Don't try to pity this old fellow.
He has probably had too much of that now. You just pretend to let
him teach you how to make baked beans&mdash;and it will be the
best day's work you've ever done&mdash;and the happiest, too,
I'll bet."</p>

<p>Gladys said she'd try, and grinned a little over our
conspiracy. I reflected, on the way to the hospital, that Gladys
would have a chance to build herself up a little, too&mdash;an
interesting by-product of my adventure.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">I had told the nurse to send Mr. Weatherby over
in a taxi next morning, and he arrived at eight. Gladys had been
instructed to soak the beans in cold water overnight. She was
waiting for my patient when he came, and seemed pleased when he
consented to have a cup of coffee with me in the breakfast room.
Now that she had gone into this thing, she was going to do it
right: I could see that.</p>

<p>"You'll probably have some time on your hands, Mr. Weatherby,"
I said, "and you are quite welcome to sit in my library and smoke
your pipe and read anything that attracts you."</p>

<p>He nodded, dignifiedly, and thanked me. Before I left the
house I found an illustrated copy of Wallace Nutting's <i>Maine
Beautiful</i>, and laid it in a conspicuous place beside the
tobacco jar.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">They were, as Mr. Weatherby had declared, great
beans. I had not suggested that he remain for dinner. It had been
a long, exciting day for him, and I didn't care to risk an
anticlimax. I had him sent back to the hospital where, I learned
later, he had eaten a good dinner and tumbled off to sleep
without grousing about anything.</p>

<p>But Weatherby's melancholia had cut in pretty deep, and I knew
he would skid back into the same old mudhole if we didn't stay
with him until he was safe on firm ground. Many worried people
tinker with the idea of suicide, as a possible escape from their
frets, and come through that phase of depression without serious
harm; but if a man ever gets to the point where he actually tries
it, you want to look out!</p>

<p>One pleasant day of bright endeavour wouldn't be enough to
insure old Weatherby's life. I told him I should be greatly
obliged if he would come again to my house, on Saturday, and bake
a big pot of beans for a party I was giving to a few friends. I
hoped the anticipation of this engagement would entertain him in
the meantime.</p>

<p>Gladys had made no complaint about turning her kitchen over to
the old gentleman, and I believed I could safely risk a
repetition of my request. So, at dinner that night I gingerly
ventured upon the subject, after informing her that nobody but
herself knew how to cook creamed sweetbreads.</p>

<p>"I hope I am not imposing on you, Gladys," I said, "but I
should consider it a great favour if you would consent to have
Mr. Weatherby come on Saturday and bake another pot of beans. I
think this will be the last time."</p>

<p>"Sure!" said Gladys, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Was he very much in your way?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I liked having him here. He told me all about
cutting down trees, and what they did in the mill."</p>

<p>"That must have been interesting."</p>

<p>"Not at first, it wasn't," said Gladys. "But I listened, like
you said, and made believe I was interested, and pretty soon
was.</p>

<p>"That's what makes people interesting, Gladys," I said. "You
let them see that you're interested&mdash;and presently they
begin to be interesting. Nobody can be very interesting," I
added, "if he thinks the other fellow is bored by what he
says."</p>

<p>"It's funny, that way," agreed Gladys. "I had a real good time
with Mr. Weatherby. And I think it did him a lot of good to
talk."</p>

<p>"You'll probably be wanting to try that on someone else, I
suppose, now that you see how nicely it works."</p>

<p>"Well," admitted Gladys, confidentially, "it was like you
said. I had a good time. And it made me feel good&mdash;like I'd
done something for somebody."</p>

<p>"Gladys," I said, "you haven't told anyone about
this&mdash;but me?"</p>

<p>"And Mert," she added.</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;Mert. Now&mdash;don't tell anyone else. You
have done a fine thing. You have helped that old
man&mdash;perhaps more than you realize. And it has made you
happy. Keep it a secret. Because&mdash;if you tell your friends
what you did for Mr. Weatherby, and how pleased he was, and how
pleased you are&mdash;you'll lose it."</p>

<p>"That's funny," said Gladys, doubtfully. "You mean&mdash;if I
tell about it I won't feel good about it, any more?"</p>

<p>"That's what I mean, Gladys," I replied, soberly. "And it is
funny. But it's so. And the next time you do something for
someone, and are very happy about it, don't tell anybody! Not
even Mert; nor me."</p>

<p>Gladys's eyes were wide with mystification. She slowly moved
toward the swinging door leading to the pantry, and went through.
Then she returned. Her eyes were now alight with discovery.</p>

<p>"That's what <i>you</i> do!" she said. "I know now&mdash;about
a lot o' things I've wondered at! For instance&mdash;"</p>

<p>I put up a hand, and shook my head.</p>

<p>"No, no, Gladys&mdash;if you please," I said, firmly. "You
keep your nice secrets&mdash;and I'll keep mine. Then we'll both
be glad."</p>

<p>The Weatherby beans were getting to be very important.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">The next experimental pot of beans was ready for
me at six o'clock on Saturday. I sent Mr. Weatherby back to his
son's home, that night, to spend Sunday. I had kept in contact
with his son, advising him to make the old man talk about his
youthful experiences, and send him back to Brightwood on
Monday.</p>

<p>I had Gladys wrap up the pot of beans in a small blanket and
we put it in a big wooden bucket. I had asked Pyle to join me at
The Pontchartrain for dinner, and went down a bit early with my
strange luggage.</p>

<p>It is barely possible that you may remember Louis, the famed
<i>matre d'htel</i> at The Pontchartrain. Louis is beyond all
question the best cook in town, a product of the Cordon Bleu,
insufferably snobbish, and quite forthright with his cold
contempt of patrons who think of food as something to sustain
life. I have known Louis for a long time and he has done me the
honour of his friendship.</p>

<p>He was standing stiffly at the door, in his evening dress,
when I appeared at the Gold Room, carrying my bucket. I drew him
aside and guardedly muttered into his ear.</p>

<p>"I have a hot pot of Weatherby baked beans in this bucket,
Louis," I confided. "Perhaps you know about them; made according
to an old Maine logging-camp formula; Weatherby's. I got wind
that the old man was in town visiting his son; happened to do a
little favour for him, and he paid me off by baking these beans.
I want them for dinner. Doctor Pyle will join me here
presently."</p>

<p>"Oui," said Louis, bowing. He signed to one of the bus boys
and the beans made off toward the kitchen.</p>

<p>"And Louis," I continued, "if you have a minute, taste those
beans. You know, it occurred to me, to-day&mdash;this grand old
fellow is retired now, and hasn't much to do&mdash;if you could
say, on your luncheon menu, about twice a week maybe, and on
Saturday nights, that you were serving the famous Weatherby
beans, made by Weatherby himself, in your kitchen, after an old
formula concocted in the logging-camps of Maine, where maple
syrup was easier to get than sorghum&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Merci," said Louis, bowing. I could see that the thing had
bit him.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Monday afternoon I drove Mr. Weatherby down to
The Pontchartrain for an interview with Louis, and he held forth
there on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays&mdash;as
beanster-extraordinary&mdash;until the warm weather came along.
Then he went back to Maine and opened up a little roadside place
where he served nothing but Weatherby's Baked Beans&mdash;with
brown bread and other suitable accessories. I had insisted that
he stick to the bean <i>motif</i>; and, seeing that the beans had
saved his life, he seemed glad enough to do so.</p>

<p>"And print on your menu," I advised, "that you may be found,
during the winter season, baking beans at The Pontchartrain. That
ought to fetch 'em."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">He is spending the roughest part of the winter
in his son's home where, he told me to-day, he is entirely
contented. The novelty of Weatherby's beans has worn off, at The
Pontchartrain, and the old gentleman is not working there now;
but he is glad enough for a little rest, he says.</p>

<p>"Had a mighty busy summer," he reported. "I am fixing up the
place a little, this season, and taking on a couple more girls to
help. Ain't as spry as I used to be."</p>

<p>And that, I noticed by his gait, is true. He ain't as spry as
he used to be; but, at least he hasn't killed himself, and I
don't believe he is going to. He inquired, warmly, about Gladys,
and said he had had a Christmas card from her. His beans did more
for Gladys than he realized. Her little investment in Weatherby
has given her something new to think about.</p>

<p>The old man told me to-day that I had saved his life. He was
not effusive, however, and made the statement calmly. I assured
him I had been abundantly rewarded by his friendship.</p>

<p>Perhaps you may think that this narrative is too trivial to be
worth recording, but I want you to know that I put a great deal
more into old Weatherby's salvation than appears on the surface.
To justify Louis's experiment, I talked Weatherby's Baked Beans
to all my friends until they thought I was losing my mind.</p>

<p>Several times that winter, when I had occasion to get a few
men together for a business luncheon, we met at The Pontchartrain
and I insisted on their having beans. Tim Watson was in on a
number of these affairs. One day he said to me, "I'm so damn
tired of Weatherby's beans that if the old fellow doesn't commit
suicide pretty soon I think I will."</p>

<p>It is two o'clock, and I am going to bed. I wish my girl had
come home. I do not like these late parties. It will be a great
comfort when I can put Joyce into Helen's keeping.</p> <hr>

<h2>BRIGHTWOOD HOSPITAL<br> <i>August sixth, 1921, 11
a.m.</i></h2>

<p class="first">DOUBTLESS it has often occurred to you, while
deciphering this journal, that the book was not only a private
repository for certain experiences and impressions which I did
not care to share with any of my contemporaries, but was in the
nature of a little sanctuary where I might solace my
loneliness.</p>

<p>For many years, this journal has served as my most
confidential friend, and many a long evening has been made
endurable by the somewhat laborious game of burying these
observations in the code.</p>

<p>You will not think it strange, therefore, that since my
marriage I have had no inclination to resume this eccentric
pastime. Helen's sweet companionship has completely filled my
life. I have had no temptation to slip away by myself, in the
late evening, to document the events of the day; though there
have been plenty of occasions when the events were even more
worthy of record here than some of the items you have read.</p>

<p>I have not given this journal a thought for a long time. And I
might not be writing these words, to-day, but for the fact that I
want you to have access to a few of the thoughts expressed
yesterday in Chicago at the funeral of my valued friend, Doctor
Clark Russell.</p>

<p>Before I attempt to recover these significant words, let me
sketch briefly the present state of my various interests. I
pursue much the same program of work as formerly, except that I
have been assigning to Watson most of the post-operative care.
The personnel at Brightwood is practically unchanged. Doctor
Minton is not here. The Ruggles twins are taking care of my place
in the country. Pyle is on a vacation cruise in the South
Seas.</p>

<p>Helen has gone to Philadelphia, suddenly summoned by a not
very explicit telegram from her cousin Monty who appears to have
got himself into some scrape which he prefers to discuss with her
in person. She did not want to go, but she would have fretted
about it; so I told her she had better set her mind at ease. She
left on Thursday night, and will not be back until Monday or
Tuesday.</p>

<p>As it turns out, my advice was not very good, and Helen will
probably be sorry she went; for Joyce, who had decided to decline
an invitation to spend the week-end at Windymere, impetuously
changed her mind, and is out there now. Young Merrick has just
arrived home from France and is having a party. I tried to
persuade Joyce not to go. Perhaps it will turn out all right, but
I dislike the prospect of Joyce's getting interested again in the
fast set that Bobby Merrick gathers about him.</p>

<p>I fear that, little by little, Joyce is exerting her
independence of Helen's quiet and affectionate supervision.
Perhaps we should all have foreseen that Helen, in the role of
stepmother, could hardly retain the influence she had as a
comradely schoolmate.</p>

<p>I am lonesome and restless to-day. In a few minutes I am going
to drive out to Flintridge and spend the week-end. It is very
peaceful out there.</p>

<p>Russell's death was very sudden. I had seen him, only a couple
of weeks ago, and he was in his usual health. It is hard to think
of him gone.</p>

<p>Dean Harcourt conducted the funeral service in Trinity
Cathedral. I think it was the most impressive affair I ever
attended.</p>

<p>Of course my emotions were easily accessible, for the loss of
Clark Russell is a serious grief to me. Moreover, I have a great
admiration for Harcourt, and whatever he says carries much
weight.</p>

<p>There is something about the Cathedral, too, that inspires me.
I have had several uplifting experiences there. In my regard, it
is indeed a holy place.</p>

<p>It was very quiet, when we took our seats. It was after four
o'clock, and the declining sun was flooding the rose window in
the apse. The candles on the altar glowed.</p>

<p>The Dean was led into the chancel by his curates. He sat down
in a tall Gothic chair, his face impassive, serene, saintly. I
think Harcourt has suffered much pain. He has probably paid a
pretty high price for his nobility of soul.</p>

<p>The casket stood at the head of the broad, stone-flagged,
central aisle, covered with a pall. There were no flowers on it.
People who come to the Cathedral for the last time are not
expected to bring their floral displays along. You needn't fret
because your cheap little bouquet won't make much of a showing.
Trinity Cathedral, like God, is no respecter of persons.</p>

<p>The organ played "Lead, Kindly Light."</p>

<p>Dean Harcourt read the ritual.</p>

<p>I understand that it is not customary for any additional
remarks to be made in an Episcopal Church on such occasions. But,
when the Dean had concluded the formal reading of the funeral
service, he talked quietly, for a few minutes, about the eternal
life.</p>

<p>This was&mdash;as I have said&mdash;the most impressive thing
I ever heard, and the memory of these simple words is haunting
me. I have not come out from under their spell.</p>

<p>"If we are immortal, at all," said the Dean, "we are immortal
now. If we are to survive, the future life will be a continuation
of our life now. It will be different only in respect to its
larger freedom, and the chief attribute of that freedom will be
our escape from the dread of death and transition.</p>

<p>"We all have our ambitions," said the Dean, "and many of them
lack fulfilment. Our houses burn up, our ships go down, our
bubbles burst. All our ends are uncertain but this. Whatever we
may or may not come to, this is inevitable. It is the shadow that
clouds our sky. Our friend has emerged from that shadow."</p>

<p>The Dean did not specify any of Clark Russell's scientific
contributions to medicine and surgery or his other well-known
philanthropies. Perhaps he knew that every one of the five or six
hundred people present was fully aware of Russell's invaluable
career. But, by implication, he recognized this exceptional
service.</p>

<p>"It is given to some men," he said, "to achieve immortality in
two worlds. They go hence&mdash;but they linger here. This is
very fortunate for them. They have earned a right to live
on&mdash;Here and Elsewhere. We shall not weep for them. They do
not need our tears."</p>

<p>Of course I realize that my written impressions of this
inspiring event cannot convey the full flavour of Dean Harcourt's
quiet words; but, to me, they were august!</p>

<p>I seem still to be in this other-worldly mood. I can't shake
it off. The Dean's sonorous sentences were punctuated by
impressive silences. Two or three times I thought he had
finished, and I was sorry. I hope this doesn't sound like
cant&mdash;but what this man said was nourishment to my soul. I
could feel it building me up! It was majestic! How it would have
stirred Russell!</p>

<p>It seems that at five o'clock, every afternoon, no matter what
is going on in Trinity Cathedral, the chimes in the tower play
the "theme-song" of this great institution&mdash;the tune to the
ancient hymn, "O God Our Help in Ages Past, Our Hope for Years to
Come."</p>

<p>The Dean closed the service while the big bells were booming
this soul-stirring confession of faith. The air was vibrant with
these tones while he recited Browning's imperishable lines,
"So&mdash;if I stoop into a dark, tremendous sea of cloud, it is
but for a time. I press God's lamp close to my breast: its
splendour, soon or late, will pierce the gloom. I
shall&mdash;emerge&mdash;one day!"</p>

<p>And the great bells in the high tower carried on, "Our Shelter
From the Stormy Blast&mdash;and Our Eternal Home."</p>
