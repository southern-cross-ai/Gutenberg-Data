  <h4>TO COLLIER YOUNG&mdash;LEST DISTANCE DIM GOOD FELLOWSHIP</h4>

  <p class="poem">Our hearts know better than to envy men,<br>
  Still less their women, who by tongue and pen<br>
  With soulless ideology declare: "What dies<br>
  Is all we live for. Violence and lies,<br>
  Our high aims justify. The ends we seek<br>
  Are things, more things. The poor and weak,<br>
  Unnourished in the headlong race to pay<br>
  New debts to evil while we toil and pray<br>
  To politics for wealth&mdash;do they not, day by day<br>
  Receive, of our good charity, their bread?<br>
  Are we not wonderful?"<br>
  <br>
  We are. We are. And yet ...<br>
  There was a Voice that more than hinted how<br>
  By means more manly than we practice now<br>
  A wide world's consciousness can lose its dread<br>
  Of drifting toward endless death:&mdash;instead<br>
  New visioned, may create a world at last<br>
  Worth loving for its future, not its past.</p>

  <h2><a name="intro"
     id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="intro">'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.&mdash;Alfred, Lord
  Tennyson: "Ulysses"</p>

  <p class="intro">Set in Tibet, the story concerns a group of men and women
  who are vitally involved in an exciting situation in that forbidden land of
  towering mountain peaks and age-old secrets. The Dalai Lama had died, and the
  choice of a successor to the most influential position in Tibet is a matter
  of utmost concern to the agents of various foreign governments and to Tom
  Grayne, unofficially representing the United States, Andrew Gunning, his
  free-lance friend, and Elsa Burbage, in Tibet under unusual circumstances.
  Above all, the future of Tibet lies in the hands of the Most Reverend Lobsang
  Pun, known as Old Ugly-Face, a wrinkled, stout Tibetan prelate of uncertain
  age, a genuine mystic whose mission in life is to preserve the seeds of
  sanity in a world gone mad. Grayne and Gunning are both in love with Elsa,
  and out of this conflict between life-long friends arises a drama of
  absorbing interest&mdash;a drama intensified by international intrigue,
  treachery, unbelievable courage in the face of the greatest adversity, and
  the prodigious efforts of Old Ugly-Face to win control of the newly appointed
  Dalai Lama.</p>

  <h2><a name="part1"
     id="part1">PART ONE</a></h2>

  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1">CHAPTER 1</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Things seemed vague that evening. Darjeeling felt as if it
  were somewhere over and beyond its own sensational horizon. The damp stone
  monastery walls had lost reality, as if thought were the substance and thing
  its shadow. Andrew Gunning strode along the white-walled passage, beneath
  flickering brass lamps, between pictures of Buddhist saints. The thin, worn
  carpet on the stone flags muted his heavy foot-fall into rhythmic thuds that
  pulsed like heartbeats, regular, and strong, but strangely detached, unreal.
  An outdoor man, sturdily built, he looked as if his passion were as strong as
  his muscles and equally under control. He looked obstinate, cautious, capable
  of proud and perhaps patient but swiftly vigorous anger. As a first
  impression that was accurate enough and no injustice done. But he was not a
  man who readily revealed himself to strangers. He could keep his thoughts to
  himself. Second and later impressions of him always left observers a bit
  puzzled.</p>

  <p>He knocked on the ancient cedar door at the dark end of the passage and
  waited listening, exactly, and in the same mood as he would have listened for
  an animal's cry in the forest, or for the telltale murmur of changing wind in
  the distance. Good ears, well shaped, not too tightly packed against a
  studious-looking head. A thatch of untidy tawny hair, inherited from some
  Viking ancestor who raided Britain before the Normans landed and who
  doubtless found Roman-Northumbrian wenches an agreeable change from the
  shrews of the Baltic night. American born. Unclannish. Habitually slightly
  parted lips. Well-bred narrow nostrils. Easy shoulders; a neck so strong that
  it looked careless. Sensible eyes. A plain man, therefore dangerous. Only
  simple people could predict what Andrew Gunning might do. Complicated people
  seldom understood what he had done or was doing at the moment.</p>

  <p>Because the monastery was built centuries ago, in the days when Darjeeling
  was a fortress city of war-torn Sikkim, the deodar-cedar door was a foot
  thick. He had to knock twice. And because the rain splashed musically through
  an open window, and the monastery mood discouraged shouting, he was answered
  at last by the sound of a small bronze bell. An historic bell. Its temperate
  G would have gone lost in the thunder of camps or the hum of affairs. For
  fifty years, five hundred years ago, it had invited silence while a Wise
  Saint meditated on the mystery of man: whence, whither, why. A most excellent
  bell.</p>

  <p>Andrew opened the door into a plain arrangement of ideas; the comfort of
  ideas in right relation to each other. A white-walled room, so nearly square
  that its size made no impression; it was good to be in, and that was enough.
  Two windows, one facing eternal snow, the Himalayas, the Roof of the World,
  Tibet; but that window was closed for the night by a shutter of cedar and
  curtained with woven wool from somewhere north of Tang La Ra. The other
  window, ten by two and iron-barred against the curiosity of innocence (the
  Tantric Buddhist monks are innocent, and consequently naughty), opened on the
  rain-splashed inner courtyard. There were glimpses through it of wet-bronze
  legged monks about their communal duties, with their skirts tucked into their
  girdles. Some of them were singing; merry-minded fellows, curiously
  indifferent to rain and icy wind, but venially sinfully inquisitive about the
  female occupant of Cell Eleven. They were only preserved from the cardinal
  sin of impudence by the all-seeing eye of Brother Overseer Lan-shi Ling who
  looked down on their labors from the covered gallery, reminding them, when
  necessary, that though the eye and the ear may sin, it is the soul which
  pays. O brothers, look ye neither to the right nor left. The path leads
  upward!</p>

  <p>Elsa lay curled on a Scots plaid steamer rug that had been stained by
  travel. It was spread over big flat cushions stuffed with the swans-down that
  lies like wind-blown blossom on the shore of Lake Manasarowar&mdash;sacred
  wild swans and a sacred lake. The cushions were piled on a throne built of
  blocks of holy basalt from a mountain whose name no Tibetan will utter (lest
  the ever-watchful dugpas* should overhear and find and desecrate the
  mountain's holiness).</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Dugpa</i> (also <i>drugpa</i>, <i>drukpa</i>)
  &mdash;and adherent of the Buddhist religion of Tibet who, previous to the
  reform by Tsong-kha-pa in the 14th century, followed sorcery and other more
  or less Tantric practices, which are entirely foreign to the pure teachings
  of Buddhism. In theosophical literature <i>dugpa</i> has been used as a
  synonym for "Brother of the Shadow." <i><a href=
  "http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/etgloss/dis-dz.htm">Encyclopedic
  Theosophical Glossary</a></i>. In his novel <i>The Devil's Guard</i> Talbot
  Mundy gives the following description: "Dugpas is the name for sorcerers who
  cultivate evil for the sake of evil ... they're vaguely like the Kali-
  worshipers of India." More information on this subject can be gleaned from
  the following passage in Gustav Meyrink's short story <i><a href=
  "http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/meyrink/flederma/grillens.htm">Das
  Grillenspiel</a></i> (The Game of the Crickets):<br>
  <br>
  "Well, one morning I learned from lamaistic pilgrims en route to Lhasa that,
  near my camping ground, there was a most exalted dugpa&mdash;one of those
  devil-priests (recognizable by their scarlet caps) who claim to be direct
  descendants of the Demon of the Fly Agaric (sacred hallucogenic mushroom,
  Translator). At any rate the dugpas are reportedly adherents of the ancient
  Tibetan Bhon religion ... and descendants of a strange race whose origins are
  lost in the obscurity of time. The pilgrims, turning their little prayer
  wheels full of superstitious awe, told me that he was a <i>samcheh
  michebat</i>, that is, a creature which can no longer be called human&mdash;
  a being who can 'bind and release' and for whom, on account of his ability to
  perceive space and time as illusions, nothing in this world is impossible. I
  was told that there are two paths by which one can climb those steps which
  lead beyond the human state: the first is the 'Path of Light'&mdash;of
  becoming one with Buddha; the second&mdash;and opposite&mdash;is the 'Path of
  the Left Hand,' whose entry portal is known only to the born dugpa &mdash;a
  spiritual path replete with dread and horror. Such 'born' dugpas
  &mdash;though rare&mdash;are said to be found in all climes and are,
  strangely, almost always the children of especially pious people. 'It is,'
  said the pilgrim who told me this, 'as if the hand of the Lord of Darkness
  had grafted a poisonous sprig onto the Tree of Holiness. We know of only one
  means to determine if a child belongs spiritually to the fellowship of the
  dugpas&mdash;if the cowlick at the back of his head swirls from left to right
  instead of the other way around.'" Translated by Roy Glashan. ]</p>

  <p>That throne on which Elsa sprawled was really a guest bed reserved for
  visiting Lord Abbots who occasionally come, with secret news, and solemn
  meekness, but implacably critical zeal, to bestow their blessing on the
  monastery or to refuse approval, as the case may be. Hearts had been broken
  in that room, from that throne; personal destinies had crumbled in the calm
  impersonal fire of visiting Lord Abbots' views of what is sinful and what
  isn't. Centuries old though the monastery is, Elsa Burbage was the first
  woman ever to have crossed the threshold of the inner courtyard. She was well
  aware of that. At the moment it was almost the only excuse for
  self-confidence that she could use as a shield against despair. The eleventh
  chamber on the north side had been hers for a number of weeks. It was she who
  had named it Cell Eleven for luck and brevity. Its real name, all one word in
  Tibetan, is Countless-thousands&mdash;of&mdash;times&mdash;blessed
  &mdash;place&mdash;of&mdash;meditation&mdash;piously&mdash;reserved
  &mdash;for&mdash;
  wisdom-loving-holy-lamas-from-blessed-mountains-conferring-sanctity-and-
  merit-by-their-benevolent-presence. That, of course, is a far better name
  than Cell Eleven, but it takes too long to say.</p>

  <p>Elsa smiled at Andrew Gunning, but she didn't speak for a few moments. She
  and he had no need to toss words at each other. Kindness can be as irritating
  as pity. So can courtesy. Such formalities as unfriendly or suspicious people
  have to impose on themselves and each other had gone downwind months ago,
  blown by the bitter winds of Tibet and by the more subtle but even less
  merciful forces of human extremity. There remained a comradeship that speech
  could easily blaspheme but could neither enlarge nor explain.</p>

  <p>Andrew sat down on a stone ledge near the open window. The ledge was
  covered with snow leopard skin, a comfortless upholstery; but Tibetans don't
  care for physical comfort, don't even know what it is; and snow leopard skin
  is a very valuable, so they say, provision against sly earth currents that
  intrude into a meditator's thought and undo virtue, as the termites undo
  buildings in the dark. Andrew leaned his back against the whitewashed wall,
  and he didn't say anything either. He just looked at Elsa, schooling himself
  not to feel sorry for her because he loathed the spiritual snobbery that
  drools that sort of insolence.</p>

  <p>The glow from a charcoal brazier colored Elsa's pale face and made her
  eyes, beneath the dark hair, look much bigger than they actually were; it
  made them gleam with unnatural light that suggested visions and dreams, like
  a cat's eyes when it stares at the hearth. The effect of unreality was
  increased by the leap of candlelight and by the Tibetan paintings on silk
  that loomed amid a mystery of shadows on the white walls. It was Andrew who
  spoke first:</p>

  <p>"Not so long ago, just for looking like that, they'd have burned you for a
  witch."</p>

  <p>"Burning sounds dreadful, but it must be soon over," she answered. "Do you
  suppose it's worse than feeling useless and disillusioned?"</p>

  <p>He scowled suddenly and smiled slowly: "It's the first time I've heard you
  use words like that."</p>

  <p>"I never felt quite like this before. Not quite like it."</p>

  <p>Andrew Cunning's method was to kill out pity and to mask what sympathy he
  felt beneath brusqueness: "Feel like cracking?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It seems to have happened. I want to say what I mean. But I can't. It's
  as if I had been an insect all along without knowing it."</p>

  <p>Andrew looked as cautious, alert and careful as if he were still&mdash;
  hunting some animal of whose ways he was ignorant. He had a presentiment. He
  was going to be asked what he couldn't answer, and told what he didn't want
  to know. So he said what he did know:</p>

  <p>"Life is a fight. The more sensitive you are, the worse it hurts. But you
  can't cure man or horse with hard names. You have to think straight and know
  what you're fighting about."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I did it. I've done it. I lost. I said insect because insects
  wear their skeletons outside and their personalities inside. They're armor-
  plated. But when they crack&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then they grow a new shell or they die."</p>

  <p>"It isn't so easy to just die and be done with it. Andrew, I've reached a
  jumping-off place, but there's nowhere to jump to. I'm not complaining. I'm
  telling you because there's no one else to tell. Even song doesn't sound good
  any more. Tomorrow isn't. There's only a string of dried yesterdays."</p>

  <p>He showed his teeth in a friendly belligerent grin: "So it's Andrew. You
  call me Andy when you think I'm stupid. Drew, when we're talking on even
  terms. Andrew, when you need help. But it won't work. I'm feeling the way you
  do, as near as a man can feel the way a woman does. I was in the chapel just
  now. Same ritual. Same monks, solemnity, beauty and all the rest of it. It
  felt as flat as canned stuff."</p>

  <p>"Then you do understand what I mean."</p>

  <p>"No. When you use a word like insect to explain your feelings&mdash;
  damned if I understand."</p>

  <p>"Drew, your inconsistencies hide something so strong that I'm almost
  afraid of it sometimes. I am now."</p>

  <p>"No call for you to be scared of me. Inconsistencies? What do you
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"You know what I mean. I've heard you use real bad language&mdash; Tibetan
  and English&mdash;that would make a Billingsgate fish-porter's hair
  curl."</p>

  <p>"Maybe. But that was for tactical reasons, to get a pack-train moving or
  something of that sort. And besides, I'm not a woman."</p>

  <p>She laughed. "Drew, did anyone ever accuse you of being effeminate!
  Please, Andrew! What I meant is, that if you'll raise that iron visor of
  yours and really listen, it would be such a comfort. But if that's selfish,
  and you'd rather&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Talk away. I'm interested."</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to the real you."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead. Shoot. But don't talk down to me. I hate that."</p>

  <p>"Down to you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Don't use language aimed at cracking my mental resistance. I'm in a
  sympathetic mood, if that means anything. I'd like to understand. Words like
  insect don't apply. You're not a louse."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you've been so generous to me that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That line heads in nowhere, either. I did what you'd have done if things
  had been the other way around. So let's call that past history and carry
  on."</p>

  <p>"&mdash;so generous, and so unselfish, that I haven't dared, I don't think
  I've even wanted, to impose on you any more. Besides, I understand perfectly
  that just physical things like forced marches and danger, and even
  metaphysical things like ditching your whole year's plans because a friend is
  in trouble&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I didn't have any plans, so I didn't ditch 'em. I was letting Tom Grayne
  do the head work."</p>

  <p>"&mdash;means no more to you than a change of the wind, or a change of
  diet. You actually like it. I know that. I know too&mdash;I understand
  perfectly&mdash;that you enjoyed that dreadful ordeal in the
  blizzard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You and I shared that. What else could I have done than what I did? Don't
  let's talk about it."</p>

  <p>"You did impossible things. You brought me alive out of death. But that
  doesn't give me the right to ask you to do something even more
  difficult."</p>

  <p>He smiled reminiscently. There isn't anything more difficult, in terms of
  ordinary human experience, than to act man-midwife to a girl whose first baby
  is born in a blizzard that blows the tent away at sixteen thousand feet above
  sea level. If he had been a doctor&mdash;but he wasn't. Elsa and child
  survived, and he was secretly so proud of that test of his own
  resourcefulness that he couldn't speak of it. He even disciplined the smile
  into a kind of up-wind stare.</p>

  <p>"Andrew, don't laugh at me, please. I want to talk to the man who pulled
  me through that."</p>

  <p>"You've the right to," he answered. "You came through, colors flying.
  Shoot the works."</p>

  <p>But Elsa found it hard to begin. She was afraid of seeming unwilling to
  face the future. But she did fear the future. And she was afraid to raise
  Andrew Gunning's visor. She had seen him in action, in emergency, in crisis.
  She had seen him tempted, bewildered, baffled, half starved and almost
  overwhelmed by exhaustion; but always, in anger, in defeat, mistaken effort,
  success, nothing less than a man. She knew almost none of his motives, not
  even his real reason for joining Tom Grayne in Tibet. She knew almost none of
  his secrets. She was afraid to guess at them for fear her guess might prove
  true. So she was silent for at least five minutes, afraid of what Andrew
  Gunning might think of her, if she should go on talking. The silence was as
  loaded with thought as the leaping shadows were full of hue from the charcoal
  and flickering candlelight. Elsa made two or three attempts to begin, but
  Andrew gave her no encouragement. The words died on her lips.</p>

  <p>A bell on the monastery roof reminded the monks to do something or other.
  It drew attention to the silence. Gusty wind flickered the candles. Andrew
  got up and put more charcoal on the brazier, resumed his seat on the snow
  leopard skin and waited. It was he who spoke first:</p>

  <p>"Begin, why don't you? What's the trouble?"</p>

  <p>"I told you. You objected to the word insect. My shell is broken. I'm
  afraid. That's the trouble."</p>

  <p>"I'm scared, too," he answered. "Everybody gets scared once in so often.
  But would you trade places with any other girl?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I'd love to! But I don't believe it would be fair to trade
  places."</p>

  <p>Andrew rose to the occasion guardedly: "See here, Elsa; you haven't got to
  live in Brooklyn, or Blackheath, or Chicago, or Tooting Beck. You don't have
  to go to cocktail parties and pink teas, or listen to radio yawp&mdash;or
  argue about dialectics with intellectual asses who think envy is inspiration
  and that Karl Marx is Jesus. You're not leading a second-hand life. You don't
  have to care a damn what mugwumps think. You needn't say yes to the axe-
  grinders. What more do you want? Everybody gets afraid at some time or
  other."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I want to talk about things that one doesn't discuss."</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I knew that. Why don't you begin?"</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you don't mind?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I mind. I hate it. You're going to try to drag out your secret
  thoughts and smear them on the wall for me to look at. You'll come closer to
  doing it than most people could. I suppose it's the end of friendship. You'll
  never forgive me for knowing what you've never told Tom."</p>

  <p>"How do you know I've never told Tom?"</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned. He pulled out his clasp knife and a hunk of hundred-year-
  old cedar from his hip pocket, shifted his position away from the flickering
  candle toward the steady glow of the charcoal brazier and resumed the
  whittling of a head of Chenrezi* where he had left off the day before. Elsa
  watched him with emotions that ranged from baffled anger to despair. They
  were all one emotion, but they felt like wild dogs tearing at her: stark
  torture. However, there was no one but Andrew Gunning who could understand
  what she wanted to tell, what she must tell, even at the risk of
  friendship.</p>

  <p>"Won't you leave off carving that thing, Andrew?"</p>

  <p>"No. You'll find it easier if I look at this instead of you. Besides, it
  helps me to think. Go ahead. Talk." He went on carving, turning the thing in
  his hands to study the planes in the glow from the brazier, puckering his
  eyes, remembering the statue of Chenrezi in the monastery chapel.</p>

  <p>"Drew, I'm a failure. I'm not even a tragic failure. Merely a flop&mdash;
  no dignity:"</p>

  <p>He sharpened the point of his knife on a pocket hone and resumed the
  carving of the Lord Chenrezi's smile.</p>

  <p>"Andrew, please listen. I've come to the end of everything, at twenty-
  three. No more destiny. Nothing. I took my future in my own hands, and
  everything I had, and all I knew and was and could become. And I took all
  chances and&mdash;and&mdash;offered it up."</p>

  <p>"You had a perfect right to," he answered. "Everybody has to do that when
  he's fed up with cant and rant and humbug and gets a glimpse of something
  worth going after. You're no exception."</p>

  <p>"But it didn't work out, Andrew. It was like Cain's sacrifice. It wasn't
  acceptable."</p>

  <p>"Okay. Kill Abel. That's the historic retort. It won't get you far. But
  try it. It's one degree better than killing your own faith."</p>

  <p>"I don't mind about me. And I've no faith left."</p>

  <p>"You mean no humor, don't you? That's just secondhand talk. Have you been
  reading Swinburne again? About weariest rivers winding somewhere safe to sea?
  He was drunk when he wrote it."</p>

  <p>"Oh well. Yes. I do mind&mdash;having let Tom down&mdash;having put you to
  all this inconvenience. I can still feel. Yes. I still have faith in some
  people. But not in me any longer. Instead of being the help I thought I'd be,
  and that Tom thought I'd be, I'm worse than a total loss. I'm a liability.
  Yes, you're right, I do mind about me."</p>

  <p>Andrew glanced at her. She was dry-eyed. No sign of hysteria. She had
  drawn the steamer rug over her knees and was staring at the glowing brazier.
  She didn't even look quite hopeless. She was hoping for a new view, and she
  hoped he had it.</p>

  <p>"I've talked defeat," he said, "plenty of times."</p>

  <p>"You? You, Andrew! To other people?"</p>

  <p>"No. To myself. That's worse. But it never was true. I never really meant
  it. See here, Elsa; merely looking at one angle, you're not a
  run-of-the-mill, college-educated product. You've got ideas."</p>

  <p>"I wish I hadn't. Ideas only give you a headache and make you dangerous to
  other people."</p>

  <p>"You're not stuck in a social rut. You don't feel bound by the latest
  fashion in ideology or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wish I did! I wish I liked that kind of thing! I wish I could make
  myself be herd-minded and believe what other people believe, and do what they
  do, and like it. I wish I were a Fascist or a Communist&mdash;something
  genuinely coarse and gross and stupid! Andrew, with all my heart I wish
  it!"</p>

  <p>"If you feel that way, why consult me?" he retorted, looking obstinate. He
  turned the head of Chenrezi upside down and whittled savagely at the rough
  base. "I think you're well off."</p>

  <p>"You mean in having no future?"</p>

  <p>"Carve your own future." He hacked at Chenrezi.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to. But it will be as lifeless as what you're doing now with
  your knife and a piece of wood:"</p>

  <p>"Piffle! This isn't lifeless. I've a genius for this kind of thing. What's
  more, I do good live thinking while I'm working at it. But my talent can't
  hold a candle to yours. For instance, you're the only woman in the world who
  can translate ancient Tibetan intelligently. What's wrong with that? You've
  plenty of it to do. Here you are, safe as a saint in a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I've counted my blessings and added plenty per cent! Andrew,
  please! Don't talk as if you're trying to sell me a plot in a cemetery! I
  don't have to be told that I might as well be in the British Museum. I've
  been working all day long at translation. I'd go mad if I didn't."</p>

  <p>"Having luck with it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The more wretched I feel, the easier it comes. The only real labor
  is writing it out&mdash;can't write fast enough."</p>

  <p>"You mean it's like automatic writing? I know a man in New York who wrote
  a darned good novel that way."</p>

  <p>"No. It isn't a bit like that. I look at the Tibetan writing and all at
  once it means something in English. I don't know how to explain it. It's like
  reading music notes at sight and being able to transpose them into a
  different key without thinking about it. Of course, it isn't really like
  that, but&mdash;why don't you let me talk of what I want to talk about!"</p>

  <p>Andrew held up Chenrezi's head and studied the curve of a nostril. "It
  doesn't seem to me you have much kick coming," he answered. "There's any
  number of real people who would almost sell their souls for the gift that you
  came by without even having to work for it."</p>

  <p>She laughed. "If you think I didn't work for it, you guess again, Andrew!
  Tibetan wasn't a gift, as you call it. I earned that honestly, and love it.
  It's the other part that I hate. It's a curse. As a child it got me into so
  much trouble that I left home when I was sixteen. I almost didn't have any
  friends. It brought me nothing but grief, and mistrust, and misery, until I
  met Tom in the British Museum Library. After that, it began to be wonderful,
  because Tom&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Tom told me about it."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, let me tell it. You've only heard Tom's version. He told the
  truth, but not all the truth. He can't possibly have told my side of it,
  because he never knew it. I don't believe he even guessed it."</p>

  <p>"Tom's a pretty shrewd guesser. "</p>

  <p>"I know. But how could Tom possibly guess what even I didn't know, about
  me, until&mdash;until I had torn it right out of myself, and forced myself to
  look at it? Tom isn't clairvoyant. Sometimes I think you are. But Tom isn't.
  So he can't possibly have told you all about me."</p>

  <p>Andrew shut his clasp knife. "All right," he said. "You tell it. I'll
  listen. If I don't believe you, I'll say so."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, if you don't believe me, then that will be the end of friendship.
  Because I'm going to be merciless&mdash;I mean to me. It may be the last time
  that you and I will ever talk together intimately. I don't want to pry into
  your secrets. I do want to tell mine."</p>

  <p>Andrew studied his carving of Chenrezi's head for half a minute. Then he
  put it into his pocket and stared at Elsa. The rain splashed in the
  courtyard. The guttering candlelight half hid her amid trembling shadows. A
  slight, small girl of twenty-three, in a black tailored shirt. Dreamy
  intelligent eyes. Something like a feminine version of Michelangelo's
  David.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," said Andrew. "Sling your pebble at Goliath, but try not to hit
  me. If there's anything I hate it's being told what I'd sooner not know. I'm
  a hell of a good hater."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'll hate me. Will you please try not to. I'm going to risk
  it, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you won't let well enough alone, go to it. I won't interrupt."</p>

  <p>But interruption came. It seemed timed to the second, as if someone's
  daimon didn't want a veil drawn aside. It was simple scheduled monastery
  routine, but it felt like a hint from destiny.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2">CHAPTER 2</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The interruption was a thudding on the thick door. It
  sounded far off, almost alarming. But when Elsa touched the bronze bell it
  turned out to be only two wrinkled old Tibetan monks. One was the Abbot's
  physician. The other brought tea in a brass urn&mdash;buttered tea stewed and
  salted, that isn't so awful once you're used to it. The smiling old doctor
  professed not to know why there were three cups. It was not his business. He
  had brought medicine for Elsa. He poured it from a silver vial into a spoon
  of rhinoceros horn, opened his own mouth by way of suggestion, pushed the
  spoon halfway down Elsa's throat and turned it until she gagged and swallowed
  the horrible stuff. He watched her cough, crossing his fingers, murmuring
  sacred words to ward off devils. Then he murmured a blessing, stowed the
  utterly unsanitary spoon into an inner pocket, corked the vial, smiled at
  Andrew Gunning with a shrewd, almost monkey-like glance of his deeply set
  dark eyes and walked out, whirling his prayer wheel, followed by the monk
  with the brass tray. When the door thudded shut Andrew seized the opportunity
  to change the subject:</p>

  <p>"So you're still on the sick list?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm quite well. But Abbot Mu-ni Gam-po insists that I'm still full of
  devils that need driving out. He says it was devils that killed my baby. So
  he sends his doctor three times a day. If I should refuse to swallow that
  nasty stuff, I don't know what would happen."</p>

  <p>"You'd be a fool to refuse. Old Mu-ni Gam-po knows his magic. Some of our
  modern doctors get the same results by a different method. There's not much
  choice between a stupid M.D. and an ignorant magician. Either will kill you.
  And the good magician or the good M.D. will cure you, if your soul wants to
  stay in your body."</p>

  <p>"Souls can be cruel to bodies," she answered. "Mine is cruel. It insists
  on staying in me. Andrew, you pour the tea, will you? I can't reach it
  without getting up."</p>

  <p>He filled two cups, then went and peered through the window bars before
  resuming his seat.</p>

  <p>"No eavesdroppers," he said. "Not at the moment."</p>

  <p>"Did you think there might be?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. There's at least one monk who reports to Bulah Singh. You know what
  that means. C.I.D. Confidential&mdash;indiscreet&mdash;dirty. Bulah Singh
  reads your mail before you get it&mdash;if you get it. However, I hope you've
  changed your mind about talking. It's always better to say nothing."</p>

  <p>"You make it difficult, Andrew. I believe you're hiding something."</p>

  <p>"Well," he answered, "I guess that's true. But it needn't stop you from
  telling me the worst, if you feel you've got to. Go on. You're heartsick and
  scared. You think you can cure it by offering me to the gods, if there are
  any gods."</p>

  <p>"Not you, Andrew. But if I lose your friendship&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Same thing! But go to it. What's all this that Tom Grayne doesn't
  know?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I met Tom for the first time in the British Museum Library. I was
  studying Tibetan because I like it, and so few other people study it, and
  because it's difficult, and because Professor Mayor, who happens to be my
  uncle, is in charge of the Tibetan section. I didn't know then that Professor
  Mayor had anything to do with the secret service. But later he asked me to
  help Tom decipher some difficult letters that were written in a kind of
  shorthand. I have a talent for that kind of thing. It isn't brain work; it's
  a kind of clairvoyance. One thing led to another. Tom found me useful. I
  didn't know then that Tom was in the pay of the American State
  Department."</p>

  <p>"He wasn't," said Andrew. "He never has been, and he isn't. The American
  State Department isn't crazy. It hasn't any money to spend on people like Tom
  and me. On top of that, it wouldn't choose to be caught with the goods. I'm
  unpaid. Tom gets bare expenses and a pittance from a member of the United
  States Senate who likes to know what he's talking about. If Tom's information
  should happen to reach the State Department, that's nobody's business."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, let me tell it, please."</p>

  <p>"Okay. But tell it right. You went off on the wrong foot. You met Tom. You
  and he got married. Then what?"</p>

  <p>"Tom wasn't in love with me."</p>

  <p>"Yes he was."</p>

  <p>"And I wasn't in love with Tom."</p>

  <p>"Yes you were."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you're observant and kind and sometimes wonderfully intuitive,
  but this is something that you haven't understood. Onlookers never do
  understand that kind of thing. You weren't even an onlooker, not in the
  beginning. You had never even heard of me, and you only knew Tom by hearsay,
  until you met us in Tibet. And by that time, things were different. In the
  beginning Tom was in love with his job and with nothing else in the world. He
  was heartwhole, and ruthless&mdash;scrupulously faithful."</p>

  <p>"Tom has gray iron scruples, but no morals," said Andrew. "Tom's
  sentimental bigot."</p>

  <p>"Tom is the most intensely moral man I ever met."</p>

  <p>"I guess we're at odds about definitions. We may mean the same thing. Go
  ahead."</p>

  <p>"Tom found me useful. I had enough money to pay my own expenses. I'm
  healthy, and active, and I'm so small that I don't tire a horse the way some
  people do. I don't care a bit about luxuries, and I can keep my temper and
  hold my tongue. So Tom offered to take me to India."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Andrew. "I know all about that. There was a homesick Tibetan
  in London named Tho-pa-ga. Tom wanted to take Tho-pa-ga to Tibet, and he
  wanted you along to supply the feminine touch. Tom told me all about it. You
  did such a good job that when the Tibetans kidnapped Tho-pa-ga to make him
  Keeper of the Thunder Dragon Gate, they kidnapped you along with him to keep
  up his spirits. Tom went in pursuit, and the Lama Lobsang Pun saved the lot
  of you in the nick of time. Tho-pa-ga turned out to be a miserable flop, all
  pious melancholy and no backbone. In love with you, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Tho-pa-ga," said Elsa, "was just an overgrown and overeducated moon-calf
  who needed a nurse."</p>

  <p>Andrew nodded. "Tom made a bloomer that time. Tho-pa-ga was a ruinous man
  to bet on. Bound to let you down. In England he was homesick for Tibet. As
  soon as he reached Tibet, he was homesick for England. Tom was a fool to
  waste time on him. Tho-pa-ga's religion was such a mixture of magic and
  sentimentality, all glued into a rotten mess by a kind of superstitious
  fatalism, that he couldn't possibly have been a success in a key position. No
  one respected him. The only friends he made were political Tibetan monks who
  spotted him for an easy mark. So of course he was poisoned. Anybody could
  have foretold that. And the business of preventing Tibet from being saved
  from herself by the Japs and Russians had to begin all over again. That was
  why I was sent from Shanghai to find you and Tom."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, if you really don't want to hear my side of it, why not simply
  refuse to listen, instead of trying to get me to talk about something else?
  Just say so. Just go out and leave me alone. Then there'll be no one left
  except Abbot Mu-ni Gam-po. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You been talking to him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He cast my horoscope, from five or six different aspects."</p>

  <p>"Did he show you the result?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I can't read a horoscope. Looking at it gave me a sensation of
  danger and fear and abject fatalism that I knew I shouldn't have. But Mu-ni
  Gam-po wouldn't explain it, beyond saying something about Uranus and Neptune
  in the twelfth house, with afflicted Venus, and Sun rising in Aries. I don't
  know what that means. He wouldn't let me tell him what I'm trying to tell
  you."</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed dryly: "Mu-ni Gam-po is wiser than I am! Go ahead. Tell me
  about the afflicted Venus. Crucify her!"</p>

  <p>"I've done it, Andrew, but I didn't think it was that at the time. Tom
  married me secretly in England, in a spirit of scrupulous fair play. I was so
  in love with the idea of not being a grub any longer&mdash;of getting away
  from England and all that smug mediocrity, and credulous skepticism, and
  stupid, stuffy pretense of being something that you're not&mdash;I was so
  excited by the thought of traveling in India and being really useful&mdash;
  that I would have done whatever Tom asked me to do. It was his idea, our
  getting married."</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned&mdash;glanced at her.</p>

  <p>"It was Tom's idea! I never dreamed of it until he suggested it. He had a
  double motive."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Tom's ambidextrous. He lets his left hand know what his right hand's
  doing. But lets nobody else know."</p>

  <p>"Tom wanted to protect me, in case anything should happen to him. He also
  wanted me to have the right to open his strongbox in the bank vault. Those
  were his motives."</p>

  <p>"Let's leave that lay. Tom and you got married secretly. And you weren't
  in love with each other. Then what?"</p>

  <p>"I fell in love with Tom. This is the part that isn't easy to tell."</p>

  <p>"Remember! I haven't asked you to tell it."</p>

  <p>"No, Andrew. But I must tell someone. Mu-ni Gam-po won't listen.</p>

  <p>"I guess he knows it without being told. He's wise. The more he knows, the
  less he says. But why not try Nancy Strong at the Mission School? Nancy is a
  hard-bitten old soldier with a heart like Mary Magdalene's and the guts of a
  grenadier. She'd even have a good cry with you, if that's how you feel. Then
  she'd tell you something worse out of her own experience, and you'd have a
  good laugh and feel better."</p>

  <p>"She's a woman, Andrew. No woman could understand. She'd only see my side
  of it; and I can see that too well already. I want you to listen because
  you'll see Tom's side of it."</p>

  <p>"Didn't Tom see his side of it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course he did. But, Andrew, did you ever try to get Tom to complain,
  or to blame anyone else for what happened to him, or to cry over spilt milk,
  or to lock a door after the horse has bolted&mdash;or to do any of those
  wishy-washy things that ordinary people do? Tom is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're right there. Tom isn't ordinary. He's ornery, if you know what
  that means. Nancy Strong should have married him."</p>

  <p>That changed Elsa's mood for a moment. She couldn't help laughing. Nancy
  Strong was old enough to be Tom Grayne's mother. Not even Tom Grayne would
  have a chance against her in a tussle of wills. Even Government fears
  Nancy.</p>

  <p>"It will come easier now you're laughing," said Andrew. "Tell the funny
  part first. Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"It's no joke, Andrew. It's all disillusionment and anticlimax. Even being
  kidnapped and carried off, and being cold and hungry in the mountains and in
  danger of being killed&mdash;and not knowing what had happened to Tom, but
  just hoping he would turn up&mdash;and then seeing him suddenly&mdash;and all
  the fighting at the Thunder Dragon Gate&mdash;every least tiny bit of it was
  wonderful and clean and good. It was life. It felt like being blown on a big
  wind, and something new every minute. After Tom had helped Lobsang Pun to
  seize control of the monastery, it was even fun when that old despot turned
  us out to go and shift for ourselves. Lobsang Pun washed his hands of us. And
  Tom took the trail of the Japanese secret agents, taking me with him because
  there was nothing else he could do about it. Those were hard times, but they
  were utterly wonderful. We crossed the border of Sinkiang; and we were in
  touch with the exiled Tashi Lama twice before they poisoned him."</p>

  <p>"They'll poison Tom one of these days," said Andrew. "He'll find out just
  one thing too many. Then he'll begin to wonder what disagreed with him."</p>

  <p>"I did all the cooking," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"That's nothing. They poison the meat before it's killed. If you don't eat
  meat, they poison the salt and tea and sugar. They put poison in the dust
  that blows into your cup. Tibetans are real nice people, but they don't like
  you to know more than's good for their peace of mind. That's what Tibetans
  are after&mdash;peace of mind."</p>

  <p>"I wish I had some! Andrew, listen to me. I betrayed Tom. Not he me. I
  betrayed him."</p>

  <p>"Tell it if you must. But don't say I asked for it. I'll believe it or
  not, as I see fit."</p>

  <p>"Ours was an absolutely hard and fast agreement. We hadn't pretended to be
  in love with each other. I was to be Tom's assistant, and to obey orders. Tom
  made the stipulation, and I agreed to it instantly, that there was to be no
  love-making and no man and wife stuff. Ours was simply a temporary
  arrangement for business purposes. Either of us was to be free to divorce the
  other as soon as there was no longer any reason for being married."</p>

  <p>Andrew put all the malice he could into a slowly broadening grin. "I've
  heard of lots of folks," he said, "who believed they were stronger than sex.
  I've even fallen for that presumption once or twice myself. You're not the
  first&mdash;not by a long way. It's disillusioning, but human. I've never
  spoken to Tom about women. And of course everybody knows he's an iron-willed
  man. But I'd have betted all I've got. I'd have laid odds."</p>

  <p>"Laid what odds?"</p>

  <p>"Tom Grayne and you&mdash;or any other eligible woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by eligible woman?"</p>

  <p>"I mean any woman worth going overboard for. Tom and she, alone together,
  week after week, month after month, sharing the same tough time, growing more
  and more into each other's confidence&mdash;hell, I don't care what the
  previous agreement might be. She'd fall for Tom. She'd have to."</p>

  <p>"Well, Andrew, you're wrong. Tom fell for me. I did it&mdash;five nights
  after we camped in that cave where you found us."</p>

  <p>"That means a couple of months before I got there."</p>

  <p>"Yes. You stopped it."</p>

  <p>"Me? What had I to do with it? It was none of my business."</p>

  <p>"No. But your arrival brought Tom to his senses. And me, too. Me
  especially. What I want you to understand is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sure, you've said that. I'm not mentally deaf."</p>

  <p>"Before you came, Tom was depressed by a sense of failure. Everything
  seemed to have gone wrong. Our Tibetans were behaving badly. Some deserted.
  Others brought in false reports and were getting insolent. Tom and I weren't
  hitting it off the way we had done, because my clairvoyance wasn't as clear
  as usual. It was all about Europe instead of Tibet. What I did see about
  Tibet, Tom didn't believe. When spies came in and talked to him I couldn't
  get any clear picture of what they were thinking about. That made Tom
  irritable. It seemed to me we were drifting apart, and that Tom was sorry he
  had brought me with him. I made up my mind to change that by putting things
  on a more human basis."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing new about that," Andrew remarked. "That's old stuff.
  Everybody does it."</p>

  <p>"Does what?"</p>

  <p>"Camouflages natural behavior under a lot of phony excuses."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, please don't try to tell me I couldn't have helped it. I know
  better. I don't want to be pitied. I want advice. I knew what Tom needed, or
  I thought I did. He was lonely and worried and more nearly afraid than I've
  ever seen him. So that night, after the Tibetans had gone into the other
  cave, I crept into Tom's bed and made him believe it was I who needed him. I
  seduced him."</p>

  <p>"And is that what Tom doesn't know?"</p>

  <p>"Of course Tom doesn't know it. He thinks I was just a weak woman who
  yielded to his natural physical yearning for a mate. At times like that
  things happen. It's super-physical and super-mental. The physical act is
  irresistible. But it never entered Tom's head that it wasn't his fault."</p>

  <p>"And of course it never entered your head," said Andrew, "that every time
  a Tibetan woman has made overtures to Tom he has compared her with you and
  sent a mental SOS in your direction that you responded to without knowing
  it."</p>

  <p>"I did know it. My eyes were wide open. I knew Tom would lose his job if
  he were ever suspected of woman weakness. He's like a priest in that respect.
  He's trusted because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh boloney!" Andrew interrupted. "That's just Tom's alibi. He kids
  himself. He made that up. He's scrupulous and sentimental about his job. The
  job comes first. It suits him to believe that getting tangled with a woman
  &mdash;any woman&mdash;would destroy his efficiency. So he invented that
  hokum about Spartan celibacy. He has read a lot of tripe, too, about
  sublimation of sex."</p>

  <p>"'Why do you say tripe? Andrew, there are hundreds of thousands of people
  who have no sex life, and don't want it, and are better off without it
  &mdash;priests, monks, nuns&mdash;there was Newton, who invented calculus
  &mdash;and my uncle, Professor Mayor&mdash;and the Lama Lobsang Pun
  &mdash;and there's Mu-ni Gam-po and all the monks in this monastery&mdash;
  and all the saints since history began&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tom Grayne is no saint," said Andrew. "He's strong. He has energy and an
  iron will. He's on the level in the sense that he would stay bought if anyone
  could buy him, but nobody can. That's a number one rating. But he's no
  genuine ascetic. He trains himself to live hard and to abstain from tobacco
  and drink and women for the same reason that a professional athlete does. It
  pays dividends&mdash;not cash, but something he likes far better. That isn't
  asceticism. If Tom thought that the opposite of chastity would improve his
  intelligence he'd turn whore-master, scrupulously, without the slightest
  moral twinge. He might hate it. But he'd do it."</p>

  <p>"Don't you believe I corrupted him?"</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed. His eyes narrowed. His grin widened. He clasped his hands
  and laid his elbows on his thighs and looked at Elsa with amusement that hid
  neither from him nor from her the fact that anger lay near the surface now,
  banked up, growing strong under restraint. Suddenly it broke loose. He stood
  up.</p>

  <p>"Elsa, don't be a damned fool. You corrupted Tom about as much as
  champagne could corrupt carbolic acid. The way a bird corrupts quicklime
  &mdash;or a rose corrupts the northeast wind."</p>

  <p>"You're talking as if Tom were your enemy. Don't you like him?"</p>

  <p>"You bet I like him. But he doesn't fool me. Neither do you."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to fool you. I betrayed Tom."</p>

  <p>"Now you've said it, are you going to cover up? Or will you answer
  questions?"</p>

  <p>"I want to tell you the truth, Andrew, so that you will answer my
  questions."</p>

  <p>"Okay. Answer this one first. Did Tom ever say he loved you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But don't you know the difference between loving and being in
  love?"</p>

  <p>Andrew sat down again. "When did it happen? I mean, when did Tom say
  it?"</p>

  <p>"It happened&mdash;I mean Tom said it at the Thunder Dragon Gate, before
  Lobsang Pun sent us away."</p>

  <p>"And what did you say?"</p>

  <p>"I don't remember what I said. I was utterly happy. I didn't care where we
  went nor what we did&mdash;until I suddenly remembered the bargain. I knew
  Tom would remember it too. So I spoke of it first, because I didn't want to
  embarrass him by speaking of it when it might be almost too late."</p>

  <p>"What did Tom say?"</p>

  <p>"He was relieved. I knew he would be. And he was."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I don't doubt it. All Tibet to wander around in. No immediate
  impulse, and plenty of time. About three quarters of Tom's method is to start
  things moving and then wait and see."</p>

  <p>"Please, Andrew! It's so difficult to tell, and I do so want you to
  believe me."</p>

  <p>"I know what you want me to believe."</p>

  <p>Andrew enjoyed the luxury at last of letting violence flow up the veins of
  his neck and along his forearms. There was just a hint of hardening muscle
  beneath the candle shadow on his cheek. Unknown to himself he looked ready to
  kill what he hated. Elsa noticed it.</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you hate me for being the problem I am, and I don't blame you one
  bit. But be generous. Try to understand me. And then give me good advice,
  don't Pollyanna me. I want you to help me to face the music."</p>

  <p>"What are you trying to be? A she-dictator staging an election? I vote the
  way I'm told to, and eat crow if you're wrong? Is that it?"</p>

  <p>"No, Andrew. But the facts are plain and I want you to know them before
  you give me advice. I seduced Tom. I swore I wouldn't, but I did. As a result
  I became pregnant, in a cave, in Tibet, nearly a thousand miles away from any
  possible help. No woman has a right to do that to a man. If you hadn't turned
  up, Tom would have been in a much worse dilemma than he is in now. And it's
  bad enough now. Perhaps I ought to have just let myself die. I could have
  done that, because I was very close to death several times. It would have
  saved trouble for everybody."</p>

  <p>"Stay in your own bracket and don't try to talk like a beaten drab," said
  Andrew. "You can't play coward well enough to convince yourself, let alone
  me."</p>

  <p>"It isn't easy to play coward&mdash;one can only think about it, with
  people like Tom and you doing things," she retorted. "Who else in the world
  but you would have said yes without a second's hesitation when Tom asked you
  to take me to Darjeeling&mdash;nearly a thousand miles, and winter coming
  on&mdash;and not your business!"</p>

  <p>"Any man would have done it."</p>

  <p>"You think too highly of men! The point is that you did it, Andrew. And my
  baby was born in the snow. And you fought the blizzard and death and made
  miracles and stood by like a great big angry angel, and did what couldn't be
  done, and saved the baby and me, and brought both of us alive to Darjeeling.
  It wasn't your fault that the baby died&mdash;here, in the monastery."</p>

  <p>"Nor your fault either. That was bad luck."</p>

  <p>"It was Tom's baby."</p>

  <p>"Seems to me it was your baby."</p>

  <p>"It was Tom's one possible excuse to forgive me for what I'd done to him.
  And the baby is dead. Now what? Tell me, Andrew. What now?"</p>

  <p>"You're overrating Tom's cussedness," he answered. "Tom isn't as hard as
  all that."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, if the baby had lived there would have been no mystery about what
  to do. Tom's baby and mine. Quite simple. I'd have been the mother of Tom's
  baby. But now what am I? Nothing but a liability&mdash;a millstone fastened
  secretly to Tom's neck&mdash;a danger to him. A handicap&mdash;a nuisance
  &mdash;an expense&mdash;an obstacle."</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned savagely. "Who filled the butchers' shops with big green
  flies?"' he quoted. "Sure. You haven't any rights whatever."</p>

  <p>"Listen, Andrew, please. I know what my legal rights are. I can go to
  Mexico or somewhere like that and divorce Tom, just as secretly as we got
  married. That was part of our agreement. But I want you to tell me Tom's side
  of it. Tom is all alone in Tibet and I can't consult him. I can't even get a
  message to him. I've tried telepathy again and again. Sometimes I can see him
  clairvoyantly. But I get no response. Tom isn't clairvoyant&mdash;at any
  rate, not consciously he isn't."</p>

  <p>"Tom has Grade A hunches," said Andrew. "What does he think those
  are?"</p>

  <p>"There you go again, trying to get me off the subject! It isn't Tom's
  hunches that trouble me. It's Tom's sense of duty. Tom feels he has a duty to
  me. I know he does. Andrew, put yourself in Tom's place, and then tell
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Can't be done. Besides, I wouldn't be in Tom's place for a million."</p>

  <p>"What shall I do, that won't make Tom feel cheap or guilty, and that won't
  make him feel he should throw up his job and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped speaking suddenly. Andrew was on his feet again. Anger burst
  through reticence. His face, in the glow from the brazier, was almost exactly
  as she remembered it in the blizzard-blown campfire light when the tent was
  torn loose in the gale and her baby was being born.</p>

  <p>"God damn it!" he said suddenly. "Can't you fight back!"</p>

  <p>"You mean fight Tom?"</p>

  <p>"I mean fight that God-damned lousy theoretical suggestion stuff that
  makes you blame yourself for every situation that you don't like! The sun
  rises&mdash;praise the Lord!&mdash;God's in his heaven and all's well with
  the world. But when night comes&mdash;that's your fault! Bad weather
  &mdash;that's absolute, infallible, incontrovertible proof that you're a
  sinner! Damn that superstition about sin in the Garden of Eden!"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I'm not superstitious! I'm not! I am not!"</p>

  <p>"Aren't you?'And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast
  done this: upon thy belly shall thou go, and dust shall thou eat all the days
  of thy life.' Do you believe that or don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I asked you to tell me what Tom really thinks."</p>

  <p>"How the hell do I know what he thinks! Damn his eyes, I'm telling you
  what I think! You and he are not theories, or any bilge like that. You're not
  a legend. You're human beings. If you love each other&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I can't come between Tom and his duty."</p>

  <p>"Duty my eye! Don't you rate? Haven't you a soul to call your own? Is it
  less than his? Haven't you faith in your own vision? It was good enough,
  wasn't it, to pull up stakes and cash your savings and pitch your future into
  Tom's kit and go wandering where nine hard-gutted hellions out of ten
  wouldn't dream of daring to go! And now you talk about being licked by a
  lousy suggestion that you're a traitress! God! Sure. Yes. I'll tell you the
  answer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused because Elsa was no longer looking at him. Her attention had
  become fixed on something else. A quiet cough made him turn suddenly. The old
  Abbot Mu-ni Gam-po had entered unheard. He stood in shadow, black-robed,
  frail-looking, blinking through a parchment maze of wrinkles that were
  probably a smile, probably kindly, but beyond any doubt whatever were a mask
  revealing nothing that he did not wish to reveal. He spoke in English:</p>

  <p>"May I listen to the wonderful answer? But may I first have tea, if there
  is any tea left in the urn? Let us all drink. Anger and tea so seldom mingle.
  Wisdom sometimes fills the nest from which the bird of anger flew."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3">CHAPTER 3</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Andrew recovered reticence, and alertness with it. The
  arresting fact was that the Lord Abbot Mu-ni Gam-po had entered the room,
  contrary to custom, unannounced, unaccompanied. Andrew concentrated full
  attention on the fact. He watched the Abbot help himself to tea and drink it
  noisily, Tibetan fashion. The old man wasn't likely to say what he meant; one
  had to spot hints, and they wouldn't be too plain. Elsa watched Andrew,
  wondering whether he got the same impression she did. There was emergency in
  the air. The swaying shadows felt loaded with secret crisis. It was like a
  dream, in which unrelated things happen. A gong boomed at the far end of the
  corridor, muted by silence and by the thick door and the splashing of rain
  through the open window. Mu-ni Gam-po moved his prayer wheel with a hardly
  perceptible wrist motion, twirling perhaps a hundred benedictions. Then he
  blinked at Andrew and spoke in Tibetan:</p>

  <p>"Angry answer being now arrested on the lips of emotion, opportunity to
  gather knowledge before leaping blindly may be indicated."</p>

  <p>"We were talking about duty and sin," said Andrew. He felt he had to say
  something.</p>

  <p>"There is danger in another's duty&mdash;also duty in another's danger,"
  the Abbot remarked. "Sin is the result of conceit; it has no other basis. To
  discuss it is to argue about nothing, with vain words, in a void created by
  imagination."</p>

  <p>The Lord Abbot sat down on the seat that Andrew had vacated. He motioned
  to Andrew to take the teak chair on the far side of the brazier between
  himself and Elsa. The old man looked almost Chinese, roguish and yet
  unworldly; humorous but serious nevertheless; humble, gentle, and yet full of
  dignity. After a minute's silence he spoke again in Tibetan, in a voice
  creaky with age but curiously vibrant with the unselfconscious habit of
  authority.</p>

  <p>"Self-revelation, self-expression, seldom is attainable by such beginners
  as ourselves. It is invariably wise through meditation to permit reflection
  to reveal reality. We thus perceive ourselves in one another. Wisdom lives in
  silence."</p>

  <p>Fact number two had presented itself. The Very Reverend Lord Abbot Mu-ni
  Gam-po was suggesting in his own elaborate way that a time for not talking
  too much was at hand and that the reasons within reasons for discretion would
  reveal themselves, if one only would have patience. And even patience was not
  strained too much. The gong boomed again at the far end of the corridor. A
  moment later the thick door opened. A monk moved in, barefooted, silent. He
  stood flicking his beads. The Lord Abbot nodded. The monk opened the door
  wider. Footsteps on carpeted stone came echoing forward. The atmosphere, the
  feel of things changed subtly. The dream sensation vanished. Something more
  like actuality replaced it. Dr. Morgan Lewis walked in and the monk closed
  the door, standing with his back to it. For a moment the flicking of the
  monk's beads was the only sound in the room, very distinctly heard against
  the splashing of rain in the outer night as Dr. Morgan Lewis glanced from one
  face to the other.</p>

  <p>"Kind of you to let me come," he remarked, bowing to Mu-ni Gam-po and then
  to Elsa. Then he strode forward and shook hands with Andrew Gunning,
  carefully because a finger joint was missing from his right hand. Andrew had
  a reputation for sometimes forgetting his strength. One eyebrow perpetually
  higher than the other gave Lewis a quizzical look that was increased by
  untidy graying red hair, carefully clipped and groomed but always being
  ruffled by his restless fingers. He was a man of fifty with scars on his face
  and a wry, skeptical smile. But of what he was skeptical didn't appear.</p>

  <p>"Well, what's the news?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>No one answered. Mu-ni Gam-po produced horn-rimmed spectacles with large
  lenses which he polished carefully before putting them on.</p>

  <p>"I seem to have interrupted you at prayers," said Lewis. "Let me join in
  &mdash;I've brought the smell of hell with me&mdash;from Delhi. I snaffled a
  week's leave. Just got here&mdash;at least, that's the story. Must I operate
  to start the conversation flowing? How are you, Elsa?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Dr. Lewis, I'm incredibly well."</p>

  <p>Lewis stuck a monocle into his right eye. He was wearing a careless-
  looking tweed suit, but by a strange kind of circumstantial magic the scrap
  of glass in his eye suggested military uniform and official secrets. It made
  him look dapper, smart, almost impudent. He walked toward Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Good girl. Been obeying orders. Sleep. Rest. Plain food. But take a tip
  from me and don't get well too quickly."</p>

  <p>He sat down beside Elsa, on the edge of the basalt throne, where he could
  watch Andrew Gunning beyond the brazier and be watched by Mu-ni Gam-po. His
  right hand drummed a signal on his knee in full view of the horn-rimmed
  spectacles. The Lord Abbot asked in English:</p>

  <p>"Not too quickly? Does my patient need other treatment?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you," said Lewis. "As you know, I happened to be in
  Darjeeling soon after she arrived from Tibet a couple of months ago. I took
  the opportunity at that time to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elsa interrupted. "Doctor, you came all the way from Bombay, by airplane,
  just to make sure I was getting proper treatment. That's true, isn't it?
  Please don't try to make generosity seem like an accident!"</p>

  <p>Lewis glanced at her swiftly, then at Mu-ni Gam-po. He grinned wryly. "I
  admit that the Government paid for the plane. It's less than once in a
  thousand years that a girl of your age suddenly arrives from Tibet and knows
  how to hold her tongue. Besides, you sent for me."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Lewis, I didn't!"</p>

  <p>Lewis adjusted his monocle. He glanced at Mu-ni Gam-po, and at Andrew
  Gunning, then stared at Elsa. "Young lady, we're among friends. Strictly
  between ourselves, I got your telepathic message. It was my first convincing
  evidence of clairvoyance. I said: convincing evidence. Tell the truth now,
  you asked me to come!"</p>

  <p>"But I didn't! You were the only doctor I knew in all India. And I was ill
  and unhappy. They told me my baby was dying. So I remembered you, and thought
  about you, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And I saw and heard you," said Lewis. "Clear case of telepathy&mdash; but
  I'd be drummed from the medical ranks if I dared say so in public. The baby
  was dead before I got here. They'd call that proof that I'm a liar. But we
  pulled you through your trouble.&mdash;Tell me: what impression do you get
  now?"</p>

  <p>Elsa hesitated: "You don't mean things in Europe? Hitler? Mussolini?"</p>

  <p>"God forbid!" said Lewis. "What do you see here&mdash;now?"</p>

  <p>"I've a strong impression that you're warning me of danger."</p>

  <p>"Well, now. That's damned interesting."</p>

  <p>"Did I guess right?"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't guesswork. You saw it. Let's put it this way, talking in words
  of one syllable because I wish to be understood. One man's meat is another's
  poison. Facts are nothing but symbols of a metaphysic that we don't
  understand. Science, medicine included, is a scandalously overrated system
  for misinterpreting ascertained facts. And as a medical man it's my duty to
  say that Mu-ni Gam-po's medicine is an unscientific mixture of herbs that
  aren't in the pharmacopoeia and its use would be illegal in any civilized
  country."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to be rude," Elsa answered, "but Mu-ni Gam-po's medicine
  made me feel well, and yours didn't."</p>

  <p>Lewis laughed. He caught the Lord Abbot's eye, and the Lord Abbot smiled.
  Lewis shook his fist at the Lord Abbot. "Charlatan!" he said. "Quack!
  Heretic! Johnson used to let you dose him, and now where's Johnson? Gone!
  Gone home to England, where he'll die, one of these days, just as surely as
  my name's Morgan Lewis."</p>

  <p>Andrew Gunning almost upset the brazier. "Johnson? Of the Ethnographic
  Survey? Gone? You mean he's left India?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Lewis. "Irish promotion. Sent home in a hurry to advise the
  India Office and be made a baronet and be snubbed to death. I'll send flowers
  &mdash;perhaps cabbages. I didn't like him, but he was a very first-class
  man."</p>

  <p>Andrew looked worried. "Who has taken Johnson's place?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"For the time being," said Lewis, "there's an abhorrent vacuum in process
  of being naturally filled with rumors. Bulah Singh is playing locum tenens,
  acting-Satan so to speak, but not as likely as he thinks he is to inherit the
  throne of hell. He lacks the incorruptible integrity. Bulah Singh might try
  to snatch some credit for himself by getting after unorthodox practitioners
  of medicine. You see, if Bulah Singh could tamper with Mu-ni Gam-po's
  medicine and create a scandal, he might sell his own brand of brimstone and
  treacle. I advise you to change doctors, young woman. Do you get what I
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"No." Elsa stared at him, worried. "You're talking nonsense just to test
  my ability to read thought. But it doesn't work. I don't know what you
  mean."</p>

  <p>"I'll try again," said Lewis. "Bulah Singh is rather competent but can't
  be trusted to deny himself the luxury of malice. He's a great man for detail
  &mdash;studies such curiosities as smoke against snow on the sky line and the
  contents of the loads of ponies getting ready to go northward. He thinks
  tactics and strategy are the same thing."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>Lewis readjusted the monocle, stared at Andrew and continued. "Bulah Singh
  is a rather cat-like fellow. I should say his weak point is that he might
  watch a mouse hole too long. He might even watch two or three mouse holes. If
  the mouse used something other than a hole in a wall, Bulah Singh's patience
  might make him look more like a stone Sphinx than an active cat.&mdash;By the
  way, do you find the view good from the monastery roof?"</p>

  <p>"Grand view," said Andrew, "except when it's hidden by clouds; and that's
  most of the time."</p>

  <p>"I am told," said Lewis, "that lots of people are watching for signs of
  the coming of spring. You've no news, I suppose, from Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"It's got whiskers," said Andrew. "Came by the long route. Runner to
  Sinkiang. Radio to Shanghai, spatchcocked into Chinese bulletins intended for
  a Jap who has a Chinese mistress in Macao. Steamer to Hongkong. Third-class
  passenger to Pondicherry. Last lap secret."</p>

  <p>Lewis grinned: "I could tell you the secret!"</p>

  <p>"When in doubt, don't," said Andrew. "What do you want to know? I'll tell
  you."</p>

  <p>"You say it's old news? Even if it's ugly news, I can face it." Lewis
  stressed three of the words with more than necessary emphasis. Then he felt
  Elsa's pulse with a professionally absent-minded air of having nothing else
  to do.</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned. "That's a good cue. Right. Old Ugly-face is said to be a
  fugitive from Lhasa. He's reported to have lost his fight to control the
  young Dalai Lama and has had to go into hiding."</p>

  <p>"Chapter one," said Lewis. "Chapter two, I suppose, gives more
  details."</p>

  <p>"Sort of regular subscriber, aren't you? Yes, there's more of it, seeing
  it's you. Ram-pa Yap-shi, the Lord Abbot of Shig-po-ling, is top dog at the
  moment. He got away from Lhasa with the young Dalai Lama and all the cash in
  the treasury. He has fortified himself at Shig-po-ling, and has offered a big
  reward for the capture of Ugly-face dead or alive."</p>

  <p>"That checks perfectly," said Lewis. "What else?"</p>

  <p>"Not much else. Have you heard of Ambrose St. Malo?"</p>

  <p>"Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"I asked because I thought perhaps you know," said Andrew. "I've been
  warned to watch out for him."</p>

  <p>"Ambrose St. Malo, eh? Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Somewhere in Tibet."</p>

  <p>"That's vague."</p>

  <p>"So is he vague."</p>

  <p>"Bad egg?"</p>

  <p>"Rotten. I'm told he stinks."</p>

  <p>Lewis stood up. "Well," he said, "don't catch a chill on the monastery
  roof. And as for you, young lady, take my advice and change medicine. Mu-ni
  Gam-po's mysterious stuff isn't good for you any longer. You've had enough of
  it&mdash;more than enough. Try a change."</p>

  <p>"But where should I go?"</p>

  <p>"Try Nancy Strong. Even Bulah Singh wouldn't dare to fossick in Nancy
  Strong's medicine chest. Well, so long. See you again soon. Thanks for the
  information."</p>

  <p>He bowed before Mu-ni Gam-po to let the old Abbot touch the crown of his
  head with a special blessing. Andrew Gunning noted that they whispered to
  each other. Lewis walked out and the monk shut the door. Elsa spoke in a
  horrified whisper:</p>

  <p>"Andrew! Why did you do it! Why did you tell him!"</p>

  <p>The Lord Abbot Mu-ni Gam-po got up and bestowed a murmured blessing. The
  attendant monk opened the door, followed the Lord Abbot out and left the door
  slightly ajar. Andrew closed it tight and listened for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Andrew, why did you tell Dr. Lewis&mdash;?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4">CHAPTER 4</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Andrew's face glowed red as he poked at the coals in the
  brazier with bronze tongs. He carefully placed lumps of charcoal in the
  burned-out spaces and then stood away from the fumes.</p>

  <p>"Snow!" said Elsa. "Blizzards!&mdash;Rain!&mdash;Wind!&mdash;I can see
  them." There was a change in her voice. "Sometimes it's easy to tell what
  you're thinking about, Andrew. Only sometimes. Not often."</p>

  <p>He turned and faced her. "Yes. It's too early. But that was the last call.
  Now or never."</p>

  <p>"Marching orders?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You heard him. Morgan Lewis was warning me to get going if I don't
  want to be stopped by Bulah Singh."</p>

  <p>"But, Andrew, why did you tell Dr. Lewis what you did, about Lobsang Pun
  and the Abbot of Shig-po-ling! Those are Tom's secrets. Tom warned you to
  tell no one except&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Except Johnson. But you heard that too. Johnson has gone&mdash;home to
  England. If Morgan Lewis hasn't taken Johnson's place, as head of the Tibetan
  section of the secret intelligence, I miss my guess badly. But Bulah Singh
  doesn't know yet&mdash;or I guess not&mdash;I think that's what Lewis
  meant."</p>

  <p>"But Dr. Lewis is in charge of a hospital&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Johnson was in charge of the Ethnographic Survey. There weren't fifty
  people in the world who knew what Johnson's real job was. Probably not more
  than ten people know about Lewis&mdash;yet."</p>

  <p>"But shouldn't you have known for sure before you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nothing for nothing in this world, Elsa. Pay as you go. Grabbing at
  something for nothing is the sure sign of a man who can't be trusted. Lewis
  told me his news, so I told him mine, although he knew it before I told him.
  He even knew about Ambrose St. Malo. The secret intelligence trick is to
  check one report against the other. One rumor, or even one fact means
  nothing; but if three, four, five, six rumors all check, that's
  different."</p>

  <p>"But, Andrew, should you have told how you get your news?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? Lewis wanted to know where Tom is. So I gave him a chance to put
  two and two together."</p>

  <p>"But why tell him where Tom is?"</p>

  <p>"Because he offered to help me to reach Tom."</p>

  <p>"But, Andrew, he didn't. I heard everything he said."</p>

  <p>"Elsa, sometimes you're so naive that it's hard to remember how smart you
  can be when you're in the mood. If Lewis doesn't mean to help me to get into
  Tibet, why in thunder do you think he'd tip me off that Bulah Singh is on the
  watch to prevent me?"</p>

  <p>"But if Dr. Morgan Lewis has become the head of the secret intelligence,
  surely he can give orders to Bulah Singh, can't he? He can tell Bulah Singh
  to look the other way, while you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't be ridiculous. If Morgan Lewis should make that mistake, Bulah
  Singh would obey the letter of the orders, but he'd watch more alertly than
  ever. From then on, he'd have an insider's nuisance value. Nine-tenths of the
  secret intelligence trick is to keep your subordinates mystified. Bulah Singh
  has orders to prevent anyone from getting into Tibet. Those are standing,
  routine orders. But I'll get through. And Bulah Singh will be reprimanded; if
  he's ready for the trash can he'll be transferred and left wondering who did
  it to him. But he'll know why. Bulah Singh should have let old Mu-ni Gam-po
  alone. I'll bet that's where he slipped up. Mu-ni Gam-po is a philosopher who
  thinks in terms of centuries and has a sense of humor. Bulah Singh is a
  modern wise-guy who thinks he knows all the answers. Calls himself a skeptic.
  Actually he's a superstitious fool."</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh superstitious?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. That's why he's so eager to prove he isn't."</p>

  <p>"I think you're being overconfident, Andrew. Bulah Singh has the
  reputation of being anything but a fool."</p>

  <p>Andrew governed his voice down to the note that flatly indicated patience.
  "You who can read thoughts! Can't you read between words? Lewis told us, as
  plainly as he dared, that Bulah Singh has been trying to get Mu-ni Gam-po
  into trouble for letting me use the monastery roof to watch for smoke signals
  telling when the pass is open into Tibet. That's why I call Bulah Singh a
  fool."</p>

  <p>"But, Andrew, isn't it true that you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sure! And Bulah Singh fell for it&mdash;hard! Fell, too, for the ponies
  in the monastery stable."</p>

  <p>"Well, they're your ponies. I think you're&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew stopped her with a gesture. "Listen: my ponies have been getting
  fat all winter, nearly a hundred miles from here. The loads are ten miles
  away from the ponies. The men are ten miles away from the loads."</p>

  <p>"But, Andrew, it was only three days ago that I saw a big heap of loads
  with your name on them, piled up in two empty stalls in the stables in this
  monastery!"</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned: "I don't know whether Mu-ni Gam-po knows my name is on
  them. Those are monastery loads&mdash;routine supplies for Tibet. Bulah
  Singh's spy will be watching those loads, and watching for my smoke signals
  too, long after I'm over the border, unless I miss my guess about Morgan
  Lewis."</p>

  <p>"But if you're not really watching for smoke signals, how will you know
  when the snow has melted enough to make it possible to get through?"</p>

  <p>"That was Bompo Tsering's job. He's done it. He brought word last night
  that there's only one bad place left, and that's negotiable."</p>

  <p>"Where is Bompo Tsering?"</p>

  <p>"He was ten miles away from the ponies, being watched by one of Bulah
  Singh's undercover men, who has lost most of his pay to Bompo Tsering at a
  game that they play with a board and sheeps' knuckle-bones. Just now Bompo
  Tsering is buying odds and ends and fretting to get away tonight instead of
  tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow? You might have told me, Andrew. I never guessed you'd be going
  so soon. When Dr. Lewis spoke of my staying with Nancy Strong, I had a
  presentiment. But&mdash;" She left off speaking, staring at the brazier.</p>

  <p>Andrew didn't answer. He paced the floor, clenching a wrist behind his
  back and stepping accurately on the cracks between the flagstones. After a
  minute or two he stood facing the narrow window and watched the rain in the
  courtyard, wondering what the devil to say to Elsa. Worse than that, he was
  wondering what the devil to say to Tom Grayne when he should reach him,
  nearly a thousand miles away, up over the Roof of the World. Elsa interrupted
  his train of thought:</p>

  <p>"Andrew, if Dr. Morgan Lewis has become the head of the secret
  intelligence, and if Mu-ni Gam-po knows it, or even suspects it, why should
  Dr. Lewis have talked in riddles? Why couldn't he say things plainly?"</p>

  <p>Andrew turned his back to the window. He answered almost absent-mindedly,
  because he was still trying to think what to say to her: "The monk who
  admitted Morgan Lewis and remained in the room is a spy who reports to Bulah
  Singh. That's why."</p>

  <p>"Oh."</p>

  <p>"See here, Elsa."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Andrew. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"What we were talking about just now."</p>

  <p>"You mean about your going away tomorrow? I'd rather not talk about
  it."</p>

  <p>"No. Before that."</p>

  <p>"You mean before Mu-ni Gam-po and Dr. Lewis came in?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Have you written a letter for me to take to Tom Grayne?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I have. I tore up a dozen attempts. But I got it finished two
  days ago. It's wrapped in oiled silk. Shall I give it to you now?"</p>

  <p>"No. What did you write to him?"</p>

  <p>"More than twenty pages, Andrew, both sides of the paper."</p>

  <p>"If you don't care to tell me what you wrote, okay, it's none of my God-
  damned business. That suits me. I'll deliver the letter and say nothing."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you may read the letter if you want to."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to."</p>

  <p>Elsa uncurled herself, rearranged the cushions and sat nearly upright. Her
  eyes looked hunted. "Nearly half the letter," she said, "is about the baby.
  After that I told Tom what I have told you. I told Tom he is free. I told him
  he needn't worry about me any more. His papers will be quite safe in the bank
  vault in London, and I'll leave the key with Professor Mayor. I told him how
  sorry I am to have caused him so much distress, and that he mustn't blame
  himself because it was absolutely all of it my fault. And&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew strode toward her: "That's what I'd have betted you'd done!" He sat
  down on the edge of the basalt throne exactly where Lewis had sat, glaring,
  and scowling so that his eyes were hardly visible beneath the lowered
  eyebrows. Then he suddenly controlled himself, pulled out the head of
  Chenrezi, resumed carving it and didn't speak until he knew his voice was
  steady. It almost seemed as if he was speaking to the carved face of
  Chenrezi:</p>

  <p>"Elsa, I'm going to talk to you as a friend if it's the last time."</p>

  <p>"That's what I asked you to do."</p>

  <p>"You're not playing it straight."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, Andrew? I'm dishonest?"</p>

  <p>"Why ask for advice, and insist on telling me the lowdown, when you'd shot
  your bolt already? Do you call that playing it straight? If you've done it,
  you've done it. So why ask me? Do you want to be told you're a Virgin Mary
  suffering for the sins of the world? All right, I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are too cruel, Andrew. I suppose I asked for it, but you might at
  least&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pull my punches? I won't. I hate cruelty. But what do you call what
  you're doing? Go ahead, give it a name!"</p>

  <p>"You said you'd tell me the answer!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I didn't know then that you'd written to Tom and told him, from
  a thousand miles away, where he gets off. I only guessed it. Guesses don't
  cut ice."</p>

  <p>Elsa stared at him wide-eyed. He waited for her to speak. She couldn't.
  She was almost afraid of him. Her parted lips and bewildered eyes might have
  checked him if he hadn't been carving that piece of wood. He continued,
  without looking at her.</p>

  <p>"Tom never lied to you, did he?"</p>

  <p>"No, never."</p>

  <p>"Do you love each other?"</p>

  <p>"I would never have conceived his baby if I didn't love him."</p>

  <p>"But you don't love him now? Or are you letting Lovelace do your thinking:
  'I could not love thee, dear, so much, lov'd I not honor more'&mdash;and all
  that piffle?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, what do you want me to do? I'm thought out. I don't know what to
  think. If you're going away, you might at least&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do your thinking for you? Not I! And I won't yes you either. But see
  here. I'll use your phrase. You offered yourself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, like millions of other women, to an ideal&mdash;to an idea!"</p>

  <p>"Boloney! You offered yourself to Tom Grayne. Tom accepted. If you've told
  me the truth, you've no right to run out on him. It's unfinished
  business."</p>

  <p>Elsa broke down at last, sobbing quietly, trying to hide the sound from
  Andrew, counting on the flickering shadows and the male's natural gift for
  not noticing things. If he should guess she was crying he might suspect her
  of trying to arouse pity. He knew she was crying. But he knew her too well to
  entertain any such suspicion as that. Pretending not to notice, he told her
  bluntly, almost brutally, what she wanted to tell him:</p>

  <p>"You're disillusioned. You feel helpless. You can't help Tom by staying
  here: you're too closely watched by Bulah Singh. You can't claim you're
  married, because that might get Tom in trouble. No one here knows who was
  your child's father; half of Darjeeling suspects me. You've roughed it long
  enough with Tom, on the Roof of the World, to know you'd die of constipated
  bitterness in the pink-tea world you came from. You'd hate like hell to go
  back to that. Your bit of an income would keep you off the dole. It 'ud pay
  bus fares and a library subscription. You could go to the cinema once or
  twice a week. You might even stand outside Buckingham Palace and watch the
  King go by. And you might get a job teaching school&mdash;but there'd be an
  inspector from the Board of Education to make sure you didn't teach the kids
  that there's any other standard of value than money, or any other viewpoint
  than a mugwump's."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Andrew. Yes. Yes. Is that the answer?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going soon. When I'm gone, you'll be alone."</p>

  <p>"Lonely as a ghost!"</p>

  <p>"Mu-ni Gam-po is sympathetic, but he mistrusts women. And Nancy Strong is
  a woman, so you don't trust her. You don't get along with women."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, that isn't true."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is."</p>

  <p>"You know nothing about it. You've never seen me with other women. How
  could you possibly know?"</p>

  <p>"I'm telling you. You listen. What pulled you through bearing a child in a
  blizzard at sixteen thousand feet above sea level wasn't so much your guts as
  what you used 'em for. Don't forget. I was in on that episode."</p>

  <p>"How could I ever forget?"</p>

  <p>"You just wouldn't be licked because you were fighting back at the whole
  damned traditional curse that was laid on women when some Levite, who had
  returned from Babylon to Jerusalem under Ezra, rewrote the Book of Genesis.
  You were fighting the Apostle Paul and the whole army of phony feminists. Do
  you want to tell me you can stand the company of women who yowl for sex
  equality and bet their sex against the field like any two-tailed penny in a
  crooked two-up joint? They nearly all do it. The political ones are the
  worst."</p>

  <p>"But there are other kinds of women, Andrew."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and you're one of the others. You're clairvoyant. You can
  see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I hate it! Don't pretend that's any good! It's a curse! It isn't
  even reliable. I can't use it when I want to, when it's needed, when it might
  help other people. It comes and goes, almost always at the wrong time. It
  makes me a stranger. People think it's uncanny. They pester me to tell their
  fortunes&mdash;especially other people's fortunes&mdash;and when I refuse
  they think I'm keeping back something too evil to tell. But if I do tell what
  I see, because I forget not to, they think I'm a witch in league with Satan
  &mdash;Oh, go away, Andrew! Go away! Leave me alone! I'm very, very grateful
  for all you've done. But there's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry I
  inflicted all this on you. It wasn't fair."</p>

  <p>"Nothing's fair," he answered. "Nobody is. We're all liabilities, some of
  us doing our best, which isn't much. This world is the only hell we'll ever
  know. We've got to take it and make the best of it, because we can't leave
  it. It isn't a case of devil take the hindmost. The devil gets the front men
  first as the general rule, and gets all of us sooner or later."</p>

  <p>"You believe in the devil?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I do. You and I and all the rest of us are all one devil."</p>

  <p>"I have never heard you even mention God, except when you're angry. Do you
  believe in God?"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe in anything that I believe in," he answered. "Anything
  that we believe in is pretty sure to be wrong. But I know there's God. That's
  different. What you know can't hurt you. What do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've left off caring! No! There's no God! No Christ! Nothing! Go
  away, Andrew. I'll pack up and go to Nancy Strong's house. Mu-ni Gam-po will
  send my things after me. Please come and say good-bye before you leave for
  Tibet, and&mdash;" She sat suddenly bolt upright, possessed by a new idea.
  "Andrew! If I burn that letter&mdash;that I wrote for you to give to Tom
  &mdash;will you&mdash;will you tell him instead?"</p>

  <p>"No. I won't. That was a hell of a letter to write to a man." He got to
  his feet. "Where is it?"</p>

  <p>Elsa hesitated. Suddenly she got up and went to the writing table where
  her English translation of Tibetan folios lay piled in a heap. She took the
  letter from a leather folder. It was wrapped in oilskin and heavily sealed.
  She stood holding it between the fingers of both hands, looking thoroughbred
  &mdash;slim, mettlesome, beginning to be very angry. Andrew stood still,
  watching.</p>

  <p>"You're proud, aren't you, Andrew? You're too proud to have a hand in what
  looks to you like cowardice. Your pride is cruel. You're hard. But I can be
  as hard as you are. So very well: I will burn the letter. Then you shall tell
  me the answer."</p>

  <p>"Now you're talking," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not. I'm burning my bridges, once more, for the last time."</p>

  <p>Andrew stepped aside and watched her lay the letter on the hot coal in the
  brazier. The burning silk stank; so did the sealing wax; it made her gasp,
  but even that didn't conceal from Andrew the fact that her expression changed
  while she watched the letter turn to ashes . At last she met his eyes, across
  the brazier.</p>

  <p>"Andrew&mdash;just now you were thinking about the snow in the passes
  toward Tibet and what the spring storms will be like. I saw your mental
  picture&mdash;all the long trail&mdash;all of it&mdash;all in a moment."</p>

  <p>"That's nothing," he answered. "Lots of people could do that. What
  else?"</p>

  <p>"You weren't alone on the trail."</p>

  <p>"Of course I wasn't. Don't be silly. There'll be Bompo Tsering and the
  rest of the Tibetan gang. There'll be ponies, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There was someone else&mdash;shadowy&mdash;someone who didn't belong, and
  yet did belong. It's hard to explain. It's as if the others, and the ponies,
  and the loads, and the trail are all fixed in our mind and quite clear,
  including even the men's characters and the ponies' temperaments. But the
  other person was vague, as if you weren't sure, or didn't like the idea,
  or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who was it?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Andrew! I've no right to ask this. It isn't fair. It isn't even
  reasonable. Will you let me go with you to Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"Okay."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, are you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I said yes. The hell of it is, it means three extra ponies and maybe a
  couple of extra yaks to carry fodder for the ponies, and an extra tent, and
  your rations. It'll be harder to get away, and there'll be trouble about
  staying where they don't like women&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know. It's impossible! Andrew, I shouldn't have asked. I know I
  shouldn't have."</p>

  <p>"You can't play it straight anyhow else, if you can stand the journey. Can
  you stand it?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I can stand anything! I'm as strong as a horse. Really I am. I'm
  all over it&mdash;quite well again. Andrew, honestly if I didn't know I could
  make it I wouldn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Okay. It'll be tough going."</p>

  <p>"Don't I know it! But I did it before when I was heavy with child. It
  should be easier this time. But what will Tom say?"</p>

  <p>"That's Tom's business."</p>

  <p>"Tom told me to stay in Darjeeling."</p>

  <p>"Yeah. I heard him. But he asked me to do the best I can for you. I said I
  would. So that's that. I'll go and see about those extra ponies before Bulah
  Singh gets wise to us."</p>

  <p>"One minute, Andrew! Please wait! How about Dr. Morgan Lewis? What will he
  say?"</p>

  <p>"We'll find that out soon enough. He won't be so easy as Bulah Singh.
  Can't fool Lewis. But he's on the level. I'm betting he's the new Number One
  in Johnson's place. If I'm right, we're in luck."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you're the kindest and most astonishing man in the world. What
  can I say that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Say nothing. Just do as you're told and you'll be all right."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Andrew. I know it's no use thanking you for anything. From now
  on I'm taking orders. You give them. Am I to go to Nancy Strong's house?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. Lewis tipped us off about that."</p>

  <p>"Very well. But Nancy will ask questions, and she'll know what kind of
  questions to ask."</p>

  <p>"Answer her questions. Make sure no one overhears you, that's all. I'll
  see Mu-ni Gam-po on my way out and get him to sleight-of-hand you out of here
  by the back way, so that Bulah Singh won't know about it. He'll know Morgan
  Lewis has been here. So we'd better keep the curtains drawn and send out a
  rumor you've had a relapse. I'll attend to all that. How long will it take
  you to pack your things?"</p>

  <p>"Fifteen-twenty minutes."</p>

  <p>"Go to it. Keep under cover at Nancy Strong's until you hear from me
  again. I'll send saddlebags to Nancy's, and you'll have to get her to buy any
  extras you'll need. Leave your manuscripts with Mu-ni Gam-po. Nancy Strong
  will take care of anything else you have to leave behind. Will you trust me
  to buy you a traveling kit?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, is there anything you can't be trusted to do?"</p>

  <p>His expression made her wish she hadn't said it. He always shook off
  flattery, and even genuine praise and gratitude, as if the thought of it hurt
  him.</p>

  <p>"Give me one of your boots," he answered. "I'll take that with me for, the
  right size."</p>

  <p>Elsa produced a felt boot from a chest. Andrew wrapped it in a woolen
  shawl and tucked it under his arm.</p>

  <p>"All right. Then I'll get going and attend to things. I'm glad you're
  coming."</p>

  <p>"You're glad I'm coming? Andrew, please don't think you have to say that
  kind of thing. I'm&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You go to Nancy Strong's and be ready to start at a moment's notice, any
  hour, day or night. No letters, remember. No telegrams. No good-byes for
  Bulah Singh to listen in on."</p>

  <p>"Trust me. I wouldn't dream of it."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing else, is there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, just one other thing. Andrew l I know you don't like sentimental
  scenes, so I won't make one. And besides, I'm so grateful to you that I
  couldn't say it anyhow. But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right. You keep your head and hold your tongue and you'll
  be all right. See you later."</p>

  <p>Andrew walked out, leaving her standing beside the brazier, staring after
  him, wondering. The door slammed. The coals in the brazier sank. A bell
  summoned the monks to chapel. Silence became a dimension of dim-hued
  existence. With the faculty that she hated, of visualizing absent people so
  clearly that they seemed more real than when they were actually present, she
  saw Andrew Gunning now, exactly as he had stood a few moments ago beside the
  brazier talking to her. But, as in a dream when time and space coalesce
  without confusion, she could simultaneously see him by the window, and on the
  edge of the basalt throne, carving Chenrezi's head, fencing verbally with
  Morgan Lewis, scowling at some of her own remarks. And there was Bulah Singh,
  the Sikh Chief of Police, gazing at her. Simultaneously there was Tom Grayne,
  hundreds of miles to the northward, solitary, in a cave, in Tibet. And she
  knew Tom was thinking of her. He was angry&mdash;unhappy&mdash;uncertain
  and&mdash;so it seemed to her vision&mdash;ashamed.</p>

  <p>She dragged out a battered suitcase and began packing.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5">CHAPTER 5</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At the end of the rain-swept courtyard Andrew mounted the
  stairs and tried to interview Mu-ni Gam-po. But at the corner of the long
  gallery, where the passage turned off to the Abbot's apartment, he was told
  by a smiling monk that blessed meditation must not be disturbed. That was a
  plain diplomatic evasion. He could hear voices. Whoever was meditating in the
  Abbot's apartment was doing it noisily with at least three voices.</p>

  <p>Andrew paced the wooden gallery. His footsteps echoed across the
  courtyard. He was consequently watched by monks, whose gift for grapevine
  gossip was as well developed as if they had been prisoners in a penitentiary.
  He was a scandal, the butt of guesswork. The usual bells rang. The routine
  two-by-two and to-and-fro processions of monks through the courtyard arch
  continued&mdash;mysterious goings and comings, whose mystery was how humans
  could endure such routine.</p>

  <p>It left off raining. A few stars appeared. The moon broke through hurrying
  clouds and was reflected like a stream of pure gold on the dark wet courtyard
  paving-stones. Lonely. Beautiful. Unreal. Andrew fought for a grip on reality
  &mdash;an enormously difficult thing to do in a crisis, in which the only
  certainty was that nothing was certain. Facts were dead things, meaning
  whatever one chose to make them mean. Ideas were playing havoc with the
  facts. Somewhere between fact and idea lay reason. But even reason was a mess
  of contradictions. The reason why he had simply, naturally, intuitionally
  recognized the rightness of taking Elsa back to Tom Grayne was smothered and
  contradicted by plausible, logical matter of fact.</p>

  <p>"Intuition is right. Logic is wrong&mdash;or there'd never be anything
  new. Yes there would, though. There's a logic of intuition."</p>

  <p>So thought Andrew, with the part of him that did think. Part of his mind
  was musing on the trail toward Tibet&mdash;wind-swept passes twenty thousand
  feet above sea level&mdash;chasms and crags and the merciless rivers that
  shout like fighting devils between cliffs where eagles build their nests
  beneath a turquoise sky. He hated Tibet&mdash;loved it because he hated it,
  hatred and love being one. No need to think. He could half close his eyes and
  remember, just as clearly as one sees the Himalayan panorama from the
  Singalila Ridge. He knew all the known difficulties, and knew there were
  thousands more that he couldn't imagine. He could see what he did know, all
  in one picture: Tibet; Elsa; Tom Grayne. Those were facts that must interpret
  themselves&mdash;or be interpreted by the light of an idea that hadn't yet
  dawned on reason. Andrew himself was a fact; a self-contradictory, curious
  fact&mdash;pitiless, generous, skeptical, credulous, all in one. A lover of
  conflict. A hater of quarrels. A poet, who had never written one line of
  poetry nor sung one song of his own making, yet who knew he was a poet.
  Paradoxical lover of lofty views that made him veil his thought with blunt,
  ungracious words. That much he knew of himself and could laugh at &mdash;at
  least smile at. He could see himself as a remarkably comical fellow, to be
  handled with alert discretion because there was a streak in him that he knew
  no more about than other people did and that caused him to surprise himself.
  He wasn't thinking about that; but he saw it, mentally, while he tried to
  concentrate on what to say to Mu-ni Gam-po.</p>

  <p>The mental picture and conflict were interrupted suddenly by voices in the
  door of Mu-ni Gam-po's antechamber. He was instantly alert, but he continued
  pacing the gallery until he reached the head of the stairs. There he turned
  in no hurry and retraced his footsteps; becoming angry, not because he
  recognized the men coming toward him but because he had been too stupid not
  to expect them. Morgan Lewis, side by side with the Chief of Police Bulah
  Singh, in step together, laughing, joking&mdash;strangely military&mdash;
  looking figures in the cloistered dimness, though they were not in uniform.
  There was only one electric light, in an enameled frame, on a beam of the
  gallery roof. All three came to a halt under it, sharply limned against the
  shadows, facing one another. Morgan Lewis produced his monocle, screwed it
  into his eye&mdash;a symptom&mdash;a gleaming symbol of urbane artfulness.
  Bulah Singh merely nodded, staring at the bundle under Andrew's arm that
  concealed Elsa's boot.</p>

  <p>"This saves no end of looking for you," said Lewis. "Not on your way to
  see Mu-ni Gam-po, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. Is he in?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But don't waste time trying to see him. He's busy. Bulah Singh has
  brought some matters to his attention that will occupy him for several hours.
  You know Bulah Singh, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Sure." Andrew smiled because the lamplight shone full in his face and the
  Sikh was watching him intently.</p>

  <p>"You should know each other better," said Lewis. "Both of you are good
  talkers. Why not get together some time? Oh, by the way, Gunning, I asked
  Mu-ni Gam-po about that translation. He said he'd attend to it. So if that's
  what you wanted to see him about you needn't trouble."</p>

  <p>The Sikh watched Andrew's face but Lewis distracted attention by dropping
  his monocle&mdash;caught it in the palm of his hand&mdash;tossed it two or
  three times, and replaced it in his eye.</p>

  <p>"One of these days you'll be shot for doing that," the Sikh remarked.
  "Someone will mistake it for a signal and he'll plug you in the gizzard."</p>

  <p>"I must cure myself of habits," Lewis answered. "The good habits are the
  worst ones."</p>

  <p>"Are you walking my way?" Andrew asked, addressing both men. "I think I'll
  go to the hotel and maybe turn in."</p>

  <p>"We're important people. We've a car," said Lewis. "We'll give you a lift.
  It's Bulah Singh's car but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly delighted," said the Chief of Police, sounding as if he meant
  it. "Let's go. As a matter of fact, if Mr. Gunning can spare the time, I'd
  like a chat with him."</p>

  <p>It was a command, not an invitation. There was malice in the Sikh's dark
  eyes. Andrew ignored that.</p>

  <p>"Come and have a drink at the hotel," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'm thirsty."</p>

  <p>They walked together to the stairhead, Andrew on the outside, watching
  Lewis for a signal. Lewis made none. They tramped down the stone steps side
  by side, jumped one by one across the puddle at the foot of the stairs, drew
  abreast again and awoke the monastery echoes as they marched in step toward
  the archway that divided outer and inner courtyards. Not a word. Not a hint.
  Not a sign. Not even the monocle now; it had returned to Lewis's vest pocket.
  Andrew broke the silence:</p>

  <p>"Lewis, you'll join us of course for a drink?"</p>

  <p>"No. Not this time. I've a case to look up&mdash;very interesting case.
  Called in for consultation. So I think I'll drop you two at the hotel and
  send the car back for Bulah Singh&mdash;that's to say, if Bulah Singh will
  permit."</p>

  <p>"Why, certainly." The Sikh appeared off guard and anxious to please. "Just
  tell the driver where to take you."</p>

  <p>No one spoke again until they had tramped through the long dark archway
  and halfway across the outer courtyard. Then Bulah Singh spoke in a casual
  tone of voice that didn't quite conceal a tart sub-flavor:</p>

  <p>"Lots of ponies in the monastery stables. Your loads are stowed here,
  aren't they, Gunning?"</p>

  <p>"It saves renting a godown," Andrew answered. "I took the precaution of
  having the loads marked with my name, to prevent misunderstanding."</p>

  <p>The Sikh was about to say something but Morgan Lewis interrupted: "By the
  way, if you're in no hurry, Bulah Singh, I'd like to keep your car until the
  consultation's over. Is that putting too much strain on your good
  nature?"</p>

  <p>"Keep it as long as you please," said the Sikh. "Gunning will have to
  endure my company until you bring the car back, that's all."</p>

  <p>Andrew suspected guile, but he did not glance at Morgan Lewis, lest Bulah
  Singh should also draw conclusions. The Sikh seemed unconscious of possible
  ulterior motive beneath Lewis's innocent air.</p>

  <p>"Gunning and I should find plenty to talk about," he remarked. "I look
  forward to it." He very evidently did look forward to it.</p>

  <p>Andrew got into the waiting car, in the narrow street outside the
  monastery front gate, aware of a new admiration for Morgan Lewis.
  "Translation" obviously meant that Elsa would be spirited away to Nancy
  Strong's house out of Bulah Singh's reach&mdash;she&mdash;Elijah in a chariot
  of petrol. And Lewis had cleverly jockeyed the Chief of Police into a corner,
  to be entertained and encouraged to talk while Lewis used unseen
  wires&mdash;perhaps telephone wires. Lewis was trusting him&mdash;perhaps
  trying him out. One false move, one ill-considered remark, and Bulah Singh
  might close the passes in spite of anything Lewis could do. Lewis probably
  had no executive authority, whereas the Sikh did have. Then worse would
  happen. Tom Grayne would be left without support or supplies, helpless,
  useless, more than nine hundred miles away over the Roof of the World.</p>

  <p>It was abundantly clear to Andrew that the Government was willing he
  should recross the forbidden frontier into Tibet&mdash;but that the Sikh
  wasn't in on the deal&mdash;not yet, at any rate&mdash;and there was conflict
  beneath the surface.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6">CHAPTER 6</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Bulah Singh despised all amateurs. He was himself a
  professional in every sense of the word. He had taken courses in criminology
  in Germany and France; had written, for important quarterlies, a number of
  praiseworthy papers on the history and development of crime in India. He
  believed he had peered beneath the mask of consciousness and understood the
  underlying automatic metaphysical mechanics of human behavior. He had dabbled
  in Karl Marx, Freud, Adler, Watson and Cesare Lombroso. He regarded himself
  as an atheist, but he had studied many religions diligently because of their
  obvious bearing on the problem of what people believe and are likely to do.
  Intellectually vain, he was equally vain of his appearance, careful to look
  as little like a policeman as possible. He didn't even look like a Sikh. He
  never wore a uniform if he could help it, bought his soft felt hats in Vienna
  and his clothes in London. A powerful, lean, clean-shaven, rather
  dark-skinned man with magnificent teeth and dark brown eyes that sometimes
  suggested gentleness and humor. It was his mouth, when he wasn't consciously
  controlling it, that betrayed him; it revealed cruelty, deliberately studied,
  intellectually built into the structure of his thought.</p>

  <p>He sat down in a long armchair in the room next to Andrew's bedroom and
  was at pains to pretend to observe his surroundings. In a secret file at
  police headquarters there was a list of every single object in the room. In
  the same file were copies of all Andrew's recent correspondence, together
  with a not quite accurate account of his activities since the day he was
  born. Andrew guessed as much; he had detected finger marks on rifled
  documents; and besides, he was quite familiar with the means by which police
  in all the countries of the world inform themselves and one another. He held
  the whiskey bottle poised over a tumbler and raised one eyebrow.</p>

  <p>"Up to the pretty," said Bulah Singh. "Not too much soda. No ice."</p>

  <p>Andrew tossed Elsa's boot through the bedroom door and sat down facing
  him, after making sure that there was no one lurking in the corridor. That
  trick worked. The Sikh fell for it&mdash;boasted:</p>

  <p>"Don't be nervous. One of my men is at the head of the stairs to make sure
  we're not interrupted. I planned this conversation."</p>

  <p>"Very thoughtful of you."</p>

  <p>"I have had to think about you." Bulah Singh lighted a cigarette, blew the
  smoke through his nose, crossed his knees and selected the English method of
  disarming frankness. "You have me puzzled."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes I'm a puzzle to myself," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh stuck to the brusque British method. "Come now. No
  metaphysics. I'm a practical man. So are you. Let's lay cards on the table,
  faces upward."</p>

  <p>Andrew's smile was as disarming as the Sikh's assumed frankness: "Okay.
  Suits me. You first."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh's eyes betrayed a flash of resentment. He was used to being
  feared and diffidently treated. He forgot for a tenth of a second to govern
  the line of his mouth. He led the ace of trumps:</p>

  <p>"The frontier into Tibet is closed," he remarked, adding after a second's
  pause: "tight as a drum."</p>

  <p>Andrew followed suit with a little one: "I've heard it's your business to
  see that no one gets through."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Not even a native Tibetan can return home without my leave. When the
  passes are open&mdash;that won't be long now&mdash;there'll be quite an
  exodus. There are two ways to get permits. The wise ones will come to my
  office. The unwise ones will regret their lack of discretion."</p>

  <p>Andrew offered no comment. He lighted his pipe.</p>

  <p>"It's my impression," said Bulah Singh after a moment's silence, "that
  it's your immediate ambition to rejoin Tom Grayne in Tibet."</p>

  <p>"I've thought of doing it," said Andrew. "But do you appreciate what a
  journey it would be by way of China, with China being raped by the Japanese?
  It would take at least six months&mdash;perhaps longer. It would cost like
  hell, too."</p>

  <p>"Ah. But how about returning by the way you came?"</p>

  <p>Andrew's smile widened: "Are you suggesting that I'm fool enough to try to
  escape your vigilance?"</p>

  <p>"Tom Grayne was one of Johnson's pets," said Bulah Singh, tasting his
  whiskey. "That's how Tom Grayne got through." He watched Andrew's face
  narrowly, under lowered eyelids, over the top of the glass, then set the
  glass down slowly on the small brass-topped table beside the chair and
  continued: "Johnson is no longer with us. His worst fault was that he
  couldn't train a successor. The job is vacant. There are several
  candidates."</p>

  <p>"Are you one of them?"</p>

  <p>The Sikh avoided the question. "You are no tenderfoot," he remarked. "I
  think that is the correct word. You know as well as I do that reciprocity and
  mutual concessions are the secret of all bargains."</p>

  <p>Andrew agreed: "Sure. Nothing for nothing."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh sipped whiskey without looking at him. No need to look; he had
  his victim interested. All that remained was to jiggle the bait: "Suppose I
  tell what I know," he suggested. "Then you tell what you know. Something
  might come of it."</p>

  <p>"Swell."</p>

  <p>"You are clever, Andrew Gunning, or I wouldn't waste time talking to you.
  Beneath that air of almost brutal directness you're as smart as a fox. But
  even foxes make mistakes. I happen to know that Tom Grayne is somewhere near
  Shig-po-ling, short of provisions. You want to take provisions to him. I have
  had to speak to the Abbot Mu-ni Gam-po about those loads of yours. If they
  should be moved from the monastery stable without my permission it would be
  awkward for Mu-ni Gam-po."</p>

  <p>Andrew looked serious: "Glad you mentioned it. The old Abbot has been kind
  to Elsa Burbage. Kind to me, too. I'd hate to make trouble for him."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh nodded: "Mu-ni Gam-po can't afford any more mistakes. He has
  been playing with fire for too many years. His method is shopworn&mdash;
  amateurish. His political sagacity is sticky with religion. It belongs to a
  dead era that has been decomposing since the World War and was buried at last
  when Johnson of the Ethnographic Survey left for England. Johnson was a
  typical B.S.I.&mdash;bigot, stupid, incorruptible. A reactionary."</p>

  <p>"I never met him," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"So I understand. Johnson was trained, if you care to call it training, in
  the days when Whitehall's grip on India was strong. He was an amateur, with
  all the faults that go with it. Too many irons in the fire. No concentration.
  You're aware, I suppose, that the B.S.I. controls the Foreign Office?
  Actually it secretly rules the British Empire. It's even independently
  financed, from Persian oil wells. Well&mdash;there's a strong undercurrent in
  favor of changing all that, at least as concerns India. A professional
  &mdash;Indian by birth&mdash;responsible to Delhi, not Whitehall&mdash; do
  you get me?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Andrew, gravely courteous. "Changes are going on everywhere.
  Who'd heard of Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, twenty, years ago? I guess it's
  simply a matter of the right man, at the right moment, with the right
  information and the right idea."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh blew a smoke ring and pushed his finger through it, indicating
  bull's-eye, first shot, and time to be careful. "I could use some information
  about Tibet," he remarked.</p>

  <p>Andrew accepted the opening: "Yes, whoever could swing Tibet would be
  powerful. He could upset any political calculations. But are you young
  enough? And have you the backing in India?"</p>

  <p>"I have detractors. I have enemies," said Bulah Singh. "Envy, jealousy,
  malice, are inseparable fro politics. Very few people can be impersonal when
  it comes to making political appointments. As for impartiality, that consists
  in understanding neither side of a problem. Some very influential people, who
  call themselves impartial, and perhaps believe it, are opposed to the
  principle of putting an Indian into a key position, no matter what his
  qualifications. Their prejudices masquerade as principles. But I'm a realist.
  Hard facts are what interest me."</p>

  <p>"What facts do you want to know?" Andrew asked.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;for instance&mdash;" he blew smoke through his nose&mdash;
  "who pays you?"</p>

  <p>"No one. I've a private income. I'm a free lance."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh's eyes hardened: "Ummnn. If I believed that, it might possibly
  simplify matters. But the fact is, you're an agent of the United States
  Department of State, or else of the Treasury, or the Army or Navy, or
  possibly even the Postal Department. Who sent you from Shanghai to Shig-po-
  ling?"</p>

  <p>"The same man who pays Tom Grayne," Andrew answered.</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh sipped at his drink thoughtfully. "I know who pays Tom
  Grayne," he said after a moment.</p>

  <p>"Swell. Then we needn't discuss it."</p>

  <p>"You are unpaid? That is very interesting, if true. Have you any idea why
  the American Government should be interested in what's going on in Tibet? As
  a private citizen, unpaid, I suppose you feel free to discuss that?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Andrew, "since you ask me, it's my guess that the American
  Government doesn't give a good God-damn what's happening in Tibet. You'll
  have to take that or leave it. I believe it's the truth."</p>

  <p>The Sikh sneered. "It is one hundred per cent true that you can't cross
  the border into Tibet&mdash;without my leave. You'd better talk."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Andrew, "if my opinion's any use to you, I'd say that our
  Army and Navy are Watching Japan. Why shouldn't they? If they know what
  Japan's commitments and intentions are they can bear 'em in mind. If the Japs
  win, the Far East cat jumps one way. If the Chinese win, it jumps the other
  way. Forewarned is forearmed."</p>

  <p>"Forewarned is what you are now," said Bulah Singh. If you want special
  favors&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"If you don't want special inconvenience, and even special arrest, under
  special regulations, devised for the special purpose of preventing
  unauthorized or seditious acts&mdash;I advise you to tell me plainly why Tom
  Grayne is interested in the infant Dalai Lama, and what his and your interest
  amounts to."</p>

  <p>"That's a long story," said Andrew. "You know, of course, how they go
  about getting a new Dalai Lama?"</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh betrayed a flash of impatience. But he appeared to decide that
  Andrew wasn't quite ripe yet for plucking. "Yes," he said after a moment, "I
  have made a study of that. Such superstitions are more revealing than even
  Frazer points out in his Golden Bough. Have you read that?"</p>

  <p>"Some of it," said Andrew. "I read two or three volumes and got
  bored."</p>

  <p>"A study of Frazer explains why Hitler is inventing a new religion for the
  Germans; and why he attacks Christianity."</p>

  <p>"What's your point?" asked Andrew. "What are you driving at?"</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh's eyes were excited, but he talked on patiently: "The Tibetan
  superstition, that a dead Dalai Lama reincarnates almost instantly into the
  body of a newborn child, would be comical if it weren't actually, when it's
  well analyzed, the same old myth that's at the root of all religion. Of
  course in practice it sets up, a vicious circle because of the human craving
  for power. Poison is the obvious corollary; any criminologist could foretell
  that. The men behind the scenes poison a Dalai Lama and set up a Council of
  Regents, who then claim supernatural guidance and in due course they discover
  a child into whose body the poisoned victim is supposed to have reincarnated.
  They take the child away from his mother and control him until just before he
  comes of age. Then again they poison him, and begin all over. That makes it
  very nice for the Council of Regents."</p>

  <p>"You seem to know as much about it as I do," said Andrew. "Why don't you
  come to the point? I won't betray your confidences."</p>

  <p>The Sikh stared. He was startled: "Pardon me," he said. "Let's understand
  each other. It is your confidences that won't be betrayed&mdash;provided
  they're of value to me."</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed. "The difficulty is, I know no more than you do. However,
  here's the low-down, for what it's worth. If you know it already, say so, and
  I'll stop talking. The Council of Regents in Lhasa, with one exception, are
  political crooks with phony religious credentials. For centuries it has been
  the first principle of the Tibetan political game to play off the Dalai Lama
  against the Panchen Lama, and make rivals of them, instead of co-rulers as
  they're supposed to be. But now there's neither Dalai nor Panchen Lama. A few
  years ago, you remember, they chased the Panchen Lama into exile in China,
  because he was too incorrigibly honest. After that, they poisoned the best
  Dalai Lama that Tibet ever had. That gave the ball to the political gang. So
  they staged the usual circus, scoured the countryside and discovered a
  newborn child whom they identified as the Dalai Lama's successor. The Panchen
  Lama imposed his official veto. But the Regents treated that as a joke
  because they had chased him out of Tibet and he couldn't come back. He died
  in exile quite recently. So the new infant Dalai Lama's divine right to the
  throne of Tibet stands unchallenged. He has a propaganda value."</p>

  <p>"He has more than that," said the Sikh,</p>

  <p>"Call it poker, if you prefer the word." Andrew was warming up. "The point
  is that China, Japan and Russia realize his potential value. They are
  employing some of the cleverest secret agents in the world, and almost
  unlimited money, to gain political control of Tibet. Tibet is not the obvious
  key, but it's the real key to the control of Asia. And the key to Tibet is
  the infant Dalai Lama. Have I made that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. That's a good precis. But there's nothing secret about it," said
  Bulah Singh. "It even appeared in the American newspapers. I have the
  clippings. What else do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Probably no more than you know," said Andrew. "The self-appointed Council
  of Regents in Lhasa have been bribed alternately by Russian, Japanese and
  Chinese agents, and supplied with weapons and so on. They've been fed so much
  bull and boloney and lying propaganda that they're three parts crazy. They'd
  rather cut each other's throats than come in out of the wet. They all thought
  themselves Machiavellis, but now they feel more like hayseeds in a gyp-
  joint. There was only one member of the Council who ever rated as a real
  number one man. No doubt you've heard of him. They gave him the works. Damned
  near killed him. Chased him out of Lhasa. He's in hiding."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh's eyes narrowed. He interrupted. Which one do you refer
  to?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know him personally. Never met him," said Andrew. "Tom Grayne
  knows him well."</p>

  <p>"Ah." The Sikh's eyes glittered. "Then Elsa Burbage also knows him?"</p>

  <p>Andrew noticed the tactical change of attack. He sensed the sudden lunge
  of directed thought, like a rapier under his guard.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Lewis could tell you," he answered. He knew it wasn't a clever
  answer, but it gave him a second in which to think and recover.</p>

  <p>The Sikh followed up: "I am asking you, not Lewis."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I heard you."</p>

  <p>"Is the man you mean the Ringding Gelong Lama Lobsang Pun?"</p>

  <p>"If you know him, why ask me?" Andrew retorted.</p>

  <p>The Sikh nodded dark then demanded suddenly: "Where is the infant Dalai
  Lama? Do you know?"</p>

  <p>"You may have later news than mine," said Andrew, "but what happened is
  this: the Abbot of Shig-po-ling is no more a genuine Abbot than you or I, but
  he's one of the Regents&mdash;his right name is Ram-pa Yap-shi. He carried
  off the infant Dalai Lama to the fortified monastery at Shig-po-ling, where
  he is dickering with Russian and Japanese agents. Perhaps with Chinese agents
  too. Presumably he'll sell out to the highest bidder."</p>

  <p>The Sikh nodded: "That isn't news, but it's true. Physical possession of
  the infant Dalai Lama would be a bargain at any price," he remarked. "How old
  is he?"</p>

  <p>"He must be about five years old by now."</p>

  <p>"Still young enough. The Jesuits were right about catching them young.
  Mussolini is following suit. So are Stalin and Hitler&mdash;training infants.
  So is Nancy Strong, God damn her! Teach the child, the man obeys. Sow now and
  reap the Future. The child is father to the man. Educated by Japan, the Dalai
  Lama would be Japanese. Educated by a Russian expert, he would become more
  Russian than Stalin himself. What is Tom Grayne doing?"</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned genially: "If I knew, I'd tell you."</p>

  <p>"You do know. You have means of communication with Tom Grayne in
  Tibet."</p>

  <p>Andrew stiffened. "If he and I corresponded by mail, you'd have no need to
  ask questions, would you?"</p>

  <p>The Sikh also stiffened. He had finished feinting. He commenced actual
  assault. Its violence was hypnotic: "You correspond by way of Sinkiang,
  Hongkong and Macao. Smart work, but not secret from me. You have another,
  much more secret means. Cooperate, in that, with me&mdash;or take the
  consequences."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I get you." said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"No? I will drop you a hint."</p>

  <p>"Go to it."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever hear that during the World War the German High Seas Fleet
  put to sea, not long before the Battle of Jutland, simply and solely to find
  out whether it was true, as they suspected, that the British Admiralty had
  occult means of reading the German secret signals?"</p>

  <p>"No, I never heard of that. I don't believe it," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Don't you! Then read what Admiral Bacon says about it in his life of Lord
  Fisher. I can lend you the book."</p>

  <p>"I don't care if it's in fifty books. I don't believe it," said
  Andrew.</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh smiled importantly: "Von Tirpitz and Ludendorff did believe
  it. Why? Because they themselves were also trying to use occult means, in
  competition with the British secret intelligence."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>"I knew Ludendorff&mdash;after the war. But before the war, I was one of
  the secret observers appointed to watch the staff of the German Crown Prince
  when he came to India. Do you know why the Crown Prince was obliged to leave
  India so suddenly?"</p>

  <p>"I was in short pants in those days," said Andrew. "I was learning all
  about Santa 'Claus and George Washington and the Cherry Tree, and how the
  doctor brings newborn babies in a handbag."</p>

  <p>"Members of the Crown Prince's staff," said Bulah Sing, "were discovered
  attempting to establish a telepathic link with Indian seditionists for
  propaganda purposes in time of war. It was I who caught them at it. The Crown
  Prince was given his walking orders, and the Germans never did get beyond the
  experimental stage."</p>

  <p>"That kind of thing is darned easy to say," Andrew remarked. "I should say
  it's less easy to prove."</p>

  <p>'Impossible to prove!" The Sikh's eyes glowered like an angry dog's. "That
  is its value! Its virtue! Its importance. That is why you get away with it!
  That is why you and I can't deal on ordinary terms. There must be guarantees.
  How do you wish to return to Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"No orders yet," said Andrew eyeing him hard. "I've been wondering whether
  some of my correspondence has been held up."</p>

  <p>The Sikh accepted the challenge: "Oh, I'll be quite frank about that. Your
  mail goes through the usual channels. The one you received from the United
  States last Tuesday was in code. I read it. It was signed 'Hofstedder.' It
  said something about taking a walk that suggested a possible double meaning.
  That's why I asked where you're hoping to go."</p>

  <p>"I have the letter in my pocket," Andrew answered.</p>

  <p>"Well, see here, Gunning. Let's suppose that the dice should be loaded a
  bit in your favor. Let's suppose you should slip over the border discreetly
  without any risk of being caught. Would you reciprocate?"</p>

  <p>"How? In what way?"</p>

  <p>"In any way I stipulate."</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned: "That's a tall order. You'd better explain."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh stood up. He lighted another cigarette. He half closed his
  eyes. He came closer to Andrew, standing over him, looking down at him. His
  mouth didn't look like a man's any longer; it suggested a gash made by a
  surgeon's knife. He held his voice down to a flat monotone.</p>

  <p>"I've got you by the short hair, Andrew Gunning. There's no India Office
  visa on your passport. There's the little matter of Elsa Burbage to be
  explained. And there are those loads at the monastery. Taking a walk is
  exactly you are going to do&mdash;in either of two directions. Agree with me,
  and over the Roof of the World with you. Otherwise, take the first boat from
  Calcutta or Bombay. Which is it?"</p>

  <p>The knuckles of Andrew's fingers that clutched the chair-arm turned white
  under the pressure of self-control. The professional Bulah Singh should have
  noticed it, but he seemed not to. Andrew knew that Morgan Lewis had purposely
  left him alone with the Sikh. He couldn't risk anger. He glanced at his
  watch, at the door, at the window; made a rather amateurish effort to look
  furtive, realized that the Sikh saw through that, changed it to a skeptical
  grin that was far more effective, and said: "Sit down. Help yourself to a
  drink. Let's talk things over."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7">CHAPTER 7</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Elsa's bazaar-bought raincoat made a pool around her feet on
  the floor of Nancy Strong's hallway. The turbaned servant who hung up the
  raincoat and knelt to wipe her wet shoes clucked solicitous comment. He was
  used to all kinds of people&mdash;even well-bred, gently mannered people in
  inexpensive clothes, who came without warning in the rain, at unconscionable
  hours. But why no galoshes? Why were her shoes not wetter than they were? If
  she hadn't walked, how had she got there? The effort of suppressing the urge
  to ask questions so occupied his mind that he forgot his manners and left her
  standing in the hall while he switched on the light in the living-room and
  frugally added pine knots to the blazing fire.</p>

  <p>The hall was lined on both sides with books in shelves about shoulder-
  high; on the wall above those were plainly framed photographs of ex-pupils of
  Nancy's school. Tibet, Nepal and every province of India were represented. On
  top of the shelves were statuettes, done in clay by the pupils and baked in
  the school kiln. Some of them were very revealing portraits of Nancy Strong
  as seen through the eyes of attentive, inquisitive Indian youth. No two alike
  &mdash;even remotely alike&mdash;and yet all unmistakably Nancy Strong in one
  mood or another.</p>

  <p>Elsa felt relieved that Nancy wasn't there to receive her. She needed
  time, after a wild ride through the rain with Dr. Lewis in Bulah Singh's car,
  to subdue emotions that made her heart beat quickly and her head feel almost
  like someone else's, full of unfamiliar thought that she recognized
  nevertheless as her own. She admired Nancy Strong, but she was conscious of
  being on guard against her. She even liked her. But she didn't quite trust
  her. Not quite. There was something about Nancy that always made her feel shy
  and reserved. Perhaps it was the school-teacher quality. It was a superficial
  manner, because Nancy had no unpleasant mannerisms. It was more likely a
  habit of thought, concealed but evident to Elsa's sensitive perception. Her
  perception was much too sensitive. Elsa knew it. She was always much too
  careful, and perhaps afraid, of meeting other people's minds in unmasked
  conflict. Each time she had met Nancy hitherto she hid always felt vaguely
  antagonistic, almost sulkily disposed to cover up her own thought and talk
  superficially, which she could do very well when she wanted to. Sometimes
  Nancy even made her feel like a small animal that creeps into its hole and
  watches, listens, wonders what next?</p>

  <p>So when the servant ushered her into the vast living room she made an
  effort of will to be natural, at ease, and confident of welcome. It didn't
  quite work. But she achieved some success. The servant seemed to notice it.
  He smiled at her as he fussed around rearranging ashtrays, watching her
  furtively, waiting for her to sit down before going to summon his employer.
  She chose a chair near the door. But the moment he left the room she got up
  again and looked about her, as it were feeling for Nancy's atmosphere in
  order to meet her on even ground.</p>

  <p>There was surely no other room in the world quite like that one. In the
  middle of the long wall opposite the door was a huge stone fireplace. In a
  horseshoe around that, within an oblong barricade of bookshelves, were large
  old-fashioned, overstuffed armchairs, each with a footstool and a small end-
  table beside it. The fire shone hospitably through an opening between the
  bookshelves, which were placed back to back, so that books faced both ways,
  inward toward the fireplace and outward toward the room. Outside that
  homelike, snug enclosure the room resembled almost a museum, except for
  touches of humor and a sensation of being lived in. The carpet was from
  Samarkand, too good to tread on. The curtains were from Lhasa, Bukhara and
  Peking. The walls were hung with Tibetan sacred paintings and some of Nancy
  Strong's own, less sacred but strongly unsentimental watercolors, of which
  the most noticeable was a portrait of the late Dalai Lama. There were
  devil-masks, Tibetan weapons, bronze bells, dories, silk embroidery and weird
  musical instruments. At one end of the room was a black grand piano that
  threw everything else out of balance. Its top was a maze of framed
  photographs. Elsa went up and studied them, growing mentally more confused
  and uncertain of Nancy's point of view as she looked, and remembered chance
  remarks, and guessed, and tried to imagine Nancy Strong in such strangely
  assorted company.</p>

  <p>Three were of Viceroys. There was Lord Kitchener in Commander in Chief's
  uniform. The ex-Kaiser, alongside Admiral of the Fleet Lord Fisher and the
  weirdly bearded Von Tirpitz. General Lord Allenby. An archbishop, a cardinal,
  two bishops. King George and Queen Mary. Senator Borah. General Smuts. Sun
  Yat-Sen. Gandhi. President Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt side by side. Mary
  Pickford, Will Rogers. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. Sven Hedin. General
  Younghusband. And no less than eleven Indian ruling princes. All autographed,
  and many of them bearing written record of affection.</p>

  <p>But the most remarkable object in the room stood alone, on a small teak
  table, exactly midway between the door and the fireplace. One had to walk
  around it to reach the opening in the oblong screen of bookshelves. It was a
  much enlarged head and shoulder portrait of the Ringding Gelong Lama Lobsang
  Pun, known in Tibetan and English, and to friend and enemy alike, as Old
  Ugly-face. The portrait started floods of memories pouring into Elsa's mind,
  although it had been obviously taken long before she met him, in the days
  when he was reasonably thin and coming to be recognized in Far East
  diplomatic circles as the new enigma.</p>

  <p>There was a magnificent cat on the hearth, with its back to the fire in
  feline recognition of the fact that the rain had only temporarily ceased. He
  would turn his face to the fire again when the rain resumed. Meanwhile, he
  studied Elsa with Sphinx-like detachment. His face looked something like
  Lobsang Pun's in the silver-framed photograph. It was only a vague
  resemblance, but there it was. You could look at either of them and catch
  yourself thinking about the other&mdash;wondering how many birds the cat had
  killed&mdash;how many secrets Old Ugly-face knew.</p>

  <p>Elsa went and sat down by the fire. She made friendly overtures to the
  cat. But the cat took no notice, any more than Lobsang Pun would have done.
  So she leaned back and stared at the fire, thinking about Lobsang Pun, as she
  last saw him, at the Thunder Dragon Gate in Tibet. But she began to see Bulah
  Singh's face, growing larger and larger amid the burning pine knots. That was
  no good. It didn't frighten her, but it made her feel vaguely guilty of
  forgetting something that she should remember&mdash;secretly guilty of liking
  a man whom really she intensely disliked. To throw off that sensation and get
  her mind on something else she turned sideways in the armchair to glance at
  the rows of books, pulling out a few at random from the nearest shelf behind
  her. Aristotle, Lord Derby's Homer, Plato, Science and Health by Mary Baker
  Eddy. She returned them and tried again, kneeling on the chair to read the
  titles: the Upanishads, Freud, St. Paul's Epistles to the Corinthians in
  Greek, Fitzgerald's Rubaiyat, the Psalms in English, the second volume of
  Karl Marx's Das Kapital in German. The Tibetan Book of the Dead, Tennyson,
  Browning, the Bhagavad-Gita, a whole set of Dickens, the Intimate Papers of
  Colonel House, a set of Shakespeare, Hitler's Mein Kampf in German, the
  Bible, the Koran&mdash;</p>

  <p>Elsa heard the door open. She jumped out of the chair, hurriedly
  straightened her skirt and went and stood in the opening between the
  bookcases, silhouetted with her back to the firelight, feeling rather like a
  bewildered child and not at all sure she was welcome.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8">CHAPTER 8</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Something happened to the room when Nancy Strong entered and
  closed the door behind her, glancing around swiftly before she looked at
  Elsa. She even brought the grand piano into harmony with all the rest of it.
  Gray-haired, gray-eyed, gallantly old-fashioned, even dowdy. She wore one of
  those dependable brown wool frocks that Department Stores can be trusted to
  ship to customers of twenty-five years' standing. Woolen stockings. Tidy
  ankles. Scarred knuckles. Hands like a horseman's. Her face had no room left
  on it for ugliness, there was so much character. She was beautiful from
  having faced trouble and stood up to it and beaten it, times without number.
  A stormy-weather woman, matter-of-fact in her greeting of Elsa:</p>

  <p>"Why did you get up? Sit down again. How did you get here?"</p>

  <p>She took a chair beside Elsa facing the fire. The cat leaped into her
  lap.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Morgan Lewis brought me, in a car belonging to the Chief of
  Police."</p>

  <p>"Is the man mad? Did he let Bulah Singh's chauffeur know where you
  are?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no. He sent the Indian chauffeur away on an errand and drove the car
  himself. He set me down before we reached the front gate, so as not to be
  seen."</p>

  <p>"Take off your shoes and dry your feet at the fire: Does Mu-ni Gam-po know
  you've left the monastery?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I feel sure he knows. He sent his doctor and two other monks to lead
  me through a tunnel I've never seen before to a building quite a long way
  off, and out through a door in a wall to where Dr. Lewis was waiting with the
  car."</p>

  <p>"And your luggage?"</p>

  <p>"The monks will bring it. It was being wrapped in burlap, to look like
  bundles of rags for the carpet makers, when I came away."</p>

  <p>"No need to worry about that then. It will be in the godown before
  midnight. Well, I suppose this means that Andrew Gunning has his marching
  orders."</p>

  <p>Elsa nodded, too excited to answer. There was no need to say that she was
  going with Andrew. The news exuded from her. Nancy Strong shook her head so
  vehemently that a couple of hairpins fell out and she had to rearrange her
  gray mane. She spoke with a hairpin in her teeth:</p>

  <p>"That man Morgan Lewis is worse than Johnson. Much worse. There's no limit
  to Lewis's masculine romanticism. The weaker sex should set us women an
  example of restraint. But they don't. They know we're realists. They egg us
  on to do the things they can't do. Lewis is dangerous. It's too bad that we
  can't get along without dangerous men."</p>

  <p>Elsa rallied to the challenge of injustice: "Dr. Lewis isn't responsible
  for my going back to Tibet. He thinks I'm going to stay here with you."</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong's face flickered with the humor that had made her famous as a
  teacher beyond praise. "Do you think he believes you could teach my orphans
  to make carpets?" she asked. "Lewis is a Welsh romanticist whose ancestors
  were Druids. He would rather turn the corners than come straight to the
  point. He thinks ten minutes' notice is too much."</p>

  <p>Elsa protested, a bit hotly: "Shouldn't I have come? I understood that you
  knew all about it. Dr. Lewis asked me to come here because Bulah Singh has
  been spying on Mu-ni Gam-po. I'm not sure, but I think Mu-ni Gam-po asked Dr.
  Lewis to smuggle me out of the monastery."</p>

  <p>"My dear, you are more than welcome. If you hadn't come here, I would have
  felt sorry. Stay as long as you please. But you must stay indoors because
  Morgan Lewis has spread a rumor that you've had a relapse. I've already heard
  it over the phone from two infallible gossips. You're supposed to be in bed,
  in the dark, at the monastery, behind curtained windows, suffering from fever
  due to overwork translating Tibetan folios. You may even be dead by tomorrow,
  if Morgan Lewis is in good form and tongues wag fast enough."</p>

  <p>"But if Bulah Singh should discover the truth, what then?" Elsa asked,
  suddenly frightened by the thought.</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong noticed it: "Don't feel afraid of Bulah Singh, my dear. He is
  a mere policeman who would love to be a story-book devil. He would skin truth
  for its hide and tallow, if he knew how."</p>

  <p>"Isn't he Chief of Police?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Can't he interfere with Andrew, if he finds out?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. He is said to have some talent for police work. But he suffers
  from intellectual indigestion. And he is as superstitious as an old-fashioned
  witch-finder. Has he bothered you at all?"</p>

  <p>"Yes and no. He was very polite. He called on me at the monastery, several
  times. Brought flowers."</p>

  <p>"Tell me."</p>

  <p>"I disliked him, first go off. Later, when Andrew told me that he reads my
  mail before I get it, I disliked him thoroughly. But I couldn't avoid seeing
  him when he called. And he made himself so extremely civil that it was quite
  difficult to refuse to do what he asked."</p>

  <p>"What was it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he knows I speak fluent Tibetan. And he said he has a Tibetan
  prisoner in the jail who won't answer questions. He wanted me to hide behind
  a screen at police headquarters while that prisoner is being questioned and
  to use what he calls my subconsciousness to read the prisoner's thought while
  he is being questioned. He wanted me to do it without telling anyone else
  &mdash;especially Andrew or Mu-ni Gam-po."</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong chuckled. "I told you, didn't I, that Bulah Singh is
  superstitious."</p>

  <p>"He calls himself a psychologist," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Bluff! He's an ambitious coward who believes that blackmail is a science
  and that double-crossing is a fine art. Did he offer you any compensation for
  your trouble?"</p>

  <p>"He hinted that as Chief of Police he could probably smother&mdash;I think
  that was the word he used&mdash;the inquiries that were being made in certain
  quarters about my being a guest at the monastery and about my right to remain
  in India."</p>

  <p>"Ah! I suspected as much! There are too many like him&mdash;far too many,
  always trying to trade on people's weakness. The key is that use of the word
  subconsciousness. Minus-minds. It's only plus-minds that aren't afraid of
  superconsciousness. Minus-minded people like Bulah Singh call everything they
  can't understand, subconsciousness. That makes them feel superior and
  scientific. Down in the recesses of his dark mind Bulah Singh believes in
  black magic, but he doesn't dare to admit that, even to himself. He wants to
  pile the faggots and watch you burn in your own flame. I want to talk to you
  about that."</p>

  <p>Elsa protested, frowning. "Oh, Nancy Strong, I wish you wouldn't. Do let's
  talk about something else. There are so many things I want to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Child, sit still and listen. I don't in the least mind your coming here
  at ten minutes' notice. In fact I'm very glad to have you. But you will
  either listen to me, or else go to your room. And I warn you: if you do go to
  your room you will miss the only chance I shall have to save you from making
  a fool of yourself. Which shall it be?"</p>

  <p>She stroked the cat until it purred like a tea kettle. Elsa sighed:</p>

  <p>"Very well. But I've had so much of it. And I do so hate it. Nancy, I'm
  returning to Tibet&mdash;secretly! Can't we talk about that? I have Andrew's
  full permission to answer any questions you ask."</p>

  <p>"How did you get out of doing what Bulah Singh wanted? What excuse did you
  give?"</p>

  <p>"You insist! Oh, very well. I told Bulah Singh what I have just told you:
  that I hate and detest clairvoyance. I told him it's bad enough not being
  able to help seeing things that you'd rather not see; but that to go ahead
  and do it deliberately, just for the hell of it, would be like doing
  something unclean."</p>

  <p>"What did Bulah Singh say to that?"</p>

  <p>"He laughed. He looked cruel. He called me superstitious, and he hinted
  that I'm a hypocrite. He said he was surprised that a girl who had come
  through my experience should be afraid to make use of a natural gift."</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong reached for a cigarette and pushed the carved silver box
  across the side-table toward Elsa: "Reach for the matches, will you? I don't
  want to disturb the cat."</p>

  <p>They smoked in silence for a minute or two. Elsa got up, poked the fire,
  put on a lump of wood and sat down again.</p>

  <p>"You were a brave little fool in the first place," said Nancy Strong,
  staring at the end of her cigarette. "I did my level best&mdash;my fighting,
  interfering, irritating female damnedest to prevent you from going to Tibet
  with Tom Grayne. When I was secretly consulted, I went all the way to Delhi
  and back at my own expense to tell Johnson to stop you from going. And I
  tried to talk Tom Grayne out of it, during a whole afternoon on a train. I
  knew all about your secret marriage to Tom Grayne, and about your agreement
  to keep it on a business basis. You two ignorant children held out longer
  than I thought you would. There's a note in my diary that I made at the time.
  I'll look it up presently. I think I allowed Nature three months less than
  Nature actually needed. I didn't allow enough for your ingenuousness or for
  Tom Grayne's obstinacy."</p>

  <p>"It was not Nature. And it wasn't Tom's fault. It was me," Elsa insisted.
  "I did it. I seduced Tom."</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong swept that aside with a gesture. "N'importe. Never mind for
  the moment whose fault, if fault it was. Il y a toujours un qui aime et
  l'autre qui se laisse aimer. But the stuff that I packed into your first-aid
  kit? Where was that when that weakling let you lure him into sin?"</p>

  <p>"I forgot it. I mean, I never thought of it."</p>

  <p>"Elsa, my dear, it is no use your lying to me. You did think of it. You
  thought I was a nasty-minded female. Tell the truth now: didn't you throw it
  away?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't want Tom to know I had stuff like that with me. What could
  he possibly have thought if he'd found it? And besides, I didn't want an
  excuse or a temptation or a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong interrupted: "The trouble with you, my dear, is that you've
  got sex, and love, and religion, and loyalty all mixed up together with
  superstition and bravery in one bottle. Shake the bottle, and out pops human
  nature, cork and all. Added to that, you're clairvoyant and can't understand
  why other people don't see what you see."</p>

  <p>Elsa curled up in the big chair, growing angry but doing her best to
  conceal it. "Oh well, I'm not natural. I know I'm not. I'm a freak."</p>

  <p>"We're all freaks," Nancy answered. "Every last one of us. I'll tell you
  about me one of these days when I'm feeling reminiscent. But tell me about
  Tom Grayne. Does he expect you back in Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"No, he doesn't. He told me to stay in Darjeeling."</p>

  <p>"But you're going back to him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I asked Andrew's advice, this evening."</p>

  <p>Nancy stroked the cat the wrong way. The cat sought solitude, at full
  speed around the bookcase and under the grand piano. "Goon," said Nancy.
  "Tell me about it."</p>

  <p>"But there's nothing to tell. Andrew told me to do my own thinking. I
  couldn't get him to say what he thought I should do. But when I asked him to
  take me back to Tibet, he agreed instantly and said it was the only possible
  answer if I wanted to play it straight."</p>

  <p>"Play what straight?"</p>

  <p>"He meant I should keep my bargain with Tom. He called it unfinished
  business. He made me feel like a thing without any will of my own&mdash; like
  something invented by Tom and Andrew."</p>

  <p>"You mean you'd rather not go?"</p>

  <p>"I'd rather go than do anything else on earth that I can think of. But I
  tried to tell you what it felt like when Andrew agreed to let me go with him.
  I can't really tell it because there aren't the right words. After my baby
  died, I did nothing but think for days and days and weeks. Even when I got
  well enough to work at Tibetan translation, one part of me was thinking,
  wondering what to do&mdash;what I should do&mdash;what was the right thing to
  do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It didn't occur to you at any time to return to Tom?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course it did, thousands of times. Hundreds and hundreds of times
  I saw him, clairvoyantly, just as clearly as I see you now&mdash;more
  clearly, because it's different. And I know Tom was thinking of me. But how
  could I get back to him&mdash;more than nine hundred miles&mdash;across that
  terrible country, without money or a permit to cross the border?"</p>

  <p>"Terrible country? Then you don't like Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"I love it&mdash;perhaps because it is terrible. Perhaps it sounds
  incredible to you, Nancy: but I loved every minute even of that agony when my
  baby was born in the snow. Go ahead: call me a romantic liar if you want to.
  But I tell you it's the unadorned truth."</p>

  <p>"I never had that experience," said Nancy. "Now I'm too old, so I'll take
  your word for it. You make me wonder what I've missed: Did you quarrel with
  Tom?"</p>

  <p>"No, of course I didn't. Tom doesn't quarrel with people. I do. But even I
  can't quarrel with a man who just gets thoughtful and says nothing."</p>

  <p>"Umm. Did Tom and Andrew quarrel?"</p>

  <p>"No indeed. Andrew was with us in Tibet for several months and there was
  never a cross word between them. We three were very happy together in that
  cave in the mountains. There was lots of hardship, and it was dangerous, but
  we all three loved it."</p>

  <p>"So it amounts to this: that Andrew Gunning did what he did to oblige Tom
  Grayne?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, if that's what you're driving at, I can give you a very quick answer.
  I believe Andrew hates me. I can't see why he shouldn't. I forced him to
  upset all his plans to return for supplies by way of Chwanben. I caused him
  unimaginable trouble. No one who hadn't seen it could imagine what Andrew had
  to do to get me safely to Darjeeling. Mind you, he had to deliver my baby in
  a blizzard. And he isn't a doctor! And even after we got here, and I was safe
  in the monastery, I couldn't help making things far more difficult for him
  than they would have been if he had come alone. People even think it was his
  baby. I'm not quite sure that Mu-ni Gam-po doesn't think so. I know Bulah
  Singh suspects it."</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong tossed her cigarette into the fire and lighted another one.
  "The night is young," she remarked. "Long live the night. Go ahead. Tell me
  more."</p>

  <p>"Tell you what?"</p>

  <p>"About Andrew Gunning."</p>

  <p>"I know very little about Andrew, except that he came from Columbus, Ohio,
  by way of Shanghai. He isn't a silent man, and he's well educated, but he
  doesn't talk about himself. I think he's the kindest man I've ever seen or
  heard of, but he resents being thanked, it makes him brusque and rude. And
  he's as cruel as all Tibet if he thinks you're being unjust or trying to
  sidestep responsibility. What do you know about him? He speaks very highly of
  you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, they all do that," said Nancy. "Even Bulah Singh does. It's a habit,
  like driving on the right side of the street. You see I know enough to hang
  most of 'em. So they reward me for discretion by praising my chief
  fault."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, why do such people as you, who have really accomplished something,
  always speak of themselves contemptuously? This school of yours is famous. So
  are you. And you know it."</p>

  <p>"Never trust reputations, my dear. The difference between precept and
  practice is what makes men flatter me behind my back. They hope to God I
  won't tell what I know."</p>

  <p>"Well, tell me what you know about Andrew Gunning."</p>

  <p>"May I tell him what I know about you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you want to." Nancy Strong chuckled: "Smart girl. A disarming
  answer. However, I won't tell you about Andrew."</p>

  <p>"He has told you his story?"</p>

  <p>"They all do it. That's what makes life so interesting. I'm a sort of she-
  priest. An auntie-confessor. They all tell me sooner or later whose wives or
  husbands they're in love with, or tired of, or afraid of, and why."</p>

  <p>"Why did Andrew leave home?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I tell you? Can't you ask him?"</p>

  <p>"I did. Of course I did. How could one help being interested in anyone
  who's as kind as Andrew has been to me. I played fair by telling all about
  me. But when I asked about him, he just dried up and I knew he was angry,
  although he tried not to show it."</p>

  <p>"When did you ask him?"</p>

  <p>"In Tibet, on the way here, before my baby was born. For days and days
  after that he broke the trail as if he were fighting a battle. He was
  furious. He made me think of one of those Vikings in the Scandinavian Sagas
  who fought because fighting was their religion. He seemed to me to be
  fighting invisible things:"</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong probed cautiously: "That second-sight of yours. Did that tell
  you nothing?"</p>

  <p>Elsa shuddered. "It's too much like dreams. It's worse: it's like peeping
  through keyholes, only more disreputable, because you don't risk being caught
  at it."</p>

  <p>"Ah. But what did it tell you about Andrew Gunning?"</p>

  <p>"Not much. Because I so hate it I nearly always shut my mind against it
  and try to think about something else. Don't ask me."</p>

  <p>"But I do ask."</p>

  <p>"I believe you can read my thought. Oh, very well, if you insist.
  Something dreadful happened in America that Andrew can't bear to think about.
  He can't go back home. Or he won't. I'm not sure which."</p>

  <p>"But you're not afraid to go with him to Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Why should I be afraid?"</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong, with her chin resting on a clenched fist and her elbow on
  the chair-arm, studied Elsa for about sixty seconds. Then she asked suddenly:
  "Has anybody ever told you how naive you are in some ways and how shrewd when
  one least expects it of you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Andrew said it."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"This evening."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Nancy, "there's one point on which Andrew and I are
  agreed."</p>

  <p>"Oh. Don't you like Andrew?"</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong chuckled: "My dear, it is I who am setting the trap for you,
  not you for me. I have cross-examined too many hundred children&mdash;some of
  them were famous men, and some were Tibetan orphans, and some were
  scoundrels&mdash;to let anyone turn the tables on me. I won't tell you what I
  think about Andrew Gunning. But I'm going to say what I think about you.
  &mdash;Now, would you like some tea before we begin?"</p>

  <p>"No, thanks."</p>

  <p>"I won't offer you whiskey, because I want your undivided attention and no
  back alleys open for your thought to slide away into and hide. I'm going to
  make you face yourself."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, I believe that fundamentally you're cruel."</p>

  <p>"No. I despise cruelty. If you would rather go to bed, now, and&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>"And be despised as a coward! No, Nancy, you may go ahead. But it feels in
  advance like having to face an operation without anesthetic."</p>

  <p>The cat, whose face resembled Lobsang Pun's, returned and sprang into
  Nancy's lap, purring like a kettle.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9">CHAPTER 9</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was no sound but the splashing of rain through the
  open window. Andrew leaned back in his chair and watched Bulah Singh with an
  expression that puzzled the Chief of Police, who was accustomed to reading
  fear or treachery or insolence, or all three, on the face of a victim. He
  intended to victimize Andrew. Andrew knew it. But both men were puzzled.
  Neither tried to make a secret of it. It was better tactics not to. For a few
  moments the Sikh walked around the room like a wrestler pondering which hold
  to try next. He even flexed his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"See here," he said suddenly, "I'll be frank with you."</p>

  <p>"Yes. We agreed we'd do that."</p>

  <p>"I've made inquiries about you in Columbus and Cincinnati."</p>

  <p>"Fifty, fifty," said Andrew. "I've the lowdown on you, from unimpeachable
  sources."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh looked stung. His voice went a quarter-note higher, sour-
  sharp: "My information is that you left home in embarrassing
  circumstances."</p>

  <p>Andrew chose silence.</p>

  <p>"You were employed in a law office, in Cincinnati. Is that right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I got fed up with criminal law."</p>

  <p>"So I have been given to believe. Shall we go into details?"</p>

  <p>"Not if you want to continue the conversation," said Andrew. "There are
  things I don't talk about. That's one of them. Shall I put it more plainly? I
  mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh no. Sit still. I understand you very well. I wish you to understand
  me."</p>

  <p>"Maybe I'm too dumb to understand you," Andrew suggested. "And you're
  using marked cards. But go ahead. Try me."</p>

  <p>"Being a secret agent you will have no difficulty in grasping my meaning
  exactly. I'm an older man than you. I've had more experience. But we both
  know how many beans make five."</p>

  <p>"I'm not in your class," Andrew answered. "But if you'll quit walking
  about like a caged animal I'll try to get what you're driving at. Sit down
  and drink your whiskey."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh resumed his seat and lighted a cigarette. He looked
  exasperated, but he evidently needed something too badly to risk taking
  offense. Andrew offered him no help whatever; he just sat still and waited
  until Bulah Singh resumed:</p>

  <p>"You know as well as I do that from the bottom, all the way up to the top,
  every policeman and every intelligence officer has his own grapevine, his own
  informants, who report to him, and, who receive a certain amount of
  protection&mdash;or shall we call it immunity from interference&mdash;in
  exchange for secret information, et cetera. Make a note of that word et
  cetera."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Andrew. "It's a word like a conjurer's hat. Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"All governments conduct their secret intelligence service on the same
  principle," said Bulah Singh. "The value of the number one man depends on his
  access to exclusive secret information. On that depends his ability to get
  things done without revealing his own hidden hand. There isn't a police or a
  secret service system in the world that isn't run on that basis."</p>

  <p>"Well, you should know about that," said Andrew. "I guess you've made a
  study of it."</p>

  <p>"An intensive study. A lifetime study. But there are other important
  points. One must be in a position to reward an efficient agent. And one must
  have such a hold over that agent that he can't run out, or dare to misinform,
  or double-cross, or disobey. You get me?"</p>

  <p>Andrew nodded. "Sure. Club in one hand, cash in the other."</p>

  <p>The Sikh promptly corrected him: "A club certainly, yes. But information
  that has to be paid for in currency seldom is worth what it costs. Besides,
  you don't need money. I know the amount of your bank balance. The point is
  that you wish to return to Tibet. And though you deny it, I know you are an
  agent of the American Government."</p>

  <p>"I do deny that," Andrew answered. "Want to bet about it?"</p>

  <p>The Sikh stiffened. "Perhaps you also deny a special interest in the lady
  who calls herself Elsa Burbage?"</p>

  <p>"No. You're getting hot now. I'm concerned about her."</p>

  <p>"I, also," said Bulah Singh. "If it should be made possible for you to
  enter Tibet&mdash;this is confidential, of course, strictly between
  ourselves&mdash;Elsa Burbage would remain here. Do you get my meaning?"</p>

  <p>"No. Put it in plain words."</p>

  <p>"You know, don't you, that Germans, and Russians, and Italians who wish to
  travel abroad&mdash;or who are sent abroad on diplomatic, or on business
  errands, are obliged to leave behind as hostage to guarantee good faith, some
  friend, or member of their family&mdash;parents perhaps&mdash;or a mistress,
  whose personal welfare is&mdash;well, you understand me, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Use plain speech. Say it."</p>

  <p>"As I reminded you once before, there is no India Office visa on your
  passport. You can be run out of the country. So can Elsa Burbage, for having
  entered Tibet without official permission."</p>

  <p>"You're out of your depth there," said Andrew. "Elsa's passport does bear
  an India Office visa. She can't be deported."</p>

  <p>"Yes she can. I happen to know that she is Mrs. Tom Grayne, secretly
  married. So it's a false name on her passport. And there's a law against
  adultery in India. The little question of social morality enters in&mdash;
  nothing important in your eyes or mine&mdash;but&mdash;ah&mdash;a very
  convenient excuse for dealing drastically with the indiscreet. Adultery,
  being a public scandal, comes within the scope of police authority. A married
  woman, traveling in suspicious circumstances, alone with a man who is not her
  husband; and who is lodged, together with her unregistered baby, in a
  Buddhist monastery of all improbable places&mdash;and whose baby dies
  conveniently in spite of expert medical attention&mdash;comes well within
  reach of the law. Now&mdash;do we understand each other?"</p>

  <p>Andrew answered coolly: "I don't think you understand me or Elsa
  Burbage."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh showed his wonderful teeth in a smile that was meant to
  intimidate. It almost did. For unless Dr. Morgan Lewis should know how to
  prevent it, Bulah Singh might make sordid accusations stick; and sheer malice
  might make him attempt it if Andrew should refuse to have dealings with him.
  It seemed as if Bulah Singh could read the thought behind Andrew's eyes:</p>

  <p>"There is nothing more perilous, and therefore foolish," he remarked,
  "than to say no, to a secret proposal, when it is made in good faith by such
  a person as me. I am not a mere policeman. I am one who foresees coming
  events. The time for you to have said no was when we began our conversation.
  Now is the time to say yes."</p>

  <p>Andrew subdued the impulse to use fists and feet and pitch the Sikh into
  the corridor. The Sikh spotted that. He loved to see a proud man forced to
  subdue anger. His own dark eyes brightened with amusement.</p>

  <p>"What's the proposal?" Andrew demanded.</p>

  <p>"You have heard of the Ringding Gelong Lama Lobsang Pun?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. We were speaking of him just now."</p>

  <p>"You have heard also of Ambrose St. Malo?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. What about him?"</p>

  <p>"Ambrose St. Malo," said Bulah Singh, "is an incorrigible scoundrel with
  genius for audacity. He is less scrupulous than a sacred ape. He accepts
  anyone's money. At present I believe he is being paid by Japan. But perhaps
  by Russia. He has crossed Tibet from Sinkiang, and to my actual knowledge he
  is looking for the Lama Lobsang Pun, who is in hiding. Ambrose St. Malo's
  purpose is to make sure of Lobsang Pun in order to capture the infant Dalai
  Lama and spirit him away into Sinkiang to sell him to Russia or Japan, I
  don't know which, and it makes no difference which."</p>

  <p>"And where do you come into the picture?" Andrew demanded.</p>

  <p>"It is my opportunity. Yours, too. Do what I tell you, and you may name
  your own reward."</p>

  <p>"You must take me for a damned fool," said Andrew. "You couldn't buy a
  coolie with that kind of talk."</p>

  <p>The Sikh ignored the comment and went straight to the point. "The infant
  Dalai Lama is the best bet in all Asia. Do you realize that? Whoever controls
  him, controls the subtle undercurrents that are the real, as distinguished
  from the superficial, political forces. Whoever brings the infant Dalai Lama
  to India, for protection&mdash;now do you get my meaning?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;but why can't you say it? There are no witnesses. You want
  Johnson's job. That's the idea, isn't it? You think you'll have a good chance
  to get it if I'll do the difficult dirty work, kidnap the baby Lama, bring
  him here and chuck him into your lap, to prove what a statesman you are. I
  won't do it."</p>

  <p>"I don't want Johnson's job. And you can't afford to refuse my offer or my
  terms," said Bulah Singh. Andrew grinned obstinately: "I'll see your hand.
  What have you got?"</p>

  <p>"I have you and Elsa Burbage."</p>

  <p>"And a damned small kit of scruples, I imagine."</p>

  <p>"If you go to Tibet on my terms, Elsa Burbage will be well taken care of
  at this end."</p>

  <p>"By You?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Have you spoken about it to her?"</p>

  <p>"Yes and no," said the Sikh. "I haven't mentioned your returning to Tibet.
  Even the best women are dangerous, intuitive creatures. They jump to
  conclusions and behave unpredictably. She is more than intuitive. She is
  clairvoyant. I wish to talk to you about that."</p>

  <p>"Well, what of it?"</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to have read a book called Man, the Unknown by Dr. Alexis
  Carrel?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have the book in this room. One of your undercover men left
  fingerprints on two or three of the pages when he went through my effects. I
  wish you'd tell those filthy buzzards of yours to wash their hands before
  they come trespassing."</p>

  <p>The Sikh smiled. "We were speaking of clairvoyance. Dr. Carrel is, I
  believe, the first really eminent western scientist who has dared to make the
  downright statement that clairvoyance is a scientific fact. He isn't one of
  those stuffy fools who confuse it with spiritualism and mediumship. He admits
  it's a demonstrated truth that clairvoyants can perceive the past, the
  present, and the future at one and the same time."</p>

  <p>"I'd give a dollar to know what you're driving at," said Andrew. "Why
  don't you come to the point?"</p>

  <p>"The point is this: clairvoyance is the means by which news is transmitted
  throughout Asia&mdash;especially India. There is nothing fantastic about
  that. It always has been so, and Indians have always known it. There are
  fully accredited instances of news having been transmitted from end to end of
  India faster than the telegraph could do it. Even Lord Roberts mentioned it
  in his biography. I speak as a realist&mdash;as a dealer in accurately
  ascertained, checked and correlated facts. It has been possible in numbers of
  instances to make an accurate time check and to prove beyond possible doubt
  that an occurrence, such as an earthquake or a death by accident or murder,
  and the receipt of the news hundreds of miles away, were simultaneous. So
  much for perception of the present: time and space, as commonly defined, have
  no existence for the clairvoyant. It is not known how the thing works. But we
  know that it does. I know that it does. So do you. So do hundreds of other
  people, of whom some are scientists, some are crazy with religion, and some
  are so mad that they have to be locked up."</p>

  <p>Andrew sat still, studying Bulah Singh's ice-cold fury of concentration.
  The Sikh was long past the stage of excitement. He was letting flow the
  stored-up flood of conviction, which made him feel superior to Andrew, whom
  he suspected of moral cowardice. He wasn't afraid to manipulate mental
  dynamite. Andrew was afraid and would have to be forced. Contempt of Andrew
  as a mere prospective tool of his own higher intelligence blinded him to the
  fact that Andrew's contempt was as hot and living as his own was cold and
  cruel.</p>

  <p>"You seem sold on that stuff," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Sold? Are you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You appear to believe."</p>

  <p>"Believe? I know. I know more. I speak as a professional criminologist.
  Exact facts and statistics are my meat, tools, weapons. You may dismiss doubt
  when I tell you I know scores of instances of clairvoyant reading of the
  past. To my certain knowledge criminals have used it, and crime has been
  detected by the same means. The evidence has been obtained that convicted the
  prisoners. Do you believe it?"</p>

  <p>"Belief is easy," said Andrew. "The trouble with me is that I never
  believe what I believe, if you get my meaning."</p>

  <p>"You're a skeptic, are you? Well, that's in your favor. But listen to
  this. I speak plainly. I know eighteen instances&mdash;I have a record of
  them, fully documented and attested&mdash;of exactly accurate clairvoyant
  reading of the future. The predicted events came to pass exactly as
  clairvoyantly foreseen, in every detail. Now then. Do you see what I'm
  driving at?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Andrew. To have said yes might have stopped the Sikh's self-
  revelation. Not improbably Morgan Lewis might&mdash;</p>

  <p>The Sikh detected the thought. He stood up suddenly and stared down at
  Andrew: "Understand, Andrew Gunning! I don't permit my private conversation
  to be used as gossip. I know how to deal with offenders. Dr. Morgan Lewis is
  a dilettante&mdash;an amateur. He is inquisitive about telepathy. He may ask
  questions about me. If you value your life&mdash;I said life&mdash; did you
  hear me?&mdash;don't answer his questions."</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned into that opening easily, smoothly: "I'd a notion you
  hadn't got me right, Bulah Singh. I make no one-sided bargains&mdash;not if I
  know it. There's only one way you and I can hit it off. Show cards. Make a
  square proposition. If you've something to sell, trot it out and let's look
  at it."</p>

  <p>Forced again on the defensive the Sikh changed his tactics: "I can have
  you arrested."</p>

  <p>"Sure you can. But what for? And can you make it stick?"</p>

  <p>"Spying. I have copies of your correspondence."</p>

  <p>"I know that," said Andrew. "Have you noticed I'm worried about it?"</p>

  <p>"I have a list of all your hide-outs between here and that cave near Shig-
  po-ling where Tom Grayne is waiting for you."</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed: "Hell, you're not offering to sell me that, are you?"</p>

  <p>"I am not selling. I am telling you."</p>

  <p>"Can't you tell it sitting down?"</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh remained standing. His mouth was a symbol of ruthless and now
  reckless greed. Not money greed, but greed for power. He began taking chances
  now:</p>

  <p>"I have what you Americans call the goods on Mu-ni Gam-po. I can use you
  as a means to ruin him, use him as a means to ruin you. I can throw your
  friend Tom Grayne to the wolves by arresting you and seizing the supplies you
  want to take to him. And I can make things very unpleasant for Elsa
  Burbage."</p>

  <p>"But you haven't done it," said Andrew. "Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because I wish you to go to Tibet. I will arrange your escape across the
  border. Someone else, whom I have in mind, shall be blamed for it. I have it
  all thought out. You and Tom Grayne, with or without the co-operation of
  Lobsang Pun and Ambrose St. Malo, shall bring the infant Dalai Lama to India,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And what?"</p>

  <p>"This is important."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you come to the point? Are you scared to say it?"</p>

  <p>"Elsa Burbage will be the hostage for the fulfillment of your bargain with
  me."</p>

  <p>"You've said that already."</p>

  <p>"I have been unable to persuade her to use clairvoyance in connection with
  inquiries I am making."</p>

  <p>"Yeah. She said you asked her to listen in on a third degree or something
  like it. Turned you down, eh? You'll get nowhere along that line. She detests
  clairvoyance."</p>

  <p>The Sikh pointed a finger at Andrew's face and stared along it as if he
  were sighting a gun: "You will change Elsa Burbage's mind about that. You
  will point out to her that your safety, and Tom Grayne's safety, and the
  success of our plan, and her own immunity from&mdash;call it persecution if
  you want to&mdash;depend on her cooperation with me."</p>

  <p>"What kind of cooperation?"</p>

  <p>"She will put her clairvoyance and her telepathic faculty at my disposal
  during the entire period of your absence in Tibet."</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"For my purposes. She will report to me, exactly, in full detail, every
  clairvoyant or telepathic vision she receives. And she will obey me in the
  matter of sending messages at my dictation."</p>

  <p>"And if she refuses?"</p>

  <p>"So much the worse for her and for you and Tom Grayne."</p>

  <p>"So that's it, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And your answer is yes! Or take the consequences! Secrecy, of
  course, is essential. I warn you, I have made all arrangements to stop your
  mouth, and hers, too, forever, if one word of this should leak out."</p>

  <p>An auto horn tooted in the street below the window. Andrew felt relieved.
  The Sikh looked savage. He thrust out his lower jaw and spoke slowly, in a
  level voice:</p>

  <p>"Here comes Morgan Lewis now, with my car. Drop one hint to him of what
  I've said to you and&mdash;well&mdash;take the consequences."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER 10</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was plenty of firelight from the hearth. Nancy Strong
  got up and switched off the electric light. The leaping shadows made the room
  seem smaller and more cozy. In the dimness Nancy Strong looked younger and
  less rugged but even more outwardly calm and inwardly alert. She sat down
  facing Elsa, studied her for a minute or two, then suddenly:</p>

  <p>"Elsa, my dear, the meek shall inherit the earth. They always do. But who
  wants it? The pigs want it. But who else?"</p>

  <p>"Pigs?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Poets create their own world. Pigs can't. The pig in every one of us
  destroys what the poet creates."</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"You and the earth. Pigs and poets. Poet&mdash;you and pig&mdash;you. The
  earth is a synonym for what the Communists and Fascists and economists sell
  their souls and other people's bodies for. That's what you're trying to
  do."</p>

  <p>"Communist? Fascist? Pig? Poet? Me? I don't want the earth. I don't own a
  yard of it. I don't understand you."</p>

  <p>"You will presently. You must get into your head first that meekness and
  humility are opposites. You're meek. You've got to change."</p>

  <p>"How?" asked Elsa.</p>

  <p>"By turning it inside-out and becoming humble."</p>

  <p>"Show me."</p>

  <p>"Humble as Jesus."</p>

  <p>Elsa rebelled instantly. All she needed was something to set her teeth
  into. "I don't like Jesus. Fed up with him. Don't believe in him."</p>

  <p>"You mean you don't want to be crucified."</p>

  <p>Elsa turned that over in her mind for several seconds. Then she said:
  "Nobody wants to be crucified."</p>

  <p>"At the moment you're headed straight for it," said Nancy. "Why do you
  wish to return to Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"Because it feels like the right thing to do, and I can think of nothing
  else to do."</p>

  <p>"Does it feel like running away? Or like going forward?"</p>

  <p>Elsa pondered that for a moment, then answered: "It feels like a
  fight."</p>

  <p>"Against what? Kicking against what St. Paul called the pricks?"</p>

  <p>"Damn St. Paul! I like him even less than Jesus. I'm not the least afraid
  of Tibet. I can endure anything&mdash;anything except the feeling that life's
  meaningless and I'm useless. Perhaps it's me that I'm fighting. I don't know.
  But why should my baby have died? All that agony for nothing &mdash;not that
  the agony mattered one bit, if only something worth while had come of it.
  Waste! Faith, hope, charity&mdash;all wasted!"</p>

  <p>"Whose charity?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew Cunning's."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it!" said Nancy. "If I thought Andrew Gunning really
  guilty of charity I would forbid him the door."</p>

  <p>"You? You of all people?"</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong chuckled: "Yes, I'm a rich hater&mdash;a poor pitier. I
  detest and despise strong hypocrites. There's some excuse for the weak ones.
  Andrew Gunning is strong. But I think he isn't guilty. Do you know any
  Greek?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Some. Forgotten most of it. Why?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Agape</i> is the word that St. Paul used in Thirteenth Corinthians. It
  doesn't mean charity. That was a lazy mistranslation of a word that needs
  thinking about. Charity is sheer insolence. It always begins as an imposition
  on the meek, and it's all that the meek deserve. At first they like it. They
  experience the kind of gratitude that means a craving for more. They suck it
  dry, like ticks on a sick cow. It works both ways. It enlarges the insolence.
  And it makes the recipients greedy&mdash;pig&mdash;meek until it becomes
  old-fashioned slavery and destroys itself, dies of its own corruption, like
  smallpox and degeneracy and any other disgusting thing you can think of
  &mdash;eats itself up."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, I supposed you were a charitable woman."</p>

  <p>"God forbid!"</p>

  <p>"Isn't this school a charity?"</p>

  <p>"Over my dead body! 'Ayarn' [greek script], in the sense that St. Paul
  used the word, means milk of human kindness."</p>

  <p>"What's the difference?"</p>

  <p>"All the difference between plus and minus, good and evil, truth and
  untruth. Charity is sometimes a line of least resistance, sometimes a form of
  social blackmail, sometimes superstition, but never better than a substitute
  for kindness."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you splitting hairs?" Elsa suggested.</p>

  <p>"I've never split a hair, nor lied to a child like you, nor told the truth
  to a fool if I could possibly help it."</p>

  <p>"You're in a strange mood, Nancy. Have I upset you by coming here?"</p>

  <p>"No. Quite the contrary. Put some more wood on the fire."</p>

  <p>Elsa heaped on wood and prodded with the poker until the sparks flew
  upward. She stared at the fire. Nancy Strong waited until she sat down.
  Then:</p>

  <p>"What did you see?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"Don't lie. Time's too precious, Elsa. We have only tonight. Save the lies
  for the hypocrites. Tell me."</p>

  <p>"It didn't mean anything."</p>

  <p>"Never mind what it meant or didn't mean. If I tell you correctly what you
  saw, will you admit it?"</p>

  <p>"Try me. I'm not good at being naked-minded. If I told it, it would sound
  like nonsense."</p>

  <p>"You saw a cavern&mdash;Tom Grayne&mdash;Andrew Gunning&mdash;
  yourself&mdash;two strangers&mdash;and Lobsang Pun, facing one another around
  some loads on the cavern floor."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I saw that. But how do you know?"</p>

  <p>"What did you hear?"</p>

  <p>Elsa stared, hesitating, tense, almost frightened.</p>

  <p>Nancy followed up: "Shall I tell you what you heard?"</p>

  <p>"If you think you know."</p>

  <p>"Lobsang Pun was saying that the sun belongs to everybody; so whoever buys
  its light is a fool, and whoever sells it is a scoundrel."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he was saying that. Nancy! Have you the same affliction I have?"</p>

  <p>"I used to be meek about it, too," Nancy answered.</p>

  <p>"But how could you see my picture? It was just a daydream like the ones I
  get when I'm translating Tibetan."</p>

  <p>"That wasn't a daydream.&mdash;What language was Lobsang Pun using?"</p>

  <p>"None that I recall. I expect it was thought-language. It was real, and at
  the same time unreal."</p>

  <p>"You saw color, form, substance, movement."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Did you smell anything?"</p>

  <p>"Smoke." Elsa glanced at the fire.</p>

  <p>"Child, don't fool yourself. Don't run away from it. Deodar knots don't
  smell like yak-dung."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, were you playing tricks? Are you a hypnotist? Were you making me
  see and hear and smell things?" "No. I don't hypnotize people. That's wicked.
  Can you see what I'm seeing now?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want to."</p>

  <p>"Let yourself look&mdash;to oblige me:"</p>

  <p>"I can't see anything."</p>

  <p>"'Where there is no vision, the people perish'! Look again. What do you
  see?"</p>

  <p>"Nancy, please don't insist. I hate it. Tell me how not to see things.
  Then I'll bless you forever."</p>

  <p>"That," said Nancy Strong, "is what I mean by meekness. It's a nom de
  guerre for the subtlest and deadliest sort of conceit."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know I had any vanity left. I thought it was all gone, along
  with my baby and everything else."</p>

  <p>"Conceit and vanity are opposites," said Nancy Strong. "We can't get along
  without vanity. That's consciousness of what we are and can do. Conceit is
  pretending to be something we're not, or else pretending to be not what we
  are."</p>

  <p>"You seem to be a bigot about definitions."</p>

  <p>"I despise them. But you need prodding with something sharp to make you
  vain and humble. Turn your meekness inside-out!"</p>

  <p>"Is that what you teach children?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, child. It is what experience has taught me."</p>

  <p>Elsa sighed. "Well, let me tell you my side of it, Nancy. I won't whine,
  but I feel like confidences. If you can see things the way I do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know what you're going to say."</p>

  <p>"Will you let me say it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Telling it may help you. Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"I've been clairvoyant ever since I can remember."</p>

  <p>"Most people are, if they only knew it," said Nancy.</p>

  <p>"When I was quite young I was whipped for telling lies, because I said I
  could hear voices, like the Bible people and like Joan of Arc. I did hear
  voices. But I wasn't believed. So I learned to cover up. There were
  governesses and people like that who spied continually and tried to make me
  feel guilty. But there were sometimes months when I wasn't clairvoyant at
  all, and oh, how good those times were! But the times between kept getting
  shorter. So I was known as a problem child. That isn't anything to be vain
  about. It's something to try to forget."</p>

  <p>"What sort of child do you think I was?" Nancy asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;did you get punished? Well, you'll understand at least some of
  it."</p>

  <p>"I will make you understand, too, or else die in my tracks," said Nancy.
  "Go on, tell me."</p>

  <p>Elsa shrugged her shoulders. "Doctors. Psychologists. School-teachers.
  Inquisition, and no end to it. Even the vicar, talking about the Witch of
  Endor and the devils that Jesus cast out of people. And I knew what every one
  of them was going to say before he said it. They were all stupid. Some of
  them were cruel. And some weren't even trying to be honest."</p>

  <p>"Neither were you," said Nancy Strong.</p>

  <p>"I was! I was honest at first. I was even happy about it and felt
  important. But I learned to tell lies later on to protect myself, if that's
  what you mean. Once I was in danger of being certified insane because I said
  the house was going to be broken into by thieves, who would poison the dog
  and steal the silver. Luckily the thieves did it. That saved me. But I was
  heartbroken about the dog. After that I was sent to boarding school. And
  there I was accused of cheating because I sometimes knew the answers without
  having to work them out."</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong chuckled: "How did you try to explain it away?"</p>

  <p>"How could I explain? Sometimes I was perfectly normal, as they called it,
  for weeks at a time. Then I was called stupid and sullen. And when they
  really did begin to be convinced that I could see and hear things
  clairvoyantly it was worse than ever. I was a freak. People tried to make use
  of me, and despised me at the same time. Some people called me a medium. I
  was accused of all sorts of things&mdash;vile things. Boys of my own age
  seemed to think I was a pervert. I was simply pestered by them&mdash;and by
  girls, too. And the decent boys weren't interested in anything but could I
  tell their fortunes? When I got older I couldn't even keep a teacher's job.
  No, Nancy, it's a curse, and it's no use your telling me anything else. With
  the exception of my uncle, Professor Mayor, and Tom, I haven't had one single
  even half-pleasant experience in connection with it. Most of them were
  disgusting, and some were cruel."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about your husband," said Nancy. "What was Tom's reaction to your
  clairvoyance?"</p>

  <p>"Tom calls it second-sight. It annoys him because it isn't
  dependable."</p>

  <p>"Good!" said Nancy.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, good? It was tragic. It came between us. He began to
  get used to my knowing what he was thinking about before he said it. He began
  to expect that and to count on it. So when it didn't work he didn't believe
  me, and when it did work he doubted. He thought I was being temperamental, or
  perhaps critical of him. He began not to trust me so much. Do you call that
  good?"</p>

  <p>"What I meant was that we're getting somewhere. Tell me about Andrew
  Gunning."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to tell. That is, nothing more than you know. Andrew
  keeps his thoughts to himself, and he knows how to mask them as a general
  rule. He carves little wooden images that he gives to people who appreciate
  them, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong glanced at the mantelpiece, where smiled a six-inch wooden
  statuette of the Lord Buddha. It vaguely suggested a portrait of Nancy
  herself.</p>

  <p>"Oh, is that one of Andrew's? So it is&mdash;I remember when he did it.
  Well, he does that kind of thing; and reads books; and gets furiously angry
  when he's thanked for being unselfish and kinder than anyone ever dreamed a
  man could be. That's almost all I know about Andrew, except that he saved my
  life when my baby was born, and I sometimes wish he hadn't. I believe he
  hates me, but he's too generous to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nancy interrupted: "What is your vision of Andrew? Quick! Out with it!
  Don't pretty it up!"</p>

  <p>"A man in the snow, leaning against the wind, leading&mdash;
  leading&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Does he ever talk to you about clairvoyance?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly ever. He's too considerate. He knows I don't like it."</p>

  <p>"Does he ever ask you to see things for him?"</p>

  <p>"Never. He never asks anyone to do anything for him. He gives orders, when
  those are necessary. But he never asks favors. Even when we had to stay at
  Tibetan monasteries, he always found some way of making the monks feel that
  it was we who did them the favor. It was the same in the villages we passed
  through."</p>

  <p>"We're getting somewhere again," said Nancy Strong. "Now&mdash;are you
  ready to listen to me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. This time I'll try not to interrupt. I only wanted you to understand
  before you begin. But please don't ask me to see and hear things. I won't do
  it. I will go back, and keep my bargain with Tom, but I won't do it for
  anyone else."</p>

  <p>The telephone rang. Nancy Strong went into another room to answer it,
  behind two closed doors. She was gone a long time. Elsa sat curled in the
  armchair, staring at the fire, seeing&mdash;seeing&mdash;past, present and
  future, all mixed up in one connected movement that obeyed no laws of time
  and space, but was intelligible. Dr. Morgan Lewis wasn't in the picture at
  first. But it concerned him. He was there. And when she thought of him she
  saw him, clairvoyantly, monocle and all, smiling, excited, talking to someone
  whom she couldn't see. But she knew whom he was talking about.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER 11</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dr. Morgan Lewis knocked twice. He gave Andrew and the Chief
  of Police plenty of time to assume such poses as they pleased before he
  walked in. He even turned his back toward them as he closed the door. As he
  stood wiping his monocle on his handkerchief he looked disarmingly
  unmelodramatic, mild, harmless&mdash;possibly even slightly bored by
  professional duties.</p>

  <p>"It's raining like the devil," he remarked. He adjusted his monocle.
  "Thanks for the use of the car, Bulah Singh. It's outside. I told the driver
  to wait for you."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh wasn't deceived. Darkly alert, he vaguely overplayed
  casualness. "You've been quick," he observed. "Wasn't the consultation
  serious?"</p>

  <p>"The man's dead," Lewis answered. "Poison. You'll get a report."</p>

  <p>"Oh? Murder?"</p>

  <p>Lewis nodded: "You'll say suicide."</p>

  <p>"What do you say?" the Sikh asked.</p>

  <p>Lewis stared at him: "Between us three and the four, walls&mdash;murder,
  yes. But who's to prove it?"</p>

  <p>"Autopsy, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, first thing tomorrow. You know the man. He was in jail not long ago.
  A Japanese."</p>

  <p>Andrew did a better job of masking alertness than the Sikh did; he left
  off scraping out his pipe and looked mildly interested, whereas Bulah Singh's
  air of indifference was overdone:</p>

  <p>"Not the tea-buyer&mdash;let me see, what was his name?"</p>

  <p>"Koki Konoe," said Lewis, a bit dryly, a bit abruptly.</p>

  <p>"A spy," said the Chief of Police. "I remember. He was detained for
  investigation. We couldn't prove anything."</p>

  <p>"It will be even harder to prove," said Lewis, "that someone killed him by
  making him take his own life."</p>

  <p>The Sikh raised his eyebrows: "Suggestion? You don't mean to say&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Lewis. "But whose?" He was staring hard at the Sikh, who was
  at pains to look skeptical and slightly scornfully amused.</p>

  <p>"Koki Konoe was a pretty good suggester himself," Bulah Singh answered.
  "If you should ask me, I would call him a first-class hypnotist.
  But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lewis corrected him: "Third class. Not too good at that, or he wouldn't
  have lost the duel."</p>

  <p>"Duel?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, duel. Between duffers. The real experts are rare and not so easy to
  detect." He turned toward Andrew. "What did you know about Koki Konoe?"</p>

  <p>The Sikh lighted a cigarette, watching Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Andrew. He was watching the Sikh. The Sikh smiled.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you meet him&mdash;talk with him?" asked Lewis. "Someone told me
  you did."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I met him."</p>

  <p>"Tell us what happened."</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Andrew. "He was here in the hotel, one afternoon. I picked
  up an English newspaper from a chair in the lobby. He got in conversation by
  asking for the paper as soon as I'd be through with it."</p>

  <p>"What did he talk about?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing much. He talked like a man with a bad hangover. I got the
  impression that he was trying hard to cling to a fading intelligence."</p>

  <p>"Very shrewd guess on your part," said Lewis. "What did he talk
  about?"</p>

  <p>"It's a pretty good rule, isn't it, not to tell what people talk about,
  until you know why you're asked," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's safe," said Lewis, "sometimes."</p>

  <p>The Sikh smiled and corrected him: "Always." He made a gesture with his
  cigarette. He and Lewis stared at each other. Andrew watched both of them.
  The Sikh's eyes met Andrew's. Lewis dropped his monocle into the palm of his
  hand and slipped it into his vest pocket.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Bulah Singh, "it's getting late. I'll be off. Corpse at the
  mortuary?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;probably there by now. Both doctors refused to sign the death
  certificate, and I concurred, so they phoned the police."</p>

  <p>"I'll look into it," said Bulah Singh.</p>

  <p>"You'll find it interesting," said Lewis. "Thanks again for the use of
  your car."</p>

  <p>"Don't mention it. See you tomorrow. So long."</p>

  <p>The Sikh walked out. Lewis almost ran across the room: "The phone's in
  your bedroom?" He closed the bedroom door behind him and was in there several
  minutes. When he came back he sat down facing Andrew. He was smiling as if
  well pleased by the phone conversation. He declined Andrew's gestured
  invitation to help himself to whiskey.</p>

  <p>"Now, young man, out with it!"</p>

  <p>"Out with what?"</p>

  <p>"There are no witnesses. It's between you and me and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted: "No, no. Easy on that stuff. You'll have to employ
  your regular spies if you want&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Gunning, I want confidential information. And I also propose to help you.
  Don't regard it as a business bargain. Think of me as your doctor. You know
  the rule: always tell your doctor and your lawyer everything."</p>

  <p>Andrew shook his head: "Work in a criminal law office taught me such
  contempt for squawkers and anonymous informers that I'm leery of becoming
  one." He grinned genially. "Besides, it was an accepted fact in our office
  that you can always find a doctor to swear to anything, one side or the
  other, depending on who pays him."</p>

  <p>Lewis raised his eyebrows: "Do you feel more at ease, now that you've
  fired that barrel? Fire the other one about 'choose your specialist, choose
  your disease,' and get that off your conscience. Then we'll talk."</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned again: "You get what I'm driving at, don't you? I've
  nothing to sell."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't buy, if you had. I'm inviting your confidence," said
  Lewis.</p>

  <p>"How about yours?" Andrew retorted. "Talking to you is one thing.
  Squawking to a bureau is another."</p>

  <p>"Very well, let's make it personal," said Lewis. "This is between you and
  me and we'll keep it that way. I knew the Japanese was dead before I left you
  with Bulah Singh. I hoped Bulah Singh would talk."</p>

  <p>"He did."</p>

  <p>"I want to know what he said."</p>

  <p>"Is it understood and agreed that I'm not squawking for protection, or any
  rot like that?"</p>

  <p>"Understood."</p>

  <p>"And I won't be made a party to any local intrigue?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. That's a promise. Now then, what did he say?"</p>

  <p>"Well, just before you came in, he said he's all set to kill me if I
  repeat to anyone what we talked about."</p>

  <p>"Did he mention names?"</p>

  <p>"In that connection yours was the only name that he did mention."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Lewis. "I suppose the rest of it concerned you and Tibet
  and Tom Grayne."</p>

  <p>"Most of it did. He offered to ease me across the frontier&mdash;on
  terms."</p>

  <p>"Wants you, I suppose, to bring the infant Dalai Lama to Darjeeling?"</p>

  <p>"Right&mdash;first shot. You seem to know your stuff! How did you figure
  that out?"</p>

  <p>Lewis laughed. "It took more shots than a hundred to bring down that bird!
  Bulah Singh has inflated ambitions. He is a student of ambitions. He knows
  almost by heart the case histories of at least ten men who have attained
  power by Machiavellian means&mdash;Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler,
  Mustapha Kemal, several South American dictators. Those men all started from
  scratch, so why shouldn't he? I wish you could see his library. What escapes
  Bulah Singh is the fact that there are ten thousand failures for one success
  in that field. He overlooks such elements as luck, time, place and
  competition. He realized, quite a number of years ago, that an Indian police
  officer, who plays to the gallery, presently lands in the discard. So he
  studied clandestine methods of becoming influential. He has been burrowing so
  hard underground and so far afield that Japan got news of it. Japan sent Koki
  Konoe to Darjeeling to uncover Bulah Singh's game while pretending to buy
  tea. Tell me about Koki Konoe. What happened between him and you, here in the
  hotel?"</p>

  <p>"Darned little happened, because I spotted him as a hot wire first go
  off," said Andrew. "He planted a copy of the London Times in a chair in the
  lobby. I took the bait deliberately. When we got in conversation he drew my
  attention to a piece on an inside page about the medical use of hypnotism. On
  the next page there was a silly season letter from a retired Colonel who said
  he'd seen the rope trick done in India, and photographed it, and found
  nothing on the plate. Said that was proof of mass-hypnotism."</p>

  <p>"So it was," said Lewis. "But go ahead. What happened between you and Koki
  Konoe?"</p>

  <p>"Well, after a bit of talk Koki Konoe gave me his card, with a Darjeeling
  address in pencil. He remarked he was lonely and needed someone to talk with.
  He kept the conversation going on the subject of hypnotism, until at last I
  showed some interest just to find out what his game was. He invited me to
  come and see him&mdash;said he'd show me how it's done. Said he'd teach me
  some jujitsu, too, if I was interested."</p>

  <p>"You didn't accept the invitation?"</p>

  <p>"No. I was good and wise to him by that time. Jujitsu might be up my
  street, but not hypnotism. I've seen 'em work it in Shanghai, in
  combination."</p>

  <p>"Jujitsu," Lewis interrupted, "is a form of philosophy as well as being a
  system of physical combat."</p>

  <p>"You bet it is. Say, those bozos can give you a physical-mental workout
  and put you to sleep and make you tell your whole past history plus anything
  else that you happen to know. They can even make you write it down and sign
  it."</p>

  <p>"If you're ignorant, or afraid, or if your will is stronger than your
  judgment, they can do that without putting you to sleep," said Lewis.
  "Hypnotism was misnamed due to a misunderstanding of its nature. Hypnos means
  sleep. But hypnotism isn't a form of sleep. Sleep is a by-product&mdash;
  sometimes. Did you feel any pressure from Koki Konoe?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, sure. Something like the impulse that a high-pressure salesman stirs
  up. Professional gamblers are good at the same thing. So are soma kinds of
  women. They make you sell yourself. But I know that trick. And he wasn't more
  than half powered anyhow. So I bought him a drink and walked out on him.
  Dead, is he? Have you a guess who killed him?"</p>

  <p>"Mine may be as good as anybody's guess," said Lewis. "Koki Konoe was sent
  from Japan to check up among other things on Bulah Singh's negotiations with
  Ambrose St. Malo."</p>

  <p>"So I guessed right? You do know St. Malo?"</p>

  <p>"St. Malo and Bulah Singh&mdash;have been in correspondence for a long
  time."</p>

  <p>"St. Malo is in Tibet," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Yes. But they corresponded until recently by way of China, making use of
  third-class passengers on liners, some of it by word of mouth, some in
  writing, and some by underlining words in books and magazines."</p>

  <p>"Gosh! St. Malo must have long lines out. That game costs money."</p>

  <p>"Lots of it. He is spending Japanese and Russian money. But he will sell
  out of course to the highest bidder in sight at any critical moment."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, what could Bulah Singh bid? He can't get hold of money,
  can he?"</p>

  <p>"No, no. Bulah Singh has no money. He is a student of psychology who
  thinks he knows more than he does. But he knows some of the rudiments. He
  understands, for instance, that such a man as St. Malo, who is a crooked
  gambler going after big bait, can always be taken with small bait if he's
  stampeded and tempted at the right time. Probably you are the small bait
  &mdash;you and Tom Grayne. I think St. Malo has been told you're coming and
  counts on using you in Tibet; and that Bulah Singh depends on you to force
  St. Malo's hand. But we'll get to that later. Let's stick to Koki Konoe for
  the moment. We knew all about him from our agent in Japan. We had him
  arrested. Our Indian jails are very well conducted nowadays. Even a Chief of
  Police can't interview a prisoner alone, except at the prisoner's own
  request."</p>

  <p>"In that case there's no witness?"</p>

  <p>"Theoretically none, within hearing. Both of them counted on that. But
  there's such a thing as a hole in a wall."</p>

  <p>"Dictaphones, too, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Those things are expensive and sometimes inconvenient," said Lewis. "Koki
  Konoe made the request, so Bulah Singh visited him in the jail. Neither
  understood the other's language. They had to talk English. We have a full
  stenographic report of their conversation. Koki Konoe warned Bujah Singh that
  if he didn't let Tibet alone and drop his intrigue with St. Malo, he'd be
  liquidated."</p>

  <p>"Murdered?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't say. He left the suggestion to do its own work. On the surface
  it probably meant that the Jap secret service would betray Bulah Singh to us.
  That would be the commonplace procedure. But there was an unspoken threat of
  murder."</p>

  <p>"If you know all this, why don't you arrest Bulah Singh?"</p>

  <p>"For several reasons. The least of them is that we lack proof of where
  Koki Konoe got the poison that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted: "Don't those fellows usually roll their own? I mean,
  don't they carry it, just in case? I've heard that all the Japs do it"</p>

  <p>"Yes, some do, when the job's specially dangerous. But it's usually
  cyanide. And this wasn't a particularly dangerous job on the face of it.
  Besides, he was searched thoroughly at the time of arrest. No poison on
  him."</p>

  <p>"What stuff killed him?"</p>

  <p>"One of five Tibetan poisons that aren't in the pharmacopoeia. Two are
  sudden death, quicker than cyanide. One contracts all the muscles and kills
  in an hour by strangulation. One makes 'em blind and they die painfully in
  about a week from inflammation of the inner molecular layer followed by an
  obscure but sudden action on the brain. The fifth kills more slowly&mdash;
  about thirty days as a rule&mdash;by direct action on the cerebral cortex.
  The victim goes mad&mdash;reverses things&mdash;tells his secrets and makes
  secrets of trivialities. That was the stuff that killed him. That's why I was
  sent for."</p>

  <p>"You got here after he was dead?"</p>

  <p>"Between you and me, no. Secretly I have been here two days."</p>

  <p>"Trying to track poison? There are lots of Tibetans in Darjeeling," said
  Andrew. "Koki Konoe could have bought the stuff."</p>

  <p>"But why should he?"</p>

  <p>"Scared."</p>

  <p>"Of what?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps of Bulah Singh."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. But how did Bulah Singh frighten a terrorist expert?"</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed sourly: "Any man who knows the first thing about jujitsu
  should be able to answer that one. Shakespeare called it hoisting 'em with
  their own petard. The Jap's stuff got used against him. Look at it this way:
  Bulah Singh threatened me just now with death, if I do any talking. It
  happens I wasn't scared, so his stuff didn't work, although he convinced me
  he meant it. Koki Konoe, on the other hand, was scared stiff. Bulah Singh
  probably took advantage of that and stampeded him into&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rudimentary, but as far as it goes, right," said Lewis. "Almost as much
  nonsense is talked about hypnotism, by responsible men who should know
  better, as about clairvoyance and telepathy. The common charlatans and
  malignant agitators know more about hypnotism than almost any of the
  so-called authorities even pretend to know. I could name the exceptions on
  the fingers of one hand. Science is afraid of it, although it has been
  successfully used in severe mental cases, and even to produce surgical
  anesthesia. But repeated attempts to use it, especially in France, have led
  to scandal and recrimination. Hypnotism, like clairvoyance and telepathy, is
  an almost unexplored field that reputable men mistrust because of the
  inevitable reaction on themselves. But they're coming around nowadays to a
  cautious admission that Mesmer may after all have been on the right track
  with his theory of some kind of magnetic fluid passing from one person to
  another."</p>

  <p>"What do you think about it?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tell you," said Lewis, "between these four walls. I've a
  reason for telling. You mustn't quote me."</p>

  <p>"Okay."</p>

  <p>"You know the old proverb that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
  Very well. Bulah Singh is a dangerous hypnotist because he has a little
  knowledge. He's a conceited amateur, who considers himself a professional
  expert. The same was true of Koki Konoe, who was trained by the Japanese
  secret service. All secret services use it to some extent. The Japs use it a
  lot, at great personal risk because of their morbid tendency to suicide. The
  thing is a boomerang. The malicious use of hypnotism&mdash;as any experienced
  metaphysician knows&mdash;is always&mdash;not sometimes, but always
  associated with the idea of death. Koki Konoe and Bulah Singh used it against
  each other, with all possible malice. Most of us use it unconsciously,
  without much malice and without concentration, in much the same way that we
  use our other unconscious faculties."</p>

  <p>"D'you mean, for instance, that I use it?" Andrew retorted. "See here,
  barring getting what I pay for in the way of plain obedience from men who
  hire me the use of their time, I'm almost fanatical about leaving other folks
  to do their own thinking."</p>

  <p>"That's why I find it worth while talking to you," Lewis answered. "If
  you'll listen, I think you'll learn something you can use to good advantage.
  The secret of hypnotism&mdash;and it still is an unfathomed secret&mdash;
  resides in the ether, which fills all physical space and permeates all
  physical matter."</p>

  <p>"Aristotle's ether? I thought that was an exploded theory."</p>

  <p>"It was. But it no longer is," said Lewis. "We're returning to it. The
  existence of the ether has been mathematically and photographically proved
  &mdash;quite recently, by two young American scientists. We exist in the
  ether as fish exist in water. The whole physical, phenomenal universe exists
  in it. We don't know what its properties are. We think, hate, love, crave,
  envy&mdash;without knowing what we're doing with waves of imperceptible but
  prodigious etheric energy that the act of thinking causes more or less to
  concentrate and so to speak change direction. Does that mean anything to you?
  Perhaps thought&mdash;not brain, you understand, but thought&mdash;is
  something like a prism."</p>

  <p>"You mean hypnosis is a force conveyed by or through the ether?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. It's a dark subject. I have studied it, here in India, in the
  very home of hypnotism, for more than twenty-five years, and I confess that I
  don't know. But I do know it's the most powerful and dangerous force in the
  world, and that it's deliberately and constantly being used by people who no
  more know what it is than a dog knows what geometry is. Hitler, Mussolini,
  Goebbels, all use it. It'll boomerang them sooner or later. One of its
  camouflage names is suggestion. Other names are the evil eye, black magic,
  malicious animal magnetism, voodoo. It has dozens of names and pseudonyms.
  Propaganda is one of its milder uses. So-called self-hypnosis is one of its
  common results. It's the secret of all slavery of every kind whatever; of all
  subjection of one to another. It's the underlying cause of war, and of nearly
  all disease, poverty, misery, and injustice. Every effort to control or
  modify it is a vector that merely shifts the velocity."</p>

  <p>"Bit of an alarmist, aren't you?" said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," Lewis answered. "But I'm not an ostrich. Burying one's
  head in the sand of statistical facts is no more a protection against
  hypnotism&mdash;mass and personal&mdash;than it is against day and
  night."</p>

  <p>"But you figure you know the answer?" Andrew didn't try to look anything
  but skeptical. He was wearing his obstinate grin, with his eyebrows lowered.
  "What is it? If you know, why not tell?"</p>

  <p>"The answer," said Lewis, "is spiritual. It has been well told quite a
  number of times."</p>

  <p>"You mean religion? Whose religion?"</p>

  <p>"Any religion," said Lewis, "that isn't ecclesiastical and consequently
  based on mob-psychology. I'm not denouncing the regular repetition of words
  and songs. Those serve their purpose. They're about as useful as a bedside
  manner during diagnosis."</p>

  <p>"Well then, what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean the kind of education that Nancy Strong's pupils get."</p>

  <p>Andrew whistled softly. He thought a moment. "Nancy," he said, "could pull
  the bung out of a barrel of Sphinxes and make 'em all tell what they forgot
  ten thousand years ago. What's more, they'd like doing it. But&mdash;isn't
  she one of your hot wires?"</p>

  <p>Lewis ignored the question. "She is the only genuine Christian I know," he
  remarked. "I don't doubt there are lots of others, but I haven't met
  them."</p>

  <p>"I would never have guessed you're a religious man," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"I'm a realist," said Lewis. "I don't believe in ignoring facts because
  they're metaphysical, or in letting the material tail wag the spiritual dog.
  I investigate facts to discover the truth about them."</p>

  <p>"That's what Bulah Singh claims he does."</p>

  <p>"But I simultaneously believe in the teachings of Jesus Christ," said
  Lewis. "Bulah Singh doesn't."</p>

  <p>"Why should he?" said Andrew. "I'd hate to admit I agree with Bulah Singh
  about anything worth mentioning, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lewis suddenly changed the subject: "Hasn't Bulah Singh designs on Elsa
  Burbage?"</p>

  <p>"He sure has," said Andrew. "He wants her here in Darjeeling. That was one
  of his conditions. But what has Jesus to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Did he say why he wants her here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. As a hostage for my behavior in Tibet:"</p>

  <p>"Nothing else?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Clairvoyance. Telepathy."</p>

  <p>Lewis laughed dryly. "I thought so. That's why I sent her to Nancy Strong.
  If Bulah Singh had a chance, he'd hypnotize her."</p>

  <p>"He'll not get the chance. You needn't worry on that score," said Andrew.
  "But if he had her alone, do you think he could do it? Elsa's in a strange
  mood at the moment. She's good stuff. She's more intelligent than&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lewis laughed again. "Gunning, my boy, the more intelligent they are, and
  the stronger-willed they are, the easier they are, unless they know the
  answer. Bulah Singh made Koki Konoe kill himself."</p>

  <p>"It beats me how he did it, or how you know he did it."</p>

  <p>"The easiest victims," said Lewis, "are the intuitive, inspirational
  people. If they're unsuspicious and good-natured, so much the worse, because
  then they are more sensitive to impulse. It induces in them extremes of
  uncritical and unbalanced altruism. It produces our familiar friend the wish-
  fulfillment complex. It drives some of them mad. The next easiest are the
  criminals who themselves dabble in hypnotism. It isn't difficult to
  understand how their stuff gets turned against them."</p>

  <p>"Tell it. I'll try to follow you," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>Lewis thought for a moment. "Perhaps a guess might help. Did Bulah Singh
  suggest to you that he knows something discreditable about your past in the
  United States?"</p>

  <p>Andrew looked startled. "Yes, he did."</p>

  <p>"Did he try to work up fear on that account?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But it didn't come off."</p>

  <p>"Did he suggest by any chance that he could make a scandal about you and
  Elsa Burbage?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Damn him."</p>

  <p>"And perhaps that he could starve Tom Grayne in Tibet by obstructing
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He said that too. But how do you know?"</p>

  <p>"After that, he made his proposal?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, now let's consider Koki Konoe. He was the criminal-hypnotist type.
  Bulah Singh, who knows his job as a policeman tolerably well, learned that
  Koki Konoe had a Hindu mistress. She stole, and delivered to the proper
  person, very embarrassing proof that Koki Konoe was lining his own pocket at
  Japan's expense. Buying tea&mdash;rigging the figures. So Bulah Singh
  introduced the fear element into Koki Konoe's thought by dropping a hint
  about what he knew about that Hindu mistress and the financial trickery. Fear
  of humiliation is stronger than fear of death, in the Japanese
  consciousness."</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;but where did the poison come in?"</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh gave that to Koki Konoe, for the alleged purpose of poisoning
  the Hindu mistress. Do you see the subtlety of that? Having planted the
  fear-suggestion, he excited the fear by pretending to supply a death-dealing
  remedy. But he simultaneously sent the Hindu mistress into hiding. Koki Konoe
  couldn't find her and so felt sure she had betrayed him. In that way Bulah
  Singh again increased the fear element. Koki Konoe, remember, had hinted, in
  jail, that Bulah Singh, might be murdered unless he did as he was told. So
  the idea of death, as a possible outcome of the conflict, was in Koki Konoe's
  mind in the beginning, even before Bulah Singh pretended to help him to
  murder the faithless woman. One good scare after that was enough. The death
  idea became a boomerang. Bulah Singh told Koki Konoe that the woman actually
  had betrayed him, and had then died of poison. Koki Konoe would be accused of
  having murdered her. All lies. But the suggestion, played up by a hypnotist,
  worked. Koki Konoe swallowed the poison."</p>

  <p>"You seem darned cocksure about it," said Andrew. "How do you know all
  this?"</p>

  <p>"Think it over," said Lewis. "How did I know that Elsa Burbage was ill in
  Darjeeling?"</p>

  <p>"So you're clairvoyant?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes," said Lewis. "The difficulty is to prove what I intuitively
  know."</p>

  <p>"Is Bulah Singh clairvoyant?"</p>

  <p>"Not he. Perhaps he once was. But not nowadays. My discoveries,
  rudimentary though they are, have led me to believe that hypnotism and
  clairvoyance are almost mutually exclusive. Tentatively I define clairvoyance
  as release from hypnosis. The contrary appears to be equally true: hypnosis
  blanks out clairvoyance, so that a hypnotist loses his own vision. If I'm
  right about that, it would account for the phenomenal rise to power, and
  equally phenomenal fall of any number of people&mdash;especially of the
  criminal type. However, a hypnotist, shut off from clairvoyance&mdash;that is
  to say from vision&mdash;by his own thought process, nevertheless can
  hypnotize an unsuspecting clairvoyant. By that means he can learn what he
  couldn't possibly clairvoyantly see for himself. It is very frequently done.
  It is one of the means by which such astonishing confessions are extorted in
  Russia. Bulah Singh has been privately experimenting along that line for a
  number of years."</p>

  <p>"Good God, why don't you chain that guy up?" said Andrew. "Chuck him in
  the clink and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lewis laughed. "Gunning, my boy, you know enough criminal law to answer
  that one."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I guess you can't convict a man of hypnotism. Courts would laugh at
  you."</p>

  <p>"Experienced judges wouldn't laugh," said Lewis. "Especially here in
  India. They know better. But they'd have to demand legal evidence, which
  would be impossible to produce. Did Bulah Singh frighten you at all? Did he
  set up any interior worry?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure he didn't?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"That's good." Lewis checked a flicker that would have become a smile if
  he had let it. "And now a personal matter. Would you care to tell me in
  confidence what occurred that induced you to leave the United States?"</p>

  <p>"No. I never discuss that."</p>

  <p>"Very well. But will you answer this? What is the state of affairs between
  you and Elsa Burbage?"</p>

  <p>"She's Tom Grayne's wife."</p>

  <p>"You're a moralist, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Some. I don't go around bragging about it."</p>

  <p>"It would shock you to be made the butt of a humiliating scandal about
  another man's wife?"</p>

  <p>"I'd be troubled on her account."</p>

  <p>"To avoid that&mdash;I mean, to save her from embarrassment&mdash;and
  especially if she should urge you&mdash;could you steer quite a different
  course than the one you have in mind at the moment?"</p>

  <p>"Guess so. I could change plans at a moment's notice, if&mdash;but what
  are you driving at?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't Bulah Singh suggest a drastic change in your Tibetan plan?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Didn't he hint at what might happen if you refuse?"</p>

  <p>"He sure did&mdash;he even used the word persecution."</p>

  <p>"And suggested that he knows about you something that you'd rather not
  discuss?"</p>

  <p>Andrew nodded. Lewis adjusted his monocle. "You begin to understand his
  method?" He was silent for a moment. Then suddenly: "There are a number of
  reasons why we don't, at the moment, choose to remove Bulah Singh."</p>

  <p>"Giving him more rope to hang himself?"</p>

  <p>"We have our eye on him," said Lewis. "I frightened him purposely just now
  by talking about Koki Konoe."</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess you know your business. But why scare him? Won't he cover
  his tracks?"</p>

  <p>"No. They are covered. He will try to uncover mine," said Lewis. "And he
  may perhaps hasten his arrangements&mdash;may step things up a bit. I believe
  you will find Bulah Singh at Nancy Strong's house."</p>

  <p>"But it's after midnight."</p>

  <p>"That's nothing. Nancy's a night owl."</p>

  <p>"Say&mdash;d'you suppose Bulah Singh knows Elsa isn't at the
  monastery?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly he knows," said Lewis. "He is watching me like a cat. Why do
  you suppose I went to all that trouble to lay a smoke-screen, if not to make
  him think he is outwitting me?"</p>

  <p>"I wish we had left Elsa in the monastery," said Andrew. "She was safe
  there."</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh couldn't have got at her there," Lewis answered. "I want her
  got at! I phoned Nancy just now to expect him. I feel sure that's where he
  went."</p>

  <p>"You don't say." Andrew got up, hesitated from politeness, and then hinted
  bluntly: "Where are you staying tonight?"</p>

  <p>Lewis laughed: "Here in your bedroom. May I? There are two beds. I may
  turn in. I'm a bit tired."</p>

  <p>"You'll find all you need in the bureau drawer," said Andrew. "Help
  yourself. It's a long walk to Nancy's and no taxi at this time of night. I'll
  get going."</p>

  <p>"I advise you to take that boot with you. It might cause complications if
  you leave it"</p>

  <p>Andrew picked up Elsa's boot and tucked it under his arm.</p>

  <p>"Careful!" said Lewis. "No breach of confidences! And above all, no
  explosions!"</p>

  <p>"Okay."</p>

  <p>"You don't look like a dove or a serpent, Gunning, my boy. But try to be
  as harmless as the one and as wise as the other."</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed: "What d'you take me for? A zoo?"</p>

  <p>"Emulate one of its inmates! Be observant but inarticulate. Coo, hiss,
  roar&mdash;but don't interpret the noises."</p>

  <p>"Okay. So long."</p>

  <p>"So long. Good night. I'll lock the door," said Lewis.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">CHAPTER 12</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Nancy Strong returned into the room, took the large
  photograph of Lobsang Pun in its silver frame from the small square table and
  set it on one of the armchairs in full firelight, facing Elsa. It was an
  ageless face, almost incredibly wrinkled, apparently not dark-skinned, but
  weathered. Beneath a lama's peaked hood, roguish Chinese-looking wise eyes
  gazed straight forward, seeming to see everything but to tell nothing. The
  nose suggested an eagle's beak. The eyes combined a bird's bright
  far-sightedness and a cat's experienced incredulity; they were unconquerable
  eyes, interested, amused, unafraid. The portrait stirred memories that poured
  as daydreams into Elsa's thought. Nancy Strong interrupted:</p>

  <p>"You recognize him?"</p>

  <p>Elsa came out of reverie: "Of course. Who could forget him? But why
  Lobsang Pun so suddenly? Don't you want me to know that Dr. Lewis phoned you
  about me?"</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you think about Lobsang Pun."</p>

  <p>"You don't want to talk about Dr. Lewis? Oh, very well. But, Nancy, what
  difference can it make what I think about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you think about Lobsang Pun. Look straight at his portrait
  and tell me. I want to know."</p>

  <p>Elsa stared at the portrait. "I don't understand him. I never did. He's an
  enigma. Tom likes him better than I do. He struck me as a tremendously
  powerful personality, but scornful and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Scornful of what?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Scornful and decidedly cruel."</p>

  <p>"Was he cruel to you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He was kind on several occasions, and almost courteous in his own
  high-handed way, but he could be as brusque as a gust of wind. He said
  astonishing things in broken English. He made me feel I was being laughed at.
  But I couldn't help liking him, most of the time. Yes. I like him."</p>

  <p>"Did he laugh at, or with you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. He laughed. He seemed to me cruel, and as ruthless as he is
  ugly to look at. He seemed to have no feeling of obligation or gratitude.
  After Tom had helped him to seize the Thunder Dragon Gate&mdash;and mind you,
  Tom took tremendous chances&mdash;he turned Tom and me out to shift for
  ourselves. Gave us no help whatever, beyond replenishing our supplies and
  exchanging some fresh ponies for our exhausted ones. I should say Lobsang Pun
  is a hugely intelligent and very dangerous man, who doesn't care twopence
  whose toes get trodden on when he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong interrupted: "Elsa, my dear, for nine years I was that man's
  chela."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>chela</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a disciple, a servant.
  <i><a href=
  "http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/etgloss/cha-chy.htm">Encyclopedic
  Theosophical Glossary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"You? You, Nancy, a chela? You mean Lobsang Pun is a&mdash;then you
  are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He is my teacher. I lived with him for nine years on terms of the closest
  possible spiritual intimacy. I have wandered with him all over Tibet, and
  into China. I was with him in Peking, Tokyo and Seoul. This school was his
  doing. He ordered it."</p>

  <p>"You mean it's Lobsang Pun's school?"</p>

  <p>"No, no. Nothing like that. It's my school. As you remarked, he is
  ruthless. But I don't think you know what ruthless means. Scornful, but you
  don't know what of. He despises the conceit of fools who think their brains
  are the boundaries of wisdom, and that what their brains can't define can't
  possibly be true. I told him one day in Lhasa that I believed I could teach
  children what he had been teaching me. He said: go the Darjeeling and do it.
  [sic] It seemed impossible. I hadn't a rupee. But he told me to get out and
  go to Darjeeling and use my vision, instead of being afraid of myself, like a
  devil looking at its own reflection in a dirty mirror. He was ruthless. He
  wouldn't listen to my pleading for advice and help. He drove me away. It
  would take too long to tell you how I reached Darjeeling. But when I got here
  there was money in the bank, waiting for me."</p>

  <p>"Whose money?"</p>

  <p>"The money belonging to me and the children who were to come to my school
  and be waked up. Coin of the realm&mdash;good legal currency. Fools refuse to
  realize that one of the dimensions of every real idea is affluence. I was a
  fool, and afraid. But he wasn't. The money came quite naturally through
  business channels. All I had to do was sign a legal document. But it wouldn't
  have come; that money would have gone to someone else; it would never have
  entered my consciousness if I had disobeyed because of what I used to believe
  before I met Lobsang Pun."</p>

  <p>"It sounds like a miracle, the way you tell it," said Elsa. "I used to
  believe in miracles. I've read Mrs. Eddy's books and some of Madame
  Blavatsky's. I believed in the loaves and fishes, and Elijah and the ravens
  &mdash;and even Lazarus, and the Resurrection. Honestly I did. I thought it
  was a miracle when Tom met me in the British Museum and offered me the chance
  to come to India. It seemed to be an answer to prayer. But now I don't
  believe, and I don't pray any more. I wish I did. Credulous people are better
  off."</p>

  <p>"So you prefer conceit to credulity? God won't come into your trap, so you
  don't believe in God. Is that it?"</p>

  <p>"Nancy, please explain what you mean. I don't feel conceited. Not meek
  either. I feel resentful, and bitter, and wish I didn't."</p>

  <p>"You're in danger of becoming a convinced and self-convicted fool,
  imprisoned in fear."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, I don't feel afraid. Really I don't. I'm willing to face anything
  except&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Except the key of the prison. And the open door. And life&mdash;faith
  &mdash;hope&mdash;courage!"</p>

  <p>"Nancy, I have got courage. I'm just disillusioned, that's all. Life looks
  hideous."</p>

  <p>"Would you call Lobsang Pun beautiful?"</p>

  <p>Elsa laughed: "He's almost comically ugly. He must be almost the ugliest
  man in the world. Even his Tibetan servants used to refer to him as Old Ugly-
  face."</p>

  <p>"Lobsang Pun's face is as ugly as the surface of life," Nancy Strong
  answered. "But look beneath the surface. I learned from that man all the
  faith that's in me and all that I know about beauty, truth, kindness,
  affluence and nowness, as dimensions of ideas."</p>

  <p>"Dimensions? Of ideas?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Every genuine idea that ever was, or is, or will be, has all those
  dimensions, along with lots of others."</p>

  <p>"But, Nancy, how can you talk such nonsense? How can an idea have
  dimensions? You can't conceive of a long or a short idea."</p>

  <p>"Of course not. True dimensions are not boundaries or limitations. Space
  and time are like a frame that we look through. An idea hasn't time and
  space. It has completeness. That includes beauty, kindness, nowness. There's
  no distance in connection with it. Where did you get your ignorance? Whose
  particular wool is pulled over your eyes? Who taught you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, numbers of people have tried to. I've read tons of books&mdash;some
  of them are here on these shelves&mdash;Plato, Nietzsche, Kant,
  Schopenhauer&mdash;Spengler&mdash;Karl Marx&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But not the Twenty-third Psalm."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I know it by heart."</p>

  <p>"What is the first line?"</p>

  <p>"'The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.'"</p>

  <p>"Good. Stop there. That's the whole secret. It's the one important thing
  to know and remember. All other knowledge is merely relative to that."</p>

  <p>"But it isn't true, Nancy. I know it isn't. I've proved it's a lie. I used
  to believe it. I tried to prove it. I took everything I had&mdash;hope,
  faith, enthusiasm, trust in God, whoever or whatever He is, and offered them
  up&mdash;oh, how ungrudgingly. I hadn't a single mental reservation. I was
  simply enthusiastic and eager to live. Life felt suddenly like flowers in a
  garden in spring. I threw pride overboard, and money, and a career, and the
  good opinion of the few friends I had. I said: the Lord will provide. And now
  look at me. I haven't even my baby. And I haven't Tom Grayne's confidence.
  I'm married to him. I seduced him. He isn't really my husband."</p>

  <p>"But you're going back to him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Thanks to Andrew. Gunning's generosity. I like Tom. I admire him. I
  love him. But he doesn't love me. He never will. I'm a liability and he's too
  manly to admit it. So I'm returning to Tibet to set Tom free. After that I
  don't care what happens."</p>

  <p>"No? But as I understand it you agreed, before you married, that either
  might divorce the other if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It wasn't supposed to be a real marriage. It was an alliance."</p>

  <p>"Do you remember what Talleyrand said about that?"</p>

  <p>"No. Wasn't he Napoleon's Judas? I've been Tom Grayne's Judas."</p>

  <p>"He was Napoleon's confidential minister. He said: 'Every alliance is a
  horse and rider.'"</p>

  <p>"That sounds like one of those generalizations. But perhaps it's true. At
  any rate, I'm like an old man of the sea on Tom's shoulders, and he knows it,
  and I know it, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it a long way to go, just to tell Tom Grayne what he knows
  already?"</p>

  <p>"A long way. Yes. But it's better than running away."</p>

  <p>"And yet you're running from something nearer."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? I'm not running. I'm facing the fact."</p>

  <p>"Something nearer than breathing, closer than hands and feet."</p>

  <p>"You mean Tennyson's God? I don't believe in God. I did. But I don't
  now."</p>

  <p>"I mean your vision."</p>

  <p>"I haven't any. You mean clairvoyance? That's a disease!"</p>

  <p>"Elsa, it is the substance of things hoped for. It is the evidence of
  things not seen by&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nancy, it's naked hell! You ought to know, if you have the same
  affliction. I can't imagine how you endure it and keep your faith in&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>"Will you let me tell you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if you won't be cruel about it. Don't tell me to count my blessings.
  I have a curse that outweighs all of them, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen, child. I am going to cell you in the fewest possible words, what
  Lobsang Pun took nine years to teach me."</p>

  <p>"Before he kicked you out of Lhasa without a penny to find your way across
  Tibet! I call that evidence of cruelty."</p>

  <p>"Before he kindly and unsentimentally forced me to do what he knew I could
  do, and what I wouldn't have done otherwise. No calf ever wants to be
  weaned."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to kick me out? Very well, I'll go the minute you say
  so."</p>

  <p>"I can prevent you from going to Tibet, Elsa. And unless you wake up, I
  will prevent you. Tibet is no land for a meek mouse. You must be willing to
  be what you are."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? What do you think I am?"</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you yourself think you are."</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I have given up trying to know. I feel like a discouraged
  female in a bad temper. But what's a female? Nothing! Protoplasm and
  sensation, stuck together with magnetism, and nobody knows what that is,
  except that it's said to be a form of motion&mdash;but motion what of?"</p>

  <p>"You are an evidence of evolution."</p>

  <p>"Evolution of what?"</p>

  <p>"Evolution of consciousness. My dear, you're a proof of St. Paul's
  statement: 'for now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face.'
  You're one degree of evolution ahead of most people. Your glass isn't quite
  so dark."</p>

  <p>"If this is evolution, I'm headed the wrong way!"</p>

  <p>"Listen, my dear. You can't prevent it, any more than the crops can
  prevent the weather. But you can make hell for yourself if you resist;
  because evolution breaks the molds of consciousness as the roots of growing
  trees break rocks. Evolution is a spiritual, irresistible growth&mdash;
  upward and outward from the illusion of solid four-dimensional limited
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Four dimensional?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Time is a dimension of matter. Length, breadth, depth and time. Or,
  more simply, space-time."</p>

  <p>"Evolution upward toward what? Disillusionment? I'm there now."</p>

  <p>"Growth toward reality, where the illusion of matter fades, true
  dimensions enter consciousness, and the secret place of the Most High yields
  its secret. Child, even now you can see through stone walls and across a
  thousand miles of mountains to where Tom Grayne is."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I can't make him see me, so it's only torture. I even know what
  he's thinking about. But I can't warn him. I can see danger, but I can't make
  him see it. I can't even tell him our baby is dead. Don't, Nancy! Don't!
  You're seeing, and you're making me see! Please don't!"</p>

  <p>"There are rules to be learned. No one can use even a hammer and a saw
  without knowing the rules. We can't even walk without first learning how to
  do it, or play the piano without learning the notes."</p>

  <p>"Some people can. They do it naturally, without thinking. I can, and I
  never took a music lesson."</p>

  <p>"You obey the rules intuitively. That doesn't make them not-rules. Rule
  Number One of Evolution, which is the Law of Life, is 'The Lord is my
  shepherd, I shall not want.'"</p>

  <p>"Is that what you teach children! But Nancy, it isn't true! I know it
  isn't! It's a lie! I want my baby, for instance, and my husband's confidence,
  and faith that life's worth living, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen to the second rule. It's in the Ninety-first Psalm: 'He that
  dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High ...' You know the rest of it,
  don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. I know it by heart."</p>

  <p>"What does your heart tell you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. A heart is just a physical organ. What I used to believe has
  turned out so totally false that&mdash;Nancy, can you look around at the
  world, and then believe such piffle? War, cruelty, poverty, sickness, lying
  propaganda, pain, death&mdash;dead babies&mdash;not mine only&mdash; babies
  bombed to death in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen to the third rule: 'And though I have the gift of prophecy, and
  understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so
  that I could remove mountains, and have not the milk of human kindness, I am
  nothing.'"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes. Thirteenth Corinthians. I had to say it at school and then put
  sixpence in the poor box. Kindness? I don't even know what it means. I don't
  know much knowledge; and I've no faith left, although I did have some once;
  but I don't believe I ever did know what human kindness really means. I
  thought I was being kind to Tom. The fact is, I was cruel."</p>

  <p>"My dear, if you will be kinder to yourself you will learn what skittles
  facts are."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you mean mind over matter? Don't you believe in facts? Isn't it a
  fact that you and I are here, talking to each other? Isn't your school a
  fact? Wasn't my baby a fact? Mind can't change that, can it?"</p>

  <p>"Try giving mind a chance."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Accept the fact of spiritual evolution. Recognize it. Trust your
  clairvoyant vision, and then look at the other facts."</p>

  <p>"I can't trust it. I daren't. It's like dreams."</p>

  <p>"Master it. Govern it."</p>

  <p>"I can't. It runs away with me. It leads me into all kinds of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece. It was a quarter to
  twelve. She stood up and took a step toward Elsa. The firelight shone on
  their faces. They were half-reliefs, unreal, bright-eyed, against wavering
  shadow from which the cat's eyes watched them.</p>

  <p>"We've had enough of that hysteria, young woman. Ally yourself one way or
  the other. Every alliance is a horse and a rider. Ride or be ridden. Tell me
  what you think your soul is."</p>

  <p>"I haven't one:"</p>

  <p>"Quite right. Now we're getting somewhere."</p>

  <p>"I used to believe the old superstition that I have a soul to be saved
  from hell. It's a lie."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's a lie. You are your soul. How could you have what you are?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"You're not a body that has a soul. You are your soul. Soul! You have a
  body and brain that are no more you than that dress which your body is
  wearing. Wake up."</p>

  <p>"I'm wide awake. At any rate, my brain tells me I am."</p>

  <p>"Listen, Elsa. Your brain is no more you than this portrait is Lobsang
  Pun. Even the most bigoted and stupid second-rate scientists know nowadays
  that brains can't think. Brains are like radio sets, to be controlled and
  used and tuned in. They're too often tuned in to the sort of nonsense you've
  been talking tonight. Your mind is no more in your brain than Lobsang Pun is
  in his photograph."</p>

  <p>"If my brain doesn't think, what does?"</p>

  <p>"You do. And you will either believe what your senses tell you, in a glass
  darkly, or what you see face to face, with your clairvoyant vision. Your
  brain sees illusion, because it's part of the illusion, and you tune it in to
  the illusion. It can see reality if you'll let it. Clairvoyance is soul
  &mdash;vision&mdash;it's you&mdash;the real you&mdash;waking&mdash; one
  degree of evolution closer to reality, seeing things more nearly as they
  really are."</p>

  <p>"But, Nancy, it's unendurable. It isn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Learn to control it. Others will do that for you, if you don't."</p>

  <p>"How can others control it, if I can't?"</p>

  <p>"They will control you without your knowing they're doing it, unless you
  remember the rules. And if they can't control you they will treat you the way
  they treated Jesus and Joan of Arc and countless others."</p>

  <p>"Didn't Jesus know the rules?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Joan of Arc had soul-vision, but without understanding the rules.
  She won battles and saved France. But she had wielded the sword. She had
  accepted the reality of hatred, cruelty and death. You know what happened to
  her."</p>

  <p>"You're not trying to encourage me with her fate, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Jesus, on the other hand, had vision and knew all the rules. He rejected
  the sword, repudiated the brain-mind illusion of matter-substance,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and got crucified."</p>

  <p>"But arose from the dead."</p>

  <p>"You believe that? You don't believe that, do you?"</p>

  <p>"I know it. That's different from believing. Whoever believes can
  disbelieve. I know."</p>

  <p>"I wish I even believed."</p>

  <p>"Jesus broke once and for all the solid hypnotic illusion of matter-
  consciousness, and said: 'I go my way.' It's a long way, Elsa. But it's the
  way of evolution. And they'll Joan of Arc you on the way, unless you remember
  the rules."</p>

  <p>"That sounds cheerful!"</p>

  <p>"'Who is not with me, is against me.' Trust the one or the other. The
  reality or the illusion. But don't try both, or you'll find yourself giving
  to Caesar the things that are God's and trying to buy God with Caesar's
  counterfeit credit."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, there's no fanatic in me. Really there isn't. You sound as if
  you're inviting me to be a martyr."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But not a fanatic. Martyr means living witness, not dead witness. A
  witness sees, knows, and gives evidence of the truth and nothing but the
  truth. A fanatic believes, but doesn't know; so he's afraid. Fear destroys
  the fanatic's sense of humor and makes him hysterical. A fanatic desires
  proof of what he believes but can't prove. He tries to create the proofs
  usually by doing violence to others. But a witness is proof of what he knows.
  He is it. He is the knowledge itself. He is the secret truth and its
  evidence."</p>

  <p>"Why secret?"</p>

  <p>"Because the self-styled realists can't see it. Their conceit won't let
  them see it. If they even believed it blindly they would take your truth and
  try to use it to strengthen materiality. The power-cravers, the money-hungry,
  the self-important&mdash;the opportunists&mdash;will use you, and then lose
  you, the way the French lost Joan of Arc. They'll canonize you when it's too
  late."</p>

  <p>"Then you want me to see, and say nothing?"</p>

  <p>"I am not inviting you to cast pearls before swine. Which side will you be
  witness for? You or your senses? Spirit or matter? Dark logic or bright
  intuition?"</p>

  <p>Elsa quoted, laughing: "'Almost thou persuadest me to&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"My appeal is to you. Not the pig, but the poet. The real you. But if it
  helps you to use logic, use it," said Nancy. "Do you realize that e you can't
  drop a grain of sand into the sea without eventually moving every drop of
  water in all the oceans in the world?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I read that years ago in the Atlantic Monthly. It seems almost
  incredible. But I suppose it's true."</p>

  <p>"It is mathematically and physically true and demonstrable. But even the
  sea, as our senses perceive it, is only phenomenal&mdash;a part of the
  illusion of thought. You&mdash;you yourself with a grain of sand can move
  every drop of all those billions of tons of water. How much more then will
  one thought, violently flung, disturb the whole mass of illusion in which we
  think we live and move and have our being!"</p>

  <p>"Good heavens&mdash;then shouldn't we think?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But think. Don't parrot other people's fears at secondhand. See
  &mdash;know&mdash;trust your vision&mdash;and remember Rule One."</p>

  <p>"But not talk about it? Not tell anyone?"</p>

  <p>"Not unless you want to be Joan-of-Arc'd by the thought manipulators,
  propagandists and the devils who use others' vision for their own ends."</p>

  <p>"But you're telling it"</p>

  <p>"I am talking to you, not to your material illusion. This is a communion,
  not a battle of brains. 'Where two or three are gathered together in my name
  ...'"</p>

  <p>"I always wondered what that meant."</p>

  <p>"Arguing with the crowd increases and enrages the illusion that already
  blinds them. It makes it easier for hypnotists to control them. That is the
  sole reason for secrecy. The truth enrages the liars. But one by one, two by
  two, sometimes three by three, we can find our way out from the illusion of
  desire, into reality. That makes it easier for all the others to follow."</p>

  <p>"Mustn't we desire anything?"</p>

  <p>"No. Desire presupposes that we have not. Desire is the exact opposite of
  real consciousness. Desire for the illusion of material means to the
  spiritual end made me hesitate to come here and start this school. But I gave
  up desiring. I obeyed, and came, and found what was needed. It was waiting
  for me. Desire, hatred, malice are the essence of illusion. They're its
  substance&mdash;what it's made of. They produce war, cruelty, poverty
  &mdash;and in the end disillusion&mdash;and then new beginnings. But why
  exhaust the horrors of illusion before&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mayn't we own anything?"</p>

  <p>"You'll find you can't help owning things. But don't let things own you.
  Never regard things as more than shadows of ideas."</p>

  <p>The clock struck twelve. "Midnight," said Nancy Strong. "Middle of
  nothing. But we can't ignore time as long as we're imprisoned in it. Time
  waits for no man, and space confines us. But time and space are illusions.
  You and I can prove it."</p>

  <p>The front door bell rang&mdash;sudden and loud. The servant's footsteps
  hurried along the hallway. Nancy Strong sat down.</p>

  <p>"Remember," she said, "we can prove nothing, and be nothing, without the
  milk of human kindness. Even faith is worth nothing without it, and hope is a
  fool."</p>

  <p>"How can you tell it from charity?"</p>

  <p>"By its humor. That's the milk of it. Charity has absolutely no humor.
  True kindness is humor, plus vision and courage."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, you don't seem particularly humorous this evening."</p>

  <p>"Child, if I had laughed, you might have feared I was laughing at you
  instead of with you. Who is our visitor? Look."</p>

  <p>"You mean go out and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look. It might be one of three people. Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh" said Elsa. "I can see him on the doorstep. What shall I do?
  I'm supposed to be ill at the monastery! Can't I escape to my room before he
  comes in here?"</p>

  <p>"Run away if you wish," said Nancy Strong. "But why not face him? He is
  only a fact. And he has no sense of humor."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">CHAPTER 13</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Bulah Singh looked at his best as he entered Nancy Strong's
  big living room. The servant who ushered him in switched on the light, but at
  a sign from Nancy he switched it off again. The Sikh stood framed in the
  light from the hall, handsome, important, a shade mysterious. But when the
  servant closed the door at his back and he walked forward, then the firelight
  that shone on his eyes showed also the shape of his mouth. His stride was
  vaguely feline.</p>

  <p>"I surprise you?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"No," said Nancy. "But didn't Miss Burbage's movements surprise you? I
  expected you would come here. Please put some wood on the fire before you sit
  down."</p>

  <p>The Sikh complied. He didn't like doing it. Instead of making him feel at
  ease it cost him some of the tactical aggressiveness that he had studiously
  built up. He was aware that, behind his back, Nancy and Elsa were comparing
  notes&mdash;eyes meeting silently and uniting their mental resistance against
  him. He was at pains to look judicial and self-assured when he sat down,
  facing Elsa. But it didn't quite work. They formed a triangle, with firelight
  on their faces, high chair-backs behind them, and beyond that darkness. The
  cat lay on the hearthrug studying the occasional exploding spits of rain that
  fell down the chimney. Bulah Singh leaned forward and stroked the cat's
  head.</p>

  <p>"A wet night," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Are you cold?" Nancy Strong asked him. "Would you care for a drink?"</p>

  <p>"No, thanks. I came on important business. May I speak with Miss Burbage
  alone?"</p>

  <p>"Why alone?" asked Elsa, wondering at herself. It was her own voice, but
  it didn't sound like hers.</p>

  <p>The Sikh looked hard at her. "Because that may be to your advantage," he
  answered.</p>

  <p>"Official business?" Nancy Strong suggested.</p>

  <p>"Not yet. I would like to keep this part of it off the record. I am
  depending on you to be as discreet as I have known you to be on previous
  occasions."</p>

  <p>"You don't want me to listen? Very well," said Nancy. "Shall I leave you
  alone together?"</p>

  <p>"Nancy, I wish you wouldn't," said Elsa. "I've no secrets from you. I'd
  much rather you'd stay."</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong smiled at the Sikh: "But Bulah Singh" she said, "wouldn't
  trust an old gossip like me. He knows all&mdash;tells nothing. He is like
  Akhnaton." That was the cat's name.</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh was in the wrong mood. He didn't like the remark. "I know some
  secrets," he retorted darkly. "It is my professional occupation to know what
  is going on. I was told that Miss Burbage was ill at the monastery. She
  appears to be quite well. Is it a secret why she was brought here by a back
  route&mdash;why the monks have put her luggage in your godown?"</p>

  <p>"I advised it," said Nancy. "Has her luggage come? Good."</p>

  <p>"If you had consulted me I would have provided transportation, openly and
  aboveboard," said Bulah Singh. "It is a good thing she is out of the
  monastery. That place is a nest of intrigue."</p>

  <p>"Mu-ni Gam-po," Nancy answered, "has been my friend more years than I care
  to count. So I suppose that's a dig at me?"</p>

  <p>The Sikh smiled ambushed insolence: "I know more than you suspect. Do you
  forget my offer to exchange confidences? You rejected it. You preferred to
  force me, instead, to use other means of finding out what it is my duty to
  know. Even you can't keep all the secrets."</p>

  <p>"Flatterer!" said Nancy.</p>

  <p>"May I speak to Miss Burbage, alone?"</p>

  <p>"What do you want to talk about?" Elsa demanded. She felt rather
  contemptuous, strangely enough; but perhaps that was a reaction from Nancy
  Strong's attitude.</p>

  <p>The Sikh looked hard at her: "About Andrew Gunning."</p>

  <p>"Oh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Elsa felt her heart skip two beats. But when she spoke to Nancy her voice
  was quite normal: "Is there another room we can go into?"</p>

  <p>"No, dear, stay where you are. I will go to my office and wait there. I
  have a letter to write."</p>

  <p>"But you'll be cold."</p>

  <p>"No, there's an oil stove. I will leave the office door ajar, so just call
  out to me when you've finished talking."</p>

  <p>The Sikh stood until Nancy Strong left the room and the door shut with a
  thud and the click of a brass latch. Then, still standing:</p>

  <p>"Miss Burbage, you are in a false position," he said abruptly. "You make a
  mistake when you try to keep your movements secret from me. It can't be done.
  Why are you here?"</p>

  <p>He sat down, bolt upright, his face growing gradually more determined,
  more menacing, as he watched Elsa's. She was curled up in the armchair with
  her feet under her, because she had taken off her shoes to dry them at the
  fire and she didn't choose that the Sikh should see the hole in the toe of
  her stocking. She looked puzzled. Bulah Singh wanted her well frightened. She
  realized that. But he also wanted to present himself as a magnanimous
  official who could excuse and protect if properly respected. She understood
  that, too. She wasn't being clairvoyant in the usual way. The thought behind
  the Sikh's words was revealing itself as color. It was muddy color, dull red,
  steel-blue, and gray-green, one appearing through the other and never still
  for a moment. So she knew he was thinking of several alternatives and
  hesitating what to say. But she couldn't tell what it was all about, and she
  felt no alarm.</p>

  <p>"I was invited here," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he said abruptly, "what do you know about Andrew Gunning's past
  in the United States?"</p>

  <p>Elsa frowned, startled, but not frightened, though she felt she should be.
  There was calculated menace in the Sikh's carefully chosen tone of voice, and
  in the way his tongue played on his teeth above the outthrust lower lip. She
  felt that the attack was aimed at herself, not Andrew. Some of Nancy Strong's
  phrases began flooding her mind. They made no sense, and she didn't believe
  them, but there they were: proof of evolution&mdash;spiritual process
  &mdash;the Lord is my shepherd&mdash;milk of human kindness&mdash;wake
  up!</p>

  <p>"I mean his history before you met him," said Bulah Singh. "I know enough
  about your present relationship."</p>

  <p>That should have stung, but it didn't. It should have angered her. It
  didn't. She felt no impulse to answer. T he Sikh repeated the question:</p>

  <p>"What do you know about Andrew Gunning's past in the United States? He
  must have told you. Tell me. It is important."</p>

  <p>That instant she saw a vision of Andrew. It was a composite memory-
  portrait. It included Andrew in a snowstorm, heating water on a yak-dung
  fire, in the lee of a rock, ready for an unborn baby&mdash;Andrew carving
  portraits of Chenrezi&mdash;Andrew and Dr. Lewis and Mu-ni Gam-po&mdash; but
  no Andrew at that moment. She had no idea where he was or what he might be
  doing.</p>

  <p>"He has told me very little about America," she answered. "I know he went
  to college, and played football, and got a degree, and afterwards studied
  law. He isn't old enough, is he, to have done much more than that?"</p>

  <p>"Did he never tell you about a criminal indictment?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"For homicide?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Oh well, if you're not in his confidence," said Bulah Singh, "I'd better
  let things take their course. It might have been possible to save him."</p>

  <p>Now she did feel afraid. "Save him? From what? Bulah Singh, what do you
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"Use your clairvoyance!"</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about? What has happened? Is Andrew in trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Keep calm. He is in serious trouble. Your clairvoyance might help him. It
  might."</p>

  <p>"Is Andrew hurt? Has something happened to him? Quick! Tell me!"</p>

  <p>"Will you help him?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I'll help him! What is it? Tell me!"</p>

  <p>"Make a definite promise."</p>

  <p>"If Andrew needs my help I will do anything I possibly can&mdash;
  anything."</p>

  <p>"You promise?"</p>

  <p>"That is a promise. Bulah Singh, unless you tell me at once what has
  happened I will ask Miss Strong to phone Dr. Lewis and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh interrupted: "Dr. Lewis has been investigating Andrew Gunning,
  and you too&mdash;as I daresay you will realize&mdash;if you cast your
  thought back over recent events."</p>

  <p>"Dr.&mdash;Morgan&mdash;Lewis has&mdash;why, he's Tom Grayne's
  friend&mdash;he's my friend&mdash;he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In the secret intelligence service there is no such thing as friendship,"
  said Bulah Singh. "Dr. Morgan Lewis was your secret enemy, and
  Gunning's."</p>

  <p>"Was? You said was?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have serious news. Lewis knew all about Gunning's past in the
  United States. He found out every detail of his illegal preparations to
  return to Tibet. Perhaps you know how he found out. Lewis has dabbled for
  years in telepathy."</p>

  <p>Elsa felt herself grow cold with self-accusing fear.</p>

  <p>The Sikh continued: "Lewis learned from Mu-ni Gam-po that Gunning intends
  to find the Lama Lobsang Pun and help him to reach Tom Grayne. That is true,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I won't answer. What has happened to Andrew?"</p>

  <p>"I came to ask you to help him. Lewis was a conceited man. He was jealous
  of me. He called on Gunning this evening and accused him of having bribed me
  to be deaf and blind to his arrangements to cross the border into Tibet."</p>

  <p>"Has Andrew been arrested?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet."</p>

  <p>"What did happen? Where is Andrew now?"</p>

  <p>"Listen carefully." The Sikh's mouth betrayed greedy triumph. His eyes
  stared at Elsa's. They didn't move. His eyelids didn't blink. He spoke
  slowly: "Lewis and Gunning quarreled. Lewis now lies dead in Gunning's room
  at the hotel."</p>

  <p>Elsa came uncurled, bolt upright. The cat fed into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Lewis! Dead? Where is Andrew?"</p>

  <p>"On his way to Tibet."</p>

  <p>"You mean he's running away?"</p>

  <p>"He can be overtaken, of course. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what? Bulah Singh, are you lying? Are you trying to make me believe
  that Andrew killed Dr. Lewis?"</p>

  <p>"Use your clairvoyance."</p>

  <p>"I am trying to use it! I see nothing!"</p>

  <p>"I left them alone together, in Gunning's room at the hotel. I had hardly
  reached my office at police headquarters when the news came by
  telephone."</p>

  <p>"From whom?"</p>

  <p>"From my man on the spot. Gunning had been seen leaving the hotel. I
  detailed an inspector and several men to trace Gunning's movements. He has
  vanished."</p>

  <p>Elsa relaxed suddenly: "Bulah Singh, I don't believe one word of it! How
  could Andrew possibly get away? He had no horse&mdash;no motorcar."</p>

  <p>The Sikh interrupted: "Gunning is a man of foresight and resource. He had
  anticipated this. He made his preparations in advance. Weren't you expecting
  him here?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"You are up late."</p>

  <p>"Talking, that's all." Then suddenly, staring at the Sikh's eyes: "Bulah
  Singh, are you lying about Andrew and Dr. Lewis?"</p>

  <p>"Use your clairvoyance. Use it! Look!"</p>

  <p>"I see the color of your thought! I can't interpret that! I can't see
  Andrew. When my friends are in danger, I sometimes know it&mdash;sometimes
  &mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Gunning is in no danger," said Bulah Singh, "if you do your part."</p>

  <p>"My part? My part? What do you mean?" Nancy Strong's words poured into her
  mind&mdash;no sense to them, but a kind of rhythm like running water: shall
  not want&mdash;dimensions of ideas&mdash;human kindness&mdash;Lord is my
  shepherd, I&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Gunning's fate is in your hands," said Bulah Singh. His eyes didn't move.
  They were fixed on hers steadily. "Obey me, and he shall escape to
  Tibet."</p>

  <p>"Obey you? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"You know what I mean."</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Tell me! Don't talk riddles."</p>

  <p>"You do know. Look into my eyes. Now&mdash;obey me&mdash;and save Andrew
  Gunning."</p>

  <p>"Obey you? How? Do what?"</p>

  <p>"Use your clairvoyance."</p>

  <p>"You mean now?"</p>

  <p>"Continually. There is no other way to save Gunning from capture,
  indictment, conviction and death by hanging. Obey me, and he shall get clear
  away. I am your friend. Your only friend in India. Obey me and save Andrew
  Gunning."</p>

  <p>Elsa was seeing visions, staring wide-eyed into the darkness beyond Bulah
  Singh. She saw Tom Grayne, in the cavern she knew so well, near Shig-po-ling,
  nine hundred miles away&mdash;Tom Grayne in danger; but she could only sense,
  she could not see the danger&mdash;Tom Grayne, waiting&mdash; waiting for the
  spring and for Andrew with men and supplies. She was hardly conscious of
  Bulah Singh's voice, speaking slowly in firm monotone:</p>

  <p>"It was your fault that Gunning came to Darjeeling&mdash;your fault that
  Lewis found out all his plans&mdash;your fault&mdash;your fault. And now only
  you can save him&mdash;by obeying me, your friend&mdash;always &mdash;obeying
  me&mdash;always."</p>

  <p>The front door bell rang. The Sikh began to speak more quickly: "Here come
  the plainclothes policemen to get clues to pursue Gunning. Only I can send
  them in a wrong direction. You must obey me. Promise to obey me. Say it!"</p>

  <p>The bell rang again. The servant hurried along the hallway and undid the
  clattering chain on the front door.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid," said Bulah Singh. "You are afraid for Andrew Gunning.
  But you know you need not fear, if you obey me. Answer: you will obey
  me."</p>

  <p>The front door opened and the wind blustered in, carrying voices along the
  hallway.</p>

  <p>"Answer," Bulah Singh commanded.</p>

  <p>Elsa came out of reverie suddenly, looking straight at him. She smiled:
  "Yes, I'll answer. If it's as bad as you say it is, Bulah Singh, I will take
  Miss Strong's advice and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door opened suddenly. Andrew Gunning strode into the room. The Sikh
  swore under his breath. Elsa stifled what was almost a scream.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER 14</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Elsa and Bulah Singh jumped to their feet and spoke
  simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"Andrew!"</p>

  <p>"You idiot!" The Sikh strode forward.</p>

  <p>Andrew switched on the light: " 'Evening," he said. "What's the bright
  idea?" He appeared to expect the Sikh to attack him. He stood still, with a
  fighting smile and lowered eyebrows. The Sikh went close to him and spoke
  low-voiced:</p>

  <p>"Go now, you fool&mdash;or you're next. You were warned."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Andrew. "On my way here one of my own men warned me to clear
  out. Is this your doing? Who shot Morgan Lewis?"</p>

  <p>"On your way!" said the Sikh. "Someone shall overtake you with a message.
  Get going!"</p>

  <p>"Andrew!" Elsa had crossed the room in stockinged feet. She stood beside
  Bulah Singh. "Andrew, you're accused of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh spoke with studied calmness: "If you don't want to hang, get
  going. Lewis lies dead in your room at the hotel, shot with your
  automatic."</p>

  <p>Andrew answered stubbornly: "My automatic was turned in long ago for
  registration at police headquarters."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh sneered: "You have the receipt for it?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Andrew. "One of your spies stole that when he searched my
  rooms. You framed this."</p>

  <p>"It's a clear case," the Sikh answered. "You haven't a chance. If you
  wait, they will hang you as sure as time is your enemy! Go! Hurry! I will
  hold up pursuit while you cross the frontier."</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing," said Andrew. "Arrest me, if you want to. I'll stay and
  find out who did kill Lewis. They'll need my evidence."</p>

  <p>Elsa started to speak. Bulah Singh stepped sideways between her and Andrew
  and turned his back to her. He spoke with concentrated fury: "You'll not live
  to give evidence. Your only chance is to do what I told you to do, in Tibet.
  I'll keep in touch. You can't play tricks with me. Get going, or hang!"</p>

  <p>Elsa stepped beside Andrew and faced the Sikh. He scowled, speaking to her
  with his jaw thrust forward: "They will convict Mu-ni Gam-po and you as
  accomplices. That means prison. Tom Grayne will be left flat in Tibet, for
  St. Malo to deal with and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elsa touched Andrew's arm: "Andrew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Elsa, you keep out of this. I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please, Andrew. Bulah Singh knows you didn't kill Dr. Lewis. I know he
  knows it. But if you stay here to face this out, they'll bring up all kinds
  of things against you. It may take months. Tom is waiting at Shig-po-ling,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew stared at her, amazed. Bulah Singh swore in Punjabi and then
  snarled in English: "Unless he goes, he'll hang. I guarantee that: If he
  goes, he's safe. So are you. I guarantee that also." He glared at Andrew:
  "But get going&mdash;damn you, get a move on!"</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned obstinately. Elsa continued as if the Sikh hadn't spoken:
  "I will be all right here, Andrew. I'm not a bit afraid. The great thing is
  not to leave Tom in the lurch, isn't it?" She looked straight into Bulah
  Singh's eyes, keeping her hand on Andrew's forearm so that he bit back the
  hot speech he had ready. Between those two big men she looked like a pale
  child, wide-eyed with bedtime sleepiness. But they waited for her to speak
  &mdash;the Sikh suspicious&mdash;Andrew puzzled, half expecting her to begin
  telling visions. What she said to the Sikh surprised both of them.</p>

  <p>"Hadn't you better go?" she suggested. "Leave me to persuade Andrew?"</p>

  <p>The Sikh's face revealed instant triumph. He nodded. "Yes. Persuade him as
  you love him. I must go&mdash;to delay the pursuit. Good-bye, Gunning. You
  can save her. She can save you. I can protect both of you. Don't waste
  time!"</p>

  <p>He glanced around as if he meditated going out through a window.</p>

  <p>Andrew's lip curled: "You left your raincoat in the hall."</p>

  <p>The Sikh nodded. He walked to the door, opened it, turned suddenly to
  stare at Andrew and said: "You will find your road clear if you go swiftly. I
  will keep in continual touch. Play my game&mdash;and you will find her safe
  when you return. But don't come back empty-handed."</p>

  <p>He closed the door quietly and let himself out through the front door.</p>

  <p>As it slammed the phone rang. It continued ringing until at the far end of
  the hall Nancy Strong shut the door of her office. Andrew and Elsa faced each
  other in silence, Andrew breathing through his nose, too furious to trust
  himself to speak. Elsa was afraid to speak for fear she might touch off the
  angry energy that she knew might cause him to act without thinking.</p>

  <p>"It's a God-damned shame," he said suddenly, grinding hisF teeth. "Morgan
  Lewis was a good guy. Foxy. Too mysterious. But on the level. I wonder who
  shot him with my gun."</p>

  <p>"We have only Bulah Singh's word for it," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"His word's worth nothing," Andrew agreed, "but Bompo Tsering met me with
  the whole story out here by the gate in the dark. He wanted me to run. It's
  less than an hour since Lewis warned me that Bulah Singh has designs on you.
  See here&mdash;" he hesitated, staring at her&mdash;"why did you take Bulah
  Singh's side of it? Why did you say you'd persuade me?"</p>

  <p>"To get rid of him. To get him out of the way, so that we could decide
  what to do."</p>

  <p>"Elsa, you haven't a chance on earth to persuade me to play that man's
  game. He's a devil. He's clever. But I've a hunch I can prove he killed
  Lewis. It may be hard to prove. He may have hypnotized some&mdash;just a
  moment&mdash;look me in the eyes&mdash;what was he doing in here?&mdash; Did
  he hypnotize you?"</p>

  <p>"He tried."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure he didn't?"</p>

  <p>"Quite sure."</p>

  <p>"Lewis told me you'd be easy for him if he caught you off guard."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but I had been talking to Nancy Strong before Bulah Singh came."</p>

  <p>"About hypnotism?"</p>

  <p>"No. About pigs and poets. Don't ask now, Andrew, it would take too long
  to tell. Just think. Try to get your mind quiet. Don't be stampeded."</p>

  <p>"Stampeded nothing."</p>

  <p>"Was my boot in your room at the hotel?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Fortunately Lewis noticed it. So I brought it along&mdash;gave it to
  Bompo Tsering."</p>

  <p>"Do you trust Bompo Tsering?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He might be outwitted. He scares easy. But he wouldn't betray me for
  luck or money. He said he had the story from a man at the hotel. He'd gone
  there to find me. So he ran and overtook me. Yes, I trust Bompo Tsering."</p>

  <p>"So do I trust him. Did he say everything's ready?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He wanted me to bolt without coming here. He believes I did kill
  Lewis."</p>

  <p>"Well, Andrew, I do think you'd better go. I don't think you're in danger.
  Can you get along without the things you had at the hotel?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. I planned to leave all that stuff. Everything I need is up close to
  the border, ready for the take-off."</p>

  <p>"Then go, Andrew. And God bless you. Please tell Tom what I asked you to
  tell him."</p>

  <p>"No. Nothing doing. I'll send Bompo Tsering. He's a good headman. He'll
  make it. He'll get through somehow. I'll stay and face the music."</p>

  <p>"Andrew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated. They could hear the clock tick on the mantelpiece. "Will
  you trust me this one last time?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh told me that Dr. Lewis is dead."</p>

  <p>"I guess all Darjeeling knows it by now."</p>

  <p>"But he isn't dead! Andrew, he isn't."</p>

  <p>"Are you seeing things?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! So you're not in danger. But if you don't go you will be, because
  Bulah Singh&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted, speaking gently: "You've been under too much strain
  lately. That damned Sikh has got you frightened and all mixed up in your
  mind. But see here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Andrew&mdash;Dr. Lewis is not dead. He isn't even hurt. And he's on your
  side."</p>

  <p>"No one could sell me that he wasn't friendly," Andrew answered.</p>

  <p>"So you go now&mdash;and trust Dr. Lewis."</p>

  <p>"Swell idea! I suppose I'm to tell Tom Grayne I left you to the mercies of
  a dead doctor and a Sikh hypnotist? Take a good look with that vision of
  yours and see if you can see me doing it"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you must go. I know it will be all right if you do. But if you
  don't&mdash;things are known about you&mdash;I mean, things in the United
  States. I know none of the details but Bulah Singh does, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong knocked on the door and came into the room. She glanced down
  the passage before closing the door. She looked grimly amused; but in the
  aura of her humor was a hint of a broom that sweeps clean.</p>

  <p>"Elsa!&mdash;in your stockinged feet&mdash;you should know better. These
  stone floors chill you right through the carpet. Go and warm your feet at the
  fire."</p>

  <p>She switched off the light, took Elsa's hand and led her to the fireplace.
  Andrew followed.</p>

  <p>"Put some wood on, Andrew."</p>

  <p>He obeyed, stared, sat down facing them. There was silence for a moment
  while the fire leaped into a bright blaze. Then Nancy Strong breathed one of
  her sighs that smiled at the perplexity of things.</p>

  <p>"You know the news?" asked Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Oh, how much easier this world would be to live in if there weren't
  any men. Well, Elsa, I warned you that Morgan Lewis is dangerous."</p>

  <p>Elsa, staring at the fire, said: "Bulah Singh is the danger,"</p>

  <p>"Did he frighten you? Look at me!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look straight at me!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was frightened&mdash;not at first, but after a minute or two. I
  had begun to feel there was no escape from him. Then suddenly I remembered
  what you had been saying&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I see you are all right," said Nancy Strong.</p>

  <p>"Some of your phrases kept running through my mind, in back of my thought,
  like a refrain&mdash;like a tune that you can't forget&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And then you left off being meek! What do you think I was doing in my
  office?"</p>

  <p>"You said you would write a letter."</p>

  <p>"Here it is. Keep it. Child, much the easiest way to send good thinking
  straight to the one in need, is to write it down on paper, with a picture of
  the person in your mind. That forces you to concentrate. What did I write?
  Read it."</p>

  <p>Elsa unfolded the paper, read it and glanced up at Nancy: "May I?"</p>

  <p>Nancy nodded. Elsa handed the letter to Andrew. He held it to the
  firelight, frowning, puzzled, and glanced at both of them.</p>

  <p>"That is strong magic," said Nancy. "Stronger than all the mantras and
  Yogic exercises from here to hell-and-gone, if you'll pardon my emphasis. We
  all know the magic. The thing is to use it."</p>

  <p>Andrew folded Nancy's letter, stuffed it into his pocket and coughed to
  call attention to the fact that there was a crisis to deal with. Nancy looked
  at him sharply.</p>

  <p>"It takes a lot of the milk of human kindness," she said, "to get some
  people out of the messes that their ignorant generosity gets them into. Did
  you ever see a ghost?"</p>

  <p>"No, and I never wanted to," Andrew answered. "I need advice, badly. I'm
  going to be accused of shooting Dr. Morgan Lewis."</p>

  <p>"That man is a menace," said Nancy. "Do ghosts use telephones?"</p>

  <p>"I don't get you. Maybe I'm a bit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Morgan Lewis is a menace to himself and to half Darjeeling at this very
  moment," said Nancy. "He is riding a motorcycle, in the dark, in the rain,
  without a headlight."</p>

  <p>Elsa wriggled with delight. "Andrew, I told you!"</p>

  <p>Andrew stared at Nancy Strong: "You mean Lewis isn't dead? How do you
  know?"</p>

  <p>"He was talking to me a few minutes ago," said Nancy. "But of course
  &mdash;a motorcycle, at his time of life&mdash;and belonging at that to a
  Lepcha pharmacist's assistant&mdash;probably no brakes&mdash;and rotten
  tires&mdash;yes, he may be dead by this time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He isn't!" said Elsa. "He's coming! I know it! I can feel it! He is
  bringing good news!"</p>

  <p>"It will be bad news for someone," Nancy answered. "Unless that impudent
  Bulah Singh has sense enough to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen!" said Elsa.</p>

  <p>The machine-gun sputter of a decrepit motorcycle, hard-ridden, slowed up
  the drive and coughed to a standstill.</p>

  <p>Elsa nodded triumphantly: "Dr. Lewis!"</p>

  <p>"This has me beat," said Andrew. "The place feels like a madhouse."</p>

  <p>"The whole world is a madhouse," said Nancy Strong. "You shot Morgan
  Lewis. Here comes his ghost. Perhaps his ghost is a little bit sane. We'll
  soon know."</p>

  <p>The bell rang. The barefooted servant upset a chair in the hall in his
  hurry to reach the front door.</p>

  <p>"I'm a failure," said Nancy. "I have had that servant for fifteen years.
  But I can't train him not to fear ghosts. Someone told him Lewis is dead. I
  told him Lewis is coming. So a dead man's here! And now listen to him."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER 15</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The door opened. The turbaned servant, white-eyed with
  superstition, staring at Lewis, switched on the light. Lewis waited for the
  servant to close the door behind him, then switched the light off. Andrew
  stood up. Lewis strode through the firelit gap between the screen of
  bookcases straight toward Elsa and stood beside the armchair, looking down at
  her, with the firelight gleaming on his monocle.</p>

  <p>"Did you get my message?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I knew you weren't hurt. I knew you were coming. Is that what you
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"Did she? Can anyone prove it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Nancy Strong.</p>

  <p>"Good girl!" said Lewis. "That settles it. You may return to Tibet with
  Andrew Gunning."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Lewis, you're an angel," said Elsa. But everyone knew she resented
  his manner.</p>

  <p>"It's the devil who lets people do as they please," Lewis answered. He
  nodded to her, recognizing unspoken comments. "Yes," he added, "you've been
  where I never had a chance to go. But all the same, I'm the purveyor of
  dispensations." He stared at Andrew: "You should be on your way now, and in
  hiding, before daylight."</p>

  <p>Andrew squared his shoulders: "That suits me&mdash;seeing it's you, not
  Bulah Singh." He took the poker and prodded the fire.</p>

  <p>"Gently!" Nancy warned him. "Gently! That poker once belonged to Lord
  Tennyson. Don't break it."</p>

  <p>"Are the shutters tight?" Lewis asked.</p>

  <p>"No," said Nancy, "not particularly. The repair-man didn't come."</p>

  <p>Lewis chose the chair in the corner between bookcase and hearth.</p>

  <p>"What more," he remarked, "could a man with a pistol ask for than shutters
  that can be opened from outside!"</p>

  <p>"In twenty years, bullets have ruined three of my best books," Nancy
  remarked. "Weaklings have been bullet-minded ever since the World War. But an
  average of one in six or seven years isn't very exciting, is it?"</p>

  <p>"Who got shot in my room at the hotel?" Andrew asked.</p>

  <p>"No one," said Lewis. "But the top of your head is above the book-case
  now, so sit down."</p>

  <p>Andrew chose the chair in the corner facing Lewis. "Then the whole story's
  a fake?"</p>

  <p>"My word, no. I was shot at, if there's such a thing as evidence. Gunning,
  you are circumstantially guilty of attempted murder with an unregistered
  Luger automatic known to belong to you. The bullet went into the bedroom
  wall. The Luger was tossed into a bureau drawer by whoever used it. You are
  now making tracks for the sky line. Now! You are on your way&mdash;now. You
  haven't spoken to me. I'm a ghost. If necessary you will lie about that,
  blackly and without equivocation, taking all the consequences."</p>

  <p>"Okay. But I can't read thought. Do we get the lowdown?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;from high Olympus." Lewis turned toward Elsa: "Tell what
  happened," he said quietly, taking her wrist.</p>

  <p>"But, Dr. Lewis, I don't know what happened."</p>

  <p>"Not yet, perhaps. But you haven't looked. Look now. What took place in
  Andrew Gunning's room at the hotel?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"If you hadn't touched her she might have been able to read it," said
  Nancy Strong. "It won't work that way, Morgan. You have made her self-
  conscious. You will have to tell your own story."</p>

  <p>Andrew blundered to the rescue: "Besides, she hates that stuff," he
  objected. "Elsa; don't you let him rag you." He grinned pugnaciously at
  Lewis. "She's been run ragged by Bulah Singh, on top of her own worries. You
  let her alone."</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong spoke with authority, as if Lewis were a small boy: "Morgan,
  Andrew is right. Don't be cruel. Tell all of us what you told me just now
  over the telephone. I want to hear it again."</p>

  <p>"Since I'm in on this," said Andrew, "you might begin where we left off,
  in my room at the hotel. You warned me that Bulah Singh might trace Elsa
  here. So he did. I heard you lock my room door when I came away. After that,
  what?"</p>

  <p>"I unlocked it again," said Lewis.</p>

  <p>"So you knew what was going to happen? It was all in the bag?"</p>

  <p>Lewis laughed: "That's a beautiful phrase. No, nothing's in the bag
  &mdash;yet; not even Bulah Singh, although he's so scared we can bet on his
  making another mistake."</p>

  <p>"He seemed so cocksure here in this room, that he had me well fooled for a
  couple of minutes," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Several of us may be in the bag, as you call it, unless you fool him by
  staying fooled," Lewis answered. "The same man who wants you to get going
  toward Tibet prevented these shutters from being repaired. Nearly all
  hypnotists are self-hypnotized into absurdly overestimating their own
  craftiness. Bulah Singh is no exception. He feels he is playing a sort of
  occult chess against inferior opponents. He is too busy scorning his
  opponents' ignorance to notice his own mistakes. He feels like an invisible
  influence, because hypnotism can't be fingerprinted, or photographed or
  boiled in a tube for analysis. He is so cocksure of the secrecy of what he's
  doing&mdash;and of the superiority of his own intelligence&mdash;that he did
  an almost incredibly stupid thing. He employed a down-at-heel Eurasian,
  suffering from catatonia&mdash;ordered him to shoot me with your pistol."</p>

  <p>"What's catatonia?" asked Andrew.</p>

  <p>"It's a form of schizophrenia. That's the up-to-date name for dementia
  praecox. The man also has more or less dormant syphilis, suppressed some
  years ago by quack treatment. He will die of it one of these days, unless
  they hang him. He has been hypnotized to the point where he's simply a
  diseased mass of anti-social illusions. Didn't you notice the man on your way
  out of your bedroom?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"He was there, in the corridor, waiting. Perhaps he stepped into the
  lavatory to avoid you."</p>

  <p>"Come to think of it," said Andrew, "Bulah Singh did mention, after you'd
  left us alone together in my room, that he'd posted a man at the stairhead to
  prevent anyone from listening in to our conversation."</p>

  <p>"That was the man. Nathaniel Braganza Lemon. Not too bad-looking, but
  narrow between the eyes and a long, pointed chin. Degraded Virgo, in case you
  know what that means. Illegitimate son of an infantry corporal who was hanged
  for murdering the lad's Goanese-Japanese-Irish mother. Bad heredity. Bad
  environment. No character there to begin with. Plenty of hell rubbed into him
  as he grew up in the red-light district of Lahore and elsewhere. Persecution
  complex&mdash;envy, hatred, malice, greed&mdash;how he kept clear of the
  gallows I don't know. We've his prison and hospital record."</p>

  <p>"And you knew he was laying for you?" Andrew asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Fortunately! I know quite a lot about Lemon. Had him under
  observation for a while, in hospital, in Delhi. He was a nuisance. Had to
  discipline him. Wasn't mad enough to be locked up, nor sane enough to
  appreciate generous treatment at public expense. I turned him out finally.
  Bulah Singh ran across him by chance on a visit to Delhi and brought him here
  for use as an informer&mdash;not a policeman, you understand&mdash;a mere
  spy, paid hardly enough from the secret fund to keep body and soul together.
  So it was actually Lemon who first drew my attention to Bulah Singh. I
  learned that Bulah Singh was using him for hypnotic experiments. That brought
  Bulah Singh automatically into my special orbit."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Elsa, as if Lewis were the point at issue, not Lemon or Bulah
  Singh. The one word sounded almost like an ultimatum.</p>

  <p>"Trust a woman to ask that question!"</p>

  <p>"Won't you answer it, Dr. Lewis?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." He smiled. "It isn't safe not to answer. You might start thought-
  reading and find out too much! The answer is: we keep track of
  counterfeiters. Hypnotism, unrestrained by moral discipline, and unsupervised
  by science, is counterfeit ambition. That is my phrase. Don't you quote it or
  they'll call you crazy. Ninety percent of hypnotists become so intellectually
  vain and amoral that they think they can get away with anything, murder
  included."</p>

  <p>"Ninety-nine per cent of them," said Nancy Strong.</p>

  <p>"You and I don't agree there," said Lewis. "Anyhow, one thing leading to
  another, we discovered that Bulah Singh was hypnotizing various criminal
  types and making very interesting experiments. He was also using mediums and
  clairvoyants. By the use of suggestion he caused criminals to commit petty
  crimes, of the kind for which they were temperamentally suited. Then he would
  hypnotize a medium or a clairvoyant and command him to detect the crime. He
  soon discovered that the mediums were useless; and good clairvoyants are much
  harder to find. I knew what he was doing, but it was practically impossible
  to get legal evidence."</p>

  <p>Elsa interrupted again: "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because a criminal hypnotist, speaking directly to the unconscious mind
  of the victim, commands the victim to act but to forget who ordered him to
  act, and also to forget the act itself."</p>

  <p>"It's that trick of forgetting," said Nancy Strong, "that makes the whole
  wide world so easy to corrupt. We even forget what prime ministers and
  presidents said last week."</p>

  <p>"We watched Bulah Singly" said Lewis, "on the general principle that the
  deliberate use of secret power over other people always&mdash;always, mind
  you&mdash;arouses appetite for more. It becomes insatiable. In that respect
  it's worse than drink or drugs. The greater the appetite for power, the less
  the respect for truth. It's a self-stimulating vice, especially deadly when
  rooted in experience of actual authority and aggravated by intellectual
  conceit. That's the reason why so-called statesmen are such liars. It wasn't
  long before we uncovered Bulah Singh's little game."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you break him right then?" Andrew objected.</p>

  <p>"For the same reason that we didn't deport Tom Grayne, and you too," Lewis
  answered. "Given time and opportunity Bulah Singh will break himself&mdash;
  beyond the slightest shadow of doubt he'll do that. But meanwhile, if he's
  carefully watched, we can learn even more from him than from you and Tom
  Grayne."</p>

  <p>Elsa moved suddenly, startled: "Dr. Lewis! Do you mean you think Tom will
  &mdash;will break, as you call it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. You're laboratory mice, that's all. Probably all three of you
  will meet your end in Tibet. The job is too big. You haven't a chance. But
  that's your lookout. We're none of us immortal."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, we are," said Nancy Strong. "We all are."</p>

  <p>Lewis smiled at her: "Immortal? In spite of us medical men?"</p>

  <p>"Go on telling about Bulah Singly" said Nancy.</p>

  <p>Lewis nodded. "Yes. If the immortal Nancy gets a word in sideways,
  there'll be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nancy interrupted: "Time, Morgan, time! Tell your story."</p>

  <p>Lewis laughed. "Very well.&mdash;Bulah Singh hypnotized Lemon. He gave him
  Gunning's Luger. He posted him in the hotel corridor and ordered him to shoot
  me if he could catch me alone in Gunning's room. Circumstantial evidence
  would point to Gunning, who would then have to obey Bulah Singh in all
  particulars or else hang for murder."</p>

  <p>"Holy smoke, that Sikh took a long chance!" said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Longer than you guess," said Lewis. "Hypnotism is a boomerang."</p>

  <p>"And, seems to me, you took an even longer chance."</p>

  <p>"Oh no. Rudimentary hypnotism is as unintelligent as money. I was prepared
  for Lemon. When he opened the door and stuck his head through I hit him on
  the back of the neck with a piece of rubber hose."</p>

  <p>"Swell. But he had a Luger! You don't call that taking a chance?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no. I'm an anatomist; I know just where to hit. The rest, of course,
  was quite simple. I fired a shot with the Luger, to make things all nice and
  plausible, lifted Lemon on to your bed, tied him hand and foot, tossed the
  Luger into an open bureau drawer, and phoned for the hotel manager. Hotel
  managers are valuable people if you take care to win their confidence. I
  operated on Mr. Nazareth, years ago, for an obscure spinal complaint. He very
  luckily recovered and has been absurdly grateful to me ever since for not
  having killed him. So we're excellent friends. Nazareth locked the door and
  refused to open it for anyone less than the Chief of Police. Messengers were
  sent to hunt up the Chief of Police. I cleared out, by the back way, while
  Nazareth spread all the necessary rumors. That's all. Except that you are on
  your way to Tibet."</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed. "I'd give something to see Bulah Singh's face when he
  finds Lemon hog-tied on my bed."</p>

  <p>"No chance of that," said Lewis. "Bulah Singh might have suicided Lemon
  with the Luger&mdash;perhaps with the butt end. Hypnotists whose little
  tricks don't work become hysterical. So I turned in an ambulance call."</p>

  <p>"But you said the door was locked," Elsa objected. "If Mr. Nazareth
  wouldn't let them open the door&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lewis smiled: "Never say no to the fire brigade, the inspector of drains,
  or the ambulance man. Lemon is in hospital, safe, under observation."</p>

  <p>"Any chance of getting Lemon to talk?" asked Andrew.</p>

  <p>"I doubt it," said Lewis. "At any rate, not for a long time. He didn't see
  me&mdash;doesn't know who hit him&mdash;had been ordered to forget &mdash;I
  think he'll say nothing of any importance."</p>

  <p>"Take the rap for attempted robbery or some charge like that?"</p>

  <p>"He will probably entertain himself with secret mental pictures of me,
  being killed by him, in all sorts of peculiar ways. After that he will lapse
  into sex-dreams."</p>

  <p>"And will Bulah Singh get off scot-free?" asked Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear girl, what can he be charged with at the moment? If Andrew
  Gunning clears out, as he is about to do, who can accuse Bulah Singh of doing
  what?"</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong chuckled: "Andrew might stay," she suggested. "Put some wood
  on Andrew."</p>

  <p>Andrew chose cedar knots thoughtfully, placing them carefully, thinking,
  thinking.</p>

  <p>"Andrew Gunning goes before daylight," said Lewis, "while the going is
  good. Bulah Singh shall be informed of it." He glanced at Andrew: "I suppose
  he knows your route?"</p>

  <p>"Boasted he did. I guess he knows some of it."</p>

  <p>"Good. He will go his limit to make sure the route is kept wide open for
  you."</p>

  <p>"And do I go with Andrew&mdash;now?" Elsa asked. "All right, I'm
  ready!"</p>

  <p>Lewis stared at her. He looked almost shocked. "Of course not! Nancy
  Strong will turn you over to Mu-ni Gam-po's men. They will smuggle you
  through on their way northward. But we must always save face for the police;
  so Mu-ni Gam-po's loads, that are in the monastery stable with Gunning's name
  on them, will be sent in the wrong direction to give the police an excuse for
  a false hunt. Bulah Singh shall be correctly informed that Gunning bolted and
  left you behind. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Morgan!" said Nancy Strong. "You are too fond of being clever. What you
  actually are, is a romantic fifty-year-old schoolboy. What is to prevent
  Bulah Singh from killing Elsa to stop her from talking?"</p>

  <p>"That's your job," said Lewis.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! How could I protect her? You had better have Bulah Singh
  pounced on now. Think! You have plenty of evidence to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lewis interrupted: "No! No! All women think intuition is legal evidence
  and evidence is proof. Cases aren't cured by suppressing symptoms. No. If
  necessary, but not otherwise, I will try to get Bulah Singh suspended from
  duty for having let Gunning escape across the frontier. But I don't want to
  do even that. Bulah Singh may make some very informing mistake if we give him
  time. He's afraid. A frightened hypnotist is a dangerous fool who is trying
  to ride two wild horses. Their names are Physics and Metaphysics. That man is
  absolutely sure to come a cropper."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Andrew got out of his chair, passed quietly through the gap
  between the bookcases and stood listening.</p>

  <p>"Shutter?" asked Lewis.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Quiet, please, everybody." Andrew walked to the corner window, about
  ten feet beyond where Lewis sat with his back to the bookcase. The closed
  shutter moved. The window opened about two inches. A hand appeared in the
  opening. Andrew grabbed at the hand but missed it.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>A voice answered in a hoarse whisper: "That you, Gunnigun?"</p>

  <p>"Oh. You? Okay. Watch the house. Watch the windows. Wait for me. I won't
  be long now."</p>

  <p>The shutter closed. Andrew closed the window.</p>

  <p>"Your man?" asked Lewis.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Bompo Tsering."</p>

  <p>Elsa jumped up: "Oh, Andrew, let me speak to him, please! Tell him to wait
  a second." She hurried between the bookcases and then hesitated, in full
  firelight, beside the table on which Nancy Strong had set Lobsang Pun's
  portrait.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, at the opposite end of the room, beyond the grand piano, another
  shutter opened, and then a window. Someone fired, straight at Elsa. The
  bullet smashed into the silver-framed portrait, knocking it to the floor with
  a clatter of breaking glass. Elsa stifled a scream as Andrew almost knocked
  her down, shoving her through the opening between the bookcases. He shoved so
  hard that she almost stumbled into the fire. Andrew ran down room toward the
  window. Someone outside slammed the shutter before he was halfway. The
  strangest part was that Nancy Strong didn't move in her armchair. She sat
  silent with her eyes shut.</p>

  <p>"Did you see who it was?" asked Lewis.</p>

  <p>"No," said Andrew. "Stay where you are, Lewis. Don't show yourself. The
  shot may have been meant for you."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" Lewis answered. "No one could mistake you for me, even in
  firelight." His voice had the flat note of nervousness under control.</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong spoke at last: "Andrew, come back here behind the
  bookcase."</p>

  <p>Elsa seconded: "Andrew! Come back! He might try it again!"</p>

  <p>"Just a moment." Andrew stooped for the picture, examined it, shook off
  some loose glass and then strode into the firelight. "Are you superstitious?"
  he asked. He showed the picture to Nancy Strong. There was a bullet hole
  exactly through the middle of Lobsang Pun's forehead.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Lewis, "she is superstitious. All women are."</p>

  <p>"I am not," said Nancy. "Morgan, it is you who are superstitious. I am a
  realist. I was thinking of Lobsang Pun. He was thinking of me."</p>

  <p>Elsa went closer to Nancy to look at her face and at the broken
  photograph. "What do you mean?" she asked. "You were&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The question," said Lewis, "is who fired that shot at Elsa?"</p>

  <p>"Or at me," said Andrew. "The bullet passed straight between us."</p>

  <p>"You men!" said Nancy. "Do you never use your intuition at the right time?
  Elsa, what do you see? Quickly&mdash;don't think about it!&mdash;answer the
  question!"</p>

  <p>Elsa stared for about half a second&mdash;stared into vacancy. Then she
  answered: "Bulah Singh, shooting at you!"</p>

  <p>"That," said Nancy, "is clairvoyance."</p>

  <p>"But it seems all wrong," Elsa objected. "You weren't even in sight from
  the window. Someone tried to shoot either Andrew or me."</p>

  <p>"Trust your vision," said Nancy. "Facts are skittles. Look for the truth.
  Of what use would you be to Bulah Singh, as long as I'm in the way to stop
  him from interfering with you?"</p>

  <p>Lewis confirmed that: "They were in full firelight. Bulah Singh wouldn't
  shoot either of the two people whom he hopes to use for his own ends."</p>

  <p>Nancy spoke with assurance: "Someone who didn't know me by sight, and who
  had not been told there might be two women in the room, had orders to watch
  through the window and shoot me. He mistook Elsa for me. Someone else
  intervened and made him miss."</p>

  <p>No one spoke for at least thirty seconds. Morgan Lewis's monocle was like
  a scandalized question mark. Elsa watched Andrew's face. At last Andrew
  said:</p>

  <p>"Bompo Tsering can't have interfered to spoil the aim. He hadn't time to
  get around to that side of the house."</p>

  <p>"I was thinking," said Nancy, "of Lobsang Pun. He was thinking of me. The
  bullet hit Lobsang Pun's photograph."</p>

  <p>"Lobsang Pun is in Tibet, several hundred miles away," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>Lewis laughed: "Nancy, you still deny that you're superstitious?".</p>

  <p>"It was a coincidence," Nancy retorted, "like when one of your surgical
  cases gets well."</p>

  <p>After that there was silence except for the blustering wind in the chimney
  and the spitting of raindrops on the fire.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER 16</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Andrew went to find Bompo Tsering, letting himself out
  through the front door. The frightened Lepcha servant chained the door behind
  him and then came into the room to ask Nancy Strong for orders. He peered at
  her around the corner of the bookcase. Nancy passed him the silver-framed
  photograph.</p>

  <p>"Put that back on the table, please, Tashgyl. Then sweep up the broken
  glass. Careful! Don't cut yourself."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss."</p>

  <p>"After that pick up the window glass."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss."</p>

  <p>"And tomorrow morning, first thing, tell Jambool to come and put a new
  pane in the window."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss."</p>

  <p>"Are you too frightened to remember your manners? You shouldn't stare like
  that at Dr. Lewis."</p>

  <p>"No, Miss."</p>

  <p>"Very well, don't stare at him. Go and sweep up the glass."</p>

  <p>But the Lepcha servant stood, in the opening between the bookcases,
  staring at Lewis. He seemed unable to move. Lewis got out of his armchair and
  walked toward him. The servant backed away, but Lewis caught the hand that
  held the broken photograph of Lobsang Pun and checked his retreat.</p>

  <p>"Look at me&mdash;straight in the eyes," said Lewis.</p>

  <p>The servant stared, numb with terror. His flat, good-natured face, beneath
  a voluminous turban, expressed no understanding at all&mdash;nothing but
  frightened emotion. It was like the face of a man awakened suddenly from deep
  sleep amid strange surroundings. Lewis kept hold of his wrist:</p>

  <p>"Answer me! Did Bulah Singh sahib, the Chief of Police, ever promise you
  protection?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Said he likes you Lepcha people, and knows what a good, honest servant
  you are?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>"And how loyal you are to your employer, Miss Strong?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Then he asked you questions?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Lots of questions?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>"About your employer?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>"You have a brother in prison?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Did he suggest that he might persuade Miss Strong to befriend your
  brother?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Your brother has a wife?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>"Did Bulah Singh promise to protect your brother's wife until his release
  from prison?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>"But was your brother's wife unfaithful? Did she become the mistress of
  the Japanese Koki Konoe?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, sahib. She not being the mistress. He being her master. She going
  with him, becoming his woman."</p>

  <p>"Where is she now?"</p>

  <p>"My not knowing."</p>

  <p>"Did Bulah Singh suggest that you do know where she is?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib. But my not knowing. No! Not knowing!"</p>

  <p>"Did Bulah Singh tell you I'm dead?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"Just now, sahib, not long ago, when my opening door, letting him in."</p>

  <p>"Did he say that your brother's wife perhaps did the killing; and that if
  you want to keep out of trouble you'd better come and see him at the police
  kana?"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>kana</i>&mdash;police station, police cell.
  Annotator]</p>

  <p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

  <p>Lewis released his wrist: "Do what you were told to do."</p>

  <p>The servant obeyed. He set the photograph back on the table. Then he knelt
  and began picking up broken glass. Lewis touched him on the shoulder. He took
  no notice, went on picking up pieces of glass, which he laid on the palm of
  his left hand. Lewis returned to the fireside:</p>

  <p>"Confusion," he said. "Disassociation of cause and effect. Not that it
  matters, at the moment; but there's your hole in the wall, Nancy. There's the
  leak. That fellow has been so practiced on that when he's scared he obeys
  without thinking. Obedience provides the escape from a feeling of guilt."</p>

  <p>"After fifteen years!" said Nancy. "And they call me a teacher! Morgan,
  can you do anything for him? You must! He has been a good servant."</p>

  <p>"Opiates?" asked Lewis.</p>

  <p>"No. I think not. In fact I'm sure not."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't take opium pills? Bhang? Marijuana?"</p>

  <p>"No. I know he doesn't."</p>

  <p>"Liquor?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"There are other secret vices," said Lewis, "that are equally destructive
  of discrimination. What does he do with his spare time?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Well, I think I do know. I will go into his case history later." Lewis
  turned and faced Elsa. "Now, young lady. Do you see what might happen to you,
  unless you use your God-given faculties?"</p>

  <p>Elsa resented it. She sat upright, protecting herself with a shield of
  indignation that was nevertheless (and she knew it) as full of holes as a
  net, from having resisted Nancy Strong's assault. She was conscious, too, of
  gratitude to Lewis for having come when her baby died. And she knew he still
  could stop her from returning to Tibet. There was no sense in antagonizing
  Lewis. But resentment felt like self-defense. She answered tartly:</p>

  <p>"Am I accused now of secret vices?"</p>

  <p>"Secret sloth," he retorted. "Dr. Lewis, aren't you overdoing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No. I am diagnosing sloth&mdash;inertia, disguised as meekness. It's a
  form of self-indulgence."</p>

  <p>"You, too? Nancy accused me of that. But I'm not meek! I wish I were! I
  don't like meek people. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lewis caught Nancy's eye. She nodded. He faced Elsa again. His air of
  almost jocular familiarity was gone. He seemed almost a different person.</p>

  <p>"Elsa, I am going to repeat to you a piece of advice that was given, two
  thousand years ago, by the greatest of all physicians. The particular patient
  to whom it was given made the necessary effort to understand the advice, and
  had the courage to follow it. I have repeated the prescription to a great
  number of patients. Some accepted it, some didn't. 'Take up thy bed, and
  walk.'"</p>

  <p>Every atom of Elsa's bitterness against the Christian texts that mental
  torturers had used as goads against her in her childhood, boiled to the
  surface. She parried with the first evasive retort she could think of: "Only
  a few hours ago you told me not to get well too quickly."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I know I did. Take it easy. I didn't invite you to run. I said,
  walk."</p>

  <p>Elsa lost control of her temper: "I'm not a paralytic&mdash;and you're not
  Jesus! Why are you talking in riddles?" Suddenly she fell back on the last
  resort of the evader of issues&mdash;silly, literal fact. "If I were, I would
  get up and do as you say, just to make you feel clever."</p>

  <p>Lewis ignored it. "Meekness," he repeated. "Wrapping talents in a napkin.
  Daydreams. Luxury of letting the catastrophe convince you that it's no use
  waking up, and getting up, and doing what you can, instead of being what
  inertia makes you! Wake up!"</p>

  <p>For the moment Elsa couldn't trust herself to answer. She was too
  indignant. Nancy Strong was leaning back in her armchair, with closed eyes,
  stroking the purring cat. Elsa made an effort to appeal to Nancy's professed
  hatred of cruelty:</p>

  <p>"Is this a conspiracy? Are you and Nancy teaming up to make me feel
  sinful? Are you trying to convert me, or convict me, or what? Nancy said I'm
  asleep. But I understood her to mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lewis interrupted: "She meant exactly what I mean. She may have put it in
  different words, but she meant the same thing."</p>

  <p>"I don't think she did," Elsa retorted. "Tell me what you do mean."</p>

  <p>"You are clairvoyant:"</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd cure me of it, instead of talking about it!"</p>

  <p>"Clairaudient, too."</p>

  <p>Elsa snatched at the chance to defend at least one gap in her defenses:
  "Not so often clairaudient. Only sometimes."</p>

  <p>Lewis went on speaking as if she hadn't interrupted: "Nancy Strong will
  show you, far better than I can, how to develop your clairvoyance."</p>

  <p>"I won't develop it! I loathe it!"</p>

  <p>Lewis continued: "Otherwise, 'that which you have shall be taken away.' If
  you leave your talent undeveloped, you will become a victim, just like
  hundreds of millions of others, of every wave of pitiless ambitious malice
  that is turned loose on the world by the ignorant fools and godless egotistic
  devils who create this chaos which we flatter with the name of
  consciousness."</p>

  <p>Nancy opened her eyes: "Gently, Morgan! Gently!"</p>

  <p>Elsa started to speak. Lewis checked her with a gesture. He continued:
  "Only you will be worse than the others. Because you are more sensitive. You
  might even degenerate so far as to become a medium."</p>

  <p>"You mean a spiritualistic medium?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Probably a trance medium. Physical prostitution would be better than
  that. A prostitute, after all, gives no more than her body to be defiled by
  strangers. But a medium's soul is at the mercy of every devil and fool who
  chooses to misuse it. The very least you will become, unless you wake up, and
  stay awake, will be a sort of radio receiving set employed by mischievous and
  godless liars. You might become&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong interrupted: "No, Morgan, no! Not that! Don't frighten
  her!"</p>

  <p>Lewis looked irritated, but he accepted the advice: "Very well, I will add
  this: Elsa, you are of the same stuff that the saints are made of."</p>

  <p>The sudden switch of tactics forced another tart answer that Elsa knew was
  worthless: "I don't feel like a saint, I assure you. I don't wish to be one!
  I feel angry and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lewis interrupted: "A cowardly saint is a social menace&mdash;much worse
  even than a venal doctor, or corrupt judge, or political priest. Fear makes
  saints see wrong visions&mdash;report wrong&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I said, I'm not a saint! I don't want to be one. I'm&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen," said Lewis. "I am your physician, telling you truth, for your
  own good."</p>

  <p>"You mean your good, don't you? I didn't invite this. Why are you doing
  it? Tell your real motive!" 'Lewis ignored that too. He continued, just as
  calmly as if he were treating a painful wound: "Saints, devils and credulous
  fools are made of the same identical stuff. They all have vision. They see
  the same truth from different aspects. Devils exploit stupidity. They create
  blinding fear that gives them power over others. It inflates the devils'
  feeling of importance; and it makes the fools think the devils are the only
  safe leaders to follow. But the vision of saints acts, by its own nature
  &mdash;to use a feeble illustration&mdash;like a prism letting light into the
  darkness. It diffuses the material fog&mdash;the fog that blinds the best of
  us and makes us victims of want, and disease and crime. The vision of saints
  lets in affluence and magnanimity and vigor. Naturally, the devils hate it.
  If they can't pervert saints' vision to their own ends, they try to destroy
  it."</p>

  <p>"Are you trying to tell me that clairvoyance is reliable&mdash;
  dependable&mdash;always true? I know better!"</p>

  <p>"It's as dangerous as truth," said Lewis. "In the hands of a devil a saint
  becomes as subtly malignant as poison gas&mdash;which, remember, is made from
  beneficent ingredients."</p>

  <p>He was interrupted by the front door bell. The Lepcha servant stopped
  picking up broken window glass and left the room in a hurry. Lewis
  continued:</p>

  <p>"The whole world is changing under our eyes, and in our ears. Science,
  sometimes with the best intention, is becoming the slave of the devils, who
  exploit human ignorance for the sake of the sensation of power. The
  exploiters of isms! Communism. Nazism. Fascism. Militarism. Anarchism.
  Socialism. Atheism. Millions of undernourished men and women, stuffed with
  ersatz dialectics and mad promises, massed into goose-stepping armies and
  shouting blasphemy against their manhood&mdash;! What Kipling called 'all
  valiant dust that builds on dust'!"</p>

  <p>"'And, guarding, calls not Thee to guard.' I wonder whether Kipling
  understood his own poem."</p>

  <p>Lewis threw off the interruption: "Up goes the dust, and we can't see. The
  roar, and we can't hear. Blind leaders, leading the blind, produced the World
  War; that was bad enough. Maddened and disillusioned by the World War, its
  victims are producing worse chaos led by devils and fools and false prophets.
  Hitlers&mdash;Mussolinis&mdash;Stalins. Professional liars, to whom truth of
  any kind is treason. They control or suppress schools, pulpits, press, radio.
  They even censor conversation. They are hypnotizing whole nations with fear
  of worse horrors to come. Meanwhile, they pitilessly exploit the victims .
  Victims who don't applaud them as saviors are liquidated or imprisoned for
  having dangerous thoughts."</p>

  <p>Elsa recovered her sense of humor, for just one second: "Dr. Lewis, is it
  as bad as all that? Aren't there any honest people?"</p>

  <p>"It's worse than that," said Lewis. "Because honest people don't know what
  to think. They're being liquidated."</p>

  <p>"Do you believe you know what to think?" Humor deserted her suddenly. She
  felt now like a cat with its ears laid back. She felt as if she were the
  accused, on the spot, a sorceress charged with seducing and betraying the
  human race.</p>

  <p>"Think?" said Lewis. "What fools think is thought got us into the mess!
  Our thought&mdash;our mass-materialism created it. Only vision can get us out
  of it. So wake up! Stay awake! Let some light in! The only hope of the world
  are the individuals who can, and who dare to be saints!</p>

  <p>Religion, science, government, philosophy, economics are all reduced to
  absurdity. The New Dealers are making bad worse. They're putting synthetic
  wine into falsely labeled bottles and calling it ideology. Idiotology! Every
  new ingenious invention, because we're hypnotized by fear, becomes a
  belly-robber and a new false beacon leading to a materialist's synthetic
  heaven&mdash;a new mechanical Utopia full of bombs and lies and
  breadlines!"</p>

  <p>"Whereas the kingdom of heaven is within us&mdash;within reach of us all
  &mdash;here&mdash;now&mdash;if we would look," said Nancy.</p>

  <p>Lewis looked exasperated, Elsa incredulous.</p>

  <p>"But Nancy! Can you see the kingdom of heaven?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes. Since I left off helping to create hell. Reality seems nearer
  &mdash;ever so much nearer."</p>

  <p>"Reality?" said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"If those who can see, won't look," said Lewis, "then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He left off speaking because the door opened. Andrew walked in, followed
  by Bompo Tsering. Andrew, wiping rain off his hair with a handkerchief,
  strode to the fireplace. He glanced at Elsa, then stared at Lewis:</p>

  <p>"Have you been ragging her again?" he demanded. "Can't you let her alone?"
  He turned his back toward Lewis.</p>

  <p>Lewis raised one eyebrow so high that his monocle fell out. He glanced at
  Nancy Strong. She nodded, smiling. Even Andrew was aware that they were
  exchanging comments about him, although he had turned and stooped to put wood
  on the fire, and no word passed between them. Bompo Tsering came and stood in
  the opening between the bookcases. Lewis studied him:</p>

  <p>"So this is Man Friday?"</p>

  <p>Andrew straightened himself and turned his back to the fire. "Yes," he
  said. "I don't want him scared any more than he is. Don't talk metaphysics to
  him. He's superstitious."</p>

  <p>Lewis laughed. Elsa studied Bompo Tsering.</p>

  <p>"Why did you bring him in here?" she asked. She sniffed, then laughed too.
  With the rain on him Bompo Tsering smelt like all Tibet.</p>

  <p>Nancy sighed: "It makes me homesick. But someone please open a
  window!"</p>

  <p>"No!" said Andrew. "Not now. No windows. Please. There's a reason."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER 17</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Bompo Tsering looked shell-shocked. Mistrust of his
  surroundings numbed him. Tibetans are an intuitive people. He could sense the
  spiritual strength of Nancy's hospitality. But he was afraid of it. A legion
  of superstitions crowded his mind. He was afraid of the room. The familiar
  Tibetan things on the walls didn't lessen the trap-sensation. In his
  imagination they increased it. Loot. Scalps. The books were overwhelming
  evidence of occult lore; it might be white, but it was much more likely to be
  black magic. He had seen Andrew's room at the hotel, and the inside of many a
  rich man's house in Tibet; but nothing like this room. Andrew ordered him
  curtly to uncover his head. He obeyed, sheepishly. But curiosity was just a
  bit stronger than shyness: holding his fur trimmed, filthy hat in both hands,
  he thrust his tousled head around the corner of the bookcase. First, he
  recognized Elsa &mdash;stuck out his tongue respectfully&mdash;grinned
  self-consciously &mdash;then repeated the respectful salutation, to Nancy
  Strong&mdash;to Lewis&mdash;with an extra tongue&mdash;show thrown in on
  general principles&mdash;perhaps to the gods of the hearth.</p>

  <p>"Tongue's furry," said Lewis. "Too much starch. Guzzles rice and ghee*
  three times a day. He'll have an enlarged spleen if he isn't careful."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>ghee</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a clarified semifluid butter
  used especially in Indian cooking. <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/17/G0111700.html">The American Heritage
  Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"He'll work that off soon enough," said Andrew. "Uphill all the way. Pass
  beyond pass, and the south side always the steeper. Six days a week. That'll
  cure him."</p>

  <p>"You always rest one day a week?" asked Lewis.</p>

  <p>"Usually. Rest the animals. Give the gang a chance to repair boots, tents,
  harness and settle arguments."</p>

  <p>The conversation was beyond Bompo Tsering's scope of English. He was
  unaffected by it. It meant nothing. He stood smiling, flat-faced, stocky,
  sloe-eyed, bulkily clothed in a wet fleece-lined, padded, long-sleeved
  leather overcoat; it was made bulkier still by the things in his bokkus,
  which is the space between neck and belt where Tibetans stow all their
  portable belongings. There was a small splinter from a saint's thigh bone
  stuck through the lobe of one ear; in the other was a long turquoise earring
  good enough for a nobleman. Around his neck was a twisted coil of parchment;
  it resembled a hangman's noose blackened by exposure to storms and human
  sweat, but it was actually a scroll of beautifully written blessings worth
  ten times the price of the earring.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to talk to him," said Elsa. "May I? Or would you rather I
  didn't?"</p>

  <p>Andrew shook his head: "Later. He has the wind up at the moment. Give him
  a chance and he'll throw a panic, like a caught animal."</p>

  <p>"But why should he be afraid of me?" asked Elsa.</p>

  <p>Nancy asked an easier one: "Why bring him in here? Not that he isn't
  welcome&mdash;but why?"</p>

  <p>"He was afraid to stay outside," Andrew answered. "Swears there are
  dugpas. Scared stiff of 'em."</p>

  <p>"Did he talk?" asked Lewis.</p>

  <p>"Sure he talked&mdash;outside in the dark, because he felt he had to divvy
  up the funk with someone fifty-fifty. But you try to get him to talk now!" It
  was quite obvious, Andrew was rather proud of having been confided in. "Watch
  him try to stop me talking!" he added.</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering's face had become as blank as an old ivory moon&mdash;no
  smile left. His right hand with the thumb between the fingers moved up and
  down almost imperceptibly, from superstitious habit. His real effort to gag
  Andrew was mental&mdash;a darkly invisible psychic force such as passes
  between conspirators or in a courtroom when a witness is expected to betray
  perilous secrets. Elsa spoke up:</p>

  <p>"Andrew, can't we help him? I can see his fear, like a fog&mdash;yellowy
  &mdash;gray&mdash;green&mdash;like a London pea-souper. The poor man wasn't
  as scared as this even when we were cursed by the Black Monks at&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lewis took a hand, speaking Tibetan with an accent learned on medical
  inspection tours in Sikkim. The accent and the monocle together totally
  masked the sympathy which was all that Lewis intended:</p>

  <p>"Tell us what frightened you, Bompo Tsering. Speak. We are friends. We
  won't laugh at you."</p>

  <p>The very use of his name by a stranger aggravated prejudice. Bompo
  Tsering's eyes changed perceptibly. They transferred dark attention from one
  dread to another. Beneath his matted black fringe of hair they suggested a
  yak's eyes, unintelligently ready to stampede&mdash;utterly mistrustful.
  Nancy Strong was watching:</p>

  <p>"No use, Morgan!" Her voice had the finality note of experience. "You
  should have asked his advice. Then he'd have told. I always ask children's
  advice when they're in trouble."</p>

  <p>Lewis smiled wryly: "Mental jujitsu, eh? Good tactics. But it isn't a safe
  plan, always. Try it on some of my patients! Try it, for instance, on Lemon!"
  He turned to Andrew. "Did he say he saw who fired that shot through the
  window?"</p>

  <p>Andrew nodded: "Said he saw a man with his face half covered by a shawl,
  who obeyed a dugpa who lurked in the shrubbery."</p>

  <p>"Did he see the dugpa?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;so he said. He's always seeing 'em. I guess they're part of his
  religion."</p>

  <p>"He is always very brave about them," said Elsa. "Much braver than I am
  about the things that I see."</p>

  <p>"He's more afraid on our account than for himself," said Andrew. "That bit
  of holy shin bone in his ear is all he figures he needs. But we're pelings*
  &mdash;ignorant foreigners who don't know what we're up against. If the
  dugpas should get, for instance, me, bang goes his meal-ticket. Get the
  idea?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>peling</i> (Tibetan)&mdash;a foreigner in general,
  but applied by Tibetans particularly to Englishmen. <a href=
  "http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/etgloss/pa-peq.htm"><i>The Encyclopedic
  Theosophical Glossary</i></a>. ]</p>

  <p>Lewis wiped his monocle with a thoughtful, professional air: "Dugpas," he
  said, "are just as real to a Tibetan as microbes are to me, or to a man with
  influenza. They're exactly as real as the snakes seen by a man in delirium
  tremens. They're a symptom. Swat the snakes, and what happens?"</p>

  <p>"He saw someone," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Of course he did. And his frightened senses lied about it."</p>

  <p>"Every single one of our physical senses is an incorrigible liar," said
  Nancy Strong.</p>

  <p>"Could he have seen Bulah Singh&mdash;" Andrew suggested, "lurking in the
  bushes&mdash;with another of his hypnotized Lemons to do the dirty work?"</p>

  <p>Lewis laughed. "No, Gunning, no! If Bulah Singh were as easy as all that,
  he would have been hanged long ago. Someone in the Lemon category fired the
  shot through the window. There's nothing much easier than for a devil to find
  stool pigeons. You may depend on it: the real culprit was as far from the
  scene as the real conspirators were who directed the shot at Sarajevo."</p>

  <p>Elsa spoke suddenly: "The man in the shrubbery wore a devil-mask! I can
  see it l I can see it now!"</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong frowned: "Nonsense, Elsa! What you are seeing is Bompo
  Tsering's own mental image of what he wants to persuade us that he saw."</p>

  <p>"But, Nancy, how do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Because I saw it when you did. That is how panics&mdash;even wars get
  started. It happens to animals and humans. False mental pictures projected
  from thought to thought by invisible rays of fear."</p>

  <p>"But if that's so, how can one ever know the difference between the real
  thing and a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Child, I told you. Try to remember. If you will insist on believing you
  are a person with a supposititious soul, or no soul, you will always believe
  the wrong thing, because your premise is wrong. Change your premise. It is
  impossible to reason correctly from a wrong premise. If you remember you are
  a soul, and that you have an unreal but persuasively realistic person to wear
  and to manage, as you would manage an instrument, you will soon learn to see
  the difference between truth, and lies about the truth. You will find you get
  increasingly less deceived by tricks of any kind."</p>

  <p>Lewis laughed: "That's a very fair example of the odds against the use of
  clairvoyance for any practical purpose. Who's going to deny his senses?
  That's what it amounts to."</p>

  <p>"It calls for more integrity and courage than most people have nowadays,"
  said Nancy. "It's the hardest work in the world. But it can be done. It has
  got to be done." There came a knock at the door. Nancy Strong got up, looking
  grimly patient. "Trumpet call!" she remarked. "Turn out the guard!"</p>

  <p>The door opened. A woman teacher, wrapped in an overcoat over a dressing
  gown, stood in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Nancy. "I'm coming."</p>

  <p>The door closed again. Nancy approached Andrew. He stood up. "The pistol
  shot," she said, "awakened some of the children in the west building. I must
  go and ask them to advise me what to do when people break my window." She
  held out her hand: "Until we meet again, Mr. Gunning, my best wishes! Your
  secret is safe with me. I hope we have hit on the best way to handle it."</p>

  <p>Andrew nodded gravely as he shook hands. "Anything I can do for you in
  return?"</p>

  <p>"No!" She met his eyes, smiling. "If there's one thing I detest it's to be
  hit with return favors like an actress being pelted with eggs. If I have
  helped you, help someone else when you see the need. Pass it along Don't dare
  to think of me as anything but a window that let the light through. Please
  don't smash me with bricks of hard-boiled gratitude. Good-bye, and good luck
  to you. Come and see me when you return."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering stepped away from her. He faced her with his tongue out,
  staring as if he hesitated between fear and something like reverence. As she
  passed him she tapped his sleeve with her right hand, as one pats a great
  friendly dog.</p>

  <p>"You smell of Tibet," she said, smiling.</p>

  <p>"The blessed, happy, precious land!" he answered. He stood looking at the
  sleeve as if a Bodhisattva* had bestowed a blessing on it.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>bodhisattva</i>&mdash;in Buddhism an enlightened
  being who, out of compassion, forgoes nirvana in order to save others. For

  <p>"Nancy Strong," said Lewis, as the door closed after her, "is the one
  person who can make me feel like a ten-year-old. Gunning, my boy, wish I were
  coming with you to Tibet."</p>

  <p>"Come if you want to," said Andrew. "You'll be welcome."</p>

  <p>"Sorry to have to say no. But you must get going. I'd like a few words
  with you in private before you leave."</p>

  <p>Andrew glanced at Elsa.</p>

  <p>Lewis took the hint: "You will find me in the hall. I want to talk to that
  Lepcha servant&mdash;if he isn't asleep." He walked out. Elsa stood up.
  "Andrew, then this isn't good-bye? It really isn't good-bye? I know it isn't!
  But I want to hear you say it! I feel like two people tonight. One of me
  sings with excitement. The other just doesn't believe."</p>

  <p>"No, it's not good-bye. The monks will know where to find me. They'll
  bring you."</p>

  <p>"But, Andrew, you might have to wait&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll wait."</p>

  <p>"It's strangely easy to believe you, Andrew. But you mustn't wait too
  long. You mustn't let me ruin everything. Delay might prevent you from
  crossing the border. I mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm betting on Lewis and Bulah Singh."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you're not trusting Bulah Singh, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Hell, no. But he wants me in Tibet. If he thinks I'm playing his game,
  he'll clear the tracks. Pretending to leave you behind will make him cocksure
  that he has me by the short hair."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I'm trying to see. I can't see any real danger to you at the
  moment. But&mdash;but&mdash;Bulah Singh is like a shadow that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed gruffly: "That guy's shadow isn't long enough to reach
  beyond the first pass! We'll climb the mountains and forget him. Nancy Strong
  will do your shopping. She'll know how to turn you over to Mu-ni Gam-po's
  party. The minute she says the word, get going. Come after me just as fast as
  those monks can travel. You'll find me waiting for you."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I won't waste a minute. I promise."</p>

  <p>"Okay. But see here." He hesitated. Then suddenly: "Don't let 'em get you
  buffaloed."</p>

  <p>"Who, Andrew? Whom do you mean? I won't even see Bulah Singh. I
  won't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I mean Lewis and Nancy Strong."</p>

  <p>"Hadn't you better speak more plainly? I mean, I want to understand you,
  so there won't be any mistake. I like both of them. I trust them. Don't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I do." Andrew reached for a pine knot and set it carefully on the
  fire. Then, looking straight at Elsa: "Lewis is a good guy. He's a genius:
  darned close to being a nut. He's on the level, but he's haywire on some
  subjects, notably psychic phenomena. Yes him. But keep your feet on the
  ground. Do you understand that?"</p>

  <p>"I think so. All right, I promise."</p>

  <p>"Don't make easy promises. They're too damned difficult to keep. Don't let
  Morgan Lewis sell you any superstitious hokum about your being someone
  special who can magic the rest of us out of hell or any tripe like that."</p>

  <p>She laughed. "That's easy, Andrew. All right, I won't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't promise! Do your own thinking. Keep your common sense hard-boiled
  and on top while you're talking to Lewis."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Andrew, I'll try to. And Nancy Strong? Don't you trust
  her?"</p>

  <p>"You bet. She hasn't a personal axe to grind on other people's problems.
  But don't forget, she's a hot wire&mdash;a government secret agent working
  for the B.S.I. You can't trust anybody farther than the end of his rope. It
  isn't reasonable to take a chance on it."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by rope?"</p>

  <p>"I mean what ropes 'em to the ground&mdash;to the normal, everyday,
  common-sense view of what's right and wrong. The minute they cut that rope,
  they all go rainbow chasing. So stay on the ground. Do your own thinking.
  Watch your step."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Andrew."</p>

  <p>"You don't seem to like the idea."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, it comes like a bit of an anticlimax. It lets out the steam.
  Nancy has been talking quite a lot this evening. I don't think she said
  anything that you would object to, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go ahead. What?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;at first I didn't like what she said. But&mdash;Andrew, you
  know how she talks, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I know. She's a great talker. Well, it won't be long now. We'll
  ram you into a brace of blizzards at fifteen or sixteen thousand feet.
  That'll blow out the illusions. Just try to keep half sensible meanwhile, and
  don't let Nancy sell you Mt. Everest."</p>

  <p>"If you won't let me promise, what shall I say?"</p>

  <p>He laughed. "Say so long and good luck. Let's shake on that and I'll be on
  my way."</p>

  <p>"So long, Andrew. I won't even say you're a brick&mdash;for fear of making
  you angry."</p>

  <p>He looked as if he were going to kiss her good-bye, but he didn't. He
  shook hands. The art of going, instead of talking about going, was one of his
  special accomplishments. He walked away, leaving behind him a sensation of
  finished business&mdash;nothing to be added to, or changed, or undone. Elsa
  gazed at his back as he strode to the door, until Bompo Tsering strode
  between them and followed him like a big, black, smelly shadow, shutting off
  the view.</p>

  <p>Not even a gesture of good-bye from Bompo Tsering. He ignored her, too
  intent in his dog-like devotion to Andrew. Andrew didn't pause at the door.
  He walked through. Bompo Tsering closed it.</p>

  <p>Silence. The crack of the new pine knot on the fire. A leaping flame
  &mdash;and suddenly, out of the shadows, on the small table in mid-room
  emerged the silver-framed likeness of Lobsang Pun&mdash;Old Ugly-face
  &mdash;inscrutably, unconquerably smiling&mdash;with a bullet hole exactly in
  the middle of his forehead.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER 18</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Andrew almost bumped into Lewis. At the far end of the
  hallway at the foot of the stairs the Lepcha servant sat on a chair beneath a
  Tibetan painting of the Buddha. He looked dazed. Obviously Lewis had been
  talking to him.</p>

  <p>"Bad case," said Lewis, glancing at the servant and turning his back.
  "That poor fellow is a sample of secret vice at war with conscientious love
  of his employer. He relies on the one to condone the other&mdash;hides in the
  one to forget the other. But it can't be done. One fights the other, almost
  like a chemical reagent. That leaves him feeling physically weak and morally
  helpless. He craves relief from self-contempt, so he mentally almost leaps to
  meet the first hypnotic influence that comes along. Bulah Singh was like a
  magnet to a bit of scrap iron. Nancy will have a hard time helping that poor
  fellow to rebuild his self-control."</p>

  <p>Lewis was obviously making conversation until Bompo Tsering should move
  out of earshot. But the Tibetan had to be told to go and wait by the front
  door. He didn't mind being told, but he hated to wait; he kept trying the
  lock and fidgeting with the brass check chain. Andrew and Lewis faced each
  other beneath the ceiling light, between the rows of books and photographs.
  Lewis screwed in his monocle. That meant business.</p>

  <p>"Gunning, I'll ask a favor of you."</p>

  <p>Andrew fell on guard&mdash;so visibly that Lewis hesitated. Andrew got his
  own demand in first: "I've a favor to ask, too," he retorted. "An important
  one. I'm dead set on it."</p>

  <p>"Very well, my boy. Yours first. What is it? If it's anything that I
  can&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's easy," said Andrew. "It'll cost you nothing, and put you to no
  trouble. Please leave Elsa's mind alone. Don't aggravate what gives her grief
  enough already."</p>

  <p>Lewis nodded, staring, smiling, as if he were diagnosing symptoms of
  something that Andrew had overlooked.</p>

  <p>Andrew continued: "That's a good girl. She's genuine. She'll come out all
  right if she's given a chance."</p>

  <p>"Good?" said Lewis. He thrust his head forward. "Better than you guess, my
  young friend.&mdash;By the way, we are friends, I believe?"</p>

  <p>"Suits me," said Andrew. "But I'm the enemy of any man, no matter who, if
  he gives Elsa less than a square deal. She's in my charge. For the shortest
  possible time, for the sake of fooling Bulah Singh&mdash;which I take it is
  what you want to do&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Lewis.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;I am leaving Elsa under your protection and Nancy Strong's. I will
  do what I can for you. But, first, I'd like your promise to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lewis interrupted: "Gunning, let me tell you what I have in mind. Perhaps
  we can oblige each other. If we arrive at an understanding, I feel sure you
  will do your part."</p>

  <p>"Shoot," said Andrew. "But mind, I've said my say. You know now what I
  want. It's personal&mdash;nothing to do with any government department
  &mdash;you and me, man to man. Let's keep it so."</p>

  <p>"Very well." Lewis readjusted his monocle&mdash;frowned&mdash;raised his
  right hand and stared at his fingernails. He was about to prescribe. "My
  thought was this. I would like you to promise to stick to your stonewall
  mental attitude about clairvoyance."</p>

  <p>Andrew looked suspicious. "That's an easy one," he answered. "I'm so by
  nature."</p>

  <p>"Superficially, yes, you are," said Lewis. "It's a sort of mask. Actually,
  under the surface, you're a poet."</p>

  <p>Andrew looked even more suspicious. He laughed gruffly: "You're sure
  trying to work me for something big! What makes you think I'm a poet ?"</p>

  <p>"There's a rhythm in your thought," said Lewis. "You can change the meter
  without losing the theme. Besides, I glanced at the books you gave to Mu-ni
  Gam-po. I intend to borrow three of them. It was also my duty to learn what
  books you've sent forward, to read on the march. We check up on people before
  we trust them."</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned: "You only trust people who read Shakespeare? Is that your
  yardstick?"</p>

  <p>"No." Lewis chuckled. "No, my boy. That was counted against you.
  Shakespeare, Sir Thomas Browne, Milton, Chaucer, Einstein and the Bible are
  the world's worst luggage, if you want to be trusted by the world's saviors!
  We official insiders&mdash;we directors of destiny flatter ourselves that we
  can see through beauty to the worms beneath! It's intelligence that all
  censors fear. However, you have good sound vices that offset your virtuosity.
  You're practical."</p>

  <p>"You call it practical to throw up a career and take on this game?"</p>

  <p>"And you've a rare gift of holding your tongue. I could mention quite a
  number of highly placed officials whom you haven't consulted."</p>

  <p>"Hell, I told you all I know."</p>

  <p>"All except just what I needed to know," Lewis answered. "I had to find
  that out for myself."</p>

  <p>"For instance?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, lots of things. Some of them important. For instance, you have
  avoided the mistake of talking to the wrong people. But let's get to the
  point. Elsa is a very remarkable, very unusual girl."</p>

  <p>"I know it."</p>

  <p>"She has character."</p>

  <p>"You're telling me!"</p>

  <p>"There are no available statistics, but it's a conservative guess that
  there are not more than two or three thousand in her class, in the whole
  world. And they're widely scattered. She is an instance of emerging
  evolution. Her spiritual nature&mdash;to use a conventional term for an
  unfamiliar and therefore unclassified state of consciousness&mdash;is like a
  young seedling, of a new species, reaching for the sunlight."</p>

  <p>"You're speaking now of her clairvoyance?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. That's only another word for the same thing. Kill that, and she's
  done for."</p>

  <p>"Hell, she hates it."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Who shall blame her? She's afraid of it. But she must dare to be one
  of the great explorers&mdash;far greater than Columbus. Columbus only
  discovered a continent, in known dimensions. Elsa's greater task is to
  abandon known dimensions and explore what Shakespeare called 'airy
  nothing.'"</p>

  <p>Andrew smiled. Whoever quoted Shakespeare intelligently always passed his
  guard. He almost weakened. "Good stuff, that," he said. "You can't beat him.
  He's still tops. 'And as imagination bodies forth the forms of things
  unknown,' we'll 'turn them to shapes.' Hell, that has Columbus backed off the
  map. But Elsa isn't as tough as Columbus."</p>

  <p>"No," Lewis agreed, "she isn't. She must be protected from mockery and
  from her own mistrust. She needs a line of retreat, so that she can draw back
  in, so to speak, and recover from&mdash;well&mdash;let us call it spiritual
  vertigo. That's a new phrase. I must add that to my list."</p>

  <p>"'Such tricks hath strong imagination,'" Andrew quoted. "What's the rest
  of it? I'm listening."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you use your inner ears. That's why I can talk to you. Now then:
  Elsa's line of retreat must not lead back into her own Cave of Adullam."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Cave of Adullam</i>&mdash;originally an underground
  cavern referred to in the Old Testament in which David, already anointed to
  succeed Saul as king, sought refuge from the latter (e.g. <a href=
  "http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1Sa/1Sa022.html#1">1 Sam 22:1 ff</a>),
  however it is used more generally to refer to groups of political outsiders
  plotting their comeback or the overthrow of the status quo, especially after
  recent defeat. <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Adullam"><i>Wikipedia</i></a>, q.v.
  ]</p>

  <p>"Now I don't get you. That's one of those phrases that might mean
  anything."</p>

  <p>"I mean, she must not draw back into herself&mdash;into her own gloom. She
  must have a different cave&mdash;strong, friendly, and, above all, patient.
  That's a mixed metaphor. However, you will have mixed feelings when I tell
  you that you are the cave."</p>

  <p>"Jesus!" said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"I mean it, my boy. That is why I ask you to maintain your stolid,
  stonewall attitude toward clairvoyance and everything connected with it. Let
  her lean against your imperturbable calm. Whenever she wants to, let her hide
  behind it. Let her feel the uncritical comfort of a friendly anchor to
  windward. That's another mixed one. But the situation's mixed." Then,
  suddenly: "Is she in love with her husband?"</p>

  <p>"Damned if I know."</p>

  <p>"Umm. Are you being frank about that? Well, what I mean is: if she should
  convict herself of treason to her own ideal, there would be no recovery
  &mdash;not in this existence: she would go under."</p>

  <p>"She'll get no encouragement from me to cross-examine herself cuckoo,"
  said Andrew. "I don't believe in that stuff. Gets you nowhere."</p>

  <p>Lewis agreed: "Worse than nowhere. Hundreds of thousands of people damn
  themselves by monkeying with the works. They're like amateurs taking radios
  apart to discover why the program annoys them. Self-examination without
  experienced guidance is worse than taking patent medicines to cure an
  undiagnosed ailment. Much worse. A wrong diagnosis is sometimes a sentence to
  death. Self-conviction of sin is always a sentence to hell. Always. There is
  no exception to that. Before you see Elsa again, she will receive what your
  countrymen call a pep-talk from Nancy Strong."</p>

  <p>"Not from you?"</p>

  <p>"No. I'm a duffer at it. I might do more harm than good. I am merely a so-
  to-speak left-wing medical man. There are more of us than you suspect, but we
  all know we're treading on dangerous ground. We are hampered by conventional
  education, conservative theories, public prejudice, our own ignorance and
  much too much familiarity with evidence that seems to prove the contrary to
  what our intuition tells us is true. Nancy, on the other hand, is an adept.
  She has had thorough training. She knows how to encourage spirituality
  without destroying caution&mdash;how to develop caution without destroying
  courage. That is known, among the adepts, as the Middle Way."</p>

  <p>"I've heard of it," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Yes," remarked Lewis, "you undoubtedly have." He wiped his monocle. He
  was having a tough time. He was actually sweating.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," said Andrew. "I'm listening."</p>

  <p>"So let us exchange promises, you and I. I will not, as you call it, rag
  Elsa. I won't interfere any further with her mental processes even if she
  should ask me to do it."</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned: "I'll bet a dollar, even money, she won't ask."</p>

  <p>"Wait and see," said Lewis. "If she does ask, I will refuse. On the other
  hand, you promise me you will give her the full benefit of&mdash;how shall I
  say it?&mdash;indifference&mdash;friendly indifference."</p>

  <p>"Hell, you're asking too much," said Andrew. "I'm not indifferent, to
  anyone, or anything. Can't help the way my mind works&mdash;wondering how
  people and animals feel&mdash;whether they're right about what they feel
  &mdash;what it's all about, anyhow. It's the God's truth, I've never enjoyed
  another creature's grief nor felt unsympathetic when I saw 'em suffer. How
  does one go about being indifferent?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Lewis, "let's put it this way: you'll be the common-sense man
  with his feet on the earth. If she chooses to be inconsistent, don't
  criticize. Don't care. Don't remind her of it. But if she needs a bone to
  chew on, you provide the matter-of-fact comments for her to tear to pieces.
  If she blasphemes against her own vision, and accuses you of blindness, and
  contradicts herself, you never hold it against her."</p>

  <p>"I never did," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Well. Never do. Because she will." Lewis paused. Then, slowly: "Don't let
  her suspect that you know more than she does about&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"About what?"</p>

  <p>Lewis shut one eye and quizzed him through the monocle: "About the
  consequences of converting spiritual vision into personal sanctity."</p>

  <p>"I don't," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"That's right, my boy, don't admit it. Don't ever confess to Elsa what
  caused you to leave the United States."</p>

  <p>Andrew bridled: "Do you figure you know?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you don't. If you got your dope from Bulah Singh's file, take it
  straight from me, you're all wet."</p>

  <p>"Wet?" said Lewis. "Wet? Is that American for wrong? Well, I have known
  Bulah Singh to be wrong about numbers of things. Are we agreed about Elsa?
  Let us talk now about Bulah Singh."</p>

  <p>"Swell," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"This is secret"</p>

  <p>"Okay. Shoot."</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh is a mere meddler on the fringe of a wide conspiracy."</p>

  <p>"I'd guessed that much," said Andrew. "He's small time. He hasn't the
  stuff to fill a three-ring circus."</p>

  <p>"It's a conspiracy to talk Utopian theory, but to use heartless violence
  &mdash;to throw India into economic and political confusion, and to pull off
  a Fascist coup d'etat."</p>

  <p>"That's easy to believe," said Andrew. "That's the up-to-date style in
  revolutions. The scornful guys all see 'emselves as duces and commissars.
  They're too drunk with their own greed to remember that the up-and-coming big
  boy always kicks 'em in the face when they've hoisted him into the
  saddle."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Lewis. "They forget that. But it's true. Tyrants can't afford
  gratitude. They have to kick away the scaffold&mdash;shoot the men on whose
  shoulders they climbed. However, meanwhile, the conspirators are the men to
  watch. Very few of them guess yet which is actually Number One. Most of 'em
  are betting on 'emselves. Here in India they're counting, of course, on a
  world war to produce world revolution&mdash;doing their utmost to create it
  by the subtlest kind of propaganda. A war that tied up the British Navy would
  be the Indian Hitler's chance."</p>

  <p>"Do you know yet who the big buzzard is?" Andrew demanded. "Have you
  spotted him? Who's to be India's Hitler?"</p>

  <p>Lewis avoided that question by asking another: "How many people would have
  picked Stalin ten days ahead of the time? Napoleon, remember, was a dark
  horse until he saw his chance and seized it."</p>

  <p>"Sure; I get you. If you knew the real buzzard you'd spike him before he
  could get going."</p>

  <p>Lewis drew a forefinger across his own throat. "Right. We have names and
  past performances on file. But it's too soon to tell who'll be Jack-in-a-box.
  There are too many possibles. A few are genuine idealists; they wouldn't last
  a week, but no less dangerous on that account. They serve as stalking horses
  for the others, who will kill them off when the time comes. Most of 'em are
  ruthless, contemptuous rogues, who pose as humanitarians and pacifists.
  Mussolini did that, you remember&mdash;even went to prison for urging Italian
  conscripts to refuse to fight the Turks. Denounced war and nationalism.
  Denounced the Italian flag. But look at him now! All demagogues are
  devils&mdash;all peas from the same pod. Secretly, with scarcely an
  exception, they are Nietzschean individualists, who misunderstand Nietzsche.
  They believe themselves beyond good and evil. They use lies and violence for
  allegedly Utopian ends. No matter what name they assume to camouflage their
  real motives, you may be sure it's a false name. They despise the fools who
  listen to them and believe them. Believing themselves to be intellectuals,
  and aware of their own hypocrisy, they have unqualified contempt for other
  intellectuals. They don't believe an intellectual exists who isn't a
  hypocrite. But they know how to flatter the intellectuals, and how to use
  them, until their time comes. Then they enslave or liquidate them. They know
  the trick of hypnotizing crowds. The crowd's adulation gives them the only
  genuine thrill they ever get. It's a kind of orgasm. They're good showmen.
  They let such fools as Bulah Singh run the real risks, until it's time for
  the big push."</p>

  <p>"Jesus! You should write a book!" said Andrew. "Tell me: what does Bulah
  Singh think he'll get in exchange for the risk he must know he's running?
  What's his real price? I don't believe what he told me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he told you part of the truth. Bulah Singh is a mere ambitious
  meddler. Hypnotic skill is no proof of intelligence. In fact, it usually
  creates such conceit that it blinds and destroys intelligence. But he's
  studious. He knows his book backwards. He thinks, within his mental
  limitations. He understands, correctly enough, that any revolutionary
  government of India would be at the mercy of any Asiatic combination that
  should choose to invade from the north. That is the perpetual menace that
  overhangs India&mdash;always did&mdash;probably always will. That menace
  would be the Achilles heel of any dictator who could seize power. Bulah Singh
  believes he foresees the break-up of the British Empire. He thinks it's
  imminent."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he's right," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>Lewis ignored the interruption. "Bulah Singh's idea is to make himself
  indispensable to the coming dictatorship. He proposes to be the man who can
  diplomatically stave off an invasion from the north&mdash;Mongolian, led by
  Japs or Russians. That's why he wants control of the young Dalai Lama."</p>

  <p>"And you know all this? And you don't dump him into the hoose-gow?"</p>

  <p>"Why catch a minnow and let the pike escape?" Lewis retorted. " We are
  hoping he'll betray the real conspirators&mdash;the real higher-ups&mdash;
  the devils&mdash;the brains behind the mere fomenters of discontent. It won't
  be long now. By about the time you are over the border we rather expect to
  have found out all that can be learned from watching Bulah Singh. If so,
  we'll jump him. And&mdash;to save himself&mdash;we think&mdash;we hope
  &mdash;he will betray his associates."</p>

  <p>"Swell," said Andrew. "Here's wishing you luck."</p>

  <p>"I have told you this in confidence," said Lewis, "for your general
  guidance. You may share the information with Tom Grayne when you meet
  him."</p>

  <p>"Okay. Tom won't yawp."</p>

  <p>"And now this: any help you can give to the Ringding Gelong Lama Lobsang
  Pun will be all to the good but must be kept off the record."</p>

  <p>"Okay."</p>

  <p>"We don't even know where Lobsang Pun is at the moment. He is said to be
  in hiding. But he is the only politically minded Tibetan who can't be bought
  for love or money. He is as incorruptible as Robespierre was, without
  Robespierre's bigotry and mad egotism. We believe he is the one man who can
  save Tibet from anarchy. Find him if you can. Help him in any way you
  can."</p>

  <p>"I'd go out of my way to meet Old Ugly-face," said Andrew. "From what I've
  heard of him he sounds like a cross between King Alfred of the doughnuts and
  Marcus Aurelius. Okay. I'll keep an ear to the ground."</p>

  <p>"If you can do it, help Lobsang Pun to get control of the infant Dalai
  Lama."</p>

  <p>"That might be a tall order."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and dangerous. But don't help Lobsang Pun to bring the child to
  India. That mustn't happen. Personally I would like to have the child in
  Darjeeling, under the influence of Nancy Strong. But that's an impractical
  pipe dream. It would lead to extremely embarrassing complications in addition
  to destroying the Dalai Lama's political influence. Do your best to prevent
  it."</p>

  <p>"Okay."</p>

  <p>"If you come across Ambrose St. Malo, kill him."</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"I've a card in the Live-and-Let-Live Union."</p>

  <p>"How about self-defense?"</p>

  <p>"He'd have to start it. I don't go around encouraging folks to start
  things. If that guy has any horse sense&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He has a horse face. But he's a louse. I should have brought his
  photograph from Delhi. Sorry I didn't. He's described as a louse even in the
  official confidential report that we received from Hongkong."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I've heard that's his reputation. There was talk about him in
  Shanghai. I know his real name. But don't count on me to bump him off. My
  long suit isn't being all that scared that I need to shoot lice. But thanks
  for the tip. I'll watch him."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering rattled away at the door chain, grunting and shuffling on
  the mat like a caged bear.</p>

  <p>"I'll get going," said Andrew, "before Bompo Tsering blows up." He reached
  for his overcoat. "It's a bargain about Elsa?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You'll do your part?"</p>

  <p>"Okay. Don't make me have to wait too long for her. My Tibetans are
  restless. They're raring to go."</p>

  <p>"She shall follow as soon as we're sure that Bulah Singh is convinced you
  have left her behind. That is the important point at the moment&mdash;to make
  Bulah Singh believe you're obeying his orders. That may make him
  overconfident&mdash;he'll make his next move, and we'll catch him."</p>

  <p>"Swell. Don't let Nancy get shot. She's too good to waste on a murderer's
  bullet."</p>

  <p>"We'll protect her."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"By letting Bulah Singh suspect that we suspect him of tonight's attempt.
  He won't risk it again. By the way, have you a gun with you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Mauser."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"In my overcoat:"</p>

  <p>"Registered?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Be careful not to show it. Don't use it."</p>

  <p>"You bet."</p>

  <p>"There'll be men in the shrubbery. Two of them are my men," said Lewis.
  "The other is Bulah Singh's, stationed there to watch you and report your
  movements. Take no notice."</p>

  <p>"Okay. Good-bye. And thanks for the help."</p>

  <p>"Give my best to Tom Grayne."</p>

  <p>"Sure. Any special message for Old Ugly-face, in case I meet him?"</p>

  <p>"Give him my love," said Lewis.</p>

  <p>"Swell. I'll do that."</p>

  <p>"One moment, Gunning. Just one last word of advice! In any emergency,
  remember that one man&mdash;like the fool at Sarajevo with a pistol&mdash;
  can wreck the world as easily as a careless surgeon can kill a patient. So in
  tight places, don't let yourself get hypnotized by appearances. Listen to the
  inner voice. Obey that."</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned genially. "Same to you! Take good care of Elsa."</p>

  <p>They shook hands. "Good luck," said Lewis. "You will find your road to the
  border littered with intelligently unobservant spotters, who have been told
  to mind their own business. You won't be questioned if you just say nothing.
  Don't mention my name."</p>

  <p>"I won't mention any man's name," Andrew answered.</p>

  <p>He strode to the front door. Bompo Tsering opened it and they leaned
  together into a blast of rain. Lewis slammed the door shut behind them, like
  a cannon shot starting the game.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">CHAPTER 19</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Andrew trudged and splashed beside Bompo Tsering, out
  through the front gate and along the high stone wall. He took the middle of
  the road to make sure of being seen by Bulah Singh's spies and to avoid the
  extra drenching from the overarching trees. A Ford car, badly in need of
  paint, loaded above window level with the dunnage that Elsa would need, stood
  parked in an alley.</p>

  <p>Curled on the loads was another of Andrew's men&mdash;a gaunt, dish- faced
  countryman from somewhere north of Koko Nor&mdash;homesick for the sky-high
  steppes where he was weaned on wild ass meat and barley. He said nothing.
  Even when Andrew turned a flashlight on him he said never a word. Andrew
  climbed in and took the wheel. Bompo Tsering scrambled to the front seat
  beside him. The chilled, damp engine started at the eighth or ninth try.</p>

  <p>"So! By-um-by, at last. Our going!" said Bompo Tsering. To use English was
  the only way to get on even terms with Andrew. It was condescension&mdash;a
  polite hint that Andrew's Tibetan was something less than perfect. "Oh, the
  happy, blessed country! By-um-by soon there now."</p>

  <p>Andrew was unresponsive&mdash;busy peering through the storm for wash-
  outs on the winding road. But Bompo Tsering was in talkative mood, which was
  a fact well worth making note of, after his recent dumbness.</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun." He never could master the pronunciation of Andrew's name
  &mdash;had given up trying&mdash;had renamed him.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Your being peling&mdash;" He paused for effect. Peling means foreigner: a
  comprehensive word, as packed full of significance as the Greek word
  <i>barbaros</i>&mdash;"too much often many times your doing damn-fool
  thing."</p>

  <p>"This time not doing. My much happy."</p>

  <p>"Forgotten your dugpas already? Left 'em behind, eh? Not scared of 'em
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Dugpas being only spirits&mdash;can manage. Something else being much
  worse too bad. My thinking, making sorry. By-um-by now, your not doing,
  making too glad."</p>

  <p>"What were you thinking that made you sorry?"</p>

  <p>"Your sending me my buying all this more stuff. My obedient. My buying.
  But my thinking this more stuff must meaning Ladee Elsa coming also! Uh-uh!
  No good. My sorry. Too much damn-fool God-damn saying no-no! Also catching
  maybe 'nother baby&mdash;no good&mdash;no good! Uh-uh! Too much bad
  trouble&mdash;bad luck."</p>

  <p>"She never hurt you, did she?"</p>

  <p>"My 'fraid before. Now she not coming, my too much happy."</p>

  <p>In proof of his high spirits Bompo Tsering began singing an endless
  nostalgic wail about the wonders, sacred and profane, of the Home of the
  Gods, on the Roof of the World, where the blessed snow&mdash;and dust-storms
  hide the holy treasures from the eyes of pelings, and the fortunate count
  their blessings beneath skies of azure. It was a good song, no more
  mendacious than the latest Broadway and Hollywood smash hit. He made it up
  himself, and believed every word of it, singing in time to the slap of a
  broken link against a rear mudguard; singing in the rain, in the dark, with
  his heartstrings thrumming like a harp within him to the call of his cruel
  homeland. The gaunt man from Koko Nor joined in the chant, selecting phrases
  that he liked and repeating them over and over, forcing Bompo Tsering to do
  the same, so that the song became a weirdly measureless duet.</p>

  <p>Andrew preferred that to conversation. He could think through the song
  without listening to it. Conversation might have made it difficult to hide
  the tart sub-flavor of the memory that Bompo Tsering had opened a window of
  Nancy Strong's house, only a few moments before someone else fired a shot
  through the opposite window, missing Elsa by less that a foot. There was mud
  on the boots of the man from Koko Nor. There was no imaginable reason why
  Bompo Tsering should be Nancy Strong's enemy. But by Bompo Tsering's own
  admission, it was a relief to believe that Elsa was staying behind. The
  truth, like Bulah Singh's spy in the bushes, was lurking somewhere amid dark
  facts. It seemed worth discovering.</p>

  <p>The smashing of Old Ugly-face's photograph, and Nancy Strong's conviction
  that the bullet had been meant for herself, were subjects for a kind of
  speculation that Andrew was in no mood for. Rain, and his job at the wheel,
  induced no taste for the occult, though he couldn't avoid it. Even less to
  his taste would be to question Bompo Tsering and be regaled with
  circumstantial lies or, worse yet, irrelevant lies, like red herrings drawn
  crosswise on the trail of facts. Steering through the storm suggested the
  kind of thinking that was needed. As methodically as he had laid all his
  plans for the journey, he reviewed the facts. The hard ones. The bulky, lumpy
  ones with sharp outlines. They were like the milestones on the road. The
  essential, first, number one fact was that he didn't want to get rid of Bompo
  Tsering. The man was as indispensable as he could afford to let one man be.
  The shot had fortunately missed, so there was no murder to avenge. It had
  missed at slightly above stomach level, to the left. Bompo Tsering was a bad
  shot, who almost always missed high right. Besides, Bompo Tsering had
  certainly not had time to run from one window to the other and fire the
  shot.</p>

  <p>The rain and the roar of cascading water aided concentration on the
  problem. Attention to the dark road, the almost automatic alertness at pedals
  and steering wheel, produced a black-out of all unrelated thoughts&mdash;
  almost like a blackboard, on which Andrew chalked in white the facts that he
  selected one by one, of which the first was the mud on the boots of the man
  from Koko Nor. It was the wrong color to have come from the place where he
  loaded the car. It was the color of the flower-bed earth in Nancy Strong's
  garden. Perhaps a coincidence. More probably proof of guilt.</p>

  <p>But the man from Koko Nor was an ignorant herdsman, secretive by instinct,
  who would do what he was told. He was tolerably patient, but certainly prone
  to violence if told the proper story. Bompo Tsering could have told it.
  Andrew knew more facts about Bompo Tsering than the latter suspected.
  Originally Tom Grayne's headman and only loaned to Andrew for the journey,
  Bompo Tsering's loyalty to Tom was indisputable. It held unplumbed depths of
  selfless devotion, only qualified by Tibetan indifference to Western views of
  what is important and what isn't. Andrew's own loyalty to Tom, which had a
  different basis, had been nevertheless a bond of union between himself and
  Bompo Tsering&mdash;a sort of bridge across which gradually some of the
  Tibetan's loyalty had transferred itself to Andrew. So divided allegiance was
  a fact to be carried in mind. Bompo Tsering was quite capable of sabotage for
  what he might believe was for Tom's or Andrew's own good. And there was more
  than one fork to the divided allegiance; quite a number of forks, all of them
  likely to confuse and distort the reasoning of an otherwise faithful headman.
  Andrew's mental blackboard began to be chalked up with the "knowns" of a
  compound equation that made the "unknown" look insoluble. But order came out
  of them after a while.</p>

  <p>For instance: Bompo Tsering was a devout Tantric Buddhist, happy in his
  religious convictions, superstitious to the verge of devil worship, and
  amused&mdash;not horrified, but moved to laughter&mdash;by the discovery that
  other people, and especially pelings believed in ridiculous other religions
  or possibly none. Bompo Tsering's actions, especially when he had time to
  think about them, frequently were guided by a wish to scandalize and mock, as
  well as to serve and instruct his ignorant employer. Literal obedience, even
  good smart discipline, wasn't difficult to get from Bompo Tsering up to a
  point that varied with the occasion; but his subtle reasoning processes could
  invent and justify extremely tricky means of gaining secret ends without
  incurring much risk of detection. That fact went up on the board while Bompo
  Tsering got out to remove a fallen tree from the road and got in again after
  tying a prayer rag to a bush as a precaution against having to repeat such
  disagreeable labor. Pelings can't be taught that it is invisible devils who
  make the difficulties, so that all one needs to do is to forestall the devils
  with fluttering scraps of rag.</p>

  <p>He resumed his song when Andrew got the car going again. He sang now about
  a legendary sorceress who merited death but was blessed by a holy hermit, so
  that she changed her mind, and became harmless, and so escaped the arrow of
  ill fortune that her previous misdeeds had launched against her on the
  bowstring of the Higher Law. The man from Koko Nor grew silent. Andrew noted
  the fact and the words of the song; he connected the two, and went on
  thinking about Bompo Tsering.</p>

  <p>There was Bompo Tsering's domestic situation to consider. His love life,
  such as it was. That was another divided allegiance&mdash;between local
  tribal custom and the almost universal Buddhist contempt for women, nowhere
  recommended in the Ancient Teaching, but invented, like the doctrine of
  original sin, by sex-obsessed ecclesiastics, who relegate women to the
  category of dogs and other graceless lingerers on the Path to Bliss. But
  there are notably extreme exceptions. Bompo Tsering was one of several
  brothers all married to the same woman; she was priestess, wife and matriarch
  in one&mdash;an almost absolute tyrant, whose husbands took turns at home and
  spent the intervals wandering, working, earning to support their common
  proprietress.</p>

  <p>So Bompo Tsering had mixed views about women. Probably he believed&mdash;
  although Andrew had never discussed it with him&mdash;that Tom and Andrew
  shared Elsa in some such domestic design as his own. Certainly his mental
  attitude toward Elsa was mixed of contempt and respect; veiled and made
  indistinguishable by his Tibetan good humor and by his conviction that it
  doesn't much matter what pelings think or do, as long as they don't steal
  Tibet. He had even found it amusing to obey Elsa when it wasn't too
  inconvenient. But he was rather self-conscious about it, rather ashamed. And
  he had never made any secret of his superstitious prejudice against women on
  expeditions. As such they were bringers of bad luck. So the fact went on the
  blackboard with the others, that Bompo Tsering felt no important loyalty to
  Elsa. There would be room in his consciousness for almost any other emotion
  that the circumstances, or a prejudice, or someone, might suggest. Who might
  be the someone? Who could have persuaded him to cooperate in the attempt to
  shoot Elsa? He undoubtedly had not fired the shot. But he certainly did cause
  the diversion that brought Elsa into full view from the opposite window. Was
  that a coincidence?</p>

  <p>Several possibilities crowded into Andrew's mind. He rejected at once, as
  too improbable, the idea that Bulah Singh might have hypnotized Bompo
  Tsering. And it was a certainty that Bulah Singh did not want Elsa murdered.
  But it was no secret from Andrew that one of Bulah Singh's spies had been
  camping all winter on Bompo Tsering's trail, had lost money to him, and had
  had a thousand opportunities to suggest that secret favors beget favors in
  return. Tibetans have a passion for intrigue; they always crave what is
  withheld and over-reach themselves to get it, enjoying the bartering more
  than the actual profit. That spy might easily have convinced the homesick
  Bompo Tsering that Bulah Singh could close the passes into Tibet against
  every member of Andrew's party, unless compensated by a valuable proof of
  reciprocity, paid in advance. Such talk would have tickled Bompo Tsering's
  undisciplined loyalty. It would have awakened his delight in mysterious
  byplay. It would have spurred his eagerness to get started homeward. It would
  have excited his high opinion of himself as a diplomat. The nicely motivated
  murder of anyone of whom he disapproved would no more trouble Bompo Tsering's
  conscience, than it would Bulah Singh's. Tibetans are pious people, but they
  amazingly indulge in clandestine trickery for which the threatened penalty,
  in which they thoroughly believe, is millions of years in a merciless,
  fantastically realistic hell. They behave as if they want to go to hell.</p>

  <p>But there was this difference: the Sikh was unsentimental; he hadn't any
  of the juice of magnanimity. Bompo Tsering, on the other hand, would be
  unlikely to murder anyone against whom he had no ground for fear, mistrust or
  hatred. Bompo Tsering wouldn't murder Nancy Strong. But to cause Elsa to be
  killed because, in his opinion, she might bring bad luck, might seem to him a
  praiseworthy act, especially if the idea of killing someone&mdash;anyone
  &mdash;were suggested to him, in the first instance, by the agent of a man
  whom he had reason to fear. Scruples have a way of disappearing under
  pressure&mdash;squeezed out.</p>

  <p>But fear of Bulah Singh might also&mdash;almost certainly would&mdash;
  inspire a delicious, amusing desire to doublecross that gentleman. It would
  be a typical Tibetan reaction to a blackmailer's effort to make him a
  cat's-paw. Loyalty to Andrew&mdash;certain knowledge that Andrew detested
  Bulah Singh&mdash;would be an added inducement to put a hot one over on the
  Sikh.</p>

  <p>Andrew watched for a chance to discover whether his thought was leading in
  the right direction. During a pause in the endless song Bompo Tsering spat
  through the window and then shot a question:</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun! Why you not being much happy, same like we making singsong?
  Blessed happy land soon by-um-by not too far."</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking about Bulah Singh" said Andrew. "He might overtake us."</p>

  <p>The reaction was instantaneous. Bompo Tsering unbosomed himself of triumph
  that came like steam from a safety valve. There was pressure behind the
  words. He selected them, from Andrew's special vocabulary reserved for use in
  tight places, when yaks and ponies give up and men malinger:</p>

  <p>"Hot damn! Son of a bitch! Bastard! Bugger no good! God-damn cockeye! Kick
  'um!" Then, profoundly mysterious: "Gunnigun! You by-um-by no more caring
  about Bulah Singh. My fixing 'um. So. Hot damn!"</p>

  <p>Inexperience would have thrust into that opening with sharp questions. But
  Andrew knew his man. The half-hint, that had steamed off the kettle of truth,
  was a relief to Bompo Tsering's nerves; but it was also a trick to discover
  what line Andrew's thought was taking. If Andrew had betrayed even veiled
  curiosity, the truth would have retired into its hole like a mouse that
  smells cat. The right strategy was to change the subject.</p>

  <p>"Watch for leopards," said Andrew. "The headlights dazzle 'em. If one of
  'em should get out from under the wheels in time, he'd likely as not jump in
  on us."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering began singing about leopards. Andrew resumed his review of
  the facts.</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh believed Elsa was staying behind. But Elsa would be no use to
  the Sikh while under Nancy Strong's protection. Nancy Strong was in Bulah
  Singh's way. She probably knew or guessed too many of his secrets. She had
  very likely offended him deeply; she was notorious for befriending victims of
  police brutality. It wasn't in the least improbable that Bulah Singh wanted
  Nancy Strong murdered, and wanted the job done at exactly the right moment to
  coincide with other moves on the board. He was evidently a time-table
  plotter, and pretty good at it. The bullet might have been meant for Nancy
  &mdash;might have been&mdash;in the beginning. But artful beginnings often
  have boomerang ends.</p>

  <p>Not to be wholly ignored was Nancy Strong's conviction that the shot had
  been intended for herself. The photograph business was beyond the pale of
  Andrew's tolerance; he didn't let his mind go wandering into that
  metaphysical swamp. But he did trust Nancy's intuition. He had good reason to
  trust it. Her bare word that she knew the bullet had been meant for herself
  was at least as good as anyone's who might choose to contradict her. Only so
  far there was no proof! The bullet missed. Had it been aimed at the wrong
  target, contrary to someone's orders?</p>

  <p>If Bulah Singh, personally or through his agent, had supplied Bompo
  Tsering with a pistol and had persuaded him, by threats and promises, to
  shoot Nancy Strong, then it was not unthinkable that Bompo Tsering might have
  told off the man from Koko Nor to do the job, but to shoot Elsa instead. His
  oriental mind would calculate that after the event Bulah Singh would be too
  deeply implicated to dare anything except to smother enquiry and expedite the
  expedition's departure northward in every way possible. A bit subtle. A bit
  complicated. But not too improbable.</p>

  <p>It would explain Bompo Tsering's almost irrepressible triumph. He might
  even have been clever enough to contrive that Bulah Singh or his agent was
  overheard when he made the murderous proposal&mdash;or to make the Sikh think
  he had been overheard. He might believe he had completely outwitted Bulah
  Singh&mdash;by instructing the peasant from Koko Nor to shoot Elsa, not
  Nancy. Tibetans can't be expected to think of everything. It had probably
  never occurred to Bompo Tsering that Elsa's death by an assassin's bullet
  would have blown all secrets galley-west and have made the return to Tibet
  impossible.</p>

  <p>Andrew wondered how much Lewis had guessed, or suspected, or knew about
  that shot through the window. He rather wished he had questioned Lewis about
  it. The man was a nut. Any man who can run a bughouse&mdash;and study
  hypnotism and world politics&mdash;and be an authority on poisons&mdash; and
  boss a very important branch of the secret intelligence&mdash;and believe in
  Jesus&mdash;couldn't be anything else than a nut. But he was a good guy. He
  liked Lewis&mdash;trusted him.</p>

  <p>On the whole, things began to look good. Even the rain was an asset, like
  a curtain at the end of a first act.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20">CHAPTER 20</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Nancy Strong returned from the school building by the back
  entrance. Near the foot of the stairs she handed her oiled silk raincoat and
  umbrella to the Lepcha servant.</p>

  <p>"Put those away, please, and then go to bed."</p>

  <p>He obeyed like an automaton.</p>

  <p>"Have you forgotten how to speak?"</p>

  <p>"No, memsahib."</p>

  <p>"Good night, then."</p>

  <p>"Good night, memsahib."</p>

  <p>She watched him hang up the coat and slouch away to his own quarters,
  turning off the light in the back hallway. He vanished through a swing door.
  As she faced about she found Lewis beside her. She was startled. Lewis
  appeared not to notice the nervous reaction; he was putting away a small
  memorandum book, taking care that it didn't show above the edge of his vest
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"Nothing much left of that poor fellow," he remarked. "You had better turn
  him out to grass. He's a psychic wreck. He'll be a physical wreck in next to
  no time."</p>

  <p>"Where did you come from so suddenly?"</p>

  <p>"I've been using the phone in your office. But about that Lepcha&mdash;
  why not send him home to his village?"</p>

  <p>"Leave him to me. Did Andrew Gunning get away safely?"</p>

  <p>"Away, yes. Safely, if he has it in him. Good fellow. I like him&mdash;
  intelligent&mdash;never tells what he's thinking about unless he expects to
  be understood. Doesn't expect to be understood too often. By the way, Nancy,
  you'll get quite a phone bill. Please pay it, and send me a memorandum. I'll
  settle with you off the record."</p>

  <p>"Very well. You will find your bag in the corner guest room."</p>

  <p>"Is that a hint?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly. Your bag is locked, so the servant couldn't unpack it for
  you, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lewis held up a warning finger. His voice dropped to a dramatic whisper:
  "Nancy, I hardly dare to trust even myself with the secrets in that bag!"</p>

  <p>"Sherlock Holmes! Where are your pipe and magnifying glass?"</p>

  <p>"You mean, where's the needle! Why not say it?"</p>

  <p>"I have just come from talking to children. I advised them to go to sleep.
  Why don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Sleep? God and the devil and doctors work at all hours, Nancy. I must
  wait up for my shadow. Is the back door open?"</p>

  <p>"No. If your shadow bangs on it he'll wake the children again.
  So&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nancy, if my man heard himself make more noise than a cat's ghost, he'd
  die of shame. However, to save you from anxiety, I will go and wait for him
  near the back door."</p>

  <p>"Take that chair with you and be comfortable."</p>

  <p>"Right. By the way, hadn't you better send Elsa to bed? That girl is a bit
  overwrought. A mild sedative might&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Meaning, I suppose, that you want to talk to me alone?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;time's short. Yes. There's something&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why not say it now?"</p>

  <p>"Very well. You know what it is. I've asked a dozen times. However, I'll
  say it again. Our friend Johnson, of the Ethnographic Survey, was retired
  because he was beginning to know too much. Some traitor behind the scenes was
  afraid of him. Who is the traitor? Name him!"</p>

  <p>"Morgan, you are too clever, and not wise enough. Have you forgotten about
  the devil who said his name was Legion? You're a physician. You and St. Luke
  should understand each other."</p>

  <p>"That's an evasive answer, Nancy. You are not being frank. It's out of
  character&mdash;and beneath your dignity."</p>

  <p>"Oh? Familiarity has bred contempt? Am I to choose a scapegoat for your
  baffled vigilance? Whom do you wish me to betray?"</p>

  <p>"Nancy, please be serious."</p>

  <p>"I can't be when you are in that mood."</p>

  <p>"It's black treason. Possibly a member of the Council. One of our own
  race."</p>

  <p>"The human race? Well? Did you ever hear of a political, or any other
  council of human beings that lacked a traitor or two? You, a
  psychologist?"</p>

  <p>"Psychology be damned! We're too late for that stuff. This is hard fact,
  if we can lay a finger on it. It's a defeatist conspiracy, well hidden, by
  someone powerful enough to protect such parasites as Bulah Singh, and swine
  enough to bet on a world war, and a revolution in India, with a front seat
  for himself at the finish. He might be any of three men."</p>

  <p>"Or of a thousand," said Nancy. "I told you. His name is Legion."</p>

  <p>"You know who he is. Name him!"</p>

  <p>"I know the three men whom you suspect. I think you're wrong. Those are
  three self-important nobodies with sly minds. Place-holders&mdash;
  Sycophants. They play politics like a game of bridge and quarrel across the
  table. They can be manipulated by almost any artful man who understands what
  snobs they are. Cowards. Sail-trimmers. They have no real convictions&mdash;
  no vision&mdash;no integrity. In a pinch they will play safe. Mice."</p>

  <p>"Rats!" said Lewis. "Which is king rat?"</p>

  <p>Nancy smiled engagingly: "Fleas are deadlier than rats, and you know it.
  Fleas spread the plague that rats catch from corruption in the dark. Why not
  use flea powder?"</p>

  <p>Lewis suppressed his irritation. He stuck to his point: "It wasn't those
  men's parasites who torpedoed Johnson. They did that."</p>

  <p>"Don't flatter them," Nancy retorted. "They didn't think of it themselves.
  They didn't invent spite any more than rats invented bubonic plague. Someone
  with a poisonous whisper suggested to those three wise mice that pet cat
  Johnson was intriguing to get them out of office. There was some truth in it,
  too. Johnson wasn't always innocent of malice, and he loved the sensation of
  power behind the scenes. They turned on Johnson. It was three to one, with
  one of Johnson's most tactless mistakes in the scale against him. I know that
  because he told me about it. I had dinner with him, in Delhi, the night
  before he left for England."</p>

  <p>"Did he say who the poisonous whisperer was?"</p>

  <p>"No. He knew no more than you do."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't he guess?"</p>

  <p>"I don't repeat embittered people's guesses."</p>

  <p>"Fair enough. But tell me your guess. Whom do you suspect?"</p>

  <p>"I think perhaps Bulah Singh knows."</p>

  <p>Lewis's irritation began to break through the crust. "I am asking
  you!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"You do know. You may have no factual knowledge. No legal evidence. That's
  quite likely. But you've the psychic gift of a human bloodhound."</p>

  <p>Nancy laughed outright: "Morgan, that's the most ingenious paraphrase for
  a vulgar epithet that I ever heard. Go to the head of the class."</p>

  <p>"You know very well what I meant, Nancy."</p>

  <p>"I guessed it, Morgan. It filtered through."</p>

  <p>"Here: I'll be frank with you. Two men's wives have been to see you
  lately. One was a banker's wife from Calcutta. If the big money is in on this
  &mdash;but of course it is! It always is. Tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Morgan, money hasn't any brains. So bankers' wives are less reliable than
  ayahs.* Besides I have told you again and again, I will not betray
  confidences. People come to me with their troubles for private, not public
  reasons."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>ayah</i> (Hindi from Portuguese)&mdash;a native
  maid or nursemaid in India. <i><a href=

  <p>"You've a public duty," said Lewis.</p>

  <p>"Do yours. I will do mine," she answered. "Take the chair with you. And
  please don't let your shadow, as you call him, wake the children."</p>

  <p>She left him standing. Lewis set his jaw and ground his teeth at her back.
  She shut the living-room door with a revealing thud that made him grin. It
  gave him some comfort to know he could make her angry. There weren't many who
  could. She switched off the light as she entered the room. Elsa stood up,
  rubbing her eyes. She had been staring at the fire.</p>

  <p>"You're tired?" Nancy asked. "Like to go to bed? It's very late."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't sleep," said Elsa. "But I don't want to keep you up."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Put some wood on the fire. I have to wait for Morgan Lewis.
  Sit up with me and protect me from him."</p>

  <p>"Are you joking?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But the joke is on him. As long as you are in the room he can't ask
  questions. Tell me about Andrew."</p>

  <p>They sat facing each other, in the warm, red, comfortable book-framed glow
  of firelight. The cat sprang into Nancy's lap.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing left to tell. One always knows how Andrew will behave.
  Unsentimental&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nancy's smile interrupted, but she made no spoken comment.</p>

  <p>"Nancy, he is! He's the most unsentimental but dependable friend in the
  world. He just said 'So long' and walked out. Bompo Tsering followed him like
  a dog."</p>

  <p>"No advice? No information?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes. I'm to do whatever you tell me. I will, too. I've promised. And
  I'm to 'yes' Dr. Lewis: that's American for praise God but keep your powder
  dry. I'm to overtake Andrew as soon as I possibly can. Nancy, do you think
  Andrew is in danger?"</p>

  <p>Nancy made herself comfortable in the armchair. She closed her eyes for a
  moment. "What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"I told Andrew. I'm not sure he liked my telling him. At the moment, no,
  no danger. But he hasn't finished with Bulah Singh. There's a link. I saw it.
  I see it now."</p>

  <p>"What does it look like?"</p>

  <p>"Like a dull red rope from Bulah Singh to Andrew. When I get a mental
  picture of them, there the rope is. Only of course, it isn't a rope. It's
  more like one of those moon rays on rippling water. But it isn't like that
  either.&mdash;Oh, I can't explain it."</p>

  <p>"Don't try," said Nancy. "I saw it too. If you try to explain too
  definitely, you will get lost in definitions, like a music critic writing for
  the penny papers. People will take you literally and make unanswerably stupid
  comments."</p>

  <p>Elsa smiled mischievous agreement: "Good! That's the first easy advice you
  have given me! I won't try to explain!"</p>

  <p>The house was as quiet as a tomb. The fire glow made the silence cordial
  and comforting and snug. The cat purred. Nancy sat still for several minutes
  and then suddenly resumed, in a quiet, assured, unemphatic voice:</p>

  <p>"If you do try to explain, you will convince no one&mdash;not even another
  clairvoyant unless he is trying to help you&mdash;and even then not always.
  That is why people who know, don't tell, unless they're teaching someone who
  they know can learn. No two mental pictures are alike, because no two human
  beings are alike. The point is, what do the clairvoyant pictures mean in
  terms of common experience?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's something like translating Tibetan or Sanskrit into
  English?"</p>

  <p>"Only more so. More like calculus into mechanics."</p>

  <p>"Well, I think the red rope probably means that Bulah Singh will keep
  after Andrew, and stick to him like a leech, and make trouble for him, but
  not on this side of the Tibetan border. Bulah Singh is afraid. He intends to
  cling to Andrew somehow. When I look at Bulah Singh there seems to be a
  menace around him, too, coming from every direction except one. He keeps
  looking in that one direction. Oh, what a beast Bulah Singh is!" She
  shuddered.</p>

  <p>"It's fortunate you said that."</p>

  <p>"Why, Nancy? How do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Because it reveals a viewpoint."</p>

  <p>"You mean Bulah Singh's?"</p>

  <p>"No. Yours. Your attitude. Do you know any mathematics?"</p>

  <p>"No. I can't even add. Simple quadratic equations are as far as I got, and
  I was no good at those."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. Shakespeare was no good at them either. Neither were
  Joan of Arc or Beethoven. They say Einstein can't balance his own bank
  account. We must think of some other way of illustrating what I want to
  explain."</p>

  <p>"Try plain English," Elsa suggested. "I can think in English&mdash;or at
  least&mdash;" she laughed&mdash;"you've made me feel that perhaps I can't
  think."</p>

  <p>Nancy stared at the fire. "Let's suppose," she said after a moment, "that
  what I told you tonight is the truth."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I remember most of what you said. I half believe it until you
  go out of the room. At first I felt angry. But I don't any longer. I rather
  like it. I would like to believe it."</p>

  <p>"Believing," said Nancy, "is no good. None whatever. As I said before,
  anyone who believes can disbelieve. But one who knows can't not-know."</p>

  <p>"How in the world can one know?"</p>

  <p>"In the same way that you know you are, when you say I am. Try it. You can
  change what you see in a mirror by changing what the mirror reflects and
  distorts and reverses. You are not the reflection. You are your soul. Leave
  off believing you are your reflection. I use motion pictures to explain it to
  the children. The moving figures on the screen are not the figures on the
  film. The figures on the film are not the actors. Even the actors are not the
  author. And even the author is not the idea. You are your soul. You are not
  what Morgan Lewis calls a sanguinary mechanism. That mechanism isn't you at
  all. Identify yourself with your soul&mdash;I am my soul; I am not its
  material shadow. You will soon know you are telling the truth, because truth
  proves itself. One step at a time, you will learn to trust your spiritual
  vision."</p>

  <p>"But, Nancy, surely there was nothing spiritual about that glimpse of
  Bulah Singh? It was cruel&mdash;guilty&mdash;afraid, hanging on to Andrew. It
  was worse than reality."</p>

  <p>"It was only spiritual in the sense that it wasn't confined to the normal
  three dimensions. It was Bulah Singh's own secret thought of himself, hidden
  behind the false face that he presents to the world. Your eyes didn't see it.
  But you saw it. What did you do about it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see what you mean. What could I do? I did nothing."</p>

  <p>"Your timid consciousness was looking at his predatory thought. Both on
  the same plane, to use a phrase that doesn't mean much. That is more or less
  what happens when strangers meet and suddenly become friends or enemies.
  Without realizing it, they get a glimpse of each other's consciousness.
  People who are good choosers of subordinates unconsciously possess that
  faculty. Some of them consciously possess it. It explains most cases of love
  or enmity at first sight. Being far more clairvoyant than you realize, and
  almost wholly untrained, you had a glimpse of Bulah Singh's thought. You half
  interpreted a danger, and recoiled. You were like an ostrich. You stuck your
  vision back into the nice safe sand of the Desert of Don't Believe and hoped
  you wouldn't get your tail feathers pulled. What good does it do you to have
  seen the danger?"</p>

  <p>Elsa laughed. "Yes, you're quite right. That's what I did do."</p>

  <p>"You recoiled. You refused to look. What good was it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose at least I'm warned against Bulah Singh. What should I
  have done?"</p>

  <p>"Not what you did, my dear. We have to learn to be practical. Unapplied
  theory is the same as faith without works. It is worse than dead. It is a
  decomposing spiritual poison. If you were alone in a room with Bulah Singh,
  could you defend yourself against him from a physical attack?"</p>

  <p>"No. He's muscular. I'm sure I couldn't."</p>

  <p>"What would you do?"</p>

  <p>"Yell for help and try to escape."</p>

  <p>"Good. Bear that answer in mind. We will return to it presently.
  Physically, you admit he is too strong. Your muscles against his muscles
  would be useless. Do you believe your thought can defend itself against Bulah
  Singh's thought any better than your person could defend itself against his
  person?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, now you're talking about mind over matter?"</p>

  <p>"No. Thought against thought. Thoughts can't run away from each other. Are
  you naive enough to suppose that your peace-pursuing thought can defeat Bulah
  Singh's predatory will by merely looking at it and being horrified?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean&mdash;I don't quite&mdash;say that again."</p>

  <p>"No. Try another illustration. Can a Jew in Germany defend himself from
  outrage by knowing and fearing the greedy mendacious malice of the Nazis'
  motives?"</p>

  <p>"No. I suppose not. No, of course not. It must feel to a Jew something
  like an inundation to the Chinese when the dikes break on the Yellow River
  &mdash;helpless&mdash;nothing they can do about it&mdash;nothing. I've been
  reading about the German Jews in some books Andrew lent me. I've been
  wondering what the Jews could do about it. I can't imagine. I can only feel
  sorry for them.&mdash;But what did you mean about thoughts can't run away
  from each other?"</p>

  <p>"Well. Can you imagine it? The Jews can't run away from the Nazi
  persecution. They are trapped. They can't get passports. The Chinese can't
  escape the inundation. They have no transportation, and nowhere to go. Even
  more so, twice three can't run away from six times one. Six wins and the
  other figures lose their independence. It is simply useless to deny it."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, what awful pessimism!"</p>

  <p>"That is realism, not pessimism. Thought is much more powerful than any
  other force in nature. But thought can't escape, first from words and
  symbols, and then from physical expression. It creates them. It builds
  pictures in the thinker's mind&mdash;patterns that guide the person that
  obeys the impulse. There is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed.
  Thoughts find expression in deeds, sooner or later, without any
  exception."</p>

  <p>"Aren't any thoughts secret?"</p>

  <p>"None&mdash;not in the long run."</p>

  <p>"I can very seldom read yours, or Andrew's, or Mu-ni Gam-po's. Just now I
  seem to know what you are going to say before you say it, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cover, conceal, delay the transmutation of thought into act, and you
  merely increase the potential violence. Unless you know how to transmute that
  violence, then what? Oppose thought against thought and what possibly can
  happen but collision?"</p>

  <p>"I've never thought of it," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Think of it now. Oppose a pacifist's motorcar to an invading armored
  train. What happens?"</p>

  <p>"Someone buries the pacifist."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Oppose a recitation of the Sermon on the Mount against an air
  raid on Barcelona. What do you get?"</p>

  <p>"Massacre!" said Elsa. "Women and babies blown to bits&mdash;airmen
  getting good salaries&mdash;plenty of people remarking that the Sermon on the
  Mount is a damned lie. Who should blame them? I don't think they're
  blasphemous. They pray to God for mercy, and the answer is bombs&mdash;
  butchery."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you taking it too much for granted that they did pray?" Nancy
  answered. "They did not pray. That was the trouble. From the beginning of the
  world until now, no genuine prayer ever went unanswered, instantly! Or was
  ever answered without humor, beauty and loving-kindness, that blessed and
  cursed not! Prayer doesn't consist in opposing thought against thought, creed
  against creed, self-righteousness against self-righteousness&mdash;bogey
  against bogey&mdash;fear of defeat against lust for victory. If you oppose
  your thought against Bulah Singh's, what are you likely to get?"</p>

  <p>"Defeat, I suppose," said Elsa. "I never did want to fight anyone. I want
  to be let alone. I'm sure I haven't enough hatred in my system&mdash;at
  least, I hope I haven't&mdash;to be able to out-hate a Sikh hypnotist! It
  looks as if we're up against that gruesome law of the survival of the
  fittest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fittest for what?" Nancy retorted. "What do you wish to be fit for? Pork
  or poetry? Destruction or creation? Degradation or evolution?"</p>

  <p>"I would like to know what good talking about evolution and religion does
  for the victims of bombs and blackmailers!"</p>

  <p>"There is no need to be a victim. Remember the Ninety-first Psalm: 'A
  thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand, but it
  shall not come nigh thee.'"</p>

  <p>"But, Nancy, that's horribly selfish! I would rather be a victim of almost
  anything, than be some kind of special person who felt superior
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Gently, child, gently! You are not being asked to be a special person.
  But don't you want to help? Can the dead stop the massacre?"</p>

  <p>"No, of course they can't."</p>

  <p>"Can selfishness stop it?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps enlightened selfishness might lead to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To a jack-o'-lantern's quicksand! The way to enlighten selfishness is to
  realize that only believers in the illusion of personal self can possibly be
  selfish. They can't avoid it. But the selfish soul doesn't exist. It would be
  a contradiction in terms."</p>

  <p>"Well, suppose that's true. How can one help? By talking? They'd call it
  propaganda. Talk never stopped people from hating each other. It makes them
  hate each other all the worse."</p>

  <p>Nancy laughed. "Well, I am talking to you! Are we hating each other? My
  dear, a victim, no matter of what&mdash;even a victim of his own generosity
  or his own greed&mdash;is someone who opposed some form of violence, either
  with lesser violence or with the wrong strategy: One is as useless as the
  other. Wars are good illustrations of that. The very best that can be said of
  any war is that it is bravery wasted."</p>

  <p>"Then do you teach passive resistance? Non-resistance?"</p>

  <p>"No. Far from it. I teach vigorous assault on cause, and let the symptoms
  take the consequences. I don't look for peace where there is none."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, you're too fond of paradox. I wish you'd say what you mean in
  plain words."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Listen."</p>

  <p>"I am listening."</p>

  <p>"There are three states of consciousness."</p>

  <p>Elsa glanced at the shelf beside her. "But Freud says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Forget Freud for the moment. Some of those books are there to remind me
  to forget what is in them. Freud, Jung, Adler and scores of others have made
  brilliant discoveries of what happens to people who base their outlook on
  what appears to them to be the reality of personal material existence. They
  have discovered some of the mechanics of the illusion. They try to patch up
  and strengthen the illusion. We propose to weaken it, by letting go of it.
  Then evolution takes care of us. I will give you the key to the secret of
  evolution. Lobsang Pun taught it to me."</p>

  <p>"You mean this is secret?"</p>

  <p>"It is a key to the secret."</p>

  <p>"Why is it secret?"</p>

  <p>"Because people who are too convinced of the reality of what is known as
  sensual perception, and who think that intellect and intelligence are the
  same thing, can't possibly understand it until disaster takes the conceit out
  of them and they begin to be humble and humorous and a little bit wise,"</p>

  <p>"Very well. I will try to be humble. What is the secret? Surely whoever
  knows it should tell it."</p>

  <p>"I said it is a key to the secret. There are several other keys, but this
  is the simplest. The secret reveals itself when you use the key. For all
  practical purposes there are three states of consciousness."</p>

  <p>"I do hope you're not going to use a lot of confusing terms that mean
  something different to whoever uses them."</p>

  <p>"No. Plain words. From, at, and toward.&mdash;If you prefer it, call them
  subconsciousness, consciousness, and superconsciousness."</p>

  <p>"That sounds too simple," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"It is. Much too simple for the brain-believers. It amounts to an insult
  to what pride calls intellect. It doesn't take much intellect to perceive
  that a bomb kills; a lie hurts; an empty purse can't buy; hunger isn't
  satisfying; a cold doorstep isn't a warm home. Even demagogues and other
  lunatics can elaborate that picture and make it worse. But it does require
  real intelligence to see and to use the beautifully, humorously simple
  remedy."</p>

  <p>"What do you call intelligence?" Elsa asked.</p>

  <p>"I call for it," said Nancy. "I don't have to define what it is. I let it
  define me. I demand it&mdash;from superconsciousness. True intelligence is an
  inseparable dimension of superconsciousness&mdash;instantly ready, available
  to everyone who asks."</p>

  <p>"Can you make that clearer?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Wake up and know! Subconsciousness is the storehouse of the mass
  illusion. Let Freud have it. It is the mist mentioned in the first chapter of
  Genesis&mdash;the common memory pool&mdash;the pool of the Narcissus myth. It
  contains every detail of all the past history of all the people who ever
  lived in the world. All that they have ever imagined, believed and done. It
  is continually being added to, every minute. It holds all the false answers
  to all the false questions. It is a logical, merciless law unto itself, as
  full of fear as a sea is full of water. Jesus called it the lie and the
  father of lies. The Hindus call it maya. Plunge into it&mdash;stay in
  it&mdash;and there you are. Drown in the disgusting ocean of illusion. It's
  useless to ask mercy of that stuff or to ask it to cure its own corruption.
  Subconsciousness is the source of instinct, behaviorism, habit. And that
  includes the habit of death&mdash;a very bad habit, but there it is. We must
  evolve out of it, upward."</p>

  <p>"Into superconsciousness?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Superconsciousness is life. The rest is shadow. There is no
  illusion, and nothing false, in superconsciousness. Intelligence, affluence,
  humor, spontaneity, beauty and selfless love are inseparable dimensions of
  superconsciousness. It is the source of genius and perpetual newness. Soul-
  consciousness&mdash;that is to say acceptance of the truth that now, not
  tomorrow but now, we are our souls&mdash;opens the door of
  superconsciousness. From the moment when we accept the truth that we are
  living souls, not dying persons, we begin to evolve spiritually. Then, if we
  demand more, and more, we become masters, not victims. The illusion of
  selfishness gradually dies. Love replaces it. It's so simple that in the
  beginning we can't keep it in consciousness for more than seconds at a time.
  But those are precious seconds. They increase and expand, as we enjoy them
  and learn to depend on them. We become more and more soul-conscious, less and
  less stupid. Our consciousness becomes a lens through which reality pours
  into the world. That is the meaning of Jesus' promise:'the works that I do
  shall he do also; and greater works than these.'"</p>

  <p>"Then you really believe what it says in the Bible? We can raise the dead,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nancy laughed. "Gently, child, gently! Let us raise the living first.
  Reform ourselves, and then see what happens. There'll be another world war
  and a relapse into barbarism, unless thinking stops it. So let us think.
  Remember Shakespeare's line: 'There is nothing either good or bad, but
  thinking makes it so.' It all takes place in consciousness. So let's change
  our own first. We can let our consciousness drift downward, or raise it
  upward by an effort of will. But it has to be good will."</p>

  <p>"You talk of sub- and super-, but what is plain consciousness? You haven't
  defined that."</p>

  <p>"I wish you understood mathematics. But never mind. Remember from, at, and
  toward. Subconsciousness is from. Superconsciousness is toward. Consciousness
  is at: the relatively real point at which you are at any given moment,
  varying as you sink into the subconscious illusion&mdash;or rise toward
  superconscious reality. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>Elsa curled up in the armchair, staring at Nancy, wondering why she had
  never noticed before that Nancy looked like a lama. She had seen more than
  one lama with similar facial expression. True, most Buddhist lamas, excepting
  Lobsang Pun and Mu-ni Gam-po, had seemed to her no better&mdash;perhaps
  worse, and more self-righteous than the vicar at home, if that were possible.
  Whereas Nancy&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It seems clear when you say it," she answered. "But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Think now of your mental picture of Bulah Singh."</p>

  <p>"I saw his thought. Yes. What should I have done about it?"</p>

  <p>"You yourself gave the correct answer when we spoke of your being alone in
  a room with him. You should have yelled for help and escaped! That is exactly
  what I did, when I suddenly knew that shot was coming through the
  window."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, you old prevaricator! You never made a sound! I screamed, when
  Andrew nearly pushed me into the fire. I'm ashamed of it. But you didn't. You
  sat still in your chair."</p>

  <p>"My dear, I yelled. It was so sudden that I hadn't time to do anything
  else."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, are you dreaming?"</p>

  <p>"I was dreaming, at that moment. I was actually thinking of the children,
  all tucked away in the dormitories, wondering what they were dreaming about.
  I awoke with a clear picture of the danger&mdash;and yelled for help."</p>

  <p>"None of us heard you."</p>

  <p>"I didn't yell to any of you," Nancy answered. "I cried with all my
  conscious might for help from superconsciousness. It never fails. It can't
  fail. Remember Isaiah: 'But it shall come to pass that before they call, I
  will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.' I and my soul
  were one, that moment, and I knew it. And you know what happened. 'Thou shaft
  not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by day.'
  Answer: was anyone hit?"</p>

  <p>"Poor Old Ugly-face's photograph&mdash;oh, I beg your pardon, Nancy. I
  mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I usually call him that," said Nancy.</p>

  <p>"To his face?"</p>

  <p>"No. Of course not. But he prefers to bethought of as Old Ugly-face. That
  lets in some humor. It avoids the very human tendency almost to deify one's
  spiritual teacher. Solemnity is only a humbug substitute for love and
  reverence."</p>

  <p>"Nancy! Tell me! Had that shooting of the photograph anything to do
  with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nancy laughed. She shook her head. "Elsa, I don't know. I could believe
  it. The lower consciousness is as full of tricks as a stage magician. But
  guessing isn't believing, and believing isn't knowing. I haven't told you
  anything tonight that I don't know of my own experience."</p>

  <p>"You seem confident."</p>

  <p>"Yes. So confident that&mdash;" Nancy almost chanted St. Paul's
  declaration of faith&mdash;"'neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
  principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
  height, nor depth, nor any other creature' could persuade me to the
  contrary.'"</p>

  <p>"Those are grand words," said Elsa, "but they didn't save St. Paul from
  being shamefully executed by the Romans."</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose he suffered for being right, or for having done wrong?"
  Nancy retorted. "It isn't often wise to argue from the consequences of other
  people's mistakes. It's more useful to remember the work they did well
  &mdash;spectacularly well! St. Paul's work has survived the Roman Empire. Is
  it dead yet? Far from it! Perhaps St. Paul hadn't quite learned how to
  forgive himself for previous mistakes. He may have felt glad to settle his
  own karmic account for having himself been a bigoted and cruel persecutor
  before he woke up and became a saint. St. Paul himself said: 'there is none
  righteous, no, not one.' He was a brave little Jew, pressing, as he described
  it, 'toward the mark for the high calling ... not as though I had already
  attained, either were already perfect.'"</p>

  <p>"Then what you teach doesn't pretend to change the consequences of&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>"It pretends nothing, Elsa. It is the illusion of materiality that
  pretends, and makes false promises, and glitters with false causes and their
  consequences. Truth is the only creator of anything real. Truth never begets
  ill results, and never lets you down. Never! Truth doesn't rob Peter to pay
  Paul. It doesn't have to. It couldn't. Acceptance of truth into consciousness
  is spiritual evolution; it drives out the legion of lies. Falsehood and false
  consequences vanish, like darkness before daylight, no matter how deeply they
  are rooted in human thought. But it's a process. It takes time, because we
  are so full of conceit. However, if we are going forward, we are not going
  backward. The thing is, to be up, and awake, and on our way."</p>

  <p>Elsa leaned forward. "Tell me. Will it&mdash;if I try to follow your
  advice&mdash;will it bring some real love into Tom's life?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, excellent!" said Nancy. "Full marks!"</p>

  <p>"Why? What do you mean? What have I said?"</p>

  <p>"Think it over. There's another question at the back of your mind. What is
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew. How can I repay Andrew for all his utterly unselfish
  kindness?"</p>

  <p>"Are you sure it was unselfish?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'm almost sure he secretly detests the very ground I stand on. Why
  shouldn't he? I've been nothing but a nuisance. But there isn't one thing
  that he could possibly have done, to make things easier for me, that he has
  left undone. Isn't that unselfish?"</p>

  <p>"Well then, why try to repay him? How could you? It's only selfishness
  that accepts repayment. I'm not talking about borrowed money, or the give and
  take of commerce. But can you repay the sun for its warmth? No! Pass it
  along. Reflect it. Be kind to others."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, wouldn't it be in line with your ideas if I could somehow help
  Andrew to unburden himself of his secret? I know he has one. It makes him
  wretched. It is eating his heart out. He keeps it hidden beneath a dark gray
  cloud that I can't ever see through. Sometimes the cloud is the color of dry
  blood. But it's usually dark gray. Do you suppose I could help him?"</p>

  <p>"You might mind your own business," Nancy suggested. "That always
  helps."</p>

  <p>"But you said just now&mdash;I mean&mdash;don't you help people?"</p>

  <p>"When they ask for it&mdash;with all I have!&mdash;to the limit." She
  laughed. "But there is no limit! The way to help people in the dark when they
  ask for it is to demand light on one's own darkness&mdash;the light of true
  intelligence. But bad spiritual manners are worse than a common cad's. There
  is nothing likelier to make people resentful and vindictive than to squirt
  them with light like a fire hose. You may believe that's light, but it isn't;
  it's conceited bigotry. It's worse than prodding a tiger. Do you want to deal
  with a tiger?"</p>

  <p>"I wish to God I could help Andrew."</p>

  <p>"Has he asked for it?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then wait. And meanwhile, mind your own business. I have suggested what
  that is. If you genuinely trust your vision, and distrust your senses, your
  vision will improve, and your senses will become subordinate instead of
  enslaving you as they do all of us when we let them. You will discover that
  your higher vision not only illumines your own consciousness but also acts
  like a beacon that enables others to find their own way."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, I don't like it. It seems tome self-righteous, and top-lofty,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear, can't you be generous enough to accept Andrew's generosity? Must
  you bask in self-approval? Or is it applause that you can't do without?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I don't want applause. But I would love to help Andrew. I want to
  reverse things just for once, and be some good to him instead of being
  beholden to him for almost everything. Nancy, I even owe my life to him."</p>

  <p>"You don't like having the conceited meekness pricked like a bubble, and
  humility put in its place?"</p>

  <p>"I said, I'm trying to be humble. Really, I'm trying."</p>

  <p>"Humility, my dear, is no respecter of persons, especially of our own
  persons. Humility doesn't even pretend to know the answer to other people's
  problems. Humility demands wisdom, from the only source whence wisdom comes.
  And humility receives it. Always. Conceit never does. Subconsciousness is an
  incorrigible liar, without humility. But humility imposes self-discipline.
  That creates self-respect, which reveals the difference between our false,
  lower habit-nature and our true Being&mdash;our soul-consciousness. That in
  turn creates reliance on soul-consciousness. We begin to have dignity&mdash;
  to know what dignity is. Enjoy that&mdash;I said, enjoy it&mdash;and then
  Soul, which is You&mdash;will employ your person so wisely that you will
  betray no one, and harm no one, and no prayer will go unanswered; it will be
  fully answered, with more and better than you asked, because you will
  discover how to pray, and how to become unselfish."</p>

  <p>Lewis knocked on the door. He came in, startling, preoccupied, carrying
  something. "May I turn on the light?" he demanded. His voice was on the dead-
  level professional note. Without waiting for an answer he switched on the
  light and came forward to the fireside. In his left hand was a muddy Mauser
  pistol. He began to wipe it with his handkerchief, holding it to the overhead
  light.</p>

  <p>"One, three, two, three, eight, three," he remarked. "Nancy, we'll need to
  do some thinking. This is one of those hard facts that&mdash;but wait a
  moment while I check it."</p>

  <p>He laid the pistol on the mantelshelf and consulted the small memorandum
  book from his vest pocket.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, returning the book to his pocket, "that is the number of
  Andrew Cunning's pistol that was registered last autumn when he crossed the
  border on his way southward."</p>

  <p>There was silence for a moment. Elsa turned deathly white. The cat jumped
  to the floor and began licking itself, stopped doing it, and crept under
  Nancy's chair.</p>

  <p>"It's a fortunate thing," said Lewis, "that my man found this pistol. One
  of Bulah Singh's spies is searching for it now in the shrubbery. Bulah Singh
  planned this. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nancy and Elsa asked the same question, simultaneously: "Where was the
  pistol?"</p>

  <p>"In the mud under the window. Whoever fired it, dropped it there and ran.
  No fingerprints; he trod it into the mud to make sure of that."</p>

  <p>Elsa spoke in a strained voice. "May I see it?"</p>

  <p>Lewis passed it to her.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "it is Andrew's. That's his mark on the butt. It must
  have been stolen from him."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately," Lewis answered, "Gunning told me, in the hall before he
  left, that this pistol was in his overcoat pocket."</p>

  <p>"Then he must have thought it was," said Elsa. She handed the pistol
  back.</p>

  <p>Lewis corrected her sharply: "Pardon me. He must have known it wasn't in
  the pocket the moment he picked up his overcoat. The pistol is heavy and
  bulky. He would have missed it at once. He must have known it wasn't
  there."</p>

  <p>Nancy spoke quietly: "Morgan, you are so tired that circumstantial
  evidence begins to look to you like proof."</p>

  <p>"Very well," he answered. "What do you make of it? The deadly circumstance
  is, that Gunning knew that pistol wasn't in his overcoat. He lied. Why?"</p>

  <p>"If he did lie, it would be the first time since I have known him," said
  Elsa. "Besides, why should he lie to you?"</p>

  <p>Lewis stared at her. "Andrew spent an hour alone this evening with Bulah
  Singh," he answered.</p>

  <p>Elsa stood up. She looked very small confronting Lewis, but not afraid,
  although her face was ghost-white. Her scandalized eyes defied him. She spoke
  deliberately, like a witness in court:</p>

  <p>"Dr. Lewis, if you are suggesting that Andrew has been hypnotized by Bulah
  Singh, you are mistaken."</p>

  <p>"How do you know? Clairvoyance?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! I know what happened!"</p>

  <p>"Gently, gently!" said Nancy. "Betray no one. Harm no one."</p>

  <p>Elsa turned on her: "Am I to be silent when my friend is accused of lying
  &mdash;and I know what happened? I mayn't help him, mayn't I? If that is what
  your teaching amounts to, then I don't believe in it. Am I to protect a
  criminal, and let Andrew be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lewis took Elsa's hand. "We are all tired," he said. "You more than any of
  us. Sit down."</p>

  <p>She obeyed, too angry to speak back.</p>

  <p>"There is this," said Lewis, after a moment's pause. "Gunning's man Bompo
  Tsering might have sneaked the pistol from the overcoat pocket. He could have
  put something else in its place, to make Gunning believe the pistol was still
  there."</p>

  <p>Elsa objected: "He couldn't have! Bompo Tsering couldn't have! He didn't
  come into the house until Andrew brought him in, after the shot was
  fired."</p>

  <p>"True," said Lewis. "Yes, I forgot that. And then again, why should Bompo
  Tsering want to shoot you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know! I don't know!" Elsa buried her face in her hands.
  "Bompo Tsering didn't fire the shot! I know he didn't."</p>

  <p>"Someone did," said Lewis. "If the pistol was used without Gunning's
  knowledge or connivance, who stole it from him, and how, and when?"</p>

  <p>Nancy answered him: "Treason has a way of betraying itself. Quiet, both of
  you. Listen."</p>

  <p>There was silence for a few seconds, then a knock at the door.</p>

  <p>Nancy raised her voice: "Come in."</p>

  <p>The Lepcha servant entered, quietly closing the door behind him. His eyes
  were wide open, but he seemed drugged, or asleep, or in a trance. His turban
  was awry, but he was otherwise presentable.</p>

  <p>"Remember," said Nancy, in a low voice. "No one was hurt. We have the
  pistol. No one can use it to blackmail Andrew or anyone else. There is no
  need for cruelty."</p>

  <p>"No. Nor for credulity," said Lewis. "He isn't sleepwalking."</p>

  <p>The Lepcha came slowly forward, looking neither to the right nor the left.
  He knelt and put the last two pine knots on the fire. Then he turned toward
  Nancy and sat at her feet, cross-legged. No one spoke for at least a minute,
  until Nancy asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you stay in bed, Tashgyl?"</p>

  <p>"Too much bad spirit, memsahib."</p>

  <p>"Bad dreams?"</p>

  <p>"No, memsahib. Not dream. No sleep. Spirit."</p>

  <p>"Falling back into your old superstitions, are you? Which spirit was it
  this time? The thief spirit?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, memsahib."</p>

  <p>"Have you been obeying the thief spirit?"</p>

  <p>He nodded. Nancy signed to Lewis to bring the pistol nearer. "Did you take
  anything out of Gunning sahib's overcoat pocket?"</p>

  <p>The Lepcha nodded.</p>

  <p>"Did you put something else in its place?"</p>

  <p>He nodded again, as if he didn't remember until he was asked.</p>

  <p>"Is that what the thief spirit told you to do?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, memsahib."</p>

  <p>"What did you do with what you took from Gunning sahib's overcoat?"</p>

  <p>He seemed unable to remember. He looked blank. Nancy signed to Lewis to
  show him the pistol.</p>

  <p>"Is this it?"</p>

  <p>He suddenly remembered&mdash;nodded&mdash;looked relieved.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, the thief spirit has been outwitted. He has gone away now
  &mdash;gone forever. He won't come back. So you needn't worry about it any
  longer, Tashgyl, need you? No harm was done. The thief spirit will never
  again give you secret orders. So go back to your room, and this time go to
  sleep. I will talk to you in the morning. Good night."</p>

  <p>"Good night, memsahib."</p>

  <p>He got up and left the room. There was silence again, except for the
  ticking clock on the mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be damned," Lewis said suddenly. "Nancy, you're a witch-
  finder! So that's how Bulah Singh works it! Of course, as a policeman, he
  knows more than most people do about Lepcha superstition. Thief spirit,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"This helps," said Nancy, "to explain what we have discussed several
  times. All thieves, without exception, no matter what their race or education
  or religion, and no matter what they pretend to believe or disbelieve,
  subconsciously worship a thief spirit that commands them and sometimes
  protects them. It creeps into consciousness under all sorts of disguises, but
  it is always the same old tempter&mdash;the old prehistoric tribal bogeyman.
  Until it is recognized for what it is, there's no cure. Any criminal
  hypnotist can take advantage of it, although when he does it, the hypnotist
  is himself obeying the old bogey. However, now I think I can cure
  Tashgyl."</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh mustn't be left at large any longer," said Lewis. "God knows
  whether we can make a criminal indictment stick. But it's high time to jump
  him. I'll have it done, before he&mdash;" He hid a yawn behind his hand.</p>

  <p>Nancy stood up. "Go to bed, Morgan. You are tired out. Let us all go to
  bed."</p>

  <p>"Good idea. My man is watching the house. Leave the light on in the hall.
  I'll put the fire out. Good night, both of you. See you in the morning."</p>

  <p>Elsa was sitting with her face between her hands, but she got up after a
  moment and followed Nancy to the door. Outside in the hall she took the older
  woman's arm.</p>

  <p>"Nancy, I was so rude to you that I can't think what came over me. I
  wasn't even telling the truth when I said I didn't believe. I do believe. I
  want to know. I will know. I promise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no! No promises!" said Nancy. "They are so easy to make. But keeping
  such promises is the most difficult thing in the world. And breaking them is
  worse than heartbreak. Much worse. So don't promise. Just do. And when you
  fail, just try again. We made a good beginning tonight. We were fortunate to
  have such a simple example. I hope you enjoyed it. I did. And thank you so
  much for protecting me from Morgan Lewis's questions."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21">CHAPTER 21</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Rain. Rain. Rain. The mechanical miracle that no one gags at
  nowadays: gas-driven wheels. Thirty miles an hour, where, less than a
  generation ago, three were unthinkable. Lewis was right: no questions were
  asked. Andrew was right too: no names were mentioned. In three days, Andrew's
  car, loaded above window level, traversed the fantastic length of Sikkim
  without challenge, but with intervals for rain, and rest, and business. Rain
  is a dimension of Sikkim: length, breadth, scenery and rain: a hundred and
  forty inches a year against the mountain sides, and much more in the jungle,
  where Nature is still profligately building and destroying the foundations of
  a cosmos yet to come.</p>

  <p>It would have been easy to misinterpret the appearance of right of way.
  The more real that seems, the more illusory it usually is. The important
  thing was to take discreet advantage of the unofficial, unspoken laissez
  passer, that could be withdrawn, as easily as given, for the slightest break
  of the unwritten law that governs the use of privilege. Exceptions that prove
  rules must be exceptionally well self-governed; or exception ceases.</p>

  <p>There are no absolute secrets. No animal can thread a jungle unsuspected,
  unseen, unsmelt, unheard. It is always some jungle dweller's business to
  know. Safety depends on which animal knows, and has he a motive for more than
  curiosity? It is the same with humans, in the jungle of evolving purposes. No
  Bhutia, Nepalese mountain farmer or valley Lepcha, and above all no white man
  could follow the roads of Sikkim and escape detection. Liberty of movement
  depends on who knows, what he thinks about it, has he a motive for
  meddlesomeness?&mdash;suspicion?&mdash;enmity?&mdash;or for the silence that
  is good will's greatest means to aid each other's ends? No car could cross
  the almost countless Sikkim bridges unreported to the police.</p>

  <p>There is a Rajah, who isn't careless of his throne. He has a government,
  whose first law is self-preservation. There are telephone wires that stand up
  well in the war against termites, floods and jungle growth. Obstruction is as
  easy as twice two. Someone, anyone, shakes his official head, and into the
  net goes the suspect, to answer questions and to be delayed pending further
  enquiries.</p>

  <p>But someone, in the hush-hush code that baffles censors, had whispered
  "mind your own business." So Andrew's bulkily loaded, ill-painted car, with
  its oddly assorted occupants, and its old engine and new tires in
  unostentatiously good condition, passed unchallenged to the northwest corner
  of a land where suspicion is law, and the law looks southward to prevent all
  trespass into Tibet.</p>

  <p>He knew the road, having traveled it from the opposite direction; once is
  enough, for a man who naturally notices. The switchback miles fell headlong
  into steaming valleys, where swollen rivers root amid pathless jungle. So
  many huge butterflies impaled themselves against the radiator that the man
  from Koko Nor had to get out and scrape them off before the car could begin
  climbing. Then the laboring engine conquered incredible grades, up past
  myriads of rhododendrons, pine, oak, up beyond the tree line over wind-swept
  summits. Then again down&mdash;and again upward&mdash;endlessly repeated, and
  yet no mile like another. Andrew avoided the obvious gossip traps, where
  people gather to mind other people's business. He had caches of cans of
  petrol and oil waiting for him, planted where Bompo Tsering had been told to
  plant them, now and then in a lonely Bhutia's store, sometimes in the house
  of a friendly minor official, but always unfailingly ready.</p>

  <p>The secret of that, like all good secrets, was simple. It is so easy to
  learn that complicated people can't be bothered with it. Andrew knew how to
  leave friends behind him, who would do friendly things without looking so
  secretive that suspicion invents itself. He had disciplined his quick ability
  to spot what strangers usually hide&mdash;their self-respect. You can't
  patronize that stuff. It is the opposite of the homage that men have to pay
  to avarice, malice and fear in its other unsocial shapes. There is always a
  discoverable virtue, even beneath fawning insincerity. People like being
  found out, when it doesn't strip them naked to the mockery of neighbors.
  Genuine self-respect is as shy as a girl, as grateful as a girl for
  recognition. But coaxing it forth is a trick; and so is its corollary of
  tactful, inexpensive gifts that can't be duplicated or too soon forgotten.
  Andrew had even remembered a Bhutia storekeeper's envious glance at his
  loose-leaf notebook, and had brought him a duplicate&mdash;cost fifty cents
  &mdash;worth five hours' talk and fifty dollars more than that much
  money.</p>

  <p>There are no hotels on that route. He avoided dak* bungalows because of
  the risk of meeting travelers whose own secrets wouldn't bear investigation.
  All such people are anonymous informers; they create suspicion as a smoke-
  screen for their own improprieties.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>dak</i>&mdash;post; mail; <i>travel by dak</i>
  &mdash;to travel by relays of palanquins or other vehicle; <i>dak

  <p>The first night out he made for a monastery perched on a crag of the
  Singalila Range that hides Nepal from Sikkim. From a distance it looked like
  a mud-wasp's nest. In the brief twilight, as the car climbed the winding
  trail toward it, the buildings began to look like a Maxfield Parrish
  painting. They suggested contemplative calm and holiness. But that was as
  superficial as the sunset light reflected on the roof. The place was no more
  deeply peaceful than creation itself. It was a hive of envies sicklied over
  with insincerity, like a Western office building, only much less candidly
  barbarous, and much more subtle. And of course, equally as in the West, there
  was virtue hidden there. However, Andrew was too occupied, by the rough track
  and the sharp turns, to give much actual thought to the place and its
  occupants. They were a remembered dream. The monastery's ruler's face was
  like a ghost's that awaited him, high on the ledge&mdash;grim, gray, like the
  ghost in Hamlet, loaded with a melancholy anger against sin. Not a genial
  host. One's heart didn't leap to the meeting again.</p>

  <p>The car had to be left at the foot of the cliff. As a precaution against
  pilfering Andrew parked it close to a ruinous stupa* that contained ashes of
  a bygone hermit famous for saintliness.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>stupa</i>&mdash;A dome-shaped monument, used to
  house Buddhist relics or to commemorate significant facts of Buddhism or
  Jainism. Also called <i>tope</i>. <i><a href=

  <p>"Sikkimese thieves are as bad as Tibetans, but I guess they won't steal
  from this place," he remarked.</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering agreed promptly. "Hot damn, no! They maybe by-um-by too much
  wanting leaving plunder belonging them where by-um-by come finding it
  again."</p>

  <p>But as an additional precaution Bompo Tsering decorated the car with
  strips of prayer rag. He had a bagful, expensively blessed by a Bon
  magician.</p>

  <p>It was likely to be cold in the monastery. Andrew's heavy blankets had
  been sent forward long ago, to await him at the real starting point; so
  before locking the car door he took out his overcoat&mdash;shook it&mdash;
  felt in the pocket. He discovered then that his Mauser was missing. In its
  place was a piece of pine root. It was shaped enough like a Mauser pistol to
  leave no doubt about premeditation on the part of someone who had stolen the
  pistol and left that in its stead. He checked the natural impulse to raise
  hell about it there and then. Making sure he was unobserved, he put the thing
  back into the overcoat pocket. Then without turning his head, he studied
  Bompo Tsering and the man from Koko Nor.</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering looked actually, not studiously, innocent. He was muttering
  mantras to impregnate the blessed rags with more protective magic as he tied
  them to radiator cap, door handles, and all the other projections. The man
  from Koko Nor was busying himself with Andrew's bedding roll and a bundle
  roped in wrapping paper that he had been told to carry; he was trying out
  various ways of adjusting the loads on his shoulders. There was no exchange
  of glances between the two Tibetans&mdash;no noticeable effort to appear
  unconscious of the overcoat on Andrew's arm.</p>

  <p>Something had to be done. But the dilemma was awkward. If he should let
  them know he had discovered the theft, they would both be on guard against
  him. If not guilty, they would resent suspicion. If guilty, they would try to
  shield themselves with more treachery, there being nothing in the world more
  faithless than a fool on the defensive. But if he should postpone discovery
  too long, whether guilty or not they would consider him careless. Leaders of
  expeditions can't afford to be considered careless by the men on whose
  obedience success depends. Besides: he must not overlook an opportunity to
  put an end, once and for all, to any thought in those Tibetans' minds that
  murder was a profitable, undiscoverable means of changing plans and defeating
  purposes. In plain words: discipline.</p>

  <p>The sickening thought suggested itself, and refused to be mocked down by
  skeptical logic, that his own pistol might have been used to fire that shot
  through the window at Elsa. It was a registered pistol: ownership was
  indisputable. If found near Nancy Strong's house, it would give Bulah Singh
  an almost perfect leverage for blackmail. He recalled the Sikh's threat: "Do
  as I tell you, or take the consequences."</p>

  <p>In plain words: obey me, or be tipped off to the Tibetan Government by
  wire to Gyangtse or Lhasa. That would mean being ignominiously turned back,
  to face interrogation that inevitably would expose Lewis's connivance in an
  officially forbidden expedition. And that might mean the end of Lewis as
  Number One on the northeast border. Number Ones can't afford to be found out.
  They must bury their own mistakes or else be sacked like useless spies. The
  worst possible mistake is publicity. Bulah Singh could make it a police court
  case. It might be a particularly cunning move in Bulah Singh's intrigue
  against Lewis.</p>

  <p>So Andrew hesitated. For a second he even considered turning back to
  confer with Lewis. But he dismissed that thought. The momentum of a well-
  planned move was safer to depend on than retreat. There was no need to burn
  bridges behind him, yet. But there would be no sense in not crossing bridges
  before they could be closed against him. He decided to carry on.</p>

  <p>From the ledge, hundreds of feet higher up, a monastery radong* mooed like
  a lonely cow. It meant that the monks had seen the car. The long radong,
  resting on one monk's shoulder and blown by another, was serving the twofold
  purpose of announcing hospitable welcome and preventing devils from accepting
  the invitation. Delay at the foot of the cliff might be interpreted as
  devilish dread of the Higher Righteousness. The good impression, studiously
  built up on the south-bound journey, when he was racing against time to get
  Elsa into competent medical hands, would be all undone. It wasn't the right
  moment for a show-down with Bompo Tsering and the man from Koko Nor.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>radong</i> (Tibetan)&mdash;a long, trumpet-like
  ritual instrument with a bell-shaped end. Often telescopic.]</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>The Tibetans liked that phrase. They had grown used to it. It was like the
  bell to a bus horse.</p>

  <p>"Hot damn!" said Bompo Tsering. He grinned. He offered to carry Andrew's
  overcoat.</p>

  <p>That suggested a chance to discover guilt or not-guilt without revealing
  suspicion. If Bompo Tsering knew about the substitution of the pine root for
  the pistol, he probably would take the opportunity to grope in the pocket and
  drop the pine root from the cliff, on the way up. That would destroy the
  circumstantial evidence. No matter. Knowledge was what Andrew needed. Nothing
  was further from his thought than to prosecute Bompo Tsering, or even to get
  rid of him. He needed the man. But he needed him respectfully aware of the
  importance of being loyal. It was his job to inspire that loyalty. So he let
  him carry the overcoat.</p>

  <p>It turned out to be a missed guess: a minor mistake. Bompo Tsering's
  manner revealed his motive at once. By swaggering with that good overcoat
  hung carelessly over his shoulder he hoped to impress the monks. Doubtless,
  in his winterlong activity as Andrew's undercover agent, he had boasted of
  being almost Andrew's chief, not chief of staff. Now he foresaw humiliation.
  That overcoat suggested how to save face. He would have led the way, if
  Andrew had permitted. But Andrew went ahead up the difficult, winding
  footpath. He gave Bompo Tsering all the opportunity he needed to get rid of
  the pine root; and at the same time no chance to get first word at the
  monastery gate, where he might otherwise have developed his self-importance.
  The man from Koko Nor was too afraid of monastery magic, and too occupied
  with his loads, to do anything but grunt his way uphill, too far behind to be
  nagged by Bompo Tsering.</p>

  <p>It was pitch dark when they reached the summit. The rain clouds had rolled
  away; the stars were shining. They stood breathless on the edge of a dark
  precipice, in front of a featureless doorway in a plastered freestone wall.
  The two monks who greeted Andrew pointed to the new moon that hung like a
  flake of silver on purple. They smiled like Chinese ivory statues and said
  something astrologically wise, but they pretended not to understand Andrew's
  Tibetan, and they were suspiciously aloof toward Bompo Tsering and the man
  from Koko Nor. They led the way in, along dimly lamplit passages, upward from
  stair to stair, until they reached the great guest chamber. It was the same
  that Elsa had used on the way southward when she was carried up there, with
  her baby wrapped in Andrew's spare shirt and his priceless the crimson flames
  beneath a cauldron in which an adulterous lady was being boiled in oil. A
  very suitable sermon in paint for the edification of guests, profane or
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>The monks said something about food, bestowed their benedictions and
  backed out, spinning prayer wheels as a precaution against foreign devils
  that might have entered in Andrew's company. They were monkish monks&mdash; a
  mere couple of mildly pious drones, too timid to sin and too lazy to
  think.</p>

  <p>Andrew sent the man from Koko Nor to clean and refill the brass pitcher
  with water that hadn't been used a few times already. Bompo Tsering laid
  Andrew's overcoat on the bed and made experiments with one of the bent-wood
  chairs; cursing the religion of the man who made it, finally he sat on the
  floor with his head on the seat, remarking that a peling's hams must be
  different from other people's. Andrew sat on the bed discouraged by the
  sensation of unfinished business left behind in Darjeeling. The trail ahead
  seemed as calm as the pale new moon, although he knew it couldn't be. But he
  felt now, behind him, where he couldn't face it, a menace as dark as the
  ravines on which the new moon shone. It occurred to him to wonder why it did
  not occur to him to abandon Elsa to her own devices. It didn't. He saw that
  thought objectively. It belonged to someone else. It was as remote as the
  moon.</p>

  <p>The monks brought food&mdash;the usual tea, in the usual urn; enormous
  quantities of mountain rice, half boiled, spiced and soaked in ghee; three
  bowls of cooked herbs; bread; goats' milk cheese. Andrew ate sparingly,
  suspicious of the pungent, anonymous herbs that agree with Tibetans but that
  sometimes behave like locoweed in a white man's stomach. Bompo Tsering and
  the man from Koko Nor ate noisily and well, belching satisfaction and
  remarking that these monks must be wealthy, to provide such provender for
  passing guests. They licked the platters.</p>

  <p>Presently Bompo Tsering offered to return the platters and urn to the
  monastery kitchen. Andrew ordered the man from Koko Nor to do it; he was
  likelier to come running back without exchanging gossip. So Bompo Tsering sat
  still, watching Andrew writing with his fore-finger in the smoke on the wall
  beside the bed. He took the bait before long.</p>

  <p>"Peling's magic" he suggested, in a fruity sarcastic tone.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Andrew had actually scrawled a brief message to Elsa: Hurry forward. Don't
  let them delay you. But Bompo Tsering's question gave him an idea. Scowling,
  he made mysterious passes with his right hand&mdash;inscribed his initials in
  the soot&mdash;made a punctuation mark&mdash;then turned and studied Bompo
  Tsering's face until the scrutiny and the silence were too much for the
  Tibetan. He had to speak:</p>

  <p>"My thinking maybe by-um-by our needing too much more magic. This place
  being too much making my afraid."</p>

  <p>"This is hot damn magic," said Andrew. "It makes the truth talk."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering produced his rosary. He always boasted that its beads were
  carved from the toe bones of holy hermits from Mt. Kailas, and that they were
  strung on a saint's sinew. He even knew the name of the blessed saint.
  Nevertheless, the rosary had been made in Birmingham.</p>

  <p>The man from Koko Nor returned breathless, looking scared out of his wits.
  He sat down by himself in a corner, with his hands on his thighs. He appeared
  to be praying. Bompo Tsering flicked his beads and muttered mantras,
  shuddering when the night wind howled under the eaves and the draught made
  the little lamps flicker amid leaping shadows.</p>

  <p>Andrew, wondering how long to let that mood ferment, framed the questions
  he would presently ask. He lighted his pipe. But he thumbed it out almost
  instantly, when someone knocked on the door.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22">CHAPTER 22</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Bompo Tsering and the man from Koko Nor knelt, suddenly, in
  a hurry. They laid their foreheads and the palms of their hands on the floor.
  The Lama Gombaria Rinpoche entered. They remained in that position until he
  left the room, ten minutes later. The Lama was accompanied by two black-robed
  subordinates, who looked like homosexuals&mdash;ivory smooth&mdash;too lushly
  conscious of a lechery disguised as love that passeth understanding. One was
  the interpreter. The other carried his master's official chair; he set it
  against the wall facing the brass bed. They stood thumbing their beads, one
  on each side of the grim Abbot, who was graciously pleased to be seated after
  Andrew had bowed and received the
  three-fold-gracious-blessing-bestowing-change-of-heart-toward-
  righteousness.</p>

  <p>He signed to Andrew&mdash;an imperious, ungracious, condescending nod.
  Andrew sat down on the bed, with the soot-smothered painting of hell on the
  wall behind him. There began to be an otherworld sensation, heightened by the
  picturesqueness of the black-robed representatives of Secrecy, Serenity and
  Sacred Law.</p>

  <p>Andrew was well aware that the Lama Gombaria knew scholarly English. But
  he also had reason to know that His Reverence was much too diplomatic to
  admit it. He kept many another, more esoteric vehicle for thought equally
  well guarded behind sanctimonious mistrust of plain appearances of any kind
  whatever. He had a sour, sardonic look that matched his reputation for
  severity and fasting, and for spending days on end in meditation without
  perceptibly breathing or moving an eyelid. Many high lamas cultivate that
  habit for the sake of the easy authority it gives them over marveling monks.
  But this man had the air of a disciplinarian who needed no such subterfuge to
  sweeten rule that he could enforce by strength of will. He was reputed, too,
  to be a clairvoyant of such astonishing power that he could see through any
  man's thought to its naked motive; it was said to be useless to tell him
  lies. And he was famed as a magician who could leave his body at will and
  travel vast distances, returning with intimate knowledge of things, events
  and men. Another, less exaggerated rumor, credited and slyly broadcast by the
  modern-minded newly literate iconoclasts who swarm the world, mocked him for
  a bigoted old humbug; accused him of being deeply involved in treason against
  human liberties; classed trim as a black reactionary, a Fascist, a Nazi, a
  Communist, an anarchist. He was probably all of those things, in some degree,
  by turns, but nothing longer than his inward humor pleased.</p>

  <p>He looked, in his black peaked cap and robe, like a wrinkled old mummy,
  with bright eyes, unusually long ear lobes, and a long face with a protruding
  lower lip. But the chiefly remarkable thing about him, that caused Andrew to
  treat him with watchful politeness, was the sensation of mass. It bore no
  relation to his weight or his size. He was a small man, lean, emaciated. His
  underlings, with their backs to the shadowy wall, were taller than he and far
  heavier; they presented breadth and height; but in the dim, unsteady light
  they were as flat to the eye as daguerreotypes. The old Lama, regardless of
  his frailty, was mass personified, like Memnon's statue on the Nile. He was
  as motionless. He monopolized attention in the same way, by being&mdash;as
  distinguished from wishing to be. That is great art. A Rodin, Beethoven,
  Homer can create it in marble, music, words; but some men use themselves
  &mdash;their own presence&mdash;as the stuff they mold into a hint of
  absolutes. This man did it. Andrew's impulse, so strong that he was conscious
  of his hands and had to keep them still, was to get out his knife and begin
  whittling a portrait in wood.</p>

  <p>The interpreter broke the silence: "Our Holy Lama Gombaria Rinpoche
  graciously is pleased to know that you are well."</p>

  <p>"Thank him," said Andrew. "Say I'm grateful for his hospitality and glad
  to see him looking so well himself."</p>

  <p>There was no pause for reference. It was like a litany.</p>

  <p>"The Holy Lama graciously enquires about the health and happiness of the
  lady and child who accompanied you at the time of your former visit."</p>

  <p>"The child is dead," said Andrew. He knew that the old Lama already knew
  that; Bompo Tsering must have told him, during the course of the winter; he
  undoubtedly had received the news, too, by courier from Mu-ni Gam-po. "But
  the lady herself," he added, "has benefited from His Holiness's blessing and
  is now quite well. She sends her respectful greetings and best wishes."</p>

  <p>The interpreter whispered. The old Lama pretended to listen. He murmured
  an instruction. The interpreter resumed:</p>

  <p>"The Holy Lama orders me to tell you that there is no death of anything
  but bodies. So the child shall presently receive another incarnation. His
  Holiness bestows a blessing to ensure a happy rebirth."</p>

  <p>"Thank him," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>Then came the hot hint. The interpreter had been primed with well
  premeditated speech. He exchanged glances with his grim superior and then
  used words precisely, as if choosing them out of a book.</p>

  <p>"His Holiness, at this time doing penance of meditation for the world's
  sins, blesses your journey. But he may not at this time indulge in
  conversation, because spiritual meditation may not be disturbed by mundane
  irrelevancies. So His Holiness begs you kindly to be governed by the
  monastery-rule forbidding&mdash;at this time&mdash;all unnecessary discussion
  of matters unrelated to the Higher Law."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sure, certainly," said Andrew. "That's quite understood. I won't talk
  to the monks." The inference he drew was that the Lama Gombaria wanted no
  official knowledge of the reason for the northbound journey.</p>

  <p>But the interpreter wished to be sure that he did understand. He added:
  "Subject to our Holy Lama's will, our minds are filled with blessed thinking.
  Therefore the obligation is silence."</p>

  <p>"Thank him for the blessing on my journey," said Andrew. "I will be on my
  way at daybreak."</p>

  <p>"To preserve your will-to-be-silent, and to protect you on your journey,
  His Holiness caused me to write this mantra, which he himself has blessed and
  bids me give to you."</p>

  <p>The interpreter, looking as innocent as a saint in a stained glass window,
  produced a folded paper from an inside pocket of his robe, came forward with
  it and gave it to Andrew. Andrew thanked him and made haste with his own
  gift:</p>

  <p>"I took the liberty," he said, "of noticing, when I was here last, that
  His Holiness showed interest in an old illustrated magazine that I had with
  me. That one wasn't worthy of his attention. I have brought some good ones.
  They're in that roped paper package. Shall I order my man to carry it?"</p>

  <p>A faint smile flickered on the face of the old Lama. His beady eyes
  watched the interpreter pick up the heavy package as if he feared he might
  drop it and spoil its precious contents. Twelve Esquires, twelve Sunday
  issues of the New York Times, twelve National Geographics, twelve Newsweeks,
  and twelve Fortunes had cost Andrew exactly nothing; they had been given to
  him by a chance American acquaintance in Darjeeling. But they were worth more
  than gold to a lonely Lord Abbot, who secretly knew English, secretly
  delighted in the mad frivolity of Western worldliness, and kept the sources
  of his information secret to himself. He pretended to be condescendingly
  astonished, as if a child had surprised him. He dourly accepted the gift, as
  if manners obliged him to do what virtue forbade. But his eyes were as bright
  as a bird's. His blessing, as he and his sycophants left the room, was
  sonorous, and long, and loaded with praise of the blessed dew that brought
  the giver's thought from heaven. The Lama Gombaria was one more dependable
  friend to the good, on whom Andrew might count for the little favors that
  resemble drops of oil upon the bearings of events.</p>

  <p>The door closed almost silently. Bompo Tsering and the man from Koko Nor
  looked up to make sure, then got to their feet and stood gaping at Andrew. He
  had been allowed to be seated in the Holy Lama's presence, so he had mounted
  in their estimation. The effect wouldn't last long, but for the moment they
  were filled with awe as they watched him unfold the sheet of paper the
  interpreter had handed to him. There was another, smaller sheet inside it. On
  that was the "mantra," printed beautifully with a quill pen, in English
  capitals:</p>

  <h4>THE CAT CAME BACK TO ELSA. NO SIG.</h4>

  <p>It was so startling and different from what he had expected that it took
  Andrew several seconds to realize that "cat" meant "mouser" and that "mouser"
  was pun on Mauser pistol. Someone then had found his pistol and it was now in
  Elsa's possession. Someone&mdash;very likely Mu-ni Gam-po at the request of
  Lewis&mdash;must have wired to the nearest telegraph office. The message must
  have come a long way by runner, probably spatchcocked into a longer telegram
  to the Lama Gombaria. Andrew put it in his pocket, forcing a smile and
  looking wise for the Tibetans' benefit. No magic is magic without its
  showman. He assumed a mysterious air. But he couldn't keep that up. He had to
  sit down on the bed. He was suddenly seeing things.</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering, bursting with awed curiosity, came nearer: "That must being
  too much hot damn holy writing."</p>

  <p>Andrew made an impatient commanding gesture toward the roll of blankets,
  but didn't speak. The skeptical part of his mind was wondering how much, or
  how little, or if at all, the old Lama, who had just left the room, had to do
  with the vision that he was seeing with the other part of his mind without in
  any way changing his view of the room he was in.</p>

  <p>It was arresting. There was no shutting it out, although he tried. Nancy
  Strong's room in Darjeeling. The cat, on the hearth. The fire burning
  brightly. The electric light full on. Nancy in her armchair. Lewis. Elsa
  &mdash;he saw her last. They were more really present to his imagination than
  if they had been actually in the dim, shadowy room where he sat. They were
  vivid-brilliant. It couldn't be altogether a trick of memory. True, Lewis's
  use (he could bet it was Lewis) of the word "cat" to mean Mauser pistol might
  have suggested the fireside in Nancy's living room and have brought it
  vividly to mind. But that couldn't account for their all behaving as they had
  not behaved while he was there; or for the fact that Andrew himself was not
  now in the picture. His chair by the hearth was empty. They were all moving.
  The cat was licking itself. It ran away suddenly and hid under Nancy's chair.
  Whichever way he turned his head he saw them. He could see they were
  speaking, but he couldn't hear anything.</p>

  <p>It wasn't like a dream, or a motion picture, or a lantern projection on a
  screen. It was more like something that crystal gazers are supposed to see
  when they stare and concentrate: something, but not quite, like the
  reflection in a good viewfinder, except that it wasn't reversed, and it was
  apparently life-size. Simultaneously he could see the two Tibetans and all
  the other objects in the room he was in. There was no physical sensation of
  eyestrain or fatigue. But there was a feeling almost of horror, as if he had
  lost control of his mind. He could see the vision with his eyes shut. It made
  no difference whether he kept them closed or open. He tried it several times.
  He saw the dim room with his eyes, and Nancy's electric-lighted room, two
  hundred miles away, with some other faculty of perception, as if his mind was
  in two disconnected parts. By shutting his eyes he could shut out the room he
  was in, but that made no difference to the vastly brighter and more detailed
  image. He could even read some of the names on the backs of Nancy Strong's
  books.</p>

  <p>Lewis was standing with his back to the fire, with a muddy Mauser pistol
  in his right hand. He was showing it to Elsa. He saw Elsa get up and confront
  Lewis. He couldn't hear what they were saying, but he knew it was his own
  pistol, and presently he knew what they were talking about because the scene
  changed. They were still there. Nancy Strong sat quietly in her chair. But
  there was something added. He could see through the wall to the passage
  beyond. Tashgyl, the Lepcha servant, was taking the pistol from Andrew's
  overcoat on the peg in the hall and presently giving the pistol to someone in
  the dark garden. It wasn't clear how Tashgyl reached the garden. Soon after
  that, or perhaps simultaneously&mdash;there was no clear sensation of time or
  of sequence&mdash;he grew aware that the whole vision was framed by Elsa's
  face, behind her hands. He could see her eyes through her hands. They were
  intelligently, dumbly pleading, like a dog's that wishes it could tell what
  it knows. He knew that phase of her well. Her face kept fading. The moment he
  looked hard at it, it faded away. He wondered what that meant. He didn't
  trust his own wordless interpretation of it, but he felt she was trying to
  reach him and disliked doing it&mdash;feared to do it. She seemed to expect a
  rebuke, and to flinch from the expectation. Small blame to her. He had been
  pretty tough, lots of times, repelling confidences, keeping his thoughts to
  himself and forcing her to do the same. She probably detested him. Quite
  right, too. He had humiliated her, time and again. He marveled at the
  dignity, pluck, patience with which she had endured his reserve. He felt
  ashamed&mdash;but all the same not unreserved&mdash;not excusing, nor
  explaining, even to himself, in secret.</p>

  <p>The entire vision, and all the thoughts that accompanied it, lasted less
  than a minute. He knew that. With the other part of his mind he had been
  watching Bompo Tsering, who had taken the blanket roll off the bed and begun
  to unfasten the straps; he hadn't finished undoing them when the vision
  faded. Less than sixty seconds. Whatever caused that vision, time had no part
  in it. What he had just now witnessed must have taken place on the previous
  night. He knew that too, although he didn't know how he knew it. It just was
  so. Time, then, was only an illusion? God! Even trying to think about that
  made his head reel. But all the same, time can't limit an idea. Time doesn't
  alter the fact that a thing did happen. Andrew wasn't an escapist. He wasn't
  like the Grade B scientists, who stick their heads into realism but expose
  their fannies to the ridiculing blasts of reality. Miracle? Hell, there's no
  such thing. Had the Lama Gombaria turned some occult trick with the aid of
  the folded paper? He experimented&mdash;clutched the paper in his pocket
  &mdash;drew it out&mdash;opened it&mdash;read it again. Nothing doing.</p>

  <h4>THE CAT CAME BACK TO ELSA. NO SIG.</h4>

  <p>But the vision did not return. He could remember every detail. But now it
  was a mere memory-picture, as different as a faded photograph is from the
  living model. The vision was gone.</p>

  <p>He pulled out his pipe and sat reviewing the facts. Bompo Tsering fumbled
  with the blanket roll. The man from Koko Nor, on the floor in the corner, sat
  picking his teeth with a sliver of wild swan's thigh bone. It had been
  specially blessed for that purpose; he kept it in a container made from a
  Japanese brass cartridge. He had a hollow back tooth that Andrew was going to
  have to pull before long to keep him from going haywire, but for the time
  being he was well occupied trying to dig out the devil that caused the pain.
  Bompo Tsering, on the other hand, needed watching, if for no other reason
  than because he had turned his back instead of facing Andrew while he undid
  the blankets.</p>

  <p>Elsa. Andrew remembered that, once, on the way southward, in a place where
  they had found some dead tamarisk and had built a good fire for the first
  time in nearly a week, he had read to her, to keep her mind off the physical
  ordeal that was two or three days ahead. He had chanced on a passage in
  Goethe's Faust:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Shall here a thousand volumes teach me only<br>
  That man, self-tortured, everywhere must bleed,&mdash;<br>
  And here and there one happy man sits lonely?"</p>

  <p>He had continued reading to her far into the night; but they had kept
  returning to that passage, discussing the evident truth that in the rhythm
  and tone of poetry there's a mysterious magic that links thought with things
  unseen. It conjures new views. They pass in a moment but leave their mark on
  mind, so that nothing, not even a star, is ever again the same as it was.
  Flowers don't smell the same. Music has higher meanings. Come to think of it,
  he hadn't always repelled Elsa. He had always welcomed her into the inner
  mood of poetry that so thrilled him that he sometimes choked when he read it
  aloud. And while they talked, that night, he remembered how he saw a vision,
  like this one, of Tom Grayne, seated lonely in his mountain cavern, making a
  map from memory by guttering candlelight.</p>

  <p>He had wondered then, as he wondered now: were he and Elsa the self-
  tortured, who bled? And was Tom Grayne the happy man who sat lonely? What is
  happiness? Did anyone know? Had anyone ever found it? Is there an actual
  difference between happiness and joy? He hadn't asked Elsa whether she saw
  the same vision or pondered the same thought, because he knew how she hated
  clairvoyance, and he wanted to keep her thoughts as calm as possible. In
  fact, he had laid Goethe aside and read from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. But
  he hadn't read well, because of wondering, with half of his mind, whether her
  seeing a vision of Tom had caused him to see it; and whether the flow of
  poetry might be the agency that, for a moment, had suspended space and time.
  There might be a connection. He thought of it again now. He was willing to
  follow the mood of real poetry wherever that might lead. But there is unreal
  poetry, to be avoided like poison. Lots of it. Gutless, kiss-mammy, decadent
  stuff that can't climb, even downhill&mdash;written by sirens who pose on
  rocks but wait for traffic signals from a Fhrer. He hated with all his heart
  and soul the thought of being misled, to a spiritual dead end, by the
  pipsqueak drum and fife bands that parade as the voices of God.
  Propagandists! Proletarian apologists! Liars! Treacherous bellwethers leading
  the sheep up the slope of a mechanical Olympus, where the butchers wait.
  God's elect, the butchers! He felt anger rising&mdash;laughed at the anger,
  because he knew how useless it was. Anger is exactly what the Fhrers can
  exploit. But if a whole world once gets to laughing again&mdash;</p>

  <p>Once more, sixty seconds. Time must be an elastic illusion. He had thought
  of a thousand things in sixty seconds. He had seen Hitler's Mein Kampf like a
  dirty jest scrawled on the universal backhouse by a subhuman misanthrope. He
  had even reviewed in his mind the true and false poets, setting them on
  either side of an imagined pale, finding time to loathe Swinburne, to love
  Robert Burns, and to acknowledge a cagey respect for Walt Whitman.</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering was still leisurely unfolding blankets; he would steal a
  packet of razor blades presently from the pocket in the canvas carry-all.
  Strange how some men can't resist trifles. Bompo Tsering could be trusted
  with any amount of money, barring the small change; he always tried to steal
  some of that. The man from Koko Nor had both thumbs in his mouth and was
  busily poking a devil with the swan's thigh bone&mdash;very angry with the
  devil. A bell boomed in the monastery. It sounded far away like a bell buoy
  on a shoal. Suddenly there were Elsa's eyes again, pleading and yet trying
  not to intrude. They were gone in a moment. Andrew felt a savage impulse to
  tell her to let him alone. But he suppressed that&mdash;turned the savagery
  on itself and let it strangle itself in a dark subconscious past, along with
  some men's poetry, and Sunday School, and certain other things.</p>

  <p>He was feeling chilly. He was getting rattled by his thoughts. It was time
  to do something. With the side of his eye he watched Bompo Tsering secrete a
  packet of razor blades. Good. That was a cue for the show-down with Bompo
  Tsering. But first he leaned over the bed and scratched another message on
  the wall, just to let Elsa know he wasn't so dumb as she thought him:</p>

  <p>Got second message. Okay.</p>

  <p>Two or three days might pass before Elsa would occupy the room on her way
  northward, but there was not much risk of the message being noticed and
  rubbed out by the monks. They never cleaned their own cells. It wasn't likely
  to occur to them to wash the wall of a room reserved for strangers.</p>

  <p>He got off the bed and sat on one of the bent-wood chairs, lighting his
  pipe, crossing his legs. He ordered Bompo Tsering to dump the blankets on the
  bed.</p>

  <p>"Never mind spreading them now. Bring me the pistol from my overcoat
  pocket."</p>

  <p>"Why, Gunnigun?"</p>

  <p>"Because I say so."</p>

  <p>There was no noticeable guilty reaction. Bompo Tsering picked up the
  overcoat, groped in the pocket and pulled out the pine root, stared at it. He
  appeared genuinely puzzled. He glanced at the man from Koko Nor, who left off
  prodding his aching tooth and stared back blankly.</p>

  <p>"Bring it here," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering obeyed. "Must being hot damn magic," he said with
  conviction. Then, looking straight into Andrew's eyes: "Gunnigun, this not my
  doing."</p>

  <p>"Why did you steal razor blades?"</p>

  <p>"My not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Give 'em here."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering, looking sheepish, produced the stolen packet. Andrew took
  it and slipped it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to be sacked?"</p>

  <p>"No, Gunnigun!"</p>

  <p>"Do you want to be beaten?"</p>

  <p>"No, Gunnigun! That not being too much, that little thing,</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun, your not&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I said, shut up!"</p>

  <p>Andrew glanced at what he had scrawled on the wall. Then he pulled out the
  Lama's "mantra" from his pocket, unfolded it, studied it, returned it and
  stared grimly at Bompo Tsering.</p>

  <p>"How many times have I told you there'll be a last time when you play
  tricks on me?"</p>

  <p>"Too much times. Gunnigun, my not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Gunnigun."</p>

  <p>"Open the shutter and throw that pine root through the window."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering obeyed. The wind blew out the lights.</p>

  <p>"Close the shutter. Fasten it."</p>

  <p>Now there was total darkness. The man from Koko Nor breathed heavily and
  began tapping the floor with his blessed cartridge case, to keep devils
  away.</p>

  <p>"My lighting lamp," said Bompo Tsering.</p>

  <p>"Stand still!"</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun, what your doing?"</p>

  <p>"I am making hot damn magic."</p>

  <p>"Peling magic?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"That being no good."</p>

  <p>"It will be no good for you, if you lie. Answer: whose pistol fired the
  shot through the window last night?"</p>

  <p>"My not knowing."</p>

  <p>"I believe you:" Andrew felt fairly sure that Bulah Singh would keep his
  dupes as ignorant as possible of everything except what they were to do. And
  it is wise tactics to encourage the first glimmer of truth if you hope to
  hear more. "Who was told to fire the shot?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"My not firing it."</p>

  <p>"I believe you again. You couldn't have fired it. Who was told to do
  it?"</p>

  <p>The man from Koko Nor ceased breathing through his nose. He ceased tapping
  the floor.</p>

  <p>"I know who did it," said Andrew. "Answer this one, Bompo Tsering: shall
  the fool&mdash;who obeyed you&mdash;pay a penalty&mdash;for having done
  &mdash;what you would have punished him for not doing? Answer!"</p>

  <p>Silence.</p>

  <p>"You understood me. Speak! Did you not threaten this numskull that unless
  he obeyed, you would cause the police to arrest him for theft? Did you not
  say he would be thrown in prison for at least a whole year?"</p>

  <p>That was a long shot, but a fairly safe one. The easiest way to persuade a
  homesick Tibetan to do murder or anything else would be to threaten dreadful
  confinement within prison walls; the mere suggestion would panic his wild-ass
  heart. Bompo Tsering didn't answer. So the guess appeared to be good. Andrew
  followed up:</p>

  <p>"Why did you give the order to shoot Lady Elsa?"</p>

  <p>"My spirit being too good not wanting shooting other ladee."</p>

  <p>"So you did give the order. You admit that. Who told you to shoot Miss
  Nancy Strong?"</p>

  <p>Silence.</p>

  <p>"I know who told you."</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun, then why your asking?"</p>

  <p>"Because I wish you to answer. And by God, if you don't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no, Gunnigun! No, no! My answering. Bulah Singh&mdash;big top
  policeman."</p>

  <p>"I believe you again. What did he promise you?"</p>

  <p>"His saying, if my shooting other ladee, then can get going home. If not,
  then not get going&mdash;getting too much trouble."</p>

  <p>"So you changed it and ordered that other fool to shoot Lady Elsa?"</p>

  <p>Silence.</p>

  <p>"If you don't answer, I won't save you from the law."</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is the answer?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my doing that."</p>

  <p>"Well. Luckily for you there was too much hot damn magic around. So the
  shot missed. Bulah Singh made a fool of you. It was my pistol that was handed
  to you in the dark."</p>

  <p>"Uh-uh! My not touching it!"</p>

  <p>"Liar! Someone gave it to you. You gave it to this other fool. Now then:
  where is the pistol?"</p>

  <p>"My not knowing."</p>

  <p>"Ask that other fool what he did with it."</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun, why not your asking?"</p>

  <p>"Because you are responsible. Ask him!"</p>

  <p>There were murmurs in the dark-protests, questions, threats. Then
  suddenly:</p>

  <p>"His lying. His saying&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted. "I have been making hot damn magic. I know where the
  pistol is."</p>

  <p>"Then, Gunnigun, why your asking?"</p>

  <p>"Because I intend to be answered! Quick! Answer! Where did he put it?"</p>

  <p>"damfool saying his throwing pistol in mud and then running away."</p>

  <p>"Do you realize that if that pistol should be found by the police, you and
  this other fool would be arrested, and taken back to Darjeeling and tried for
  your lives?"</p>

  <p>"My not having doing nothing."</p>

  <p>"You'd get about ten years in prison. The other fool, about three years,
  for having done what you told him."</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun, your not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am going to punish you."</p>

  <p>"Oh."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun, your not&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Light the lamps. All of them."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering groped for matches and obeyed. The man from Koko Nor, with
  his back in a corner, blinked wide-eyed like a suspicious owl&mdash;a blink,
  a long stare, a blink, a long stare. Bompo Tsering came back and stood before
  Andrew.</p>

  <p>"I made magic on that wall," said Andrew. "Look at it. The Lady Elsa shall
  find my pistol. She shall bring it to me, to save your neck and this other
  fool's. And as a punishment to you, she shall return with us to Tibet."</p>

  <p>"But, Gunnigun&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She shall have your pony&mdash;the good one with the strong legs."</p>

  <p>"But, Gunnigun&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You yourself shall wait on her. You shall pitch her tent. You shall obey
  every order she gives you. And unless she gives a good report of you,
  Tum-Glain shall be told. And what he will do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Gunnigun!"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;isn't the half of what I will do to you before he gets second
  chance. Now spread my blankets on the bed."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Gunnigun."</p>

  <p>"Spread your own blankets on that stone dais."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Gunnigun."</p>

  <p>"That other fool may sleep on the floor."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Gunnigun."</p>

  <p>"Get me that book out of the carryall pocket."</p>

  <p>"Here it is, Gunnigun."</p>

  <p>"Set two of those lamps in the niche at the head of the bed."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Gunnigun."</p>

  <p>"Now pull off my boots."</p>

  <p>The proud Bompo Tsering knelt and obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>"What now?"</p>

  <p>"Your not telling Ladee Elsa about that our having&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It depends on you."</p>

  <p>"My being too much ashamed before her being woman."</p>

  <p>"Take care then that she doesn't complain, even once&mdash;just only
  once&mdash;about your behavior on the journey. If I hear no complaints I will
  bear your request in mind. Give my boots to that other fool. Tell him to
  clean them. Then turn in."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Gunnigun."</p>

  <p>Andrew bolted the door, rolled under the blankets, pulled his overcoat
  over him and lay thinking for a minute or two. He felt damned lonely. He made
  a deliberate effort to see Elsa's eyes, but he had no success&mdash;none
  whatever. The only mental picture he could summon from the vasty deep of
  consciousness was the mere memory-image of Bulah Singh, facing him in his own
  room in the hotel in Darjeeling.</p>

  <p>For the rest, his thoughts scattered themselves&mdash;wondering what Lewis
  was doing&mdash;was the snow really out of the passes&mdash;were the ponies
  too fat&mdash;what luck would he have getting extra ponies for Elsa's
  baggage. There was nothing to be gained by that kind of thinking.</p>

  <p>So he opened Sir Thomas Browne's Religio Medici at random and read until
  he fell asleep with the lights burning. He dreamed that the old Lama Gombaria
  was brewing poison in the monastery cellar, for Bulah Singh to take all the
  way to Shig-po-ling, to put into Tom Grayne's tea. Elsa was imploring
  Gombaria not to do it, so the Lama and Bulah Singh both threw poison at him,
  Andrew. It made a noise like beaten brass, and he awoke to hear the monastery
  bells ringing.</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering opened the shutter. It was daybreak; the sun was touching
  the peaks of the far-off mountains of Nepal. Andrew went and stood half naked
  at the window relishing for a moment the clean chill of the wind on his skin
  as he peered down into the gorge, eight hundred feet, sheer. To his right,
  not fifty feet below, was a ledge that served as passage between a dormitory
  and another building. There was a group of monks on the ledge; they looked
  like vultures getting ready for the news of a death, preening themselves. He
  recognized two of them. They had been all winterlong in Mu-ni Gam-po's
  monastery. He chuckled.</p>

  <p>"The obligation is silence!" he said aloud.</p>

  <p>"What your saying, Gunnigun?"</p>

  <p>"Let not your left hand know what your right hand doeth!"</p>

  <p>"My not understanding."</p>

  <p>"Let's go&mdash;while the going's good."</p>

  <p>"Hot damn!&mdash;Breakfus'?"</p>

  <p>"No. We will cook our own, somewhere beside the road, where there's a
  stream to wash in. Step lively&mdash;pack up the bedding. Hold your tongue on
  the way out."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23">CHAPTER 23</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A day's drive north of Darjeeling. Darkness. Stillness of
  dying night. A screen door slammed. Nancy and Elsa came out, still sleepy,
  from the guest bungalow at the Jesuit Mission. Dawn broke, that moment, on
  distant mountain peaks.</p>

  <p>"There, Nancy! Look! Oh, God! Look! Nancy! There's the Roof of the World!
  Oh, come too! Say good-bye to all this! Come with us!"</p>

  <p>"I think I feel the tug as strongly as you do," said Nancy. "But it's the
  old story. I am too conceited to come. I imagine responsibilities. Oh dear.
  If only Karl Marx had studied that daybreak instead of the books in the
  British Museum!"</p>

  <p>"Damn him!" said Elsa, with all her heart. Unconsciously, but strongly,
  she associated Karl Marx with her hosts of the previous night. She was
  conscious of it as soon as she had damned Marx, and felt vaguely ashamed of
  herself. Jesuits claim that Karl Marx only imitated, converted and perverted
  what they knew and practiced before he was born or thought of.</p>

  <p>A rain cloud rolled between them and the view. It was dark again, with
  shafts of warm light streaming through the window behind them.</p>

  <p>"False dawn! Another false prophet! Gone!" said Elsa. "Oh, how wonderful
  it was. How can there be such passion of beauty&mdash;and then this
  gloom?"</p>

  <p>"Are you feeling discouraged?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think so. Deflated is what it feels like. Three days since
  Andrew left. I t seems like three years&mdash;longer. Oh, I hope he's all
  right."</p>

  <p>Nancy Strong's white felt hat tilted. She glanced at Elsa. "Why? Have you
  a premonition?"</p>

  <p>"No. Except that I can't even get a mental picture of him."</p>

  <p>"I know you can't."</p>

  <p>"I tried to send him a message, from Darjeeling, before we sent the
  telegram."</p>

  <p>"I know you did."</p>

  <p>"I don't think he got it. I couldn't find him: he was gone. I tried again
  last night. But I know I didn't reach him last night. He seems to have gone
  &mdash;gone forever. I don't think he even got the telegram."</p>

  <p>"I thought of coming into your room last night to stop you from trying.
  But I thought better of it. It seemed wiser to let you fail. Did you ever
  hear of radio interference? You can't think here. You would be echoing Jesuit
  thoughts if we stayed here long enough. Echoing them badly. Jesuits can, so
  to speak, bend iron. They can wear down adamant. You might as well try to
  whistle against a thunderstorm as to oppose your thought against theirs."</p>

  <p>The Mission garden gradually awoke and spread its fragrance to greet the
  dim daybreak. The birds' hymn began. Elsa found it almost impossible to
  believe that the recent past was true, it seemed so distant and unreal. The
  sensation reminded her of an utterly different scene in Southampton, with the
  gulls around an ocean liner, in a fog, and the siren going, when she was
  seeing friends off on a long voyage. Utterly different, and yet no
  difference. Unreal, and yet heartbursting with reality.</p>

  <p>The evening's visit had been civilized. The night's seclusion had felt
  like guarded peace in an armed camp disciplined to silence. The breakfast,
  brought before daybreak by an earless ex-brigand convert from Bhutan, had
  seemed and tasted like communion with the invisible presence of Peace.
  Nevertheless, she had felt uneasy; and now she felt impatient, wondering why
  the car was so long coming from the barn at the rear of the Mission
  buildings.</p>

  <p>She felt ungrateful for good hospitality. That was a perplexing and
  contemptible sensation. Unnatural, and not at all like her, but there it was.
  The scrupulous impersonal politeness of their hosts had rendered almost
  imperceptible the fact that there was any difference between Nancy's point of
  view and theirs&mdash;her religion and theirs. No arguments. No strained
  aloofness. Almost familiar courtesy. Bright conversation. Praise of each
  other's achievements. Mutual exchange of information about children's diet
  and the frugal use of money. Silence about religion&mdash;not even armed
  neutrality, but silence, and no issue from it that could introduce a hint of
  the ill-mannered tolerance, that is only insolence in undress. They had
  agreed on Nancy's treatment of rhododendrons; and on the care of children's
  lips who are learning to play wind instruments. The Father Superior had shown
  Nancy a new way to cut down the cost of insulation against termites, and how
  to keep books free from weevils and mildew. But no peering beneath mental
  surfaces&mdash;no spy work&mdash;no leading questions.</p>

  <p>The neat, two-roomed guest house had been an oasis of privileged calm,
  amid hive-like, unhurried energy. Elsa had rather resented the priests' lack
  of astonishment when she had betrayed, by the merest accident, that she could
  speak and write Tibetan. They had shown no curiosity. So far as she was able
  to observe, they didn't even glance at one another. Perhaps they had heard
  rumors about her, that were none of their business, but nevertheless no
  recommendation. There had been no hostility, no coolness; but she had felt
  that her reception as a privileged guest was due entirely to the fact that
  Nancy Strong had introduced her. It was a compliment to Nancy, not to
  herself. She wondered why she resented it. She had no right to. She did her
  half-hearted best to subdue malicious triumph at the thought that she was on
  her way, in secret, to where even the Soldiers of Loyola might only yearn to
  go, but could not. She wished they knew where she was going. She would have
  enjoyed their envy.</p>

  <p>The car came&mdash;Nancy's old Sunbeam, with the top up&mdash;driven by a
  veteran Mahratta ex-Pioneer Sepoy,* bearded like the pard, surlier than
  Diogenes, but not so interested as that grim philosopher in looking for an
  honest man. He was quite sure there was none. He regarded Nancy as a beloved
  lunatic whose will was the higher law, but whose aberrations called for no
  encouragement from him. A man of few words, and those mainly disrespectful. A
  man of few miles to the hour because petrol is expensive and Nancy was
  school-poor; also because his honor was his own and he had no intention to
  die in a ditch. A man who broke no traffic rules, and could be neither bribed
  nor bullied. He had been known, when questioned about Nancy's movements, to
  tell a brashly new inspector of police to ask God, since God made her mad, so
  perhaps God understood her secrets.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>sepoy</i> (Persian <i>siphi</i>, "soldier")
  &mdash;a native of India employed as a soldier in the service of a European
  power, usually of the United Kingdom. Specifically, it was the term used in
  the British Indian Army for an infantry private (a cavalry trooper was a
  sowar). The same Persian word has reached English via another route in the
  form of "Spahis." <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepoy">Wikipedia</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>Two Jesuit priests neglected daybreak duty, for two stopwatch minutes, to
  come and say good-bye. They were polite to Elsa, cordial to Nancy, expert at
  speeding the parting guests. The rain descended in a squall. The car started.
  It felt good. They were off.</p>

  <p>"So you don't like my friends?" said Nancy, as they headed north-
  westward, between terraced hills that showed the touch of the Jesuit
  influence. The peasants' agricultural gods were slowly losing the long war
  against energy, brains, and a faith that moves men and women, if not their
  mountains.</p>

  <p>Elsa didn't answer until she had rearranged the packed saddlebags that
  Andrew had left for her. She wanted to think. She took her time about making
  a comfortable heap for Nancy's feet to rest on. Then:</p>

  <p>"I know so little about them. But&mdash;well&mdash;I mean&mdash;how shall
  I say it?&mdash;well, they're Jesuits. I never met any before,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why do you suppose I chose that place to spend the night?"</p>

  <p>"You said: to throw Bulah Singh's spies off the trail&mdash;and to avoid
  meeting busybodies at a dak bungalow&mdash;oh, and because we couldn't make
  the full distance in one day&mdash;and&mdash;I think that was all."</p>

  <p>"Those were only excuses. There was a real reason. Didn't you like the
  Father Superior?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't give me a chance to like him. He didn't like me. I expect he
  guessed that I was brought up to believe Jesuitry is about the vilest human
  trait."</p>

  <p>"So it is," said Nancy. "But the Jesuits didn't invent it. They have less
  of it than most people. Haven't you discovered, with all the reading you have
  done, that politicians, and historians, and priests, and other people with
  axes to grind, always accuse their betters of the very treacheries that they
  themselves use and intend to keep on using?&mdash;Father Patrick is quite an
  authority on Tibet."</p>

  <p>"Is he? I thought he didn't understand Tibetan. He didn't seem to. He
  doesn't talk or look like a man who has traveled much."</p>

  <p>Nancy chuckled. "He traveled Tibet for three years, in disguise, mostly
  alone and on foot. Two of his subordinates are there now&mdash;secretly, of
  course; they can't get permits. The first time I saw Father Patrick was in
  Lhasa. But he didn't see me; or if he did, he didn't know it. That was before
  the war.&mdash;Heavens! If I would only let me, I could be an old woman,
  couldn't I! Nineteen&mdash;never mind&mdash;Curzon was Viceroy. Father
  Patrick was in difficulties&mdash;found out&mdash;caught&mdash;they'd have
  killed him, I think. He was in a dungeon. But Lobsang Pun was in high
  standing in those days. As the diplomatic representative of the Tashi Lama,
  he had the ear of the Dalai Lama. And I was Lobsang Pun's chela. So by being
  very careful I was able to get a plea through edgewise."</p>

  <p>"Were you in disguise?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. But not the way you probably imagine. I was born without a
  trace of a gift for wearing false whiskers. I had to hide myself even from
  me, and it would take a lifetime, almost, to tell how that was done. Letting
  Father Patrick know who helped him was quite out of the question. But they
  let him continue his journey. He carried on for two years after that."</p>

  <p>Elsa was silent for a moment. But she had to say something to relieve the
  feeling of deflated malicious triumph:</p>

  <p>"But what a strange coincidence. Two pelings&mdash;total strangers to each
  other&mdash;crossing trails in Tibet, and one helping the other without the
  other's knowledge."</p>

  <p>"No," said Nancy. "There is no such thing as a coincidence, except to the
  minus-minded intellectuals. To them, of course, everything is a coincidence,
  including creation itself. Poor things, to believe in a Universal
  Intelligence would make them feel too unimportant. But, I grant you, it never
  ceases to be an exciting surprise when things like that do happen, even
  though one knows they must happen. It's a law of nature."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm awfully stupid," said Elsa. "Perhaps I'm minus-minded.
  Which law of nature are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"The first law. The very first one that Lobsang Pun compelled me to
  discover, and recognize, and learn, and practise. The affluence law of supply
  and demand. That is to say, the opposite of the economic law, which governs
  greed, which creates poverty, and blinds us to the truth. The real law is
  that affluence must find work to do. Affluence is positive. Greed and its
  derivatives are negative. Affluence is an indestructible idea, forever
  active, perpetually seeking and finding self-consciousness. No matter where
  we are, nor what our condition may be at any given moment, it is impossible
  to avoid finding someone who can use what we can give. I don't doubt Father
  Patrick was praying to the God created by the Jesuits. That is none of my
  business. The point is: he wasn't pitying himself. So he didn't get between
  himself and the help that is always ready. I remember what I had been
  thinking about: I had been studying Jesus's remark about Solomon and the
  lilies, comparing it with dozens of similar texts in Sanskrit, and with my
  own experience. I was trying to understand the importance of now, and the
  absoluteness of the law of affluence. I wasn't arrayed like a lily, and I was
  equally impotent in any material sense. But I was learning what giving means,
  and how material need is the room made ready for supply. So I became useful,
  and no one suffered by it. Of course, there is only one thing really worth
  giving."</p>

  <p>Elsa made a guess at the answer: "I hope you're not going to say love.
  They all say that. Nobody means it."</p>

  <p>"Me? Love a Jesuit! God forbid!"</p>

  <p>Elsa leaned back and laughed with relief. "Nancy, you're priceless."</p>

  <p>"I deny it! Priceless is an idiotic word. I am a pilgrim on the way toward
  reality, with a long, long way to go. I refuse to be mislabeled. Machiavelli
  and Napoleon, and their imitators, sneered quite accurately about that. They
  were liars in most respects, but they knew enough about themselves to guess
  that everyone in the world has his price, and it is usually cheap. They were
  almost quite right about that. But I am not telling my price. It is being
  notched continually higher. Show me the price, and I'll raise it. The bribe
  would have to be too subtle for me to recognize it. Even so, I'd never stay
  bought! I'd wake up and betray the buyer!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean it that way."</p>

  <p>"I know you didn't. But I did."</p>

  <p>"What is the only one thing worth giving? Go on, tell me. If you had said
  it's love I wouldn't even have tried to believe you. People have said they
  love me, who were so cruel that I would prefer their hatred. I hate them.
  Surely love must be an individual something that one reserves for one's own
  lover, husband, children, friends.&mdash;What is it that's worth giving? Tell
  me."</p>

  <p>"That is for each one to find out for himself," Nancy answered after a
  moment's pause. "Definitions usually defeat their own purpose. Perhaps one
  might almost define the one great gift that we can give to one another as
  spiritual elbowroom. Mind our own business. Give others a chance to find out
  for themselves who and what they really are. The only way to do that is to
  realize who and what we are." Before Elsa could wedge in another question she
  continued: "But let me tell you about Father Patrick. I have a reason for
  telling. It isn't just an excuse."</p>

  <p>Elsa curled up in her corner of the back seat. "Please. I would rather
  listen to you than think my own thoughts."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you pleasantly excited about Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But feeling like a parasite, too. I don't want to think, I want to
  listen."</p>

  <p>"Very well. The second time I met Father Patrick was toward the end of the
  World War, in the year of the influenza epidemic. It spread all around the
  world. It killed more people than the war did&mdash;the best and the worst
  and the mediocrities, all in one obscene corruption. You remember it? Or
  weren't you old enough? Great numbers of people called it the hand of God.
  They did really. The very same people told us that we should love God. But
  the doctors went to work and fought God with all their might. They were at
  their wit's end, but they fought back bravely, without a second's respite. If
  it was God's doing, all the doctors must have been hellions in league with
  the devil. I was on their side, against God. But there seemed to be no
  remedy. Thousands died&mdash;hundreds of thousands. Eleven children in my
  school. Of course, what you can always depend on, happened. Helpless people
  did their best to help one another. Some of the bravest and best work was
  done by stark materialists, who didn't believe in God or devil. The
  professionals&mdash;the salaried prelates&mdash;Hindu&mdash;Moslem
  &mdash;Christian&mdash;tried to save face by commanding us all to pray. We
  were to implore, especially our Christian God, in the name of mercy, to undo
  something, that He had inflicted on us, that was even more devilish than the
  poison gas we had been using in the war, and that we had no intention of not
  using in the next one."</p>

  <p>"I prayed my last prayer to that God long ago," said Elsa. "What did you
  do?"</p>

  <p>"I made dozens of mistakes. Bad ones. The worst was the first. I went off
  on the wrong foot, and that led to all the other mistakes. I went fanatical.
  I tried to prove, at other people's expense, what I hadn't, yet proved at my
  own cost. It didn't occur to me&mdash;not then, in that time of bewildering
  fear&mdash;that I personally had all the faults that I could see in others. I
  was worse even than those insufferable prigs of prelates, because I might
  have known better; I hadn't the disadvantage of their tradition and
  miseducation. I didn't realize that everything vile in my consciousness was
  being boiled to the surface by the conflict between what I knew and what my
  senses saw and believed. I was conceited&mdash;enough to believe that my
  little bit of a bud of evolving consciousness, that had been awakened by a
  great teacher, must already be strong enough to overcome that epidemic, at
  least for my own school. I hadn't the humility to do what I really could have
  done. I had to do what I couldn't. That school&mdash;so it seemed to me
  &mdash;was the fruit of my own labor. It was mine. It was my vineyard. Hadn't
  I tilled it? Wasn't I there, where my own soul put me, for the very purpose
  of protecting those children? Naturally, such nonsense had no effect whatever
  on the course of the epidemic. It didn't change it one way or the other. But
  it got worse and worse for me."</p>

  <p>"In what way worse?"</p>

  <p>"Better, of course, in the long run. But at the time heartbreaking,
  humiliating, cruel. Because I was cruel."</p>

  <p>"How were you cruel?"</p>

  <p>"I was as cruel as a politician. Even more cruel than if I had neglected
  people. I disappointed them. I let them down. I let my ignorance deceive
  them. I betrayed them with pride, instead of protecting them with humility. I
  was worse than King Canute defying the sea&mdash;much worse. He made himself
  ridiculous to teach a lesson to fools."</p>

  <p>"Then isn't your philosophy any use in a crisis?"</p>

  <p>"Philosophy? Have I insulted you?"</p>

  <p>"No. Of course you haven't."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever read Cardinal Newman?"</p>

  <p>"No. Wasn't he the Protestant bishop who switched over and became a
  Catholic?"</p>

  <p>"It makes no difference what he became," said Nancy. "Greater men than he
  have become beggars, not cardinals. Nevertheless, he was very great. He saved
  many a poor wretch from hopelessness."</p>

  <p>"Wasn't it he who wrote 'Lead, Kindly Light'?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He also wrote: 'Knowledge is one thing, virtue is another ...
  Philosophy, however enlightened, however profound, gives no command over the
  passions, no influential motives, no vivifying principles.' Memorize that,
  and have nothing to do with philosophy, it's no good."</p>

  <p>"But how does that fit the influenza epidemic? I don't see the
  connection."</p>

  <p>"I knew, what every genuine thinker has known since the dawn of history,
  that epidemics&mdash;and endemics, too, are a product of the subconscious
  mind of humanity. The only actual substance of that stuff is the fear that
  builds up the illusion and all its consequences. That is why Jesus called it
  'a liar, and the father of it.' The mass mind fears and consequently creates
  vengeance upon its own secret swinishness. It's a vicious circle. I had
  challenged the whole ocean of subconsciousness, including my own
  subconsciousness. Little me! Single-handed! So, of course, the vile stuff
  came in through my doors and windows. As I told you, eleven children died.
  Two teachers. Then the overworked government and private doctors asked for
  one of my buildings for use as a hospital. I lent them two buildings. They
  became a morgue. Corpses! Corpses!"</p>

  <p>Nancy was silent for several minutes. Then she threw a mood aside and
  suddenly continued: "Spiritual arrogance was the mischief in me. That is a
  dirtier thing than any pathological disease. Always the most difficult thing
  is to detect our own falsehoods. I found it finally&mdash;tore it out of my
  consciousness&mdash;killed it. But that stuff is a phoenix. It reappears when
  you least expect it, out of the ashes of one's own pride. However, I had
  killed it for the time being. And then I really did go to work."</p>

  <p>"What did you do?"</p>

  <p>"I used every last human resource available. Money, credit, energy. Then,
  when there wasn't anything left, I prayed. I had a right to pray then. I had
  emptied the bin."</p>

  <p>"But, Nancy, you don't believe in prayer! You said so!"</p>

  <p>"Did I? Don't I! Well, you are right. That's true, I don't believe in it.
  I know it. So I can't possibly believe or disbelieve. Prayer consists in
  knowing, and in glorying in what one knows. But what can one expect, if one
  prays to the very liar and the father of the trouble that one wants to
  overcome? I hadn't really been praying at all. I had been flattering my
  personal ego, and what the Hindus call maya. But now I really began to pray.
  First for as much humility as I could possibly endure. Humility until it
  hurt. I demanded it. Not, meekness, humility."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, what a weird prayer!"</p>

  <p>"And because I wasn't lying this time, and the Lord is my shepherd, I
  received what I asked for&mdash;some humility. Some. Then I remembered the
  parable of the Prodigal Son. It paraphrased itself: 'Soul, I have sinned
  against my being, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called even
  thy person.'"</p>

  <p>"Nancy, that's very beautiful. But how could you pray to your soul if you
  are your soul? Isn't that the opposite of what you've been telling me, over
  and over, for three days?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, words!" said Nancy. "Words! What feeble instruments they are. What
  liars they are! We experience a glimpse of reality. But can we tell it? Not
  even the poets can tell. Not even Shakespeare could. Even Jesus's words have
  been twisted to mean the opposite of what he did mean. Elsa, each of us must
  make our own experience. After that, we know. And though we can still commit
  treason, we can never again quite unknow. We will always know, after we once
  have known, that it is treason we commit when we identify ourselves with the
  illusion and obey that. Then we feel homesick when we do wrong. But upward
  evolution is a wordless experience. We can't tell it, not in actual words. We
  can only hint to those we wish to help. Does this help you to understand: I
  yearned upward toward my superconscious being&mdash;my real being&mdash;
  toward beauty and intelligence and light&mdash;and prayed for enough
  intelligence to do the beautifully right thing now&mdash;the right little
  thing&mdash;the exactly right thing&mdash;not next week&mdash;now! The prayer
  was answered, instantly, although it didn't seem so at the moment."</p>

  <p>"Then you didn't really know it had been answered?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I knew. But I hadn't tried to instruct wisdom, so of course I
  didn't know what form the answer would take. It began to dawn on me that I
  was only a beginner. I was a recruit, not a commander in chief, in a war
  against a whole world's ignorance, my own included. I had been trying to do
  what not even Jesus attempted. Then I saw my teacher."</p>

  <p>"Old Ugly-face?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. All that time, I hadn't been able even to call up a mental picture
  of him. But I saw him clearly now. I was clairvoyant again&mdash;just a
  little&mdash;not much&mdash;but enough. I wasn't clairaudient. He said
  nothing. But I knew I was on the way again. It restored my faith. Then the
  phone rang. A total stranger asked whether I could spare a nurse for the
  Jesuit Mission."</p>

  <p>"The Mission where we stayed last night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Of course, there wasn't a spare nurse. I couldn't even spare myself
  for more than a few hours. But by getting one of the overworked teachers to
  do a double shift to relieve me, and by going without sleep&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You mean, you were doing nursing duty all this time?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>"From the way you told it, I supposed you had been meditating."</p>

  <p>Nancy raised an eyebrow. "Your 'supposer,' my dear, is just a trifle out
  of order. It needs adjusting.&mdash;I drove to the Jesuit Mission and found
  them in a terrible way, burying their own dead. Priests using shovels.
  Converts and servants, some dead, some dying, two or three half dead from
  overwork, and the rest run away. Luckily I had brought some supplies. Those
  Jesuits had given away everything. They were living, or rather dying, on
  native bread and boiled rice. They hadn't missed a mass. Father Patrick had
  been given up for dead&mdash;extreme unction and all the rest of it. He was
  alone in a room, so I wrapped him in blankets and carried him off in the
  tonga. No car in those days. The other Jesuits were so weak they could hardly
  help me to lift him. Fortunately he was unconscious, so he couldn't resist.
  The tonga jolted him pretty badly. He almost did die on the way to
  Darjeeling. But he recovered. He and I have been respectful of each other's
  claws ever since."</p>

  <p>"Claws?"</p>

  <p>"Two tigers in a forest. We politely admire each other."</p>

  <p>"But wasn't he grateful?"</p>

  <p>"My dear! Why in the world should he be grateful to me? He remembered his
  manners, if that is what you mean. But how could a man, who is convinced that
  God is the dispenser of all good, possibly be grateful to anyone but God? He
  was quite consistent. Jesuits are soldiers, remember. Should a soldier on the
  field of battle be grateful to another soldier from a different regiment, who
  has merely obeyed the command of the Great Commander in Chief? Acknowledge
  his quality, yes. Salute him as a fellow soldier, yes. But gratitude?"</p>

  <p>"Nancy, you talk almost as if you were a Jesuit!"</p>

  <p>Nancy squealed with merry memory. "Elsa, Father Patrick and I both made
  the mistake of beginning to try to convert each other, for the glory of each
  other's Lord. We began by delicately hinting at each other's underlying
  error. He accused me of Jesuitry. I called him a materialist. Honestly we
  did. We both meant it, and we still think that about each other."</p>

  <p>"I can believe anything about a Jesuit," said Elsa, "but I still don't
  understand why we went there last night. Do they know I am going to
  Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"They do."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that! Who can have told them?"</p>

  <p>"There is very little that goes on that the Jesuits don't know!"</p>

  <p>"Then it is true that their spies are everywhere?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly. They don't even bother themselves to ask questions.
  Jesuits think. They are trained, highly organized, disciplined thinkers. They
  create a positive&mdash;call it that, just to give it a name&mdash;a positive
  thought-force that is immeasurably stronger than any electric current. An
  electric current is a mere illustration of thought-force. Jesuits are
  plus-minded, positive, dynamic thinkers. They induce, without even trying to,
  a secondary thought-force in others. So the minus-minded, negative people
  keep them plied with information, very often without knowing it."</p>

  <p>"But why should Father Patrick accuse you of Jesuitry? You of all
  people!"</p>

  <p>"He considers me a casuist. He believes I can't understand the difference
  between his way and mine."</p>

  <p>"Do you understand it?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps there isn't any. But the signs read that he took a vow of poverty
  and obedience. I took a vow of affluence and disobedience."</p>

  <p>"A vow? Did you? Of disobedience to whom? You obey your spiritual teacher,
  don't you? I understood you to say that."</p>

  <p>"Disobedience, yes, to the death. Rebellion, with every scrap of intuition
  and common sense and courage I can muster&mdash;against the atrocious lie
  that we are miserable paupers with souls that need saving. My dear, a soul
  that needed saving wouldn't be worth the trouble."</p>

  <p>"I still don't understand why we went to the Jesuit Mission."</p>

  <p>"To demonstrate to you the impossibility&mdash;at least for anyone of your
  limited experience&mdash;of thinking independently, in opposition to highly
  organized and well-disciplined thought. I wanted to teach you tactics, as
  well as strategy."</p>

  <p>"Then there's a way of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Three ways. Two are defeatist. One can dive below their influence, and go
  to the devil. Thousands of people do it; they drown in materialism;
  deserting, malingering, degenerate Jesuits do it themselves. Another way is,
  to oppose, be beaten, and surrender: become a meek lamb and wait until you
  are dead to find out what it is that you bought by surrendering your soul to
  trustees. Or, you can rise above it. Not even a Jesuit can out-think, or out-
  pray you, if you refuse to meet him on his own ground. Take higher ground.
  One only learns by experience how to avoid being caught. If a Jesuit knew
  there is a higher ground, he would get there first and have a sheepfold all
  ready to herd you into. They are good shepherds, if you like being a sheep.
  Their strength consists in thought-propaganda, which is far more powerful
  than the spoken or printed word. Propaganda, even when true, is a form of
  violence, which is a product of impatience, which in turn is sacrifice to
  fear."</p>

  <p>"But, Nancy, isn't your conversation propaganda?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Make no mistake about that. But it is aimed at freeing your
  consciousness now, instead of enslaving you for the sake of a promised land
  in the hereafter. Yes, mine is propaganda. But if you should let it control
  your thought instead of waking you up to fight your own battle, I would
  repudiate you. I would shake you off."</p>

  <p>"Tell me this, Nancy. You say you prayed. Then your teacher sent you to
  save a Jesuit."</p>

  <p>"Indeed he did not!"</p>

  <p>"But you said you saw Old Ugly-face, and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My seeing him meant this: that through humility I had reached a state
  &mdash;or let us call it a balance of consciousness&mdash;not too remote from
  his. I was, at least momentarily, on the higher plane of consciousness that
  he had taught me how to attain. I was catching up with him. A real idea could
  reach me. It could penetrate the mess of opinions I had been floundering in.
  A real idea knows no boundaries, no limits; no one can monopolize it. And
  there is no such thing as a partial, incomplete idea, nor any possibility of
  an idea not finding work to do. Consequently, because of that law of supply
  and demand, some total stranger was stirred by the same idea, and he phoned
  me to ask for the loan of a nurse."</p>

  <p>"But you hadn't one!"</p>

  <p>"Well? The idea set me moving in the right direction. It employed me. It
  saved the life of Father Patrick. And among many other things it made it
  possible for you, all these years later, to return to Tibet."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, are you stretching your imagination?"</p>

  <p>"No, dear. But I do hope I am awakening yours. It so needs it!"</p>

  <p>"What has Father Patrick to do with my returning to Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"It would be a breach of confidence to answer that question. Someone
  &mdash;not Father Patrick&mdash;warned me by telephone&mdash;and I told
  Morgan Lewis&mdash;that Bulah Singh's meddling had alarmed the Chief of
  Police of Sikkim. You and Andrew would have been held up if that warning
  hadn't come through. And it would not have come through unless Father Patrick
  and I were on excellent terms. But understand me: Father Patrick himself did
  not send the warning."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, do you really feel you can trust him?"</p>

  <p>"So implicitly, my dear, that I would tell him anything he might ask,
  unless it had been told to me in strict confidence."</p>

  <p>Elsa laughed. She couldn't help it. "Nancy, you're too bewildering! Just
  now you said God forbid you should love a Jesuit!"</p>

  <p>"Yes." She chuckled. "I hope God heard me! Does this answer your question?
  I am my soul. I am not this foolish old woman-person who gets disturbed by
  illusions, and hates Jesuits, and sometimes has a headache. Doesn't that
  apply equally to Father Patrick? He is a brave, unselfish soul. Integrity is
  one of his dimensions. He isn't that superstitious masochist who hates
  talkative females and crosses himself when he sees me coming. He is a soldier
  in a shabby soutane. Father Patrick is one of the few men I know who forces
  me to remember who I really am, and who he really is. He wouldn't be
  endurable on any other terms. That is what Jesus meant by saying love your
  enemies. Don't love their objectionable persons, or expect them to love
  yours. Love them by remembering who they really are. Then they will love you.
  Do you see the difference?"</p>

  <p>"I am beginning to. Does it always work?"</p>

  <p>"You mean for beginners like you and me? No indeed! Not in one lifetime!
  Not in this world! We have a long way to go before we can finish that part of
  our education. So we had better get a good start, hadn't we?"</p>

  <p>"But if it's really true, why doesn't it always work?"</p>

  <p>"Does the Golden Rule work when applied by a conceited egotist? Torquemada
  thought he was obeying the Golden Rule when he tortured heretics. The rule is
  really so simple that the complicated illusion of personality blinds us to
  it. We can only learn gradually, little by little. But each little that we
  learn is one step on the road of evolution."</p>

  <p>"Nancy. Tell me this. If I should try to follow your teaching, do you
  think it would help me to become Tom's real wife, so that he and I would love
  each other and be genuinely happy?"</p>

  <p>Nancy studied her a moment. "Genuine? Happy? How should I know? Happiness,
  remember, is a temporary state of mind&mdash;a temporary calm, destroyed by
  the first ripple that comes along. As an end in itself it is like the pot of
  gold at the end of the rainbow. As something to have and to hold, it is as
  disappointing as money."</p>

  <p>"But we can't get along without money. And unless we're happy now and
  then, what is life worth living for? We'd be better off dead&mdash;
  annihilated&mdash;nonexistent. I have often wished that might happen to me.
  Can't you offer some encouragement about Tom and me?"</p>

  <p>Nancy thought a moment. Then: "I was never tempted to become a fortune
  teller. What I can tell you is this: happiness is either a fool's paradise,
  or else a by-product of continual striving toward spiritual consciousness.
  True happiness is a sensation of momentary balance. When we remember who and
  what we really are, we do no wrong and we injure no one. Even our worst
  mistakes turn out to others' benefit; and they become profitable lessons for
  us."</p>

  <p>"But how can one learn all this! Oh, how I wish you were coming with us to
  Tibet! Weeks and weeks on the march, and you to talk with. One
  might&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nancy's laugh interrupted: "Does it occur to you, my dear, that
  selfishness isn't a wish? It is a repudiation of your own higher
  intelligence."</p>

  <p>"Oh. No, I hadn't thought of that. I suppose it was selfish. You have been
  utterly kind in coming this far. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tonight," said Nancy, "if we are both as unselfish as we can make
  ourselves be, I will help you to see why you don't need me. I can prove it to
  you."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24">CHAPTER 24</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Elsa and Nancy made themselves more comfortable in the
  smoke-smeared monastery guest room than Andrew had done three nights earlier.
  Andrew, confusing luxury with comfort, usually dispensed with both when
  alone, although he wasn't, like Tom Grayne, a Spartan about it; for his own
  purposes, they merely weren't worth worrying about. Elsa, on the other hand,
  intuitively knew which little luxuries make discomfort bearable; and Nancy
  was an old, old hand at creating comfort where there was none. So the car had
  disgorged some inconsiderable trifles, and the gloomy room became a swept and
  habitable refuge.</p>

  <p>The bearded old chauffeur, shawled in double blankets, sat on a mat
  outside the door, protecting his lunatic charges against only God could guess
  what consequences of their madness. He even stood off the monks who brought
  food&mdash;himself carried in the food&mdash;himself tasted it first in
  Nancy's presence to make sure the monks hadn't doped it with magical drugs
  &mdash;himself carried out the dishes and set them at a distance down the
  corridor where the kitchen crew might recover them without bringing their
  devilish persons too near. He had eaten his own dry corn and peas porridge.
  No monkish muck for him. He had brought his old army water bottle, filled in
  Darjeeling at a hydrant on which no priestly shadow had ever cast its curse.
  By the light of a Japanese lantern he sat reading a Life of Lenin&mdash;
  mistranslated from the French, with footnotes and interpolated comments by a
  babu* who had been to Moscow. Revolution snorted through the old man's
  nostrils as he read.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>babu, baboo</i> (Hindi)&mdash;gentleman; used as a
  Hindi courtesy title; equivalent to English "Mr"; also: a Hindu clerk who is
  literate in English; also, when used derogatively: a native of India who has

  <p>Nancy and Elsa, in their own folding canvas chairs, sat talking, less at
  random (though it sounded like it) than for the sake of avoiding a moody
  silence or any reference to Elsa's baby. This was the first, and next to the
  last, room that the tent-born baby had lived in. Each woman dreaded the
  other's reaction to any mention of it. Particularly, Elsa dreaded to be told
  that her secret sweet-sad longing for the child was morbid self-pity. She
  knew it wasn't, but she felt sure Nancy would say it was. Nancy, full of her
  own intention, was afraid of a mood that might make Elsa past-bound and
  unreceptive. So they talked about the monastery, and about the learned old
  arch hypocrite who ruled it and was all things by turns but nothing long
  &mdash;excepting always a keeper of secrets.</p>

  <p>"Old Gombaria understands," said Nancy, "that secrecy is a secret's only
  value. That is why he can be trusted. He hoards secrets like a jackdaw."</p>

  <p>But memories are irrepressible, one leading to the next. Elsa could hardly
  keep her eyes away from the smoke-smeared painting on the wall by the bed.
  The patch where Andrew's handkerchief had rubbed away the soot was still
  noticeable. On her way southward she had lain with her child in her arms,
  staring at the picture of the woman being boiled in oil in hell. All the
  thoughts of those hours returned, now, unbidden, including the questions with
  which she had tortured Andrew's patience. Especially she had wondered how,
  when, why religious men had invented such cruel eternities in store for one
  another. She had thought about the Spanish Inquisition; and about Dante's
  Inferno, and Fox's Book of Martyrs; the vicar at home had lent her both
  books, illustrated in fiendish detail, during his efforts to convict her of
  the Witch of Endor's sin of seeing with unveiled eyes. She had discussed
  those books with Andrew&mdash;forced him to discuss them. In her mind's eye
  she saw him now, seated on one of the bent-wood chairs, imperturbably
  answering child-like questions while he carved away at a chunk of wood with
  his clasp knife. He had remarked, in one of his frowning, analytical moments,
  that torture, in any circumstances, probably reveals the victim's own latent
  cruelty. She had disagreed. They had argued about it and she lost her temper
  because he had refused to lose his. After that, he had read to her from his
  old, thumbed copy of Browning. Andrew always chanted poetry, maintaining that
  to read it in an ordinary conversational voice is to neglect the magic that
  conveys its meaning. She could almost hear him now, as if the walls retained
  the record:</p>

  <p class="poem">" ... I count life just a stuff<br>
  To try the soul's strength on."</p>

  <p>The baby had fallen asleep to the sound of his reading. She remembered
  wondering what Andrew's child would be like if he should ever marry. And then
  she wondered what Andrew would say to a woman he loved, and whether any woman
  ever would understand him. She didn't. He was as dependable, but as
  incomprehensible as&mdash;Suddenly Elsa left her chair and pulled the bed
  away from the wall.</p>

  <p>"Nancy! Come here! Look! Andrew got my message! Here is his answer!
  Scrawled on the wall below the picture!"</p>

  <p>Nancy's face assumed a mask-like expression. She was not very good at
  assuming indifference. She was depending on the momentum of events rather
  than on any skill of her own to get Elsa into the mood for what was coming.
  "Does he say he received the telegram?" she asked, guarding her voice.</p>

  <p>"He says he got both messages! Both! Was there more than one
  telegram?"</p>

  <p>"No. Didn't I tell you? Morgan Lewis asked Mu-ni Gam-po to spatchcock our
  'cat' message into his routine telegram to Gombaria. That was all. A telegram
  addressed direct to Andrew might have made the Sikkim police inquisitive.
  With no other motive than to do their duty they might easily force the Indian
  Government to stop you and Andrew from crossing the frontier."</p>

  <p>"Then the other message must have been the mental one I sent him! He did
  get it! Nancy, he got it! It worked!"</p>

  <p>"Well? Why not? I suspected it would reach him."</p>

  <p>"When? When did you suspect it? You never mentioned it to me."</p>

  <p>"Three nights ago&mdash;when you sent it, with your hands over your face,
  at my fireside, while we were talking about the pistol, just before you and I
  went to bed."</p>

  <p>"Nancy!"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Are you imagining things? That can't be right. It's impossible. Wasn't
  Andrew here the night after he left Darjeeling?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Only one night. He left here at daybreak. I enquired when we arrived
  this evening."</p>

  <p>"Then how can he possibly have got my message? If he had got it on the
  way, at the time when I sent it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then he would almost certainly have turned back," said Nancy.</p>

  <p>"There are two messages on the wall, one above the other. The first reads:
  Hurry forward. Don't let them delay you. Below that, there's an arrow
  pointing to the figure 2, and then the second one. It reads: Got second
  message. Okay.&mdash;Nancy, do come and look."</p>

  <p>"Why? I can take your word for it."</p>

  <p>"But, Nancy, if Andrew did get my mental message, in this room, after he
  received the telegram, then it must have been almost one whole day after I
  sent it!"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"How is that possible? It isn't possible. It can't be."</p>

  <p>Nancy checked an impulse to explain too much, too soon. Truth can't be
  taught. But it is learnable. She came back with a question: "Would you
  describe Andrew as clairvoyant?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think so. Perhaps just a little bit. Sometimes he seems to
  know what one is going to say before one says it. But Andrew doesn't invite
  that kind of intimacy. That was the first time I ever dared to try to send a
  message to him. I wouldn't have then, if you hadn't been reading the riot act
  about my meekness. And it did seem so important that he should know about the
  pistol."</p>

  <p>"There are two reasons why I think you reached him," said Nancy. "Andrew
  loves poetry. I don't mean merely likes&mdash;he loves it."</p>

  <p>"He never even tries to write it," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>Nancy retorted irritably: "Andrew thrills to the spirit that poetry brings
  into consciousness even more than most music does. It's the old story of the
  man of action revering spiritual thought but despising its mouthpiece: the
  man at arms and the noncombatant chaplain. Andrew is too inherently courteous
  to admit it, even to himself, but he considers a poet a kind of weakling
  without the dignity to resist emotional impulse."</p>

  <p>Elsa agreed: "Andrew resists all his impulses, except the generous ones.
  One can almost see him hold them off and look at them as if they were
  something offered for sale."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Nancy. "Poetry thrills him. It awakens his consciousness,
  but simultaneously reveals to him his own shortcomings. So he resists the
  very force that makes him able to distinguish between good and evil. There is
  nothing unusual about that. To a greater or lesser extent we all do it. We
  won't let truth into our consciousness, because it shows us the humiliating
  meanness of the lies we live by."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean by that, that Andrew is a liar, or that he's
  clairvoyant?"</p>

  <p>"Both," said Nancy. "Unwillingly in each instance. If he weren't a liar he
  wouldn't be human. He has set his strength against clairvoyance. But no lover
  of poetry ever lived who could shut out clairvoyant visions. If he is
  vicious, vile visions. If he drinks, drunken visions. If he is honest, true
  visions. One can tell almost anyone's true character by the kind of poetry he
  loves."</p>

  <p>"Andrew loves strong poetry," said Elsa. "He despises what he calls kiss-
  mammy stuff, and decadence, and phony realism. He says the test of poetry is
  that you must hear the wild harps thrumming when you chant it aloud.&mdash;
  But what is your other reason for thinking he really saw my message?"</p>

  <p>"Your motive," Nancy answered. "It was almost totally unselfish, as far as
  I can judge. And Andrew's situation. Being in this room must have brought you
  into his thought. Mere memory would do that. The monks here do almost-
  nothing but experimental thinking. It isn't very spiritual, but they create a
  maelstrom of thought that attracts all sorts of phenomena&mdash;good, bad,
  indifferent&mdash;just the opposite of the Jesuits."</p>

  <p>"We had a dose of Jesuits," said Elsa. "It was impossible to think there
  &mdash;I mean&mdash;well, we talked about it&mdash;you explained it."</p>

  <p>"It was good for you," Nancy retorted. "Elsa, unless you learn how to
  guard your thought against intruding influences, even better than the Jesuits
  guard theirs, you would be far better off among Jesuits than at the mercy of
  your own craving to be of some use in the world. Better a bigoted
  disciplinarian than no guide. One's personal opinion, no matter how
  obstinate, is as porous as a sponge. It absorbs whatever it is soaked in.
  Squeeze it, and out come its secrets."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, there must be lots of exceptions to that. Andrew can keep secrets.
  So can you. I can read some people's thought without even trying. I can read
  Tom's almost always. But Andrew's never&mdash;not when he covers up."</p>

  <p>"Andrew is like anyone else," said Nancy. "The only possible protection
  &mdash;the only one&mdash;against mental intrusion, burglary, bullying,
  blackmail, propaganda, tyranny, dictatorship&mdash;is to be a soul and to be
  conscious of it. Control your person, instead of the other way around. Don't
  be a tail trying to wag the dog, or an orchestra trying to direct the
  conductor."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, are you sure it wasn't you who sent the mental message to
  Andrew?"</p>

  <p>Nancy smiled. She didn't answer the question directly: "I was minding my
  own business. Let me tell you what I think happened."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would. I feel as scared, inside me, as if I had broken a law.
  Oh, Nancy, I don't want to be clairvoyant! I don't! I won't! I hate it!"</p>

  <p>"Chickens," said Nancy, "can't get back into the egg. They must learn to
  take care of themselves. Shall I tell you what I think happened?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! Please!"</p>

  <p>"Andrew must have been thinking of you, or he would not have written the
  first message on the wall. Later, he received the telegram. Very likely
  Gombaria brought it to him. It would be just like Gombaria to make a mystery
  about it. He experiments. Gombaria is a very expert manipulator of mental
  atmosphere."</p>

  <p>"Atmosphere?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. That is only a phrase. One has to use words to suggest meanings that
  words can't convey. Gombaria can, and perhaps did, create a psychic field in
  which phenomena can easily occur. That is another phrase. It is worthless
  except as a hint. The reading of the telegram would direct Andrew's attention
  instantly and very strongly to you. The suddenness, and unexpectedness would
  shock him enough to make him let go of his own thoughts. He would see your
  thought. He couldn't possibly keep it out of his consciousness. I believe he
  would see your mental picture before he would see you. That would be
  normal."</p>

  <p>"But, Nancy! Twenty hours after I sent it?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? Time has nothing to do with it. That is one of the many reasons
  why time&mdash;and fact-bound intellectuals can't grasp clairvoyance. It is
  why professional clairvoyants almost always prove unreliable."</p>

  <p>"You mean fortune tellers?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. They become confused when they try to translate infinity into time.
  But there is another reason: the economic one."</p>

  <p>"What on earth do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Humanity is gradually, very slowly evolving toward pure super-
  consciousness, in which there can be no such concept as profit and loss. On
  the intermediate levels, such as you and I can reach, the profit and loss
  illusion puts up a fight. It tempts us with suggestions that lead into
  disastrous mental quicksands, in which we flounder and lose all sense of
  direction. That is the meaning of the temptation of Jesus by the devil."</p>

  <p>"But can the world be run on any other basis than profit and loss?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it can't, as long as people are hypnotized by the personal
  profit and loss illusion. Every materialistic effort to change conditions
  only provides different opportunities for exploitation. The old exploiters
  become the new victims, and vice versa."</p>

  <p>"Then what is the answer?"</p>

  <p>"Gradually, as we struggle upward toward soul consciousness, the illusion
  loses its hypnotic grip. We begin then to be free to think clearly and to
  solve problems sanely. We leave off trying to fill holes with shadows.
  Instead, we fill them with ideas that develop their own substance. But it
  follows that a clairvoyant&mdash;seeing on a spiritual plane but working for
  material personal profit&mdash;and especially for dishonest profit &mdash;is
  committing spiritual treason. That is why gamblers and spies and criminals
  who use clairvoyance, as many of them consciously do, invariably meet
  disaster. Clairvoyance perverted to treacherous ends becomes spiritual
  suicide. Sometimes it leads to the madhouse. It is always, without any
  exception&mdash;without any possible exception&mdash;ruinous to the one who
  misuses it."</p>

  <p>"God!" said Elsa. "Nancy&mdash;tell me&mdash;did I misuse it when I sent
  that message to Andrew?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly. Relatively speaking, it was an unselfish message. None of
  us humans can be quite unselfish as long as we have our personalities to care
  for. But you were not trying to make a profit or to mislead Andrew. You were
  trying to give him information, weren't you? Now tell me something."</p>

  <p>"What? I'll tell you anything I know."</p>

  <p>"Did you know that Bompo Tsering was the go-between who ordered that
  pistol shot fired at you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. When he opened the window, and Andrew spoke to him, I knew it then.
  I knew it even before that. That was why I wanted to speak to him. I was
  quite sure he was up to mischief."</p>

  <p>"Did you hope, when you sent the message, that Bompo Tsering would be
  punished for his treachery?"</p>

  <p>"I never even thought of it. My only impulse was to tell Andrew what had
  happened. To protect him. I mean, so that he could protect himself."</p>

  <p>"That is what saved Andrew."</p>

  <p>"How do you mean that, Nancy? I don't understand you."</p>

  <p>"It is a good example of how clairvoyance works when there is no
  vindictive, or envious, or profit-seeking motive. Probably&mdash;of course I
  can't be quite sure about this, but probably Andrew would have turned back if
  he had got your message at once. That might have been disastrous. It would
  have frightened Bulah Singh, who would almost certainly have tried to save
  himself by accusing Morgan Lewis of connivance in a plot to cross the
  frontier. That would have done Bulah Singh no good, but it would have been
  the end of Andrew's expedition."</p>

  <p>"I still can't see why Andrew didn't get my message the moment I sent
  it."</p>

  <p>"Because your impulse to protect him did protect him."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"If you had loaded your thought with malice against Bompo Tsering&mdash;
  or with opinions about what Andrew should do&mdash;or with some profit
  motive, you would have robbed the message of its protective element."</p>

  <p>"I still don't understand."</p>

  <p>"Paradoxically, because time is not an element in clairvoyance, the
  message could select the right time. And because space is not a limitation of
  clairvoyance, it could select the line of least resistance and reach him
  here, at the proper moment, where it is easier than in most other places for
  a psychic incident to happen. The wrong motive would have spoiled that
  &mdash;might have prevented it altogether."</p>

  <p>The old chauffeur opened the door and stood, shawled and breathing
  Leninism through his loyal nose, awaiting orders. He made a jerky gesture
  with his head. Nancy nodded. He went out, closing the door with a thud that
  verged on the edge of the brink of insolence and needed benefit of doubt to
  save even that verdict.</p>

  <p>"I told him to let me know," said Nancy, "before going to find out whether
  Gombaria is ready to receive us."</p>

  <p>"He seems awfully angry."</p>

  <p>"Yes. He thinks Gombaria should come humbly. He considers my dignity is
  being disregarded. And he knows that searchers will visit this room in our
  absence."</p>

  <p>"Had we better lock our bags before we&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No. Leave them open. Be generous. Save Gombaria's monks from the
  indignity of picking locks. They wouldn't dream of taking anything. They will
  only look. Gombaria likes to know everything&mdash;everything&mdash;and to
  tell nothing."</p>

  <p>"He sounds a bit unscrupulous," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Well, he is, and he is not," Nancy answered. "He is like all the rest of
  us&mdash;a human being in search of his soul. Sometimes I suspect him of
  delaying the search for the sake of intellectual amusement. But not always.
  And he sends children to my school when he considers them too intelligent to
  become monks. So I mustn't be too critical."</p>

  <p>"Broad-minded enough to send children to your school?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and to pay generously."</p>

  <p>"But so stupid that he spies into handbags?"</p>

  <p>"We all average out," said Nancy. "Remember: philosophy is not virtue.
  Gombaria knows one very important thing that you haven't learned yet."</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>"Not to expect too much from people. And not to expect too little from
  life, but to insist on more and more intelligent enjoyment of every moment
  that he lives.&mdash;I hear my old tiger coming back, so wrap yourself in a
  shawl. It will be cold in the corridors. Are you ready? It is very bad
  manners to keep the ruler of a monastery waiting."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25">CHAPTER 25</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Elsa began to feel terrified. The fear was inside her,
  subjective, not due to physical surroundings. It was a wordless sensation,
  unexplainable, comfortless. It brought up memories of punishment at
  school&mdash;a helpless dread. But she acted brave, like a novice in no-man's
  land. She and Nancy followed the old turbaned chauffeur along dim, draughty
  corridors.</p>

  <p>She didn't for one second doubt her intuition that Nancy was leading her
  to an experience that would mean farewell&mdash;perhaps to Nancy. Farewell,
  and a new unknown beginning. It was a sensation of lonely dread. But
  curiosity was stronger than dread&mdash;much stronger. She knew that Nancy
  was also hard-pressed to subdue emotion.</p>

  <p>Nancy said never a word as the old Mahratta's lantern danced in time to
  his martial stride, making weird shadows leap on the walls. Their footsteps
  rang with a kind of frosty brittleness. There were echoes. Somewhere ahead in
  the gloom a monk with spinning prayer wheel was leading the way through hewn
  tunnels; they saw his back as he turned corners, up and down masonry
  stairways that followed the pattern of the mountain top to which the
  buildings clung.</p>

  <p>They passed, in almost breathless silence, through a long, dim room where
  Elsa recognized two monks from Mu-ni Gam-po's monastery. There were dozens of
  monks in the room, perhaps a hundred of them, all lined against the walls
  beneath faded banners and shadowy oil paintings. The two whom she knew made
  no sign of recognition. One of them had carried charcoal and hot water to her
  cell all winter in Darjeeling. She had talked with him many a time. The other
  one had been too talkative. He had brought her the ancient books from Mu-ni
  Gam-po's library, and he had marveled that a girl should know Tibetan. He
  loved to watch her turn it into English, and was pleased because she used a
  brush to write with, on parchment paper, so that each letter and each word
  was a thing of beauty. He had wanted to stay in the room and singsong the
  Tibetan text that he knew by heart. He had been hard to get rid of. But now,
  standing against the wall, with incongruous Jodhpur riding breeches showing
  under his long traveling coat, he was as blank-faced and immobile as if he
  had never seen her.</p>

  <p>They had to pass through the refectory to reach the room where Gombaria
  awaited them&mdash;long tables, backless benches, a rancid reek of butter, an
  image of Chenrezi looming in the gloom. Then another narrow tunnel, hewn
  through a projection on the face of the cliff. It opened into a foursquare
  chamber, half rock, half masonry, with a door at the farther end, but no
  window. Stifling, silent, cold. There they were kept waiting. The monk who
  had led the way stood telling his beads, facing the door with his back toward
  them.</p>

  <p>"This," said Nancy in an almost inaudible voice, "is where Lopsang Pun
  received initiation from his own great teacher."</p>

  <p>"You mean where we stand now?"</p>

  <p>"No. In the chamber beyond that door."</p>

  <p>Silence. An insufferable tension. Then:</p>

  <p>"Who was his teacher?"</p>

  <p>Nancy, for once, seemed at a loss for words. Then, suddenly, as if angry
  at the question: "Who taught Jesus&mdash;Pythagoras&mdash;St. Paul?"</p>

  <p>Silence again, Elsa studying Nancy's face that was lighted from below by
  the old Mahratta's lantern. It was like a wonderfully cut cameo on soot-black
  jet.</p>

  <p>"Nancy, are you an initiate?"</p>

  <p>"Sh-s-sh!"</p>

  <p>"But are you?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>The monosyllable forbade more questions. But Nancy suddenly relented, or
  perceived an opportunity. She added, slightly louder, so that each word was
  distinct and the monk might have heard, had he listened:</p>

  <p>"By their fruits ye shall know them. And by yours they will know you."</p>

  <p>"Who will? You mean the initiates?"</p>

  <p>"No initiate would say he is one unless his soul should warn him to remind
  a younger soul that there is law, authority&mdash;a hierarchy higher than
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>"Well then, how should one know he is genuine?"</p>

  <p>"His claim would prove itself. There would be no conceit, no power-hunger
  to prevent that."</p>

  <p>A long pause, while the monk's beads clicked and the old Mahratta fidgeted
  with the lantern. There was no other sound. Then:</p>

  <p>"Nancy, what are we waiting for?"</p>

  <p>"For Gombaria's summons."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, are you frightened? You look it."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"I am."</p>

  <p>"Sh-s-sh! Not so loud. Try to keep calm."</p>

  <p>"It's cold here. Nancy, what happens at an initiation?"</p>

  <p>"You will not know that until your own turn comes."</p>

  <p>"My turn? Must it? What if I refuse&mdash;if I don't wish it?"</p>

  <p>"Wishing would delay the day," said Nancy. "Haste is only churning of
  illusion. You will know when your time is at hand. Be still. Be patient."</p>

  <p>Silence again. Elsa could hear her own heartbeat. She stared at the wormy
  old door, and at the monk's back, and at the stalwart, military shoulders of
  the old Mahratta. She tried to imagine the iron, inscrutable Ringding Gelong
  Lama Old Ugly-face, on his stubborn knees in an embroidered crimson robe like
  a cardinal's, receiving someone's laying on of hands. But she recognized that
  as a picture she had seen in the National Gallery. She dismissed it.</p>

  <p>"Nancy."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Who chooses candidates for initiation?"</p>

  <p>"No one. They evolve." Nancy looked straight at her, bright-eyed, excited.
  "No one can receive, who has not. But unto him that hath&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have nothing. Nothing." Elsa shuddered. "Nancy, I feel cowardly. Inside
  me, I'm afraid. But I don't know what of."</p>

  <p>"Only your nothingness is afraid. You are your soul. Be real! You are not
  this trembler at the door of experience."</p>

  <p>"Nancy, I will go where you lead. But is it right, what we're doing?
  Please don't get us into any Tantric magic, such as Bulah Singh spoke
  of."</p>

  <p>"Try not to think about Bulah Singh."</p>

  <p>"I can't help it. I know he isn't here, but I keep seeing him. Once he
  spoke of black magic. This place seems&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sh-s-sh! Look straight at him. Order him away! He will go."</p>

  <p>Elsa summoned to her aid the so often defeated will that only now and then
  beat back clairvoyance. She stood off the mental image of Bulah Singh. It was
  like facing a dog's eyes in the dark.</p>

  <p>"You were right. He has gone. I don't see him now. His eyes were staring
  at me."</p>

  <p>"We have nothing to do with black magic."</p>

  <p>"You promise?"</p>

  <p>"Child, if I should knowingly mislead you, it would be worse than death
  for me. Worse for me than for you."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what is going to happen beyond that door."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what will happen."</p>

  <p>"Then why go through with it? Why not go back to the guest room?"</p>

  <p>"Sh-s-sh! Try reciting the Twenty-third Psalm."</p>

  <p>"Very well. If it pleases you."</p>

  <p>"Let us say it together.'The Lord is my&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door opened quietly. Two monks came through like dark-robed spirits
  from a tomb. They stood aside, with their backs to the wall. There was a
  smell of incense.</p>

  <p>"No questions now," said Nancy. She seemed to choke with emotion. "Keep on
  repeating the Twenty-third Psalm and the Lord's Prayer. Say them alternately,
  over and over. Try to be conscious of each word as you say it to
  yourself."</p>

  <p>She took Elsa's hand and stood waiting for one of the monks to signal to
  them to pass through the door. Elsa felt like a frightened child, but she
  controlled herself, and she knew by the feel of her hand in Nancy's that she
  was no longer trembling. The monk beckoned. The old Mahratta chauffeur strode
  immediately forward, like a soldier stepping from the ranks at the word of
  command. His not to reason why. His to do, and take the consequences. He
  asserted, square-shouldered, his beloved mad employer's license to do as she
  pleased. He marched down the short hewn-walled passage, through the door at
  the far end, and stood lantern in hand, with his back to the Lama Gombaria,
  until Nancy and Elsa had seated themselves. Mats had been piled for them, a
  dozen deep, on the floor in the far corner. The Mahratta blew out his lantern
  to save Nancy's oil, and sat down near them, cross-legged, on one of his own
  shawls, staring at Gombaria with stony disapproval.</p>

  <p>Gombaria was seated on a hewn stone dais, between two looming statues of
  Bodhisattvas. Those, and a bell and an incense burner, were the only
  decorations of the chamber. It was hewn from the solid rock&mdash;about
  twenty feet by twenty, with a high, arched ceiling. There was a swimming,
  underwater sensation, due to incense smoke and the irregular adze-marks on
  the walls that cast interlacing shadows from the dim light of butter-fed
  lamps. On the step of Gombaria's dais, at either side of him, his two
  subordinates stood in attitudes of saintly meditation. They looked incurious,
  unconscious of the world; but several times Elsa detected them studying Nancy
  and herself beneath half lowered eyelids. She was beginning to wonder why she
  had felt frightened.</p>

  <p>The doorkeeper monks entered, closed a thick door behind them, and stood
  motionless. Elsa left off reciting the Lord's Prayer. It was distracting to
  keep her mind on it and she wasn't afraid any longer. She was fascinated by
  Gombaria, wondering what he was thinking about. Deliberately, without any
  success whatever, she tried to get a clairvoyant glimpse of the old Lama's
  thought. She couldn't see even its color. She might as well have tried to
  guess what a statue was thinking about. She heard Nancy murmuring:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Thy kingdom come.<br>
  Thy will be done on earth,<br>
  As it is in heaven."</p>

  <p>So she resumed murmuring the Lord's Prayer, moving her lips to satisfy
  Nancy that she was obeying orders. Hardly conscious of the words, she caught
  herself, nevertheless, wondering what good they did. Suppose one did believe
  in an All-seeing Father&mdash;what of it? Sparrows fall&mdash;two for a
  farthing&mdash;and Father knows. What of it? Bombs fall, too. And babies die,
  and&mdash;</p>

  <p>Something was happening. She couldn't guess what. It was happening. It was
  mental. It was like the spell that falls on an expectant crowd. A sensation
  of awe. She glanced at the old Mahratta chauffeur. He was breathing through
  his nose&mdash;shawled&mdash;rigid&mdash;angry&mdash; contemptuous.</p>

  <p>Gombaria didn't move. Not even his eyelids moved. His protruding underlip
  was so massively motionless that it lent an appearance of molded bronze to
  all the rest of him. For five minutes there was no sound except the
  Mahratta's breathing and Nancy's almost inaudible murmur: "'Yea, though I
  walk through the valley of the shadow of death&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>Then astonishing sound: "Aum-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m!"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Aum, Om</i> (Sanskrit)&mdash;a most sacred syllable
  used in Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and Jainism. In Buddhism, it is more
  usually transliterated as "Om". For more information, see the
  <i>Wikipedia</i> article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aum">Aum</a>.
  ]</p>

  <p>It began like the far-away note of a gong, approaching slowly, gradually
  swelling until it boomed like a chord of organ music. It was Gombaria's
  voice. He hadn't moved. Even his lips hadn't moved. But it was his voice. His
  subordinates joined in. Then the doorkeeper monks. Then Nancy, low alto. So
  Elsa added her own contralto, that some envious forgotten nobody had called a
  freak voice. After that she had never trained it but had made it a scapegoat
  for the worse freak, clairvoyance, that she could not get rid of. She could
  refuse to sing, and she did. Not even Tom Grayne knew what pitch and tone and
  volume she could produce from her small person. But now, for no reason that
  she was aware of except that it thrilled her, she gave her rolling contralto
  full rein.</p>

  <p>"Aum-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m!"</p>

  <p>Because she joined in last, she lingered last, alone, on the sacred
  syllable that, if one knows its secret, links the brain-mind with the soul
  and lets in floodlight from the higher consciousness. She did not know the
  secret. But she thrilled, watching Gombaria, hardly aware that her own voice
  was the last on the lingering note. Then Gombaria's eyes did move. They met
  hers. In the dim light, from across the room, they looked brilliant black.
  She couldn't guess what he was thinking. Gombaria moved his right hand and
  rang one clear mellow note with the small bell. Instantly, silently, the two
  subordinates thumbed the wicks of the four lamps. There was total darkness.
  Elsa felt Nancy's hand groping for hers. The old Mahratta chauffeur breathed
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>Nancy's strong, rough hand felt reassuring, like a branch to clung to in a
  steep place. But Elsa wasn't afraid; she felt excited&mdash;tensely curious.
  She had an unaccountable sensation that instead of Nancy and the old Mahratta
  chauffeur, Andrew Gunning and Tom Grayne were beside her. Nancy's hand was
  Andrew's. She knew it wasn't, but it felt like it. Tom Grayne was enormously
  angry, though she knew that was the Mahratta. For two or three minutes there
  was no audible sound but the Mahratta's breathing, until Gombaria repeated
  the chant and they all joined in:</p>

  <p>"Aum-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m!"</p>

  <p>As the note died away there began to be dim gray light in mid-room. It was
  formless, cheerless. It resembled wan moonlight. But it began to be shot
  through with rays of brilliance, like aurora borealis or the glimmer of the
  morning on distant peaks&mdash;as mysterious and beautiful and as unrelated
  to any visible source. The light faded, died away and was gone.</p>

  <p>Nancy murmured: "He needs help. Oh, if we were less dense&mdash;less
  turgid!"</p>

  <p>"Sh-s-sh!" said Elsa. She couldn't imagine why. She just said it.
  Gombaria's voice, subdued, hummed alone on the sacred syllable, but he
  stopped suddenly. The wan gray light returned. Then all at once the universal
  spectrum seemed to pour its colors like a waterfall into a pool of white. It
  was a blinding bewildering, soundless spasm&mdash;gray all around it
  &mdash;murky, miserable, wan and hungry gray&mdash;but in the center pure
  color in motion that made the senses reel. There was no reflection on the
  walls. The room remained pitch dark. When Elsa shut her eyes, she still saw
  the light. Whichever way she turned her head, she saw the center of it
  &mdash;increasing&mdash;fading&mdash;increasing again, as if a will behind it
  forced it against waves of an unseen ocean. Suddenly it merged its colors
  into one&mdash;flame color&mdash;then God's blood ruby. It turned golden,
  like the sun on water&mdash;and vanished. Where it had been, stood the
  Ringding Gelong Lama Lobsang Pun&mdash;Old Ugly-face. Living, moving,
  breathing.</p>

  <p>It was black dark. He was as clearly visible as if he stood in sunlight,
  nearer than mid-room. No light exuded from him. But he was visible. He looked
  natural, in three dimensions, exactly as Elsa had last seen him&mdash; hooded
  and cloaked in the ritual robes of his high order&mdash;bulky
  &mdash;ungainly&mdash;almost monstrous&mdash;peering with his owl's eyes
  through a mass of wrinkles&mdash;homely and human as Falstaff&mdash;holy, and
  as full of irony, and dignity, and inner laughter as if Michelangelo had hewn
  him out of granite to be breathed on by the breath of Life. He moved. His
  weird owl's-beak nose twitched. He was talking, making no sound. Elsa knew he
  and Nancy were talking&mdash;knew it, but heard nothing. He changed. He
  became the younger Lobsang Pun of the smashed photograph. Inaudibly but as
  overwhelmingly as if the senses heard it, his familiar, jovial belly laugh
  exploded in Olympian amusement.</p>

  <p>So far, to the last, least gesture Elsa recognized him. He was looking at
  Nancy. That made it all the easier to watch the penetrating attack of his
  eyes and their equally sudden receptive gleam of understanding&mdash;the
  occasional pout of his lower lip&mdash;the habitual, hardly perceptible, slow
  contraction of his neck, as if he foresaw, and neither feared nor underrated
  but was ready to meet violence with energy that he held in leash. Old
  Ugly-face in every incongruous detail, even to the rakish tilt of his
  cone-shaped hat.</p>

  <p>But&mdash;as thought lets go its gloom and spirals upward to the surge of
  music or a remembered poem, until inspiration reaches unknown views that make
  the heart leap&mdash;gradually now he changed into an unknown Lobsang Pun.
  Nancy's hand on Elsa's gripped with the strength of a vise, and then ceased
  to be felt. Through the old Lama's ugliness and robed obesity there shone
  forth a god, young with eternal youth, as splendid as the calm of everlasting
  morning, smiling with enjoyment of the fire-born glory of evolving worlds.
  How did one know what he smiled at? Elsa did know. She remembered the Bible
  story of the Transfiguration&mdash;lost it in views like blind
  Milton's&mdash;glimpsed Andrew&mdash;heard him chanting, as she had heard him
  scores of times:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds:<br>
  At which the universal host up sent<br>
  A shout that tore hell's concave, and beyond<br>
  Frightened the reign of Chaos and old Night."</p>

  <p>Consciousness surged with wordless experience that knew no form but
  beauty. Utterly beyond the shapes of things, and uncommunicable in the terms
  of time, passion rioted, exulted, gloried in motion that moved of itself,
  creating realms on realms of spiritual harvest ripening in selfless love,
  that gave and took not. An eternal moment. Being wholly released from having.
  Consciously exhaustless power to create new newness, now and forever.</p>

  <p>Elsa made no attempt to measure how long the experience lasted. Time was
  no dimension of it: minutes, hours, ages were incomparable nothing. Words
  brought her back to self-consciousness and the feel of the pressure of
  Nancy's hand on numbed fingers.</p>

  <p class="poem">"'Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the
  world.'"</p>

  <p>She didn't know whether Lobsang Pun or Nancy said it. It was a voice.
  Perhaps her own voice. She didn't know whether she heard it with her ears or
  with that inner hearing that offended people so that she had almost deafened
  it by self-inflicted torture of mind and nerves.</p>

  <p>It was a voice, no matter whose. She had heard and she had seen Reality.
  She had seen pure spirit. It had almost shattered her human consciousness. A
  bursting shell, lightning, death itself could demolish no more totally the
  deaf-blind unrealities that she had feared, and felt, and cherished.</p>

  <p>"Now I know."</p>

  <p>Was that her own voice, or some other? "But who am I?"</p>

  <p>Nancy let go of her hand. She was alone in the dark. Herself, alone, with
  Lobsang Pun. The Old Ugly-face whom she knew&mdash;clothed now in ragged
  black, stern, shrunken, apparently suffering&mdash;was studying her, looking
  straight at her. He was seated, cross-legged, it seemed in the snow. He
  appeared to recognize her&mdash;to see through her, to the secret thoughts
  that fled and tried to hide in the dark womb where she had loved her child
  toward a destiny that ended almost unbegun. She cowered, flinched, shrunk
  away&mdash;then turned against herself and bared her heart, her very soul,
  her whole consciousness, to the stare of the terrible eyes. And the eyes
  changed. Knowledge entered her. She knew, without questioning how she knew
  it, that Old Ugly-face, hundreds of miles away, had found, clairvoyantly, and
  with his spaceless, timeless consciousness had reached Nancy, his chela.
  Nancy had presented her for recognition. She was recognized. It was he, yet
  not he. With her eyes she could not have seen him. But she had seen
  him&mdash;not with her eyes&mdash;never again to forget or be forgotten. He
  was fading&mdash;already a measureless distance gone, withdrawn into a murky,
  dull gray hungry mist of paling light. Then darkness. Silence. And after a
  breathless, timeless interval Nancy's voice murmuring:</p>

  <p class="poem">"'Lord, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I love
  thee.'"</p>

  <p>There were sounds then in the darkness. Someone was moving. The door
  opened and closed quietly. Then Nancy's voice, hoarse, almost choking:</p>

  <p>"Light the lantern."</p>

  <p>The old Mahratta fumbled with matches and tugged at the squeaky mechanism
  of the lantern, lighted it, raised it and showed the room empty. He saw the
  gleam of tears on Nancy's face, got stiffly to his feet and came and stood in
  front of her, glaring angrily at Elsa as if she must have offended his
  beloved mistress. He clucked discourteous sympathy, reproach, and proverbs
  about women.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he demanded. "Why? Why? Isn't it good that nothing happened?"</p>

  <p>Nancy stared at him: "Did you see nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, there was nothing to see. These monks are an ignorant lot of
  humbugs. They know nothing. Look, they have fled. They played no tricks,
  because they knew I watched them. They fled from shame, lest we should ask
  them: why no magic? Hah! Magic! Dry those honorable eyes that weep because
  they saw no sin! Tschut-tschut! Sin is for men, not for women!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26">CHAPTER 26</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Andrew Gunning stood with his hands in raincoat pockets,
  wearing his shabby old felt hat, looking as little as he could like the
  leader of an expedition. Behind him, fifty yards away, was the Bhutia trading
  post, where Lan-dor-ling bought hides, sausage skins, wool and whatever else
  traders might bring from Tibet. It was too soon for the season's trading to
  begin. His barns yawned empty&mdash;a jumble of mud-and-freestone huts,
  patched with corrugated iron.</p>

  <p>Lan-dor-ling was reputedly one of the richest men in Sikkim. He was one
  part Chinese, one part Bhutia, two parts Tibetan&mdash;a slant-eyed,
  cunning-looking fellow with a broad, flat face, who always smiled and almost
  always understood what was said to him in English. But sometimes, if a mood
  was on him, he would refuse to speak English to strangers. In a buttoned cap
  and padded overcoat up to his ears he was watching Andrew, from a chair on
  the verandah that ran half the length of the front of the store. Its
  mud-and-stone windbreak at the north end shut off the best view of the
  mountains. It prevented the wind from dispersing an all-pervading smell of
  living pigs and dead hides. But it was a token, like a war debt payment,
  guardedly acknowledging the theory of civilization. A verandah.</p>

  <p>Around three sides of the group of buildings was a mud-and-stone walled
  enclosure for goats, sheep, pigs, chickens, and occasional ponies. There were
  sheds in the enclosure; their irregularly shingled roofs were held down with
  barbed wire and big flat stones. Three of Andrew's ponies, noticeably fat,
  were near one of the sheds; just inside it, sipping Tibetan tea, Bompo
  Tsering was watching to prevent them from rolling on their new saddles; but
  he also had an eye on Andrew; and between gulps of scalding tea he watched
  the lightning at play in a bank of cloud that rolled like a billion tons of
  blue-black coal dust down the invisible throat of a pass between two mountain
  tops.</p>

  <p>There were colossal mountains on three sides&mdash;north, northwest, and
  westward. There was no way out of that valley, that the eye could detect,
  except southeastward, where a rough road curved in a wide arc, away from the
  mountains. At a point just visible between gigantic boulders it met a better
  road that curved in search of the highway eastward toward Assam and Bhutan.
  Andrew was watching the fork where the roads met.</p>

  <p>He was in an agony of impatience, trusting no one, not even himself; going
  over and over in mind the details of his preparations for the dash for the
  Roof of the World, wondering whether he had forgotten anything that he could
  not afford to forget. One mile away as an eagle flies&mdash;but more than ten
  miles over almost trackless boulder-hatched ravine and mountain spur
  &mdash;his outfit waited, hidden in a hollow, near the foot of a pass so
  steep and dangerous that for almost a generation not even the suspicious
  Gurkhas had troubled to guard it. It crossed a corner of secret, almost
  unexplored Nepal, so it was doubly outlawed. Three governments in theory
  barred its use, forbade it, kept it off all but the secret maps; but in fact,
  it was the only pass that they did not watch and that afforded the slightest
  chance of undetected trespass into Tibet. According to Bompo Tsering's
  information, picked up from a smuggler, it was, some seasons, the first pass
  to be negotiable because rain and wind bullied the snow from its exposed
  ledges. Smuggled opium, stored day before yesterday in Lan-dor-ling's shed,
  had vanished&mdash;probably over the pass. That was the feather in the wind
  that Andrew counted on.</p>

  <p>Once away, there would be small risk of pursuit, or of being turned back
  at the farther end. The only dangers would be smuggler-bandits, avalanches,
  lack of fuel, and the hell's own causeway, where the loads would have to be
  manhandled, the ponies hauled and lifted, and a miscalculation would mean
  death on the crags below.</p>

  <p>"God, what's keeping her!"</p>

  <p>There was a post of Sikkim police less than a mile away. They had a
  telephone. They weren't very likely to do more than glance at a party of
  monks, northeastward bound in a contractor's bus toward a monastery near the
  Bhutan border. But if someone&mdash;Bulah Singh, for instance&mdash; should
  have phoned them to be on the lookout for Elsa, not all the ingenuity of
  Morgan Lewis would be enough to prevent a show-down. Governments can't look
  the other way when information comes through official channels and is on the
  record.</p>

  <p>"'He travels the fastest who travels alone.' A man's a damned fool to
  stand waiting for trouble!"</p>

  <p>But Andrew didn't dream of not waiting. He paced the track, counting his
  footsteps, turning suddenly for a glimpse of the crossroad beyond the
  boulders, glancing at the clouds, and at his watch. It was getting late. He
  would be lucky to reach the bivouac before dark. To attempt to reach it after
  sundown would be almost madness, even though he had left white phosphorus
  markers along the trail. He had posted that fool from Koko Nor to lend a hand
  at the bridgeless torrent, where the ponies would have to be manhandled in,
  held against the ice-cold water, and hauled out on the far side. But one
  couldn't count on the man from Koko Nor. He might have run back to the
  bivouac, afraid of being haunted by the devil that escaped when his tooth was
  pulled.&mdash;Took some pulling, that tooth.</p>

  <p>All right, give Elsa one more hour as deadline. Any later, and they would
  have to spend the night at Lan-dor-ling's. Not so good. Andrew didn't quite
  trust Lan-dor-ling. He had had to pretend to, but it was risky. Lan-dor-ling
  was almost certainly a secret spy for the Government&mdash;perhaps for all
  three Governments&mdash;Sikkim, Nepal, Tibet&mdash;as well as for people to
  whom governments are like wealthy women, created to be sponged from, betrayed
  and laughed at. Lan-dor-ling was too rich to stay bought with a secondhand
  car: much too avaricious to have refused the gift. On the other hand, asking
  no embarrassing questions, he had smiled with urbane incredulity at Andrew's
  hand-out lies, told for Lan-dor-ling's use in case strangers should be
  inquisitive.</p>

  <p>He suspected Lan-dor-ling of being one of Bulah Singh's secret
  correspondents. There was no evidence of it, beyond a yellowing, creased
  letter signed by the Sikh, appointing Lan-dor-ling to the honorary post of
  investigator of local applicants for jobs in Darjeeling. It was framed on the
  wall of the filthy room where Lan-dor-ling's half-breed clerk kept the
  accounts. There was absolutely no doubt whatever in Andrew's mind that Bulah
  Singh had a well-planned grapevine of intelligence that he could use for or
  against the Government, whichever might suit his own ambition. Lan-dor-ling
  was a probable branch of the vine.</p>

  <p>True, Bulah Singh had insisted that the way into Tibet was open. So had
  Morgan Lewis. Both men, each for a different reason, wanted him safely across
  the border. Possibly&mdash;hardly probably&mdash;no man could be quite such a
  fool&mdash;Bulah Singh believed Andrew would obey orders, once in Tibet.</p>

  <p>"He can't be such a damned idiot. He can't be! All the same, he may be
  kidding himself. He thinks he has the goods on me. Perhaps he thinks Elsa is
  within his reach in Darjeeling. Good God, she may be, at that! He may have
  held her up! Jesus! And if he knows she's on her way&mdash;and if she is
  &mdash;and if he's half awake, he must know&mdash;he could have her tracked
  down and arrested on suspicion of intending to cross the border. Fool! Why
  didn't I take chances and bring her with me?"</p>

  <p>But the worst danger of all was Morgan Lewis.</p>

  <p>"He's a good guy. But he's a nut. He plays it like a dime detective. It's
  a dog-gone cinch he'll bungle the show-down with Bulah Singh. He'll be too
  tricky about it. Bulah Singh will turn on him and blow the gaff. He'll accuse
  Lewis of secretly helping me to reach Tibet, contrary to law and orders,
  international treaties and God knows what else. Spite is Bulah Singh's pet
  motive. He knows he stands to get broke if he's found out. He'll make it cost
  'em something. He'll blow things wide open. He'll involve as many higher-ups
  as possible in his own ruin&mdash;probably all set to do it, in case they
  spike him.&mdash;God, what's keeping that woman! Why doesn't she come!"</p>

  <p>Thunder, like a barrage by the clock&mdash;drum-fire&mdash;all heavy guns.
  Lightning in blinding spasms. Rain in a seething deluge. Hail. The rocks
  crackled like glass under machine-gun fire. Andrew ran for Lan-dor-ling's
  verandah. By the time he reached it Lan-dor-ling had vanished. Andrew sat in
  the vacated chair watching the forked lightning that rent the storm and made
  the glimpsed mountains seem to dance to the deafening thunder. He didn't hear
  hoofbeats&mdash;couldn't. The first he knew of a horse was its rider, spurred
  and swinging a riding crop, striding along the verandah, dragging the door
  open against the wind and letting it slam behind him. Andrew followed. He
  couldn't afford not to. Almost any news was likely to be bad news. Better to
  know it at once than to waste time guessing.</p>

  <p>Lan-dor-ling was lighting a kerosene lamp in the low-roofed shop where
  last year's odds and ends of trading goods were hung, shelved, heaped in
  indescribable confusion; he set the lamp on a table and went out by a back
  door. There were no chairs. The man in spurs and a drenched poncho sat on a
  heap of gunny sacks, in a pool of his own making. He missed a rat with his
  riding whip, laughed and said something to Andrew. It was impossible to hear
  for the din of the hail on the low roof. Andrew went nearer.</p>

  <p>"I said: I turned over my horse to your man in the yard."</p>

  <p>He had removed his rain-soaked hat. He was gray-haired, as handsome as
  President Harding, but weather-beaten and with no trace of softness&mdash; no
  laziness&mdash;only a vaguely luxurious ease, like a healthy animal's, as he
  relaxed his muscles. His hands were a workman's&mdash;scrubbed. A hard, horsy
  smile. Blue-gray eyes. At first, second and third glance, an intelligent,
  obstinate, difficult man with a grim sense of humor. But for his hands he
  would have looked like high finance on vacation. But his hands could do
  things.</p>

  <p>"Surgeon?" Andrew asked him.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Presbyterian Mission. Fifteen miles from here. Riding my rounds. I
  am John Bobbs. "</p>

  <p>"Sir John Bobbs? Baronet?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You may omit the title."</p>

  <p>"Heard of you."</p>

  <p>"Are you Andrew Gunning?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. "</p>

  <p>"Heard of you, too. Try that other pile of sacks."</p>

  <p>Andrew sat facing him, back to the door.</p>

  <p>"We have a mutual acquaintance," said Sir John Bobbs. "Dr. Lambert,
  Cincinnati, Ohio."</p>

  <p>Andrew froze. Sir John Bobbs appeared not to notice it. "Lambert, and I,"
  he remarked, "were together at Johns Hopkins. We correspond&mdash;exchange
  notes on pathology&mdash;homicide&mdash;suicide&mdash;lots of other matters
  of professional interest. It's a small world. Do you know anyone in
  Delhi?"</p>

  <p>"I have never visited Delhi."</p>

  <p>"But you know Darjeeling?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. just come from there."</p>

  <p>"Pleasant drive?"</p>

  <p>"More than enough rain. No accidents."</p>

  <p>Sir John Bobbs examined Andrew from head to foot&mdash;battered felt hat,
  raincoat, thin brown shoes and cotton socks, in which no man with any
  experience would dream of facing the trail to Tibet.</p>

  <p>"When you return to Darjeeling," he said, "would you do me a favor? I have
  a message that I don't care to send through the post."</p>

  <p>Andrew thumbed tobacco into his pipe. He felt for matches. Dread was
  raising goose flesh up and down his spine, but he tried to look calm while he
  thought like lightning. Sir John Bobbs might be one of Lewis's secret allies.
  But he also might not be. He mustn't mention Lewis. He knew Sir John Bobbs,
  by reputation, as a holy terror to transgressors of the law. Not a medical
  baronet, but a baronet who had specialized in surgery. He represented
  civilized and scientific Christianity&mdash;the spirit of the Ten
  Commandments, slightly edited in favor of His Majesty the King&mdash;iodine
  &mdash;soap and water. He was not a magistrate. But, as a missionary with a
  tremendous reputation for surgical skill, good sportsmanship and piety, he
  enjoyed the much more powerful role of confidential adviser, off the record,
  to the men who appoint and demote magistrates. It was hard to tell what to
  say to him&mdash;what line to take. It was certainly no coincidence that had
  brought him, in a storm, at the zero hour, to drop hints about Lambert of
  Cincinnati, Ohio. Lambert might have told professional secrets. Do doctors do
  that kind of thing? Would Lambert do it?</p>

  <p>"Have you no one else who could take the message?" Andrew suggested.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. I could entrust it to the police. They're not far away. They
  would attend to it."</p>

  <p>A hint? A threat? Or merely an answer to the question? Andrew felt tempted
  to tell him to go ahead and use the police. But he reminded himself: silence
  is the best bet when you don't know what you're up against. Sir John Bobbs's
  eyes betrayed a hint of cruelty, or something like it. He appeared to be
  enjoying Andrew's dilemma. Andrew kept on trying to dope him out, guessing,
  rejecting guesses, trying to remember every rumor he had heard about him. But
  he had to say something. Better a half-truth than a lie. Waiting for a friend
  should be truth enough for&mdash;</p>

  <p>"To tell the truth," he began&mdash;</p>

  <p>Sir John Bobbs whacked at his riding boot. "Truth," he remarked, "is
  sometimes easier to hide than to discover. Someone told me those are your
  ponies in the compound. Your man denied it, and I see you're not dressed for
  a ride. I noticed your car in the godown. The obvious inference is that you
  are about to return south. Don't deny it. I hate to be treated as if I had no
  intelligence."</p>

  <p>"Your reputation is too well known for me to make that break," said
  Andrew.</p>

  <p>"You will take my message?"</p>

  <p>"I'm a stranger to you. Aren't you taking chances?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Sir John Bobbs eyed him with a glint of humor and a hard smile.
  "You might betray my confidence. I will risk that. The message refers to a
  phone call I received this morning. The address is on the inner envelope. You
  may use your own discretion about opening the outer one; it is merely to keep
  the inner envelope clean."</p>

  <p>Andrew accepted the long envelope and stowed it in his overcoat pocket.
  Lan-dor-ling shuffled into the room and blew out the lantern. The storm was
  dying. It had grown lighter. The thunder was rolling away in the distance.
  Sir John Bobbs stood up and shook himself:</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I feel fortunate to have met you. It was a lucky coincidence I
  must hurry away now. I wish you luck on your journey&mdash;ah&mdash;
  southward." He turned to Lan-dor-ling: "You needn't trouble about finding a
  messenger. I have one. Mr. Gunning will take my letter to Darjeeling.</p>

  <p>Lan-dor-ling stared, smiling, looking stupid.</p>

  <p>"Any time limit on opening the outer envelope?" Andrew asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh no. Whenever you please. Good-bye, and good luck to you. Will tell the
  police that I understand you are leaving southward tomorrow morning."</p>

  <p>Sir John Bobbs stalked out, making his spurs jingle on the rough pine
  floor, whacking the whip on his riding boot.</p>

  <p>"Too much that man many often not minding own business," said Lan-dor-
  ling. "Sending too much many people into plison too many times."</p>

  <p>Andrew drew the envelope out of his pocket&mdash;waited&mdash;until
  through the small window he saw Sir John Bobbs ride away, cantering, on a
  mud-splashed horse.</p>

  <p>"His now going police kana, making trouble for you," said
  Lan-dor-ling.</p>

  <p>Andrew tore open the envelope. The smaller one inside it was addressed in
  pencil:</p>

  <p>Phone from Darjeeling for Andrew Gunning.</p>

  <p>He tore open the inner envelope. It contained a half sheet of plain paper,
  bearing no date or address. The scrawled, penciled message seemed to have
  been written left-handed to conceal the writer's identity:</p>

  <p>B.S. disappeared but believed to have phoned Sikkim police to arrest Mrs.
  G. near border. Have requested medical acquaintance to report your intended
  movements and to remove one passenger from bus on suspicion of contagious
  illness. He having no commission, break unauthorized quarantine and get
  going. Destroy this.</p>

  <p>His hunch had been right. Lewis had bungled the breaking of Bulah Singh.
  The Sikh had vanished. Laid his plans weeks ago&mdash;not a doubt of it.</p>

  <p>Andrew struck a match, burned the message and powdered the ashes with his
  heel.</p>

  <p>"What that? What your burning?" Lan-dor-ling asked.</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned: "I burned a prayer to heaven for the gods to remember me
  by."</p>

  <p>"My playing your player being too good, two being better than one,"
  remarked Lan-dor-ling.</p>

  <p>Andrew went out by the back way and found Bompo Tsering. "Take two ponies
  to the crossroad. When you see a bus stop at the police kana, go and offer
  your services to the doctor sahib. Do what he tells you."</p>

  <p>"That man being Mission dokitar is asking too much many question."</p>

  <p>"Do as you're told, and hold your tongue. There'll be saddlebags. Bring
  'em. And mount her on your pony, remember."</p>

  <p>"Oh."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Get going."</p>

  <p>"Hot damn!"</p>

  <p>"Hurry!"</p>

  <p>Andrew went back and shook hands with Lan-dor-ling. "Good-bye, old-timer,
  and thanks for your trouble. I'm on my way now&mdash;to Darjeeling."</p>

  <p>"Your being too much God-damn good liar, my believing you. So goo' luck
  &mdash;goo'-bye, Gunnigun!"</p>

  <p>The rain was almost over. Andrew led his pony down the track, hobbled it
  with the reins and climbed the biggest of the two huge boulders. Even so he
  couldn't see the police kana. He sat there a long time, fidgeting and
  glancing at his watch. The sun was almost out of sight beyond the mountains
  of Nepal when at last he saw Elsa riding Bompo Tsering's pony up the trail.
  The Tibetan, with her loaded saddlebags, rode behind her. She was wearing a
  khaki shirt, shorts, and raincoat&mdash;looked like a boy in a broad-brimmed
  felt hat&mdash;bare knees&mdash;woolen stockings&mdash; sneakers.</p>

  <p>Andrew glanced at his watch, slid down off the boulder, unhobbled his pony
  and waited. She almost rode by without seeing him. Then she drew rein,
  laughing:</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I'm accused of bubonic plague!"</p>

  <p>With his back to his pony Andrew studied her a moment: "Something's
  happened to you."</p>

  <p>"Happened? It's like a movie! I came in a bus with fifteen monks from
  Gombaria's monastery. We were stopped by the police at the crossroad just
  below here. They demanded my name, and I thought it was all up. But I hadn't
  time even to pretend I didn't understand, before a big man in a poncho on a
  roan horse cantered up and demanded to feel my pulse."</p>

  <p>"Sir John Bobbs," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you know him? Well, he told the police I must be quarantined, in one
  of Lan-dor-ling's sheds, on suspicion of plague. Then Bompo Tsering showed
  up. Sir John Bobbs ordered him to take me and my luggage up the road."</p>

  <p>"How did you shake the police?"</p>

  <p>"There were only three policemen. Sir John Bobbs made them stay there and
  stand guard while he lined up all the monks, to take their temperatures
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let's go. This way."</p>

  <p>Andrew mounted his pony and led, between high rocks, along a track that
  was the bed of a rock-strewn watercourse. It was a-roar with storm water, but
  presently it left the stream bed, widened, and there was room for them knee
  to knee.</p>

  <p>"What else happened?" Andrew asked.</p>

  <p>"Since you left Darjeeling? Thousands of things. I don't know where to
  begin."</p>

  <p>"Something happened to you. What was it?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I can't tell you."</p>

  <p>"Secret?"</p>

  <p>"From you? No. But I don't know how to tell you. Andrew&mdash;honestly
  &mdash;I can't. I don't know how."</p>

  <p>"Nancy Strong stuff?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. "</p>

  <p>"I guessed it. Well, we'll blow that out of you. Draw rein a minute. Do
  you see that sharp crag with the lammergeier's nest near the top? Tonight's
  bivouac is just beyond it. You'll be wet to your skin before we get there,
  but no matter, there'll be a fire to dry at perhaps the last fire but one for
  a week. Now look upward."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, this isn't the way we came from Tibet, is it?"</p>

  <p>"No. Look upward, where I'm pointing. Do you see the last rays of the
  setting sun, on the snow to the left of that big fellow that seems to stick
  clear through the sky? That's the pass. Seventeen thousand three hundred and
  eleven feet. That's the way we're going."</p>

  <p>"Andrew!"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Turn your head a moment. Look straight at me."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I'm glad it will be difficult. I'm not the least bit afraid."</p>

  <p>"Sure, I know you're game. You don't have to persuade me of that"</p>

  <p>"You are talking about someone I once was, Andrew. You don't know me. I'm
  not the same person. But I'm thanking the same Andrew for the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He laughed. "You haven't changed much. Let's get going!"</p>

  <p>So the journey began, in silence, in single file, toward the Roof of the
  World, where Tom Grayne, in a cavern&mdash;seven hundred miles away as wild
  swans fly it&mdash;expected news and supplies&mdash;but not his young wife.
  The mountains grew dark in the sunset. The ponies neighed at the scent of
  snow on the wind from their sky-high home.</p>

  <h2><a name="part2"
     id="part2">PART TWO</a></h2>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27">CHAPTER 27</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Clouds rolled up from the Tibetan valley. They smothered
  mountains that have no names, that are only numbers on the bewildering
  map.</p>

  <p>"Typical Tibetan spring," said Andrew. He sat down opposite Elsa, on a
  rock in the lee of a ledge that broke the wind. He had a can of salmon in his
  hand; he was almost too tired to open it. Four of the afternoon. Ten below
  zero. Five days out from the Sikkim frontier. Ponies all in. But the summit
  was far aloft and behind. There remained only about three thousand slippery
  feet to descend into the valley. Even then, they would be twelve thousand
  feet above sea level; but there would be only two days of hard marching to
  reach food for the ponies, that were now munching their last ration but
  one.</p>

  <p>"We're in Tibet!" said Elsa. "We've made it! Better than Hannibal! He lost
  elephants crossing the Alps. We haven't lost a pony, nor even a load!"</p>

  <p>Andrew opened the salmon and passed it to her.</p>

  <p>"There'll be bad going tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Then he hove himself to his feet like a prize fighter coming out of his
  corner for the last round. He went for another look at the ponies, to make
  sure the Tibetans weren't stealing the grain: even Bompo Tsering couldn't be
  trusted not to do that, not though the men had double rations of barley
  bread, sugar and fat bacon.</p>

  <p>Elsa made the bivouac comfortable&mdash;blankets in the lee of the rock,
  on a waterproof sheet, in a sort of cave made by the piled loads. One candle
  in a windproof lantern. One can of Sterno, in a folding stove that Andrew had
  invented and got made in Darjeeling. Two narrow air mattresses. Pillows. A
  couple of books.</p>

  <p>Andrew returned along the ledge with some Tibetans to help stretch a tent
  over the loads, weighting it down with rocks. All the comforts of home.
  Nothing to do but crawl in and wait for tomorrow. But he went back along the
  ledge once more to make sure that the Tibetans had enough Sterno to stew
  their eternal tea. Elsa, in a streaming cloud, near the edge of an invisible
  cliff between earth and sky, with singing ears and thumping heart, set down
  the salmon and waited, thinking. Thoughts weren't the same as at sea level,
  nor even as at Darjeeling. Since Gombaria's monastery they weren't anything
  like the same. She tried to find a name for the difference. She couldn't. No
  word was good enough.</p>

  <p>The first night out there had been plenty of fuel and a real meal, in a
  gully beside a roaring waterfall, with two pup tents, privacy and the
  excitement of a possible pursuit. After that, when the awful ascent began,
  physical peril had banished all but the essentials, as it always does.
  Convention went downwind, along with the echoes of falling rocks. Past
  personal history became a distant dream. The only poignant memory was of a
  dog, at home in England. Was he being cared for? To save time and the labor
  of repacking at daybreak, she and Andrew had shared even the same blankets,
  for the sake of the doubled warmth. They had said nothing about it, they had
  simply done it, too exhausted when night came to crave anything but sleep.
  Too breathless, at those sky-high altitudes, to talk. Too tired to dream.</p>

  <p>All the same, sleeping with him was an experience. Perhaps it was
  something to be proud of, meaning that Andrew took her self-respect and
  common sense for granted. He had done the natural, sensible thing, as he
  always did. Nevertheless, she had not snuggled in beside him without
  wondering what he was thinking about, and how would he behave toward a woman
  he loved. No woman could suspect him of being a passionless man. What sort
  would she be, whom Andrew would some day love? Elsa had no feeling of
  friendship toward that supposititious female&mdash;so little that she
  actually laughed at herself. Jealous?</p>

  <p>She wouldn't have dared to mention the subject of sex, even now, at a
  lower altitude, where conversation was possible and nerves were less jumpy.
  Andrew was under a terrific strain, so concentrated on the almost superhuman
  task that an ill-chosen phrase might bring down on her, like an avalanche,
  one of his storms of temper. Those were rare, but terrible. She had witnessed
  one, months ago, loosed on a grafting Tibetan official, who ran for his life.
  And she had experienced one, loosed on herself. It had come, like the
  Himalayan wind, from beneath the cloud that always screened Andrew's inner
  thought so that she couldn't read it. She couldn't even remember what she had
  said that angered him; it was a chance remark, without special motive,
  something about Tom Grayne, not meant unkindly; but it had touched off
  Andrew's rage against mental cruelty and mean insinuation. He appeared to
  think physical cruelty&mdash;even its worst forms&mdash;much less damnable
  than mental injustice. It had been hours later before he seasoned a manly
  apology with the remark that it was only from his friends that he expected
  fairness.</p>

  <p>"I don't give a whoop in hell what the rest of 'em think. That's their
  business. But friends should think well of each other. Say what you like to a
  friend. But don't speak ill of him behind his back. That's treachery."</p>

  <p>So she had known, all these months, that she rated as friend. Very often
  she hadn't believed; but she had known. Secretly, in her heart of hearts, she
  had never really even believed, as she had so often said, that Andrew
  detested her. No human being could do that, and be as kind as he was. If he
  had been her lover he couldn't have been more considerate. He had never once,
  by so much as a hint, suggested she was the nuisance that she knew she must
  be. He had never neglected the fundamental decencies, courtesies, dignities
  due from one to another. He had made her feel like a comrade-in-arms, who
  shared life's battle. Who could ask more of a man?</p>

  <p>He had probably, she thought, missed his vocation. He should have been a
  soldier. Soldiers need nobility as much as courage. Only noblemen should
  lead. Birth has nothing to do with nobility. Was Andrew a reincarnated
  spiritual aristocrat? That was a strange thought. Some ancient Stoic campaign
  veteran, reborn to test his spirit on the anvil of events. How else, or where
  had Andrew learned the self-reliance that had forced that march across a
  sky-high pass too steep and dangerous for even Tibetans to use unless as
  fugitives from law? Not one mistake, in a five-day fight against snow, ice,
  altitude and wind&mdash;up a blind trail. It stunned memory. One could only
  recall fragments of it, disconnected, as from a nightmare.</p>

  <p>They had fought their way through snowdrifts, roped their way along storm-
  swept ledges, off-loaded and lifted the ponies from crag to crag where the
  ice-ground granite was as smoothly slippery as glass. But no man nor beast
  had missed a full meal. None had done less than his share of the work. No one
  was injured. There was not even a lame pony. And as the generous rations were
  consumed, the loads had been redistributed, pound for pound, so that the
  nearer they came to the Tibetan end of the pass, and the more exhausted the
  ponies became, the less the burden each had to struggle with. And not one
  sore back.</p>

  <p>It was all Andrew's doing. Tibetans, who treat wild life as sacred, are
  incredibly cruel to beasts of burden. They had resented that their riding
  ponies should be put to pack work along with the others. Even Bompo Tsering
  had had to be fisted, more than once, from the back of a pony already
  burdened with all it could carry. Elsa herself had had to climb, where she
  might have ridden the one unloaded pony, lest the Tibetans should take
  example, and ride too, when Andrew's back was turned. Bompo Tsering, usually
  bringing up the rear, had tried to steal rides on her pony. But that would
  have ruined discipline. Several times she knew she had dared death,
  forbidding him. It would have been easy to push her off a ledge and claim the
  wind had done it. She had detected the thought. But when she threatened him
  with Andrew, he stuck his tongue out humbly, and then grinned and they were
  friends again. There was something in Andrew that commanded allegiance, but
  she couldn't name it. It answered to none of the names by which men label
  those whom they follow.</p>

  <p>It wasn't impersonal. It wasn't the ugly, indifferent, cynical spell such
  as the exploiters cast on their followers, or impose by force. It wasn't
  egotistical. He did no spellbinding at all. His speech was curt,
  unsentimental, slow, and usually quiet. It was nothing spectacular, that gift
  of leadership. But it created good will. Perhaps it wasn't a gift. Perhaps it
  was a studied, deliberate, iron-willed concentration of purpose, that
  included the utmost use of every faculty he had. That might be it. He
  flinched at nothing, spared himself nothing, and yet gave the impression of
  inexhaustible reserves of physical and mental strength. In blizzards,
  blinding clouds and raging winds, at exhausting heights, on deadly
  precipices, Elsa herself had felt the same&mdash;not impersonal&mdash; first
  person singular&mdash;Andrew&mdash;force, that appealed to the Tibetans'
  courage and rallied them over the summit.</p>

  <p>What was Andrew? What kind of man? What was his secret? She had known him
  now, more than a year, more intimately than some women know their lovers. Yet
  she didn't know him. She didn't understand him. She didn't even know what had
  possessed him to abandon a career for such unprofitable, Herculean labor.</p>

  <p>He wasn't a fanatic. He seemed less bigoted than most people. He wasn't
  morose. In his own quiet way he was full of humor. He almost never sneered.
  He laughed with, not at people. But there was something deep beneath his
  surface that defied search. It was always there, silent, veiled. Elsa was
  always conscious of it. She felt she had a right to be curious. Curiosity was
  even stronger than hunger, cold, exhaustion&mdash;almost stronger than
  intuition that warned her not to trespass.</p>

  <p>There came a flattering thought that even Andrew might be helpless to
  conceal his inner consciousness, if subtly tempted. There must be a breaking-
  down point, where he would need help to retain his self-control. Help from
  the temptress. The secretly humiliating female thought, that Andrew hadn't
  found her worth an effort to seduce, suggested means of making him less
  reserved. That kind of struggle with Andrew was one that she knew she had
  more than a forlorn hope of winning. But the fact that the thought excited
  her, set her wondering about herself. How did she feel toward Andrew? Did she
  love him? How can one love without understanding? Admire, respect, like
  &mdash;yes, but those are cold emotions. Love?</p>

  <p>She was thinking about that, and about Tom Grayne hundreds of miles away,
  getting a glimpse of a clairvoyant vision of Tom in his cavern at
  Shig-po-ling, when Andrew came and crawled into the shelter. There was just
  room to sit upright.</p>

  <p>"Tea," he said, "before the storm comes. There's a pippin coming. This
  world's a madhouse."</p>

  <p>"Can I help? Has something gone wrong?"</p>

  <p>"No. I dumped some stuff we'll never need and repacked a load. That's a
  few pounds off all the ponies. Every little counts. Our Tibetans have got the
  wind up. They let me work all alone in the dark. If they dared, they'd run.
  Listen."</p>

  <p>Downwind came the scream of a big bird, then another.</p>

  <p>"Lammergeiers," said Andrew. "Nesting. Their aerie's on the crag right
  above us. The fool birds are cussing us out."</p>

  <p>"They can't hurt, can they? Will they attack the ponies?"</p>

  <p>"God, no. But our Tibetans think they're summoning devils to give us the
  works."</p>

  <p>"They think we're trespassing on sacred ground?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Some saint died up here. If I should shoot the lammergeiers, they'd
  call that murder. But they'd murder you and me and call it blessed-happy-
  release-of-spirit-into-higher-consciousness."</p>

  <p>Elsa laughed.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you eat?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I waited for you&mdash;felt sociable."</p>

  <p>He opened salmon for himself. They ate out of the cans, with spoons,
  munching dry barley bread to help it down. Then prunes, stewed tea, canned
  milk, chocolate. Not another word until Andrew tossed the empty cans over the
  precipice and crawled out once more into the wind for a look at the men. The
  lammergeiers screamed like furies. Elsa used the last of the warm tea to wash
  her fingers that were chapped by the cold and cut, through thick gloves, by
  the rocks she had climbed.</p>

  <p>Andrew came crawling in again: "Hell's devils! There's no sense in a
  scared Tibetan. I'll stay awake, or they may try to murder us both, to pacify
  the spirits. Move the candle over here. I'll read a while."</p>

  <p>"Do you particularly want to read?"</p>

  <p>"I'm in a mood for Milton. I want to read about hell."</p>

  <p>"Can't it wait?"</p>

  <p>Andrew quoted:</p>

  <p class="poem">"What in me is dark<br>
  Illumine, what is low raise and support,<br>
  That to the height of this great argument<br>
  I may assert eternal Providence,<br>
  And justify the ways of God to man!</p>

  <p>"God's ways need justifying on a night like this," he added. "I dare bet
  you it's raining at sea; bone-dry and dusty in Oklahoma; lousy, where the
  climate's bearable; and not a scrap of fuel where it's coldest. It's a mad
  world."</p>

  <p>"It's a wonderful world," she answered.</p>

  <p>"I'm in no mood to be Pollyannaed."</p>

  <p>"You're overtired, Andrew. You've done three times as much as anyone else.
  Go to sleep. I'll stay awake. If anything happens I'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no. You sleep. Long, hard day tomorrow. Downhill's worse than uphill
  &mdash;more likely to fall, unless your nerve's in shape. Curl up and
  sleep."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't."</p>

  <p>"Why not? What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sleepy. I want to talk."</p>

  <p>"What about?"</p>

  <p>"Anything."</p>

  <p>"Okay. Tell what happened that night at Gombaria's, when you and
  Nancy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, Andrew. I can't tell."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because it can't be told."</p>

  <p>"You're pretty good at telling most things, when you want to. All right,
  it's your secret. Sorry I asked."</p>

  <p>Elsa thought a moment, with her chin on her knees. "Andrew."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Could you tell anyone, for instance, what it feels like to be up here in
  these mountains?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I tell it?"</p>

  <p>"Can you even tell yourself what it feels like, as compared to cities and
  sea level? It's an experience, but you can't describe it, can you?"</p>

  <p>"Short of oxygen," he answered. "Slows you. Makes your head hum. Felt like
  being seasick at the summit. That's another of God's funny paradoxes&mdash;
  where you most need oxygen, the less there is."</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you're in that mood&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mood? I could play the harmonica, just to annoy myself."</p>

  <p>"Don't, please. Andrew, I am not trying to keep a secret&mdash;not from
  you, of all people. I did tell you about seeing Lobsang Pun. It was after
  that, that's so difficult. I was alone in that room with Nancy."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, you said that, the first night out."</p>

  <p>"I'm simply bursting to tell. I want to share it with you. But one can't
  explain what happened."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"There aren't any words to tell it with. It was something beyond music
  &mdash;even beyond thought. One can't even recall it. One only knows it did
  happen&mdash;and was so wonderful that&mdash;oh, if I could share it with
  you! But how can I?"</p>

  <p>"Old Gombaria has a reputation," said Andrew. "He's a first-class psychic
  showman."</p>

  <p>"Gombaria didn't do this. It wasn't showmanship. He wasn't even
  there."</p>

  <p>"He fixed me so that I got your Mauser message, and he wasn't there when I
  got that, either."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, that message was just ordinary clairvoyance. But what happened
  after Nancy and I saw Lobsang Pun was utterly beyond clairvoyance. It was
  more different from it than these mountains are from London slums."</p>

  <p>"It seems to have changed you over. You don't seem scared of your
  clairvoyance any longer."</p>

  <p>"I never will be again. Never."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's something. That's a load off."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, did you ever know something&mdash;I mean really know&mdash; and
  feel you'll almost die if you don't tell, because it's so utterly wonderful
  that your heart almost bursts with it&mdash;and yet you couldn't
  tell&mdash;couldn't?"</p>

  <p>"Can't you give me a hint?"</p>

  <p>Elsa thought a moment. Then, suddenly: "Andrew, I want you to believe what
  I'm saying. I'm serious."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"If by jumping off this precipice I could give you the experience that I
  had at Gombaria's, I would jump without hesitating. I want to give, and go on
  giving forever!"</p>

  <p>"Steady!" he said. "Steady! The altitude's got you. It's like ether or
  being drunk. Lie down. Shut your eyes. Swallow hard. Turn in. Sleep it
  off."</p>

  <p>"There you are. You misunderstood. Words&mdash;oh, what use are they?"</p>

  <p>Andrew remembered Lewis's advice. He dismissed his own raw nervousness. He
  grinned. "It's about a thousand-foot jump&mdash;maybe more. I'll have to
  climb down to bury you under a cairn. Maybe I need the exercise. When do you
  take off?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, please don't blaspheme!"</p>

  <p>"I sure will, if you try any circus stunts. I've heard of levitation and
  flying lamas. But I'm agin' 'em."</p>

  <p>"I didn't say I will jump off. I wouldn't dream of it. I was trying to
  hint at the hugeness of the urge to tell you, if I could, how wonderful life
  is."</p>

  <p>"Hello! Hello! Is this the same young woman who was calling herself a
  calamity, back there in Darjeeling?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. No! Yes and no! What I meant was&mdash;there couldn't be too high a
  price to pay&mdash;if it were possible&mdash;for the joy of giving someone
  else the experience that was mine, at Gombaria's, after Nancy and I saw
  Lobsang Pun."</p>

  <p>"You say Gombaria didn't provide it?"</p>

  <p>"No. No, indeed. Nancy explained that. Old Gombaria is a kind of dweller
  on a threshold. He likes to open psychic doors for other people, but he never
  goes in himself. He never talks about it. He knows all about psychic centers,
  whatever that means."</p>

  <p>"It might mean anything," said Andrew. "Psychics spend most of their time
  thinking up different meanings for words that had just one plain meaning to
  the Greeks who invented 'em. Forget the Greek words. Try to tell what
  happened."</p>

  <p>Elsa sighed and summoned patience. But instead of it came the storm, in a
  sudden blast as if the mountains were at war. Hail smote the shelter,
  seethed, crashed along the ledge. Deafening thunder. Lightning. Wind howled
  and shrieked like ice-cold devils. Andrew wrapped the blankets around both of
  them, hugging her close to him, sharing the warmth of his strong body. They
  sat side by side, not sure whether they or the mountain trembled. Elsa had an
  almost unbelievable sensation that Andrew was more afraid than she was.
  Perhaps his was the dread that the last day's march would end in disaster.
  Her only dread was that she might fail in emergency. Was this an emergency?
  Did he need reassurance? How could she give it? They couldn't hear each other
  speak.</p>

  <p>But the shelter held. The hail died. Andrew went out again, facing the
  wind, to make sure that the ponies were snug in the lee of the ledge. He
  found them all lying down, too weary to be terrified. The Tibetan watchman
  lay snoring, too tired to fear even devils. Bompo Tsering, tented in the lee
  of an overhanging ledge, was preaching gloomy Tantrist doctrine to eleven
  other numbed, awed Tibetans. Their breath steamed; their eyes glowed ghostly
  in the rays of Andrew's flashlight. He stayed and talked with them, asking
  questions. Little by little he eased their superstitious fear, by getting
  them to tell him about monstrous semihuman entities that guard forbidden
  heights and whelm the trespasser. They unloaded their fear on himself,
  teaching him mysteries. Teachers don't kill attentive pupils, even to oblige
  the devils of a pass into forbidden Tibet. That danger died of its own
  propaganda, strangled in terrible words.</p>

  <p>Elsa sat watching her breath freeze on the heavy blanket, wondering what
  she should say to Andrew. It was like nostalgia&mdash;saddening almost to
  tears, but she scorned tears as self-indulgence&mdash;to know what she knew,
  and to be unable to tell. No one had forbidden her from trying to tell,
  although Nancy had warned. She could almost hear Nancy's experienced,
  humorous voice:</p>

  <p>"Tell and be damned! 'See that thou tell no man' was wise advice. You will
  use words. They will be turned against you. It will hurt. Words mean 'thus
  far we come, and this we know.' Words are the nails that crucify. It was the
  literal, accurate word-definers who condemned Jesus out of his own mouth.
  When your soul&mdash;the real soul&mdash;conscious you&mdash;can speak
  straight to the soul of another, then you can awaken the other to experience
  reality. Life has to be lived. It can't be told."</p>

  <p>She had a clear clairvoyant glimpse of Nancy, talking to children around
  her fireside, telling the children truth that grown-ups labor all their days
  to misinterpret. She kept her promise to send Nancy an "all's well." She saw
  Nancy again&mdash;and Old Ugly-face&mdash;and, strangely, Father Patrick of
  the Jesuit Mission. What could that mean? Why the Jesuit?</p>

  <p>Then came Andrew, with his thought full of Bompo Tsering's devils:
  humorless, monstrous, conscious forces, said to be sometimes visible, whose
  passion is envy, their motive hate, and their goal the undoing of all things
  done.</p>

  <p>"There'll be glare ice on the lower ledges," he remarked, as he crawled
  in. "The snow thawed this afternoon. This'll freeze it smooth. We'll have one
  hell of a day's march. Do you know an antidote for devils?"</p>

  <p>"Are the Tibetans badly scared? Andrew, are they&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Damn their religion! Damn everyone's religion. The hell with it. It only
  rots guts."</p>

  <p>"Andrew! It isn't long since you reproached me for saying there isn't a
  God! I've changed my mind. Have you changed yours?"</p>

  <p>"God won't get us down tomorrow's glare ice. Gravity'll do it. That's
  another of God's funny inventions&mdash;too much gravity in the wrong place.
  Well, we'll beat it somehow."</p>

  <p>"Andrew."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Are you still curious?"</p>

  <p>"What about?"</p>

  <p>"About what happened at Gombaria's."</p>

  <p>"Sure. Eaten up with curiosity."</p>

  <p>"If I try to tell, will you try to understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yep. Use plain words."</p>

  <p>"Think some poetry."</p>

  <p>"I'm off that stuff, for the moment. Too much grue* in the air. They kind
  o' don't mix."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>grue</i> (Scots)&mdash;shudder. <i><a href=
  "http://www.infoplease.com/ipd/A0465035.html">Random House Unabridged
  Dictionary</a></i>. Used here as a noun meaning "horror" or "noisomeness."
  Annotator. ]</p>

  <p>"Try the first poem that comes to mind. No matter what it is. Try it."</p>

  <p>Andrew thought a moment. Grim humor seized him. He began, sonorously,
  chanting verse so inappropriate that even Milton's music hardly veiled the
  sarcastic motive:</p>

  <p class="poem">"With thee conversing I forget all time,<br>
  All seasons, and their change&mdash;all please alike.<br>
  Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,<br>
  With charm of earliest birds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He laughed. "There'll be a dark daybreak. Screaming lammergeiers. Twenty
  or thirty below zero. Three thousand feet of glare ice. One day's rations for
  the ponies. Yep. Every prospect pleases."</p>

  <p>"Try again," said Elsa. "Try something different. Please, Andrew. Won't
  you help? I would almost rather die than not tell you. But if you won't get
  into the right mood, I can't even reach your everyday intelligence. And I
  must aim much higher than that."</p>

  <p>He reached for the candle lantern, held it so that he could see her face,
  studied her eyes a moment, then set it back in the niche in the rock.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he said. "I didn't get you at first. All right, poetry it is.
  Here goes."</p>

  <p>He plunged into a mood, as she had seen him plunge, numbers of times, into
  raging cold water and swim for the fun of it. His right fist seemed to strike
  an invisible gong, commanding silence. Then he chanted:</p>

  <p class="poem">"In this broad earth of ours,<br>
  Amid the measureless grossness and the slag,<br>
  Enclosed and safe within its central heart,<br>
  Nestles the seed perfection&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He chanted on, Elsa listening, watching him silhouetted in dim candlelight
  against the piled-up pony loads&mdash;unshaven, free-shouldered, wearing a
  brown blanket like a toga. He went lost in the poem. Words ceased. Thought
  went wandering along the overtones toward the universal wonderland whence
  poems come.</p>

  <p>"Andrew."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Were you ever in love?"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"If you were, it would help."</p>

  <p>"I was. Once. For a short time."</p>

  <p>"Do you remember the ecstasy part?"</p>

  <p>He didn't answer.</p>

  <p>"Did it lead up the same ray of consciousness that creeps upon you when
  you chant poetry?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe. I haven't thought of it."</p>

  <p>"And you can't speak of it. Can you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't wish to speak of it."</p>

  <p>"At Gombaria's, after I saw Lobsang Pun&mdash;for a long time&mdash;I
  don't know how long&mdash;I was actually soul-conscious. I was me. Not this
  thing. Me. My soul. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"No. Darned if I do."</p>

  <p>"I was, what I shall be. What we're all evolving into. What we all really
  are. There were no limits. Beauty&mdash;joy&mdash;oh, I can't tell it!
  &mdash;Soul! Make me tell it! Speak!&mdash;Andrew, won't you try? There are
  thousands of ways."</p>

  <p>"Tell one way."</p>

  <p>"I think one follows poetry, or music, or being in love&mdash;all the way
  inward and up to the heart of the universe&mdash;God's heart."</p>

  <p>"Leaving the world to go to hell?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, no! One loves the world! It's good! It's full of pain and
  sorrow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You bet it is."</p>

  <p>"But one sees it all differently. We are all one vast oneness, working
  toward&mdash;" She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Annihilation?" he suggested. "Do we lose our identity?"</p>

  <p>"Never! Awareness of that is what we lack now! Soul is identity! Andrew,
  does the word 'love' set your teeth on edge?"</p>

  <p>"They're on edge already from the wind. An extra twinge won't hurt
  'em."</p>

  <p>"Does passion offend you?"</p>

  <p>"Whose?"</p>

  <p>"I don't mean sentimental emotion. Andrew, reality&mdash;real being
  &mdash;is an ecstasy of passionate love. That's all I can tell you. It is so
  far beyond human love and passion that they're darkness in comparison. But
  they're parts of it. Follow your high thought to wherever it leads. You will
  find your soul. Say to yourself 'I am my soul!' Your soul will show you what
  you are!"</p>

  <p>"It might show me something I'd rather not know," he retorted. He
  remembered what Lewis had said. "How about sleep?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Have I scandalized you?"</p>

  <p>"Hell, no. I'm damned interested. But we've a stiff march tomorrow. Get
  some sleep."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would sleep, and let me stay awake."</p>

  <p>"No. No more talk now. Turn in."</p>

  <p>"Why must you stay awake? Are you afraid the Tibetans might&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hell, no. They'll make no trouble."</p>

  <p>"Then what are you watching for? Andrew, you're worried! What is it?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not worried. Be a good girl now and turn in."</p>

  <p>"Why are you thinking about Bulah Singh?"</p>

  <p>"Read my thought, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You thought a blood-red picture of him, right then."</p>

  <p>"Will you go to sleep if I tell you?"</p>

  <p>"Try me."</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh may have been arrested. But I guess not. I think Lewis
  jiggled the bait too long, and missed him. If so, Bulah Singh's one chance
  would be to chase us."</p>

  <p>"But he couldn't do anything, could he?"</p>

  <p>"He could hang on. He could count on my not making a habit of shooting
  people."</p>

  <p>"But could he possibly overtake us?"</p>

  <p>"If he's traveling light. We broke a trail for him through all the drifts.
  There was a light near the summit, just after sunset. It may have been Bulah
  Singh's lantern."</p>

  <p>"But the summit's half a day's march behind! Would he dare to come on in
  the dark?"</p>

  <p>"No such luck. That 'ud be the end of him. He's too wise to take that
  risk."</p>

  <p>"Then why stay awake, Andrew?"</p>

  <p>"I want to figure him out. You go to sleep and leave me think about
  him.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28">CHAPTER 28</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The next day was too dreadful to remember, afterwards,
  except as flash- backs from a dream, remote in time and space. Fog-veiled
  precipices&mdash; eagles, looming and gone&mdash;glimpses of sky amid clouds
  that wallowed, wave on wave, bursting on mountain peaks, until the world
  seemed upside down. Ice-slithering ponies, roped, off-loaded,
  lowered&mdash;loads skidded downward&mdash;hairbreadth, unbalanced teetering
  on windy ledges above echoes that boomed in a rolling mist. Standing out in
  memory like a bell buoy at sea, was a prayer rag on a human thigh bone,
  protected from storms by a crude shrine to which each passing Tibetan added a
  stone. Right there the Tibetans mutinied. They declared it was track's
  end&mdash;luck's end. The mountain had been changed into a cloud by magic.
  Devils. They would turn back. The muffled thunder of an ice-imprisoned
  waterfall, heard through a hurrying maelstrom of gray mist, was the voice of
  doom.</p>

  <p>"No, Gunnigun. No."</p>

  <p>Elsa, too, had premonitions. She said so: she was thinking of Bulah Singh,
  although she didn't name him. Andrew made no comment. He roped himself and
  made the end of the rope fast to an upstanding spur of rock. He scouted
  forward alone, vanishing like a ghost along a foot-wide track that crossed a
  crumbling rock-strewn slope. To his left, nothing. To his right, a looming,
  unclimbable glacis. He found the path was practicable. Only a rope's length
  of it, leading to wide, level rock on the far side. Returning, he kicked
  loose stones off the narrow track and listened&mdash;heard them, after a long
  pause, crash amid cannonading echoes. No foothold to the left or right. No
  margin for error. But the stones hadn't started an avalanche. The loose
  rocks, on the glacis above, were apparently frozen in place. One pony at a
  time, one man at a time, might make it without vibrating loose the invisible
  menace.</p>

  <p>When he came back he gave his orders quietly, and repeated the command to
  Bompo Tsering. Then he said six words to Elsa, and himself led the pony that
  carried the Tibetans' blankets, the precious tea urn and personal odds and
  ends: a better argument than millions of words. Elsa, obeying the curt
  command, followed, with her heart in her throat, handing the rope to prevent
  it from catching under the pony's load, and to prevent the pony from treading
  on it when it slackened for a moment. They reached the far side safely.
  Andrew was starting back, to bring the next pony across, when disaster
  emerged. It came through the fog like the coming of world's end.</p>

  <p>Urged by some Tibetan blend of loyalty, obliquity and disobedience; and by
  the siren tea urn and the life-preserving blankets all gone in the fog;
  perhaps, too, by shame that he had condoned mutiny, Bompo Tsering went from
  one mistake to another. He denied it afterwards. He swore a panic took hold
  of the men and he couldn't prevent. But all the other Tibetans agreed it had
  been he who gave the order to untie the end of the rope and get going across.
  It was almost a stampede. They flowed through the fog. They were like
  scurrying ghosts. Andrew had to turn about and run back to the far end.
  Prodded by the frightened Tibetans, the ponies trotted. Down came the
  avalanche&mdash;random&mdash;sporadic, at first. By the grace of the
  Unpredictable the rope, with one end made fast to Andrew's shoulders, fell
  clear of the ponies' feet and down over the precipice. By the time he had
  hauled it in, most of the ponies and all the Tibetans, except the man from
  Koko Nor, were safely across, untouched by stones that slid down from the
  glacis as from a devil's ambush&mdash;faster, faster&mdash;hundreds of rocks,
  each loosening another, to miss their marks and plunge into echoing mist.</p>

  <p>The man from Koko Nor rode last, on a loaded pony. There being no one to
  forbid, he had vaulted up over the staggering pony's rump. He was halfway
  across before he was visible through the haze, perched on the load like a
  lunatic, waving his arms to balance himself against the wind and the pony's
  movement. Perhaps he was praying&mdash;making yokel-magic to appease mountain
  devils. The last of the avalanche&mdash;one lone clattering rock, struck the
  pony's hind legs out from under him. Pony and rider disappeared into the
  fog&mdash;like phantoms. If there was sound, none heard it: horror blotted it
  out. Then, breathless moments later, a cry came up out of the mist. Not a
  man's cry. It was the heart-breaking scream of a pony. An eagle &mdash;so
  near that Elsa felt the wind of its wings&mdash;swooped downward. The pony
  screamed again. The Tibetans laughed. Andrew cursed them into silence. Then
  he lay prone on the rock, peering downward, waiting for wind to tear a hole
  in the driving whiteness. After about two minutes he got up and spoke to
  Elsa:</p>

  <p>"The pony's alive. Perhaps the man is. They're on a ledge about fifty feet
  below us."</p>

  <p>He pulled out his Mauser pistol and examined it. Elsa said nothing.</p>

  <p>She thought he intended to try to shoot the injured pony from where he
  stood. But he returned the pistol to the holster under his armpit, beneath
  his sheepskin jacket. Then he carefully passed the rope around a smooth rock,
  tested it, examined the noose around his shoulders, and gave Elsa the loose
  end.</p>

  <p>"Hold that."</p>

  <p>She didn't dare to speak to him; she might have said the wrong thing.</p>

  <p>He and his anger were one. Anger was the very blood in his veins&mdash;
  the breath that misted from his nostrils. It made him white-lipped. He
  beckoned Bompo Tsering.</p>

  <p>"Give me your Mauser."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering hesitated, met Andrew's eyes and quickly plunged his hand
  into his coat. He surrendered his precious pistol, butt first.</p>

  <p>"Four men!"</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering beckoned four men. They came slowly, unconfident, wondering,
  watching the pistol. They followed Andrew's glance and laid hold of the
  rope.</p>

  <p>"I'm going down there." He glanced at Elsa, jerked his head toward her.
  "Do as she tells you."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering protested: "Gunnigun! Hot damn! Your not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Speech died in time to check the swing of Andrew's fist. "Your saying,
  Gunnigun&mdash;my doing."</p>

  <p>Andrew cocked the surrendered Mauser and gave it to Elsa: "Shoot to kill,
  if they disobey you! Shoot him first. Then the others, one by one until they
  do obey."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Andrew."</p>

  <p>"You are not to look over the edge."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Andrew."</p>

  <p>"Stand back here. When I shout, repeat the order to Bompo Tsering."</p>

  <p>With another glance at the rope he was gone, letting himself down hand
  over hand, until she saw the rope chafe on the rock as he swung in the wind,
  and heard him shout: "Lower away!"</p>

  <p>She repeated the order, pointing the pistol at Bompo Tsering's head,
  setting her teeth. She would obey. She would kill if she must, and she
  wouldn't blame Andrew. It should be her own doing. One of the men spoke. He
  held the rope and leaned outward, staring downward. Presently she saw the
  rope slacken, heard the scream of the indignant eagle, followed by the crack
  of Andrew's pistol. He had shot the pony. She wondered what it would feel
  like, later, if she should have to shoot Bompo Tsering. Then an eternity of
  waiting, with her fingers freezing on the pistol butt and her imagination
  fighting against pictures of Andrew losing foothold, falling&mdash;falling
  &mdash;ten thousand times she saw him in imagination falling headlong, before
  she heard him shout:</p>

  <p>"Haul away!"</p>

  <p>The echoes repeated it. The Tibetans had to be cursed by Bompo Tsering
  until they feared his curses worse than the voice of the underworld, and set
  to work hauling, in silence except for their grunts and Bompo Tsering's
  low-voiced "Ho-ay-ho! Ho-ay-ho!" as he set the time. Elsa snagged the rope's
  end as fast as it came up, with her heart in her teeth, watching the rope
  chafe&mdash;watching for Andrew's head to appear.</p>

  <p>And when it came, it wasn't Andrew. It was the pony's load, harness and
  all. It caught, blown under the overhanging edge of the rock. The harder they
  pulled, the faster it stuck, until she gave an order to Bompo Tsering, backed
  up by a gesture with the pistol. He stuck his tongue out, grinned, noosed his
  belt around the rope, crawled down and hove the load up over the edge. He
  himself had to be hauled back, scared almost numb. He stood gasping beside
  the load, smiling at her along the Mauser barrel.</p>

  <p>"Hot damn," he said, gasping.</p>

  <p>"Lower the rope again!"</p>

  <p>He appeared not to have thought of it. She repeated the order. He relayed
  it. The others obeyed. They looked like fishermen paying a line in a fog at
  sea.</p>

  <p>"Did you see him?" Elsa demanded. "Where is he? What is he doing?"</p>

  <p>"My not know seeing nothing. Hot damn."</p>

  <p>"Can he catch the rope? How can he catch it? Won't it blow out of
  reach?"</p>

  <p>He grinned&mdash;shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Haul up! Haul it back here!"</p>

  <p>She made them bend on a coil of rawhide, to increase the weight and to
  give Andrew more chance to snatch it as it swayed in the wind. Nearly fifteen
  minutes after that, and not a sound from Andrew, until at last his shout came
  up echoing out of the mist:</p>

  <p>"All right! Haul away!"</p>

  <p>This time it was Andrew, spinning, clutching the rope with one hand,
  fighting with the other&mdash;using his pistol butt to beat off the eagle,
  not daring to shoot for fear of frightening the crew at the rope. Elsa shot
  the eagle&mdash;the first thing she had ever killed&mdash;almost the first
  time she had ever fired a pistol. The huge bird folded like a blown rag
  &mdash;vanished. Then, when they had hauled Andrew over the edge and he
  walked toward her, she was afraid&mdash;not of him&mdash;of his anger. He
  held out his hand for the pistol. She gave it to him. Andrew's scorn conceded
  nothing&mdash;not a gesture&mdash;not the flicker of a sneer as he gave the
  pistol back to Bompo Tsering. Then he spoke savagely, in a low voice,
  commanding him to distribute the recovered load among the ponies. He watched
  him obey, making almost imperceptible gestures to the other Tibetans that
  sent them hurrying to the headman's aid.</p>

  <p>It was several minutes before he faced Elsa again. They hadn't spoken. She
  hadn't dared to speak. He was gray, grim-lipped. Was he angry with her? Or
  was it not anger? He wasn't trembling. He was breathing a bit harder than
  usual. But he seemed to be fighting himself, not thinking of anyone else,
  except that he kept glancing to make sure the loads were being properly
  roped. When he did speak his voice was almost normal and he had lost some of
  the gray look:</p>

  <p>"Elsa, I want a sheet of that foolscap paper and a soft pencil from your
  saddlebag. Do you mind?"</p>

  <p>When she brought them, with a pad to write on, he asked her to sit down.
  He said his own hand was too unsteady. He began dictating as if she were an
  office stenographer:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">"Andrew Gunning to Bulah Singh.<br>
  <br>
  "Bad going here. Watch out for sliding rock. Cross carefully, one at a time.
  If you should overtake me, come day or night."</p>

  <p>"&mdash;That's all."</p>

  <p>He broke the pencil lead and split the wood with his teeth, making a cleft
  stick, into which he inserted the paper, folding it lengthwise, so that it
  looked almost like a toy airplane. Then he beckoned Bompo Tsering.</p>

  <p>"Go back there and tie this to the holy man's thigh bone in the
  cairn!"</p>

  <p>The headman stared: "Gunnigun, that being too much very holy thigh bone!
  Long time blessed holy hermit dying that place!"</p>

  <p>Andrew jerked his head in the direction of the foot-wide track. Not
  another word. It was Bompo Tsering's chance&mdash;to take or leave&mdash; to
  regain lost standing. He understood. It was trial by ordeal. He stuck out his
  tongue and obeyed. Elsa watched Andrew. Had he gone mad? Was he thinking of
  some kind of working agreement with Bulah Singh? It seemed incredible. But
  what else could the note mean? She couldn't read Andrew's thought; he had it
  veiled more obscurely than ever. She herself couldn't think. She was panicky.
  But he sat down beside her, and she knew then that he needed her. He wasn't
  asking for help. He expected it&mdash;knew it was there. He was beginning to
  recover from emotion so terrific that he hadn't dared to relax attention from
  what needed doing. He was taking for granted that she understood that. She
  mustn't dare to question him. Let him govern himself, in his own way. Let him
  feel he was understood.&mdash;She felt she was beginning to know Andrew at
  last.</p>

  <p>"The fool from Koko Nor was dead. Poor devil. On his way home. But so was
  the pony on his way home."</p>

  <p>"We heard you shoot the pony."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Beat the eagle to it. I gave the pony a swig of water from my flask.
  That kills the fear for a second. So they die relieved."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Andrew."</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"On behalf of the pony. It can't say thank you."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't have to. Good pony&mdash;did his best, always."</p>

  <p>She thought of Tom Grayne, suddenly, without meaning to, comparing him
  with Andrew. Tom wasn't sensitive, or romantic. What could she say to Andrew
  that wouldn't jar the sensitive unknown part of him that never quite came to
  the surface? At that moment it wasn't far from the surface. She had glimpsed
  it&mdash;almost seen it.</p>

  <p>"Andrew."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"I think I know why you don't like gratitude. Deeds produce their own
  reward, in this life or the next. Isn't that it?"</p>

  <p>He scowled&mdash;turned his head&mdash;stared at her&mdash;spoke
  quietly:</p>

  <p>"No. That's lousy stuff."</p>

  <p>"Lousy?" she asked. "Didn't you once tell me you believe in
  reincarnation?"</p>

  <p>"Believe nothing. I know it."</p>

  <p>"Well then, won't the law of karma* reward&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>karma</i> (Sanskrit "deed", meaning action, effect,
  destiny)&mdash;the sum of all that an individual has done, is currently doing
  and will do. The effects of all deeds actively create present and future
  experiences, thus making one responsible for one's own life, and the pain in
  others. Excerpted from <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma"><i>Wikipedia</i></a>, q.v. ]</p>

  <p>He interrupted, low-voiced: "No. The hell with reward&mdash;here or
  hereafter! That's a rat's motive. The rule is: you are what you do. So if you
  can, you've got to, or you lose your own self-respect."</p>

  <p>He looked away again, listening for Bompo Tsering along the fog-veiled
  track.</p>

  <p>Elsa hesitated. Suddenly she decided she had a right to know. "Andrew, why
  did you write to Bulah Singh?"</p>

  <p>"Because I have to live with my own conscience. Neglect to warn him 'ud be
  murder. He might have followed that fool from Koko Nor. Warning puts it up to
  him. I've done my bit."</p>

  <p>"But why invite him, day or night! You don't trust him, do you?"</p>

  <p>"No. That's why."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand."</p>

  <p>"An enemy is less dangerous where you can watch him."</p>

  <p>"But we might have escaped him."</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;and might not. As it is, he'll do some hefty guessing, and
  he'll guess me wrong, I bet you!"</p>

  <p>Through the fog came Bompo Tsering balancing his way back cautiously along
  the foot-wide track, spreading his arms as if he walked a tight rope,
  treading gingerly not to disturb the devils that loosen rocks. He marked time
  for a moment, for the pleasure of treading freely at last on firm rock. Then
  he came and stood in front of Andrew. Sweat had made streams in the dirt on
  his face.</p>

  <p>"Your saying, Gunnigun. My having doing. God-damn! Peling paper having
  writing being too much easy now can being seen. So coming other people
  &mdash;not good."</p>

  <p>"March! Get going! You lead for a while."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering lingered: "Gunnigun."</p>

  <p>"Yes? What?"</p>

  <p>"Man from Koko Nor, his being dead now&mdash;having what&mdash;in bokkus?"
  By way of illustration Bompo Tsering thrust his hand into the voluminous
  swag-bag formed by the lining of his overcoat. "Money?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>Seven Tibetans came forward, as alert as vultures, thinking the same
  thought as the headman, grouping themselves behind him, watched by the other
  Tibetans, who had to stand by because Tibetan ponies will roll their loads
  off on the edge of anything&mdash;a precipice preferred. Andrew groped in his
  bulging hip pocket&mdash;pulled out a bag&mdash;undid the leather
  thong&mdash;drew out money&mdash;silver and Indian paper rupees. He didn't
  count it. He thrust it back into the bag and tied the thong. Bompo Tsering
  held out his hand and the other Tibetans grinned.</p>

  <p>"Out of the way!" Andrew said sharply. "Stand back."</p>

  <p>He tossed the bag over the cliff. There was no sound of its falling, but a
  long pause, then an awed chorus:</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun!"</p>

  <p>"March! Get going! Next time man or horse dies due to disobedience, I'll
  pitch a month's pay of each one of you over the first cliff we come to! On
  your way! Get going! March!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch29"
     id="ch29">CHAPTER 29</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It wasn't long before Andrew resumed his normal good temper.
  He bore no carry-over grudge against Bompo Tsering. So the Tibetans forgot
  his anger, and their own fear of him. They liked him again. That was part of
  the secret of Andrew's success with men of an alien race&mdash;of his
  success, too, with animals: he dealt with the passing moment frankly, fairly,
  as it came, and when it was gone it was finished business. But beneath the
  surface he was more obscure than ever. Something had hit him. He was less
  than ever disposed to reveal what he was really thinking about. He avoided
  Elsa&mdash;rode alone&mdash;seemed almost suspicious of her, choosing his
  rare words, certainly on guard. Against what? Did he regret the brief
  self-revelation? That quick glimpse of his soul, in a fog, on a raw mountain
  ledge? Did he fear she would take advantage of it? It seemed so. The thought
  humiliated Elsa; it made her lonely and dejected&mdash;made her wonder what
  the sensation would be when Tom Grayne should see her coming, from far off.
  But like Andrew, she kept thought to herself. On the surface she was valiant,
  waxing her lips against the bitter wind, so that she could smile without
  pain. She kept herself clean, bright, healthy.</p>

  <p>"Whom am I trying to please? Me? Two men? One man? Which of them?"</p>

  <p>They had to fight every inch of their way down the lower end of the pass.
  The going should have been comparatively easy, but an unexpected snowdrift
  blocked them for half a day. The snow was softening&mdash;wouldn't bear their
  weight. They tried to dig their way through it. Nightfall found them less
  than halfway through, but the snow freezing again. They were too exhausted
  and it was too dangerous to go ahead in the dark. They bivouacked in the long
  trench they had dug. Andrew ate what Elsa cooked, hardly speaking to her,
  then turned in and slept like a dead man. But he was up before daybreak,
  while the surface of the drift was still frozen hard. Before the Tibetans
  could cook their eternal tea, he was breaking trail. He almost outraced the
  morning thaw. Only the last three loaded ponies had to be dug through the end
  of the drift. But the delays had totaled up to a whole day lost. And now,
  starving ponies.</p>

  <p>The gallant animals struggled through thawing mud toward a distant
  village, while the mountains behind grew more and more incredible&mdash; like
  a nightmare&mdash;a fantastic wall ever in motion that surged like a tumbling
  sky, between them and India. Andrew rode in mid-column. Elsa came last. That
  way it was easier to prevent the Tibetans from over-driving and beating the
  ponies. Andrew had to take away Bompo Tsering's whip, to prevent him from
  flogging ponies that were bogged so deep they couldn't struggle.</p>

  <p>"Where's your head, you fool?"</p>

  <p>"Hot damn! My head thinking too much. Coming someone!"</p>

  <p>They all knew they were being followed. It was the worse of two dreads.
  The village they were approaching was bad enough. It looked more like a fort
  than a village, half hidden amid glacial moraine and tumbled waves of sterile
  yellow earth. It looked as sinister as its reputation: a mean, inhospitable
  nest of bandits, amid hungry foothills. No monastery. No sign of cultivation.
  Andrew had never been there; neither had Bompo Tsering. One of the Tibetans
  said he had been there, years ago, but nobody believed him, except when he
  said the place was ruled by a black magician. They all believed that. They
  were afraid to whisper the magician's name to one another, because devils
  might overhear, and he was said to control specially evil devils.</p>

  <p>But fear from behind is even worse than fear in front. They were running
  away from a dark unknown. Andrew didn't dare to tell them who was coming.
  Even though they guessed&mdash;though they almost knew&mdash;though Andrew
  did know&mdash;it was better to pretend ignorance. Mention of Bulah Singh's
  name might start another mutiny. Bulah Singh was a chief of police. Police
  and blackmail are the same thought in a Tibetan's mind. They were still too
  near the frontier to believe themselves out of reach of the Indian
  Government. No Tibetan would try to understand, let alone believe that India
  doesn't crave to conquer Tibet, or that there are limits to an Indian police
  officer's authority. They might abandon the ponies and run, or abandon the
  loads and run away with the ponies. Or they might stubbornly halt and
  fatalistically await the outcome. There was no predicting what they might or
  might not do, being Tibetans. It was all up to Andrew. One mistake&mdash;a
  hesitation&mdash;a suggestion that he didn't know what he was doing&mdash;
  even a hint of a change of plan&mdash;and the command would no longer be
  his.</p>

  <p>Elsa understood. She didn't bother him&mdash;asked no questions. Even when
  they halted in a hollow for the noon meal, she merely unpacked the food for
  herself and Andrew and made it ready on a small canvas sheet in the lee of a
  rock, wondering what she would say if he should invite her opinion. Should
  she advise him to wait and face Bulah Singh? That seemed the lesser of two
  evils. There were six or seven miles to go. The exhausting Tibetan wind that
  blows from noon, or earlier, until nightfall, had reached full strength; it
  was hard to advance against&mdash;wearying, boring, baffling. That would have
  made a good camping place. Normally they would have pitched camp. But no one
  was thinking of that now. The Tibetans were grudging a half-hour's rest for
  the starving ponies. They were fretting to press forward harder than ever,
  wondering whether Andrew could drive a bargain for them all at the village.
  They might be prisoners&mdash;slaves&mdash;plundered dead men before
  sunset.</p>

  <p>Andrew came and sat on the ground-sheet beside Elsa. He didn't look at
  her, but he spoke at once, ungrudgingly, as if he were paying a bill.</p>

  <p>"You're good. Thanks."</p>

  <p>It came from deep within him. Elsa knew that. She knew what he meant. It
  flowed into her consciousness like comforting physical warmth.</p>

  <p>But it suddenly occurred to Andrew that she might think he referred to the
  food. He wasn't praising her for doing her job right. Any woman could have
  done that. So he added:</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to talk."</p>

  <p>"I understood that, Andrew. You had too much to do."</p>

  <p>He frowned. He was going to have to explain after all. He hated that.</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to be Nancied," he said. "Get what I mean? I couldn't stick
  it&mdash;not now."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you needn't have feared that."</p>

  <p>"We're in a tight fix, Elsa. Got to keep my head. Soul talk 'ud get me
  rattled."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I am sorry I said as much as I did, two nights ago. I promise
  faithfully, I won't ever again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Easy, now, easy!" He was irritated because she went from one extreme to
  another. "Why can't women take a man's words at face value?"</p>

  <p>"I will never broach that subject again, Andrew, unless you ask me
  to."</p>

  <p>"That's different. I'll let you know when."</p>

  <p>"I tried to share with you a&mdash;a&mdash;something that I can't even
  explain to myself&mdash;not in words."</p>

  <p>"I know that. Pass it up until later. Listen to what we're up against
  now."</p>

  <p>"I know some of it."</p>

  <p>"I will tell it all&mdash;if you'll listen."</p>

  <p>She accepted the rebuke&mdash;sat still, careful to look unresentful in
  case he should give her one of his quick sculptor's-eye glances. There she
  made a mistake. He did look. He misinterpreted.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you bawl me out?" he demanded. "I know I've been&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted: "No, you haven't, Andrew. I understood perfectly. You
  couldn't help being&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean, couldn't help it? I did it on purpose."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I understood that."</p>

  <p>"When I'm up against real trouble, I hate Nancy-ism."</p>

  <p>"Don't let's talk about it."</p>

  <p>"I'm explaining. Morgan Lewis, last thing before I left Darjeeling, tried
  to get me to promise to let you fly off the handle whenever you please."</p>

  <p>"Yes. He told me he had said something like that."</p>

  <p>"The man's a nut."</p>

  <p>"But you can't persuade me he isn't a genuine friend."</p>

  <p>"He's a genius," said Andrew. "Welsh at that&mdash;half druid. All the
  rest of him is small boy. Darn him, he should have shut the trap on Bulah
  Singh. He could have. Now we're like an army on the lam. We might as well be
  brigands. Until early this morning I kidded myself that Lewis sprang the trap
  for Bulah Singh and missed him. But this morning I woke up. Doped it out.
  Lewis let him escape."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I could have told you that, if you had asked me."</p>

  <p>"You mean, Morgan Lewis told you what he'd do?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Nancy knows some of his secrets. Did she tell you?"</p>

  <p>"No. She didn't. I can't explain how I know it."</p>

  <p>"Clairvoyance," said Andrew, scowling, thrusting his jaw forward a shade
  of an inch. "Well&mdash;here's the common sense of it. Bulah Singh knew too
  much. Had the goods on too many hypocrites in high places. So Lewis chased
  him across the frontier."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Lewis hopes he'll be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, let me tell it. Bulah Singh had his plans all laid to
  scram for Tibet if the dice should turn against him. Lewis must have known
  that. Problem: let him go? catch him? or bump him off? The British do bump
  'em off secretly, once in a rare while, when there's someone they can trust
  to do the job smartly and hold his tongue. But they don't like it. It isn't
  in Lewis's line. Lewis likes subtlety&mdash;force Bulah Singh to beat it and
  brand himself as a self-convicted fugitive from justice&mdash;nowhere to go
  but Tibet, and take the consequences."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, may I say something?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But don't talk to me out of the sky."</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh intended, from the very first, to follow you and to make use
  of both of us!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, say, see here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I know. I'm not guessing."</p>

  <p>"Are you being clairvoyant?"</p>

  <p>"From the moment when he found out that you intended to return to Tibet,
  he resolved to follow you: and to compel me to come with him. I mean
  persuade. I don't think he'd have tried to use force."</p>

  <p>"You never mentioned it."</p>

  <p>"I know I didn't."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I don't like to be disbelieved by my friends. How could I have persuaded
  you to believe it?"</p>

  <p>"All right. That's the alibi. It gets you nowhere. Now answer the
  question."</p>

  <p>"If I do, you'll be angry."</p>

  <p>"If you want to make me angry, don't answer the question. Then I won't
  ever ask you another."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you can be more cruel than a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cruel nothing. Tell the plain truth. Why didn't you tell me what you say
  you knew about Bulah Singh?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, are you trying to make me hate you?"</p>

  <p>"I want the truth. Why didn't you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Very well. You shall have your answer. If I had told you what I knew
  about Bulah Singh you might have thought I was trying to work you."</p>

  <p>"Bull's-eye!" he answered. "Yes. I might have thought that. Now and then I
  am that kind of a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, you're not! Don't say it! I am sorry I spoke."</p>

  <p>For a minute he sat scowling with his chin on his fist. Then he suddenly
  threw off silence like a mask that irritated him:</p>

  <p>"I've been a son of a bitch. Sorry."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, if you want to be forgiven, I will even put it in writing!"</p>

  <p>He laughed. His frown vanished as if the wind had blown it. He plunged
  into the passing moment: "Here's part of our difficulty. I don't know this
  village we're headed for. Bulah Singh probably does."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I don't think Bulah Singh has ever been in Tibet."</p>

  <p>"Is that out of the sky?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, maybe you're right. But lots of Tibetans go to India. The magician
  who runs this village is a first-class stinker who has been to Darjeeling
  lots of times. So he may know Bulah Singh. His name is Lung-gom-pa."</p>

  <p>"That can't be his real name," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Lung-gom-pa isn't a name. It's a word."</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>"Flying lama. That's a person who can walk through the air."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I've heard of 'em."</p>

  <p>"No one who really can walk through the air would dream of using such a
  name as that. The real flying lamas are secretive. So Tom said. Tom knows; he
  has seen them."</p>

  <p>"Okay. Granted. This man who calls himself Lung-gom-pa is probably a fake
  of the first order. But he's a hot shot, and he runs this village. I heard
  all about him in Darjeeling&mdash;got the lowdown&mdash;figured how to manage
  him in case I'd have to take this route. He owns a gang of smugglers
  &mdash;bandits&mdash;professional thieves. I've got to make a deal with him
  before Bulah Singh gets at him."</p>

  <p>"How far is Bulah Singh behind us now?" Elsa asked.</p>

  <p>"Not many miles. We broke a trail for him. He could come at twice our
  speed. But he and his men and ponies must be darned near exhausted."</p>

  <p>"How many men has he, Andrew? Have you any idea?"</p>

  <p>"No. I've counted four men through the glasses, and I think eight ponies,
  one at a time as they crossed a bare ridge. But I may have counted one man
  twice. Or there may be a dozen I didn't see. I don't know. They'll be well
  armed; that's a safe bet. It's bad any way you look at it. If Bulah Singh
  takes our side against Lung-gom-pa and his brigands, we'll be beholden to
  Bulah Singh. I'd rather be beholden to the devil. And if he takes the other
  side, we're even worse out of luck. So we've got to use brains, and not let
  Nancy and Jesus do any backseat driving&mdash;not on this detour."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering peered around the rock. He beckoned. Andrew picked up the
  binoculars and hove himself off the ground, vigorously because he was tired
  out but unwilling to admit it.</p>

  <p>"We'll know the worst in a minute," he said over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Elsa followed him to the rim of the hollow, bending nearly double so as
  not to be seen. All the Tibetans followed. Bompo Tsering angrily drove them
  away, ordering them to stand by the ponies. Andrew lay down and stared
  through the glasses. Elsa watched Bompo Tsering. He was playing safe,
  pretending loyalty, ready to play friend or traitor with equal sincerity. He
  was more mercurial than really treacherous&mdash;quite easy to read.</p>

  <p>But there was no reading Andrew's thought no guessing what he saw through
  the glasses. What Elsa did get was a glimpse of her own confusion. It was
  like a dream. It frightened her. It was a secret fear. It coiled within the
  colored spectrum of her thought. Much worse than the fear of precipices.
  Nameless&mdash;nonphysical. She couldn't interpret it. But it seemed to
  include Andrew, as if she herself were evilly betraying him without knowing
  how or why. It sickened her. She couldn't speak when Andrew signed to her at
  last to come and lie beside him. He gave her the glasses, in silence. When he
  noticed her hand was trembling he thought she was cold. He signed to her to
  button her fleece-lined coat and to steady the glasses on the rock.</p>

  <p>They were wonderful glasses. But when she got them steady at last she
  didn't believe what she saw. It couldn't be true. One man alone, in a
  sheepskin hat and long overcoat, walked fifty feet ahead of an unloaded pony
  that followed, limping painfully. The man strode erect with a long stick in
  his right hand. Nothing cheap about him. Picturesque. Unpleasant. Stride and
  gesture were unmistakable.</p>

  <p>Andrew's voice was triumphant: "What do you see?"</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh. But he's alone!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Lost his party."</p>

  <p>"But perhaps they are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lost 'em. Gone. Baggage and all."</p>

  <p>"What makes you sure of it? Take the glasses again. Look."</p>

  <p>Andrew took the glasses, but he didn't need them. "The lame pony," he
  answered. "It's the last one left, or he'd have waited for another. Bulah
  Singh's footsore. He's lost his gang. I'll bet they slipped off that ledge
  that I warned him against. All right, we needn't hide from one man." Andrew
  stood up, humming to himself. "Guts! You've got to hand it to him. He looks
  as proud as Milton's Lucifer. Remember?</p>

  <p class="poem">"His spear, to equal which the tallest pine<br>
  Hewn on Norwegian hills to be the mast<br>

  <p>"Andrew, when you quote your gloomy old Milton, you can sometimes drive
  away gloom like a bad dream!"</p>

  <p>Andrew filled his lungs, as if he breathed new confidence. He laughed:
  "Let's leave him to it. He has a long walk ahead, and no resources but his
  own malice. The first trick's ours. Let's go tackle the black magician!"</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch30"
     id="ch30">CHAPTER 30</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Seven miles to go, to the village. Now Andrew and Elsa
  brought up the rear, riding side by side. The starving baggage ponies could
  be trusted to find the shortest way and needed no urging. They knew
  instinctively that food awaited them not far beyond the treeless yellow dunes
  in the distance. Bompo Tsering and the rest of the Tibetans, by another
  instinct, knew that danger from the rear had dissolved itself. So they, too,
  could be trusted. If Andrew had told them in words that Bulah Singh had lost
  his entire gang and all his provisions, they might not have believed. They
  would at least have doubted; since how could Andrew know what had happened?
  But they had read Andrew's thought&mdash;or believed they had. That was as
  convincing as if a skillful political liar had said it. It felt like their
  own knowledge. They were even inventing dreams, and telling one another, how
  the soul of the man from Koko Nor had beckoned through the fog and brought
  the Sikh's gang crashing down to death to keep him company in hell. Andrew's
  message, tied by Bompo Tsering to the good saint's thigh bone and re-enforced
  by Bompo Tsering's prayers, had made that necromancy possible. So Andrew's
  cap sported another invisible feather and Bompo Tsering, forgetting that
  Andrew knew at least some Tibetan and unaware that Andrew listened to him
  downwind, magnified its importance for his own reflected glory:</p>

  <p>"I always told you unbelieving, adulterous bastards that Gunnigun knows
  what he's doing! Wait and see! When we reach this village Gunnigun will know
  how to deal with the black magician!"</p>

  <p>Andrew felt considerably less sure of that than Bompo Tsering did. His
  head was beginning to feel too much in the sky. His feet weren't on the
  ground, the way they had been while there were tangible things to be done.
  Falling back beside Elsa to think over the problem of Lung-gom-pa, he was
  silent for several minutes. Then, when he began to talk, he suddenly became
  expansive. He revealed a phase of himself that Elsa had never before seen. It
  scared her. She didn't know what to make of it. It might be a physical
  reaction from the exhausting march over the mountains. He sounded almost
  drunk. He said the exact opposite of things he always had insisted were too
  true to dispute. He said them aggressively. For instance:</p>

  <p>"You can't successfully oppose ideas with facts."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, are you feeling the strain of that awful march?"</p>

  <p>"Hell, no. You and I have stood it better than the Tibetans. That's
  because we're not so sure as they are that evil has brains.&mdash;But I was
  talking about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You were talking about a black magician and black magic."</p>

  <p>"That stuff's a boomerang."</p>

  <p>"Andrew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's like poison gas. You can't aim it. It flows on the wind. If the wind
  changes, it blows back on the user. That becomes the problem: is there some
  way of changing the wind?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, it's not long since you didn't believe in any kind of magic. Are
  you sure you do now? Is your mind troubled because Bulah Singh's men died on
  that precipice?"</p>

  <p>"Hell, no. They followed their own leader. They were like Germans obeying
  Hitler. Let 'em take the consequences."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, it makes me sick to think of what happened. I believe it upsets
  you, too. But you're not to blame. Are you blaming yourself? You did your
  best to prevent it. You sent Bompo Tsering back to post a warning for Bulah
  Singh."</p>

  <p>"Sure. But do you know what happened?"</p>

  <p>Elsa did know. That was why she was troubled. But she knew, too, what
  troubled Andrew; and that troubled her worse. He had been trying to use magic
  in which he less than half believed. That way lies ruin. She closed her eyes,
  and saw more clearly than in a mirror what had happened. But what disturbed
  her much more than the vision of death was Andrew's voice describing it, as
  if he read it from a book as he rode beside her:</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh was leading. He spotted my message on white paper in the gray
  fog fluttering in the wind from the saint's thigh bone beside the trail. He
  dismounted&mdash;read it and&mdash;" Andrew paused, as if a cloud had covered
  what he saw. Too well she knew that sensation. She urged him, as others
  usually urged her:</p>

  <p>"What then? What happened then?"</p>

  <p>He seemed to see again. He spoke slowly: "Bulah Singh believed my message
  might be a trick. So he tested it out. He sent one man ahead, lying to him
  about the ledge being safe. Nothing happened. Then Bulah Singh followed,
  alone. Again nothing happened. So he used a police whistle to call the rest
  of his men forward. They came&mdash;and an avalanche of rocks and ice swept
  them all to death on the crags below&mdash;every last one of them."</p>

  <p>He grew silent again, until Elsa spoke: "That might have happened to
  us."</p>

  <p>"It did happen to them. There was a reason why. It wasn't a mere accident.
  I want to figure out the reason."</p>

  <p>"What happened after that, Andrew?"</p>

  <p>"The man who had crossed first turned on Bulah Singh in a kind of panic.
  Perhaps hysteria. He seemed to go mad. He accused Bulah Singh of being in
  league with devils. He rode at Bulah Singh. They fought. Bulah Singh shot
  him. The man's pony went galloping back along the ledge, slipped on a loose
  stone and fell over to join the rest of them. That's what happened."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"Then Bulah Singh had no course left but to follow us."</p>

  <p>"He could have turned back," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"No, he couldn't."</p>

  <p>"He thought of doing it."</p>

  <p>"He hadn't food, or strength enough. If he'd reached India, he'd have had
  to face trial for murder."</p>

  <p>"Andrew! Do you see that, too!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But if I think about it something gets in the way. If I don't think,
  it's as clear as daylight. On his way from Darjeeling toward the border,
  Bulah Singh shot a man he thought was Lewis. He still thinks it was
  Lewis."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But can you see who it really was?"</p>

  <p>"No, I can't. But the victim didn't look like Lewis. I believe it was
  someone who was spying on Lewis. Bulah Singh shot the wrong man by
  mistake."</p>

  <p>"Yes. He did. But where? Can you see where?"</p>

  <p>"No. I guess I've never been there&mdash;somewhere not far north of
  Darjeeling."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, did you ever see the Jesuit Mission?"</p>

  <p>"No. Off my route."</p>

  <p>"Did you never meet Father Patrick?"</p>

  <p>"No. Friend of Nancy's, isn't he? I never saw him."</p>

  <p>"He isn't dead," said Elsa. "Not yet. Bulah Singh shot him, in the dark,
  near the Jesuit Mission, by mistake, thinking he was Morgan Lewis."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Can't you see! You were seeing a moment ago. And now Morgan Lewis
  and Nancy Strong are both at the Mission, trying to save Father Patrick's
  life. Dr. Lewis has extracted the bullet from Father Patrick's lung."</p>

  <p>Andrew was silent. Suddenly he chuckled. "Well," he said, "we can't prove
  one word of it. So let's not kid ourselves."</p>

  <p>The anticlimax fell like a wet blanket. "That seems to amuse you," said
  Elsa. "But now, perhaps you can begin to understand what I meant when I said
  I hated clairvoyance. Sometimes one can see. Sometimes not. But one can never
  prove anything to the satisfaction of anyone except another clairvoyant; and
  only then if the clairvoyant can see what you see."</p>

  <p>"I'm not clairvoyant," said Andrew. He sounded disgusted. Elsa didn't know
  how to answer. It was no use arguing. She asked a question instead: "What
  actually are you&mdash;besides being an artist and&mdash;and&mdash;a skeptic?
  What else are you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm an explorer."</p>

  <p>"Exploring what?"</p>

  <p>Andrew was becoming irritated. He visibly summoned patience and spoke like
  a man on the witness stand:</p>

  <p>"I believe the world we all live in is different from what it seems to our
  senses to be. I began with Huxley, who was my father's high priest. I was
  weaned on Ingersoll, who had more religion in him than a carload of
  archbishops. And I've tried to follow Einstein into Relativity and all that
  stuff. I believe we exist in a kind of magnetic field. I'm trying to explore
  that. I'm convinced there's something phony about time and space. It's
  possible to get back of them and to know whatever's going on, anywhere, any
  time. There&mdash;is that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we both mean the same thing," said Elsa, "only we use different
  words."</p>

  <p>"I guess not," he answered. "You're clairvoyant."</p>

  <p>That hurt her to silence. He spoke as if clairvoyance was beneath his
  thought not beyond it: something viciously weak. It hurt all the more because
  she herself, until Nancy Strong showed otherwise, had thought clairvoyance a
  curse. She could hardly believe her ears when Andrew continued:</p>

  <p>"I imagine Nancy Strong, and perhaps Lewis too, were thinking of us. In
  some way that I intend to find out, that united their field of thought with
  ours and we saw what they had experienced. Probably they saw what we've been
  doing. The same with Bulah Singh. Coming along behind us, hating
  us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elsa objected: "Nancy and Dr. Lewis don't hate us."</p>

  <p>"Probably not. But Bulah Singh does. So love and hate can't have anything
  to do with it. The point is: Bulah Singh was thinking of you and me,
  wondering how the devil he could overtake us and outwit us. That coincided
  with our thought about him. Somehow that united our magnetic fields, to use a
  phrase for an unknown condition. So we were able to see what he had
  experienced. And he may have known what we're thinking about. But perhaps
  not. I've learned one or two tricks about keeping my thought covered."</p>

  <p>"So you're not clairvoyant, are you, Andrew?"</p>

  <p>"No, thank the Lord!" He spoke with condescension too faint for himself to
  detect. But she winced at it. "Clairvoyance," he continued, "may be a kind of
  sensitiveness. Perhaps a form of nervousness. It seems to have made you
  suffer."</p>

  <p>Elsa rode to her own rescue. Even her tired pony felt the spiritual surge
  that was like a convert's asseveration of new faith in the face of
  torment</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I love clairvoyance! I wouldn't exchange it for anything in this
  world!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be damned!"</p>

  <p>"I would rather die than lose it!" She deliberately quoted Nancy Strong:
  "It's the substance of things hoped for! It's the evidence of things not
  seen!"</p>

  <p>"You'll quote the Pope next!"</p>

  <p>"Your talk about magnetic fields is scientific cant&mdash;sheer piffle!
  Did you read it in a magazine off a news stand?"</p>

  <p>"Say, see here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's a smoke-screen! You exude it like a cuttlefish to save yourself from
  thought! Magnetic poppycock! Clairvoyance is evolution! It's the proof of
  expansion of consciousness&mdash;a step forward! The reason why we saw what
  we did see was the same reason why Bulah Singh didn't see it&mdash;couldn't
  possibly have seen it! We're clairvoyant. So is Nancy Strong. So is Morgan
  Lewis. Bulah Singh isn't!"</p>

  <p>Andrew stared, reappraising, himself feeling normal again but aware of
  Elsa's new self-confidence. Her eyes glowed with passionate conviction.</p>

  <p>"Have I been thoughtless?" he asked. "Have I said something that hurt? If
  so, I'm sorry. I beg pardon. I wouldn't hurt you for worlds."</p>

  <p>"No! But if you thought me your equal, you'd fight! You'd fight to
  kill!"</p>

  <p>"Me? Kill you? Elsa, you're&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're not telling me, Andrew. I'm telling you. It isn't being hit that
  hurts. You've seen me take it. And I've seen you take it. We've a right to
  respect each other. It's being treated as an inferior that galls."</p>

  <p>"I've never treated you as an inferior."</p>

  <p>"You're doing it now! You're talking down to me!"</p>

  <p>He laughed. "Have it your own way, Elsa. If this is down, what's up? I was
  admiring you."</p>

  <p>"I know it. The way you'd admire a dog that obeyed orders, or a pony that
  wouldn't quit, no matter how tired it might be.&mdash;Please! I'm sorry I
  spoke. I won't do it again."</p>

  <p>"May I apologize?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Okay. Then you listen to me!"</p>

  <p>"Your obedient, humble servant," she answered grimly.</p>

  <p>"God!" he retorted. "It's a mystery how a girl can use formal words and
  make them cut like frost! What have I done now?"</p>

  <p>"You? Nothing, Andrew, nothing! 'Blow, blow, thou winter wind! Thou art
  not so unkind as man's ingratitude.' Is that what you meant?" She sounded
  almost more heartbroken than sarcastic. "Dear Andrew, I'm truly grateful to
  you. Truly I am. I would die to prove it, and be grateful for that too. But I
  love clairvoyance."</p>

  <p>"Very well," he answered. "Let it go at that. You're clairvoyant. You love
  it. I'm looking for something rational to help to deal with a human devil in
  this village we're coming to." He urged his pony forward, so that all she saw
  now was the broad of his back.</p>

  <p>She felt like crying. She fell farther behind for a moment as the ponies
  passed between two boulders. When she drew abreast again she was smiling.
  That gave her away. Even blinded by anger Andrew knew she couldn't smile like
  that and mean it, after what had just passed. He reined in&mdash;dismounted
  &mdash;held her pony's rein:</p>

  <p>"See here," he said, looking her in the eyes, "we've got mad at each other
  for no reason. Let's forgive, and not do it again." He forced a laugh into
  his voice. "I'm still so angry I can hardly keep from swearing. But I've
  nothing against you. It can't be your fault. Please!"</p>

  <p>"I forgive you, Andrew. Of course I do. Please forgive me."</p>

  <p>He nodded, staring. Suddenly they both asked the same question: "What for?
  What have we done to each other?" They laughed lamely.</p>

  <p>"Damned if I know," said Andrew. "What have we done to each other?
  Something's gone. We were first-class friends until&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted: "Andrew, I believe I know what has happened."</p>

  <p>"Then I wish you'd tell me."</p>

  <p>"You won't get angry again?"</p>

  <p>"I'll try not to. Is it something personal? To you? Or to me?"</p>

  <p>"Both of us, Andrew! Personal as breathing!"</p>

  <p>"Jesus! Now what's coming! Metaphysics? Okay. Go ahead&mdash;I'll
  listen."</p>

  <p>"Will you really listen? Will you believe I'm not trying to&mdash;not
  trying to put one over on you, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His voice changed perceptibly: "Sure. I said I'd listen."</p>

  <p>"And you begin with Huxley?"</p>

  <p>"He'll do. Quote him accurately, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Didn't he say there must be beings in the universe whose intelligence is
  as much beyond ours as ours exceeds that of a black beetle?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Huxley wrote that."</p>

  <p>"You believe it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't disbelieve it. I'd take Huxley against the field, and lay odds
  on."</p>

  <p>"Andrew! You and I are tuned in with Nancy Strong, Morgan Lewis, and
  &mdash;and they're tuned in with Lobsang Pun&mdash;and he's tuned in with
  even higher intelligences!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe. But what are you driving at?"</p>

  <p>"Their thought, even when it tells of murder, doesn't make you and me
  angry."</p>

  <p>"No. But something else did. I'm in a bloody temper."</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh and the black magician in this village know each other.
  Didn't you say that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Lung-gom-pa has been to Darjeeling."</p>

  <p>"They're tuned in to each other's thought, and they're thinking about us!
  We're between them, thinking about them. That's what made us angry. We're
  between a devil and a would-be devil; and they, too, are tuned into a greater
  intelligence, such as Huxley spoke of. But theirs is wicked! Ours isn't."</p>

  <p>Andrew whistled, softly at first, then louder. He grinned at Elsa,
  studying her face as if he were going to carve her portrait in wood. "I can't
  argue it," he said at last. "Your saying it seems to take the strain
  off."</p>

  <p>"Making us angry with each other," said Elsa, "would be the easiest way to
  make us make mistakes."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's true. It would be. Get a man's goat and you've got his
  number. Sure that's true. But would they do that deliberately?"</p>

  <p>"That's how black magic works," she answered. "White magic works by
  restoring confidence and canceling anger and fear. Black magic&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But deliberately?"</p>

  <p>"They could&mdash;if the magician is skillful. But it might work that way
  anyhow, without their intending it. Nancy told me that crossed mental
  currents are much more deadly than an electrical short circuit."</p>

  <p>Andrew climbed into the saddle, carefully, giving the pony time to get set
  to the weight. He led the way. Turning in the saddle suddenly, he said:</p>

  <p>"See here! If you're right about the anger, then it must be a magnetic
  field that&mdash;what are you laughing at now?"</p>

  <p>"Your magnetic field! And your logic! Andrew! Supposing anger should need
  a magnetic field&mdash;does that prove that Nancy and you and I&mdash;or
  anyone else&mdash;need one for not being angry in? Does the fact that sharks
  need water prove that birds can't fly in the wind?&mdash;Andrew &mdash;didn't
  Nancy tell you about superconsciousness?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. "</p>

  <p>"Did you believe her?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Are you getting angry again?"</p>

  <p>He waited until her pony drew abreast. Then he answered: "I don't
  understand about superconsciousness. But can you keep me from getting angry
  until we've dealt with Lung-gom-pa and Bulah Singh?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I can try. Have I your permission to try?"</p>

  <p>"You sure have. Hop right to it. I'm feeling fit to kill the first son of
  a bitch who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Poetry, Andrew! Poetry! Try Milton!"</p>

  <p>He had no use for Milton at that moment. They rode forward to the buoyant
  stanzas of Walt Whitman, chanted, as if harp strings set the time:</p>

  <p>"Roaming in thought over the universe, I saw the little that is Good
  steadily hastening toward immortality, And the vast that is evil I saw
  hastening to merge itself and become lost and dead."</p>

  <p class="first">Revolting filth and a breath-snatching stink, which not even
  the Tibetan wind could deal with, increased the sensation of being close to
  the village, although they couldn't yet see it. Huge dogs announced its
  neighborhood &mdash;from over by the cemetery, where the ragyabas* had
  carried a recent human corpse and had dismembered it with axes. But no sign
  of the ragyaba carriers-out-of-the-dead: perhaps they had seen, and were
  scared, and had run for cover. The dogs were quarreling with vultures for the
  fragments of human meat, but some of them found time to do their duty and bay
  downwind, threatening all comers. There was no otherthreat&mdash;no sign of
  armed men, nor even of a lookout&mdash;only smoke, rising over a dune and
  flattened by the wind into a long smear, like a brush stroke reaching to the
  sunset on the far horizon.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>ragyabas</i> (Tibetan)&mdash;untouchables. The

  <p>Bompo Tsering and the baggage train were waiting in a group in a hollow.
  Beyond that was a gap between yellow dunes. Framed in the gap was the
  turquoise sky.</p>

  <p>"Like the end of the world!" said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Like the jumping-off place!"</p>

  <p>"Like one of Dunsany's plays!"</p>

  <p>"I never saw one."</p>

  <p>"Like you go first&mdash;like hot damn being no afraid like me," said
  Bompo Tsering. He was stuttering&mdash;nervous. "Being Lung-gom-pa!" he
  added.</p>

  <p>It was puzzling that no one had come to greet or challenge them. The
  village was a notorious bandits' stronghold. Its inhabitants had no other
  known occupation than robbing and smuggling. Bandits, as a rule, don't hide
  from small numbers. Andrew puckered his eyes, staring:</p>

  <p>"If it weren't for that smear of smoke, I'd say the place was deserted. No
  very recent hoof marks. No new footprints."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering shook his head. His warning right hand clutched a prayer
  wheel. "Uh-uh! Plenty peoples catching&mdash;what-you-call-um?&mdash;
  ambush&mdash;maybe! Uh-uh!"</p>

  <p>Andrew questioned Elsa with raised eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"No," she answered. "No sensation of immediate danger. It's all strange
  and new and scary, but not terrifying."</p>

  <p>"New?"</p>

  <p>"That's how it feels. Changed in a hurry. I can't explain it. It was bad.
  Now it isn't so bad."</p>

  <p>"If we wait too long, they may think we're afraid," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"What are we waiting for?"</p>

  <p>"For someone to show up. That's customary. It isn't manners to go forward
  uninvited." He meant, it isn't wise to be caught, on tired ponies, in a gap
  between dunes, with no room to turn and run. But he didn't choose to say that
  to Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Why not send one man forward?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. He made a signal that re-formed the line behind Bompo
  Tsering, with the dejected baggage ponies at the rear. Then he spoke slowly,
  thinking in back of the words:</p>

  <p>"This is one of those times when any move may be right or wrong. There's
  no way to figure it. It's a question of are we in luck? Let's go forward and
  find out." He gave the command. "Ride behind me," he told Elsa, "just back of
  me, where I know where you are. Tell me anything you see that you think I
  don't see."</p>

  <p>Eagles&mdash;blue sky above the yellow flanks of the notch&mdash;an
  increasing stench&mdash;then, suddenly, the village, walled like a secret
  fortress in the midst of a hundred irregular acres of yellow muck. The
  surrounding dunes formed a natural rampart that a mere gang could defend
  indefinitely against anything less than long-range guns. It was a perfect
  hide-out. Sunset revealed the roofs of long, low buildings, just visible over
  the village wall. No monastery. Nothing resembling a religious building; and
  no bells. Only one roof higher than the rest, and even that not visible
  beyond the outer ramparts. One wooden gate&mdash;and in front of the gate, on
  foot, the reception committee&mdash;ten men, clad in long Tibetan overcoats,
  armed to the teeth.</p>

  <p>"Japanese rifles!" said Andrew. "But Heil Hitler!&mdash;German automatics!
  I wonder which of 'em is Lung-gom-pa."</p>

  <p>"None of those is," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"I believe you're right."</p>

  <p>"I know I'm right."</p>

  <p>One man strode forward, smiling. He didn't stick out his tongue. He wasn't
  servile. He gave the impression of being something less than friendly, but,
  if actually hostile, then treacherous; because he certainly offered
  hospitality. He might have been deaf and dumb for all the response he made to
  Andrew's greeting. He made a grandiose gesture of invitation, faced about and
  led toward the gate in the village wall, not glancing backward.</p>

  <p>The gate guard stood aside, out of step, but in something vaguely like a
  military movement. They formed an irregular line and presented arms. No two
  held their rifles in quite the same way. They certainly weren't soldiers, but
  they had been drilled recently. Someone who peered through an eyehole opened
  the gate. Andrew followed the guide and the procession followed Andrew into a
  very narrow lane that turned sharp left between the wall and a line of one-
  storied buildings. The gate slammed shut behind the last pony. It sounded
  like a deadfall. The armed men climbed up rough steps and redistributed
  themselves along the wall, on watch. Andrew stared both ways along the filthy
  lane.</p>

  <p>"It's a pip of a trap, if it is one," he remarked to Elsa. "That wall's a
  honey. From beyond the dunes it looks like part of the dunes. It's perfect
  camouflage. We couldn't see those guys' heads on the wall. But they saw
  us."</p>

  <p>"Someone else can see us now," said Elsa. "We're being watched."</p>

  <p>"Yes. It's probably Lung-gom-pa. But where is he?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. But I don't think it's a trap. Not yet, it isn't."</p>

  <p>The guide beckoned. At the far end of the narrow lane a man stood with a
  lantern. Beside him was a boy with a flashlight. It was hardly twilight yet,
  but the buildings at the turn of the wall cast a deep shadow&mdash;almost
  black darkness. Very strange it felt, under a blue sky. It was freezing hard;
  the ponies' breath went upward in clouds of steam. From a roof, not more than
  a couple of feet above Andrew's head, a Tibetan woman leaned over and stuck
  her tongue out. Realizing suddenly that Elsa was female, she drew in her
  tongue and spat. She just missed Elsa's eyes. Standing in his stirrups Andrew
  slapped the woman's face hard with the back of his hand. She fled along the
  roof, holding her jaw as she ran, pursued by laughter and by a long string of
  curses from Bompo Tsering.</p>

  <p>"Are you angry?" Elsa asked. "Better be more careful. That woman wears
  gold jewelry. She's someone. She owns a rich man."</p>

  <p>Andrew wished he hadn't hit the woman. He had done it on the spur of a
  moment. However, the guide took no notice; perhaps he actually was deaf, dumb
  and stupid. With a gesture he turned them over to the lantern man, who
  appeared to obey the boy with the flashlight. The boy was too well dressed,
  and too clean to be honest. Andrew disliked him, and the boy disliked Andrew.
  Making impudent remarks in Tibetan about foreign devils, the boy led around
  the corner, where it was really dark and as cold as a morgue. Lantern and
  flashlight revealed a door into a barn-like building that was thatched with
  straw and floored with flat stones set in clay. The boy led the way in.
  Someone lighted a torch. In a moment at the far end there was a bright fire
  of resinous wood; it threw clouds of spark-lit smoke through a square hole in
  the roof.</p>

  <p>"You're right. No trap yet," said Andrew. "This is reckless hospitality.
  That firewood cost a young fortune. They must have brought it a hundred miles
  &mdash;maybe farther."</p>

  <p>The place stank, but it was Tibet, so that was natural. The big room had
  been roughly swept quite recently. There were only the faint remains of heaps
  of dung along the side where ponies had been stalled from time immemorial. On
  the opposite side was a long wooden shelf for humans to sleep on. There was a
  table&mdash;two benches&mdash;buckets. At the far end, near the fire, was
  water in a big iron barrel&mdash;frozen on top, but beginning to thaw.</p>

  <p>The ponies clattered in and stood in line, rumps to the wall, whinnying a
  little. Andrew ordered the loads and saddles off first thing, and Bompo
  Tsering knew better than to hesitate. He prodded and goaded the gang. He even
  ordered hoofs and backs examined&mdash;then the buckets filled. The ponies
  drank greedily.</p>

  <p>Four elderly men entered, with their hands, hidden by long sleeves,
  crossed on their breasts. They bowed slightly, glancing curiously at the
  loads that made a big pile, near the table, in mid-room. They were
  expensively dressed, heavily robed in handwoven cloth and knee-high cloth
  boots. They gave an impression of being educated, civilized. One wore
  spectacles; he went close to the loads. He seemed to be smelling them. The
  three others approached Andrew. He bowed stiffly, not sure yet just what
  attitude to take.</p>

  <p>"Which of you speaks English?"</p>

  <p>None did. Bompo Tsering came forward to interpret. But Andrew didn't
  choose just then to be at Bompo Tsering's mercy. Neither did he wish to amuse
  those Tibetans, who were sure to laugh at his effort to pronounce their
  language. Such laughter isn't always contemptuous. It's sometimes friendly.
  But dignity is better, to begin with. So he dismissed Bompo Tsering and asked
  Elsa to interpret.</p>

  <p>"Ask 'em first whose guests we are."</p>

  <p>They were so surprised by Elsa's fluent Tibetan and perfect singsong
  pronunciation that they couldn't find words for a moment. They couldn't make
  out whether she was man or woman. They glanced at each other; and when they
  did perceive at last that she was female they were even more puzzled&mdash;
  not embarrassed, but surprised. One of them spoke at last, and Andrew
  understood him, but he pretended not to. Elsa interpreted:</p>

  <p>"He says we are pelings, who have no business in Tibet. Consequently we
  are no one's guests, because the law forbids hospitality to foreign devils.
  But since we are the keepers of a promise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What does he mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Since we are the keepers of a promise we may spend a night
  here. But tomorrow we must turn back.&mdash;You asked me to help you keep
  your temper!"</p>

  <p>"Okay. Anger's gone downwind. I'm feeling swell."</p>

  <p>"Shall I ask for the magician?"</p>

  <p>"Don't mention names. No. Give 'em nothing to lay hold of. Tell 'em I want
  food for the ponies."</p>

  <p>Elsa interpreted. The Tibetans consulted each other before one of them
  answered.</p>

  <p>"They say they will first send food for us," said Elsa. "It shall be
  brought now."</p>

  <p>"Tell 'em I want food for the ponies first thing."</p>

  <p>"They say no."</p>

  <p>"I say yes."</p>

  <p>"They say 'very well' then, since you are so insistent." But they add that
  you don't know the danger of giving offense to someone who is better not
  offended."</p>

  <p>"Tell 'em that's fifty-fifty."</p>

  <p>"Must I?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Say I'm reasonable if I get fair treatment."</p>

  <p>"They say they intend to show you as much kindness as it is permitted to
  show to a foreign devil."</p>

  <p>"Tell 'em my ponies are me, and their empty bellies are my belly. A full
  meal for the ponies might open my mouth."</p>

  <p>Elsa interpreted. One of the Tibetans turned toward the door, where two
  men lurked who looked like real brigands. They were filthy, bulky,
  evil-looking fellows, each armed with two automatics in leather holsters.
  They leaned against the doorposts and listened sullenly while the man who had
  turned toward them gave an order. Then one of them walked away, and presently
  he could be heard cursing and giving orders of his own. It sounded as if
  scores of villagers were out there in the dark, but no one could be seen,
  although the door was open.</p>

  <p>"That man has gone to get food for the ponies," said Elsa. "Barley and
  hay."</p>

  <p>"Good. Ask now why the man in spectacles is poking his nose in among our
  loads."</p>

  <p>Before Elsa could speak, the man in spectacles looked up and spoke
  suddenly. He seemed excited. He almost shouted a command. The one brigand
  left in the doorway stood erect at once and strode forward. Evidently the man
  in spectacles was an important personage. He pointed to one of the loads. The
  brigand hauled it off the pile and looked around for someone to help him
  raise it to his shoulder. He had the impudence to tell Bompo Tsering to come
  and do it.</p>

  <p>"Temper, Andrew! Temper!"</p>

  <p>"Okay. "</p>

  <p>Andrew felt strangely at ease, as a matter of fact. He didn't have to
  pretend to be good-humored. He suspected Elsa of Nancy Stronging him in some
  subtle way&mdash;perhaps something like Christian Science. Whatever it was,
  it made him feel good and not the least bit quarrelsome. He grinned quite
  friendly as he went and stood in front of the brigand&mdash;so friendly that
  the brigand supposed he had come to help lift the load. Elsa followed Andrew,
  fearful that he might use his fists. But his voice sounded jocular:</p>

  <p>"Tell him that load contains my personal belongings."</p>

  <p>The man in spectacles ignored Elsa. He betrayed impatience. He spoke
  rapidly to Andrew. Bompo Tsering came closer, suspecting there might be a
  fight; at a fight's beginning he was almost always a staunch ally; but his
  face fell as he listened. There would not only be no fight, but there was a
  new mystery, of which he knew nothing. He, Bompo Tsering, headman and keeper
  of Gunnigun's secrets, had been left out of a secret so important that even
  the man in spectacles spoke humbly of it, using cautious words, avoiding
  names or any mention of the contents of the load. Furthermore, Bompo Tsering
  knew that Andrew had told the truth: that load actually did contain his
  personal private things such as underwear, books, writing paper. It was a
  canvas bag that fastened with zipper and padlock.</p>

  <p>Elsa interpreted: "The man in spectacles says that is 'the load.' I don't
  know what he means. He says 'look at the mark.'"</p>

  <p>Andrew did look at the mark. It was Chinese. It had been painted there by
  Lan-dor-ling, the storekeeper at the Sikkim border, who had counted all the
  loads and marked them, as he said, to prevent confusion with other loads that
  he had in the godown. Andrew tried the padlock, using his pocket flashlight
  for appearance's sake, not letting on that he had any special information. He
  seemed just curious.</p>

  <p>"Have you a key that fits this padlock?" he demanded. "Or do you plan to
  break the padlock? Or to cut the bag? Which?"</p>

  <p>The man in spectacles pretended not to understand. But Elsa explained. So
  he had to leave off pretending. He fell back on insolence, signing to the
  smelly bandit to shoulder the load and be off. Andrew got in the man's
  way:</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing!"</p>

  <p>He and the bandit grinned at each other. The man in spectacles spoke
  rapidly&mdash;looked menacing, glaring through thick lenses. He kept opening
  and shutting his hands and glancing toward the open door. Andrew waited for
  Elsa to speak:</p>

  <p>"He says this load contains some packages intended for the very worshipful
  ruler of the village."</p>

  <p>"Tell him," said Andrew, "that I have the key. If the bag's to be opened
  at all, it'll be in my presence."</p>

  <p>"He says perhaps you may be invited later."</p>

  <p>"Okay. If so, if I'm asked politely, I'll bring the bag with me."</p>

  <p>"He says the bag is needed now."</p>

  <p>"Love my bag, love me!" said Andrew. "Tell 'em nothing else doing!"</p>

  <p>Then came sudden interruption. A dozen sturdy peasants, bossed by the
  bandit, came carrying bags of grain and big bundles of hay. The hungry ponies
  neighed welcome to the smell; they had to hear and feel the whip to keep them
  from rushing the corn sacks. Bompo Tsering had to be threatened to keep him
  from using the whip too fiercely, to relieve his own emotions. There was
  pandemonium for a moment. Urged by the man in spectacles the bandit took
  advantage of it and tried to get away with the padlocked load. Andrew got in
  his way. They were face to face again, grinning. Then another gang brought in
  food for Bompo Tsering and the Tibetans&mdash;a huge urn, big loaves of
  barley bread, stewed meat in a copper pot&mdash;good-smelling food, and
  plenty. The man in spectacles became angry, or else did a good job of
  pretending to be:</p>

  <p>"You are being well treated! Look! Your servants are being fed! Your
  ponies have been given plenty! Why do you refuse what is right?"</p>

  <p>This time Andrew answered direct: "Tell the ruler of the village he can
  come here and I'll open the bag. Or if he prefers, I'll take it to his house
  and we'll open it there."</p>

  <p>"But here comes your supper. Eat it while I take away this bag, which is
  not yours! Look! Excellent food! Rice! Curry! Ummnn! Smell it! Eat the
  blessed victuals and be grateful!"</p>

  <p>Two menials set the food on the table. They grinned and beckoned
  invitation. The man in spectacles looked impatient. So did the bandit,
  fingering his two automatics. Andrew glanced at Elsa, wondering whether she
  felt the same emotion he did, or saw the same weird cloud-like gray-green
  haze. It made no difference to what else he saw. He saw through it, past it.
  It wasn't an actual cloud. It was something mental. He couldn't tell from
  Elsa's expression whether she was scared. She was staring toward the open
  door. A man with a lantern was standing just outside it, and so was the
  overdressed boy with the flashlight.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the woman appeared&mdash;the jeweled, well-dressed hussy with the
  slapped face. It looked a bit swollen, but that might be the shadow cast by
  the lantern.</p>

  <p>"She has come for revenge!" said Elsa in a low voice. "She has come to
  watch it happen. Our supper may have been poisoned. Let's be careful."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I hit her," said Andrew. "But it's too late to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elsa wasn't listening to him. She interrupted: "I believe she's that boy's
  mother!"</p>

  <p>"She's a Tibetan," said Andrew. "The boy isn't."</p>

  <p>"But she is the boy's mother!"</p>

  <p>There was a strange silence. It overlay the sound of the ponies munching
  barley spread on sacks in front of them. Even the hungry Tibetans had stopped
  eating and were watching the door. The man in spectacles, and his three
  companions, and the bandit who was still holding on to the bag, were all
  staring at the door. They hardly breathed.</p>

  <p>The woman, with her back to the doorpost, glanced once over her shoulder
  and smiled. The boy came and stood beside her, just inside the door, holding
  her hand, turning his flashlight on Andrew. The woman spoke to him. He turned
  the light on Elsa, holding it steady. The woman smiled at Elsa; her lip
  curled.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, quietly, slowly, from the outer darkness&mdash;first nothing but
  a face, then gradually taking form like a ghost in the lantern light
  &mdash;came Bulah Singh. He leaned on a pole. He limped painfully. He showed
  his teeth. The woman spoke to him. He ignored her. He stared hard at Elsa,
  then straightened himself and walked in through the door.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch32"
     id="ch32">CHAPTER 32</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Nothing seemed real. The darkness was full of quiet sound,
  such as the ponies munching corn. The fire at the far end set shadows
  leaping, that suggested planes of underworld dimensions. There were several
  lanterns &mdash;a flashlight&mdash;shining ponies' eyes&mdash;smoke&mdash;
  blustery wind through the hole in the roof. And there was a nervous dread of
  suddenly born peril, awaited by the woman who held the boy's hand. She very
  definitely thought of magic; it was in her eyes and in her attitude of
  confident awe.</p>

  <p>But the sense that is the least mendacious of the five recognized smoke,
  sweat, food, and the reek of damp sheepskin. Dreams don't smell. Bulah Singh
  stank. It was real, not a dream. Swaying on his feet, the Sikh thrust his
  face close to Andrew's. Though his feet didn't move, there was a sensation of
  his thrusting himself between Andrew and Elsa. He was so exhausted physically
  that he couldn't speak yet, but his thought burned like flame. It glowed
  through his eyes, domineering and less careful than an animal's for anyone or
  anything on earth except his own will. He had shed his mask, or was it his
  shield, or both? Andrew spoke to him like a Spartan:</p>

  <p>"Where's your lame pony?"</p>

  <p>That was comment, not a question. It prodded the lees of exhaustion. Bulah
  Singh's nostrils expanded. Scorn released fumes of strength that lingered in
  him somewhere.</p>

  <p>"Wolves!" His voice creaked like a rusty hinge. "God damn your stupid soul
  to hell, you'd pity a rat on the dissecting table, and let people rot!
  Where's my pony!"</p>

  <p>"You'd better rest yourself."</p>

  <p>Andrew signed to Bompo Tsering to bring one of the loads for the Sikh to
  sit on. But Bulah Singh used his pole to prod the bag that the man in
  spectacles wanted. Suddenly he feigned collapse. His knees gave from under
  him. He clutched Andrew's arm and sat down on the bag, his weight almost
  breaking the brigand's fingernails and forcing him to let go.</p>

  <p>"Idiot!" he croaked at Andrew. "I'm just in time! No thanks to you! And
  now, give me a drink! Whiskey! Neat&mdash;no water."</p>

  <p>He didn't wait for an answer. Grinding his teeth because of the pain in
  his swollen feet, he looked up at the man in spectacles, and almost screamed
  at him: "Aween-aween-ah!"</p>

  <p>For a moment nothing happened. There was astonished silence, except that
  the ponies went on munching, and the wind blew. Andrew questioned Elsa sotto
  voce: "What does that mean?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It isn't Tibetan."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh repeated the phrase, twice, louder each time. The third time
  it sounded like "Ameen-ameen-ah!" The man in spectacles threw up his long-
  sleeved arms and hurried to the door. The others followed, including the men
  who had brought food. Their stampede almost swept away the woman and boy. She
  drew a dagger&mdash;it had a blade no thicker than a bodkin. A man yelled. He
  struck at her&mdash;missed, and vanished, screaming. The woman laughed. She
  wiped blood off the blade on the ball of her thumb, and then the thumb on the
  wall. The boy smiled sweetly, turning his flashlight on the woman's face,
  making her look like a Rembrandt painting of Mary the Mother of God in a
  stable waiting for the Three Wise Men.</p>

  <p>"Shut that door!" said Andrew.</p>

  <p>Unfamiliar impulse caught the boy off guard. He obeyed. He loathed Andrew
  with a half-breed's instinctive unreasoning malice, as quick as a snake's.
  Fearful of missing a move, he aimed his flashlight at Bulah Singh, whose fist
  struck the bag he sat on as he grinned&mdash;with pain and beckoned to the
  boy. It almost looked prearranged. It was the first time Bulah Singh had
  noticed either the boy or the woman. The boy came forward confidently, with a
  kind of gloat in his eyes. The woman followed, keeping her eyes on Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Andrew, please give me the keys," said Elsa. "I will open a chop-box and
  get out whiskey for Bulah Singh."</p>

  <p>"No. Let's find out what's wrong with him before he gets drunk."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh overheard. "Wrong with me? Drunk? Gunning, you god-damned
  idiot, take a drink too, to wake your brains! Don't you know what's in this
  bag I'm sitting on?" Then his expression changed to a confidential leer at
  Elsa. "Yes," he said. "Take his keys. Be a good girl. Go and get me a
  drink."</p>

  <p>Andrew observed that Elsa showed no symptom of intention to obey. He
  hadn't expected she would obey, but he was glad she didn't. She was doing her
  job. By some mysterious means she was avoiding the anger that the woman, and
  the boy and Bulah Singh were all trying to produce. The little beast of a boy
  was the worst of the three. He was an obvious homosexual, probably perverted
  by his elders. He knew by instinct that Andrew loathed that stuff. He
  deliberately showed off, strutting in front of his mother. She was as proud
  of him as if he were reciting poems. Bompo Tsering and all Andrew's Tibetans
  laughed as if it was the funniest thing they had seen.</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh sneered, glancing at Elsa: "Like mother, like son!"</p>

  <p>Either he thought that would please Elsa, or he wanted to disgust her. It
  was hard to guess which.</p>

  <p>"Is he your son?" she retorted. "He looks like you and this woman."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh ignored the question. He commanded the boy to unfasten his
  boots and pull them off. The boy knelt to obey; his unctuous relish was worse
  than servile. He smirked. Bulah Singh harshly ordered the woman to get one of
  the big copper bowls that Andrew's Tibetans had already emptied of food. She
  didn't like obedience; she liked it less when Bompo Tsering tried to prevent
  her from taking the bowl; but he yielded when she drew her dagger. She filled
  the bowl with water and began to warm it at the fire. By that time Bulah
  Singh was in agonies as the boy tried to pull off a boot. He kicked the boy
  in the face&mdash;sent him staggering. The boy wasn't hurt badly but he ran
  to the door, crying.</p>

  <p>The woman came on the run, spilling water, clucking, muttering. She went
  down on her knees, begging Andrew for the loan of his knife to cut the boots
  with. Andrew beckoned to Bompo Tsering. Bulah Singh called the woman a mother
  of whores. He ordered her to pull his boots off gently. She didn't dare. He
  kicked her, hurting his foot. She still didn't dare. Then he turned to Elsa,
  skillfully changing his voice, forcing himself to smile.</p>

  <p>"See what comes of kindness to such bitches! She would let me die of
  gangrene! Please! Will you kindly help me?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Andrew, "she won't!"</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering stood waiting; his expression was as blank as a bun, but his
  eyes were on Andrew's right fist.</p>

  <p>"Your saying, Gunnigun&mdash;my doing," he muttered. "Your not&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>"Pick this Sikh up! Carry him over to the fire, where there'll be light
  and warm water. Take his weapons away and then pull off his boots. Wash his
  feet. Use lots of soap. Then I'll come."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering signaled for help. Before Bulah Singh could protest he was
  picked up by four Tibetans and frog-marched toward the fire, cursing and
  struggling. The woman and the boy came and screamed at Andrew. He ignored
  them and went in search of the load that contained the first-aid kit. The boy
  was crying like a girl. The woman was begging for Bulah Singh's good will, as
  if Andrew had stolen it. She knelt and clutched the hem of Elsa's overcoat,
  imploring her to make Andrew listen, blubbering and screaming a long story of
  how Bulah Singh was the lord of her life, the father of her son; he had
  seduced her in Delhi, raped, ruined her and then sent her home to Tibet.</p>

  <p>Elsa got in a word at last: "Whose woman are you?"</p>

  <p>"His woman!"</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh's?"</p>

  <p>"No! His!" She spoke proudly, recovering self-control: "I am the ruler's
  woman!"</p>

  <p>"Of this village?"</p>

  <p>The woman nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well then, what do you want with Bulah Singh?"</p>

  <p>"He is mine, is he not? Whom I obey, so he must also!"</p>

  <p>Andrew came back with cotton, a roll of bandages and a bottle of iodoform.
  The woman started to wail and plead again. The boy cried. Andrew ordered both
  of them to get out or else go to the fireside, where Bulah Singh was cursing
  like a scalded cat because four Tibetans were holding both his feet in hot
  water. Standing calmly in firelight so that Andrew could see him, Bompo
  Tsering was curiously examining Bulah Singh's weapons&mdash;an automatic, a
  '32 revolver and a dagger almost exactly like the woman's. The boy led the
  woman toward the fire, pulling her by the hand.</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned at Elsa: "Do you get the idea?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't&mdash;except, of course, that the woman is telling the truth.
  What can Bulah Singh know, or think he knows about this bag? It's locked. He
  can't see through canvas!"</p>

  <p>"Can you see clairvoyantly?"</p>

  <p>"No. Is it something you put in there?"</p>

  <p>"Lan-dor-ling did it, down at the border. But I guessed it, so the little
  trick didn't come off. As Chief of Police, Bulah Singh must have known that
  Lan-dor-ling's little game is smuggling opium from India to Tibet. Bulah
  Singh tipped off Lan-dor-ling to hide opium in my loads. That's why
  Lan-dor-ling went to such pains to help you and me reach Tibet."</p>

  <p>"So we're opium smugglers!"</p>

  <p>"It's a cinch we're something. Let's eat before the grub gets too
  cold."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't eat."</p>

  <p>"Neither could I. That grub looks disgusting. Let our Tibetans have it.
  We'll cut a can of something later on."</p>

  <p>"That woman loves us like a cobra," said Elsa. "The food may be
  poisoned."</p>

  <p>"Right. I'll warn Bompo Tsering to make her taste the grub before he
  divides it with the gang. What do you make of the woman?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, she's telling the truth. She belongs to two men. One is the black
  magician who rules this village. He has sent her to influence Bulah
  Singh&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can't believe that: Influence him? He must know Bulah Singh's a total
  loss! Influence him? Why not jump him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. But I don't think Bulah Singh is as helpless as he seems:
  Andrew, how would this be! Get that little beast of a boy here and let's
  question him. You tell me what to ask. I'll talk to him gently."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"He'll lie like hell. We've got to shake that brat or he'll be the end of
  us. His kind of treachery is bred and educated. Our best bet is Bulah Singh.
  I'll talk to him. Do you want to stay or come with me?"</p>

  <p>"I don't like it alone. I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>"Come then. But remember: part of Bulah Singh's trick was to get you to
  take care of his feet, and let the Tibetans see you do it. It was aimed at
  your mental set-up. That 'ud reduce you to the menial class and give you a
  claim on him. He could pretty easily reverse that into a claim by him on you.
  That's old stuff; it's had whiskers since Adam and Eve. All the politicians
  use it. It works nine times out of ten unless you're wise to it. So watch
  out. Don't fall for his thanks, or his pain, or his&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, it sounds funny to hear you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Okay! Laugh! But there'll be nothing funny if Bulah Singh gets you
  hypnotized! Suppose you carry the bandages. Come on."</p>

  <p>He strode ahead. The ponies sniffed at Elsa as she passed. She touched
  their noses, light-fingered. When Andrew reached the zone of firelight he
  paused for a second and spoke in a half-whisper:</p>

  <p>"Remember: don't give him a break. Don't pity him. Leave this to me."</p>

  <p>It was like a medieval torture scene in crimson firelight and leaping
  shadow, With Bompo Tsering acting chief inquisitor, standing aloof with the
  weapons, waiting for the moment. Nine men watched, fascinated, keeping the
  woman and boy outside their circle. Bulah Singh was being held down on a
  saddle by two men who held his arms twisted behind him. Their knees were in
  his back. There was an arm around his throat. Two men held his feet in the
  pan of hot soapy water. At a gesture from Andrew they let him lift his knees,
  so that he leaned backward with his feet in the air.</p>

  <p>"Wash 'em some more," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>The Sikh set his teeth. They plunged his feet back in the pan. He breathed
  hard through his nose.</p>

  <p>"Andrew, the man's in agony! Be a bit merciful!"</p>

  <p>"All right, Elsa, all right! Leave this to me! There's nothing else to be
  done."</p>

  <p>Andrew himself took the soap. His strong hands were far more gentle than
  the Tibetans' had been. The woman, staring pop-eyed between two of Andrew's
  men, crooned as she watched the relaxation of relief on Bulah Singh's
  face.</p>

  <p>"Blood poison's the thing to guard against. We'll save your feet," said
  Andrew.</p>

  <p>"You might have saved me this indignity!" Bulah Singh retorted.</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;I might have." Andrew washed steadily. "But I was wise to your
  game. I boomeranged you. Know what that means?"</p>

  <p>"Gunning, you're mad!"</p>

  <p>"No, no, no. I'm easy-minded. Not mad in the least."</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand that your safety depends on me?"</p>

  <p>Andrew smiled. "Here's a towel. Dry your own feet. After that, I'll dust
  em with iodoform and then bandage 'em. Next time you hit the trail, wear
  walking boots. Those things you had on weren't even fit to ride in."</p>

  <p>The Tibetans relaxed their hold. Tenderly the Sikh dried his own feet,
  until suddenly he caught sight of the woman's face. He tossed the towel to
  her. At a gesture from Andrew the Tibetans let her pass. The boy followed
  her. The woman squatted and took the Sikh's feet in her lap; she and the boy
  worked gently, each using an end of the one towel.</p>

  <p>"You see," said Andrew, "I spotted your plan to have Elsa and me do the
  Jesus foot-wash act in the presence of all these people. Smart stuff! For a
  man in a mean fix you've got presence of mind. It was subtle. That would have
  fixed us, in their minds, as your inferiors."</p>

  <p>"My feet are dry," said Bulah Singh.</p>

  <p>"You won't walk on 'em for quite a while," said Andrew. He handed the
  iodoform to the woman&mdash;showed her how to dust it on, watched her do it,
  went on talking: "I suppose you expect to stay here until your feet get
  well."</p>

  <p>"I am coming with you," the Sikh answered. "I and this child, and the
  woman."</p>

  <p>"You don't say."</p>

  <p>"You will also say it. You will very gladly say it! You will beg me to
  come with you&mdash;when you have heard my news!"</p>

  <p>"Bandages!" said Andrew.</p>

  <p>Elsa wanted to do the bandaging, but Andrew wouldn't let her. He did it
  himself, smiling:</p>

  <p>"Elsa, we owe that woman nothing. Get back the towel, soap and iodoform,
  quick, now, before she hides 'em! If she won't give 'em up, Bompo Tsering
  shall give her the works."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering heard. He followed Elsa. The woman surrendered the towel
  ungraciously, as if to reclaim it were meanness, but she had passed the
  bottle of iodoform to the boy, who had slunk away with it, and with the soap
  too. She pretended to know nothing of anything else, until the boy's cries
  brought her to her senses. Bompo Tsering had caught the boy hiding among the
  ponies. He was beating him. The woman screamed, jumped up and ran to the
  rescue. Bompo Tsering slapped her and threw her down among the ponies; then
  came back with the soap and iodoform. Andrew made mental note of the fact
  that Bulah Singh's weapons had been stowed away in Bompo Tsering's voluminous
  bokkus but he didn't choose to humiliate his own man at that moment.</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh spoke angrily: "Andrew Gunning! Listen well and remember! It
  is safe to punish the woman. She is only a tart. But beware of the boy!"</p>

  <p>"You kicked him!" said Elsa. "I saw you kick him in the face when he was
  trying to pull your boots off."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh sneered: "But don't you do it! I own him, body and soul! If
  you injure him&mdash;if you insult him&mdash;and if I will it, the men of
  this village will spread your pieces on the burial mound for the dogs and
  vultures to come and finish. What they will do to you fir&mdash;Ah!"</p>

  <p>"Damn you, don't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew gripped the Sikh's shoulder so hard that he bit a word in halves.
  "Those bandages," he said, "will do until this time tomorrow. Don't try to
  stand on 'em. My men shall set a box against the wall and sit you on it.
  After that, you shall talk."</p>

  <p>"And you," the Sikh answered, "you&mdash;both of you&mdash;had better
  listen to me&mdash;and remember!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch33"
     id="ch33">CHAPTER 33</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Bulah Singh sat back to the wall, like a war casualty, on a
  pony load of canned provisions, with his bandaged feet stretched out. Bompo
  Tsering, wary of Andrew's mood, and shrewdly aware of the safe way to keep on
  terms, unpacked a canvas chair for Elsa. He arranged it fussily, moving it to
  and fro, partly to draw attention to his thoughtfulness and partly to show
  off to the other Tibetans, who felt inferior because of his wonderful
  manners. Andrew ordered the load dragged up that the man in spectacles had
  wanted. He sat on it, beside Elsa; they faced Bulah Singh, with a semicircle
  of Tibetans behind them and the red firelight on their faces. The woman and
  boy were pushed out in the cold. She tried to force her way to the fireside,
  but Bulah Singh spoke to her sharply. Then she led the boy away and there was
  a gust of bitter wind as she opened the door. When the door slammed shut
  behind them Andrew got up and fastened it. He came back and sat down without
  saying a word. Bulah Singh broke the silence:</p>

  <p>"Andrew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My name's Gunning."</p>

  <p>"Oh. On our dignity. You damned snob! See here, Gunning! If I hadn't
  guaranteed to Lan-dor-ling in Sikkim, and to the magician Lung-gom-pa, who
  owns this village, that you'd carry this opium safely to its destination
  &mdash;I said, to its destination!&mdash;either of two things inevitably must
  have happened to you. Arrest, in Sikkim&mdash;or death, here. Die here if you
  want to. Sign your warrant tonight." He glanced at Elsa. "And leave her to
  her fate."</p>

  <p>"Not on your word," Andrew answered. He didn't glance at Elsa. He was
  hardly conscious of her sitting beside him. He was undergoing what was almost
  a new experience. He went on speaking, staring at Bulah Singh, through him
  and beyond him: "You were stopped at the village gate by a man you'd never
  seen before. A man with a beard who wore an Afghan turban. He scared you. But
  you got past him by boasting you can manage me. That man gave you until nine
  tonight. It leaves you twenty minutes. I'm calling your bluff."</p>

  <p>"I'm not bluffing," the Sikh answered.</p>

  <p>Elsa spoke unexpectedly: "What you really mean is that Mr. Gunning is
  telling the truth and you can't deny it!"</p>

  <p>Something&mdash;perhaps the falling fire, or it might be a pony's snort
  &mdash;something concrete brought Andrew back to his five senses. Things were
  suddenly normal. He saw the Sikh as he was, now, with his back to the wall;
  not as he had been, in the village gate at sunset. But it was a second more
  before it occurred to him that Elsa had been seeing things. He had seen
  Elsa's vision. He tried to repeat. He couldn't. He wanted another glimpse of
  that man at the gate; he was someone much more important than Bulah Singh. He
  had a face like Lenin of Russia, only that the beard hid his chin.</p>

  <p>"Don't!" said Elsa. "Andrew, don't!"</p>

  <p>"Don't what?"</p>

  <p>"Don't try! You only break the image. It's like reflections on still
  water! Let it happen!"</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh laughed. "Our Gunnigun becomes a god! That's what a woman does
  to us! Gunning, save your neck and make your fortune! You lucky devil, if I'd
  died on the mountain these villagers would have simply shot you and divided
  the loot. This is a stupid village. Fools are dangerous. It's thanks to me
  you're alive."</p>

  <p>Andrew felt only contempt for him. He answered with a curt laugh: "Are
  they such fools as to fear a fugitive from justice who has lost his
  followers?"</p>

  <p>It was Bulah Singh's turn to be contemptuous: "Justice? You believe in
  that stuff? Justice, I suppose, slew my men, eh? Divine justice! Oh well,
  perhaps you're right. Fear and treachery are two ponies that drag one tonga.
  My men were scared. They would have turned on me sooner or later. I'm well
  rid of them."</p>

  <p>"And you've lost your baggage."</p>

  <p>"That's nothing either. You can fit me out with what I need. If these
  villagers kill you, I'll take everything." He looked hard at Elsa again.</p>

  <p>Andrew bridled at that. He consulted his watch: "Bulah Singh, you've about
  fifteen minutes. I've never actually killed a man. Unless you use your
  fifteen minutes more wisely than I've seen you do anything yet, you'll be
  Number One."</p>

  <p>"Kill me? You?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Andrew Gunning, you have sentimental morals and grotesque scruples. They
  won't work. On this side of the border the prevailing sentiment is more
  natural. It resembles the Christly compassion of German concentration camps,
  Italian islands, French penal settlements and Russian labor colonies. Good
  standard stuff with no hypocrisy about it. You may have seen the Japs use
  some of it near Shanghai&mdash;or didn't you? These people, like the Japs,
  have adopted the little wooden testicle crusher that Mussolini borrowed from
  the Holy Roman Inquisition and taught the Nazis how to use. It beats anything
  the Chinese ever thought of&mdash;because, you see, the Chinese aren't really
  religious; they can't understand there's a space-time equation of pain
  &mdash;a limit beyond which the tortured can't feel. These Tibetans are
  religious; they don't waste torture; like Hitler's and Mussolini's and
  Franco's specialists, they can keep you alive for a couple of months, if need
  be, while you tell them all you know! You'll be surprised how much you know
  that you didn't know you knew."</p>

  <p>"You've considerably less than fifteen minutes now," Andrew remarked.</p>

  <p>"Bah. I doubt you'd shoot. You're fundamentally sentimental. That means
  you're cruel, and that at bottom you're a coward. Your indignation is an
  emotion, caused by fear of reality. Understand this, Andrew Gunning: either
  you agree to be my partner and we'll play this game together from now on
  &mdash;or else shoot me now and play your own game. Choose! Be quick about
  it! If you don't I guarantee you shall be tortured to death, and they'll make
  Elsa look on, just to educate her."</p>

  <p>Andrew was seeing again&mdash;seeing Elsa's visions. He wished Elsa would
  let up. It made him angry to feel she could make him see. But anger banished
  the vision. He craved it back&mdash;couldn't see it&mdash;had to reach out
  mentally to her. Then there it was again, and along with it a revolting
  sensation that Bulah Singh could also see what they saw.</p>

  <p>All the Tibetans were silent, almost motionless, except that Bompo Tsering
  kept steadily spinning a prayer wheel.</p>

  <p>"Time's on the wing," said Andrew. "You have until nine sharp, by this
  watch, to plead your&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Huh! You mean to tell what I know! If I talk, do you promise to&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>"I promise nothing."</p>

  <p>"Put it this way: if I promise to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No. Your promise would be worthless. I wouldn't depend on it for a
  second. I will form my own opinion of whatever you say and will treat you
  accordingly. Now go ahead."</p>

  <p>They stared at each other. Bulah Singh looked as if he couldn't believe
  his own eyes and ears or believe Andrew's eyes and lips. Andrew didn't
  understand his own reaction. He was disturbed and he wasn't. He felt like two
  people; one was at a masthead, the other on deck at the wheel. The one on
  deck didn't quite trust or understand the other, but the other seemed to
  know, fading away, however, when the one on deck grew angry. So he kept
  trying to adjust two images, like a range finder laying a gun. The target was
  not Bulah Singh; it was something, within himself, that he couldn't clearly
  define through a cloud of anger. He knew Bulah Singh was talking again, but
  he only partially listened, without deep attention.</p>

  <p>"Gunning, you damned idiot, in that bag you're sitting on there's enough
  opium to paralyze the brains of Tibet&mdash;the way the Japs are drugging the
  Chinese. It comes cheaper than money, because the addicts stay bought. It's
  better than soldiers. It's more efficient. It can't mutiny or run away. Drug
  the right man and you need no artillery. If you'd opened your bag you'd have
  found your own things have been thrown out. Lan-dor-ling did that. I ordered
  it. He filled your bag with opium. I picked up your stuff when I reached the
  border. It was on one of my ponies. It's down on the crags now along with all
  my dead men. That bag you're sitting on holds opium&mdash; nothing else.
  Opium. New. Fresh. Ten times stronger than the adulterated morphine and
  cocaine and hashish that the Japs are forcing on the Chinese."</p>

  <p>He paused to make sure whether Andrew was listening, decided that he was,
  and continued:</p>

  <p>"Now I'll tell you about that woman. And by the way, don't give her opium
  unless you want hell in your lap. That woman was my gift to the charlatan who
  owns this village. It was a gift with strings to it. She's a whore of hell. I
  said whore. I don't mean prostitute. Prostitution implies at least a trace of
  intention to keep a bargain. You can't prostitute whoredom. Below the minus
  sign there's nothing."</p>

  <p>"You should know about that," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It has been my business to find out. She is only a brood bitch and
  no longer any good even for that. I had her sterilized. It's the boy I wish
  to speak of. He annoyed you because you are prissy. But did you study
  him?"</p>

  <p>Andrew thought about the boy. He didn't answer.</p>

  <p>"Did Elsa study him? What did she think?"</p>

  <p>"Her name is Mrs. Grayne," Andrew said pointedly. "Go on talking about
  your brat."</p>

  <p>The Sikh answered with barbed malice: "The boy is a bastard who happened
  to live! You are a lawyer, and you'll happen to die unless you use your
  brains. Do you remember a couple of young murderers&mdash;they were rich
  people's sons&mdash;they made the headlines in all the newspapers in the
  world about twenty years ago? Or are you too young to remember that? One of
  your famous American lawyers saved them from the electric chair. All the
  police authorities and psychologists in the world studied those two young
  criminals. The priests who spoke of devils weren't so blindly stupid as the
  self-styled scientists who prattled about behaviorism and environment and
  heredity and glands and God knows what else. There never was worse pile than
  they've talked and written about those two young perverts. Everyone seemed to
  miss the point, except me. This boy of mine is younger than they were. You
  wouldn't believe how young he is. Physically, mentally and biologically
  super-precocious. Those young Americans were amateurs. My boy Chet is the
  perfect criminal!"</p>

  <p>"You're too long-winded," said Andrew. "Time's almost up."</p>

  <p>"I'm telling you, and I'm in no hurry," the Sikh answered. "My
  accomplishment took years. Be patient. I have used that woman as an
  instrument, for a specific purpose. I trained her, after she left the woman's
  jail in Darjeeling, where she was imprisoned for contributing to the
  delinquency of minors&mdash;plural&mdash;many minors. She had made a business
  of it. She was refractory&mdash;difficult&mdash;willful. She had to be
  starved&mdash;whipped&mdash;disciplined. Finally I made her what she is now.
  It's her limit. There's no more there. She can go into a trance and reveal
  all secrets, though she herself can seldom understand what she reveals. As a
  medium she is ne plus ultra, if you know what that means. She is the ideal
  subject for hypnosis. No inhibitions, no moral restraints &mdash;no scruples!
  She can be made to do anything! Do you understand &mdash;anything!"</p>

  <p>He paused, stared at Andrew, at Elsa, then spoke with the pride of a
  street astronomer who owns a homemade telescope that shows the dark deeps of
  the Milky Way:</p>

  <p>"She was made to conceive, and to bring forth, and suckle, and wean, that
  boy, who&mdash;as I told you&mdash;is the perfect criminal! He is
  clairvoyant, clairaudient, hypnotic, a trance medium, a waking medium&mdash;
  a pervert, a homosexual&mdash;an intellectual, vicious in all imaginable
  ways, by all imaginable means. You couldn't possibly imagine how vicious he
  is; you haven't enough imagination. He has intelligently cynical and
  incorruptible contempt for anything and everything whatever except his own
  desires and my will. I control him. He will always obey me. I am his
  God."</p>

  <p>Elsa breathed quietly. Her eyes were closed and her hands were relaxed on
  the knobs of the chair-arms. Bompo Tsering was pop-eyed. He came forward and
  put fuel on the fire. The flame leaped and the ponies' eyes shone in the
  dark. Bulah Singh went on talking, attentively watching Elsa's face as if he
  doubted those closed eyes.</p>

  <p>"You two have probably talked with Nancy Strong about the Virgin Mary
  giving birth to Jesus. You'd be surprised how many criminals believe that
  yarn&mdash;I mean the immaculate conception part of it. They pretend not to.
  But they do. Hypnotize 'em and they confess what they believe. It was as a
  student of criminology that I was interested; you can't possibly understand
  any criminal without a deep study of comparative superstitions&mdash;which is
  to say religions. Nancy Strong, if I understood her correctly when she tried
  to convert me, believes that such purity of spiritual love inspired Mary the
  Mother of Jesus that she conceived and became the mother of the greatest
  spiritual hero the world has ever known. Is that your understanding of her
  thought about it?"</p>

  <p>"It's near enough," said Andrew. "But what are you driving at? Time's
  up."</p>

  <p>"I don't have to drive at anything," said Bulah Singh. "I'm telling you.
  All things, and all ideas, have opposites. The opposites are equal, each to
  each. Black&mdash;white. Plus&mdash;minus. Above&mdash;below. Good
  &mdash;evil. Light&mdash;dark. Spirit&mdash;matter. God&mdash;devil.
  Jesus&mdash;and my bastard son Chet. Chet's mother's thought, at his
  conception, was as free from what is known as virtue as if it had been
  surgically sterilized. She was under full hypnosis. She had been commanded to
  conceive the perfect devil in human form. And she obeyed."</p>

  <p>"Time's up," said Andrew, glancing at Elsa. He scowled, but his voice
  didn't betray emotion.</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh began to speak faster: "As I told you in Darjeeling, I and my
  cooperators mean to capture the infant Dalai Lama&mdash;the uncontaminated
  infant Dalai Lama&mdash;who is being raised as a saint, poor little devil! I
  did not tell you, because I trusted you no more then than now&mdash;and you
  might have betrayed me then, but you can't now&mdash;that we will substitute
  my son Chet, who is a genuine devil, for the infant Dalai Lama, who is only a
  tinhorn saint. Do you see the significance? Your Christian pope may take a
  back seat. We will control the world's thought at its source!"</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering whirled his prayer wheel. Elsa spoke as if at that moment
  waking from a deep sleep:</p>

  <p>"Andrew! Did you hear what he said?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. I heard him."</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh! What do you mean? What are you thinking of doing&mdash;to
  the other child&mdash;to the infant Lama?"</p>

  <p>The Sikh grinned: "Oh&mdash;as for that&mdash;you may have him&mdash; when
  I'm through. Did you happen to notice that Lepcha servant at Nancy Strong's?
  He'll be like that, only rather more so. He won't remember much. Yes, yes,
  you may have him. But of course if you don't care to help, you can't expect
  us to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You know what I mean." The Sikh snapped his fingers. "That useless infant
  means no more to me than Barcelona babies mean to General Franco and his
  bombers&mdash;or than the hungry Ukrainian babies meant to Stalin."</p>

  <p>"You said&mdash;if we don't care to help?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Take him or leave him. Save him or let him die."</p>

  <p>There came a pounding on the door&mdash;not very loud&mdash;not
  importunate. It was the pounding of someone who knew he could not be refused,
  so was in no special hurry.</p>

  <p>"Time now, anyway," said Andrew grimly. "We have reached no basis for an
  understanding, Bulah Singh."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, we have! You are a little stupid, that's all. I will explain it
  to you. I will make it quite clear."</p>

  <p>The pounding on the door resumed, a little louder. Andrew addressed Bompo
  Tsering:</p>

  <p>"Go and open that door. Let them enter, whoever they are."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering didn't like it. He obeyed slowly&mdash;slowly&mdash;
  plucking the arm of another Tibetan to come and keep him company.</p>

  <p>"It is this! It is this!" said Bulah Singh. "You, Andrew Gunning, have
  been chosen to help me because of your special ability. What you believe is
  your integrity is only frozen habit, but it will serve our purpose. You, Elsa
  &mdash;I beg pardon, of course I mean Mrs. Grayne!&mdash;you have been chosen
  because of your special faculties. I did not say talent. I said faculties.
  You can be developed, trained, and used. You shall be. You shall be allowed
  to reach Tom Grayne, since he is also necessary for our purpose."</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted loudly: "Bompo Tsering! Open that door! Let those
  people in!"</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh continued: "As a reward you two may save the precious infant
  from the kites and ravens. If you wish to, you may have him. That is a
  promise. And, as a spur to your compliance with the requirements that are
  about to be brought to your notice&mdash;you are guaranteed that Tom Grayne,
  and you yourselves and the infant Lama shall die in torment for the least
  infraction, mistake, or neglect to obey!&mdash;And now open that door!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch34"
     id="ch34">CHAPTER 34</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A dark procession entered, ushered by freezing wind that
  whirled the smoke and made the ponies restless. It was led by a hooded man
  with a lantern. He had been instructed. He knew what to do. He hung the
  lantern from a peg on one of the low roof beams and stood still beneath it
  with folded arms, about fifteen feet away from Andrew. The wavering shadows
  made him look like one of Torquemada's men. Two more, who also looked like
  phantom Dominicans, followed and stood behind him, facing the row of
  ponies.</p>

  <p>Andrew stood up, expecting the magician Lung-gom-pa. But the magician
  lingered unexplainably among armed brigands in the dark near the door; there
  was no doubt who he was, but he was only just visible&mdash;a looming,
  lurking, massive presence, furtive and secretive; a bell tinkled faintly when
  he moved. The man who came forward to meet Andrew was no Tibetan. His beard
  and the way he carried his head reminded Andrew of the portrait of Sir
  Richard Burton, in his copy of the famous forbidden pilgrimage to Mecca and
  Medina. But he also more than vaguely resembled Lenin of Russia. His eyes
  were larger and darker than Lenin's, but he had similar high cheek bones,
  some of Lenin's gestures, some of Lenin's rhinoceros-hided arrogance that
  couldn't imagine itself mistaken. He had Lenin's way of sticking his fist in
  his right-hand pocket. But on the whole he looked more like Sir Richard
  Burton, perhaps because of the Afghan turban, which suited him and made him
  look scholarly. He wore a long, well-fitting fur-lined overcoat. He wasn't
  nearly as tall as Andrew. He halted some paces away, so as not to have to
  look up.</p>

  <p>Andrew spoke abruptly, just to start something: "How do you do."</p>

  <p>Elsa turned to look. Andrew touched her shoulder. She looked away
  again.</p>

  <p>The man in the Afghan turban answered with what might be a smile, or it
  might have been the natural wryness of his mouth that twisted when he spoke:
  "How do you do."</p>

  <p>Two Tibetans emerged out of the shadows carrying a short heavy bench
  &mdash;set it down between Andrew and Bulah Singh, spread cushions on it, and
  withdrew. The door slammed shut. It grew suddenly warmer. The smoke ceased
  whirling and making the ponies snort. By that time there were not less than
  thirty people in the room, including Andrew's men, but most of them were in
  the dark at the far end. They were all silent. The only noticeable noise was
  when the ponies stamped and snorted. One squealed.</p>

  <p>"Are you Andrew Gunning?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"I came a long way to wait here for you. I am not an oriental, although my
  turban may have led you to think so. My name is Oliver Blessingwell."</p>

  <p>Andrew answered in a low voice: "You wish me to pretend to believe that?
  Is it your alias?"</p>

  <p>"Sir?"</p>

  <p>"Your real name," said Andrew, "is Major Hugo von Klaus. You were attached
  to the Turkish command in Jerusalem in 1915 with Djemal Pasha."</p>

  <p>"That is a long time ago," said the German.</p>

  <p>"You were transferred to the diplomatic service after the Armistice and
  went to Kabul. From there to China. Later to Japan. One of your occasional
  correspondents calls himself Ambrose St. Malo."</p>

  <p>Major von Klaus managed to disguise his annoyance, but the effort was
  noticeable. He smiled, but his smile was slow, it had to be forced. "You
  appear to be curiously well informed. Are you a medium? If so, that stuff,
  let me warn you, is far from reliable&mdash;especially in this land of tricky
  magicians."</p>

  <p>Andrew felt he had the upper hand and was resolved to keep it, masking his
  thought and not answering what he did not choose to answer. He had never
  unlearned the American habit of introducing people to each other. It served
  his purpose now. He half turned toward Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Since we know each other's real names, I'll introduce you to Mrs.
  Grayne."</p>

  <p>Major von Klaus looked incredulous: "Grayne? You said Mrs. Grayne? Am I
  mistaken? Is her name not Elsa Burbage?"</p>

  <p>"I told you her right name. Elsa, this is Major von Klaus. He's an
  orientalist. He should be famous."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh chuckled: "Isn't the right word notorious?"</p>

  <p>Major von Klaus ignored Bulah Singh. He bowed stiffly.</p>

  <p>"How do you do," said Elsa. "Won't you be seated?" She didn't smile. She
  was aware of Andrew's tenseness and of the fact that Andrew expected violence
  at any moment without previous warning.</p>

  <p>Von Klaus moved around Andrew, walking as if he wore tight military boots,
  although his feet were actually encased in comfortable felt. His head hung
  forward a little when he didn't remember to hold it upright, as if the
  turban, or else his brain, were too heavy. He sat down on the bench. A
  Tibetan menial approached from the shadows and wrapped a heavy woolen shawl
  around his shoulders. Bompo Tsering, feeling that Andrew needed an equivalent
  attention, came forward and put fuel on the fire. Major von Klaus observed
  Bompo Tsering, appeared to study him:</p>

  <p>"Your man?"</p>

  <p>"My foreman," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"And those others?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, those are my men."</p>

  <p>"Shall we excuse them? I would like a conversation with you."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Send your own men away and I'll dismiss mine."</p>

  <p>Andrew noticed a heavy ring on the middle finger of the German's right
  hand as he gestured to command privacy. That is the rarest thing in Tibet,
  but he was promptly obeyed. The three solemnities under the lantern retired
  backwards in token of almost religious respect. Andrew ordered Bompo Tsering
  away into the dark behind the ponies. The others followed Bompo Tsering.</p>

  <p>"I believe you've already met Bulah Singh," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>The German nodded. He glanced coldly at Bulah Singh but didn't speak. Then
  he studied Elsa, governing his face, muscle by muscle, until he had it set in
  a smile that would have passed muster, beyond footlights, as a symbol of the
  velvet glove on an iron hand. It was as diplomatic as the edge of a knife or
  the back of an axe.</p>

  <p>"I know all about you," he said pleasantly. "Have you enjoyed your journey
  thus far?"</p>

  <p>Elsa surprised them all, herself included. She enraged von Klaus. "If you
  know so much, why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh laughed. That provided the German with a scapegoat for his
  anger. He turned on the Sikh:</p>

  <p>"As for you," he said savagely, "I warned you that the slightest&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh interrupted. "Yes, and I warned you! Must I say it in German?
  There's no one but Andrew Gunning who can manage the girl. And there's no one
  but me who can deal with him. If you insist on acting like one of Hitler's
  bullies, we'll all have to shoot each other to avoid being tortured to
  death."</p>

  <p>Von Klaus scowled at him: "Silence, you clown!"</p>

  <p>"You go to hell," said the Sikh.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well." The German tugged at his beard with his left hand. His
  right tapped at his overcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh has been disarmed," Andrew remarked quietly. "Shooting him
  would be murder. I forbid it."</p>

  <p>The German pretended not to have heard the word "forbid." He peered toward
  the door. "Yes. Murder is unpleasant. We'll let Lung-gom-pa deal with
  him."</p>

  <p>"No," said Andrew. "I protect Bulah Singh. I told him he could come to me,
  day or night."</p>

  <p>"He put it in writing," the Sikh added. His eyes blazed with excitement.
  "I have it here in my pocket."</p>

  <p>The German controlled his anger with an effort. "Are you aware," he asked
  Andrew, "that this Schweinehund* Bulah Singh has been betraying you right and
  left for the last several months?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Schweinehund!</i> (German expletive)&mdash;Pig!
  Annotator]</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Andrew, "I know all about him."</p>

  <p>"Did you know he has offered for sale this girl whom you introduced to me
  just now as Mrs. Grayne? You said Grayne, didn't you? I happen to know her
  name is Elsa Burbage." He let a sneer into his voice. "Why not call her Mrs.
  Andrew Gunning?"</p>

  <p>"Suppose you try it just once and see what happens," Andrew suggested.
  "Mrs. Grayne needs no character reference from me. But she gets no gratuitous
  insults while I'm around. Are those your own teeth?"</p>

  <p>"Tsch-tsch! We are getting nowhere," said the German. "We are wasting
  time. Let us send this Sikh policeman away."</p>

  <p>"He can't walk."</p>

  <p>"He can be carried."</p>

  <p>"No. He stays here. I won't have him tortured. I don't trust him. But I
  don't trust you either."</p>

  <p>"Gunning," said Bulah Singh, "tell your man Bompo Tsering to give me back
  my automatic. Then you and I can control this situation."</p>

  <p>"I control it now," Andrew answered. "I don't need your help, or your
  advice. Sit still and don't interrupt."</p>

  <p>The German tried to be tactful: "Come now! Come now! Let us all talk
  sensibly!"</p>

  <p>"About opium?" Andrew asked. He wasn't trying to be tactful, he was just
  plain belligerent.</p>

  <p>"Yes, among other things. Why not? Let us speak of the opium first"</p>

  <p>"Okay. Talk," said Andrew. "But let me warn you. Among other reasons, I
  left America because I didn't choose to defend in court a son of a bitch
  who'd been peddling drugs. I could have got him off. I wouldn't. Now you've a
  line on my point of view, so spill the beans."</p>

  <p>"Can't we be polite to each other? I wish to speak impersonally," said the
  German.</p>

  <p>"Can't be done," said Andrew. "The hell with that boloney. I'm one person.
  You're another. I've a personal opinion of you that 'ud file the rough off
  gray iron."</p>

  <p>"But Gott im Himmel,* what do you know about me?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Gott im Himmel</i> (German)&mdash;God in Heaven!
  Annotator. ]</p>

  <p>Suddenly Andrew knew that he no longer knew in any ordinary meaning of the
  word. He hadn't been guessing. He had seen. Now he could no longer see. Less
  than a second ago he had seen clearly that Major von Klaus intended to become
  Bulah Singh's substitute&mdash;to get rid of Bulah Singh, by turning him over
  to Lung-gom-pa, and to come in his place on the expedition. He still knew it,
  because he had seen and remembered. But it tongue-tied him for the moment to
  realize he had no evidence. Von Klaus laughed, letting Andrew know that he
  understood Andrew's difficulty. Then he tried to smile pleasantly, offering a
  lie that should serve like oil on troubled water; but a scar twisted his lips
  so that the smile passed through a sneer and out again
  &mdash;twice&mdash;going and coming.</p>

  <p>"Andrew Gunning," he said, "don't you think that perhaps the altitude, and
  exhaustion, and the natural emotion due to a sensation of danger, may have
  unsteadied your thought?"</p>

  <p>Andrew recognized the motive behind the question. "I'm thinking about you
  and this opium that I'm sitting on," he answered. "My thought's steady
  enough. It isn't tricky either. I'm not a diplomat."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh thrust straight ahead into that opening. "You fool!" he said
  to the German. "You conceited ignoramus! Do you think Gunning can't see
  through such puerile attempts to steal his confidence? I told you at the gate
  &mdash;he resisted all my attempts to hypnotize him. I can't read his
  thought, except when he's off guard, and that's rarely. So I'm damned if you
  can with your stodgy German method. Compared to me, you're a neophyte&mdash;
  a Lehrling!* Stop wasting time!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Lehrling</i> (German)&mdash;an apprentice.
  Annotator. ]</p>

  <p>"I will speak to the lady," von Klaus answered. A look of disciplined
  cunning stole over his face. Like many and many a middle-aged diplomat he
  evidently thought himself a charmer of women when he could give his mind to
  it. But Elsa surprised him again:</p>

  <p>"Please don't!" she exclaimed. "Please don't! I'm busy!"</p>

  <p>Her head was resting on the canvas chair-back. Her eyes were shut; the
  lids looked dark blue in the shadow of leaping firelight. Von Klaus leaned
  eagerly toward her.</p>

  <p>"Can she be conscious on two planes! Elsa! Tell what you see! I command
  you! Tell what you see!"</p>

  <p>Andrew growled at him: "You keep away! Do you hear! Keep your
  distance!"</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh sneered: "She won't tell you! There's only one person she will
  tell. Von Klaus, you'd better take a back seat and leave this to me."</p>

  <p>Von Klaus, showing his aging teeth through scarred lips, stared at Elsa
  and then at Andrew. Andrew was seeing again&mdash;seeing what Elsa saw. First
  he saw the Lama Gombaria in his sky-high Sikkim monastery. But for a moment
  he looked like Morgan Lewis&mdash;then it wasn't Lewis, it was Nancy Strong,
  on a chair at someone's bedside. He supposed that was Father Patrick, at the
  Jesuit Mission; there was a crucifix on the wall. Nancy Strong looked
  up&mdash;straight at Andrew&mdash;and grew larger&mdash;nearer&mdash;
  changing as she came. She grew hideous. He didn't recognize her, until
  suddenly he remembered the bullet-broken photograph of the Ringding Gelong
  Lama Lobsang Pun&mdash;Old Ugly-face. It was he. The face became a maze of
  wrinkles, nodded. The nose like an owl's beak twitched. Pure gold, like the
  background of a Russian icon only brighter than the sun, began to frame the
  face, until it changed and for a fragment of a second became splendid. Then
  it smiled and was gone.</p>

  <p>"They are both of them seeing the man whom we want," remarked Bulah Singh
  in a voice so harsh that it creaked. "The man only sees him. The girl is
  talking with him!"</p>

  <p>The German's voice was as quiet and as earnestly kind as if he were
  coaxing a child: "Tell what you see! Tell what he said! Elsa! I am your
  friend! You tell me!"</p>

  <p>Elsa sat upright suddenly. She and Andrew looked at each other,
  questioning. Andrew nodded. Elsa smiled happily.</p>

  <p>"Andrew! You saw? You did see?"</p>

  <p>Andrew nodded again: "Seemed to me that he gave us the green light."</p>

  <p>"You believe it!"</p>

  <p>Andrew nodded. "But I never believe what I believe," he added. "I've got
  to know. How does one find out?"</p>

  <p>A bell tinkled, in the dark near the wall at the far end. Something
  rattled. Bompo Tsering howled on a high note. He and all Andrew's Tibetans
  knelt and laid their foreheads on the floor. The bell tinkled again, in time
  to slow footsteps, coming. Gradually, developing like a photographic image on
  a film, the black magician Lung-gom-pa, the ruler of the village, moved
  forward toward the firelight. He seemed almost to float on air,
  effortless.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch35"
     id="ch35">CHAPTER 35</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Lung-gom-pa the magician approached slowly, with solemn
  dignity. Thought moved as swiftly as light. The solemnity made no impression
  on Andrew. The dignity did. The handsome, professional mystery man&mdash;his
  high-cheeked, slant-eyed, dark face reddened by the firelight&mdash;stared at
  Andrew, disguising thought with experienced skill. There was a faint smile on
  his lips. It was a lie. But it looked good. It suggested scorn so insolent,
  and secret knowledge so lofty and sure, that there was no need to let lower
  emotions enter in. He could afford, said the smile, that rare gift,
  inscrutable patience. But it wasn't patience. It was suspicion, on the horns
  of a dilemma that the magician did not understand.</p>

  <p>Neither did Andrew understand it. But he had studied juries in Ohio,
  learning to choose and reject by intuition. And he had learned to watch
  witnesses. He had become very skillful at detecting a lie and its motive. He
  was no more deceived by the magician's smile than he was awed by the long
  necklace of miniature skulls carved from human bone, strung on human
  sinew.</p>

  <p>He observed the magician's cunning eyes, that saw cunning where none was.
  Asceticism, that had made the man lean, couldn't hide the sensuous greed on
  nose and lips. It couldn't mask his baffled yearning for the luxury of more,
  and more secret power. Barring toughness of skin, color, and some pockmarks,
  Andrew had seen dozens of faces like that one&mdash;politicians' faces
  &mdash;white faces of bosses and men of affairs&mdash;near enough like it,
  posing as resolute, patient, farseeing, spiritually informed and very worldly
  wise&mdash;all phonies. He remembered, for instance, an unfrocked priest
  &mdash;</p>

  <p>That wouldn't do! Thought was going wandering along tangential planes of
  memory. He had to bring himself back with a jerk. The wandering was partly
  Elsa's doing. But he hadn't time to nurse resentment, although he felt it.
  Elsa sat with the palms of her hands cupped on the knobs of the chair-arms
  and her head resting on the canvas back. Her eyes weren't quite closed. Her
  lips, too, were slightly parted. She was conscious and, he felt sure of it,
  unafraid. She was inviting the state of consciousness that formerly she
  loathed. It was there. Like a high voltage current of electricity, it set up
  a kind of induced awareness in Andrew. Assurance overflowed from her and
  reached him, so that he knew he owed to her at least some of his own
  self-confidence. He felt no fear of doing the wrong thing&mdash;of saying the
  wrong word. But he knew, without knowing how he knew, that Bulah Singh, with
  his back to the wall, was making mental experiments to produce a crisis in
  which to snatch an opportune advantage for himself. The air was loaded with
  Bulah Singh's anarchic effort. All the Tibetans in the room, including
  Andrew's own men, were in a state of expectant terror, breathing through
  their noses. Their bets were on Lung-gom-pa and his magic.</p>

  <p>The German von Klaus was less easy to understand. But there were sudden
  true glimpses of him also. Elsa's mind became a momentary mirror, in which
  the man himself betrayed himself&mdash;not consciously afraid, but pseudo-
  philosophically justifying boldness by recalling previous success. Heil
  Hitler! There were memory glimpses of von Klaus in uniform&mdash;snatches of
  visions of clever von Klaus the diplomat, prevailing by treachery over fools
  who kept faith and perished on the hooks of an ideal. His drilled brain was
  crowded with instances preserved like pickled specimens in realistic
  scorn.</p>

  <p>So there was a kind of war going on in the realm of thought, all at cross-
  purposes, in which the black magician was likely to snatch the upper hand. It
  was his village. He owned it. He was used to obedience, awe, if not respect.
  Why shouldn't he use violence to regain "face" that he had evidently lost to
  von Klaus? Somehow the German must have tricked him into submission&mdash;
  promising, no doubt, wonderful things. But where were the things? An unkept
  or a postponed promise is humiliating, and humiliation stings. He was cunning
  enough to pretend an indignation that he did not feel. All despots use that
  expedient. He could work himself up into screaming hysteria. And in that mood
  he could kill. He was half minded to do it. In his eyes was fear of being
  understood&mdash;fear of being found out. Fear, and cruelty.</p>

  <p>"Leave him to me!" von Klaus whispered. "I understand him."</p>

  <p>The sensation of time returned then. It was a shock: two simultaneous
  states of consciousness&mdash;of thought and of action&mdash;of being and of
  doing; the one timeless, the other bound and limited by time and space.
  Thought took no more time than firelight needed leaping from eye to eye. And
  now Andrew did feel panic. He was afraid of that dual consciousness. One
  thing or the other! He chose! He struck so swiftly for his self-control that
  Elsa sat bolt upright, scared, as if something hit her. His spastic plunge
  back to the concrete realm of things made Bulah Singh breathe sibilantly
  through his teeth. The magician Lung-gom-pa, whose false name falsely claimed
  that he could walk without wings on the empty air, stared&mdash;stared hard;
  the magician feared concrete reality more than Andrew dreaded swamps of
  abstract dreaming. The magician glanced from Andrew&mdash;to von Klaus
  &mdash;to Elsa&mdash;back to Andrew. Andrew spoke, in English, aiming his
  words at Elsa. It was an ultimatum to Lung-gom-pa. But to her also, although
  he didn't look at her.</p>

  <p>"Silence! Don't risk speech until you know my will!"</p>

  <p>Strange words. Elsa translated them, slowly, accurately. The magician
  thrust out his lower lip in perplexity. It was like an animal's. He flicked
  his rosary of skulls. Von Klaus whispered:</p>

  <p>"Sind Sie wahnsinnig? Wenn Sie*&mdash;I mean, if you offend him, you undo
  all that I did! He will&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* "Are you crazy? If you&mdash;" Annotator. ]</p>

  <p>Andrew ignored von Klaus. It was deliberate. He was playing a no-trump
  hand for every point it held, and one point was to snub and irritate the
  German. So he kept his eyes on Lung-gom-pa. His own were calm, with the
  assumed indifference that sometimes angers, always arouses weakness to
  declare itself. Unhurried, speaking without emphasis, he kept the
  initiative:</p>

  <p>"I intend to leave with you some ponies I no longer need. But where are
  the yaks you promised? Where are the sheep?"</p>

  <p>Elsa repeated the words in Tibetan. The magician stared, astonished. Von
  Klaus whispered:</p>

  <p>"Teufelszeug!* Spoiling my influence? See here, you! Why didn't you warn
  me you have had communication with him!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Teufelszeug</i> (German)&mdash;devil's work,
  deviltry. Annotator. ]</p>

  <p>Andrew again ignored von Klaus. Without giving the magician time to
  answer, subtly he suggested to him how to save face:</p>

  <p>"If you should speak to me before all these witnesses, how will you
  justify your own conduct? How will you explain why you have housed us in a
  shed with the animals? Why did you send your underlings to seize my baggage?
  If I had let them take the bag that I sit on, your people would have mocked
  you when they saw its contents. But I saved you from that."</p>

  <p>He paused to let Elsa translate. She did it low-voiced. Tibetan faces
  craned forward from the shadows, but none could catch the words. The magician
  stared at Elsa, then at Bula Singh, then at Andrew.</p>

  <p>Von Klaus whispered: "You don't understand these people! There's no use
  lying about the contents of a bag that he can open when he chooses! He knows
  what's in it!"</p>

  <p>"That's more than you know," Andrew retorted.</p>

  <p>The magician was speaking to Elsa. Von Klaus suddenly flew into a rage,
  grabbed Andrew's arm and ground out words like chopped meat:</p>

  <p>"Fool! Ten thousand miles in three months I have come for what that bag
  contains! Three weeks I have waited in this stinking village! Don't waste
  lies on me! Don't you know what's in it?"</p>

  <p>Andrew shook him off roughly and thrust him aside, timing the insult so
  that the magician saw. He turned to Elsa:</p>

  <p>"What does he say?"</p>

  <p>"He invites us to his house. But he says we should bring the bag you're
  sitting on. He asks, shall his men carry it."</p>

  <p>"Tell him no. My man shall bring it."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I think you're&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew's cold smile interrupted her. She almost bit a word in two,
  reddening, recognizing the end of Andrew's patience. He wasn't asking advice.
  He was giving orders.</p>

  <p>"Kindly tell him&mdash;" the word "kindly" cut. It was the cold veneer on
  anger. "Kindly tell him we'll leave Bulah Singh with my man Bompo Tsering.
  Say this German may come with us. The magician is to order all his own
  followers out of the shed. They're to stay out until daylight."</p>

  <p>Elsa turned to interpret. Again von Klaus seized Andrew's arm.</p>

  <p>"Andrew Gunning, if you think you can treat me like this, I can assure
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, heil Hitler!"</p>

  <p>Andrew shoved him away and stood between him and Lung-gom-pa, who was
  listening to Elsa. The magician was hardly believing his own ears&mdash;
  hardly believing that a white woman could talk such fluent Tibetan. Could she
  be white? Was she a devil in human form?&mdash;He hardly believed that even
  devils from the unknown world beyond the mountains could dare to order him
  around as this girl was doing. Was she really translating Andrew's words? Or
  &mdash;</p>

  <p>Andrew beckoned Bompo Tsering. He came in a hurry, all eyes and ears,
  craving gossip, explanations, confidences. What he got was commands:</p>

  <p>"Watch Bulah Singh. Give him blankets. Let him sleep if he pleases. But
  guard him closely. Answer no questions. All but one of you are to wait here
  until further orders. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"My understanding. My obeying."</p>

  <p>"Select one of our men who knows no English. Pick the stupidest man. Tell
  him to pick up this bag I've been sitting on and come with me and the German
  and Lady Elsa."</p>

  <p>"That bag being heavy, better my doing it."</p>

  <p>"Do as I tell you!"</p>

  <p>Von Klaus ceased protesting. It was useless. In an effort to steal a march
  on Andrew he hurried after Lung-gom-pa, who strode out of the shed without
  saying a word. Andrew waited with Elsa until all the magician's men had
  disappeared into the night, following their master. Then he repeated his
  orders to Bompo Tsering, and tossed one crumb of comfort to Bulah Singh:</p>

  <p>"I've no bargain with you! But if you make no trouble for me behind my
  back, you're likely to regret it less than if you act up! Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the Sikh answered. "As one man to another, you may go to hell. If I
  could ditch you I'd love it. But that German will do you in. If he doesn't
  the magician will. You'll be eaten by dogs by and by. I wish you joy of
  it."</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed and turned his back, calling over his shoulder to Bompo
  Tsering to lock the door on the inside. He liked Bulah Singh better in that
  mood than in any other. It was at least honest. Outside the door, in the
  dark, he waited until he heard Bompo Tsering shoot the heavy bolt on the
  inside. Then he glanced upward, once, briefly, at the starlit sky and strode
  forward through stinking gloom, over frozen filth, to where a lantern glowed
  in the dim near distance. Elsa kept step with him.</p>

  <p>"Andrew."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Von Klaus is trying to persuade Lung-gom-pa that we're too treacherous to
  be let live."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I know. Plastering us with his own paint. That's the mark of the
  beast. They all do it. We'll feel his teeth presently."</p>

  <p>Elsa detected his irritation. "Oh well&mdash;as long as you know."</p>

  <p>"Our one chance," he said, "is to be sudden, surprising, unexpected."</p>

  <p>He would have liked to ask Elsa to let him alone. He was more than ever
  uneasy about her clairvoyance. There was something contagious in it. It
  seemed likely to transmute his own strength of decision into something
  feminine that had no edges and that merely let things happen. But he could
  think of no phrase that wouldn't hurt. He had a vaguely grim foreboding that
  she was going to be hurt soon and badly. He laid his hand on her shoulder,
  guiding her through the dark.</p>

  <p>"Andrew.&mdash;Did Lung-gom-pa really promise yaks and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No. I said that to puzzle him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think it did."</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and to rattle von Klaus."</p>

  <p>"It made von Klaus furious. Now he thinks we are here on purpose to
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I may have to break von Klaus, or he'll break us. But it's true we need
  yaks and sheep, from here on."</p>

  <p>"From here on? If!" said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"You? Talking about if? Can't you see ahead?"</p>

  <p>"Not now. I see nothing now. Only that awful mother of the brat! I see her
  eyes in the dark&mdash;and the boy's eyes!"</p>

  <p>Andrew answered calmly: "I will shoot her if she butts in."</p>

  <p>"Andrew&mdash;don't start things!"</p>

  <p>"They're already started. Watch that lantern and walk forward. I won't let
  you fall. Here&mdash;take my arm. There, is that better?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks&mdash;Andrew! We're in deadly danger&mdash;from all around
  &mdash;all sides&mdash;everyone."</p>

  <p>"I know."</p>

  <p>"Even Bompo Tsering."</p>

  <p>"Watch your step now. There's a hole here&mdash;a bad one."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you a flashlight?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But the light might make someone's aim too easy. Hang on to me.
  We're pretty near now."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I feel certain von Klaus has a trap that he means to spring on
  us.&mdash;Oh! Look! What's that? Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"That's our own man, carrying my bag, waiting for us in the shadow."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, is the bag really full of opium?"</p>

  <p>"They all think it is."</p>

  <p>"But is it?"</p>

  <p>"See here." He had almost lost patience. "What was I doing, that night in
  the pass, on this side of the summit&mdash;that last night, before we knew
  Bulah Singh was behind us?"</p>

  <p>"You said&mdash;you redistributed&mdash;a load&mdash;to save the ponies.
  Didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"I dumped the opium."</p>

  <p>"You knew it was in the bag? You knew it then?"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"I didn't. Andrew, how did you find out? You hadn't opened that bag! Could
  you see? Were you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I used my eyes. I had to look like hell the other way while the Sikkim
  trader pulled the trick. There had to be some good reason why he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Andrew! What'll these people do when they discover we haven't got their
  opium?"</p>

  <p>"Leave that to me."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was nothing else for it. He halted suddenly, almost within the
  light-zone of the lantern. He turned, faced, met her eyes. They could just
  see each other.</p>

  <p>"Will you do me a favor?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Andrew. What do you wish me to do? What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Pipe down. That's all. Cut that hysterical stuff. Leave this to me."</p>

  <p>"But, Andrew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether I could say it plainer!&mdash;How'll this do: are you
  and I friends? Then for God's sake act friendly and let me do my own
  thinking!"</p>

  <p>She was silent.</p>

  <p>He spoke more gently: "I said we're friends. I mean it. Each do our own
  thinking. Now then&mdash;through that narrow door as if we owned the place
  &mdash;leave the show-down to me!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch36"
     id="ch36">CHAPTER 36</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Thought took no time; agony no space. Elsa took four steps
  forward, toward the lamplit door of the magician's dwelling. Andrew's left
  hand pressed her shoulder blades. His right hand gripped an automatic inside
  his overcoat. Within the compass of four strides, a whole world
  changed&mdash;a universe! A state of consciousness, in which all universes
  lived because there is nowhere else for them, became a dismal wilderness.
  There is no pain like disillusion. Faith had failed. Cut that hysterical
  stuff! Andrew's hand on her back was meant to reassure! Whom? Of what? There
  was nothing left.</p>

  <p>Four steps forward&mdash;toward a lamplit door, over frozen filth, amid
  the buttery reek of almost invisible Tibetans who crowded the dark alley.
  There was a sound of frozen leather rubbing against leather, and of rifle
  swivels, and of hard breathing. There were glimpses of eyes that craved and
  expected presently to see victims slowly done to death. Those watchers knew
  their magician&mdash;knew what to expect, what to demand of him. Like life
  itself, he would amuse himself; but he would presently pass judgment and
  impose death, for his own importance and their pleasure. Then the watchers
  would feel for a while like their imagined old deathless gods of Tibet, who
  await the end of the day of Buddha and the coming of the new cruel night of
  Bon. Cruel gods. Cruelty&mdash;the delicious dreadful stuff that flatters
  slaves and lends authority to tyrants, who are slaves' high priests. Cruelty!
  The passion distinguishing man from beast&mdash;since only man loves,
  invents, applies, enjoys cruelty. Man, the creator and image of all the
  gods!</p>

  <p>First they'd see bleached terror in the victims' eyes, artfully increased
  &mdash;the hope encouraged for a moment, teased, falsely fed&mdash;
  contemptuously mocked and killed. Then presently, the horror of humiliation
  &mdash;the lewd stripping&mdash;the gloating and laughter. Last, the
  ingenious, traditional, physical torture. All torture is traditional. Elsa
  had seen some of it. She had seen a Tibetan woman half beaten to death and
  then pegged out hand and foot, naked to frost and sun, to die of thirst. She
  knew what those eyes in the dark expected, gloated for&mdash;nakedness,
  ritual, lechery, blood. She and Andrew were to be sacrificed like bulls in a
  Spanish ring; like Franco's, Hitler's, Mussolini's, Stalin's prisoners; like
  martyrs condemned by holy church and given to be burned by creatures of the
  lower law.</p>

  <p>There would be nothing new about it. Sickening. But not new. Bestial, but
  no worse than the fate of hundreds and thousands of men and women who wage
  wars for the devils who die in bed. It would be only physical. It couldn't
  hurt worse than Andrew's snub&mdash;than the politeness of Andrew's hand
  between her shoulder blades. It would be a different pain, that was all.</p>

  <p>Four steps forward&mdash;alone. Now utterly alone. Andrew had understood
  her. He had seen her soul, and she his. But Andrew had turned, gone,
  withdrawn to a polite, cold distance. The stab of a knife in her heart would
  have felt less cruel. A "great gulf fixed" had revealed itself, wide between
  her and the only one friend she had ever known. It was like a headlong fall
  from heaven into hell. Never&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;never again would
  she reach for Andrew's soul to share her own soul's overflow! Hers overflowed
  no longer! It had died, that instant, and all comfort with it, as the buds
  die in a chill wind. Dead&mdash;dead&mdash;dead&mdash;dead. Disillusioned.
  Andrew's hand between her shoulder blades. In the dark. Never, never, never,
  never! Nancy's stuff was&mdash;</p>

  <p>Suddenly she saw Nancy!&mdash;Nancy's fireside, in Darjeeling! And the
  cat&mdash;why the cat?&mdash;Then Lobsang Pun's broken photograph&mdash; the
  Jesuit Mission&mdash;Gombaria&mdash;the rock-hewn chamber of initiation!
  Reality! Timeless! Spaceless! Between the fourth step, and the fifth on to
  the threshold of the black magician's dwelling, she lived an
  eternity&mdash;saw, felt, experienced again the vision of Old Ugly-face,
  golden, as old as the world, and as young as new morning not yet risen.
  Blasphemy died before it reached her lips. She heard other words:</p>

  <p class="poem">"The Lord is my shepherd,<br>
  I shall not want&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Nancy's voice? Her own? Lobsang Pun's? Andrew's? It couldn't be Andrew's!
  Hers? Her heart was in her throat. She hadn't spoken. She couldn't have. Her
  senses failed, reeling in their own sensation. Had she fallen? Had she died?
  No&mdash;Andrew's arm was around her. She was being carried&mdash;forward
  into the dark. She was no longer afraid. But it wasn't fearlessness, it was
  something positive. It was a warming overwhelming faith. It flowed upon her,
  until she felt like drowning now in floods of strength, not weakness. Whose
  strength? Surely not hers!</p>

  <p>After an eternity that knew no time, she found herself seated on Andrew's
  bag, with her back to the wall of a square room. There was reddish light from
  a charcoal brazier, but there were also two oil lanterns on the floor.
  Andrew's porter&mdash;the big, stupid lad who knew no English&mdash; squatted
  near her, nine parts terrified, one part curious, slobber drooling from his
  lips, his fingers clutching a charm against magic. Andrew's back was
  blood-red in the brazier light. He faced von Klaus. The German's back was
  toward an inner door, that was guarded by two flat-faced Tibetans who loafed
  on their rifles, the butts resting on their heavy, fur-lined boots. There
  were two other men in the room, both Tibetans, facing each other, seated on
  cushions against opposite walls. One was the spectacled man who had first
  demanded Andrew's bag; he looked angry and humiliated. The other, too, was an
  educated-looking person but of much more powerful physique. There were
  paintings of hell on the walls, very well painted; they looked like plunder
  from a monastery. On the inner door there was pictured a cross-eyed woman
  with naked breasts, whose protruding tongue was a forked flame.</p>

  <p>Von Klaus scowled at Andrew. It was like an ancient Chinese battle
  picture, each opponent striving to outface the other with mental power,
  before condescending to such weapons as mere murderers use. Andrew was
  smiling; he didn't seem so strained as the German. It suddenly dawned on Elsa
  that Andrew's thought reached higher than her own. It was more true, less
  scattered, it had purpose! She watched, listened, spell-bound. The German
  spoke first:</p>

  <p>"Shoot! But if you do, you're done for. I was here first. I dealt the
  cards."</p>

  <p>Andrew answered in a level voice: "If I find you're worth killing, I'll do
  it. I won't wait for your permission."</p>

  <p>The German jerked his head in the direction of a steel bear trap. It hung
  from a heavy chain on a wall. All the Tibetans smiled.</p>

  <p>"I intended," said the German, "to employ you, at good pay. You'd be no
  good with that thing snapped on to your ankle. Please yourself. This
  so-called magician Lung-gom-pa will let you continue your journey, in my
  service, under my direction, if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If what?"</p>

  <p>Von Klaus glanced at Elsa. "If I demand it. But I require a hostage for
  your behavior. That is simple enough. Leave her here."</p>

  <p>He paused, expecting a retort. But Andrew waited for him to continue. Elsa
  suddenly saw Bulah Singh's face as clearly as if he were there in the room.
  It was the German's lips that moved, but it might almost be Bulah Singh's
  voice that continued:</p>

  <p>"She will be well treated. We won't need her. She would be in the way. We
  will take with us that other woman and her child."</p>

  <p>"You didn't think of that," said Andrew. He glanced slowly around the
  room.</p>

  <p>The German, still watching Elsa's face, retorted: "Never mind who first
  thought of it. Good plans have many makers. The point is organization&mdash;
  cooperation. Agree! Then we will talk&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted: "You'll talk now. Go and sit down&mdash;on that
  cushion beside the wall&mdash;that one&mdash;over there&mdash;near the man in
  spectacles."</p>

  <p>Beneath his beard the German's face muscles hardened. His nostrils
  narrowed. "I will stand&mdash;here."</p>

  <p>"Go and sit on that cushion. I won't warn you again."</p>

  <p>The man in spectacles coughed suddenly. Von Klaus turned to appeal to him.
  But with the side of his eye he noticed Andrew's left fist. He shrugged his
  shoulders&mdash;went and sat down. From then on he had to look up to Andrew.
  The floor is not an easy position from which to impose one's will. "Sit
  beside me," he suggested. "There is room." He patted the wide cushion.</p>

  <p>"Give me your weapons," Andrew answered, observing that the Tibetans
  smiled. It was even possible that they understood some English.</p>

  <p>Von Klaus moved both hands simultaneously to divide Andrew's attention. He
  acted the ancient trick rather well, but he underestimated Andrew's
  quickness. He was too academic. He knew the rules too well. One could see the
  trick coming. Andrew kicked his wrist. The Luger went off inside his
  overcoat. The bullet missed Elsa by not much margin&mdash;buried itself in
  the wall, in the dry mud between two lumps of rough-hewn masonry. The German
  yelped. He was in real pain:</p>

  <p>"Blast you! You broke my wrist!"</p>

  <p>"Swell. If you move, I'll kick it again."</p>

  <p>The man in spectacles seemed to be the senior Tibetan in the room. Andrew
  beckoned him. But he was either in disgrace, or afraid, or unfriendly; he
  pretended not to understand. Instead, one of the inner door guards came,
  smiling. He certainly did understand. He leaned over von Klaus, searched him
  with quick professional skill, removed a Luger and one reload, stowed them in
  his bokkus and smiled at Andrew. Then he held out his right hand.</p>

  <p>Von Klaus sneered through shut teeth: "Now you've done it! This is the end
  of us all&mdash;and it's your fault!"</p>

  <p>The Tibetan door guard made a threatening gesture toward the bear trap. He
  made signs to Andrew to surrender his pistol.</p>

  <p>"You blundering idiot!" said the German. "Schafskopf!*"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Schafskopf!</i> (German expletive)&mdash;you idiot!
  (literally, "sheep's head." Annotator. ]</p>

  <p>Andrew stepped backward, two paces, half turning his head. He raised his
  voice a trifle but spoke calmly:</p>

  <p>"Elsa."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Andrew."</p>

  <p>"It's getting hot. If it gets too hot, keep quite still, so that I can
  kill you with the first shot."</p>

  <p>Timeless, spaceless, instantaneous experience poured into Elsa's
  consciousness. She knew, suddenly, once and for all that death was nothing to
  be feared. But she knew more. She knew terribly more. The swift thought of
  Andrew's bullet was a physical sensation, sweet and strong, like being kissed
  between the breasts. She almost fainted of it. No act of will, but Reality,
  like light in the dark and life in death, forced her to yearn, with her whole
  being, to be slain by Andrew. So she knew she loved him, and knew there is no
  death. Her breast thrilled naked to his bullet. Loving-kindness outflowed
  from her to him. But she governed herself. She answered in a rather hard
  voice:</p>

  <p>"Very well, Andrew."</p>

  <p>He turned his back. For a moment she lowered her head, crossing her hands
  on her breast, steeling herself, to keep her new secret hidden. It was so
  truly new that it bewildered her. She hadn't known it yet ten seconds. They
  were ten eternities. She had believed she and Andrew were friends, just good
  friends. But Andrew had spoken ten words, and her heart had melted. O God.
  Never, never and forever should Andrew know she loved him. He didn't love
  her. Why should he? Generosity might make him say he did, if she let him
  guess her secret. Never, never.</p>

  <p class="poem">"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done.</p>

  <p>"O God, have I the strength to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew spoke suddenly, mispronouncing Tibetan: "Go back to your post at
  the door!"</p>

  <p>The Tibetan door guard hesitated. He glanced again at the bear trap on the
  wall.</p>

  <p>Von Klaus spoke, in German: "For God's sake, man, give him your pistol
  before he summons help. You can't do anything. If you shoot him, there are
  fifty worse ones outside! They'll put us both together into that trap. Then
  they'll turn Bulah Singh's woman loose on us! Can't you guess
  what&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted, not taking his eyes off the Tibetan's: "Elsa!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Andrew."</p>

  <p>"In case I have to shoot you, good-bye."</p>

  <p>She didn't answer. If there isn't death, there's no good-bye, so why
  pretend? She watched him. By some almost invisible trick of eye or hand he
  led the Tibetan's attention to his left fist. It was at about the level of
  his waist, ready for a pile-driver blow. The Tibetan saw it and smiled and
  backed away&mdash;all the way back to the door, where he stood at ill-drilled
  attention beside his comrade, beaten for the time being. Andrew took no more
  notice of him; he turned on von Klaus:</p>

  <p>"Now your turn. Talk."</p>

  <p>The German sat belligerently silent. Elsa tried to be clairvoyant, to be a
  mirror of the German's thought for Andrew to read. Suddenly she remembered:
  Andrew had forbidden! She mustn't!&mdash;had sworn she wouldn't! Each do our
  own thinking. Leave this to me! She tried then, loyally, with all her might,
  to be a numb, dumb witness and let Andrew play his hand uninterfered with. It
  was too late. She was seeing&mdash;seeing. She saw the red-shot bronze of the
  German's aura, like a beast's at bay, angry and cunning. She saw the
  desperate steely gray of Andrew's fear to do wrong and the brilliance of his
  resolution to do right. He was divided against himself. But she remembered
  his motto, on the book-plate in his copy of Paradise Lost: Facias rem.*
  Andrew would not do nothing.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Facias rem</i>&mdash;Achieve your goal. Presumably
  a fragment of the following passage in Horace's <a href=
  "http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/horace/epist1.shtml"><i>Epistulae I</i>
  (Letters I)</a>, Lines 65-66: <i>"Rem facias, rem si possis, recte, si non,
  quocumque modo, rem"</i>, which is usually translated as "Make money. Make
  money fairly if you can; but if not, make money any way possible. However,
  <i>facias rem</i> may also be interpreted as an exhortation to achieve one's
  goal in any way possible. Annotator. ]</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly, she knew that the magician Lung-gom-pa was watching. Did
  Andrew know it? She could see no peephole in the wall, nor in the door behind
  the Tibetan guards. But there was the magician's evil face, as if the wall
  were transparent and as if he, too, could see through it. He could see her.
  She knew he could see her. He could see the wound in her naked breast that
  was not yet made by Andrew's bullet! Could he see what she saw in the
  German's consciousness? Could he understand it? It wasn't in German. There
  were no words. It was thought. Visions vanished as Andrew spoke to the
  German:</p>

  <p>"You'd have told Lung-gom-pa that you'd persuaded me to give my automatic
  to that guard. There was a chance he'd have resumed his confidence in
  you."</p>

  <p>Von Klaus snarled back to him: "That is a lie! You&mdash;you know it's a
  lie!"</p>

  <p>"It's plain English," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"You are a coward, Andrew Gunning. You deal only in insults. If you think
  to impose your will on me, you are mistaken."</p>

  <p>Characteristically Andrew didn't laugh. His slow smile was in recognition
  of the German's will to win. Elsa herself more than once had mistaken that
  smile for a mask that hid doubt of himself. It almost looked like it now. She
  wondered: could Andrew see what she saw?</p>

  <p>"You don't know me," said the German.</p>

  <p>"I don't need to," Andrew answered. "You're the second-in-command of a
  Nazi secret commission sent to Tibet by Adolf Hitler's Foreign Office gang to
  raise hell in Lhasa. You left your gang in Lhasa and came here to enlist me
  in your outfit. No dice."</p>

  <p>The German sneered: "You flatter yourself, Mr. Yankeedoodle! But now that
  we've met&mdash;if it is not too late&mdash;if you are willing to obey me
  &mdash;I will bargain with you. It will be a hard bargain. But it may save us
  both from the woman and that bear trap and the red-hot charcoal!"</p>

  <p>Charcoal collapsed to ashes in the brazier. The man in spectacles got up
  and poured on fresh charcoal from a sheepskin bag. There was a sharp smell of
  fumes. Elsa, with fingers in front of her eyes, prayed, through shut teeth
  that denied the prayer, that Andrew might see what she saw.</p>

  <p>Andrew was standing quite still, staring at the German. He spoke quietly:
  "What's your idea of a deal?"</p>

  <p>Elsa drew in her breath sharply. She couldn't see Andrew's thought&mdash;
  couldn't imagine why he asked that question. The German's intended treachery
  was as plain as his answering speech&mdash;as his arrogant will to win:</p>

  <p>"You tool of meddlers! I have been working on this ignorant magician Lung-
  gom-pa for weeks, using scientific methods to make him afraid of his own
  magic and of my intelligence. Therefore now he keeps us waiting, giving us
  time to quarrel with each other and to betray each other. Savage psychology!
  You, you damned fool, have done exactly what he wanted, trying to force a
  quarrel instead of trusting me. Now the opium is here he no longer needs you.
  Nor your woman. Nor Bulah Singh. He needs your ponies, and your plunder to
  give to his men. He would torture you now, for his men's amusement, if it
  wasn't for me. But he's afraid. As long as he's afraid, I can control him
  &mdash;unless you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted: "If you've a plan, what is it?"</p>

  <p>Elsa bit her lips to crowd back words that tried to break through to warn
  Andrew to make no bargain. Andrew would be bound by his word. The German
  wouldn't. It would be a trap. But Andrew listened. She saw his aura again
  &mdash;resolute, but fearful of doing the wrong thing.</p>

  <p>"There can not be two commands," said the German. "Either you place
  yourself and your party at my disposal, or&mdash;you may just as well shoot
  yourself." He grinned&mdash;glanced at Elsa. "But why shoot the girl? Why not
  leave her to enjoy life a bit longer?"</p>

  <p>Before Andrew could answer, the door behind the armed guards began to open
  slowly. The guards stood aside, awkwardly presenting arms. Lung-gom-pa the
  magician loomed in the door in a dim blue light. He stood staring at Elsa. He
  ignored everyone else in the room, for about sixty seconds. Then slowly he
  turned his gaze toward the man in spectacles and pointed toward him with his
  outstretched left hand. The man in spectacles turned ghastly gray. One of the
  door guards strode toward him and struck him with the butt of his rifle. The
  man in spectacles got up and left the room, breathing hard, holding his
  ribs.</p>

  <p>From the dim blue light behind Lung-gom-pa, Bulah Singh's woman emerged.
  Behind her, clinging to her skirt, came the boy that Bulah Singh had boasted
  was his bastard. They appeared to be well pleased, but the boy looked sleepy.
  They were smiling. There was something about both of them that suggested
  triumph. They smiled at Andrew. The woman's eyes hardened as she stared at
  Elsa. They walked slowly, following the man in spectacles out of the room.
  The door closed quietly behind them. Then von Klaus spoke with a dry
  throat:</p>

  <p>"So he dies! Well! For us, that means one Schweinehund fewer to deal
  with!"</p>

  <p>The magician Lung-gom-pa spoke curtly to the guards. Then he turned his
  back and disappeared into the dim blue light of the inner room. One of the
  guards with a jerk of the head commanded Andrew and von Klaus to follow the
  magician. The other guard crossed the room and took hold of the canvas bag
  that Elsa was sitting on. But Andrew was quick. He seized the man's neck from
  behind and sent him crashing to the floor ten feet away.&mdash;He ordered his
  own man to shoulder the bag. The lad obeyed stupidly, too terrified to
  refuse. The German laughed:</p>

  <p>"Gewiss, Sie bitten dringend, uns auf die Folter zu spannen!"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* "You're really eager to get us tortured." Annotator.
  ]</p>

  <p>Andrew spoke quickly to Elsa: "Thanks for keeping quiet. Sorry I had to
  talk tough. It may happen yet. I've a plan that may work, or it may not."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, Major von Klaus is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Try to leave it to me. There can't be two captains."</p>

  <p>"All right, Andrew!"</p>

  <p>"Understand, Elsa: I'm playing both our lives on one throw."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered. "I agree to it. If we lose, I will face you." She
  tapped her breast, smiling up at him, bright-eyed. "God bless you, Andrew. I
  know you'll shoot straight."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch37"
     id="ch37">CHAPTER 37</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Andrew's hand again. Between her shoulder blades. But
  dismalness gone. Strange how a human feels but one experience at a time.
  Elsa's that moment ranged from spiritual ecstasy to leaden physical
  exhaustion&mdash;even hunger. She was so tired she could hardly keep from
  swaying. But she felt one experience only. Love overwhelmed all being,
  drenched all consciousness. Facts hadn't changed, but they meant less.
  Friendship hadn't changed; it was there, good, variable, relatively
  unimportant, a derived, phenomenal emotion.</p>

  <p>"Love&mdash;is this God&mdash;or the act of God?"</p>

  <p>Memories, doubts, physical and mental fears were far away, perceived
  through love, dimmed by love that was in itself so absolute, so separate from
  logic that nothing else mattered. It didn't really matter that she mustn't
  let Andrew guess her secret. It included him. He couldn't possibly escape it
  in the end. But could his hand between her shoulders feel&mdash;interpret?
  How could he not know?</p>

  <p>Death? Danger? Only drabness dies! Death would be an incident. Everyone
  dies, sometime. Torture can be endured, until one dies of it. It doesn't
  matter. Agony dies in the end of its own nothingness, like irrecoverable
  years. Love lives forever. Now and forever. Pain and the past must be
  something less than love's chrysalis&mdash;its shell&mdash;its seed bed, in
  which necessary nothings rot, to release such real wonders as&mdash;as
  &mdash;as the comforting thrill of Andrew's hand between Elsa's shoulder
  blades!</p>

  <p>Consciousness of contrast brought her suddenly to earth&mdash;to the
  guarded door of the stone walled room&mdash;walking beside Andrew, into the
  smelly dim blue spider-chamber of a pagan black magician! Thoughts&mdash;
  thoughts&mdash;thoughts&mdash;only a few paces&mdash;millions of thoughts,
  all simultaneous&mdash;no time&mdash;no space&mdash;</p>

  <p>Had she solved the riddle of the crucifixion? Or, truly to understand it,
  must one first be crucified? If so, she was willing. But was that really its
  secret? Was it as simple as that? What is it that gets crucified? Surely not
  goodness! Surely not kindness&mdash;such as Andrew's kindness! Had she
  herself even a trace of such kindness as governed Andrew? Did she know what
  kindness is? Did the Lords of Love let Jesus die in agony because it was not
  really His but the dark world's agony&mdash;and He never felt it&mdash; only
  with its eyes the world beheld&mdash;Ninety-first Psalm&mdash;was that it?
  Were life&mdash;love, joy the real consciousness&mdash;the real inseparable
  wonder? The real Reality? Pain&mdash;death&mdash;cruelty &mdash;were those
  false consciousness&mdash;the unreal lying shadows &mdash;dreams of a night
  that dies at daybreak? Love&mdash;is love daybreak? Was she, Elsa herself,
  all-selfish? Could she be that&mdash;and yet feel and experience this? Her
  baby? Was that experience mere mother love &mdash;good of its kind, but not
  beyond good and evil? Beyond good and evil? Did mad Nietzsche really
  know?</p>

  <p>Andrew's quiet voice interrupted thought: "Walk proudly! Think of
  something you love! Smile! Don't be afraid. I won't let 'em hurt you."</p>

  <p>Was Andrew blind? If he'd look, he'd know how little afraid she was! But
  it was well that he didn't look! He mustn't know! He mustn't! Thinking
  sympathetically of each other forms a spiritual mirror. Truth reveals itself
  in that. He mustn't know! She must speak, to ripple the mirror's surface!</p>

  <p>"Think of poetry, Andrew! That always brings you the right idea."</p>

  <p>The thrill in her voice surprised her. Andrew mistook it for fear. He
  laughed curtly, yielding to what he supposed was her mood. Choosing at
  random, he chanted aloud to help her to be brave. They marched into the
  dimness of the magician's den together to the rhythm of John Masefield's
  verse:</p>

  <p class="poem">"O Beauty, I have wandered far;<br>
  Peace, I have suffered seeking thee:<br>
  Life, I have sought to see thy star<br>
  That other men might see ... "</p>

  <p>Trust Andrew to set a wild harp thrumming! Oh, Andrew, Andrew! Why did I
  never know until now!</p>

  <p>Lung-gom-pa the magician felt the thought behind the chanted words. He
  recognized a force, as spiders in their webs perceive a change of a weather.
  He leaned forward, staring between the two blue glass lanterns that stood on
  the desk in front of him. On the table between the blue lanterns was a
  butter-lamp made from a human skull blackened by age and soot. Black-robed,
  on a black throne like a bishop's, gaunt, emaciated, not without dignity, the
  magician gazed through sunken red-rimmed eyes that knew evil. They had sought
  evil, found it and seen. They were like ape's eyes, only larger and more
  ancient-looking&mdash;old by some other measurement than years.</p>

  <p>Von Klaus, standing beside a charcoal brazier, warming his fingers, felt
  tide of thought meet tide. He, too, was sensitive, but he had no magician's
  genius for silence, nor any patience with what he couldn't understand.
  Anything beyond his understanding was blind insolence. He would destroy it.
  Through a dry throat he scolded:</p>

  <p>"One would think this Affenschwanz* knew Nietzsche's beyond good and
  evil!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Affenschwanz</i> (Germa)&mdash;literally, "monkey's
  tail;" metaphorically, "monkey's penis." Annotator. ]</p>

  <p>Elsa shuddered. Was Nietzsche's ghost in the room? Had von Klaus read her
  thought&mdash;or she his?</p>

  <p>Andrew's face darkened. He growled at the German: "You've the sun in your
  eyes. Like you, this old devil confuses means with ends. But the ball's
  yours. Kick off."</p>

  <p>"Sun in my eyes?" Von Klaus shook his head as if he thought Andrew had
  gone mad; "There is no such phrase in all Nietzsche's writings. I know
  Nietzsche by heart."</p>

  <p>There began to be a rhythmic drumbeat. Very dimly there appeared a dark
  space where the wall against which the Tibetans leaned didn't reach to the
  roof. The drumming came through that dark gap, probably from the magician's
  real holy of holies where his trained assistants waited.</p>

  <p>Andrew took the initiative. He signed to the young porter to set the
  locked canvas bag on the floor at the magician's feet. Furtive, then frantic,
  like a long-gowned bogey stealing base the porter dumped his load&mdash;
  stuck out his respectful tongue at the magician&mdash;ran back to the door
  &mdash;threw himself on his face&mdash;covered his head with his coat and lay
  still. The door guard prodded him with a rifle, just to add to his terror.
  Andrew didn't show his automatic, he only reached for it. The guard decided
  further prodding was unnecessary&mdash;retired to the door&mdash; leaned
  against it, doing his best to appear unconcerned, but watching Andrew
  sideways.</p>

  <p>So it was safe to be truculent, in spite of that ominous drumbeat and the
  wordless tension. There was no actual crisis yet. Andrew's face revealed
  relief. Von Klaus resented that. To help him to steal the upper hand he
  needed fear, strain, more tension. He tried barbed sarcasm:</p>

  <p>"Kreuzblitzen noch einmal! Ausgezeichnet!* An evil eye! An iron will! An
  Olympian scowl! You are familiar with Virgil?&mdash;Annuit et totum nutu
  tremefecit Olympum!"&dagger;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Kreuzblitzen noch einmal!</i>&mdash;an antiquated
  German expletive, comparable to "Holy Moly!"; <i>ausgezeichnet</i>&mdash;
  excellent. Annotator. ]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[&dagger; <i>Annuit et totum nutu tremefecit Olympum</i>
  "(Great Jove) nodded and all Olympus quaked at his consenting brow", <a href=
  "http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/vergil/aen10.shtml"><i>Aeneid</i>, Book
  10</a>, Line 115.]</p>

  <p>The gibe drew no retort. Andrew spotted its purpose to make him feel
  uncivilized&mdash;uneducated&mdash;ignorant&mdash;out of his class. He felt
  no impulse to retort in kind. If he had, he would have resisted it. He was
  aware of a quiet sensation like growing upward&mdash;not physically
  &mdash;not mentally&mdash;some other way, quite indescribable. He was getting
  a mental bird's-eye view, beginning to feel he had the German's number. But
  he had to be careful&mdash;cautious. He found that infernal drumbeat
  irritating. It was irregular. It was a kind of agitator intended to separate
  thought into its parts to fall, of their own nature, into pockets, there to
  be manipulated.</p>

  <p>The magician sat still, staring at Elsa. A panther was the thought that
  crossed Elsa's mind. A black panther afraid of the dark devil within himself.
  His eyes had a similar smoldering fire. But in actual appearance he more
  resembled an Egyptian statue in black marble, except for that fiery red fear
  in his eyes that were set too close together. What was he afraid of? In
  addition to the door guard he had ten men to protect him. So it couldn't be
  physical fear&mdash;unless&mdash;unless&mdash;could he be one of those
  mystery priests, whose priesthood only lasts until its magic fails&mdash; and
  then they must die&mdash;at the hands of their guardians?</p>

  <p>It seemed possible. The ten were armed and booted for outdoors, seated
  with their backs to the semicircular wall, to right and left of the magician.
  They were very evidently brigands, self-assured and well armed, wearing the
  stolen clothes of men of substance. But they also wore strange symbolic
  jewelry. They were something else besides brigands. Andrew stared at them one
  by one. Some dropped their eyes. Some didn't. Elsa whispered:</p>

  <p>"Poetry! Poetry!"</p>

  <p>Andrew resumed his chanting:</p>

  <p class="poem">" ... Bearing the discipline of earth<br>
  That earth, controlled, may bring forth flowers.<br>
  O may our labors help the birth<br>
  Of nobler souls than ours."</p>

  <p>The magician slowly unfroze, in silence, as if he thawed reluctantly into
  a less impersonal condition. He became angry, breathing heavily. He appeared
  to believe Andrew's chant was rival magic&mdash;possibly more potent than his
  own. His nostrils dilated. His movement was subtle, a hardly noticeable
  menace, like a cobra's. But he didn't dare&mdash;yet&mdash;or else didn't
  choose&mdash;yet&mdash;to join issue&mdash;lock ranks&mdash;struggle
  &mdash;force against force. He thought of it&mdash;his eyes revealed that
  &mdash;but he didn't do it. With loaded silence he appeared to be
  deliberately tempting Andrew into some kind of magical mental trap. It was
  like the pull of a magnet. In that dim blue light it suggested an octopus
  under the sea. But he played safe when Andrew's last syllable died on the
  air. He droned the sacred monosyllable that is said to join heaven and hell
  and to release powers that be for purposes to come. White&mdash;black
  &mdash;priest&mdash;magician&mdash;they all use it:</p>

  <p>"Aum-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m!"</p>

  <p>Andrew seized the initiative. "Ask him," he said calmly, "do we meet here
  as friends to exchange courtesy and to do each other kindness?"</p>

  <p>Elsa cooed approval. "Andrew, who told you!"</p>

  <p>"Say, would you mind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh! I shouldn't! All right, I won't do that again!"</p>

  <p>She translated his words into singsong Tibetan. The brigands smiled; the
  magician knew that without glancing at them; he appeared to resent it as a
  smear on his dignity. When he answered, after a pause, he spoke more to his
  own men than to Elsa. Andrew didn't catch the reply, but it might be
  important, so he asked:</p>

  <p>"What did he say?"</p>

  <p>Von Klaus answered before Elsa could get a word in: "He speaks like
  Goethe. He says: Sie ist im Geisteslande jung geworden!* Donnerwetter, was
  ist denn los?&dagger; Is this a seance?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[*<i>Sie ist im Geisteslande jung geworden!</i> (German)
  &mdash;"She is rejuvenated in the spirit-realm!" Annotator. ]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[&dagger; <i>Donnerwetter, was ist denn los?</i> (German)
  &mdash;"Dammit, what's going on here?" Annotator.]</p>

  <p>"You know less Tibetan than I do," Andrew retorted. "I don't care a damn
  what you think he said."</p>

  <p>The German stared, stroking his beard: "It was from her I got it. We must
  use her. Sie ist eine Geisterseherin.* I warned you. I was here first. I
  dealt the cards. I know what will happen unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Sie ist eine Geisterseherin</i> (German)&mdash; She
  is a medium. Annotator. ]</p>

  <p>He paused, expectant. But again he had failed to draw Andrew's fire.
  Andrew repeated the question:</p>

  <p>"What did Lung-gom-pa say?"</p>

  <p>Elsa answered: "He said: 'My heart beats like a bird's.'" She almost
  closed her eyes. "I don't know what he meant by that. But he is afraid
  &mdash;I don't know what of."</p>

  <p>Von Klaus nodded and spoke with dark significance: "He fears me! Not
  without reason!"</p>

  <p>All the Tibetans understood there was a mental duel between von Klaus and
  Andrew. Like their magician they awaited the outcome. Like the watchers of a
  cockfight they, not the cocks, knew what the fight was about, for whose
  profit. They smiled at Elsa, like connoisseurs. But something indefinable was
  lacking. Elsa didn't fear them physically at the moment.</p>

  <p>Andrew gave her another sentence to translate: "Tell him it's our custom
  &mdash;yours and mine&mdash;to talking sitting down. Ask where are his
  manners?"</p>

  <p>"May I put it less bluntly?"</p>

  <p>"No. Say it the way I said it."</p>

  <p>She obeyed. Von Klaus clucked priggish disapproval of such a flagrant
  breach of etiquette. But the effort to embarrass Andrew by encouraging
  Tibetan resentment failed of its purpose. The magician murmured to the
  brigand at his right hand. He promptly signaled to the door guard. The door
  guard laid down his rifle and brought forward the only two chairs in the
  room. He had to carry them one at a time; they were heavy&mdash;not so large,
  but almost as elaborate as the magician's throne. High-backed, carved,
  important-looking chairs.</p>

  <p>"Stolen," said Andrew, low-voiced; he couldn't resist the silk-smooth feel
  of old carved wood; he caressed a carving with his thumb. Signing to Elsa to
  be seated, he took the chair beside her. That left von Klaus standing and
  staring so hard that Elsa wondered whether she and Andrew looked as ghastly
  as he did in the wan blue light. Or was the German seeing things? Andrew
  grinned unfriendly at him:</p>

  <p>"Your move. We're waiting."</p>

  <p>The German hesitated, vilely angry. He would have liked to shoot, if his
  eyes told the truth. Elsa whispered:</p>

  <p>"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Irritated, Andrew said grimly: "Cut that! You'll spoil my style. I've got
  Fritz on the run!"</p>

  <p>She looked up at the crooked beams of the stamped mud ceiling: "Very well,
  Andrew!" But her lips moved: "Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive
  us our trespasses&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She felt gay&mdash;light-hearted. She was praying for balance&mdash;
  fighting an impulse to laugh&mdash;hysterical because she and the magician
  were the only ones who knew what was going on. She subdued the impulse to
  laugh, but she couldn't help smiling. She loved Andrew. Loved him. Secretly.
  Forever and ever. It was irresistibly comical that neither he nor the
  magician knew that. She and the magician were at opposite ends of a universe,
  like plus and minus, so near that they could almost touch each other and so
  distant that they couldn't meet for all eternity. All the magician's brigands
  smiled when she did. But that wasn't such a good idea; the magician didn't
  like it. He was growing restless. It might be that he resented the lessening
  tension. Perhaps it made him feel less supernaturally vile. He loved
  vileness. But he wasn't beyond good and evil, because he hated good. You
  can't hate what you have risen beyond. That was another reason why it was
  difficult not to laugh. But what the magician did have was such strength of
  silence that Elsa's emotion wavered on the verge of tears. That was another
  strange thing. She felt sorry for the old man&mdash;wondered whether he was
  hungry, unaware that she herself was famished.</p>

  <p>Andrew asked suddenly, aloud, in English: "What are we waiting for?"</p>

  <p>Von Klaus answered irritably: "For my interpreter of course! What is your
  hurry?"</p>

  <p>Then something happened as things do in dreams. The brigand farthest from
  Von Klaus, at the end, on the magician's left, leaned forward. His shoulders
  were invisible in shadow. His flat face dimly shone in the blue light,
  smiling as only Tibetan and Chinese faces can, like a mask that signified
  pure humor, implying no opinion, no relevancy, simply enjoying fact:</p>

  <p>"His being dead," he said sweetly. He might have loved the interpreter. He
  didn't look at the German. He watched Elsa, as if that helped him to recall
  forgotten English words. Then awkwardly, he added: "Being dying too much soon
  this afternoon now big bird eating feeneesh."</p>

  <p>Elsa suddenly knew how the interpreter had died. She didn't see. She knew.
  She almost fainted. But Andrew didn't notice that; his eyes had met the
  German's: "Did you get that?" he asked. "He says your interpreter's
  dead."</p>

  <p>The German straightened himself. He took it well&mdash;a mite too well. It
  crossed Andrew's mind to quote Latin back at him&mdash;summa ars est celare
  artem*&mdash;but it felt better to wait. The German's jaw fell, just a
  trifle. His eyes narrowed, hardly noticeably. He clenched his fists; the skin
  turned white under the pressure. He shrugged his shoulders. There was a glint
  in his hard eyes. It was pretty good acting.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>summa ars est celare artem</i> (Latin)&mdash;the
  greatest art is art concealed. Annotator. ]</p>

  <p>"Schweinhunde! Treacherous devils!" He swallowed, seeming to be trying to
  read Andrew's mind. "Do you believe it?" he asked earnestly. "Or are
  they&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew's answer, to the point though it was, revealed nothing of Andrew's
  thought, belief or disbelief:</p>

  <p>"On our way this evening we passed the village burial ground. A fresh
  corpse had just been thrown to the dogs."</p>

  <p>"Did you look at the corpse? Did you go near?"</p>

  <p>"No, I sent flowers," said Andrew. He felt glad then that he hadn't quoted
  a Latin cliche.</p>

  <p>"Careful!" Elsa whispered. "Careful!" She knew von Klaus asked nothing
  better than an excuse to fly into a rage. She couldn't sit quiet and let
  Andrew blunder into a false move. But the warning was too late. Von Klaus
  began to work himself into a passion:</p>

  <p>"Oh! Sarcasm! Eh? Malice! So! The mark of a lying coward! I suspected you
  from the first, Andrew Gunning! Now I accuse you of having caused the death
  of my interpreter&mdash;in order to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted: "You damned fool!"</p>

  <p>"Wahrhaftig!* I was damned&mdash;when I neglected to kill you on sight
  like the insolent swine that you are! It is due to your treachery that now I
  have no automatic! It is too late to remedy that. But have you not enough
  intelligence to perceive this is the end?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>wahrhaftig</i> (German)&mdash;truly, verily,
  indeed.]</p>

  <p>"End of what?" said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"The end of us! Do you wish to die of crushed testicles, with red-hot
  charcoal at your toes and fingers? If it is true that they have killed my
  Chinese servant, then it is clear they are playing with us. They amuse
  themselves. This is all prearranged. They intend to torture us presently. Why
  wait for that? Do me the favor, will you, to shoot first the magician. After
  that, you may kill your woman. Then me. Or&mdash;if you lack the necessary
  courage, lend me your weapon. I will shoot him, her, you, and then myself, in
  that order!"</p>

  <p>"You promise?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly! Yes! Of course! What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Andrew smiled. "Not that I give a damn. Because it's no dice. But you
  wouldn't keep your promise. You might kill the magician, and perhaps me. Then
  you'd be on top, wouldn't you? Suppose you tell 'em what's in my bag who put
  it there&mdash;why&mdash;who the stuff's for&mdash;and who paid for it!"</p>

  <p>Von Klaus shrugged his shoulders, disgusted: "Die of torture, since you
  wish it. I don't even know enough Tibetan to ask these devils why they killed
  my interpreter."</p>

  <p>"We'll soon find that out," said Andrew. He glanced at Elsa. She put the
  question straight to the magician. He murmured to the brigand beside him. The
  entire proceedings did seem prearranged. The brigand began to speak as if he
  had it all by heart. Elsa interpreted, phrase by phrase:</p>

  <p>"Von Klaus's dead interpreter was Chinese&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted: "Not Japanese?"</p>

  <p>"He says Chinese. The interpreter, whose name was Fu Ling&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted again: "Well, I'll be damned. I might have guessed
  that. I didn't. Fu Ling&mdash;Washington, D.C.&mdash;San Francisco
  &mdash;Berlin&mdash;London. Good guy. Too bad he's dead. But go on&mdash; I'm
  listening."</p>

  <p>"Fu Ling tried to persuade the magician Lung-gom-pa to agree to waylay you
  and me, and kill us, and steal the contents of this bag. But&mdash;he says
  &mdash;Lung-gom-pa used magic and perceived there were seven reasons each
  containing seven other reasons why not. He means the magician was
  unconvinced. Therefore, instead, they tortured Fu Ling, to make him tell all
  he knew about von Klaus and about you and me. But Fu Ling died too quickly,
  telling nothing."</p>

  <p>Von Klaus interrupted: "He must have swallowed slow poison. Damn him, he
  stole mine!"</p>

  <p>Elsa continued: "This man says ravens instead of vultures are pecking Fu
  Ling's body&mdash;and that is proof that Fu Ling's soul is destined for hell.
  Now Lung-gom-pa wishes to know, and he asks: What can we tell him about von
  Klaus, who is a peling and talks incomprehensibly about religion?"</p>

  <p>Andrew didn't exactly stiffen, but something happened to him. Elsa almost
  physically felt the spark of intuition leap into his mind. He laid his hand
  on hers, unaware of it, although it made her heart leap like a caught bird.
  Andrew was like a still hunter&mdash;no, he wasn't, he was like a
  cross-examiner at a court trial spotting a crucial point. She wondered what
  he had discovered. But he guarded his thought. He waited for Von Klaus to
  brag and blunder&mdash;not many seconds&mdash;Von Klaus couldn't resist that
  impulse:</p>

  <p>"Herr Gott! All this Umschweif!* Let me tell it. I already said this old
  Schwarzknstler&dagger; is afraid of his own magic&mdash;and of me!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Umschweif</i> (German)&mdash;rigmarole, digression.
  Annotator. ]<br>
  [ &dagger; <i>Schwarzknstler</i> (German)&mdash;black magician. Annotator.
  ]</p>

  <p>"Why were you afraid of Fu Ling?" Andrew asked him.</p>

  <p>It was a palpable hit. The German hesitated. He looked startled. "Me? Fear
  my interpreter?"</p>

  <p>"They tortured him&mdash;to suit your book. Why?"</p>

  <p>Von Klaus hit back: "Herr Gott! Have you gone mad from fear of torture?
  You accuse me of&mdash;has the altitude gone to your head? Or&mdash;no! I
  know the answer! Of course yes! Sol! Of course! Why didn't I think of it!
  Opium! So you are a drug addict? You have been using what you have in that
  bag!"</p>

  <p>But he failed flatly to unmask Andrew's strategy. Andrew touched the
  canvas bag with his toe, reflectively. "Has that brigand done talking?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>The brigand had not done talking. When Elsa questioned him he spoke so
  rapidly that she kept asking him to pause, to let her interpret:</p>

  <p>"He says: this peling von Klaus came here several weeks ago with his
  Chinese interpreter, bearing credentials from Lhasa. Good credentials. Here,
  in this village he imposed himself as an official guest, making many demands.
  Peling though he is, he has received the hospitality due to a nobleman. But
  this continually happened&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Von Klaus cut in with a sneer: "Will you listen to muck? Perverted sex is
  all they think about! I warn you: this won't be fit for any woman's ears
  unless she is a nymphomaniac. He is going to lie about my relations with
  Bulah Singh's woman." He went through the motions of wringing ullage through
  his fingers.</p>

  <p>"What we'd like to know," said Andrew, "is why you turned in Fu Ling."</p>

  <p>"That man will tell you nothing but lies."</p>

  <p>"Well, let's hear 'em anyhow." Andrew tossed an off-hand question for Elsa
  to ask: "Has Bulah Singh's woman been receiving bribes from von Klaus?"</p>

  <p>Elsa had to ask that question twice. There was a whispered conference with
  the magician. Then the answer: "Yes. Too much money."</p>

  <p>"In return for the bribes, what did the woman do?"</p>

  <p>"Making too much picture magic-making look-see."</p>

  <p>Von Klaus interrupted again: "Das Weib ist eine&mdash;"'*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Das Weib ist eine ...</i> (German)&mdash;The woman
  is a ... Annotator. ]</p>

  <p>"Thanks, we know about her," said Andrew. "She's a trance medium. Did you
  make use of her to communicate with Bulah Singh in India?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm getting at."</p>

  <p>"You mean what you would like to get at," von Klaus retorted. "I tell no
  secrets. But are you an ignoramus? Don't you know as well as anyone that the
  technique of modern intelligence work&mdash;espionage and counter-espionage
  is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew cut in. "Modern? That stuff's older than Jeremiah's school of
  prophets! The British began organized experiments in thought transmission
  during the war in 1915. You Fritzies have been trying it ever since. Hitler
  keeps his private mediums at Berchtesgaden. Your Gestapo has a whole corps of
  'em. Do you admit having used that woman?"</p>

  <p>"I admit nothing. You speak from ignorance. You imagine imbecilities. But
  why do you yourself travel with a special woman? Do you burden yourself in
  that way for fear of syphilis? Or lest your lack of self-sex-discipline
  should lead to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ask that brigand to go on talking," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>The German believed he had scored. He chested himself. While Elsa listened
  to the brigand he smiled leanly, nodding. He pretended to have lost all
  interest when Elsa began to interpret. He warmed his hands at the brazier as
  if he were washing them in the fumes.</p>

  <p>"This peling&mdash;he means von Klaus&mdash;offered to teach and to help
  Lung-gom-pa by means of a new system of religion&mdash;I believe that is what
  he means&mdash;to become Kashgan of all this country."</p>

  <p>Andrew raised his eyebrows: "Of all Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"So he says. I understood him to say that. Von Klaus undertook to make him
  Regent-guardian of the infant Dalai Lama, which would give him all
  power."</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned. "I guess the wires crossed that time! Or were they tapped!
  Bulah Singh's bastard boy-wonder! The bonny pretender!" Suddenly he roared
  with laughter that made all the brigands and even the door guard laugh too,
  although they didn't know what he had said nor why he laughed. The magician's
  ape-eyes widened, but, being beyond mirth and grief where dignity forbade, no
  smile escaped him. Or perhaps he alone understood that Andrew's smile had
  been genuine but the laugh was forced. It served its purpose. Von Klaus
  exploded like a detonated bomb of humorless passion:</p>

  <p>"So! A clown, are you? Like an American movie hero! I wash my hands of
  your Jew-drama!"</p>

  <p>He went through the motion of washing his hands in the hot brazier fumes.
  Andrew kept up the irritation:</p>

  <p>"You're too subtle for me. The way you say it, you sound all steamed up
  for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elsa stirred: "Don't, Andrew, don't!"</p>

  <p>But if it was damage it was done. Von Klaus was ready for his supreme
  effort&mdash;his barrage that should break down all resistance. He looked
  apoplectic. His neck swelled. He screamed, like an enraged parrot, as if
  rebuking mutineers or Jews in Dachau concentration camp. "You can't bargain
  with me! Do you think I will tamely submit to your dictation? You came too
  late! Bah! Phui! You have no right here! You are an interloper! Try on your
  worst treacheries! Then see how swift&mdash;how remorseless will be die
  Wiedervergeltung&mdash;the reprisal&mdash;die Bestrafung&mdash;"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Wiedervergeltung</i> (German)&mdash;retribution;
  <i>Bestrafung</i> (German)&mdash;punishment. Annotator. ]</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted: "You're not counting on your little Gestapo gang in
  Lhasa, are you? Lhasa's a long way from here. How'll they learn you're up
  against it? Are they using a medium?"</p>

  <p>"Bah! You are medium-crazy! You don't guess how near my friends are!"</p>

  <p>That shaft almost got home. If the German's friends really were near the
  game was up. It was more than possible. It could explain why the Tibetans
  waited with such patience. There was no chance&mdash;absolutely none
  &mdash;that a party of Gestapo men would do less than steal all Andrew's
  loads and ponies. They wouldn't have to do their own murdering. At half a
  hint the Tibetans would do that for them. Andrew felt the cold premonition of
  fear like a chill wind. But then suddenly he felt Elsa's influence. He
  couldn't have explained it. It was warm, and it calmed him. With half-closed
  eyes, Elsa was leaning back, seeming almost asleep, although her left hand,
  on the chair-arm, was crushed under his. He realized he must have hurt her
  terribly. Snatching his hand away, he began framing an apology, but no words
  came because her lips moved&mdash;not speaking to him. He caught the murmur
  and the rhythm: "Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He took her hand gently&mdash;flexed it to relieve the numbness. "See
  here," he said to von Klaus, "you've bluffed like hell. But it's no go If you
  want my help, you'll have to come clean. I won't give you a break if you
  don't."</p>

  <p>Von Klaus stared venomously, smiling with invincible arrogance. "Very
  well," he retorted. "You have me at disadvantage. Name your Shylock price and
  I will pay."</p>

  <p>Andrew ignored the insult. "All I want is the truth. What was your deal
  with these Tibetans?"</p>

  <p>Then there appeared and explained itself the reason why von Klaus had been
  selected for a dangerous, deadly mission. The man's genius came forth&mdash;
  his gift for snatching a chance and rising like a Phoenix from the ashes of
  failure, defeat, humiliation. The truth, too, can be venomous, the way he
  told it&mdash;truth about the lies that he himself believed because they fed
  his conceit. His movements fascinated the old magician. All the Tibetans
  watched him, breathless, like spectators at a play. He began to pace to and
  fro beside the brazier. He appeared to be gathering thought, establishing a
  rhythm, something like that of a dynamo. There were no words. He didn't
  mutter to himself. But he was building the mysterious hypnotic force that all
  spellbinders and all orators use, though none knows what it actually is. They
  build it until they feel it and then let loose. Andrew heard Elsa's
  whisper.</p>

  <p>"Andrew, can you be gentle? Can you break it and not add to it?"</p>

  <p>He didn't know quite what she meant, but he knew the German must be
  deflated somehow. Quite likely he was working up&mdash;besides mental
  passion&mdash;strength for a physical leap at Andrew's throat, to seize
  Andrew's automatic. Ridicule seemed the best bet. Andrew tried it:</p>

  <p>"The words that you're pounding your brain to remember are 'Sieg Heil!'*
  Shall I spell 'em for you?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Sieg Heil!</i> (German)&mdash;Hail, Victory!
  Annotator. ]</p>

  <p>The German stood still&mdash;threw an attitude&mdash;spoke, gripping his
  coat with one hand. He held the other clenched fist ready for one of those
  upward blows at the air that hypnotize because the audience knows they are
  coming, awaits them in suspense, listens for the magic phrases, that shall
  make the fist leap upward."</p>

  <p>"Lung-gom-pa says that I spoke of religion. Wahrhaftig! I did. Day after
  day I have dinned into his stupid consciousness&mdash;as I now tell you
  &mdash;the Christian dispensation, as you call it, is done!&mdash;dead!
  &mdash;kaputt! It is a burned-out moon! There is nothing more dead than a
  dead delusion. Jew-Jesus and his ranting hypocrites&mdash;his humble
  parasites&mdash;his Peters and Pauls and Popes and other howling dervishes
  &mdash;no longer set the fashion of ideas. There is no law nowadays of
  offering the other cheek to the smiter. The smitten go down in the dust and
  the smiter tramples them. The roots of Christianity were in the Sermon on the
  Mount. Its last fruit was the Treaty of Versailles! And that also is dead! It
  is a stink in men's nostrils&mdash;a putrid corpse, like Christianity. Dead!
  And with Christianity died Buddhism. Buddha, the more ancient myth-monger,
  died drowned like a bee in its own honey! Buddhism is dead! &mdash;forever
  dead! And so is Islam dead. So are all dreamy religions dead that lure their
  victims into slavery to priests! Heil Hitler! Today's world shakes off
  Jew-shackles and Jew-ideology! The power of the shameless hymning feminist
  humbugs of all religions, died with the death of the Lie of Versailles! Heil
  Hitler! A new day has dawned! By virtue of the German race &mdash;Heil
  Hitler!&mdash;manhood comes at last into its own!&mdash;and they shall rule
  the world who ride the new whirlwind, compared to which Genghis Khan and his

  infantry&mdash;England's imperial greed and all the Jew-bought liars ganged
  against Germans in 1914&mdash;are as nothing! I said 'as nothing'! Heil
  Hitler! I speak of the new conquest of the world&mdash;of the rule of
  Might&mdash;of the law that Might shall prevail&mdash;and of the
  truth&mdash;the realistic truth that there is neither right nor wrong, but
  only that which is expedient. Ends justify means."</p>

  <p>He paused for breath, sweating, breathing, glaring, estimating Andrew's
  reaction. He believed he had Andrew half won&mdash;or at least shaken
  &mdash;until Andrew spoke:</p>

  <p>"But what a hell of an end to aim at!"</p>

  <p>Von Klaus gasped as if struck in the face.</p>

  <p>Elsa spoke dreamily: "Andrew! Ask what else he said. What did he promise
  about you and me?"</p>

  <p>Her prompting dovetailed so neatly into Andrew's own thought that he
  hardly noticed it. Somehow he had to avoid the need of using that automatic
  that he could feel each time he breathed. He must convince von Klaus that his
  whirlwind of words had not been altogether wasted. He must string him
  along.</p>

  <p>"Okay, Christianity's dead. So you flogged a dead horse and betrayed Fu
  Ling. What has that to do with me and this bag? What are you driving at?"</p>

  <p>The German hadn't time to answer. He was hesitating whether to fling the
  lie in Andrew's face or to tell a lie of his own, or the truth, when Elsa sat
  bolt upright. She clutched Andrew's hand with both hers:</p>

  <p>"Don't! Don't! Help me! Not him! Please!"</p>

  <p>The dim blue chamber began shaking, as if a fluttering arc light struggled
  against fog. The black magician's features, with monstrous red-rimmed eyes,
  ten times magnified, loomed&mdash;leered&mdash;leaped&mdash;danced in the
  shimmer. It was like sheet lightning. The Tibetans moaned. The face grew
  larger&mdash;larger&mdash;with fingers beside it that clawed air.</p>

  <p>Elsa began chanting: "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
  death&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her voice was drowned by the Tibetans' moaning and then, suddenly, by von
  Klaus's hysterical laughter&mdash;shrieks, yells of laughter, like a
  maniac's. Elsa clutched Andrew's hand. Her nails dug into his wrist. There
  was a feeling of brain-burst&mdash;of terrific tension&mdash;and something
  happened. The black magician extended both arms like long shadows to right
  and left. Then he failed&mdash;faded&mdash;and grew small again
  &mdash;natural&mdash;lifelike. T he blue shimmering ceased. Von Klaus
  shouted:</p>

  <p>"I told you! He fears me and his own magic! Kill him! I tell you, kill
  him, before he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The magician threw up his arms and screamed like a tortured beast. Two of
  his Tibetans got up and seized von Klaus, twisting his arms behind him until
  he shouted with pain. They threw him to the floor. One of them kicked him. He
  lay still. Then they calmly resumed their seats and suddenly Lung-gom-pa
  stood upright, seeming to grow taller. Pointing long lean fingers at Elsa and
  at Andrew, glaring at them, he vibrated as if his bones were springs. Then
  suddenly his voice burst on the silence, worse than the scream of
  lammergeiers, in a torrent of malediction.</p>

  <p>"Pray, Andrew! Pray!&mdash;Thy kingdom come, Thy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He recited the Lord's Prayer with her&mdash;twice through, and again,
  until the black magician ceased screaming and sank, slowly, like a deflated
  ghost on to his throne. Then there was silence except that the charcoal fell
  in the brazier. The German lay still, but his eyes shone in the gloom near
  the floor like a crouched animal's. Andrew spoke low:</p>

  <p>"Did you understand any of that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! The old magician says we're thieves of souls! Von Klaus has told him
  there's enough opium in this bag to corrupt all Tibet! His men have listened
  to von Klaus&mdash;they want the stuff. Lung-gom-pa won't have it! He says
  it's too evil: shall he govern wretches whose souls have left their bodies
  because of this stuff?"</p>

  <p>The magician stood up again&mdash;screamed again, staggered with the fury
  of his anger&mdash;then sat down, muttering.</p>

  <p>"He says: Whose magic are we using? Shall he bring upon us death from
  which no magic can protect us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted. "Okay. Tell him I'll speak. Will he listen?"</p>

  <p>Still clutching Andrew's hand Elsa spoke a few words in Tibetan. There was
  silence again. The old magician made no sound, no movement.</p>

  <p>"Tell him," Andrew began&mdash;but then he hesitated. Elsa's fingernails
  were gouging his wrist. She didn't know it. She was seeing&mdash;hearing
  &mdash;gazing at something beyond space and time:</p>

  <p>"Andrew! Tell him if he'll work his magic, we'll work ours, and all
  together we'll save him and his people from this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You tell him. I can't. Tell him in Tibetan!"</p>

  <p>''So Elsa said it in Tibetan. The old magician pointed at the bag on the
  floor. Two of his men&mdash;the same two who had manhandled von Klaus
  &mdash;got up and approached the bag. One drew a knife to cut the canvas. The
  magician screamed. They hesitated. Von Klaus spoke, down on his knees with
  his chin six inches off the floor:</p>

  <p>"Let them have it. They'll be drunk on the stuff by morning. Then
  we'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew dived into his pocket for his key&mdash;found it&mdash;held it
  up.</p>

  <p>"Elsa&mdash;I want you to translate, word for word." He faced the German.
  "Get up!" Von Klaus made no move. "I'll come and kick you up if you
  don't."</p>

  <p>Von Klaus staggered to his feet. He went and leaned against the wall,
  pretending to be worse hurt than he was.</p>

  <p>"Answer!" said Andrew. "What's in this bag?"</p>

  <p>Elsa translated that into Tibetan. Von Klaus answered in English:</p>

  <p>"Opium! Enough to poison Tibet!"</p>

  <p>Elsa translated word for word. Andrew retorted."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>Elsa turned that into Tibetan, and the Tibetans watched von Klaus. He was
  trying to guess at Andrew's motive. He was like a chess player with less than
  ten seconds to play. There wasn't a move on the board&mdash;not for him. He
  upset the board. One almost saw the imagined pieces scatter.</p>

  <p>"Damn you&mdash;I know&mdash;because you sent a clairvoyant message about
  it through Bulah Singh's woman!"</p>

  <p>Andrew answered quietly: "I'm not clairvoyant."</p>

  <p>Von Klaus pointed at Elsa: "But she is!"</p>

  <p>Andrew waited for Elsa to translate. Then he said to the German: "So you
  know it's opium?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Open the bag. Let the magician see it!"</p>

  <p>"Elsa, ask Lung-gom-pa: If this should not be opium&mdash;if, instead,
  it's a present for him, that he needs&mdash;then what? Will he help us to
  travel forward?"</p>

  <p>She translated. The magician didn't understand. She asked a second time.
  He looked suspicious.</p>

  <p>"He says: But it is opium."</p>

  <p>"I asked: What if it isn't? Does he promise to help us?"</p>

  <p>"He insists: 'But the other peling says it is opium.'"</p>

  <p>"Tell him it's sugar," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>Von Klaus laughed like a maniac. "You fool, do you think you can keep up
  that bluff! That's the bag! There's the mark on the bag! Do you pretend you
  don't know what's in it? Bah! Give me the key!"</p>

  <p>"Sure." Andrew tossed him the key. "Go ahead. Open it."</p>

  <p>The drumbeat in the room behind the magician quickened tempo. It swelled,
  louder and louder, until it sounded like the muffled thunder of approaching
  doom.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch38"
     id="ch38">CHAPTER 38</a></h2>

  <p class="first">And so, in the black magician's dim blue lantern light,
  Major von Klaus of the Gestapo, on his hands and knees, believing to the last
  second that Andrew was bluffing in fear of his life, unlocked and opened the
  brown canvas bag, with Andrew's key. The truth staggered him. Andrew had told
  the truth. The exact truth. It was an effrontery. Before he could recover,
  his chance was gone to invent a string of lies and create a new crisis.
  Andrew's voice spoiled it, sonorously:</p>

  <p>"My gift&mdash;to the lord magician&mdash;Lung-gom-pa."</p>

  <p>Elsa translated the short speech quickly into Tibetan. The ten brigands
  drew in their breath at the reckless use of the magician's name. But the old
  man himself ignored the breach of manners. He was like a big dark parrot on a
  perch. His red-rimmed eyes became a picture of possessiveness qualified by a
  secret new fear born of knowledge of evil. Not even a vulture ever had such
  eyes as those. Perhaps the Sphinx did. They were not totally unlike the eyes
  of a dog with a bone. He had the bone. Now what?</p>

  <p>In the next room his assistants thumped skull-drums steadily. The refrain
  had changed a little. Now it seemed to beat out the words "Brown cane sugar!
  Brown cane sugar!"</p>

  <p>Sugar, in caravan packages&mdash;cotton bags, wrapped in blue paper. Not
  quite priceless. But at a winter's end, in Tibet, costlier than tea. Much
  harder to come by than minted money. Edible brown gold! Then what was the new
  doubt in the magician's mind? It was up to Andrew to discover.</p>

  <p>Von Klaus had gone berserker or its German equivalent. He had become a
  Teutonic strafing party on his own, inflicting vengeance for humiliation. In
  a spasm of wantonness he seized a package of the precious sugar in both
  hands, raised it above his head and smashed it on the floor. He would have
  smashed a second one, if they had let him. The magician clucked. Ten brigands
  howled&mdash;rushed&mdash;pounced. The scattered contents of the broken
  package vanished in handfuls&mdash;mouthfuls. The drumbeat rhythm quickened,
  grew louder, faded&mdash;and von Klaus lay hurled against the wall, kicked in
  the groin, groaning. It looked as if he had made his last
  mistake&mdash;ruined his last chance. But he had damaged Andrew's chance,
  too, by inviting physical violence.</p>

  <p>He had started something. No one could predict the end of that.</p>

  <p>Elsa struggled against an impulse to go and help von Klaus. She was scared
  back to earth again, clutching Andrew's hand, no vision left, seeing nothing
  but what the Tibetans themselves could see and hear. They saw red. They smelt
  blood. If she or Andrew should move toward von Klaus, that might be a
  trigger, releasing death. There fell a stillness like the breathless calm
  before animals pounce on a living prey. One spark of an unseen something and
  they would seize the German, tie him, drag him outside&mdash;turn him over to
  be bloody entertainment for the villagers. Out in the night the villagers
  were waiting for that outcome.</p>

  <p>After that, no doubt, the ten would turn on Andrew, justifying one crime
  with another&mdash;partly because he had not brought opium and they felt
  cheated&mdash;partly because he was a peling who had neither right nor
  privilege in Tibet&mdash;partly because his baggage contained more, perhaps
  richer loot&mdash;and they were brigands&mdash;and there was violence awake
  in the blue gloom. During one immeasurable moment Elsa visioned the furious,
  sensuous face of Bulah Singh's woman. The fierce eyes turned blood-red, then
  faded and the face died away in the dark. It meant something. But what did it
  mean?</p>

  <p>The strained silence continued during twenty heartbeats. Andrew was poker-
  faced, but behind that almost Red Indian calm he was searching frantically
  for the right thought, idea, word, action. He was tempted, but he didn't
  trust himself to try, to pronounce the Tibetan sacred syllable. It might act
  like oil on a raging sea. It might. He had known it to work, once, when Tom
  Grayne did it. But the least mispronunciation of the complicated vowel would
  be fatal. Even properly pronounced it might seem like a challenge to the old
  magician's powers. One doesn't wisely challenge a magician at his own game.
  Seconds sped like lightning. Thought sped faster than the seconds.</p>

  <p>Somehow&mdash;before von Klaus could recover his malignant wits&mdash; he
  must change the mood of a dozen Tibetans. The incredible old black magician,
  whose philosophy was fear&mdash;fraud&mdash;hatred, was as pleased as a saint
  by the loss of the opium! But like a lean black leopard he was also hungry to
  flex his claws again&mdash;to feel and to use the power that opium would have
  undone as surely as death. Opium would have stolen and softened the wills of
  the thoughtless brigands who were the subjects of his necromantic skill. He
  needed his subjects headstrong, healthy, free to be manipulated. No opium to
  dull their reactions to suggestion! So far, good. It was in his power now to
  credit his own magic with having changed opium into sugar. If he should so
  choose. Broadcasted like a bell's vibration, his magic power&mdash;so he was
  telling himself&mdash;must have reached Andrew in the mountains&mdash;touched
  him. Being woven of fear, it had made Andrew afraid of the stuff that the
  magician hated. Andrew must have thrown the opium away the moment the good
  black magic touched his thought. The cunning pride of the accomplished
  craftsman was in the old magician's eyes. He believed in his magic. Why
  shouldn't he? There was also cupidity. Sugar is wealth&mdash;in Tibet, before
  the lower passes open in the spring.</p>

  <p>It did not occur to Andrew to wonder how he knew all this. He knew it,
  without effort, in a moment of time&mdash;or rather, in a moment in which
  there was no time.</p>

  <p>But, beneath the surface-satisfaction in the magician's eyes was the
  leopard-like furtive terror that moves like lightning when it does move.
  Andrew read that. He intuitively recognized it. It was like a gang leader's
  hidden fear of his own killers. The same fear and no other that makes
  generals send unready troops against prepared positions&mdash;that makes a
  Hitler purge his own supporters&mdash;that makes financiers kill themselves
  &mdash;makes men on the witness stand swear others' lives away.</p>

  <p>Those brigands knew the pricelessness of opium. They cared not one dead
  egg of a last year's louse for a magician's ethics. If they should believe
  &mdash;as they might, as they were simple enough to believe&mdash;that he had
  changed opium into sugar, they were likelier than not to bid him try some
  more of his magic, this time against bullets: let him change those into
  butter. Crude, vulgarly humorous, easily angered men, greedy as dogs. And, as
  magicians know, bullets obey laws that magic only very rarely can resist. Ten
  bullets are ten times worse than one.</p>

  <p>So it was thought against thought, with Elsa at the moment too tired and
  scared to help, sickened by glimpsed visions of Bulah Singh's woman&mdash;
  von Klaus, hurt badly, groaning through set teeth, spiteful, rolling over on
  his belly to watch for a chance to wreck whatever plan Andrew might invent
  &mdash;ten brigands, whose Mongolian smiles could harden just as suddenly as
  water changes into ice at sunset. Moist-lipped, they were considering Elsa,
  viewed as loot, not necessarily for her fur coat and her necklace.</p>

  <p>For the space of no longer than twenty heartbeats, ten thousand thoughts a
  second poured through Andrew's mind. Not least was the thought that Elsa's
  and Nancy Strong's defense would be a passionate Christian outpouring of
  magic against magic&mdash;good against evil. But Andrew was seeking a means
  of attack. The old black magician&mdash;above good and beneath evil&mdash;
  was murmuring spells. His brigands watched his lips-wishing. They wished to
  be told to do that which they wanted to do. They were breathing in time to
  the drumbeats. And now Elsa's lips were moving. Andrew could feel her
  influence. He knew the nature of the loving-kindness that appealed to heart,
  not brain. But his heart, that beat trip-hammer blows rebelliously out of
  time to the drumbeat, revolted in that crisis at the too sweet sentimental
  means that Christians use. He was in no mood for appeasement by humility.
  Perhaps von Klaus had blasphemed better than he knew. Some shaft of scorn had
  struck its mark? The thought of lamb-to-the-slaughter Jesus turned Andrew's
  stomach. He craved not a physical fight, but a fight against powers, against
  the rulers of the darkness of this world.</p>

  <p>He judged he must not stand up&mdash;not yet. He must not move his right
  hand&mdash;yet. The automatic, each time he breathed, felt comforting, but he
  mustn't move his hand toward it&mdash;mustn't use it&mdash;mustn't appeal
  unto Caesar. The slightest thoughtless motion might launch a volley of ten
  bullets. He wished he did dare to stand up. He liked daring to do things. On
  his feet he always felt better command of himself. He wished, too, that
  thought wouldn't sweep through his mind like endless comets' tails. He needed
  to concentrate. He couldn't. He wondered why not. As he stared at the old
  magician's eyes, his own past came back to him&mdash;timeless&mdash;layer on
  layer of memories, interwoven and simultaneous, but as distinct each from the
  other as the phases of a long dream. The magician's force was like dark
  lightning, blindly searching and revealing only Andrew's own thoughts, to
  himself, not to the magician.</p>

  <p>"Where have you seen the magician's face?"</p>

  <p>No one had spoken. Elsa was staring at space with wide eyes. But he heard
  words again, within his consciousness&mdash;composite voices&mdash;many in
  one&mdash;Elsa's&mdash;Tom Grayne's&mdash;Nancy Strong's&mdash; Morgan
  Lewis's&mdash;Bulah Singh's&mdash;all asking one question, that he had never
  answered because it always, whoever asked it, froze him into silence.</p>

  <p>"Why did you leave the United States?"</p>

  <p>The tum-tu-to tum-tu-to drumbeat in the next room insisted on the question
  &mdash;emphasized it&mdash;over and over: "where have you seen the
  ma&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Memories&mdash;memories&mdash;millions, like a jackdaw's jumbled hoard of
  postage stamps, but gradually thinning down to three-two-one:</p>

  <p>"Where have you seen the magician's face?"</p>

  <p>Cincinnati&mdash;Chicago&mdash;Cleveland. School&mdash;university
  &mdash;law&mdash;teachers&mdash;professors&mdash;judges. Andrew the boy, in
  his secret heart of hearts a knight in armor&mdash;heavy that
  armor!&mdash;but, as Mark Twain made King Arthur say, "a man stands straight
  in it"! Good doctrine, that! Nevertheless, he would never forgive Mark Twain
  for his gibes at the Quest for the Holy Grail. "Grailing&mdash; the boys went
  grailing." Andrew had done nothing else, all his days, but go
  grailing&mdash;in school, university, courthouse&mdash;grailing, setting a
  course by the farthest stars&mdash;and at war&mdash;to the death &mdash;to
  the end&mdash;against&mdash;against what? He had never named it.</p>

  <p>Tum-tu-tu-tum-tu-tu ... "Where have you&mdash;seen the ma&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In the beginning it was a drawing of Satan stalking Jesus, in a book for
  children, compulsory reading before he rebelled from Sunday School. Later,
  superimposed on that was Mephistopheles from a library copy of Goethe's
  Faust. Subsequently added were some heel politicians, a political boss, an
  evangelist, some judges, pimps, lawyers, bondsmen, political women&mdash;
  homosexuals&mdash;a whorehouse madam&mdash;two or three authors&mdash;a
  banker&mdash;a doctor&mdash;a couple of Jews&mdash;policemen, taxi drivers,
  senators&mdash;some congressmen&mdash;an editor&mdash;two
  reporters&mdash;every single lying face that Andrew had ever seen and hated
  &mdash;mixed into one monstrous image of all evil&mdash;a living, personal
  devil.</p>

  <p>Tum-tu-tu&mdash;"Where have you&mdash;Tum-tu-tu&mdash;seen the
  ma&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Von Klaus hoarsely shattered the silence: "Shoot! You God-damned idiot!
  Shoot!"</p>

  <p>Andrew heard him. But the German was out of the picture. He didn't count.
  Andrew stared at the magician's face, learning something, all on his own. He
  had always known it. But he hadn't learned it. So he had never known that he
  knew it. Now, as he stared during twenty heartbeats while time stood still,
  he knew he could never again forget.</p>

  <p>Tum-tu-tu-tum-tu-tu ... Evil is&mdash;organized&mdash;living
  intelligent&mdash;The hell with Nancy Strong's stuff! The hell with
  compromise and false peace! There, gazing at him through the old magician's
  eyes, was Evil&mdash;Evil itself&mdash;Satan! As surely as God looks through
  the eyes of honesty, Satan sees men and women through the eyes of hatred and
  envy and fear&mdash;sees them no otherwise&mdash;can see no otherwise!</p>

  <p>He was looking straight into the eyes of Evil&mdash;giving it power by
  hating it&mdash;lending his brain to its brain and his strength to its
  strength. He, himself, Andrew, had imagined, created, made real, breathed the
  breath of life into a mental picture through which, and through the old
  magician's eyes. Evil could see straight into his soul. Divinity that shapes
  our ends is good and evil. Evil also is divine. Choose! Choose! The loser is
  the fool on both sides of the fence!</p>

  <p>Tum-tu-tu-tum-tu-tu ...</p>

  <p>"Shoot!" von Klaus repeated. "Kill him!"</p>

  <p>Elsa felt the torture of turmoil in Andrew's thought. She began to murmur
  the Lord's Prayer. But Andrew knew what he needed. The hell with solemnity!
  He needed laughter&mdash;Rabelaisian, irreverent, blasphemous laughter, to
  break the hold Evil had on him, by mocking, ridiculing, recognizing as a lie
  the false mask he had made in his mind of the faces of men. Good and evil?
  Good or evil! Which?</p>

  <p>It came to him between two heartbeats. The old magician was between the
  devil and the deep sea&mdash;evil's high priest, trying to do good for the
  sake of greater evil! His sudden impulse was to whistle, because he always
  whistled a tune when an idea dawned. But the Tibetans would have called that
  devil-music. He began to hum&mdash;smile&mdash;laugh. Then he broke into
  song. And for the millionth time since 1917 "The Lady from Armentires" did
  duty as Joan of Arc. The opprobrious, dissolute, bawdy, undignified "Lady
  from Armntieres."</p>

  <p>He had been beaten&mdash;he knew it&mdash;until that ribald nonsense
  flowed into his thought and he perceived that all solemnity is a lying
  mockery of God. No truth is solemn. It can't be&mdash;can't possibly be.
  Solemnity is a clowning camouflage. To be solemn about evil, and to hate it,
  is to dignify it and to be and become and remain the bewildered wretch of
  whom St. Paul spoke: "for the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which
  I would not, that I do."</p>

  <p>So Andrew sang:</p>

  <p class="poem">"The French they are a funny race&mdash;<br>
  Parlez-vous!<br>
  They fight with their feet and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lung-gom-pa recognized force up and coming&mdash;force on the march! He
  instantly retorted with a mantra to protect himself from that
  incomprehensible hymn! The brigands joined in, beating the air with their
  right hands, drowning Andrew's voice&mdash;not sure yet whether he was
  wishing on them poisonous peling curses, or blessing them with appetites to
  enjoy the sugar. They could see he was full of laughter.</p>

  <p>But they took no chances. They howled a counter-barrage of invocations to
  a thousand saints who represented forces of earth and sky.</p>

  <p>Through that din, pitched to a harsh yell against Andrew's "Hinkey-dinkey
  parlez-vous," came von Klaus's voice:</p>

  <p>"Kill them! Shoot, you Lmmmel! Jetst ist die Gelegenheit*&mdash; the
  chance&mdash;the opportunity! Shoot!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Lmmel</i> (German)&mdash;lout, layabout; <i>Jetzt
  ist die Gelegenheit!</i>&mdash;Now's your chance! Annotator. ]</p>

  <p>Elsa suppressed a scream as the nearest Tibetan kicked von Klaus in the
  face. He lay still after that. He had sense enough to pretend to be worse
  hurt than he was.</p>

  <p>"Easy," said Andrew, "easy." He touched Elsa's hand. The shouting died to
  a snarling hum like a hornets' evensong. "Now I wish I were a killer."</p>

  <p>"Don't, Andrew! Please don't!"</p>

  <p>"I won't. Don't worry. I'm afraid to."</p>

  <p>"Good!"</p>

  <p>"No. Bad. But there's a chance in a million he didn't betray Fu Ling."</p>

  <p>"But, Andrew, are we his judges? Even if he did betray him, are
  we&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Each to his own decision. I'll give him one more chance. You sit
  still."</p>

  <p>Andrew stood up. That stopped the Tibetans' humming. Dead silence fell,
  except for that infernal drumbeat that had died down almost to a mutter.
  Lung-gom-pa resumed the subtle swaying movement that suggested a cobra.
  Andrew spoke to von Klaus:</p>

  <p>"Did you, or didn't you send Fu Ling to his death?"</p>

  <p>After a second's pause the German snarled back: "Is that any of your
  damned business?"</p>

  <p>"Right. Neither are you. The hell with you. That's final."</p>

  <p>"Andrew! Andrew! Please!"</p>

  <p>Von Klaus struggled into a sitting position, holding both hands to his
  groin. His beard was bloody. It made his mouth look horrible. It made his
  words sound bloody.</p>

  <p>"The hell with your illusions of importance! So you think you can ignore
  me? You will do what I tell you or die! If I die, you die. If I live, you
  live. If we both live, you shall obey me, because I insist on it. If we both
  die, what becomes of your woman?" In spite of pain he contrived a
  mock-courteous gesture toward Elsa. His mouth and beard looked unseductive
  but he did change his voice a little: "Gndiges Frulein, machen Sie schnell!
  Wenn Sie&mdash;* if you can influence this blockhead, do it! Now!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Gndiges Frulein</i>&mdash;Madam (literally,
  gracious miss; <i>Machen Sie schnell! Wenn Sie ...</i>&mdash; Hurry up! If
  you ... Annotator.]</p>

  <p>But the fictional, fanciful "Lady from Armentires" had scattered Andrew's
  reverence for influence of any kind whatever. Elsa knew it had happened. She
  couldn't reach him any longer. Even when she touched his hand she couldn't
  reach his thought. Andrew was someone to follow. He couldn't be led. Mental
  images of Nancy Strong, Morgan Lewis, and Lobsang Pun's broken photograph,
  were looming from nowhere and fading again, forced out of Andrew's mind by
  his own will. He knew Elsa was trying to flood his consciousness with
  spiritual visions, to produce peace. He preferred war. He would go grailing
  henceforth in new armor, with a new weapon. He aimed his inner laughter
  straight at the vision of Nancy Strong. Before she faded he thought she
  laughed. Mocking him? Swell! The hell with her. He only hesitated whether to
  try his own crude Tibetan, that might arouse the magician's scorn and remind
  the brigands to distrust him&mdash;or whether to trust Elsa to interpret
  without talking back. He decided on Elsa:</p>

  <p>"Quick! Ask Lung-gom-pa: Does he accept the sugar?"</p>

  <p>"He says yes, he accepts it."</p>

  <p>"As a gift?"</p>

  <p>"As a gift."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Now ask those ten men. Do they wish to possess the opium that
  von Klaus pretended was in this bag?"</p>

  <p>She interpreted. They breathed hard. There was a murmur of incredulous but
  excited assent.</p>

  <p>"They do want it?"</p>

  <p>"They do. But, Andrew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please don't interrupt. Tell them&mdash;word for word exactly as I say
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Very well. If it's possible. At least I won't change the meaning."</p>

  <p>"This man von Klaus has been using the bastard's mother to make look-see
  magic. They know that, don't they?"</p>

  <p>There was time to look around while Elsa translated. Lung-gom-pa leaned
  forward between the blue lights. The flickering skull-lamp's shadow masked
  his lower face, but it revealed his tortured eyes that speculated&mdash;yes
  &mdash;no&mdash;yes&mdash;no. It was in his power to kill. At a click of his
  tongue there'd be ten bullets. But perhaps better not. Better wait. Better
  listen a while.</p>

  <p>Down on his belly, his groin against the floor to relieve the pain, von
  Klaus, too, watched, listened, speculated. Even though he might not save
  himself, he would spoil Andrew's game. There was no possible mistake about
  his intention. Elsa spoke:</p>

  <p>"Yes, Andrew. They say they know what the woman has done."</p>

  <p>"Tell them to send for the woman!"</p>

  <p>"Andrew!&mdash;First I want to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Send for the woman!" Von Klaus cut in before she could speak. There was
  an excited laugh in his voice. It was not pain alone that made his eyes burn.
  He saw his chance. "Jawohl! Yes. Make an end! Tell her to bring in the head
  of John Baptist!"</p>

  <p>"He's off his nut," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Andrew, he isn't. He's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tell them to send for the woman."</p>

  <p>Elsa interpreted. Von Klaus grinned, listened, waited, watched the old
  magician teeter on the brink of yes, no&mdash;yes, no. Slowly the magician's
  fear of his men outweighed the craving to be the source of thou
  shalt&mdash;thou shalt not. His men wanted the woman brought in. They wanted
  to know Andrew's purpose. Above all, they wanted that opium. Evil must be
  obeyed or perish. All tyrants know that. Pilate knew it. Better the command
  that will be readily obeyed. He murmured to the man beside him, who got up,
  swaggered to the door, whispered to the door guard. The door guard looked
  doubtful, or it might be fearful. But his not to reason why. He nodded
  &mdash;shouldered his rifle. The door slammed shut behind him.</p>

  <p>"Now!" Von Klaus gloated. But he waited, in pain, bleeding. He chose not
  to waste the prodigious effort it cost to raise himself on an elbow and speak
  distinctly. He was trying to anticipate Andrew's next move. There was almost
  no sound but that muttering drumbeat.</p>

  <p>Elsa whispered to Andrew:</p>

  <p>"There's death. I can't see whose. It's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Von Klaus spoke, slowly, letting the words linger because he loved
  them:</p>

  <p>"Mister Cunning Gunning! Why did Bulah Singh's Salome leave this room with
  a knife in her fist? Who plays John Baptist?"</p>

  <p>He laid his forehead on his forearm, fighting the pain in his groin,
  recovering strength to carry on. Elsa whispered again:</p>

  <p>"Andrew, this won't be the way you expect. There's something reversed
  &mdash;it's turned backward&mdash;I don't understand it. It's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted, low-voiced: "I've a hunch we can't save Fritzyboy. I
  think I know what's coming. He didn't count on my men being&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Von Klaus again, hoarse, harsh, gloating: "Blood on her knife! And without
  that opium, can her bastard become Dalai Lama? So does she love you? Hah! If
  you'd had the guts to shoot when I told you to shoot&mdash;but you hadn't the
  guts!&mdash;Here she comes! Now!"</p>

  <p>The door opened. Andrew's right hand didn't move. Two Tibetans entered
  dragging something between them through the dim gloom.</p>

  <p>They weren't self-respecting men. They weren't peasants, brigands, gunmen.
  Shabbily clad, hangdog-looking, they were ragyabas. They stank. Only in time
  of death were such outcasts admitted across thresholds to do what must be
  done. They were dragging their burden between them, its heels to the floor.
  And in the doorway stood Bulah Singh, his dark face faintly outlined by the
  blue light but also touched with blood-red from the brazier glow. He swayed
  slightly on bandaged feet. One arm was around the shoulder of Andrew's head
  man Bompo Tsering. His right hand was out of sight, behind the rifleman who
  had been sent to bring the woman.</p>

  <p>"Andrew Gunning," he said, "here's where I buy your good will!"</p>

  <p>Von Klaus gasped. The two stinking ragyabas dragged their burden past
  Andrew into the blue lamplight between von Klaus and the magician. There they
  raised it, holding it by the shoulders, face upward, so that the head and the
  wide-open lifeless eyes of Bulah Singh's woman goggled upside down at the
  magician.</p>

  <p>Her own knife had been driven to the hilt into her throat&mdash;so
  powerfully driven that no blood ran.</p>

  <p>Elsa gripped Andrew's arm. She didn't mean to. She couldn't help it.
  Andrew watched von Klaus. Von Klaus stared at the dead woman. The muttering
  drumbeat, as if it obeyed the magician's will, quickened its tempo, grew
  louder. Bulah Singh, heavily leaning on Bompo Tsering, limping on bandaged
  feet came and stood beside Andrew, still hiding his right hand.</p>

  <p>"Major von Klaus!" he said. "You sent my woman to kill me. Die, like the
  dog that you are&mdash;you double-crossing, God-damned Hun son of a
  bitch!"</p>

  <p>He fired three shots into the German. He would have fired a fourth but
  Andrew was too quick for him and too astonishingly strong.</p>

  <p>Left-handed, he snatched the repeating pistol. He nearly broke the Sikh's
  wrist. Then he spoke quietly:</p>

  <p>"One shot was plenty. Save your ammunition. Stand by."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch39"
     id="ch39">CHAPTER 39</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was Bulah Singh's own repeating pistol. That set up a new
  chain of problems. But it was the wrong moment to ask how he got it from
  Bompo Tsering, who was on the far side of the Sikh, terrified by the
  magician's stare, blankly non-committal, looking his stupidest&mdash;ready to
  run for his life and soul and hope of lives to come, if it hadn't been for
  Bulah Singh's left arm around his shoulder; that and secret curiosity in some
  way stabilized him. Everyone, even the old magician, waited on Andrew's next
  move. The ten Tibetans sat fascinated, hands on holsters, leaning forward,
  ready to draw.</p>

  <p>Andrew laid Bulah Singh's automatic in Elsa's lap and she let it lie
  there. She appeared not even to notice it. That relieved the tension. The ten
  brigands let go, lolled, relaxed, almost unconscious of their own reaction
  but tremendously impressed by Andrew's disarming of Bulah Singh. The
  suddenness and skill, the lack of evident reason why he should have done it,
  mystified them. They were like spectators at a tragedy, spellbound. Andrew
  and their old magician were the irreconcilable forces of dramatic conflict,
  face to face in a setting of blue gloom.</p>

  <p>The magician's silence was like a monstrous spider's, loaded with
  alertness but also with indecision. If he could only guess Andrew's
  intention, he would know what to do. On the other hand, Andrew felt he knew
  exactly what to do. He must do it quietly, in the right order, without the
  slightest suggestion of haste. He knew the magician was trying to read his
  mind. He was very careful not to underrate his antagonist. Foremost in his
  thought, for the magician to read, was recognition of the old man's prowess.
  There was no challenge, no irritation in that. Thought wasn't flowing so fast
  as it did&mdash;not more than two or three thoughts now between muttering
  drumbeats; but they were concrete thoughts, definite, sharp-edged, having
  satisfying limits. He could understand them. He felt very pleased with Elsa
  because she wasn't panicky. She sat still. If she was trying to guide him
  mentally he couldn't feel it. He felt nothing from her but a warm glow of
  confidence. He knew he could count on her. She would wait to be told what to
  do and then do it.</p>

  <p>So the first thing was to make sure of Bulah Singh before he could recover
  self-command. When he did, he would be truculent. Bulah Singh wasn't a maniac
  like von Klaus; he had no conviction of racial superiority. He was in that
  sense easier to manage than the German had been. At a higher state of
  evolution than the victim of his bullets, to a certain extent he could think.
  He was more open to argument. For the moment he was nursing his hurt wrist,
  half believing it broken, biting his lip, scowling. He needed a plain
  presentation of fact. Andrew spoke quietly:</p>

  <p>"One word, or one move, and I'll kill you."</p>

  <p>The Sikh appeared to believe. He made no comment.</p>

  <p>"As dead as von Klaus and your woman."</p>

  <p>Again no comment. Reaction was taking care of Bulah Singh. No danger from
  him for a moment or two. The next two moves were as clear as though they were
  written on a board in front of Andrew's mind. But they were more difficult
  &mdash;needed more caution. He had to save the magician's face without
  implying for one moment that the magician had lost it. And he must remove the
  too suggestive evidence of death, that breeds death as surely as dirt breeds
  dirt. The sight of slain corpses never&mdash;since Cain slew Abel&mdash;
  never induced peace where there was no peace.</p>

  <p>There was a dark stream of blood on the floor. It flowed from von Klaus's
  head, past the magician's feet, between him and Andrew. In that weird gloom
  it looked snake color, until it reached the short zone of the brazier light.
  It moved and it coiled like a snake. Where the light from the brazier touched
  it, it appeared to have blood-red eyes and a flickering tongue. Its slow flow
  measured the speed of thought&mdash;hundreds of thoughts, but the blood not
  yet far from where it started.</p>

  <p>Solemn stuff, blood&mdash;the solemn substance of all necromantic magic.
  So above all now, no solemnity! Andrew smiled at the magician. He looked down
  at the blood, at the two dead bodies, and shrugged his shoulders. In smiling
  pantomime he suggested it might be the master magician's pleasure to command
  what manifestly needed doing. Corpses dead by violence, in Tibet, are
  abominations not to be endured in the presence of self-respect. But can a
  general order his guns away and still give battle? Dead human blood was the
  stock in trade of the magician's mystery. He sat still&mdash;silent. He
  didn't yet understand Andrew's smile. He wasn't sure yet what Andrew
  intended. He feared for his dignity.</p>

  <p>"Ask him," Andrew said quietly, "doesn't blood bring devils to cause
  confusion?"</p>

  <p>Elsa, with closed eyes, translated. There was a barely noticeable change
  of tension. The magician's authority had been appealed to. To be obeyed would
  be a good beginning; all tyrants make use of that entering wedge. His lips
  moved. He murmured a few words in Tibetan. One of the ragyabas instantly
  swung the woman's corpse over his shoulder. The other picked up von Klaus.
  They carried away the bodies. One of them returned after a few moments and
  cleaned the blood off the floor, using a mop made of sheep's wool that looked
  like a featureless human head. The other brought water in which the two of
  them wrung the mop. When they had finished they put their tongues out at the
  magician and retired backwards&mdash;leaving behind them, along with relief
  from the stench of their persons, a sensation as of a closed book, and of a
  new page in a new book opened.</p>

  <p>"Very clever!" Bulah Singh whispered. "But now what?"</p>

  <p>Andrew had waited for that. Instantly he completed the humiliation of
  Bulah Singh. He pointed to the wall with his left hand. He held his right
  fist poised suggestively at about the level of the Sikh's liver.</p>

  <p>"Go and sit down over there. Don't speak or move until you're spoken
  to."</p>

  <p>The Sikh hardly hesitated. He studied Andrew for one moment and then
  hobbled away on bandaged feet. He sat down with his back to the wall. The ten
  Tibetans smiled. Henceforth, in that company, the Sikh would rate as Andrew's
  subordinate&mdash;a mere killer, rebuked&mdash;without a chance to regain
  importance. The Sikh realized it. Cunningly he hung his head, to make Andrew
  believe he accepted defeat and was henceforth playing Andrew's game.</p>

  <p>The old magician studied the board and the pieces on the board. He was
  beginning to feel ready to answer Andrew's opening gambit. He looked at the
  packages of sugar and the canvas bag they came in&mdash;then at Andrew
  &mdash;then again at the sugar. There was not in his mind one trace, one
  symptom of the law, which even animals obey, that he who accepts a gift
  accepts an obligation to the giver. No gratitude. Andrew's sugar, if he could
  have his way, should be reckoned as tribute. It might be cunningly employed
  as evidence of Andrew's fear&mdash;since who gives valuable gifts unless he
  thinks he must? Solemn, logical, realistic, untrue argument, older than
  Machiavelli&mdash;as old as sin.</p>

  <p>But it had dawned on Andrew that logic and mirth can't coexist. Like death
  and life, they deny each other. All logic, and all realism leads to tyranny
  and death. Mirth leads to freedom and life. So tyrants murder mirth as being
  treason to their logic. Mirth is white magic.</p>

  <p>"Quick!" said Andrew. "Say this in Tibetan: The magician so wise that he
  can make the devils of the mountains fly away with a load of opium, surely
  can make other devils reveal where the opium is!"</p>

  <p>Elsa half opened her eyes&mdash;translated. Andrew restrained a smile for
  the sake of the magician's dignity. He let his eyes laugh, for the magician's
  private information. Then he turned on Bompo Tsering, giving the magician
  time to weigh implications. Bompo Tsering almost jumped out of his skin when
  Andrew spoke to him, low-voiced:</p>

  <p>"You! What happened?"</p>

  <p>It was like turning on a faucet. Speech poured out. It had been prepared.
  It was ready. "Gunnigun! My giving Bulah Singh his pistol because that woman
  coming. Her calling him bad names too much. Her wanting us Tibetans helping
  her to castrating him, then kill him. But your having ordered us our guarding
  him. And Gunnigun, his saying that woman your enemy. So our holding her. His
  using her knife, killing her too much."</p>

  <p>The truth. No doubt of it. But not the whole truth.</p>

  <p>"What became of the child?"</p>

  <p>"His running away."</p>

  <p>Also, clearly not the whole truth. But Elsa had finished translating. In
  another moment the magician might see a flaw in Andrew's strategy. Now,
  before thought could organize against him, was the right split-second to
  force the main issue. He spoke fiercely to Bompo Tsering:</p>

  <p>"Get out of here! Now. Get the men and ponies ready to march."</p>

  <p>"But, Gunnigun! Being too much dark night! Their needing rest! Our needing
  food to take along&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Be ready to march at moonrise! Will you obey? Or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My obeying! My going now! My doing!"</p>

  <p>"Take that porter with you."</p>

  <p>Scared nearly out of his wits, Bompo Tsering showed his tongue to the
  magician and was gone. In a moment he was kicking the porter up off the
  floor. The door guard tried to stop him. Andrew, laughing again with his
  eyes, said to the magician in English:</p>

  <p>"Let both men out!"</p>

  <p>Elsa translated. His authority again appealed to, the magician nodded. He
  slightly raised his right hand. The door opened, admitting a welcome blast of
  clean cold air. Then it slammed shut. There was a moment's silence. The
  magician spoke then&mdash;one word&mdash;in Tibetan.</p>

  <p>"He asks 'Why?'" said Elsa. "I believe he means why did you send away
  Bompo Tsering?"</p>

  <p>Andrew knew he had won. His smile now was triumphant.</p>

  <p>"Ask him: Does he want my men to hear all about the opium? If so, I'll
  send for them to come back and listen."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh cackled a curt laugh: " Clever! Krishna! Yes! Who would have
  thought of it!"</p>

  <p>The brigand who knew a few words of English leaned forward, pointing his
  finger at Andrew:</p>

  <p>"You! Your knowing where is&mdash;that&mdash;that stuff! Your saying
  &mdash;your showing us! Your making us look-see!"</p>

  <p>The magician rebuked him, but he looked mutinous. He began to whisper to
  the next man. Andrew made his last move but one. The magician's eyes betrayed
  that he knew himself checkmate even before Elsa had finished saying what
  Andrew told her to say.</p>

  <p>"When we entered the village we saw yak-dung and the hoofprints of yaks in
  the mud."</p>

  <p>The magician nodded almost imperceptibly.</p>

  <p>"Did not those yaks belong to the peling von Klaus, who is now dead?"</p>

  <p>Another hardly perceptible movement of the old magician's head
  acknowledged the fear that if he should deny the fact there might be worse to
  come.</p>

  <p>"How many yaks are there?"</p>

  <p>Silence. But suddenly Bulah Singh piped up again. "Ten yaks! I asked von
  Klaus at the village gate. He boasted: ten yaks&mdash;two mules&mdash; twenty
  sheep."</p>

  <p>The brigand who knew English interrupted loudly:</p>

  <p>"Yux belonging us now!" Then he whispered to the brigands near him. They
  put their heads together. They appeared to agree. But the old magician had
  understood Andrew. Cautiously, carefully, feeling his way in the hope of
  seeing an alternative, he surrendered inch by inch to Andrew's terms. He
  angrily commanded silence, with a bark like an angry leopard's. The
  whispering ceased. He must have made a secret signal then, because the
  muttering drumbeat swelled to a low thunder and died down again. Andrew stole
  that dramatic moment:</p>

  <p>"Tell him," he said cheerfully, "I want all ten yaks loaded with barley. I
  want 'em now. That will be a small thing in return for all this sugar. The
  yaks cost him nothing. I also want the twenty sheep belonging to von Klaus,
  each sheep loaded with all the butter it can carry."</p>

  <p>Elsa translated. Andrew continued:</p>

  <p>"He and his men may keep whatever else von Klaus had with him, including
  firearms, ammunition, and money. But as for the opium&mdash;which was in this
  bag until the lord magician made the devils change it into sugar&mdash; I
  wash my hands of it. It is the lord magician's. Let him command or not
  command the devils to produce it or not to produce&mdash;as he pleases!"</p>

  <p>Elsa was heard to the end in silence. But then the storm broke. All ten
  brigands stood up and shouted. One of them flourished a Mauser. The one who
  knew English shouted:</p>

  <p>"Your will staying here until our having that!"</p>

  <p>The drumbeat swelled again. Through the tumult Bulah Singh called hoarsely
  to Andrew: "Give me my automatic! This means they'll put hot charcoal to your
  feet and fingers! They mean to know where the opium is!"</p>

  <p>That wasn't such a bad guess. One brigand strode to the brazier. He
  stirred it with an iron poker and blew on it until it glowed crimson. Then he
  shook the poker at Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Elsa," said Andrew, "go up close to the magician and ask: Shall I tell
  them&mdash;or tell him&mdash;where the opium is?"</p>

  <p>She obeyed. The brigands stared. The tumult died down, but not quickly
  enough even for the nearest brigand to overhear what Elsa said. She returned
  and sat down in the chair.</p>

  <p>"You're not scared?" Andrew asked.</p>

  <p>"No. Why should I be?"</p>

  <p>She loved him too much to be scared of anything at that moment. Andrew
  patted her hand on the chair-arm. He did it unconsciously, and she knew that.
  She was glad with all her heart that her love was secret from him. If Andrew
  knew, it might confuse and make him self-conscious. His whole attention was
  on the magician, which was where it should be. He didn't even know he had
  spoken to Elsa. Now he heard Bulah Singh speaking:</p>

  <p>"Give me my automatic! We've got to shoot our way out!</p>

  <p>He heard the words&mdash;understood&mdash;but took no notice. The old
  magician arose slowly to his feet and there began to be a new unearthly
  artificial silence, separated into measured spaces by the drumbeat. He had
  some secret way of controlling the drumbeat. The brigands recognized the
  changing rhythm. It was an overture to something that they knew too well. It
  frightened them. There was a chilly sensation like the moment before hail.
  There came a noise like the rattle of dry bones and a moaning like that of
  the wind on the hill where they bury the dead. Andrew spoke without knowing
  it:</p>

  <p>"Don't let this scare you. Grab hold of me if you want to."</p>

  <p>He laid his hand on the chair-arm. Elsa pushed hers under it. His fingers
  closed on hers. Her lips moved. Silently, inside himself, where secret
  laughter was the fuel of a new, unconquerable fire, he began singing ribald
  nonsense:</p>

  <p class="poem">"The French they are a funny race&mdash;<br>
  Parlez-vous!<br>
  They fight with their feet and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Even that ceased. The old master hypnotist's mental rhythm overwhelmed
  mere words. Something was happening. Something like a tidal wave in
  consciousness. It was impossible to tell how the magician did it, but it felt
  mechanical&mdash;almost electric&mdash;as if he knew some way of agitating
  the glands that govern fear. He pointed at empty space. His brigands began to
  see what they knew he willed they should see. He chanted, in ancient Tibetan,
  the language that devils use who sinned so vilely that they may not be reborn
  but spend eternities in quest of still human souls whose bodies they can
  seize for a little while and use for a little evil in the dark.</p>

  <p>And then&mdash;as the Tibetans saw it and lent it material substance,
  Andrew and Elsa saw too. It was into the dark that the magician pointed
  &mdash;the dark corner where the zone of firelight ceased and there was dim
  blue gloom. All the Tibetans moaned. The door guard let his rifle fall to the
  floor with a crash. The magician croaked like a raven&mdash;chanting
  &mdash;pausing&mdash;chanting. In dim blue darkness a pale disembodied face
  took form. Bulah Singh spoke hoarsely:</p>

  <p>"Give me my automatic!"</p>

  <p>It was a face so saturated with the cruel loneliness of death that
  Andrew's blood ran cold. It was like a death mask. Only it lived. Its eyes
  opened. They were cold pale green. Its mouth moved, like a murdered mouth
  that licked dead lips for the lingering taste of hatred that could not die.
  Then it spoke, in the ancient Tibetan that only the magician understood. Its
  voice came from nowhere&mdash;from everywhere&mdash;from all over the room.
  It seemed to fill the room with a sepulchral sound that had no echo.</p>

  <p>"What's he saying?" Bulah Singh demanded. "If you can get this&mdash;I
  mean understand it&mdash;you can beat him at his own game! What's he
  saying?&mdash;Give me my automatic!"</p>

  <p>Like force compressed beyond compression's limit, Andrew's inner laughter
  returned suddenly. As it did, the voice died to a harsh, hoarse whisper that
  rose and fell, continually waning until it ceased. Elsa's hand within
  Andrew's moved convulsively. Her lips moved. He knew she was saying the
  Lord's Prayer. He made a sudden decision to pray too, for the sake of unity
  and friendship and because he vaguely felt he had been unkind and had
  mistrusted her. Besides, the thought of prayer felt clean. But why in
  silence? He prayed aloud:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Twinkle, twinkle, little star!<br>
  How I wonder what you are,<br>
  Up above the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh interrupted: "What in hell are you talking about! Have you
  gone mad?"</p>

  <p>And then Elsa: "Keep it up, Andrew! It's the thought that counts. The
  words don't mean a thing!"</p>

  <p>That spell was broken. But it re-awoke inward laughter. Consciously he
  ridiculed himself, and that was a relief like a pulled tooth. It was like
  waking from a nightmare. And as he watched, that pale face like a death mask
  began changing. It wasn't only Andrew who observed it. The old magician
  appeared to lose physical strength. He resumed his seat at the desk between
  the blue lamps. He looked ghastly. He sweated. Transferred to his face was
  the tortured lonely murdered look of the apparition. Where the apparition had
  been, now was the wrinkled, astonishing face of Lobsang Pun. It was alive,
  alert, in motion. One quick glimpse, and it was gone. Then silence. Not even
  a drumbeat. All the brigands were down on their hands and knees.</p>

  <p>Andrew stole also that moment. He spoke quickly.</p>

  <p>"Good girl! Well done! Now! Tell Lung-gom-pa now is the time! Give us
  yaks, barley, sheep, butter&mdash;now&mdash;this minute&mdash;or I'll tell
  his brigands where to look for the opium!"</p>

  <p>Elsa translated. The frightened brigands, hearing her voice, scrambled to
  their feet, too late. They didn't hear what Elsa said. The magician turned
  his head slowly and gazed at Bulah Singh. It was an unspoken question.</p>

  <p>"Tell him," said Andrew, "that man doesn't know where the opium is."</p>

  <p>The old magician smiled thinly when Elsa told him what Andrew had said.
  Bulah Singh spoke up, protesting:</p>

  <p>"You idiot! Do you think they'll believe I don't know? They'll torture me!
  Do you think I'll tell them nothing? Jesus Christ! I'll tell them stuff about
  you that'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly, because Andrew had picked up the automatic from
  Elsa's lap. He looked half incredulous, cunning, triumphant and then cautious
  as he listened:</p>

  <p>"Elsa, tell Lung-gom-pa we'll take Bulah Singh with us. And this: We march
  at moonrise." He reached for his watch. Every brigand in the room reached for
  his automatic. But Andrew only glanced at the time. He smiled. They all
  looked clownish and self-conscious. "That means half an hour from now.
  Repeat: Unless we're on our way at moonrise, I will tell where the opium
  is."</p>

  <p>The magician stared. He opened his mouth wide. His blasphemous lips framed
  the sacred syllable. He breathed it, murmured it, moaned it. His brigands
  joined in:</p>

  <p>"Aum-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m!"</p>

  <p>One thing now seemed sure. There would be no killing while that sound
  lingered on the air. Andrew put his arm through Elsa's and spoke sharply to
  the Sikh:</p>

  <p>"Get a move on, you. Grab my other arm. We'll go now while the going's
  good."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch40"
     id="ch40">CHAPTER 40</a></h2>

  <p class="first">So the second stage of the journey began, beneath an icy
  moon, in a moaning wind. The yaks and sheep were not too manageable; they
  didn't relish a night march. Men and ponies had been well fed, not well
  rested. Bulah Singh, with his feet bandaged against the cold, rode one of von
  Klaus's mules, taken from the brigands in trade for his automatic, which
  Andrew wouldn't have let him have back in any event. He rode darkly alone in
  mid-column, at the tail of the little flock of loaded sheep. The mule and
  ponies could be trusted not to override the sheep. The yaks couldn't. So
  Bompo Tsering led the way with the yaks, singing to keep dugpas from
  misleading him along the shadowy trail.</p>

  <p>Andrew brought up the rear, to prevent straggling. Elsa rode with him. For
  a long time they didn't talk much. As almost always happens after a terrific
  ordeal there was a feeling of dissociation from events&mdash;of unreality
  &mdash;of something not quite like waking from a dream. They listened for
  random rifle shots&mdash;farewell salutes from the magician's village, each
  whining bullet loaded with resentment, each echoing crack a threat of
  pursuit. But they were Tibetan brigands, too afraid of ghouls and of the
  homeless souls of murdered men to be likely to pursue through the darkness.
  Andrew said:</p>

  <p>"They know we'll move slowly because of the sheep. Two miles an hour is
  our limit. They'll count on overtaking us at their convenience. They'll
  search for the opium first. The old magician doesn't want us caught. He's too
  sure we'd fix the blame on him for the loss of the opium. That might cost him
  his life&mdash;his power anyhow. So he'll keep 'em looking for the damned
  stuff for several days. By that time we'll have crossed the Shigatse. They
  won't follow us across. It's too dangerous this time of year. And there'd be
  too much risk of running into troops from Lhasa."</p>

  <p>After that he was silent for a long time. Elsa was glad of it. It was
  enough to ride beside him. Her love for him seemed to be part of the mystery
  &mdash;part of the night. She must get used to it, now, under the moon and
  the stars. Secrets are more difficult to keep by daylight. She hugged her
  secret, as she hugged herself warm inside her overcoat. Andrew didn't suspect
  it.</p>

  <p>She had learned a lot about Andrew. During the last few hours she had
  thought about him as never before. Her previous blindness seemed incredible.
  Cursed or blessed, whichever it was, and perhaps it was both, with
  clairvoyance and sensitivity and pride, how should she account for not having
  known she was in love? That was the bewildering thing. Why hadn't she known?
  She could see now that she had been in love with him all along. O God, how
  glad she was she hadn't known it sooner! If she had known, she could never
  have come with him on this expedition, even with the wild intention of
  releasing Tom Grayne from an unbearable yoke. It would have been unthinkable.
  What had given her the right&mdash;the moral right&mdash;to travel alone with
  Andrew had been the fact that they weren't in love. Fact! What skittles facts
  are! Icicles that melt the moment truth appears!</p>

  <p>And now, would she have to confess to Tom that she loved Andrew? Tom would
  be sure to suspect it. But would it be any of Tom's business? He would be
  right to suspect herself, yes, because it was true. It was true forever. But
  not Andrew. Andrew wasn't in love. Had she any right to compromise Andrew
  &mdash;in exchange for his kindness&mdash;his generosity&mdash;his unwavering
  respect? As long as she was Tom Grayne's wife, Andrew would treat her as Tom
  Grayne's wife, no matter what passion might urge him to do. There would be no
  concessions. Andrew would lean backwards. The worst possible mistake would be
  to let Andrew even guess she loved him. He would dry up. He would govern
  himself so grimly that even if he were in love with her, he would deny love
  rather than intrigue against his friend&mdash;even if she were willing. She
  was unwilling. Death would be ten times welcome rather than anything shabby
  or underhanded. In fact, she wasn't at all sure, nor was she disturbed by the
  thought, that death might not be the acceptable answer. She didn't feel like
  dying. She was quite sure she wasn't afraid of death. Surely she wouldn't
  seek it. But she would rather die ten times over than betray Tom Grayne and
  Andrew&mdash;both or either of them. They were men of integrity. To betray
  them into a quarrel would be a dirty and abominable thing&mdash;a whorish
  thing. It made her shudder to think of it.</p>

  <p>Andrew's character had steered them clear of the toils of Lung-gom-pa.
  Nothing else could have done it. She knew quite well what her own
  indispensable part had been, but it would have been quite useless without
  Andrew's spirit&mdash;his indomitable integrity. Another man would have
  trimmed his spiritual sails and have lined up with von Klaus and Bulah Singh,
  trusting to the future and some trick to dear that entanglement. Or he might
  have left Bulah Singh to make what terms he could with the magician. But in
  spite of the certainty that Bulah Singh would be treacherous at the first
  opportunity, Andrew had snatched him out of danger&mdash;brought him along
  &mdash;not trusted him but saved him. The most lovable thing about Andrew was
  that he didn't suspect himself of being a hero in anyone's eyes&mdash; least
  of all in his own.</p>

  <p>As it happened Andrew was still a little afraid he had done the wrong
  thing. He spoke of it after a while:</p>

  <p>"Hell! If I were only a killer. I'm not. I can't persuade myself to take
  human life. I suppose it's cowardice."</p>

  <p>Elsa kept silent. She remembered she mustn't praise him. If she should
  tell him he wasn't a killer because he wasn't capable of cowardice he would
  shut up like a clam; his thoughts would be driven back into himself behind
  that veil that she could never penetrate. Silence was better&mdash;silence,
  the stars, and the magic of frosty moonlight. It wasn't long before he began
  talking again. He seemed to find comfort in thinking aloud:</p>

  <p>"Suppose I'd left Bulah Singh. They might have tortured him to find out
  what became of the opium. But I think not. He'd have pretended he knows where
  I dumped it. He'd have bargained with the brigands and trusted to luck. You
  know of course why he killed that woman?"</p>

  <p>He waited for an answer. She had to speak.</p>

  <p>"Bompo Tsering said she tried to kill him. Wasn't that the reason?"</p>

  <p>"Part of it. I got the whole story from Bompo Tsering while they were
  loading the yaks and sheep. Bulah Singh was through with the woman. She'd
  gone her limit for him. She was no more use to him, but she might be
  dangerous because she knew too much about him.</p>

  <p>So his scheme was to take the child and to leave her behind. She'd doped
  it out. She and the child both screamed the accusation at him when she showed
  up. Bompo Tsering believes they'd read Bulah Singh's thought&mdash; something
  like tapping his mental telephone. Anyhow, she and Bulah Singh had a battle
  of words to get control of our Tibetans. They bid high. Both sides promised
  anything. But she made the mistake of telling our men that you and I were on
  the coals already, being tortured by Lung-gom-pa. That gave Bulah Singh his
  chance to play Sir Galahad. He did such a spellbinding job of it that they
  held the woman. They gave him her knife and said: 'Kill her!' He did. I guess
  he wasn't squeamish. After that, Bompo Tsering felt he could trust him, so he
  gave him back the automatic. We know the rest."</p>

  <p>"But, Andrew, what became of the child? Surely they didn't kill the child?
  Bulah Singh didn't, did he?"</p>

  <p>"No. The brat ran away. Bulah Singh tried to get them to catch him, to
  bring with us. He's like von Klaus, but a bit more subtle, with an obstinate
  one-plan mind. He still hopes to persuade me to try to substitute that young
  monster for the Dalai Lama."</p>

  <p>"But, Andrew, where is the child? What happened to him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I told you: he ran. Perhaps Lung-gom-pa might take him on
  as an apprentice. He's the type. But Bompo Tsering thinks Bulah Singh may
  have made a last-minute deal with one of the brigands to bring the little
  brute along after us. He swears we haven't seen the last of him."</p>

  <p>"Do you believe that, Andrew? You don't believe that, do you?"</p>

  <p>"I never believe what I believe. I'm one of them there hopers. Bulah Singh
  did talk with one of the brigands while my back was turned. I'm counting on
  old man Shigatse. It's one hell of a river. Once across, we'll be rid of
  pursuit."</p>

  <p>"But isn't there a ferry?"</p>

  <p>"There won't be, once we're on the far side. I'll see to it."</p>

  <p>Silence again. Elsa thought of scores of questions that she didn't dare to
  ask. She thought of things she was aching to tell. But questioning or telling
  might make Andrew close his mind. So they rode without speaking for a long
  time until he unexpectedly broke the silence:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you saw what I did&mdash;that face in the magician's chamber? I
  can see it now without trying to. I could carve it in wood. It was one hell
  of a God-damned face. I guess I'm going to have to carve it, to forget it
  &mdash;to get it out of my system. What did you make of it?"</p>

  <p>"Did you see only one face?"</p>

  <p>"I saw two. I guess we all did. But I'm speaking of the first one. It
  burned itself on to the brain like magnesium light. That was plain black
  magic. Call it hypnotism if you want to play ostrich. Hypnotism is the
  charlatan highbrow's false name for a lot of boloney. It's an easy word for
  intellectuals to hide behind."</p>

  <p>Elsa forced herself not to answer. She was almost bursting with
  excitement. For the first time Andrew seemed to be drawing aside, if only
  ever so little, that veil behind which his purposes lurked&mdash;purposes
  that never appeared except as forthright actions, done, unexplained. Even
  those few words almost stopped him. He seemed to suspect he had said too
  much. But she waited in silence. So after a minute or two he continued."</p>

  <p>"Barring unimportant details, we had an example tonight of the inside
  workings of all priestcraft and all politics."</p>

  <p>Was he trying to get her to tell what she knew? Was he pumping her? She
  didn't yet dare to accept the challenge. It was quite possible that he was
  tempting her into an argument so that he might grind his baffled emotions
  against her mysticism. Presently, since she said nothing, he made another
  downright statement:</p>

  <p>"We're all in the same boat, doing the same damned thing. We either make
  mental pictures, or else we have 'em made for us. One or the other. We
  create, or we don't. The cave men did it. Moses forbade it. So did Mohammed.
  But we all do it. We're either potter's thumb or else the molded plastic. Get
  that? Shape or be shaped. Magic&mdash;white or black&mdash;Christian or
  pagan&mdash;ancient or modern&mdash;is the acquired ability to create and
  project a mental image that suggests to other people what to believe and how
  to behave."</p>

  <p>Elsa listened, too excited to trust herself to speak. Her voice might have
  betrayed her. Andrew was heading straight into her new holy of holies. Did he
  know it? Anyhow, silence was the best way to persuade him to continue.
  Presently he did, looking up at the moon as he rode. His face shone.</p>

  <p>"A black magician purposely creates a fear image&mdash;fear&mdash;
  violence&mdash;need&mdash;hunger&mdash;sickness&mdash;death&mdash; all that
  stuff. That living dead face that we saw was Lung-gom-pa's picture of God.
  His God's a devil. If you analyze it far enough, it's himself. That was his
  own inside portrait. But I'll bet you not one of us saw the same face. I
  doubt we heard the same words. Lung-gom-pa projected his own composite mental
  picture of himself, his teacher, his black mahatma* and his father the Devil
  all combined in one. But what each of us saw was a symbol of his own fear and
  his own hate. He made us do it. He used the drumbeat to work up emotion. He's
  an expert mental technician. But his fundamental principle's the same as any
  political priest's or boss-gangster's&mdash;it's the same for instance as
  Hitler's bogey picture of the Jew&mdash;or the Sunday School picture of a
  devil with horns."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Mahatma</i> (Hindi/Sanskrit)&mdash;in India and
  Tibet, one of a class of persons venerated for great knowledge and love of

  <p>Elsa couldn't keep quiet any longer. "Andrew, don't you think the magician
  had help?"</p>

  <p>"How d'you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Is it the wrong time to try to explain what I've&mdash;what I've
  discovered quite recently?"</p>

  <p>"All depends. Is it first-hand? Or did someone tell you."</p>

  <p>"Both. First I was told. Then I tried&mdash;and discovered."</p>

  <p>"Ummn. Go ahead. I'll listen."</p>

  <p>But was he listening? She was afraid he had retired behind a veil of
  skepticism into that unexplorable where he kept his passion. It was no use
  guessing&mdash;no use hesitating&mdash;no use trying to choose the right
  words. Elsa plunged in:</p>

  <p>"Andrew-suppose you say 'Jesus' to someone. What happens? Instantly that
  person's concept of Jesus presents itself to him as a mental picture. He
  can't help it. It happens. It's either the child Jesus, or the Teacher on the
  Mount, or the crucified or the resurrected Jesus&mdash;or perhaps a target
  Jesus that he doesn't believe in&mdash;that he hurls his hatred at. Perhaps
  it's a dead Jesus&mdash;crucified dead, buried and done for. But whoever
  hears the name Jesus sees an instantaneous mental picture."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I guess that's so. I see a picture of Jesus as soon as you mention
  him."</p>

  <p>"You can't help it, Andrew. And you act accordingly. That mental image is
  an actual structural part of your subconsciousness. So whatever the word
  Jesus means to you in terms of past experience becomes available to you. To
  the extent no more, and no less&mdash;that the Christ Force and the name
  Jesus are associated in your consciousness, that Force is yours&mdash;your
  own! It becomes your guide, your immediate standard of values. That is why
  it's so tremendously important to form strong mental images. Is that
  clear?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. That's another way of saying what I said. Create your mental images
  or else some charlatan'll do it for you. So Jesus&mdash;to me&mdash;is pretty
  much of a fighting cue. Right off the bat I suspect anyone who yawps about
  Jesus. It's all right as a cuss word."</p>

  <p>"You call it a fighting cue? What kind of fight? Can you tell me?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. Why not. It makes me want to vomit on the swine who've made Jesus's
  name a synonym for cruelty&mdash;lies&mdash;aggression&mdash;injustice
  &mdash;rant&mdash;cant&mdash;damned hypocrisy&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elsa's gay laugh interrupted: "Andrew, what's wrong with it? Haven't you
  won any fights?"</p>

  <p>He almost drew aside the veil over his thoughts. Almost. She felt it. But
  she felt it close again.</p>

  <p>"I've had some lickings, too," he answered.</p>

  <p>He was ready to dry up. She swiftly changed her tactics: "Andrew&mdash;
  didn't you see more than one face in the magician's chamber?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I said so."</p>

  <p>"Whose face was the other?"</p>

  <p>He didn't answer for nearly a minute. When he did, he had dismissed
  equivocation. He spoke bluntly: "It looked to me like Lobsang Pun's face."
  But then he raised his guard: "As far as I'm concerned that was a memory
  picture&mdash;from the photograph of Lobsang Pun in Nancy Strong's room in
  Darjeeling! There was even a bullet hole in the forehead."</p>

  <p>"But you admit you saw it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And Lung-gom-pa saw something too. It scared him. What I saw was a
  memory picture of Lobsang Pun. It obliterated the first face. It was like an
  eclipse. I can't explain it."</p>

  <p>"May I try to explain?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. Go ahead. But you'll have to more than explain if you want me to
  more than believe. I 'd like to know. I'm fed up with believing."</p>

  <p>"Andrew&mdash;you'll have to find this out. I had to. We all have to
  &mdash;each for himself. But we can help each other, the way Nancy Strong
  helped me, by showing which way to look."</p>

  <p>He interrupted: "Let's see if I get your thought: '... and I, if I be
  lifted up, will draw all men unto me'?&mdash;Is that the idea? I've tried it.
  I've been a horrible example of pious rectitude, courageous consistency and
  all that stuff. People don't copy you. They throw stink bombs. It's no
  good."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, please, I'm trying my very best to tell what I know."</p>

  <p>"You mean, what you believe?"</p>

  <p>"What I know! Andrew, this is what did happen. My mental image of Lobsang
  Pun, that I conceived with every scrap of will I could bring to bear, let
  into the consciousness of everyone in the room, you and me included, a
  thought force so tremendous that it overwhelmed the magician's. That dreadful
  living death mask was Lung-gom-pa's own picture of his own soul&mdash;of his
  own black mahatma&mdash;his own ideal. He projected it to arouse the vilest
  instincts of every person in the room, because he knows how to manipulate
  those. But I have been taught what to do. So I shouted for Lobsang Pun. That
  may be hard for you to believe. I shouted for him&mdash;yelled for
  help&mdash;in silence. You saw what happened."</p>

  <p>"I admit I saw his face."</p>

  <p>Elsa was into her stride. Nothing now could stop her. "You couldn't
  possibly have seen it if you hadn't concentrated your will on one thing!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? I swear to God I wasn't thinking of Lobsang Pun."</p>

  <p>"Shall I say what you were doing?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. If you think you know."</p>

  <p>"You were searching&mdash;not for the lesser evil, but for the greater
  good. Isn't it true?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I guess that's true. I've never believed in that fool doctrine of
  the lesser evil. It's defeatist, degenerate, negative, no good. It's
  Jesuitical. It leads downhill&mdash;all the way to the bottom of rotten
  politics and rot-gut religion. The hell with it. But say: are you trying to
  tell me that Lobsang Pun appeared in person and scared Lung-gom-pa and his
  brigands, just in answer to your&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh well, if you want to be cruel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I swear I didn't mean to be. Sorry, Elsa. I wouldn't hurt you for worlds.
  I know you're trying to say something important. But I happen to know that
  Old Ugly-face is a fugitive. He's running for his life. There's a price on
  his head. Morgan Lewis asked me to find him and to help him if I possibly
  can."</p>

  <p>"And you will?"</p>

  <p>"If I can, yes. Sure I will. I mean to try to find him."</p>

  <p>"Then mayn't he help us?"</p>

  <p>"How can he? He's on the lam. Down and out. Say, see here: if Lobsang Pun
  were the magician that you seem to think&mdash;who can appear when you summon
  him&mdash;he'd use his magic&mdash;wouldn't he?&mdash;to get himself out of
  the mess he's in. If he can't help himself, how can he help you and me?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, did you ever hear of superconsciousness?"</p>

  <p>"I've heard Nancy Strong speak of it."</p>

  <p>"There are subconsciousness&mdash;consciousness&mdash;and
  superconsciousness. Lung-gom-pa used black magic to project that living death
  mask face from the very depth of subconsciousness. That's where his black
  magic comes from, out of the infinite dark ocean of all the evil that ever
  was from the beginning of time until now."</p>

  <p>"That sounds like Nancy Strong talking."</p>

  <p>"Lobsang Pun derives intelligence from superconsciousness. That is to say
  not from the past, but from the future, which is all new and has nothing to
  do with the past. Become conscious of him, and his super-consciousness
  reaches us. Subconsciousness can't touch it."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't begin to explain why he's on the lam in danger of his life.
  Are you feeding me Nancy's pap about evolution?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But with, oh, what a long spoon!"</p>

  <p>He laughed, touched. But in another moment he was back at her: "It's like
  Christian Science. Too much profit and loss."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you don't know any Christian Science. And if you wish to
  understand what I'm trying to tell, you must open your mind, not think of all
  the silly secondhand objections that fools have put into your mind."</p>

  <p>"Have one more try."</p>

  <p>"Very well. This is the law. In superconsciousness, in which the Christ
  Force is, there is no such idea as profit and loss. Personal profit&mdash;
  any kind of profit&mdash;can only enter from subconsciousness. Whoever clings
  to the idea of profit can't become superconscious. It's impossible. Does that
  explain why Lobsang Pun can come to our aid spiritually, but can't help
  himself materially?"</p>

  <p>Andrew turned it over and over in his mind. He didn't answer for so long
  that Elsa at last sought for some new form of words in which to reach his
  thought.</p>

  <p>"Andrew," she said suddenly, "would you care to tell me, in strict
  confidence, why you left the United States?"</p>

  <p>It was as if the night wind had swept down a house of cards. She could
  feel him draw back into himself and slam the mental door. After a full minute
  he said: "I have never told anyone that. It's better dead and buried.&mdash;
  Do you see that low hill? That's where we'll pitch camp until the wind drops
  tomorrow evening. From there to the river is three days' hard marching. If
  we've luck we'll make it."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="part3"
     id="part3">PART THREE</a></h2>

  <h2><a name="ch41"
     id="ch41">CHAPTER 41</a></h2>

  <p class="first">One week's march north of the Shigatse, the roar of the
  flood-borne ice was still in Elsa's ears whenever she thought backward. She
  was trying to think forward. Thought wouldn't obey. It flowed backward most
  of the time, marveling at Andrew&mdash;where had he learned such super-human
  gift of leadership?&mdash;in a law office?&mdash;loving him, trying to
  understand him, baffled. The first sight of that river had seemed to set his
  heart on fire. He became a new-world Hannibal, a Caesar, compelling men and
  beasts to do what they all knew was impossible until he showed the way, and
  drove, and led. But he was far from pleased with himself. He had turned
  morose, almost speechless, kind when spoken to but doling words as if they
  hurt him: She didn't know why he suffered. She suspected herself of having
  caused it. She didn't know how.</p>

  <p>By night, under the stars, she could see, and even feel the unimportance
  of herself and of Andrew too, and of the earth and all its ways. Then they
  were less than microbes in an infinite mystery. It was comforting to feel how
  small they were. But under the tent they grew larger again. And by day there
  were no stars by which to measure the absurdity of fear.</p>

  <p>There's an irritating magnetism in the Tibetan wind at high levels. The
  aneroid registered seventeen thousand feet. The Kunlun Range was in sight
  whenever a buzz-saw wind worried the horizon clouds sufficiently to give a
  glimpse of the snow-clad peaks. It was typical Tibetan spring. You couldn't
  hear yourself shout. That increased the irritation. It was further increased
  by Bulah Singh's hostile calm&mdash;his ominous good behavior&mdash;his
  glowering look of gloating over private information that would presently
  emerge to everyone's discomfort but his own.</p>

  <p>Andrew was having hard work to keep his temper with the men. Bompo Tsering
  resented his concern for the pack animals.</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand we can't reach Tum-Glain with dead ponies?"</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun, no beating, going too slow. By-um-by coming soldiers, catching
  us, then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"See here! Next time there's a gall or a sore or a whip mark, you lose a
  day's pay. That's final."</p>

  <p>Less cruelty for a while. More miles covered in consequence. But there was
  no change in Andrew's mood. He continued to be too polite to Elsa&mdash;too
  considerate of all her possible needs except the only one that mattered. He
  revealed of his own inner consciousness nothing. Less than nothing. What he
  did apparently let slip at odd moments was merely some new phase of the veil
  that concealed tormented thought. The strain was made almost unbearable by
  their continuing to sleep together, under doubled blankets. She knew he did
  it to save her feelings, so that she shouldn't feel demoted. She couldn't
  refuse for fear of hurting his feelings; he might have thought she no longer
  trusted him. She didn't believe he believed his own excuse that Bulah Singh
  might play some trick on her if she were left alone at night. Bulah Singh was
  under constant observation by never less than two Tibetans, who delighted in
  watching him because it made themselves feel important. He was behaving
  discreetly. He had kept himself to himself ever since having been thoroughly
  snubbed at the river crossing, where Andrew had forbidden him to help or to
  give orders to anyone. He had been made to wait until the last, to be brought
  over between Andrew and Bompo Tsering&mdash;humiliated, relegated to the
  category of useless baggage. Since then he rode alone, ate alone, pitched his
  tent alone, and kept his own unsmiling counsel.</p>

  <p>But Bulah Singh's dark glance indicated he had drawn his own conclusions
  about that two-in-one-tent business. As he doubtless intended, it filled
  Andrew with glowering anger, knowing that Elsa couldn't fail to understand.
  Keeping herself tidy and good-looking in spite of difficulties, Elsa was
  desperately careful not to create the impression that her make-up was to
  please Andrew. But the Sikh's glance dourly inferred the opposite. She had to
  cold-cream her skin continually against the searing wind. But she removed the
  smear whenever possible, to escape Andrew's pity&mdash;worse, his tolerance.
  That stuff soon turns to contempt. So she studied her mirror. When each
  supper-time came she was presentable. By bedtime she was even almost pleased
  with her own appearance. Andrew would need another excuse than physical
  distaste for keeping away. But the Sikh could draw his own
  inferences&mdash;or pretend to. He did.</p>

  <p>And the strange thing was that Andrew didn't keep away. That was one of
  the comforting things about him. By candlelight, in the tent, under the
  blankets, he began to thaw out and become human, giving a little of his
  confidence, even sometimes speaking first without being questioned,
  volunteering conversation. When his physical muscles relaxed on the air
  mattress, his mental strain seemed to let go simultaneously. He never shrank
  away from her or seemed self-conscious. She got a sensation then that he
  wasn't so nervously on guard against trap questions. He was trusting her. So
  she was extra careful, silently rehearsing words before she said them,
  testing each phrase to be sure it shouldn't sound like an entering wedge.</p>

  <p>But except for short moments and trifling details his reserve held, until
  one night when he sat up suddenly under the candle-lantern listening to the
  whining yowl of a snow leopard, answered by its mate from not far off. The
  pair were prowling around the camp, calling to each other, trying to scare
  loose a sheep or a young yak. But Bompo Tsering was making the rounds. He
  came and reported the animals all secure, Bulah Singh in his tent, and the
  watchmen awake. After that the Tibetans kept up a devil's clatter of camel
  bells and tin cans. Someone sang to the yaks to keep them from stampeding.
  Sleep was impossible. Andrew didn't even lie down again. He sat, elbows on
  knees, head between his hands, looking dejected. It might be an opportunity.
  Elsa at last threw caution to the winds and seized it:</p>

  <p>"Andrew&mdash;would it help to talk? Being listened to is sometimes a
  great help."</p>

  <p>He didn't answer. But during the pause she felt no sharp reaction&mdash;
  no sudden retreat into his inner self. She dared again, carefully:</p>

  <p>"Andrew, it's sometimes said that great leaders don't appreciate what they
  have done. It seems all small to them and disappointing. But I can't believe
  many of them ever took it as badly as you do."</p>

  <p>His reserve broke down a little. But he was captious because she had more
  than hinted at praise.</p>

  <p>"You're not calling me great?" he suggested. He laughed dryly, to take the
  edge off rudeness. "I ask just to be sure you're in your right mind."</p>

  <p>That gave her the idea. She put spunk into it, and came back at him:
  "Don't flatter yourself. I'm trying to point out what a little-minded man you
  are, in spite of all your bigness in some ways."</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean?"</p>

  <p>That was a fair question. He was startled&mdash;touched&mdash; interested.
  Elsa cut loose:</p>

  <p>"Any man I ever heard of, except you, who was big enough to do what you've
  done, would have been big enough to chest himself, and thank whatever Gods
  there be, and even brag a little for the sake of his companions. After all,
  we all believed in you. That's how and why you got us safely across the
  Shigatse without losing a man or a load, and only one pony. You're our hero.
  Haven't we a right to see the leader we trusted look at least a bit proud of
  himself? Are we nothing? Is it worth nothing that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted with another of his dry laughs. "I get you. There's a lot
  in what you say. Yes. I know, I've been difficult."</p>

  <p>"Difficult? You've been ungracious and contemptible. You haven't had
  enough grace to thank your own soul for the privilege of playing the
  man!"</p>

  <p>He laughed, not sourly this time. She had touched his humor.</p>

  <p>"But you don't understand," he retorted lamely.</p>

  <p>"I know I don't. I wish I did."</p>

  <p>"Did you never feel your own soul mocking you?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew! How can you ask that question with a straight face? Have you no
  memory? Or are you pretending to forget, just to be polite?"</p>

  <p>"I guess I know what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Indeed you can't help knowing. How long is it since I was hopeless
  in Darjeeling? If it hadn't been for you and your strong friendship I don't
  like to think what might have happened."</p>

  <p>"You don't have to think about it," he answered. "It didn't happen."</p>

  <p>She had another flash of inspiration. She bit back the retort that almost
  left her lips. "It didn't happen," she said, "because I had you to talk
  to."</p>

  <p>He thought that over. Suddenly he said: "Is that an invitation?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Let me do for you perhaps a fraction of what you did for me."</p>

  <p>"Okay. I accept. If it'll make you feel better, I'll tell you what's
  burning me up. But it's for your ears only. And it won't bear
  contradiction."</p>

  <p>"I won't contradict. And I promise I'll never tell anyone else in the
  world."</p>

  <p>"You won't want to, if you hear me through to a finish."</p>

  <p>"I will listen, Andrew. I won't interrupt."</p>

  <p>"You brought this on yourself, remember. I didn't ask you to listen."</p>

  <p>"I know you didn't. I asked you. Do you want me to sit upright?"</p>

  <p>"No. Lie where you are and keep warm under the blankets. If I bore you,
  you can fall asleep."</p>

  <p>She turned over, away from him, snuggling down so that he couldn't see
  even the tip of her nose in the candlelight. She felt she couldn't waits for
  him to begin. But she had to. He sat a long time, listening to the leopards
  and to the noises the Tibetans made. He seemed unable to force himself to lay
  bare his thought. But he plunged in suddenly at last:</p>

  <p>"I'll tell it all. But please don't talk back. There are two reasons why
  I'll carry on to the end of this job. One is that I passed my word to Tom
  Grayne. Maybe you don't know it, but Tom happens to be ranking Number One, in
  Asia, on the U.S. secret list. Tom isn't the kind of man that one lets
  down."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever let anyone down?"</p>

  <p>"Did we agree you'd listen?"</p>

  <p>"Sorry."</p>

  <p>"Most people think a Number One secret agent's the same as a spy. He
  isn't. All spies are rats. Every last damned one of them. There isn't a spy
  in the world, from a cabinet minister or a full-blown general, all the way
  down to a Wop peepshow guide in Marseilles, who wouldn't sell out his own
  crowd for his own profit. Never forget that, because it's true. The more a
  big bug uses spies and believes in 'em the more he himself is corrupt or a
  stupid fool or both. You can buy anything he knows or thinks he knows from
  any spy in the world, and you can blackmail it out of any spy-master. Spying
  and self-respect can't live together under the same scalp. No self-respecting
  man is a spy. No spy has any self-respect. A spy is a stinker who peeps
  through keyholes, and pilfers, and betrays, not necessarily for money. Some
  of 'em do it for excitement and for the feeling of importance it gives
  'em.</p>

  <p>"But a Number One secret agent is different, and Tom is head and shoulders
  above all of 'em. Tom does no dirty work. His job is to find out what is
  really going on beneath the surface, beneath the tides of diplomatic bushwa,*
  that might start the Continental armies marching&mdash;and perhaps drag
  America in. Tom is out for the truth that's somewhere down underneath the
  cowardly treachery and lies of the world's so-called statesmen and their
  toadies. I mean the men who make the headlines. Most of the world's big shots
  are merely ignorant crooks. Some of 'em know what they're lying about. But
  they're all unscrupulous. They're criminals in fancy dress. There isn't one
  so-called statesman or diplomat in the whole world whose word of honor is
  worth more than Bulah Singh's. Some of 'em can put on a better front, and
  that's all.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>bushwa</i>&mdash;rubbishy nonsense; baloney; bull.
  <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/bushwa"><i>Random House
  Unabridged Dictionary</i></a>. ]</p>

  <p>"So why is Tom Grayne in Tibet? Nine-tenths of the world's ruling men
  don't even know where it is. Tibet cause a world war? Or be a key to world
  victory? A fine laugh that 'ud give 'em. But it's the truth. Tibet and
  Jerusalem are two of the three surprises in store for the stinkers who're
  running us all into hell."</p>

  <p>"What is the third one?"</p>

  <p>"Russia."</p>

  <p>"You mean Communism?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't. Communism is a mental sickness that will hardly outlast
  Stalin. But I was talking about Tibet. Tom Grayne has been all winter long in
  that cave in the side of a cliff in the Kunlun Mountains, to get the lowdown
  on what's moving below the surface. Being the man he is, I bet he knows more
  now than anyone else guesses. But he must be tightening his belt. If I can
  keep our overloaded animals on their feet, there's a chance of our reaching
  him within a week or ten days."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, from now on it's nothing compared to that river."</p>

  <p>"We'll make it. We'll deliver the goods. But what then? I'll tell you.
  It'll be purely personal, between me and Tom Grayne. No one else in the whole
  cockeyed world will owe me as much as thank you."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I'd take thanks as an insult. Tom Grayne's on the level and I've helped
  him personally, man to man. He'll turn his information in to a man in
  Washington who's also on the level, although less so than Tom. By 'on the
  level' I mean he doesn't try to steer other people or other nations into
  trouble for his own profit. But from him on downward until it reaches the
  daily papers, every word that Tom turns in will be used and fouled and
  perverted by every double-crossing political sharp who believes he sees a
  chance to enrich himself. That's the hell of it. That's why I'm
  bellyaching."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, aren't there any honest politicians?"</p>

  <p>"No. Every last one of them, in every country in the world, is a
  professional liar, thief, hypocrite, charlatan, crook, double-crosser&mdash;
  in plain words, a phony. An honest man couldn't last a week in any important
  political job. If he were even half honest, he wouldn't accept the job in the
  first place."</p>

  <p>"How about your national hero Abraham Lincoln?"</p>

  <p>"He was shot for trying to be honest. Lincoln came mighty close to being
  an exception. He was honest with himself, which is more than half the fight.
  I learned my stuff straight from him. It was Lincoln's own statement that you
  can't be honest and remain a politician, that first set me off thinking about
  it."</p>

  <p>"But, Andrew, you're not in politics."</p>

  <p>"You bet I'm not. I'd give my life, right now, this minute, to be done in
  by any torture anyone can think of, if I could make my blessed idiotic
  country wake up to what politics are&mdash;if I could make 'em look&mdash;
  think&mdash;understand that politics has landed all the swine on top and all
  the decent men and women underneath."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, how terrible you make it sound."</p>

  <p>"It isn't terrible. It's sickening. It gives me a bellyache. I get no
  pleasure out of knowing that every lick of work I do on this expedition will
  be turned to some rotten purpose by a conceited liar in Washington, or
  Whitehall, or Paris&mdash;Berlin&mdash;Rome&mdash;the Hague."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you glad to be blocking the Japanese?"</p>

  <p>"They're no worse than we are. I f that's a compliment, they're welcome to
  it. We&mdash;I mean the rest of the world&mdash;taught 'em all they know
  about lip-service to ideals along with practical treachery, cruelty, robbery,
  lechery and every crime there is. I expect you don't get my point. The
  trouble with me is, that I'm fed up. I have absolutely no respect for anyone,
  from king or president, pope or labor leader, down to the ten-year-old Wop
  doing the goosestep like a monkey in one of Mussolini's uniforms&mdash;who
  tries to gain his own ends by lying propaganda and force or threat of force.
  I've no more use for the rotters who toady to dictators and praise them, than
  I have for the dictators and political bosses themselves."</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment or two, as if reviewing what he had said. Then
  suddenly:</p>

  <p>"My country 'tis of thee! O God! If I could make my beloved country wake
  up and look at itself! If I could make it only try to be the land it brags of
  being! But how? God damn it, who can make it wake up&mdash;with all those
  scoundrels drugging it to sleep? If I were a Shakespeare or a Milton, they'd
  use my words to prove the opposite of what I mean!"</p>

  <p>He couldn't stand it any longer. He crawled out of the tent and made a
  round of inspection with his flashlight. Bompo Tsering begged him not to
  shoot the snow leopards, saying they were undoubtedly the souls of greedy
  lamas who had charged high fees for blessings:</p>

  <p>"Their must living this way too long, then by-um-by, come 'nother life,
  their being then maybe beginning way up once more."</p>

  <p>"Okay. They shall have a life on you. You get the point? If they kill a
  pony or a sheep, you pay for it!"</p>

  <p>"No, no! No, no! That not being&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then watch carefully! Keep your snow-white lama-leopards out of
  camp."</p>

  <p>The cold, still night air was making Andrew feel better, or perhaps he had
  worked something out of his system. He passed by Bulah Singh's tent, making
  sure that Bulah Singh's mule was properly blanketed and tied so that the
  leopards couldn't scare him loose. Bulah Singh was awake, seated in the tent
  opening on a packing case, in Andrew's spare overcoat, smoking a pipe he had
  borrowed from Bompo Tsering. Andrew passed him the time of night:</p>

  <p>"Have you enough tobacco-matches?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, thanks. It's a fine night, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh could make a very ordinary statement sound like treason.
  Andrew stood sniffing the frosty air, eyeing the moon, feeling the
  weather.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered. "Fine now. There'll be a storm tomorrow. We'll start
  early. Turn in and get some sleep."</p>

  <p>He passed along, not even trying to hear what Bulah Singh muttered. But
  before he crawled back into the tent, where he thought Elsa was asleep, she
  lay so still, he watched the Sikh for half a minute, still seated facing the
  moon. He had an idea it would be a good thing to know what the Sikh was
  thinking about. He hesitated&mdash;almost returned to talk to him. It was
  Elsa who changed his mind:</p>

  <p>"Don't, Andrew! Don't! I can read your thought! If the men should see you
  talking to Bulah Singh they'd think you've forgiven him! It might be fatal!
  It might give him a chance to win them over to some&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew's bulk blotted out the moonlight as he crawled into the tent.</p>

  <p>"I'm hoping," he said, "rather against hope, that Bulah Singh will escape.
  I've even thought of putting a supply of food where he can steal it. I know
  he has money."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch42"
     id="ch42">CHAPTER 42</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The tent flap closed behind him. "So you can read my
  thought?" He sounded difficult again&mdash;on guard&mdash;irritated. Elsa
  wished with all her heart she hadn't spoken. Now she must answer. She was
  tempted to lie&mdash; decided not to&mdash;spoke calmly:</p>

  <p>"I could. At that moment, I couldn't help it. You see, Andrew, you've been
  trying to help me to understand you. Then you thought about me in connection
  with Bulah Singh. And he thought about both of us. It produced a
  condition."</p>

  <p>"Condition, eh? What was he thinking about? Could you tell that?"</p>

  <p>Andrew was kneeling, facing the candle-lantern. He tried to see her face.
  He couldn't. Elsa waited until he had rolled in under the blankets before she
  answered:</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh hasn't let up on me once, for one single waking moment, since
  we left the magician's village."</p>

  <p>"How d'you mean&mdash;let up on you?"</p>

  <p>"He projects the image of himself, continually, so that he's always in
  front of my mind, between me and what I wish to think about."</p>

  <p>"Oh well, all right, that settles it. I daren't give that buzzard a
  weapon. He'd use it to kill me. So he shall go without. At daybreak he gets
  rations for himself and his mule&mdash;and marching orders."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, must you? It might be a mistake. And it wouldn't affect the
  mental tricks he could play. A few miles makes no difference."</p>

  <p>"No. I suppose not. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nor a few hundred miles."</p>

  <p>"Can you shake it off? Can't you refuse to see it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't have to. If I let it stay, and just think higher, it makes him
  defeat his own purpose."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand."</p>

  <p>"May I try to explain?"</p>

  <p>"Shoot. I'm listening."</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh's purpose is to compel me to do all my thinking with him in
  mind. Something like the way a nun in a convent should do all her thinking
  with her special saint in mind&mdash;only that the nun should act
  voluntarily, whereas I'd be forced. That way he would gradually get control
  of my thought&mdash;altogether qualify it&mdash;so that in the end &mdash;and
  it wouldn't be long&mdash;I'd be hypnotized, like Du Maurier's Trilby."</p>

  <p>Andrew growled disgustedly: "That's how all the propagandist&mdash;
  priest&mdash;politicians do their dirty work! You don't feel it's getting
  you?"</p>

  <p>It could get her&mdash;it could wear her down, unless Andrew would help.
  But she was afraid to confess weakness, so she spoke more confidently than
  she felt: "I was shown at Gombaria's how not to let it. But Bulah Singh
  believes his will is conquering mine, so that he'll be able to dictate my
  thought and make me obey his will when the convenient moment comes."</p>

  <p>"God damn him and his moments!" Andrew sat up again, elbow on knees.
  "Sorry," he said. "I didn't mean to interrupt. Go ahead. Talk."</p>

  <p>A flurry of night wind blew the tent flap. Andrew reached for the flap,
  secured it and lay down again. Elsa waited at least another minute before she
  asked: "Can't you yourself see him now?"</p>

  <p>He surprised her by answering without noticeable change in his voice. "I
  guess I'm beginning to see what you see."</p>

  <p>"Is he the way he was when you last saw him, a few minutes ago?"</p>

  <p>"No. He has moved. It's like a glimpse through binoculars&mdash;close
  up."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure it's not just memory?"</p>

  <p>"Memory, hell! It's one of those damned vision things, like a waking
  dream, only more vivid. He's moving." Then sharply: "It isn't you doing
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed it isn't."</p>

  <p>"It's damned strange," said Andrew. "D'you know&mdash;" he laughed
  apologetically. She had never heard him do that before. He sounded guilty of
  something: "It's like when you're in love and the beloved's face keeps coming
  between you and what you're trying to read or write or think about."</p>

  <p>For a moment that almost stunned her, not like being hit, like having cold
  darkness descend suddenly. She had to fight it off. She had to remember
  Andrew wasn't her lover. She had no right to demand he shouldn't be some
  other woman's. But for a numbed heartbeat it leadened the whole universe,
  until suddenly he spoke again and she knew he wasn't thinking of any woman.
  "God damn his impudence! Is that murdering swine trying to make me like
  him?"</p>

  <p>That gave her a chance to recover and to resume the conversation where it
  left off: "Andrew, I'm simply praying for the right words. So will you help
  me by trying hard to understand?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. You tell it. I'll try to get you."</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh knows he can't possibly make you like him. The only way he
  can control you is to make you angry. Ordinary methods fail. So he's sending
  you homosexual suggestions."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be damned! Are you serious? You mean he thinks he'll get to
  first base with that stuff?"</p>

  <p>"You see, he knows what will irritate you. You do notice a change in your
  attitude toward him?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to shoot him."</p>

  <p>"You won't&mdash;will you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know why not."</p>

  <p>"You do feel an urge to act violently?"</p>

  <p>Silence.</p>

  <p>"Hate him?"</p>

  <p>Again silence. Andrew was playing fair, listening with inner ears,
  checking up as he went along, rejecting nothing, doing his best to
  understand. "I've noticed this," he conceded after a few moments, "I have
  been getting curious to know what he's thinking about."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, if he can get you curious enough, and make you hate him at the
  same time, he'll be able to make you make the mistake he's counting on, at
  the moment that he's waiting for."</p>

  <p>"Do you think you know what he's counting on?"</p>

  <p>"No. I can't read him that deeply&mdash;partly because I'm afraid to look.
  He has a mind like an octopus. But it's something soon&mdash;that's coming. I
  don't quite know myself what I mean by that, but there's a suggestion of
  movement toward you and me&mdash;something coming."</p>

  <p>"God Almighty! I wish this vague stuff didn't go to my fists! It makes me
  want to get out there and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, that's just what Bulah Singh wants. He knows you won't kill him.
  I think he wants you to give him provisions and drive him out of camp."</p>

  <p>"But why on earth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've told you. I don't know why&mdash;except that of course he knows he
  can't escape unless you let him. He wants to get away&mdash;in order to turn
  on you&mdash;probably to kill you."</p>

  <p>"It beats me how he expects to go about it."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I think he has learned something secret from you and me since we
  left the magician's village."</p>

  <p>"He can't have. I haven't shared a thought with him! I haven't spoken to
  him more than bare civilities."</p>

  <p>"Neither have I. But it's something he learned from us. He doesn't know
  anything about superconsciousness&mdash;or I think he doesn't."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes you do, Andrew. But he doesn't. Subconsciousness is his field. He
  is rather expert."</p>

  <p>"He's a charlatan."</p>

  <p>"But rather expert."</p>

  <p>"Have it your own way."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, the subconsciousness is like a dark ocean, in which all the
  knowledge and experience of the entire human race is stored. It can be read
  by anyone who knows how. It can be made stormy, too, by people who know how.
  But normally it's like a pool of ink. Then, sometimes, it reflects
  superconsciousness. That's how secrets get out."</p>

  <p>Andrew set his teeth. He retorted irritably: "But for God's sake, if you
  and I don't know a secret in the first place, how in hell can Bulah Singh
  learn it from us?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I want to tell you what I know, so that you can add to it what
  you know and so keep out of danger."</p>

  <p>He checked a retort, remembering his own experience in Gombaria's
  monastery, when vision after vision appeared before his eyes. Now, again, he
  could see Bulah Singh, seated in the opening of his tent, facing the moon,
  smoking, looking pleased with some dark thought.</p>

  <p>"Yes, please, let's hear it," he said after a moment. After a longer pause
  Elsa found she couldn't say it lying down. She sat up beside him:</p>

  <p>"Subconsciousness mostly subsists of itself&mdash;of and for itself. It's
  what Jesus called a liar and the father of it. But sometimes it reflects the
  superconsciousness, the way the surface of an asphalt lake might reflect the
  moon or lightning. So the dark magicians receive warning that something new
  is stirring in the higher consciousness of someone else. Andrew, that's how
  real spying is done. It sounds so utterly absurd to conservative-minded
  people, that they never even suspect what really happens."</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed resignedly: "I don't say I believe. 'Help thou mine
  unbelief.' Try again."</p>

  <p>"Don't try to accept it too literally&mdash;I mean about the reflection in
  the pool and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Okay. Each makes his own picture, I guess&mdash;and there are no
  words."</p>

  <p>"But do you feel you're beginning to understand?"</p>

  <p>"I'm listening, anyhow. But make it snappy. We've got to get a move on
  before daybreak, so's to cover as many miles as possible before the weather
  stops us."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, how d'you know there'll be a storm?"</p>

  <p>He thought that over a moment. Then he laughed. "Bull's-eye! I read it in
  the New York Times.&mdash;I get you. You mean: I read it in the
  subconscious?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. A spark of superconsciousness&mdash;a flash of intuition from your
  own soul&mdash;warned you to look. Is there any sign of a storm?"</p>

  <p>"No, there isn't. Not even the aneroid&mdash;yet. All the same, there'll
  be one, and the pack animals know it."</p>

  <p>"Of course they know. Animals are always watching the subconscious, where
  all their instinctive knowledge comes from. They read the subconscious
  quicker than almost any humans can. But the black magicians read it with more
  skill."</p>

  <p>"Easy! You'll be snarled in a minute. Are you trying to kid me that Bulah
  Singh, and the black magicians, and all the political hypnotists and public
  liars in the world are at the same stage of evolution with ponies and
  yaks?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. As long as we're alive, we all exist in the ocean of
  subconsciousness. But it's consciousness that marks our stage of evolution.
  Is your consciousness the same as Hitler's or Bulah Singh's or a Chicago
  gangster's? The consciousness is measurable by its relative receptivity to
  superconsciousness. The more soul, the higher the evolution. The less soul,
  the lower. That is the measure of real intelligence. Any person who denies
  the soul's existence, simply denies his own being, that's all. It has nothing
  whatever to do with brains or mere cleverness. A person could know
  everything, and command armies, or be a superscientist and discover wonderful
  things without having a spark of real intelligence. If real intelligence were
  a function of the physical brain, or if true genius were related to the
  subconscious, you'd have to call Judas Iscariot and Pontius Pilate more
  intelligent than Jesus: Hitler more intelligent than Thomas Mann or Einstein:
  Mussolini more intelligent than Toscanini. People like Hitler and Bulah Singh
  and old Lung-gom-pa are stone blind to the direct light of
  superconsciousness. But they can see it indirectly on the subconscious
  mirror. And they're alert. They're clever. Not intelligent-clever, like the
  war lords who convert dye into poison gas."</p>

  <p>Andrew snorted: "Like the holy Joes who convert religion, and the shysters
  who convert the law into a shame and a byword! Like the lick-spit flunky
  scientists who 'yes' Stalin and Hitler!" He was hardly aware he had spoken.
  Elsa waited for him to say more, but he didn't.</p>

  <p>"Whenever someone receives a gleam of superconsciousness, it is reflected,
  something like moonlight, on the surface of the universal subconscious pool.
  There the haters perceive it, indirectly. The receivers of the superconscious
  light, who don't understand, because it's new, become like the Three Magi in
  the Bible story. They have faith, and they follow the light. But the lovers
  of subconsciousness become like Herod, in the same story. They hate the
  light. They start massacres&mdash;war&mdash;to prevent the coming of
  superconsciousness that they know instinctively, will utterly destroy their
  kingdoms.&mdash;Have I made that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Gosh!" he answered, "if it's true, it would explain why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, Andrew, it only hints, and suggests. It doesn't explain. It can't be
  phrased dogmatically. It can't be materialized on a basis of profit and loss.
  Only the definition-mongers, the splitters of hairs, the materialists&mdash;
  the criminals&mdash;and the people who believe that death is the end of
  everything&mdash;can fool themselves into believing they can explain it."</p>

  <p>"Well, see here. If you can't explain it to me, what's the use of&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>"Listen, Andrew. You and I have touched superconsciousness. It touched
  us."</p>

  <p>"You mean you did. It touched you. I don't even know what it is."</p>

  <p>"The bright light, that will take care of us at the proper moment, lighted
  our subconsciousness and let the watchers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who d'you mean&mdash;watchers?"</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh, for instance. Also others&mdash;lots of others."</p>

  <p>"Okay. Let's keep it personal. You say it let Bulah Singh&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It let him read something that our subconsciousness reflected from
  superconsciousness. There, is that clear?"</p>

  <p>"I'll be damned if it is. Why couldn't we read it?"</p>

  <p>"I believe I can read it," she answered. "But I can't believe it. Or I'd
  rather put it this way. I know I couldn't possibly make you believe it. You
  would think me crazy. So I'm afraid to tell you."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would tell. I guarantee one thing: even if I don't understand,
  I'll know you're trying to tell the truth."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you can be wonderfully comforting at unexpected moments!"</p>

  <p>"What do you think you can see?"</p>

  <p>"Lobsang Pun!"</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I mean just that, and nothing else. We're near him."</p>

  <p>"You mean physically near?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You're not talking about his projected image?"</p>

  <p>"I am talking about Lobsang Pun, coming toward us&mdash;now&mdash;
  near."</p>

  <p>"It can't be," he answered. "We've made a wider circuit around Lhasa than
  we should have, hoping to pick up news of him. But it's no go. I've figured
  it out. If he's on the lam and they haven't caught him, he must be scores of
  miles away&mdash;perhaps hundreds&mdash;perhaps headed toward India."</p>

  <p>Elsa insisted: "I can see Lobsang Pun! Andrew! He doesn't want to be seen.
  You and I mustn't recognize him! Look! Look!"</p>

  <p>"I can't see a thing!"</p>

  <p>"That was a plain message!"</p>

  <p>"What was?"</p>

  <p>"He put a finger to his lips. He shook his head. We're not to recognize
  him!"</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"When we meet&mdash;soon&mdash;I think very soon."</p>

  <p>"Hell, are you and I going crazy? Well, all right&mdash;if we do meet him,
  that should be simple enough."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, there's a big price on Lobsang Pun's head!"</p>

  <p>"I know there is."</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh knows it! And Bulah Singh knows we are very soon going to
  meet Lobsang Pun!"</p>

  <p>"Are you really sure he knows?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I'll go the rounds again. I'll soon find out."</p>

  <p>"Andrew&mdash;better not speak to him. Isn't it better to let Bulah Singh
  believe we don't suspect him?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe you're right. I'll go and talk to the men. Just a second while I
  look at the time. Thought so. We'll be breaking camp by lantern light, in two
  hours. Do you think you can get two hours' sleep? You're going to need
  it."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, after all those days of grumpiness, you've been so kind again all
  at once, that I could do anything! I feel like singing! But&mdash;yes
  &mdash;I can sleep&mdash;I know I can."</p>

  <p>"Good. You don't have to worry. I won't talk to Bulah Singh. I'll try not
  to wake you when I come back. Good night."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch43"
     id="ch43">CHAPTER 43</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The storm turned up about an hour late. Soon the snow began
  drifting like waves on a wild sea. Sheep can't tackle that stuff. The
  overloaded yaks and ponies couldn't carry the sheep; so Andrew and the
  Tibetans had to do it, wherever the sheep couldn't follow the ponies through
  the drifts. They hadn't made more than two miles by noon. Then Bompo Tsering
  was for calling a halt. But there would be less snow on the wind-swept
  ledges, and the ledges wouldn't come, one had to go to them; so Andrew had
  his own way about carrying on for a couple more hours. But then suddenly
  Bompo Tsering, who was leading, said they were surrounded by dugpas. The
  column halted. Elsa rode her pony in the way of Bulah Singh's to prevent the
  Sikh from crowding forward. Andrew showed Bompo Tsering his automatic and the
  head-man agreed, as every Tibetan does, that an automatic pistol is excellent
  magic. But he said he had never seen a dead dugpa. He suggested that a bullet
  could go straight through a dugpa's heart without hurting him. Dugpas, he
  said, could make a lot of trouble by making the animals go lame, even if they
  didn't do worse things. He said the wise course was to bivouac and say plenty
  of prayers. He pulled the prayer wheel out of his bokkus and spun it
  furiously.</p>

  <p>So Andrew showed him the aneroid in its neat leather case and said it was
  an infallible protection against all sorts of devils. He even told him the
  names of the master magicians who made it&mdash;showed him their names on the
  face of the dial&mdash;pronounced them for him. Bompo Tsering admitted that
  Negretti and Zambra sounded wonderful. But he stuck to his prayer wheel. He
  smiled courteously. And then he demonstrated beyond any doubt in his own mind
  that Andrew was a silly foreign devil who didn't know what he was talking
  about.</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun," he said, "your talking too much. Now your looking. There being
  too many dugpas. Not going away. Keeping on coming."</p>

  <p>He was right. And they did look like ghosts. The whirling snow was black
  against the sky, shot through and through with lurid gray where the wind tore
  gaps that let dim light through. The ghosts approached from the moaning gloom
  of that storm, led by a tall one who rode the ghost of a pony. The others
  staggered behind him, on foot. Andrew went out to meet them. Bompo Tsering
  ordered a bivouac the second his back was turned and then ran to help two of
  the men who were at grips with Bulah Singh. The Sikh had tried to plunge past
  Elsa through a snowdrift. Elsa cried aloud for help. They seized the Sikh's
  reins and off-saddled him, so that he lay on his back looking upward, full of
  anger but&mdash;as concerned dignity&mdash;lost. Elsa followed Andrew and
  drew rein beside him.</p>

  <p>"I think Bulah Singh knows who is coming," she said. "He tried to snatch
  my automatic and go over to them. But Bompo Tsering is loyal."</p>

  <p>"He's what he calls loyal," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>There were thirteen ghosts, twelve of them walking. They all looked like
  Tibetans. They all looked half dead, famished, including the pony ridden by
  their leader. Andrew and Elsa waited for them in the lee of a gray rock,
  where the drift was shallow and it was easier to speak. The leader got off
  his pony because Bompo Tsering shouted to him to do it or be pulled off. He
  was dressed like a nobleman, full of assured self-importance. But he had none
  of the take-it-for-granted authority that clings, even in adversity, like an
  invisible skin to a man of real breeding. If he had had, Bompo Tsering would
  never have dared to tell him to mind his manners. In a voice as hoarse as a
  frog's, he demanded Andrew's name.</p>

  <p>Elsa whispered: "Bad accent! Careful!"</p>

  <p>So instead of telling his name, Andrew let him see the butt of an
  automatic and asked what he wanted. He was pretty arrogant about demanding
  food at once, but that might have been due to hunger; empty stomachs aren't
  always polite. He ordered his ragged followers to keep their distance as if
  they were dirt. They obeyed him&mdash;one especially&mdash;without a trace of
  enthusiasm. Andrew kept an eye on that one man; he seemed neither to resent
  the leader's ill manners nor to care about him one way or the other; he
  looked as ugly as the devil&mdash;a big man in peasant's clothing.</p>

  <p>Andrew spoke under his breath: "They're a bum-looking lot."</p>

  <p>Elsa answered: "They are those we saw coming!"</p>

  <p>"You mean, you saw coming! You watch 'em while I do the honors."</p>

  <p>It seldom pays to cut the ceremonial in Tibet. Andrew knew the routine
  phrases. He and the insolent leader expressed the customary happiness at
  meeting each other. Meanwhile Bompo Tsering and his men made themselves
  polite to the others and found out all about their weapons. Then they set to
  pitching a bivouac, making a lean-to of spread-out tents in no time. They had
  saved plenty of yak-dung fuel; and the conditions are hardly imaginable in
  which Tibetans can't make tea, salted and greasy with rancid butter. There
  was a yak's leg, tolerably rotten and therefore easy to eat. One doesn't have
  to worry about bad meat at that altitude; lucky to get what you get. Bompo
  Tsering whispered to Elsa, and she told Andrew how many automatics, how many
  revolvers.</p>

  <p>Andrew played host with his back to the lean-to and Elsa beside him.
  Before long the strangers were all doing their duty by hunks of yak meat and
  barley bread. They guzzled, as if they hadn't eaten for days. There was one
  man who kept the lower part of his face covered, except when he thought
  Andrew wasn't looking. He avoided Andrew. He had very intelligent eyes, but
  they looked barren, as if even evil would not ripen in the thought behind
  them. It would windfall, rotten from within. Twice Andrew spotted him reading
  signals from Bulah Singh, who was at pains, when he thought Andrew wasn't
  looking, to reveal that he had been deprived of his weapons.</p>

  <p>Again Andrew whispered to Elsa, if one could call it a whisper that
  pierces a Tibetan wind:</p>

  <p>"That big bozo, who keeps himself to himself at the far end?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you know! Remember: don't recognize him!"</p>

  <p>He thought that over, watching his guests, especially their leader. He
  disliked the man, despised him. Presently he opened a can of salmon and set
  it down between himself and Elsa. The leader perked up like an ape at sight
  of a banana. There were only two who took no notice: the big man at the far
  end and another who sat next to him. The big ugly man had a long rosary under
  his coat and kept flicking the beads. The man beside him appeared to be
  dying. A Tibetan, like a camel, when he decides to die, does it. He chooses
  almost any old place for the job. The big ugly man appeared to know his
  friend wanted to die and to be bawling him out. The storm was making too much
  noise to hear what he said, but it looked as if the other man didn't dare to
  answer back. The dying man didn't eat, he only sipped tea.</p>

  <p>Andrew whispered to Elsa: "If that's your fat friend, can't he recognize
  you?"</p>

  <p>Elsa didn't speak. She didn't know what to answer.</p>

  <p>The ape-faced leader, seated near Andrew, gorged himself, said nothing,
  and kept staring at the opened tin of salmon. He didn't eat like a nobleman,
  nor behave like one in any other way. He seemed much too conscious of the
  fine texture of the beautiful black clothing that he wore under his fur-lined
  coat. He was dressed like a High Lama. A genuine Tibetan lama might have made
  things rather awkward. But he wasn't genuine. And he was lost. He hadn't the
  slightest idea where he was. He wanted to be told without having to ask.
  Andrew didn't tell him. Meanwhile, he kept greedily eyeing that opened can of
  salmon. Presently Andrew nudged Elsa to follow and went out to look at the
  storm, taking the salmon with him.</p>

  <p>It was a blisterer, growing worse. There was nothing for it but to stay
  where they were, even at the risk of running short of fodder for the animals.
  The ponies were on full rations, but now there was an extra pony to feed, and
  it wasn't strong enough to carry a full load.</p>

  <p>"This doesn't look too good," said Andrew. "Several of those men are well
  armed. They've all got automatics, excepting the two at the far end. One of
  those two is dying. The other is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elsa interrupted: "Don't name him! Don't breathe his name!"</p>

  <p>"All right, all right! But get the hang of this. Their leader's a phony.
  He's a false front."</p>

  <p>"He isn't a real lama," said Elsa. "He can't be. But he's wearing the
  clothes of a very important one."</p>

  <p>"The important man," said Andrew, "is the fellow who keeps his face half
  covered. I know who he is. But I don't want him to know I recognize him."</p>

  <p>"Then don't breathe his name, either. Thoughts escape, Andrew. Give them a
  name and they go leaping from one to another."</p>

  <p>"Right. Mum's the word. Our business&mdash;yours and mine&mdash;is to keep
  that man and Bulah Singh from joining up to bump me off and grab you and our
  supplies. I've noticed eyes on you. You're loot." Elsa didn't feel like loot.
  She felt tremendously excited. But it was no time to argue the point. "We can
  trust Bompo Tsering," she said.</p>

  <p>"Up to his limit, we can. But what is his limit? We need friends. I'll
  make a bid right now."</p>

  <p>Andrew signaled. Bompo Tsering noticed it after the second or third
  attempt and came out.</p>

  <p>"Tell that big ugly old man at the far end I want to talk to him. Ask him
  to come out here."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering didn't like doing it. His superstition stiffened. He put up
  quite an argument, shouting into Andrew's ear against the storm. He said it
  was very unwise to talk to mysterious strangers, who might turn out to be
  bandits, or perhaps Chinese soldiers in disguise, which would be even worse.
  Then, as if to change the subject, or else fishing for a bribe:</p>

  <p>"What your soon now doing with that salmon, Gunnigun? Your not wanting, my
  wanting too much!"</p>

  <p>Andrew playfully missed him with a right hook. He obeyed then, sticking
  out his tongue by way of gratitude, too well knowing how that fist could hurt
  when Andrew aimed it straight.</p>

  <p>"Andrew, what is your idea?"</p>

  <p>"I'll give your man a chance to admit who he is. Watch him."</p>

  <p>It was worth watching. Ugly-face showed no surprise; he merely shoved his
  dying friend into a more comfortable position, tucked his rosary under his
  coat and got up, as self-possessed as a bishop. He had to pass in front of
  the entire party. The leader made angry gestures and ordered him back to his
  place. Ugly-face walked past him with the humility of a monarch doing penance
  with peas in his boots. The leader struck him. He took no more notice of that
  than he did of the wind. He came and stood in front of Andrew with his back
  to his own party, ignoring Elsa as if she didn't exist. He waited for Andrew
  to speak first.</p>

  <p>Andrew didn't like to stare at him too hard. Of course, he could be a
  Tibetan, though he had never seen one who resembled him. He was big and big-
  bellied. The shape of his head was something like an owl's, and he had a nose
  not unlike an owl's beak, which is something rare in that part of the world.
  He looked to be more than sixty years old, but strong and healthy. He was the
  only one of that party who didn't seem to have suffered much from the
  privation that had weakened the others.</p>

  <p>Instead of speaking Andrew handed him an automatic and some reloads. He
  made no comment. He simply buttoned the pistol inside his overcoat and stowed
  the reloads in his bokkus. Then Andrew handed him the can of salmon with as
  much courtesy as could be managed in the lee of a rock in a ninety-mile gale.
  He understood perfectly. The whorls of wrinkles on his leathery face danced
  with merriment, although his mouth didn't move. He drank the half-frozen
  liquid out of the can and saved the salmon for later, glancing sideways at
  the phony high lama and then, at last, blinking at Elsa. He seemed to look
  right through her to the thought beneath. Then his lips moved.</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain!" he said suddenly. "Elsa!" Then he turned and walked back to
  his dying friend. There he sat down and ate the salmon, using finger and
  thumb, reminiscently, as if recalling bygone better days.</p>

  <p>"He recognizes you all right," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Of course he does! Andrew, he isn't a fighting man. Why did you give him
  that automatic?"</p>

  <p>"You saw him accept it, didn't you? D'you know a better way to explain I'm
  his friend without arguing about it? Do you feel any clairvoyant
  communication from him?"</p>

  <p>"No, Andrew, none. Not any&mdash;not even a trace&mdash;all flat
  calm."</p>

  <p>"If he's the man you think he is, there's a price on his head. He's a
  prisoner, for sale, worth more alive than dead. If they can avoid it they
  won't murder him. So, if he's on our side, and secretly armed, that gives us
  a double edge. But this isn't going to be as simple as all that. No fighting,
  I think. Do you see what's happening? Bulah Singh's already in a whispering
  deal with the real leader&mdash;that man who keeps his face half covered.
  Jesus! If I have to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But he didn't have to force a show-down at the moment. Bulah Singh spotted
  his intention and crawled away to watch two of Andrew's men pitching his
  tent. So Andrew bided his time. He ordered Bompo Tsering to pull the covers
  off two yakloads and make a separate shelter for the man who was dying. That
  made the phony lama furious. He faced the storm and came out to pick a
  quarrel about it, demanding in coarse vernacular:</p>

  <p>"Why did you give that good foreign food to my menial, instead of to me?
  Why do you pitch for him a separate shelter, instead of for me?"</p>

  <p>Elsa stood by to interpret. "Tell him," said Andrew, "I supposed he'd
  prefer whiskey."</p>

  <p>Then he knew for a positive fact that the man was a fraud. The phony lama
  shook his head. But his eyes gave him away. He wanted whiskey. He craved it.
  Now he knew there was some to be had, he intended to get it. He returned to
  his place, where he listened with very obvious resentment to remarks from the
  man who kept the lower part of his face covered. Andrew was adding fact to
  fact, beginning to feel he could command the situation. He said so to
  Elsa.</p>

  <p>"But it's a case of rule or ruin. They believe they've got me belly upward
  on the half-shell. They think they can take over whenever they please."</p>

  <p>After he had got the bivouac to rights, and had fed the animals, he went
  and helped Bompo Tsering carry the dying man into the tent he had made from
  two yakload covers. They were very careful to submit the man to no
  indignities. As Bompo Tsering remarked; a dying man is very near to the
  spirits of the other world, and who knows what those spirits might do to
  anyone who is careless? But Andrew did get a look at the man's shirt. It was
  silk. And he saw the skin of his neck, where the weather hadn't touched it
  and the Tibetan dirt hadn't stuck. He was as clean as Old Ugly-face, who was
  as clean as the wind. And he had the same well-bred air of taking privilege
  for granted. He was too busy dying to pay much attention to Andrew, but he
  fetched up a smile from somewhere along with a little blood, and he murmured
  a blessing, moving his right hand. No menial would have dared to do that.</p>

  <p>Then what Andrew hoped would happen, did. Old Ugly-face came and crawled
  under the same shelter with the dying man. For the time being he left them
  there alone. He went and unpacked a bottle of whiskey and rationed it out in
  teacups. Divided up, there wasn't enough to make even a chicken drunk, but it
  was a friendly gesture, and it gave the phony lama a grand chance to
  demonstrate phony virtue. He refused the little metal cup when it was handed
  to him. He spun his prayer wheel and made a grimace expressing pious horror.
  But when the others curled up, all close together under the blankets that
  Andrew had served out, he leaned closer to Andrew and seemed to hesitate. One
  could almost hear him thinking whiskey. Andrew encouraged him:</p>

  <p>"Your Eminence knows best. But is it sinful to take medicine?"</p>

  <p>He couldn't fall from grace mannerly. He was too full of fear for his
  self-importance&mdash;too inexperienced in the art of saving face. His was
  the Teutonic style. He felt the need to insult Andrew before letting down his
  ill-fitting mask of righteousness.</p>

  <p>"You are a mean host," he retorted. "You have saved an extra drink for
  yourself by offering one to me when those rhagbyas were looking and you knew
  I couldn't accept it."</p>

  <p>Andrew told Elsa about it a few minutes later: "No one but a louse would
  have called his own gang ragyabas. You can generally get a good line on a man
  by noticing the epithets he uses. But I let him go on talking. Presently he
  said: 'A giver should be generous, or else give nothing. No doubt when those
  ignorant fellows are asleep you will open another bottle. A little medicine
  is not much good. There should be plenty: So I asked for his blessing."</p>

  <p>"Did he give it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, grudgingly."</p>

  <p>"A genuine High Lama's blessing should sound like echoed organ music from
  beyond the veil that separates the living and the dead."</p>

  <p>"I know it should. I know High Tibetan better than that man does. Believe
  that or not, as you please. His sounded like mumbling to hide ignorance. I
  told him I'd look for another bottle, and as soon as he thought my back was
  turned he grabbed the tot he had refused and swallowed it in one gulp. So
  we've got his number. We don't have to bother about him."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, do you intend you and me to go on sharing this one tent?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I was thinking about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know. But this is no time to change. And don't let's waste time. Let's
  do some scouting. Come on. I may need you to interpret."</p>

  <p>They struggled against the wind to the lee of the makeshift tent where
  Ugly-face was keeping his dying friend company. For several minutes they
  couldn't hear because of the storm. But it was springtime; the wind changed
  with a sudden blast like high explosive, and as suddenly died. Then the snow
  fell softly in huge flakes that felt warm and comforting. There was a mystic
  silence, and presently they heard the sonorous voice of Old Ugly-face.</p>

  <p>"His friend is already dead," Elsa whispered. "He is reciting from the
  Bardo Thodol."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <a href=
  "http://reluctant-messenger.com/tibetan-book-of-the-dead.htm"><i>Bardo
  Thodol</i></a> (sometimes called <a href=
  "http://reluctant-messenger.com/tibetan-book-of-the-dead.htm">The Tibetan
  Book of the Dead</a>)&mdash;a funerary text that describes the experiences of
  the soul after death during the interval known as bardo between death and
  rebirth. It is recited by lamas over a dying or recently deceased person, or
  sometimes over an effigy of the deceased. It has been suggested that it is a
  sign of the influence of shamanism on Tibetan Buddhism. The name means
  literally "liberation through hearing in the intermediate state". Excerpted
  from <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo_Thodol"><i>Wikipedia</i></a>, q.v. ]</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"'Oh nobly born, that which is called death being come to thee now,
  resolve thus: O this now is the hour of death ...' It's the Book of the Dead.
  He is instructing the spirit of the dead man how to behave, and what thoughts
  to cling to, on the plane of existence beyond the Veil on which he is now
  awakening. Andrew, not ten other men in the world know the Book of the Dead
  by heart."</p>

  <p>"Belly and brains and beauty, he's the real thing, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew-please! Until he gives permission, don't let anyone guess that you
  know who he is!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I don't believe it yet. Come back to our tent."</p>

  <p>It was still snowing heavily. When they reached the tent, someone came out
  of it on hands and knees. Catching sight of them through the curtain of snow
  he got up and ran, but he wasn't quite quick enough. Andrew grabbed a steel
  tent-peg and threw it. When he picked up the peg a moment later there was
  blood on it&mdash;not much, but enough; there'd be no hiding the wound. He
  stuck the peg into his belt, since it might serve as a weapon and save
  killing someone.</p>

  <p>"This should bring things to a head," he remarked to Elsa. "It's a case of
  act now or they'll get me before daylight. Look in the tent. See if
  anything's missing, while I get things going."</p>

  <p>He called Bompo Tsering and set a guard around the tent&mdash;four men.
  Then he listened patiently while Bompo Tsering told him that Bulah Singh had
  been trying to beg a weapon from the man who kept his face covered.</p>

  <p>"But their talking English, too fast. My not understanding."</p>

  <p>Andrew feigned indifference. "It would be stupid," he said, "to try to
  learn too much all at once. How much have they learned about us?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, Gunnigun! Nothing! Our telling nothing!"</p>

  <p>"But Bulah Singh&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, his surely telling too much."</p>

  <p>"What do you make of the man that Bulah Singh's been talking to?"</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering retreated toward his mental funk hole: "Uh&mdash;uh! My not
  knowing. Him not being Tibetan."</p>

  <p>"What about their leader&mdash;that lama who rode the pony?"</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun, why your asking my such questions? Why not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind. Do you know who the big man is, that we made a special tent
  for&mdash;him with the dying friend?"</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering backed into his funk hole and mentally vanished: "Uh-uh! Uh-
  uh! Uh-uh! No, no! My not knowing him! No, no!"</p>

  <p>Elsa almost thrust herself between them: "Andrew, don't ask! Please
  don't!"</p>

  <p>"Okay." Strangely, he didn't sound irritated. Uppermost was that kind of
  hunter's patience that appeared when he carved wood or, as now, when he
  played with his life in his hand. "Anything missing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Your little steel lock-box."</p>

  <p>She had been almost afraid to tell him, but he didn't seem disturbed by
  the news. Staring through the snow, thinking, it was nearly a minute before
  he answered: "It was empty. I expected they'd go for it. I'll get it back.
  But there's something else needs doing first. While I'm gone, you sit here in
  the mouth of the tent, and shoot to kill anyone who starts anything. Get
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Andrew."</p>

  <p>"I don't think there'll be any shooting."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I."</p>

  <p>"But if there is any, it's likely to start soon. If so, shoot first at the
  phony lama, Bulah Singh and&mdash;" there was a name on his lips, but he
  didn't say it "the man who walks on corpses."</p>

  <p>She knew instantly what he meant. It exactly described the walk of the man
  who kept his face half covered and looked over the top of a muffler with
  vicious eyes.</p>

  <p>Andrew continued: "But I guess you'll be safe enough with four men on
  guard. Just sit here until I come back."</p>

  <p>He unpacked a small bottle of rye and stuck it in his pocket. Then he and
  Bompo Tsering crossed the bivouac to where the phony lama sat alone by a
  scrap of yak-dung fire. His men were cuddled up together, like tired ponies,
  asleep. Andrew would have sat down beside him, but the fool wouldn't permit
  it. He screamed like a parrot&mdash;tried to overawe Andrew&mdash;accused him
  of being a Russian&mdash;told him he had no business in Tibet&mdash;
  threatened to make things very hot for him indeed unless&mdash;</p>

  <p>He paused, rather artfully building suspense and glancing around for an
  audience. But his men were asleep or indifferent. Andrew prompted him:
  "Unless what?"</p>

  <p>"Unless you make yourself useful to me."</p>

  <p>Having Bompo Tsering to interpret was a great advantage. Andrew always
  found it difficult to pretend fear where he felt none, whereas Bompo
  Tsering's quite genuine terror kept the charlatan lama well blinded by
  self-esteem. The rye whiskey helped: Andrew gave him a stiff drink. But even
  so, it was fifteen minutes, and pitch dark, before Andrew had coaxed him to
  tell what he really wanted. He whispered it, pulling Andrew's overcoat to
  make him bend down, and belching in Andrew's ear.</p>

  <p>He hardly guessed after that what happened. There was Andrew's knee in his
  stomach and a grip on his throat that choked his parrot-scream. Force of
  example was all that Bompo Tsering ever did need. In a second, the lama was
  down on his back beneath two men, being searched; and that was done so
  thoroughly that he felt even his secrets being torn apart along with his
  underwear. He wasn't even allowed to lie still; they kept him rolling to keep
  his mind occupied as treasure after treasure found its way into Bompo
  Tsering's copious bokkus. The phony lama's men, exhausted and now
  full-bellied, didn't know what was happening; or if they did know, they
  ignored it. Sounds were deadened by the snow. Andrew prolonged the business
  for the sake of Bompo Tsering's morale. He let his victim sit up. He showed
  him his Mauser, unloaded it, drew the slide, struck it with the steel
  tent-peg, broke it, then he handed it back</p>

  <p>"No one," he remarked, "will know it's broken unless you tell 'em."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering translated. And then someone did move in the dark at the
  back of the lean-to. Bompo Tsering clucked a warning.</p>

  <p>Andrew moved away from the dim firelight. He stepped sideways. Suddenly he
  sprang. He landed fist first on Bulah Singh&mdash;knew it by the Sikh's growl
  of anger, and by his smell. There was a real fight this time. Bulah Singh was
  no weakling. Even though his feet were still in bandages, he fought like a
  leopard. But it was less than thirty seconds before Andrew's forearm crushed
  his throat and he had to lie still and be searched.</p>

  <p>Two Mausers. Four clips of cartridges.</p>

  <p>"Got to hand it to you," said Andrew. "Come out in the open."</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh got up and obeyed, awkwardly, because he was hurt and the snow
  balled badly on his bandaged feet. But slowness gave him time to think, and
  he kept on thinking when Andrew stopped and framed him with a flashlight,
  examining his face in the lee of a big rock.</p>

  <p>No bruise&mdash;no wound&mdash;no blood. "So it wasn't you I hit with a
  tent-peg."</p>

  <p>"Damn you, Gunning, you're in such a blue funk that you would kill your
  own mother on suspicion! Don't you realize that by taking two Mausers away
  from those men I have reduced your enemies by two?"</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed. "You have now," he answered, "now." Mausers are the
  easiest to break of all automatics. He unloaded them, drew the slides and
  smashed them one against the other. Then he gave them back: "You may have
  'em." He repeated what he had said to the lama. "No one'll know they're
  broken unless you try to use 'em. No one will know who stole unless you show
  'em."</p>

  <p>"You are a fool," the Sikh answered, but he accepted the broken Mausers.
  "You are also a criminal, destroying weapons at a time like this! You need a
  friend. Have you lost your senses? Why else should you make&mdash;an enemy of
  me? Do you know who these people are?"</p>

  <p>Andrew turned the question back on him: "Do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I think you don't know," the Sikh retorted. "If you wish, you may come to
  my tent and find out. I will tell you&mdash;on terms&mdash;on reasonable
  terms."</p>

  <p>Andrew let him go. He returned to Elsa, carefully arranging the lantern
  inside the tent so as to spoil anyone's aim, before sitting down to eat the
  barley bread and canned stuff she had opened. There was tea, too; Bompo
  Tsering had seen to that. Elsa, aware that men like Andrew and Tom Grayne
  love to spring their own announcements, said very little and asked no
  questions until Andrew had eaten and at last broke silence:</p>

  <p>"Any spirit message from your fat friend?"</p>

  <p>"No, Andrew."</p>

  <p>"Does it make you sore when I speak of him that way?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I won't do it again."</p>

  <p>"Thank you."</p>

  <p>Something had happened. Elsa didn't know what. It was something that had
  changed the relation between them. Something inexpressible in words that,
  nevertheless, Andrew had tried to express. He didn't look at her. He went on
  talking, frowning through the open tent mouth at the falling snow that glowed
  mystically golden in the lamplight.</p>

  <p>"This is the lowdown, as far as I can dope it out&mdash;yet. Old Ugly-
  face has had to take it on the lam. His enemies on the Regent's Council ran
  him out of Lhasa. To make his getaway, he had to change clothes with some
  low-grade flunky&mdash;probably a household steward, who is now masquerading
  in his master's make-up. I had quite a talk with the flunky and then disarmed
  him. He wants to reach the Shig-po-ling monastery."</p>

  <p>"But that's near where Tom is!"</p>

  <p>"Sure. This whole shooting match is Tom's meat. He's like a hungry spider
  waiting for 'em. The luck's almost too good to be true. A million dollars 'ud
  be a safe bet, against a hole in a doughnut, that if we can deliver this
  outfit&mdash;as is&mdash;to Tom Grayne at Shig-po-ling, Tom will know how to
  use it to spike the German-Japanese game."</p>

  <p>"You mean their game with the young Dalai Lama?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And now I'll tell you the name of the real leader of this outfit.
  Ambrose St. Malo."</p>

  <p>"The man Morgan Lewis spoke of?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"He knows you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He recognized me the minute he saw me. It must have been him that I
  hit with the tent-peg. I guess he's busy now trying to bust open my empty
  box. He'll keep on trying. He's persistent. Even dead ponies couldn't stop
  him in that storm. He came ahead. He has that kind of guts. I don't doubt it
  was his idea for Ugly-face to change places and clothes with the flunky lama.
  He has that kind of brains. I'm game to bet it was he who encouraged the
  flunky to humiliate his former master&mdash;beggar-on-horseback stuff. He has
  that kind of humor. And I haven't a doubt he plans to sell Ugly-face at
  Shig-po-ling for hard cash."</p>

  <p>"I believe you're right, Andrew."</p>

  <p>"Right or wrong, that's how we'll play it." He paused. Then he added:
  "Unless you've a better idea."</p>

  <p>Something had happened. It was nameless. It didn't make speech easy. But
  the tent, with its view of lamplit snow, felt cozier than anybody's home that
  ever was. Elsa almost stammered:</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I'm useless. I haven't an idea. The only thing I can think of is
  that we're so physically near to&mdash;I don't want to name him."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead. I know."</p>

  <p>"We're so physically close to him that he's like a huge dynamo and simply
  drowns out my clairvoyance! I see nothing. I hear nothing. I'm just normal.
  It feels actually funny!"</p>

  <p>"You've no suggestion to offer?"</p>

  <p>"None. Except don't name him! Don't recognize him!"</p>

  <p>"Good. Then we'll play it my way. Between now and daybreak, I'm going to
  boss both gangs or bust."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch44"
     id="ch44">CHAPTER 44</a></h2>

  <p class="first">That was the night on which Andrew, to use his own phrase,
  "came clean." Sleep was out of the question; too probably someone would make
  an attempt on his life before daybreak. Someone. It wasn't likely to be Bulah
  Singh, nor the flunky lama. Those two had been sufficiently discouraged.</p>

  <p>"Someone," said Andrew. "But who? Bulah Singh hasn't hit it off with St.
  Malo. Fool, fool, where there is no fool! They're a brace of Weisenheimers,
  underrating each other, playing for position. Bulah Singh will have another
  try to make friends with me. He'll decide, after thinking it over, that I'd
  be easier to double-cross than St. Malo. That's my guess, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"Are you really sure the other man is Ambrose St. Malo?"</p>

  <p>"Dead sure. No mistaking him. Met him in Shanghai&mdash;guess he thinks
  I've forgotten. Perhaps he only hopes it. He went by three or four different
  names. As Louis Lazard he was acting runner for a Japanese-owned joint that
  had a bad rep. He's a pimp, like Hitler's national German hero Horst Wessel.
  But that's not unusual; nearly all professional spies live off women. His
  original name was Franz Schmidt, born in Mnchen-Gladbach, Bavaria.* He
  studied music, philosophy, languages, law. Quite a bright lad. Before he was
  twenty he shook down one of our American heiresses for fifty thousand or so.
  But he paid most of it out in blackmail. That's how he made the Social
  Register&mdash;I mean, our secret service black book and three stars, meaning
  dangerous. During the World War he was two years behind the French lines
  without even being suspected. Smart work, that. Took doing. He is said to
  have been betrayed at last by Mata Hari. More likely, he betrayed her. There
  was a secret trial. A French firing squad shot someone. Franz Schmidt turned
  up later on as Ambrose St. Malo, in Syria, drawing French pay to help spoil
  England's game in Palestine."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Mnchen-Gladbach</i> (now spelled
  <i>Mnchengladbach</i>)&mdash;a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It
  is located west of the Rhine half way between Dsseldorf and the Dutch
  border. Talbot Mundy appears to have confused it with Mnchen (Munich) in
  Bavaria. Annotator. ]</p>

  <p>"Can he be working for France now?" Elsa asked.</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed. "This is once when the French aren't guilty. I'd put
  nothing past them. But they've no political interest in Tibet. They can't
  even claim they've the Catholic Church to protect. No, when the French are
  once through with a spy it's his cue to clear out. They're killers. So I
  guess St. Malo shook the French, to save his skin. At any rate, he's being
  paid just now by Russia and Japan. But look-see! Look-see! What d'you make of
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I'm stupid tonight. I've no imagination. You'll have to tell me
  what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Well, no one could accuse von Klaus of being anything but German. So this
  turns out to be a German plot, to get control of the Dalai Lama. The Germans
  are double-crossing their friends the Japs, but the Japs and Russians are
  paying Hitler's bills."</p>

  <p>"You think it's one and the same plot?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but it begins to look like a race&mdash;with Ambrose St. Malo taking
  his pick of the runners. There's one sure thing about him. He's never working
  for the side you think he is."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, did you suspect all this when you were talking to Dr. Morgan
  Lewis?"</p>

  <p>"You mean about St. Malo?"</p>

  <p>"And his line-up with the Germans."</p>

  <p>"Sure. It's my business. I got a clear line on St. Malo in Shanghai."</p>

  <p>"Then why didn't you tell Dr. Lewis?"</p>

  <p>He laughed again, uncritical, friendly: "Hell, you bawled me out for
  telling what little I did tell. You were right, too. This is Tom Grayne's
  party. I'm not paid to blow England's nose."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, who does pay you?"</p>

  <p>"No one."</p>

  <p>"Even your expenses?"</p>

  <p>"I'd a great aunt."</p>

  <p>"You mean, you're living off an inheritance?"</p>

  <p>"Partly. I can earn money."</p>

  <p>She looked around the tent, and at Andrew's shadowed face in the yellow
  lantern light. Shaving had been impossible since they left India, but he had
  kept his reddish beard close cropped and neatly trimmed. He looked strong,
  clean, well groomed. He smelt good.</p>

  <p>"I believe," she said after a moment, "there's nothing you can't do."</p>

  <p>He looked up sharply, stared for a second with puckered eyes and spoke
  kindly: "You're ahead of time. They haven't got me yet. This isn't my
  wake."</p>

  <p>"Why are you superstitious about being praised?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind me. Let's talk of this fix we're in."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "yes. There is one thing you can't do."</p>

  <p>He evaded the challenge neatly. She knew it was deliberate, although it
  sounded like the good-humored flow of conversation:</p>

  <p>"Which of a thousand and one? I bet I know what you're thinking about.
  Have I three guesses?"</p>

  <p>"As many as you please."</p>

  <p>"I can't figure out why Old Ugly-face is in this mess. He's got his head
  in a noose."</p>

  <p>"But he's here," said Elsa. "You do admit it is he?"</p>

  <p>"I take your word for it."</p>

  <p>"Very sweet of you, Andrew. Very polite. But somehow unlike you! Don't you
  know him?"</p>

  <p>"From the photograph? I'd have to see it again to be half sure."</p>

  <p>"I mean, from your own inside vision&mdash;don't you know who he is?"</p>

  <p>"You'd make a good cross-examiner. No, I don't know who he is. On the
  whole, I'd say yes, I suppose he's Old Ugly-face. I'm taking it for granted.
  I couldn't prove it."</p>

  <p>"Don't you suppose he'll prove it, at the right time?"</p>

  <p>"Why isn't now the best possible time?"</p>

  <p>"He knows best. He's in a very tight place," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"He sure is. So are we&mdash;outnumbered&mdash;well worth looting
  &mdash;up against at least one, perhaps more, of the coldest blooded devils
  on earth. St. Malo is as vicious as one of our young coked-up killers in the
  States. If you could cut his conscience, it wouldn't bleed. I don't know who
  some of those Tibetans are. But St. Malo picked 'em, so they're no one's
  woolly baa-lambs. It's a bad stable. Our men are scared stiff of 'em."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, he knows all that."</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed. "Who's superstitious? What d'you want to call him?
  Monsieur X or something?"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur X would do."</p>

  <p>"We'll call him that. So now&mdash;what beats me is that Monsieur X is a
  statesman. He was on the Council of Regents in Lhasa. He knows the
  ropes."</p>

  <p>"So was von Schuschnigg* a statesman," said Elsa. "Where is he now? How
  many of Mussolini's, Stalin's, Franco's statesmen are alive today? Why should
  Monsieur X be an exception?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Kurt (von) Schuschnigg (1897-1977)</i>&mdash;
  Austrian chancellor. He served (1932&mdash;34) as Minister of Justice and
  Education and helped Engelbert Dollfuss repress the Social Democrats and
  organize the corporative state. After Dollfuss's assassination (1934) he
  became chancellor. In 1936, Schuschnigg forced the resignation of E. R. von
  Starhemberg as vice chancellor and became sole head of the semifascist state.
  Schuschnigg's efforts to prevent German absorption of Austria were successful
  until he lost (1937) the support of Benito Mussolini. In Feb., 1938, Hitler
  forced him to take the Austrian Nazi leader Arthur Seyss-Inquart into his
  cabinet. When German troops massed on the border in March, Seyss-Inquart
  became chancellor, and the troops marched into Austria unopposed. A Nazi
  prisoner until 1945, Schuschnigg settled (1947) in the United States and
  taught at St. Louis University. Excerpted from the <a href=

  Encyclopedia</i></a>, q.v. ]</p>

  <p>"But according to you, he's also a magician."</p>

  <p>"So was Jesus a magician&mdash;St. Paul&mdash;Joan of Arc&mdash; Giordano
  Bruno&mdash;Savonarola. Andrew, are you being serious? Do you honestly claim
  that just because someone is spiritual he can escape from material hatred?
  The world hates spiritual people. It only admires material success. It only
  tolerates shams&mdash;until after they're dead."</p>

  <p>"But if he's a saint, as you think, why should he be in the soup?"</p>

  <p>"Why was Jesus in the soup, as you call it?"</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew. Why did Jesus, who knew enough to turn society inside out
  so it stayed that way for a couple of thousand years, go bumming around
  Palestine with a crook like Judas? Didn't he know better?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I'm only a beginner. I don't know all the answers."</p>

  <p>"If Monsieur X is as bright as you think&mdash;how come that he fell for
  St. Malo?"</p>

  <p>"How d'you know he has fallen for him?"</p>

  <p>"That's what's happened. St. Malo is the king-pin of this outfit. I'm
  gambling St. Malo came overland from Shanghai just to help Monsieur X escape
  into a worse trap than he was in before. St. Malo proposed to him to change
  clothes with that flunky. He means to sell him for hard cash."</p>

  <p>"Andrew&mdash;couldn't it be that Monsieur X knew no other way to reach a
  definite objective than to agree to St. Malo's plan?"</p>

  <p>"Jesuitry, eh? Lining up with crooks and doing wrong that good may come of
  it maybe, perhaps? That sounds like the church talking."</p>

  <p>"Gently, Andrew, gently! What wrong has he done&mdash;that you know of?
  Andrew, you must understand this. Please understand it. Monsieur X is a
  Ringding Gelong Lama who abandoned the broad road of promotion by meditation,
  for the perilous and much more difficult pilgrimage, as it is called, of
  attainment by deeds."</p>

  <p>"Attainment! That's what they're all after&mdash;attainment&mdash;
  success&mdash;every last damned politician I ever met or heard of. They have
  to do it. They can't do otherwise. Once their snouts are in the swill, they
  must suck with the rest of the swine. They have to make the front page or go
  under&mdash;feather their nests, or starve when there's a change of
  government. Rob or be robbed. Lie, steal, chouse, swindle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Andrew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"To take the path that Monsieur X took, he had first to abandon all those
  things. He had to tear out of his heart the last trace of
  self-aggrandizement, greed, pride. He had to earn, by almost unimaginable
  discipline, not only spiritual power but the equally essential spiritual will
  never to employ that power for his personal use, even in dire need."</p>

  <p>"Well. I've heard of that being done. Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"You know what karma is?"</p>

  <p>"I know what the word means."</p>

  <p>"Tell me."</p>

  <p>"It means the unavoidable accumulated incubus of fate caused by deeds in
  former lives."</p>

  <p>"Near enough. Unavoidable, irresistible, but not unconquerable. Spiritual
  evolution doesn't wipe out karma. It can't. Nothing can. Karma must happen,
  because every cause is a boomerang that must have its effect, sooner or
  later, upon the individual who did it. But on the principle which Jesus
  taught&mdash;'resist not evil'&mdash;spiritual evolution does show how to
  rise&mdash;as it were into a stratosphere&mdash;above karma and in that way
  to put it to, good use. Have I made that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Get up into an ivory tower and offer the other cheek?"</p>

  <p>"Not literally&mdash;no. Turning the other cheek suggests the idea of
  tacking a ship at sea, so as to take advantage of an adverse wind. One can
  progress against the wind. One can make personal karma serve impersonal,
  spiritual purposes."</p>

  <p>"I object to that word 'impersonal,' " said Andrew. "What's more I sustain
  the objection. It's ruled out. It tries to sidestep the truth that everything
  happens to persons, through persons. Even an impersonal opinion, so-called,
  comes through a person. Everything that means anything is personal&mdash;
  from Einstein's relativity all the way down to a five-four Supreme Court
  decision, or an egg omelet, or a shot in the back.&mdash;Just half a jiffy
  while I move that lantern."</p>

  <p>He rearranged the lantern carefully so that the shadow of his head and
  shoulders fell on sacks of barley that lined the tent wall. There was nothing
  to aim at from outside. Then he shifted two sacks so that there was one on
  either side of Elsa and she was well protected against possible bullets.</p>

  <p>"So let's keep this personal," he went on. "We're in one personal hell of
  a jam. I'd like to get your view. I'm doing my best to understand."</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew the right words," she answered. "I can feel it, the way one
  feels music in silence."</p>

  <p>"Keep on trying," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>She was silent for almost a minute. Then she said: "Listen! Suppose
  Monsieur X were in Lhasa, hiding from enemies."</p>

  <p>"Okay. That's easy. He was."</p>

  <p>"While in hiding he heard of a plot to carry off the infant Dalai Lama in
  order to make use of him deceitfully for cruel purposes."</p>

  <p>"Stet! That's what happened."</p>

  <p>"What could he do?"</p>

  <p>"You're telling it."</p>

  <p>"Having no personal ambition none whatever&mdash;absolutely none&mdash;
  caring nothing what might happen to his own person&mdash;but intensely
  willing to devote his whole intelligence to the greatest good of all
  concerned&mdash;should he have turned down an opportunity with pious horror
  because its proposer was Ambrose St. Malo? Or was he right to let St. Malo
  appear to succeed with his treacherous plan, knowing full well that his own
  soul will direct him, not only to the right course&mdash;but to the only
  right course? Remember, he doesn't care twopence about his own personal
  safety."</p>

  <p>"Did you make that up?" asked Andrew.</p>

  <p>"No. I asked my soul to tell me how to convince you. The words came."</p>

  <p>"They make sense," he answered. "Just a jiffy or two. I'll make the
  rounds."</p>

  <p>"Take a guard with you!"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>The four whom he had placed on guard were asleep under the fly of the
  tent, inside two walls of barley bags. He waked up two of them and led the
  way first to the pony lines, using his flashlight. It wasn't snowing any
  longer, it was thawing. Someone might have ridden away. He counted the
  animals. Ponies, yaks and sheep were all there with their harness around
  them. He thought for a minute, made sure that his automatic was easy to get
  at, and started toward Bulah Singh's tent. The soft snow smothered his
  footfall so that he walked like a ghost, but his thoughts were like
  trip-hammer beats:</p>

  <p>"Almighty, if you give a damn, and if you are God, don't fool me this
  time."</p>

  <p>A voice seemed to say, inside his head: "Don't fool yourself."</p>

  <p>Who was talking to whom? He wondered about it. He didn't know. His lips
  didn't move. He wasn't muttering or talking aloud to himself. "I'm going to
  play this the way it looks right to me," he said. But it was soundless.</p>

  <p>The voice inside him answered: "You are the judge. There is no other."</p>

  <p>"Nuts!" he said. "I'm damned if I'm the judge! I didn't create this
  mess!"</p>

  <p>"Didn't you? Then who did? This is the test you prayed for. Are you
  afraid?"</p>

  <p>"Hell, I'm not afraid of St. Malo and Bulah Singh."</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid not to kill them?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to play it straight. I'll keep 'em both for Tom Grayne."</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid of Tom Grayne?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I be?"</p>

  <p>"Why are you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not."</p>

  <p>"You are the judge: Are you afraid of Elsa?"</p>

  <p>"God, no."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I be?"</p>

  <p>"Then what do you fear? What is it?"</p>

  <p>He hadn't answered himself. He had reached Bulah Singh's tent. There was a
  lantern burning inside. It cast the shadow of only one man, that looked like
  the turbaned shape of Bulah Singh. Andrew touched the shoulders of his
  Tibetan escort to warn them to keep silent, and stood listening. Presently
  there came the muffled sound of something hollow being hammered beneath a
  blanket. Suddenly he drew his own knife and cut the lashings of the tent with
  swift strokes. He bore down on the ridge pole, collapsing the tent, and stood
  back to watch the result. The lantern went out. Someone inside the billowing
  tent fired three shots-panic shots at random. Andrew spotted with his
  flash-light, jumped and landed with both feet on the invisible pistol. Then
  there were groans. So he moved aside and ordered his two Tibetans to drag the
  tent free. Bulah Singh sat up in the glare of the flashlight.</p>

  <p>"I might have known it was you," he said, readjusting his turban. Both his
  broken Mausers were beside him on the ground. He had been using one as a
  hammer to break open Andrew's steel box. "Don't shoot," he said, "unless you
  specially want to. I'm not armed."</p>

  <p>"I will do as I please," said Andrew. "Pull that blanket aside. No, I know
  what's under that one. The other!"</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh sat still. He thought it was a trick. He didn't dare to move.
  Andrew told one of the Tibetans to pull the blanket away. Beneath it lay
  Ambrose St. Malo with his head swathed in a torn shirt. It was he who had
  groaned.</p>

  <p>"Next time, I'll aim better," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>St. Malo sat up. "What do you mean&mdash;next time?" He had a peculiar,
  sub-acid accent that suggested an immeasurable depth of insolence and self-
  assurance that relied on treachery and other men's mistakes.</p>

  <p>"Next time you burgle my tent," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"You'd be a fool to kill me," St. Malo answered. "Perhaps you are a fool.
  Who knows? Damn you and your tent-peg! You missed killing me by almost
  nothing. If I had my gun, you'd&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted: "Take your gun back from Bulah Singh! He stole it. Go
  on, take it from him!"</p>

  <p>He didn't have to speak twice. Matter-of-factly St. Malo held out his
  hand. The Sikh returned his well-oiled Smith and Wesson.</p>

  <p>"For your information," said Andrew, "you were bluffed by a couple of
  broken Mausers. Now uncover my steel box."</p>

  <p>Both men were afraid to move, because the flashlight was in Andrew's left
  hand and his right looked too ready to draw. One of the Tibetans pulled the
  blanket aside. The steel box was unbroken, though there were deep dents made
  by the butt of Bulah Singh's Mauser. At a sign from Andrew a Tibetan picked
  up the box.</p>

  <p>"You hadn't brains enough to think of this," said St. Malo. "You're only a
  strong-arm amateur. I remember you now from Shanghai."</p>

  <p>"You are right," said Bulah Singh. "It's that girl. She's clairvoyant. She
  tells him everything."</p>

  <p>St. Malo was beginning to feel a lot less scared, which was what Andrew
  waited for. One scare is never enough. It needs not less than two.</p>

  <p>"If you should shoot me," said St. Malo, "there'd be no one to tell my
  rescue party you've been hospitable. There's a party from Lhasa close behind
  us. You'll need friends. You'd better make one now. I'm not vindictive."</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed. That might be a half-truth. But it was one sure bet that
  Ambrose St. Malo had no friends in Lhasa. If he did know, and was known to
  von Klaus's party of Germans, then he must have double-crossed them and
  escaped with the man they were after. He had probably snatched Old Ugly-face
  out from under their noses. It would be a pursuit&mdash;not rescue-party.</p>

  <p>"If you should shoot me," said Andrew, "you couldn't handle my men. You'd
  be caught by the pursuing force and strung up. So you may keep your gun. Your
  five-and-ten-cent lama told me you want to go where I'm headed for. So toe
  the line. From now on you and Bulah Singh share this tent. You'll walk
  &mdash;both of you."</p>

  <p>"But my feet!" said Bulah Singh.</p>

  <p>"I don't care a damn for your feet. You'll use 'em. I intend to repack the
  loads to spare the ponies. And get this, both of you. The slightest trouble
  from either of you, from now on, will be personal&mdash;between you and me
  &mdash;settled there and then, on that basis, without further notice."</p>

  <p>He didn't wait to watch them repitch the tent. He left the Tibetans to
  help them and walked alone to the lean-to, where Bompo Tsering and his own
  gang were huddled all together at the opposite end of the lean-to from the
  phony lama's men. He awoke Bompo Tsering&mdash;whispered to him.</p>

  <p>"But, Gunnigun&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do as I say, you fool, or you'll be dead by morning!"</p>

  <p>One by one, waking them one at a time, they disarmed St. Malo's men. It
  was better to wake them before searching them&mdash;especially those who
  pretended to be very fast asleep. They all had Mausers. Andrew smashed them,
  one against another, then flung them away in the snow. That those were St.
  Malo's and not the phony lama's men was now established beyond doubt, without
  having to ask questions that might subtly have restored their morale. Being
  questioned, by someone who needs to know, builds self-importance. If they had
  been the phony lama's men they would have looked to him for explanations,
  help, advice, orders. They didn't. They never looked at him at all. They
  didn't care whether he lived or he died. They stared through the dark toward
  Bulah Singh's tent. And they were all the more discouraged and disenchanted
  because Andrew told them nothing&mdash;said not one solitary word. He simply
  walked away and left them. Bompo Tsering followed:</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun, your being hot-damn fool! Why your breaking all them too good
  Mausers? Why your throwing away? Why your not giving-um me? My&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew's impatient gesture stopped him. He blinked in the rays of the
  flashlight.</p>

  <p>"Look in my eyes! Am I afraid?" asked Andrew.</p>

  <p>"No, Gunnigun. My being afraid. Your not."</p>

  <p>"Good. That's what I thought. Turn in and sleep. I'm standing watch. One
  hour before daybreak, redistribute loads, dividing up between all the ponies,
  with a half-load for the new one. From here on, everybody walks except the
  Lady Elsa."</p>

  <p>"Why her not walking also?"</p>

  <p>"Because I say it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Gunnigun."</p>

  <p>"That's all."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Gunnigun."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering walked off toward the pony lines where the tea-urn and fuel
  were stowed in a hole in the rock. He hummed a mantra guaranteed to ward off
  devils.</p>

  <p>Andrew went to his own tent, rather grim-lipped. His lips didn't move.
  "Who said I'm afraid?" he demanded. It sounded like his own voice, but he was
  absolutely sure he hadn't actually spoken. A voice inside him answered:</p>

  <p>"I said it. I say it again."</p>

  <p>Elsa called to him: "Are you all right, Andrew?"</p>

  <p>She opened the tent and held back the flap while he kicked the snow off
  his boots and went in.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch45"
     id="ch45">CHAPTER 45</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It cleared suddenly. The low moon broke through the clouds.
  Andrew sat in the mouth of the tent with Elsa beside him and the pole between
  them, so that they had a view of the entire bivouac. She wrapped a blanket
  around her, although it wasn't really cold now the thaw had set in. She
  hadn't any idea that it made her look wistful and in need of male protection.
  She wasn't thinking of herself. But Andrew found himself resisting an
  impulse. It made him lean the other way. Impulses at cross-purposes within
  him made decision difficult. The thawing snow thudded and tinkled. The ponies
  neighed, smelling the barley sacks; Bompo Tsering was getting their breakfast
  ration ready before redistributing the loads. There was a feel of
  excitement&mdash;a sensation of impending crisis, and it was suggested all
  over again by Andrew's forced calm. The curve of his shoulders resembled a
  spring under tension. He was ready for anything&mdash;eager to employ and
  relieve his nervous energy. Things seemed real and unreal in undulations, as
  if thought rose and fell on waves of consciousness.</p>

  <p>Elsa spoke first: "Andrew," she said after a long while, "I've meant the
  opposite&mdash;but I've become a perfect infliction on you. If karma is what
  we are told it is, mine piles up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"See here," he retorted. "You're always praising me and blaming yourself.
  Try reversing it."</p>

  <p>"I'm finding fault with both of us," she said, resting her chin on her
  knees.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with either of us?" he retorted. "Aren't you doing your
  best? I know I am."</p>

  <p>"There must be something wrong," she said after a moment.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. We're human."</p>

  <p>"We have been through so much together. And yet&mdash;I have tried to make
  myself understood&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You mean, by me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Andrew. Just as a matter of fair play."</p>

  <p>"Sure it was fair play?"</p>

  <p>"What would you call it?"</p>

  <p>"Was it fair to yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Of course it was. I shouldn't feel like a stranger to you. And I've
  tried to understand you, for the same reason. But you've never let me."</p>

  <p>"People shouldn't understand each other," he answered. "It isn't decent.
  To understand is to hate or despise. For instance, I understand St. Malo and
  Bulah Singh. If you understood me you'd despise me. I don't wish that."</p>

  <p>"How could I possibly despise you, after all you've done. And besides,
  Andrew, you're not a criminal."</p>

  <p>It was almost a question. She shrank at the inflection of her own voice.
  But it was too late to recall it.</p>

  <p>"What is a criminal?" he answered. "Where's the dividing line?"</p>

  <p>"I meant, Bulah Singh, for instance, is a fugitive from justice. You're
  not."</p>

  <p>"What is justice? I never saw any yet" Something had released the spring.
  Andrew was coming unwound. "Take an example," he went on. "Do you consider
  your Monsieur X is receiving justice&mdash;from God&mdash;humanity
  &mdash;anyone? As far as it's in me to give it, he'll get it from me. But
  what do I know about him? So how can I give it? All I know is what I've heard
  about him, what you've told me, and what I infer. That's all. It amounts to
  damned little justice? I'm a lawyer. There ain't no such animal."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you are difficult tonight."</p>

  <p>"Life's difficult."</p>

  <p>"Do we know each other well enough for me to say what I really think?"</p>

  <p>"About me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You'll have to use your own judgment."</p>

  <p>"Is that a challenge? Or a warning? Or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes things are said that stick like barbs. It isn't wise to tell
  all you know, or all you think you know. Even when you're in love it isn't
  wise."</p>

  <p>He paused. Elsa held her breath. Had he divined her secret? Did he know
  she loved him? Was he resenting it? Was that the cause of his moodiness? She
  breathed again when he continued:</p>

  <p>"You should know that. Did you tell Tom Grayne everything you thought you
  knew about you and him?"</p>

  <p>"I tried to."</p>

  <p>"But you didn't?"</p>

  <p>"Couldn't."</p>

  <p>"Women don't understand," he said after a moment. "They don't realize that
  if a man respects 'em he shows 'em only his best. The mistake they make is in
  thinking it isn't his best. They can't let well enough alone. So they examine
  critically. Then they get more than they asked for&mdash;and bang goes
  another friendship, because they discover&mdash;or they think they do
  &mdash;what the man is afraid of."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you're afraid of something."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you're right. I don't doubt you'd like to be told. You'd take that
  as a compliment. But believe me, damned few compliments of that kind are
  worth what they cost."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I wouldn't count costs if I could do you any good. I feel,
  perhaps I could help, if you'd let me. I know you're not afraid of these
  Tibetans, nor of Bulah Singh and St. Malo. You're not afraid of tomorrow's
  march&mdash;I know you're not, although everyone else is&mdash;except me. But
  you're afraid of something."</p>

  <p>"Meaning, I suppose, 'tell Mamma.' "</p>

  <p>"No. I refuse to be Mamma."</p>

  <p>"That's good. If she had her own way my Mamma's in heaven. She's in hell
  if the preacher was right. Anyhow, one was enough."</p>

  <p>"You didn't like her?"</p>

  <p>"I loved her. But one was enough. When she died, I flew the matriarchal
  coop. If I hate anything it's one of these synthetic mothers."</p>

  <p>Elsa felt she was getting nowhere, slipping backward. She threw caution to
  the winds: "Well, Andrew, there's no need to tell you I'm burned up with
  curiosity. I know you're afraid. And yet I know you're not running away. So I
  think you're afraid of yourself."</p>

  <p>Instead of answering, he met her eyes. The moonlight revealed his clearly
  but it did not tell the meaning of their strange excitement. Was he angry? He
  got up, strode as far as the pony lines, gave an order, found fault with
  Bompo Tsering, stood listening for a moment near Bulah Singh's tent on his
  way back, and came and sat down. This time he didn't look at her.</p>

  <p>"See here," he said almost savagely: "I won't even try to tell you all of
  it. It's too long and too difficult too much about me: But I'll admit this:
  the arrival of the man we've agreed to call Monsieur X has upset me no
  end!"</p>

  <p>"How, Andrew? In what way? Can't you tell me at least that much?"</p>

  <p>"Brought up memories. Conjured 'em&mdash;stirred 'em, like mud off a river
  bottom."</p>

  <p>"But you're not an escapist, Andrew. You're not running away from
  memories. I know you're not."</p>

  <p>He looked at her. She marveled at his blindness that he couldn't read how
  utterly she loved him. Or was it that her eyes were so dumb with love that
  they couldn't tell?</p>

  <p>"How can you know?" he answered. "You're guessing. Or else you're slapping
  on the praise to hide what you really think."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, do you like being cruel?"</p>

  <p>"I hate cruelty."</p>

  <p>"Well then, please don't suggest I'm lying when I tell you I know
  something. I don't believe I do lie very often. I would lie to you last. Do
  you believe me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do believe you. You don't tell lies."</p>

  <p>Suddenly she knew the veil that hid his memories was slowly being lifted
  &mdash;like a dark portcullis&mdash;by a force beyond his power to control.
  Her heart thumped so she was afraid he'd hear it.</p>

  <p>He said quietly: "You're the first person who has ever given me a square
  deal about that."</p>

  <p>"About what, Andrew?"</p>

  <p>"About my not running away. God damn their souls to hell, every son of a
  bitch friend or enemy who ever heard the name of Freud has called me an
  escapist. What makes you think otherwise?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's intuition. Are you forgetting I'm clairvoyant&mdash;
  sometimes?"</p>

  <p>He fell silent again, watching the shadows, listening. For the time he was
  two men. Two separate groups of senses held his attention. Instinct watched
  the bivouac, alert for familiar danger. Intuition trembled and leaped toward
  un-danger&mdash;unfamiliar&mdash;unknown, and very difficult to trust because
  instinct said no to it.</p>

  <p>Elsa's voice with a smile to it interrupted his thought: "Andrew, what is
  it that you're not running away from?"</p>

  <p>Heavier humor might have driven thought inward and scattered it. That
  light touch took the weight off. He laughed:</p>

  <p>"My country 'tis of thee!"</p>

  <p>He reached into his huge hip pocket for a hunk of root and his whittling
  knife. By the dim light of the lantern he carved guide lines, blocking off
  roughly the main planes of a head and shoulders. They might be anyone's head
  and shoulders&mdash;something unborn yet.</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you've always said you love your country. I got the impression
  that you love America far more than I love England."</p>

  <p>"I love America." He whittled one side of the root smooth and then put it
  away. "Don't you love England?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I do," she answered. "But not fanatically. What is there to
  love? Chamberlain and Lady Astor? Decadence&mdash;miles and miles of awful
  council houses&mdash;dreary monotony&mdash;suburbs&mdash;keeping up with the
  Joneses&mdash;snobbery&mdash;lip-service to traditions that died in the
  war&mdash;vulgarity&mdash;awful vulgarity&mdash;and an empire that means
  nothing now&mdash;always but L.s.d.&mdash;pounds, shillings and pence. I love
  some people in England. I can think of at least ten people whom I really
  love&mdash;perhaps a hundred whom I really like. But I think the England I
  would like to love died centuries ago. No, I'm not afraid of England," she
  added. "Why are you afraid of America?"</p>

  <p>He closed his whittling knife and put it away. It was an unconscious
  gesture, signifying nothing to himself. To an observer it was as clear as the
  line of his lips in the yellow lamplight that he had dismissed side issues.
  He intended to "come clean."</p>

  <p>"So you insist on knowing. Well, I'll tell you. But answer this first:
  have you any cads in England? Any stinkers? Any lying hypocrites in high
  places&mdash;patrioteers*&mdash;racketeers&mdash;pimps&mdash;panders
  &mdash;hogs with their snouts at the public teat&mdash;treacherous labor
  leaders&mdash;nouveaux riches, who'd sell their king for a tax rebate
  &mdash;unctuous churchmen drawing dividends from munition factories&mdash;
  double-crossing lawyers?&mdash;Any cowards, thieves, fakers, pompous
  bureaucrats, place hunters, sail-trimmers&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>patrioteer</i>&mdash;an extreme bellicose
  nationalist. <a href=
  "http://www.wordreference.com/definition/patrioteer">WordReference.com</a>.
  ]</p>

  <p>"Andrew!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;have you any?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course. All countries have them."</p>

  <p>"For every one you have in England, we have half a dozen in the U.S.A.
  What's worse, ours are more competent. They're bolder. They're just as yellow
  at heart, but they're tougher skinned and they've ten times the
  opportunity."</p>

  <p>"But, Andrew, surely all Americans aren't grafters. In England we
  have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen!" he interrupted. "You've some good men and women left in Great
  Britain. Some. No doubt, none better. But for every one you've got left,
  we've got at least two in the U.S.A. And they're better than yours. There are
  plenty of reasons why that should be. The United States is the God-damned
  craziest country on earth. It's a hotbed of all the phony isms, cults,
  philosophies, diseased religions, chicaneries, iniquities, stupid laws,
  vices, obscenities and God knows what else. But it's the best country. And
  it's the last one left that has a chance to lead the world out of the mess
  it's in. I said lead, not save. It's got the men and women who can do it,
  given a chance. But do they get the chance? That's what eats me. Let a wise
  man&mdash;or an honest woman&mdash;and they're scarce, mind you&mdash; make a
  move toward liberty, sanity, decency, dignity&mdash;those are all one, and
  don't forget it&mdash;instantly a thousand greedy liars with tongues in their
  cheeks&mdash;smug, blatant lip-servers&mdash;all of 'em drooling for loot,
  slobbering for a chance to exploit&mdash;leap up behind some catch-phrase
  demagogue or pulpiteer to steal the movement or else kill it."</p>

  <p>He let indignation boil a moment, enjoying the emotion. Then he suddenly
  resumed: "Almighty God! You wouldn't believe what gets by! One of my first
  important jobs was to help prosecute a political boss. His corruption was so
  obscene that nine-tenths of the evidence couldn't be printed&mdash;even
  nowadays when people discuss syphilis at dinner. He was hand-in-glove with
  priests; they took money from him to what they call educate the children of
  the parents he had looted. He'd stood in with, and taken money from brothels,
  crooked gambling joints and all the rackets there are. No graft-sow was too
  rotten for him to milk. A nice, prissy-faced, silver-haired daddy with a
  smile that 'ud melt your heart. His wife's furs had been bought with a
  percentage of the earnings of diseased whores, who had to earn it and come
  across or go to jail. His sons were put through college on the proceeds of
  the bail bond business. That's another stinking racket that only a son of a
  bitch would touch. He was proved at the trial to have double-crossed his own
  gang scores of times, and to have cunningly passed the buck to someone else.
  He was guilty of almost every crime in the calendar, including incitement to
  murder. He was a stinking, baby-kissing swine, who had the impudence to call
  character witnesses to prove he was a faithful Catholic. Even the Catholic
  Irish judge got sore at that; I guess he added two years to the sentence. But
  here's where the limit came. This is what staggered me, so that I can't even
  talk of it now without feeling sick at the stomach. He was brought up for
  sentence on a Friday. He got twelve years. He should have had life, but he
  was let off with twelve years, partly because of his age, and partly, no
  doubt, to encourage him to keep his mouth shut. What d'you suppose he said to
  the judge? You'd never guess. He said: 'You'll have your conscience to live
  with! There's a God in Heaven. The Lord Jesus Christ was also sentenced on a
  Friday.'"</p>

  <p>"But, Andrew, why should that man's blasphemy offend you so much?"</p>

  <p>"It didn't. It doesn't. This is what burns me. All the newspapers front-
  paged it. And what did the public do? The criminal himself, the prosecuting
  attorney, the judge, and all the members of the jury received a total of
  hundreds of thousands of letters from all over the United States,
  sympathizing with him and denouncing his prosecutors. Hundreds of thousands
  of letters. They were turned over to me to deal with. That's how I know."</p>

  <p>"How did you deal with them? What did you do?"</p>

  <p>"I sorted 'em. Studied 'em. I sort of added 'em to what I knew already
  from having talked to witnesses and having sat through the trial. At last I
  got permission to have 'em burned in the courthouse furnace. And by that time
  I had formed an opinion."</p>

  <p>"You mean about America?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And about me and my job."</p>

  <p>"Are you still of the same opinion?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'm going to tell it to you. So get ready to laugh."</p>

  <p>Elsa didn't speak. She felt more like crying. The fierce intentness on
  Andrew's face recalled how he looked when her baby was being born.</p>

  <p>"At first," he said, "I thought of throwing up the law and turning
  politician. But I came across Lincoln's statement, and I thought so much
  about it that I soon had it by heart. Mind you, Lincoln's my hero. I'm
  quoting him exactly, word for word:</p>

  <p>"'Politicians are a set of men who have interests aside from the interests
  of the people, and who, to say the most for them, are at least one long step
  removed from honest men. I say this with greater freedom being a politician
  myself.'"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, is that what you thought I would laugh at?"</p>

  <p>"No. Wait. That's corning. It occurred to me that if Lincoln couldn't be
  honest in politics, probably no one can be. Jesus couldn't. Certainly I
  couldn't. But I could make a stab at being honest, and I owed that to my
  country, because I love my country. One thought led to another, beginning
  with the thought 'my country,' and leading on from that, trying to think
  honestly and throwing overboard all the pestilential tripe I'd learned in
  Sunday School about salvation by cruelty-torture on a cross and
  psalm-singing. Here's where the laugh comes in. Are you ready?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Thinking honestly for the first time, I began to see clearly. It was
  almost a knockout. I discovered that as long as there's a louse-priest, or a
  pimp-politician&mdash;a whore or a racketeer or a mad-dog evangelist crook in
  the United States; as long as there's a despicable financial buzzard
  preparing to rule a ruined world, or a hog-swill leader betraying his
  followers, or a tut-mouthed congressman lying for reelection&mdash;I'm it!
  It's my country."</p>

  <p>"Andrew!"</p>

  <p>"Laugh all you like. That's what I thought. It's what I still think. It's
  what I know."</p>

  <p>"And you left the United States on that account?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't. I became a reformer&mdash;of me. I took a good long look
  &mdash;and&mdash;think about the professional reformers, and at some private
  ones too. I decided: the hell with them all. There might be one who wasn't
  doing more harm than good. I couldn't find him. Anti-saloon leaguers,
  anti-vice crusaders, Watch and Ward keyhole peepers&mdash;
  Ku-Klux-Klan-sters&mdash;every last one of 'em that I could find was
  parasiting off the public he was supposed to be out to reform. I'd be ashamed
  to be a professional reformer, simply on the ground of what I actually know
  about 'em as a class and as individuals, first-hand. God! I'd as soon be a
  missionary!"</p>

  <p>"But you still haven't told why you left the United States."</p>

  <p>"I'm coming to it. I could reform me. Couldn't I? I could try, anyhow. So
  I got busy trying to avoid self-righteousness by bearing in mind that any
  rottenness I saw was in my own eye&mdash;the same way that color is in the
  eye of the looker. Started being honest with myself first. I found carving
  portraits in wood was a great help. Anything you can do with your hands helps
  train your mind. I tried hard, because I had to do something to keep my belly
  from turning over at the things I knew about my country&mdash;that's to say
  about me. Then I made a mistake."</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment. He had to force the rest out of himself. He hated
  doing it. Elsa's blood turned cold because she guessed again that he knew she
  had fallen in love with him and he was trying to cure her of it by revealing
  the unpalatable truth.</p>

  <p>"I fell in love."</p>

  <p>He shot the words out like a pronouncement of doom, then got up and walked
  away, to look over the ponies' rations and check up Bompo Tsering's
  rearrangement of the loads. Elsa sat still, numbed.</p>

  <p>"So it's a mistake to fall in love."</p>

  <p>She turned that over in her mind. Or it turned itself over. It repeated,
  again and again. She smiled wanly. It was hardly a gentle hint. It held none
  of Andrew's usual kindness. If he knew she loved him, as it seemed he did, it
  would have been more like him to say something straightforward about it. But
  she thought that perhaps all honest men hint clumsily and only the
  treacherous sort do it well. It was just Andrew being honest.</p>

  <p>Well, it was getting near daybreak. The moon had gone down. The few
  visible stars were already paling. The chill that heralds sunrise was like
  the chill on her heart, but night was nearly over. Was he still in love with
  that woman? Why was it a mistake? How could one help being in love? Can that
  which can't be helped be a mistake?</p>

  <p>"I'm glad I love him! It isn't a mistake. It can't be, because I didn't
  ask for it, and I couldn't help it. It's my right! I will love him forever!
  But I'll tell no one! It's my secret."</p>

  <p>She heard Andrew coming, sturdily crunching the snow. The bivouac was
  stirring; the Tibetans were boiling tea. But it was still dark, and the
  darkness felt like loneliness&mdash;forever.</p>

  <p>Andrew sat down beside her and resumed exactly where he had left off. His
  expression hadn't changed. It had been the other part of him that went the
  rounds of the bivouac.</p>

  <p>"She was the wrong girl," he said abruptly. "Wrong one for me. Sweet,
  sentimental, much too easy on the eye, if I'd only known it. If they look
  like the Mother of God, they're not fit to be mothers of men. Too easy on the
  ear. Voice like an angel's. Eyes like pools of intelligence. I don't see,
  even now, how I could have known better than to trust her with my whole heart
  and conscience."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, it isn't criminal to fall in love. Did she betray you?"</p>

  <p>"She did not&mdash;in the way you mean. She encouraged me in my
  determination to be absolutely honest, first with myself, then with her, so
  that we could both be honest with the world. Sex, for instance: we respected
  each other. We often talked about sex without ever once crossing the line. It
  got so that I used to save my thoughts, just to tell to her and to no one
  else."</p>

  <p>"Were you still practicing law?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Trying to drive law and honesty in double harness. Getting hopeful,
  too&mdash;not doing so badly. And then one day I took her boating&mdash; on a
  lake. I'd had a hard week. It was hot. It was nice out there on the lake in
  the motorboat, so we stayed until after dark. Then I learned we can only be
  honest one by one. You can't do it in droves. Not even two by two. It's a
  one-man, one-woman business."</p>

  <p>He paused for a full minute, so that Elsa thought he had decided to say no
  more. But he resumed abruptly:</p>

  <p>"I'd got so used to being honest with her&mdash;absolutely honest, and no
  ulterior motives or hidden meanings&mdash;that you couldn't have made me
  believe she'd misinterpret anything I'd say or do. She might not understand.
  She might ask for an explanation. But misinterpret&mdash;no. She'd be sure I
  was on the level, whatever I'd do."</p>

  <p>He paused again. He swallowed a couple of times. Then he looked at Elsa,
  but she looked away for fear of breaking the train of his thought.</p>

  <p>"I belonged at that time to a good, broad-minded gang&mdash;young married
  people mostly&mdash;but some unmarried ones&mdash;all up and coming and full
  of fun, without a sour one in the lot. Painters, musicians, a lawyer or
  two&mdash;a young college prof&mdash;a fellow who wrote stuff for the
  magazines&mdash;an actress&mdash;a couple of rich men's sons who weren't
  money-conscious. It was a good gang. We used to go bathing by moonlight, and
  we'd peel like kids at a waterhole, thinking no more of it &mdash;and seeing
  surely no more shame in it than in the couple of drinks we'd have later and
  the songs we'd sing on the way home."</p>

  <p>"Was it against the law to strip naked and swim?" Elsa asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I reckon maybe it was. There's a fool law against absolutely
  anything you want to do in the United States. That's what makes black-mail
  easy."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Andrew. I didn't mean to interrupt. I'm listening."</p>

  <p>"That evening I felt hot. I craved a swim. It was the place where I was
  used to swimming with the friends I've just told you about. There was no one
  near&mdash;no other boat&mdash;no chance of scandalizing any mugwumps. I had
  nothing on but a shirt and a pair of slacks. I pulled 'em off and dived in,
  feeling grateful to be with a girl who'd see no harm."</p>

  <p>"And what happened?"</p>

  <p>"She never spoke to me again. Never again. I swam around awhile, and
  called out to her once or twice to jump in and join me. But she didn't
  answer. When I climbed into the boat, I couldn't get her to speak. She
  wouldn't open her lips. I had to return to the car and drive her home to her
  mother's house without one word from her. She shut the door in my face. That
  was a Saturday night. Sunday morning I phoned. No answer. Afternoon the same.
  Evening the same&mdash;no answer. Monday I went to work. Some time Monday she
  committed suicide."</p>

  <p>"Oh!&mdash;Andrew!"</p>

  <p>"She left a letter addressed to me. It was found by the police. A cop who
  had reason to hate my guts let some reporters see it. Selections from it made
  the evening paper in a box on the front page. Next morning I had an eight-
  column headline to myself, with a portrait and full biography to date."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, how awful!"</p>

  <p>"It was all that. In her letter she said I had broken her heart. I had
  destroyed her trust in man. I had captured her love by cunning words about
  integrity and self-respect&mdash;and then I had debauched it&mdash;that was
  the word she used&mdash;debauched it for a moment's physical pleasure. Life,
  she said, for herself was no longer worth living, but she prayed that God
  would have mercy on me."</p>

  <p>"How did she kill herself?"</p>

  <p>"Shot. She used my revolver, that I got a permit for at the time of the
  trial that I told you about, when that political boss's friends were trying
  to pick off his opponents one by one. I never had to use the damned thing. I
  left it in her mother's house one night because it was bulky and heavy. I
  forgot it&mdash;never thought of it again until she shot herself and the
  police identified it. After that they arrested me."</p>

  <p>"Andrew&mdash;did you have to stand trial?"</p>

  <p>"No. The Grand Jury found no true bill&mdash;threw it out. But that's why
  I left the United States. You see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused a moment, squaring his chest unconsciously, throwing back his
  head in a gesture that was one hundred per cent Andrew.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;I could have stood it that no one believed my story. In fact,
  after the Grand jury session I left off telling it. I just shut up. It didn't
  sicken me too badly to be dropped socially&mdash;high-hatted by men and women
  whose debaucheries I knew plenty about&mdash;couldn't help knowing. I could
  have lived all that down. But what good would it do?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, did your friends desert you&mdash;I mean, for instance, those you
  went bathing naked with?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. Some damned rat-reporter got hold of their names. They were as mad
  at me as if I'd disgraced 'em on purpose. One of 'em did sort of half
  apologize for passing me up. He said he believed my story, but he couldn't
  afford to be seen in my company because he had his job and his social
  position to consider. That wasn't the trouble. I didn't blame 'em. I wasn't
  even sore at 'em&mdash;not at them, I wasn't. What got under my skin was
  this."</p>

  <p>He paused again. He stood up. There was dim light shimmering on gray
  clouds in the distance&mdash;false dawn. He looked down at Elsa:</p>

  <p>"How could I reconcile that&mdash;I mean what had happened&mdash;with my
  own new theory about me and my native land?" He became angry. He was girding
  again for the battle. "If it's in my own eye, I'll get it out of my
  eye&mdash;somehow!" His voice, without becoming louder, grew more vehement:
  "I've learned this much: you can't tell all you know; and you mustn't trust
  anyone else to understand what may be clearer to you than your name in a
  printed book."</p>

  <p>He looked down again at Elsa. "And now the answer. I don't know the
  answer. But I will never return to the U.S.A. until I do know it. If, as, and
  when I go back, it'll be in the full knowledge that I've something to give to
  my country. That I'll be useful&mdash;an asset&mdash;not one of the damned
  reformers&mdash;not a politician either&mdash;nor a meddler, but a leader of
  men. Until I know which way to lead, I'll be damned if I'll take a chance on
  leading wrong: Maybe I'll go home some day."</p>

  <p>He strode away from the tent where all eyes could see him:</p>

  <p>"Bompo Tsering!" he shouted. "All hands make-ready to march in fifteen
  minutes!" Then he glanced again at Elsa. "Will you fix something for
  breakfast for you and me? This is the wrong time to get poisoned. But let's
  eat. There'll be a long day's march."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch46"
     id="ch46">CHAPTER 46</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The thaw had set in seriously. The going wasn't any too
  good; it was particularly bad for the remnant of loaded sheep that had to be
  carried through soft drifts. Andrew pressed forward because at that altitude
  the wind gets up at about ten o'clock and it's worse than war fighting
  against it. First, though, the corpse had to be disposed of, although that
  was no great problem. In Tibet there is no respect for a corpse; it is
  something that the dead man has no further use for. It belongs now to nature.
  The wild animals may have it, the sooner the better. The mortal remains of
  Ugly-face's dead companion were left sitting upright in a snowdrift, naked.
  Less than five minutes after the start wolves could be heard fighting one
  another and the vultures.</p>

  <p>The three days' march after that was a torment, that left no energy for
  conversation. The only thought was of the distance made, and of fatigue and
  how to carry on. But the luck held. They reached the wind-swept ledges before
  the thaw made the plain impassable, and it was the thaw that saved them from
  being overtaken by some cavalry from Lhasa. The phony lama, who hadn't
  condescended to tell Andrew his worshipful name, borrowed his binoculars and
  confirmed his guess they were from Lhasa. They had modern rifles and were
  well mounted. They were the pursuing party that Ambrose St. Malo had
  expected, that he had lied about, saying they were his friends. They got
  stuck in the mud that overlay frozen clay. Not long after that the mud became
  an ocean of roaring water hurrying down the watershed. So the cavalry turned
  back, to re-cross the river. Probably their bodies reached the Bay of
  Bengal.</p>

  <p>After that, because there was no more danger of immediate pursuit, Ambrose
  St. Malo became much less self-effacing, and Bulah Singh ceased to be meek.
  His feet no longer troubled him. He and St. Malo trudged side by side,
  exploring each other's minds, letting Andrew carry all the burden of the days
  and all the worries of the nights.</p>

  <p>Andrew made a few attempts to get in conversation with Ugly-face, but
  without much success. The old man strode along like a mountaineer, in spite
  of his big belly. He seemed as unconcerned as a drover. Hardship didn't
  bother him. Andrew favored him as much as possible, giving Elsa double
  quantities of soft rations to share with him when the others weren't looking.
  He hadn't come by that huge belly on a diet of parched barley and rotten yak;
  deprivation of luxuries would fall harder on him than on others. But he ate
  what he was given without comment, accepting favors as his natural right, as
  calmly as he would have ignored their absence. He didn't seem even to notice
  the phony lama's insolence. Humiliated and resentful because Andrew had taken
  his scarecrow pony to lighten the loads of his own emaciated beasts, the
  phony lama victimized the old man in every possible way, at every
  opportunity. He even forced him to carry his bundle of belongings, until
  Andrew spotted it and threw the bundle into a snowdrift. It cost the phony
  lama half an hour's work to get it out again. After that Andrew gave Elsa
  what amounted to orders:</p>

  <p>"Can't you ride beside him all the rest of the journey, so he can hold
  your stirrup if he needs to, or lay a hand on the pony's neck?"</p>

  <p>She was afraid. She protested: "But Andrew, I'm sure he wants me to keep
  away from him. He doesn't wish to be recognized. He doesn't wish to be asked
  questions. No intimacies. I'm quite sure."</p>

  <p>Andrew turned his back to the wind and stood still, so she drew rein
  &mdash;eagerly, because though they had continued to share a tent together,
  he had been more than usually reticent since he told her his story. He might
  be going to open up again&mdash;to resume confidences. But he didn't.</p>

  <p>"See here," he said, "it's just as easy to be silent when you know, as
  when you don't know. You haven't had to talk because you knows the lowdown
  about me. If what he wants is silence, let him have it. I'm asking you to
  ride beside him and protect him. When I try to help him a bit that phony lama
  turns on both of us and accuses him of trying to tempt me to go in some other
  direction. It's the same old story of the ex-servant wreaking savagery on the
  aristocrat when he gets him at his mercy. Your friend Monsieur X is paying
  for having trusted the wrong man."</p>

  <p>"He pays gallantly," Elsa objected. "He never murmurs."</p>

  <p>"So you don't want to ride beside him?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I'd like to do whatever you wish but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted: "Does he know English? I'll ask him."</p>

  <p>He strode up to Old Ugly-face, searching memory, recalling as well as he
  could the intricate, almost fantastic details of rumored intrigues in Lhasa
  &mdash;wondering at the man's present condition, for he had fallen from high
  estate like Milton's Lucifer. He looked at Andrew quizzically, reading his
  thought. His fierce eyes and funny old beak of a nose suggested pained
  surprise that any man of breeding could be so impertinent. After a moment's
  stare he said in English, that was at any rate better than Bompo
  Tsering's:</p>

  <p>"Curiosity being a vice of fools and the path to too many hells."</p>

  <p>Andrew chose at once to do what he was being blamed for. He asked: did he
  wish to be taken to the Shig-po-ling monastery? Ugly-face answered simply
  that he would go wherever wisdom might lead. Then he looked at Andrew again
  suddenly. His eyes twinkled. His leathery old face broke into wrinkles and
  rippled with humor. He said two words, making one of them, as they do in
  Tibet:</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain." Then he added: "Seeing him soon!"</p>

  <p>"Damn!" said Andrew. He had believed he had a surprise in store for Tom
  and for Old Ugly-face, too. But if Ugly-face knew where Tom Grayne was, he
  had probably also known of Andrew's march and return with supplies, and what
  route he would take. Had Tom Grayne told him? How? Had Ugly-face used occult,
  psychic, mental means to guide his party across Andrew's trail, without the
  phony lama or Ambrose St. Malo having guessed they were being steered? No use
  asking. But Andrew was curious to know whether Ugly-face knew his name. He
  might have heard it from Bompo Tsering. He tried a few tricks to get
  Ugly-face to address him by name. The old oriental eyes twinkled again. He
  remarked:</p>

  <p>"What men doing presently revealing what their being. Soon my knowing your
  being&mdash;doing. Name no matter."</p>

  <p>Well, at least they were getting on terms. One might say, inside terms.
  High dignitaries of the most involved religion in the world don't waste
  epigrams on people who don't interest them. Andrew came to the point. He
  asked outright whether Elsa might not ride beside him.</p>

  <p>The answer was prompt: "My not being leader here. What your being?" He
  didn't even glance toward Elsa. His bright stare into Andrew's eyes suggested
  mockery, but along with it tolerance&mdash;deep understanding. Understanding
  of what? Andrew gave it up. He beckoned to Elsa. From then on she and Old
  Ugly-face were road companions, sharing a measureless silence. The old man
  accepted the occasional aid of a stirrup. Now and then, in the difficult
  places, he rested a hand on the pony's neck, or on its rump. But ride he
  would not, though she dismounted many a time and offered her pony. He simply
  scowled her into silence, shook his head and trudged forward. Of conversation
  there was none&mdash;not even speech between them.</p>

  <p>So Elsa had time and nothing to do but think. Gradually, little by little,
  she gave up Andrew. Unlove him, she could not. She would not try to. But she
  could deny herself, for his sake. She surrendered him to his own future,
  cutting loose one by one the tentacles of thought that seemed to bind them
  together. It didn't hurt so much as she had believed it would. It seemed
  clear that Andrew craved to be left alone to build his own destiny from what
  he could find in the deeps of his own heart. So it was a secret gift to
  Andrew. Life was working in him, as yeast works. It was kindness to let him
  alone. Kindness was all she had to give.</p>

  <p>So, though they used one tent, and though she cooked his meals, they
  shared no thoughts, so far as either of them knew. Andrew had plenty to keep
  his thought occupied, and to guard against, with Bulah Singh and St. Malo
  evidently trying, like a pair of mutually contemptuous conspirators, to reach
  an agreement for treachery, murder and loot. He had to watch like a lynx, to
  prevent his own men from being seduced by the others into some hair-brained
  plot. His full attention was occupied.</p>

  <p>But to Elsa it seemed that his self-revelation that night had closed a
  door between him and herself. It was as if he truly believed what he had said
  then, that to understand is to despise. Did he know that she loved him? Did
  he despise her for having been unfaithful in her heart to Tom Grayne? Or did
  he believe that she despised him&mdash;on account of his tragedy&mdash; she
  who loved him with all her heart of hearts and only craved to help him to
  forget! There was no guessing. She knew it would be no use asking. Silence
  was better-silence, courtesy and a show of courage. But God, oh God, how
  wrong an honest man can be!</p>

  <p>What really kept Elsa's courage alive was her road companion's silence. It
  was like that of a charged storage battery. No throb, no thrum, no sight or
  sound of power. But power was in him. One knew it. Only a fool wouldn't know
  it. It was rooted deep in such humility as only the great can attain. It was
  included, she knew, within his will not to resist his own personal karma,
  caused in former lives by faults that he must purge in this life. The revenge
  of the past meant nothing to him. Humiliation and fatigue were nothing. There
  was no profit and loss in his calculation.</p>

  <p>She remembered the first and all-important precept, taught that night of
  nights in the initiation chamber at Gombaria's:</p>

  <p>"In superconsciousness, toward which we evolve, all is, and all is free
  and unconditioned. So, therefore, should the motive and the argument, of
  profit or of loss, enter into this consciousness, for oneself or for another,
  by that much we shut the door to superconsciousness and we deny ourselves
  true vision. Thus we become lost again in the unprofitable wilderness of our
  illusion."</p>

  <p>She knew it by heart. She said it over and over again to herself as she
  rode beside Monsieur X. She didn't dare to call him by his right name, even
  in secret thought. He had forbidden. His word was law. Her reverence for him
  had nothing whatever to do with his present condition or with what she knew
  of his past. At Gombaria's she had seen him in all his glory, unimprisoned by
  time and space, transcending by infinities the same man, the mere mortal
  statesman whom she had seen leading an army, capturing the Thunder Dragon
  Gate, ordering the whip for monks who needed the corruption beaten out of
  them. He could be cruel. Or was it cruelty? She remembered his verdict:</p>

  <p>"Persons offending personally needing personal rebuke!"</p>

  <p>An amazing mixture of a man, three states of consciousness in one. The
  rebuke, she remembered, was in no case less than fifty lashes with a rawhide
  whip. She had wondered then, as she wondered now, riding beside him, how
  anyone who believed in karma and reincarnation, could inflict such cruelty on
  others, knowing well it must return upon himself, sooner or later, somewhere,
  sometime. But then she remembered his other remark:</p>

  <p>"There being duty. Duty&mdash;neglect&mdash;because&mdash;fearing
  &mdash;consequences being greater sin than anger. People-taking-oath-of-
  holiness, neglecting to be holy, blasphemously mouthing piety like monkeys
  &mdash;perpetrating dirtiness and murder&mdash;envying, stealing, lying,
  setting bad example&mdash;huh!&mdash;flogging it out of them-huh! Greatest
  good of greatest number!" He had added, after a moment, staring at her:
  "Therefore wise ones not hurrying too fast toward beatitude, because as
  above, so below: the more the blessed knowledge, the greater the cursed sin.
  Go slow!"</p>

  <p>Now, though he made no remarks, she felt her own thoughts, her sorrow,
  even her loneliness yield and give place to another consciousness. It was not
  wholly unlike the calm produced by organ music. She perceived, knew, almost
  captured in thought and framed in words the key of the mystery that her
  companion pondered as he marched. He was reaching, reaching upward, carrying
  her thought with his, raised by his spirit. He was opening his consciousness
  to Idea, his inner eye to Vision, his inner ear to Rhythm whence inspiration
  comes. So Elsa's heart too was lightened, as by inner sunshine, and for
  moments on end she understood the meaning of the law that he who will save
  his life shall lose it. Earth and its agonies&mdash;rainbows and their
  promises, are shadows of things to come. The shadow-lurker, the
  rainbow-hunter and the jackal are brothers. The glamour of captains and kings
  is the glitter of Life where it touches the waves of illusion. For moments on
  end she lived above intellect, beyond reason. Thought was wordless, like the
  vivid dreams, which waking veils again behind dreary realism.</p>

  <p>From that high consciousness, looking downward, as she could look down at
  the tragic valleys from the trail they climbed, at last she objectively saw
  her own dilemma&mdash;herself, Tom Grayne, Andrew. Tom Grayne and herself.
  She was Tom's wife. She loved Andrew. God, how she loved him! Andrew did not
  love her. No doubt he liked her. She liked Tom Grayne, and no doubt Tom
  Grayne thought well of her, but love her he did not, nor ever would&mdash;
  nor she him. For love of dignity and pride if nothing else, she would not let
  liking serve as an excuse for clinging like a limpet to a man who craved
  freedom. Both men were chivalrous. Neither should have excuse or opportunity
  from her to sacrifice as much as one more hour for her sake. As Andrew had so
  often insisted, she too had rights. Rights are spiritual, won and kept by
  spiritual courage. There is no such thing as a material right. She had the
  spiritual right to take herself out of their lives&mdash;to refuse to resist
  the clash of conflicting forces&mdash;to rise above those forces, harming
  neither man, leaving each to his own destiny, while she attended her own. She
  saw her way clear&mdash;not in detail&mdash;only its direction. It looked as
  lonely and as barren as the man's who strode beside her. But it did have
  dignity. She would not be the first who had faced Tibet without material
  resources in reserve. There had, for instance, been Nancy Strong.</p>

  <p>The well-remembered trail along the ledges zigzagged toward the ravine
  where Tom Grayne was supposed to be waiting. Three more days, and at last, on
  a crag in the distance, the Shig-po-ling monastery glistened into view like a
  shiny mud-wasps' nest. She could see the roof bells through Andrew's
  binoculars. The phony lama's face became as greedy as a buzzard's. He was
  already counting the price he would get for betraying Ugly-face. A blind man
  could have guessed that. Greed and shamelessness are one; he even tried to
  search his former master for parched barley or some other food that perhaps
  he had secreted with a view to escape. Elsa signaled and Andrew saw that. He
  landed a punch on the phony lama that nearly knocked him off the ledge. Then
  crisis came.</p>

  <p>Bulah Singh, egged on by St. Malo, seized that moment to take Andrew off
  guard and kill him. He rushed him suddenly&mdash;hurled his weight against
  him, trying to force him over the cliff backward. No one dared to interfere.
  Andrew reeled over the edge, clinging to Bulah Singh, who beat at him with
  both fists, kneeling, bracing his legs against a rock. For nearly a minute
  they swayed in the balance, until Andrew's strength at last prevailed and he
  hauled himself back to the ledge. The Sikh shook himself loose and fled out
  of reach, scrambling between Elsa and the cliff to reach the one pony whose
  turn it was to carry no load. The pony kicked him and he almost went over the
  ledge a second time. He recoiled toward St. Malo, limping.</p>

  <p>Then St. Malo pulled an ace out of his sleeve and played it with ruthless
  cunning. Using his left like a trained fighter, he jabbed at the Sikh's face.
  He caught him off balance. He jabbed again and again. Bulah Singh staggered.
  He recovered. He staggered again. He tried to throw himself forward on hands
  and knees. But the fist jabbed him again too quickly. He screamed hoarsely
  and reeled backward off the ledge to the rocks a hundred feet below.</p>

  <p>No one spoke for a moment, except Bompo Tsering. He sent a man down to
  strip the body and leave it naked for the birds. After that, the first who
  spoke was Ambrose St. Malo. Chafing his knuckles, he approached Andrew,
  rather skillfully assuming a casual, well-bred manner, stage Englishman
  style. It was only very vaguely overdone. His accent was unpleasant, but his
  manner might have been almost disarming if it hadn't been for the pistol that
  Andrew had let him keep. Its bulge was visible, inside his overcoat.</p>

  <p>"Well. I had an idea, if I waited long enough, I'd have an opportunity to
  prove whose side I'm on."</p>

  <p>He continued chafing his knuckles, where he had cut them a little on Bulah
  Singh's teeth. No one spoke. He pulled on his fur glove. Then he patted the
  bulge of the pistol.</p>

  <p>"It was good judgment to trust me with this. I didn't draw it, to shoot
  that dog of a Sikh, for the same reason that you didn't draw yours. The
  gesture might have been misunderstood."</p>

  <p>No answer from anyone. St. Malo's eyes held steady. Their intelligence,
  expression, color were almost beautiful; but beneath the surface they were
  cold, like the eyes of a robot. His lips smiled pleasantly, but his voice
  gave the lie to the smile:</p>

  <p>"Ever since we met, that wash-out has been trying to get me to shoot you.
  He was self-hypnotized. Obsessed by an idea. He wanted to get possession of
  your girl friend and to put her to use." At last he favored Elsa with one of
  his cold glances: "Yes, young lady! Bulah Singh believed that through you
  he'd be able to control your husband."</p>

  <p>The silence at last told on him. It wore him down. He had to acknowledge
  it.</p>

  <p>"Hell," he remarked. "What is this? A seance? Can't anyone speak?"</p>

  <p>Andrew blew his whistle, one blast, meaning stand by. "Time's up," he
  said. "Hand over your pistol."</p>

  <p>"But surely you understand now that I'm on your side&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew took one stride forward and plunged his hand into the breast of St.
  Malo's overcoat. It was a Tibetan coat; it had the usual voluminous bokkus.
  He pulled out the Smith and Wesson, unloaded it and stowed it away in Elsa's
  saddle-bag:</p>

  <p>"Play Number One having failed, Play Two, I expect, would be to take a
  shot at me. That's stymied. Have you Play Three ready?"</p>

  <p>St. Malo smiled. He looked scornful and rather surprised. "I had begun to
  think you were a sensible man."</p>

  <p>"I didn't invite your opinion," Andrew answered.</p>

  <p>"Andrew Gunning, I'm a safe man to bet on. I'm a dangerous man to deny! I
  have dealt myself in on this expedition."</p>

  <p>"Tell that to Tom Grayne," Andrew retorted.</p>

  <p>He blew his whistle again. The column moved forward. Ambrose St. Malo
  shrugged insolent shoulders and strode ahead to where the phony lama waited,
  trembling, impatient. They two walked side by side, talking, continually
  glancing backward to see where Andrew was. Before pressing forward for word
  with Bompo Tsering, Andrew spoke to Elsa:</p>

  <p>"Keep an eye on 'em. Please. Watch 'em carefully. Either they don't wish
  to be overheard, or they do wish me to think they're plotting something.
  Either way means trouble. The trail is tough from here on. I'll be busy. So
  take this whistle. If they quit talking and you spot they're starting
  anything, blow three long blasts to warn me."</p>

  <p>Then he was gone, to overtake Bompo Tsering. He strode past St. Malo and
  the phony lama as if they weren't there.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch47"
     id="ch47">CHAPTER 47</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The trail reached the limit beyond which even the yaks could
  no longer climb unaided. They and the ponies had to be lifted or else
  unloaded and then reloaded when their packs had been carried up by hand. In
  places the ledge was less than three feet wide, with an impending cliff on
  the right hand. The slippery rock was like a devil's stairway. But it was the
  last lap; the animals knew it; so they got along without accident, everyone
  lending a hand. When the phony lama made the mistake of refusing to work,
  Andrew kicked him and made him put his shoulder under a pony's rump to help
  it scramble while Andrew took the worst of the strain. That was a mistake. He
  should have known better. Fake dignity can't endure too much humiliation. His
  life wasn't worth ten cents from that minute, if it should be up to the
  lama.</p>

  <p>Tom Grayne's secret hiding-place was away up on the face of a cliff, at
  least a thousand feet above that terrific trail. It was utterly impossible to
  reach with the pack animals. There were two ways to it, and Andrew knew the
  landmarks; but one way would have made a wild goat hesitate, and the other
  was a cascade, iced over by the frozen vapor from a hot spring. However,
  there was a more accessible and much larger cavern lower down, where they had
  cached quite a lot of fodder left over from last year's expedition. It wasn't
  secret, like Tom Grayne's cave; it was too close to the trail, and too near
  to a weird community of hermits, who are the least talkative but most
  vigilant spies in the world. It was that lower cavern that Andrew headed for,
  hoping Tom Grayne bad seen them from far off and would save him the trouble
  of climbing to the hide-out.</p>

  <p>He scrambled to the head of the line, to get first word with Tom in case
  he should have come down from the hide-out. He had a notion it might be wise
  to break the news about Elsa before Elsa and Tom could confront each other.
  Elsa's unexpected arrival might embarrass Tom, and his embarrassment might be
  a shock to her. Andrew's own dread that three good friends might lose their
  friendship in a collision of wills where each had done his honorable best
  according to his lights&mdash;was something that he kept out of his mind,
  imprisoned behind the veil that even Elsa's clairvoyance couldn't penetrate.
  He suspected what Elsa was feeling. He proposed to spare her as much as he
  could.</p>

  <p>And as he led the way around a projecting spur of cliff, there Tom was,
  striding toward him&mdash;the same Tom Grayne, except that his beard was more
  unkempt. He was clean, but a bit ragged from a winter's hard living. He was
  wearing the same old windproof hunting suit and laced boots, although he
  usually wore Tibetan clothing. So Andrew concluded that they were in no
  danger of being seen by monastery scouts. He stood where he was, to block the
  trail behind him and swap the first news without being overheard. The wind
  was blustering along the ledge and what they said to each other couldn't have
  been heard six feet away.</p>

  <p>"How's Elsa?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p>"The baby died. She's fine. I have her with me."</p>

  <p>Tom froze. It was almost imperceptible, like the effect of a blow in the
  ring. One couldn't guess what he felt. He recovered instantly.</p>

  <p>"You're a day early," he said.</p>

  <p>"A day late," Andrew answered.</p>

  <p>"I expected you tomorrow," said Tom. "I heard of your getting hung up at
  the Shigatse River when the ferry broke away. So I counted out two days.
  Someone else with you, isn't there?"</p>

  <p>"You bet. Your spies must have been busy."</p>

  <p>"Lobsang Pun?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Old Ugly-face in person."</p>

  <p>"Good," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;but&mdash;also&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know. Ambrose St. Malo."</p>

  <p>"How did you know? Were you expecting him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Who else?"</p>

  <p>"Some unarmed Tibetans and a sham-lama who can't even pray without making
  mistakes. You'll have trouble with him too."</p>

  <p>"Okay. We'll fix him. Where's the other who was with Old Ugly-face?</p>

  <p>"Dead. Ugly-face gave him the proper obsequies."</p>

  <p>Tom nodded: "That other fellow was a good guy, but soft&mdash;couldn't
  take it. Now Lobsang Pun hasn't a friend in the world&mdash;barring us. Did
  he say much on the road?"</p>

  <p>"Snubbed me a couple of times."</p>

  <p>"Oh. Likes you, does he? That's good. Even so, he'll be a handful." Tom
  grinned at last. "He and I are old enemies. Friends to the last ditch.
  Enemies at the drop of a hat. There isn't a move on the board that he
  wouldn't play against me. So watch out."</p>

  <p>"Any news at this end?" Andrew didn't dare to use the name of the young
  Dalai Lama, even with that wind blowing and the curve of a cliff between him
  and the men.</p>

  <p>Tom nodded. "The infant Dalai Lama is in the monastery. He's for sale to
  the highest bidder. The latest high bid is from Hitler's Gestapo outfit
  &mdash;by secret courier from Lhasa."</p>

  <p>"Did the courier get through?"</p>

  <p>"He's dead. But we'll have to work fast."</p>

  <p>"Any trouble with your Tibetans?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Two died. Three couldn't stick it. I've two left. How's Bompo
  Tsering?"</p>

  <p>"Getting wise," said Andrew. "Good headman. He's learned how to make the
  others do most of the work. But he needs watching. He'd bribe himself if no
  one else 'ud do it."</p>

  <p>"Okay. We'll fix him too. Has he spotted the prelate?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>Tom grinned again. "We'll see. Have you brought some jam?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Plenty of soft tack."</p>

  <p>"Good. Where's Elsa?"</p>

  <p>Andrew moved his head to indicate that she was somewhere down along the
  trail beyond the bulge of the cliff. The trail was so narrow just there that
  Andrew had to hug the cliff to get out of Tom's way and let him pass.</p>

  <p>"Look out for the yaks around the bend," he advised.</p>

  <p>Yaks are as unpredictable as camels, but the wind was the wrong way. The
  leading yak was around the corner of the cliff. So it couldn't have been
  smell, hearing, or eyesight that set the brute going the moment Tom moved.
  Either the phony lama or else St. Malo or one of their men prodded the
  leading yak in the rump with a sharp goad. It came around the corner like an
  avalanche. There wasn't room to get out of the way, nor time nor room for
  either man to shoot. Tom Grayne seized it by the horns, slithered on ice and
  raw rock and hung three thousand feet sheer above a ravine that howled in the
  wind as if all the devils in a Tantric Buddhist's hell were clamoring for
  victims. Somehow or other he clung to the yak's horns. Andrew vaulted the
  loaded yak. At the risk of being trampled to death he seized Tom's arms and
  hauled him back to safety, letting the frightened beast go hurrying alone
  along the trail.</p>

  <p>"God, you weigh a ton," he remarked.</p>

  <p>There was no time to say more&mdash;nothing more to be said. Elsa came,
  riding alone. Not far behind her, beyond the turn, Bompo Tsering was holding
  back the column. Elsa got down off her pony.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Tom, I'm glad! I was afraid the yak had&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Near thing," he answered. "Gunning saved me." He was rubbing his wrists
  that had taken a grueling punishment from the yak's horns, but he left off
  doing it to take Elsa in his arms. They kissed. Then Elsa's face pressed his
  shoulder:</p>

  <p>"Tom, our baby died."</p>

  <p>"I know it."</p>

  <p>"Tom, I did my uttermost best to be the mother of your son, and to
  &mdash;" She was crying.</p>

  <p>"I know. I know." He sounded grieved. He looked grieved. He was. But it
  was because she was suffering. "You shouldn't have come back," he said,
  clumsily gentle. "Gunning could have brought the news." His voice was as kind
  as a lover's, but he didn't say bad news. He patted her back and waited for
  her to cease crying, but he looked too patient, as if restraining a storm
  inside himself.</p>

  <p>"You agreed to stay in India. Why did you come?" he asked&mdash;kindly
  again, almost too kind.</p>

  <p>"Must I tell it here&mdash;now?"</p>

  <p>"No, of course not. Let's go to the cavern."</p>

  <p>But Tom didn't move, for a moment. She looked up at him through tear-
  dimmed eyes. He glanced from her to Andrew.</p>

  <p>"No," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>Tom grinned, not exactly incredulous, but alert. "Aren't you quick on the
  uptake? I asked no question."</p>

  <p>Andrew retorted: "I saved you the need."</p>

  <p>"Thanks.&mdash;Where's Ugly-face?"</p>

  <p>"He is near the rear of the column," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>"Okay. We'll let him follow. Let's go to the cavern."</p>

  <p>Elsa put her arm through the pony's reins and Tom led the way. But Andrew
  turned back, partly to let Tom and Elsa be alone together&mdash;partly to
  prevent any last-minute treachery. As he took the wall of St. Malo, St. Malo
  grinned in his face&mdash;superior, indulgent, sly:</p>

  <p>"Still alive, brother cat? We'll come to terms," he said. "You wait and
  see."</p>

  <p>Andrew ignored him. He walked on.</p>

  <p>"Come back!" St. Malo called. "I want to talk to you. It's important."</p>

  <p>Andrew slipped into a recess in the cliff and waited there out of bullet
  range until the rear of the column caught up. Old Ugly-face was walking last,
  alone, and for once he looked worn out utterly exhausted from the long march.
  Andrew offered him a shoulder to rest his hand on. The old man accepted:</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun," he said, "your being having done your task&mdash;your doing
  well. Now mine beginning."</p>

  <p>He hummed a mantra. Clinging to Andrew's shoulder with a grip like iron,
  he hummed all the way along the ledge as they brought up the rear of the
  column. He only paused once when Andrew interrupted:</p>

  <p>"Can you help Elsa? She needs it. She thinks so highly of you that&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face turned on him, scowling. His eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"Your being thief? Your robbing her? Your stealing her opportunity to help
  herself?"</p>

  <p>He resumed the mantra. It was like the music of the spheres.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch48"
     id="ch48">CHAPTER 48</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was a grand cavern, as big as a church, well protected
  from prevailing winds and warmed by a hot spring that you could hear gurgling
  inside the rock. At the far end there was an easy climb into another, smaller
  cavern that was ventilated by a long fissure. Fuel had been the worst
  problem, but Tom had solved that; he had found tons of yak-dung, in a valley,
  miles away and had had it piled up near the entrance. If the place had been a
  bit more private, it would have been perfect. It was too near the trail, too
  easy to find by accident.</p>

  <p>Andrew posted a lookout while Bompo Tsering stabled the animals in the
  lower cavern. Having eaten nothing but barley for days on end they were
  greedy for the stored hay. Their delight in the warmth and good forage had an
  effect on the humans. There was a kind of Christmassy feel in the air,
  suggesting the manger in Bethlehem&mdash;a home-coming. Tom and Elsa were
  sitting together at the foot of the ascending ramp, deep in conversation. No
  one disturbed them.</p>

  <p>The phony lama broke the almost mystic spell. The man's stupidity was next
  to incredible. To call attention to himself he grossly insulted Old Ugly-
  face, ordered him into the coldest corner of the cavern and commanded two men
  to watch him. Old Ugly-face made no protest, but St. Malo seemed to be
  hesitating whether to stand pat or to draw cards. It was his chance, should
  he choose, to turn on the phony lama and repudiate him. He hadn't a good
  poker face; he evidently despised the man; he let his lip curl and scratched
  his face with his thumb to hide his mouth. He seemed unable to make up his
  mind. Andrew was no help to him&mdash;gave him no hint.</p>

  <p>It was Tom's lead now. The end of the trail had automatically reduced
  Andrew to chief of staff or second-in-command. He didn't even choose to
  suggest a line of action or to interrupt Tom, but he did order all the
  bedding and personal loads carried up the ramp to the upper cavern. He went
  up after them and had them arranged in a circle. The same old canvas tent-fly
  was in place at the far end, concealing the pool of warm running water that
  was as good as a civilized bathroom. He took a longing glance in there. There
  was soap, towels&mdash;Tom had been using the place. But he resisted
  temptation, there was too much else to do. Before following the men back to
  the lower cavern he put his briefcase in plain view beside his bedding roll.
  Elsa was on her way up, but beyond giving her a hand over the steepest rock
  and noticing that she was no longer crying he learned nothing from her. She
  avoided his eyes. All he said to her was:</p>

  <p>"My brief-case is a trap. Don't move it."</p>

  <p>Below, Tom had taken charge. At the foot of the ramp he was addressing the
  phony lama with the high-falutin phrases due to a man of rank. Tom was an
  expert at that stuff. He knew all the rituals. He fooled the fellow, urging
  him to lead the way to the upper cavern, where they might hold a conference
  without being overheard by underlings. The phony lama bestowed a phony
  blessing on him, whirled his prayer wheel a few dozen times and went up, like
  a puppet out of The Mikado, with all the dignity possible considering he had
  to pick up his skirts and crawl on hands and knees a good part of the way. He
  wasn't as active as Elsa. St. Malo went up after him without being
  invited.</p>

  <p>Tom grinned then at Andrew. "Let's see," he said, "whether Bompo Tsering
  knows.&mdash;Want to bet?"</p>

  <p>"One U.S. dime," said Andrew. "Betting with you means giving away money.
  You ask him."</p>

  <p>Tom didn't. He merely glanced at Bompo Tsering with raised eyebrows, and
  from him to Old Ugly-face. Immediately, without a word said, Bompo Tsering
  approached Old Ugly-face, knelt and laid his forehead on the floor in front
  of him. Ugly-face leaned forward, touched him with a blessing and stood up.
  His eyes glittered. His leathery face rippled. His owl's beak of a nose
  twitched with humor.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he opened his mouth and solid laughter roared up from his
  belly.</p>

  <p>"Oo-hah-ha-ha-ha-ha-hah! Tum-Glain!"</p>

  <p>Just as suddenly he shut up. But he walked forward.</p>

  <p>"Your dime," said Andrew. He produced a mascot coin from an inner pocket.
  Tom held out his hand, but Old Ugly-face snatched the coin and examined it
  curiously. At last he stowed it away in his own capacious bokkus.</p>

  <p>"Now having money," he said, looking quite serious.</p>

  <p>Tom smiled slowly and said never a word, but a blind mute could have
  guessed there was a show-down coming. All the Tibetans laid their foreheads
  on the floor, including the phony lama's men. Tom touched Bompo Tsering with
  his foot. Bompo Tsering got up. Tom whispered to him. Bompo Tsering went out
  of the cave to summon the two Tibetans from Tom's hide-out as a precaution in
  case the phony lama's men should get panicky and try to grab the upper
  hand.</p>

  <p>Things were going like clockwork. The phony lama was having plenty of time
  in the upper cavern to confer with St. Malo. Between them they were likely to
  make lots of mistakes, especially with Elsa watching them. They might even
  quarrel; most fools do, in a tight spot. Tom seemed to have everything
  figured out. He and Ugly-face understood each other&mdash;no ceremony
  &mdash;man to man&mdash;watching points&mdash;trusting each other, and as
  mistrustful as poker players. Tom whispered. Ugly-face nodded. Tom beckoned
  Andrew and they climbed to the upper cavern, where the phony lama was seated
  on Andrew's roll of bedding. He had undone the cordage and made himself
  pretty comfortable, arranging it so that his seat was the highest and he sat
  with his back to the light that poured through the hole in the cavern wall.
  Elsa had found the hot bath irresistible; she could be heard splashing behind
  the canvas curtain.</p>

  <p>Ambrose St. Malo had just returned from peeping through a small hole in
  the canvas. The floor near the canvas was moist. He had left wet foot tracks.
  He was in the act of sitting down opposite the phony lama when Andrew's head
  appeared above floor level. Elsa's kit-bag had disappeared behind the
  curtain. She was no doubt using it. But Andrew's brief-case was also
  missing.</p>

  <p>It was two or three seconds before he noticed it, beside St. Malo, in the
  shadow just beyond the edge of a pool of light on the floor. He had hardly
  dared to hope that such an old campaigner as St. Malo would fall for that
  trick. The brief-case was open. St. Malo had sat down in a hurry and had not
  had time to put it back where Andrew left it.</p>

  <p>Of course, after that any fool could have foretold what was going to
  happen, except for the working details, which were sure to be interesting.
  Tom and Andrew sat down facing each other, so that they were at four points
  of a square. After a few seconds' silence, during which Andrew's eyes led
  Tom's toward the brief-case, Tom said to the phony lama:</p>

  <p>"Of course, now I know exactly who Tour Eminence is. You must be the
  worshipful member of the sacred Council of Regents in Lhasa. Your Eminence
  surely is he who loyally tried to protect the sacred infant Dalai Lama."</p>

  <p>Andrew wasn't watching the phony lama. That was Tom's job. He watched St.
  Malo, whose face was a picture. Tom's opening gambit plainly had him puzzled.
  He didn't realize yet that Tom was wise to him. Tom continued talking to the
  phony lama, using beautiful Tibetan. It was so good that the phony lama had
  to work hard to understand him and not betray his own ignorance of the higher
  learning:</p>

  <p>"Of course, I am an ignorant foreigner," said Tom, "so I speak subject to
  correction. But as I understand it, the holy Dalai Lama died several years
  ago in Lhasa. He was the ablest and most enlightened ruler that Tibet ever
  had. Therefore he was poisoned, to make way for unenlightened, evil
  politicians."</p>

  <p>Tom was using facts like sledge-hammers, preparing the ground. St. Malo
  realized that. He was growing restless, trying to make sure that the piece of
  paper he had sat on in a hurry wasn't sticking out where Andrew or Tom Grayne
  could notice it.</p>

  <p>Tom continued: "And as I, in my benighted ignorance, understand it,
  although the holy Dalai Lama dies like any other mortal, he immediately
  reincarnates into the body of a newborn child. That child has to be sought
  for&mdash;somewhere, anywhere, in Tibet, and is recognizable by certain
  marks. Such a child was found, identified and acclaimed. The child was
  brought to Lhasa and installed in his sacred office to be educated under the
  supervision of the Council of Regents."</p>

  <p>At last the phony lama answered him. He might have done better to keep
  silent but he was too stupid: "As a foreigner your knowing too much. What
  your doing in Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"Learning," Tom answered. "I have learned that many foreigners, from many
  lands, have designs on Tibet."</p>

  <p>The phony lama assented: "All foreigners being devils," he remarked.
  "Having heard of this blessed land, now their wanting it." Then he added
  sententiously: "But my wishing to reach Shig-po-ling monastery. Thus your
  acquiring merit."</p>

  <p>Tom nodded gravely: "Meaning that if we can serve Your Eminence in some
  important way, we may depend upon Your Eminence's favor?"</p>

  <p>The phony lama nodded. Tom went on talking:</p>

  <p>"It is rumored, so that even my ignorant ears have heard it, that one, and
  only one member of the Council of Regents has been faithful to his sacred
  trust. Are you that member?"</p>

  <p>There was a pause. St. Malo held his breath. He seemed scared stiff that
  the fool might make a bad break. But the phony lama didn't speak. Tom went
  on:</p>

  <p>"I have heard that all the other members of the Council of Regents in
  Lhasa have been corrupted by the money and by the promises of the secret
  agents of foreign governments. I have heard they are wicked men. I have heard
  they quarrel among themselves for the control of the sacred child, each of
  them perceiving that the sole control would give him autocratic power, which
  would enable him to grow enormously rich from the bribes of foreign
  governments, each of whom craves to control the education of the coming ruler
  of Tibet."</p>

  <p>"My having told you," said the phony lama, "your knowing too much."</p>

  <p>Tom continued: "So there was strife between the Regents. That Regent who
  is also abbot of the Shig-po-ling monastery over yonder, proved to be the
  cleverest, if not the most powerful. He poisoned some of the other Regents.
  Others he slew. He drove the only faithful Regent out of Lhasa, so that he
  barely escaped with his life. And he carried away the child lama to the
  Shig-po-ling monastery, so as to have the child in his power."</p>

  <p>The phony lama glanced at St. Malo, paused a moment and then answered:</p>

  <p>"All this being not your business."</p>

  <p>"But destiny," said Tom, "which is inscrutable, has guided me into the
  sacred presence of that only faithful Regent. You are he. Are you not?"</p>

  <p>The phony lama began to be careful, too late. He searched his mind for
  important-sounding words and bungled them:</p>

  <p>"My being nobly born seeing fit to travel wrapped in cloak of anonymity,
  ignorant foreign devils should not ask improper questions."</p>

  <p>Tom persisted patiently: "But I have information for the wise ears of His
  Holy and Worshipful Eminence, the nobly born Ringding Gelong Lama Lobsang
  Pun. I must not breathe my information into the wrong ears. It is too
  important. Are you not Lobsang Pun?"</p>

  <p>St. Malo chucked in his hand. He said nothing, but it was as plain as
  writing on a wall that there and then he abandoned the phony lama to his
  fate. He had seen what Andrew saw.</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-Face had timed it perfectly. He must have crept like a cat up
  that difficult ramp, and he must have been crouching near the top of the
  entrance into the upper cavern, awaiting his cue. Now he stood up and coughed
  like a senator about to deliver a speech. But he didn't say anything. He
  thumbed his beads, flicking them ten to a second. No one could possibly pray
  that fast. It was a grand moment.</p>

  <p>"Are you not His Holy Eminence Lobsang Pun?" Tom repeated. "Member of the
  Council of Regents and the only loyal servant of the sacred child, the Dalai
  Lama?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am," said the phony lama. There was nothing else that he could
  say.</p>

  <p>"Then why," Tom asked him, "are you on your way to the Shig-po-ling
  monastery, where the wicked Regent Ram-pa Yap-shi, who expelled you from
  Lhasa and did his utmost to get you killed, has wrongfully taken the sacred
  child and is ready to fight all comers?</p>

  <p>"Answer me that."</p>

  <p>Everyone but Tom breathed hard through his nose. Barring that, there was
  silence for about thirty seconds. Then Ugly-face belched like a gun going
  off. East of, say, Vienna, belching is good manners. A diplomat may politely
  include the accomplishment in his code of signals. Ugly-face was calling for
  the show-down.</p>

  <p>Tom opened fire: "Since nine days ago, eighteen armed men from Sinkiang
  have waited in a cave near here. Are they your men?"</p>

  <p>The phony lama tried to ignore the question, but Tom waited for an answer.
  Andrew, watching St. Malo, saw a sly, overconfident smile vaguely flicker on
  his lips and at the corners of his eyes. To him those eighteen men from
  Sinkiang were evidently good news. He was in a hurry now to see the phony
  lama disposed of and out of the way, so that he might play his own hand. But
  he knew Andrew was watching him, so he kept still.</p>

  <p>The phony lama didn't know how to answer Tom's question. Tom did it for
  him:</p>

  <p>"They are not your men. You never heard of them until this moment."
  Suddenly he turned toward Old Ugly-face. "But who is this, whom you treat
  harshly?"</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face said nothing.</p>

  <p>The phony lama answered: "That one being my servant."</p>

  <p>Tom smiled. St. Malo almost laughed.</p>

  <p>"I am in duty bound," said Tom, "to tell Your Eminence the secret
  information that has come to my ignorant ears. You will know what it means.
  This is it: the Regent Ram-pa Yap-shi, who is the abbot of the Shig-po-ling
  monastery&mdash;he who carried off the infant Dalai Lama&mdash;has offered an
  enormous reward for the person of His Holy Eminence Lobsang Pun, to be
  delivered alive, having been reported dead too many times. This time His
  Eminence's death is to be witnessed and to be enjoyed by all except His
  Eminence. Had you heard of it?"</p>

  <p>Silence. The phony lama had only one chance left now; but the long knife
  was hardly out of his bosom before Tom had him by the wrist. Tom passed the
  knife to Andrew and went on talking:</p>

  <p>"Someone with more brains than you have, showed you how to make a fortune
  by betraying your master, His Holy Eminence Lobsang Pun, to be put to the
  torture and slain. So you pretended to your master you would save his life by
  changing places with him. He was to seem to be the servant you were to seem
  to be the master. To which, being in danger of death, he agreed. But who was
  the man of brains and treachery who bargained with you for a share of the
  reward for the betrayal of your master? Did he show you an American flag? Did
  he tell you tales about protection to be had in an American Legation&mdash;
  was it in China? Did he mention China? Were you to escape to China with the
  money?"</p>

  <p>St. Malo sat motionless, except that his eyes moved. They measured the
  distance to the lama's long knife that Tom had passed to Andrew. It lay on
  the floor. Andrew moved it.</p>

  <p>"Such men," Tom continued, "always demand a lion's share. Not a half-
  share. A lion's share. That same someone sent loads, on fourteen yaks, with
  eighteen men from Sinkiang, to await him in a cave near here. What, do you
  think, would have happened to you&mdash;at the hands of the men from
  Sinkiang?"</p>

  <p>No answer. St. Malo saw the writing on the wall. He moved his right hand.
  But Andrew noticed it; so St. Malo let his hand fall and lie limp on his
  thigh. Andrew leaned toward him, shoved him off balance, plunged his hand
  into the opening of his overcoat, drew blank and pulled him upright again. He
  loved Andrew for that. His eyes were like hot flint. Old Ugly-face sat down
  against the wall and belched again. He wanted action. But Tom was in no
  hurry. He was having a swell time. He continued:</p>

  <p>"What's going to happen to you now, you treacherous scullion? Your real
  name is Shag-la. You're masquerading as a nobly born, eminent lama. There is
  a penalty of death for that crime. You're found out."</p>

  <p>The phony lama mumbled something, probably a spell for breaking bad luck.
  Old Ugly-face walked toward him. He had dignity. Nobody needed to tell him
  how to behave. He didn't speak. The vigor of his iron will, and the humor of
  his humility, were enough. Already he seemed almost to have forgotten the cur
  who had insulted and ill-treated him on that cruel march. He was thumbing his
  beads like lightning; the eye could hardly follow their flick on the
  thong.</p>

  <p>The phony lama knelt to him, put out his tongue and laid his forehead on
  the floor. Ugly-face ignored him. He sat down on Andrew's bed roll, and the
  phony lama crawled away to the wall where he lay face downward. Ugly-face
  stared for a moment at Tom and then fetched up another laugh from his
  stomach:</p>

  <p>"Oo-hah-ha-ha-ha-ha-hah!" Then he looked straight at Andrew&mdash;saw slap
  through him to his backbone, the way he did when they first met. He glanced
  at Tom and said in English: "Tum-Glain, your choosing not bad: Where's
  Elsa?"</p>

  <p>Elsa came out from behind the curtain carrying her kit-bag. She set it
  down and stood waiting, limned by the light from the crack in the wall. She
  had made herself look beautiful. But for whose sake? She watched St. Malo,
  and he stared at her as if he was either afraid or else stunned by a new
  idea. Tom signed to Elsa and she came and sat down at his right hand, facing
  Andrew. St. Malo groped in his pocket, found a little silver box, opened it
  and swallowed two opium pills. Almost at once his smile of self-assurance
  returned, as if he had resumed the reins of destiny and knew a short way to
  his goal. Now he looked dangerous.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch49"
     id="ch49">CHAPTER 49</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The light had changed; the sun had moved across the gap in
  the cavern wall. They faced one another in a sort of mystic twilight, in
  which the rough walls were almost invisible. The easiest face to see was St.
  Malo's because he faced the light. It was a fascinating face&mdash;decadent,
  willful, incorruptible by any moral considerations. To that extent it had
  integrity. He hadn't shaved for a long time but his beard was as sparse as a
  Tibetan's. He had high cheekbones, a dark skin and refined-looking rather
  Mongoloid features. Now that the opium had begun to work on him even his
  vicious mouth recovered a kind of charm. His gesture, as if picking up a band
  of cards and holding them to his breast, looked natural, unconsidered; but it
  aroused Andrew's interest; he suspected a weapon; his muscles tightened a
  bit; he was ready.</p>

  <p>St. Malo opened, and drew one card&mdash;from underneath him. He had been
  sitting on it. He flourished a sheet of rather crumpled paper that he had
  taken from Andrew's brief-case, crunched it up and tossed it into Andrew's
  lap.</p>

  <p>"That's the lowdown on you," he remarked. "That's a list of the names of
  Moscow secret agents between Delhi and Lhasa. You're on the Moscow
  payroll."</p>

  <p>Andrew answered: "You took that bait like a rat. How did you come by your
  rep? I'd heard you were an ace."</p>

  <p>"So I am," said St. Malo. "So is Tom Grayne. So are you said to be. You
  must be damned well organized to have kept such a check on my movements. You
  two seem to know nearly as much about me as I know about you. Let's say we're
  three of a kind and play it that way. Why are we here in Tibet?"</p>

  <p>Tom retorted: "One reason is to prevent you from using the United States
  flag."</p>

  <p>St. Malo stared. He had begun to feel out of his depth. Tom made a gesture
  to Andrew. Andrew put his arm around St. Malo, pulled him off balance and
  groped again inside his overcoat. This time, since he didn't search for
  weapons, he found what he was after. He pulled out a silk Stars and Stripes
  about three feet by two and threw it toward Tom; but it came unrolled,
  fluttered and fell in Ugly-face's lap. Ugly-face examined it with an
  expression that might have meant amusement, or curiosity, or guile. He folded
  it carefully and tucked it away in his bosom. St. Malo grinned at Tom:</p>

  <p>"How did you know about that?" He glanced at Elsa, and from her to Lobsang
  Pun, and back again. "Bulah Singh," he said, "believed that she's
  clairvoyant." He stared again at Old Ugly-face, who filled the next few
  seconds with a silence of his own that felt like ponderable force.</p>

  <p>Then St. Malo said suddenly: "Take that flag away from him if you value
  your lives! He doesn't know the meaning of fair play. He'll treat you as he
  treated me. He'll accept your help and then lead you into a trap. He'll use
  that flag against you, somehow."</p>

  <p>No one made any comment, although he waited for it. So after a
  considerable pause he said: "Oh well, all right. Let's talk turkey. I've
  eighteen men. How many have you?"</p>

  <p>"All the men I need," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>"Mine are well armed."</p>

  <p>"What for? What against?" Tom asked him.</p>

  <p>St. Malo stared at Ugly-face. "Lobsang Pun," he said, "knows English."</p>

  <p>"So do we all," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"Oh! So you're one of those mystical buggers, are you! Amateur yogi!
  Sandwiching a word at a time between two silences to make it sound like
  wisdom! Here's a fact for you to stick between two noises. My eighteen men
  are on their way here&mdash;eighteen rifles."</p>

  <p>"No, they're not," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"Guess again! You'd better come to terms with me before they get here,"
  St. Malo retorted. "If we agree, well and good. I'll go you fifty-fifty in
  that case. But if I dictate the terms, you'll get the lean end. Make no
  mistake about that."</p>

  <p>Tom looked bored. He answered: "Your phony friend Shag-la obeyed your
  signal. He crawled away just now to bring your men. But he didn't get far."
  He whistled. Bompo Tsering pitched Shag-la into the cavern. He was an
  astonishing apparition, as if he had been flung between the darkened flies on
  to a dimly lighted stage. He rolled into the pool of light and lay still,
  looking dead, but after a moment or two he recovered and crawled to the
  wall.</p>

  <p>Elsa spoke at last: "Isn't he hurt? Shouldn't someone go and look? Hadn't
  I better?"</p>

  <p>Tom answered: "No. Sit still."</p>

  <p>St. Malo sneered: "Too bad he didn't break his bloody neck. We'll have to
  shoot him soon. Why not now?"</p>

  <p>Tom returned to the previous issue: "The point is, your eighteen men
  aren't coming. Now what?"</p>

  <p>St. Malo didn't appear embarrassed. "All right," he retorted. "You win
  that trick. But what does it get you? I hold all the rest. You've got to come
  to terms with me. Lobsang Pun, too, since you seem to be dealing him in. This
  man Gunning is your yes-man, I suppose. Well, all right. I've eighteen armed
  men, in addition to the men below here who came with us. If you should lay a
  finger on me, they'd wipe you out. So let's be sensible. The Dalai Lama brat
  is in the Shig-po-ling monastery. We take your men and mine and go get him.
  We'll use Lobsang Pun as bait. He'll have to chip in and play with us,
  because if they catch him they'll torture him. We split the profit three ways
  &mdash;if Lobsang Pun is on the level. If he isn't, we split it two ways, and
  what happens to him'll be his business."</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face didn't move a muscle or a wrinkle. He didn't blink. Neither
  did Tom. St. Malo continued:</p>

  <p>"After we've bagged the sacred brat will be where the girl friend enters
  in. She'll be foster-mother, dry nurse&mdash;talk to him in Tibetan and keep
  him from crying his eyes out. They grow sick, those infant prodigies, unless
  they're babied. After that there'll be three lines of retreat. Three markets.
  Moscow would pay plenty, but it's a hard trail and we might not get there.
  Then there's Lhasa&mdash;lots of cash in Lhasa, and a gang who'd pay through
  the nose. But they're treacherous. They'd try to kill us before we could
  reach the border. India, of course, 'ud be no good. The God-dams 'ud talk
  morals, and keep us waiting, and finally they'd cheat us and themselves too.
  The best bet, and the safest, and the easiest route, is China. There, the
  Germans have a secret anti-Russian nest of experts. They've plenty of money,
  and they've bought up lots of Chinese. They've a party in Lhasa at this
  moment gunning for what we're after; but they'd want all the profit for
  themselves, so we'll beat them to it and leave 'em howling. We'll deal with
  the head gang in China. They'll see the point of educating the holy child
  with a view to controlling Tibet later on, when the time comes to break with
  the Japs. But don't let's talk about Japan."</p>

  <p>"No," Tom agreed. "We might get sort of overextended."</p>

  <p>St. Malo didn't like sarcasm. He smiled thinly: "Well, there's the set-
  up. Now we know what we're talking about. Your turn."</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face fetched up another abrupt, thunderous laugh. He left off
  thumbing his beads, as if prayer had not inspired him and he knew the answer
  to all riddles:</p>

  <p>"Oo-hah-ha-ha-ha-ha-hah! Tum-Glain! Now what? What your saying?"</p>

  <p>"I say the hell with him," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>"Too many hells," said Ugly-face. "Your knowing all about all of them
  later on. Sinning too much. Thinking too little. Sun-moon-sun-moon-day-week-
  month-year&mdash;all that time, and what your doing?"</p>

  <p>Tom looked straight at St. Malo. "You move first. Get out of here."</p>

  <p>Then St. Malo changed tactics. Perhaps the opium had gone to his head. He
  stood up. He jerked his head at Elsa. He said: "Whose is this woman?"</p>

  <p>It was such a shock that he got away with it. Perhaps he had counted on
  that. At any rate, he noticed the astonishment and took advantage of it,
  springing another surprise before anyone answered.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to speak to her alone."</p>

  <p>Even Old Ugly-face changed expression; his eyes glinted amid the wrinkles.
  He stared at Elsa. Everyone did&mdash;even the discouraged phony lama, who
  was rubbing bruises in the background, and Bompo Tsering, who was lurking in
  the dimness at the head of the ramp that led to the lower cavern.</p>

  <p>"Why alone?" asked Elsa.</p>

  <p>"It's that or nothing," St. Malo answered, looking cocksure. "It's
  something I'll tell you in confidence. I won't tell them on any terms. That's
  why."</p>

  <p>Tom spoke abruptly: "Get the hell out!"</p>

  <p>St. Malo stood still. "Is she yours?" he retorted. "You own her?"</p>

  <p>"Shall I throw him out?" said Andrew. "Say the word."</p>

  <p>"Oh. So she's your woman?"</p>

  <p>Andrew seized him by the edge of his overcoat to give him the bum's rush.
  There came astonishing interruption. Old Ugly-face shouted; he boomed like a
  clamoring gong: he filled the cavern with protest.</p>

  <p>"No violence!" he commanded, in surprisingly good English. "Let go! Stop
  it!"</p>

  <p>Andrew obeyed, stepping back to cut off St. Malo's line of retreat to the
  lower cavern. Then Tom protested:</p>

  <p>"No violence? I saw Your Eminence capture the Thunder Dragon Gate. You
  ordered monks flogged by the dozens."</p>

  <p>"Their being louses!"</p>

  <p>"This man St. Malo is a louse!"</p>

  <p>"Louses having purposes! Also, not being your duty&mdash;your not being
  responsible lama&mdash;your being ignorant man."</p>

  <p>"Are you telling me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My telling you that even louses having purposes!"</p>

  <p>It looked like locked horns and no way out of a quarrel until Elsa spoke
  up:</p>

  <p>"Is there any reason why I shouldn't speak to him alone?"</p>

  <p>"We could keep watch from the head of the ramp," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid of him," Elsa objected. "Besides, I have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted: "Yeah, you keep your automatic out of his reach. Here,
  you'd better give it to me."</p>

  <p>She gave it to him. He passed it to Tom.</p>

  <p>"That's much safer." Andrew picked the knife off the floor and passed it
  to Bompo Tsering. "He could have taken it from you as easily as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tom suddenly interrupted: "What the hell now?" He blinked into the light.
  Old Ugly-face&mdash;His Eminence the Most Reverend Ringding Gelong Lama
  Lobsang Pun&mdash;was climbing the wall! He had passed behind the curtain
  that hid the gurgling water. From there, he was able to reach a fault in the
  rock that formed a climbable zigzag stair curving upward to the irregular
  opening fifty feet above, that let in light. He entered the deep opening,
  glanced once backward over his shoulder like a huge misshapen owl, and
  vanished.</p>

  <p>"Can he get out that way?" Andrew asked.</p>

  <p>"No. But there's room up there for ten men."</p>

  <p>Tom turned to Elsa: "If you see fit to talk to St. Malo&mdash;?" He
  sounded stiff, as if he resented having to ask the question&mdash;perhaps
  doubted his right to ask it.</p>

  <p>"He said he wants to speak to me," Elsa answered. "I think he won't unless
  you leave us alone."</p>

  <p>St. Malo nodded. " You bet I won't."</p>

  <p>Tom's eyes met Andrew's. "We could wait on the ramp," Andrew suggested,
  "just out of earshot."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But out of earshot," said St. Malo.</p>

  <p>Elsa put a word in: "If they say they will, they will."</p>

  <p>"Honey," St. Malo answered, "you're naive. At our trade we would cut each
  other's throats for a secret. Yours, too!"</p>

  <p>"Gunning and I will go halfway down the ramp and wait there," said Tom.
  "Keep your voices low and you can talk without being overheard. We'll give
  you five minutes." He met Andrew's eyes again.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>So Tom continued: "I'm giving you fair warning, St. Malo. Ten seconds
  after you start anything, you'll be shot dead. So don't start anything."</p>

  <p>"Nuts," St. Malo answered. "Do you know what that means?"</p>

  <p>Tom drew his automatic and cocked it. Andrew drove the phony lama and
  Bompo Tsering down the ramp to the lower cavern. Then he and Tom followed,
  halfway. In the dark, on the biggest boulder, that almost choked the short
  steep tunnel, they sat down and waited.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch50"
     id="ch50">CHAPTER 50</a></h2>

  <p class="first">St. Malo came quietly to the head of the ramp and peered
  downward. His head and shoulders were very easy to see in silhouette against
  the light.</p>

  <p>"Hop to it," said Tom Grayne. "You've five minutes."</p>

  <p>Satisfied that Tom and Andrew really were out of earshot, St. Malo
  returned to Elsa. They heard him talking, but they couldn't hear what he
  said. Elsa's voice was even less audible. What made it difficult even to try
  to listen was the tension between Andrew and Tom. They weren't friends the
  way they had been when Andrew started for India with Elsa under his
  protection. Tom said after a moment or two:</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you kill that bastard?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not a killer. You know it. What's your plan?"</p>

  <p>"I had one," said Tom.</p>

  <p>"What was wrong with it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. It's gone fluey. Old Ugly-face won't play. I know the symptoms.
  He has a plan of his own, and his own use for you and me."</p>

  <p>"He hasn't said so."</p>

  <p>"No. Why should he? He'll use us now, just as he made use of St. Malo and
  then you in order to get here."</p>

  <p>"How did you know Old Ugly-face was coming&mdash;and St. Malo too? Your
  regular spies can't have told you."</p>

  <p>Tom Grayne chuckled. "It 'ud make a story for the archives! But they'd
  call me bughouse. It 'ud make a book. But who'd print it? All winter long
  until a week ago, I've had a man here who could turn on mental television to
  beat Jesus."</p>

  <p>"Oh? Who was he?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't say. The name he went by was Hut-sum Samdup. He had me call him
  Sam. He made a sort of stab at teaching me, but he couldn't. Seems I'm
  unteachable&mdash;according to him. He said I'm profit-minded&mdash;f not ph.
  But that was only his excuse. He didn't want to teach. He was using me in
  some way I couldn't get hep to&mdash;using my energy&mdash;tapping it. It was
  almost like a blood-transfusion. It left me weak now and then&mdash; kind of
  light-headed. I'll learn how to do it someday. He could make me see anything
  he saw&mdash;hear whatever he heard. But I can't do it off my own
  bat&mdash;can't begin to do it."</p>

  <p>"Did he give any reason for making you see things?"</p>

  <p>"No. He was long on meditation&mdash;short on talk. I doped out he's a
  member of the Lodge to which Old Ugly-face belongs. I guess Ugly-face is a
  kind of younger brother, maybe earning a higher degree. Sam left here the
  same day we saw you pick up Old Ugly-face's party in the storm and head this
  way."</p>

  <p>"We didn't head this way right off," said Andrew. "We pitched
  bivouac."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I know all that. I knew Elsa was along. And I knew you and she were
  sleeping together."</p>

  <p>"Hold your horses," said Andrew. "Let's get this straight. I don't want to
  have to get tough. We were friends, you and I."</p>

  <p>"We can be so yet," Tom answered. "Elsa told me just now why you brought
  her back here."</p>

  <p>"She asked to be brought."</p>

  <p>"Yes. She said that. She says she came to tell me I'm in the discard
  &mdash;washed up."</p>

  <p>"Did she put it that way? I mean&mdash;I can't see your eyes in the dark.
  Are you lying?"</p>

  <p>"No. But I guess you're half right. Maybe I'm rattled. I was adding one
  thing to another. She did say she came to give me my freedom face to face,
  and she hopes we'll part good friends."</p>

  <p>"Since you're telling it," said Andrew, "what did you say to that?"</p>

  <p>"What do you take me for? What do you suppose I'd say? I told her I
  supposed you're the irresistible prince of lovers. Isn't it true?"</p>

  <p>"You're telling it," said Andrew. "What did she answer?"</p>

  <p>"She denied it. In toto. That's what has me beat. She was never a liar.
  She never had cause to fear telling me the plain truth. She said there's
  nothing between you and her. She said you've never made love to her."</p>

  <p>"That's the plain truth," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Man, listen, will you! I've sat in this cave, with Hut-sum Samdup up
  there on that ledge where Old Ugly-face has stowed himself, and I've seen you
  and Elsa in one bed together."</p>

  <p>"Did you tell that to Elsa?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't. She has feelings. I'm supposed to have none. But is it true
  or false?"</p>

  <p>"It's true."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, I know it's true. I saw it as clearly as a movie."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear us talking?"</p>

  <p>"No. I kind of shut it off. Somehow&mdash;I don't know how. I decided I'd
  shoot you as soon as you'd get here."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Changed my mind. Had time to think. The blow-up's my fault, not hers. We
  never should have married in the first instance. You be good to her, Gunning.
  She's a good girl."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I've been bad to her?"</p>

  <p>"She says not. She says you were kindness itself. I guess that part's
  true."</p>

  <p>"Then see here: the man doesn't live who can foist off a woman on me. I
  haven't as much as kissed her&mdash;though I should have done many a time,
  for the sake of the brave way she faced the journey, and the patience she had
  with my rough manners. What she has told you is the plain truth."</p>

  <p>Tom Grayne was silent a moment. Suddenly he said: "My God, Andrew! Is she
  cutting herself adrift in this wilderness without a man to turn to? I can't
  let her go that way."</p>

  <p>"It's between you and her," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Sure you're telling the truth?"</p>

  <p>"I've said it twice. I won't say it again."</p>

  <p>"Did she tell you, before she left India, that she meant to break with
  me?"</p>

  <p>"More or less."</p>

  <p>"What did you say to it?"</p>

  <p>"I said it was between you and her. Two or three times since, I've thought
  she'd changed her mind. But I didn't ask. It wasn't my business."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you fool, you know damn well you shouldn't have brought her
  here!"</p>

  <p>"Says you. That was my business. I didn't offer. She asked. The decision
  was up to me. I made it. It stands."</p>

  <p>"But, God Almighty, man, what's to be done? She says she won't come back
  to me&mdash;won't even think of it! What can I do with her? We'll have to
  tell off two men that we can't spare to protect her. In the mood she's in now
  she'll be no use&mdash;not even clairvoyant&mdash;she never is when
  she's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted: "Can you see anything now?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Try again. Keep your eyes wide open. Stare."</p>

  <p>"Say, what do you know about seeing things? I thought you were a
  skeptic."</p>

  <p>Andrew growled at him: "Look! Listen! Keep your mouth shut! Stare into the
  dark!"</p>

  <p>There was at first a confusion of attention&mdash;something that wasn't
  quite like far-away sheet lightning. It shimmered from plane to plane of
  consciousness. It was something, but not quite like flashbacks from a partly
  remembered dream, recognizable as experience but not translatable into
  symbols of waking thought.</p>

  <p>"This is it! This is it!" said Tom Grayne.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" Andrew growled. "Don't break it. Quiet!"</p>

  <p>Speech had broken the spell. But it came on again, stronger than ever,
  steadier, less dream-like. Old Ugly-face appeared, faded, came in again
  &mdash;seen through the rock. Except that nothing was reversed, it was like a
  reflection in a still pool; but it wasn't fixed in space; it was the same
  whichever way one looked&mdash;Old Ugly-face, seated like an image of
  Chenrezi, with his legs crossed and his hands on his thighs, palms upward,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>Imperceptibly, and yet quickly, as in a dream, it changed. Old Ugly-face
  was gone, though one knew he was still there. Now one was seeing through him
  &mdash;through his consciousness. In his place were Elsa and St. Malo, on the
  cavern floor, standing, she with her back toward the canvas curtain, both of
  them clearly revealed in rather dim light from the break in the cavern wall.
  In the background beyond them there was a little vapor rising from the warm
  flowing water. The vision was more luminous than the light through the gap.
  The light was subordinate to it. It had its own light. As in certain kinds of
  dreams, one knew it was real and yet unreal, at one and the same time.</p>

  <p>And then voices&mdash;soundless when remembered afterwards&mdash;
  inaudible dream voices that reached inner perception and conveyed their
  meaning without the actual use of words. T here was a baffled sensation now
  &mdash;almost a feeling of guilt, as if it were barbarous ignorance not to be
  able to hear accurately. It was like watching a play in a foreign language,
  reading meaning from the action and from book memory. The meaning was quite
  clear.</p>

  <p>Elsa, under no temptation, but under the tremendous pressure of St. Malo's
  trained will, was resisting hypnotic assault. It was like the pressure
  brought to bear by gangsters upon lonely women to force them to become
  prostitutes&mdash;threats, coaxing, realistic logic, lies, false
  sympathy:</p>

  <p>"Honey, you know you're not so sore at those two big boobs that you'll let
  'em be killed when you can prevent it. They were your friends once. One's
  your husband. The other wasn't so bad while it lasted. Now it's all over and
  they're both through with you, you needn't take it so hard."</p>

  <p>"It is not your business, Mr. St. Malo."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, it is my business. I know how to save those two men. Come now,
  honey. Won't it give you any satisfaction to have saved their lives? And see
  here&mdash;there's a fortune for all of us. Those two intend to boot me out
  of here. You come and join me as soon as it's dark."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"But, honey&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Keep your hands off&mdash;please! Don't touch me. I won't have it."</p>

  <p>"Honey, have you ever heard of love at first sight? Have you ever heard of
  a woman reforming a man by just being what she is&mdash;by being sweet and
  good and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There came an astonishing interruption, in a hard voice, that could not
  possibly be Elsa's. Nor was it Old Ugly-face's voice. It sounded more like
  Andrew's, or Tom Grayne's&mdash;or perhaps both their voices merged in one.
  Yet neither of them spoke:</p>

  <p>"You swine! It's more than eighteen months since you've been with a white
  woman. Just now you were peeping through a hole in the curtain. You've taken
  opium. You're sex-crazy! You're&mdash;"</p>

  <p>St. Malo again: "Come with me, honey. If you do, you'll save your life as
  well as theirs. If you don't, they're as good as dead now&mdash;and you'll be
  mine then anyway. For then I'll have to protect you. So make the best of it
  now. I've eighteen men. You heard Tom Grayne say they're not far off. Use
  your second-sight&mdash;I've a bit of my own&mdash;we'll work together and
  dope out their plan. We'll either force them to make terms with us, or beat
  them to it."</p>

  <p>"I'll go kill him," Tom said suddenly. His voice broke the spell. The
  vision vanished. It was like waking from a bright dream in a dark room.
  Andrew laid his hand on Tom's arm:</p>

  <p>"Take it easy. You're rattled, and who's to blame you. Don't let on what
  you know. This is Old Ugly-face's doing."</p>

  <p>"The damned old bastard," said Tom. "I believe it's he who psychologized
  Elsa."</p>

  <p>"Don't kid yourself," said Andrew. "He hardly spoke to her on the way
  here."</p>

  <p>"Hell. What difference does that make? He's a wizard. He's the only man
  who can save Tibet, or I'd&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Easy," said Andrew, "easy. Let's go back up there and turn St. Malo out
  before it's too dark for him to find his way."</p>

  <p>"I should kill him," Tom answered. "I should. Anyone else would."</p>

  <p>"Nuts," said Andrew. "Did you get that line of Old Ugly-face's about
  'louses having purposes'? I bet that was a hot tip. If you saw and heard just
  now what I did, you'll turn St. Malo loose to strut his stuff. Let's see what
  happens."</p>

  <p>"All right. Have it your way. It sounds like horse sense. I was rattled.
  Let's go do it."</p>

  <p>"We're agreed then?"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"Mum's the word about what we've just seen?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, mum's the word."</p>

  <p>"Okay," said Andrew. "You're the top man around here. You go first. I'll
  be behind you."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch51"
     id="ch51">CHAPTER 51</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Elsa stood wondering what to say-what to do. There were no
  signs of peace or the making of peace. Tom came near enough to St. Malo to
  hit him if necessary. "Time's up," he remarked. "Get moving."</p>

  <p>Andrew looked worried. St. Malo smirked at Elsa. He quoted a scrap from
  his heterogenous mass of what undoubtedly was culture of a sort&mdash;if
  there can be culture without morals:</p>

  <p>"Manners maketh man. Did you ever hear that proverb? It's a good one."
  Then he noticed Tom's fist. "So long, sister. Don't forget now: what we've
  discussed was for your ears and mine! Don't repeat it!"</p>

  <p>He oozed away, like an experienced boxer melting out of range of a
  slugging adversary; but, in his black overcoat like a soutane, he really more
  resembled an elusive monk avoiding treading on an idol's shadow. When he
  reached the head of the ramp he turned and smirked again, this time at Tom
  and Andrew:</p>

  <p>"So long, asses! Auf Wiedersehen! Au revoir!"</p>

  <p>"Take your lama with you, and get the hell out!" Tom answered. Then he
  muttered: "If they are his eighteen men, let's hope they kill him for their
  back pay."</p>

  <p>St. Malo vanished. He made plenty of noise on the way down. Andrew
  volunteered:</p>

  <p>"I'll go down and see he clears out." He started for the ramp. Tom called
  him back:</p>

  <p>"No. Stay here."</p>

  <p>"But the phony lama and his gang are down there and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They're disarmed&mdash;outnumbered. Trust Bompo Tsering."</p>

  <p>"St. Malo is making that noise to warn them. It won't take me long to go
  down there and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No. I want you to listen to this."</p>

  <p>Andrew shrugged his shoulders. He came back and stood facing Elsa. They
  formed a triangle. Elsa didn't flinch from either man's gaze. She didn't seem
  afraid or unwilling to speak. She looked tragic. She wasn't pitying herself;
  she was sorry for Tom. Tom spoke, trying to force his voice to sound
  natural:</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Elsa. Let's hear what St. Malo had to say."</p>

  <p>She shook her head: "It was nothing&mdash;really nothing&mdash;not worth
  repeating. Perhaps he's light-headed. He behaved like one of those French
  nuisances who nudge you on the street."</p>

  <p>"Opium," said Andrew. "Light-headed is right."</p>

  <p>Tom agreed: "Let's call it that, anyhow. See here, Elsa. I'm sorry I was
  mean a while ago. What you said caught me off guard. I guess it hurt, and I
  squealed. I shouldn't have. I've talked with Andrew, and he confirms what you
  said."</p>

  <p>"Do you believe him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I do believe him."</p>

  <p>"Tom, you might have believed me."</p>

  <p>"I know it."</p>

  <p>"It was Andrew&mdash;when I consulted him in Darjeeling, but not until
  then&mdash;who pointed out the unfairness to you&mdash;I think he said the
  indecency&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't," said Andrew. "You must have thought of that word."</p>

  <p>Elsa smiled: "&mdash;the cowardice, then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I never called you a coward."</p>

  <p>"&mdash;of sending a letter to claim my freedom and give you yours. I did
  write such a letter. But I burned it. After that I asked Andrew to take me
  with him. And he agreed."</p>

  <p>"Is that the whole truth?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p>"No. But it's the truth about Andrew's kindness to you and me. No one can
  tell the whole truth to another unless there's true love. You and I don't
  love each other, Tom&mdash;not that way. What happened has been all my
  fault&mdash;not yours&mdash;my fault. I came to say so."</p>

  <p>"Don't let's argue that now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tom, there is nothing to argue. It was my fault. I accept full blame. And
  if it's possible to make amends in any way, I will do it."</p>

  <p>"But, Elsa, be reasonable. See here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tom, is it unreasonable to wish to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Elsa, what about you? What are you going to do with yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I am not thinking about me."</p>

  <p>"Then begin thinking, right now! You might do that out of fairness to me
  &mdash;to say nothing of Andrew."</p>

  <p>"You may forget me," said Andrew. "Leave me out of the picture."</p>

  <p>Elsa smiled, not meeting Andrew's eyes. There was a trace of a catch in
  her voice as she answered: "It is I who should be forgotten, if anyone should
  be. But we haven't been indifferent to one another or intentionally cruel.
  Have we? One can forget unkindness&mdash;kindness never&mdash;not true
  kindness. No, Andrew, I won't even try to forget you."</p>

  <p>Tom ground his teeth. "Oh God! What can you say to a girl when she's in
  this mood."</p>

  <p>"I'm a woman," Elsa answered. "I was a girl when you knew me. Now you
  don't know me. It isn't your fault. Tom, I am sorry with all my heart for any
  anguish I have caused you. The very least I owe you is freedom. It's yours.
  You are no longer responsible for me, or beholden to me, in any way whatever.
  You may divorce me when it suits you."</p>

  <p>"Elsa, listen. Barring Andrew and me, you're a thousand miles from even
  the vaguest kind of protection or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tom, I know you believe that or you wouldn't say it. But you're
  mistaken."</p>

  <p>Tom's eyes hardened. "Protection?" he said. "Whose?"</p>

  <p>Ten words would have resolved that crisis. Elsa knew it . She hadn't
  actually meant to say what she did; words had almost said themselves. But she
  let them stand. She added to them, using truth as a reagent to compel
  suspicion to reveal its motive. She liked herself no better for being more
  clever than she had supposed she could be, but the words were said before she
  could recall them:</p>

  <p>"Surely, Tom, you don't think that unless I knew to whom to turn, I
  would&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His savage gesture silenced her. Rebellion against even the least binding
  marriage's restriction of his freedom to go, do, eat, starve, live, die as he
  pleased&mdash;imprisoned within him and dark-dungeoned into silence during
  lonely months and months by an iron will&mdash;now broke loose. It commanded
  every part of him except his manners. Those, like his will, were of iron; not
  gracious, but toward a woman incorruptible by anger.</p>

  <p>"Very well. Then we're through, you and I. Thank you for my freedom. You
  have yours, too. You may do as you please. I wouldn't have believed it could
  happen this way. But here it is."</p>

  <p>Andrew almost interrupted, but thought better of it. He had caught a
  glimpse of Old Ugly-face peering down from the cleft in the wall, through
  which the light poured dim and watery as the sun sank westward. Elsa said
  nothing. She couldn't speak. Tom continued:</p>

  <p>"Now that's settled&mdash;I mean now you know you're free&mdash;will you
  listen?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Tom. Of course I will listen."</p>

  <p>Tom gathered self-control. It came hard. He forced back anger within him
  until its concentration froze all personal sensation. He became governed by
  one motive, with one objective. First he turned to Andrew:</p>

  <p>"Are you going to stand by?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Sure. That was the agreement. As long as you need me I'll see you
  through."</p>

  <p>"Thanks." Tom faced Elsa again. "This man is simply a friend by
  coincidence. He has nothing to gain from me. He isn't paid for all this. As
  far as I know, he is spending his own money, taking his own risk. But you
  heard him. He stands by."</p>

  <p>Elsa almost broke down. She felt she must say something. Her voice
  trembled:</p>

  <p>"Andrew could never desert a friend. It isn't in him."</p>

  <p>Tom pounced on that. It was the very opening he craved: "I'm asking you to
  take example from Andrew. My job is to save Tibet from anarchy by restoring
  the infant Dalai Lama into the hands of his rightful guardian, His Eminence
  Lobsang Pun. That's a tall order. It means capturing the monastery. It calls
  for intimate cooperation. One false move by any of us, you included, might
  ruin everything. Please think that over."</p>

  <p>He gave her no chance to answer. He turned away and headed for the ramp.
  Andrew started after him, then turned back. Tears were streaming down Elsa's
  face. He didn't know whether she saw him or not. She didn't look at him. Her
  shoulders trembled with lonely misery. At last she yielded to it&mdash;sat
  down on her own bedding roll, and sobbed into her hands. Andrew stared,
  swore, hesitated. Old Ugly-face peered down at him like a gnome&mdash;a
  gargoyle; out from the shadowy mass that was his body one hand became
  visible. It moved with the force of authority, like a policeman's, sideways.
  It commanded Andrew to be gone.</p>

  <p>But he was minded to speak to Elsa. He would have done it, in spite of Old
  Ugly-face. But Tom shouted from below:</p>

  <p>"Hi! Andrew!"</p>

  <p>He ran to the head of the ramp. He heard a roughhouse below&mdash;
  crashing&mdash;thuds&mdash;no shouting&mdash;a deadly, grim noise. He went
  down the ramp like a fireman, heels first. At the bottom it took him a second
  or two to accustom his eyes to the different light. First he saw Bompo
  Tsering, coming into the cavern on the run; he must have gone out to change
  the guard. All the ponies were kicking. One yak had broken its tether and was
  charging all over the place, with three or four men trying to corner it,
  making it wilder. At last he saw Tom&mdash;down&mdash;in a shadow&mdash;
  fighting for life.</p>

  <p>He waded in. It did him good. It was what he needed. The phony lama had
  found another knife somewhere. He was stabbing at Tom. Tom held his wrist,
  but the stabs were getting closer&mdash;ferocious&mdash;two or three a
  second. St. Malo, underneath Tom, clung to him, trying to throttle him. Three
  men of the phony lama's party stood by to prevent interference. Andrew
  tackled them first and they went down like ninepins, one punch to a man,
  left, right, left, rolling in agony. He didn't know until then that they had
  knives. Bompo Tsering gathered up the knives. Andrew kicked the phony lama
  unconscious. He hurled him half across the cavern floor, then stooped to grab
  St. Malo&mdash;too late. Tom seized Andrew's arm to pull himself to his feet.
  He almost pulled Andrew down. St. Malo yelled. Three more Tibetans rushed Tom
  and Andrew. They were sent staggering back toward the ponies, where Bompo
  Tsering's men knelt on them. But St. Malo, as quick as a snake on hands and
  knees, had writhed along the wall-escaped. When Andrew looked for him he was
  standing with his back to the light in the cavern entrance, steadying himself
  against the wall.</p>

  <p>"Kill him! Quick!" said Tom, out of breath, gasping. "The son of a bitch!
  He's got my automatic!"</p>

  <p>"Easy," said Andrew, "easy. No one's dead yet."</p>

  <p>St. Malo smiled. There was nothing even mock-heroic about him. He wasn't
  posing. He was figuring the odds: a gambler.</p>

  <p>"You two&mdash;have fools'-luck," he said, breathing hard. "I can kill one
  of you. So shall we shoot it out, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tom was whispering to Andrew.</p>

  <p>Andrew turned sideways, concealing his right hand. St. Malo aimed at him
  &mdash;squeezed the trigger. He had forgotten the safety catch. He found
  himself looking straight at the muzzle of Andrew's Luger.</p>

  <p>"Drop that automatic!" said Andrew. "Drop it!"</p>

  <p>"Hell! You wouldn't shoot," St. Malo answered. But he tossed the
  automatic. Tom caught it. "Neither would I have shot. I'm no killer. Let's
  not act like children. Let's make one more try to reach agreement."</p>

  <p>He folded his arms, crossed one leg in front of the other and relaxed
  against the wall, watching with amused eyes the Tibetans' efforts to catch
  the hysterical yak.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch52"
     id="ch52">CHAPTER 52</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Perhaps St. Malo had seen a signal and knew where to find
  his eighteen men. Perhaps he didn't. He wasn't saying. Old Ugly-face had come
  neatly halfway down the ramp and was listening in. Andrew knew that because
  St. Malo caught sight of him and Andrew turned his head quickly to see what
  St. Malo was looking at. There was no sign of Elsa. St. Malo's eyes were
  moving in all directions, watching the Tibetans. Shrewdly he seemed to
  suspect they would attack him next, in revenge for his having coaxed them
  into such a fiasco. No one spoke until Bompo Tsering and another man roped
  the yak at last and threw it to keep it quiet. Then St. Malo spoke:</p>

  <p>"Hell. You're mean. You haven't even offered me a drink. I know you've got
  liquor."</p>

  <p>"Stick to opium," Tom answered. "That stuff doesn't mix with liquor."</p>

  <p>"I'm hungry. Any soft grub? Jam? Sardines?"</p>

  <p>Tom nodded. Andrew went and dug out a can of salmon and a can of marmalade
  from one of the loads. He tossed them to St. Malo.</p>

  <p>"Biscuit?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Andrew threw him a small can of ship's biscuit. Now at any rate they
  possessed two scraps of important information. Tom ticked them off:</p>

  <p>"So your eighteen men are on iron rations. But you favor your belly. How
  come you didn't fit out those men with a few luxuries?"</p>

  <p>It might have meant that St. Malo was unfamiliar with the craving for rich
  food, in Tibet, in spring, at an altitude above twelve thousand feet. But it
  might not. He stuck a can into each side pocket and one into the bosom of his
  overcoat.</p>

  <p>"I'll let you know when I need more," he said. "I didn't fit 'em out. It
  was done for me." He sneered. "It's a sure thing, if they started out with
  fancy stores they've eaten 'em en route. I'll have to count on you."</p>

  <p>Then he walked out, not looking backward.</p>

  <p>"The insolent pimp!" said Tom Grayne. "Damn him!"</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed: "But can you shoot a man who turned in his automatic."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't his. It was mine, the damned pickpocket."</p>

  <p>"Well, all right, you've got it. Will you shoot him?"</p>

  <p>Where the long, irregular cleft in the cliff met the ledge that skirted
  the ravine, St. Malo stopped, outlined against the setting sun, and spoke to
  the lookout man. Then he turned to the right along the ledge and vanished
  around the bend. Andrew went and questioned the lookout:</p>

  <p>"What did he say to you?"</p>

  <p>"His saying, him being my friend&mdash;when trouble coming by&mdash;um
  &mdash;by, my looking to him."</p>

  <p>"What did you answer?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>That wasn't true. Andrew had seen the man's lips move. Clearly St. Malo
  was a master of the dubious art which differentiates the spy from the mere
  informer. He could spot a simpleton a mile off and get his confidence in
  sixty seconds. Andrew returned to report to Tom, who was already delivering
  judgment on the men who had attacked him.</p>

  <p>"Hard labor," Tom pronounced, "without rations. No tea until tomorrow.
  Carry rocks and barricade the ledge. Now. Get busy."</p>

  <p>For a Tibetan, no tea is punishment. They would rather have been flogged.
  But they were glad not to be executed. So they stuck out their tongues in
  token of meek submission and went to work without protest. Tom went out to
  show them how to fortify the place, and Andrew sent Bompo Tsering with
  another man to boil tea without fuel. It was simple enough; outside the
  cavern, well protected from wind and view by the stone barricade that the
  punishment squad was now enlarging, was a pot-hole full of boiling water from
  the hot spring. One only had to lower the urn into that. It would boil
  anything. Baking, against the rock wall near the pot-hole, was just possible.
  One could warm up meat and make it palatable, or parch barley against it. It
  almost entirely solved the fuel problem.</p>

  <p>When Tom came in, Old Ugly-face had returned to the upper cavern, so
  Andrew asked for information. He knew how simple it was to get Tom's mind
  into its own orbit, where nothing except the main objective&mdash;not even
  pain or misery&mdash;had much importance.</p>

  <p>"Are the monks of the Shig-po-ling monastery armed?"</p>

  <p>"You bet. Five hundred new Jap rifles and lots of old ones. No training,
  of course&mdash;or not much. But Abbot Ram-pa Yap-shi has a gangster's brains
  and he has 'em bulldozed. He's a money buzzard. Buys things. Buys people.
  Double-crosses. Uses poison. He has never been beaten yet, so he lacks
  experience. I think he'll take the full count if he gets a sudden upset."</p>

  <p>"Yeah. But can we do it?"</p>

  <p>"Suddenness 'ud do it. He has the infant Dalai Lama under close guard, in
  an apartment at the rear of the monastery. The kid's pining for fresh air and
  exercise. There's an inner guard of picked men, unarmed for fear they might
  get fancy notions of their own. Only the outer guard have weapons. Ram-pa
  Yap-shi has been dickering, all winter long, between the Tibetan agents of
  Japan and Russia. Now he's heard of the Germans. So he shot both sets of
  agents. He calculates that Moscow'll be pleased because he shot the Jap
  agents; Tokyo should feel the same way about his having shot the Soviet
  contingent."</p>

  <p>"What's his background?" Andrew wondered. "Is he a lama? Educated? Does he
  know his black book?"</p>

  <p>"He's a political priest. He was what's called a lay chela. That's to say
  he took holy orders more or less by proxy. No more education than a Hitler or
  a Stalin. But good family. His name, Ram-pa Yap-shi, indicates descent from
  two lines of the ancient nobility. He has no more claim to the title of abbot
  than Henry the Eighth had a right to be pope. He gets away with it by bribery
  and force and by poisoning his critics. The monastery monks are scared stiff
  of him."</p>

  <p>Andrew demurred: "If Ram-pa Yap-shi has been in that monastery all winter,
  how did he boot Old Ugly-face out of Lhasa?"</p>

  <p>"Bribery," Tom answered. "Ram-pa Yap-shi has the money. He got away with
  all the cash in the treasury at Lhasa."</p>

  <p>"Then what more does he want? If he has the young Dalai Lama, and money,
  he owns Tibet."</p>

  <p>"He's like all usurpers," said Tom. "He has to keep on going. There's no
  safety in standing still. He has no genuine dictator's guts, so he intends to
  sell out to the highest bidder. But the higher they bid, the more he wants.
  That's another familiar symptom&mdash;greedy. And on top of that he's nervous
  as long as he knows Old Ugly-face still lives. He knows Old Ugly-face would
  chuck away his own hope of eternity if he could save Tibet. Ram-pa Yap-shi is
  a crook who'd sell Tibet to save his hide; but he's top dog for the time
  being."</p>

  <p>"And we?"</p>

  <p>"We've a tough job. It isn't finished until the kid's in safe hands."</p>

  <p>"Meaning Ugly-face's hands."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>They sat down side by side at the foot of the ramp and watched two of the
  Tibetans butcher a sheep for supper. Tom had ordered it for two reasons: the
  sheep was sick; and the smell of the cooking meat would sharpen the
  punishment of the men at hard labor. The phony lama had been shamming for
  quite a while. A minute after Andrew kicked him unconscious he had been alert
  enough to roll out of the way of the mad yak. Now he sat up, sniffed the
  butchered sheep and stared around him. Tom ordered him out to the labor gang,
  but he didn't obey until Andrew got up suddenly and started for him. Then he
  ran.</p>

  <p>Andrew turned around and faced Tom. He wanted to glance up the ramp toward
  the upper cavern without Tom's knowing it. There was no one on the ramp. If
  he could keep Tom's mind off Elsa for another ten or fifteen minutes, Tom's
  natural resilience&mdash;his power to absorb punishment&mdash;his
  disciplined, stoical courage would come to his aid. Concentration of purpose
  would exclude even the sense of personal humiliation. That was something that
  Andrew knew about, having tried it for himself when all else failed. So he
  invented questions, just to occupy Tom's thought.</p>

  <p>"See here. I don't get this. Old Ugly-face is a badly beaten man&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>"Beaten, hell!" Tom interrupted.</p>

  <p>"We're all the friends he's got," said Andrew. "He needs us. He'll have to
  chip in."</p>

  <p>Tom raised his head from between his hands and laid a clenched fist on his
  knee.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he answered. And when Andrew sat beside him, he laid the first
  on Andrew's knee. "Get this! Old Ugly-face isn't beaten. It can't be done.
  There's no way of beating him. He's a genuine mystic, and they're the most
  practical people in the world, because they know what they're doing, and why.
  Any man can be beaten who has personal ambition, and who believes that death
  is the end of the road. But Old Ugly-face isn't that kind. He doesn't believe
  &mdash;he's a knower. What he doesn't know, he doesn't bet on. He doesn't
  care a whoop in hell whether you or I understand him or not. That's our
  lookout. When he says he has lived thousands of lives in the world, getting a
  little wiser each time, gradually earning evolution in the sweat of his brow,
  he isn't guessing. He claims he knows it and can prove it. When he says he'll
  go on incarnating, life after life, until at last he doesn't have to any
  longer, because he'll have learned all that the world can teach him, who's
  going to contradict him? You? The pope? Einstein? The Archbishop of
  Canterbury? Freud? Bishop Manning? Fosdick? Have you discussed it with him?
  Death means nothing more to him than passing through a door from one
  experience to another. Riches are nothing. Even power is nothing, except as a
  duty. His duty is to Tibet. How can you beat that man?"</p>

  <p>"He must have a soft spot somewhere," Andrew suggested.</p>

  <p>"All right, you find it," Tom answered. "By the time Lobsang Pun was
  twenty-five he had spent seven years, naked, winter and summer, immured in a
  cave, not far from here, fed once a week on raw barley, through a hole in a
  wall. That's where he learned how to think and to control himself. By the
  time he was thirty-five, he was the Dalai Lama's diplomatic representative in
  China and Japan, and he had tasted every luxury the world can offer. Barring
  liquor, which he once told me he has never touched, he has sampled everything
  and watched its effects on other people. He has control of all his appetites.
  He can take things or leave them. For choice he leaves 'em."</p>

  <p>"He has a heart," Andrew suggested.</p>

  <p>"You bet he has. For Tibet and the Tibetans. Listen to this: I'm his
  friend. He knows that, and he knows why. I t's because I recognize his
  integrity. A few years back, when he was in power, he chased me out of Tibet
  just ahead of the first snowfall. If the snow had caught me, I was done
  for."</p>

  <p>"Sounds friendly."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it? He put a thousand monks to work, praying I'd get through,
  just to give me the edge. He figured that if I hadn't been too sinful, and if
  my destiny entitled me to it, I'd get through in spite of the weather."</p>

  <p>"On the floodtide of the monks' prayers?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I guess so. He figures prayer can't help the wrong man; and it can't
  help the right man to do the wrong thing. Anyhow, I got through, no worse off
  for being prayed for. He'll pray for us now. He'll bless every thought we
  think, to make us useful to him and Tibet. But the minute he's through using
  us, he'll want to boot us out of Tibet or I'm a bad guesser."</p>

  <p>Andrew demurred for the sake of talking: "You mean, if you and I pull off
  a miracle, ditch Ram-pa Yap-shi and put Old Ugly-face on top, he'll turn on
  us?"</p>

  <p>"Hell, no. He's not treacherous. But why are we here? To get reliable
  information. If Old Ugly-face wins out, then we'll have what we came for.
  He'll owe us nothing. But I don't intend to-be booted out of Tibet. I'll send
  you back to India with the news. I'm staying on. When the kid's in safe
  hands, I'm going to get clairvoyant&mdash;I'm going to learn to see&mdash;
  hear&mdash;think the way Old Ugly-face does&mdash;if it kills me.</p>

  <p>"I've been told," said Andrew, "that the first few lifetimes are the
  hardest&mdash;the first two or three hundred years."</p>

  <p>Tom got up. He looked down at him. Suddenly he used an unexpected phrase.
  Andrew had never heard him quote the Bible before:</p>

  <p>"'Ask and it shall be given unto you.' I'll make Old Ugly-face do the
  teaching. Because of my importunity he shall!"</p>

  <p>He walked out then to see how the barricade was coming along. Andrew sat
  still, pondering, until presently he heard Elsa at the head of the ramp.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Andrew?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'll bring up some supper."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, please&mdash;just sardines and tomato juice and biscuit."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't Old Ugly-face want a square meal?"</p>

  <p>"No. He says not. He has barley. He prefers it. Quick, Andrew. I want to
  talk to you before Tom gets back."</p>

  <p>He wondered how she knew that Tom had left the cavern. Strange that she
  should know that and yet not have known there was a fight; neither she nor
  Old Ugly-face had as much as stirred while the fight lasted. He could hear
  Tom, outside, cussing and showing the Tibetans how to build the barricade;
  there was no need for haste on Tom's account. He chose Elsa's supper with
  slow deliberation, adding odds and ends to make it palatable. He knew what
  she liked. He had a good meal for three by the time he started up the ramp
  &mdash;fruit juice and some honey and tinned cake&mdash;all sorts of
  things.</p>

  <p>Elsa had lighted a lantern. It was getting near sunset; almost no light
  came through the gap in the wall. Elsa looked wan, but tense, excited. She
  sat down on one of the bedding rolls and spread another as a makeshift table
  for the food, avoiding Andrew's eyes.</p>

  <p>Andrew asked: "Where's Old Ugly-face?"</p>

  <p>She glanced up at the gap in the wall.</p>

  <p>"Climbed back there, did he?"</p>

  <p>"No. He has been there all the time."</p>

  <p>"I guess you weren't looking. I saw him just now, part way down the ramp.
  He was listening in."</p>

  <p>"But please, Andrew, I know where he was."</p>

  <p>"He was on the ramp. I saw him. He was trying to hear what Tom and I were
  talking about."</p>

  <p>"But, Andrew, I was up there with him. He called me up there as soon as
  you went away. I have been there all the time. I have only just come
  down."</p>

  <p>"Beats me," said Andrew. "Elsa, I saw him&mdash;looked right at him. He
  saw me."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I think&mdash;perhaps you don't understand."</p>

  <p>"You bet I don't. Are you telling the truth?"</p>

  <p>"You too?" she asked. She bit her lip. She met his eyes for a second. "Oh
  &mdash;oh well, let's not talk about it."</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he said. "I'm ashamed. I shouldn't have said that. I guess I'm
  worked up. Of course you told the truth. But so did I. I saw him."</p>

  <p>He opened a can, then another, stabbing them savagely with his knife,
  slicing off the tops by the sheer strength of sculptor's fingers.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Andrew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What? What is it? Shoot!"</p>

  <p>She sighed, then pulled herself together and spoke to the cavern at large,
  as if giving evidence that she didn't expect to be believed:</p>

  <p>"When Lobsang Pun wishes to see&mdash;or to hear; and when he knows and
  loves those whom he wishes to hear and see&mdash;then&mdash;because they also
  know him&mdash;sometimes&mdash;the great effort of will projects his image
  into their imaginations."</p>

  <p>"But Tom didn't see him."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Lobsang Pun was thinking more strongly of you. Or you of
  him."</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed grimly: "Loves me, does he! 'Whom the Lord loveth he
  chasteneth!' Is that his motto? Tom believes he'll give us the air when he's
  through with us&mdash;boot us all three out of Tibet."</p>

  <p>Elsa looked startled&mdash;excited. "Did Tom say he will leave Tibet?"</p>

  <p>"No, he didn't say that&mdash;not to me."</p>

  <p>"But do you think he will leave Tibet? Did anything he said give you that
  impression?"</p>

  <p>"Easy," said Andrew, "easy. I don't ever ask that kind of question. So
  I've the right not to answer 'em."</p>

  <p>He was sorry he said it. It sounded priggish. He loathed prigs. So did
  Elsa. They sat silent a moment or two, listening to Tom returning into the
  lower cavern, marshaling the punishment gang. They could hear his voice, not
  his words; it was easy to guess he was ordering the culprits supperless to
  bed, in the corner beyond the ponies.</p>

  <p>"Discipline," said Andrew. "If he went back on his word and gave 'em a
  bite to eat tonight, they'd think that weakness. He'd have it all to do over
  again."</p>

  <p>They heard Bompo Tsering and two or three men rigging a tent over the
  entrance to keep out wind and make the place snug for the night.</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I have let the time slip by. Now Tom may come up here, and
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't think he will," said Andrew, "unless you ask him. He's more
  likely to go to his own hide-out."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, will you take a message to him?"</p>

  <p>"From you? Can't you tell him yourself?"</p>

  <p>"It's from Lobsang Pun."</p>

  <p>"Well, all right. Can't Old Ugly-face talk? What's wrong with him all at
  once? He knows Tom 'ud go the limit for him, now or any time.&mdash;Say, eat
  or you'll be starving. Be a good girl&mdash;drink up that tomato juice."</p>

  <p>She obeyed, then laughed: "Andrew, I have grown so used to obeying you
  that I must guard against the habit!"</p>

  <p>"Now sardines on biscuit. Wash 'em down with champagne. Go on, that's the
  last half bottle."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, we had six half bottles. What became of the others?"</p>

  <p>"Bulah Singh and St. Malo stole 'em."</p>

  <p>"You knew it."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I pretended not to. The poor devils needed something to keep their
  hackles rising. You said you've a message for Tom. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Lobsang Pun wants you to deliver it, because Tom will listen to you. He
  says it was wise to let St. Malo go. But it isn't wise to give him too much
  time, because he'll waste it."</p>

  <p>"So Ugly-face wants action?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He said this:'Devils are not angels. If you buy a devil, he is all
  the more a devil, having added one more sin to make him worse; and the higher
  the price you pay, the more certainly he will betray you.'"</p>

  <p>"Who'd choose to buy St. Malo?" Andrew wondered. "Governments, yes.
  They're all crazy. But who else?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Lobsang Pun told me to say that."</p>

  <p>"To me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, to you&mdash;to repeat to Tom. Then he said this: 'Devils know how
  to be devilish, so make them do it quickly. By betraying, they create an
  opportunity.' And after that he added: 'If a plan has a flaw, turn it inside
  out, or change it, but don't abandon it unless it's wicked.' He wants you to
  say that to Tom."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;all right. Tom's the head man. I'll go down and tell him. But
  I won't say it's my opinion. I'll just make a report."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, won't you eat something?"</p>

  <p>"Not now. Later. Say: is there nothing that you'd like to say to Tom?"</p>

  <p>She paused a second. "No, Andrew." Suddenly she put her hands to her face
  &mdash;spoke through them. "What could I say? Tom doesn't love me&mdash; you
  know he doesn't! You heard him, Andrew. Tom loves his career&mdash;his
  solitude&mdash;his&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted: "Do you love him?"</p>

  <p>"My God! Is that a fair question? Now? No, I won't answer!" Then suddenly:
  "Andrew! Do you know what Tom believes?"</p>

  <p>"Better not say it. I'm Tom's friend."</p>

  <p>"He believes I've fallen for St. Malo! He does believe it! I know he does!
  He thinks I'm so wicked and loose and vile that I'd run off with St. Malo
  just for&mdash;just for&mdash;oh, I don't know why he thinks he thinks
  that!"</p>

  <p>"What makes you think he thinks that?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I read it! I read his thought! Can you love anyone, and think
  that kind of thought about them?&mdash;If he had killed the thought&mdash;
  thrown it out&mdash;stamped on it! But he didn't. He didn't try. He let it
  bore in like a worm into his mind.&mdash;Oh, Andrew, Andrew, why was I ever
  born?"</p>

  <p>He tried to comfort her, but he didn't know what to say. He put his arm
  around her. She buried her face against his breast and cried, struggling to
  control herself, sobbing, choking. At last:</p>

  <p>"Oh Andrew, I can't help it! There&mdash;I won't do it again." She sat
  upright. "I'm all right now: Andrew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Has Tom said anything&mdash;about me?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word. I don't think he will. He's as proud as hell."</p>

  <p>"Do you&mdash;do you suppose he'll ask you what I'm going to do?"</p>

  <p>"No. I guess not. I wouldn't tell him if he did ask, even if I knew the
  answer. That's between you and him."</p>

  <p>"Shall I&mdash;shall I tell you&mdash;in confidence?"</p>

  <p>"No. Better not. No need just now. You're on the level. If it were my
  business, I would trust you sight unseen."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Andrew. You couldn't be ungenerous, could you!"</p>

  <p>"You mustn't forget. I'm Tom's friend. I've so to speak enlisted for the
  duration. I'm seeing him through this business."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I must tell you! I will! I'm going to be Lobsang Pun's chela! The
  way Nancy Strong was&mdash;and still is! I'm going through with it!
  I'm&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There, there, Elsa! Don't start crying again." He felt his heart grow
  cold within him. His words grew cold with it. "And don't be rash. Don't do
  anything just because you feel panicked into it. Think it over. Sleep on
  it."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, there's no other way out&mdash;nothing else to do: Please, won't
  you go and give Tom the message from Lobsang Pun?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'll go now. All right, I'll&mdash;tell him." He got up, hesitating.
  "Look up," he said. " I want to see your eyes."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I've been crying. I can't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look at me. Are you sure you've no message for Tom?"</p>

  <p>"No, Andrew. None. What could I say? If only I knew what to say that
  wouldn't make things worse&mdash;that wouldn't hurt Tom's feelings
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew, too, wished he knew what to say. He felt like swearing a streak.
  He craved to use his hands on something&mdash;to shape a big hunk of wood
  with long cleaving strokes. What he did say was:</p>

  <p>"Well, keep your heart up, Elsa. Be brave; and let's hope for the best.
  I'll be back later."</p>

  <p>He walked away, glancing upward at the great deep, dark gap in the wall.
  Almost no light came through it now. There was no sign of Old Ugly-face. He
  shook his fist at the gap.</p>

  <p>"You damned old bugger!" He almost startled himself, the unspoken thought
  was so vehement. "I wish I'd left you to the vultures with your dead
  friend!"</p>

  <p>When he was halfway down the ramp he paused&mdash;listened. He heard Elsa
  sobbing&mdash;and then, suddenly, Old Ugly-face's belly laugh:</p>

  <p>"Oo-hah-ha-ha-ha-ha-hah! My being damned old bugger! Oo-hah-ha-ha-ha-ha-
  hah!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch53"
     id="ch53">CHAPTER 53</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Tom was ominously taciturn. He and Andrew snatched a hurried
  meal of canned stuff. Then they went out to the ledge to change the guard. It
  was still not quite sunset. If the weather should hold there would be a
  nearly full moon, almost all night long, that should make it easy to guard
  the ledge against all comers. But Tom looked worried. He and Andrew leaned
  against the rebuilt barricade, each waiting for the other to speak. At last
  Andrew repeated Old Ugly-face's message.</p>

  <p>"Did you get it from him direct?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p>"It's accurate. Those were his words."</p>

  <p>"Oh."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh."</p>

  <p>Andrew stared into the rising wind across the ravine. Two yards away from
  his feet there was a sheer drop that the eye couldn't measure, into a ravine
  that made him dizzy to look at. There were eagles, getting ready to roost for
  the night, flying and screaming five hundred feet below. In the distance,
  beyond the ravine, perhaps ten miles away on eagles' wings, but farther on
  foot, the Shig-po-ling monastery was perched between earth and sky like a
  painting. It looked theatrical in the sunset. Huge walls. Courtyard within
  courtyard. An enormous central building with a long roof, studded with
  belfries and fluttering with prayer banners. Without artillery it would need
  an army of ten thousand men to capture that place. The only means of
  approach, at any rate in front, was the ledge on which Andrew and Tom stood;
  it wound around cliff after cliff and gradually widened until it became a
  practicable road that looked possible even for carts.</p>

  <p>One couldn't see anyone moving in the monastery. There was no one on the
  walls. The wind-blown blessing bells were inaudible at that distance. Smoke
  rose from the monastery kitchen. There must be thousands of monks at the
  evening meal or making ready for it. Andrew returned into the cavern for his
  binoculars. Through those, on the face of the cliff about two-thirds of the
  way between him and the monastery, he could see the masonry fronts of the
  natural caves in which hermits endured privation, alone in the dark. He
  counted eighteen hermit holes, but there were a lot more than that.</p>

  <p>Tom sat on the new barricade, staring at the monastery, saying nothing.
  Andrew decided to force the issue:</p>

  <p>"What beats me," he said, "is why Old Ugly-face couldn't tell you himself.
  Why use me as intermediary?"</p>

  <p>Tom turned his back to the wind, perhaps to see Andrew's face better in
  the fading light. At first he looked savagely angry, but Andrew's return
  stare didn't flinch; there was no answering resentment. So Tom's anger
  withdrew into its own gloom.</p>

  <p>"Ugly-face knows me like a book," he answered. "He's right. A man can't
  think straight when he's feeling sore with himself. I've been figuring out a
  plan to make it worth St. Malo's while to play with us."</p>

  <p>"You're crazy," said Andrew. "St. Malo still hopes to sell Old Ugly-face
  for cash, and then to steal the kid lama and run."</p>

  <p>"I know that," said Tom. "You can't change his sort. But I was thinking at
  the moment that there's plenty of gold in the monastery. Those monks own gold
  mines. They can only work 'em two months in the year, by crude methods, but
  they dig enough pay dirt, and carry it more than a hundred miles in baskets,
  to make the monastery rich. I thought of asking Ugly-face to promise St. Malo
  some of that gold. But it was a lousy idea. Give him gold, and you'd have to
  kill him to keep him from trying to steal it all."</p>

  <p>Andrew grinned: "He would kill you and me for the strawberry jam."</p>

  <p>"If we should kill him," said Tom, "Old Ugly-face wouldn't move a finger
  or pull a string to prevent someone from killing us. You don't know that old
  wizard. He's consistent. He doesn't kid himself he's a cushion between cause
  and effect. He lets consequences happen. Then he walks in on top of the
  consequences."</p>

  <p>Andrew scowled: "If he has a plan why can't he tell it to you and me?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you get the idea yet?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then here's the plain lowdown: if Old Ugly-face should take us into his
  confidence, he'd lose control of the situation. He might even have to obey
  us."</p>

  <p>"You think he controls the situation now?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. It's in the bag. What gives him his grip is the fact that he has no
  personal ambition. You and I 'ud pat ourselves on the back for doing a good
  job. We like to think well of Tom Grayne and Andrew Gunning. That old wizard
  doesn't care a damn about himself. He counts his personality as nothing but
  the shadow of his own soul. He doesn't care what happens to it. You and I do
  care what happens to our persons. That's the difference. And it's why he'll
  use us rough and tell us nothing."</p>

  <p>"Let's hear the rest of your plan," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"I've ditched it. But we may have to change it around and use part of it
  yet. You know where the hermits' caves are. They feed 'em by night, once a
  week. This is the night. A party of monks comes from the monastery to pass
  food and water through a hole in the wall of each cell. It isn't too
  difficult to attach yourself to that party in the dark and get into the
  monastery."</p>

  <p>"That sounds easy to say," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"I did it, during the winter, while you were away," Tom retorted. "It's a
  bit risky, but not too bad. They count the feeding party going out, but they
  don't count 'em in when they return. There are so many monks in that
  monastery that half of 'em don't know the other half. Plenty of places to
  hide. There were one or two scares, but nothing serious. The first day I was
  in here I had to punch a holy Joe who asked me what I thought I was doing out
  of chapel at prayer time. I knocked him so cold that he probably can't
  remember who hit him. I was in there three days&mdash;found out where they
  keep the young Dalai Lama&mdash;how often they change the guard&mdash;and all
  that. It was harder getting out than getting in. Too many big dogs outside.
  Got out at last with a funeral gang who were taking a corpse to be handed
  over to the ragyabas, who chop up the corpse to be fed to the dogs and
  vultures. The dogs were hungry, so they went for the corpse and I got away.
  If I'd had to kill one of those dogs, there'd have been trouble. Cold night,
  it was. Christmas Eve. Seventy below."</p>

  <p>"Don't they suspect you're here?"</p>

  <p>"No. I think not. I've been lucky. Got all the breaks so far. Hermits may
  have seen me through their peepholes. But I think they haven't. They'd have
  told. There'd have been a party sent to rout me out."</p>

  <p>"We'll need more than the breaks," said Andrew. "We've got to capture a
  fortified city."</p>

  <p>Tom grinned at last. "You're telling me. Well&mdash;we know the first
  move."</p>

  <p>"Which?"</p>

  <p>"Ugly-face said it."</p>

  <p>It was dark now. A few stars were shining, but great banks of cloud were
  rolling up to hide them. Tom peered curiously at Andrew&mdash;hesitated, and
  then said, as if ashamed of himself:</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose Elsa's idea was the same as mine&mdash;to buy St.
  Malo?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;anyhow&mdash;move number one is to shove St. Malo&mdash; goad
  him&mdash;push him&mdash;irritate him&mdash;make him act up."</p>

  <p>"With eighteen armed men," said Andrew. "All he'll need to tell them is
  that we've got supplies and money. They'll jump us quick."</p>

  <p>"St. Malo's no fighting man," Tom retorted.</p>

  <p>"Granted. He'd rather clean up after someone else's battle. But he could
  blockade us in here."</p>

  <p>"That's what we've got to prevent," said Tom. "We can't afford a blockade.
  When the fords are passable, support for Ram-pa Yap-shi might turn up from
  Lhasa. There's a couple of regiments there that haven't been paid and may
  come for their money. They'll eat everything they find on their way. Once
  here, the man with the money controls them. We've got to be it.&mdash;
  Tonight is the night they feed the hermits."</p>

  <p>"What of it? What good does that do us?"</p>

  <p>"They feed 'em around midnight. We must tell St. Malo. Can you imagine him
  missing that chance to open negotiations with Ram-pa Yap-shi?"</p>

  <p>"You're telling it," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"So we prod St. Malo. And we wise him up about the hermits. It's a rock-
  bound cinch he'll send word to the monastery, offering to betray Lobsang
  Pun's whereabouts in exchange for a fat fee. He won't be such a fool as to
  tell where Lobsang Pun is. He'll fix the price first. He'll want cash on the
  head of the barrel. That takes time."</p>

  <p>"Well then, what's our next move?"</p>

  <p>"The next move will be up to Ram-pa Yap-shi. We'll be the problem&mdash;
  the unknown quantity."</p>

  <p>At home it had been Andrew's job to spot flaws in cases. He did it as a
  natural reaction.</p>

  <p>"The least it means," he said, "is that we lose the initiative. We'll be
  cut off, and starved out, if nothing worse happens."</p>

  <p>"Nuts," Tom answered. "Where did you learn strategy?&mdash;Out of a book?
  Initiative resides in the ability to take advantage of the other man's
  mistakes. If he doesn't make 'em, you can't use 'em. He won't make 'em, if
  you don't tempt him. And until he has made 'em, who knows how good they'll
  be?"</p>

  <p>"So you're betting on Old Ugly-face?"</p>

  <p>Tom snapped his jaws: "I laid a bet on Ugly-face," he said, "&mdash;to
  win&mdash;on the day I knew he was a fugitive from Lhasa. Let's go irritate
  St. Malo."</p>

  <p>Andrew went back to the cavern for flashlights. He heard Old Ugly-face
  saying his prayers. All the Tibetans in the lower cavern were down on their
  knees with their foreheads on the floor. The lanterns, that cast astonishing
  shadows, shone in the eyes of the stabled animals. It was a weird sight. Old
  Ugly-face's voice, coming through the gap from the upper cavern, sounded
  something like a Gregorian chant. It conjured up a mental picture of Old
  Ugly-face in full canonicals, that were a sort of symbol of daimonic dignity.
  There was no sign of Elsa. Andrew whispered a few words to Bompo Tsering
  about changing the guard every hour and then returned to the ledge. Presently
  he and Tom climbed over the barricade and started along the track, Tom
  leading. There wasn't room for them side by side. If one should set a foot
  wrong, or stumble on a loose stone, or slip on the ice there was a long way
  to fall. There had been a sudden change in the weather; the moon was clouding
  over and there were signs of one of those springtime storms that do more to
  keep foreigners out of Tibet than all the laws and treaties in the world. Tom
  kicked a loose rock off the ledge, stopped and listened until it struck
  bottom, sending echoes pinging along the ravine like breaking ice. Then he
  spoke over his shoulder:</p>

  <p>"Keep your hair on and your feet under you. It gets worse from here
  on."</p>

  <p>Andrew answered cynically: "Ugly-face is praying for us. So you should
  worry. Let's hope he's praying for fine weather."</p>

  <p>Tom spoke again over his shoulder: "He'll need to pray like hell. There'll
  be a humdinger before long&mdash;perhaps the last storm of the season. Last
  ones usually are killers."</p>

  <p>They went ahead, leaning against the wind, feeling their way along the
  cliff on their right. Tom seemed to relish the thought of a storm, although
  he knew those Tibetan blizzards even better than Andrew did. He strode with
  vigor that made Andrew hustle to keep up.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Andrew that they were taking an idiot's chance. Tom's
  conviction that Old Ugly-face intended to use them and himself too, for that
  matter, like pawns in a desperate game, fitted in with Andrew's own
  conception, now that he had time to think about it. He imagined the old
  prelate back there in the cavern planning to sacrifice them all, including
  Elsa, in some subtle move that was beyond their comprehension because they
  didn't know the facts. It made his spine crawl.</p>

  <p>Tom seemed to be taking no precautions. He led as fast as he could
  struggle against the wind, along a ledge that zigzagged in and out on the
  face of a cliff from one natural ambush to the next. At one moment they were
  outlined by the light of the moon; at the next they were in deep shadow where
  a dozen men might have been lurking. It would only have needed a sudden shove
  to send both of them over the edge. That would have left Old Ugly-face and
  Elsa at St. Malo's mercy. When Tom called a halt for a few moments' rest,
  Andrew said to him:</p>

  <p>"We're asking for it. We'll get it. We're going straight into it."</p>

  <p>Tom didn't answer. He walked on. He must have guessed that Andrew had the
  wind up. The going got worse after a minute or two. The moon disappeared
  behind hurrying clouds. One could see nothing, nor hear much either, because
  the wind began blowing a half gale, screaming and moaning among the crags. It
  was all one sound, worse than the ocean at night. To have used a flashlight
  would have been an invitation to any rifleman keeping a lookout. St. Malo had
  eighteen men with rifles. Not good.</p>

  <p>Andrew overlooked the fact that, having been there all winter, Tom was
  familiar with every yard of the ledge. They were more than two miles from
  their cavern when Tom stopped and grabbed Andrew's arm. It was too dark to
  see each other. He had to shout against the wind, with his hand to his
  mouth:</p>

  <p>"On our right, two yards from here."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"A cave."</p>

  <p>They could hear the wind howling through it and thundering the way it does
  into a tunnel. Tom shouted again:</p>

  <p>"Passage at the rear. Into a gorge. Back of that's a cavern. He's
  there."</p>

  <p>Tom had his plan figured out. They entered the cave, using flashlights
  until at the rear they found the opening into a tunnel. It was three feet off
  the cavern floor and about half a man's height, the shape of an egg on its
  side. Someone in the tunnel or at the far end of it noticed their light. They
  heard noises that were off-key with the wind. At last a Tibetan came crawling
  along the tunnel on hands and knees. They dazzled his eyes for a second or
  two, then switched off the light. He called out to them. They couldn't hear
  what he said. Hoping the moon wouldn't come out suddenly from behind the
  clouds and give the Tibetan a chance for a pot-shot, Tom answered, in
  Tibetan. Then at last Andrew got the general drift of Tom's plan, and began
  to feel better. A good plan does that. It acts like champagne.</p>

  <p>Tom began by asking the man whether he had seen the monks from the
  monastery. The man said no. Tom told him this was the night when the monks
  came to feed the hermits. The Tibetan hadn't heard about that routine. He
  asked a couple of questions, and Tom answered them. Then he told the Tibetan
  to go and fetch St. Malo.</p>

  <p>"Tell him," said Tom, "that if he wants to talk to Tum-Glain he must come
  alone."</p>

  <p>The man disappeared, after trying, but failing to discover whether Tom had
  more than one companion: Tom and Andrew waited one on each side of the mouth
  of the tunnel. Tom was thinking of Elsa. There was no doubt of that, although
  he didn't mention her name. He said:</p>

  <p>"If St. Malo should shoot both or either of us now, that would tip off
  Ugly-face. He'd clear out. They'd never catch him."</p>

  <p>"Ugly-face wouldn't know," Andrew answered. He, too, was thinking of Elsa.
  "He's in the cavern, two miles away."</p>

  <p>"No he isn't," said Tom.</p>

  <p>There would have been no sense in arguing that. Andrew glanced sideways
  and nearly jumped out of his skin. There stood Ugly-face, in the mouth of the
  cave, with his back to the faintly luminous hurrying clouds where the moon
  was fighting its way through for a moment. He was a silhouette; Andrew
  couldn't see his face; but he was as unmistakable as the Great Pyramid.
  Shrouded in two of Andrew's blankets, he looked like a big black-hooded
  ghost. He stepped out of sight, around the corner, along the ledge.</p>

  <p>"Damn him, he's gone!" said Andrew.</p>

  <p>Tom asked: "No sign of Elsa?"</p>

  <p>"No. But I'll go look." Andrew returned after a minute. "No, no sign of
  her. I bet she's safe in our cavern. Bompo Tsering'll take good care of her.
  She was pretty well tuckered out. Let's hope she's asleep."</p>

  <p>Tom grunted. It might have meant anything; Andrew wished to hell he would
  say what he did mean. There were sounds again in the tunnel. This time a man
  came carrying a lantern. Alone. Not St. Malo. He was another Tibetan. He
  wanted to know how many men there were.</p>

  <p>"Tell St. Malo he may count them if he comes alone," Tom answered. "On
  your way, drag your rifle so we can hear you."</p>

  <p>The man turned back, dragging the butt of his rifle along the tunnel
  floor. Tom crossed to Andrew's side of the opening.</p>

  <p>"I guess St. Malo'll come this time. Tell him I've gone to watch the
  hermit-feeding, so's to give the alarm in case the monks learn where we are.
  Then tell him we've decided to bolt, and we advise him to. Say we'll let him
  get the hell out past our cavern, first thing in the morning. Say we'll give
  him some soft grub for the journey, provided he and his men unload their
  weapons and pass our cavern one by one at a walk. That ought to fool
  him."</p>

  <p>"Okay," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>Tom hesitated, so long that Andrew asked: "What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. But see here: don't mention Elsa."</p>

  <p>"I won't."</p>

  <p>Tom walked out of the cave to follow Old Ugly-face around the corner of
  the cliff. Andrew, cursing Tom's suspicion, waited, in pitch darkness, and
  after a long while St. Malo did come. He was carrying a lantern. He had a
  rifle, too, but he didn't seem to expect to use it. Andrew, taking care not
  to startle him, told him to lay it down on the tunnel floor. He obeyed.
  Andrew said:</p>

  <p>"You're covered, so no funny business."</p>

  <p>St. Malo sneered: "What you need is brains. Why should I start anything?
  Where's Tom Grayne?"</p>

  <p>Andrew delivered Tom's message. He elaborated, remarking off his own bat
  that Ugly-face feared the hermit feeders might come scouting along the ledge,
  learn too much and turn out the whole monastery.</p>

  <p>"So the tip is to clear out. Beat it for the sky line."</p>

  <p>"You're remarkably thoughtful for me all at once," St. Malo answered.</p>

  <p>But Andrew had expected that. He was ready for it. "We're afraid you might
  not get caught by the monks. We don't want a rat like you with eighteen men
  at our rear. We'll give you until two hours after daylight to go past our
  cavern&mdash;not a minute longer."</p>

  <p>St. Malo retorted: "What if I don't choose to do it?"</p>

  <p>Andrew didn't hesitate. "We've thought of that too. If you're not in sight
  by two hours after daybreak, we'll march. Our rearguard will shoot if they
  see you. Also, in that event, no handouts."</p>

  <p>"I believe you're lying," said St. Malo.</p>

  <p>"Think it over."</p>

  <p>"I will. Meanwhile, you may go to hell, Mr. bloody Andrew Gunning&mdash;
  you and Tom Grayne, both of you."</p>

  <p>He retreated into the tunnel, backward, leaving the rifle where it lay.
  That was too obvious: one of St. Malo's Tibetan riflemen was ambushed at the
  far end of the tunnel. Andrew ducked about a tenth of a second ahead of a
  bullet. Then he crept up to the tunnel mouth. Another bullet spat out of the
  darkness, but it missed him, and he got St. Malo's rifle&mdash;a good one; it
  had a telescopic sight. Someone had another shot at him while he edged along
  the side of the cave to the ledge and rejoined Tom.</p>

  <p>"Where's Old Ugly-face?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I was too late," Tom said. "Missed him. Gone to watch 'em feed the
  hermits, I guess. Did you talk to St. Malo?&mdash;Okay, let's go."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"Follow Ugly-face."</p>

  <p>"We'll have St. Malo at our backs," Andrew objected. "If he didn't fall
  for the bait, I'll eat his rifle. He'll come along behind us."</p>

  <p>"Sure. That's the idea. Let's get well ahead of him."</p>

  <p>They hurried along the ledge. Ten times Andrew could almost feel a bullet
  whizz by from behind. But he knew it must be imagination. Even if St. Malo
  were following, he couldn't possibly have seen them; Tom and he couldn't see
  each other. When Tom hesitated on the ledge to feel his way around an
  outleaning rock, Andrew bumped into him. Twice they almost fell together off
  the ledge. They didn't overtake Ugly-face. He might have fallen into the
  ravine for all they knew. There was no place where he could possibly have
  hidden. He couldn't have scaled the cliff, upward; there was no foothold; it
  was sheer wall, leaning slightly outward, and in places it was covered with
  ice.</p>

  <p>After a while they saw a light moving, far away where the ledge turned
  leftward in a wide arc toward the monastery. Tom stopped then, in the lee of
  a rock.</p>

  <p>"See 'em? That's the happy-blessed-hermit-feeding-company-of-pilgrims-on-
  the-path. That's what they call 'emselves."</p>

  <p>"Only one lantern," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but twenty-five or thirty monks. The number varies."</p>

  <p>"Weapons?"</p>

  <p>"You bet. Scared, too. They'd shoot at a shadow. They hate this job."</p>

  <p>"Any place to hide near where the hermits are?"</p>

  <p>"Not that I know of. We've got to find Ugly-face. Quick. Come on."</p>

  <p>There wasn't a place where a bird could have hidden, all the way along
  that ledge until they reached the cliff that was pockmarked by hermits'
  caves. The moon appeared again for a moment, so they could see the caves
  clearly. They were irregular, at different levels, some only reachable by
  footholds cut in the rock. The highest ones were open to the weather and
  seemed to be unoccupied. All the others, except one, were closed up with mud
  and stone masonry, leaving a hole, about five feet from the floor, barely
  large enough for a man to have pushed his head through. But the nearest cave
  seemed to have been broken into. There was no sign of hermits&mdash;no
  lights&mdash;no sounds.</p>

  <p>The approaching lantern was out of sight at the moment around a shoulder
  of the cliff. Tom and Andrew listened for sounds of St. Malo. They heard
  none. Then, suddenly, through the howling of the wind, they both caught the
  same sound at the same moment. It appeared to come from the direction of that
  one cave on the lower level that was only partially blocked up&mdash;the
  nearest one. They turned their flashlights on it. There was a gap in the
  masonry about three feet wide, extending to about two feet from the bottom.
  They only used their lights for about a quarter of a second. Both saw the
  same thing. A big hunk of rock appeared to raise itself and place itself
  exactly in the middle of the gap. It looked supernatural. Tom laughed:</p>

  <p>"I told you there's no way to beat that old hellion! Come on, let's go
  help him."</p>

  <p>His Holy Diplomatic Eminence, the Ringding Gelong Lama Lobsang Pun, alias
  Old Ugly-face, was inside the hermit's cave, busy immuring himself. First,
  though, he had pulled out from the cave the weather-mummied frozen carcass of
  a hermit, who had died since the last visit of the feeding patrol. He had
  dragged out the corpse through the gap made by brigands, who had searched the
  dead man's cave for sacred objects such as brigands need to keep away the
  devils who would otherwise accumulate like flies on the fat of their sinful
  pursuits. That carcass was good bait now. The oncoming monks would have to
  pause and say proper prayers, before pitching the remains over the cliff. It
  was a good enough bet for a prelate, wise in the ways of monks, that there,
  outside that cave, St. Malo would try to double-cross them all for much fine
  money.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch54"
     id="ch54">CHAPTER 54</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The moon had vanished. Old Ugly-face blinked at Tom's
  flashlight, detesting it. He looked like a great grim apparition from another
  world, too wise in the ways of inferior mortals to feel surprised at
  anything; but annoyed. He made no secret of his disapproval. If he felt
  friendly, he dissembled. In his eyes there was, perhaps, no enmity; but he
  withheld his praise. Having to shout against the howling wind increased the
  suggestion of irritation.</p>

  <p>"Your being much presumptuous!"</p>

  <p>"Where's Elsa?" Tom asked.</p>

  <p>Ugly-face retorted: "My knowing. Why your not knowing?"</p>

  <p>Andrew and Tom got the same hunch at the same moment: there was no time to
  lose. They barged into the cave and got busy. Andrew held the flashlight
  between his knees and passed the rocks. Tom laid two rocks in place. Old
  Ugly-face irritably pulled them down and began to replace them. There is
  probably an ordained angle at which hunks of diorite should block the opening
  of a hermit's cave. But Old Ugly-face was petulant, tired, nervous. Tom
  resumed the work and spoke to him, in Tibetan:</p>

  <p>"Blessed-personage-acceptably-praying being more useful than ignorant
  laboring man." Then in English to Andrew: "Give him the torch to hold."</p>

  <p>Andrew gave the torch to Ugly-face and went on playing mason's helper,
  passing the rocks as fast as Tom could lay them. There wasn't room for both
  of them to work in the gap. Old Ugly-face held the torch steady but he kept
  up a continuous growl of objections.</p>

  <p>"Being danger in another's duty," he grumbled.</p>

  <p>But Tom was well posted in Tibetan proverbs. "Being duty in another's
  danger," he retorted.</p>

  <p>"Done badly. Their observing that wall not being properly build."</p>

  <p>"Bless a blindness on them," Tom suggested.</p>

  <p>"Devils using your mouth!" said Ugly-face.</p>

  <p>He began flicking his beads with his thumb. They clicked like something
  loose being flicked by the wind. Tom worked like wildfire, but the mud was
  dry and frozen. There was no means of wetting it. The stones wouldn't stay in
  place without a lot of manipulating. The wall across the gap was only
  breast-high by the time they heard the chanting of the oncoming monks. They
  heard it in snatches because of the wind. Ugly-face switched off the light.
  They listened.</p>

  <p>It was difficult to see, but easy to imagine what was happening. In the
  face of every one of the hermits' caves there was a hole about breast-high.
  Through that the hermit could pass out his water bottle to be filled. Then he
  could hold out one hand to receive his week's supply of parched barley. The
  feeding patrol, chanting and spinning their prayer wheels as they came,
  paused in front of each cave just long enough for a mantra and for the hermit
  to stick out his arm to receive the supplies. The monks were in a hurry to
  get back to their nice draughty cells in the monastery. Besides, they were
  afraid of brigands, and not notably fond of hermits, whose disdainful
  austerity might be held to imply a rebuke of monkish luxury and sloth in
  spiritual exercises.</p>

  <p>So the procession came along fairly fast. It wasn't more than fifteen
  minutes before their enormous, parchment-covered iron lantern cast its rays
  into the opening. Tom and Andrew had to step back. Someone cried out then and
  the procession halted while the lantern bearer examined the corpse of the
  hermit that Old Ugly-face had laid in the way.</p>

  <p>It was quite easy now to observe through the chinks in the rebuilt wall.
  There was an argument going on. The monks crowded one another for a look at
  the hermit's body. They seemed to be wondering how it got there. The lantern
  bearer was the important man; he stood gesticulating in a long yakskin
  overcoat, giving orders that no one obeyed. Ugly-face seemed to understand
  every one of his gestures. He appeared to decide that he now knew enough. He
  retreated to the back of the cave and sat down.</p>

  <p>The lantern bearer's autocratic gestures became unmistakable at last. He
  commanded one man to recite the ritual for such occasions. He commanded
  another monk&mdash;a huge fellow armed with a sword, to go and examine the
  cave from which that hermit's body had been dragged. The monk refused. He was
  afraid. The lantern bearer struck him. All the other monks upheld the lantern
  bearer. So the big fellow with the sword came ahead, whirling his prayer
  wheel, clearly visible in silhouette against the lantern. His padded clothing
  and hood made him look bigger than he really was, but he was a giant at that.
  He looked like one of those tribesmen from the plains of northern Tibet,
  where the only possible survivors of the rigors of the climate are the
  stalwarts with huge lungs, big bones and iron physique.</p>

  <p>"I can count thirteen rifles," Tom whispered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, for a baseball bat!" said Andrew.</p>

  <p>The big monk stuck his head and shoulders through the opening. His head
  was within two feet of Andrew's. He had a face like a stone devil's; stupid
  but more dangerous for that very reason. No predicting what a stupid man
  would do. But he couldn't see into the dark. Suddenly he turned around and
  shouted to the lantern bearer that the cave was empty. He said something
  about brigands. The lantern bearer shouted and gestured, evidently ordering
  him into the cave, then turned his back to watch four monks roll the dead
  hermit's body off the ledge. The giant watched that too, leaning against the
  rebuilt wall. Fearing the wall might collapse with his weight, Andrew leaned
  against it on the inside. The four monks seemed afraid to touch the hermit's
  frozen body with their hands. They kicked it, spinning prayer wheels to ward
  off the devils that hang around corpses, while some of them chanted fragments
  of the Ritual for the Dead, until the corpse rolled over the edge.</p>

  <p>Then at last the giant monk began to climb into the opening, but his long
  overcoat made it difficult, so he pulled down a couple of rocks. After that,
  he leaned through for another good look before climbing in, and Tom nudged
  Andrew. They timed the play perfectly. Tom's right and Andrew's left landed
  on the monk's jaw on either side simultaneously like a couple of clubs. He
  collapsed. They dragged him through.</p>

  <p>"Lay him face downward," said Tom. "Then he'll give us warning&mdash;
  he'll try to turn over before he yells."</p>

  <p>That fellow didn't stir for several minutes. There was no sound from Ugly
  face. Neither Tom nor Andrew had heard him come forward, but there he was,
  standing beside them within thirty seconds of their dragging in the monk. He
  had seen&mdash;sensed something. He knew something. He laid his hand on
  Andrew's lips. He prodded Tom, for silence. Then he peered through the
  opening, spreading his arms to prevent Tom and Andrew from doing the same
  thing. So Tom pulled down a stone, and so did Andrew.</p>

  <p>St. Malo had come. He had one man with him, armed with a rifle. St. Malo
  also had a rifle. He looked like a Tibetan. He stood exactly in front of the
  opening of the cave, ten feet away, in the lantern light, and waited for the
  lantern bearer to accost him.</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face laid a hand on Andrew's shoulder. The strength of his grip
  was astonishing, but that was nothing compared to the daimonic vigor of his
  mind; it stirred something that responded. The thrill was commanding. It
  explained the difference between, say, a Napoleon and cannon fodder. The old
  Invincible was observing the enemy's error, calculating accurately how to
  turn it to his own use. One knew that.</p>

  <p>The lantern bearer took his time about approaching St. Malo. St. Malo
  might be a leader of brigands. He took care to be covered by the rifles of
  the monks behind him. Other monks came crowding past and cut off the view
  from the cave. The wind wasn't quite so gusty now, but the monks were
  chattering like ravens at a feast, so it was very difficult to hear what was
  said. Tom and Andrew heard snatches, and had to piece those together.</p>

  <p>There was no ceremony&mdash;none of those long-winded phrases that should
  precede any conversation between strangers in Tibet. St. Malo came straight
  to the point:</p>

  <p>"Your Holy Abbot the Lord Regent Ram-pa Yap-shi has offered a reward in
  gold, for the capture and delivery alive of the deposed and now fugitive lama
  the ex-Lord Regent Lobsang Pun. I claim the reward."</p>

  <p>The lantern bearer stepped on glare ice and very nearly fell off the ledge
  from excitement. All the other monks began to gabble advice. Some of them
  wanted to seize St. Malo and drag him away to the monastery to tell his story
  to the Lord Abbot Ram-pa Yap-shi himself. But St. Malo had arrogant guts in a
  crisis&mdash;insolence beyond measure. He took the high hand, in a loud
  voice, that reached the cave in wind-blown snatches:</p>

  <p>"After daybreak ... armed men from the monastery ... come where I direct
  ... Bring the reward ... gold ... English measure ... four loads ... Weighed
  in my presence."</p>

  <p>There was some discussion of that. Then:</p>

  <p>"I will show you Lobsang Pun's hiding-place. You shall also capture his
  accomplices ... foreigners ... may be lawfully slain ... ponies, yaks, stores
  ... no right to be in Tibet ... tell Ram-pa Yap-shi ... no tricks! ... No
  gold, no Lobsang Pun. Go tell him."</p>

  <p>After that, there was a hot quarrel. The monks surrounded St. Malo. Some
  of them were packed so tight against the cave that Tom and Andrew had to
  support the rebuilt wall to keep it from falling inward. They were all
  shouting, which was why they didn't hear the big prisoner. He had recovered
  consciousness and had to be jumped on, tied with his own girdle, gagged. That
  wasn't easy in the dark. He was nearly as strong as both men together. Andrew
  hammered his jaw with a rock to get his mouth open, shoved a glove in his
  mouth and tied the gag in with a strip torn from his own clothing. Old
  Ugly-face offered one of Andrew's blankets and they tied that around the
  man's head. He didn't smother, for some unfathomable reason.</p>

  <p>The monks had their way with St. Malo. He and his man stood them off for a
  minute or two; they realized that he wouldn't be any use to them dead, so
  they weren't too violent. They took his rifle away and forced him to go with
  them to the monastery, to tell his story and make his own terms with Ram-pa
  Yap-shi. They were so excited&mdash;only monks can get as excited as they
  were&mdash;that they forgot all about their missing giant. They didn't even
  bother about feeding the last few hermits. They marched back toward the
  monastery, chanting, following the lantern bearer, with St. Malo and his man
  in their midst. Then the snow began falling&mdash;lots of it.</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face turned the flashlight on Tom and spoke English:</p>

  <p>"Now my blessing you a hundred million blessings&mdash;now your going
  home&mdash;my thanking you too much."</p>

  <p>"Home?" said Andrew.</p>

  <p>Tom grinned. In the flashlight his face looked easy, almost instantly
  tolerant. But instead of answering Old Ugly-face he turned to Andrew: "Leave
  this to me. I'll manage him. Go back to our cavern. Bring Elsa, and all the
  men, and two days' rations. Quicker the better."</p>

  <p>The storm was getting well under way. When Andrew climbed out of the cave
  he could hardly stand against the wind&mdash;could hardly see a foot ahead
  through the driving snow.</p>

  <p>Bring Elsa&mdash;along that ledge?&mdash;in such a storm as this one? He
  turned his flashlight on the cave, for a last look, to make sure of his
  bearings. Old Ugly-face was letting Tom help him through the gap. In an open,
  unoccupied cave higher up, was a shadow that caught his eye through the
  driving snow because it seemed to move and he could imagine no reason why it
  should move. But when he focused the flashlight on it there was only a heap
  of stones on the ledge. He turned away, facing the storm.</p>

  <p>"God damn!" he muttered. "That looked like Elsa."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch55"
     id="ch55">CHAPTER 55</a></h2>

  <p class="first">That night's storm had one redeeming feature-lightning.
  Hail, rain, snow alternated. The wind blew with hurricane force, sometimes
  from two directions at once because it roared along converging valleys.
  Sometimes it blew Andrew against the cliff with such force that he couldn't
  move. At other times he clung to the cliff to keep from being blown off
  it&mdash;with one hand frozen; he had used his left glove to gag the giant
  monk. The lightning was like a barrage bursting in no-man's land. It made a
  swaying, fantastic horror of the thousand-foot drop into the ravine. But it
  did reveal the ledge.</p>

  <p>There's a limit to what a human being can take in the way of punishment
  and still retain will power. There's a point at which quitting begins to look
  like common sense. Andrew came closer to quitting, that night, than he cared
  to confess, except to himself in secret. For one thing, he felt sure St.
  Malo's men would be keeping a lookout near the mouth of their cave. They
  weren't likely to trust Tom and Andrew's Tibetans to keep cover. On the other
  hand, they might even have overcome their own fear of storm devils and have
  crept out to take the cavern by surprise, grab the booty and run.</p>

  <p>Barring human jacks-in-office, there is no worse bully in the world than a
  storm at high altitudes. A bullied man's brain can suggest a hundred mad
  reasons for doing the wrong thing. Andrew even thought of entering St. Malo's
  cave and trying to drive a bargain with his men. He could tell them St. Malo
  had been captured by Ram-pa Yap-shi's monks and carried off to the monastery.
  But there would be seventeen men to deal with. And Andrew was numb with cold.
  He thought better of it&mdash;if it was thought.</p>

  <p>By the time he had struggled as far as the entrance to St. Malo's cave, he
  was too exhausted for much else than instinctive action. It was habit that
  carried him on&mdash;the habit of finishing what he had said he would do. He
  crossed the entrance to St. Malo's cave on hands and knees, waiting for the
  lightning to reveal the inside of the cave. The wind howled into it, and
  through the short tunnel beyond. Added to that tumult were terrific peals of
  thunder&mdash;one continuous din that echoed and reechoed. A man couldn't
  have fought his way out of the tunnel against the hurricane force of the
  storm. At one moment a blast of hail swept into the cave so fiercely that it
  sounded like machine-gun bullets. Some of that hail was sharp enough to rip
  the leather of Andrew's overcoat.</p>

  <p>Two more miles of ledge&mdash;a waking nightmare. The last half-mile was
  something like the last round of a fight, in which the bell may save the
  loser from a knockout if he can only hang on. Andrew hung on. He made it. And
  Bompo Tsering was keeping a lookout, in spite of storm and devils. Lightning
  lighted, in the whirling sleet, Andrew must have looked like a devil. Bompo
  Tsering fired at him. He fell, unhit but exhausted. Bompo Tsering and two
  others dragged him into the cavern, where they chafed his numbed legs and
  arms.</p>

  <p>It was warm in there. The barricade across the ledge served as a
  windbreak. The tent, stretched across the entrance, howled and thundered like
  a topsail at sea, but it made the place habitable.</p>

  <p>Andrew couldn't speak for a while. His first words were: "Where's the Lady
  Elsa?"</p>

  <p>They all shook their heads. Bompo Tsering suspected Andrew's motive. The
  question must be a trick:</p>

  <p>"Your not knowing?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Damn your eyes! If I did know, would I ask? Come on now! Answer! What
  happened?"</p>

  <p>Then, cleaning his Mauser carefully, pausing every few words for
  confirmation from the other men, Bompo Tsering told how Elsa had gone with
  His Holiness Lobsang Pun.</p>

  <p>"Did she say nothing?"</p>

  <p>"No, Gunnigun."</p>

  <p>"Didn't she write a message?"</p>

  <p>"No, Gunnigun."</p>

  <p>Andrew believed and refused to believe it. He grabbed a lantern and
  climbed the ramp. It was all dark in the upper cavern. All was in order. He
  opened the brief-case&mdash;examined the straps of the bedding rolls
  &mdash;every place he could think of where Elsa might have left a scrap of
  writing to explain her movements. There were the remains of the food he had
  carried up for her. He sat down where she had sat, and ate what she had left
  &mdash;thinking&mdash;thinking&mdash;while the flickering lantern cast
  ghoulish shadows on the walls and the wind in the opening where Ugly-face had
  sat howled like lost souls in torment.</p>

  <p>Presently he felt the not yet familiar glide of consciousness into other
  dimensions. He saw Elsa. Very distinctly. Looking straight at him. It was one
  of those dream-like visions, much more intensely vivid than the sight called
  real. Like other visions that he had seen since he knew Elsa, it was
  composite, timeless, spaceless. In one and the same moment, she was as he had
  first seen her in this same cavern, with Tom; simultaneously he saw again all
  that long journey to Darjeeling. He saw himself, objectively as through a
  camera lens, delivering her child, in a storm, by the light of a burning
  packing case. Darjeeling. The monastery. Nancy Strong's house and Morgan
  Lewis. The incident at Gombaria's, and then the trail again&mdash;the return
  to the cavern&mdash;the completed circle&mdash;all that had been said and
  done until now&mdash;this moment. And this moment looked like farewell. It
  looked like a glimpse of another life. Was Elsa dead?</p>

  <p>Or was she doing what she had said Old Ugly-face habitually did&mdash;
  thinking with such power that her image entered the imagination of the one
  she thought of? It might be. He had been thinking of her. And he remembered
  she had said something else. He had joked about it at the time. Elsa's face
  began to recede into nowhere, until only melancholy eyes remained. Then they,
  too, vanished.</p>

  <p>He felt nervously disturbed, all the more so because there was no one with
  whom he could share the experience. Even to himself he couldn't describe it
  in words. Had it been a signal? If Elsa were dead, could she possibly project
  a vision of herself into his consciousness? He had heard of it being done. He
  had even read of it. But he didn't believe it. No. No. No. In Shanghai he had
  seen a Chinese necromancer produce one after another accurate visions of men
  and women dead numbers of years. But Andrew had proved that was a trick, by
  substituting, in his own mind, one memory for another. He had found he could
  control the necromancer.</p>

  <p>But he couldn't control this vision of Elsa. He couldn't restrain, or
  reduce, or suppress the pain it gave him&mdash;the heart stab&mdash;the
  nostalgic yearning.</p>

  <p>Was that her yearning? Or his? Was it farewell?</p>

  <p>Was that Elsa whom he had seen through the whirling snow, above the dead
  hermit's cave, when he left Old Ugly-face and Tom?</p>

  <p>Snatching up the lantern he looked around once more for a written message.
  He found none. Then he shook himself&mdash;flexed his muscles&mdash;threw off
  a mood, and started for the lower cavern. He felt better. He supposed he had
  been so exhausted that emotion got the better of him. Elsa was Tom's wife.
  Hell damn it, he could go Tom Grayne one better if it came to a tug of
  Stoicism. Self-control, discipline, self-respect-dignity, decency&mdash;
  those are the substance of things hoped for. The hell with theft. The hell
  with ends unjustified by means.</p>

  <p>He laughed at his own sententiousness as he descended the ramp. He was
  feeling much better. He had thrown off a perilous mood that came near losing
  him his will to do Tom Grayne no treachery in thought, or word, or deed. He
  had not even let treachery enter his mind, although he had felt its
  pressure.</p>

  <p>He helped himself to tea from the Tibetans' urn&mdash;swallowed two
  cupfuls of the nauseating bilge, spat out half of a third cupful, and then
  tackled the problem of getting the Tibetans out of the cavern. It had to be
  done quickly. At the first mention of what he intended, Bompo Tsering refused
  pointblank. He mutinied. He quoted Tibetan sacred scripture, to confound
  Andrew and to strengthen his own obstinacy:</p>

  <p>"Nobly born, the lesser of two evils always being the greater good. Sin
  and folly being sister harlots. Having commerce with them causing too much
  evil. Nay, my not going."</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering's smile suggested that Andrew was one against many. He
  placed a roll of bedding for him with his own hands, offered more tea, and
  remarked:</p>

  <p>"Tum-Glain being boss now. Your not being boss no longer."</p>

  <p>He couldn't have done Andrew a more signal favor; all he needed was
  opposition. It aroused his fighting humor, and there are more ways than one
  of fighting. He used genius, if leadership is that. If it isn't, he used some
  other intangible quality that has never failed him who counts on it, by land
  or sea.</p>

  <p>"You Tibetans aren't murderous people," he said. "Your religion forbids.
  You poison your friends and rob your enemies. But you've a conscience. When
  you get hysterical you're like any other mob, with fifty thousand
  superstitious impulses added. But on the whole you're swell people. You can
  laugh at yourselves."</p>

  <p>"My not understanding," said Bompo Tsering.</p>

  <p>"You will. You'll catch on in a minute."</p>

  <p>"Our not going out in storm," said Bompo Tsering, buttering his obstinacy
  with a smile. He had changed from "my" to "our." He felt the need of support.
  Andrew noticed that.</p>

  <p>"You've come a long march with me," said Andrew, "in winter and spring. A
  long, hard march, at great risk. We were hunted by brigands and soldiers. We
  worked like the devil. We didn't always have enough to eat; and frequently we
  nearly died of cold. You and I were almost drowned three times&mdash;once
  when a ferry upset; twice in ice-bound rivers, when the ice broke. We escaped
  from pursuit. We rescued His Holy Eminence the Ringding Gelong Lama Lobsang
  Pun, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thus acquiring too much merit," Bompo Tsering interrupted. "Nobly born
  Gunnigan, your needing much merit in lives to come. Such excellent merit as
  this perhaps saving you from many hells that your otherwise enduring after
  this death soon."</p>

  <p>Andrew took up where he left off: "You've come all this way, and endured
  all that hardship, and acquired all that merit, only to chuck it away tonight
  &mdash;merit and money and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering glanced around the cavern. Trade goods. Provisions.
  Clothing. Blankets. Yaks. Ponies. Sheep. And no doubt money in one of the
  loads. His thought was quite clear. Andrew didn't wait for him to voice
  it.</p>

  <p>"Unless you obey me," he said, "I'm going to shoot all these animals. You
  and the men couldn't carry the loads very far. You'd soon be overtaken by the
  monastery monks. You know what they'd do to you: they'd turn you loose naked
  to cherish your sins in the snow. That 'ud be a fine reward for months of
  hardship such as you have borne so bravely. Don't you think you're a
  fool?"</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering answered smiling: "Gunnigun, we blessed Tibetans obeying
  higher law." But his grin, in the quivering lantern light, looked vaguely
  less confident. He spun his prayer wheel.</p>

  <p>"I'm going now," said Andrew, "to help Tum-Glain and His Reverend Eminence
  Lobsang Pun. First, I will shoot the animals and take your money. You may do
  as you please and take the consequences. Your wife won't miss you; she has
  six other husbands, you adulterous dog. As for those hells you speak of, I
  shall mention your conduct to Lobsang Pun. He can bless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering interrupted: "His Holiness having blessed us all, especially
  me!"</p>

  <p>"And he can curse! How many of the curses of Lobsang Pun are needed to
  obliterate his blessings that a fool sees fit to throw away?"</p>

  <p>"Nobly born, this is terrible talk," said Bompo Tsering.</p>

  <p>"I have been told," said Andrew, "there are seven hells, and the worst is
  reserved for fools, who sold their store of merit for the sake of momentary
  comfort."</p>

  <p>He made that up, that moment, on the spur of necessity. There are volumes
  of books about Tibetan hells, written by men who believe they remember them.
  But Andrew had never read those books. Bompo Tsering hadn't either, so the
  breaks were even.</p>

  <p>"Maybe there being something in what your saying," Bompo Tsering admitted.
  "Life short time. Hell long time. Yes." He began hunting for justification.
  "Those men&mdash;" he pointed to the phony lama and the other culprits
  &mdash;"being hungry, no can do. Tum-Glain for punishment saying no tea, no
  food."</p>

  <p>"Feed 'em," Andrew retorted.</p>

  <p>But that gave another excuse. Bompo Tsering pounced on it: "Your not being
  Tum-Glain. Tum-Glain saying no, not feeding them."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Shall we leave them behind us to plunder the loads?"</p>

  <p>"That being too sinful. No, no!"</p>

  <p>"And the sin," Andrew observed profoundly, "would be on your head. You
  would be the hell-bound fool who let them do it! Aren't you ashamed of
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering smiled. There was no shame in him; only guts, superstition,
  good humor, liking for Andrew, and natural dislike of danger.</p>

  <p>"Nobly born, your knowing too much," he answered. "My choosing lesser of
  two evils. My obeying you, then what happening being your fault." He
  chuckled. Then he added: "But let us take the animals. Being better letting
  beasts struggle against storm, leaving us strong at end of journey."</p>

  <p>Only a Tibetan could have suggested that, with that storm raging. He knew
  what the ledge was like. The ponies were utterly out of the question; the
  poor scarecrow brutes couldn't have kept their foothold for a minute. The
  sheep could have balanced themselves, but what use would they be, except as
  food later on? In a bad storm, a sheep lies down and quits; they would have
  had to be carried. A Tibetan will carry a tired sheep until he has to lie
  down and die beside it. But Andrew had no use that night for dead sheep or
  dead Tibetans. The yaks might have carried them. But you have to blindfold a
  yak and mount him by vaulting on over his rump. After that, when you remove
  the blindfold he goes where he pleases. If they could have got the yaks past
  the barricade and started along the ledge, they could have kept their
  foothold. But a yak, especially when in single file, has a neat little trick
  of going crazy in a storm. And Tibetans have strange ideas about animals.
  They will jump on top of the loads and ride an already over-burdened beast up
  a steep hill. If anything goes wrong they will call it the animal's karma. At
  the top of the hill they will get off, to "double the easiness going down
  hill." No, the yaks, too, were out of the question. It broke Bompo Tsering's
  honest heart to leave those animals in comfort in the cavern with plenty of
  food and water, where, as he objected, brigands or St. Malo's men might come
  and steal them. Every Tibetan is almost as superstitious about brigands as he
  is about dugpas and devils. But Andrew couldn't be persuaded.</p>

  <p>He won the argument finally by telling Bompo Tsering to choose his yak and
  try to drive it outside into the storm. The yak chased him all over the
  cavern. That put everyone into a good temper and after that there was not
  much trouble. They loaded themselves with two days' rations of canned food,
  in addition to a small bag of dry barley for each man, and the inevitable tea
  urn. They were full of virtue&mdash;eager to acquire more merit, now that
  Bompo Tsering had made up their minds for them. They roughhoused the phony
  lama and his fellow culprits out into the open. Bompo Tsering flatly refused
  to disobey Tom's order not to feed them. He declared they had been let off
  too lightly: they should have been shot or thrown over the cliff. However, he
  compromised by bringing them along some extra barley, so that if Tom should
  choose to let them off part of their punishment they could feed them without
  depriving themselves. Then the real battle began. Bompo Tsering warned Andrew
  not to lead the way along the ledge.</p>

  <p>"Nobly born, come last! Bring up the rear!"</p>

  <p>He said it wasn't safe to trust some of the men&mdash;not safe to have
  them behind him. They might turn back. They might make other kinds of
  trouble.</p>

  <p>"True. Then that's your job," said Andrew. "You bring up the rear."</p>

  <p>He gave Bompo Tsering a full load for his Mauser, not for use, but for his
  spiritual comfort. All Tibetans believe Mauser pistols are the one infallible
  weapon. Even when the darned things jam, they still believe it. Mauser
  pistols are white man's magic.</p>

  <p>Then Andrew led stubbornly, not too fast, although it was a race between
  life and death&mdash;against time and the elements. The storm increased in
  violence. Hail, rain and snow in alternate blasts iced up the ledge. It
  sloped out in places. The force of the wind doubled. One man was blown into
  the ravine, but Andrew didn't know about that until afterwards. He couldn't
  see a yard. He couldn't hear the man next behind him, though he shouted the
  news at the top of his lungs. Anyhow, it was one of the phony lama's men, so
  he didn't much matter. He wasn't carrying a load. His loss made the phony
  lama easier to manage later on.</p>

  <p>Although he had covered the distance twice before during the night, Andrew
  couldn't recall landmarks. He couldn't judge time by distance, or distance by
  time, because he had to slow down wherever the ice was bad. He had to lead
  blindly, trusting faculties that all men have but only few can use. He was
  raging within, damning the guts of Old Ugly-face for having dared to mislead
  Elsa.</p>

  <p>"God Almighty, he's as good as a murderer! She'd have obeyed him, whatever
  he said! Couldn't he forbid her to follow him?"</p>

  <p>Anger was the fuel that kept him going, until intuition warned him he was
  near the mouth of St. Malo's cave. The wind confirmed it by the change in its
  tumult as it howled into the cave and through the short tunnel beyond.</p>

  <p>He craved no fight with St. Malo's men. He approached, groping his way as
  alertly as numbed muscles and ice-covered rock would permit. Judging by the
  change in the sound, he had just reached the edge of the opening of the cave,
  where the ledge was a little wider, when a hand reached out from total
  darkness, seized him by the shoulder and dragged him into the mouth of the
  pitch-black cave. He struck out with all the strength he had left&mdash;hit
  nothing. A hand seized his wrist. He heard a voice close to his ear:</p>

  <p>"This is Tom Grayne. Keep your hair on!"</p>

  <p>Andrew cursed him. "Damn your soul to hell! Do you know where Elsa is? Do
  you know what's happened to her?"</p>

  <p>They couldn't see each other. They couldn't hear without shouting. Tom
  thrust his face close to Andrew's:</p>

  <p>"Wasn't she in the cavern?"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"Then she's here!" Tom shouted. "Must be! Unless she's fallen off the
  ledge, there's nowhere else she can be! I believe she made a trade with St.
  Malo!"</p>

  <p>"You do?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Martyr complex!"</p>

  <p>"Nuts!" Andrew yelled at him. "Nuts! Do you hear me&mdash;nuts!" He wanted
  to crash his fist into Tom's mouth. He backed away for fear he might do it.
  Tom followed him, shouting against the wind:</p>

  <p>"She's lost! It's your fault! Why in hell did you bring her?"</p>

  <p>Andrew suddenly grew calm. He had to shout, but the anger was gone:</p>

  <p>"You mean, you've lost her! She has broken her heart&mdash;turned chela!
  But come on&mdash;what's your game here? Let's get busy!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch56"
     id="ch56">CHAPTER 56</a></h2>

  <p class="first">One by one Andrew's column filed like ghosts into the cave.
  Tom counted them as they passed into total darkness where a curve of the wall
  afforded protection from the wind.</p>

  <p>"One missing," he shouted.</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering reported the man dead. Then Andrew asked:</p>

  <p>"Where's Old Ugly-face?"</p>

  <p>Tom cupped his hands to Andrew's ear and shouted angrily: "Disarm St.
  Malo's men and we'll go find out."</p>

  <p>There was no sign of St. Malo's men, but Tom expected them. In a moment or
  two there came a light along the tunnel. The wind blew it out. Tom switched
  on a flashlight but directed it away from the tunnel, outward, toward the
  ledge, leaving everyone in darkness. After that they heard men in the tunnel,
  fighting against the wind. Tom cupped his hands again:</p>

  <p>"I've told St. Malo's men that he's a prisoner and they'll be scuppered by
  the monastery monks unless they join us. That scared 'em. They're bringing
  out their loads. That'll make 'em clumsy. Take 'em one at a time. Bring Bompo
  Tsering here."</p>

  <p>Andrew crossed the cave, ordered the men to be quiet, gave Bompo Tsering
  his flashlight and led him to where Tom was standing. Then he stood facing
  Tom, one on each side of the tunnel. He knew what Tom was expecting, and he
  hated him for it. He wondered what Tom would do if Elsa should show up with
  St. Malo's men. He knew she wouldn't, but he couldn't help wondering. It gave
  him a hunch. He cupped his hands and shouted to Bompo Tsering:</p>

  <p>"No kill! Fool 'em with the light! No kill!"</p>

  <p>The pitch-dark tunnel was filled with tumult; the men in it could neither
  see nor hear. They came out one by one, too heavily burdened to use their
  rifles, and believing they had only Tom to deal with.</p>

  <p>Bompo Tsering did a swell job. He flashed the light on his own men,
  letting the first man in the tunnel see them for a second, confusing him. He
  tried to back, but bumped into the man behind him. Andrew jerked the rifle
  out of his hands. Tom's fist knocked him spinning on the cave floor, where he
  was pounced on by Bompo Tsering's men. Andrew flung the rifle out into the
  night.</p>

  <p>The second man was more alert than the first. Tom had to hit him hard. He
  stumbled into Andrew and fought for his rifle, but Andrew twisted it out of
  his hands and hurled it after the first one. The third man was easier; Tom
  tackled him single-handed. Then it was Andrew's turn, and by that time Bompo
  Tsering's gang had caught on and were waiting like wolves to pounce. The
  floor was becoming littered up with, men and loads. It was almost like a
  shambles, where the steers come one by one along a passage. Only the last of
  the seventeen gave any real trouble. He was suspicious. He had come last on
  purpose. He went down on his hands and knees in the tunnel and tried to peer
  into the cave. He didn't move until Bompo Tsering used the flashlight again.
  Then he shot at the flashlight, missed, and Andrew went in after him. He
  dived under Andrew, to grab his legs, but Andrew kicked free and got behind
  him to block his retreat. Tom was in the tunnel by that time. So the last man
  went out, rifle and all, head first into the glare of Bompo Tsering's
  flashlight, where he fought pluckily and had to be beaten half
  unconscious.</p>

  <p>"You stay here," Tom shouted. "I'm going on in." He had to shout three
  times before there was a lull in the wind and Andrew understood what he
  said.</p>

  <p>Then Andrew got out of the tunnel and took charge. St. Malo's men were
  professional brigands. They couldn't be given a break or they'd take quick
  advantage of it. It was all to St. Malo's credit as a con-man that they had
  made the toilsome march from Sinkiang to meet him, probably on his bare
  promise of loot. Even if they were escaped felons, with only pursuit at their
  rear and no future but what St. Malo offered, nevertheless he must have made
  them believe in him. But now St. Malo was a prisoner. They were puzzled,
  bewildered, disposed to preserve their lives on any terms, and in no hurry to
  make matters worse for themselves.</p>

  <p>For the moment, Andrew's own men were the more dangerous. Too many loads
  of loot. Too many loaded rifles had not yet been thrown over the cliff. Even
  Bompo Tsering, who could be sensible about some things, wanted to pack three
  rifles for himself as well as his own bag of rations and one of the plundered
  loads. He and his men mutinied when Andrew began chucking rifles into the
  ravine. They threatened to make common cause with St. Malo's men. Andrew had
  a tough two minutes. It was dark. A couple of flashlights weren't much help.
  He didn't want to kill anyone. Certainly he wouldn't start the shooting
  &mdash;there'd have been a shambles in ten seconds. But it would have been
  madness to leave those captured rifles within reach of the punishment
  squad.</p>

  <p>In the glare of the flashlight he grabbed that last man to come through
  the tunnel, who had fought so hard and had given the most trouble. He was
  rubbing his ear and still unsteady on his feet, but beginning to think.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?"</p>

  <p>"Ga-pa-dug. My being headman."</p>

  <p>Andrew had him by the throat, but he grinned into Andrew's face,
  cheerfully impudent. He shouted in the teeth of the wind:</p>

  <p>"Your giving back our rifles-our making your men obey."</p>

  <p>He shouted so loud that Bompo Tsering heard it and relayed it to his men.
  No Tibetan craves to be bossed by brigands. Andrew snatched a rifle from the
  nearest man, threatened to break skulls with it, and within sixty seconds
  rifles were being pitched over the ledge as if they weren't worth a dollar a
  piece.</p>

  <p>Then Bompo Tsering rose to the occasion. It was a heartbreaker to have
  lost those precious rifles, but it was wonderful to be on the winning side.
  He approved of Andrew&mdash;gave him credit for having tricked Ga-pa-dug to
  say exactly what he wanted him to say. That amused, inspired, encouraged him.
  He turned to and helped to line up all St. Malo's men against the wall, with
  his own men staggered between them at proper intervals to prevent ganging up.
  He saw the point, too, of compelling St. Malo's men to carry their own
  burdens:</p>

  <p>"Their carrying now! Our taking later on. Good."</p>

  <p>Then Tom came out of the tunnel, cursing when Bompo Tsering turned the
  flashlight on him. He looked humiliated&mdash;mortified&mdash;ashamed
  &mdash;consequently furious. He snatched the flashlight from Bompo Tsering
  and used his own, too.</p>

  <p>"Where are the rifles?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Andrew answered him: "Over the cliff."</p>

  <p>He nodded&mdash;made no other comment. He was in no mood to praise Andrew.
  He inspected the prisoners one by one, going up close to each man, looking
  him straight in the eyes. Andrew understood very well that Tom was recovering
  some kind of peace with himself; so he waited patiently. He allowed him all
  the time he needed. He was seeing Elsa again&mdash;eyes, then her whole face,
  quite apart from the darkness and in no way affected by it. He couldn't
  understand what it meant, although he felt sure it was a message. Warning?
  Summons?</p>

  <p>He wondered that Tom couldn't see it. But Tom was seeing only his own
  necessities. He came and asked Andrew to lead the way along the ledge.</p>

  <p>"Get going. I'll bring up the rear."</p>

  <p>So Andrew led. The storm was worse than ever. At intervals he waited, in
  the lee of dykes and broken rocks, to let the straggling column catch up; but
  he could never be sure how many had caught up. All the way he was out of
  touch with Tom. Along the worst parts of the ledge he had to wait for the
  lightning to show the way. They were inside a snow cloud. It felt solid. They
  could hardly breathe. It wasn't so cold as it had been and the wind wasn't
  quite so strong, but it piled up all the more snow for that reason. They had
  to shove snow off the ledge before they could crawl forward. It came so fast
  that it was all piled up again before the next man crossed the cleared space.
  But the Tibetans couldn't have turned back without having to face Tom's
  Mauser. The third or fourth or fifth man might have got to him and hurled him
  over the ledge. But there was no one to lead the mutiny. One by one St.
  Malo's men dropped their loads over the cliff, unable to struggle with them
  any farther. The column followed its leader.</p>

  <p>The night was far spent when Andrew crawled on to the widening end of the
  ledge where the hermits' caves were, and staggered to his feet. Then he stood
  aside, waiting for Tom, counting the men as they hurried to the dead hermit's
  cave for shelter. Bompo Tsering waited beside Andrew, after crashing into him
  in a chaos of snow that was snatched up from the ledge and wind-whipped into
  their faces. He seemed cheerful enough. He shouted, spinning his prayer
  wheel:</p>

  <p>"This happy blessed country being too many devils their wanting it too
  much! No can get it!"</p>

  <p>Andrew ordered him into the hermit's cave, to keep the men from coming out
  until wanted. In passing he struck Andrew with his prayer wheel, on purpose,
  as a precaution, to prevent devils from getting him. Andrew called him
  back:</p>

  <p>"Try to make friends with Ga-pa-dug."</p>

  <p>He struck again, and then hurried away before Andrew's special private
  devils could invent a crazier task.</p>

  <p>At last Tom came. He and Andrew walked together to where the ledge widened
  and turned a corner and there was less wind. Intuition&mdash;instinct
  &mdash;something guided them. They pointed their flashlights suddenly in the
  same direction. At the end, of the zone of light, someone, whose back was
  toward them, stood talking to Old Ugly-face&mdash;two black phantoms nearly
  smothered in snow, gesticulating, shouting to each other against the wind.
  Then lightning&mdash;and incredible scores of phantoms&mdash;naked. Like a
  Dor illustration of Dante's Inferno.</p>

  <p>Forked lightning. A huge cliff, pockmarked with dark holes. Tumbled stone
  and broken masonry near the mouths of the holes. A ledge that ribboned into
  darkness. To the left, beneath the ledge, a sheer drop into swirling chaos.
  Phantoms along the ledge&mdash;so many they were uncountable. Naked. Stark
  naked. Scrawny and bearded and some of them old. They squatted along the rim
  of the ledge staring downward into that horrible abyss as if it were a hearth
  toward which they yearned. They didn't move much. Even when forked lightning
  shattered the darkness and they were as clearly outlined as by a
  photographer's magnesium flash, they didn't seem to move. Except that their
  hair blew in the wind, they might have been gargoyles carved of rock.</p>

  <p>One thing was clear. Old Ugly-face had broken open the cells and turned
  out the hermits. They hadn't clothing, food or weapons. Some of them looked
  too old and feeble to march half a mile; those were the fanatical ascetics,
  whose only ambition was to starve their bodies slowly into useless clay, that
  their souls might grow and they need not return to earth after death and be
  encumbered by new bodies and endure more austerities. But those were a small
  minority. Most of them were sinewy stalwarts, all the stronger for their
  ordeal&mdash;theological students&mdash;the everlasting miracle of Tibet
  strength of will and body achieved by abstinence and conquest of desire
  &mdash;authority attained through passionate humility. Old Ugly-face had gone
  through that ordeal in years gone by. He had lived stark naked. So he
  understood hermits.</p>

  <p>Between peals of thunder Tom yelled in Andrew's ear: "The old man's crazy!
  He's counting on hermits to force the monastery gates!"</p>

  <p>Andrew hardly heard him. He stared, waiting for the lightning flashes. At
  last he gripped Tom's arm:</p>

  <p>"Do you know who that is talking to him?"</p>

  <p>Tom didn't speak. When Andrew turned the flashlight on him he merely
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"Won't you go speak to her?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then I will."</p>

  <p>"Suit yourself."</p>

  <p>"Come with me."</p>

  <p>"No. I'm through."</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean?"</p>

  <p>"She has wiped my eye! She knew damned well I'd planned to be Old Ugly-
  face's chela!"</p>

  <p>"Says you! How should she know? Did you tell her?"</p>

  <p>"She knew all right. Go ahead&mdash;you talk to her. Don't mention me.
  I'll wait here."</p>

  <p>Andrew strode forward alone.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch57"
     id="ch57">CHAPTER 57</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Old Ugly-face saw Andrew coming. A crackling flash of
  lightning revealed the old prelate's glittering eyes and every grained
  wrinkle on his face. He made no sign of recognition. He turned his back and
  walked away toward the hermits, saluted by a cannonade of thunder that
  sounded like bursting mountains. Then Elsa turned and faced Andrew. He
  couldn't tell whether she welcomed him or not&mdash;whether she was surprised
  or not. There wasn't much of her visible under the peaked hood as she braced
  herself against the wind.</p>

  <p>The storm had reached its crisis. It began to exhaust itself in spastic
  squalls that tore rocks loose and sent them rolling over the abyss. A broken
  ice dam loosed a torrent across the ledge; poured out fifty feet into the
  wind before it curved downward and was lost in the dark whirling uproar. It
  was impossible to speak. Andrew threw an arm, around Elsa. He almost lifted
  her off her feet. She made no protest. She let him half carry, half drag her
  across the ledge to an empty hermit's cave, where the hollow roar within was
  silence compared to the tumult outside. There she braced herself, back to the
  wall. He used his flash-light. She shook her head. After that they spoke when
  they could see each other by the flash of forked lightning, and when they
  could hear between peals of thunder.</p>

  <p>"Take your glove, Andrew." She was breathless. "This is yours, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>It felt like a gift glove. He pulled it on. "Where did you get it?"</p>

  <p>"From the big monk&mdash;you gagged with it&mdash;in the dead hermit's
  cave. He recognized Lobsang Pun&mdash;loves him&mdash;would die for him.
  Lobsang Pun has sent him&mdash;to the monastery, to confirm St. Malo's
  story."</p>

  <p>Andrew had no suspicion how stern he looked and sounded: "Where were you
  when St. Malo came?"</p>

  <p>"In the cave above. You saw me when you went away. Didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered. "Saw. But I didn't believe. I went and looked for you,
  back in our cavern."</p>

  <p>She had recovered her breath now&mdash;spoke as measuredly as he: "Did you
  see me there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I meant&mdash;I hoped you would."</p>

  <p>"I saw you, very clearly. But I didn't understand. I got no message.
  &mdash;When did you get here?"</p>

  <p>"Before you did. I came with Lobsang Pun. When he looked in on you, in the
  entrance of St. Malo's cave, along there on the ledge, I was close behind him
  &mdash;almost touching him, ready to cling if the wind should&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew swore with concentrated vigor: "Lobsang Pun shall answer for it!
  Damn him!"</p>

  <p>"Answer for what, Andrew?"</p>

  <p>"For bringing you here. Why did you give us the slip? Why didn't you stay
  in our cavern?"</p>

  <p>He couldn't hear her laugh because thunder out-crashed all other sound.
  Perhaps she only smiled. The lightning revealed her pale face, bright-eyed,
  merry with unexpected humor. When the thunder rolled its echoes away after it
  and ceased, she asked him:</p>

  <p>"Andrew, if I had asked you, would you have brought me here? Would you
  have let me come?"</p>

  <p>He laid his hands on her shoulder. She put her hands on his.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, unsmiling.</p>

  <p>She nodded. Then he surprised her:</p>

  <p>"I've no right to let or not let."</p>

  <p>Her eyes widened. Her hands fell. She clasped them in front of her. "Your
  life is yours," said Andrew. "What are you planning to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Must I tell?"</p>

  <p>"No. You don't have to."</p>

  <p>"I've already told. I told you in the cavern."</p>

  <p>"I didn't listen."</p>

  <p>She looked puzzled. "But now, if I tell, you will listen?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I've been talking to Tom Grayne."</p>

  <p>Her eyes tried to read his while the zigzag lightning tore the storm
  apart; but all that she saw resembled anger, and beneath it the veil she
  could almost never penetrate. When thunder ceased again she asked:</p>

  <p>"Andrew, how is Tom taking it?"</p>

  <p>"Badly."</p>

  <p>"Did he speak of me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"He knows I'm here. He saw me. Does he understand now that I didn't even
  think of joining St. Malo?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He knows that."</p>

  <p>Thunder silenced them again. Lightning showed them to each other, in
  shimmering flashes that brought the cave walls leaping out of darkness. A
  furious squall battered the ledge with hail. Then, relatively, there was
  quiet.</p>

  <p>"Andrew&mdash;is there something I should do to help Tom&mdash;to make it
  easier?"</p>

  <p>"There's always something," he answered, "but secondhand stuff's no
  good."</p>

  <p>"You mean I should go and speak to him?"</p>

  <p>"No. You should do what you choose, off your own bat."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "I don't feel vindictive. But I don't choose to speak first. I
  haven't told you what he said, ten minutes after we met."</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, what is there I can do?"</p>

  <p>"I know what I'll do," he answered. "I'll stand by Tom until he needs me
  no longer."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't need me," Elsa objected. "He said so."</p>

  <p>"After that I'm off home to America. I guess that'll be soon. I know Tom's
  intention."</p>

  <p>"What? What is it? Tell me!"</p>

  <p>"He told me in confidence."</p>

  <p>The storm was fighting a rear-guard action now, bringing up new batteries
  of thunder to mask the main retreat that rolled away along the valley
  southward. Frenzied blasts of wind shrieked like charging devils, reached
  their objective and died. Then speech was possible again.</p>

  <p>"One night you told me about what you will do in America."</p>

  <p>"I'll take the first job that offers. One thing leads to another. I won't
  forget what I've learned. I guess I'll do what I know."</p>

  <p>He laughed. The humor of it suddenly occurred to him: a little personal
  equation was lifting its head amid almost cosmic grandeur. And why "almost"?
  Reality was there&mdash;then&mdash;eternally&mdash;now&mdash;that
  minute&mdash;microcosm within macrocosm. It was his to command&mdash;part of
  his consciousness&mdash;his to mold as he pleased.</p>

  <p>He didn't hesitate. He took Elsa into his arms&mdash;hugged her to him
  &mdash;kissed her storm-wet face until she sobbed for breath&mdash;
  struggling. He didn't know his own strength.</p>

  <p>"Andrew, please&mdash;please!"</p>

  <p>Tom Grayne came in then, using his flashlight. He had the generosity to
  switch it off. He had the self-control to wait for one of them to speak.</p>

  <p>Andrew said quietly: "Elsa will come with me to America, as soon as this
  show's over."</p>

  <p>Tom used his flashlight again. He was about to speak. Elsa burst in ahead
  of him:</p>

  <p>"No, Andrew, no! Tom, it isn't true!"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't share a wife with my best friend," Tom answered.</p>

  <p>Andrew cautioned him: "Easy!"</p>

  <p>Elsa thrust herself between them. "Tom! Andrew! Please! Listen to me! I'm
  not worth fighting for! This is all my fault&mdash;all of it! An-drew, I will
  no more be a load on you&mdash;ruin your life&mdash;than I'll consent to
  spoil Tom's any longer!"</p>

  <p>"Your life's your own," Andrew answered. "I have asked you to share it
  with me."</p>

  <p>"I know, I know! Oh, Andrew, you're too generous to live! You think I'm
  helpless, so you offer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I asked," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I couldn't accept that, even if&mdash;even if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do," he interrupted. "I have loved you since before Darjeeling."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, please don't blaspheme! You know that isn't true! It couldn't be.
  You're being generous and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted again: "Tom&mdash;turn your light on both of us.&mdash;
  Now, Elsa&mdash;in the presence of Tom Grayne&mdash;chin up&mdash;I love you.
  Do you love me?"</p>

  <p>She couldn't answer. She stared, wide-eyed. He repeated:</p>

  <p>"I love you with all my heart. Do you love me?"</p>

  <p>She spoke suddenly, in gasps because her heart was thumping:</p>

  <p>"Andrew, it's too late! I have asked Lobsang Pun to take me as his
  chela&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped&mdash;stared. Tom followed her gaze. He moved the flashlight,
  turning half around to face the entrance.</p>

  <p>The light framed Old Ugly-face.</p>

  <p>The wind had died. Like a back drop behind him, snow fell in big silent
  flakes that looked like shredded gold in the rays of the electric torch.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch58"
     id="ch58">CHAPTER 58</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was no wind now, but a hushed silence, in which the
  soft snowfall was almost audible. Except that his eyes glittered in the light
  of Tom Grayne's torch, Old Ugly-face looked like a statue wonderfully carved
  from grained wood&mdash;an image of the daemon of the storm&mdash;who had
  compelled the storm to cease&mdash;hooded&mdash;dripping with thawing
  snow&mdash;contemptuously angry. At last he spoke:</p>

  <p>"Faggot! Three fools in one! Tied in one bundle by knots of fear!"</p>

  <p>"Fear of what?" Andrew demanded.</p>

  <p>Elsa shuddered. Andrew was too calm. He was an explosion&mdash;conceived
  &mdash;on the brink of becoming. She reached for his hand&mdash;held it. He
  crushed her fingers until she could hardly endure the pressure. But she did
  endure it, in silence&mdash;until Old Ugly-face said sternly:</p>

  <p>"Fearing means being end, and end being means!"</p>

  <p>Elsa's right hand disengaged Andrew's fingers. She chafed her own, then
  took his hand again, knowing a scapegoat is an almost irresistible
  temptation. She herself&mdash;how often!&mdash;had been whipping girl for the
  relief of prejudices that had power to be cruel. Ministers, teachers, parents
  had habitually vented hatred on her that was really hatred of their own
  grossness. More than once Tom had forgotten dignity; reason, justice. She
  could forgive Tom's outbreaks; him she no longer loved, nor did she wish him
  to love her. But the dread that Andrew might behave unmanly made her heart
  sick. She prayed for him, almost in words aloud.</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face continued to answer Andrew: "Seeking spirit! Three hungry
  jackals sniffing blood from far-off!" He paused. "Seeking vision! Ravens
  pecking eyes of corpses!" A longer pause. Then, with rising scorn: "Hunting
  happiness! Pigs rooting for fallen fruit to glut their bellies!" He thrust
  out his lower lip. His eyes glittered indignation: "Your begging favors
  &mdash;of me!"</p>

  <p>Silence. He had such power that waiting seconds became aeons of
  humiliation&mdash;eternities, in which to fall from self-esteem into the
  stagnant deeps of self-contempt. It was beyond Elsa's endurance that Andrew
  should be so cast down. She pleaded:</p>

  <p>"Father Mahatma&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face rebuked her savagely: "Your calling me by that blessed name,
  your lying tongue soon bearing false witness against you also! My being less
  than dirt at my Master's feet!"</p>

  <p>Silence again. He glared at Andrew, his lips moving amid the wrinkles as
  if he chewed on words to moisten them. He selected a phrase&mdash;hurled
  it:</p>

  <p>"Life!&mdash;Liberty!&mdash;P'soot of happiness!" His gesture was like the
  down-turned thumb of a Vestal. "Life too small, too short for your
  stupidity&mdash;if your thinking liberty and do-as-damn-please being same
  thing!"</p>

  <p>Andrew showed interest. The far-away lightning stabbed the dying night.
  Thunder rolled sullenly. Old Ugly-face raised a huge prayer wheel that he had
  taken from some hermit; it looked like a mace from a house of parliament. In
  its bronze bulb, that revolved when shaken, were a thousand incantations
  written on scraps of parchment. Each turn of the shaken wheel was a thousand
  blessings on the footsteps of the pilgrims on the Path from mortal matter
  &mdash;nothingness to spiritual being. He shook the thing at Andrew again and
  again:</p>

  <p>"My telling you! Your listening! P'soot of happiness being same as running
  away from happiness! Idiot! How can your p'sooing what is beautifully
  p'sooing you? Running away round&mdash;around! Circle! Time your waking up!
  Snoring deep-sleeper! Happiness being cause, not effect! Grief becoming yours
  because your p'sooing happiness! Burrowing vole! Why your not letting
  happiness overtaking you, employing and bringing wisdom? Your being fearful
  of being&mdash;doing what your knowing! Man not being means toward end! All
  ends being means toward man!&mdash;Damned old bugger, am I!"</p>

  <p>Almost imperceptibly Andrew bowed acknowledgment that the Force behind the
  scourging words had aimed straight, blow upon blow. Old Ugly-face glared,
  scowled, turned on Tom Grayne, reading him now. Anger waned. The Asiatic eyes
  lost no fire, but they burned with another flame, less merciless. After a
  long pause he said slowly:</p>

  <p>"My also being too much sinful&mdash;liquidating karma&mdash;must not
  refuse!" Silence for ten heartbeats. Then: "But can your being humble?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Tom answered. "I wish to find out." His voice sounded so
  screwy and his words so flat that he himself balked; he coughed&mdash;
  pretended to clear his throat. But he stole a triumphant glance sideways at
  Elsa, his thought leaping like a spark from pole to pole:</p>

  <p>"Steal my track, would you! I win!"</p>

  <p>Andrew caught the thought as clearly as if it were directed at him. He
  squeezed Elsa's hand. Old Ugly-face said to Tom:</p>

  <p>"Time now for being-doing! Now our soon seeing what karma bringing
  forth!"</p>

  <p>The old man rounded his lips and boomed the sacred syllable that holds
  within itself all ends and all beginnings, leaving only the Path to
  appear:</p>

  <p>"Aum-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m!"</p>

  <p>Then he turned his back. Shaking the big prayer wheel, he trudged away
  into the snow and vanished.</p>

  <p>Tom looked like the shadow of anticlimax. He had boasted not secretly
  enough and too soon. After a moment, forcing his voice to be calm, he said to
  Andrew: "Shall we keep together?"</p>

  <p>Andrew switched on his flashlight. He answered stiffly: "It's up to you.
  You're head man."</p>

  <p>Tom's voice changed again. He sounded shameless, because shame tortured
  him: "The worst is ahead. Old Ugly-face thinks he fooled me, but I know him.
  He believes he can finish without our help. If he can, he will. Foreigners
  are outlaws. He's the anti-foreigner. It 'ud look bad to succeed with foreign
  help. So, if we can't hang on, he'll shake us and say it was our karma."</p>

  <p>"We must finish what we started," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"That's the point. This is the last move. Let's stick together."</p>

  <p>"We'd better feed our men," Andrew suggested.</p>

  <p>Tom agreed: "You attend to it. I'll watch Old Ugly-face. I'll have to go
  close or maybe lose him in the snow. When he gets going I'll&mdash;" He
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Fire three shots," said Andrew. "We'll be able to hear that."</p>

  <p>"Right. I'll do it. You look after the men."</p>

  <p>Andrew framed Elsa in torchlight against the cave wall. Tom didn't look at
  her. He switched off his own light and vanished. Andrew took her in his
  arms.</p>

  <p>"Kiss me," he said, "and say I'm wonderful! I need a pep-talk."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you're&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's enough. Hold it. Probably we'll all be dead by sunrise, but let's
  give it a whirl. We won't die lonely, you and I. Oh, Jesus Christ, I hate to
  see Tom Grayne crack like a politician!"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, Tom has been a long time all alone&mdash;almost like Peary and
  the North Pole&mdash;sacrificing, enduring, striving to win a secret. He has
  worked and worked. Now he feels we're stealing his&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know. I know. Christ give him the guts to finish clean! Elsa! If I
  should lose sight of the end for the sake of the means, just shoot me, will
  you!"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I won't ever be there&mdash;Turn of the light. It's a symbol. It
  hurts. Let us talk in the dark, it's truer."</p>

  <p>He did as she asked.</p>

  <p>"Andrew, you're being nobly generous. I know that of you. But as for
  loving me, I simply can't believe it."</p>

  <p>"But who wants to believe? What do you know? What does your heart
  say?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, it trembles."</p>

  <p>"You're tired, that's all that's the matter. You need sleep. You've been
  on the go since daybreak."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I'm only bewildered. I don't feel too tired. I think you don't
  understand that I asked Lobsang Pun to take me as his chela. That's
  irrevocable. Don't you understand it's a solemn act of submission? It commits
  me until&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did he say yes?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"What did he say?"</p>

  <p>"He said a strange thing."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"He said 'Patience! Love doesn't come between man and woman!' I think he
  meant me and Tom."</p>

  <p>Andrew laughed grimly: "You listen to me. If that old mystic knows a tenth
  of what I credit him with, he knows how long I've loved you, and how hard
  I've had to fight to keep you from finding it out."</p>

  <p>"Andrew! You mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He rearranged the hood of her overcoat&mdash;re-tied her muffler. He
  switched on the light, tucked her arm through his and set out through the
  snow for the cave where the Tibetans waited, talking as they went.</p>

  <p>"I've played square with Tom&mdash;gave him the last chance he's entitled
  to, and one more for good measure. So now you're mine. If Ugly-face believes
  the contrary, he'll have to be taught."</p>

  <p>She stopped him after a moment, clinging to him, pulling, so that they
  faced each other.</p>

  <p>"Andrew! Look at me! You must! You must understand! This temptation! It is
  what they say always happens&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who said it?"</p>

  <p>"Nancy Strong said it."</p>

  <p>"Damn Nancy Strong. Let her mind her own business."</p>

  <p>"It always happens, to everyone who makes a vow of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You haven't made your vow yet. I've made mine. I made it to me and to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, always the temptation comes. It's always wonderful&mdash;so
  luring&mdash;so tender! It looks like heaven. But oh, Andrew, dear, I love
  you too much to ruin your life. I won't! So this is hail and farewell! It's
  good-bye. Kiss me again, once more&mdash;this one last&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He switched off the light ... When he could speak he said:</p>

  <p>"Swell. That settles it. It's good-bye to the old life&mdash;on with the
  new!&mdash;You'll like America," he added.</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I'd love anywhere where you are, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Love me, love my U.S.A.!" he answered. "Come on, let's turn out the
  men!"</p>

  <p>The crowded cave where the Tibetans waited hummed with argument. They had
  boiled tea long ago, using yak-dung they had carried with them. Bompo Tsering
  had doled out cupfuls to the phony lama's men&mdash;"to keeping them alive
  for Tum-Glain's killing," as he explained to Andrew. Bompo Tsering and St.
  Malo's headman Ga-pa-dug seemed to have struck up a friendship; but the phony
  lama had been telling wild tales about dugpas and the spirits of dead
  hermits. He had more than half of the men verging on mutiny. Even some of
  Andrew's men were hesitating. A breech-bolt clicked. Andrew thrust Elsa out
  of the way. The phony lama picked up a lump of diorite and hurled&mdash;
  missed Andrew's head by an inch.</p>

  <p>That saved the situation. It was the catalyst. It crystallized emotions
  into plus and minus. Men knew their minds. Bompo Tsering and Ga-pa-dug jumped
  on the phony lama&mdash;kicked, beat, cursed him&mdash;tore away his rosary
  and relics&mdash;ran him out into the snow and left him sprawling more dead
  than alive.</p>

  <p>"Barley!" said Andrew. "Give the rest of 'em barley."</p>

  <p>"But, Gunnigun&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Feed them! Did you hear me?"</p>

  <p>The spare barley bag was tossed to the punishment squad. They pounced on
  it filled their mouths, then pockets.</p>

  <p>"Now then! Who marches with me? Who gets thrown over the cliff?"</p>

  <p>No answer, though Andrew waited while a man could chew on hard barley five
  or six times. Ga-pa-dug nudged Bompo Tsering, who spoke to Andrew:</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun&mdash;what now?"</p>

  <p>"I have wasted food! Throw them over the cliff. Begin with that man."</p>

  <p>The only difficulty then was to prevent the execution. The malingerers
  begged mercy, crying, struggling, protesting willingness, flinging themselves
  on the ground&mdash;kicked, beaten. Andrew's shouts were unheard in the
  tumult; he had loosed savagery that he couldn't stop.</p>

  <p>Luck interfered&mdash;chance&mdash;the signal chosen at random and the
  stark coincidence of time. Tom Grayne's three pistol shots, deadened by the
  snowfall, announced that Old Ugly-face was on the move. They sounded like
  torpedoes on a fog-bound railroad track. Andrew answered instantly. He fired
  three shots at the sky. The fighting ceased.</p>

  <p>Andrew roared: "Fall in!" Then after a moment the familiar command: "Bompo
  Tsering leading&mdash;column two by two&mdash;march!"</p>

  <p>They obeyed. They left their phony lama sprawling in the snow and trudged
  forward, not knowing whither or why. The phony lama slunk back to the
  cave.</p>

  <p>"Jesus!" said Andrew, tucking Elsa's arm through his. He shortened his
  stride, so that she could keep step. "You and I have seen death close up lots
  of times. But that was the nearest. We've got to watch out. They're as touchy
  as fulminate."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch59"
     id="ch59">CHAPTER 59</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The storm, veering around in a wide arc, began to return,
  like a dog to its vomit. Thunder and lightning again, but not much wind yet.
  From a black sky lightning stabbed the whirling snow and revealed the
  procession, in shimmering glimpses&mdash;Old Ugly-face leading. The grand old
  mystic had seized his moment, and doubt was not in him. He was destiny's
  agent, self-identified&mdash;a swimmer on the rising tide of
  spirit&mdash;beyond praise. In his right fist he shook the prayer wheel.
  Andrew and Elsa couldn't hear him, but he appeared to be chanting. Behind
  him, in groups of twos, threes, dozens, the naked hermits trouped like ghosts
  arisen from their graves.</p>

  <p>"Lord love and look at us!" said Andrew. "It's almost too crazy to fail!
  Almost! It's like the Angels at Mons. Did Old Ugly-face tell you his
  plan?"</p>

  <p>"No. I saw him rout out the hermits and harangue them. I heard some of it
  &mdash;a little. It was like the end of the world and people rising from the
  dead. Lobsang Pun pulled and kicked down the wall of the first cave and
  dragged the hermit out."</p>

  <p>"How near were you?"</p>

  <p>"As close as I could get without Tom seeing me. I didn't want Tom to see
  me, because I knew&mdash;well, you know what he did think. Lobsang Pun shook
  that first hermit&mdash;pulled his beard&mdash;told him it was time to
  translate merit into action. The hermit resisted. He pleaded sanctuary.
  Lobsang Pun accused him of having guzzled virtue in his cave like a pig in a
  pen&mdash;said he'd need ten million years in hell to purge his vanity unless
  he stirred himself. He said the Shig-po-ling monastery has become a cesspool
  in which the monks wallow in lust. He blamed that on the hermits
  &mdash;especially that first one. 'If you're a saint,' he shouted at him,
  'you should know better. If you're not a saint, now is your opportunity to be
  one!' It was from him that he took the prayer wheel. He beat the hermit with
  it. After that they prayed together, and presently the hermit was helping him
  to break into the other caves."</p>

  <p>"What was Tom doing?"</p>

  <p>"Watching, at first. But pretty soon he was helping to pull down rocks and
  rout our hermits. I kept away. I didn't want Tom to see me."</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose he told Tom what his plan is?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I saw Tom talking to him. Soon after that Tom went away
  &mdash;I suppose to overtake you."</p>

  <p>"No," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"Why do you say no? Tom came back with you later."</p>

  <p>The thought in Andrew's mind was: "Tom went looking for you in St. Malo's
  cave." He had almost said it. It was true. But he thought of a truth that
  tasted less sour:</p>

  <p>"Tom helped me to bring St. Malo's men."</p>

  <p>Even so, they fell silent for a minute or two. There began to be glimpses
  of Tom Grayne. Through the snow, by lightning glare, his windproof overcoat
  was distinguishable amid the hermits' naked skins. At moments he looked like
  a shadow. At other moments he bulked big and husky, striding from group to
  group, working his way forward, gradually overtaking the seven naked
  scarecrows who seemed to have elected themselves Old Ugly-face's
  bodyguard.</p>

  <p>"I suspect Tom knows part of the plan." said Andrew. "I think he doubts
  it'll work. So do I. This is too simple&mdash;crazy, yes&mdash;but not crazy
  enough. It looks to me he's going to march up to the monastery gate and count
  on the superstition of the monks. He figures they'll open and let him in for
  fear of offending holy hermits. But then what? Three or five thousand
  fanatics, obeying Ram-pa Yap-shi! We've a fat chance!"</p>

  <p>Silence again for a while, rhythmed by the snow-deadened tramp of the
  Tibetans close behind them. Andrew wondered at Elsa's physical endurance. He
  didn't speak of it, for fear it might remind her of fatigue. She was striding
  along beside him, keeping step, with her arm through his, not leaning
  heavily. Even Old Ugly-face's vitality was hardly more remarkable than
  hers.</p>

  <p>But the wind was rising again, whining amid dark crags. Talking had become
  too difficult. He wanted to ask questions, but Elsa would have had to shout.
  The physical strain on her would be too great. The questions phrased
  themselves in his mind as vehemently as if he were examining a witness. All
  they lacked was voice:</p>

  <p>"Old Ugly-face can't be all that crazy! But what does he know? What can he
  know?"</p>

  <p>The answer phrased itself as if Elsa replied: "'Ask and it shall be
  given.' Can't he ask? You heard him speak of his own Master."</p>

  <p>But Elsa hadn't spoken. A flash of lightning revealed her gazing ahead as
  she trudged beside him, leaning a little more heavily now because the snow
  was deep. There was a dark cave on the right; he even thought of taking her
  in there to shelter a while. Then he could question her while she rested. But
  wordless, imperious impulse urged him forward; and a question kept time to
  his stride:</p>

  <p>"Then were Homer, Virgil, and the ancients literally right? And the
  Bhagavad-Gita? Are there beings who guide and protect us Guardian angels? Did
  Joan of Arc really hear voices? What is a Master? Who ever saw one, and told,
  and got himself believed by anyone but yokels and nuts?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't you seen Lobsang Pun? With the physical eye&mdash;and with the
  inner eye&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"But he denied he's a Master!"</p>

  <p>"Jesus also denied it!&mdash;'Why callest thou me good?'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But dammit, this isn't Jesus&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who said he is?&mdash;How about you? In all your life have you ever
  originated one idea?"</p>

  <p>"How do you mean&mdash;originated?" Question and answer came and went like
  a tussle between counsel and witness&mdash;only that he knew the answer
  instantly when he asked each question; and, though the witness in his mind
  was Elsa, it wasn't she who spoke. That made sense, at the moment, unless he
  thought about it: then thought rebelled, and he saw only the nightmare
  procession of naked hermits, storm-lit, more incredible than &mdash;</p>

  <p>"But why incredible?" That wasn't Andrew's question. It was the witness
  turning on him. "Don't you believe your senses? Which part of it is true?
  &mdash;which untrue? Which is the dream? Which is Reality?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know all that argument. Descartes put it: 'Cogito, ergo sum:
  Because I think, therefore I am. I must be."</p>

  <p>"But you haven't answered the other question. You think. But does the
  thought originate with you?"</p>

  <p>He was on the defensive now. Why? Who put him there? He wanted to think
  about Elsa as a physical girl whom he loved. Thought wouldn't obey. What is
  physical? What is love? Were the two ideas compatible?</p>

  <p>"Can they cohabit, like man and woman?"</p>

  <p>Who asked that question? He was getting confused. Thoughts, ideas, can't
  cohabit. Ridiculous.</p>

  <p>"Don't they? Is thought never raped by propagandists? And what comes of
  that? What is conceived of it&mdash;gestates&mdash;gets born to suck the
  public teat and call itself survival of the fittest?"</p>

  <p>"Who's gloomy now! That isn't even pessimism. It's fear&mdash;lack of
  faith! How can you change that? How do you always change it?"</p>

  <p>"Poetry."</p>

  <p>"Try."</p>

  <p>" 'There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.' "</p>

  <p>"Where did that thought come from?"</p>

  <p>"Shakespeare."</p>

  <p>"Not from you."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"You didn't originate it?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Didn't Shakespeare say a poet's function is to reach to heaven for ideas
  and bring them down to earth?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He said that. 'The poet's eye is a fine frenzy rolling&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"So, did Shakespeare originate the ideas that his poems convey? Did Jesus
  originate the Sermon on the Mount&mdash;or did he, like Shakespeare, take an
  ancient theme and hold it up to be drenched with Idea, like dew from heaven?
  Where did Beethoven go to find his Fifth Symphony? When great poetry and
  great music inspire you, what is conceived, gestates and gets born of
  that?&mdash;The wrong thing or the right thing?&mdash;Do you act nobly, or
  contemptibly, when you have let Shakespeare's or Milton's vision illumine
  thought and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted, growing irritable: "Then am I a ventriloquist's dummy
  &mdash;parroting what's put into my mouth?&mdash;A mere marionette&mdash; one
  of the lumpen-proletariat who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Some people are. God pity those who misuse them. But you can choose,
  can't you, between noble and ignoble? You understand poetry and music love
  them&mdash;you can let them flow into your consciousness. What else stirred
  you to such undreamed of effort that you're here, in the wilds of Tibet
  &mdash;instead of where?"</p>

  <p>"Are you trying to link me with some kind of metaphysical chain to Old
  Ugly-face?"</p>

  <p>"Aren't we all linked to the sun, moon, stars? Isn't Lobsang Pun a poet?
  Like you&mdash;more so&mdash;more intelligently&mdash;doesn't he raise his
  consciousness to higher planes&mdash;and see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"See what?"</p>

  <p>"As from a masthead&mdash;past, present, future, all in one moment, seen
  from above, through the eyes of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Whose eyes?"</p>

  <p>"You answer it! Through whose eyes did you see at Gombaria's, and at Lung-
  gom-pa's, and in the cavern tonight?"</p>

  <p>"Damned if I know."</p>

  <p>"But you do know. Only you won't admit it. It's the denial that hurts.
  Obey prejudice, stay in the dark and drown in the subconscious ocean&mdash;
  all pain, frustration, hatred, forever and ever&mdash;nature red in tooth and
  claw&mdash;survival of the damned! But whoever becomes superconscious, sees
  as a shepherd who guards his flock&mdash;sees through the shepherd's eyes. If
  Lobsang Pun sees through his Master's eyes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who is his Master?"</p>

  <p>"Who is your Soul? Who are you? Who is it who sees dimensions that an
  artist's hand imprisons in the thing he carves? If someone&mdash;perhaps
  many&mdash;in the monastery also perceive the idea which Lobsang
  Pun&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Thunder, wind, hail reopened the battle. For a minute Andrew and Elsa
  clung to each other. Then the squall ceased as it began, suddenly. In the
  ensuing calm, without pausing to think, but conscious of unfinished thought
  that had verged on vision, Andrew said:</p>

  <p>"All right now. Go on talking."</p>

  <p>"But we haven't been talking."</p>

  <p>He pondered that a moment. "True. I guess we weren't. What were you
  thinking of?"</p>

  <p>"Andrew, I was praying I might love you so that love should be a mirror in
  which you'd see yourself reflected&mdash;you, as you really are&mdash; your
  Soul!"</p>

  <p>"Hell," he retorted, "I've seen me too often&mdash;Mind your step
  &mdash;here's a bad place&mdash;That squall cut a sluice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He held his flashlight for the Tibetans. The snow fell heavier than ever.
  It was near daybreak, but one couldn't have guessed it. The long column of
  hermits shimmered in and out of sight. Old Ugly-face, leading along the
  fanged edge of a ravine that snaked amid crashing landslides, used some
  abnormal faculty, like a deep-sea captain's in thick weather. He led
  unhesitating. There was one glimpse of Tom Grayne, away forward&mdash;then,
  by another lightning flash, Old Ugly-face turning to the hermits, waving his
  arms&mdash;and a glimpse of Tom returning as fast as he could run through the
  whirling snow. He was shouting, uselessly. He had to come close before Andrew
  could hear what he said:</p>

  <p>"Get 'em off the track! Hide! Monks are coming!"</p>

  <p>Then he ran back toward the head of the column, vanishing in darkness.
  Andrew didn't dare to use the flashlight. He looked for Bompo Tsering&mdash;
  couldn't find him&mdash;couldn't wait for him&mdash;got hold of the new man,
  Ga-pa-dug, shook him to put life in him, told him to help get the men out of
  sight. The man seemed to know he'd be killed if he hesitated. He got busy. A
  brigand by trade, he was an expert at quick getaways. The lightning flashed
  along a broken ledge that paralleled the trail a few feet lower. Andrew
  explored that, waiting for the lightning to photograph the handholds and the
  footholds in his mind's eye. Then he lay on the brink of the pitch-dark
  cauldron. Bompo Tsering came and helped, and they handed the men down one by
  one. In less than five minutes the last man reached the lower ledge and clung
  there with his head and hands below the level of the track. Elsa next. Andrew
  last, lingering, waiting for lightning, to watch the snow obliterate their
  tracks. They had to hang on or the wind would have whipped them away and
  blown them into the ravine. Andrew had to crouch. At his end of the ledge the
  narrow foothold was less than four feet below the track.</p>

  <p>Now and again the naked hermits were visible, flashed into view by forked
  lightning but screened from the trail by fantastic boulders split and tumbled
  in confusion from the cliff face. Old Ugly-face and Tom had guided the
  hermits to a crag. It resembled a storm-bound island. There, amid whirling
  snow, they perched&mdash;and many of them died for the lack of their draughty
  caves.</p>

  <p>Death came too close for anyone's comfort. A slip by anyone, and Andrew
  with Elsa and all his men, would have crashed to the rocks a thousand feet
  below. An outcry from one of the men, and there'd be five hundred armed monks
  to deal with&mdash;self-styled pacifists&mdash;killers, deadlier than
  brigands, because they had no humor&mdash;armed with Japanese repeating
  rifles, turned out into a Tibetan storm near daybreak to hunt not only
  foreign devils but an outlawed prelate of their own race with a huge cash
  reward on his head. Pacifists! Grim, determined, drilled believers in hell
  for heretics&mdash;trudging in close formation, two by two, depending on the
  storm to give them the advantage of surprise. They weren't even alert, there
  were no scouts in advance they were so sure of their quarry. Tramp
  &mdash;tramp&mdash;tramp&mdash;tramp&mdash;</p>

  <p>The right feet of the outside files passed so close to Andrew's head that
  in spite of the wind he could hear the crunch of the soft snow&mdash;the
  sound of their long coats against their naked legs&mdash;an occasional low
  voice. He had a good foothold; he wasn't in much danger of falling off; but
  he was afraid Elsa's hold might weaken. Cramp from the strained position
  might make him useless for a sudden emergency. The marching monks hadn't seen
  the hermits or they'd have turned to investigate. Andrew could see them by
  lightning flash. But he didn't dare to raise his head to get a glimpse of the
  monks&mdash;didn't dare, either, to try to pass the word along to the men to
  keep silent. One of them&mdash;he was one of the phony lama's men
  &mdash;slipped&mdash;fell&mdash;screamed&mdash;vanished. But the monks didn't
  hear him; or if they did, they thought it was the wind. But someone else did
  hear&mdash;guessed right&mdash;came trudging along by himself at the
  rear.</p>

  <p>Cramp, impatience, anxiety had almost exhausted Andrew's self-control. He
  was nearly positive that the last of the monks had gone by. He had tried to
  count them by their trudging; his estimate was more than four hundred and
  fifty men. He was about ready to raise his head cautiously above the level of
  the ledge when a man stopped within three feet of him and peered over. Andrew
  was too stiff to leap up at him. If the man should jump down, nothing could
  save both of them from death in the ravine below. Andrew couldn't shoot; he
  needed both hands to cling to the rock. The man couldn't see to shoot. He was
  waiting for the lightning. Andrew figured him out-guessed him&mdash;became
  quite sure he wasn't a monk; if he were he'd have cried the alarm. He
  couldn't be anyone else than St. Malo.</p>

  <p>But why didn't St. Malo give the alarm? He must have guessed what he had
  stumbled on. If he had agreed to sell Old Ugly-face to Ram-pa Yap-shi, here
  was his chance to deliver! His chance for revenge&mdash;for a fortune! Why
  didn't he shout? There could be only one reason: something must have gone
  wrong with St. Malo's plan.</p>

  <p>"Give me a hand up," said Andrew, suddenly.</p>

  <p>St. Malo jumped as if he were shot. Quick thinker though he normally was,
  it took him ten seconds to make up his mind. Then he knelt, stuck his toes in
  the snow and gave Andrew one hand. Andrew demanded the other, too, to make
  sure there was no weapon in it. As he scrambled up he clutched both hands in
  a grip that made St. Malo curse through clenched teeth&mdash;foul stuff.
  Andrew shoved him back against the cliff, to have the inside track in case
  more monks were coming.</p>

  <p>"Now! What's your game?"</p>

  <p>"I've important information."</p>

  <p>"Tell it!"</p>

  <p>"Where are Tom Grayne and Lobsang Pun? Where's Elsa? Where are your men?
  We've got to act quickly before those monks turn back. If they catch
  us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew seized his wrist and kicked his heel from under him, throwing him
  on his back</p>

  <p>"Now talk, quick!"</p>

  <p>"Deal me in then! Promise! If we can build a scaling ladder and climb the
  monastery wall&mdash;man, I've been in there&mdash;I can lead you straight to
  where they're keeping the young Dalai Lama! Once we've got him, we can
  threaten to kill him if they touch us! It's the only chance we've got for our
  lives!"</p>

  <p>"You're something less than a man," said Andrew. "I don't mind killing
  you.&mdash;Where have you been?"</p>

  <p>"I've been scouting!"</p>

  <p>"You've betrayed Lobsang Pun, and us, too! I'm going to kick you over the
  cliff, now, unless you tell what's happened! Last chance!"</p>

  <p>One kick landed on St. Malo's ribs. He yielded: "Well, all right, I'll
  tell! That's enough! Don't kick! I admit it&mdash;I did try to get the reward
  for delivering Lobsang Pun. But I was double-crossed. That dirty swine Ram-pa
  Yap-shi guessed where Lobsang Pun must be hidden. So he turned out all his
  fighting monks to go look for him. He turned me out after them&mdash;to be
  shot if I'd brought false information."</p>

  <p>"How did you escape from the monks?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't have to. They knew there was nothing for me but to follow them.
  Where else&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew didn't believe him. But why argue it? He went and reached down for
  Elsa&mdash;lifted her. One by one the Tibetans followed, stretching
  themselves, stamping and beating their hands. Then Tom came, running:</p>

  <p>"Get moving!" he shouted, breathless. "Lead the way! Old Ugly-face is
  saying prayers for dead hermits! He'll be too late if we don't force his
  hand!"</p>

  <p>Tom was gone again, into the dark. Andrew put Bompo Tsering and another in
  charge of St. Malo, and led, with Elsa's arm through his again. They didn't
  go far. At a bend where the ledge was fifty feet wide Old Ugly-face was
  marshaling all the hermits who hadn't died of cold. They were crowded between
  two huge dykes that projected from the face of the cliff like flying
  buttresses. It was safe to use flashlights there; a light couldn't be seen
  from up the trail or from the monastery, either, though they were now within
  four or five hundred yards of the monastery gate.</p>

  <p>Tom was in trouble. Old Ugly-face, with his back to the naked hermits, was
  unloading on him the vials of his reverend anger:</p>

  <p>"Your not having faith, not having nothing! Wanting everything, too soon,
  not knowing how!" There was plenty more of it, that was snatched away by the
  quarreling wind.</p>

  <p>He caught sight of Andrew&mdash;Elsa&mdash;St. Malo&mdash;the Tibetans. He
  shook the prayer wheel at them. Angrily he ordered lights out. Then, booming
  a Buddhist hymn, he set himself at the head of the hermits and resumed the
  march. Tom came up beside Andrew. Andrew asked:</p>

  <p>"What's the old bugger up to? Do you know now what his plan is?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not even sure he knows," Tom answered. "But if he can, he'll shake
  us. He'll leave us outside the gate. Tell Elsa to go forward and talk to
  him."</p>

  <p>Elsa didn't hear the suggestion. Andrew made no comment. Tom fell back for
  a moment's conference with Bompo Tsering. A moment later he was questioning
  St. Malo.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch60"
     id="ch60">CHAPTER 60</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It must have been two hours after daybreak, but the great
  monastery gate was invisible until it loomed through a murk of snow and they
  could touch it. A faint luminescence suggested the sun was somewhere on the
  right, but the monastery walls couldn't be seen. Tom and Andrew turned their
  flashlights on Old Ugly-face. With Elsa between them they forced their way
  through the hermits until they were within three or four paces of him. They
  had to shove hard; the hermits were stubborn and resented getting out of the
  way.</p>

  <p>That was how they lost sight of St. Malo; Andrew was counting on Bompo
  Tsering to attend to that job. Tom spoke without turning his head. He didn't
  want to meet Elsa's eyes; he was trying to be impersonal.</p>

  <p>"Our job is to beat the old man to it and be first to find the young Dalai
  Lama. We'll be out of luck if we don't. Once Old Ugly-face is on top, we'll
  be a liability."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't overlook his liabilities," said Elsa.</p>

  <p>Tom ignored that, although it stopped him for a moment. He spoke to Andrew
  again: "No shooting! No killing! Follow me, and keep close."</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face was busy talking to someone through a hole about four inches
  square in a narrow postern that was part of the big gate. The top of the gate
  was almost invisible; through the whirling murk there was a gray bulky
  something up there that was probably a fortified arch. Something belched
  flame and there was a deadened roar&mdash;not lightning&mdash;not thunder. An
  old-fashioned big-bored rifle had gone off like a cannon. The naked hermit
  next but one to Andrew fell dead; blood pumped and then flowed through a hole
  in his neck. Tom was all nerves; he exploded:</p>

  <p>"God! Now we're for it!"</p>

  <p>"This is how we get in!" said Andrew with grim confidence. "The Tibetan
  closed season for naked hermit shooting runs twelve months solid!"</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face pounced on the chance as if he had planned, or at least
  foreseen it. His passionate roar was like a lion's. He used the prayer wheel
  like a two-handed battle-axe and smashed it on the monastery gate. Some of
  the fluttering scraps of parchment fell into the hermit's blood. Bompo
  Tsering and the others scrambled for them. A great bell boomed behind the
  monastery wall, and set a hundred bells going&mdash;more than a hundred. Old
  Ugly-face turned to Tom and Andrew and ordered them to burn down the gate.
  "How does he think we'll do it?" Tom demanded.</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face was telling what to do, not how. His own wrath could have
  done it better than any implements they had. Andrew was about to break open a
  cartridge for its smokeless powder when the gate opened, to the squeal and
  clatter of winch and chain. They poured through, Old Ugly-face leading. He
  was in his element, a pilgrim on the path of glory, as iron-willed as the
  angel of judgment Day&mdash;followed by nine and thirty naked hermits
  &mdash;a novelty, even in Tibet. He never hesitated&mdash;not once, though
  there was nothing to be seen but falling snow. It was darker in there than
  outside.</p>

  <p>Andrew turned back to bring in the body of the dead hermit.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;why?" Elsa demanded.</p>

  <p>"Follow Old Ugly-face! Keep close to him!" he answered.</p>

  <p>Elsa obeyed. Tom hesitated, just inside the gate, shouting: "Come on, you
  idiot! This way!" Then Tom followed the procession.</p>

  <p>Andrew was keeping his head. He knew that corpses cut no ice in Tibet; but
  sacrilege does. The evidence of sacrilege might swing the balance between
  success and failure. He made four men carry the corpse and lay it inside the
  gate, in a drain, where he could find it later if needed.</p>

  <p>Tom came looking for him&mdash;furious. "God dammit, what are you waiting
  for! We've Ram-pa Yap-shi and twenty-five hundred monks to beat."</p>

  <p>"Where's Elsa?"</p>

  <p>"Gone with Old Ugly-face&mdash;I lost sight of 'em waiting for you!"</p>

  <p>Bells, bells, bells&mdash;booming and clanging like fire alarms. Shouts
  &mdash;hundreds of voices shouting to and fro from roofs and galleries. There
  was a weird suggestion of a fog-bound railroad junction. The watery sun burst
  through for a moment. It revealed shadowy figures ghosting through the snow
  across courtyards, running in all directions like ants in a broken hill.
  Lamplight shone through slits in stone walls, some being extinguished as fast
  as others were lighted. Panic. Never before in Tibet's history had one
  hermit, let alone nine and thirty, marched naked through a snowstorm behind a
  Ringding Gelong Lama to demand a monastery's purging of the sin of spiritual
  sloth. Old Ugly-face's broken prayer wheel was a symbol that stabbed the air
  with meanings that the monks understood; they knew their ritual; they were
  schooled in ceremonial and Tantric magic. Their souls shook within them.
  Hundreds of them bunched up their skirts and ran, bare-legged&mdash;ran
  anywhere&mdash;nowhere&mdash;from one building to another. Ancient guns went
  off at random, each one starting a new panic.</p>

  <p>It was like the fall of Babylon, only there was no royal banquet to
  interrupt. Old Ugly-face, guided by his own daemon, turned to the right. Tom
  recovered command of himself, shouted at Andrew, and led straight forward,
  guided by memory. Old Ugly-face was de facto Lord Regent of Tibet within
  fifteen minutes after that.</p>

  <p>The monastery could have lent itself, like a medieval city, to the worst
  kind of street fighting, but there was no one willing to fight. It was
  perched on the side of a mountain&mdash;all up and downhill on different
  levels. Courtyard led into courtyard through unlighted arches. Huge
  barrack-like buildings faced inward. At the rear, with its back to the
  mountain, was an enormous building like a keep, apron-fronted like the Potala
  at Lhasa. Cannon that once belonged to the Chinese Army peered through gaps
  in the wall. The sun was beginning to fight its way through. The storm was
  failing. Everything could be seen now, dimly, like a negative that is
  beginning to develop. Someone fired one of those old cannons. It burst
  &mdash;knocked down a ton of masonry&mdash;scared some monks so badly that
  they fled into the courtyard through a door that Tom might otherwise have
  missed. The main door was barred. Tom wrenched at it, but Andrew grabbed him
  and shoved him in the right direction. In a second they were using their
  fists on monks' ears to force their way past a stream of them that poured
  through that other door. It was like a theater panic. None knew what he was
  afraid of, but they ran&mdash;ran like rats.</p>

  <p>Tom remembered the way now. He led as if he had the ball on the twenty-
  yard line. Andrew and the Tibetans bucked the hurrying stream of monks and
  followed him up a huge stone stairway to an upper corridor. It was lighted by
  parchment covered lanterns.</p>

  <p>Then they remembered St. Malo, because they saw him. He was at the end of
  the corridor, standing beside the young Dalai Lama and the Lord Regent Ram-pa
  Yap-shi&mdash;their backs to a door&mdash;caught in the act of flight. Andrew
  gasped:</p>

  <p>"God, for a camera!"</p>

  <p>St. Malo heard that. "What you need is brains!" he retorted. "Did you
  bring 'em with you?" He had an automatic, stolen somewhere, somehow. He
  placed its muzzle against the Dalai Lama's neck&mdash;a young lad with a face
  like a porcelain doll's, clothed in embroidered red silk. The boy looked
  bleached by being too long indoors&mdash;placid, amused, contemplative,
  curious. Large, long-lashed Mongolian eyes. He seemed to like St. Malo.
  Surely he didn't suspect that his life trembled on St. Malo's trigger
  finger.</p>

  <p>The Lord Regent Ram-pa Yap-shi had been hit hard by someone. There was
  blood on his face. Punch-drunk, he stood six feet away from St. Malo, with a
  dozen monks behind him. The monks weren't eager to protect him; it might be
  one of them who had hit him; they were hesitating, telling each other what to
  do, and doing nothing. Ram-pa Yap-shi wasn't Chinese, but with his thin beard
  and horn-rimmed spectacles he looked it. He was wearing the gorgeous
  embroidered robes of a High Abbot. Barring the spectacles, he very closely
  resembled the painted figure on the wall beside him&mdash;a portrait of an
  ancient notoriously cruel king of Tibet, represented as a suppliant at the
  Seat of Judgment of the dead.</p>

  <p>There was tense silence for about two seconds. Then St. Malo delivered his
  ultimatum:</p>

  <p>"Now you two geniuses-quick! I've got the kid. I'll bring him. You shoot
  these monks! Grab the Abbot and run. I'll show you where to run to. We'll
  make our own terms!"</p>

  <p>It was no use doubting St. Malo. He meant business. As long as he had his
  hands on the holiest child on earth, no Tibetan would dare to touch him. He
  would shoot the child dead rather than surrender his advantage. But there was
  a chance yet.</p>

  <p>He interrupted a glance between Andrew and Tom. "I've warned you!" he said
  sharply.</p>

  <p>Andrew moved, sideways, toward a niche in the wall in which rested all
  kinds of religious objects, including a bronze dorje,* like an ornamental
  two-pound dumb-bell. Tom watched for an opening, not daring to draw his own
  weapon, but holding St. Malo's attention while Andrew lifted the bronze dorje
  from the shelf. He hurled it&mdash;hit St. Malo on the jaw&mdash; staggered
  him. St. Malo fired at Andrew&mdash;missed. Before he could fire again Tom's
  fist sent him staggering to the floor in a corner. Then Bompo Tsering shot
  him dead.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>dorje</i> (Tibetan)&mdash;a ritual scepter held in
  the right hand of a Lama while preforming religious ceremonies. As a sacred
  symbol of Tibetan Buddhism, the dorje represents the 'thunderbolt of
  enlightenment'; an abrupt change in human consciousness which is recognised
  by all the great religions as a pivotal episode in the lives of mystics and
  saints. <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorje">Wikipedia</a></i>.
  ]</p>

  <p>The boy lama laughed.</p>

  <p>It was a strange laugh&mdash;so unexpected that it almost stopped Andrew
  from searching St. Malo's pockets; but that was public duty number one that
  he didn't dare to leave entirely to Bompo Tsering. He found a thin wallet,
  containing what looked like the key to a code. It sounded as if the boy lama
  was laughing at that&mdash;merrily. Or was he laughing because he had never
  before seen a dead man? Or because Andrew let Bompo Tsering pocket St. Malo's
  money? Drawing blank in St. Malo's remaining pockets, Andrew looked up
  &mdash;saw delight in the boy's eyes&mdash;followed their gaze toward the end
  of the long corridor. Old Ugly-face's head and shoulders appeared, at floor
  level, like a bronze bust.</p>

  <p>He was ascending a curving stairway at the far end. The boy had recognized
  him; the laugh was spontaneous greeting; he hadn't turned his head even to
  glance at the shooting; he appeared unconscious of it&mdash;bright-eyed,
  pleased and relieved beyond words. Old Ugly-face as he mounted the stairs
  looked like a great hobgoblin with a hundred ghosts behind him. He had left
  all except one of the hermits somewhere; that one, wrapped now in a curtain
  snatched from a wall, strode beside Elsa&mdash;a bearded skeleton in a toga.
  The rest were monastery monks. Counter-revolution brooded on their stern
  faces. Reaction. Grim, unforgiving piety. As Old Ugly-face paused midway
  along the corridor, four monks overtook him, genuflected and then robed him
  is the vestments of high office, shaking incense on him. He was no longer a
  ragged pilgrim. His Holy Diplomatic Eminence the Ringding Gelong Lama Lobsang
  Pun no longer wore Andrew's blanket over a peasant's rags. He gave the
  blanket to the hermit. He stood arrayed in the embroidered yellow and crimson
  to which high rank entitled him. Then he went down on his knees and touched
  his forehead to the floor, doing reverence to the child who had laughed with
  delight when he first appeared. Elsa, close behind him, knelt beside the
  hermit.</p>

  <p>"You've lost her!" Tom murmured. "We've both lost her." He sounded
  ashamed.</p>

  <p>There wasn't one weapon in sight among the monks who followed Old Ugly-
  face. As they reached the corridor they, too, laid their foreheads on the
  floor. Rifles clattered as Bompo Tsering, Ga-pa-dug and the others followed
  suit. There was almost no other sound as Old Ugly-face moved slowly forward,
  giving the monks time to make their obeisance. The child lama blessed Old
  Ugly-face with a gesture of his right hand and a movement of his lips. Then
  he blessed Elsa, the hermit, the monks, Tom, Andrew. He beamed, exuded
  blessings. Andrew watched Ram-pa Yap-shi-gaunt, tall, high cheeked&mdash;
  something less than inscrutable. Tibetan&mdash;in-bred&mdash;autocrat
  &mdash;caught unaware&mdash;dazed. No Tibetan fears death. But pride fears
  humiliation, and the prouder the rogue, the worse he fears it. The paralysis
  of fear resembled dignity&mdash;almost&mdash;until one noticed his eyes.</p>

  <p>Breath steamed in the chill air. Outside, on roofs and in courtyards,
  there was a prodigious clamoring of bells. In the corridor, silence&mdash;
  almost like the silence of the painted Bodhisattvas on the wall. At last, Old
  Ugly-face made an imperious gesture. He made it with his left hand. Four
  monks advanced from behind. Ram-pa Yap-shi didn't move; nor did his
  attendants. The four monks unceremoniously disrobed Ram-pa Yap-shi. They took
  his rosary and jewels, and the rings from his fingers, but offered him no
  other indignity. They left him standing in a long black cassock, with bowed
  head, shivering a little because it was very cold in the corridor. Then Old
  Ugly-face moved both hands and the monks behind him opened a lane through
  their midst.</p>

  <p>Without a word being spoken, Ram-pa Yap-shi strode forward with folded
  arms. His attendants followed. Old Ugly-face did not get out of Ram-pa Yap-
  shi's way. He almost appeared not to see him; but as Ram-pa Yap-shi
  approached he made a very slight gesture with the fingers of his left hand.
  Ram-pa Yap-shi obeyed the gesture&mdash;passed left to left, instead of right
  to right. It signified condemnation, commination, excommunication and
  acceptance of defeat. Only an outcast, stripped of hope in this world and
  condemned to unimaginable ignominy in the next, would pass to the left of
  anyone or anything that symbolized a religious idea. Even Tom Grayne
  shuddered.</p>

  <p>The astonishing thing was the boy lama's behavior. He took it all
  unemotionally, as if it were part of a ritual. The impression was that he had
  been expecting this&mdash;knew it would happen&mdash;had foreseen it. Since
  that one peal of delighted recognition of Old Ugly-face he hadn't made a
  sound. He gazed chiefly at Elsa. She puzzled him. Since he was weaned he had
  been denied any association with women, even of his own race. But his gaze
  was as unselfconscious as a statue's&mdash;it suggested intelligent interest.
  Andrew stared at him without a thousandth of his manners, memorizing his
  features, for a portrait, to be carved before memory should have time to grow
  dim.</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face said something in Tibetan to a monk behind him. Two monks,
  one on either hand, strode forward and struck the double door, both together,
  with the palms of their right hands. One panel opened. The boy lama smiled,
  turned and led the way into his apartment. Old Ugly-face followed.</p>

  <p>There was a glimpse of a long carpet in a stone walled passage lined with
  paintings of saints on silk. Then the door closed behind them and a murmur
  went up, of monks whispering to one another, that filled the corridor. It
  suggested a waterfall in an echoing cavern.</p>

  <p>Elsa, Tom Grayne and Andrew stood facing one another for a moment, each
  waiting for the other to speak&mdash;until Andrew noticed blood flowing from
  St. Malo's body and began looking for something to cover it with. Front-rank
  monks guessed what he was looking for&mdash;whispered. Other monks came from
  the rear with a piece of carpet and covered the corpse contemptuously, as the
  attendants at a bull fight cover the gored dead horses.</p>

  <p>Andrew and Tom waited for Elsa to tell what had happened and was happening
  outside. Surely she must be bursting with news. But when she broke the
  strained silence she said:</p>

  <p>"Tom, only one of us may remain here with Lobsang Pun."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know it," he answered glumly. "You win."</p>

  <p>"He takes only one chela at a time. Never more. And only one who needs his
  help and whom he knows he can enlighten."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I've heard that of him."</p>

  <p>"I had asked him to accept me as his chela before I knew you intended to
  ask.&mdash;Tom-please believe me: if I had known you wanted it, I would never
  have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tom interrupted her: "If so, why did you return from India?"</p>

  <p>"Tom, to give you your freedom, face to face&mdash;no other reason! When I
  left Tibet for Darjeeling you never expected to see me again, did you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Tom answered. "I didn't suppose the baby would have a
  chance to live. I was surprised when you did come back. I thought we had
  parted good friends, and you'd see the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He hesitated. The monks were staring at them. Andrew was listening. Elsa's
  eyes looked straight at his. She seemed to be expecting something&mdash;
  almost praying for it. He yielded.</p>

  <p>"I'm ashamed," he said abruptly. "I tried, as you know, to learn your gift
  from you. The effort only exasperated both of us. All winter long I tried to
  learn it from the Tibetan who shared my hide-out. He said I'm unteachable. So
  I set my heart on Lobsang Pun. It made me jealous&mdash;envious&mdash;
  suspicious. I behaved like a cad."</p>

  <p>"Tom, then do we part good friends?"</p>

  <p>Andrew was about to speak, but the door opened and all the monks stopped
  whispering. The door closed again quietly behind Old Ugly-face. The monks
  genuflected. Old Ugly-face stared at Tom as if he hadn't seen him before
  &mdash;scowled&mdash;his eyes flashed with anger:</p>

  <p>"Your believing Jesus saying&mdash;asking being same as getting! Yes. But
  who asking? And who getting? My telling you, it is more blessed to give! His
  saying that also!"</p>

  <p>He took no notice of anyone else. The monks opened up and he passed down
  their midst as Ram-pa Yap-shi had done, but his head was unbowed and his
  hands weren't folded on his breast. The monks faced about and followed, so
  that the hermit came last. Tom shrugged his shoulders and followed the
  hermit. Andrew touched Elsa's arm. She met his eyes. He looked more troubled
  than she had ever seen him.</p>

  <p>"Andrew," she said, "Andrew, I have trusted you&mdash;through thick and
  thin. We are all on the verge of death. Will you trust me&mdash;this once
  &mdash;now?"</p>

  <p>"I must," he answered. "I have said: I love you."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Then for my sake, please keep your promise and stand by Tom
  Grayne, to the end.&mdash;Follow him now! No&mdash;this isn't the end
  &mdash;not yet."</p>

  <p>She slipped away from him, struck the door with the palm of her hand and
  vanished into the boy lama's apartment. The door closed behind her. A bolt
  clicked.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch61"
     id="ch61">CHAPTER 61</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The snowfall had ceased when Andrew overtook Tom in the
  courtyard. The sun was fighting its way through breaking clouds. Wind,
  whirling the snow off roofs and walls and piling up deep drifts under
  archways and cloisters, saved both their lives; monks, as ferocious as
  hornets, couldn't gee at them in sufficient numbers or quickly enough. They
  were able to dodge from cloister to cloister; they had to keep hiding,
  pausing, ducking behind columns and into doorways.</p>

  <p>Lusty-lunged bull-bellowers, instructed by Old Ugly-face's hermits, were
  hard at work proclaiming that Ram-pa Yap-shi's fall was due to sinful
  intrigue with foreigners. Lo and behold, the foreigners! Who should
  distinguish, in a crisis, between good and bad ones? Old Ugly-face had
  pitched on Tibet's xenophobia as the basis for his coup d'etat. He was
  playing it up. In the name of religion, the law, the prophets, and the higher
  spiritual beings to whom Tibet yearns for guidance, he denounced all foreign
  influences&mdash;at the top of his lungs&mdash;to the booming of gongs and
  the blare of the big radongs that sound like foghorns in a fog-bound sea.</p>

  <p>Part of a tile from a broken coping-stone missed Andrew by six inches; he
  reached for his automatic, but Tom restrained him. Old Ugly-face had seen it
  &mdash;he noticed everything&mdash;he snapped out a command. The nearest monk
  went running, jumping through snowdrifts with his skirts tucked into his
  girdle, to stop that foolishness. Presently a monk fell like a sprawling
  vulture from a roof&mdash;likely to throw no more tiles in this world.</p>

  <p>Scores of monks lay dead in the crimsoning snow. Grudges and private
  spites were being worked off&mdash;bitter monastic hatreds that had secretly
  boiled for the day of revenge. The arrogant bullies of Ram-pa Yap-shi's reign
  were pursued by the bullied, who were in haste to repay cruelty before the
  tide could turn.</p>

  <p>The tide was turning. Tom nudged Andrew, speechless, pointing southward.
  Retreat was cut off. Vengeance was on its way. Descending from level to level
  they had reached a platform where there was a clear view over the top of the
  outer wall. Already, the five hundred who had marched in darkness to plunder
  the cavern were on their way back; their advance guard was nearing the main
  gate. The commander and his aide were riding Tom's and Andrew's ponies and
  the yaks were loaded with the plunder from the cavern. The five hundred armed
  monks tramped behind the plunder in fours, in good marching order, nearly
  knee-deep in snow though the front ranks were. Tom snatched Andrew's
  binoculars&mdash;stared through them.</p>

  <p>"The leader's aide's a Jap! Now we are done for! He'll take charge and
  give us the works! Where's Elsa?"</p>

  <p>Instead of answering, Andrew asked: "Who timed these moves? Look! Who's
  that over the gate?"</p>

  <p>Tom focused the glasses carefully: "Looks like a Russian. His back's this
  way&mdash;but&mdash;he has a thick beard&mdash;might be German&mdash; good
  boots&mdash;fur hat&mdash;yes&mdash;looks like a Russian rifle. Might be
  either&mdash;Russian or German."</p>

  <p>Andrew reached for the glasses. "Let me look." After a moment: "He might
  be anything except Tibetan. Tibetans can't grow that kind of whiskers.
  &mdash;I bet you something&mdash;I bet he's St. Malo's Number One! I bet he's
  laying for the Jap! I bet he thinks he'll save his own stake now by killing
  the Jap! Watch!"</p>

  <p>Tom took the glasses again. The man on the footwalk above the main gate
  thrust his rifle through one of the embrasures in the arch, took aim and
  fired. The Jap fell from the saddle. He struggled a moment and lay still. The
  Tibetan leader of the column glanced up once at the gate, wheeled his pony
  and went galloping back past the loaded animals, throwing them into
  confusion. The man who had shot the Jap withdrew his rifle&mdash;by a
  heartbeat, by a breath too late.</p>

  <p>From the gate towers at either end of the footwalk Tibetans approached him
  &mdash;two men, who crouched like skilled hunters and moved with the agility
  of cats. Tom exploded:</p>

  <p>"By God, that's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew took the words from his lips: "It's Bompo Tsering and St. Malo's
  headman Ga-pa-dug!"</p>

  <p>Both Tibetans had firearms, but they couldn't use them for fear of
  shooting each other. They laid them down. They drew knives and closed on the
  man who had shot the Jap. He hadn't time to use his rifle. He screamed as the
  long blades plunged into him. His rifle fell to the ground, where a monk
  pounced on it. The Tibetans' knives had struck their victim so hard and deep
  under the ribs that he almost dragged them with him when at last he toppled
  backwards and fell in a shapeless heap near the postern door. He almost fell
  on the monk who had taken the rifle. The monk ran.</p>

  <p>Tom nudged Andrew, who resented being nudged:</p>

  <p>"Quick! Search him before the monks do it!"</p>

  <p>Andrew followed him down from level to level&mdash;past Old Ugly-face, who
  was haranguing and giving orders to crowds of monks&mdash;past naked and half
  naked hermits who were putting the fear of the lives to come into every monk
  they could get to listen. The hermits howled imprecations after them:</p>

  <p>"Foreigners! Devils!"</p>

  <p>But two monks detached themselves from Old Ugly-face's inner-guard and
  checked that foolishness. They screamed at the hermits. They followed Andrew
  and Tom to the gate, protecting them. They stood there whirling prayer
  wheels, watching for a signal from Old Ugly-face to tell them what to do
  next.</p>

  <p>There were more than twenty corpses near the main gate. The snow was
  blood-red and trodden to slush. Tom was stooping over the knifed mystery man
  to search his clothing and Andrew was standing guard, when Bompo Tsering
  burst out through the door at the foot of the gate tower:</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun!" he gasped. There was blood on his coat. He was panic stricken.
  "Gunnigun!"</p>

  <p>Andrew shook him. "Steady now. What's up? Say it slowly, one word at a
  time!"</p>

  <p>"Nobly born, my having killed Ga-pa-dug!"</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"In gate tower!"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"His telling me, my should killing you."</p>

  <p>"What for?"</p>

  <p>"Hot damn&mdash;then his and my being too rich. But my not shooting you!
  My dying sooner!"</p>

  <p>Andrew changed the subject. "What's through that door?"</p>

  <p>"Gatehouse. Stair. Machine&mdash;open-gate."</p>

  <p>"What else?"</p>

  <p>" 'Nother door. Shut tight."</p>

  <p>"Leading which way?"</p>

  <p>"Leading belong passage inside big wall&mdash;that way&mdash;wall all
  hollow." Tom came up, washing his hands with snow.</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing," he said. "Might be Russian or German. No documents
  &mdash;no identity mark.&mdash;We'd better find Elsa."</p>

  <p>"Elsa's all right. She has her orders from Old Ugly-face."</p>

  <p>"How do you know she's all right? Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"She asked me to trust her," said Andrew. "You do as you please."</p>

  <p>"When did she ask?"</p>

  <p>"Just now. Say&mdash;d'you notice how few firearms these monks
  have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Five hundred outside&mdash;on their way!" Tom answered.</p>

  <p>"But almost none inside!"</p>

  <p>Tom nodded, impatiently. "Ram-pa Yap-shi," he said, "disarmed all except
  the five hundred he thought he could count on. At one time, not long ago,
  there were three or four thousand rifles in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andrew interrupted: "Where are they now?" he pointed. "Are they in that
  big building where the six hermits are posted at the door?"</p>

  <p>Tom agreed. "Right! That's the main storehouse."</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face had posted six naked hermits at the only entrance to the
  storehouse, to prevent looting. No monks, no matter how they longed for
  firearms, dared to try to pass those hermits to force the door. Hermits are
  very holy. Eternities in hell are too much to pay for a rifle and
  ammunition.</p>

  <p>"God! If they do get at those rifles," said Tom, "there'll be a slaughter
  to beat Jesus. Listen to that, will you!"</p>

  <p>Rifle butts were thundering on the main gate. The five hundred outside
  were demanding admission. They were shouting. Some were firing their rifles.
  But that was a good sign; it meant lack of discipline. If their officers
  couldn't control them&mdash;</p>

  <p>"If Old Ugly-face hasn't a trick in reserve now, he's a goner," said Tom.
  "That means us too. So&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face did have a trick in reserve. He came chanting, followed by
  chanting monks, and stood facing the main gate, fifty feet back from it, on
  the pediment of an urn-shaped stupa that contained the ashes of a saint. Two
  hermits, each wrapped in a blanket, approached the postern, and stood one at
  each side of it. It was a narrow postern, almost in the middle of the gate
  &mdash;not room for more than one person to pass through at a time.</p>

  <p>Andrew and Tom stood back against the gatehouse wall. There was no shadow
  there, but they were less noticeable. Andrew whispered to Bompo Tsering to
  get his gang together and hold them ready for sudden orders. He had to
  threaten him to make him obey. A vulture landed above the gate and perched
  there, moving restlessly. Another dozen vultures soared out of the sky and
  perched on a roof ridge. The first vulture joined the others and they sat all
  in a row.</p>

  <p>Tom's nerves were ragged. Inaction fretted him. "God, what's the old man
  waiting for?"</p>

  <p>"You need food," said Andrew. "Here, eat this." He gave him chocolate. Tom
  munched it.</p>

  <p>Then they saw why Old Ugly-face was waiting. The number one hermit had
  reached the top of the wall, by the stairs in the righthand gatehouse. He was
  wearing Andrew's blanket, but not for warmth, he let it flutter in the wind.
  He was already talking to the monks outside and they had left off shouting.
  His voice had a weird carrying power, but Andrew couldn't understand him, and
  if Tom could distinguish the words he was too attentive to repeat them; he
  shook his head when Andrew asked what the hermit was saying. All the monks in
  the wide courtyard were spellbound, many of them open-mouthed&mdash;
  expectant&mdash;afraid. A door opened suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Christ! Who's timing this!" said Andrew.</p>

  <p>It was a door at the end of a lean&mdash;to shed that was evidently a
  covered passage for use in winter. It made a circuit around two sides of the
  courtyard, turning at right angles along an inner wall, toward a monastery
  building.</p>

  <p>Ram-pa Yap-shi came through the door, all alone. The door closed behind
  him and someone inside shot the bolt noisily. His hands were not tied, but he
  held them behind him as if they were. He walked with dignity toward the main
  gate but, while still ten feet away from it, turned and stood still. There
  was no sign of recognition between him and Old Ugly-face. Not a word was
  spoken. Less than an hour ago Ram-pa Yap-shi had gloated over the tortures
  prepared for Old Ugly-face. Now he awaited his own fate.</p>

  <p>"As calm as Christ!" said Tom. "God! What's going to happen now?"</p>

  <p>The hermit on the wall kept talking to the monks outside. Andrew and Tom
  both watched Old Ugly-face. A monk was whispering to Bompo Tsering. The two
  hermits at the postern waited for a signal from the one on the wall. Bompo
  Tsering shouted suddenly to Andrew and came running.</p>

  <p>"Hot damn! Gunnigun! Our letting only one man come in!"</p>

  <p>Andrew strode toward the postern and Tom followed. The hermit signaled
  from the wall. The hermits below opened the postern. Instantly a big monk
  with a bandolier over his chest barged through as if there were pressure
  behind him. He thrust his rifle muzzle at the hermit who stood in the way.
  Another monk followed; he, too, was being shoved from the rear. Tom
  spoke:</p>

  <p>"Now! Both together!"</p>

  <p>It was Andrew's fist that socked the third man who tried to get through.
  The man staggered back. Tom slammed and bolted the postern. He and Andrew
  stood with their backs to it. Old Ugly-face's lips moved, giving orders to a
  monk who stood beside him.</p>

  <p>The two armed monks who had forced their way in were bewildered. They had
  prodded a holy hermit and felt afraid. They couldn't make head or tail of
  things. They couldn't retreat. They had their rifles; but Tom and Andrew made
  no secret of having automatics, and, besides that, had the drop on them. So
  they didn't know what to do. They stood looking from Ram-pa Yap-shi to Old
  Ugly-face, and back again. Old Ugly-face spoke to a monk, and the monk came
  and said they might take Ram-pa Yap-shi away. He said more than that, but
  Andrew and Tom couldn't hear it. Ram-pa Yap-shi made no comment, but he
  turned his back toward Old Ugly-face. He was shivering a little&mdash;doing
  his best not to.</p>

  <p>The hermit on the wall began talking again to someone outside. The wind
  blew a sudden squall, clanging the roof bells and raising clouds of snow. The
  hermits opened the postern and Ram-pa Yap-shi walked out, followed by the two
  armed monks. Almost before the postern bolt slid home there was a ragged
  volley of rifle fire.</p>

  <p>Tom glanced at Andrew: "Well, he's got his. Quick! Merciful! We'll be
  lucky if nothing worse happens to us.&mdash;Where in God's name is Elsa?"</p>

  <p>Andrew snapped at him: "It's none of our God-damned business where she is!
  Her life's her own."</p>

  <p>He felt a sudden hunch that was like the pull of a magnet. He obeyed
  it.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" Tom demanded.</p>

  <p>"There are stairs in the gatehouse. When I've seen what's doing, I'll come
  back and let you know!"</p>

  <p>He opened the door of the gatehouse and closed it quietly behind him
  &mdash;bolted it. He intended to find Elsa. But he couldn't have told why he
  should look for her in the gate tower, nor why he bolted the door behind him.
  He just did it, feeling that he did right&mdash;feeling confident.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="ch62"
     id="ch62">CHAPTER 62</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was almost dark inside the gate tower. The machinery for
  opening the gate took up most of the space. Beside a bench for the use of the
  gate guard was the door of which Bompo Tsering had spoken. It was locked;
  Andrew tried to force it&mdash;kicked it&mdash;couldn't shake it.</p>

  <p>The narrow stairway followed the curve of the wall. There was no
  guardrail. The stairs were worn and loose. He went up them two at a time. At
  the top, a narrow door gave access to the footwalk above the main gate. The
  door was held open by the body of Ga-pa-dug that lay across the threshold in
  a pool of blood. Bompo Tsering hadn't taken the man's rifle. That was a
  mystery all its own. Andrew took it, unloaded it, tested the breech
  mechanism, reloaded it, and went out to the footwalk. Looking for Elsa? He
  couldn't have answered the question. He asked it of himself, but with no
  special emphasis. He had a more than vague feeling that he was doing the
  right thing.</p>

  <p>In the corner between tower and footwalk was an irregular masonry platform
  roughly eight feet square, protected from everything but wind by a pierced
  barbette. By standing well into the corner he could look down into the
  courtyard without being seen&mdash;and on the other hand, through the opening
  in the barbette, he could see the armed men outside. Inside, he could even
  see Tom Grayne, although Tom had his back to the gatehouse and was almost
  hidden by the bulge in the wall.</p>

  <p>First, he directed his attention outside. Ram-pa Yap-shi was not dead.
  Very much not dead. The ragged volley that had greeted him when he went out
  through the postern must have been a salute, or perhaps a display of emotion
  on the part of the armed monks. They didn't look much like soldiers&mdash;
  more like brigands. They had abandoned formation and were milling around him,
  most of them shouting; but the gusty wind carried away the uproar so that it
  only reached Andrew like the noise of surf on a distant beach. Ram-pa
  Yap-shi, in his long black robe, with his hands behind him, looked like a
  Catholic martyr about to be burned at the stake.</p>

  <p>Because of the wind it was impossible to tell what was going on. But Old
  Ugly-face knew; he was being kept posted. The hermit on the wall near the
  opposite gate tower&mdash;quite naked now&mdash;Andrew's blanket had blown
  away&mdash;was shouting at the top of his lungs, first to the monks outside,
  then relaying their answer, again at the top of his lungs, to another hermit
  below, who relayed it to Old Ugly-face at his post of authority on the broad
  pediment of the stupa.</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face was no longer standing. They had brought him a high-backed
  chair like a bishop's throne. Some of the monks who clustered around him had
  sent for their own official robes, so that it looked something like a court.
  There was dignity, color, organization. There was even a table, at which a
  secretary sat taking dictation from Old Ugly-face. It looked like a
  proscription list. If it was, it was good tactics. Numbers of monks were
  presenting themselves for registration on the "good" list before it was too
  late; they were kneeling in the snow, calling out their names and begging a
  benediction.</p>

  <p>Many more than a thousand monks had lined up in hollow square with their
  backs to the courtyard wall&mdash;perhaps obedient&mdash;perhaps not daring
  to come nearer. Andrew studied them. He thought they looked dangerous. All
  crowds are alike in that they all reveal their mood more distinctly than
  individuals do. Remembering crowds of strikers in Ohio, and Chinese dock
  laborers in Amoy and Shanghai, Andrew decided those monks were waiting to be
  swayed one way or the other by the turn of events. He wondered why Old Ugly-
  face didn't pay more attention to them&mdash;flatter them a little&mdash; win
  them over with some demagogic fireworks.</p>

  <p>But a strangely subtle mental change began to take place. He found he
  couldn't think of Old Ugly-face and failure in one and the same thought.
  There was a calm, unhurried feeling of exhilaration that existed entirely
  apart from events and things; and yet it controlled them, in a way not easy
  to define, but that filled experience, so that it was. There was no arguing
  it. The things&mdash;people&mdash;movements, that one saw, heard, felt, were
  the same and yet otherwise. There was a sensation of new reality. They were
  part of a pattern&mdash;not pawns, but intelligent agents, each fulfilling a
  destiny&mdash;moving intricately toward a predetermined future that could not
  possibly be avoided except in one way.</p>

  <p>He remembered Elsa's "subconsciousness, consciousness, superconsciousness"
  &mdash;"From&mdash;at&mdash;toward." A change of consciousness, and all
  things, events, beings, change their meaning, lose confusion and stand
  simplified in new perspective. Old Ugly-face, as Andrew then perceived it,
  was the conscious outlet through whom superconsciousness flowed, to which
  anyone might tune in within the limits of his spiritual stage of
  evolution.</p>

  <p>"I guess I'm a one-tube outfit," he reflected.</p>

  <p>He didn't wonder any longer that Elsa should have asked to be accepted as
  Old Ugly-face's chela. He could understand the relief to her of being
  recognized as an evolving spirit rather than being condemned, and self-
  condemned, as a freak unfit for confidence.</p>

  <p>God, how he loved her!&mdash;or was that selfishness? Was it his own
  craving to perceive with an inner eye&mdash;to see the ravishing beauty of
  new dimensions&mdash;as he did sometimes perceive, when Elsa, with her mystic
  companionship, lifted his thought upward?</p>

  <p>He felt Elsa's hand in his. It seemed part of the mystic moment. He didn't
  turn to look. He went on watching Ram-pa Yap-shi, realizing that he hadn't
  once ceased watching him. Timeless and measureless thought had filled his
  mind while Ram-pa Yap-shi spoke perhaps ten words&mdash;inaudible from where
  Andrew watched. The words were bitterness made visible&mdash;as scornful and
  cold as the wind. Ram-pa Yap-shi had refused something. But what?</p>

  <p>The hermit shouted from the wall. The message was relayed to Old Ugly-
  face. He spoke. Monks ran to do his bidding. Tom beckoned Bompo Tsering and
  the two of them were almost swept off their feet as they tried to line up
  their men in front of the main gate. Andrew decided to go down and lend a
  hand. He didn't want to; it meant losing a spiritual vision that he might
  never regain. He lingered one more moment, thinking of Elsa&mdash;until she
  tugged at his hand, and he turned. She was beside him, sheltered from the
  wind, between him and the gatehouse wall.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Two minutes&mdash;hours&mdash;days! Was it good? I was away
  up&mdash;from the moment when I took your hand until you turned."</p>

  <p>"So was I. But I must go down there now, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No. Don't. Watch from here. I know what will happen."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell later."</p>

  <p>He hugged her close to him and leaned, between her and the wind, against
  the barbette where they could see both sides of the wall.</p>

  <p>"Andrew," she said, "can you help Ram-pa Yap-shi? Can you reach him with a
  thought that may make him feel less lonely?"</p>

  <p>"I can fix him so he'd quit feeling at all," Andrew answered. "I've a
  rifle."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you ashamed?"</p>

  <p>"No. That's how I feel. He looks like Satan to me. If such a thing's
  possible, he's Old Ugly-face's opposite. Have you talked to the kid Lama?
  What does he think of him?"</p>

  <p>"He pities him."</p>

  <p>"That child? Kids of his age are pitiless."</p>

  <p>"Can a Dalai Lama&mdash;even only seven years old&mdash;return evil for
  evil?"</p>

  <p>"If he's such a prodigy of virtue, can't he use his virtue to
  prevent&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No. Watch."</p>

  <p>There was talk going on at the gate, through the hole in the postern.
  Outside, five hundred monks, noisily bullied by platoon commanders, were
  piling their rifles in fairly orderly stacks. Hermits opened the postern. It
  seemed a protocol had been arranged. The plundered baggage animals were led
  away to another gate. Tom and his Tibetans marched off to see the ponies
  safely stabled and the loads put under lock and key. Then, one by one, led by
  their commander, the disarmed monks filed in through the postern. One hermit
  took them in charge, striding like a mountaineer as he led them past Old
  Ugly-face to the door through which Ram-pa Yap-shi had walked alone. They
  saluted as they passed Old Ugly-face. He took no notice. Someone called out
  their names as they passed. The secretary's writing brush moved on the page
  &mdash;nemesis, writing. Andrew speculated: "To the dungeons"?</p>

  <p>"No. What has happened in this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are you psyching it?"</p>

  <p>"No. The Dalai Lama's personal attendant told me. First; Ram-pa Yap-shi
  was offered to those monks whom he armed and misled&mdash;to be their leader.
  They might take him and go wherever they pleased."</p>

  <p>"He got his answer," said Andrew.</p>

  <p>"After that, since his own would have none of him&mdash;and even Ram-pa
  Yap-shi knew that would happen&mdash;he knew that terrorists are always
  turned on by their favorites when failure sets in&mdash;he was offered two
  alternatives. They were both in accord with the Tibetan code of justice. He
  might claim hospitality&mdash;of the dungeons, in which he has tortured and
  starved his enemies. Or he may, of his own free will, earn merit."</p>

  <p>"What does that mean?"</p>

  <p>"Watch. Think kindly if you can!"</p>

  <p>"Damn him, I can't. He's a son of a bitch."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, we are going to see tragedy. He's as lonely as Judas. He needs
  pity!"</p>

  <p>"Well, okay then, God pity him! Now what?"</p>

  <p>Ram-pa Yap-shi had stood motionless until the last of his men had stacked
  their rifles and passed in through the postern. But now he moved, slowly,
  with bowed head, his back to the wind&mdash;like a man in a trance, except
  that he clearly knew where he was going, and deliberately forced himself to
  go. He walked between the piles of rifles and along the trampled track
  between banks of snow, until he reached the bend where the ledge began that
  skirted the thousand-foot deep ravine. He never paused once&mdash;never
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Bless him!" said Elsa. "Be kind to him, Andrew! There's nothing else we
  can do!" She didn't know it, but she was driving her fingernails into
  Andrew's wrist. "Try to love him, just one little bit! Love him! He's human!
  He's doing his best, at his world's end!"</p>

  <p>Ram-pa Yap-shi walked straight forward, knee-deep in the snow, instead of
  turning where the track curved eastward. Two vultures followed him. He
  reached a wind-blown crag that leaned out over the precipice, kept walking
  forward with his hands clasped behind him, trod on air&mdash;vanished. The
  vultures followed.</p>

  <p>"Good God!"</p>

  <p>Andrew didn't speak again for a moment. He hugged Elsa close to make sure
  she wasn't shaking from cold. From a roof, where the bells were ringing in
  the wind a radong like a foghorn, blared Ram-pa Yap-shi's requiem.</p>

  <p>"He took it standing," Andrew said then. "He didn't squeal."</p>

  <p>Elsa faced about. She met his eyes and put her hands on his shoulders.
  "Andrew! Do you realize what happened?"</p>

  <p>"No. I'm thinking. You tell it. It feels somehow loaded. I can't explain
  what I mean."</p>

  <p>"Andrew, it means this. Ram-pa Yap-shi acknowledged&mdash;to himself, and
  to his own soul, and to the world&mdash;that his sins misled thousands, who
  obeyed him through fear and ignorance. Disaster showed him the end of that
  road. So he chose death as the death of his own sin and theirs
  too&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Steady!" said Andrew. "Steady! If there's a hell, that's where he's gone!
  Sins like his, nor mine either, can't be wiped out in a moment."</p>

  <p>"No?" she said. "Do you remember the repentant Thief on the Cross? 'Today
  shalt thou be&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;? Lord God! You don't mean&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"'For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also
  forgive you:&mdash;Andrew, the Dalai Lama has asked for 'the big man they
  call Gunnigun.' He is waiting below. Will you come?"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch63"
     id="ch63">CHAPTER 63</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At the foot of the gatehouse stairs both doors were open,
  although Andrew had bolted one and the other was locked when he entered.
  There was a commotion outside. Old Ugly-face was coming&mdash;looking, Andrew
  thought, so physically tired that he was almost out on his feet; but so
  spiritually vigorous that no fatigue could conquer him. Andrew and Elsa stood
  back to let him pass, but at the threshold he waited for someone while the
  monks swarmed around him and had to be driven back by main force. It was only
  when he turned and faced them, raising his right hand, that they retreated to
  a decently respectful distance.</p>

  <p>Through the other door there appeared a long, dim passage, lighted with
  little brass butter lamps set in niches in the wall. Somewhere about fifty
  feet along the passage there appeared to be a chamber corresponding to a
  buttress that supported the main wall on the inside and formed the base for
  an enormous stupa. Several Tibetans dressed in silk robes stood facing the
  entrance to the chamber.</p>

  <p>"Where's the boy Lama?" Andrew whispered.</p>

  <p>Elsa nodded in the direction of the chamber: "Those are his
  attendants."</p>

  <p>One of the attendants, smiling at Elsa as he passed, came and spoke to Old
  Ugly-face, murmuring to him from behind. Old Ugly-face bowed his head in
  token of assent. The attendant returned, and presently the young Dalai Lama
  came walking alone, preceded by the attendant walking backwards and followed
  by four other servants, two by two, ten feet behind him.</p>

  <p>The boy was wearing the same gorgeously embroidered silk as when Andrew
  first saw him. He smiled wonderfully when he saw Elsa. With a gesture as
  spontaneous as the flash of delight in his eyes he clasped his hands, then
  spread his arms wide. In a moment, to the horror of his attendants, he was
  standing between Andrew and Elsa with his hands in theirs.</p>

  <p>"Gunnigun!" he laughed. "Gunnigun!"</p>

  <p>"Hello, feller!" said Andrew. "What's your name?"</p>

  <p>There was no time to answer. The clucking attendants tried to separate
  them. Old Ugly-face turned and reproved the attendants so savagely that they
  slunk back into the passage and tried to get out of his sight. Then Old Ugly-
  face went down on his weary knees and made obeisance to the child, whose
  guardian he had again become. The child blessed him with the unselfconscious
  gesture of an ancient of days. Then he took Elsa's and Andrew's hands again.
  Old Ugly-face stood up, unsmiling, unoffended, his gaze fixed on Andrew. He
  spoke in Tibetan, Elsa translating:</p>

  <p>"Because ye are three, who of your best have given&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"God's sake, where's Tom?" Andrew wondered.</p>

  <p>"And because your best has been acceptable to Destiny that serves His
  Holiness who clasps your hands in peace and good will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The boy Lama chuckled and squeezed hands. He seemed to know what was
  coming. Old Ugly-face spared him a reproving frown and continued:</p>

  <p>"Ask! What will you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Andrew. "It has been my great privilege to contribute my
  services. I would do it again. Your Eminence owes me nothing."</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face smiled. He thrust his hand into his bosom and produced the
  silk flag taken from St. Malo. He unfolded it and showed it to Andrew. But he
  gave it to Elsa. Then he spoke what he considered to be English:</p>

  <p>"Your country needing you. Your needing her. Damned old bugger, am I?"</p>

  <p>"Your servant," said Andrew. "My respects to you, sir."</p>

  <p>Old Ugly-face took Elsa's hand and put it into Andrew's. His lips moved
  for many seconds before he spoke aloud:</p>

  <p>"Her being my chela. My sending her forth. Your being her fellow pilgrim
  helping her give&mdash;My blessing you. Many, many million never failing
  blessings&mdash;finding wherever your being, always, always. Tum-Glain my
  keeping here&mdash;his needing too much." Then he spoke again, at length, in
  Tibetan to Elsa. She interpreted:</p>

  <p>"Andrew. Tom is waiting near the stupa. We are all to be blessed in public
  by the Infant Lama, so that the monks may understand that we're protected as
  long as we're in Tibet. When we've rested a couple of days we're to say
  good-bye. Tom will stay here; he begged it, and I begged it for him."</p>

  <p>"And you're coming with me?"</p>

  <p>The boy Lama took their hands again. Old Ugly-face turned and led, booming
  the mystic syllable that leads, like all true music, upward, universe by
  universe, to an infinity beyond eternity, whence pours all newness
  &mdash;</p>

  <p>"Aum-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m!"</p>
