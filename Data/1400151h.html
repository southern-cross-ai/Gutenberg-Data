  <br>

  <p class="blurb">IN the long record of sinister and evil men who make up the
  world's murderers, there are many duplications. In a dozen cases one sees the
  same motive, the same dominant ego, the same half-crazy reasoning, which
  induces otherwise sane people to commit the acts which bring them to the
  gallows. The unique criminal, unique in his method or in his circumstances,
  occurs at long intervals. Murders induced by jealousy are many; crimes based
  on vanity occur in considerable numbers. But seldom do we find a case
  resembling, and never a case parallel with, that of Frederick Henry Seddon,
  who, together with his wife, was tried in March, 1912, for the murder of
  Eliza Mary Barrow.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">SEDDON was essentially a business man, shrewd, near, a
  little unimaginative. He was the type sometimes met with in the train on the
  way to the City: a man of dogmatic opinions, a little over-bearing, wholly
  intolerant of other people's opinions. You could imagine Seddon holding rigid
  political views, and regarding all who did not share them as being outside
  the pale.</p>

  <p>Generally he was accounted, by those who knew him best, as a very
  excellent manager; a man who gave nothing away, and who was credited with
  considerable possessions, which his thrift and his gift for driving a hard
  bargain had accumulated for him.</p>

  <p>Seddon lived in a good-sized house at Tollington Park, North London, with
  his wife and five children. It was a fairly large house and his own property
  (as he often boasted), and here he carried on his profession of insurance
  agent, being superintendent of that district and having under his charge a
  number of collectors, who were kept very busy by their energetic taskmaster.
  Seddon was certainly a man bound to get on. In the interests of his business
  he worked day and night; he was indefatigable in his search for new "lives,"
  yet found time to indulge in certain social amenities, and was an officer of
  a very honourable society, where he was considerably respected.</p>

  <p>That Seddon was a true Freemason in the real sense of the word can be
  doubted. Men of his intelligence too often adopt Masonry as a means to an
  end, believing that fellowship with so many of the best intellects in a
  district gives them advantages in business. Nevertheless, it was his ambition
  to rise to the supreme heights of Masonry, and all his spare time was given
  to the assiduous study of the craft and to fitting himself for higher office
  than that which he at present held.</p>

  <p>A mean, hectoring man, bombastic of speech, loud of voice, that crushed
  all opposition, his business grew rapidly, but not so fast as he could wish.
  The dominant passion of Seddon's life was money. Not every miser is a
  recluse, who hides his bags of gold in inaccessible places and shrinks from
  the society of his fellow-men. There are some, who are to be met with in
  every sphere of commercial activity, well-groomed misers who are not to be
  suspected of their vice, and Seddon was one of these. He worshipped money for
  money's sake. He never spent a farthing that he could avoid. His household
  accounts were most minutely examined day by day, and the money he doled out
  for household expenses was the smallest sum he could in decency offer to his
  unfortunate wife.</p>

  <p>Seddon's dreams had a golden hue. The rich were very wonderful in his
  eyes, and he would find his recreation in relating to his friends his
  surprising knowledge of the wealth which was possessed by the great figures
  of the financial world.</p>

  <p>He had saved penny by penny, pound by pound, gradually piling up his
  assets painfully and slowly. Never once had a large amount come to him in one
  sum, and one of his bitterest complaints was that he had no rich relations
  who were likely to die and leave him a fortune. Not the least interesting
  item of the newspapers was the paragraph which appears every day under the
  heading "Latest Wills," and he would pore over this in the evenings.
  Sometimes he would learn of a rich man or woman who had died intestate, the
  money going to the Crown, and this would throw him into a fury.</p>

  <p>"All that money wasted! Thrown into the gutter! It is criminal!"</p>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE was in London, though of her existence Seddon was
  ignorant for some time, a middle-aged woman who shared Seddon's peculiar
  passion for money. She, however, had never had to scrape and strive. She had
  been left a small fortune in the shape of house property&mdash;at least it
  was a small fortune to her&mdash;which brought her in £5 or £6 a week. She
  was as mean as Seddon, parting with every penny with the greatest reluctance,
  and worshipping money, even as he did, for money's sake.</p>

  <p>It follows that she was a difficult tenant to any landlady who gave her
  accommodation, and she shifted her lodgings very frequently, taking with her
  the small boy whom she had adopted, Ernie Grant.</p>

  <p>In his restless search for people whom he could persuade to take out
  insurance policies, Seddon came into contact with this middle-aged spinster,
  Miss Eliza Barrow, and these two sharp-minded beings recognised in one
  another kindred souls. Seddon's immediate interest in the woman was a purely
  business one, but he had ever an eye to the main chance, and it had been his
  practice to leave no avenue to fortune unexplored.</p>

  <p><a id="pic2"

  <div align="center">

  </div><br>

  <p>"Friends should pay dividends," was one of his mottoes; and there is
  little doubt, after he had discovered that Miss Barrow was not a likely
  subject for insurance, that he turned over in his mind a way by which this
  new acquaintance should "pay dividends." Miss Barrow's complaint against
  landladies was perennial. Her interest in life was confined by the walls of
  the lodgings she had, and it may be imagined that they had not long met
  before she was telling him of her various landladies' enormities, the high
  cost of living, the peculations of lodging-house servants, and the difficulty
  of finding a home where these causes for distress would be more or less
  non-existent.</p>

  <p>Seddon was a quick thinker. He had a big house in Tollington Park, and
  several of the upper rooms were unoccupied. This woman could pay dividends in
  the shape of rent, and in many other ways was a desirable tenant, for he had
  learnt of her house property and her steady income, and there was no fear
  that she would come to him on a Monday morning and bring excuses instead of
  money. So Seddon patted the little boy on the head with easy benevolence, and
  remembered his empty rooms.</p>

  <p>"I think my rooms would suit you very well," he said. "We live very
  quietly; you will be in the house of a successful business man who may be
  able to help you from time to time in the matter of advice, and I'll arrange
  it so that you live more cheaply with me than you have been living
  heretofore."</p>

  <p>The arrangement was most welcome to the woman, who was in the throes of
  one of her periodical fits of resentment against her landlady.</p>

  <p>She had lived in many homes. Once she had stayed with her cousin, Mr.
  Frank Ernest Vonderahe, but that arrangement had not been satisfactory, and
  she had wandered off with her boy to yet another lodging.</p>

  <p>Life at Tollington Park was entirely to Miss Barrow's satisfaction. She
  had the opportunity of talking business with Seddon; he admitted her to his
  confidence, allowed her to be present when he was handling the large sums of
  money which came in from the collectors&mdash;a sight very precious to Miss
  Barrow, who, in spite of her possessions, had probably not seen so much gold
  before. And the knowledge that he was trusted with such huge sums increased
  her confidence in him; so that she brought her own financial difficulties to
  him (the cost of repairs, tenants' demands and the like), and accepted his
  advice on all matters concerning her estate.</p>

  <p>The friendship grew to a stage probably beyond her anticipations. Her
  confidence came to be a blind trust in his integrity and prescience. It
  developed, as was subsequently discovered, in her taking the rash step of
  purchasing an annuity upon his advice.</p>

  <p>It is certain that Frederick Henry Seddon saw in Eliza Barrow a greater
  profit than the meagre sums he obtained by giving her lodging. There was
  about him the additional flavour of deep religious principles. Seddon had a
  reputation as a lay preacher and public orator. He was fluent of speech,
  better educated than most men of his class, and he could be, in his lighter
  moments, a most entertaining and charming man. He charmed Eliza Barrow to
  this end, that one day he induced her to sell her Indian stock for £1,600, to
  get rid of her house property and to trust him with the money. She was
  obviously confident, from his manner to her adopted child, that the boy would
  lose nothing from being left in Seddon's charge, for she made no provision
  whatever for his future until a few days before her death.</p>

  <p>Seddon had gone to work deliberately, with a set plan, and the first part
  of his scheme having been brought to a successful issue, nothing remained but
  to perpetrate the dreadful deed which he may have contemplated from the very
  moment he had obtained Miss Barrow's confidence.</p>

  <p>Since no poisoner has ever confessed his method, it is only possible to
  reconstruct the story of such a murder by an understanding of the murderer's
  mentality, and by piecing together such scraps of evidence as are
  available.</p>

  <p>Seddon probably purchased a small quantity of arsenic in some part of
  London in which he was unknown. But he was shrewd enough to prepare, at the
  same time, a defence for himself. He purchased a number of
  fly-papers&mdash;paper impregnated with arsenic, which, when placed in a wet
  saucer, destroys any fly which lights upon it&mdash;and several of these he
  placed in Miss Barrow's bedroom.</p>

  <p>He knew, for he had made a study of poison trials, that one of the
  questions which decides the guilt or innocence of any person accused of
  poisoning, is the accessibility of the poison: in other words, whether it is
  possible, through accident or design, for poison to be self-administered.</p>

  <p>The only way that arsenic could be self-administered by a demented or
  careless woman was to have strong solutions of arsenic in her bedroom. He did
  not apparently realise that, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred where a
  person is found poisoned, the police look for a motive, and find one in a
  case where a person who had the opportunity of administering the poison
  directly benefits by the death.</p>

  <p>"Seddon always thinks of everything," said an admiring colleague. "That is
  why he has been so successful."</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly Seddon thought of most of the possibilities, but never dreamt
  that his cunning plan would be exposed.</p>

  <p>In many ways Miss Barrow was most favourably placed from his point of
  view. She had quarrelled with her relations, and those very distant
  relations. She had no personal friends, and beyond the Vonderahes, who came
  occasionally to see her, and were received with marked coldness, no
  interfering individual who would inquire too closely into her sudden
  demise.</p>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">THE Seddon's family were on very good terms with their
  lodger. Maggie Seddon and her mother did the cooking for her. Seddon himself
  was seldom in her room. When she became ill, only on one occasion did Seddon
  give Miss Barrow her medicine. A doctor was called in, saw nothing
  suspicious, identified Miss Barrow's symptoms with a natural derangement; and
  if he was surprised when one day he was summoned to find the unfortunate lady
  <i>in extremis</i>, it was one of those surprises which are the normal
  experience of every medical practitioner, and he did not hesitate to give a
  certificate stating that her death was due to natural causes.</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"

  <img src="1400151h-images/Seddons-03.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Three days before her death, Seddon persuaded Miss Barrow to make a will
  leaving all that she possessed to Ernest and Hilda Grant, appointing Seddon
  the sole executor. Again we see the cleverness oi the move; for now Seddon
  had so arranged matters that suspicion would be even more remote from
  himself. He had no possible interest in her death (unless the
  secretly-arranged sale of the annuity came to light), and such sums of money
  and property which had been Miss Barrow's as would be left he might use until
  the children came of age.</p>

  <p>Miss Barrow died on the Thursday, and no sooner was the breath out of her
  body than Seddon bustled off to interview an undertaker, and arranged for the
  cheapest possible funeral. Not only did he do this, but he made a gruesome
  bargain with the man which gives us an interesting insight into his mastering
  desire to save money at every opportunity. Seddon told the undertaker that an
  old lady had died in his house, and it would have to be an inexpensive
  funeral. He had found four pounds ten in the room, he said, and that would
  not only have to defray the funeral expenses, but find the fees due to the
  doctor. Thereupon the undertaker bargained to carry out the funeral at an
  inclusive price of three pounds seven and sixpence and allowed Seddon a small
  commission on the transaction. Seddon had memorial cards printed, with an
  appropriate verse of sorrow; he bought a quantity of black-edged envelopes
  and paper, and wrote a number of letters, which, however, were never
  delivered or posted.</p>

  <p>No man could have taken greater precautions than did Seddon to clear
  himself of any suspicion that he was implicated in the death of this wretched
  lady. Miss Barrow died on the Thursday, and on the Saturday was buried in a
  common grave, although there was a family vault, about which Seddon could not
  have been ignorant. He was, however, anxious to get the body underground with
  the least possible delay, for, once buried, he knew that there would be
  considerable difficulty in getting an exhumation.</p>

  <p>Although not on specially good terms, Miss Barrow had been in the habit of
  calling on the Vonderahes, and the fact that she had not appeared, and that
  they had seen nothing either of her or the boy, was remarked upon by Mrs.
  Vonderahe.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand why we have not seen Miss Barrow for so long," she
  said to her husband. "Why don't you walk round to Tollington Park and see how
  she is getting on?"</p>

  <p>Ernest Vonderahe, who was not particularly interested in his cousin, was
  nevertheless a dutiful relative, and on the Wednesday evening strolled over
  to Tollington Park. The door was opened by Seddon's general servant, Mary
  Chater, who stared at him blankly.</p>

  <p>"I've come to see how Miss Barrow is getting on. Is she well?"</p>

  <p>The girl gasped.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you heard?" she demanded in amazement. "Miss Barrow is dead and
  buried&mdash;didn't you know?"</p>

  <p>Vonderahe could only stare at her.</p>

  <p>"Dead and buried?" he said incredulously. "When did she die?"</p>

  <p>"Last Thursday."</p>

  <p>"But this is only Wednesday!"</p>

  <p>"She was buried on Saturday," said the maid.</p>

  <p>"Can I see Mr. Seddon?"</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He's out, and won't be back for an hour," she said.</p>

  <p>Staggered by this startling news, Vonderahe went back and saw his wife. At
  his suggestion, she dressed, and they went back again to Tollington Park,
  arriving about nine o'clock in the evening. This time they saw Maggie Seddon,
  the daughter, but Seddon was not visible.</p>

  <p>"Father has gone to the Finsbury Park Empire and won't be back till very
  late," she said, and could give them little or no information about Miss
  Barrow's illness, nor did they think it worth while to question the
  child.</p>

  <p>The Vonderahes went home and a family council was summoned, consisting of
  Vonderahe and his brother, with their wives, and they discussed the
  mysterious suddenness of Miss Barrow's illness until far into the night,
  arriving at the decision that the two women should interview Seddon the next
  morning and discover more about the circumstances of the woman's death.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, the next morning the two wives went to Tollington Park, and
  the door was again opened by Maggie Seddon. Apparently they were expected,
  for they were shown immediately into the dining-room. The visitors were kept
  for some time before the insurance superintendent and his wife made their
  appearance. He was his usual self, calm, confident, neatly dressed and in
  every respect self- possessed. But his wife displayed the greatest
  nervousness, and, throughout the interview which followed, was on the point
  of breaking down.</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"
     name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><img src="1400151h-images/Seddons-04.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Seddon strode into the apartment, pulled out a watch (which proved to be
  the property of the late Miss Barrow), looked at it significantly, and
  remarked in a loud tone that he hadn't much time to spare and he hoped that
  they would be brief. And then, when his wife began to speak, he silenced her
  firmly but kindly.</p>

  <p>"Now, my dear, you're too much upset to be able to tell anything," he
  said, and explained that his wife had been greatly shocked by the death of
  the lodger and had not yet recovered. "You sit there and don't upset
  yourself. I can tell these ladies all they wish to know."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Seddon may have had a suspicion that all was not well. The manner of
  Miss Barrow's death, the haste of the funeral, may have seemed to her
  suspicious things.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Seddon briskly, "just tell me who you are, and what relation
  you are to the deceased Miss Barrow" And, when he was told, he handed them a
  copy of a letter written to Vonderahe, which the latter had not received.</p>

  <p>The letter was brief and to the effect that Miss Barrow was dead. It
  invited them to the funeral which had taken place on the previous Saturday.
  It added that, a few days before her death. Miss Barrow had left a will in
  which she gave "what she died possessed of" to Hilda and Ernest Grant, and
  appointed Seddon as sole executor.</p>

  <p>Apparently Seddon had everything prepared: the copy of the letter, a
  funeral card, a copy of the will, and a large blank envelope into which he
  put these documents and handed them to one of the ladies present.</p>

  <p>So far, in spite of the brusqueness of the man&mdash;his callous
  indifference to the feelings of Miss Barrow's relatives and the scarcely
  veiled antagonism he showed to these inquirers&mdash;there was nothing
  suspicious beyond his manner; and it is probable that, had Seddon been more
  conciliatory, expressed a little more sorrow, and stage-managed that
  interview a little more deftly, he might have escaped the consequence of his
  villainy.</p>

        style="float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>As it was, he again looked at his watch pointedly, and when one of the
  ladies asked if he would see Mr. Ernest Vonderahe he shrugged his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am a business man, and I think I've wasted quite enough time on this
  matter," he said. "I really can't be bothered answering questions put by
  inquisitive people."</p>

  <p>These two ladies had gone to Tollington Park with the misguided idea that,
  because of their relationship, they would be asked to take possession of Miss
  Barrow's effects. If the will were genuine, and her death had occurred under
  normal circumstances, they could not, of course, touch a single article
  without permission from the executor; and legally, Seddon's position was
  unassailable.</p>

  <p>But in their ignorance of the law, they expected to be given certain of
  Miss Barrow's goods. Their real suspicions began when they found that,
  justifiably, Seddon meant to retain in his possession all the property the
  administration of which had been specifically left to him. It was only when
  they found that they were being sent empty-handed away from Tollington Park
  that they began to regard Seddon's behaviour as suspicious; and his ignorance
  of their psychology was responsible for his undoing.</p>

  <p>It was not till some weeks later, on October 0th, after many family
  councils, that Mr. Ernest Vonderahe saw Seddon. The insurance agent had gone
  to Southend for a holiday, feeling, he said "a little under the weather." And
  that period gave Ernest Vonderahe an opportunity of making closer inquiries
  into the possessions of Miss Barrow when she died. He discovered something
  about her investments; she was the landlady of a public-house called the
  "Buck's Head," and the proprietress of a barber's shop adjoining the
  public-house; had a considerable sum of money in the bank, and at the time of
  her death had quite a large sum in ready cash.</p>

  <p>Whether the relatives of Miss Barrow were chiefly concerned with the
  manner of her death, or whether they suffered under an indignant sense of
  being robbed of that which was rightfully theirs, we need not inquire. All
  the investigations which went on were in the direction of ascertaining the
  exact amount of benefit Seddon might have received from the woman's
  disappearance. It was a very proper and natural line of investigation, to
  which no exception could be taken. It is perfectly certain that, supposing
  the will to be genuine&mdash;and this was not disputed&mdash;whatever might
  be the result of their inquiries, they themselves could not be benefited by a
  single penny through the exposure of Seddon as a murderer.</p>

  <p>The Vonderahes saw something of one of the "beneficiaries" under the will.
  Little Ernie Grant came to see them, but was invariably accompanied by one of
  Seddon's children, either the girl or the boy, and the suspicions of the
  Vonderahes were deepened, because they saw, in this chaperonage, an attempt
  to prevent them questioning the child as to the manner of Miss Barrow's
  death.</p>

  <p>On Seddon's return from Southend, Vonderahe decided to call upon him, and
  sent him a message to that effect. And the visitor was accompanied by a
  friend "as witness." Seddon had no illusions as to the antagonism of the
  deceased woman's cousin. He had heard something more than the subterranean
  rumbling which was to precede the cataclysm, and his line of
  preparation&mdash;to meet the unspoken charges which he knew Vonderahe would
  have in mind&mdash;took the shape of adopting towards his inquisitor a lofty
  and high-handed manner, which had served him so successfully in dealing with
  other disagreeable people in his business.</p>

  <p>Like all poisoners, Seddon was completely satisfied of his own
  invincibility. He was as confident as Armstrong had been up to the day of his
  death. He could even challenge still greater antagonism by attempting to cow
  his inquisitive visitors into submission to his point of view. Vonderahe and
  his friend were in the parlour, cooling their heels, for twenty minutes
  before Seddon and his wife came into the room.</p>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">"MR. Frank Ernest Vonderahe?" asked Seddon, and, when the
  relative had answered in the affirmative, Seddon spoke to the second of the
  men, under the impression that Vonderahe's companion was his brother.</p>

  <p>Seddon was smoking a large cigar, and motioned his visitors to chairs with
  a lordly air.</p>

  <p>"Now what is all this about?" he asked. "You are under the impression that
  some money is due to you from the estate of Miss Barrow? The will is
  perfectly clear, and I don't see why I should give you any further
  information. If your solicitor cares to see my solicitor, all very well and
  good."</p>

  <p>In spite of this high-handed proceeding, Ernest Vonderahe began to
  question the man.</p>

  <p>"Who is now the owner of the 'Buck's Head'?" he asked, referring to one of
  the properties which had been Miss Barrow's.</p>

  <p>"I am," said Seddon quickly, "and the barber's shop next door is also
  mine. I've bought the property&mdash;in fact, I am always open to buy
  property if it shows any chance of a reasonable return. This house is mine,
  and I have a number of other properties. That is my private business: I buy
  and sell whenever a bargain is offered."</p>

  <p>The propriety of Seddon's purchasing properties of which he was the
  executor for his own benefit, did not seem to have occurred to either of the
  two men, and Ernest Vonderahe shifted his inquiries to a complaint that his
  relative had been buried in a common grave, when there was a handsome family
  vault at Highgate available.</p>

  <p>Seddon replied that he thought the vault was full up, though this excuse
  might have been invented on the spur of the moment. The "Buck's Head" and the
  barber's shop had, he declared, been bought in the open market. It was his
  business to dispose of the property, and as his bids were higher than any
  others, there was nothing remarkable about it being knocked down to him. When
  they pressed their inquiries, Seddon said (I am quoting the statement of
  Ernest Vonderahe):</p>

  <p>"That is for the proper authorities to find out. I am perfectly willing to
  meet any solicitor. I am prepared to spend a thousand pounds to prove that
  all I have done in regard to Miss Barrow is perfectly in order."</p>

  <p>Until this interview, according to the evidence which was subsequently
  offered at the trial of Seddon, the inquiries and the suspicions had been
  confined to the narrow circle of the Vonderahes and their intimate friends.
  But after this point-blank refusal of Seddon to discuss the affairs of the
  dead woman, and when it seemed that no useful purpose would be served by
  further interviews, the Vonderahes did what they should have done in the
  first place&mdash;communicated their suspicions to the police.</p>

  <p>Such communications are not rare at Scotland Yard, and the police
  authorities act with the greatest circumspection before they take any drastic
  action to confirm the suspicions of relatives. There are probably twenty
  complaints to every exhumation; possibly the number is much larger. But the
  police, in this case, had something else to work upon than the bald
  suspicions of the Vonderahes. There was, in the first place, the hasty
  burial, and, in the second, the fact that, as executor or direct beneficiary,
  Seddon had obtained a number of effects which were the property of the
  deceased woman and which were now under his control. The doctor was
  interviewed by the police and, strengthened by his evidence, the Home Office
  made an order for the exhumation of the body.</p>

  <p>These forces were at work all unknown to Seddon, who went about his daily
  business, satisfied in his mind that, if he had not allayed the doubts in the
  mind of Ernest Vonderahe, he had at least so baffled him, by his bold
  challenge to put the matter into his solicitor's hands, that no further
  trouble need be anticipated.</p>

  <p>Removed to the cemetery mortuary, the body was examined by Drs. Wilcox and
  Spilsbury, now Sir William Wilcox and Sir Bernard Spilsbury, the Home Office
  pathologists. Certain organs were removed and forwarded for analysis, and the
  body was reinterred.</p>

  <p>It was a grim coincidence that Seddon's business took him to St. Mary's
  Hospital at the time when Miss Barrow's remains were undergoing chemical
  examination, and that he was shown over a portion of the laboratory whilst
  that examination was in progress!</p>

  <p>The chemist's report to the Home Office was emphatic: a very large
  quantity of arsenic had been found in the remains, and on this report the
  Home Office ordered an inquest.</p>

  <p>Seddon was working at his accounts one night, when his daughter came to
  tell him that a policeman wanted to see him.</p>

  <p>"A policeman?" said Seddon. "What does he want? Ask him to come in."</p>

  <p>The officer walked into the room, helmet in hand, and handed him a
  paper.</p>

  <p>"I am the coroner's officer," he said, "and this is a summons for you to
  attend an inquest on the body of Eliza Barrow, which will be held to-
  morrow."</p>

  <p>Not a muscle of Seddon's face moved. Eliza Barrow! Until that moment he
  had not known that an exhumation order had been made. This was his first
  intimation that the net was closing round him.</p>

  <p>When the officer had departed, Seddon swept aside the work on which he had
  been engaged, and sat down, coolly and calmly, to work throughout the night,
  packing his wife and children off to bed, whilst he prepared answers to such
  questions as might be put to him.</p>

  <p>The grey dawn of a November day found him haggard and drawn, his table
  littered with papers covered with his clerkly writing. He had prepared for
  every possible contingency; had an answer for every question which might
  possibly be put to him; had checked and compared answer with answer, so that
  his story should be logical and convincing.</p>

  <p>The inquest lasted for the greater part of a fortnight. And now suspicion
  became certainty. Seddon's conduct, tested and probed, did not react, as he
  had hoped, to his advantage. On December 4th he was arrested on the charge of
  murdering Eliza Barrow.</p>

    luncheon interval just before the dismissal of his appeal.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>For more than a month, while he was nder arrest, his wife was allowed her
  freedom. But as the law officers examined more closely the evidence
  available, it was obvious that Scddon's wife was also under suspicion; and,
  to the amazement and idignation of the murderer, she was arrested on January
  15th, 1912.</p>

  <p>Seddon plied the detectives with questions as to the nature of the poison,
  and as to whether it might not have been self-dministered. "It was not
  carbolic acid, was it?" he asked. "There was some in her room. Have you found
  arsenic in the body?"</p>

  <p>All Seddon's transactions with the deceased woman now came into the light
  of day, and, incidentally, the motive for the murder. Miss Barrow had
  converted a considerable amount of her shares, of which she possessed some
  £1,600 worth, into cash, and purchased from Seddon an annuity of some £155
  per annum. Whilst she lived, he had to pay her £3 5s. a week, and it was to
  save this paltry sum, in the belief that she would live many years, that
  Seddon had murdered her. The transaction in itself was not unusual. Seddon,
  as an insurance superintendent, dealt in annuities, but this time the
  transaction was carried out for his own benefit. The will, therefore, leaving
  everything she possessed to Ernie and Hilda Grant, was a hollow document
  which meant nothing, since her only possessions at the time of her death were
  the cash she had at her bank and her own personal possessions.</p>

  <p>The trial, which began at the Old Bailey in March, 1912, before Mr.
  Justice Bucknill, excited general interest. The Attorney-General, Sir Rufus
  Isaacs, now Viceroy of India, appeared for the prosecution; Sir Marshall
  Hall, then Mr. Marshall Hall, defended the man; whilst Mr. Rentoul, now Judge
  Rentoul, defended Mrs. Seddon.</p>

  <p>Throughout the trial, Seddon kept up that unemotional detached attitude
  which he had shown from the very moment of his arrest. Mrs. Seddon, on the
  other hand, was a sad and dejected figure. She could indulge in none of the
  breezy exchanges which Seddon had with his counsel, nor could she regard with
  equanimity a visit to the witness-box, which Seddon welcomed rather than
  otherwise.</p>

        title="Illustration">

  <p>Seddon depended upon the fact that no person had seen him administer
  poison to the deceased woman. And this, as has already been pointed out, is
  the basis of confidence in the case of every man or woman charged with murder
  by poison. It was as though he put into words the attitude of such men:</p>

  <p>"I am willing to admit that the woman died of poison. I admit that I
  benefited considerably by her death, but you cannot prove that I gave her the
  poison. I may have brought food to her, and unless the prosecution can,
  beyond all possible doubt, prove that poison was in that food, and placed
  there by me, you must return a verdict of Not Guilty."</p>

  <p>Never in the history of criminal jurisprudence has there been a case where
  a convicted poisoner has been detected in the act of administering poison,
  either in food or otherwise. The poisoner banks upon suspicion being equally
  attached to other persons than himself, and thus securing the benefit of the
  doubt. Seddon's confidence was fated to receive a terrible shock. After an
  hour's deliberation the jury returned with a verdict of "Guilty" against
  Seddon, and "Not Guilty" against Mrs. Seddon. Seddon bent over and kissed his
  wife; in another minute they were separated, never to see one another again
  except through the intervening bars.</p>

  <p>The Clerk of Arraigns put the usual question: "What have you to say that
  the Court should not give you judgment to die according to law?" And then
  occurred the most dramatic and, to many people in the court, the most painful
  incident of the trial. Seddon stood stifily erect and began a long speech
  which declared his innocence. He ended by making a Masonic sign which was
  unmistakable to Mr. Justice Bucknill, himself a Freemason: "I declare before
  the Great Architect of the Universe that I am not guilty, my lord." The judge
  was visibly distressed, but, recovering himself instantly, passed sentence of
  death, and Seddon paid the penalty for his crime at Pentonville Gaol on April
  18th, 1912.</p>
