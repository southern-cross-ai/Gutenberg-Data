  <h2><a id="ch01"
     name="ch01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mount Lodge, Kensington, bore every outward sign of
  respectability. It stood detached in its own grounds, a solid, sedate,
  dignified mansion, discreetly withdrawn from the road, with a massive portico
  over its front door and a massive iron gate in its high surrounding wall.</p>

  <p>A relic, obviously, of the austere days of hansom cabs and chaperones,
  when no lady rode on the top of an omnibus, and the glimpse of a well-shaped
  ankle would set a young man writing poetry, it gave an impression of rigid
  conventionality and seemed to stand frowning with heavy disapproval at an age
  of cocktails and night clubs, in which it declined to take part.</p>

  <p>On the gate, as a protest against the vulgar intrusions of modern life,
  was a small metal plaque bearing the words, "No Hawkers, No Circulars." Monty
  Carr, who rented the place from a landlord who regarded as a godsend any
  tenant willing to relieve him of the rates and had not even troubled to take
  up Monty's unimpeachable references, once remarked that, had there been the
  least likelihood of the addition proving effective, he would have added the
  words, "No Police."</p>

  <p>Not that the police had ever betrayed interest in Mount Lodge. If the
  constable on whose beat it lay had been asked what he knew of the house, he
  would have replied that it was just an ordinary residence, and continued with
  the more serious business of noting the numbers of the cars which had
  overstayed their two hours' welcome in the neighbouring park&mdash;an
  attitude of mind which Monty Carr considered to be a tribute to his skill and
  discretion. For there was little that was ordinary about Mount Lodge,</p>

  <p>The only room patronized by Louis Creet was on the ground floor, on the
  left of the hall&mdash;a fact which, had the police ever made a tour of
  inspection of the house, must have redounded to his credit in some degree and
  would possibly have saved him from anything more serious than a fine.</p>

  <p>In Room A, as it was called, on any night they might have chosen for their
  visit, the police, provided they had evaded the complicated system of alarm
  signals devised by the ingenious brain of Monty Carr, and had effected their
  entrance unannounced, would have come upon a picturesque scene: a spacious,
  lofty room, with heavy curtains drawn close across the windows and a thick
  pile carpet that caressed the feet; in darkness save for a patch of
  brilliance beneath a shaded electric light that hung low over the table; a
  haze of tobacco smoke; in the dimness that fringed the pool of light, the
  shadowy outlines of men and women seated around the table&mdash;white
  shirt-fronts and ivory shoulders; and, on the green cloth, ashtrays, glasses,
  a dainty wisp of handkerchief, a scattering of cards, little heaps of
  brightly coloured counters, a woman's shapely arm, a man's hand with restless
  fingers.</p>

  <p>It was here that on one occasion a certain subaltern of the Guards, owing
  to the utterly unexpected behaviour of the ace of clubs, tossed a four-figure
  check across the table to Monty Carr and two minutes later, on the steps of
  Mount Lodge, placed the muzzle of a service revolver against the roof of his
  mouth and pressed the trigger. This inconsiderate action on the part of an
  officer and a gentleman had annoyed Monty Carr, for it was only with the
  greatest difficulty that the affair had been hushed up. Prudence, moreover,
  had demanded that the four-figure check should not be presented for
  payment.</p>

  <p>Comparatively, however, Room A was a place of innocent amusement. Mount
  Lodge had other rooms. Since the night when, in one of the rooms upstairs,
  some puritanical young woman had started screaming, a powerful
  radio-gramophone had been installed in the hall, and the butler had
  instructions to set it going whenever occasion arose. It was set going quite
  frequently. Louis Creet, when he heard it, would glance at Monty Carr and
  give a queer sort of smile.</p>

  <p>Tonight the radio-gramophone was silent, but none the less, as Monty Carr
  slipped a card from the pack and turned it face upwards on the table in front
  of Jacqueline Thurston, Louis gave a quick glance in Monty's direction. It
  was scarcely perceptible; his eyes just shifted for an instant to Monty and
  then returned to Jacqueline's face.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline, as she saw that the card dealt to her was the ace of diamonds,
  could scarcely restrain the exclamation that rose to her lips. The colour
  rushed to her cheeks, and her eyes grew suddenly bright with excitement.
  Novice as she was compared with the other players around the table, she had
  learned enough from her few previous visits to the room with Louis Creet to
  realize the significance of that ace of diamonds. The ace of clubs and the
  ace of spades had already been dealt to other players, and there was only one
  card left in the pack&mdash;the ace of hearts&mdash;which could beat hers.
  Jacqueline had no idea what the chances were against Monty turning up the ace
  of hearts, but she knew that the probability of his doing so was so remote
  that it need not seriously be considered.</p>

  <p>"Ace of diamonds, Jacqueline," remarked Monty, and glanced enquiringly
  towards her.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline's mind was in a turmoil, and she sat staring at the card,
  uncomfortably conscious of silence in the room and of the dozens of eyes
  watching her. A chance like this might never come again as long as she lived,
  and if she staked her usual £100. But that would be idiotic. The others had
  backed their aces for £300, and their chances had been nothing like as good
  as hers; and what, if she won, would be the use of a pound to her? It would
  help her out of none of her troubles. If she missed a chance like this she
  didn't deserve to be helped. If only she dared... enough to clear up
  everything and put her straight...</p>

  <p>"No limit tonight, Jacqueline," came Monty's voice. "Any stake you like.
  I'm here to be shot at."</p>

  <p>The girl glanced up and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Monty," she said, in a voice which she hardly recognized as her
  own. "I&mdash;I'll make it&mdash;a thousand."</p>

  <p>Monty Carr's impassive face relaxed into a faint smile. But Jacqueline did
  not see it; her whole attention was riveted on his slender white fingers as,
  steady and unhurried, they balanced his cigarette on the edge of an ashtray
  and moved towards the pack of cards in front of him.</p>

  <p>She was making a tremendous effort to appear calm. She had seen others win
  and lose far more than a thousand pounds without the flicker of an eyelid,
  and had realized that in Room A the least display of emotion was considered
  not quite good form. She did her utmost not to fall below the Room A
  standard; but Louis Creet, watching her closely, noted the whitened knuckles
  of her hand as it rested on the table, and the pulse throbbing in her
  neck.</p>

  <p>With a deft flick, Monty Carr slipped the top card from the pack, and as
  it fell face upwards on the table, it seemed to Jacqueline for one
  suffocating moment that all the blood in her veins went suddenly surging to
  her heart and as suddenly drained away again&mdash;to pound against her
  temples, pulsate in her throat, and cloud her eyes so that all she could see
  was a blurred vision of the card which lay exposed in front of her. Monty
  Carr had turned up the ace of hearts.</p>

  <p>She sat rigid, her mind in a panic, conscious that critical eyes were
  watching her as she stared at the blurred red pip of the card, not daring to
  turn her gaze from it and meet the glance of Monty Carr across the table.
  Once she did that, she would have to say something to him, and she had no
  idea what she could say.</p>

  <p>"Hard luck, Jacqueline," came Carr's voice</p>

  <p>She looked across at him. With the hint of a smile on his thin lips he was
  coolly shuffling the cards. Jacqueline forced herself to smile "Beginner's
  luck won't hold forever," she laughed. That's a thousand I owe you, Monty.
  I'll send you a check, may I?"</p>

  <p>One of Monty Carr's eyebrows just perceptibly rose, but he nodded, and
  began to deal the cards again Jacqueline pushed back her chair and rose</p>

  <p>"Miss me, Monty," she said. "I'm through for tonight. Louis is going to
  take me home."</p>

  <p>Louis Creet rose and followed her from the room and a few minutes later
  they were seated together in his limousine as it purred along Kensington High
  Street. Jacqueline was silent, gazing, with puckered forehead, at the back of
  the chauffeur's head, and nervously drumming her knee with her fingers. It
  was Louis's voice, smooth and soothing as the purr of the engine, that broke
  the silence.</p>

  <p>"I must congratulate you, Jacqueline," he said "It was magnificent. You
  took it with a nonchalance worthy of a hardened gambler. It takes a very
  hardened gambler to smile, as you did, over the loss of a thousand
  pounds.</p>

  <p>The girl glanced at him.</p>

  <p>"If it had been a thousand pence, Louis, I probably shouldn't have smiled.
  But a thousand pounds&mdash;" she shrugged. "I can't pay, so why worry?"</p>

  <p>Louis raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Can't pay?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I can't; and Monty won't expect me to pay. He knew the bet
  wasn't serious. He took it as a joke."</p>

  <p>Creet pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>"If I were you, Jacqueline," he said, "I wouldn't count too much on
  Monty's sense of humour."</p>

  <p>She looked round at him quickly.</p>

  <p>"You don't think that Monty might really expect&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear girl," interrupted Louis, "I'm afraid you don't appreciate the
  position. You seem to imagine, with charming feminine inconsequence, that you
  can contract a debt of honour, and then, if it is inconvenient to pay, airily
  dismiss it as a joke. But visitors to Mount Lodge don't indulge in that sort
  of joke. If they lose, they pay; if they win, they expect to be paid. Monty
  Carr will expect to be paid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A thousand pounds?" She laughed. "Monty knows as well as you do that I
  couldn't write a check for ten."</p>

  <p>Louis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You visited Mount Lodge as my guest, and Monty would assume that you
  would meet your obligations. I don't relish the idea of a guest of mine
  taking her winnings and shirking her losses."</p>

  <p>"Louis, you're being poisonous."</p>

  <p>"Only frank, my dear. If you'd won a thousand from Monty you'd have
  expected him to pay, wouldn't you?"</p>

  <p>She gave a little shrug.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," she admitted, and stared again at the chauffeur's head.
  Then she turned suddenly to her companion and laid a hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Louis," she said, "I've been every sort of a fool."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"Losing a thousand makes us all feel like that, Jacqueline&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I didn't mean that particularly," she interrupted. "I've made a hash
  of things all round lately, and I'm not feeling desperately in love with
  myself I haven't done a single thing during the last six months that has
  really been worth doing. I've just fooled around with a crowd of wasters and
  never given a thought to anything but chasing after some new thrill and being
  just a bit more stupidly up-to-the-moment than anyone else. But somehow
  nothing has seemed to matter since&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused and shrugged her shapely shoulders.</p>

  <p>"The fact is, I'm up to my neck in debt, and I'm scared. Fooling around as
  I've been doing costs money, and I've borrowed and run up bills, and things
  can't go on. But it's all right, Louis; I'm not going to sob my heart out on
  your shoulder. Give me a cigarette and talk of something pleasant."</p>

  <p>Creet produced his case.</p>

  <p>"And if luck had been with you tonight," he said, "the thousand pounds
  would have put you right. Was that the idea?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Something had to be done," she said. "Things really are pretty
  septic&mdash;I owe nearly three hundred&mdash;and messing about on the Stock
  Exchange has only made matters worse. I was crazy with worry tonight, and
  when Monty dealt me that ace I suddenly saw daylight. It looked like an act
  of Providence. With three aces out there was practically no chance of Monty
  turning up the fourth."</p>

  <p>"And as he did so, you propose to pretend that the whole thing was a joke
  and back out of paying? It won't do, Jacqueline," he said decisively. "You
  must at least make some effort to pay him. You owe me that much
  consideration. Perhaps, after all, the simplest way out of the trouble would
  be to make a clean breast of everything to Dr. Thurston. Your father would be
  the first to say that a debt of this kind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She turned to him quickly.</p>

  <p>"Father must know nothing about it," she said sharply. "I've got into the
  mess, and it's up to me to get out of it."</p>

  <p>"It isn't a very pleasant task, I admit," said Creet. "But if you feel you
  can't face it, I should be quite willing to explain matters to your father
  for you. In fact, if you refuse to tell him and can suggest no reasonable
  alternative, I'm inclined to think it will be my duty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Father is not to know," interrupted Jacqueline, with sudden vehemence.
  "He has no idea what sort of a rotter I've been making of myself lately, and
  I don't intend that he shall know. It's not cowardice; it's because it would
  hurt him abominably, and he doesn't deserve to be hurt like that. Besides,
  you don't suppose he has a thousand pounds to give to Monty, do you?"</p>

  <p>"In a case like this, when the honour of his daughter is concerned, any
  man would do his utmost to pay the debt. I don't profess to know anything of
  your father's financial position, but I don't imagine the payment of a
  thousand pounds would reduce him to penury."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You can cut Father right out of it, Louis," she said. "He hasn't got a
  thousand pounds in the world. He's had a pretty rough time lately. He was
  saying yesterday that he was far better off as an ordinary G.P., curing
  measles and whooping cough, than he is as a specialist in Harley Street. He
  never knows now where the next five pounds is coming from. I don't care
  particularly what Monty thinks of me, but I do care what Father thinks, and I
  don't intend to let him and Mother suffer because I've been an idiot."</p>

  <p>"All very noble and dutiful, Jacqueline," said Louis, "but unfortunately
  it doesn't help. Unless you can suggest some other means of finding the
  money, I must, in justice to myself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you dare to breathe a word to Father or Mother, I'll never forgive
  you." She laid a hand on his sleeve and glanced at him with pleading eyes.
  "Louis, promise me&mdash;please!" she begged. "They're both such dears, and
  they think so much of me, and they've had a dreadfully thin time lately, and
  I simply can't let them down. And I won't let you down, either. If Monty
  really expects me to pay, I'll manage it somehow. Leave it at that, Louis,
  will you?"</p>

  <p>He laid a hand on hers.</p>

  <p>"Very well, my dear," he said. "Since it means so much to you, I'll leave
  it at that."</p>

  <p>She squeezed his arm gratefully.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Louis&mdash;and I won't let you down," she said again. "I'll fix
  things with Monty somehow." She smiled faintly. "And if I can't possibly pay
  him, you needn't worry. I'll make it quite clear to him that Louis Creet is
  an honourable man."</p>

  <p>As the car pulled up outside a large block of flats she glanced out of the
  window and turned to Louis.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were taking me home?"</p>

  <p>He smiled as he opened the door and got out.</p>

  <p>"Stimson is going to mix you one of his famous cocktails," he laughed,
  "and you're going to inspect my bachelor quarters, as you've so often
  promised to do. I'll take you home afterwards."</p>

  <p>He saw her hesitation and smiled again.</p>

  <p>"The proprieties?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's rather late&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Louis Creet is an honourable man," he laughed, and with a shrug she got
  out of the car and followed him towards the lift.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch02"
     name="ch02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">During the two years of Louis Creet's progress from the
  position of her father's wealthiest patient to that of a trusted friend of
  the family, though she had been almost everywhere with him, from such
  innocuous amusement as is found at the Zoological Gardens to the somewhat
  less innocent entertainment provided at Mount Lodge, Jacqueline Thurston had
  never visited his flat; and now, when Stimson had relieved her of her cloak,
  she glanced curiously round the room into which Louis led her.</p>

  <p>"If you will excuse me, Jacqueline," he said, "I've a phone call to make.
  Stimson will mix you a drink."</p>

  <p>The girl nodded, seated herself in a corner of the big settee by the fire,
  and, when the manservant had supplied the cocktail, continued her inspection
  of the room. She had a theory that a room was always a true reflection of the
  character of its occupant; but it puzzled her to reconcile Louis and this
  apartment.</p>

  <p>It was large and lofty, with windows in two walls; the corners were
  rounded, and the walls merged into the ceiling in graceful curves. The
  windows were uncurtained and shuttered; the floor of highly polished parquet
  was bare of even a rug, and the mahogany furniture, though obviously
  expensive, was of the plainest design without a trace of ornament. Jacqueline
  decided that it might well be the room of an austere but wealthy ascetic. She
  had never thought much about Louis Creet, but that description did not seem
  to fit him. She could not decide whether she liked the room or hated it.</p>

  <p>The few ornaments that were in it&mdash;some pieces of choice porcelain
  and a couple of exquisitely carved ivories&mdash;she certainly liked. They
  struck her as a flat contradiction of her theory of an austere ascetic, as
  did the low, luxurious couch on which she was sitting, and the alabaster
  statuette on the mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>It was the figure of a dancing girl, undraped, a beautiful example of the
  sculptor's art. Jacqueline picked it up, gazed at it thoughtfully, and
  suddenly replaced it. She searched for the right word to describe it and
  could not find it. But emphatically she did not like it.</p>

  <p>Louis came in and paused at the door, gazing at her.</p>

  <p>"The riddle is solved," he laughed. "I've always felt, Jacqueline, that
  this room just fell short of perfection, but I could never decide what it
  lacked. Now I know. It needed the presence of a beautiful woman."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline shook her head.</p>

  <p>"What it needs more than anything else," she laughed, "is curtains and a
  few cushions and a rug or two on the floor. At present it's rather
  like&mdash;well, a hospital ward."</p>

  <p>With a smile he crossed the room and seated himself beside her.</p>

  <p>"A hospital ward has the advantage of being hygienic, my dear," he said.
  "Rounded corners and no rugs or curtains are a fad of mine. Corners and rugs
  and curtains mean dust, and dust means germs. You can't be too careful."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline smiled. She remembered now. It was common knowledge that Louis
  Creet was convinced that space was packed with innumerable millions of deadly
  bacteria intent on inhabiting his person. There was a drawer in his desk
  stocked with every conceivable drug calculated to discourage their invasion.
  She knew that he was constantly swallowing tablets from a small silver box
  which he carried in his waistcoat pocket, and that regularly once a week he
  made an appointment with her father to undergo a thorough medical overhaul,
  and as regularly telephoned to say that he was perfectly well and the
  examination would be waste of time. "A bit of a hypochondriac" was how she
  had heard her father describe him; but she had never suspected a room with
  rounded corners and uncarpeted floor. Now she understood: it was nervousness
  rather than austere taste that accounted for its bareness, and the figure of
  the dancing girl might not be so incongruous after all.</p>

  <p>"I've just been on the phone to Monty Carr," announced Louis. "I'm afraid
  it's a case of paying up and looking pleasant. Monty took the bet quite
  seriously and is expecting your check in the morning. I'm afraid, Jacqueline,
  that unless you can find some way of settling with him he is quite capable of
  making himself a nuisance. He'd probably consider himself justified in
  approaching your father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But, Louis, he mustn't&mdash;you mustn't allow him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can hardly hope to prevent him, my dear. But we will hope it won't come
  to that. Perhaps if we put our heads together we can find some way to set
  matters right. I might possibly be of some use myself."</p>

  <p>She glanced at him sharply.</p>

  <p>"You?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you've heard what they say about me, Jacqueline? I know. They
  say it's easier to extract a back tooth from a shark's jaw than five pounds
  from Louis Creet's pocket. But I don't think I've lived up to that reputation
  as far as you are concerned."</p>

  <p>"You haven't," replied the girl promptly. "You've given me a splendid
  time, Louis, for the last eighteen months&mdash;taken me everywhere, bought
  me goodness knows what, and I'm terribly grateful. But a thousand pounds...
  frankly, I can't see you parting with a thousand pounds for
  nothing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly she stopped. She had realized in a flash what sort of return
  Louis would expect for his thousand pounds, and her heart beat a little
  faster. As she stared into the fire, avoiding his gaze, the image of the
  dancing figure on the mantelpiece came before her eyes, and she understood
  what it was that had always prompted her, when Louis had pressed her to visit
  his flat, to evade the invitation.</p>

  <p>"Don't you realize, Jacqueline," said Louis, his voice low and caressing,
  "that you're a very beautiful woman?"</p>

  <p>She raised her head and looked at him. Until this moment, though she had
  known him for two years, she had never really looked at Louis Creet. She had
  a general impression of him as a well-dressed, well-groomed man, who was
  always an agreeable companion and had an abundance of time and money which he
  seemed to like to devote to her amusement, but that was all. She had accepted
  him as a friend of the family, a kind of adopted uncle, and had never
  troubled to ask herself what he was really like.</p>

  <p>Now for the first time she looked at him critically and appraisingly, and
  discerned a Louis Creet utterly different from her careless conception of
  him. For the first time she realized, with something of a shock, that he must
  be nearer fifty than forty, and that his eyes were restless and elusive. She
  noticed their heavy lids and the pouches beneath them. She saw that his lips
  were too loose, his hands too plump and white and faultlessly manicured, and
  his feet absurdly small. She saw now nothing incongruous in the presence of
  the dancing figure in Louis Creet's room. "Wanton," she realized, was the
  word which had eluded her.</p>

  <p>"Very beautiful," repeated Louis, and caressing fingers touched her bare
  arm.</p>

  <p>She drew back sharply.</p>

  <p>"Louis&mdash;please! I&mdash;I don't understand."</p>

  <p>He smiled, and his hand slid round her, drawing her towards him</p>

  <p>"Innocent little Jackie!" he murmured. "I tell her she is
  beautiful&mdash;the most beautiful woman in the world&mdash;and she pretends
  not to understand!"</p>

  <p>She freed herself and sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Louis, why&mdash;why are you saying all this to me? Are you mad?"</p>

  <p>He rose.</p>

  <p>"Why does any man tell any woman she is beautiful? You're old enough and
  sophisticated enough to know, my dear."</p>

  <p>For some moments she stood gazing at him intently, as if trying to confirm
  the impression of that first concentrated look at him. Then:</p>

  <p>"Louis," she said, "do you mean that you love me?"</p>

  <p>Creet grew uneasy beneath her steady gaze. He turned and fingered the
  figure of the dancing girl.</p>

  <p>"Would that surprise you?" he laughed. "Perhaps you don't realize how
  easily any man could fall in love with you. You and I could be very happy
  together, Jackie."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you want me to marry you?"</p>

  <p>"Supposing I did mean that, what would you say?"</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Louis, but I couldn't."</p>

  <p>"Because?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Larry Deans?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps&mdash;yes, I suppose Larry has something to do with it."</p>

  <p>Her eyes grew suddenly bright, and she stepped eagerly forward and laid a
  hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Louis," she said, "tell me&mdash;frankly&mdash;what you think. Shall we
  ever hear of Larry again? When did you last have news of him?"</p>

  <p>"Rather more than six months ago," he replied.</p>

  <p>"And you've heard nothing&mdash;from anyone&mdash;about him since
  then?"</p>

  <p>"I could hardly hear from anyone but Larry himself, or from Storman and
  Elliott, who are with him, and I've heard from none of them,"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"You don't believe we shall ever hear of them again, do you?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Jacqueline," said Louis, "you must realize that searching for a
  goldfield in the unexplored regions of Africa is a very risky business. Larry
  and the others are not the first who have been tempted by the prospect of
  immense wealth to risk their lives in looking for it. The legend of this
  particular goldfield is an old one, and the list of men who have set out to
  find it and have never returned is a long one. I'm afraid we must face the
  fact that Larry's name has been added to the list."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline was silent for some moments.</p>

  <p>"I see," she said at length. "Thanks, Louis. I suppose I've known that all
  the time, really, but I've shirked admitting it."</p>

  <p>She stood for a while gazing down into the fire, and then she raised her
  head again.</p>

  <p>"You knew all that when you sent Larry, didn't you," she stated rather
  than asked.</p>

  <p>"'Sent' is hardly the word," said Creet. "You know very well the state
  Larry was in when he went&mdash;up to his ears in debt, bankruptcy
  proceedings pending, and neither a penny in the world nor the inclination to
  do an honest day's work&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He saw the look in her eyes and paused.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Jackie," he went on. "I liked Larry. But I couldn't close my
  eyes to the fact that he was an incurable waster&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I won't listen," she interrupted. "I've known Larry ever since I can
  remember, and he's the finest, cleanest, whitest man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Louis cut her short.</p>

  <p>"Very well, my dear," he said, smiling indulgently. "But Larry's
  spotlessness doesn't affect the case. He came to me and told me that he
  wanted to have a try at finding the goldfield, and as he hadn't a penny in
  the world he suggested that I should finance the expedition. I liked Larry
  and was sorry for him, and I was fool enough to put up the money. I have
  probably lost several thousands over it."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline made a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"And Larry and Tubby Storman and Mark Elliott have probably lost their
  lives. Take me home, Louis, will you?"</p>

  <p>She turned to go towards the door, but Creet's hand on her arm detained
  her.</p>

  <p>"I asked you a question just now, Jacqueline, and you haven't
  answered."</p>

  <p>The girl faced him.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;about marrying you?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged.</p>

  <p>"It was you who mentioned marriage, not I."</p>

  <p>He lighted a cigarette with a careless air, but Jacqueline noticed that
  his hand was shaking.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately," he went on, "I'm not in a position to ask you to marry
  me. I'm already married."</p>

  <p>"Louis!" she gasped. "I had no idea&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Few people have," said Creet. "It's not a fact I'm particularly proud of,
  and I'm trusting you to respect my confidence. I'm only telling you because I
  want to play the game with you."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;then you're not asking me to marry you?"</p>

  <p>Again he shrugged.</p>

  <p>"There's such a thing as divorce," he said, "and there'd be no difficulty
  about that&mdash;a little later. But I was under the impression that with you
  modern young people marriage was too terribly old-fashioned to be
  considered&mdash;one of the things which simply isn't done nowadays."</p>

  <p>The girl's hand clenched, but she managed to control herself.</p>

  <p>"That was a bad mistake to make, Louis," she said quietly. "Why should you
  think that&mdash;of me?"</p>

  <p>"Except that you're more than usually beautiful, Jacqueline, I've no
  reason to believe you different from other women. Nine out of ten of them
  nowadays&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Louis&mdash;you're foul!"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"The outraged-innocence role is played out, my dear," he said. "You don't
  really think me foul. You wouldn't have thought it foul if Larry had asked
  you what I'm asking you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With a sudden jerk she wrenched her arm free, her hand struck him full on
  the mouth, and she turned and went quickly towards the door. But Creet was
  there before her, standing with his back against it, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Now that the play-acting is over, Jacqueline, perhaps we can get down to
  serious business."</p>

  <p>"I won't hear another word," she flamed and made a grab at the door
  handle, but Louis caught her wrist and held it.</p>

  <p>"Don't be too hasty, Jacqueline," he said. "After all, you're hardly in a
  position to ride the high horse, and I'm making you a very generous
  proposition. A thousand pounds is a lot of money&mdash;even for a beautiful
  woman."</p>

  <p>She stared at him with incredulous eyes.</p>

  <p>"You mean that&mdash;that if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You will hear no more from Monty Carr," said Louis. "I can promise you
  that. Take my advice, my dear, and don't be too absurdly old-fashioned. I
  know I'm not a Larry Deans, but Larry is definitely out of the running, and
  you might find a worse substitute than Louis Creet."</p>

  <p>He loosed her wrist and waited, watching her as she stood before him, her
  arms hanging limply at her sides, her gaze on the carpet.</p>

  <p>"You know my answer, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm waiting to hear it."</p>

  <p>"I've nothing to give you, Louis&mdash;even for ten thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>His hands gripped her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to give me, eh? That's like all you modern girls: you'll take,
  take, take as long as a man will go on paying, and when he asks you for
  something in return he discovers you're nothing but mean, unsporting little
  shirkers. You're all the same&mdash;cheap little twisters! You play the game
  as long as you win, and refuse to pay when you lose. But you won't get away
  with that this time, Jackie&mdash;not with me."</p>

  <p>She struggled to free herself, but he held her fast and drew her
  closer.</p>

  <p>"If you won't pay, my dear, you've got to be made to pay."</p>

  <p>She was helpless in his grasp. His arms slipped round her, crushed her to
  him, and his lips pressed fiercely against hers, forcing them against her
  teeth. Suddenly he released her, and stood watching as she sprang towards the
  door, flung it open and faced him.</p>

  <p>"Louis&mdash;what a swine you are!" she flamed; and then, with a sigh: "I
  wish to God Larry were here!"</p>

  <p>"He's not&mdash;and anyway, what use would Larry be?"</p>

  <p>"He'd kill you," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"As it is," sneered the other, "the honour of killing me is reserved for
  someone else. If I'm such a swine, why don't you take it on yourself,
  Jackie?"</p>

  <p>She glanced up and met his gaze.</p>

  <p>"I could, Louis&mdash;gladly," she said, with quiet vehemence, and turning
  abruptly slammed the door behind her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch03"
     name="ch03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The portable gramophone, balanced precariously on a pile of
  worn field baggage in the middle of the tent, struggled gallantly on. It was
  a dilapidated instrument. Eighteen months of African swamp and forest had
  left their marks on it no less than on the three men who shared the tent with
  it. Its covering was scarred and torn at the corners; its tarnished arm was
  clumsily mended with a piece of wire; its winding handle was broken, and only
  by the use of the pair of pliers which lay beside it could it be screwed up
  to concert pitch.</p>

  <p>The record on the swaying turntable&mdash;sole survivor of the original
  two dozen purchased eighteen months ago in Cape Town&mdash;had not come
  through unscathed; but, despite its deep scratches and the two cracks which
  ran from centre to circumference, the song was still recognizable:</p>

  <p>"How can I (click) live without (click) you? How (click) can I (click) let
  you (click) let you (click)&mdash;let you (click)&mdash;let you
  (click)&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The rusty needle gave a jerk, skidded, rasping, across the pitted surface
  of the record, and began scraping at the centre; but none of the three men in
  the tent took any notice.</p>

  <p>In the case of Tubby Storman this was an unprecedented display of
  indifference. Tubby was inclined to sentimentality as well as to plumpness,
  and this one surviving record, wrapped in the remnants of a khaki shirt, had
  travelled with him for the best part of eighteen months through Portuguese
  West Africa, his most treasured possession&mdash;with the exception of the
  photograph in the shabby leather wallet which he always carried in the pocket
  of his shirt, approximately over his heart.</p>

  <p>Every night for eighteen months Tubby, stretched on a camp bed in some
  God-forsaken spot where their camp was pitched, would set his gramophone
  playing this particular record, and lie, gazing sadly at the instrument, his
  face a picture of beautiful melancholy, until the song was finished, when he
  would sigh, stop the machine, close his eyes, and with a seraphic smile on
  his chubby face proceed to snore.</p>

  <p>On this occasion, however, he did not appear to be listening. With hands
  thrust deep into the pockets of what had originally been a pair of riding
  breeches, he was staring down with wide-open eyes at a box which stood on the
  ground at his feet. The box was lid-less, and in it was a shovelful of loose
  soil; but it seemed to fascinate Tubby, and the scraping of his last
  remaining gramophone needle failed to attract his attention.</p>

  <p>Larry Deans, seated on a box by the tent opening, intent on cleaning a
  rifle, turned his head and glanced from Tubby to the gramophone with a glint
  of amusement in his blue-grey eyes.</p>

  <p>"Tell me again you love me, Tubby," he said. "Kiss me on lips and brow.
  Beautiful, isn't it? But you might stop the damned thing scratching
  itself."</p>

  <p>Tubby, apparently, had not heard, but remained staring at the box, with
  the same rapt expression on his face. The lines round Larry's mouth formed
  themselves into a smile, and he rose, crossed to the gramophone, stopped it,
  and picked up the record. As he did so, there came another click, and the
  disk was divided into two.</p>

  <p>Larry turned to Tubby with a grin and displayed the pieces.</p>

  <p>"Parted&mdash;for good, Tubby," he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Thank heaven for that!" The voice came from Mark Elliott, sprawling, half
  asleep, on a mattress. "But break the news to him gently, Larry, and if he
  needs a handkerchief he can use my shirt. Portuguese West Africa is now
  almost a beautiful place. He's got no more records, has he?"</p>

  <p>Larry dug an elbow into Tubby's ribs.</p>

  <p>"Any more records, fat boy?"</p>

  <p>Just for a second Tubby turned his head and glanced at the broken record;
  and then his gaze returned to the box at his feet.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Larry!" he exclaimed in an awed voice. "It doesn't seem
  possible, does it?"</p>

  <p>Larry tossed the broken record away and returned to his box.</p>

  <p>"Take a good deep breath, old boy," he advised, "and tell yourself it's
  true."</p>

  <p>Tubby shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how it strikes you fellows," he said, "but it seems to
  me&mdash;well, sort of absurd. What I mean is, here's a box of dirt, the sort
  of thing you'd use for growing mustard and cress or tulips&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"0r forget-me-nots," suggested Mark.</p>

  <p>Tubby withered him with a look.</p>

  <p>"There are better uses," laughed Larry, "for the soil of an alluvial
  goldfield than growing mustard and cress. Keep on staring at it, Tubby, and
  telling yourself that you're a rich man."</p>

  <p>Tubby nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm doing it," he said, "but it doesn't seem to percolate. Seriously,
  Larry, what do you reckon, roughly, our goldfield's worth?"</p>

  <p>"For the fiftieth time in the last two hours, Tubby, I haven't a notion.
  Millions, probably. Maybe hundreds of millions."</p>

  <p>Tubby considered this for a moment, then his face lighted up.</p>

  <p>"I tell you what it is, you fellows," he said, with the air of one who has
  made a great discovery: "If what Larry says is true, it's&mdash;it's
  romantic, that's what it is."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lord!" sighed Mark.</p>

  <p>"It's a bit frightening if you ask me," said Larry. "And there are no ifs
  or buts about it, Tubby. Within two or three months you'll need a special
  staff of secretaries to deal with begging letters."</p>

  <p>Tubby smiled.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what Bunty will say&mdash;and the kids." he mused.</p>

  <p>"'Daddy's a millionaire, darling&mdash;isn't he clever?'" laughed Larry.
  "What will you do with your money, Tubby?"</p>

  <p>"If he says he'll buy a new gramophone, Larry, shoot him now," urged
  Mark.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to buy a place in the country&mdash;a big place," announced
  Tubby. "I might have a <i>pied-à-terre</i> in town as well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A what?"</p>

  <p>"A flat in London is what he means, Mark," explained Larry. "What's the
  programme for the country, Tubby&mdash;growing bigger and better
  chickens?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, a few hunters and a couple of cars and a dog or two, and that sort of
  thing. Try to remember, you fellows, if you chance to meet me, that it's
  usual to touch your hat to the squire. 'Morning, Squire!' 'Good-morning,
  farmer. How are the pigs?' 'Why, Squire, them sure do be foine, and all they
  sows got litters.'"</p>

  <p>Mark groaned.</p>

  <p>"The horrible thing is," he said, with a sad shake of the head, "that
  that's exactly what is going to happen. I'm going to race&mdash;have about a
  dozen horses in training and buy a house at Newmarket."</p>

  <p>"That's sheer waste of money, old boy," reproved Tubby.</p>

  <p>Mark shrugged.</p>

  <p>"There'll be plenty to play about with&mdash;eh, Larry?"</p>

  <p>"Enough for Tubby to play the squire with distinction," laughed Larry.
  "Can't you see him going round the village at Christmas time, distributing
  blankets to poor old women when they'd much rather have a bottle of gin?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, a quarter share in the goldfield is worth a tidy lot of money,
  anyway," said Tubby contentedly, "and I daresay I'll throw in a bottle of gin
  as well. If you ask me, the luckiest man in this outfit is Louis Creet. We've
  had to work for our quarter share&mdash;eighteen months of swamp and forest
  and beastly mosquitoes and tsetse fly, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fleas," said Larry; "natives of Africa. Don't forget them, Tubby."</p>

  <p>"Not to mention 'Parted,'" sighed Mark.</p>

  <p>"And all old Louis has had to do for his quarter share," continued Tubby,
  "is to stay at home and swallow pastilles and generally take care of his
  precious health."</p>

  <p>"A quarter share each was the arrangement, Tubby," said Larry. "What are
  you grousing about?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not. All I'm saying is that Louis should be feeling pretty average
  grateful to us."</p>

  <p>"He should go down on his knees," said Mark, "and lick our boots in
  gratitude. But before he did that he'd want the boot polish analyzed, to be
  sure it wouldn't upset his delicate stomach. I never knew a bloke so windy
  about his health. What's wrong with him, Larry?"</p>

  <p>Larry frowned.</p>

  <p>"Physically?" He gave a shrug. "But I can't see Louis on his knees in
  gratitude to any of us over this business. He'll probably think we should go
  on our knees to him for financing the expedition. It's rough on you, Tubby:
  your boots deserve a lick from Louis, anyway. Do you realize, Mark, that we
  might have gone back with failure written in large letters across our pants
  if Tubby hadn't had the intelligence to fall into that swamp?"</p>

  <p>"'Fall in' isn't quite correct, old boy," said Tubby. "I was simply
  looking for a solid foothold for my fourteen stone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If Tubby hadn't fallen in," continued Larry, "we shouldn't have had to
  fish him out; and it was through fishing him out that we found the only
  causeway that could get us to Chumbaziri. Mark and I are grateful to you,
  anyway, Tubby."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, I'm glad I have my uses," sighed Tubby. "What's the next move,
  Larry?"</p>

  <p>"To get out of this bug-ridden spot and secure our concession for the
  goldfield as quickly as we can. God knows how long it will take us. The next
  thing will be to communicate with Louis, because without him we can't get a
  move on. I've sent a boy off today to the coast with a cable to Louis,
  telling him we've located the mine and asking him to come out as soon as
  possible. If the boy gets through all right he should reach the court in
  about six weeks, and if Louis starts at once he should reach Lobito Bay
  almost as soon as we do. By the way, there's only one bathroom in the Da
  Silva Hotel, Tubby, and it's already booked in my name for the first two
  hours after we arrive there."</p>

  <p>"Soap&mdash;and hot water!" sighed Mark. "I'm next after Larry in the
  bathroom, Tubby."</p>

  <p>Tubby smiled.</p>

  <p>"You fellows are forgetting the most important thing," he said. "Mind you,
  I'm all for cleanliness and washing behind your ears and that sort of thing,
  but in my case the soap and water will have to wait. There'll be
  letters&mdash;from England."</p>

  <p>Larry rose, laid aside his rifle, and stood gazing out through the opening
  of the tent.</p>

  <p>"You'd forgotten the letters, eh, Larry?"</p>

  <p>"No, I hadn't," said the other quietly.</p>

  <p>"Do you realize, Larry, that it's months since any of us had a single
  blessed line from home?"</p>

  <p>Larry did not answer.</p>

  <p>"For nearly six months I've heard nothing from Bunty and the kids, and
  you've heard nothing from Jacqueline&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Larry turned abruptly and flung himself on his mattress.</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up, Tubby!" he exclaimed irritably. "Go to bed."</p>

  <p>Tubby glanced at the gramophone, sighed, and stretched himself on his
  battered camp bed.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, my brother millionaires," he said and closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>A few moments later the stillness of the African night was broken by the
  sound of a man's voice singing:</p>

  <p class="poem">"How can I live without you?<br>
  How can I let you go?<br>
  I that you loved so well, dear..."</p>

  <p>The "dear" was sustained for several bars, a long, unsteady, rapidly
  failing note, and, as it finally expired:</p>

  <p>"Larry!" came Mark's voice.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!"</p>

  <p>"What did you do with that record?"</p>

  <p>"It's broken. I slung it away."</p>

  <p>Mark uttered a groan.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Larry, see if you can find it and stick it together
  again."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch04"
     name="ch04">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Jacqueline walked home from Creet's flat. It took her the
  best part of an hour, but she felt that to sit still in a taxi was more than
  she could endure. She must keep moving. She did not want to think, and
  walking made thinking less compulsory. And she hoped that by walking she
  would arrive too late for the usual goodnight gossip with her father and
  mother. She could not face that half-hour of commonplace chatter tonight. She
  wanted to be alone&mdash;to slip upstairs unobserved and lock her door and
  cry. Above all else she wanted to have a bath. She felt mentally and
  physically soiled; and though tears might wash the dark thoughts from her
  mind, she was obsessed with the idea that only soap and water could cleanse
  her from the touch of Louis Creet.</p>

  <p>But It was not to be. As she noiselessly opened the front door, Dr.
  Thurston came into the hall; a white-haired man with genial blue eyes, tall,
  with a pair of massive shoulders and hands as gentle as a woman's.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Jackie, you little devil!" he greeted her. "Do you know it's
  nearly half-past twelve?"</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Father. I've been out with Louis."</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston nodded.</p>

  <p>"Had a good time?"</p>

  <p>She wrinkled up her nose.</p>

  <p>"A bit Creetish."</p>

  <p>"Creetish?"</p>

  <p>"Stodgy," she explained. "Louis can be dreadfully middle-aged."</p>

  <p>Thurston smiled.</p>

  <p>"Louis is a good chap," he said. "Good-night, my dear."</p>

  <p>He kissed her, and she was turning away when he caught her by the arm and
  gazed anxiously into her face.</p>

  <p>"Nothing wrong, Jackie?"</p>

  <p>"No, Father. Why?"</p>

  <p>"You looked fagged out&mdash;almost middle-aged yourself instead of
  twenty-two."</p>

  <p>"Blame Louis," she laughed. "Perhaps middle age is catching. Good-night,
  Father."</p>

  <p>She was halfway up the stairs when her father called to her.</p>

  <p>"By the way, Jackie," he said, "you can tell Louis when you see him that
  if he makes any more appointments and doesn't keep them I shall charge them
  up to him. He was supposed to be here at three o'clock for me to examine him,
  but as usual he didn't put in an appearance."</p>

  <p>"All right, I'll tell him," laughed Jacqueline, and hesitated. "Father,
  what really is wrong with Louis?" she asked. "Anything?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't examined him, so I can't say, Jackie. He's always imagining
  he's ill, but if you want my real opinion he's a bit of an old woman who
  fusses over his health when all he's really suffering from is a swollen bank
  balance and enlarged leisure."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Jacqueline. "Then there's not really any chance that he'll
  suddenly drop dead?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"People don't drop dead from those troubles, Jackie. Why?"</p>

  <p>"I wondered," sighed the girl. "Good-night, Father."</p>

  <p>When she had bathed, Jacqueline felt better, and when she had locked the
  door of her bedroom she did not cry. Instead, she seated herself in an
  armchair before the glowing gas fire, lighted a cigarette, and tried to take
  a calm look at the situation.</p>

  <p>She had, of course, been a perfect little fool, but it was no use wasting
  time in reviling herself, and Louis Creet was not even worth reviling.
  Somehow she must find a way out of the tangle in which she had become
  involved. Useless as it was, she could not help wishing that Larry were
  there. If Larry had been there, she would never have played the idiot as she
  had done during the last few months. Even if he had written, all this could
  never have happened. But when, six months ago, his letters had suddenly
  ceased, nothing had seemed to matter; and because thinking of Larry had hurt
  her so unbearably, anything had been welcome that had helped her to
  forget.</p>

  <p>For some time her thoughts clung to Larry, and a smile hovered round her
  lips. And then she suddenly remembered that she would never see him again,
  and once more nothing seemed to matter. Monty must do what he liked; if he
  told her father she couldn't help it; she could not be bothered with Monty
  now. She could not be bothered with anything. She just wanted to sit where
  she was in front of the fire. She was dreadfully tired.</p>

  <p>A soft tap on her door roused her, and she rose, crossed to the door, and
  opened it. It was Mrs. Thurston, in dressing gown and bedroom slippers.</p>

  <p>"Not asleep, darling?"</p>

  <p>She seated herself on the edge of the bed and scrutinized the girl
  keenly.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong, Jacqueline?"</p>

  <p>"No, Mother. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Your father said you seemed rather upset, dear, and I thought I'd run
  along and see if anything had happened."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline kissed her and returned to her armchair.</p>

  <p>"You and Father are a couple of old fusspots," she laughed. "What could
  happen?"</p>

  <p>"Louis hasn't&mdash;asked you anything?"</p>

  <p>The girl glanced round sharply.</p>

  <p>"Louis? What on earth should Louis ask me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear, I've been hoping... He has been paying you very marked
  attentions... no girl could want a better match."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline smiled.</p>

  <p>"Have you got out of bed at half-past one in the morning to come and
  discover if Louis has asked me to marry him? Well, he hasn't, and I don't
  suppose he ever will."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston sighed again.</p>

  <p>"I don't agree with you, Jacqueline," she said. "Louis would make a
  splendid husband, and I'm surprised he hasn't asked you before this. I'm sure
  I've invited him to dinner and left you alone together often enough. I
  suppose I must persevere, and I do hope, my dear, you will back me up."</p>

  <p>"The next time Louis comes to dinner, Mother, I promise you I'll squeeze
  his hand under the table."</p>

  <p>"And when he does ask you, I hope, dear, you won't refuse him without
  thinking very carefully about it. I do feel that if you and he could make a
  match of It</p>

  <p>"All right. Mother," interrupted the girl. "If Louis should ever ask me to
  marry him, I promise you I'll think about it. Marriage isn't much in my line,
  though."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston glanced at her, then rose, stood behind her chair, and laid
  a hand on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Jackie," she said gently, "you're not still fretting over Larry,
  are you?"</p>

  <p>The girl's hand found her mother's and pressed it.</p>

  <p>"We won't talk about Larry, please, Mother."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston stood for a time gazing thoughtfully at the fire, while her
  fingers fondled Jacqueline's hair. Then she stooped, and her lips touched the
  girl's cheek.</p>

  <p>"Poor Jackie!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>She returned to the bed and sat down.</p>

  <p>"I want you to remember, dear," she said, "when Louis does ask, that your
  father and I both think very highly of him. He has been very good to your
  father."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline's eyebrows were raised.</p>

  <p>"Louis&mdash;good to Father? How?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston nodded.</p>

  <p>"Your father said I was on no account to tell you, Jacqueline, but it's
  only right that you should know.</p>

  <p>If it hadn't been for Louis, Father would still have been curing colds and
  bringing babies into the world in that poky little village. Of course,
  somebody has got to bring babies into the world, and I'm sure he did it very
  well, but he was always fretting to be in Harley Street, and it was Louis who
  made it possible. It seems to cost a dreadful lot of money to be a Harley
  Street specialist. I wonder how any of them afford it. It needed more than
  your father got for his country practice even to make a start."</p>

  <p>"And Louis supplied it?"</p>

  <p>The older woman nodded.</p>

  <p>"A very handsome check, dear," she confided. "And of course it's a
  dreadfully slow business getting known in Harley Street, and you can't hope
  to make enough to live on for the first few years, and if it weren't for
  Louis's generosity I'm sure I don't know where we should be."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline's eyes were troubled.</p>

  <p>"You mean, Mother, that Louis is still giving Father money?"</p>

  <p>"Well, dear, not exactly giving it," said Mrs. Thurston. "He did it very
  tactfully, I must say. He said he had always been accustomed to pay his
  medical adviser a fixed sum every year to look after his health&mdash;he's
  very nervous about his health, you know, although your father says there's
  nothing at all the matter with him&mdash;and as his former doctor had just
  gone abroad he'd be very grateful if your father would look after him
  instead. Five hundred a year isn't a fortune, but as things are now it's a
  godsend. If it weren't for Louis's five hundred a year your father would have
  been obliged to give up Harley Street long ago, and that would break his
  heart now&mdash;just when he's beginning to get a footing."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Jacqueline thoughtfully. "Then it comes to this. Mother,
  that to all intents and purposes we're living on Louis's money?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston nodded.</p>

  <p>"Your father would be very angry if he knew I'd told you, Jacqueline, but
  I thought it right that you should know. And now I must get back to bed,
  dear, or he will have rolled the bedclothes all round him and gone to sleep,
  and I shall shiver all night. He always does if I don't cling to them.
  Good-night, my dear."</p>

  <p>As Mrs. Thurston closed the door behind her, Jacqueline rose and stood for
  a time motionless, frowning. And then she suddenly flung her cigarette into
  the fireplace.</p>

  <p>Living on Louis Creet's money! The web was woven more tightly than she had
  feared.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch05"
     name="ch05">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Jacqueline did not enjoy her breakfast the next morning. She
  knew, however, that any marked loss of appetite was bound to attract her
  father's attention, and that when the meal was over he would want to see her
  tongue, stare into her eyes, diagnose and prescribe. It was the inevitable
  result of failure to eat a hearty meal, to which she was quite accustomed;
  but this morning the searching scrutiny of her father's eyes was an ordeal
  she was anxious to avoid; correct diagnosis was the last thing she wanted,
  and the only prescription which could cure her trouble was one which her
  father could not possibly supply. So she valiantly swallowed her breakfast
  and tried to dismiss from her mind the thought&mdash;which assailed her with
  every mouthful&mdash;that it was Louis Creet's money that had paid for what
  she was eating.</p>

  <p>As soon as Dr. Thurston had left for his consulting room in Harley Street,
  Jacqueline shut herself in his study and telephoned to Monty. Mr. Carr, she
  was informed, was not yet up, but would speak to her if she would hold the
  line; and a few moments later, Monty's voice, as expressionless as his face,
  reached her.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, Jacqueline. Don't you ever sleep." It's barely ten
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline forced a laugh.</p>

  <p>"I didn't sleep much last night, Monty."</p>

  <p>"No?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I was too worried."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry.</p>

  <p>"About that bet last night," she explained. "It was idiotic of me to
  worry, really. You knew it was a joke, Monty, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Joke?"</p>

  <p>"Louis said you might not appreciate that sort of humour, so I've rung up
  to apologize. I'm frightfully sorry, Monty."</p>

  <p>For some moments there was silence, while Jacqueline gazed anxiously at
  the telephone, as if trying to wrest from it some indication of the effect of
  her words on Monty's impassive face. And then came his voice again.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't understand, Jacqueline. I wasn't aware that you had
  played any joke."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline forced a laugh, but there was no smile in her face.</p>

  <p>"You didn't really believe the bet was anything else, Monty, did you?" She
  strove, not very successfully, to prevent her voice from betraying her
  anxiety. "You couldn't really have thought I should risk a thousand
  pounds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"On the hand you held, a thousand pounds was a moderate stake,"
  interrupted Monty. "Yours was the third ace out, and the odds were
  tremendously against my turning up the fourth. As it happened, I did. If I
  hadn't, I should have owed you a thousand pounds. I shouldn't have thought it
  a joke, but I should have paid without squealing!"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline drew in her breath sharply, and her fingers gripped the
  receiver more tightly. She was losing, and she knew it. Something in Monty's
  voice told her that the bluff had failed, that Monty recognized it as a
  bluff, that he knew she had made the bet seriously and was now trying to
  escape payment by the contemptible subterfuge of pretending it had only been
  a joke. Louis had thought the same. And of course it was true. Of course she
  had made the bet seriously, and of course it was contemptible to try to
  wriggle out of payment. She despised herself as much as Monty despised her.
  But a thousand pounds was an impossible sum....</p>

  <p>"Are you there, Jacqueline?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Why not be frank? You never intended the bet as a joke."</p>

  <p>For some moments Jacqueline hesitated, staring at the telephone, with
  panic in her eyes. Then:</p>

  <p>"No, Monty," she said quietly, "I meant the bet quite seriously. I'm
  sorry. Monty, I&mdash;I can't pay. I knew when I made the bet that I couldn't
  pay if I lost, and I had no right to make the bet at all. I'm terribly
  ashamed of myself. I can't think how I came to do a thing like that. I
  suppose I was excited and lost my head&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There came a click over the line, and she paused, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! Are you there, Monty?"</p>

  <p>There was no reply. Monty had hung up.</p>

  <p>The colour rushed to her cheeks. So that was his answer! He could not have
  told her more plainly what he thought of her: he despised her as much as
  Louis did&mdash;and with better reason. But at that moment neither of them
  despised her as much as she despised herself.</p>

  <p>She tried to persuade herself that Monty had not hung up his receiver. The
  exchange, perhaps, had cut her off. Another call to Mount Lodge, however,
  dispelled that hope. Mr. Carr, she was told, was engaged and could not come
  to the telephone; and although she tried again three times during the
  morning, Mr. Carr on each occasion remained obstinately inaccessible. After
  the third attempt she gave it up. After all, it did not matter very much what
  Monty Carr thought of her, as long as he realized that she could not possibly
  pay. Louis had said that he would certainly expect payment, but she did not
  allow that fact to worry her. Louis had had very special reasons for wishing
  her to think so; that threat had been just a thong in the whip which he had
  cracked at her. She suspected that the whip, if she were obstinate, would
  prove to have other thongs, and she wondered what they would be.</p>

  <p>She was soon to discover. In accordance with her plan of patient
  perseverance, Mrs. Thurston had invited Louis to dinner that evening, and by
  means of the transparent manoeuvres which passed with her for tact, contrived
  to leave him alone with Jacqueline in the drawing room.</p>

  <p>Louis seated himself at the piano and ran his fingers over the keys.</p>

  <p>"What tune shall I play for you, Jacqueline?" Jacqueline, staring into the
  fire, shrugged. "Whatever tune you play, I'm not going to dance to it."</p>

  <p>Louis strolled to the fireplace and stood smiling down at her.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't do to be too sure, darling," he said. "The music might be
  so&mdash;compelling that you couldn't help dancing."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline sprang to her feet and faced him with angry eyes.</p>

  <p>"Louis, how dare you come here tonight! After last night, if you'd had any
  decent feelings at all you would at least have kept away from me."</p>

  <p>"I came because your mother invited me," said Louis. "Of course, if the
  proposal I made to you yesterday is really as repugnant as you
  pretended&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I was not pretending."</p>

  <p>"Very well," agreed Louis. "Then we will say that if you feel you can
  afford to refuse it, I shall have no choice but to stay away in the
  future."</p>

  <p>"I've already refused it."</p>

  <p>Louis sighed.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, Jacqueline," he said, "it is too much to ask you to believe
  that I am really very much in love with you? But it happens to be true."</p>

  <p>"Love?" She laughed. "I should leave love out of it, Louis, if I were you.
  You don't want me to believe, do you, that because I won't be bought for a
  thousand pounds you're going to rush away in despair and shoot lions?" She
  shook her head. "But we won't talk about it." She nodded towards the piano.
  "Play something, Louis."</p>

  <p>Creet did not move.</p>

  <p>"I shan't go and shoot lions," he said, "but I shall certainly go abroad.
  You could hardly expect me, caring for you as I do, to stay here in London,
  coming to your house, meeting you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She cut him short with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"I shall go abroad," he repeated. "For many reasons I shall be sorry to
  go. I shall be sorry, for instance, to lose your father&mdash;both as a
  friend and as a medical adviser; and I feel sure your father will miss
  me&mdash;both as a friend and as a patient."</p>

  <p>He paused and shot her a questioning glance. Jacqueline was frowning.</p>

  <p>"I see," she said. "So that's the other thong, is it?"</p>

  <p>"Thong?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, never mind," she sighed. "I understand, and there was no need for you
  to beat about the bush. You mean that unless I agree to your beastly
  proposal, Father will lose the five hundred a year you pay him as your
  medical attendant."</p>

  <p>Louis shrugged.</p>

  <p>"That would naturally be so," he said, "though it hadn't occurred to me.
  But I don't imagine my paltry five hundred a year is of much consequence to
  your father."</p>

  <p>"It is&mdash;and you know it is," interrupted Jacqueline. "For heaven's
  sake, Louis, if you can't be decent, be frank. First you threaten me with
  having to pay a thousand pounds to Monty, and now, when you find that hasn't
  done the trick, you threaten to cut off the five hundred a year from my
  father because you know that he can't afford to lose it, that to all intents
  and purposes we're living on it, and that if he lost it he'd have to give up
  everything and be a little G.P. in the country again, just when he's starting
  to do the work he has always longed to do. And you're counting on my caring
  too much for him&mdash;and for Mother&mdash;to let it happen. Isn't that the
  truth?"</p>

  <p>Before Louis could answer, Mrs. Thurston, having tactfully rattled the
  handle of the door, came in and glanced eagerly at Jacqueline; and the girl,
  reading the question in her eyes, turned her head away.</p>

  <p>"You're just in time, Mother," she said. "Louis is going to play us a
  tune."</p>

  <p>Louis went to the piano.</p>

  <p>"And Jacqueline is going to dance," he laughed, and began to play.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch06"
     name="ch06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The note which Jacqueline received the following day was
  brief and to the point. It ran thus:</p>

  <p class="letter">Dear Jacqueline:</p>

  <p class="letter">"If I do not receive your check during the day I shall
  consider myself free to take whatever steps I think fit.</p>

  <p class="letter">Sincerely yours, M.C.</p>

  <p>She opened it at breakfast, and, as a consequence, when the meal was over,
  had to submit to her father's examination, diagnosis, and prescription of a
  good strong tonic and not less than eight hours' sleep a night.</p>

  <p>After breakfast she shut herself in his study and read the note again. But
  the second reading only strengthened the impression created by the first and
  made Monty's threat stand out more clearly. Monty meant to have his money,
  and if she did not pay him there was only one step which he could take with
  any hope of obtaining it: he would tell her father. That he must never
  do.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline tore the note into tiny fragments, tossed them into the fire,
  lifted the receiver of the telephone, and asked for Monty's number. Mr. Carr,
  of course, was out. She had expected that. Monty did not intend to argue
  about it. Perhaps, if she could manage to raise some part of it...</p>

  <p>She went out&mdash;without knowing exactly why. She had a vague idea that
  she might somewhere find someone who could help her. There must be plenty of
  people in London who could lend her £1,000 and not even miss it. It was
  hopelessly unfair. She saw cars which had cost more than she needed to get
  her out of her trouble, and felt that she hated their occupants. If every
  person she passed in the street would give her a shilling...</p>

  <p>She pulled herself up sharply and made an effort to be practical. She knew
  plenty of people, but there were few among the bright young set whom she knew
  well enough to ask for £1,000, and she doubted if among those few there was
  one who had it to lend.</p>

  <p>She called on several. "Sorry, Jackie; I'm broke," was the invariable
  answer. It was humiliating as well as hopeless, and at length she gave it up
  and called at Mount Lodge with a vague idea of appealing to Monty Carr's
  chivalry. But Monty, as she had known he would be, was still "not at home"
  when she gave her name.</p>

  <p>After that Jacqueline had no clear recollection of where she went or what
  she did. She was very near panic. She had a dim impression of interviewing a
  Mr. Jacobs, who politely asked her impertinent questions from behind a
  massive mahogany desk, spoke of securities and guarantors and promissory
  notes, and seemed deeply grieved that she should have so misunderstood his
  advertisement in the newspaper as to imagine that he was really prepared to
  lend from £50 to £50,000 on a note of hand alone, without either security or
  delay or vexatious enquiries. He then proceeded to call her "my dear" and
  hinted that if she would care to dine with him that evening at a certain
  quiet little restaurant it might be possible to come to some arrangement. Mr.
  Jacobs reminded her of Louis. She was glad to get away from him.</p>

  <p>After that episode Jacqueline hurried home, pleaded a headache as an
  excuse, and shut herself in her bedroom until dinner time.</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston was unusually grave during dinner, so absorbed in thought
  that even when Jacqueline left her soup untasted and did no more than dissect
  her fish, he made no comment; and her mother was so obviously indulging in
  tactful cheerfulness that Jacqueline, glancing anxiously from one to the
  other, wondered. Bid they already know?</p>

  <p>When the meal was over Dr. Thurston signed to her to follow him and led
  the way into his study.</p>

  <p>"I want a word with you, Jackie," he said, seated himself in his armchair,
  and seemed to forget her. Jacqueline, her heart thumping, waited.</p>

  <p>"Anything&mdash;anything wrong. Father?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston roused himself.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Jackie," he said. "I've something to say to you. Not very
  pleasant, I'm afraid. It's about your mother."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline suddenly felt that breathing had become less difficult, but her
  eyes were anxious as she glanced at her father's grave face.</p>

  <p>"Mother?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've said nothing to you before, Jackie, because&mdash;well, there was no
  need to until I was certain, but now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There came a tap on the door, and the maid came in.</p>

  <p>"There's a gentleman asking to see you, sir," she announced. "I've shown
  him into the drawing room. Carr is the name."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline could not restrain a start.</p>

  <p>"Carr?" repeated Dr. Thurston. "I don't know anyone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's for me. Father, I expect," said Jacqueline casually. "Monty Carr,
  probably. I've met him at all sorts of places&mdash;with Louis. I'll go and
  see."</p>

  <p>She hurried from the study and went to the drawing room.</p>

  <p>Monty, tall, slim, and faultlessly groomed, was standing by the fire, and
  as she entered he so far lost control of his mask-like face as just
  perceptibly to raise his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Good-evening, Jacqueline. I asked to see your father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She cut him short.</p>

  <p>"I know why you've come," she said. "I half expected you to
  come&mdash;after your letter. But be a sportsman, Monty, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"Have you been?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, I know I haven't," admitted Jacqueline. "It wasn't sporting to
  make a bet which I knew I couldn't pay, and it wasn't sporting to try to
  wriggle out of paying by pretending it was a joke. I admit all that, Monty,
  and I've apologized for it. I can't do any more."</p>

  <p>"So I understand," said Monty. "And that, Jacqueline, is precisely why it
  is essential for your father to do something on your behalf. Since you have
  incurred a debt which you can't pay, your father would not, I am sure, wish
  the debt to remain unpaid."</p>

  <p>"But, Monty, if you gave me time&mdash;I might be able&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Time, unfortunately, is an important factor," he interrupted. "I am more
  than sorry, Jacqueline, if I am importunate, but I have obligations of my own
  to meet which cannot wait. From what you have said I imagine there isn't the
  slightest chance of your ever being able to find a sum anywhere approaching a
  thousand pounds. If you could give me your word that in a week's time, say,
  you would be in a position to pay me, I might manage to wait till then, but I
  don't imagine that you can."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Then in justice to me you have no right to object to my explaining the
  position to your father."</p>

  <p>"Monty, you can't!" exclaimed Jacqueline. "You don't understand. Father
  can't possibly pay you a thousand pounds any more than I can. It wouldn't be
  the least use telling him."</p>

  <p>Monty smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"For a gentleman, Jacqueline, there are always means of finding the money
  to pay a debt of honour."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Father couldn't do it," she insisted. "He hasn't got a thousand pounds.
  Besides, there are other reasons. I daresay they'd strike you as silly,
  sentimental reasons, but they count a good deal with me. I simply couldn't
  bear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She caught the sound of the study door being opened and paused; then, as
  she heard her father's footsteps in the hall, she grasped Monty's arm
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Monty&mdash;please&mdash;promise me not to tell him," she begged. "I'll
  pay you somehow. If you'll just say nothing, and give me a chance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Monty was shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Jacqueline, but I can't afford to make any such promise. Your
  father must be told."</p>

  <p>She dropped her hand and stood for a moment irresolute; then, as her
  father neared the door, she darted to it and grasped the handle.</p>

  <p>"Monty&mdash;quick&mdash;promise me!" she said. "If you insist that Father
  must be told&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do."</p>

  <p>"Then promise me to say nothing, and I'll tell him myself. I give you my
  word, Monty; I'll tell him tonight."</p>

  <p>Monty eyed her keenly and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Jacqueline," he said. "We'll leave it at that."</p>

  <p>With a sigh of relief Jacqueline heard her father pass the door and go
  upstairs. She went with Monty to the front door, bade him good-bye, and
  returned to the study. There was no help for it now; she must tell her
  father. It would be a humiliating confession, but she was becoming accustomed
  to humiliation. Far harder to tolerate would be the results which she knew
  must follow. Her father, she knew, would insist that the debt must be paid;
  it was all he could do even now to keep his head above water, and this extra
  weight hung around his neck must inevitably drag him under. But since he had
  to be told, she preferred to tell him herself. It would hurt him less that
  way than if he learnt of it from Monty Carr or Louis. She would tell him at
  once&mdash;as soon as he came back&mdash;and get it over.</p>

  <p>But when Dr. Thurston returned she hesitated. It was only a few seconds'
  hesitation as he crossed to his chair and sat down, but during those few
  seconds her chance of speaking vanished.</p>

  <p>"Got rid of your visitor, Jackie?" said Dr. Thurston. "Good! I was just
  going to tell you about your mother. I've been anxious about her for some
  time now, but there was no sense in worrying you before it was necessary.
  This afternoon I gave her a very thorough overhaul, and I'm afraid there's no
  doubt about it."</p>

  <p>"She's&mdash;ill?" asked Jacqueline anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly ill&mdash;yet, Jackie," replied her father. "But Stanford has
  overhauled her, too, and he agrees with me that we must take prompt measures
  if she's to escape a very serious illness. There's only one way of staving it
  off&mdash;absolute rest and a long sea voyage; and somehow it's got to be
  managed. That's where you come in, Jackie."</p>

  <p>"Anything I can do, Father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, my dear," interrupted Dr. Thurston. "I've been counting on you to
  help make it possible. The fact is, Jackie, things have been pretty difficult
  since I sold my practice&mdash;financially, I mean&mdash;and if I hadn't been
  fortunate enough to have a generous friend or two I should have had to pack
  up long ago."</p>

  <p>"You mean, Father, that you can't afford&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It has got to be afforded somehow, Jackie," Dr. Thurston interrupted.
  "I've had an idea for some time that something like this was almost due, and
  I've managed to lay aside a couple of hundred pounds. That will just about
  see the business through, I fancy, if you and I go a bit steady at our end.
  I'm afraid there'll have to be a few less frocks and hats and things, my
  dear, until matters right themselves, but I know you won't mind that."</p>

  <p>"If only I'd known. Father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;you'd have had no frocks or hats at all," laughed Dr.
  Thurston. "But I'm going to ask you to do your share now, Jackie. It's a bit
  humiliating at my time of life to have to ask you, but I think&mdash;just
  until better times come along&mdash;you ought to find something to do. You
  could do typing or shorthand or something, couldn't you?"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline stooped and touched his forehead with her lips.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, Father," she said tenderly. "I'll do my bit."</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston rose, smiling.</p>

  <p>"You've never let me down yet, my dear," he said, patting her shoulder,
  "and I knew I could count on you. And remember&mdash;not a word to your
  mother. She mustn't be worried, and if she thought we were going short of
  anything she'd refuse to go. I've told her I've a thousand in the bank and
  the trip is a flea bite. It's a beautiful lie, Jackie, but we mustn't let her
  spot it."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline did her best to blink away her tears and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Trust me. Father," she said. "I'll keep it up. It's such a very beautiful
  lie."</p>

  <p>Upstairs in her bedroom Jacqueline sat for a long time in her chair by the
  gas fire; and then she rose, went to her writing desk, and wrote a note to
  Monty. It ran as follows:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Monty:</p>

  <p class="letter">"After all, I can't possibly tell Father, but if you will
  wait just a few days I give you my word that you shall he paid in full.
  You'll do that, won't you?</p>

  <p>And then, with set lips, she wrote another note:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Louis:</p>

  <p class="letter">"I accept your offer. When?</p>

  <p class="letter">"J.T."</p>

  <p>She stamped them and went out to the pillar box at the corner. There, just
  for a moment, she hesitated, and then, with a shrug, she slipped the letters
  into the box.</p>

  <p>All that night she lay awake, telling herself that there was nothing else
  to be done, and that it didn't matter, anyway. She would never see Larry
  again, and nothing mattered.</p>

  <p>It was almost daylight when at last she fell asleep, and it was not until
  eleven o'clock, when the maid entered her room, that she woke and sat
  upright.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Creet is on the telephone, Miss Jacqueline," said the maid. "I told
  him you weren't up yet, so he said would I give you a message."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline bit her lip. Last night, after that talk with her father, it
  had seemed possible&mdash;the only possible thing to do; but this morning,
  with Louis waiting on the telephone...</p>

  <p>"Mr. Creet says. Miss Jacqueline, he thanks you for your note and he'd be
  glad if you'd go and have dinner with him at seven o'clock this evening, and
  he'd hold the line while I came and asked you."</p>

  <p>"Tonight?" There was panic in her voice. "But I can't&mdash;tell him I
  didn't mean&mdash;" She paused abruptly and forced herself to smile. "Righto!
  Tell Mr. Creet I'll be there at seven," she said; and as the maid closed the
  door she buried her face in the pillow, and her teeth bit hard into her
  lip.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch07"
     name="ch07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Louis Creet's dressing table would have delighted any
  woman's heart. In selecting it Louis had obviously been influenced by
  considerations which had more than counterbalanced his prejudice against dust
  and germs; for it was a highly decorative piece of furniture with a multitude
  of drawers. It had soft, cunningly hidden lights, and its long, handsome
  mirrors were adjustable to give a full-length view of the figure from every
  angle from which a woman could wish to see herself. Its appurtenances were in
  keeping. There were comb, brushes, and hand mirror in tortoise shell and
  gold; an array of exquisite little boxes containing three shades of face
  powder, rouge, cream; several dainty cut-glass bottles of perfume.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline stared at them, frowning. She picked up a gold lipstick case
  and pulled off the cap. The lipstick was worn to half its full length. She
  tossed it aside with a wry smile. She wondered what sum the others had
  received.</p>

  <p>She raised her head and stared long and searchingly at her reflection in
  the mirror. She could detect no difference in herself. She felt mildly
  surprised at that. She had always had an idea that when a girl had
  experienced what she had just experienced there was some subtle change in her
  expression. According to her mother her eyes should have lost their look of
  innocence, and guilt and shame should be impressed on her face. But her eyes
  looked exactly the same as usual, as far as she could see, and she was not
  conscious of any feeling of guilt or shame. She felt disgust when she
  remembered...</p>

  <p>But she was not going to remember. Once away from Louis's flat, she would
  blot this evening from her memory.</p>

  <p>She turned, went, without a glance to right or left, from the room, and
  hurried along the corridor towards the front door of the flat. Halfway along
  it she hesitated, retraced her steps along the corridor. The door of the
  dining room was ajar and she pushed it open. Louis was lolling on the couch
  in front of the fire.</p>

  <p>"Louis, I'm going home. You'd better take me."</p>

  <p>Louis rose, took her arm, and drew her into the room. What's the hurry,
  darling?"</p>

  <p>"I want to go home&mdash;at once."</p>

  <p>Louis raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Is that wise? It's barely eleven o'clock, and you're supposed to have
  gone to a dance with me. If you return so early from a dance your people will
  wonder, darling&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for God's sake don't keep calling me 'darling,' Louis," she exclaimed
  impatiently. "The farce is over."</p>

  <p>"Farce? You've no idea how you hurt me, Jackie, when you talk like that.
  I'm very, very fond of you. I wish you'd try to believe that. When I call you
  'darling' I mean it." He drew her to the couch and sat beside her. "You've
  been very sweet to me this evening, Jackie. I had no idea that anyone could
  ever be so wonderful, so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Appetizing?" suggested Jacqueline. "Listen, Louis, I don't want you to
  run away with any wrong impressions. What I've done this evening I've done
  because I couldn't help myself. Monty insisted on having his money. He
  actually came to the house to see Father yesterday, and the only way out of
  the mess in which I'd landed myself was to accept your beastly proposal. I
  suppose in the end I should have had to accept it in any case, because I
  could never have raised the money in any other way, and you'd have told
  Father if Monty hadn't. You'd have played your compelling tune on that theme,
  and sooner or later I should have had to dance to it. But every moment of
  this evening, Louis, I've been thinking what a septic sort of swine you are,
  and if you can get any satisfaction out of that sort of sweetness you're
  welcome to it."</p>

  <p>Louis listened placidly, with a faint smile. He was not without experience
  of these subsequent displays of nerves. He suggested a cup of coffee.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline glanced at her watch and frowned. Louis was right; it was too
  early to go home yet.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Louis. I'd like a cup of coffee."</p>

  <p>Louis rose.</p>

  <p>"Stimson is out," he said. "I thought it more discreet that he should be,
  so I gave him permission to go to the pictures after dinner. I'll make the
  coffee myself."</p>

  <p>Remembering the lipstick, Jacqueline reflected that Stimson, after several
  years in Louis Creet's service, must by now be a connoisseur of the pictures,
  but she made no comment. She nodded, and Louis went from the room.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline rose, noticed the figure of the dancing girl on the
  mantelpiece, stood for some moments gazing at it, and turned abruptly away.
  She understood now why, when she had first seen it, she had so emphatically
  disliked it. It symbolized love as Louis understood it. Louis, when he looked
  at her, saw her as that figure on the mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>She began restlessly pacing the room, chafing at the hour which must
  somehow be got through before she could go home. She must not arrive too
  soon. Her father would not go to bed much before midnight, and she shrank
  from meeting him tonight. Despite the assurance of Louis's mirror there might
  be some subtle difference in her which his keen eyes would detect. She
  wondered whether Larry would have been able to detect a difference. She felt
  sure that he would, that, even had it been possible to do so, she could never
  have looked into Larry's eyes now. If there had been the least chance of her
  ever again looking into Larry's eyes, if Larry had even been alive and there
  had been no possibility of their ever again meeting, she could never have
  done what she had done tonight. As it was, it hadn't mattered&mdash;very
  much.</p>

  <p>She took a cigarette from her case and glanced round in search of matches.
  An automatic lighter stood on the writing desk, and she crossed the room,
  seated herself in the swivel chair, and stretched out her hand for the
  lighter. Something touched her elbow, and she turned to see several sheets of
  paper from a pile on the desk go fluttering to the floor.</p>

  <p>She lighted her cigarette, rose, and began to collect the scattered
  sheets. As she retrieved the third of them, she paused, frowning, glanced at
  it again, and then, as the colour drained from her cheeks, straightened
  herself and stood staring at it with fear and bewilderment in her eyes. It
  was a cable, she realized&mdash;addressed to Louis. The message ran as
  follows:</p>

  <p class="telegram">LOCATED FIELD AMAZINGLY RICH MEET US CAPE TOWN EARLIEST
  POSSIBLE MOMENT. WIRE DA SILVA'S HOTEL LOBITO BAY. LARRY.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch08"
     name="ch08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For several minutes Jacqueline stood motionless, staring at
  the cable, conscious of nothing but the "Larry" at the end of the message.
  And then, as the significance of the word burned its way through and touched
  her understanding, her hands suddenly gripped the paper more tightly, and she
  slowly raised her head and glanced towards the door. As she did so, Louis
  came in, carrying the coffee tray.</p>

  <p>"Sorry I've been so long, darling," he began in his smooth voice, "but
  Stimson's patent percolator was inclined to be obstinate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Louis!"</p>

  <p>Her voice had a keen, cutting edge to it. Louis glanced at her quickly,
  saw her standing rigid, staring at him, turned his head abruptly, and set the
  tray on the table. He hoped she was not going to become hysterical. He picked
  up the coffee pot and turned to her with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Black or white, darling?"</p>

  <p>"Louis, I wish to God I could kill you!"</p>

  <p>Louis, meeting her glance, recognized something more than the not unusual
  nervous reaction which would eventually find relief in an outburst of tears.
  He realized that in this instance comforting words and coffee would be
  unavailing.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, Jackie?" he inquired solicitously.</p>

  <p>She strode forward.</p>

  <p>"That," she said, tossed the cable on the table, and stood gazing at him
  with a fixity which he found vaguely disconcerting.</p>

  <p>He shifted his gaze, picked up the cable and read it. Then, with raised
  eyebrows, he glanced up again.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"That cable was despatched from Benguella ten days ago.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Quite true, Jackie. But I only received it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then you knew," exclaimed Jacqueline in sudden fury. "It makes no
  difference when you received it&mdash;today, yesterday, a week ago. You
  knew&mdash;tonight&mdash;when I came here&mdash;that Larry was alive. You
  knew, and you&mdash;you didn't tell me."</p>

  <p>"I didn't tell you, Jackie, because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you think I don't know why?" she interrupted. "Two days ago I asked
  you if you had heard anything of Larry, and you said you'd had no news of him
  for six months. You did your best to make me believe that there would never
  be any news of him again. I did believe it. I'd been half believing it for
  months, and what you said convinced me that it was useless hoping any longer.
  And all the time you'd had that cable, you knew you were lying to
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear Jackie, please try to control yourself. I admit that I hesitated
  to raise false hopes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You knew," she repeated passionately. "You knew, at any rate, that Larry
  was alive, and you didn't tell me two days ago for the same reason that you
  didn't tell me tonight. You knew that if I'd had any idea that Larry was
  living, that there was the least chance of my ever seeing him again, I'd
  never have come here tonight, never have done what I have done, never have
  accepted your beastly proposal. So you didn't tell me. You wanted me and you
  meant to have me, and you didn't care how much you lied and cheated to get
  what you wanted."</p>

  <p>She paused, breathless and trembling. Louis smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>"And so you want to kill me, eh, Jackie?" He shook his head. "You're
  overlooking one or two facts, my dear, and you've said a good many things
  which I'm sure you'll regret when you're a little calmer. Naturally the news
  that Larry is still alive has been a shock to you. It was a shock to
  me&mdash;a very pleasant shock. As you know, I was very fond of
  Larry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Can't you ever stop lying? You hate Larry. You've always hated him."</p>

  <p>"And to show the violence of my hatred of him I supplied him with two
  thousand pounds for his expedition, knowing all the time that I was throwing
  away my money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You hated him," she repeated. "I'm beginning to understand things
  now&mdash;beginning to understand you. It wouldn't be you, Louis, to risk two
  thousand pounds if you couldn't see the chance of a good return for your
  money, and it wasn't friendship for Larry that prompted you to finance the
  expedition. You did it because you hated him, and you hated him because he
  was in your way."</p>

  <p>Louis smiled indulgently&mdash;a smile which suggested that the idea of
  Larry Deans being an obstacle which could seriously inconvenience Louis Creet
  was too absurd to require contradiction.</p>

  <p>"You wanted him out of your way, didn't you?" continued Jacqueline. "You
  knew that so long as Larry was in England you could never hope to get from me
  what you'd set your heart on getting. Too risky for one thing, eh, Louis?
  Larry would have been a nasty sort of customer to deal with if he had
  discovered what you were up to, wouldn't he? Besides, you knew that, with
  Larry here, I'd never have agreed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You seem to imagine, Jacqueline, that I forced Larry to go to Africa. He
  went of his own free will. It was his suggestion that I should provide the
  necessary capital&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And two thousand pounds to get him out of the country&mdash;with pretty
  long odds against his ever coming back&mdash;struck you as a good investment.
  I'm just saying that it wasn't from friendship for Larry that you did it; it
  was just a matter of business with you, Louis. And when that cable came and
  you found that Larry hadn't died on the trip as you hoped he would, that he
  was still alive and might still be in your way, you lied and cheated, didn't
  tell me and tricked me into&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Really, Jacqueline," interrupted Creet, "you must try to be reasonable.
  You're being terribly unjust and hurting me very much. Caring for you as I
  do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for God's sake, Louis, stop posing!"</p>

  <p>He shrugged.</p>

  <p>"I admit that&mdash;for various reasons&mdash;I didn't tell you that I had
  received the cable, but my reasons were not the ones you so ungenerously
  impute to me. And even if I had told you about the cable, I can't see how it
  would have altered the situation. You would still have owed Monty Can a
  thousand pounds, and it would still have been just as impossible for you to
  pay it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Larry would have helped."</p>

  <p>"Larry?" He raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" demanded Jacqueline. "You may find it hard to believe, Louis,
  but there are a few men in the world whom a girl could ask for a thousand
  pounds and not be afraid of what they'd ask in return. Larry happens to be
  one of them. If I'd cabled to him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Larry, I'm sure, would have gallantly emptied his pockets for you," said
  Creet. "But you know as well as I do, Jackie, that Larry's pockets have never
  contained much more than unpaid bills, and you've no reason for supposing
  that he's any more able to write a check for a thousand now than he ever has
  been."</p>

  <p>"But if they've found the goldfield, and if it's as rich as Larry
  says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'If they've found it and, if it's as rich as Larry says'," interrupted
  Creet. "I wouldn't build too much on that if I were you. In this sort of
  business it doesn't do to count on anything until the most careful
  examinations and tests have been made. It was because I didn't want you to
  jump to the conclusion that Larry has suddenly become a millionaire that I
  intended saying nothing about the cable until I had made further
  enquiries."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline turned away from him with a contemptuous smile.</p>

  <p>"I see," she said, seating herself on the settee.</p>

  <p>"That was terribly considerate of you, Louis. So you think that Larry,
  after all, may still be as hard up as ever?"</p>

  <p>"It remains to be seen," said Louis, with a shrug. "But if you're counting
  on Larry coming back a rich man&mdash;in a position to marry you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not," said Jacqueline. "I'm not counting on anything&mdash;now."</p>

  <p>She sat for some time gazing into the fire. She felt crushed, oppressed
  with a sense of utter futility. Even her resentment against Louis had petered
  out. Louis did not seem to matter; nothing seemed to matter; and she herself
  did not seem of the slightest consequence. She felt that nothing could ever
  matter to her again. When Louis seated himself beside her and took her hand
  in his, she gave no sign that she was aware of the action, and without
  consciously listening to him she heard all that he said and felt that it was
  all utterly unimportant. He was very fond of her, and later, of course, he
  would get his divorce and they would be married, and she would have a
  wonderful time. There was nothing he would not do for her, and she should
  never have cause to regret this evening. He was sure that they were going to
  be wonderfully happy together. And somehow it did not seem worth while to
  tell him that, once she had left his flat, she intended never to set eyes on
  him again.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she withdrew her hand and stood up.</p>

  <p>"I'm going, Louis."</p>

  <p>She went to the door and paused, hesitating. There was something she must
  say to Louis, she remembered, and the necessity of saying it repelled her.
  She searched for a phrase which would not sound too crude, some tactful
  expression which would not too shamelessly lay bare the sordidness of the
  transaction. She felt suddenly a fierce resentment against Louis for having
  left it to her to refer to the matter. He could hardly have forgotten that
  there was his side of the bargain still to be fulfilled, and he might at
  least have had the decency to spare her this final humiliation of having to
  remind him.</p>

  <p>"Louis," she said, "about&mdash;about Monty Carr. I promised
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Creet nodded, smiling.</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry about Monty, Jackie," he said. "I'll see to that in the
  morning." He rose and went to her and placed an arm round her shoulders. "You
  won't have to worry any more about anything, darling. I'm going to look after
  you now. We must manage to see more of each other than we have in the past,
  but that won't be difficult. I'll telephone you tomorrow and fix something,
  shall I?"</p>

  <p>She gazed at him with eyes that seemed frozen. It was not worth while to
  disillusion him. All that mattered was that she should go. His arm tightened
  round her shoulders, and he smiled.</p>

  <p>"Sweethearts, eh, Jackie?"</p>

  <p>As he drew her towards him she suddenly freed herself, flung open the
  door, and hurried along the corridor and out of the flat.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch09"
     name="ch09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">That night, with the door locked, Jacqueline lay in bed and
  tried to regard the events of the day from the point of view of the
  sophisticated modern young woman she considered herself to be; and as a
  sophisticated modem young woman she told herself again and again that there
  was nothing to get upset about. It had just been a business arrangement which
  she had made with her eyes wide open, and it was nobody's concern but hers.
  It was really all quite trivial and unimportant, and a girl nowadays simply
  did not make a fuss over that sort of thing and feel compelled to hide her
  face for shame. And then her thoughts turned to Larry, and she suddenly hid
  her burning cheeks in the pillow.</p>

  <p>She heard the knock on her door and her mother's voice quietly calling her
  name, but she lay very still and made no answer. She felt that she could not
  face her mother tonight. Besides, her eyes were red, and a sophisticated
  modern young woman simply does not cry.</p>

  <p>It was not until lunchtime the next day that Jacqueline unlocked her door.
  Though her mother, during the morning, knocked several times, her knocks
  remained unanswered. In the sanctuary of her bedroom she felt somehow
  detached from the rest of the world, beyond the reach of the problems and
  perplexities which, when she opened the door, would rush at her and demand to
  be dealt with. She wished she could lie there forever with a locked door
  between her and the unhappiness that awaited her outside.</p>

  <p>She awoke late, with a vague consciousness that something of tremendous
  moment had happened, something which made today altogether different from any
  other day in her life. And as she opened her eyes there came a swift rush of
  recollection which brought a smile to her lips. Larry was alive. For a time
  that stupendous fact overwhelmed all other thoughts, and she lay still,
  bright-eyed and smiling, basking in the sunshine of that knowledge. And then
  gradually, like little chilling gusts of wind, other thoughts thrust
  themselves on her attention&mdash;thoughts of Monty Carr, of Louis Creet, of
  last night, of the future&mdash;gathering force as they joined together and
  assailed her, until the storm was raging again in all its fury, tossing her
  hither and thither, battering her, deafening her. Yet in the midst of the
  turmoil, persistent as the hum note of a bell, was the thought that Larry was
  alive. She told herself that nothing else was really of the least importance.
  But she wished she were dead.</p>

  <p>Downstairs she found her father and mother in the library.</p>

  <p>"And I suppose, John," said Mrs. Thurston, as she entered, "I shall have
  to have a sun helmet, shan't I?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston glanced at Jacqueline and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Jackie! Been sleeping it off?"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline gave a shrug.</p>

  <p>"Where's Mother off to with a sun helmet?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, such wonderful news," began her mother excitedly. "It really
  does seem too good to be true&mdash;just when everything was so dreadfully
  difficult. I can hardly realize it yet."</p>

  <p>"What can't you realize, Mother?" asked Jacqueline patiently, seating
  herself on the arm of her chair.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston glanced at her husband and smiled.</p>

  <p>"It's about Larry and the others, dear," she said. "Louis has heard from
  him&mdash;a cable. They're all quite safe, and they've found the
  goldfield&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline nodded.</p>

  <p>"Louis told me&mdash;last night. Mother."</p>

  <p>"Such an anxious time," mused Mrs. Thurston. "They're all three such dear
  boys, and I'm sure they've deserved their success. But of course we mustn't
  imagine that they've all suddenly become millionaires. Louis warned us about
  that this morning. He says you never know how a goldfield will turn
  out&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Louis has been here&mdash;this morning?"</p>

  <p>"He came to tell us the news&mdash;as soon as ever he heard," said Mrs.
  Thurston. "He was very disappointed not to see you, Jackie, and to tell you
  about the trip.</p>

  <p>"Louis is off to Africa by the first available boat," explained Dr.
  Thurston. "He's a bit skeptical about the goldfield, but he's going out to
  meet Larry and the others and investigate for himself."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline breathed a sigh of relief. With Louis Creet in Africa,
  separated from her by some thousands of miles, her chief problem would
  disappear. She would not, at any rate, have to cope with it until he
  returned, and during that few months' grace anything might happen.</p>

  <p>"And what do you think, my dear?" continued her mother eagerly. "We are
  going with him."</p>

  <p>"We?" Jacqueline's eyes sought her father's anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Creet's an extraordinarily good fellow," said Dr. Thurston. "I was
  telling him about your mother having to go for a sea trip, Jacqueline, and
  saying I didn't quite know where the money was to come from, and he promptly
  suggested that we should make the trip to Africa with him as his guests."</p>

  <p>"And you accepted. Father?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, of course," said Mrs. Thurston. "Such a wonderful chance just
  when I'm being so tiresome and expensive. And it will do your father a world
  of good. He has been killing himself lately keeping other people alive who
  aren't nearly so worth keeping alive as he is, and I'm sure he'll keep them
  alive much better if he isn't so nearly dead himself. I always have said that
  most Harley Street doctors are very poor advertisements for themselves. Half
  of them look as if they don't eat enough and the other half as if they eat
  too much."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline smiled.</p>

  <p>"And you're really going&mdash;both of you?"</p>

  <p>"All three of us, Jackie," said Dr. Thurston. "The invitation includes
  you."</p>

  <p>"Such a surprise for you, dear," said Mrs. Thurston, "and a wonderful
  chance for any unmarried girl. From all I hear, a liner seems to afford such
  splendid opportunities. I believe it's actually difficult for a girl to
  escape getting engaged on a long sea trip even if she knows nobody to begin
  with, and I'm sure that with Louis travelling with us you won't be many days
  at sea without something very exciting happening. I've been telling your
  father that you must have plenty of pretty frocks...."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline did not interrupt. She waited, frowning, while her mother
  discoursed at length on the matrimonial possibilities of a voyage to South
  Africa. The great advantage of a liner, she gathered, was its profusion of
  sequestered corners which offered unequalled opportunities for sentiment in a
  romantic setting, and Louis, who had travelled a good deal, was sure to know
  all about them. Jacqueline did not doubt that. But it was only when her
  mother concluded with a thinly veiled hint that, if Louis seemed inclined to
  act as her guide to the liner's more romantic spots, she should not refuse to
  go exploring with him, that she made any comment.</p>

  <p>"In other words. Mother," she said, "you think that Louis has invited me
  to make the trip with the idea of asking me to marry him? Sorry, darling, if
  you'll be dreadfully disappointed, but I'm afraid that won't come off,
  because I'm not going with you."</p>

  <p>"But, Jacqueline," began Mrs. Thurston, "you don't mean&mdash;such a
  wonderful chance&mdash;I'm sure Louis is counting on you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline cut her short.</p>

  <p>"We'd better get this straight. Mother, once and for all," she said. "I'm
  not going with you. You seem to think that Louis has invited us all to make
  the trip so that somewhere between here and Cape Town he can sit on a coil of
  rope in the moonlight and ask me to marry him. I fancy you're wrong, because
  if Louis wanted to ask me he has had plenty of chances already, and he hasn't
  done so."</p>

  <p>"But, Jacqueline, I'm sure he's very fond&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In any case," interrupted Jacqueline, "if there's any chance of that sort
  of thing happening, I'd rather stay in England. I don't want to marry Louis,
  and I don't intend to be forced into doing so."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston's face was a study in pained surprise, and she glanced down
  at her husband as if imploring his help in dealing with a situation which was
  beyond her.</p>

  <p>"Nobody wants to force you, Jackie," said Dr. Thurston. "Creet's a good
  chap, and I fancy he's fond of you; but if he's not your choice, that settles
  it. Still there's no reason why you shouldn't make the trip, and I daresay
  Larry won't be sorry to see you again."</p>

  <p>He gave her an understanding smile, but Jacqueline shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather not. Father."</p>

  <p>"But Louis will be dreadfully disappointed," said Mrs. Thurston. "I told
  him you'd love to go, and backing out now will look very strange and
  ungrateful, and I'm sure I don't know how I can tell him."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell him myself, Mother; don't worry."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston sighed.</p>

  <p>"How can I help worrying, Jacqueline? Such a splendid chance, and such a
  pity to miss it, and I don't see what any girl could possibly have against
  Louis&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Having nothing against him, Mother, isn't much of a reason for marrying
  him."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," agreed the doctor.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston rose and retreated towards the door. And there she halted
  and fired her last shot.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget, Jacqueline," she said, "before you do anything rash, that
  Louis is a very wealthy man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That, my dear," snapped the doctor, "has nothing to do with the
  case."</p>

  <p>As the door closed behind Mrs. Thurston he went to Jacqueline, laid a hand
  on each of her shoulders, and searched her eyes with his. Jacqueline forced a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"What is it? Want to see my tongue?" she laughed. "But there's nothing
  wrong with me. Father&mdash;truly."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Jackie " said Dr. Thurston. "It's Larry, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>She avoided his gaze. Dr. Thurston smiled.</p>

  <p>"I think I'm right," he said, "and I want to tell you something,
  Jackie."</p>

  <p>She raised her head.</p>

  <p>"I want to tell you, Jackie," he said, "that in my humble opinion there
  isn't a man living as near to being worthy of you as Larry Deans."</p>

  <p>And because a sophisticated modern young woman simply does not cry or
  openly display her emotions, Jacqueline gave his arm a grateful squeeze and
  bit her lip as she turned away.</p>

  <p>Louis Creet was to dine with the Thurstons that evening to discuss
  arrangements, and it was understood that after dinner the doctor should at
  last carry out the examination which had so often been postponed.</p>

  <p>African air being densely populated with strange, unfriendly germs, Creet
  declared himself anxious to be sure of his ability to resist their onslaughts
  before venturing to breathe it into his system.</p>

  <p>But Jacqueline did not wait until the evening. The idea of a trip lasting
  several months with Louis constantly at her elbow was a disturbing one, and
  she felt that she could not rest until all chance of it had been definitely
  ruled out. She had a vague fear that unless she acted promptly her mother
  might unearth some ingeniously sentimental argument to use against her to
  which she would weakly succumb. Already, without definitely saying so, her
  mother had made her feel that she was behaving shabbily and being not a
  little selfish. She had been pathetically disappointed at her definite
  refusal to marry Louis, and Jacqueline knew from experience that when her
  mother became pathetic it was a foregone conclusion that she would get her
  own way as far as her daughter was concerned. But this time there must be no
  weakening.</p>

  <p>After lunch she telephoned to Louis.</p>

  <p>"About this trip, Louis."</p>

  <p>"Yes, darling?"</p>

  <p>"Mother says you've invited all three of us. It's really quite marvellous
  of you, Louis, but I want you to cut me out."</p>

  <p>Creet's voice had lost something of its usual smoothness when he
  answered.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid, Jackie, I can't do that."</p>

  <p>"But if I don't want to go."</p>

  <p>"I think it would be discreet, my dear, at least to pretend that you do.
  In the circumstances you could hardly expect me to go without you, and as I
  have to go, I'm counting on your being reasonable. Don't be foolish, darling.
  You'll have a wonderful time. I shall make it my business to see that you do,
  and as long as you'll be just a little kind to me sometimes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Louis, I'm not going. That's definite."</p>

  <p>For some moments he did not answer. Then:</p>

  <p>"Are you there, Jackie?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I saw Monty Carr this morning. Everything will be all right in that
  quarter now."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you paid him?"</p>

  <p>"He has promised that you shan't be troubled by him any more so long as
  you are reasonable."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline's eyes became anxious.</p>

  <p>"But you promised me, Louis, that Monty should have his
  thousand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly, Jackie," interrupted Creet. "What I said was that I would
  see that Monty Carr worried you no more about the thousand pounds, and I've
  done that. Monty will worry you no more&mdash;as long as you are
  reasonable."</p>

  <p>"As long as I'm reasonable? That's what you said before, and I don't
  understand. What exactly does 'reasonable' mean? Going with you on the trip
  to Africa? Please don't hedge, Louis. I want a straight answer."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Louis; "then I put it this way, Jackie, that, caring for
  you as I do, I don't think it's reasonable of you to ask me to leave you
  behind and not even see you for several months. Just think it over, darling,
  and I'm sure you'll see my point."</p>

  <p>"I see it now," said Jacqueline. "It's what they call double-crossing,
  isn't it? Larry was right about you, Louis; he always said you were a nasty
  bit of work, and I was fool enough not to believe him. I've kept my side of
  the bargain, and now you're backing out of yours&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You've begun to keep your side of the bargain," corrected Louis, "and as
  long as you continue to keep it I shall keep mine too. But don't let us
  quarrel about it, Jackie. Think it over, my dear, and tell me your decision
  this evening."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you now: I'm not going to be bullied and threatened and
  cheated any longer. I'm not going on the trip."</p>

  <p>"Before doing anything rash, Jackie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not going," she repeated, and slammed the receiver onto its hook.</p>

  <p>But she knew in her heart that she certainly would go.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Courtesy had to be stretched to extreme limits before one
  could confer on Da Silva's establishment in Lobito Bay the dignified title of
  "hotel." Since, however, it had to be called something it was so
  designated.</p>

  <p>A low, squat, once-white structure, it consisted of three bedrooms, a
  bathroom, and a dining-drawing-smoking-writing room, the French windows
  opening from which led onto a relatively cool and shady veranda. This was
  quite the most attractive part of the building, overlooking as it did the
  calm blue waters of the bay. Stretched in a canopied deck chair, a pipe in
  his mouth, a long, cool drink on the wicker table by his side, a man might
  without difficulty forget that for hundreds of miles behind him lay trackless
  forests and swamps, perilous enough in themselves, but doubly so by reason of
  the marauding animals which peopled them and the innumerable "bugs" of known
  and unknown viciousness which constituted an almost inescapable series of
  dangers to the explorer.</p>

  <p>The bedrooms were primitive and, save to a wearied traveller, uninviting.
  The bathroom was entitled to be so called since it held a dingy tin bath in
  which, by doubling back one's legs and bending well forward, one could just
  contrive to sit. Since, however, in such a cramped posture adequate ablutions
  were impossible, one usually ended, after one had learned its limitations by
  contortional experience, by standing up in the bath and doing as well as
  possible with a sponge.</p>

  <p>Somewhere in the nether regions of the establishment was the kitchen. Into
  this no traveller ventured, which was as well for his peace of mind; for
  culinary processes were conducted along primitive lines, and, since the place
  was alive with cockroaches, there seemed to the native cook no particular
  point in being overscrupulous about personal cleanliness; and anyway, dirt
  doesn't show on a black man. Moreover, the staple diet of the place appeared
  to be eggs, and the shell of an egg is non-porous.</p>

  <p>Piled up in a corner of the general-purposes room was an immense quantity
  of baggage, as dilapidated and dirty as only baggage can be which has
  accompanied its owners for eighteen months through the West African
  hinterland. Bedding, haversacks, water bottles, rifles, surveying
  instruments, wireless set, gramophone lay in a careless jumble, and, viewing
  it, one could almost hear the deep sighs of relief with which its owners had
  shed a burden which must have become well-nigh intolerable.</p>

  <p>It was eloquent testimony to the durability of the portable gramophone
  that it was still intact and that, with the aid of a pair of pliers and a lot
  of ingenuity, the turntable could still be persuaded to revolve.</p>

  <p>The three men who sat around the table at breakfast looked supremely
  happy. It was the first glimpse of civilized comfort that had been theirs for
  a year and a half, and they were enjoying it to the full. For two hours after
  their arrival early that morning the hotel boilers had been made to work
  overtime, and the hotel bathroom had been not so much a bathroom as a dream
  vision of paradise where one crouched or stood and wallowed in the ecstasies
  conferred by hot water and steam and soap upon those who have been denied
  such comforts for a long period.</p>

  <p>Their breakfast menu had been very minutely thought out and discussed
  during the last ten miles of their journey to the coast. The relative merits
  of breakfast cereals had formed material for argument throughout at least a
  mile and a half. Porridge, thought Tubby Storman, was filling without being
  satisfying&mdash;and who wanted to be filled before reaching the <i>pièce de
  résistance</i> of the meal, a thick, juicy steak? They were all agreed about
  this steak: it was to be tender, of the exact epicurean tinge of redness,
  and, most important of all, at least an inch thick; it was to be completely
  surrounded by potatoes fried a delicate golden brown; and while it was being
  consumed the hotel kitchen must be given up to the preparation of a second
  steak of exactly similar calibre.</p>

  <p>Toast and marmalade and coffee would of course round off the meal, after
  which, all agreed, they would begin to feel that civilization really did
  exist&mdash;a fact which they might have been forgiven for doubting during
  the past eighteen months.</p>

  <p>The agreed menu had been ordered with a wealth of detail, and now they
  were breakfasting heartily on boiled egg, which, it had transpired, was the
  only food available. Even this circumstance, however, had failed to damp
  their exuberance.</p>

  <p>"All we want now," said Tubby, pushing back his chair, "is a tune on the
  old gramophone. Why the dickens you had to bust the one and only remaining
  record, Larry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Tubby," laughed Larry. "Sanity before Art. Besides, there were the
  animals to be considered. The bearers told me that the last time you played
  'Parted' they found three lions and their families all sobbing their hearts
  out."</p>

  <p>"Still," said Tubby, "I daresay I can get another in Lobito Bay."</p>

  <p>"Which otherwise," added Mark, "is quite a pleasant sort of town. By
  Jove!" he went on, glancing round the room with obvious satisfaction, "this
  may not be the Savoy Grill, but it strikes me as a fairish imitation of
  heaven. The springboard of civilization! Have a good mail, fat boy?"</p>

  <p>Tubby's chubby pink face was wreathed in smiles.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely!" he beamed. Thrusting a hand into his pocket, he produced a
  bulky envelope. "Sixteen pages of the best, old boy. Do you know, Bunty
  writes the most marvellous letters. Listen to this: 'The dog killed three of
  the bantams last week, so I hung one of them round his neck and he hasn't
  killed a chicken since.'"</p>

  <p>"I wonder if that got into the papers?" broke in Larry.</p>

  <p>But Tubby hardly noticed the interruption and went on reading:</p>

  <p>"'There has been quite an epidemic of German measles round here, but I'm
  thankful to say that neither Alan nor Jill has caught it, though two children
  in the same class are down with it.'"</p>

  <p>"It makes you think, doesn't it?" said Mark gravely.</p>

  <p>"Well, after all, you know," replied Tubby, his face serious, "they might
  easily have got it."</p>

  <p>"Ghastly thought!" commented Larry. "Is that all the really important
  news?"</p>

  <p>"No; there's another bit somewhere. Now where was it?" Tubby glanced
  hastily through the next two pages. "Oh, yes, here we are: 'Mother has been
  poorly, but she's better now.'"</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that!" said Larry fervently. "Go on, Tubby, read us that
  bit."</p>

  <p>The other had become absorbed in the letter, which he was reading with a
  rapt expression, a smile, and a waggling head.</p>

  <p>"Don't come between husband and wife, old man," put in Mark.</p>

  <p>"I've often wondered," said Larry, "what wives really do write to their
  husbands in their looser moments. Something about chickens, I suppose."</p>

  <p>For answer the stout young man folded the letter carefully, kissed it
  solemnly, replaced it in its envelope, and put it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Does anyone know when the next boat sails for home?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not so fast, Tubby, my lad," laughed Larry. "The next boat mightn't be at
  all convenient. For one thing, Creet's not here yet. You didn't get a wire
  from him, did you, Mark?"</p>

  <p>Mark Elliott shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No. I rather expected to find him on the station platform, waving a flag.
  And a brass band wouldn't have been out of place."</p>

  <p>"I know," agreed Larry. "I wonder why he didn't turn up. Perhaps he hasn't
  arrived."</p>

  <p>"The Cape boat came in three days ago," said the other.</p>

  <p>Larry Deans's eyes suddenly lighted up.</p>

  <p>"Did it?" he asked eagerly. "Got a passenger list?"</p>

  <p>Mark shook his head and looked at the other curiously as Larry's eyes lost
  their brightness.</p>

  <p>"Are the Thurstons really coming up to this Godforsaken place?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied Larry shortly. "You fellows know as much about it
  as I do. Louis said if we could give him the approximate day he'd be here.
  Well, we gave him the approximate day and he's not here."</p>

  <p>"That's rather surprising, don't you think?" said Tubby. "Louis Creet's
  such a reliable, on-the-tick sort of bloke as a rule."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" Larry's grunt was noncommittal.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Mark, "what brought Dr. Thurston out to Cape Town. It's a
  long way from Harley Street&mdash;and pretty expensive, isn't it? Not that
  that would worry Louis, of course: he's a generous old devil."</p>

  <p>"Isn't he!" replied Larry with a cynical smile. "I don't know any man who
  gives away a two-bob cigar with greater gusto. But if you'd ever tried to
  borrow a hundred from him&mdash;without security&mdash;you might change your
  opinions."</p>

  <p>"Oh, rot!" exclaimed Tubby. "Louis is one of the best fellows in the
  world. You're a cynical old devil, Larry."</p>

  <p>"Maybe," the older man agreed. "But cynicism is the most valuable product
  of experience, my boy, as you will discover. And by the way, talking of
  discoveries, I don't want Louis to know about that brilliant piece of
  exploration of yours which resulted in our finding the causeway."</p>

  <p>The other two men glanced at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord&mdash;why not?" asked Mark.</p>

  <p>Larry's voice was quiet and dispassionate, but emphatic.</p>

  <p>"We'll give Louis a plan of the field, of course, but I suggest that we
  keep that little causeway to ourselves."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear old chap," exploded Tubby, "we can't do that sort of thing.
  After all, we must play the game. I mean, we are gentlemen."</p>

  <p>Larry smiled rather grimly.</p>

  <p>"You and Mark are, Tubby, and so perhaps am I, but most certainly Louis
  isn't."</p>

  <p>Mark Elliott's forehead was puckered in a frown.</p>

  <p>"All the same, Larry," he protested, "I must say I agree with Tubby. I
  think we should tell Louis all there is to know. He has as much right to know
  about the causeway as we have. He's a partner in the firm."</p>

  <p>Larry shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Have it your own way," he said. "I'll tell you something you don't know.
  This is the third attempt I've made at finding this goldfield. The first time
  I broke myself; the second time I broke most of my relations. The third time
  I don't want anybody to break me."</p>

  <p>"It's rather extraordinary," mused Mark, "that nobody ever found the place
  before."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know, you know." Tubby grinned complacently. "After all, this
  is the first time I've been out here. These other fellows may have been all
  right, but when it comes to finding a causeway&mdash;well, you see what I
  mean, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Sock him one, Mark&mdash;you're nearer," urged Larry. "Just because his
  fat tummy overbalanced him and he fell into a swamp.... No, there have been
  all sorts of stories about these diggings, but most of the clever people
  thought they were moonshine. Well, we've found them! My God! I can't let
  myself think about it! Eighteen months, eh? A lifetime! Remember the night we
  left this filthy hotel to go to the railhead?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," supplemented Mark, "and how cocksure everybody was that the field
  was in Katanga and not in Angola at all."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to rename my house Angola," announced Tubby.</p>

  <p>"What do you call it now?" asked Mark.</p>

  <p>"'Mon Repos,' for a quid," laughed Larry.</p>

  <p>"I'll take you, Larry," said Mark. "'The Acacias.'"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely wrong, old boy," said Tubby. "It's called 'The Cedars.'"</p>

  <p>For a few minutes they sat in silence, each absorbed with his own
  thoughts, his own visions of the future, his plans, his hopes&mdash;and, in
  the case of Larry Deans, his fears.</p>

  <p>"All the same, I wish we had a contract." He spoke half to himself.</p>

  <p>Tubby, young and impetuous, could not restrain his impatience.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Larry, what's biting you? I wouldn't have your suspicious
  mind for anything. What on earth do you want a contract for? A fellow's word
  is his bond, and Louis isn't the kind of man who would dream of breaking it.
  Besides, we practically did make a contract. That letter he wrote to
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Was full of pious hopes," interrupted Larry.</p>

  <p>Tubby half rose from his chair and thumped the table with his fist.</p>

  <p>"But, damn it, man! I got it stamped at Somerset House."</p>

  <p>The other smiled.</p>

  <p>"My dear young and very innocent child, if you took a prescription for a
  Seidlitz powder to Somerset House they'd stamp it and be glad to take your
  money."</p>

  <p>Mark Elliott, who had been sitting, one hand on his chin, a puzzled frown
  on his forehead, now broke in:</p>

  <p>"Larry, old man, you're putting all sorts of ungentlemanly thoughts into
  my head. You don't really mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course Larry doesn't mean anything. If he does he's an ass.
  Personally, I like old Louis. Mind you, he's not the sort of fellow, if I
  were going away, that I'd ask to look after my wife."</p>

  <p>The cynical smile reappeared on Larry's face.</p>

  <p>"I'd say not&mdash;or even your chickens!"</p>

  <p>"It's queer how women run after him," said Mark. "You wouldn't call him
  good-looking."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Mark!" laughed Larry. "You've a lot to learn about women. Good
  looks don't mean a thing to them; their instinct is a great deal more subtle
  than that. No, you don't have to be good-looking if you're a man. And anyhow,
  if a woman had to wait till an Adonis came along she'd starve. And women
  don't make a habit of starving. A woman knows just what it is that attracts
  her in a man&mdash;but she won't admit it."</p>

  <p>"'Soured by the Jungle,'" murmured Tubby, who had an occasional provoking
  habit of thinking in subtitles.</p>

  <p>There came a knock on the door, and a native servant appeared, carrying a
  telegram, which he handed to Larry. He tore open the envelope and read the
  contents.</p>

  <p>"0h, damn! We passed the station&mdash;they are at Benguella. 'Sorry,
  missed you by five minutes. Have taken commandant's house here. Coming over
  by car to bring you back.'"</p>

  <p>"Who is it from?" asked Tubby.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Thurston."</p>

  <p>"So she's here!" said Mark. "Good. The doctor's with her, of course. Have
  they brought Jacqueline?"</p>

  <p>"I've read you the telegram," Larry answered laconically.</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll be seeing old Louis very soon now. I suppose he's with
  them&mdash;she'd have said so if he wasn't." A worried expression flitted
  across Tubby's face as he turned to Larry Deans. "You know, old man, it's an
  awful pity you feel the way you do about Louis. I happen to know he's got a
  terribly high opinion about you.</p>

  <p>Larry grinned.</p>

  <p>"If this were America I should probably say, 'Aw, shucks!' And if I wanted
  to be coarse I'd say his opinion of me is so high that it stinks."</p>

  <p>Tubby, intent on peacemaking, continued:</p>

  <p>"Anyway, he has. And Jacqueline thinks the world of him."</p>

  <p>A deep frown gathered on Larry's face.</p>

  <p>"Jacqueline is very young and therefore very stupid and very
  impressionable," he declared irritably. "And Louis Creet is the kind of man
  that any young, impressionable, and foolish girl would think the world of.
  You yourself said just now you wouldn't care to leave your wife in his
  charge."</p>

  <p>Tubby hesitated, momentarily at a loss.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," Larry went on. "Your wife is neither young nor foolish nor
  impressionable. She's got terrible taste in the matter of husbands, but
  otherwise she's an intelligent woman."</p>

  <p>"But Jacqueline is only a kid," protested Tubby.</p>

  <p>"Cleopatra was fourteen when she had her first love affair," Larry
  remarked drily.</p>

  <p>"Climate, old boy," said Tubby. "I remember reading about that. They get
  old much younger in that climate, if you see what I mean. All I know is that
  if I were engaged to a lovely young girl like Jacqueline&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Larry made a quick gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"I'm not engaged to her," he explained. "I am merely engaged to be engaged
  to her, which is not quite the same thing. Louis may be as generous as you
  say, but I wish his generosity would take another form. However, don't let's
  talk about it any more. Where are the cigarettes?"</p>

  <p>Tubby heaved a deep sigh and produced his case.</p>

  <p>"As usual, I've got 'em. It's an astonishing thing that throughout this
  trip all the incidental expenditure seems to have devolved upon me.
  'Financial Director, Percy H. Storman,' as it were."</p>

  <p>Larry took a cigarette from the case, lit it, and gazed in apparent awe at
  the speaker.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he gasped. "Percy&mdash;and I never knew it!"</p>

  <p>Evading the wrathful Tubby's grabbing movement, he strolled out through
  the French windows onto the veranda and sank into a deck chair.</p>

  <p>Mark turned to Tubby, and his tone was serious.</p>

  <p>"Look here, old man, don't get funny with Larry about Jacqueline. I happen
  to know that it's a sore point."</p>

  <p>"But it's so darn silly," expostulated the other. "And I can't believe
  that Larry's right about Louis. Good Lord! Why, I've known him for years and
  he's one of the best&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," murmured Mark, "I'm just beginning to wonder
  myself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, forget it!" Tubby burst out. "Why spoil a beautiful day? Here we are
  home&mdash;or practically home&mdash;after a perfectly ghastly time, with our
  health and strength and with money to burn. 'Fighting the Forest for
  Fortune.'"</p>

  <p>Mark Elliott was looking very thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"I hope SO," he said at last. "Tubby, do you know anything about the
  mining laws of Portuguese West Africa?"</p>

  <p>"No. What have the laws to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"A lot, probably. I was talking to Larry in the train. He says the
  concession we've got is to find the field, not to work it. There won't, of
  course, be any difficulty about getting the other concession, though we'll
  have to pay a percentage to the government, but first of all we shall have to
  prove proprietorial rights."</p>

  <p>"Sounds a bit long," said Tubby, "but we'll do that all right, won't
  we?"</p>

  <p>Mark was silent for a long time. Larry's hints about Louis Creet's real
  character had been germinating in his naturally acute mind, and he was
  beginning to feel distinctly uneasy about the whole position. Gentlemen's
  agreements were all very well&mdash;between gentlemen. But supposing Larry
  were right? And even gentlemanly instincts had been known to suffer
  repression when an immense fortune was at stake. He too was beginning to wish
  that they had insisted upon a contract defining their exact rights in
  whatever discovery they made.</p>

  <p>"Won't we?" repeated Tubby.</p>

  <p>"I suppose we can," said Mark half-heartedly. "But you understand what I
  mean, don't you?" He turned to face the other squarely and spoke with
  meaningful deliberation. "If Louis can prove that we were working for him on
  a salary, simply as his employees, we shouldn't have a shadow of a claim to
  any share in the goldfield. Try to get that into your nut, Tubby."</p>

  <p>Tubby made an obvious effort. He furrowed his forehead with a heavy frown,
  scratched his head vigorously, and assumed an expression of intense
  concentration. And then his face cleared.</p>

  <p>"But he couldn't prove it, Mark, old man," he said. "That's where Larry
  keeps slipping up all the time. He absolutely couldn't prove anything of the
  sort."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't he?" Larry, strolling in from the veranda, gave Tubby a pitying
  smile. "You've a beautifully trustful nature, Tubby, and I hate to soil it
  with suspicion of your brother man; but if Louis wanted to he wouldn't find
  it particularly difficult to make out a case that we were engaged on a
  monthly salary. It's in your precious contract, anyway&mdash;stamped at
  Somerset House and all."</p>

  <p>"But he explained that," protested Tubby. "He said he'd arranged things
  that way to protect us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can take it from me," interrupted Larry, "that he arranged things
  that way because what he doesn't know about the laws of this God-forsaken
  country isn't worth knowing. Louis was protecting himself, not us. It seems
  to me that if Louis feels like doing it he can sail off with all the plunder
  comfortably close to the wind, and all we can do is to stand on the seashore
  and gnash our teeth."</p>

  <p>"But he wouldn't feel like it, old boy," said Tubby doggedly. "That's my
  point all the time, and it seems pretty rotten to me to keep talking about
  old Louis as if he lay awake at nights scheming how he can swindle us. Old
  Louis has been very decent to me one way and another. Last Christmas, for
  instance, he sent the kids about twenty quids' worth of toys, and invited
  Bunty to go up and stay at his place in town, and if you ask me there isn't
  much wrong with a bloke who does that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>Larry smiled.</p>

  <p>"I wonder, Mark," he said, "whether our fat boy is a damned fool or just
  has a beautiful mind. Did Bunty accept the invitation, Tubby?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, she didn't," said Tubby. "It was the time of the
  measles scare, and she couldn't."</p>

  <p>"Congratulations!" said Larry. "I don't suppose it has ever occurred to
  you, Tubby, but every night of your life you should, when you say your
  prayers, say, 'Thank God for measles!'"</p>

  <p>Tubby flushed.</p>

  <p>"Seems to me, Larry," said Mark, "that two or three tabloids of quinine
  wouldn't do you any harm."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," agreed Tubby. "Get it out of your system, old boy."</p>

  <p>Larry gave a shrug.</p>

  <p>"It's not fever," he said; "it's just bad temper. I shall be much more
  lovable when I've seen Louis and discovered what I'm up against."</p>

  <p>He took the telegram from his pocket and reread it.</p>

  <p>"This was handed in three hours ago," he said irritably, "and if they're
  coming by car they should be here now. All this hanging about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Puncture," suggested Mark. "I've heard a rumour that the only car that
  ever got here without a puncture is now preserved in a museum."</p>

  <p>"If you ask me, it's ignition trouble," grinned Tubby. "While the
  chauffeur was admiring the scenery of his native country, Louis Creet, the
  notorious pickpocket, nipped out of the car and pinched a sparking
  plug&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Larry strode impatiently onto the veranda and, leaning his elbows on the
  rail, stood gazing along the road.</p>

  <p>Mark turned to Tubby.</p>

  <p>"If the governor is at Benguella, Tubby, we ought to see him tomorrow," he
  said. "This thing's getting on Larry's nerves, and the sooner we fix it the
  better."</p>

  <p>Tubby nodded.</p>

  <p>"'Noble Character Warped by Suspicion,'" he said. "All that about
  Jacqueline! Tommy-rot if you ask me."</p>

  <p>"Is it?" Mark shrugged. "I had a mail, too, Tubby, and I'm not so sure.
  Listen to this."</p>

  <p>He pulled a crumpled letter from his pocket and smoothed it out.</p>

  <p>"'Saw Jacqueline Thurston at the Café de Paris last night,'" he read.
  "'She was with your friend Creet. I've seen them together half a dozen times
  in the last fortnight. Terribly friendly, my dear. I wonder! People are
  wondering, too'."</p>

  <p>Larry came striding in from the balcony.</p>

  <p>"There's a car coming now," he announced and disappeared through the
  door.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dr. Thurston found the sixty-mile car drive from Benguella
  to Lobito Bay something of an ordeal. An air of depression seemed to have
  descended on the other members of the party as soon as they had set out, and
  after a few fruitless efforts to entice into conversation first his wife,
  then Jacqueline, then Louis Creet, and finally the native chauffeur, who
  spoke no English, he abandoned his efforts at sociability, lighted a cigar,
  and fell to wondering what had bitten everyone this morning.</p>

  <p>Creet, resplendent in a semitropical suit which was beyond criticism, was
  frowning heavily beneath his sun helmet. Throughout the voyage he had been
  inclined to be irritable, and since they had landed he had been definitely
  moody and bad-tempered. Jackie's fault, the doctor reflected. She had led him
  a fine dance, the young devil, one way and another during the trip&mdash;her
  shameless flirtation with the chief engineer had been conducted entirely, he
  was sure, for the edification of Louis&mdash;and if Louis had counted on
  pulling it off with Jackie before reaching Africa he was probably feeling
  decidedly sore.</p>

  <p>Just as well, perhaps, that he hadn't pulled it off. Too old, really, for
  Jackie. Well preserved, but he couldn't be less than forty-eight or fifty.
  Queer sort of chap in some ways. All that fussing about his health. He had a
  supply of quinine in his luggage large enough to purge the whole African
  continent of malaria, and every night he took his temperature and entered it
  on a chart. He was a common enough type of hypochondriac, of
  course&mdash;convinced that he was the victim of some disease, yet funking an
  examination which might confirm his fears. It had not been entirely
  disinterested generosity that had prompted him to bring them all on this
  trip. Louis, where Jacqueline was concerned, obviously was not disinterested;
  and among the plagues and pestilences of West Africa he would doubtless feel
  less uneasy with a qualified medical man constantly at hand....</p>

  <p>"Such an adventure!" exclaimed Mrs. Thurston suddenly. "Actually in
  Africa! It hardly seems possible, does it?"</p>

  <p>"No, Mother," agreed Jacqueline dutifully.</p>

  <p>And Mrs. Thurston, having for the fourth time in the last two hours made
  exactly the same remark and thus contributed her share to the gaiety of the
  occasion, returned to her thoughts.</p>

  <p>They were not cheerful ones. The voyage, of course, had done her a lot of
  good&mdash;she was quite herself again now, thank goodness&mdash;but it had
  been a great disappointment to her. In spite of Jacqueline's emphatic
  rejection of Louis as a possible husband, she had been hoping that, with all
  the amenities of a liner at his disposal, Louis might persuade her to change
  her mind before they reached Africa. After all, she had been just as emphatic
  in her refusal to go on the voyage at all, and Louis had persuaded her over
  that without much difficulty.</p>

  <p>But nothing had happened, and it was all very disappointing, and it was no
  use counting on the voyage home, because Jacqueline would have met Larry
  again before then. Of course, she had nothing against Larry. He was a dear
  boy, and if he really had found a gold-field and was going to be a
  millionaire and able to pay off all those dreadful debts of his...</p>

  <p>She glanced at Jacqueline and sighed. It was always difficult to know what
  Jacqueline was thinking. She was dreadfully baffling.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline at the moment would have baffled a far keener observer than her
  mother. She sat in the corner of the car with an air of complete detachment
  from her surroundings, a slight pucker between her eyebrows. She did not in
  the least suggest to Mrs. Thurston a girl just about to meet a long-lost
  lover who had found a goldfield and was, perhaps, a millionaire.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline, however, was thinking of Larry. During the voyage she had
  thought a good deal about him, alone in one or other of the liner's
  sequestered corners which Mrs. Thurston had hoped she would use to better
  advantage. Larry, she had decided, must not be allowed to get an inkling of
  the truth. That was definite; and, that being so, she must make him realize
  that she was not prepared to reinstate him on the intimate footing on which
  he had been with her before he had left England. Somehow she must erect
  barriers and keep Larry outside them. He must, she felt, either know
  everything or know nothing; and she could never tell him everything.</p>

  <p>With the meeting with Larry still several weeks ahead she had persuaded
  herself without much difficulty that by the time she reached Africa she would
  have so steeled herself that she would be able to face the occasion with a
  casual self-assurance which would at any rate pass muster; but this morning,
  when she was actually on her way to Lobito Bay and there was nothing to
  distract her mind from the realization that every minute was bringing the
  moment of their meeting nearer, she was less confident of her ability to
  carry it off with an air of casual self-assurance. She was not sure that she
  would be able, after all, to meet Larry's glance without flinching, and so to
  cloak her feelings that Larry's keen scrutiny would not lay them bare. She
  had an uneasy feeling that, no matter what barriers she might erect between
  Larry and their old intimacy, Larry would come crashing through them. It
  would be very difficult to make her eyes lie to him.</p>

  <p>As the car stopped outside Da Silva's Hotel she saw Larry come striding
  towards her, and the next moment her hand was in his and she was smiling at
  him as he lolled against the car, meeting his glance without wavering. At the
  moment her sole thought was that it was marvellous to be with Larry again, to
  see the little lines round his eyes and mouth crease into the familiar smile,
  to feel him playing with her little finger&mdash;which was a trick of
  his&mdash;while he spoke to her. The wonder of being with him again excluded
  all other thoughts and feelings; her eyes held only gladness, and there was
  no need to censor the message which they gave him.</p>

  <p>She scarcely noticed the others. She was aware that Mark Elliott and Tubby
  Storman were there, that Mark had a beard which made him look like a
  newspaper caricature of a Bolshevik, that everyone was talking at once,
  including her mother, whose "Such an adventure!" regularly punctuated the
  conversation; but it was all indistinct and unreal to her. Only Larry,
  bending and straightening her little finger, was real.</p>

  <p>He helped her from the car and stood a few paces away from her, regarding
  her appraisingly, smiling.</p>

  <p>"I've kept a mental picture of you all these months, Jackie," he
  explained. "I'm just checking the details and testing its accuracy."</p>

  <p>"Have I changed, Larry?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"There are one or two points where it differs from the original."</p>

  <p>Creet grasped her elbow and urged her towards the hotel.</p>

  <p>"Come along in, my dear," he said. "You mustn't stand about out here in
  the sun."</p>

  <p>She was about to move away when she caught the look of amusement in
  Larry's eyes and paused.</p>

  <p>"All right, Louis," she said, releasing her arm. "I'll be along in a few
  minutes. I want to talk to Larry."</p>

  <p>"You can talk to Larry just as well inside, my dear," said Creet, "and I
  should much prefer, as you have no sun helmet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've a sun-proof lining to my hat, Louis. Please don't fuss. Larry and I
  haven't seen each other for over a year."</p>

  <p>"That is no reason why he should allow you to run the risk of sunstroke,"
  said Creet, with a touch of impatience. "I shall feel much happier about
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jackie has travelled sixty miles in an open car, Louis&mdash;presumably
  hired by you&mdash;and come to no harm," said Larry, "so there's no need to
  be over-anxious about an extra five minutes."</p>

  <p>Louis hesitated, frowning; and then, with a shrug, he turned and strode
  after the others into the hotel. Larry smiled.</p>

  <p>"A little late to remember the risk of sunstroke," he said. "He should
  have thought of something better than that."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Louis is terribly fussy," she said, "but he means well, and it's no use
  getting irritated. He's been most frightfully kind&mdash;to Father and
  Mother. Giving them this trip, I mean. It must be costing him a small
  fortune."</p>

  <p>"The mystery deepens, Jackie."</p>

  <p>"Mystery?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Louis doesn't give; he invests. I'd be interested to know what return
  he's expecting on this trip."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't sound very generous, Larry," said Jacqueline. "Mother had to
  have a sea voyage, and Father was at his wit's end to find the money, and
  Louis was an absolute godsend."</p>

  <p>Larry smiled.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Heaven was hard up for messengers, Jackie," he laughed. "Still,
  I'm glad he was kind&mdash;to your mother. I suppose there must be some good
  in a man if he's kind to somebody's mother."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline frowned.</p>

  <p>"What exactly have you got against Louis?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly? Nothing&mdash;at present."</p>

  <p>"Then it's hardly fair to keep on making rather cheap insinuations about
  him, is it? After all, he's been very generous to you. He told me that he
  provided two thousand pounds to make it possible for you to undertake the
  expedition&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And in return for this two thousand, Jackie, he's got a quarter share in
  a goldfield which is probably worth millions. Not much generosity there."</p>

  <p>"But he didn't know you'd find the goldfield. You told me yourself before
  you left England that the odds were all against your finding it, and Louis
  knew that, too. You say that he only invests his money when he sees the
  prospect of a good return for it, yet he risked two thousand pounds on a
  hundred-to-one chance of your finding a goldfield&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Larry was shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"You don't believe that, Jackie, any more than I do, and you're making a
  poorish show at pretending you do. You never were much good as a liar. I know
  why Louis put up the two thousand, and so do you."</p>

  <p>"Is this another rather cheap insinuation, Larry?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer that directly.</p>

  <p>"Tell me something, will you?" he said. "Has Louis asked you to marry
  him?"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"Does Louis strike you as a marrying sort?"</p>

  <p>"Then he hasn't?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Damn!" said Larry.</p>

  <p>She glanced at him quickly, surprised.</p>

  <p>"You hoped he would ask me, Larry?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid he hadn't," he said. "Let's get inside."</p>

  <p>He grasped her elbow and led her into the hotel.</p>

  <p>They found the others grouped around the table, at which stood Tubby, with
  a box of earth in front of him, delivering something in the nature of a
  lecture to the tinny accompaniment of the gramophone.</p>

  <p>"All I'm saying, Louis, old boy," he was declaring, "is that it makes you
  think. You see what I mean, Mrs. Thurston, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"So romantic," exclaimed Mrs. Thurston.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what I'm getting at," said Tubby. "The very word, Mrs. Thurston;
  it's romantic. Here's this box filled, as far as you can see, with nothing
  but the stuff you scrape off your boots before stepping on the carpet, yet
  concealed in this common or garden substance, lurking, so to speak, in the
  loam, undiscerned by the naked eye&mdash;Hullo, Jackie! Now you're here I'll
  begin again, shall I?"</p>

  <p>"All about the gold, Tubby?"</p>

  <p>"He's just coming to the gold," said Mark. "But it would probably be
  quicker to fetch some from the gold-field. To cut Tubby's long story short,
  Louis, the field is amazingly rich."</p>

  <p>Louis nodded, smiling.</p>

  <p>"I can't quite grasp it yet," he said. "I suppose it is true?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely beyond all doubt, old man," Tubby assured him. "We've got maps
  and plans and what not to show you."</p>

  <p>"One patch we prospected," added Mark, "has thirty per cent. of gold.
  Thirty per cent.! You couldn't take a shovelful out of the ground&mdash;it
  was too heavy."</p>

  <p>"Incredible!" exclaimed Louis.</p>

  <p>"As one geologist to another, old boy," said Tubby, "I don't mind telling
  you it's more than incredible. It's absolutely&mdash;absolutely
  unbelievable."</p>

  <p>"Quite sure it <i>is</i> gold, Tubby?" laughed Dr. Thurston.</p>

  <p>"It's gold right enough," said Mark. "I had the dubious advantage of a
  scientific education. Doctor, and I know just about enough of metallurgy to
  distinguish gold from iron filings."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely genuine twenty-two carat hallmarked gold," said Tubby. "We've
  brought back a hundred pounds of it, and we could have brought a ton."</p>

  <p>"A hundred pounds?" Dr. Thurston wrinkled his forehead, calculating.
  "That's about eight thousand pounds' worth, Tubby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I say, is it?" said Tubby in an awed voice. "As a matter of fact, we
  didn't work it out down to the shillings and pence."</p>

  <p>"Eight thousand pounds is about right," said Louis.</p>

  <p>"In other words, Louis," remarked Larry, "we've brought back about four
  times as much gold as the expedition cost."</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Louis's lips.</p>

  <p>"And rather more than ten times as much gold as you're allowed to bring
  back without a license," he said.</p>

  <p>"Is that the law?" asked Mark.</p>

  <p>Louis nodded.</p>

  <p>"You may prospect without a license," he said, "but you may not mine.
  Eight thousand pounds' worth of gold is mining. If you take my advice you'll
  keep that bit of information to yourselves. We'll get the gold to Benguella,
  and I'll take it down to Cape Town with me."</p>

  <p>Larry caught Mark's eye and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Pretty well up in the law, Louis, aren't you?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Pretty well up in it," said Creet suavely. "I've read it up. I never
  guess, you know. I didn't make my money by guessing; I made it on my
  knowledge of facts and how to use them." He glanced at Larry with amused
  eyes. "Guessing gets you nowhere, Larry," he said; "you've got to be dead
  sure."</p>

  <p>Tubby grinned.</p>

  <p>"From Lift-boy to Millionaire,'" he said. "'Dramatic Rise to Fame and
  Fortune.' 'Guessing's no good,' says Louis Creet. As one director of a
  goldfield to another, Louis, I don't mind admitting that when it comes to
  legal matters I don't know an 'aforesaid' from a 'notwithstanding.'"</p>

  <p>"And talking of directors," said Larry, "the sooner we four have a
  business talk and get things straight, the better. Anything wrong with
  now?"</p>

  <p>"My dear chap!" protested Louis. "There's no immediate hurry. We can talk
  business tomorrow. We've only just arrived from a very tiring journey."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sorry," said Larry. "Mark and Tubby and I have been sleeping on beds
  of roses, and I was forgetting the hardships of a stateroom."</p>

  <p>"Such a beautiful bungalow," said Mrs. Thurston. "It's the commandant's,
  you know, and we've rented it for our stay in Benguella, and you're all
  coming back to stay with us, so you can have a regular business meeting in
  the morning."</p>

  <p>"And before we go," said Dr. Thurston, "what about lunch? I suppose Lobito
  Bay can produce something fit to eat, can't it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely, Doctor," said Tubby. "Eggs!"</p>

  <p>During the drive back to Benguella, Jacqueline was no less baffling than
  she had been on the outward journey, and though her mother several times
  brought Larry's name into the conversation, in what she flattered herself was
  a very tactful way, she elicited neither word nor look that gave her the
  information she wanted. Jacqueline, since her five minutes' chat with Larry
  that morning, had avoided being alone with him. He had asked her to let him
  drive her back to Benguella in the car which he had hired for the trip, and
  she had excused herself on the plea that she must be with her mother. Larry
  had smiled at that&mdash;that amused smile of his which told her as clearly
  as possible that he saw through her lame excuse. But she felt that a three
  hours' journey with Larry probing as he had probed this morning was more than
  she could face. The probing, of course, would have to be faced sooner or
  later, but she was thankful for every hour of delay.</p>

  <p>That evening, after dinner, she was grateful to Louis when he seated
  himself at the piano and suggested that she should sing. She sang, song after
  song, with an anxious eye on her watch, only eager to prolong the singing
  until she could reasonably excuse herself and go to bed. And all the time she
  was singing, Larry sat watching her with that faint smile of amusement which
  gave her an uneasy feeling that he had seen through her pitiful little
  subterfuge.</p>

  <p>And then, as she finished a song&mdash;it was "Parted," by special request
  of Tubby&mdash;Larry rose and crossed to the piano.</p>

  <p>"Someone else's turn, Jackie," he said. "You've done more than your
  share."</p>

  <p>"But Larry, I'm not a bit tired&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Louis is," said Larry. "He has just finished a very tiring journey. Come
  and see the commandant's garden."</p>

  <p>He slipped a hand under her arm and led her out through the French
  windows. It was a night of moonlight and magic, and as they rounded the
  corner of the bungalow she paused with a little gasp of wonder.</p>

  <p>"Larry!" she exclaimed. "Can you think of anything more marvellous?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Jackie," he said; "Piccadilly Circus with the electric signs all
  working. But we won't argue about it. Tell me what's wrong with you."</p>

  <p>"Wrong?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"You're not yourself."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline sighed. If only, just for a little time, she could be somebody
  else!</p>

  <p>"I've a bit of a headache, Larry; that's all."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Rotten, darling," he said. "Headaches have been overdone and are almost
  as suspicious as dead grandmothers on Derby day. Try again."</p>

  <p>"But, Larry, I really have a headache&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shall I fetch you an aspirin?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head quickly.</p>

  <p>"Worse and worse, darling," said Larry. "You wouldn't shake your head like
  that if you really had a headache. What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, Larry. Don't be Creetish."</p>

  <p>"God forbid!"</p>

  <p>"You're fussing and imagining there's something wrong with me when there
  isn't&mdash;just like Louis."</p>

  <p>"Then if there's nothing wrong, Jackie, why the splendid isolation? All
  this keep-your-distance stuff. It isn't like you. You've been sort
  of&mdash;skulking ever since we met this morning. Why?"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Hasn't it struck you, Larry, that meeting you again&mdash;after not
  seeing you for a year&mdash;I might feel&mdash;well, a bit awkward?"</p>

  <p>"A year?" said Larry. "Is that all? It seems much more than a year. But
  it's not just awkwardness or shyness, Jackie. There's something else.
  You're&mdash;different." He regarded her thoughtfully. "It's difficult to
  explain, but you're somehow giving me the feeling that we haven't been
  properly introduced."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's all rather&mdash;rather strange, Larry. After all this
  time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't seem strange to me, Jackie," said Larry. "Queer&mdash;damned
  queer; but not strange. Perhaps I expected too much. I've been rather looking
  forward to today, you know, and somehow the tremendous occasion has gone a
  bit flat. You haven't, for instance, kissed me, and I haven't asked you to,
  because you've somehow made me feel that you don't want me to. Something
  seems to have come unstuck somewhere&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused, and the troubled look in his eyes hurt her. She glanced quickly
  away.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, Larry," she laughed. "And for heaven's sake let's stop
  trying to psycho-analyze me. Did you have a tremendously interesting
  time?"</p>

  <p>Larry gave that amused, rather cynical smile of his.</p>

  <p>"I see," he said. "Let's be formal, by all means. Quite an interesting
  time, thank you, Miss Thurston. And how have you been progressing with your
  singing?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be an ass, Larry! But since you've enquired, the singing has been
  going splendidly. Caballero says I've a really good voice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Caballero? Oh, damn!"</p>

  <p>"Why damn that, Larry?"</p>

  <p>"Just childish petulance," he shrugged. "I'd been planning that when I
  came back gorged with gold I'd send you to Caballero. Isn't he terribly
  expensive?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I believe&mdash;I really don't know. Louis gave me the lessons with
  Caballero&mdash;as a birthday present."</p>

  <p>Larry frowned.</p>

  <p>"Any objections, Larry?"</p>

  <p>"To Caballero? Good Lord, no!"</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"If we're going to quarrel," she said, "we'd better do it and get it over.
  What's next?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Larry, "since you've asked me, you'll forgive me, won't you,
  for remarking that you seem rather expensively arrayed? Has the doctor been
  making a lot of money?"</p>

  <p>"Really, Larry " she began, and paused. "You must have frocks for a trip
  like this," she went on. "You can't travel first class on a liner with a
  tweed skirt and a couple of jumpers. Father of course had to buy me
  some."</p>

  <p>"And the others, Jackie? You've only had one birthday since I left, you
  know."</p>

  <p>He half turned from her and stood silent for some moments, passing a hand
  across his forehead as if trying to wipe away the thoughts that troubled
  him.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he exclaimed suddenly, turning to her. "You and
  I&mdash;talking to each other like this&mdash;it's perfectly damned awful,
  isn't it? You haven't been messing about on the Stock Exchange and losing
  money again, have you? That isn't the trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Larry, do try to get it out of your head that there's any trouble."</p>

  <p>"Your letters," said Larry. "There were several waiting for me when I got
  back. It was funny reading them. Each month they got more and more suitable
  to be read out at a mothers' meeting."</p>

  <p>"What sort of letters did you expect, Larry?"</p>

  <p>Larry gave a rather wry smile.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. What does a fellow expect from a girl he's&mdash;well, not
  engaged to, but fond of? A girl he believes is fond of him, too. Ever write
  to Louis, Jackie?"</p>

  <p>"0f course I've written notes to Louis&mdash;lots of times."</p>

  <p>"In the same mothers'-meeting style?"</p>

  <p>"About dinners and things."</p>

  <p>"Took you around a good deal, eh&mdash;dinners and parties and that sort
  of thing?"</p>

  <p>"Quite a lot, Larry&mdash;yes. Louis has been tremendously kind to all of
  us. Bringing us on this trip, for instance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Was being tremendously kind to himself as well," said Larry. "Much too
  long to go without seeing you."</p>

  <p>"Why must you talk like this?" said Jacqueline. "Louis -"</p>

  <p>"Oh, curse Louis!" exclaimed Larry. "For heaven's sake, forget him!"</p>

  <p>"Then it is Louis that's making you treat me so&mdash;so differently?"</p>

  <p>"Do you really want me to answer that?" He shook his head. "Of course you
  don't. Has Louis ever kissed you?"</p>

  <p>She was very near to tears. The probing was more painful than she had
  expected. Suddenly it became more painful than she could bear.</p>

  <p>"Really, Larry," she exclaimed angrily, "I don't see why I should stand
  here and be catechized and cross-examined. You have absolutely no
  right&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, of course not. Sorry," said Larry.</p>

  <p>"You're just being very stupid and unreasonable."</p>

  <p>"Unreasonable? Listen, Jackie. All these months I've been thinking a good
  deal about you. We didn't have dances and parties in the forest to pass the
  time away. It wasn't terribly bad, but it wasn't terribly good, and one
  naturally did a good deal of thinking. I had some fever, and that didn't
  improve matters&mdash;I'm not angling for sympathy, Jackie, so don't look at
  me as though I were a poor brave thing. I just want you to realize that when
  a man has been thinking like that about a girl, and she's&mdash;well,
  tremendously important, it's naturally rather upsetting&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what has upset you, Larry?"</p>

  <p>She waited, her eyes smarting, for his answer. She did not want to hear
  it, but she felt that she had to know. Larry found her different. Was there,
  after all, some subtle difference in her which her mirror had failed to
  reveal but which was obvious to her mother, obvious to Larry? Did Larry
  know&mdash;everything?</p>

  <p>He laid a hand on each of her shoulders and gazed gravely down into her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I don't like your eyes, darling," he said.</p>

  <p>She forced herself to meet his gaze.</p>

  <p>"What does that mean, Larry?"</p>

  <p>"Just that: I don't like your eyes." He turned from her suddenly. "God
  Almighty!" he exclaimed. "Does your father know?"</p>

  <p>"Does he know what? You're so mysterious and so&mdash;tragic, and I've no
  idea what you're driving at&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Haven't you?" he interrupted bitterly. "So he's made you a liar too, has
  he?"</p>

  <p>"Larry!" she exclaimed angrily. "You've no right&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She turned abruptly, but he grasped her arm roughly.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said savagely. "If you will have it, I'll tell you. There are
  two kinds of eyes in women: the eyes that know and the eyes that don't
  know."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Yours know," he said.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she wrenched her arm free, turned from him, and hurried into the
  bungalow.</p>

  <p>Larry did not follow her. It was not until half an hour later that he went
  slowly into the bungalow. Dr. Thurston was alone, sprawling in an armchair,
  smoking.</p>

  <p>"They've all turned in, Larry," he said.</p>

  <p>Larry nodded.</p>

  <p>"Bed for me, too," he said. "Good-night, Doctor."</p>

  <p>The doctor's glance followed him as he sauntered towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Larry!"</p>

  <p>The other paused.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Between you and Jackie?"</p>

  <p>Larry frowned.</p>

  <p>"Have you any reason for supposing there's anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"She seemed rather strange just now when she came in, that's all. Don't
  think I want to butt in, but as an interested spectator&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And as an interested spectator. Doctor, did it strike you that she was
  bubbling over with delight at seeing me again?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston rose and laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't be impatient, Larry," he said kindly. "She's at a queer age,
  and you've got to make all sorts of allowances&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've made all of them."</p>

  <p>"You've got to remember," added the doctor, "that girls are different
  nowadays&mdash;less emotional, less demonstrative, much freer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course&mdash;much freer," said Larry. "Goodnight, Doctor."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Louis Creet did not appear at breakfast the next morning.
  According to Tubby, he was lying in bed so gorged with thoughts of gold that
  he was incapable of movement; and from that point Tubby proceeded to tell
  them all about cobras at the Zoo who gorged themselves to such an extent that
  they could not move for a week.</p>

  <p>"Very remarkable," said Mrs. Thurston. "But Louis isn't in the least like
  a cobra. I've never really seen a cobra&mdash;I've heard it's so terribly hot
  in the Reptile House&mdash;but I don't think I've ever known anyone less like
  a cobra than Louis. He's terribly particular about his food."</p>

  <p>Mark's suggestion was that Louis, having drunk his early-morning tea with
  his thermometer in his mouth, was staying in bed until his temperature went
  down.</p>

  <p>"What's your theory, Larry?" he laughed.</p>

  <p>"I haven't one," said Larry. "You don't theorize over a thing when you
  know all about it."</p>

  <p>He felt that he did know all about Louis Creet&mdash;enough, at any rate,
  to warrant his uneasy feeling that a gentlemen's agreement was not the sort
  of agreement to carry the least weight with him. Neither Tubby nor Mark
  agreed with him, but they didn't know Creet as he did, and Tubby could never
  believe that a man who sent presents to his kids at Christmas could be
  anything but an honest and upright gentleman. Well, he hoped Mark and Tubby
  were right. He would never in his life have been so willing to admit that he
  was wrong as he would be if Louis kept his word. He only wished he could
  believe that he would be called on to admit it. If he had any theory at all
  as to why Louis was not yet up, it was that he was anxious to postpone as
  long as possible his business talk with them. But if Louis hoped to avoid him
  by lying in bed, he would have to lie in bed all day.</p>

  <p>After breakfast he beckoned Mark and Tubby to the veranda.</p>

  <p>"Hang around, won't you?" he said. "This business needs settling at once,
  and when Louis shows up I'm going to grab his tail and hold on till it is
  settled. And if he tries any tricks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, why should he?" said Tubby. "You've absolutely no reason for
  supposing he won't play straight with us."</p>

  <p>Larry smiled. "When you were a kid, Tubby, I suppose you never pinched a
  jam tart from the larder, or a conker off somebody else's tree, did you?"</p>

  <p>Tubby shook his head. "Talking of conkers," he said, "I once had a
  two-hundred-and-twenty-sixer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If only you'd done a few dishonest things yourself," said Larry, "you
  wouldn't find it so impossible to imagine dishonesty in other people. Anyway,
  take my word for it that if we're to get a square deal Louis will need
  watching all the time. He may need other things before we're through with
  him, but he'll certainly need watching. That's why I particularly don't want
  him to know about the causeway until everything is cut and dried and we're
  safe."</p>

  <p>"He knows about it already," said Mark.</p>

  <p>"You told him?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I told him," said Tubby. "I was talking to him last
  night about finding the mine. I just happened to mention the causeway, and
  Louis was very interested&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He would be."</p>

  <p>"Louis has every right to know about it," said Mark. "He's as much a
  partner in this outfit as any of us, and if we expect him to play straight
  with us, we've got to play straight with him."</p>

  <p>Larry shrugged. "When you're dealing with a chap like Louis Creet," he
  said, "it's as well to keep a shot in reserve. Still, the damage is done now.
  I don't wish you any harm, Tubby, but I'd like to slit your tongue."</p>

  <p>Creet appeared in due course. They found him half an hour later in the
  dining room, breakfasting. He greeted them with a faint smile as they came
  into the room from the veranda.</p>

  <p>"Well, you boys," he began amiably, and suddenly sprang to his feet,
  seized a paper-covered novel that lay in an armchair, and brought it down
  with a crash on the table.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, shut those windows!" he exclaimed. "Why the devil
  don't they have fly screens in this benighted hole? All these foul
  insects&mdash;" He waved a hand towards the novel on the table. "That brute
  was on my arm a second ago."</p>

  <p>Larry picked up the book and glanced at the crushed insect beneath.</p>

  <p>"Narrow squeak, Louis," he said. "Do you know what that is?"</p>

  <p>Louis glanced at it nervously.</p>

  <p>"According to the highest medical opinion," said Larry, "that insect
  causes more deaths every year that passes than smallpox, measles, whooping
  cough, or booze."</p>

  <p>"Feeding as it does on all sorts of things that neither you nor I nor any
  nice insect would dream of eating, Louis," grinned Tubby, "and laying its
  eggs, so to speak, all over the shop&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What the devil is it?" snapped Creet.</p>

  <p>"Common house fly," said Larry. "You must have come across them in
  England."</p>

  <p>Louis was obviously relieved. "It's all very well for you fellows to
  laugh," he said, "but you never know in this God-forsaken country, and I have
  to take care of myself." He seated himself again at the table. "By the way, I
  hope none of you has brought back any infection with you. Have you seen a
  doctor? If not, you'd better get Thurston to have a look at you."</p>

  <p>"We've all been bathed, deloused, and disinfected, Louis," Mark assured
  him. "You'll catch nothing off us."</p>

  <p>"Not infection, anyway," said Larry drily. "And now, Louis, what about a
  business talk?"</p>

  <p>"My dear chap," protested Louis, "there's no need to rush things. I'm just
  eating my breakfast&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll talk while you eat," said Larry. "The sooner we get this fixed up
  the better." He took a notebook from his pocket, extracted a folded slip of
  paper, and tossed it across the table to Louis. "That's just a rough account
  of what we've spent; I'll give you a detailed account later. There's about
  three hundred pounds in the bank here which we haven't drawn."</p>

  <p>Louis nodded, took a gold pencil from his pocket, and ran it casually down
  the column of figures.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," he said. "As a matter of fact, I had a note from my
  bank every month."</p>

  <p>"There are one or two formalities to be observed," said Larry.</p>

  <p>Creet nodded. "Certain papers to be filed with the governor. I understand
  all that."</p>

  <p>"Louis understands all that," said Larry. "In fact, he has a very thorough
  knowledge of mining law&mdash;haven't you, Louis?"</p>

  <p>Louis smiled complacently. "I'm not likely to trip up in that direction,
  Larry."</p>

  <p>"He knows, for instance," continued Larry, "just how much gold you can
  take away from a field under a prospecting concession, and he knows to a
  nicety the difference between mining and prospecting&mdash;don't you,
  Louis?"</p>

  <p>Tubby wrinkled his forehead. "Hanged if I see what you're getting at,
  Larry," he said.</p>

  <p>"You soon will," Larry told him. "Let's go on talking about the
  formalities, shall we, Louis? The subject interests all of us. There's a
  slight formality I'm going to suggest myself in a moment."</p>

  <p>Tubby's eyes were troubled. Nothing had been said in the exchange of
  remarks between Larry and Creet, nothing, at any rate, he could put his
  finger on, which suggested any antagonism between them, but he could sense
  that the antagonism was there, and it made him feel very uncomfortable. He
  hoped there wasn't going to be any unpleasantness. This sort of thing was bad
  enough in any case without getting unpleasant about it. He hated "talking
  money." There was something not quite decent about it, and he would gladly,
  had it been possible, have left all this "haggling business" to Mark and
  Larry.</p>

  <p>Creet cleared his throat nervously. "Well, there's one thing you three can
  be absolutely certain of," he said: "that I intend to treat you handsomely
  for the part you've played in this business. You've done remarkably
  well&mdash;far better than I ever dared to hope&mdash;and I&mdash;I'm very
  proud of you. Still, I expect you want something rather more tangible than
  honour and glory, and you're certainly entitled to it. Hard cash, eh.
  Tubby&mdash;pounds, shillings, and pence?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind the shillings and pence, Louis," said Larry. "Let's talk about
  the pounds."</p>

  <p>Tubby winced. He wished Larry wouldn't say that sort of thing; it made a
  fellow want to sink through the floor. He hastened to put the conversation on
  a more friendly footing.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what I thought of doing, Louis," he said. "I've got my eye
  on Ferrington Park. Do you know it? About two hundred acres and a marvellous
  house&mdash;just the other side of Horsham."</p>

  <p>"Ferrington Park?" said Louis. "Yes, I know it. I shouldn't advise you to
  take that kind of place. It would cost you a lot to keep it up and be a
  terrible speculation. But of course that's your business. What's the
  document, Larry?"</p>

  <p>Larry had taken a typewritten document from his pocket and was scanning it
  carefully.</p>

  <p>"This is my little formality," he said, handing the paper to Louis. "Read
  it."</p>

  <p>Louis took the paper and began to read. He had not read far when his bushy
  eyebrows contracted into a frown, and when he glanced across at Larry the
  friendly look had left his eyes.</p>

  <p>"What's this supposed to be?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"You can see what it is," said Larry. "It's the contract we didn't sign
  before we left England. We've reached the point now where gentlemen's
  agreements, having served their turn, can be properly legalized. I had this
  document prepared as soon as I got here. It's in English and Portuguese, as
  you see, and I think you'll find it quite in order."</p>

  <p>Louis glanced at the document again and tossed it onto the table.</p>

  <p>"Do you fellows really expect me to sign an agreement like that?"</p>

  <p>"What is it, Larry?" asked Mark.</p>

  <p>"It's just a contract setting out in very plain terms in English and
  Portuguese that we four are equal partners in the Chumbaziri goldfield," said
  Larry. "It places us under an obligation to repay to Louis all the money he
  put up for the expedition, but as we've already more than enough gold in our
  possession, that's easily done."</p>

  <p>"That was the original agreement," said Tubby. "But what else is in the
  contract, Larry?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing else."</p>

  <p>Tubby frowned.</p>

  <p>"But Louis said he wouldn't sign it."</p>

  <p>Larry smiled grimly. "That's how it sounded to me, too, Tubby."</p>

  <p>Louis Creet's nervous fingers had been beating a noiseless tattoo on the
  table. His head was bent slightly downwards and sideways, a characteristic
  pose of his when he wished to convey the impression that, as far as he was
  concerned, the conversation was not of the slightest interest.</p>

  <p>"Hang it, Louis, where's the hitch?" demanded Tubby. "If there's nothing
  in this contract except what we all agreed to, I don't understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You had all better understand at once," Creet interrupted, deigning at
  last to betray some interest, "that I certainly shall not sign that document
  or any other document. It seems to me that you all have quite a wrong idea of
  my intentions."</p>

  <p>"They have," said Larry, "but I haven't."</p>

  <p>"I made it all perfectly plain," said Creet irritably. "If you'll refer to
  the letter I wrote to Storman, you'll see exactly what I agreed to do. When
  you brought the scheme to me and told me you'd already made two attempts to
  locate the field, and had failed, I agreed to advance the money for another
  expedition and to remunerate the members of the party by regular monthly
  payments."</p>

  <p>"It sounds like a hire-purchase agreement," was Larry's comment.</p>

  <p>"You had your chance of finding the goldfield on your own account."
  continued Creet, "and it was obviously a pretty bad risk for me. There never
  was the least question of dividing the property if you found it. I defy you
  to produce any letter I have written agreeing to such a division."</p>

  <p>For some moments there was silence. Louis, maintaining his pose of
  unconcern, was studying his finger nails minutely, striving to appear
  unconscious of the scowling face of Mark Elliott, the bewildered, incredulous
  stare of Tubby Storman, and the supercilious smile twisting the lips of Larry
  Deans.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" exclaimed Tubby; and suddenly Creet sat up in his chair and
  faced them.</p>

  <p>"You all seem very surprised," he said, "but I can't see why you should
  be. I risked some thousands of pounds on this expedition. What did you
  fellows risk? Absolutely nothing!"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely nothing," said Larry, "being the market price of our lives
  prevailing at the moment."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" snapped Louis. "I'm not pretending I gave you a holiday, but I
  certainly provided you with a very interesting experience, and now I'm quite
  ready to treat you fairly. I'll tell you exactly what I'm prepared to do. If
  you prove the mine, I don't object to your keeping the gold you've brought
  away. It's not strictly legal, but I'm willing to make you that concession.
  That gives you over two thousand pounds apiece."</p>

  <p>Mark, who had been sitting, his eyes fixed on Creet's face, rose from his
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Are you serious, Louis?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm serious," replied Creet testily. "What's the matter with
  you all? This is the first mention I've heard that you expected what you call
  a share. You're making things very unpleasant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tubby sprang to his feet, his face crimson, his fists clenched, his eyes
  dangerous.</p>

  <p>"My God, Louis!" he exclaimed. "And to think I've been sticking up for
  you! Eighteen months of hell and now you want to cheat us. Righto&mdash;cheat
  us! Cheat us&mdash;back out of your agreement&mdash;swindle us out of our
  share, and by God! I'll settle you, you swine!"</p>

  <p>"Steady, Tubby, old man!" said Larry. "Let me talk to Louis. He and I
  speak the same language."</p>

  <p>He turned and faced Creet, who shifted uneasily in his chair. He had
  screwed up his courage to the point of this interview with an effort which it
  was becoming hard to sustain. Larry Deans was a dangerous devil, and he
  didn't mean to start an argument with him. With as convincing an air of
  nonchalance as he could assume he rose from his chair and stretched out his
  hand for his helmet, which lay on the settee.</p>

  <p>"If you imagine," he began in an unsteady voice, "that I'm going to stay
  here to be insulted&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Larry took two strides towards him, grasped him by the shoulders, and
  thrust him violently back into his chair. Creet's face became livid, but he
  did not move.</p>

  <p>"Now listen to me, Louis," said Larry quietly. "You're going to stay
  here&mdash;to be insulted by me; and if you make any attempt to leave this
  room until I give you permission, I shall shoot you. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>Louis, struggling to regain both his breath and his self-possession, made
  no reply. Larry pushed the typewritten document towards him across the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Put your signature to that, Louis," he said. "It gives you a quarter
  share in our mine, which is all you're entitled to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your mine?" sneered Creet. "That remains to be seen. And if you really
  think I'm fool enough to risk thousands of pounds on a ten-thousand-to-one
  chance only to give away my winnings&mdash;don't be a damned fool,
  Larry!"</p>

  <p>Larry stood for some moments staring at him in silence.</p>

  <p>"Would you care to know, Louis," he asked, "what's coming to you if you
  don't sign that agreement?"</p>

  <p>Creet started. "If that's intended to be a threat, Larry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is a threat. I'm telling you bluntly that if you wish to enjoy the few
  years that remain to you, you must sign that contract."</p>

  <p>Creet's face turned an unhealthy grey, and his eyes shifted restlessly
  from one to another. He rose, walked unsteadily to the sideboard, splashed
  some whisky into a glass, and gulped it down. The spirit gave him new
  courage.</p>

  <p>"My dear Larry," he said, "you can't get away with that sort of thing.
  Even in a God-forsaken place like this there's some sort of law, you know.
  It's disappointing for you, but even in Africa, I believe, there's a certain
  penalty attaching to murder."</p>

  <p>"I'd risk the penalty," declared Larry, "and murder in cold blood any man
  who did what you're trying to do. There's the document. It's in Portuguese
  and English and you can sign it in duplicate."</p>

  <p>Louis shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've been threatened before, Larry&mdash;many times&mdash;by better men
  than you, and I'm not easily frightened. The goldfield is mine&mdash;mine, do
  you hear?" he repeated harshly. "If you think you've any sort of claim, then
  start an action&mdash;here&mdash;in St. Paul de
  Loanda&mdash;Lisbon&mdash;London&mdash;anywhere! Do anything you like. I've
  no more to say, and you can go to hell&mdash;the whole lot of you!</p>

  <p>Tubby could restrain himself no longer.</p>

  <p>"My God, Creet," he exclaimed, "I'm not standing for this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His arm was whipped back and then flashed forward, hurling his clenched
  fist straight at Louis Creet's chin. But before the blow could land Larry's
  hand gripped his arm and held it.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Larry, let me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Larry shook his head.</p>

  <p>"We'll find a better way than that, Tubby," he said. "Let him go now."</p>

  <p>And Louis Creet, trying not to hurry, went from the room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was Tubby who first found his voice.</p>

  <p>"Damn it all!" he exclaimed. "He can't do it."</p>

  <p>Larry smiled.</p>

  <p>"Can't he? That's just your beautiful nature again, Tubby, that won't let
  you admit what swine men can be."</p>

  <p>"But he wouldn't do it," persisted Tubby. "You got him pretty badly
  rattled just now, and he didn't really mean half he said."</p>

  <p>"I'm beginning to agree with Larry," said Mark. "Louis probably didn't say
  half of what he really meant. But we don't take this lying down, Larry, do
  we?"</p>

  <p>"I've done all that can be done," said Larry. "I filed a <i>pro forma</i>
  claim first thing this morning at the Office of Mines. Louis doesn't know
  that. But if he takes it into court or opposes it when he does hear of it, we
  shan't have a dog's chance."</p>

  <p>Larry strolled to the window, lighted a cigarette, and for some moments
  stood gazing thoughtfully into the garden.</p>

  <p>"There's only one chance that I can see for us to get our share in the
  Chumbaziri goldfield," he said, "and that is for the Lord to send a
  visitation unto our brother, Louis Creet, severe enough to remove him from
  this mortal coil. In other words, for Louis to peg out. It would all be plain
  enough sailing then. We found the mine, we registered it, and no question of
  our being employed on salary would arise. But blackguards like Louis are
  notoriously long-lived, and it's no use talking rot, anyway. We can take it
  for granted that he won't peg out just to suit our book."</p>

  <p>Tubby rose and began pacing the room.</p>

  <p>"It's we who'll do the pegging out," he exclaimed violently, "while that
  swine's spending the money and grinning to himself to think what mugs we
  were. Like a fool I've wired the news to Bunty, and if I have to send another
  wire telling her it's all a washout&mdash;I haven't the heart to do it,
  Larry, and that's flat."</p>

  <p>"The trouble is, Tubby, we were born too late," said Mark. "In the good
  old days we'd just have rung up Messrs. Borgia &amp; Co. and said, 'Send us
  along a couple of pints of your best henbane or a good reliable assassin,'
  and then have dismissed Louis from our minds. Any grounds for optimism,
  Larry, in the fact that he's always grousing about his health?"</p>

  <p>Larry shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Louis will live to be ninety, Mark, and be buried under a monument as big
  as the Albert Memorial&mdash;if he can't pinch anyone else's. But we're
  talking rot."</p>

  <p>"Are we?" exclaimed Tubby. "I don't mind telling you, Larry, that if he
  does double-cross us there's mighty little I'd stick at. I threw up
  everything for this trip&mdash;you don't suppose Bunty's been living on the
  bit of money I got from Louis, do you? I mortgaged the house, pawned every
  damn thing I'd got, and if I had got to go back with absolutely nothing and
  start all over again just because Louis can't play a straight game with us,
  I&mdash;I&mdash;I wouldn't answer for what I'd do."</p>

  <p>Larry nodded.</p>

  <p>"Nor I, Tubby," he said. "But let's try to keep calm over it. You chaps
  think I'm a bit to blame, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Dear old ass, absolutely not," said Tubby.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, you do, Tubby. You've an idea everything would have been all
  right if I hadn't gone for Louis and upset him. But you're wrong; all this
  would have happened in any case. I've had an uneasy feeling all along that I
  knew Mr. Louis Creet, and when you think the worst of people you're usually
  right."</p>

  <p>"If he'd offered us ten per cent.," said Mark, "five per
  cent.&mdash;something, anyway&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look here," interrupted Tubby suddenly. "I'll tell you what. I can't
  believe old Louis is really as bad as we've been imagining. I mean, he knows
  our circumstances, and I feel pretty certain that if I have a talk with him
  in a friendly sort of way&mdash;I'll see what I can do, shall I?"</p>

  <p>He went to the door.</p>

  <p>"After all," he said, "sending those toys to my kids at
  Christmas&mdash;see what I mean?"</p>

  <p>"Try it," said Larry, and Tubby went out.</p>

  <p>Larry smiled. "Personally, Mark, old man," he said, "I think I shall try
  to get gloriously drunk. It'll be just about as useful."</p>

  <p>It was a trying day for Mrs. Thurston. It began badly by Jacqueline
  remaining in bed for the greater part of the morning and denying, in her most
  baffling way, that there was any reason for her doing so beyond the
  disappointingly obvious one that she felt like staying in bed; and when she
  had got up she had been so moody and silent and disinclined to have anything
  to do with anybody that her mother was soon wishing that she had left her
  undisturbed in her bedroom. Something was bothering Jacqueline, and it
  worried Mrs. Thurston that she did not know what it was.</p>

  <p>Something, of course, was worrying everybody today. Even Louis, usually so
  good-tempered and affable, had shown unmistakable signs of frayed nerves, and
  Tubby and Mark and Larry, all equally glum, had spent the day lounging about
  the place with scarcely a civil word for anyone and smoking far more
  cigarettes than could possibly be good for them.</p>

  <p>Breakfast had been a gloomy affair, lunch a gloomier; and dinner had been
  eaten in an atmosphere which, though she could not define it, had made her
  feel very uncomfortable. And now this evening Dr. Thurston had put the
  finishing touch to a day of discomfort by losing his stethoscope and
  insisting on ransacking every bit of luggage and scattering things all over
  the bedroom in search of it.</p>

  <p>"It's got to be found, my dear," he explained, as, kneeling on the bedroom
  floor, he rummaged in her cabin trunk. "It's Louis. I've promised to run the
  rule over him this evening&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Again?" sighed Mrs. Thurston. "Such a lot of trouble all for nothing,
  John, because he's sure to back out at the last moment."</p>

  <p>"He probably will," agreed the doctor, "but as his medical attendant at
  five hundred a year, my dear, it's as well to have a stethoscope in case he
  doesn't. What's wrong with Jackie?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't know, John," sighed Mrs. Thurston. "She's behaving very
  strangely, but she never confides in me. And it isn't only Jackie. What's
  wrong with everybody? They all seem terribly depressed and upset, and it
  can't be the heat, because Larry and Mark and Tubby must have got quite used
  to the heat. I've never seen such a change since yesterday. If finding a gold
  mine upsets people like that, it's a pity they ever went to look for it."</p>

  <p>The doctor gave a shrug.</p>

  <p>"I haven't enquired&mdash;it's not my business," he said, "but I fancy
  they've had some sort of a dust-up with Louis. Over the mine. I don't think
  it has panned out quite as they expected."</p>

  <p>"But it's a terribly rich mine, John, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so, my dear, and I should have thought there was more than
  enough for all of them. But there's some trouble over it."</p>

  <p>"It seems a great pity," sighed Mrs. Thurston, "if people can't find a
  gold mine without squabbling over it and&mdash;that's my new silk jumper,
  John, that you're rumpling about. You'd much better let me look&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The doctor waved her aside.</p>

  <p>"Here it is&mdash;inside one of your bedroom slippers," he said, producing
  the stethoscope. "And now we'll go and cheer up Mark and Tubby, my dear.
  They're glaring at the furniture in the drawing room."</p>

  <p>They went to the drawing room. Mark, in a low cane chair, was blowing
  smoke towards the ceiling, and the expression on his face suggested that he
  had a grievance against the ceiling and that every puff of smoke directed at
  it was a deliberate insult. Tubby, astride the music stool, was picking at
  the piano with a single finger, staring at the keys as though they had done
  him a grievous injury.</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston surveyed them with an amused smile.</p>

  <p>"The effect of sudden riches on the middle classes, my dear," he laughed,
  with a gesture towards Mark and Tubby. "They look as if they'd lost a fortune
  instead of having found one. We should be thankful we haven't discovered a
  gold mine."</p>

  <p>Tubby smiled rather sheepishly.</p>

  <p>"The fact is, Mrs. Thurston," he said, "things aren't quite as bright as
  we thought they'd be. You see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What's troubling both of us," interrupted Mark, with a warning glance at
  Tubby, "is that now we've got the money we can't decide what to do with it.
  Tubby's going grey with worry as to whether he ought to build a hospital or
  buy a house in Park Lane. In either case he's afraid they'll try to give him
  a knighthood. Do you know what's become of Larry, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Larry went out&mdash;about half an hour ago," said Mrs. Thurston. "I'm
  sure I don't know what was the matter with him, but he suddenly jumped up and
  went striding out of the room, muttering all sorts of strange foreign words,
  which I took to be some native language he'd picked up in the forest."</p>

  <p>Mark shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Some mistake there, Mrs. Thurston," he said. "Larry only speaks
  English."</p>

  <p>"Well, I prefer to believe that he was not speaking English, Mark," said
  Mrs. Thurston. "If he was speaking English I'm very much surprised that Larry
  should ever know the words he used. He asked me where Jacqueline was, and
  when I told him he suddenly started muttering in some native
  dialect&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By the way, where is Jacqueline?" asked Tubby. "She promised to sing to
  us this evening."</p>

  <p>"She's out," said Mrs. Thurston.</p>

  <p>"Not alone, I hope," said the doctor. "It's not safe, you know. A couple
  of desperadoes have escaped from the local gaol, and as they're armed a
  police officer came along to warn us. Where's she gone?"</p>

  <p>"She's gone to the dance&mdash;with Louis, so I'm sure there's no need to
  worry."</p>

  <p>The doctor raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"A dance&mdash;in this place?"</p>

  <p>"A native dance," explained Mrs. Thurston. "I really didn't listen very
  carefully, John. It's one of the big native festivals, I believe, and Louis
  offered to take her to see it."</p>

  <p>Tubby grinned.</p>

  <p>"Free hop, by the sound of it," he said.</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston was frowning.</p>

  <p>"Did you gather, my dear, what sort of dance?"</p>

  <p>"Really, John, I didn't enquire," said Mrs. Thurston wearily. "It goes on
  all night, I fancy, but I told Louis to bring her back not later than eleven
  o'clock. I think he said it was a dance in honour of some ju-ju&mdash;is that
  the word, Mark?"</p>

  <p>Mark nodded, frowning.</p>

  <p>"It's called&mdash;let me see if I can remember," Mrs. Thurston continued.
  "Would it be something like M'bugulu?"</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>Mark sat suddenly upright, his eyes incredulous.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it was something like that, Mark."</p>

  <p>"M'bugulu? And Louis has taken Jacqueline to see it?"</p>

  <p>"Any reason," demanded the doctor, "why Louis shouldn't take Jacqueline to
  see it?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Doctor&mdash;absolutely&mdash;I should jolly well say there
  is!" said Tubby. "Taking Jackie to a thing like that&mdash;hang it. Doctor,
  it's poisonous&mdash;foul&mdash;and nobody but a downright swine would dream
  of taking a girl</p>

  <p>"But I had no idea " began Mrs. Thurston helplessly.</p>

  <p>The doctor cut her short.</p>

  <p>"We can only assume that Louis didn't know that there was anything wrong,"
  he said. "But if it's as bad as you say, Tubby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It couldn't be worse. Doctor," said Mark. "You can take it from me."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Dr. Thurston, "there's only one thing to do: I must
  fetch her back&mdash;at once."</p>

  <p>He strode across the room, Mark and Tubby following; but as he reached the
  door it was flung open, and Larry, grasping Jacqueline by the arm, strode in,
  shut the door behind him, and released her. As he did so she turned and faced
  him, her eyes furious, her cheeks unnaturally pale.</p>

  <p>"Larry&mdash;how dare you!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Larry shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Quite right, Jacqueline," he said; "I behaved like a hooligan. But the
  occasion didn't call for drawing-room manners."</p>

  <p>"You had absolutely no right&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I had, Jackie&mdash;so much right that if you'd made any more
  fuss I'd have tucked you under my arm and carried you away."</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble, Jackie?" inquired Dr. Thurston.</p>

  <p>"I'm the trouble. Doctor," said Larry. "I don't blame Jackie for resenting
  it, but there was really no other way. She wouldn't leave when I asked her
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So you grabbed me in front of everybody," interrupted Jacqueline, "and
  dragged me away by force as if&mdash;as if you owned me and I had no say in
  the matter, brought me home like a naughty schoolgirl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure, darling," began Mrs. Thurston, "Larry wouldn't do a thing like
  that without some very good reason&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, please, Mother, don't interfere," interrupted the girl. "You weren't
  there and you don't realize what happened. Larry was so insulting to Louis in
  front of all those Portuguese officers, and after all his kindness to
  us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All his kindness to us!" exclaimed Tubby. "Good Lord!"</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Tubby!" snapped Mark.</p>

  <p>"Steady, Jackie!" said Dr. Thurston. "You've got to be fair, you know.
  Larry was only acting for the best&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Larry had no right to interfere in any way," said Jacqueline. "A native
  dance&mdash;there was nothing in it&mdash;it hadn't even started&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which is why there was nothing in it," said Larry. He glanced at Mark and
  Tubby. "The M'bugulu," he said.</p>

  <p>Mark nodded.</p>

  <p>"Not quite the entertainment for a Sunday-school treat, Jackie," he said.
  "Of course, you don't realize</p>

  <p>"I realize when I'm being made a fool of, Mark. If you expect me to like
  being grabbed by the arm and dragged out in front of everyone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I asked you to come, Jackie," said Larry, "and you wouldn't,"</p>

  <p>"Why should I? Louis was there."</p>

  <p>"And that was another good reason."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston glanced at him with surprise and disapproval in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Really, Larry," she said, "you shouldn't say that sort of thing, you
  know. Louis, I'm sure, had no idea that the dance was&mdash;was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is the dance, Larry?" asked the doctor. "Anatomical?"</p>

  <p>"Biological," said Larry.</p>

  <p>The doctor nodded, frowning.</p>

  <p>"In that case, Jackie, I don't think you should be angry with
  Larry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Whatever the dance is," interrupted Mrs. Thurston, "I'm quite sure that
  Louis wouldn't have dreamed of taking Jacqueline&mdash;or even going
  himself&mdash;if he'd had any idea that it was&mdash;was what Larry says it
  is. He's far too much of a gentleman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tubby could restrain himself no longer.</p>

  <p>"Gentleman! Good Lord!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Larry glared.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Tubby, and behave yourself," he ordered.</p>

  <p>But Tubby had reached the limits of his restraint.</p>

  <p>"Gentleman!" he exploded. "You call Louis Creet a gentleman!"</p>

  <p>"Tubby!" warned Larry. "If you don't shut up I'll give you such a
  sock&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Tubby paid no heed.</p>

  <p>"You think he's a gentleman, eh, Mrs. Thurston? You too, eh, Jackie? You
  can't believe he'd be swine enough to take you to a poisonous show like that
  if he'd known what it was, can you? But you're shinning up the wrong tree
  about Louis Creet&mdash;all of you. So was I until today, but I know better
  now, and you can take it from me that a man who's swine enough to break his
  word and swindle his partners who've done all the dirty work&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline turned suddenly to Larry.</p>

  <p>"Larry, is&mdash;is that true? Is Louis breaking his word and swindling
  you?"</p>

  <p>Larry shrugged.</p>

  <p>"In the good old days, Jackie, Tubby would have had his tongue cut out.
  He's a regular old woman for gossip."</p>

  <p>"You haven't answered my question, Larry. Is it true?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is true," said Tubby. "Larry's too much of a gentleman to speak
  about it, but I'm not. It makes me sick to see Louis posing as a sort of
  public benefactor and you all thinking what a nice, kind, generous bloke he
  is, when all the time he's nothing but a low-down swindler. We came out here
  as partners in this mine and we end up as employees. Eighteen months'
  work&mdash;eighteen months' living like pigs&mdash;and we don't even get the
  pigs' rations. That's Louis!"</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston glanced at Larry.</p>

  <p>"Then it is true, eh, Larry?"</p>

  <p>Larry nodded.</p>

  <p>"Since Tubby has blown the gaff," he said, "it's no use denying it. Louis
  promised us each a quarter share in the mine with him. Now that we've found
  it, he's backed out of his promise, and we're to get exactly nothing."</p>

  <p>"It's hard to believe it of Louis," said Dr. Thurston. "I can't imagine
  him doing a thing like that."</p>

  <p>"But surely, Larry," said Jacqueline, "you had a contract&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her anger had all faded, and there was genuine distress in her eyes.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"A gentlemen's agreement, Jackie," he said. "You know what that is if they
  don't both happen to be gentlemen: an arrangement for a fool to make and a
  rogue to break."</p>

  <p>"But if the mine is as rich as you say, Larry," said the doctor, "there
  should be plenty for all of you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's plenty for twenty of us," declared Tubby&mdash;"for a hundred of
  us. But Louis doesn't think that way. He wants the lot, and he means to take
  the lot, and the rest of us can go to blazes."</p>

  <p>"It's all very distressing," began Dr. Thurston in evident
  embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"There's no reason to distress yourself, Doctor," said Larry. "I'm
  dreadfully sorry we let you know anything about it, but Tubby never can
  control himself."</p>

  <p>"It's terribly bad luck on you fellows."</p>

  <p>"We're not beaten yet," said Larry. "By the way, Doctor, there's no need
  for you and Jackie and Mrs. Thurston to be dragged into this, and it has just
  struck me that it'll be rather embarrassing for you having us here. If you'd
  rather we shifted to the hotel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a confounded fool, Larry," snapped the doctor. "If you go to the
  hotel, so do we."</p>

  <p>"And not a word to Louis, please. Doctor."</p>

  <p>The doctor shrugged.</p>

  <p>"As you wish," he said. "I'd dearly love to tell him what I think of him,
  all the same." He turned to his wife. "Bed, my dear," he said. "Come along,
  Jackie. You've caused enough trouble for one evening, and Larry will be glad
  to see the back of you. Good-night, everybody."</p>

  <p>He followed Mrs. Thurston from the room. Jackie hesitated, her eyes
  troubled; then she crossed to the door and paused.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, Tubby. Good-night, Mark."</p>

  <p>"Good-night, Jackie."</p>

  <p>Mark flung himself into the low chair and resumed his provocative attitude
  towards the ceiling, and Tubby, returning to the piano, began once more
  picking at the keys. Jacqueline laid a hand on Larry's sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Larry," she said, "please believe I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"We're not dead yet, Jackie. I'll wring something out of old Louis
  somehow."</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean&mdash;sorry&mdash;about that, Larry," said the girl and
  hurried out.</p>

  <p>Mark, as the door closed, withdrew his gaze from the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"And where's the little gentleman with the hairy heel, Larry?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I left him fuming and foaming in the village," said Larry with a shrug.
  "He was threatening to have me arrested, so he has probably gone to the
  police station."</p>

  <p>"Did you hit him?"</p>

  <p>Larry shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I was quite a gentlemanly little hooligan."</p>

  <p>"H'm! Pity."</p>

  <p>"If I'd hit him I'd probably have killed him."</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Mark.</p>

  <p>"I'm for sleep," announced Tubby suddenly.</p>

  <p>Mark rose.</p>

  <p>"I'm for bed, anyway," he said. "Cheerio, Larry!"</p>

  <p>Larry nodded and seated himself at the piano.</p>

  <p>"Keep your ears open, Tubby," he said. "I'm going to have a shot at
  playing 'Parted.'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tubby glared.</p>

  <p>"Appropriate music, Tubby."</p>

  <p>"Appropriate!" snorted Tubby.</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't it?" said Larry. "You know what they say, don't you? 'A fool
  and his money are soon parted.' It seems to fit the occasion."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Before Mark and Tubby had reached the door, it opened and
  Louis came in. He halted abruptly as he saw them, and for some moments stood
  glaring from one to the other, his hands clenched, his lips working, the
  veins in his forehead swollen; and then, as Larry, concealed from view behind
  the music rest, thumped out the first few notes of his rendering of "Parted,"
  he thrust his way past Mark and Tubby and strode to the piano. Larry, intent
  on his fingers, did not glance up.</p>

  <p>"Two to one so far, Tubby," he said.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"The proportion of right notes to wrong notes," said Larry. "It might help
  if you'd whistle the first bit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Larry!" exclaimed Louis furiously.</p>

  <p>Larry glanced up.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Louis! Stay to see the end? Ingenious, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Louis, obviously, made a great effort to control himself.</p>

  <p>"I can only say, Larry, that you behaved like an insufferable cad."</p>

  <p>Larry smiled.</p>

  <p>"And Jacqueline agrees with me."</p>

  <p>"Agreed," corrected Larry. "You'll be sorry to hear, Louis, that she has
  altered her opinion. I'm not sure that she hasn't transferred the title to
  you. She's waiting to find out, I fancy, whether you didn't know what the
  M'bugulu is or whether you were just indulging your taste. Which was it,
  Louis? Tell us."</p>

  <p>"That's my affair," snapped Louis. "I don't have to account to you for
  what I do, and I don't intend to be interfered with by you or by any other
  conceited fool. I do as I please."</p>

  <p>Larry shrugged.</p>

  <p>"As long as it pleased you," he said. "But I should have thought the
  M'bugulu was a bit thick even for you. It's not the sort of show to take
  Jackie to, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely not," agreed Tubby. "Of course, you didn't know, Louis, old
  man, but I've seen the dance, and you can take it from me that it's an
  absolutely beastly exhibition&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Louis swung round and faced him.</p>

  <p>"When I want your opinion I'll ask for it," he snarled. "I'm not talking
  to you; I'm talking to Larry, and I'm telling you, Larry, that I've stood
  enough of your insolence. Ever since I arrived you've gone out of your way to
  be deliberately insulting, and I'll stand no more of you and your cheap
  little sarcasms. Your high-and-mighty ways may be all right in the forest,
  but they get you nowhere with me. This finishes everything."</p>

  <p>He swung round again and faced the other two. All restraint had gone now.
  He was white to the lips, and his hands were shaking.</p>

  <p>"This finishes everything," he repeated thickly.</p>

  <p>"Understand that. I was going to treat you fairly&mdash;even Larry, who's
  done nothing but accuse me of being a cheat and a swindler. But after this
  I'll see you all damned first. Any concessions I was going to make are
  definitely off. There'll be no concessions. Understand that. And if you don't
  like it you can thank Mr. Larry Deans for it."</p>

  <p>Tubby suddenly clenched his right hand and took a step towards Louis, but
  as Larry quickly rose he checked himself.</p>

  <p>"All right, Tubby," said Larry. "This is nothing new, so don't let it
  excite you. Louis never intended making any concessions, as he calls them;
  this is just a convenient way of excusing his dirty twisting and of salving
  what he probably believes to be his conscience. Personally, I want no
  concessions from him. I wouldn't accept any."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not particularly squeamish over money," said Mark, "but I do
  bar charity from a swindler."</p>

  <p>"But I want my rights," added Larry, "and whether you hand them
  voluntarily, Louis, or I have to wring them out of you by force, I intend to
  have them. So do Mark and Tubby."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Louis. "Then listen to me, all of you. You've brought back
  eight thousand pounds' worth of gold with you, haven't you? Well, tomorrow
  morning you'll deposit that gold with the Office of Mines in my name.
  Understand&mdash;in my name&mdash;every ounce of it."</p>

  <p>"I'll see you damned&mdash;" began Tubby.</p>

  <p>"And if you don't deposit it, or try to get it away," added Louis, "I'll
  have you arrested. If you thought you'd found a mug in me you'd better start
  thinking again. I'll soon show you that I'm the master of this outfit, not
  Larry Deans. That's all I have to say."</p>

  <p>He turned away, seated himself in a low chair, lighted a cigar, and began
  glancing through a copy of <i>Punch</i> Tubby strode across the room and
  stood towering over him.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Louis," he began, in his most conciliatory tone, "we don't
  want to be unreasonable, you know, but you simply can't treat us like that.
  What I mean is, expecting us to hand over the gold and leave ourselves
  absolutely stranded without a bean in the world&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll pay you one month's salary and your passage back to England and not
  a farthing more," said Louis, without glancing up. "You can think yourselves
  lucky to get that. And if you're not satisfied you'd better take the case to
  court. It'll cost you a tidy penny, but if you think it's worth it that's
  your affair."</p>

  <p>He rose, tossed the magazine into the chair, and sauntered towards the
  door. But Tubby was there first, standing with his back against it, his fists
  clenched, his eyes dangerous.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Louis," he began in a thick, unnatural voice. "You're not
  getting away with this. You're not leaving this room until you've
  promised&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Louis raised a protesting hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't let's have any melodrama, please, Tubby," he said. "All this, I can
  assure you, is extremely unpleasant to me, and I admit that I have chiefly
  myself to blame. I've treated you fellows too generously from the start, and
  now, instead of being grateful for what I've done&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What you've done!" exclaimed Tubby. "What you've done! Good Lord!"</p>

  <p>"I've been far too good to you&mdash;I see that now," continued Louis,
  "giving you money to spend like water, looking after your dependents as an
  act of charity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>For the second time it was Larry who saved him. Tubby's fist suddenly
  swept towards Louis's face, but Larry's hand gripped his arm and held it.</p>

  <p>"Steady, Tubby!" he said. "Get out, there's a good chap, and leave Louis
  to me."</p>

  <p>"Charity!" fumed Tubby. "Good God, Larry, when I think of Bunty&mdash;and
  that swine talking of charity</p>

  <p>"I know," soothed Larry. "But get out like a good chap now. Take him out,
  Mark, will you? I've a few words to say to Louis on my own account."</p>

  <p>Mark opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Tubby!"</p>

  <p>With a shrug Tubby followed him from the room.</p>

  <p>"Whatever you have to say, Larry," said Louis, "I've no wish to hear it.
  As far as I'm concerned the question is done with. I shall wire to St. Paul
  for a lawyer in the morning and get the whole matter settled and put on a
  legal footing, and if you think you can establish a claim to a share in the
  Chumbaziri gold-field simply on the grounds that I provided you with two
  thousand pounds to finance the expedition&mdash;well, go ahead and establish
  it."</p>

  <p>Larry smiled. Nothing irritated Creet so much as Larry's habit of smiling
  at the most unexpected moments. It always meant, he had discovered, that
  Larry was about to make some particularly offensive remark, and he had had
  more than enough offensive remarks today. It was a dangerous sort of
  smile&mdash;menacing, somehow. What in the name of fortune could the fellow
  see to grin at?</p>

  <p>Larry's smile vanished.</p>

  <p>"Let's get things clear, Louis," he said. "You provided two thousand
  pounds; I don't dispute that. All I dispute is your reason for providing it.
  I was amazed when you agreed to put up two thousand for an expedition which
  you believed hadn't a dog's chance of doing anything but lose your money for
  you. But I'm not amazed now."</p>

  <p>Louis made a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"None of this interests me in the least, Larry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You provided the money," continued Larry, "because you thought it worth
  two thousand to get me out of the country for a year&mdash;possibly forever.
  You never know your luck, eh, Louis? I wonder if you'd have worn a black tie
  for me!"</p>

  <p>"I always wished you well, Larry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well out of the way," said the other. "But I'm one of those aggravating
  blokes who thrive on fever, and mosquitoes turn up their noses at me. Once
  bitten, twice shy, you know. I fancy I leave a nasty taste in their mouths.
  It's annoying for you, though."</p>

  <p>"And what has all this to do with the Chumbaziri goldfield?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind the goldfield," said Larry, "for the moment. All this has
  nothing to do with it. It has to do with Jacqueline Thurston."</p>

  <p>Louis's glance met Larry's and wavered.</p>

  <p>"If you expect me to discuss Jacqueline with you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't," said Larry sharply. "I expect you to listen to what I have to
  say. You knew that she and I were engaged, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"I knew nothing whatever about your affairs."</p>

  <p>"You knew that I was practically engaged to her. Everybody knew. What I
  want to know is, what has happened while I've been away?"</p>

  <p>Louis smiled.</p>

  <p>"The natural anxiety of an absent lover, eh? But why ask me?"</p>

  <p>"Because you're the person best qualified to tell me," said Larry. "You've
  been taking her about here, there, and everywhere, haven't you? I want to
  know what has been the outcome of it all. All this 'Jackie, darling' stuff!
  How far has it gone? But I needn't ask you that. Very thorough, Louis, aren't
  you&mdash;especially in your villainies?"</p>

  <p>Louis gave a shrug.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing very villainous in taking a girl to a dance and a party
  or two&mdash;with her parents' consent," he said. "And in any case, Larry, I
  can't see that you have any right to object. Jacqueline herself didn't
  exactly welcome your interference this evening&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Larry cut him short.</p>

  <p>"I'm not arguing, Louis," he said. "I'm just telling you that you're going
  to cut Jackie right out of your scheme of things. Get that into your
  head."</p>

  <p>"Because you're still hoping to marry her? My dear fellow, you always were
  an optimist."</p>

  <p>"Not because I'm hoping to marry her," said Larry, "but because one day
  some fairly decent man may come along who's entitled to expect his wife to be
  less sophisticated than any girl who has much to do with you could hope to
  be."</p>

  <p>Louis forced a laugh.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, you're letting your jealousy run away with your
  imagination!"</p>

  <p>"My memory's good, anyway," said Larry. "There was a girl once&mdash;quite
  a kid&mdash;rather younger than Jackie&mdash;as innocent as any girl can be
  who has been to a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen&mdash;I
  needn't mention names, need I? You can hardly have forgotten the particular
  victim I'm referring to, though the affair didn't last long, poor kid!"</p>

  <p>"I don't in the least understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You know what that kid was when you'd finished with her, don't you? No
  one would have dreamed that she had an eminent K.C. as a father, a beautiful
  home, the best education that money could buy. You didn't see her, Louis,
  once you'd choked her off, but I did. That was the first time in my life that
  I ever longed to kill a man."</p>

  <p>Louis glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"All most interesting," he said, going to the door, "but it's getting very
  late. I have to take care of myself, and if you've no more to say I think
  I'll go to bed."</p>

  <p>"All I want to say," said Larry, "is that Jacqueline's education at your
  hands is to be cut off at the kindergarten stage."</p>

  <p>"It's all Greek to me, Larry. I think the sun must have gone to your
  head."</p>

  <p>"And if you don't cut it off," added Larry, "then I shall."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Jacqueline that night smoked far more cigarettes than could
  possibly have been good for her, but she was not alone in her depravity. For
  fully two hours Dr. Thurston, seated on the edge of the bed, smoked cigarette
  after cigarette, and, unrebuked, dropped the ash on the counterpane, while
  Mrs. Thurston made valiant efforts to maintain an appearance of wakefulness
  and attention to what he was saying.</p>

  <p>She had a vague impression that he was very angry with Louis
  Creet&mdash;and really, if Louis was trying to do the boys out of their gold
  mine he could hardly, she supposed, be quite such a gentleman as she had
  taken him to be&mdash;and that somehow something must be done to secure fair
  play for Larry and the others.</p>

  <p>Every now and then he would say, "Are you awake, my dear?" and Mrs.
  Thurston would rouse herself with a start and say, "Of course, John, wide
  awake"; and then the doctor would light another cigarette and start
  again.</p>

  <p>Louis Creet, having taken his temperature and found it normal, slept a
  peaceful, untroubled sleep; but Mark in his room was lying in bed flat on his
  back, once again engrossed in directing smoky insults at the ceiling; Tubby,
  in incredible pyjamas, sat on his bed with knees drawn up to his chin,
  lighting one cigarette from the stub of another, staring at his feet with
  puzzled eyes as if feet were a new and perplexing phenomenon; and Larry, when
  at length he went to his room, stood most of the night lolling against the
  frame of the window, gazing at the reflection of his cigarette in the glass.
  Far into the night five cigarettes were glowing simultaneously, but when all
  the others were extinct a spot of red still glowed, faded, and glowed again
  in the darkness of Jacqueline's room.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline was seeing things clearly tonight and clearness of vision did
  not conduce to sleep. Reviewing the scene in the drawing room, she discovered
  details impressed on her memory which at the time she had not
  noticed&mdash;Mark, outwardly so calm, bending the coffee spoon until it had
  snapped; the look in Tubby's eyes&mdash;the pained, bewildered, reproachful
  look of a dog that cannot understand why anyone should have kicked it; the
  slight forward thrust of Larry's jaw which she knew so well&mdash;a kid
  setting his teeth, refusing to cry, pretending that he was not hurt. And they
  were all secretly hoping that Louis might still be induced to behave like an
  honourable man.</p>

  <p>But none of them, not even Larry, knew Louis as she knew him. They were
  only just beginning to realize that in matters of honour Louis and they spoke
  different languages, and that he could no more understand theirs than they
  his. Eighteen months&mdash;living like pigs, Tubby had said&mdash;the mine
  found, and then nothing. She knew just what that nothing meant to
  them&mdash;especially to Larry.</p>

  <p>And suddenly she realized just what it meant to herself, how much she had,
  almost unconsciously, been counting on Larry. She discovered now that without
  the secret assurance that Larry would see her through, the last few weeks
  would have been unbearable. She had thought that Larry would be a rich man,
  that she would only have to tell him that she needed a thousand pounds and
  the money would be hers, Monty Carr paid, and Louis, deprived of his whip,
  excluded from her life. As it was, Louis's intrusion into her life, she
  supposed, would only end when he grew tired of trespassing.</p>

  <p>She saw very clearly that it was all largely her fault. Jacqueline was in
  her most ruthlessly logical mood, and the fact that logic led inevitably to
  herself as the prime cause of all the trouble did not make her shirk it.</p>

  <p>It was clear why Louis had backed out of his agreement. He did not want
  Larry to be a rich man. Larry as a rich man, back in England, would not suit
  Louis's book at all. Louis was no fool. He knew as well as she did that if
  Larry had a thousand pounds Monty Carr would receive his check and he would
  be deprived of the thumbscrew which he had used on her to such good
  purpose.</p>

  <p>And it was entirely her fault for having exposed herself to the risk of
  thumbscrews. If she hadn't been a thoughtless fool&mdash;cheap, tawdry,
  shallow; she did not economize on adjectives&mdash;all this would never have
  happened. She had damaged them all, robbed them all by her thoughtless
  selfishness: Larry, Mark, Tubby and Bunty and the kiddies&mdash;it was
  appalling the way some trivial action could spread out in all directions and
  damage no end of people who had done nothing to deserve it. She wondered what
  Larry would think of her if he knew.</p>

  <p>And then came other questions: what did Larry-know? How much had he
  guessed? If he had meant what he had said about her eyes, what was he
  thinking of her now? She had let Larry down&mdash;let everybody
  down&mdash;like the little shirker that she was. And it was a lot of use,
  wasn't it, telling herself she'd been a little fool and wishing she hadn't
  been? Why not do something to put matters right?</p>

  <p>The next morning, after a breakfast eaten in an atmosphere which, despite
  all her tactful conversation and desperate cheerfulness, made Mrs. Thurston
  extremely uncomfortable, Jacqueline tucked a hand into Larry's arm and drew
  him towards the garden. Louis, catching her eye, frowned his disapproval, and
  the girl smiled. It was some slight consolation to discover that there were
  certain thumbscrews which she could apply to Louis. However much he might
  pretend to despise Larry, Louis could not conceal his jealousy of him or his
  uneasy feeling that Larry might still prove a serious complication. It could
  do no real good, of course, but she would twist that thumbscrew for all she
  was worth.</p>

  <p>When they were out of sight of the bungalow Jacqueline paused.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;hooligan?" she laughed.</p>

  <p>"Feeling better this morning, Jackie?" asked Larry. "You must be. That's
  the first really attractive smile you've produced since you've been
  here."</p>

  <p>"The others were just hideous grins, eh, Larry?"</p>

  <p>"The others," said Larry, "suggested the smile of a martyr when he feels
  the flames licking round his knees. Something pleasant happened&mdash;for a
  change?"</p>

  <p>"I confessed all my sins last night, Larry, and that always makes you feel
  better, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I've never tried it, Jackie. I'd be exhausted before my sins were. It
  must be a consolation to Louis to know that when he does start confessing
  he'll have all eternity to do it in and he needn't hurry too much."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"One of the sins I confessed," she said, "was that I'd been a beast to you
  last night. But I'm not sorry, in one way. I suppose if there hadn't been all
  that fuss about the dance Tubby wouldn't have blurted out all about Louis and
  the goldfield, and I should never have heard a word about it. You're an
  obstinate sort of oyster, Larry, aren't you? I suppose you'd have kept it all
  to yourself and let me go on thinking what a nice little gentleman Louis
  was."</p>

  <p>"Did you think so?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer that,</p>

  <p>"But even if you've no written agreement, Larry, you can prove your claim
  somehow, can't you?"</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew how," he replied. "I feel pretty rotten about it. Mark and
  Tubby, though they pretend they aren't, are feeling rather sore with me over
  it. They think that if I'd handled Louis a bit more tactfully we might have
  got something out of him. I suppose they're right. But the idea of licking
  Louis's boots for the sake of getting him to give us a few thousand as an act
  of grace when we're entitled to equal shares with him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "Not Louis's boots, anyway."</p>

  <p>She nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"And you can't force him in any way? You said last night that you weren't
  beaten yet."</p>

  <p>"Bluff, my dear," he interrupted. "Tubby's taking it pretty hard, and I
  haven't the heart to let him down with too much of a bump. But Louis has got
  us beaten all right. He's wiring for a lawyer today, so he says, and once a
  lawyer gets busy it's good-bye to Chumbaziri as far as anyone but Louis is
  concerned. I suppose it's good-bye to most things for all of us." He smiled.
  "Funny, Jackie, isn't it, the way things are dangled in front of us and just
  as we think we've got them they're jerked away? I wonder what the idea
  is&mdash;if there is one."</p>

  <p>"Speculations of a hooligan!" laughed Jacqueline. "Buck up, Larry! You're
  not dead yet. Something will happen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And several other platitudes," interrupted Larry; "such as 'Never say
  die'&mdash;'It's always darkest before the dawn'&mdash;'Every cloud has a
  silver lining'&mdash;'It's a long lane that has no turning.' Thanks, Jackie;
  you've cheered me no end. I think I shall go and get drunk now."</p>

  <p>She gazed at him with troubled eyes, perplexed and hurt by his sudden
  bitterness.</p>

  <p>"Larry, if only I could do something&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why should you?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it rather natural that I should want to?"</p>

  <p>"Is it?" said Larry. "It hadn't struck me that way. But if you want to be
  really helpful, you might try a few platitudes on Louis. 'Honesty is the best
  policy'&mdash;'Be sure your sins will find you out,' and that sort of thing.
  It's a forlorn hope, but he might pay attention if you told him. You seem to
  have a lot of influence with him."</p>

  <p>He suddenly turned, took her face between his hands and gazed earnestly
  into her eyes, and then, as suddenly, he thrust his hands into his pockets
  and stood staring at the ground.</p>

  <p>"Funny, isn't it?" he said. "I'd have betted my last bob that you
  weren't."</p>

  <p>"That I wasn't what?"</p>

  <p>"A quitter," said Larry.</p>

  <p>She glanced at him quickly, but he did not look at her, and with a sigh
  she turned away and went slowly back towards the house. What was the use of
  arguing about it? There was nothing to be done about anything. Besides, she
  was a quitter. She had loosed her grasp of everything that was really worth
  clinging to, and there seemed no prospect of her ever regaining anything
  worth having.</p>

  <p>Louis, alone on the veranda, was still wearing his disapproving frown when
  she turned the corner of the bungalow; and as he saw her his frown deepened.
  She paused on the veranda, meeting his glance with coldly hostile eyes.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Louis?" she asked. "You look as if the bottom of the
  Stock Exchange had fallen out."</p>

  <p>"What have you been saying to Larry?" he asked, and there was no mistaking
  the nervousness in his manner.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline smiled. So it wasn't only jealousy. He was nervous of Larry,
  too. Despite all his bluster, he was really afraid of him. Well, that was one
  more thumbscrew.</p>

  <p>"Saying to Larry?" she repeated, wrinkling her forehead. "Let me think....
  Oh, I believe I said wasn't the sunshine glorious, but of course it was
  terribly hot, wasn't it. Not very original, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>Louis made a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"What did you tell him about&mdash;us?"</p>

  <p>"What should I be likely to tell him about us?"</p>

  <p>"Well, there's no knowing," said Louis. "You and Larry have always been as
  thick as thieves, and I don't want any sort of trouble with him. He's the
  sort of fellow who'd make no end of a scene if he&mdash;suspected anything.
  Did he ask you anything?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"He asked me if I was seasick on the voyage."</p>

  <p>"Did he give you the impression that he&mdash;well&mdash;had any
  suspicions&mdash;that he was worried&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, Louis, I'm sure he's worried&mdash;about me."</p>

  <p>He glanced at her anxiously.</p>

  <p>"He thinks I'm different. He says my eyes are different."</p>

  <p>"Huh! Well, I don't know what he means. Still, as long as he hasn't any
  proof it doesn't matter particularly what he thinks. All the same, Jackie,
  the less you have to do with Larry in the circumstances the better. He's a
  bad-tempered devil, and he's awkward enough as it is. Did he say anything
  about me?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all surprising."</p>

  <p>"Then he did say something?"</p>

  <p>"Only that you're swindling him and Mark and Tubby out of their share in
  the mine."</p>

  <p>The blood rushed to Louis's face, and his hand gripped the arm of the
  chair. Then he gave a short, uneasy laugh.</p>

  <p>"Oh, so he said that, did he?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Is it true?"</p>

  <p>Louis, in the language of the cinema, registered pain.</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised you should ask me that, Jackie," he said. "You've no idea
  how you hurt me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is it true, Louis?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it's not true," he said irritably. "It's just the sort of
  insulting thing Larry Deans would say about me&mdash;the sort of thing he has
  been saying ever since I got out here. Because I don't choose to make him a
  present of a million pounds or so he calls me a cheat and a liar and tries to
  poison everyone's mind against me. If I have any more of it there'll be an
  action for slander&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How much is Larry getting out of the mine, Louis?"</p>

  <p>"Larry will get what he's entitled to. So will the others. Don't try to
  interfere in this, Jacqueline. It doesn't concern you. It's between me and
  Larry and the others, and I'll manage it in my own way without any
  interference from anybody."</p>

  <p>"Larry says they're each entitled to a quarter share."</p>

  <p>"Then he's a liar. If it's a question of what they're entitled to, they're
  entitled to nothing at all."</p>

  <p>"And that, roughly, is what they'll get?"</p>

  <p>Louis gave a shrug.</p>

  <p>"I refuse to discuss it with you, Jackie. You can trust me to pay Larry
  and the others whatever is due to them."</p>

  <p>"Can I?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly you can. Whatever people may say about me, no one can accuse me
  of breaking my word or of not paying what I owe."</p>

  <p>"You didn't pay Monty Carr. After giving me your word that he should be
  paid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear Jackie," interrupted Louis, "as I've al-already explained to you,
  you entirely misunderstood what I did promise. My promise was that Monty Carr
  should not press you for payment as long as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for heaven's sake, Louis," exclaimed the girl angrily, "don't hedge
  and twist and try to wriggle out of it! You made a bargain with me, and when
  I'd fulfilled my part of it you broke your word and backed out of fulfilling
  your part, and I haven't the least doubt that you're doing the same sort of
  thing with Larry and Mark and Tubby. But you can't hope to get away with that
  sort of thing every time, and you're not going to get away with it this
  time."</p>

  <p>"My dear girl, do try to control yourself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's you I'm going to control, Louis. I'm going to tell you what you're
  to do, and you're going to do it."</p>

  <p>He stared at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"You're going to give me your word. No, on second thoughts, I'll have
  something a bit more reliable than your word. You're going to have a proper
  agreement drawn up giving a quarter share each to Larry, Mark, Tubby, and
  yourself, and you're going to sign it today. And it's no use saying you won't
  sign it, because I'm going to force you to sign it."</p>

  <p>Louis smiled, but it was an uneasy sort of smile which carried little
  conviction of genuine amusement.</p>

  <p>"Force me, Jackie?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"You will either do as I say, Louis, or I shall tell
  Larry&mdash;everything."</p>

  <p>Louis's smile became more pronounced.</p>

  <p>"You don't think I'd dare?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Larry would hardly thank you for telling him&mdash;everything," he said
  drily. "He's a bit straitlaced, you know&mdash;not the sort of fellow to
  forgive&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't expect to be forgiven anything. I'm not thinking of myself now.
  You can't understand that, can you? I'm thinking of Larry. I don't care in
  the least what happens to me, or what anybody thinks of me, and I don't care
  much what I do or who gets hurt through my doing it. All I care about is
  making sure that Larry isn't swindled as I've been swindled, and either you
  do as I say or I shall tell him."</p>

  <p>"And even supposing you could bring yourself to tell him, what do you
  imagine that Larry could do?"</p>

  <p>"I know what you're afraid he'd do, Louis: you're afraid he'd kill you.
  But I'm afraid he wouldn't do that. He would hardly think you worth hanging
  for. The most I could hope for would be that he'd thrash you until you
  couldn't stand. But he'd do that for certain. I wish to God I could do it
  myself!"</p>

  <p>Louis's eyes shifted restlessly.</p>

  <p>"I don't doubt it, Jackie," he said. "I'm quite prepared to accept your
  word that Larry might behave like a blackguard and a hooligan, but I don't
  think he'll have the opportunity. You're naturally disappointed that Larry is
  not going to be the wealthy man you hoped he would be, because it has upset
  your plans as far as you and he are concerned. Your disappointment has made
  you reckless, and you've overlooked one or two points. Suppose, for instance,
  you do tell Larry everything, and suppose he does, as you hope, decide that
  I'm not worth hanging for and adopts the alternative course. What then? Larry
  will still be without his share in the mine, and your position will be
  exactly the same as it is now."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline frowned.</p>

  <p>"My position doesn't matter, Louis. I've told you that."</p>

  <p>"We'll say your father's position, then. In a few days' time we shall be
  returning to England, and whatever you may have told Larry, you will still
  owe Monty Carr a thousand pounds, and it will still be a question either of
  paying him or of appealing to your father to pay it for you. But I gathered
  that your father must on no account be allowed to know. Of course, if you
  have no objection&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She cut him short.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to argue, Louis," she said. "Will you or will you not keep
  your promise to Larry and the others and sign that agreement?"</p>

  <p>For several moments Louis lolled back in his chair, frowning thoughtfully
  and drumming his knee with his fingers. And then he sat upright.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Jackie," he said. "If Larry has been putting you up to all
  this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Larry knows nothing about it."</p>

  <p>"In any case," said Louis, "please understand that I'm not going to be
  threatened and bullied and coerced by you or Larry or anybody else. I'm not
  going to sign any agreement, and you can tell Larry what you like. If there's
  any trouble with Larry I fancy I can deal with him."</p>

  <p>She shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Is that final, Louis?"</p>

  <p>"There's just this I want to say," he said. "I promised you that, so long
  as you were reasonable, Monty Carr should not press you for the thousand
  pounds you owe him. So long as you were reasonable, Jackie."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I just want to warn you, my dear, that I don't consider you are
  being reasonable. You accuse me of not keeping my side of our bargain, but
  you can't pretend that you've kept your side. All through the voyage you
  deliberately avoided me, and I don't think I've had five minutes alone with
  you since we left London. You mustn't treat me like that, Jackie. I'm very
  much in love with you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for God's sake, Louis, don't be foul!"</p>

  <p>Creet's mouth hardened.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "Since that's your attitude I'll keep my feelings to
  myself. But understand this. I didn't bring you on this trip so that you
  could make a fool of me, and you've got to be a damned sight more reasonable
  over things in the future than you have been in the past. You know what I
  mean. And if you don't choose to be reasonable&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>Louis rose from his chair, smiling.</p>

  <p>"I fancy you will be&mdash;for your father's sake," he said and went into
  the bungalow.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Jacqueline took out her cigarette case, lighted a cigarette,
  and, with a rather wry smile, flung herself into the chair. So Louis had
  called her bluff. She had half expected that he would. Louis was no fool,
  particularly where a woman was concerned, and she had feared all along that
  he knew her well enough to be sure that she would suffer anything rather than
  tell Larry the truth; and of course it had been too much to hope that he
  would not realize that telling Larry the truth could not possibly do Larry or
  Mark or Tubby any good or make her own position any better. But it had been
  worth trying. Louis was a dreadful coward, and there had been just the bare
  chance that his fear of what Larry might do might induce him to come to some
  sort of terms over the mine. She had robbed Larry of so much, cheap little
  quitter that she was, and she had felt that if she could wring any sort of
  concession from Louis she would at least have made some slight amends. She
  had felt that she owed that debt to Larry. She still felt that.</p>

  <p>But it had not come off. Louis had called her bluff, and the net result
  was that, without doing the least good to Larry, she had made things far more
  difficult for herself. Louis, as a hint of what she might expect if she chose
  to be obstinate, had given the thumbscrew a preliminary twist. She was to be
  more "reasonable."</p>

  <p>That, of course, had been bound to come sooner or later. She had wondered
  how long Louis would allow her unreasonableness to continue without protest;
  and during the voyage she had been at pains to give him no opportunity of
  broaching the subject. She had no idea of what she must do if Louis should
  become insistent, and had been thankful for every day that passed without
  forcing her to face the problem and come to a decision.</p>

  <p>But she must face the problem now. Louis had started cracking his whip,
  and she did not doubt that, if she proved obstinate, he would use it. She
  must find some way of escape. She saw very clearly now that reasonableness
  was out of the question. All the time during the voyage, when she had thought
  of it, she had told herself that, but always at the back of her mind had been
  the knowledge that, in the last resort, she might have to submit. "You've
  never let me down yet, Jackie," her father had said. And in any case, she had
  reflected, it did not much matter one way or the other.</p>

  <p>But submission now was impossible. Louis, after all, was not particularly
  clever. He had not had the intelligence to realize that, if he wanted her to
  be reasonable and docile, it was hardly wise to bring her to
  Benguella&mdash;and Larry. He should have known that seeing Larry again would
  arouse old feelings, revive memories, renew thoughts which would make
  reasonableness unthinkable. Louis, she supposed, was unaware of the
  possibility of such subtle emotions. Or was it simply that he was confident
  of playing so compelling a tune that, in spite of Larry, she could not choose
  but dance to it?</p>

  <p>It did not matter, anyway. What mattered was to find some way out of it
  all, some sanctuary from Louis's demands; to put a gulf between herself and
  Louis so wide that his whip could not reach her. And on her side of the gulf
  must be her father, her mother, Larry, Tubby, and Mark....</p>

  <p>For an hour she sat there, her forehead puckered, absorbed in her problem,
  scarcely moving except to toss away the stub of a cigarette and light
  another. And at the end of an hour, though her eyes were still grave, the
  hint of a smile&mdash;a cold, contemptuous smile&mdash;just touched her lips
  and vanished; and then she rose, with an air of sudden resolution, hurried to
  her bedroom, and began rummaging in her cabin trunk.</p>

  <p>During lunch&mdash;another meal with an "atmosphere"&mdash;she was almost
  vivacious. There was a touch of colour in her cheeks; the pucker which for
  weeks had been a permanent fixture between her eyebrows had disappeared, and
  her eyes seemed somehow more alive. Her hands were restless&mdash;never
  still; and she kept up a flow of trivial nonsense throughout the meal,
  talking desperately, as if on no account must a lull be allowed in the
  conversation. Every now and then, as she glanced at Louis, that same
  contemptuous smile would touch her lips and vanish.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston decided that Jackie was quite herself again and wondered
  what had worked the change in her. Larry, perhaps, had asked her to marry
  him. If Larry intended asking her to marry him it was certainly time he did
  it; they had been here several days already.</p>

  <p>Young people were so casual nowadays. She glanced at Larry and sighed. No;
  she didn't think it could be Larry. Larry didn't look at all like a young man
  who has just become engaged. There was a look in his eyes&mdash;yes, that was
  it&mdash;the dog which John had been obliged to have shot when they were in
  the country because it went mad or something. The dog's eyes had looked very
  much as Larry's eyes looked now. And really, when you spoke to him he snapped
  at you very much like a bad-tempered dog....</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston, noting Jacqueline's symptoms, frowned. Something was wrong
  with Jackie, he decided. A touch of the sun, perhaps; but he did not think
  so. Nervous&mdash;almost hysterical. He had seen women like that before an
  operation, but it was unlike Jackie to get worked up to that pitch over
  anything. She was usually so calm, matter-of-fact, casual. He'd have a look
  at her after lunch.</p>

  <p>After lunch he drew her aside.</p>

  <p>"Feeling all right, Jackie?"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline had learned from experience that when her father suspected her
  of not feeling right it was useless to say that there was nothing wrong with
  her; and now, though she could not remember ever having felt quite so right,
  she thought it wiser to satisfy him with some trivial ailment and save
  further questioning.</p>

  <p>"A bit of a head," she said.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Tubby's got a car," he said, "and is going to take us around, but you'd
  be wiser to stay out of the sun. I'd lie down for a bit if I were you."</p>

  <p>"I think I will, Father."</p>

  <p>She went to her room, sat in a chair, and lighted a cigarette; and half an
  hour later, watching from the window, she saw them go&mdash;Tubby and her
  mother in the front seat, Mark and her father behind. She smiled but did not
  move. A few minutes later, as she saw Larry go striding out of the gate, she
  rose, glanced in the mirror, touched her face with a powder puff, and went to
  look for Louis.</p>

  <p>She found him in the drawing room. As she entered and stood beside his
  chair, her hands thrust into the pockets of her white silk cardigan, he
  glanced up and gave her a friendly smile.</p>

  <p>"Head better, my dear?"</p>

  <p>"Quite, thanks."</p>

  <p>His glance swept over her appreciatively.</p>

  <p>"You're looking wonderful today, darling," he said; "quite your old self
  again. I like that jumper thing you're wearing."</p>

  <p>"I like a garment with pockets," she smiled. "Father has often said that I
  should have been a boy; I suppose that's one of the signs."</p>

  <p>He drew her left hand from her pocket and held it between his own.</p>

  <p>"Forgiven me, Jackie? I'm afraid I was very short-tempered with you this
  morning, but you must try to make allowances. I've been very worried, and I'm
  afraid it has made me irritable."</p>

  <p>"You weren't exactly&mdash;pleasant, Louis. I put it down to the
  heat."</p>

  <p>"I've had nothing but trouble since I came here," he went on. "All this
  unpleasantness over the mine. But we shall soon be out of it all now, thank
  goodness. There's a boat next Wednesday, and we shall be able to leave by
  then. This is a God-forsaken country."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline nodded.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking last night," she said, "that God does seem to have
  forsaken it. Larry and Tubby and Mark must think so, too. I mean, if God
  hadn't forsaken it, you'd expect to find some sort of justice and fair play
  and decency, wouldn't you?"</p>

  <p>He glanced at her sharply, dropping her hand.</p>

  <p>"Larry must be sorry he ever came| to Africa," she added. "All those
  months, and then to go back to England with absolutely nothing. England will
  be a bit dreary for Larry, I should think."</p>

  <p>Louis frowned.</p>

  <p>"Larry won't go to England," he said sharply.</p>

  <p>"But he was telling me yesterday&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Whatever he told you, you can take it from me that he daren't show his
  nose there. He's up to his ears in debt, and he'd be met with a swarm of
  writs. I've only kept his creditors quiet so far by kidding them that he'd
  soon be a rich man."</p>

  <p>"When you knew that he wouldn't be?"</p>

  <p>He gave a shrug.</p>

  <p>"I just want you to realize that you mustn't count on Larry being in
  England." He took her hand again. "Listen, Jackie," he said. "I want you to
  try to be sensible. Larry is no good to you. I know you've always been a
  loyal friend to him, and I admire you immensely for your loyalty, but you
  must realize by this time that he isn't worth it. He has never done anything,
  and I'm afraid it's only too obvious that he never will. You'd be throwing
  yourself away on a fellow like Larry."</p>

  <p>He paused, watching her face anxiously. But her face told him nothing.</p>

  <p>"And I want you to believe, darling," he continued, "that I really am very
  fond of you. I've been thinking things over, and I've one or two plans for
  when we get back to England. I mean to give you a splendid time. I'll take a
  little flat for you&mdash;somewhere convenient&mdash;where you can do just as
  you like. A girl likes to have a place of her own, doesn't she? We'll go
  along somewhere and choose the furniture together. I expect you'd like a
  piano&mdash;for your singing&mdash;wouldn't you? A love nest, eh, Jackie,
  just for you and me?"</p>

  <p>She wanted to smile. He was making what she had feared might be a
  difficult task much easier. She wanted to hit him, too. But she managed to
  suppress both longings.</p>

  <p>"What about your wife, Louis?" she said.</p>

  <p>He frowned.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately, darling, we needn't discuss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we must. You told me when we were in England that you would
  agree to a divorce. Do your plans include that?"</p>

  <p>Louis's eyes avoided hers.</p>

  <p>"That's a matter which doesn't rest with me," he said. "Naturally, I
  should much prefer my wife to give me my freedom, but I can't force her to
  divorce me."</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose not," agreed Jacqueline. "But I'm sure you've done all in
  your power to induce her to."</p>

  <p>He glanced at her sharply. What the dickens did she mean by that remark?
  Again her face told him nothing.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you quite realize how difficult it all is, Jackie," he
  said. "My wife is a very religious woman, and her religion doesn't really
  allow her to petition for a divorce. That's the whole trouble. It's a matter
  of conscience with her. Naturally I hope that in the end she'll be sensible
  about it."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline gave a little laugh.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Louis," she said. "I suppose it's nothing to laugh at, but you
  really are rather marvellous. The truth is that you're scared stiff in case
  your wife divorces you. Is there really any chance of it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course there's a chance," replied Creet irritably. "And as soon as she
  does divorce me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll find some really nice girl who's fond of you and marry her."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I should marry you, Jackie."</p>

  <p>"Some really nice girl who's fond of you, I said, Louis. I don't fill the
  bill. I'm not really at all a nice girl, and I've never pretended to be fond
  of you."</p>

  <p>Louis made a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why we're discussing all this now," he said. "It's no use
  talking of marriage until the divorce is an accomplished fact, and in the
  meantime&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In the meantime," she interrupted, "you're inviting me to carry on a
  cheap little secret intrigue, a nasty, furtive, sordid affair, all lies and
  hypocrisy and petty little deceptions&mdash;never daring to look my father in
  the face, always wondering if he suspects, feeling all the time that I'm
  being cheap and tawdry and&mdash;messy. But I suppose I shouldn't mind all
  that&mdash;as long as I've a piano!</p>

  <p>Louis sighed.</p>

  <p>"I wish you wouldn't talk like that, darling," he said reproachfully. "You
  hurt me very much when you're so bitter. I suppose it's seeing Larry
  again&mdash;he has been talking to you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He has made me feel like something that crawls, Louis."</p>

  <p>"You're so sensitive&mdash;far too sensitive. People don't make a fuss
  about that sort of thing nowadays, and you've no reason to feel like that
  about it. After all, darling, if you look at it in a practical way, I can
  look after you far better than Larry could ever hope to, and there's nothing
  I wouldn't do to make you happy and take care of you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean that?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I mean it. You don't realize how I'm longing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, you may have your chance."</p>

  <p>He shot her a quick, nervous glance.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing wrong, Jackie, is there; I mean, apart from Larry, you're
  not worried&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I am. You remember that night&mdash;on the way out to the
  Cape&mdash;at the fancy-dress dance? I began to wonder then, because I've
  never fainted before in my life. Daddy said it was the heat, and you thought
  it was the heat, and I let it go at that. I wasn't sure myself that it wasn't
  the heat&mdash;then."</p>

  <p>There was consternation in Louis's eyes.</p>

  <p>"On our way to the Cape? Five weeks ago! But you said nothing&mdash;I had
  no idea&mdash;why didn't you tell me?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Of all the poisonous luck!" exclaimed Louis. "I'd have given five
  thousand pounds for this not to have happened."</p>

  <p>"That's a lot of money, Louis&mdash;more than you gave for me."</p>

  <p>"That sort of remark doesn't help in the least," snapped Creet. "I'm
  worried out of my life. First of all, that trouble over the mine, and now
  this. Does your mother&mdash;do you think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Nor Father. Nobody&mdash;yet."</p>

  <p>Louis's face showed his relief.</p>

  <p>"This is a dreadful shock to me," he said. "Just think what it means for
  me if a thing like this gets known&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It might possibly mean something for me, too. Perhaps that hasn't
  occurred to you."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;of course&mdash;I realize it's dreadful for you too, my dear.
  But you mustn't get in a panic about it. You can rely on me."</p>

  <p>"I am relying on you."</p>

  <p>"I won't let you down, Jackie. Whatever people may say about me, I've
  never let a woman down in my life. I'll think out something. Just leave it to
  me."</p>

  <p>"There doesn't seem much to think out," said Jacqueline. "I should have
  thought it was quite obvious what's to be done. The usual thing in cases of
  this kind is for the man to marry the girl."</p>

  <p>"My dear Jackie," began Louis impatiently, "you know very well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That you can't marry me until you're divorced. Yes, I realize that. But
  that simply means that you must get the divorce at once, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;of course. But I've explained the difficulties to you, and in
  any case it would be bound to take some time. In the meantime you must trust
  me."</p>

  <p>"I can't."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Jackie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can't trust you," she repeated. "I don't intend to trust you. I trusted
  you once&mdash;over Monty Carr&mdash;and you let me down&mdash;backed out of
  your promise and set up in the blackmailing business&mdash;and I don't mean
  to give you the chance of letting me down again. You're going to get divorced
  at once. It can be managed somewhere. Reno, isn't it? There's no difficulty,
  anyway, if you really want a divorce and have the money. Of course you don't
  want a divorce. It matters so dreadfully to you what people think of you, and
  I know that if you can possibly wriggle out of it and save your own face
  you'll do it and let me go hang."</p>

  <p>"For goodness' sake, Jackie, try to control yourself," implored Creet.
  "Someone will hear you."</p>

  <p>"But you're not going to wriggle out of this," continued Jacqueline.
  "You're going to behave like a gentleman for once. You're going to cable
  straight away to your solicitors and get them to start things moving over the
  divorce, and I'm going to see the cable sent."</p>

  <p>"Really, Jackie, there's no need to make all this fuss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I intend to make a fuss," said Jacqueline. "You've had everything your
  own way so far, but you're up against it this time. Either you'll do as I say
  or I'll make every kind of a fuss I can think of rather than let you sneak
  out of it and leave me to face the music. That was the programme, wasn't it?
  But the programme's cancelled. Will you send that cable&mdash;today?"</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, be sensible," said Louis testily. "It's not the least
  use sending a cable. Until I get back to England and can see my wife and
  persuade her to file her petition, there's nothing to be done. Please don't
  make things more difficult than they are."</p>

  <p>"You won't cable?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Jacqueline. "Then you'll sit down now, Louis, and write
  a statement admitting that you're&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll write nothing," interrupted Creet furiously. "I'll admit nothing. In
  any case, I've only got your word for it, and if you expect me to make
  admissions on the mere word of an hysterical girl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then you do mean to let me down?"</p>

  <p>"I've said no such thing, Jacqueline. I've promised to do everything in my
  power to look after you. But to ask me to give myself away in a written
  statement&mdash;you must be clean out of your senses."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Jacqueline. "It's not uncommon for a girl in my position
  to go clean out of her senses. Frankly, Louis, if you mean to let me down
  over this there's not much I'd stick at, and if I don't get some sort of a
  hold over you, you will let me down as sure as fate, and then&mdash;well, I
  just couldn't face it. So I've got to have that statement, and I mean to have
  it&mdash;now. Get a move on, please."</p>

  <p>"I absolutely refuse&mdash;" began Creet and paused abruptly, his gaze
  riveted on Jacqueline's right hand. She had withdrawn it from the pocket of
  her cardigan, and in it he had caught sight of the shining barrel of a
  revolver.</p>

  <p>"Jackie&mdash;for God's sake&mdash;if that thing's loaded&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not bluffing this time, Louis," she said. "It is loaded."</p>

  <p>"Then for heaven's sake don't fool about with it."</p>

  <p>"Father gave it to me," she said, "before we started on the trip. He said
  he'd feel happier if I had some means of protecting myself out here, and I
  laughed at him. But he was right. You're just about as dangerous a sort of
  beast as one could meet anywhere, Louis, and I'm going to protect
  myself."</p>

  <p>He took a step towards her, but as she turned swiftly and faced him, he
  halted and stood gazing with terrified eyes at the small shining weapon in
  her hand.</p>

  <p>"Jackie&mdash;listen! You haven't understood, you know. You've misjudged
  me terribly. I'm not going to let you down."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't get nervous, Louis," she interrupted, with a smile of contempt.
  "Don't get scared into telling all sorts of lies because you're afraid I
  shall shoot you if you don't calm me down. I'm not out of my senses by a very
  long way, and I'm not proposing to kill you. I don't think I've the pluck to
  face the consequences of killing you. If I'd had the pluck I'd have killed
  you long before this&mdash;that evening&mdash;in London&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jackie, put that damned thing down."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I've every reason in the world for killing you," she said, "and I
  daresay, when I said why I'd killed you, I'd get away with it. But I'm not
  going to risk it; and in any case it wouldn't solve my problem for me, would
  it?" She smiled. "There's no need for you to repent yet, Louis, as far as I'm
  concerned."</p>

  <p>Louis's eyes showed his relief, but he was still watching the revolver in
  her hand.</p>

  <p>"In that case, Jackie, the sooner you stop this stupid fooling&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's not that. I'm not thinking of shooting you, but if you don't
  write that statement you'll be in a nasty mess, all the same&mdash;much worse
  than just getting divorced. I've written a letter to Father telling him
  everything that has happened since that night when Monty Carr did that neat
  little card trick. I suppose you'd fixed that with him, hadn't you? But never
  mind. The point is that if you won't do as I ask you, I'm too much of a
  coward to face what's coming to me then, and I prefer&mdash;this."</p>

  <p>She held up the revolver.</p>

  <p>"Jackie!" gasped Creet. "You don't mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's the easiest way," said Jacqueline, "if you decide to shirk, as I
  fancy you will. If you don't intend shirking, do as I ask you and give me the
  statement. If you refuse, then you do mean to shirk, and I know what to do.
  Father will have my letter&mdash;afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Jackie&mdash;listen!" begged Creet, and there was a note of desperation
  in his voice. "It's no use talking like that. I'm not going to let you down.
  But you must give me time to think. Put that thing away and let me
  think."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline smiled.</p>

  <p>"Righto, Louis; think now," she said. "I'll wait&mdash;if you're not too
  long."</p>

  <p>He began pacing the room, frowning heavily, and Jacqueline, seated on the
  arm of a chair, toyed with the revolver, watching his face. He paused by the
  window, lighted a cigarette with unsteady hands, and stood staring out into
  the garden. Every now and then, though he did not move his head, she saw his
  eyes glance at the revolver. There was a look of amusement in her eyes and a
  faint smile on her lips, but her heart was pounding. She had the feeling that
  she was balanced on a thin, taut wire which might at any moment snap beneath
  her.</p>

  <p>Creet turned towards her.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Jackie," he said. "I think I understand what has turned you
  against me like this. It's Larry, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>She gave a shrug.</p>

  <p>"You're bitter against me about Larry," he went on. "You think I've
  treated you badly and treated him badly. Well, I admit I haven't quite played
  the game&mdash;from your point of view. I haven't played the game with him,
  and I haven't played it with you. You're still very fond of him, aren't
  you?"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline made no reply, and Louis went on.</p>

  <p>"This is the time to be sensible, my dear, and not to sulk. That gets us
  nowhere. As a matter of fact, I don't dislike Larry. He's a bad-tempered
  brute, but there's a lot about him that's likable. Half the trouble with him
  is jealousy, and I can quite understand it. I suppose he's as fond of you as
  any man could be. Why not&mdash;have a talk with him?"</p>

  <p>"What about?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer that. He began pacing the room again.</p>

  <p>"I don't know exactly what Larry owes in England," he continued. "Six or
  seven thousand pounds, I believe. Say ten thousand. It's a lot of money, but
  I'm not the man to jib at the expense when it's a question of protecting you,
  my dear, and if he'll be reasonable I'm quite willing to fix up all those
  debts of his."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline frowned.</p>

  <p>"What does 'reasonable' mean in Larry's case?"</p>

  <p>"You might at any rate sound him, Jackie, and see how he feels about it.
  He'll be more likely to listen to you than to me. After all, if the mine is
  half as rich or a tenth as rich as it's supposed to be, I needn't worry over
  ten thousand pounds. In any case, you've got to be protected."</p>

  <p>"But what have Larry's debts to do with protecting me?"</p>

  <p>He went to her and laid a hand on her arm.</p>

  <p>"It's pretty hard for me, Jackie," he said. "I'm tremendously fond of you,
  and I've been looking forward&mdash;but never mind. This isn't the time to
  let sentiment stand in the way, and if I have to suffer I must try to put up
  with it. It wouldn't be easy, my dear, to give you up&mdash;hand you over to
  some other man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see!" interrupted Jacqueline. "I wondered what all this had to do
  with protecting me. So you'll get me out of my trouble by finding me a
  husband and marrying me off! Quite mediaeval, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"If you're still fond of Larry, it seems the only possible way. I don't
  pretend it won't cut me up pretty badly, but there's you to be thought of and
  your father and mother&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let's have it clear, Louis," said Jacqueline. "Your suggestion is that
  you should pay Larry's debts on condition that he takes me off your hands by
  marrying me. Is that it?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"But that's not quite all, is it? There's still Monty Carr. When Larry and
  I are married we shan't want Monty Carr hanging about our doorstep asking for
  a thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"You can trust me to settle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can't. I've told you so. If you want to get rid of me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For God's sake don't talk like that!" exclaimed Creet irritably. "Of
  course I don't want to lose you. But you've got to be protected."</p>

  <p>"If you really want to protect me you must protect me from Monty Carr too.
  In other words, unless you write me a check for a thousand pounds you must
  write that statement instead. Otherwise I prefer my programme to yours."</p>

  <p>Louis hesitated.</p>

  <p>"How do I know&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;that if you give me the check I shan't worry you any more?" She
  shrugged. "You must take my word for it. Blackmail isn't in my line."</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"0h, no; I'm not blackmailing you now, Louis. I'm just asking you to pay a
  debt which you promised to pay long ago. You can do as you like about
  it."</p>

  <p>For some moments Louis seemed undecided, and then he gave a shrug.</p>

  <p>"I'll cable to London and get it paid into your account. I'll see to it at
  once."</p>

  <p>As he went from the room Jacqueline seated herself in an armchair, rested
  her elbows on her knees, and covered her face with her hands.</p>

  <p>She was free. Again and again she told herself. Louis did not want her any
  more&mdash;was glad to be rid of her&mdash;and she was free; free of Louis,
  of Monty Carr, of the constant fear, of the cheap little hypocrisies and
  deceptions, of the dread of meeting her father's eyes. She thought of Larry,
  and Larry's eyes. She wondered if she would ever again be able to meet
  Larry's eyes without flinching. It hurt her unbearably to think of Larry, yet
  she could not tear her thoughts away from him.</p>

  <p>And then, at a touch on her shoulder, she raised her head and found Larry
  standing beside her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Larry's face was very grave. She smiled up at him.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Larry! I thought you went out."</p>

  <p>"Just for five minutes," he said. "Since then I've been sitting&mdash;out
  there." He nodded towards the veranda. "So it's pretty bad, eh, Jackie?"</p>

  <p>She rested her head in her hands again.</p>

  <p>"How much did you hear, Larry?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite a lot. I listened&mdash;shamelessly. You've got to scrap all
  sense of decency when you're dealing with a Louis Creet."</p>

  <p>"Then you heard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That Louis is planning to protect your good name in a typically ingenious
  way. You're a rotten little coward, Jackie, aren't you? Why didn't you plug
  him and chance it? You didn't really imagine he'd stand by you, did you?"</p>

  <p>"There's no reason why he should, Larry. Fortunately, I don't need
  protecting&mdash;in that way."</p>

  <p>"You mean that&mdash;that what you told Louis&mdash;isn't true?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I see," said Larry. "Thank God for that, anyway! It makes things a bit
  easier. But it might have been true, might it?"</p>

  <p>"0h, for heaven's sake, Larry, don't start cross-examining me."</p>

  <p>"Right&mdash;I won't. After all, there's no need to ask you that. If it
  couldn't have been true Louis wouldn't have taken the bait and been so
  anxious to protect himself. Besides, I'd guessed that much. You've been a
  damned little fool, Jackie, haven't you? I wish you were a boy."</p>

  <p>She glanced at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"If you were a boy," he said savagely, "I'd give you the biggest hiding
  you'd ever had in your life for being a nasty, cheap little quitter. Louis
  Creet! And all the time I was thinking&mdash;picturing you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Larry&mdash;please!" begged the girl. "You can't tell me anything about
  myself that I don't know already. You can't call me anything I haven't called
  myself a hundred times. I know exactly what I've been&mdash;just one of a
  gang of empty-headed young fools, flitting between dance and cocktail party
  and night club and heaven knows where else, being clever and modern and
  sophisticated, trampling on everything that's really worth having,
  wisecracking all the decencies out of existence, always after some fresh
  excitement, not caring whom we let down, thinking nothing matters but our own
  rotten little selves. I know it all, Larry. There's no need to rub it
  in."</p>

  <p>"Sorry," said Larry. "I didn't mean to rub it in. But it's all a bit of a
  shock, you know. When a man has stuck a girl on a pedestal&mdash;as every
  fool of a man does some girl&mdash;he always blames the girl for coming a
  cropper instead of blaming himself for having expected a human being to be an
  angel, specially for his benefit. But all this messy sort of business isn't
  like you, Jackie. I'd have betted on you."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline sighed.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to say to you, Larry," she said. "I've been hoping all
  along that you'd never know. I made up my mind that I wouldn't let you know.
  I thought it out during the voyage and had it all cut and dried. I meant to
  treat you in an offhand, casual sort of way, just like any chance
  acquaintance, keep you at a safe distance, snub you if you started asking
  questions, and get away with it that way. But somehow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It hasn't worked out according to plan?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I can't treat you like that. You're a poisonous sort of person, you know,
  Larry. I never could make a good job of telling you a lie."</p>

  <p>Larry grinned.</p>

  <p>"Just as well we're not married, Jackie," he said. "You've had a splendid
  tutor, too, in Louis Creet. How did it start&mdash;money? Don't tell me if
  you'd rather not."</p>

  <p>"Money had a good deal to do with it," said Jacqueline. "You see, after
  you left England&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused. No; she mustn't tell him that. She couldn't tell him now that
  if he had not left England it would never have happened, that it was because
  she had believed she would never see him again that she had begun to drift,
  not caring what became of her so long as she could banish thought for a while
  and deaden feeling. She couldn't go whining for his pity, offering her love
  of him as an excuse. She did not want his pity, and she would not have him
  think that she expected more than pity from him now.</p>

  <p>"After you left England," she said, "and there was nobody to keep me in
  order, I&mdash;well, I got a bit out of hand, Larry. It was just rather
  stupid&mdash;no real harm in it; but that sort of thing costs money, and
  bills came pouring in, and I didn't care so long as I could carry on and have
  a hectic time. Louis took me about a good deal. I don't know why I let him,
  except that he had a Rolls and plenty of money, and Father and Mother both
  liked him. I just didn't care as long as I could keep up the pace. Sometimes
  I hated myself&mdash;and was glad you weren't there to see me&mdash;but not
  often. You'd have hated me like poison then, Larry."</p>

  <p>"I'd have clipped your ear," said Larry. " But go on."</p>

  <p>"Bills, bills, bills&mdash;nothing but bills," said Jacqueline, "and I
  simply couldn't ask Father for the money&mdash;he had none, anyway&mdash;and
  I had to do something desperate to get out of the mess."</p>

  <p>"Enter Louis Creet, eh?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"But it was all my fault really," she said. "If I hadn't been the little
  fool I was it could never have happened. I asked Louis to take me to a
  gambling place&mdash;plagued him until he did. We went several times, and
  then one night I staked a thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"And lost?"</p>

  <p>"And couldn't pay&mdash;naturally," said Jacqueline. "It wasn't on the
  square, Larry, but that doesn't matter.</p>

  <p>I lost my head&mdash;I was crazy with worry over the bills&mdash;and made
  the bet and lost. And then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can guess the rest," said Larry. "Louis offered to come to the
  rescue&mdash;on certain conditions. But you must have been pretty
  hard-pressed, Jackie."</p>

  <p>"It was Father," she explained. "I couldn't let him down. And then Mother
  was ill and had to have a voyage. But there's no need to go into all
  that&mdash;except that I'd like you to believe, Larry, that once I was in the
  mess there was no other way out of it. That's not an excuse, though. And
  then, when I'd kept my side of the bargain, Louis backed out of
  his&mdash;refused to pay the thousand unless I came with him on the voyage.
  And all the time he has been holding it over my head&mdash;trying to force
  me.... Oh, for heaven's sake, Larry, don't let's talk about it."</p>

  <p>Larry's mouth was grim and the mad-dog look was in his eyes again.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Jackie," he said. "Leave this to me, will you? There's only one
  way to deal with a swine like Creet, and I'm going to deal with him. I've a
  score or two of my own to settle in any case, and by God he's not going to
  get away with this lot. I'm glad you didn't shoot the cad. If there's any
  shooting to be done it's my business&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She laid a hand quickly on his arm.</p>

  <p>"No, Larry&mdash;please!"</p>

  <p>He stood frowning at her, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"By all the laws of decency," he said, "Louis is due for the high
  jump."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He isn't worth it, Larry. I'm not worth it, either. I've done enough
  damage already, and whatever damage Louis has done in the past doesn't really
  matter now. At any rate, nothing you can do can undo what has been done."</p>

  <p>"But this can't go on," he protested. "If there's no other way you must
  tell your father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Father must never know, Larry. I may be a nasty little fool who deserves
  a good hiding, but there's no need for Father to know it. I've kept it from
  him so far, and there's no object in telling him now."</p>

  <p>Larry frowned.</p>

  <p>"A thousand quid!" he said. "And if Louis had played the game with us I
  could have given you ten thousand without batting an eyelid and been glad of
  the chance."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Larry. I knew that. But there's no need to worry any more about
  the thousand pounds. Louis is going to pay that&mdash;to get rid of me. He
  has promised to arrange it at once."</p>

  <p>"And you believed him?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"'He had ruined her life, yet still she trusted him,' as Tubby would say.
  He'll give you a post-dated check on a bank that's gone broke and get you to
  give him twopence for the stamp, Jackie. And don't expect me to be sorry for
  you, because you ought to know better. If Louis kept a promise he'd die of
  suppressed dishonesty and a rush of remorse to the heart. Someone ought to
  smack you."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He'll keep his promise this time. He's cabling to London for the money to
  be transferred to my account. He's probably running to the bank to arrange it
  now. He's in a terrible hurry to get rid of me."</p>

  <p>"What does he think you've got&mdash;fever?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I knew Louis," she said, smiling. "I couldn't go on, Larry. I
  just had to get free of it all somehow, and I could see no other way of doing
  it. I feel pretty sure that I could manage it that way. Louis is scared out
  of his life of being connected with any scandal, and when I insisted that he
  must get divorced and marry me he was at his wit's end how to get out of it.
  Did you know he's married?"</p>

  <p>"I knew he was married. His wife died five years ago.</p>

  <p>She shrugged a shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I might have guessed that," she said, "but I didn't. But I guessed what
  would happen if Louis believed that I was going to be a liability and an
  inconvenience and possibly the dickens of a nuisance to him. He'd promise to
  stand by me and protect me and all the rest of it, and take the first
  opportunity of getting rid of me and leaving me flat. I counted on that.
  That's why I told him what I did tell him. And it came off. He's scared stiff
  and anxious to get rid of me as quickly as possible. I'm worrying no more
  about Louis."</p>

  <p>Larry nodded.</p>

  <p>"Good for you, Jackie."</p>

  <p>"I'm not proud of it."</p>

  <p>"You can't be squeamish with a swine like Creet."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not. All the same&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She covered her face with her hands again, and sat for some moments in
  silence. Then:</p>

  <p>"Larry!"</p>

  <p>"Hullo!"</p>

  <p>"Is it the least use saying I'm sorry?"</p>

  <p>She felt his hands grasp her wrists and draw her to her feet; and as she
  raised her head she saw the lines around his mouth crease into a smile.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you a damned little fool, Jackie!" he said.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he pulled her almost roughly towards him, and his lips were
  pressed against hers. Her hands flew back to her face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Larry&mdash;why&mdash;did you do that&mdash;now?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, good Lord, now you're crying!" exclaimed Larry. "What the dickens is
  there to cry about? Want a handkerchief?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Mine smells of tobacco&mdash;Maholesburg&mdash;smoke two pipes and have
  the room to yourself&mdash;but you're welcome to it."</p>

  <p>Again she shook her head, and for some moments he stood gazing at her with
  an air of bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"Jackie!"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, shut up! You're ugly enough at the best of times, and
  if you go and make your nose red&mdash;I say, shall I go?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and he strode to the door.</p>

  <p>"Larry?"</p>

  <p>He paused and turned to find her looking across at him with brimming
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Just&mdash;thanks, Larry." He smiled at her.</p>

  <p>"Stick it, Jerry," he said. "Another ten miles and you're over the
  hill."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline sang to them that evening. She felt that she must sing, that
  she must have some outlet for her pent-up feelings. It had been hard at first
  to realize that she was actually free of Louis, that the bargain was
  definitely done with, that she was mistress of herself again, at no one's
  beck and call. But as the realization had gradually seeped into her mind it
  had seemed to her that she had emerged from a dark, enveloping cloud that
  blotted out all that was beautiful and stepped into brilliant sunshine. She
  had been aware of an urgent need to tell someone; and since there was no one
  who could be told she had shut herself in her bedroom and told herself again
  and again that it was true.</p>

  <p>And in the evening she found relief in singing. The doctor, watching her,
  smiled with satisfaction; Jackie was obviously as right as rain, and he had
  worried himself for nothing. Mrs. Thurston, quick to note the change in her,
  decided that something had happened while they had been out that afternoon,
  and that she must visit Jacqueline's room this evening and see if she could
  get the child to tell her anything. Even the expression on Larry's face,
  which struck her as more forbidding than ever, did not seriously shake her
  conviction that the exciting event had actually happened at last. She must
  reconcile herself, she supposed, to the fact that Larry would probably bite
  the parson on his wedding day. She wondered whether, when she said good-night
  to him this evening, it would be tactful of her to kiss him.</p>

  <p>Louis Creet, playing her accompaniments, showed every symptom of being
  more than usually pleased with himself&mdash;so much so that Tubby, glowering
  from a chair by the window, felt an almost ungovernable longing to drive his
  fist into his smiling face; while Mark, being of a more speculative turn of
  mind, stared at the ceiling and wondered why a so-called benevolent Nature
  should create cobras and tsetse flies and cholera germs and Louis Creets.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline, noting Creet's complacency, smiled too. He was so clearly
  showing his relief at being well out of an awkward situation that she felt
  amused rather than resentful. After all, it was useless feeling resentment
  against him now; it was over and done with, and tonight she could feel no
  resentment against anyone. Besides, she had been too clever for Louis, beaten
  him soundly and made him accept her terms; and if she had used weapons which
  were not exactly above criticism&mdash;well, St. George would probably have
  been killed by the dragon if he had tried to fight it under Queensberry
  rules.</p>

  <p>When the others had gone to their rooms she lingered a few minutes in the
  drawing room, shutting the piano and then standing by the window, seeing new
  magic in the moonlit African night. She was disturbed by the sound of the
  door being opened, and turned to see Louis entering the room.</p>

  <p>"I have been thinking things over, my dear, after our little chat this
  afternoon," he said, "and I think you will agree with me that the arrangement
  we made is not quite a fair one."</p>

  <p>She faced him, frowning, her eyes searching his.</p>

  <p>"Well, Louis?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, I intend to do everything in my power to protect you. I'm
  still willing to clear up Larry's debts for him if you and he can come to an
  understanding, but the question of the thousand pounds is rather different. A
  thousand pounds is a great deal of money."</p>

  <p>"Louis!" she exclaimed. "You gave me your word, and if you're going to
  back out of it now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He raised his hand.</p>

  <p>"We'll keep this to ourselves if you don't mind, Jackie," he said. "It
  would be awkward for both of us if anyone should overhear. I admit that I
  made you a promise this afternoon, but a promise extracted as you extracted
  that one, Jackie&mdash;at the point of a revolver&mdash;is never considered a
  binding one, and in the circumstances I feel no obligation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I meant every word I said, Louis."</p>

  <p>"I don't doubt it," said Creet. "But you must see that to extract an
  extortionate sum&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Extortionate! You're forgetting that it was you who originally suggested
  it. You thought it worth while then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," he interrupted. "Had you kept to our original bargain, Jackie,
  and played the game as I expected you to play it, I certainly shouldn't have
  grudged the money to help you out of your difficulty. But you haven't. You've
  deliberately set out to avoid fulfilling your side of the bargain, and I
  don't feel inclined to part with a thousand pounds and receive nothing in
  return. It's unreasonable of you to expect it."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Jacqueline. "So you're backing out again, eh, Louis? I
  should have known you'd slime out of it somehow. All right! I can't force you
  to behave like a gentleman, but I told you what I should do if you refused,
  and I mean to do it."</p>

  <p>Louis smiled.</p>

  <p>"All that melodrama stuff?" He shook his head. "Not you, Jackie! This is
  real life, not the cinema. Girls don't do that sort of thing in these days,
  and when you've thought it over you'll see things in a more reasonable light.
  After all, you haven't only yourself to consider. There's your father. If you
  were foolish enough to do as you threaten it would&mdash;affect your father
  considerably."</p>

  <p>"Is this another threat?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged.</p>

  <p>"I don't wish to threaten, Jackie, but you really must be sensible. One
  doesn't like talking about these things, but in the circumstances it's only
  right that you should know that your father is considerably indebted to
  me&mdash;financially."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know you've been very generous. Mother told me. But it seems a
  terrible waste of money."</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Spending five hundred a year," explained Jacqueline, "to keep you
  alive."</p>

  <p>Creet frowned.</p>

  <p>"It's very easy to make that sort of remark," he said, "but it does no
  good. I wasn't referring to the payment I make to your father as my medical
  attendant. I have at various times advanced him other sums when he needed
  them. It amounts in all to something over three thousand pounds&mdash;for
  which I hold his promise to pay."</p>

  <p>"Three thousand pounds?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Setting up in Harley Street costs money, and without my help your father
  could never have done it. And without my help he could not stay there another
  day."</p>

  <p>He saw her start and smiled.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose you understand these matters, Jackie," he went on, "but
  in cases like this the borrower promises to repay the loan not later than a
  fixed date. If he doesn't, the lender can force him to. He can even go as far
  as distraining&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She cut him short.</p>

  <p>"Father hasn't paid?"</p>

  <p>"Your father hasn't been able to pay," he said. "The money is very much
  overdue, but out of friendship for him I've naturally let the debt run on.
  What I want you to realize, Jackie, is that I could, if I chose, demand
  payment at any moment."</p>

  <p>"I see. And it depends on me?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally, if you're prepared to be reasonable, I shouldn't
  dream&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for God's sake, Louis, talk straight!" exclaimed Jacqueline. "You
  mean that if I insist on having my thousand pounds or the statement I asked
  you for, you'll come down on my father for three thousand, and if he can't
  pay&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There's no 'if'; he can't pay."</p>

  <p>"And you'd sell him up? Louis, you couldn't&mdash;even you couldn't do
  such a foul thing."</p>

  <p>"I'm quite sure, now I've explained the position, there'll be no need for
  anything of the sort," said Creet. "And you needn't worry over that thousand,
  Jackie. If you fix things up with Larry, I promise you that Monty Carr shan't
  worry you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Until it suits you to let him!"</p>

  <p>Creet did not intend to argue. He smiled and went to the door.</p>

  <p>"It really is time you realized, Jackie," he said, "that you can't bully
  Louis Creet. Good-night!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For some time after Louis had left her, Jacqueline remained
  rooted where she stood. Her body seemed stricken with a sudden helplessness,
  as though some vital link between it and her brain had snapped, isolating it
  from its directing force, so that she could do nothing but stand there
  motionless, staring at the door through which Louis had gone. Her mind seemed
  deadened, incapable of thought. She was conscious only that some tremendous
  catastrophe had occurred and that she was so hopelessly involved in it that
  it was useless to struggle even if she could.</p>

  <p>And as her mind began to work again and she realized what had happened,
  her first thought was that it could not be true. Modern and sophisticated as
  she thought herself to be, she was yet unsophisticated enough to believe that
  human nature could not possibly be capable of such deliberate evil. It seemed
  incredible that any man could be guilty of such baseness. Like everyone else,
  she judged others by her own standards and could not conceive of any others.
  Such callous indifference to the standards with which she was familiar left
  her dumbfounded, bewildered, incredulous, utterly unable to cope with it.</p>

  <p>The striking of the clock roused her, and she went slowly across the room,
  switched off the light, and made her way along the corridor to her bedroom.
  She had a queer sensation that nothing was real; the bed was not a real bed,
  the dressing table not a real dressing table. She herself was not real. As
  she undressed and got into bed she had the sensation of taking part in
  something which was not really happening at all.</p>

  <p>In bed she lay wide-eyed, staring into the darkness, trying to force
  herself to take stock of the situation calmly. It was useless telling herself
  that it simply could not be true. It was true. The position was the same now
  as it had been yesterday&mdash;with the difference that today she had played
  her last card and it had failed to take the trick. And she had been so
  certain that she had managed to free herself. In banking on Louis's cowardice
  and fear of scandal she had felt that she was banking on a certainty. So she
  had been: Louis had been anxious enough to get rid of her and would have let
  her down without compunction to save his own face. What she had not reckoned
  with was Louis's devilish ingenuity. She had seen no possible counter move
  for him to make, yet he had found one, and it was checkmate. Louis had her
  cunningly hemmed in on every side, and if he chose not to release her there
  was nothing she could do to release herself. She wondered why a man like
  Creet was allowed to live and prosper, while a man like Larry, who could not
  do a crooked thing, must just miss everything that was worth having. Why on
  earth had she been such a coward? She could have ended it all that afternoon.
  Just a slight pressure against the trigger of her revolver and Louis would
  have played no more swindling tricks. In a fraction of a second she father,
  Larry, Mark, Tubby. It was appalling what havoc one man like Louis could
  work, how his rottenness spread out and touched so many others. There could
  surely be nothing wrong in crushing out of existence a pestilential insect
  such as Louis. Larry had called her a coward for not having done it. Perhaps
  she was. Larry would have done it. But would he? She could not somehow
  believe that he would.</p>

  <p>The thought of Larry brought an almost intolerable pain. He had been
  wonderful to her that afternoon. She had hurt him appallingly, and he had
  uttered scarcely a word of reproach. She felt that she could have borne it
  more easily if he had been furiously angry, raged at her, lashed her with his
  scorn and contempt. His anger would have caused her less pain than that
  understanding smile of his, that gentle touch of his hands, that kiss. She
  had wounded him beyond all hope of healing, and it seemed to her that all the
  pain she had inflicted, intensified a hundredfold, had recoiled upon herself.
  Until that afternoon, when his lips had so suddenly been pressed against
  hers, she had not realized with what passionate intensity she loved Larry.
  But she knew now, and the knowledge hurt her unbearably.</p>

  <p>She fell at last into a restless sleep and dreamed that she was running in
  a paper chase with Louis Creet and Monty Carr. They were ahead of her,
  running side by side; and as she sped along after them she could hear Louis
  panting for breath, and every now and then she saw him, still running, put a
  thermometer into his mouth and then make a note of his temperature in his
  pocket book. She could see the page of the book quite clearly and was
  surprised that his temperature should be 189. That seemed a great deal, she
  thought, even though he was running about in the African sun.</p>

  <p>Monty Carr, as he ran, kept pulling rectangular slips of paper from his
  pockets and dropping them. One of these she picked up. It was a check for a
  thousand pounds, bearing her signature, and in the top left-hand corner, in
  red ink, were the letters "RD." She ran faster than ever. She must somehow
  catch Monty Carr, because she had something of tremendous importance to say
  to him. She couldn't remember at the moment what it was that she wanted to
  tell him, except that it was something about the ace of hearts.</p>

  <p>She saw a huge, round hole in the ground a little way ahead, and as Louis
  and Monty Carr reached the edge of it they both took a flying leap and
  disappeared from view. She did not hesitate; she jumped down the hole after
  them. It was a very deep hole, and she travelled downwards at a terrific
  speed. Halfway down she flashed past Louis and Monty Carr, who were bobbing
  helplessly about, rather like a couple of toy balloons in a draughty room,
  moving neither up nor down. They both seemed very angry, and as she went
  rushing past she heard Creet shout that they couldn't get any further down
  because they weren't heavy enough. But she could not stop.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the hole she found herself in a gold mine. The roof and
  walls and ground were all glistening with lumps of gold embedded in them. She
  knew it was gold because she examined several pieces very carefully and it
  was stamped "22 carat." She found a spade and began digging feverishly. She
  knew that she must get enough gold for her father and Larry and Mark and
  Tubby and herself before Louis got any heavier and came floating down to stop
  her.</p>

  <p>But it was slow work. The spade was not a very good one. Its haft was
  loose in the socket, and every time she wielded it, it made a creaking
  noise....</p>

  <p>She awoke with a start and sat bolt upright in her bed. She had heard
  something&mdash;a sort of creak&mdash;several times&mdash;from over there by
  the door....</p>

  <p>Her fingers found the light switch at the head of the bed and pressed it
  down, and her glance, sweeping swiftly round the room, paused as it reached
  the door. The door was moving&mdash;opening&mdash;a fraction of an inch at a
  time; and each time that it moved came a slight squeak from the hinges.</p>

  <p>She sprang out of bed, flung her dressing gown round her shoulders, and
  gripped the handle of the door, trying to close it. She felt it give slightly
  and then suddenly resist her pressure.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, darling," whispered Louis's voice. "It's
  I&mdash;Louis&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her grip tightened on the handle and she placed her shoulder against the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Louis&mdash;what do you want?"</p>

  <p>For answer she felt the pressure against her shoulder grow stronger and
  braced herself to resist it.</p>

  <p>"Louis&mdash;please&mdash;go away! You can't come in here&mdash;you shan't
  Oh, for God's sake, Louis&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her voice was frantic, and she was struggling desperately, her body
  pressed against the door, to resist the pressure, to overcome it, to force
  the door back. But the task was beyond her strength. Her foot was slipping,
  her hands, fiercely gripping the knob, were growing numb, and slowly, inch by
  inch, the door was opening.</p>

  <p>At the further end of the corridor Larry, a cigarette between his lips,
  was pacing the floor of his bedroom. He, too, was making an effort to take
  stock of the situation calmly. But calmness and clear thought were difficult.
  Each time that he tried to rivet his attention there came before his eyes the
  picture of Jacqueline, a pathetic, crumpled figure in the chair, covering her
  face with her hands, telling him her story, and instantly he was swept by a
  hurricane of tempestuous anger which threw his thoughts into a turmoil, all
  the more maddening because it was so futile. Jackie had got herself into the
  deuce of a mess, and, short of putting a bullet through Creet, there seemed
  no way of getting her out of it.</p>

  <p>He tried to review his own position. He must face the fact that, barring
  miracles, Louis would not budge over the question of the mine, and that he
  was in much the same position as he had been before he had left England. He
  would have a couple of thousand pounds, his share of the gold they had
  brought back with them. He had not lodged it with the Office of Mines, as
  Louis had demanded that he should, and he had no intention of doing so. Louis
  could do what he liked about it, but he and Mark and Tubby were going to have
  their two thousand apiece. It was little enough in all conscience, and, if it
  came to the point, rather than take legal action, Louis would give way about
  that.</p>

  <p>But two thousand pounds would not be of much use. It would pay off some of
  his debts in England, but that was all. He was still as poor as ever he had
  been. Just as well, perhaps. Money wasn't everything, and, as was always
  suggested by philosophers harassed by no financial cares, it was probably
  better for a man to spend his life doing a job of work than idling away his
  time in affluence.&mdash;" Ruined by Riches," as Tubby would put it. A wry
  smile twisted one corner of his mouth. Well, he was fairly safe from the risk
  of ruin, anyway.</p>

  <p>He was more concerned for Mark and Tubby than for himself. After all, he
  could scramble round and look after himself somehow. There was some talk of a
  diamond field down Namaqualand way, and if he could persuade someone to back
  him financially he could have a cut at that. It didn't matter enormously
  where he was or what he did.</p>

  <p>But Mark and Tubby were different. They had been banking on the Chumbaziri
  goldfield, and Creet's attitude had knocked the bottom clean out of
  everything for them. Mark, the sly old devil, had a girl tucked away
  somewhere whom he had been hoping to marry, and Tubby, with Bunty and the
  kids to think of, had staked everything on the expedition. No wonder Tubby
  was taking it pretty hard. He would hate to be in old Tubby's shoes, going
  back to England and having to tell Bunty.</p>

  <p>He'd have to keep an eye on Tubby. In his present state he was just as
  likely as not to put a bullet through Creet if he saw no chance of getting a
  square deal. But Tubby wasn't cut out for that sort of thing. If he did a
  thing like that he'd fret over it for the rest of his life and feel compelled
  to get it off his chest by telling Bunty. And he'd never enjoy having the
  money. "Tainted by Blood," or something like that, he'd call it.</p>

  <p>Larry smiled again. The marvel was that he hadn't himself killed Louis
  that afternoon after hearing all Jackie had told him. After all, he owed
  Creet a bullet more than either of the others. Apart from the mine, he owed
  him a bullet for Jackie. It hadn't, of course, come entirely as a surprise,
  all that Jackie had told him that afternoon. For some time he had had a vague
  feeling of uneasiness, which he had not been able either to explain or
  dismiss, that all was not well with her; and when he had met her at Lobito
  Bay he had suddenly been sure of it.</p>

  <p>But even he, though he had never been under any illusions about Louis
  Creet, had not thought him capable of quite such unspeakable vileness.
  Creet&mdash;and Jackie! What a damnable little fool she had been! What a
  damnable, darling little fool! She had been so afraid of what he would say to
  her, yet so anxious not to shirk it, to admit that she had been to blame, not
  to whine for his pity or make excuses for herself. The best thing that had
  ever happened to Dr. Thurston was having Jackie for a daughter. And now,
  thank God, she had managed to rid herself of Creet</p>

  <p>"Larry!"</p>

  <p>It came to him distinctly, a sharp, shrill cry of panic, and brought him
  to a sudden halt in his pacing. Just for an instant he hesitated, doubting
  his ears in the return of the unbroken silence; and then he strode to the
  door, opened it noiselessly, and looked out.</p>

  <p>The corridor was in darkness except for a thin beam of light which came
  from the partly opened door of Jacqueline's room at the farther end. For a
  moment he stood there, peering through the darkness, frowning. He heard the
  faint squeak of hinges, a gasp of dismay, caught a glimpse of a dark mass
  against Jacqueline's door, a bare ankle, the swinging tassel of a dressing
  gown, and suddenly stepped across the corridor and switched on the light.</p>

  <p>He saw Louis, in dressing gown and pyjamas, with his shoulder against
  Jacqueline's door, straining to force it open; heard Jacqueline's
  "Louis&mdash;you shan't&mdash;I'd rather die&mdash;" and went striding
  swiftly along the corridor.</p>

  <p>Creet's back was towards him, and, before he could turn, Larry had sprung
  at him, his hands closed around his throat, jerked him savagely from the
  door, forced him, staggering, backwards, and held him, choking, gasping for
  breath, his hands beating the air, while Larry, with the hint of a scornful
  smile on his lips, watched him with that mad-dog look in his eyes. All the
  pent-up hatred in his heart went rushing to Larry's fingers, their grip grew
  tighter and tighter, and, as he saw Creet's face take on a purple hue, his
  eyes bulging from their sockets, the veins in his forehead swelling, and
  heard the gasping gurgle in Creet's throat, Larry's hands gripped still more
  fiercely, and the smile on his lips grew more pronounced.</p>

  <p>"Larry&mdash;for God's sake&mdash;you're killing him!"</p>

  <p>He became aware of Jacqueline beside him, pulling frantically at his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Larry&mdash;please&mdash;let him go!" she begged.</p>

  <p>For a moment Larry hesitated, and then suddenly his fingers relaxed, he
  withdrew his hands, and Creet, limp and barely conscious, collapsed on the
  floor and lay motionless.</p>

  <p>"Larry, you've killed him!"</p>

  <p>Larry turned to her and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You were just in time, Jackie," he said. "He wouldn't have stood much
  more of it. You'd better get back to your room."</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston, struggling into his dressing gown, came hurrying along the
  corridor, and a second later Tubby, resplendent in his incredible pyjamas,
  with Mark close behind him, came lumbering out of his room,</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble, Larry?" began Dr. Thurston; and then, as he caught
  sight of the figure of Creet: "What does this mean?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Larry!" exclaimed Tubby. "He's not&mdash;dead?"</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking the hopeful note in his voice, and Larry could not
  suppress a smile as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"All right, you fellows," he said. "I've just been giving our friend Creet
  a lesson in manners, that's all. There's no cause for alarm&mdash;or
  optimism," he added with a grin at Tubby. "Push off back to your room, Tubby.
  If he catches sight of those pyjamas it'll put him right out."</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston was down on his knees, watching Creet anxiously. Creet's
  hands were clutching his throat, and his breath was coming in quick, rasping
  gasps, but the purple hue had died away from his face, and his bloodshot
  eyes, shifting restlessly from one to the other, showed that he was again
  aware of his surroundings. And then, as his glance rested on Larry, he
  struggled unsteadily to his feet and stood swaying, his face distorted with
  passion, pointing a shaking finger.</p>

  <p>"By God, Larry Deans! I'll fix you for this."</p>

  <p>He turned and, with one hand against the wall for support, staggered along
  the corridor, went into his room and shut the door.</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston's face was a study in embarrassed perplexity.</p>

  <p>"What happened, Larry?"</p>

  <p>"Go to bed, Tubby. Take him off, Mark, will you?" said Larry, and, as Mark
  and Tubby went back to their rooms, he turned to the doctor. "I owe you an
  explanation, Doctor," he said, "and the sooner you have it the better."</p>

  <p>He glanced at Jacqueline, saw the imploring look in her eyes, and shook
  his head.</p>

  <p>"There are certain things you ought to be told, Doctor," he said, "and if
  you'll come along to my room I'll tell you."</p>

  <p>"But, Larry," protested Jacqueline, "at this hour of night&mdash;there's
  no need&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sorry Jackie, but there's every need. I'm going to tell the doctor
  everything. It's only fair that he should know."</p>

  <p>"Everything?" repeated the doctor. "It all sounds very mysterious, Larry.
  I don't in the least understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You should have been told long ago," said Larry, took Dr. Thurston by the
  elbow, and urged him towards his room.</p>

  <p>"Larry!"</p>

  <p>He glanced back.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Jackie?"</p>

  <p>"Must you?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"All right," she said. "I expect you're right, Larry. But if Father is to
  be told I'd rather&mdash;tell him&mdash;myself."</p>

  <p>"What is all this mystery " began Dr. Thurston, but Larry directed him
  into Jacqueline's room and signed to her to follow.</p>

  <p>"Go on, Jackie," he ordered. "You know it's got to be done, don't
  you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded and turned to enter her room. Larry caught her arm.</p>

  <p>"No shirking, Jackie," he said. "Everything. Promise?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, went into the room, and closed the door. She seated herself on
  the edge of the bed, her hands clasped on her knees, her eyes staring
  vacantly at the wall.</p>

  <p>"Well, Jackie," said her father, "what's it all about, eh? If there's any
  sort of trouble you know you can count on me to see you through."</p>

  <p>Suddenly her hands flew to her face and she flung herself on the bed, her
  face in the pillow, and her body shook with her sobs.</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston seated himself on the edge of the bed, and his hand stroked
  her hair.</p>

  <p>"Pretty bad, eh, Jackie?" he said gently. "Come along&mdash;man to
  man&mdash;what is it?"</p>

  <p>"Father&mdash;I can't tell you."</p>

  <p>"Funking?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>His hand found hers and held it.</p>

  <p>"That's not like you&mdash;funking," he said. "Out with it like a good
  'un, Jackie. I'm on your side, anyway."</p>

  <p>She gave his hand a grateful squeeze. And then gradually, phrase after
  hesitating phrase, still clinging to his hand, she told him all that she had
  told Larry that afternoon. And when she had finished. Dr. Thurston laid a
  hand on her head, and his lips touched her cheek.</p>

  <p>"Well played, Jackie," he said. "Now go to sleep."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Back in his room, Louis Creet felt no inclination to sleep.
  For one thing, his throat was badly bruised where that brute Larry had dug
  his fingers in. He had treated it with a soothing lotion from among the
  numerous remedies without which he never travelled, but it was still
  uncommonly painful and gave him a sharp twinge each time he moved his head.
  And the wound to his pride had made his feelings no less sore than his
  throat.</p>

  <p>On one point, at any rate, he was determined: there should be no more
  shilly-shallying over the mine. He had hesitated so far to take any definite
  step, because with a fellow like Larry Deans you never knew. Before
  definitely breaking with Larry, prudence had warned him to be quite certain
  that in so doing he was running no risk. Circumstances might arise, he had
  felt, which would make it expedient to give the fellow some sort of an
  interest in the mine, though not the quarter share he was impudent enough to
  claim.</p>

  <p>But this evening's affair had settled it once and for all. Larry would get
  nothing now; and since obviously he must treat them all alike, Mark and Tubby
  would get nothing too. He would have the thing settled immediately; he would
  see to all the necessary formalities, and, once he was secure, Larry and the
  others could do what they liked about it.</p>

  <p>It would, of course, antagonize Larry more than ever, but that really was
  of less consequence than he had thought. When Jacqueline had given him her
  disturbing news that afternoon his thoughts had naturally flown to Larry as
  the obvious solution of the problem. The few thousand pounds required to
  clear up Larry's debts had not seemed an excessive price to pay to extricate
  himself from an awkward predicament and prevent Jacqueline making a fuss, as
  she had seemed determined to do.</p>

  <p>But on second thoughts he realized that such generosity was quite
  unnecessary. If Larry and Jacqueline fixed things up, well and good; he would
  be out of his predicament without spending a penny. If they did not fix
  things up&mdash;well, there were less expensive ways of getting rid of
  Jacqueline than the one he had contemplated. Jacqueline could prove nothing,
  and in any case he was not tied to England. He supposed what she had told him
  was true. For one reason, at any rate, he hoped it was. It would hurt Larry
  Deans far more than Larry's fingers had hurt his throat.</p>

  <p>This evening's affair, of course, was awkward. He had not expected that
  Jacqueline would welcome his visit, but he had been sure that, rather than
  risk rousing her father and being asked for explanations, she would at any
  rate submit to it.</p>

  <p>But something had happened to Jacqueline&mdash;seeing Larry again, he
  supposed, was the cause of it&mdash;and that frantic call to Larry had been
  an unpleasant surprise. And now there was no knowing what consequences might
  follow. Would she tell her father? Creet smiled. The interview with her
  father might, in that event, be an unpleasant one, but what, in view of that
  £3,000, could Dr. Thurston do? She might, perhaps, tell Larry, and that
  possibility was more disturbing. Larry was a savage brute, and there was no
  knowing what he might do. Tonight's episode was a fair example of the sort of
  thing of which he was capable....</p>

  <p>Towards daybreak he fell asleep, and it was not until nine o'clock that he
  awoke with a start, to find Larry sitting on the edge of his bed, regarding
  him with a quizzical expression. He sat up suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Well? What do you want?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Larry smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm just wondering what makes the difference," he said, still studying
  him closely. "It's your collar, probably. It's puzzling. You see, Louis,
  you're no end of an ugly old devil when you're in bed, yet when you're
  dressed you really don't look so bad&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get out!" snarled Creet. "Get out of my room, do you hear? After what
  happened last night I wonder you've the impudence to show your
  face&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Larry cut him short.</p>

  <p>"Speaking of last night," he said, "that's what I've come about&mdash;to
  tell you I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>"Huh!" grunted Creet. "You behaved like a hooligan. Deans, and I don't
  intend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What I mean," interrupted Larry, still surveying him critically, "is that
  you're a particularly poisonous sort of blackguard, Louis, but I admit that I
  was perhaps rather rougher with you than was strictly necessary. If you're
  prepared to overlook the hooliganism, I'm prepared to forget what caused
  it."</p>

  <p>Louis regarded him suspiciously, knitting his eyebrows with a frown.</p>

  <p>"What are you after, Deans?" he demanded. "You're not prepared to do
  anything of the kind. Not that I care what you're prepared to do," he added
  defiantly. "You're going to be damned sorry about last night. Deans, before
  I've done with you."</p>

  <p>Larry smiled back at him.</p>

  <p>"Since this is a friendly call, Louis," he said, "don't you think you
  might call me Larry?"</p>

  <p>Louis scowled.</p>

  <p>"I don't feel inclined for foolery," he snapped. "Say what you've got to
  say and clear out."</p>

  <p>Larry's smile vanished. When he spoke he had dropped his bantering
  tone.</p>

  <p>"It's about the other two fellows&mdash;Tubby and Mark," he said. "After
  all, they've done nothing to upset you, and you've no cause to have any
  grudge against either of them, so why carry on the war in a friendly
  country?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"I mean just this, Louis. Treat Mark and Tubby decently, give them the
  share in the mine which you know they're entitled to, and I'm prepared to
  drop my claim and clear out. You can't say that's not a fair proposal,
  because you'll still have a half share in the mine, which is just double what
  you're entitled to have. Still, if you'll do that I shan't grudge you my bit.
  After all, I don't mind this sort of life&mdash;a few more years of it and I
  might even come to like it&mdash;but the other two are different. They don't
  fit into the picture. They belong to some place where you can get a taxi.
  Besides, one of them's married and the other wants to be. What about giving
  them a little preferential treatment?"</p>

  <p>Louis's thin lips formed a malicious little smile.</p>

  <p>"Very noble, Larry," he sneered. "Which of you thought of it? You? A
  half-share split between three of you is better than nothing, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I'm out of it&mdash;I've told you so," said Larry. "Will you do it?"</p>

  <p>"Never in your life!" exclaimed Creet. "You'll get nothing out of me.
  Deans&mdash;nothing. Get that into your head. I've done with you. I'm not
  going to argue about it," he added, as he saw Larry was about to speak. "I've
  done with all of you. You're all as thick as thieves, and if one of you got a
  few thousand he'd be fool enough to share it with the others, and that isn't
  going to happen&mdash;see? I'd rather get nothing myself than let you get a
  penny piece. Deans, you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Larry rose with a shrug.</p>

  <p>"Start the day well," he said, "and make up your mind to keep the tongue
  pure. But, seriously, Louis, think it over, anyway. I'm responsible for those
  fellows being in your bad books, and it's rough on them, you know. After all,
  there's quite enough to go round."</p>

  <p>"Then it can go round me," retorted Louis. "And now get out. Deans. I've
  finished with you&mdash;for the moment," he added significantly.</p>

  <p>Larry stood regarding him curiously.</p>

  <p>"You're a rum bird, Louis," he said thoughtfully. "You must be pretty well
  a unique specimen."</p>

  <p>Louis grunted.</p>

  <p>"I've always understood," explained Larry, "that the foulest blackguard
  living has a spot of good in him somewhere, but you seem to be an exception.
  Psychologists would be interested in you, Louis."</p>

  <p>He found Mark just finishing breakfast. Tubby, Mark told him, had gulped
  down a cup of coffee while he strode about the room, and had gone off
  somewhere looking as if he meant mischief. It wouldn't surprise him to hear
  at any moment that the whole population of Benguella had been murdered in
  cold blood.</p>

  <p>"Seen Jackie?" enquired Larry.</p>

  <p>Mark shook his head. None of the Thurstons had yet put in an appearance,
  he said. Larry, with a nod, seated himself at the table, and Mark, after
  several vain efforts to draw him into conversation, abandoned the attempt and
  went out.</p>

  <p>Larry was oppressed with a desolating sense of failure. Everything had
  gone awry, and this morning it did not seem worth while to try to put things
  right. For the first time in his life he felt disinclined for further effort,
  ready to throw up the sponge and let events take their own course.</p>

  <p>It was all an inextricable muddle, and he had not the energy to set about
  disentangling it. Besides, there was nothing to be done. As regards the mine,
  he had done all that could be done, and the next move was with Louis Creet.
  He knew what the move would be; Creet would make his claim to the mine, and
  the matter, as far as the rest of them were concerned, would be finished
  with. A lawsuit, even if they had the necessary money, must inevitably go
  against them and leave Creet in undisputed possession of the property. Oh,
  well, let him keep it. It was rough on Mark and Tubby, but it was useless
  going on like this. He would tell them bluntly that he had finished with the
  whole business and they must do as they thought best&mdash;make a fresh start
  somewhere, as he intended to do.</p>

  <p>And then Jacqueline. There was nothing to be done about her. She had told
  her father now, and any action that was to be taken must rest with Dr.
  Thurston. He must try to dismiss Jackie from his thoughts. She would be going
  back to England in a few days' time, and the chances were that he would never
  see her again. He must not count on it, anyway.</p>

  <p>Marriage was as definitely out of the question now as it had been before
  he had left England, and would probably remain out of the question
  permanently&mdash;thanks to Louis Creet. He must have a word with Jackie and
  make that quite clear to her. She was still fond of him, of course, but she
  must be made to realize that it was hopeless to expect that there could ever
  be anything between them beyond an occasional exchange of letters from
  opposite ends of the world. It was bad luck on both of them, but there was
  nothing to be done about it. He'd get over it in time, he supposed. So would
  Jackie. She would marry someone else, no doubt, a bit later on. It gave him a
  savage sort of satisfaction to know that it would not be Louis Creet.</p>

  <p>As he thought of Louis his face darkened, and for several minutes he sat
  motionless. And then suddenly he brought his fist crashing onto the table and
  rose to his feet. Creet&mdash;the swine&mdash;wasn't going to get away with
  this lot. If Creet imagined that he intended to stand by and see himself
  robbed of the mine, of Jackie, of everything he possessed or cared about,
  Creet would have a rude shock.</p>

  <p>What in heaven's name was the matter with him this morning that he could
  have thought of doing so? He smiled. Lack of sleep, he supposed; he hadn't
  put his head on the pillow last night. There was nothing like lack of sleep
  for taking the kick out of you. But the kick was back now. He wasn't going to
  take this lying down. There must be something to be done about it, some card
  to be played which would trump Creet's trick. If he could only discover what
  card it was...</p>

  <p>He found Mark, with a decanter of whisky on a table beside him, sprawling
  in a deck chair on the veranda. Larry pointed to the whisky and frowned.</p>

  <p>"Too early for that," he said.</p>

  <p>Mark gave a shrug, picked up the decanter, and began pouring whisky into a
  glass.</p>

  <p>"All things considered, Larry," he said, "say when!"</p>

  <p>Larry nodded.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," he allowed, swallowed the drink, flung himself
  into the chair beside Mark and lighted a cigarette.</p>

  <p>For some time they sat staring at the blue waters of the bay sparkling in
  the sunshine, Mark with an unlighted pipe in his hand, Larry smoking so
  furiously that the end of his cigarette formed a constantly glowing cone. At
  length Mark struck a match and lighted his pipe.</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do, Larry?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"God knows," said Larry. "He won't budge. I've had a cut at him this
  morning, but he won't even miss me and give you two fellows a straight deal.
  He's afraid you'd split it with me."</p>

  <p>Mark smiled.</p>

  <p>"Then he's less of a fool than you are, Larry. Thanks all the same. As far
  as I can see," he added with a wry smile, "the only thing for us to do is to
  find another gold mine."</p>

  <p>"I don't feel like taking this lying down, Mark."</p>

  <p>"Nor I. Nor does Tubby. But what can we do?"</p>

  <p>Larry shrugged, and again they lapsed into silence. And again, ten minutes
  later, it was Mark who, staring stonily at the horizon, broke it.</p>

  <p>"Larry, we must&mdash;do&mdash;something."</p>

  <p>"Something&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>"The only question is&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>Larry took another cigarette from his case, lighted it, shot a quick look
  at Mark under cover of a cloud of smoke. And Mark, glancing at Larry, without
  moving his head, out of the corner of his eye, met his look, and sent it
  swiftly back to the sparkling waters of the bay. Then suddenly Larry turned
  to him.</p>

  <p>"You know as well as I do that there's only one thing to be done, Mark,"
  he said; "and you know as well as I do that we've got to do it. Why beat
  about the bush? I might as well stick my head in a gas oven. That would be a
  fitting end to the sort of life I've been having lately. But I'd like to do
  one useful thing before I go, and I can think of nothing more useful than
  blowing out Louis Creet's brains. You can safely leave it to me. It would be
  as well to say nothing to Tubby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused abruptly as Tubby came onto the veranda. His face was drawn and
  pale beneath its tan, his eyes were dull and lifeless, and he moved as if
  every movement were a wearisome effort. He held a sheet of paper in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Listen to this, you fellows," he said listlessly. "It's a
  cable&mdash;just been delivered&mdash;from Bunty. Alan's got to go away to
  Switzerland&mdash;for a year. 'Nothing serious'"&mdash;he read the
  typewritten words&mdash;"'but imperative dry atmosphere. Doctor guarantees
  recovery. Have fixed Pontresina. Shall I take house there?'"</p>

  <p>Larry glanced at Mark.</p>

  <p>"That's all right, Tubby," he said quietly. "Wire 'Yes.'"</p>

  <p>"How the devil can I wire 'Yes'?" exploded Tubby furiously. "Bunty thinks
  I'm rolling in money, but I haven't got a bean in the world. I haven't had
  the pluck to tell her that yet. Creet's taken everything. Even the house
  she's living in. Look here, you fellows, if you're knuckling under to him and
  letting him wipe his feet on you, I'm not. I'm going to have the whole thing
  out with him once and for all, and if he won't give us what we're entitled
  to, then I'll take it. I'll put a bullet in the swine and settle things that
  way."</p>

  <p>Mark pushed the decanter in Tubby's direction.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and have a drink, Tubby," he said. "Having things out will get
  you no further, and the other job has already been annexed."</p>

  <p>Tubby glanced from one to the other with puzzled eyes.</p>

  <p>"By me," said Larry. "You chaps are keeping out of this. You may think
  you've an excellent reason for putting Creet out, and so you have. But I've a
  better one. Never mind what it is: you must take my word that if it's a
  question of who has the best reason for sending Creet to hell, mine whacks
  yours hollow."</p>

  <p>"You're&mdash;you're serious?" asked Tubby.</p>

  <p>Larry nodded.</p>

  <p>"So am I," said Tubby. "I nearly did it last night. I wish I had. You
  didn't think I was that sort of chap, did you? I'm not really, you
  know&mdash;hate killing things. But when it comes to smashing Bunty, I can't
  think of anything I'd stick at, and I'd think no more of putting Louis out
  than I would of shooting a goat. And I shouldn't care a cuss what happened to
  me afterwards. I don't think I'd ever regret it."</p>

  <p>Larry laughed shortly.</p>

  <p>"It certainly wouldn't fill me with everlasting remorse, Tubby. We've had
  to do it before, you know, and it doesn't keep us awake at night. Those
  fellows who got sleeping sickness and went mad&mdash;we didn't hesitate to
  shoot them. If we hadn't put them out they'd have put us out. It's just the
  same with Louis. Either he goes out or we go out&mdash;and several other
  people with us."</p>

  <p>Tubby suddenly sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"By God, you're right, Larry!" he exclaimed. "If ever a man deserved to go
  out, Louis Creet does. When a man goes batty and starts shooting up people,
  what do you do? There's only one answer&mdash;you put him out as quickly as
  you know how. That's what Louis Creet's doing&mdash;shooting my home to
  pieces." He pulled the cablegram from his pocket and waved it at them. "You
  heard me read this, didn't you? You know what it means? Well, I'm not
  standing for it. I'm having no more shilly-shallying. My only chance is to
  put Louis out, and I'm going to do it. If anything happens to
  me&mdash;afterwards&mdash;I know you fellows will see Bunty right&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His voice broke, and he turned from them suddenly and began pacing the
  veranda.</p>

  <p>"Steady, Tubby!" said Larry. "Come and sit down and have another drink.
  There's no need to tell all Portuguese West Africa about it."</p>

  <p>Tubby obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Louis should feel flattered," continued Larry, with a smile; "there's a
  regular scramble for the honour of killing him. But we can't all kill him.
  Louis Creet against the wall and a firing party of three would attract too
  much attention. I still think I've a better claim to the honour than either
  of you two, but as you don't seem to agree with me there's only one way out
  of it. We'll draw for it."</p>

  <p>Tubby took a coin from his pocket and laid it on the table, covered by his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"That suits me," he said. "Odd man out. The sooner we settle it the
  better."</p>

  <p>Larry shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not that way, Tubby," he said. "It wouldn't do at all. If I won and did
  the job, you'd never be able to forget that I'd murdered a man, and our
  friendship would be ruined. And if you won, the same thing would happen:
  every time I looked at you you'd fancy I was remembering what you'd done.
  'Accused by His Eyes,' or something like that. We'll draw for it with
  cards."</p>

  <p>"Any way suits me," muttered Tubby, "as long as we get on with it."</p>

  <p>"We'll nominate a card&mdash;say the ace of spades," said Larry, "and deal
  out the pack, and whoever draws the ace of spades will use his own discretion
  and do the job as he thinks best. That's a better way, Tubby; it'll spare all
  our feelings. The one who draws the ace of spades will say nothing about it.
  He won't show by word or look or movement that he has drawn it either when he
  draws it or at any time afterwards. Poker-face is the password, Tubby. And if
  it should come to a showdown, the two who didn't draw it will say nothing.
  They won't remember this conversation, but they'll stand by the other with
  all their resources and do their best to see him through."</p>

  <p>"And his people," added Tubby.</p>

  <p>"Of course," agreed Larry. "Any complaints?"</p>

  <p>"Suits me," said Mark.</p>

  <p>"And me," said Tubby. "But I hope to God&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Larry. "So does Mark. So do I&mdash;rather more than either
  of you. Here comes Thurston: I daresay he can produce a pack of cards."</p>

  <p>As Dr. Thurston came through the open door of the lounge, a spruce, alert
  figure with an unmistakable Harley Street air, Larry's eyes scanned his face.
  But it was as serene and expressionless as ever, and if Jackie had told him
  last night all she had promised to tell him, he showed no signs of it.</p>

  <p>"At last," said Dr. Thurston, rubbing his hands together, "I've a job of
  work to do. You're all so disgustingly healthy that I was afraid of getting
  out of practice. Louis has been putting off the evil day for months, but he
  seems quite a bit scared this morning&mdash;got a pain in his neck or
  something"&mdash;his eyes twinkled at Larry&mdash;"and he's actually going to
  let me overhaul him."</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong with him, Doctor&mdash;really?" asked Mark.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't imagine so," replied the doctor. "He eats too much and takes
  too little exercise, of course, but so do I." He glanced curiously from one
  to the other. "You fellows look as if you're debating momentous
  questions."</p>

  <p>"We are," laughed Larry. "The fact is, Doctor, that Tubby, as usual,
  insists that it's not his turn to buy cigarettes; Mark says it isn't his
  turn, and I'm equally sure it isn't mine, because I bought the last three
  lots. We were just arranging to draw for it. Can you find us a pack of
  cards?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston smiled.</p>

  <p>"I've a couple of packs in my trunk," he said. "I scrounged them quite
  shamelessly on the boat coming out. I'll fetch one for you."</p>

  <p>In a few moments&mdash;moments of silence and averted eyes with the three
  men sitting at the table&mdash;the doctor was back and tossed a pack of cards
  onto the table.</p>

  <p>"There you are," he said, "a green pack. It's supposed to be an unlucky
  colour, but as it's only for cigarettes I don't suppose it's of much
  importance. How are you working it?"</p>

  <p>"The one who draws the ace of spades buys the cigarettes," laughed
  Larry.</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'll deal them for you, shall I?"</p>

  <p>Larry glanced at the others and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Face downwards," he said.</p>

  <p>The doctor, starting with Larry, began to deal, while the three men,
  motionless, sat watching, the gaze of each of them never shifting from the
  steadily growing pile of cards that lay in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Seventeen each and one over," said the doctor, holding up the last card.
  "What do I do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Larry's hand shot out and took the card.</p>

  <p>"That's mine," he said, and tossed it on top of the others.</p>

  <p>There came a step behind him, and Dr. Thurston turned, to see Louis at the
  door of the lounge.</p>

  <p>"Come along, Thurston; I'm waiting for you," he said irritably, and with a
  smile and a nod to the three at the table the doctor followed Louis into the
  house.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had gone Tubby swept up the cards in front of him and began
  running them through his fingers, scanning them eagerly. Mark, picking up his
  hand, went through it carefully, calmly, purposefully. Larry, with a smile on
  his lips, spread his cards into a fan, gave them a quick glance, and tossed
  them back onto the table, and a moment later Mark's and Tubby's fell on top
  of them. And then the eyes of each of them sought in turn the eyes of the
  other two.</p>

  <p>"Mind you&mdash;" began Tubby.</p>

  <p>Larry raised a hand.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Tubby," he ordered. "That's that. One of us has drawn the ace of
  spades, and it's up to him. We'll have no discussion and no mutual
  confidences. He knows what he has to do, and he'll do it, and no one but
  himself will ever know who's to blame. Or to be praised," he added; "it
  depends how you look at it. All agreed?"</p>

  <p>The other two nodded, and Larry, with a swift movement of his hand, mixed
  the cards, gathered them up, and dropped them into his pocket.</p>

  <p>Then he turned to Tubby and clapped a hand on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Wire 'Yes,' Tubby," he said, with a smile, and strode into the house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Thurston, alone that evening in the drawing room, came
  to the conclusion that everyone had been behaving in a very peculiar
  way&mdash;exactly as if everyone thought everyone else had some horrible
  infectious disease and was afraid of catching it.</p>

  <p>It had started with Jacqueline, who, on the plea of a headache, had shut
  herself in her room and refused to come in to dinner; and from her the
  trouble seemed to have spread to all the others. They had scarcely been five
  minutes in the drawing room when Tubby had suddenly got up, mumbled something
  about needing a breath of air, and disappeared into the garden in a
  shamefaced way, very much like a dog who had stolen a bone and was slinking
  off to bury it; five minutes later Mark had announced that he was going in
  search of cigarettes and had not since put in an appearance; and almost
  immediately Larry, with what Mrs. Thurston, in the privacy of her own
  thoughts, always described as his you-can-all-go-to-hell air, had gone
  striding onto the veranda without making any excuse at all.</p>

  <p>Next, her husband. After sitting for half an hour without speaking a word,
  fidgeting with the ring on his finger&mdash;which always meant that he was
  worrying&mdash;he had made a terribly bad job of pretending that he had
  something to say to Larry, and went straight off into the garden, when she
  was almost sure that Larry was still on the veranda. And finally Louis had
  refused quite brusquely to play the piano to her, declaring that he must go
  to the dining room and write letters. It was all very extraordinary and
  perplexing.</p>

  <p>When things became too perplexing to be coped with, Mrs. Thurston had
  evolved by long experience an almost perfect method of dealing with them: she
  would just go to her bedroom, shut the door, settle herself comfortably on
  the bed with an interesting book, and resolutely decline to make any effort
  to cope with them at all. So now, since everybody was behaving in so
  perplexing a way, she got up from her chair and went along the corridor
  towards her room. At the door of Jacqueline's room she paused and knocked
  lightly but received no reply. Jackie had gone to bed, she supposed, and went
  on to her own room.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, comfortably settled in bed, she switched on the
  reading lamp above her head, selected a book from the pile on the table by
  the bedside, and prepared to enjoy what she called "a nice read." The book
  was entitled <i>Her Crowning Folly</i>, and dealt with the joys and
  tribulations of a woman who, married to a wealthy man who apparently had done
  nothing to deserve such harsh treatment at the hands of fate, had not
  sufficient intelligence to be faithful to her husband. Mrs. Thurston felt
  that this was "life" and had read the story several times already. Chapter
  Ten was her favourite. Such a happy chapter, and she did like to fall asleep
  feeling happy. She would read Chapter Ten tonight.</p>

  <p>But tonight Chapter Ten could not hold her attention, and though her eyes
  followed the familiar lines, the words conveyed no meaning to her. She hoped
  Jacqueline wasn't sickening for something. She didn't think so; nor did John.
  The child seemed to have something on her mind, which was always tiresome;
  she would much prefer her to have a cold or a rash or a definite pain
  somewhere than something on her mind. Last night, too&mdash;all that
  commotion in the corridor&mdash;with only a dressing gown round her
  shoulders, and Louis and all the others there. Jacqueline had been walking in
  her sleep, John had said, and bumped herself against a door; and walking in
  your sleep always meant that you had something on your mind. John really
  should have let her get out of bed and go to the girl, but he had got quite
  angry when she had suggested it.</p>

  <p>Larry, of course, had something to do with it. Since she had met Larry
  again Jacqueline seemed to have quite turned against Louis. Such a pity,
  because really in these days a girl had to be practical and do the best she
  could for herself, and it was absurd to be so offhand and distant to Louis
  just because Larry said that Louis wasn't being quite fair over the gold
  mine. Louis, after all, wasn't the man to do anything really dishonourable,
  and it would be impossible to find a more generous man anywhere.</p>

  <p>As for the squabble over the gold mine, she was quite sure that if they
  would all sit down and stop biting one another's heads off and talk it all
  over quietly, the whole thing could easily be settled. She really must have a
  word with Jacqueline and see if she could persuade her to be a little more
  reasonable about Louis. Louis had said only yesterday that he wished
  Jacqueline would be a little more reasonable, and she quite agreed with him.
  But Mrs. Thurston's interpretation of the word, had she but known it,
  differed considerably from that of Louis Creet.</p>

  <p>She laid the book aside, switched off the light, settled her head
  comfortably on the pillow, and closed her eyes. She hoped John wouldn't wake
  her when he came to bed and want to start talking. And she hoped he wouldn't
  sit up too late gossiping with Louis and drinking more whisky than was good
  for him. Now she came to think of it, Louis had been drinking a great deal of
  whisky this evening&mdash;three or four glasses with his dinner and goodness
  only knew how many afterwards&mdash;one after another&mdash;almost as if he
  simply must empty the decanter...</p>

  <p>She awoke suddenly, with a violent start, and with the sensation that some
  terrific force had blasted her back to consciousness. For a second she lay
  rigid, every nerve in her body quivering, her heart thudding, her hands
  tightly clenched. She felt as if a current of enormous voltage had flashed
  through her.</p>

  <p>She flung back the bedclothes and sat upright, every sense acutely alert,
  her eyes wide open. Yes, that was it: she had heard something&mdash;some
  shattering sound that had come crashing into her ears and seemed still to be
  reverberating in her head. She thought of thunder, but a glance at the window
  showed a clear, moonlit sky. She switched on the light and realized that she
  was alone. John was not there, and she was alone&mdash;and frightened.
  Something had happened&mdash;something terrible&mdash;and John wasn't
  there</p>

  <p>She jumped out of bed, scrambled into her dressing gown, opened the door,
  and ran along the corridor. She had no idea why she was doing it, but she
  knew that at all costs she must run along the corridor. Some deep-seated
  instinct urged her on, and she was compelled to obey. But she did not want to
  obey. She was afraid, terrified of what awaited her ahead, yet had no choice
  but to run towards it.</p>

  <p>The door of the dining room was ajar, and a beam of light stabbed the
  darkness of the corridor. Mrs. Thurston did not hesitate. The hand that she
  placed against the door was trembling, but she pushed it open resolutely and
  went in.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the room, rigid, as if rooted to the floor, her hands
  pressed against her face, stood Jacqueline, barefooted, pyjama-clad, a
  dressing gown flung round her shoulders.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston took a quick step towards her and paused.</p>

  <p>"Jackie!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>She saw the girl's slim body shiver.</p>

  <p>"Jackie! What is it?"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline's hands left her face, and her mother caught her breath sharply
  as she saw the girl's ashen cheeks, her wide, staring eyes, her mouth working
  nervously. She seemed to be trying to speak, but her lips refused obedience,
  and no words came. And then she took a quick step towards her mother,
  covering her face with her hands again.</p>

  <p>"Oh, God&mdash;Mother&mdash;it's horrible!"</p>

  <p>And as Jacqueline moved Mrs. Thurston saw the thing at the writing
  desk&mdash;the limp, crumpled figure in the chair, sprawling forward across
  the desk&mdash;dangling arms with nerveless hands&mdash;the head twisted
  awkwardly on one side&mdash;the small red hole with blackened edges in the
  centre of the forehead. The inkwell lay on its side, and the ink was dripping
  onto the carpet. It flashed into her mind that somebody had told her that
  milk would take inkstains from a carpet. She noticed the decanter on the
  desk. Louis had been drinking a great deal of whisky</p>

  <p>"Mother&mdash;Louis&mdash;he's dead!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston's hand found Jacqueline's arm and clung to it. She could not
  move. She wanted to turn away, to shut out the sight of that huddled figure
  in the chair, to rush from the room. But some force seemed to have planted
  her on that spot and then deprived her of all power of leaving it, and all
  she could do was to stand there, helpless, trembling, staring at the limp,
  sagging thing that had been Louis Creet.</p>

  <p>She was conscious of her husband coming into the room in that brisk,
  businesslike way of his, brushing past her as he strode towards the writing
  desk, and bending over the figure in the chair. And then Larry was
  there&mdash;Mark&mdash;Tubby&mdash;standing round the desk. They all looked
  terribly scared. Except Larry, of course. Grave, but not scared. She could
  not imagine Larry looking scared....</p>

  <p>The doctor's examination was a brief one. He straightened himself and
  glanced at Larry.</p>

  <p>"Quite dead," he said in a low tone. "Instantaneous. Shot through the
  brain at close quarters."</p>

  <p>Larry nodded.</p>

  <p>"Good God, Doctor " began Tubby in an awed voice; and then he paused
  abruptly and shot a queer, uneasy look at Larry and Mark as they stood
  staring down at the body.</p>

  <p>The doctor turned and strode across to where Mrs. Thurston and Jacqueline
  still stood together.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said, laying a hand on Mrs. Thurston's arm, "this is no
  place for you."</p>

  <p>She wrenched her gaze from the group around the writing desk, and as it
  rested on her husband's face the hint of a smile showed round her lips. John
  was here now; she need be frightened no more now that John was here; she felt
  safe, calmer.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing you can do, my dear," added the doctor. "Louis is beyond
  our help." He turned to Jacqueline. "Come on, Jackie&mdash;get a grip of
  yourself," he said, "and take your mother back to her room. She's to have a
  tablespoonful of brandy and get back to bed. You'd better stay with her until
  I come. Have a cigarette and don't worry."</p>

  <p>He was bustling them towards the door as he spoke, smiling at them
  reassuringly. Death was no strange and terrifying thing to him, and he had
  learned that a smile and a calm, confident manner were the finest preventives
  of hysteria at times like this. That and keeping people so busy that they had
  not time to consider how they were feeling.</p>

  <p>At the door Jacqueline paused.</p>

  <p>" Daddy&mdash;how&mdash;who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"God knows, Jackie," interrupted the doctor. "Time enough for all that
  later. The police will be along, and no doubt they'll want to question all of
  us, but you needn't let that distress you. Give your mother a good stiff
  brandy, but don't let her think it's more than a tablespoonful or she'll
  refuse to drink it. You'd better have a nip yourself from the look of you.
  There's some in a flask in my cabin trunk. And now run along and make
  yourself useful."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline nodded and went off along the corridor, and the doctor, closing
  the door, went back into the room. He stood for a moment gazing gravely at
  the body.</p>

  <p>"Dreadful!" he muttered. "Poor old Louis!"</p>

  <p>And then he suddenly became the alert, practical doctor again.</p>

  <p>"Mark, put through a call to police headquarters, will you?" he said.
  "Call me when you've got them, and I'll speak to them. Close those French
  windows, Larry, and pull the curtains. I'm going to lock this room until the
  police arrive. They won't be long, I imagine, and we'd better wait up for
  them. Tubby, can you make coffee? Then find the kitchen and make some and
  bring it to the drawing room. It's no use asking the servants; they're scared
  out of their lives and fit for nothing. Before you go, though, give me a
  cigarette."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, each with a cup of what Tubby honestly believed to be
  coffee, they were all seated in the drawing room.</p>

  <p>"The police are coming along at once," said the doctor. "They can have a
  look round in the other room, and then, if they want to talk, they can come
  in here."</p>

  <p>"What I don't understand " began Tubby.</p>

  <p>"Nobody understands anything yet, Tubby," said the doctor, "so we won't
  worry ourselves making guesses. All we know is that Louis is dead and that a
  bullet in his brain killed him. Who fired the bullet is a question for the
  police."</p>

  <p>"Any theory. Doctor?" asked Larry.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't," he answered shortly; "and with the whole population of
  Benguella to pick from I don't propose to waste time guessing."</p>

  <p>"These bungalows might have been specially built to suit the convenience
  of would-be murderers," said Larry. "Every room has French windows leading
  onto the veranda, and if they were open it would be the simplest thing in the
  world for anyone to walk along the veranda, do the job, and get away almost
  before the report had been heard. As the doctor says, anyone might have done
  it."</p>

  <p>"Quite," agreed Mark. "A fellow like Creet, with all sorts of interests in
  various parts of the world, is bound to have enemies. He's been out here
  before, you know, and it looks to me as if somebody has been paying off an
  old grudge."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely what I was thinking," said Tubby. "I mean, the police may have
  an idea about who did it, mayn't they&mdash;official eye on dangerous
  characters and that sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody heard anything, I suppose?" said the doctor. "Before the shot, I
  mean. No footsteps on the veranda or anything of that sort? Where was
  everybody?"</p>

  <p>For a moment no one answered him. Mark, as usual, was staring at the
  ceiling; Larry seemed engrossed in studying the glowing end of his cigarette;
  Tubby was examining his fingernails.</p>

  <p>"It's none of my business, of course," added the doctor, "but the police
  will want to know about all of us. It's all very unpleasant, but we may as
  well face the fact that when they start casting about for a likely murderer
  their first thought will be that the crime was committed by someone in the
  house. After all, Louis, as far as we know, knew nobody out here, and the
  person with some motive for killing him will naturally be looked for first
  among those who knew him. From all I've heard of police methods in this part
  of the world, we may all find ourselves under lock and key before the
  morning, and it would be as well for each of us to have a clear-cut account
  of ourselves to give them."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Doctor!" exclaimed Tubby. "You don't really think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He caught Larry's eye and paused.</p>

  <p>"The doctor's quite right," said Larry. "It's just as well to have it all
  cut and dried. As far as I'm concerned, I was in my bedroom. I'd been sitting
  in a chair, smoking, and was just dropping off to sleep, I fancy, when I
  heard the shot. It didn't strike me at first that there was anything wrong. I
  thought it was someone having a shot at a wild dog again; they were at it
  last night, you know. It was only when I heard people moving about that I
  really woke up and realized that the shot must have been in the house and not
  outside. I went straight along the veranda to the dining room and met Mark
  and Tubby on the way. That's my account, and if it's of any use to the police
  they're welcome to it. What about you, Tubby? If you tell your story in your
  usual florid style I imagine they'll hang you to save time.</p>

  <p>Tubby managed a rather sickly smile.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I was in the garden," he said. "I've been sleeping
  pretty badly the last couple of nights&mdash;worrying and that sort of
  thing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What about?" snapped Larry.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, about the mine and one thing and another. Good Lord, old boy,
  we've all been worrying, haven't we? After the way old Louis was treating
  us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just what I expected!" Larry interrupted. "Now listen to me, young Tubby.
  If you don't want all kinds of trouble with the police, you'll just answer
  'Yes' or 'No' to whatever questions you're asked and leave it at that. When
  you go beyond 'Yes' or 'No' you're not safe."</p>

  <p>"Safe?" repeated the doctor, frowning. "Tubby has nothing to be afraid
  of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If Tubby is his usual charmingly loquacious and indiscreet self, Doctor,
  he has the deuce of a lot to be afraid of&mdash;always supposing, of course,
  he's afraid of getting arrested and charged with murdering Louis. Perhaps he
  isn't, but I am, and I don't suppose Mark fancies it, either."</p>

  <p>"If it's all the same to Tubby," Mark told the ceiling, "I'd appreciate
  being excused from the hanging."</p>

  <p>Tubby shook his head dejectedly.</p>

  <p>"Hanged if I see what you're driving at, Larry," he said.</p>

  <p>"This," said Larry. "I asked you where you were when the shot was fired.
  You told me you were in the garden. But you didn't stop there. You went
  blundering on to tell me that you'd been sleeping badly, that you were
  worried, that Mark and I were worried, and that we had every reason to be
  worried because Louis had served us a dirty trick over the mine. In other
  words, in one sentence, if I'd been a policeman, you'd have given me the best
  possible reason for supposing that you or Mark or I had shot Louis because
  he'd swindled us."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Larry, I didn't mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course you didn't mean that," snapped Larry, "but the fact remains
  that if the police had been looking for someone with a motive for doing Louis
  in&mdash;as they will be&mdash;you'd have unconsciously supplied them with
  the names of three people, each of whom, in the view of the police, had an
  excellent motive. If you don't want all sorts of complications over this
  rotten business, keep your mouth shut as much as you can and don't volunteer
  any information you're not asked for. If you start letting yourself go you'll
  hang the lot of us."</p>

  <p>"There's something in that, Tubby," said the doctor. "No need to volunteer
  information which, after all, would only put the police on a false scent.
  Larry's probably exaggerating, of course, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not exaggerating in the least," said Larry. "We may just as well face
  up to the fact that all three of us had a first-class motive for wishing
  Louis out of the way, and once the police get their teeth in a motive it
  takes a lot to make them drop it. It's common knowledge here now about the
  Chumbaziri goldfield; everyone in the place seems to know that we three and
  Creet are interested in it, and we can count on the police having that
  information. What nobody knows is that we and Creet were at loggerheads over
  the mine, and there's no earthly reason why they should know it. In my
  opinion it's up to each of us to see that that particular bit of information
  doesn't get to their ears. Is that agreed?"</p>

  <p>The doctor nodded.</p>

  <p>"You can rely on me," he said. "No use in creating trouble; we've enough
  already. From this moment I don't even know that you had anything but the
  friendliest feelings for Louis."</p>

  <p>"But, hang it all!" protested Tubby. "I'll have to tell them the truth,
  you know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course, Tubby," soothed the doctor. "But I agree entirely with Larry
  that there's no need to do more than answer their questions truthfully
  without volunteering information. As a matter of fact, if you suggest to the
  police that you three had a good motive for committing the crime, you won't,
  in one way, be telling the truth at all. The fact may be true, but the
  inference which you would inevitably lead the police to draw&mdash;that one
  of you three shot Louis&mdash;would be false. Truth, Tubby, isn't nearly such
  a simple thing as we're inclined to imagine."</p>

  <p>Tubby sighed and ran his fingers through his hair.</p>

  <p>"Just say what you're asked, please, Tubby," said Larry, "and no
  gratuitous frillings."</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right," said Tubby. "I'll do my best. I was in the garden,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>"Ask me where I was, Larry, will you?" said Mark.</p>

  <p>"Well, where were you?"</p>

  <p>"Bed," grinned Mark. "The perfect answer, Larry&mdash;lucid, brief, and
  unequivocal&mdash;and all in a three-lettered monosyllable. How judges would
  love and counsel hate me!"</p>

  <p>The doctor smiled.</p>

  <p>"I was in the drawing room," he said. "At the risk of a reproof from
  Larry, I will add that I was reading. No harm in that, eh, Larry?"</p>

  <p>"Depends on the book," said Larry.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later the police arrived. The inspector, a dapper little
  Portuguese, spoke English fluently. He had a matter-of-fact manner which
  seemed to suggest that murder was quite one of the commonplaces of life and
  nothing at all to get disturbed about, and somehow gave the impression that
  if he sent you to the gallows you could rely on him to do it with the utmost
  politeness. With him were three uniformed policemen.</p>

  <p>In a few words the doctor introduced himself and explained what had
  happened. The inspector was charmed to meet him. He had a cousin who was a
  doctor in Lisbon. He would have been a doctor himself, but the examinations
  proved too much for him. If it would not be troubling the doctor too much
  would he conduct him to the room where the gentleman was shot I</p>

  <p>His examination of the dining room was brief to the point of casualness.
  Sherlock Holmes would have shuddered at it.</p>

  <p>"Murder, of course," he pronounced, and gave a stream of orders to his
  subordinates in Portuguese, and turned again to the doctor.</p>

  <p>There were certain formalities to be observed, he said apologetically, but
  they would inconvenience the doctor as little as possible. He had given
  instructions for photographs to be taken, and the body would then be removed.
  And now he regretted that he must ask certain questions. Perhaps&mdash;in the
  other room?</p>

  <p>They returned to the drawing room.</p>

  <p>"There are we four in the house," explained the doctor, "and my wife and
  daughter. It was my daughter who was first on the scene. There's no reason
  why you shouldn't question her at once, but if you can possibly spare my
  wife&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;later&mdash;tomorrow, if necessary," said the inspector.
  "Perhaps, however, I might ask the young lady a few questions? I will not
  distress her more than I can help."</p>

  <p>The doctor nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'll fetch her."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline was very pale when, a few moments later, she entered the room,
  followed by her father, and at the inspector's invitation seated herself on a
  chair.</p>

  <p>"And now just a few little questions," said the inspector, seating himself
  opposite to her. "Your father tells me that you were the first on the scene
  after the shot had been fired. You heard the shot?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"And what did you do?"</p>

  <p>"I was in my bedroom&mdash;reading," said Jacqueline.</p>

  <p>"I jumped up and ran out into the corridor. There was a light in the
  dining room, and I rushed in there. I saw Louis&mdash;Mr. Creet&mdash;he was
  all sort of crumpled up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The inspector nodded.</p>

  <p>"And you met nobody?"</p>

  <p>"In the corridor? No&mdash;nobody. I suppose I was quicker than everyone
  else."</p>

  <p>"And in the room&mdash;not anybody but the murdered man?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Not&mdash;not exactly," she said.</p>

  <p>The inspector smiled.</p>

  <p>"And what, my dear young lady, does 'not exactly' mean?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you see&mdash;it was all so quick&mdash;but just as I entered
  the room I saw someone&mdash;a man&mdash;disappear through the French windows
  onto the veranda. It was only a sort of flash, you know."</p>

  <p>"A man?" exclaimed the doctor. "You told me nothing about this,
  Jackie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The inspector held up a hand.</p>

  <p>"If you please. Doctor," he said politely. He turned again to Jacqueline.
  "And this man you saw disappearing onto the veranda&mdash;what was he
  like?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He was gone so quickly," she said&mdash;"just a sort of flash&mdash;so
  quick that I wondered if I'd really seen him at all. Perhaps I didn't."</p>

  <p>"We will suppose that you did," said the inspector. "You recall how he was
  dressed?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I don't know&mdash;something light. A tropical suit, I suppose,
  like everybody wears. That's really all I can tell you; it was all so vague
  and over so quickly."</p>

  <p>The inspector nodded and was thoughtful for a few moments.</p>

  <p>"And now, my dear young lady, tell me this," he went on. "Mr.&mdash;Creet,
  is it?&mdash;You knew Mr. Creet very well?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes."</p>

  <p>"In fact, you were a great friend of his?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I suppose I was that."</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps you have some idea as to who may have done this terrible
  thing?"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline hesitated. It flashed into her mind that she must be very
  careful what she said to this polite little man with the shrewd eyes. She
  suddenly saw quite clearly that a rash word from her might work untold havoc.
  Who might have done this terrible thing? Well, except for her mother, there
  was not one of them who had not an excellent reason for killing
  Louis&mdash;Larry, Tubby, Mark, her father, and she herself a better reason
  than any. She must on no account say anything.</p>

  <p>"You are thinking very hard, my dear young lady," came the inspector's
  voice. "I asked you to tell me if you had any idea who might have done this
  terrible thing."</p>

  <p>She raised her head and looked straight into the shrewd eyes that were
  watching her.</p>

  <p>"I've no idea at all."</p>

  <p>"You know of no one who had any reason to dislike him&mdash;no
  enemy&mdash;no one who, perhaps, was jealous of him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no one at all."</p>

  <p>"He has never mentioned to you anyone who had a quarrel with him?"</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>The inspector rose.</p>

  <p>"That is all I have to ask you," he said. "But I should like to say that
  you are a very&mdash;clever young lady."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline glanced at him quickly.</p>

  <p>"Clever?"</p>

  <p>"Some people are not clever," said the inspector. "They tell me lies and
  all the time, when they think they are deceiving me, I know that they are
  telling me lies. You were clever enough to know that you must tell me the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I see," laughed Jacqueline nervously.</p>

  <p>The inspector turned to the doctor.</p>

  <p>"And now," he said, "just a few questions to you four gentlemen."</p>

  <p>The doctor nodded.</p>

  <p>"Off you go to bed, Jackie," he said. "I'll look in and see you
  later."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline hurried back to her mother, found that she had dropped off to
  sleep, and with a sigh of relief went to her own bedroom. She did not get
  into bed; sleep was out of the question. She flung herself into a chair and
  lighted a cigarette and sat staring out through the window at the moonlit
  garden.</p>

  <p>And there, almost an hour later, her father found her.</p>

  <p>"Not in bed yet, Jackie?"</p>

  <p>"What's the use of trying to sleep, Father? Has the inspector gone?"</p>

  <p>"We've just given him a whisky and got rid of him. We've told him all we
  know, and there's nothing more to be done at the moment. Sleep's the only
  thing now, Jackie. If you don't think you can manage it, I'd better mix you
  something, shall I?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, half smiling.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about me, Daddy; I shall be all right. Mother's asleep."</p>

  <p>The doctor smiled.</p>

  <p>"Your mother's a very wonderful woman, Jackie. Good-night, my dear."</p>

  <p>He kissed her and went out, and Jacqueline continued to stare into the
  garden. A sleeping draught? That, at any rate, would have brought
  forgetfulness; but there were things which at the moment she did not wish to
  forget. There were horrible, hideous things, too&mdash;but there were
  others.</p>

  <p>Louis was dead. That, she supposed, was horrible. Everybody seemed to
  think that death was horrible, but she had never quite understood why death
  should be thought any more horrible than birth. Death was very much the same
  as falling to sleep, and being born like waking up, and there was nothing
  horrible about falling to sleep or waking. Of the two, falling to sleep, she
  thought, was much the more pleasant. People didn't think death pleasant,
  though; they thought it horrible. Her thoughts went to the limp figure with
  the dangling arms sprawling on the desk, and she could not repress a shudder.
  Yes, that had been horrible&mdash;horrible and terrifying. She would welcome
  any draught that would blot the memory of that scene from her mind.</p>

  <p>But there were things she wanted to remember tonight, to turn them over
  and over in her mind, savouring them to the full. She was free. Louis had
  been forced to loose his grip of her by a grip that was stronger than his.
  How she had hated Louis&mdash;with a fierce passion of hatred of which she
  had never dreamed herself capable. Often she would gladly have killed him. If
  ever a man had deserved to die, Louis Creet had. And now he was dead. And she
  was glad.</p>

  <p>She supposed she shouldn't be feeling like that about it; she should be
  feeling sorry for him. Louis was a dreadful coward, and he must have had a
  few pretty bad seconds as he saw the muzzle of the revolver pointed at his
  face. She was, perhaps, sorry about that&mdash;sorry that he had had to face
  those moments of agonizing terror before the shot rang out. But that was the
  utmost limit to which she could extend her sorrow. She was not sorry that he
  was dead. How could she be? Apart from herself, there were Larry and Mark and
  Tubby. They wouldn't be sorry that Louis was dead, either. Everything, she
  supposed, would be all right now. The mine would be theirs without any more
  bother.</p>

  <p>She rose from her chair, pressed out her cigarette in the ashtray, and
  began to brush her hair in front of the mirror. Her head was aching
  appallingly, and the brush, she hoped, would soothe it. And as she stood
  there, her glance wandering carelessly over the dainty litter on the glass
  top of the dressing table, she had a vague feeling that something was
  missing. Something which she felt should be there was not there.</p>

  <p>She wrinkled her forehead thoughtfully, running over rapidly in her mind
  the various articles which should be on her dressing table. Everything seemed
  to be there, and, laying down her brush, she took a final glance at herself
  in the mirror, decided that she looked "pretty awful," and turned to go
  towards the bed.</p>

  <p>Halfway across the room she paused abruptly, catching her breath, shot a
  quick, nervous glance at the dressing table, stepped quickly back to it, once
  more ran her eye swiftly over the articles that lay on the glass top, opened
  the drawers&mdash;though she knew that it was useless to do so&mdash;and
  slammed them shut&mdash;impatiently; glanced hurriedly round the room. And
  then, panic-stricken, she stood staring at her reflection in the mirror with
  horrified eyes.</p>

  <p>She knew now what was missing from her dressing table&mdash;her revolver.
  She had laid it there after that scene with Louis. She was certain of
  it&mdash;positive&mdash;just there beside her powder box. And it was
  gone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Jacqueline seated herself on the edge of the bed, helpless
  before the rush of terrifying thoughts that came pouring into her mind. Louis
  killed by a revolver bullet&mdash;and her revolver was missing!</p>

  <p>She had not the slightest doubt that it was with her revolver that the
  fatal shot had been fired. She knew in some instinctive way that that was
  true. No sooner had she realized what was missing from her dressing table
  than that appalling truth had flashed into her mind, and so overwhelming was
  the realization that it did not occur to her to doubt it or to search for any
  other explanation of the weapon's disappearance. Someone, she knew, had taken
  her revolver and with it had killed Louis Creet. But who?</p>

  <p>Larry? The thought suddenly stabbed her mind and made her wince with pain.
  No, not Larry. She could not, would not believe it. Not Larry. Anyone rather
  than Larry. The thought was hideous&mdash;absurd&mdash;grotesque. She must be
  crazy for such an idea to come to her. If only she weren't half out of her
  mind she would see how absurd it was; if only she could think clearly she
  would see that it could not possibly be Larry, that it was against all
  evidence, all likelihood, all reason to suppose that Larry had anything
  whatever to do with it. Why should Larry do a thing like that?</p>

  <p>And almost instantly she knew why. The mine. Louis had been trying to
  cheat Larry out of the mine. Larry had told her that, had admitted that there
  was nothing to be done, that Louis, if he chose, need give them nothing, and
  Louis, he had said, would certainly choose. Wasn't that a reason why Larry
  should have done it? Hadn't Larry, if you looked at it with an unprejudiced
  mind, the best possible reason for wishing Louis out of the way? Most people
  would say so. The police would say so. A jury would consider it pretty
  convincing evidence, if not that Larry had killed Louis, at least that he
  might have killed him.</p>

  <p>That, of course, was because they wouldn't know Larry as she knew him.
  Larry could kill a man&mdash;yes, but not from that sort of motive, not for
  no better reason than that there was the risk that he would rob him of some
  money. Larry, to commit a cold-blooded act like this, would need some more
  compelling motive than that.</p>

  <p>Well, he had it, hadn't he? It was no use blinking the fact that he had,
  and that she herself had supplied him with it. She remembered the cold fury
  in his eyes when she had told him about herself and Louis Creet. Had Louis
  been there, Larry would have killed him then. "There's only one way to deal
  with a swine like Creet...." That was what he had said, and he had meant it.
  You could always tell when Larry meant a thing. Last night, too, in the
  corridor. If she had not been there Larry would certainly have killed him
  then. She wondered if any of them had mentioned that scene of last night to
  the inspector. It would be just like Tubby to blurt it out.</p>

  <p>No enemies? Well, she had lied about that, as she would lie a thousand
  times again for Larry. Even if she had known beyond all question that he had
  fired the shot, she would still have lied. And he had not fired it. It wasn't
  a thing she could argue about. In the face of all evidence, all probability,
  all logic, she knew that Larry had had no hand in it.</p>

  <p>And then, having a tendency towards logic herself, she asked herself the
  inevitable question: if not Larry, who? And because she also had the courage
  to face facts, she forced herself to face this one: that if what she had told
  Larry would be enough to make him shoot Louis, then that information would
  equally impel her father to do the same. And her father knew everything. She
  had kept nothing back last night, and though he had said but little she had
  felt his hand shaking and had seen the look in his eyes. Yet it could not be
  her father. Her knowledge of that fact was as sure as her knowledge that it
  was not Larry.</p>

  <p>She got into bed, determined to think no more about it, and closed her
  eyes. And instantly came another question: what was she to do? Should she
  tell the police about the missing revolver, or should she keep the discovery
  to herself? If she made it known, and a search were made for it, who knew
  where it might be found? Whoever had taken the weapon had, she was convinced,
  killed Louis Creet ... and suppose it had been Larry! She was glad she had
  not discovered the loss before she interviewed the police inspector; it might
  have slipped out. Yet, if she did not tell the police and the revolver were
  found....</p>

  <p>On and on, round and round the endless circle&mdash;Larry&mdash;her
  father&mdash;tell the police&mdash;don't tell the police&mdash;Larry If only
  she could stop thinking!</p>

  <p>Breakfast the next morning was, for Jacqueline at any rate, a trying meal.
  She had lain awake until far into the night, considering this new aspect of
  the situation and all that it might imply. Ought she, she wondered, to tell
  the police about the missing revolver? She would have decided to do so but
  for one persistent fear which, try as she did, would creep into her mind and
  send a little shiver down her spine. She tried to ignore it, to laugh at it,
  to dismiss it as absurd and impossible, but always it presented itself again,
  insidious but importunate, refusing to be ignored or dismissed: Larry?</p>

  <p>She looked round the table from one to the other. Larry's face was, as
  usual, a mask. Save for a certain tightening of the lips, a squaring of the
  jaw, there was nothing to indicate any unusual tension on his part. She
  noticed that he contributed little to the perfunctory conversation that went
  on, and that whenever Tubby or Mark spoke he did not raise his eyes to
  theirs. But then everybody this morning was awkward and uncomfortable, and
  nobody seemed inclined to talk much, thank goodness!</p>

  <p>There seemed to be a general understanding that nobody wanted to discuss
  last night's happenings, to turn the conversation as quickly as possible
  whenever it veered in that direction.</p>

  <p>Only her mother was anything approaching her normal self; but then her
  mother was a remarkable woman.</p>

  <p>She was horrified, of course&mdash;it was a terrible thing to have
  happened, especially in one's own house&mdash;and she was mildly curious as
  to who had committed the crime, with a strong tendency to the belief that it
  must have been a "nigger," because you never could tell with black people,
  who were quite different from white people, whatever people said. Her sole
  idea seemed to be to help everyone through a very tiresome time by being as
  cheerful as she could.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what I've been thinking?" she said, pouring out coffee as she
  spoke and addressing no one in particular. "Do you remember hearing about two
  men who escaped from the gaol&mdash;two dreadful murderers? Isn't it possible
  they&mdash;did it?"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline's heart leapt. Here was a possibility she had overlooked. The
  next moment, however, her rising hopes were scattered, as Larry shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said laconically, "they were captured yesterday, seventy miles
  away in the bush."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Thurston with obvious disappointment. "Such a pity! If
  they had been still at large I feel sure it would have been found that they
  did it."</p>

  <p>"Then it was just as well for them that they were caught," laughed Dr.
  Thurston.</p>

  <p>There was a period of constrained silence before Mrs. Thurston spoke
  again.</p>

  <p>"What a dreadful thing to happen! Poor Louis!" she sighed. "And so
  incomprehensible. Why should anyone want to kill him? I mean to
  say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mother," interrupted Jacqueline, "do please talk about something
  else."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear," expostulated Mrs. Thurston, "Louis is dead, and the
  mystery is, who killed him? By talking it over intelligently we may be able
  to help the authorities by evolving some theory. Besides," she added, "what
  else is there to talk about? I little thought, when I woke up suddenly last
  night, that such an awful thing had happened. I thought at first it was a
  thunderstorm. The bang, I mean. By the way, what time was it? I didn't
  notice."</p>

  <p>"Ten minutes to two," replied Mark and Tubby in unison, looking up. Their
  eyes met, and each turned hastily away from the other's.</p>

  <p>Larry cast a warning glance at the two men.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's right," he agreed. "There must have been an electric storm in
  the air last night: we were all awake, it seems."</p>

  <p>"And the doctor hadn't even come to bed!" said Mrs. Thurston. "You were
  sitting up very late, John."</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston raised his eyes from his plate for only an instant.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I was&mdash;reading. Too hot to sleep."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline glanced quickly at her father. So he had been up at the time
  when Louis was killed. She frowned thoughtfully. That figure she had seen
  disappearing onto the veranda&mdash;was it possible? All the doubts of last
  night began racing through her mind again, and she felt suddenly sick with
  fear. She wished now she had not mentioned that figure to the inspector, but
  at that moment it hadn't occurred to her that there was any need to lie. If
  only she knew what to do! If only she could talk to someone about it....</p>

  <p>"Then if it wasn't those dreadful niggers," her mother was saying, "who
  was it?"</p>

  <p>"That, my dear," said the doctor drily, "is precisely what we all want to
  know, but we shall do no good by talking about it. The matter is in the hands
  of the police, and we must leave it at that. By the way, the inspector may
  want to ask you a few questions. He was considerate enough not to disturb you
  last night. I'm seeing him again this morning, and I'll find out then.
  Nothing to be scared about, you know."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've never been scared of a policeman yet, John," she said&mdash;"not
  even an English one&mdash;and I certainly shan't start now."</p>

  <p>"If you're clever, Mrs. Thurston," said Larry, "you'll tell him the
  truth." His eyes met Jacqueline's for an instant. "Jackie was so clever that
  he congratulated her."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline sighed. Clever? She was not so sure.</p>

  <p>As they rose from the table, Jacqueline took a sudden resolution. She
  followed her father from the room, slipped a hand into the crook of his arm
  and squeezed it affectionately. Her father recognized the symptoms.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Jackie?" he asked. "Want to talk?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, guided him into the garden, and paused.</p>

  <p>"There's something that's rather worrying me. Daddy," she said. "Of
  course, there may be nothing in it, but there may be everything. Anyway, I've
  got to tell you. It's rather&mdash;frightening."</p>

  <p>Her father saw the anxiety in her eyes and forced a smile.</p>

  <p>"Out with it, Jackie," he said. "If we could get through last night I
  don't imagine there's anything that can frighten us this morning."</p>

  <p>"It's&mdash;my revolver, Daddy. It's missing. I left it lying on my
  dressing table, and last night, after you'd gone to bed, I discovered that it
  was gone, and that means&mdash;oh, you know what it means as well as I do.
  Somebody took it&mdash;through the French window, I suppose, when I wasn't
  there&mdash;before Louis was shot."</p>

  <p>"And that scares you, eh, Jackie?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it scares me," she exclaimed. "You must see, Daddy, what it
  means&mdash;what the police will think it means, anyway. Louis was shot with
  a revolver, and my revolver is missing, and whoever took it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shot Louis?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, avoiding his eyes. "Pretty obvious, Daddy, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It would be a permissible inference, Jackie," said her father, "if
  somebody really had taken your revolver."</p>

  <p>"Somebody has."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"Sure?" he asked. "I know you, Jackie. You're a careless little devil.
  Only a careless little devil would leave a loaded revolver kicking about
  among her powder and lipstick and all the rest of her adjuncts to beauty. I
  wouldn't mind betting your revolver isn't missing at all."</p>

  <p>"Daddy, I'm absolutely positive&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That you left it on your dressing table," he laughed. "I know. If you
  weren't so absolutely positive, Jackie, I might be worried, but I'm not in
  the least. I'm not going to start getting worried until you've had another
  look round."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"A revolver can't get hidden on a dressing table, Daddy."</p>

  <p>"I'm not suggesting it can," laughed her father. "Since you're so positive
  that's where you put it, Jackie, the dressing table is the last place to
  look." He slipped his arm into hers. "Come along and we'll make a thorough
  search together," he said. "If it's nowhere in your room, the police... But
  it'll be time enough to talk about that when we're sure it isn't under your
  pillow."</p>

  <p>Together they went to her bedroom.</p>

  <p>"A systematic search, please, Jackie," said her father. "I'll take this
  side of the room with your trunk and the chest of drawers, and you&mdash;Oh,
  all right," he laughed, seeing the look on her face. "I suppose you think I
  should crumple your fal-lals, eh? Very well, you take this side and I'll take
  the other. And for goodness' sake, Jackie, search properly. It's a thousand
  to one it's here somewhere."</p>

  <p>The doctor looked under her pillow and began stripping the bed, and
  Jacqueline turned her attention to the chest of drawers. But the revolver was
  not there. Of course it was not there. She had left it on her dressing table,
  and someone had taken it and shot Louis, and they were only wasting their
  time looking for it when they should be deciding what was to be done.</p>

  <p>She went down on her knees, opened her cabin trunk, and began groping with
  her hand among the contents. Her fingers touched something hard and cold,
  closed over it eagerly, and drew it hastily from beneath the dainty garments
  that hid it.</p>

  <p>"Daddy!"</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston, exploring the wardrobe, glanced over his shoulder, saw her
  holding up the revolver, and turned towards her with a smile.</p>

  <p>"In the trunk?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, gazing thoughtfully at the weapon in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's that, Jackie," said the doctor. "The revolver episode is
  closed."</p>

  <p>"Is it?" said Jacqueline thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't it? What's biting you, Jackie?"</p>

  <p>"I'm just wondering," said Jackie, "who put it in my trunk. Somebody. I
  left it on the dressing table&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her father took the revolver from her hand, snapped it open, closed it,
  glanced at the barrel, and tossed it into the open trunk.</p>

  <p>"I know what you're thinking, Jackie," he said, "but you're wrong. The
  revolver hasn't been fired. You can see for yourself. Every chamber is still
  loaded, and there's not a trace of smoke in the barrel."</p>

  <p>She rose from her knees.</p>

  <p>"Righto, Daddy!" she said. "Sorry."</p>

  <p>"You'll lose yourself one of these days," laughed the doctor and went
  out.</p>

  <p>She smiled as she watched him walking briskly down the garden. It was no
  use arguing with him about it. If he believed that she had been mistaken and
  had put the revolver into the trunk herself she would never persuade him that
  she hadn't. But did he really believe it? Did he, in any case, think her such
  a fool as not to realize that the person who had taken her revolver from the
  dressing table and shot Louis Creet with it would clean and reload it before
  putting it into her cabin trunk? And that, of course, was what had
  happened.</p>

  <p>She closed the trunk and went thoughtfully from the room. She found Larry
  sitting alone on the veranda and flung herself into a chair beside him.</p>

  <p>"It's a nice old how-do-you-do, Larry, isn't it? Where's all the happy
  throng?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Thurston's in the drawing room," he told her. "I fancy she's
  thinking out a few frank remarks for the benefit of the inspector if he's a
  nuisance with his questions. Mark and Tubby have gone for a stroll&mdash;in
  opposite directions." He scrutinized her keenly. "Aren't there creams and
  things you can use?"</p>

  <p>"Creams?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen them advertised, Jackie, and I gather that they'd remove the
  furrows from a ploughed field in a few days. I daresay you'd get one
  somewhere in Benguella. You should do something about it, anyway."</p>

  <p>"About what?"</p>

  <p>"That furrow between what's left of your eyebrows," said Larry.
  "Worried?"</p>

  <p>"Who isn't?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not. Nor is your mother. What's gnawing at you, Jackie?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated a moment. Then:</p>

  <p>"Larry," she said, "I'm going to ask you something, and if I make a fool
  of myself we'll change the subject."</p>

  <p>Larry nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's a bet, Jackie."</p>

  <p>"It's about last night."</p>

  <p>"It would be!"</p>

  <p>"What really did happen?"</p>

  <p>"Louis Creet was shot," said Larry. "Memory failing or what?"</p>

  <p>She made a gesture of impatience.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean that."</p>

  <p>"Louis getting shot strikes me as the outstanding feature of the evening.
  Except, of course, the inspector. Charming, wasn't he? I was waiting for him
  to kiss your hand. You took a risk, you know, Jackie."</p>

  <p>"Risk?"</p>

  <p>"Lying the way you did," said Larry. "If you forget his charming manners,
  that bloke had a nasty knowing look in his eye. No enemies? Nobody who might
  possibly be jealous of him? I'd no idea you could lie like that, Jackie, and
  I've half a mind to clip your ear. At the time I wanted to&mdash;kiss you.
  And I was scared stiff that Tubby would shake you by the hand and burst into
  tears of gratitude. If you'd let it out that we three were at daggers drawn
  with Louis over the mine, we'd all probably have been in clink this morning.
  You know what the police are: one whiff of a motive and they warn the
  executioner. You were fine, Jackie. As a token of his gratitude Tubby made a
  subtitle for you&mdash;'She Lied to Save His Life.' Why did you do it?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged a shoulder.</p>

  <p>"There seemed no object in putting silly ideas into the inspector's head,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"That's precisely what we all felt," he told her, "and we&mdash;well, we
  didn't exactly lie, but we suppressed a few facts which the charming
  policeman might have considered relevant. It isn't always decent to be
  absolutely truthful, you know. If Tubby and Mark and I had been absolutely
  truthful last night, the inspector would have found us dancing round the
  dining room singing songs of thanksgiving."</p>

  <p>"Larry&mdash;you're horrible!"</p>

  <p>"There you are!" laughed Larry, "I tell you the truth, and you promptly
  call me horrible. I'm glad Creet's dead. So's Mark. So's Tubby&mdash;only he
  has such a nice mind that he doesn't like to say so. You're glad, too.</p>

  <p>"Am I?"</p>

  <p>"Of course you are. And because you're a rotten little hypocrite you're
  probably snivelling to yourself and saying, 'Poor Louis! How dreadful! I'm
  ever so sorry.</p>

  <p>"It is pretty dreadful, Larry."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Jackie!" he exclaimed. "You're not one of those slops, are
  you, who always want to speak well of the dead whether they're good, bad, or
  indifferent. Don't be a blithering idiot! They don't die. Everything they did
  is still going on&mdash;all the good things, all the fine things-and all the
  foul things. Am I to take my hat off to a swine like Louis Creet just because
  he happens to be dead? A bad man is bad, dead or alive.</p>

  <p>She made no answer to that. It struck her that there was no possible
  answer.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you something," continued Larry. "You remember that bloke in
  <i>The Silver King</i> who goes down on one knee and says: 'O God, put back
  Thy universe and give me yesterday'?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, Jackie, here's a bit more horrible truth for you. If I could put
  back the universe to yesterday, there's not one single thing that happened
  then that I'd want to change. What happened last night I'd want to happen
  again. And if I'd killed the swine I'd still say the same."</p>

  <p>Suddenly she leaned forward and laid a hand on his arm, gazing earnestly
  at his face.</p>

  <p>"Larry&mdash;that's just what I want to ask you," she said. "Did you?"</p>

  <p>She saw the sudden hardening of his mouth and the obstinate forward thrust
  of his jaw.</p>

  <p>"Larry&mdash;please&mdash;don't be angry," she begged. "I had to ask you.
  I must know. I can't go on like this, wondering, not being sure. You could
  have killed him, couldn't you? After what I told you yesterday? You'd have
  gone straight away and killed him then if I'd let you, wouldn't you?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"And then, night before last&mdash;you almost did kill him then, Larry.
  And there's the mine as well. I was thinking this out most of last night, and
  I couldn't help seeing that the way Louis was treating you was another reason
  why you should want to kill him."</p>

  <p>He smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"A pretty convincing case for the prosecution, eh, Jackie?"</p>

  <p>"It's not meant to be a prosecution," she told him. "It's just that the
  idea has come to me that you might have done it, and I can't rest until I
  know. Did you?"</p>

  <p>He reached out a hand and patted hers.</p>

  <p>"Darling, even the police inspector hadn't the nerve to ask me that."</p>

  <p>"I'm not to be trusted, eh, Larry? Afraid I've such a high sense of my
  duty as a citizen that I'd feel bound to inform the police? That's what they
  call a squeaker, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Larry said nothing. Jacqueline sighed</p>

  <p>"Then if you can't tell me that you did kill Louis," she said, "can you
  tell me that you didn't? Larry&mdash;please&mdash;if you knew how I feel
  about it, how I'm blaming myself for having caused the whole ghastly
  business, you'd do something to put me out of my misery. If only you'll say
  you had nothing whatever to do with it&mdash;won't you?"</p>

  <p>Larry placed the thumb of his right hand against his nose and extended the
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"That to all Nosey Parkers!" he laughed. "If you want to know who killed
  Louis, why ask me, anyway? Why not ask the Inspector? He's the bloke who
  ought to know. I'm not so sure that he doesn't."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline lay back in her deck chair and was silent for some time,
  watching Larry narrowly between her half-closed lids as he sat staring at the
  sea. She asked herself if there was any difference in him. She had a furtive
  sort of belief in the popular fallacy that no one could commit a horrible
  crime like murder without it leaving its mark on his face&mdash;a change of
  expression, a different look in his eyes. She remembered how, in the mirror
  of Louis's elaborate dressing table, she had sought for just such an
  alteration in herself before venturing to face her mother's scrutiny and had
  failed to detect the least difference. But perhaps it didn't work that way
  round. On that occasion it was not she but Louis who had been the
  murderer.</p>

  <p>Larry, in any case, bore no visible stigma of guilt. His face told her
  nothing&mdash;except that he had not the least intention of telling her
  anything. After all, the whole thing was probably a mare's nest. She was as
  bad as the police&mdash;according to Larry; she had got a whiff of a motive
  and had promptly warned the executioner. It didn't follow that, because he
  had good reason for doing so, Larry had killed Louis. Yet, if Larry had not
  killed him, why should he hedge and dodge the issue and refuse to tell her
  so?</p>

  <p>"Who is it now?" asked Larry. "If you're looking for a good surprise
  ending, Jackie, you might do worse than make the inspector the murderer."</p>

  <p>"I'm wondering, Larry," she said. "You don't think that Mark&mdash;or
  Tubby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've no reason to suppose it was either one or the other," interrupted
  Larry. "You've a nasty, suspicious mind, Jackie. Why not bring your father in
  with the rest of us and make a good job of it?"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline sighed.</p>

  <p>"I've thought of that," she said. "I'm not ragging, Larry; it's nearly
  driving me crazy, I told Daddy everything night before last, and it struck me
  that he might&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Larry was shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"The doctor wouldn't have shot him," he grinned; "he'd just have operated.
  But, seriously, Jackie, you've no need to worry your head about it at all.
  I'm not worrying. Leave it to the police, and for heaven's sake don't plague
  the life out of everybody by asking questions. Especially not Tubby. I'm off
  now&mdash;business over the mine."</p>

  <p>He took a few steps and hesitated.</p>

  <p>"By the way, Jackie&mdash;that Monty Carr fellow. You've no need to worry
  over that now, of course. For the first time in my life, as soon as things
  are fixed up, I'm going to write a four-figure check."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Jacqueline watched him go with a smile on her lips. That was
  like Larry. She remembered telling Louis that Larry was one of those men whom
  a girl could ask for £1,000 and not be afraid that he would expect anything
  in return, and Louis had not believed her. He would not, she supposed, have
  believed it of any man. She wished he could have been there and seen the look
  on Larry's face when he had said that to her&mdash;a shy, rather sheepish
  look, as if he had no right to say anything of the sort and was afraid she
  would be annoyed about it. The way he had hurried off, too, because he was
  afraid she might try to thank him and make him feel uncomfortable. It was
  queer the way a decent man always seemed half ashamed of doing a decent
  action.</p>

  <p>She would thank Larry later, since that was the only return that she could
  make to him. Larry had been quite right; a bad man was bad, dead or alive,
  and all the foul things he had done went on, breeding more foul things, and
  so on and on, she supposed, forever. Louis had done a foul thing, and Louis
  was dead: but the foul thing he had done had not died with him. It still
  clung to her, would always cling to her; and Larry, when he looked at her,
  would always see it and remember and look away from her again.</p>

  <p>Yet he had offered her that check for Monty Carr. She was not sure that
  she would need it now. The whole affair, she had realized almost as soon as
  realization was too late, had been a carefully laid scheme between Monty Carr
  and Louis in order to put on her a thumbscrew which Louis might turn to suit
  his purpose, and it was possible that Monty Carr, now that Louis was dead,
  might press her no more for the £1,000 which he had never really expected to
  receive. No doubt Louis had paid him handsomely for his assistance. But it
  was a relief to know that, no matter what might happen, she need worry no
  more about Monty Carr.</p>

  <p>It was a relief, too, in another way. If Larry was able to write his first
  four-figure check, that could only mean that he was sure now of his share in
  the mine; and that, in turn, must surely mean that he had had no hand in
  killing Louis Creet. Unless he were innocent of that, not even Larry would
  have the confidence to assume that he was safe from detection and proceed so
  calmly to arrange the business of the mine and plan the future. Larry would
  not have offered her £1,000 unless he had been certain of being able to let
  her have it; and how, unless he were innocent, could he be certain? Of course
  she had never really believed that he had killed Louis: it was only because
  she had been half out of her mind last night that the thought had come to
  her. And yet, if Larry were innocent, why had he not been willing to tell her
  so when she had asked him? Just "No" would have set her mind at rest, and he
  had refused to say it. And that must really mean... And so it began all over
  again.</p>

  <p>She saw Tubby mooning about the garden and smiled faintly. There was no
  hope of getting any information from Larry if he did not wish to give it to
  her, but Tubby Storman was a different proposition. Old Tubby was a dear. He
  would no more do a rotten thing than Larry. But he was different. With Larry,
  she felt, it was a question of deliberate choice; he had worked out a code of
  conduct for himself in which every action and motive was labelled good or
  bad, and disciplined himself to observe it. Larry always struck her as being
  stern with himself, harsh in his judgment of his own actions, regulating his
  life by the strength of his will. But with Tubby it was a matter of feelings.
  Bad things hurt Tubby. He did not submit an action to the judgment of his
  reason: he just felt that it was good or bad, and that settled the question
  beyond all argument. Not so clever as Larry, of course. If she had asked
  Tubby what she had asked Larry, he might not have answered with a direct
  "Yes" or "No," but he would have floundered and blundered to such an extent
  in trying to evade the issue that she would almost certainly have known the
  answer as surely as if he had given her a direct reply. And Tubby knew
  something. Mark, too. All three of them had something on their minds, and if
  Larry would not tell her...</p>

  <p>She went to the balustrade of the veranda and called him, beckoning. He
  came slowly, reluctantly, pausing every now and then to gaze thoughtfully at
  a plant in the garden, obviously anxious to prolong the journey to the
  veranda as much as possible. She remembered doing just the same&mdash;pausing
  to gaze in the shop windows, waiting with exaggerated caution for traffic to
  pass before she crossed the road, deliberately choosing the longest
  route&mdash;when she had been on her way to the dentist. Dear old Tubby! He
  was dreadfully transparent. He would probably try to show her how unconcerned
  he was by talking about the weather.</p>

  <p>He paused by the veranda, and his chubby face creased into a friendly
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Jackie! Topping morning, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Come up here, Tubby, and sit down."</p>

  <p>He lowered himself into a deck chair beside her and gazed with an air of
  innocent interest at the horizon.</p>

  <p>For a few moments Jacqueline watched him with amusement in her eyes.
  Then:</p>

  <p>"Tubby, who killed Louis Creet?"</p>

  <p>She saw him give a violent start and instantly suppress it. His face, as
  he turned to her, was almost ludicrous in its exaggerated expression of
  bewildered innocence.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Jackie!" he exclaimed. "What a question! Why ask me?"</p>

  <p>"I have asked you, Tubby."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;absolutely&mdash;of course you have."</p>

  <p>She could see that he was thinking furiously, his mind in a sudden panic.
  She decided on further shock tactics.</p>

  <p>"Did you, Tubby?"</p>

  <p>"Good God, Jackie, I wouldn't&mdash;what I mean is, you've absolutely no
  right to say a thing like that, you know. It's a pretty rotten sort of thing
  to say to a fellow. I mean, I liked old Louis. He was jolly good to me, one
  way and another. Did I tell you about what he did at Christmas? He sent a
  whole lot of toys and things&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She cut him short.</p>

  <p>"I didn't ask you, Tubby, to give me all the reasons why you shouldn't
  want to kill Louis. I asked you if you killed him. But you'd never have the
  heart to kill a man who sent toys to your kids at Christmas, would you?"</p>

  <p>Tubby forced a grin. "It's pretty amusing, really, Jackie. Do I look as if
  I've got a cold-blooded murder on my conscience?"</p>

  <p>"You do, Tubby&mdash;exactly."</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>If it had not been of such terrible importance to her, Jacqueline could
  have laughed at the startled, distressed look on his face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're not the only one," she said. "Mark looks just the same, and
  Larry's nearly as bad. You've something on that nice old mind of yours.
  Tubby, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, yes, I suppose we've all got something on our nice old minds,"
  he admitted. "Everything's in a nice old mess all round, if you ask me. All
  that fuss with Louis over the mine&mdash;" He stopped abruptly.</p>

  <p>"But we don't want to talk about all that."</p>

  <p>"I do, Tubby."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't," replied Tubby with a touch of impatience. "And what's
  more, I'm not going to talk about it, so it's no use to keep nagging at me.
  If I start talking I always tell people all sorts of things I don't mean to
  tell them. At least, that's what Larry says."</p>

  <p>"And Larry told you to keep your mouth shut and tell nobody anything, eh.
  Tubby?"</p>

  <p>"Hang it, there you go again!" exclaimed Tubby. "Just because you've got
  an idea in your head that I know something about old Louis, you keep on
  trying to pump it out of me, and I'm jolly well not going to tell you."</p>

  <p>"Then you do know something?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to say whether I do or don't," said Tubby resolutely. "It
  isn't reasonable to expect it. A fellow doesn't give his pals away, Jackie,
  and you've no right to ask him to."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline smiled. Dear old Tubby! "A fellow doesn't give his pals away."
  But which pal? She sat for some minutes in thoughtful silence.</p>

  <p>"Tubby, did Larry do it?"</p>

  <p>Tubby's jaw gave a very fair imitation of Larry's in his most obstinate
  moments.</p>

  <p>"Or Mark?"</p>

  <p>Tubby shrugged a shoulder.</p>

  <p>"More likely to be Larry," added Jacqueline. "He was furious with Louis
  over the mine&mdash;and other things&mdash;and he's not so soft-hearted as
  you, Tubby. Larry would shoot a bad man while you were trying to persuade him
  to be good. Oh, well! Larry wouldn't have done a thing like that without some
  very good reason&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tubby swung round and faced her. "Good Lord, Jackie, you mustn't go
  thinking that Larry&mdash;I mean, you do jump to conclusions so. I didn't say
  Larry had done it. I've no reason for thinking he did it any more
  than&mdash;than anyone else. I'd hate you to get ideas like that into your
  head. I mean, if Larry had done a thing like&mdash;well, I know how I'd feel
  about it. I'd never be able to look Bunty in the eyes again, and Larry would
  feel the same. I wish to goodness you'd forget the rotten business, Jackie.
  The police are looking after it, and it does no good to keep on nagging at
  it."</p>

  <p>"Righto, Tubby!" said Jacqueline. "We'll talk about something else. I
  suppose the mine will be all right now, won't it?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so."</p>

  <p>"Does Bunty know she's probably the wife of a millionaire?"</p>

  <p>He nodded. "I wired her first thing. It absolutely knocked her over, I
  bet. I expect all she's worrying about now is when I'll get home."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline smiled. "I'd like to be there when you do," she said. "What
  will you do, Tubby?&mdash;when you first meet her, I mean, after all this
  long time. I think I can picture it. You won't say much; probably neither of
  you will say anything. You'll just take her head in your hands, and look in
  her eyes and kiss her, eh, Tubby?"</p>

  <p>Tubby's eyes softened, and a smile crept over his face.</p>

  <p>"That's about it, Jackie," he said softly.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline nodded. "Straight in her eyes&mdash;without flinching&mdash;eh,
  Tubby?"</p>

  <p>He shot her a quick, suspicious glance. "Here, I say, Jackie,
  what&mdash;what are you getting at?" he exclaimed, rising from his chair. "If
  you're still trying to trip me up and get at something&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I won't try any more, Tubby, I promise you."</p>

  <p>"Huh!" grunted Tubby. "Well, I'm not risking it, anyway."</p>

  <p>He strode away, and for the rest of the day nobody knew what had become of
  him.</p>

  <p>It was not until after dinner that evening that he put in an appearance at
  the bungalow&mdash;to find Larry and Mark seated on the veranda.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Tubby!" Larry called to him as he was hastily entering the
  house. "Sit down and have a drink. I've been looking for you all the
  afternoon. Where have you been skulking?"</p>

  <p>Tubby poured out a drink, swallowed it, and sat down. "Been at the club,"
  he mumbled.</p>

  <p>Larry smiled. "Africa is full of wonders," he laughed. "A club in this
  benighted spot!"</p>

  <p>"Just like any other rotten club," growled Tubby; "a lot of old hens all
  cackling about the&mdash;murder."</p>

  <p>"I met the local bank manager this afternoon," said Mark, "and he could
  talk of nothing else."</p>

  <p>"And that," laughed Larry, "is the first time for many years that I've
  heard a bank manager mentioned without getting a shiver down my spine. What
  did he&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Only that everybody thinks it's all very curious." Larry nodded. "Bright
  blokes, bank managers. And now let's get to business. Less whisky, please,
  Mr. Storman. There's no room in this firm for directors with purple
  noses."</p>

  <p>Tubby, with a guilty air, replaced the decanter which was halfway to his
  glass.</p>

  <p>"Sorry!" he said. "But a chap must do something."</p>

  <p>"This is the first official meeting of the firm," said Larry, "and I
  should hate to record in the minutes that Mr. Percy Storman was blotto. And
  now try to look like a business magnate, Tubby, and listen. I've seen the
  lawyer bloke and completed all the necessary formalities for the registration
  of the mine. It's in our joint names, of course. I've paid the denouncement
  fees and, incidentally, God knows how many milreis to the mining agent. A
  mining agent, Tubby, is a voracious animal with predatory instincts and an
  insatiable appetite for milreis, that lives as far as possible from the
  discomforts of a goldfield. But if you don't feed the brute generously
  there's likely to be trouble over your title."</p>

  <p>"You've put&mdash;him&mdash;in for a share?" asked Tubby.</p>

  <p>"You mean Louis Creet?"</p>

  <p>Tubby nodded.</p>

  <p>"Louis Creet, late but not lamented," said Larry, "is in for an equal
  share with the rest of us. That was the original agreement. I've no idea who
  his heirs are, but in any case they're entitled to it, and there'll be more
  than enough to go round. By the way, Tubby, you'll have to mention Louis now
  and then, but there's no need to look like a chief mourner and breathe his
  name with awe and reverence. If it's troubling your conscience that he died
  before you'd forgiven him, you can put up a tablet to his memory in our
  office&mdash;when we get one. But don't expect me to raise my hat when I pass
  it. Next, I've wired to an engineer at the Cape&mdash;a first-class
  man&mdash;to bring up a staff and get busy organizing the mine at once. Is
  that all approved of?"</p>

  <p>Mark nodded.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," said Tubby. "You've done wonders, but&mdash;well, doing all
  this&mdash;getting the engineer up here, for instance&mdash;it seems to me
  that until we know&mdash;one way or the other&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The speech tailed off lamely.</p>

  <p>"What Tubby means," explained Mark, "is that perhaps we're being a little
  optimistic in making all these arrangements until we know for certain that
  we're not all going to be hanged."</p>

  <p>"You've got a rotten way of putting things, Mark," said Tubby, "but that
  is how it strikes me. It seems to be pretty obvious to me that until this
  rotten affair over Louis is settled we'd be much wiser to hold our hands. If
  people get to know we're registering the mine, they might imagine&mdash;well,
  you know the rotten sort of thing they'd be likely to say."</p>

  <p>"Everybody knows already that we've registered the mine," said Larry.
  "It's all over the town. And as Louis is in for an equal share with us they
  can hardly say we killed him to do him out of his interest. Besides, they're
  not likely to hang all three of us, and if I'm to be the one for the high
  jump, I'd like to know that everything's in order and you two blokes
  secure."</p>

  <p>Mark smiled. "As a racing man, Larry," he said, "I've just had a cheery
  thought: that if I'm selected for the high jump I shall enter the next world
  over the Styx. That's probably a bit beyond you, Tubby, but you can take it
  from me that it's a fairly bright effort."</p>

  <p>"We'll put it in the minutes," grinned Larry. He pulled a map from his
  pocket and spread it on the table. "Have a look at this," he said. "In a
  year's time we'll have a proper concrete road running from the
  bush&mdash;Chumbaziri&mdash;Pylapo&mdash;Timalani&mdash;and so home."</p>

  <p>They leaned over the table, watching the tip of Larry's pencil as it
  traced the route. And suddenly, as he leaned back in his chair again, Tubby
  gave a violent start, staring fixedly out into the garden.</p>

  <p>"What is it&mdash;something bitten you?" asked Larry.</p>

  <p>"Take the advice of a hard-bitten explorer," said Mark, "and if you feel
  like scratching, scratch."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Larry," said Tubby in a hoarse whisper, "what does that fellow
  want? The inspector, I mean. I just caught sight of him&mdash;coming up
  through the garden. Didn't you see him?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't. Don't be a blithering fool, Tubby. Is the inspector
  supposed to have been lurking in the bushes and listening, or what?"</p>

  <p>"The nearest cover for even a small-sized police inspector," remarked
  Mark, "is a good twenty yards away. In any case, we've said nothing that
  couldn't be said without a blush by a young curate at a mothers'
  meeting."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but what does he want&mdash;coming here at this time of night?"
  persisted Tubby.</p>

  <p>"For your information, Tubby," said Larry, "there was a murder committed
  here last night, and a murder is something in which every policeman takes a
  morbid interest. He has probably thought of a few questions which he forgot
  to ask last night. I've been expecting him to roll up all day."</p>

  <p>"So has Mrs. Thurston," smiled Mark. "She's counting on being questioned.
  I fancy it's the first murder she has had anything to do with, and she
  doesn't want to be left out of it."</p>

  <p>"This isn't business," Larry reminded them. "We're getting like real
  directors already. That's the route, anyway, and there's plenty of limestones
  round here. Of course we shall need a police guard of some sort or we shall
  have a crowd of Portuguese gold buyers squatting on the property, and half
  the gold will go west. I should say there'll be no trouble about that,
  though. And then there's the question of plant. I imagine it'll take some
  time to get the proper plant out, and in the meantime we'll start them
  hand-washing."</p>

  <p>The other two nodded their assent.</p>

  <p>"And now about us," continued Larry. "I'm going up country again at the
  first possible moment, and I propose staying there six months at least. But
  there's no need for all three of us to be there. The Thurstons, I believe,
  intend catching the next boat home, and I suggest that you two go with
  them."</p>

  <p>"Eh?" exclaimed Tubby.</p>

  <p>"The idea is, Tubby," explained Mark, "that you and I should leave Larry
  roaming about the swamps of West Africa and push off to Piccadilly. As far as
  I'm concerned, Larry, there's nothing doing."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely couldn't be done," said Tubby firmly.</p>

  <p>Larry made a gesture of impatience. "What's the use of staying out here?"
  he asked. "Neither of you would be of any more use than a pain in the neck.
  Quite seriously, though, it's essential for one or other of you to be in
  England. There'll be a ton of things to see to at that end&mdash;all the
  machinery to buy and&mdash;everything."</p>

  <p>Mark leaned back in his chair and regarded the roof of the veranda.</p>

  <p>"<i>J'y suis, j'y reste,</i>" he said. "That's a French saying, Larry,
  meaning, 'You can't put that sort of thing over on me.' You're rumbled."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," said Tubby. "Got you taped, old boy."</p>

  <p>Larry frowned. "I don't know what you think I'm up to," he said. "If you
  imagine I'm going to hide the mine while you're away and pretend I've lost
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What you're up to," said Mark, "is pushing us out of the country in
  double-quick time because you think we'd better go while the going's good.
  Talk sense, Larry, for God's sake. You know there's going to be the devil's
  own row over this Louis Creet business&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And if you expect Mark and me to push off," Tubby interrupted, "and leave
  you to face the music&mdash;Good Lord, Larry! Have a heart! <i>Quod dixi,
  dixi</i>; and that's what the Romans used to say when they meant, 'Cut it
  out, old boy.'"</p>

  <p>"I see," said Larry. "So you're going to make a good start by being
  damnably awkward&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped and turned as Dr. Thurston came onto the veranda.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, you fellows," said the doctor, "but I've a bit of bad news for
  you. Nothing to worry about, but&mdash;well, disappointing. The police
  inspector has just been to see me."</p>

  <p>"Well?" rapped Larry.</p>

  <p>"He was very polite about it," said the doctor, "and broke the news as
  gently as he could, but it boils down to this: that until this trouble over
  Louis is cleared up none of us must leave Benguella. If we try to, I
  gathered, we shall be arrested."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Thurston, always susceptible to "atmosphere," had found
  the week following Louis's death a very trying one. She had scarcely passed a
  comfortable minute. Meals, with all at the table eating their food as if they
  hated the sight of it, and never saying a word except to bite somebody's head
  off, had been dreadful ordeals, and she had several times, in sheer
  desperation, pleaded a headache and gone without her lunch rather than face
  the half-hour at the table.</p>

  <p>She had no idea what it was all about, and everybody, when she had made
  tactful enquiries, had chosen to be annoyingly baffling. That dreadful affair
  over Louis, of course, had upset them, but it did not, she felt, account for
  the extraordinary way everyone was behaving.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline, just when she had seemed to have suddenly recovered her old
  spirits, had just as suddenly relapsed into a state of irritable depression.
  The child was obviously unhappy, but she could get nothing out of her, and
  after several attempts at coaxing her to confidence, she had given up trying.
  She had an idea that it was all in some way connected with Larry and Louis,
  but she could not make head or tail of it. If people would be so baffling,
  there was really nothing for her to do but leave things alone and hope that
  they would sort themselves out somehow.</p>

  <p>Even John was behaving in a most puzzling way. He was usually so cheerful,
  no matter how difficult things were, and if anything went wrong he had always
  talked it over with her. But during the last few days he seemed to have
  closed himself up and deliberately shut her out from any share in his
  thoughts; and every now and then, when he had not been aware that she was
  watching him, she had seen his face clouded with anxiety and caught a look in
  his eyes which had puzzled and distressed her. But he had laughed off her
  questions and declared that she was imagining things.</p>

  <p>And Larry, Mark, and Tubby presented a still more baffling problem. They
  had hardly a civil word for anyone&mdash;least of all for one another. Such a
  pity, when they had been such tremendous friends. Larry, of course, had
  always been inclined to be short-tempered, but now he was really quite the
  most amiable of the three. Except that he was smoking a great deal more than
  usual, Larry was much as he always was. But Mark never seemed to want to
  speak to anyone, and resented it when anyone spoke to him, and was behaving
  exactly like a sulky child, sitting for hours at a time on the veranda
  staring at the sea and drinking glass after glass of whisky. And yesterday,
  when Larry had said something to him about it, she really had thought that
  Mark was going to jump up and hit him.</p>

  <p>As for Tubby&mdash;well, she had never known anyone change so utterly as
  Tubby had changed. She did wish he would sometimes sit down. He was never
  still for five minutes on end now&mdash;always lumbering about the place as
  if he were trying to escape from someone who was following him, with a look
  in his eyes which somehow made her want to stroke his head and comfort him.
  And when he did sit down, he kept fidgeting with his hands, twisting his
  fingers and making the joints crack, as if he were trying to stop himself
  from screaming.</p>

  <p>As Jacqueline came into the room Mrs. Thurston glanced up and gave her
  most cheerful smile.</p>

  <p>"Such a lovely morning, Jackie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where's Father?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"He's out," said Mrs. Thurston. "Something about the police and an
  aeroplane, dear, but he was in a dreadful hurry and I really didn't quite
  understand. I believe he said he might have to go to St. Paul de Loanda or
  some such place&mdash;the names are really very hard to remember, dear; so
  much more muddling than in England&mdash;but I hope he's not thinking of
  going by aeroplane. I'm sure with a black man as a pilot it wouldn't be at
  all safe."</p>

  <p>"It would be a Portuguese pilot, Mother," said Jacqueline with a smile,
  "and it's really quite safe when the pilot hasn't had too much gin. They
  haven't had a crash, Larry says, for nearly a fortnight. What's Father going
  to St. Paul for?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, it's no use asking me," sighed her mother. "Nobody tells me
  anything these days, and I've given up enquiring. Everybody seems at sixes
  and sevens, and I'm sure I've wished a dozen times that we'd stayed in
  England and gone to Bournemouth or somewhere for a month. What with Larry and
  the others&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with Larry?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, what's wrong with everybody? They all seem so dreadfully worried
  and strange and unlike themselves."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline gave a shrug.</p>

  <p>"It can't be very pleasant for them, Mother, can it? About Louis, I mean.
  Of course, there's absolutely no evidence against Larry or Mark or Tubby;
  they were all elsewhere when the shot was fired. Still, somebody shot
  Louis."</p>

  <p>"But nobody could possibly suspect Larry or Mark or Tubby of having done
  it," protested Mrs. Thurston. "Anybody with the least sense would know that
  none of them could possibly do such a dreadful thing."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline smiled.</p>

  <p>"You know it. Mother. So&mdash;so do I. But it's rotten for them, all the
  same, feeling that other people suspect them. And of course people do. They
  suspect all of us. Me, too, probably. After all, I was there&mdash;in the
  room&mdash;when the others came in&mdash;and if anyone is under
  suspicion&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear, don't talk such nonsense," interrupted her mother. "Why should
  you shoot Louis? He was always very good to you, and I'm sure you were very
  fond of him, and you could have no possible reason&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for heaven's sake. Mother, don't let's talk about it," interrupted
  Jacqueline. She laid a hand on her mother's shoulder and smiled at her. "It's
  been a rotten sort of holiday for you, darling," she said. "I really do
  believe Bournemouth would have done you more good."</p>

  <p>"My dear Jackie," said her mother, "I wouldn't in the least mind Africa if
  only people would cheer up!"</p>

  <p>Jacqueline was anxious to avoid further questioning. All the questions
  which her mother had put or would put to her were questions which she had
  asked herself dozens of times during the past week and had been unable to
  answer. She had the same complaint against everyone as her mother: nobody
  would tell her anything&mdash;not even Larry.</p>

  <p>Larry had been avoiding her&mdash;purposely, obviously manoeuvring so that
  he should not be left alone with her. She thought she understood why. Larry
  had put her on a pedestal, and she had toppled off, and he had no interest in
  the broken pieces. She did not blame him. Men were like that&mdash;different
  from women. If Larry had tumbled off a pedestal she would not have avoided
  him, no matter how chipped or broken he might be. Besides, he didn't want her
  asking any more questions.</p>

  <p>Stepping onto the veranda, she saw Larry, sprawling in a deck chair,
  making pencil notes on a slip of paper, frowning ominously. As he heard her
  step he glanced up.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Jackie! How many sleepers three feet apart in a mile of railway
  line? Or should I write to Einstein? I'm working things out&mdash;for the
  mine, you know."</p>

  <p>She flung herself in the chair beside his.</p>

  <p>"How's the mine going, Larry? All fixed up?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely, Jackie. I hope you appreciate the fact that you're probably
  sitting next to a millionaire."</p>

  <p>"Then if the mine's all right, Larry, what in the name of fortune is wrong
  with you all?"</p>

  <p>Larry raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Wrong?"</p>

  <p>"With you, Mark, Tubby, Father&mdash;everybody," said Jacqueline. "You're
  all behaving as if you had a secret pain somewhere, and not one of you is fit
  to speak to."</p>

  <p>Larry sighed.</p>

  <p>"And I thought I was being particularly charming. I made three splendid
  jokes at breakfast, Jackie. Even you didn't laugh, though."</p>

  <p>She gave a shrug.</p>

  <p>"I'd seen them in <i>Punch</i>," she said. "But seriously, Larry, you
  haven't quarrelled, have you, with Tubby and Mark?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"We love each other like the Three Musketeers, Jackie."</p>

  <p>She leaned back in her chair with a sigh and for some minutes sat watching
  Larry's face as he worked at his figures. And then she sat upright again.</p>

  <p>"Larry," she said, "is it anything to do with me? Oh, don't pretend not to
  understand. All this glowering and glaring and sulking and never having a
  pleasant word for anybody. You're all three the same, and Father isn't much
  better. Of course you're fed up with me; I can understand that. But I don't
  see why Mark and Tubby&mdash;oh, I don't know! Do I come into it
  somewhere?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Then what is it? Louis Creet?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged.</p>

  <p>"We won't talk about Louis if you don't mind, Jackie. You know what they
  say&mdash;De mortuis nil nisi bunkum&mdash;and I don't think I'm equal to the
  bunkum!"</p>

  <p>"You're worried about it, aren't you, Larry?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, aren't you a damned little nuisance!" sighed Larry. "Yes, if
  you must know, of course I'm worried, and Mark and Tubby are still more
  worried because they've got sweeter natures than mine. And Tubby can't stand
  the idea that a few Portuguese policemen may have a suspicion that he plugged
  Louis."</p>

  <p>"Somebody killed him, Larry."</p>

  <p>"Quite. And it's a bit nerve-racking, Jackie, hanging about here and
  feeling all the time that everybody thinks we did it. It's not surprising, is
  it, if our tempers are a bit ragged? I believe Tubby lies awake every night
  wondering how long a drop they'll give him and whether it's the thing to
  shake hands with the hangman&mdash;just as a sort of sporting gesture."</p>

  <p>Jacqueline nodded.</p>

  <p>"It must be pretty foul," she admitted, and was silent again.</p>

  <p>"Larry," she said suddenly, "you know, don't you? Who did kill Louis?"</p>

  <p>Larry continued gazing at his slip of paper.</p>

  <p>"'I, said the sparrow,' he grinned, "'with my bow and arrow.' Or it
  wouldn't surprise me to learn, Jackie, that an angel was sent to put him
  out&mdash;just to purify the African atmosphere."</p>

  <p>"In other words, mind my own business, eh?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"And put some powder on your nose," he added. "It's shiny."</p>

  <p>She rose.</p>

  <p>"Righto, Larry!" she said. "I said you'd changed, didn't I? So you have.
  But I suppose a man can't be expected to become a millionaire without
  changing. It's hard to believe when you never know where your next fiver's
  coming from, but they say most people are spoilt if they get a lot of money.
  Once upon a time you used to tell me everything."</p>

  <p>"And now I've changed, eh, Jackie?" He shook his head. "Barring a few grey
  hairs, which only make me look more distinguished, I'm the same fool I always
  have been."</p>

  <p>"Then why won't you tell me what's worrying you?"</p>

  <p>He tossed his paper and pencil onto the table, rose, and placed a hand on
  each of her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Jackie," he said gravely. "Things are pretty difficult just now
  one way and another, and you're only making them more so. There's something
  I'd very much like to tell you, but just at the moment I can't do
  it&mdash;and that's the chief trouble as far as I'm concerned. That's good
  enough, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and as Larry seated himself again, Mark and Tubby came onto
  the veranda, flung themselves into chairs, and stared gloomily out to sea.
  Jacqueline stood for a moment glancing with perplexed eyes from one solemn
  face to the other; and then she smiled.</p>

  <p>"The Three Disgraces!" she laughed, and went indoors.</p>

  <p>Tubby glanced up, glaring. "I say, what the deuce did she mean by that?"
  he demanded. "I tell you, Larry, the way people keep on hinting
  things&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was cut short by the appearance of Dr. Thurston, who came hurrying from
  the garden.</p>

  <p>"I've just been seeing the police," he announced.</p>

  <p>Tubby glanced at him sharply.</p>

  <p>"They phoned and asked me to call round," added the doctor. "They've been
  through to St. Paul.... They want me to go over at once and see the
  governor."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, what for?" demanded Tubby.</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston shrugged.</p>

  <p>"As the medical man-on-the-spot, I suppose I've got to answer still more
  questions," he said. "The police here don't seem satisfied, and there's no
  getting out of going. They're sending me over by 'plane, so I should be back
  before sundown. I'm off at once. Meanwhile"&mdash;with a wave of his hand
  towards the decanter on the table&mdash;"go steady with that, all of you, or
  I shall be having you on my hands."</p>

  <p>As soon as the doctor had entered the house. Tubby sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Larry!" he exclaimed in an agitated voice. "What does that
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"Probably that a drunken Portuguese pilot will break his neck," he said.
  "According to the law of averages another accident is well overdue."</p>

  <p>"But if the police have sent him&mdash;what I mean is, why?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up, Tubby!" exclaimed Larry. "To fetch a rope, probably. Three
  ropes, for all I know. They'll line us up in a row, I expect, and we shan't
  hear what the chaplain's saying because of your teeth chattering. Sit down
  and have a drink and don't get the wind up. You get on my nerves."</p>

  <p>Mark helped himself to a drink and swallowed it at a gulp.</p>

  <p>"You're getting right on top of me, Tubby," he said irritably. "You're
  making it so poisonously hard for all of us. The whole rotten business is
  getting on my nerves. And you don't help, Larry, by spitting poison every
  time you speak. You know what they're saying in the town now, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"The town can go to blazes."</p>

  <p>"That's all very well," said Tubby. "You may not care, Larry, but I do. I
  suppose I'm not cut out for this job, and it's pretty rotten, I can tell you.
  They're saying quite openly now that one of us three must have shot
  Louis&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Since one of us three did shoot Louis," said Larry, "they're not so far
  wrong, are they?"</p>

  <p>"Staring at us in the street," said Mark, "pointing to us, crossing the
  road to avoid us as if we were lepers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you're so thin-skinned that you blush all over your face," snapped
  Larry, "and give them every reason for doing it again. Let them stare, let
  them point, let them cross the road! Who cares, anyway? Drowning kittens is
  more in your line than shooting a swine like Creet."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't mind admitting that I feel pretty rotten about it," said
  Tubby. "Frankly, Larry, it's getting me down&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then for heaven's sake creep in the corner and have a good snivel and get
  it over."</p>

  <p>"What I mean is, murder's murder, whichever way you look at it," explained
  Tubby. "I've been thinking a good deal about this business&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then stick to thinking," interrupted Mark savagely, "and stop talking.
  Tubby. You've done nothing but talk, talk, talk all the morning, and it does
  no more good than Larry's snarling sarcasm."</p>

  <p>"Who wouldn't snarl?" said Larry. "We went into this thing with our eyes
  open. We all knew the risks we were running, and we were all prepared to take
  them. And now, Tubby, when the thing's over and done with, you start whining
  because people look at you in the street. If you've no more guts than that,
  you should have kept out of the business and left it to me, as I wanted you
  to."</p>

  <p>"It isn't a question of guts at all," said Tubby. "Not as far as I'm
  concerned, anyway. I don't care much what happens to me now that Bunty and
  the kids are provided for."</p>

  <p>"You'll start and look guilty," said Larry, "every time you see a
  policeman's helmet for the rest of your life."</p>

  <p>"And every time you see a revolver," added Mark, "your eyes will fill with
  tears."</p>

  <p>Tubby heaved a prodigious sigh.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why you both keep nagging at me," he complained, striding up
  and down the veranda. "I'm only saying it isn't a question of guts at all.
  It's just knowing all the time that one of us did it and sort of not being
  able to look one another in the eyes, if you know what I mean. And it'll
  always be the same. I've been thinking about this a good deal, and it's
  pretty clear to me that we'll never be able to forget it. What I'm getting at
  is that we've always been pretty close friends and good pals and all that
  sort of thing, and this business is going to mess up our friendship."</p>

  <p>"Severed by Sin," suggested Larry.</p>

  <p>"0h, shut up," snapped Mark, "and let him get it off his chest. Go on,
  Tubby."</p>

  <p>"Well, you see my point, don't you?" said Tubby. "I don't mind telling you
  chaps that, after Bunty and the kids, I reckon our friendship's about the
  best thing I've got, and it seems a pity to go messing it up this way."</p>

  <p>"If you'll take a good strong nerve tonic. Tubby," said Larry, "there'll
  be no messing up."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure," said Mark. "It's come pretty near to it already, if you
  ask me. What's it going to be like in a few months' time&mdash;in a few
  years' time?</p>

  <p>Larry shrugged.</p>

  <p>"If Tubby doesn't get a grip of himself," he said, "one of us will have
  been strung up before then, so the other two will have easy consciences and
  can love each other to their hearts' content. Why the devil can't you sit
  down, Tubby?"</p>

  <p>Tubby, with a pained expression, subsided into a chair.</p>

  <p>"Besides," he added, "as I said just now, murder's murder whichever way
  you look at it."</p>

  <p>"'Execution' is the word in this case, Tubby," said Larry. "Creet got what
  he deserved."</p>

  <p>Tubby shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It looked like that a week ago," he said, "but I don't see it that way
  now. I've done a good deal of thinking lately, and it's as clear as daylight
  to me now where I slipped up. You said we were justified in shooting those
  bearers who got sleeping sickness and went mad, because if we hadn't killed
  them they'd have killed us. But Louis hadn't got sleeping sickness and gone
  mad, and we knew jolly well he wouldn't have killed us. He'd have swindled us
  out of the mine, and that's all."</p>

  <p>"It isn't all," said Larry, "but never mind."</p>

  <p>"What I'm getting at," continued Tubby, "is that there's a difference
  between shooting a man to stop him killing you and shooting a man to stop him
  pinching your money."</p>

  <p>"It makes no difference now, anyway," said Larry with a shrug. "The job's
  done, and I'm telling you that there's nothing for it now but to put up with
  it without making a song about it."</p>

  <p>"And I'm telling you, Larry," exclaimed Tubby excitedly, starting to his
  feet again and restlessly pacing the veranda, "that I can't put up with it.
  It's getting me down, and when I think that I've got to go on like
  this&mdash;My God, Larry, I can't do it&mdash;keeping it up year after year,
  pretending all the time to Bunty, always wondering if something's been found
  out.... Damn the money! I'd rather fling the whole lot in the sea. I wish to
  God I'd never come to Africa, never found the mine, never had anything to do
  with our rotten agreement. For two pins I'd make a clean breast of the whole
  business."</p>

  <p>Larry sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Do that, Tubby," he said grimly, "and I'll break your neck without
  turning a hair. You're not alone in this. I'm in it, Mark's in it, and
  however you may feel about it now, you made the agreement and you're going to
  stick to it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't mind me," said Mark. "After all, there's a good deal in what
  Tubby says. I'm not squeamish, but there's a rotten stink about this
  business. Let him blab if he wants to."</p>

  <p>Larry eyed them both scornfully.</p>

  <p>"A couple of quitters, eh?" he said. "But you're not going to quit, either
  of you. You made an agreement with me, and I hold you to it. Louis got
  killed&mdash;with your consent&mdash;for backing out of an agreement, and now
  you're wanting to do the same."</p>

  <p>He paused, watching them with puzzled eyes.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Mark&mdash;Tubby&mdash;what's happened to you?"</p>

  <p>"Look here," said Tubby; "it's not that I want to let you and Mark down,
  but&mdash;well, it's conscience, I suppose. I always was a sentimental sort
  of ass, you know; but I'm built that way and I can't help it. I'd feel much
  happier if I made a clean breast of the whole thing and took the
  consequences. If you and Mark agree, I'll own up to having shot Louis. It
  won't affect you two&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Larry cut him short.</p>

  <p>"You'll do nothing of the sort, Tubby. If you didn't kill Creet, then one
  of us two knows you didn't, and you'd leave him no choice but to come forward
  and say so. You'd be forcing him to give himself away. And if you did kill
  Creet, you'd be incriminating both of us, because we agreed that if one of us
  got into a mess over this affair the other two should use all their resources
  to get him out of it, and we'd be obliged to come forward and admit we had a
  hand in it too. We'd be accessories before the fact, Tubby, so you can cut
  that idea of yours right out."</p>

  <p>Tubby returned dejectedly to his chair, and for a while no word was
  spoken.</p>

  <p>"Look here, you fellows," said Larry at length. "If you feel like that
  about it, it's no use going on. I'm not blaming you; you're possibly quite
  right. We were all a bit worked up when we made our agreement or we should
  probably never have made it. But if the agreement is to be ended, there's
  only one fair way of doing it."</p>

  <p>Mark and Tubby glanced at him inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"We can't have anyone owning up to a crime he didn't commit," continued
  Larry, "because, as I said just now, the one who did commit it would be
  obliged to inform the police that he was a liar. If you're really serious
  about it, what I suggest is this: that the one who did shoot Creet should
  give himself up to the authorities, and that the other two should be under no
  obligation to do anything to help him. In fact, they should be under a
  definite obligation to keep their mouths shut and give him no help at all.
  One man in a mess because of Louis Creet is quite enough; he's not worth all
  three of us. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>For several moments the other two remained silent.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but look here, Larry," began Tubby, "it doesn't seem
  fair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's perfectly fair," interrupted Larry. "Anyway, it's that or the
  original agreement. What do you say, Mark?"</p>

  <p>Mark shrugged.</p>

  <p>"If it suits you and Tubby it suits me," he said. "Anything for a quiet
  life."</p>

  <p>"Tubby?"</p>

  <p>Tubby's eyes were distressed.</p>

  <p>"Hang it, Larry, I don't quite see it's fair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mark and I agree. Yes or no?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right!" sighed Tubby. "Have it your own way."</p>

  <p>Larry smiled.</p>

  <p>"Then that's settled," he said. "The executioner of Louis Creet will
  proudly enter the police station and confess his noble action tomorrow
  morning. Is that agreed?"</p>

  <p>They nodded.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dr. Thurston was not back by sundown&mdash;not, however,
  because the pilot had broken his neck or the law of averages claimed its
  overdue accident. Both pilot and the law of averages were partly responsible:
  the pilot because, having generously filled himself up at St. Paul during his
  hour's wait for his passenger, he entirely overlooked the necessity of
  rendering a similar service to the aeroplane, with the result that, when
  scarcely more than half of the return journey had been covered, he was forced
  to descend in search of petrol; and the law of averages because it insisted
  that, in obedience to its demand that not more than a very limited mileage
  should be flown without mishap, he should today damage his machine in landing
  and be unable to proceed.</p>

  <p>A message had come through from the doctor that he was finishing the
  journey by car, and after dinner Mrs. Thurston, anxious to escape the
  "atmosphere," chose the first possible moment to retire to bed.</p>

  <p>Jacqueline, having played the piano for half an hour to an audience of
  three men who gave no sign that they were even aware of her presence, dropped
  her hands to her lap and glanced from one to another with a puzzled
  frown.</p>

  <p>"Rounds of applause!" she laughed. "I'll sing 'Parted,' Tubby, shall
  I?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, no&mdash;please don't," begged Tubby. "Thanks all the same,
  Jackie, but I'm a bit off 'Parted.'"</p>

  <p>She got up from the piano.</p>

  <p>"Who'd be a millionaire!" she sighed. "Where is it. Tubby&mdash;in the
  neck?"</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"The pain," laughed Jacqueline. "You're a cheery crowd, aren't you?" She
  turned to Larry. "When shall we be able to leave this God-forsaken country,
  Larry? It's beginning to get me down."</p>

  <p>"Ask a policeman, Jackie."</p>

  <p>"And who's coming back to England? All of you?"</p>

  <p>"Someone will have to stop behind," said Larry. "I fancy I shall be
  staying in any case."</p>

  <p>Mark and Tubby glanced at him, but he avoided their eyes.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," said Mark, "we haven't decided yet who'll be
  stopping. One of us, though."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," agreed Tubby. "The mine, you know, Jackie. Someone will have
  to stay behind to see about the mine, but we haven't agreed yet which one of
  us it's to be. We shall know&mdash;tomorrow."</p>

  <p>She nodded and went thoughtfully to the door.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to write some letters," she said. "But couldn't somebody smile
  before I go?"</p>

  <p>Tubby forced a smile and turned his face towards her.</p>

  <p>"How's that, Jackie?"</p>

  <p>"Awful!" sighed Larry. "If I had to find a title for that close-up, Tubby,
  I'd call it 'Tortured by Toothache.' Mark could do better than that. See what
  you can do for the lady, Mark."</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha!" exclaimed Mark. "How's that, Jackie?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged.</p>

  <p>"If I had to find a title for that, Mark, I'd call it 'Earth Falling in a
  Coffin,'" she said, and went from the room.</p>

  <p>Tubby sprang to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Larry," he began, "you had no right to say that, you
  know&mdash;about staying on here, I mean. We agreed this morning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Larry cut him short.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Tubby, don't start walking about again. It's trying for
  all of us, but we can't all keep dancing about the place, and it's time you
  stuck to a chair and gave Mark and me a chance."</p>

  <p>He rose, pushed Tubby into a seat, and himself began pacing the room.</p>

  <p>"Look here, you fellows," he said. "I've been thinking things over, and
  I've a suggestion to make. I told you a week ago, didn't I, that I'd a better
  reason for putting Creet out than either of you? That was true, and if things
  had been arranged the way I wanted them arranged, I'd have done the job and
  you two wouldn't have been mixed up in it at all. That's one point."</p>

  <p>"It's a damned bad one," said Mark. "But carry on."</p>

  <p>"And the next point," continued Larry, "is that it was I who first
  suggested that the only way out of our troubles was to put a bullet into
  Creet. If I hadn't suggested it, you two fellows would never have thought of
  it. That's a good point, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Speaking for myself," said Tubby, "I'd been thinking of it ever since he
  refused to sign the contract. Look here, Larry, old boy, I know what you're
  getting at, but you made an arrangement with us this morning, and you've got
  to stick to it."</p>

  <p>Larry ignored that.</p>

  <p>"The next point," he went on, "is that if anybody is to get into a mess
  over this business, I stand to lose less by it than either of you two. Shut
  up, Tubby, and wait until I've finished. I'm a free agent. Whatever happens
  to me, there's nobody to care a hang. But you're different. Tubby has Bunty
  to think of, and when a man has a wife he's not a free agent. He's bound to
  take her into his calculations, and if one of us is to own up to plugging
  Creet, Tubby has less right to do it than any of us."</p>

  <p>Tubby shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Absolute rot, old boy," he said.</p>

  <p>"Much the same applies to Mark," said Larry. "He's a secretive old devil,
  but there's a girl in the background somewhere. He's had a whole lot of
  letters in a feminine handwriting, anyway, and has never torn one of them up,
  and that's pretty convincing evidence against him. That being so, he's got to
  take that girl into his calculations, and that definitely rules him out.</p>

  <p>"Therefore," said Mark, "by a process of exhaustion we arrive at the
  conclusion that the only one of us who has the least right to say he shot
  Creet is Mr. Larry Deans. Shall I punch his head, Tubby, or will you?"</p>

  <p>"Rot, old boy!" said Tubby. "Besides, you can't keep chopping and changing
  about. We fixed this up this morning, and we'll stick to what we said."</p>

  <p>"Moreover," added Mark, "I could put up a very convincing case, Larry,
  that in handing myself over to the hangman I should be doing the girl in the
  background a far better turn than by condemning her to have breakfast with me
  every morning for the rest of her life."</p>

  <p>"I was talking seriously, Mark."</p>

  <p>Mark grinned.</p>

  <p>"Forgive the comment," he said, "but Tubby and I are inclined to think
  that you were talking pretty average rot."</p>

  <p>"In any case," announced Tubby, "I'm not agreeing. You can go on talking
  if you like, Larry, but I'm sticking to what we said."</p>

  <p>"By a majority of two to one, Larry," said Mark, "your motion is
  defeated."</p>

  <p>"Righto!" shrugged Larry. "Then we'll draw for it."</p>

  <p>"We'll do nothing of the sort," exploded Tubby. "Good Lord, Larry, cut it
  out! I've had enough of drawing to last me a lifetime."</p>

  <p>"I disapprove of lotteries," said Mark. "They're illegal."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, for heaven's sake, let's do something, then," exclaimed Larry
  irritably. "All this hanging about and doing nothing but stare at our feet
  and look as if we'd pinched a penny out of a blind man's tin&mdash;it's
  enough to drive a chap crazy. There's the dickens of a time yet before
  tomorrow morning. Can't you recite something, Tubby? No, on second thoughts,
  there'd be another murder if you did that."</p>

  <p>"This is the first time I've ever watched the time pass and not been able
  to fill it in," sighed Tubby. "Just watching the damned hands go round!"</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with cheating time with a game of poker?" asked Mark.</p>

  <p>Larry shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not with Tubby," he said. "It's like picking a kid's pocket. You can know
  every card in his hand by looking at his face. Nap, if you
  like&mdash;solo&mdash;anything as long as we do something. Come on, Tubby!
  We're all rich men now, so for the first time in our lives we'll play for
  tenners. I've got some cards in my room&mdash;the famous green pack that sent
  Louis to hell. I found them in my coat pocket yesterday. Find a table, one of
  you, and I'll fetch them."</p>

  <p>He went striding from the room; and when, a few moments later, he
  returned, the card table was open and Mark and Tubby were seated at it. Larry
  joined them and began shuffling the cards.</p>

  <p>"What's it to be&mdash;Nap?"</p>

  <p>They nodded.</p>

  <p>"Tenners," he said, and placed the pack on the table. "Cut, Tubby."</p>

  <p>Tubby, however, did not cut immediately. He leaned forward and stared at
  the cards, his lips twisted into a rather wry smile.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, Tubby?" asked Mark.</p>

  <p>"I'm just thinking," replied Tubby, still gazing at the cards in front of
  him. "It just struck me that after all the doctor was right. About the
  colour, I mean. If you remember, he said green was an unlucky colour</p>

  <p>"Cut, Tubby," said Larry shortly.</p>

  <p>They cut; Larry dealt; and then, just as they picked up their hands, the
  door was opened and Dr. Thurston came briskly into the room.</p>

  <p>"Thank heaven for motorcars!" he said. "I don't wish the fellow any harm,
  but the sooner that pilot breaks his neck the better for the future of
  flying."</p>

  <p>"Gin?" grinned Larry.</p>

  <p>"Ran out of juice," said the doctor, "and half shook the life out of me
  landing. We very nearly turned turtle, but the fellow only smiled. Apparently
  he's used to it."</p>

  <p>He stood, his hands thrust into the pockets of his coat, scanning their
  faces.</p>

  <p>"What's the game?" he asked, with a nod towards the table.</p>

  <p>"Nap," said Larry. "Care to join in?"</p>

  <p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm for something to eat," he said. "I'm famished. And after that pilot I
  fancy I'm entitled to a drink. I'll join you when I've fed."</p>

  <p>He turned to go and then paused.</p>

  <p>"In the meantime," he said, "if you're playing Nap, you'll probably be
  glad to have&mdash;that."</p>

  <p>His hand was withdrawn from his pocket and tossed a crumpled green-backed
  card face downwards on the table.</p>

  <p>"It's a bit dishevelled," he added, "I've had it in my pocket for a
  week."</p>

  <p>The three men glanced at him&mdash;three pairs of eyes surprised, puzzled,
  inquiring; and then Larry's hand shot out, seized the card, and turned it
  quickly over.</p>

  <p>It was the ace of spades!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For several tense seconds they sat motionless, gazing at the
  crumpled card; and then suddenly Tubby was on his feet.</p>

  <p>"Doctor," he began excitedly, "you don't mean that&mdash;that all the
  time... Hang it, Larry, you see what this means, don't you? If that card's
  been in the doctor's pocket&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Steady, Tubby!" laughed Dr. Thurston. "The trouble with you fellows is
  you're not accustomed to verandas, or it may be that after a year in the
  forest with nobody within earshot you've developed a habit of shouting at one
  another. Anyway, you were talking pretty loudly out there that morning when I
  was in the lounge. I couldn't help overhearing your plan for deciding who was
  to&mdash;buy the cigarettes. All things considered, I wasn't surprised, and I
  couldn't bring myself to blame you, but at the same time I couldn't bring
  myself to let you run that sort of risk."</p>

  <p>He paused, smiling reflectively.</p>

  <p>"It just goes to show," he went on, "that when people say that good can't
  come out of evil they're talking nonsense. It must be a terribly evil thing
  to scrounge two packs of cards off a liner, yet if I hadn't scrounged two
  packs&mdash;if, for instance, I'd only scrounged one pack&mdash;there's no
  knowing what trouble might have followed. Louis, I haven't the least doubt,
  would now be dead just the same, and in addition one of you three fellows
  would have been in a pretty tight corner, so I reckon there's a balance of
  good, anyway."</p>

  <p>"But look here, Doctor " began Tubby.</p>

  <p>The doctor raised his hand.</p>

  <p>"One moment, please, Tubby. Let me finish, and then you can say what you
  like. As it was, I was able, since I had two packs, to take the ace of spades
  from the pack I gave you and substitute the two of diamonds from the other
  pack. I placed the two deuces of diamonds together so that there was no
  chance of them both falling to the same hand and giving the game away."</p>

  <p>"Then you mean. Doctor," exclaimed Tubby, "that old
  Larry&mdash;Mark&mdash;none of us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The doctor nodded.</p>

  <p>"None of you, thank God!" he said. "Louis Creet died&mdash;by other
  means."</p>

  <p>Tubby sank into his chair, rested his elbows on the table, and covered his
  face with his hands. The doctor laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"An interfering old fool, eh, Tubby?" he said. "But you must try to
  forgive me, I couldn't have one of you chaps in trouble over a swine like
  Creet. And now"&mdash;turning to go&mdash;"I'm going to scrounge something to
  eat."</p>

  <p>"Just a moment. Doctor," said Larry. "Somebody shot Louis. If none of us
  did it, who did?"</p>

  <p>The doctor's face was grave.</p>

  <p>"Creet shot himself," he said.</p>

  <p>Larry's eyes searched his.</p>

  <p>"You think the authorities will believe that?"</p>

  <p>"They do believe it," replied Dr. Thurston. "I saw the governor at St.
  Paul today. As a matter of fact, I saw the governor, the deputy governor, the
  minister of justice, the minister of health, and all their secretaries and
  deputy secretaries and assistant deputy secretaries. I was rather
  disappointed at not being introduced to the shorthand typists. I also saw an
  English doctor&mdash;the only one of the whole lot who really mattered. A
  chat with him and the whole thing was soon settled. It's definitely accepted
  as a case of suicide. You'll hear no more about it, and if you feel like
  sailing for England by the next boat there's no one in Portuguese West Africa
  who wants to stop you."</p>

  <p>Larry nodded.</p>

  <p>"Very clever, Doctor," he said. "But you must have forgotten to mention
  two important points at St. Paul&mdash;that Jacqueline distinctly saw
  somebody disappearing onto the veranda as she entered the room, and that, if
  it was a case of suicide, it was rather peculiar that no weapon was found. If
  Louis shot himself, what became of the revolver?"</p>

  <p>The doctor smiled.</p>

  <p>"No, I mentioned both points, Larry," he said. "I told them the
  truth&mdash;that the figure Jackie saw was myself, and that no revolver was
  found because I had already taken it away."</p>

  <p>He saw Larry's quick movement of surprise and smiled. It was an
  achievement to startle Larry.</p>

  <p>"I hadn't gone to bed,"" he explained, "when the shot was fired, and
  within a few seconds I was in the room&mdash;well ahead of any of the rest of
  you&mdash;and the first thing I noticed was that the revolver grasped in
  Louis's hand was the one I'd given to Jackie for this trip. I couldn't
  imagine then how he had got hold of it, but I discovered afterwards that
  Jackie had left it on her dressing table, and Louis, presumably, passing
  along the veranda, had seen it and helped himself to it. There's a French
  window to the veranda, you know, and as Jackie often left it open, that was
  no doubt the explanation."</p>

  <p>Larry nodded.</p>

  <p>"And not wishing Jackie to be mixed up in the affair," added the doctor,
  "I took the revolver, slipped it into my pocket, and just got away via the
  veranda as someone entered the room. Apparently it was Jackie, and she just
  caught sight of me. She came to me later and told me that her revolver was
  missing, but I sent her back to make a thorough search of her room and she
  found it in her cabin trunk. As a matter of fact, I'd cleaned it and reloaded
  it and put it there&mdash;the next morning&mdash;just before breakfast, after
  she'd left her room. But I don't want Jackie to know that. I've been hoping
  all along that the police would decide it was suicide without my having to
  say anything. I didn't want Jackie mixed up in the affair if I could avoid
  it&mdash;especially if it was going to be a case of murder, and if I'd said a
  word she'd have been in it up to the neck."</p>

  <p>"And that's that, Larry," said Mark. "So it really was suicide, eh,
  Doctor? I wonder why Creet did a thing like that."</p>

  <p>"As a compendium of interesting facts, Mark, I can supply the answer to
  that question," said Dr. Thurston. "There's no need now for professional
  secrecy. Louis had been playing with the idea of a medical examination for
  months, and that morning, after the little affair of the night before, he
  actually nerved himself to face the ordeal. He always had a sneaking fear
  there was something seriously wrong with him, and when I'd had a look at him
  it was my job to tell him he was right. He had cancer."</p>

  <p>"Poor devil!" muttered Tubby.</p>

  <p>"I told him that at the most he had only a few months to run, and that if
  he underwent an operation he'd be facing a good deal of pain and a fair
  certainty of not pulling through it. He took it pretty badly&mdash;far worse
  than I'd expected&mdash;put away a whole bottle of whisky in about twenty
  minutes and behaved like a madman. I had no end of a job to quieten him down.
  There's the answer to your question, Mark. Creet wasn't the first man with
  cancer to prefer a bullet. Still, it's over and we'll try to forget it.
  What's the programme now?"</p>

  <p>Tubby jumped up.</p>

  <p>"I say. Doctor, this is marvellous, you know," he exclaimed. "I mean,
  after all this time&mdash;thinking one of us three&mdash;oh, well, you know
  what I mean, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Without making a speech about it&mdash;thanks, Doctor," said Mark.</p>

  <p>"And I'll tell you what I'm going to do," added Tubby excitedly. "There's
  a boat tomorrow, and I'm catching it. I'm going straight off now to pack my
  things."</p>

  <p>He went striding across the room, and Mark rose and followed him.</p>

  <p>"Catching the boat, too, Mark?" asked Larry. "There's no reason why you
  shouldn't. I'm staying on here anyway and can carry on until you get
  back."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I will," said Mark. "But the urgent need of the moment is to tell
  someone I'm probably a millionaire." He smiled at Larry. "I think I'll drop a
  note," he said, "to the girl in the background."</p>

  <p>As the door closed behind them, Larry rose and stood looking at the doctor
  with amused eyes.</p>

  <p>"You're a bad liar. Doctor," he said.</p>

  <p>The doctor raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow you, Larry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Louis wasn't as bad as that. Why did you tell him he was going to die,
  Jackie?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston's face grew grave.</p>

  <p>"So you've guessed, eh, Larry? I wasn't afraid of the others, but I feared
  you might." He laid a hand on Larry's arm. "I've not had a happy time,
  Larry," he said. "You understand, I know. I took the simplest way with Creet.
  I thought I knew him well enough. I banked on his doing&mdash;well, just what
  he did. If he hadn't&mdash;" He hesitated. "Yes, there'd have been no other
  way. If he hadn't done it, Larry, I was going to shoot him. I'd have been
  ready to answer to God for killing Louis Creet."</p>

  <p>Larry nodded, turned, and went towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Larry!"</p>

  <p>The doctor was absently turning over the cards on the table.</p>

  <p>"About&mdash;about Jackie. You realize that it was not her fault&mdash;she
  played the game&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Larry gave him a reassuring smile.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, Doctor," he said. "I'm going to look for Jackie now."</p>

  <p>He found her in the garden, bathing, she told him, in the moonlight, and
  slipped his arm through hers.</p>

  <p>"The doctor's back," he said. "The authorities are satisfied that Louis
  shot himself, and there's no reason for hanging about any longer. Mark and
  Tubby are catching the boat tomorrow, and I suppose you'll all go together.
  I'm staying out here for a bit."</p>

  <p>"Alone, Larry?"</p>

  <p>"That depends, Jackie&mdash;on you. I couldn't start talking until I knew
  where I was over Louis and the mine and all the rest of it, but it's plain
  sailing now and I can talk. I want you to stay out here and marry me."</p>

  <p>For an instant her arm pressed his against her side, and then she withdrew
  it and faced him gravely.</p>

  <p>"Why, Larry?"</p>

  <p>"Because I love you. It's commonplace as a reason, but it happens to be
  true."</p>

  <p>"It's not because you want to&mdash;to be kind to a poor, pathetic little
  Magdalene?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"And in spite of&mdash;everything?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, what rot you talk!" exclaimed Larry.</p>

  <p>"When a man loves a girl he doesn't love her in spite of anything; he
  loves her because of everything&mdash;everything she has ever been or done or
  thought or felt&mdash;everything that has made her just what she is. That's
  how I love you. There's no need to argue about it, is there?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, smiling.</p>

  <p>"No need at all, Larry," she said.</p>

  <p>Dr. Thurston was standing at the window of the bedroom.</p>

  <p>"Are you awake, my dear?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston's voice, muffled by the bedclothes, assured him that she was
  wide awake.</p>

  <p>"I've been telling you," said the doctor, "that everything's all right and
  we can catch a boat tomorrow if you want to. Mark and Tubby will be going,
  and the four of us may as well go together,"</p>

  <p>"Four of us, John?"</p>

  <p>"You, Mark, Tubby, and I. Larry stays behind for a bit."</p>

  <p>"But there's Jackie."</p>

  <p>The doctor smiled, gazing out of the window.</p>

  <p>"I don't fancy Jackie will be going, my dear," he said. "She's out there
  in the garden now&mdash;with Larry."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston sat bolt upright in bed.</p>

  <p>"John&mdash;do you really think?"</p>

  <p>"He's kissing her, anyway." He turned from the window. "I think we can
  call that a deal, my dear. I wonder if the shipping people would transfer
  Jackie's ticket to Mark or Tubby."</p>

  <p>"Such a saving if they would, John. But are you quite sure?"</p>

  <p>The doctor waved a hand towards the window.</p>

  <p>"Judge for yourself," he laughed.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Thurston sank back on her pillow with a little sigh of
  contentment.</p>

  <p>"Such a dear boy," she murmured sleepily. "But I do hope he'll be nice to
  the parson."</p>
