  <p class="first">I STOPPED my car before the gates to admire the little
  house. It is one of those picturesque old places that are all angles and
  gables. And there are high poplars and beautifully trimmed hoi hedges and a
  velvety little lawn as smooth as a billiard table.</p>

  <p>In summertime there are flowers, gold and scarlet and blue, in the wide
  beds fringing the lawn&mdash;now one must be content with the green symmetry
  of box and laurel and the patch of deep red which marks Molly's
  chrysanthemums. Behind the house is a very serious vegetable garden and a
  field where chickens stalk. And an orchard&mdash;about two acres in all.</p>

  <p>Such a house and grounds as you might buy for some twenty-five hundred or
  three thousand pounds. Perhaps cheaper, for it lies away from railways and is
  off the main road. Town folk would call it lonely, though it is entitled to
  describe itself as being on the fringe of the London area.</p>

  <p>Somebody lives here (you would say if you did not know) with a comfortable
  income. A snug place&mdash;the tiny week-end home of some stockbroker who
  does not want the bother and expense of the upkeep of a more pretentious
  demesne.</p>

  <p>There was no need to ask the owner of the cottage that nearly faces the
  oaken gates, because I am in the fullest possession of all the necessary
  facts.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. F&mdash; lives there. Oh, yes, she's lived there for years. She's a
  lady... I don't know anything about other people's business, mister."</p>

  <p>This latter in a manner that is both suspicious and resentful. If Mrs.
  F&mdash; were immensely rich, our cottager would advertise her splendours;
  reticence he would not know. Mrs. F&mdash; isn't rich. She's immensely
  poor.</p>

  <p>Molly, who met me halfway across the lawn, put the matter in a phrase. "We
  are 'The-Crashed,'" said Molly definitely, "and we try not to be Poor Brave
  Things&mdash;Poor Brave Things get on Mummie's nerves. Mrs. G&mdash; is a
  poor brave thing, and writes to the newspapers about it&mdash;well perhaps
  she doesn't exactly write to the newspapers, but she sort of gets her name in
  as the officer's widow who is beginning all over again to build her
  war-shattered fortune by designing furniture."</p>

  <p>Molly is fourteen, and at Cheltenham. The bare fact of the "crash" and its
  cause are recorded, on one of the many memorials that one passes at
  crossroads on the way to the races.</p>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">To the Glory of God<br>
  and the Memory of<br>
  the following Officers,<br>
  Non-Commissioned Officers<br>
  and Men of the<br>
  Royal Blankshire Regiment,<br>
  who fell in the Great War.</p><br>

  <p>Molly's father got his majority in June, 1914&mdash;I forget to what,
  pension his widow, is entitled under the Royal Warrant. He left a small house
  in Berkshire that needed a lot of repairs, an old car that he had bought
  secondhand, a couple of hunters, a lot of odd dogs, and four
  children&mdash;three girls and a boy.</p>

  <p>Oh, yes, and (as Molly reminds me) four hundred shares in Somethingfontein
  Deeps.</p>

  <p>He, was killed early in the war, before he had time to save money, and
  everybody was terribly sympathetic, especially about Molly, "who was three,
  or some ridiculous age.</p>

  <p>Molly's mother had some well-off relations&mdash;not rich, but people who
  kept two or three gardeners and had a flat in town. So there was a family
  council, and everybody agreed that the small house in the country should be
  sold, and Molly's mother should take an even smaller house. Family councils
  of this kind always advise selling the house and getting something smaller.
  Happily, nobody wanted to buy the little mansion unless big repairs were
  effected, and electric light put in and parquet flooring and running water in
  every room, and all that sort of thing. Molly's mother worked it all out,on a
  piece of paper when the children were in bed, and discovered that the repairs
  would cost a little more than the house would fetch, in the open market. So
  she elected to stay on. She had one maid, who refused to leave her, and a
  gardener so deaf that he couldn't be told that his services were dispensed
  with.</p>

  <p>Molly's mother had two hundred a year to live on and four children to
  educate.</p>

  <p>"Mother decided to breed rabbits, which are notoriously prolific," said
  Molly. "It was the only poor brave thing she did. But she got terribly self-
  conscious about them, and confined herself to chickens&mdash;which are
  natural. Anybody can keep chickens without it getting into-the papers. She
  did try hard to write love stories, but she said they made her sick. I read
  one the other day, and it made me sick, too. Mrs. Griffel, who has the
  cottage down the road, was another war widow. Lord L&mdash;, who owns most of
  the land round here, gave her the cottage, and she has two tons of coal and
  all sorts of things. Nobody gave us anything, because, we were supposed to be
  gentry. I asked Mummie if she would have taken two tons of coal, and Mummie
  said, 'Like a shot!' But nobody offered, and we had one fire going besides
  the kitchen for years. It was terribly cold in the winters."</p>

  <p>Education was an important matter. Tom had to go to Rugby, because Molly's
  father went to Rugby. The well-off relations helped, though their prosperity
  was diminishing with the years. The richest and most generous was a
  shareholder in certain coal mines, and dividends began to flutter like a bad
  pulse.</p>

  <p>There was no question of "keeping up appearances." Molly's mother didn't
  care tuppence who knew of her poverty. She used to journey on a push bike
  every Saturday to Reading to buy in the cheapest market. And this small,
  sharp-featured lady was a terrible bargainer. She is not
  pretty&mdash;wholesome, but hot pretty. She cast no sad, appealing glance at
  susceptible butchers; she quoted glibly wholesale prices, and grew acrid when
  frozen mutton was offered in the guise of Southdown.</p>

  <p>There was some help for Tom at Rugby&mdash;either an inadequate Government
  grant or a scholarship. One of the girls had only a year to stay at school
  when the crash came. Molly's elder sister began her education at a moment
  when coal mines were paying concerns&mdash;Molly was unfortunate in beginning
  her first term at Cheltenham under the cloud of an industrial crisis.</p>

  <p>The two hundred a year has remained two hundred, but Molly's mother has
  performed miracles. Tom is at Woolwich, and Molly is at Cheltenham. God knows
  how she balances her budget, and what fierce and urgent appeals to the
  well-to-do relatives are slipped into the letter-box at the end of the lane.
  She does what cannot be done&mdash;adds two and two and makes it six.</p>

  <p>I suspect Molly knows&mdash;she is so insistent upon that one point they
  are not Poor Brave Things.</p>

  <p>"Getting married is going to be the bother." Molly was terribly, serious.
  "We're all so devilishly plain" (she uses this kind of language occasionally)
  "and unfortunately none of us is romantic&mdash;I mean we don't want be
  nurses or go on the stage or do anything eccentric. The great point is, as
  Mummie says, we must get used to the idea that we're the crashed generation,
  and we've got to sit tight and wipe ourselves out and work for the next. And
  Mummie says that there are hundreds and thousands of us, and we're jolly
  lucky to have a house and not live in lodgings, Tom thought he ought not to
  go into the Army because of the awful expense, but that's all rot. Mummie
  says that ashes without a Phoenix are just dirt."</p>

  <p>Molly's mother is only one of the crashed, as she says. But for Molly, who
  is rather loquacious, you might never hear of them, because they are most
  awfully scared of attracting attention, or qualifying for admission to the
  Society of Poor Brave Things. Up and down the land, in out-of-the-way
  villages, in obscure lodgings, in very populous suburbs, the regimental
  ladies who crashed are keeping step with Molly's mother.</p>

  Reproduced from <i>The Evening Post</i> (New Zealand), January 22,
  1927</a></h3>

  <p class="first">MY friend the Communist (a very nice man) only knows two
  classes, the Idle Rich and the Proletariat.</p>

  <p>"People without regular jobs." I suggested, having looked it up for
  crossword purposes.</p>

  <p>No, he meant "Proletariat."</p>

  <p>"Wage earners?"</p>

  <p>No, he still meant "Proletariat," but what that meant he wasn't quite
  sure.</p>

  <p>"Karl Marx&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He beamed.</p>

  <p>"That's the fellow&mdash;what he says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wage labourers&mdash;wage earners," said I. "Only the people who work for
  a living are the proletariat."</p>

  <p>My friend was rather depressed by this narrow interpretation of his grand
  word.. Anyway (here he brightened) the Idle Rich were, not to be explained
  away by the dictionary.</p>

  <p>"Look at 'em! Any night you like in the West End! Motor-cars, fal-de-
  lals, wimmin, wine!"</p>

  <p>"And song," I helped him, but he was not grateful.</p>

  <p>"Go down to the Savoy any night you like," he stormed. "I've heard 'em on
  the wireless, laughing and clapping their hands for more music. And I've seen
  'em through the windows at other places, sitting at tables and drinking
  wine&mdash; the price of every bottle would keep a family from starvation for
  a week! And outside on the Embankment, people without a shelter to their
  heads or a crust to eat. That's what is going to bring about the
  revolution!"</p>

  <p>Because I am interested in revolutions I went to the cradle of the coming
  upheaval.</p>

  <p>I do not know a nicer cradle or a more cheerful-sounding. To hear it all
  on the wireless is one thing, to be a participator is another.</p>

  <p>The buzz and blare of the ballroom is not so noticeable as through the
  microphone. You scarcely hear the tuning of fiddles or the twink-twank of an
  absent-minded thumb on a banjo string. These things fit into a larger
  sensation&mdash; shaded lights and amber candelabras and the glitter and
  gleam of silver on white tables, and flowers and white-shirted diners, and
  beautiful women, and women who hope they are looking that way. The idle rich
  were having a most strenuous time.</p>

  <p>The last time I met the idle rich youth who grinned at me from the next
  table was somewhere between the Baldock and Stevenage. He had come down from
  Cambridge, driving an awful-looking little car that he had wheedled from his
  idle rich father (one of those wealthy suffragan bishops who earn nearly £800
  a year), and he begged from me the price of a two-gallon tin of juice. He had
  only a shilling in his pocket; his term allowance of £10 having been
  squandered in the riotous pursuit of pleasure and those hectic gaieties which
  are such a deplorable feature of University life.</p>

  <p>He told me later that he had been invited to dinner by a topping fellow
  (the father of another undergraduate), that he was having a topping time. The
  topping fellow who invited him (a largish man with a cherubic smile) was
  another of the idle rich. He was an official of a big engineering company and
  spent most of his life sleeping on trains and interviewing hardfaced men who
  bought machinery. When he wasn't sleeping on trains he was sleeping on ships
  hound for foreign parts, or sleeping on ships bound for home. His wife
  manages to see him for two months in the year.</p>

  <p>He doesn't dance, but he likes to see the young people enjoy themselves.
  There is wine on his table. Every magnum represents more than the fortnight's
  salary he received when he started work with the company he now controls. He
  sits a little dazed, a little absent, his mind completely occupied with
  centrifugal pumps and machine-tools, watching the brilliant throng gyrating
  to the rhythm of the band. The beautiful women in their indescribable
  dresses, the chameleon changes of hues, the subtle fragrances which come to
  nostrils used to the scent of lubricating oils and hot metals.</p>

  <p>I like to reduce things to table form: pages of statistics fascinate me.
  Here is a census of the known idle rich within view:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="note">(1) A retired tea planter from Assam. Age about 50. Very
  rich. He had ten years of heart-breaking labour, rising at dawn, working in
  the plantation all day, and sleeping in a little bungalow a trifle larger
  than a suburban summer house by night. Worked like a navvy, seven days a
  week, and took no holiday during the first years of his apprenticeship. Paced
  season after season of disappointment and partial failure till the luck
  turned. Now he is home and trying to recover the wasted years.</p>

  <p class="note">(2) A director of a big newspaper combine. The most cheerful
  soul that ever came from Scotland. Spent his early married life in a
  one-roomed lodging, denied himself more than the bare necessities to ensure
  against unemployment; employed his spare hours in work.</p>

  <p class="note">(3) A rather imposing man who looks like a Cabinet Minister.
  A gossip writer in one of the newspapers. A hard-working and not particularly
  brilliant man, who is earning his living at this moment.</p>

  <p class="note">(4) A theatrical "magnate" who once peddled shoelaces in New
  York.</p>

  <p class="note">(5) The son of an impoverished Irish peer, wounded in the
  war, and himself working in a city office.</p>

  <p class="note">(6) A millionaire distiller who battled up from 6s a week
  clerkship, and who in the evening, of life, finds his chief pleasure in
  watching young people enjoying the life he was denied.</p>

  <p>It is impossible that the census could be complete. Idle rich? I know a
  few. By some mysterious, wise workings of Nature, rust and rot go together,
  and one looks for the idle rich in queer places where nice people do not go.
  They run to poetry of an exotic kind and to strange friendships. Some write
  nasty little plays. Mostly they live on the association of nasty little
  people, and move in a cloud of sycophants and parasites. One reads regularly
  of their doings in gossip paragraphs&mdash;there is one writer who
  specialises in such a chronicle. Now. they are on the Lido, extravagantly
  costumed or engaged in lunatic games; now they are at Deauville; now doing
  something extraordinary or bizarre in London itself. They have Baby Parties,
  where they array themselves in the costumes of childhood, or Treasure Hunts,
  or officiate at mysterious gatherings. You never see them on a race-course or
  in the hunting field. They may appear at St. Moritz or in ten costumes per
  diem, but they do nothing more exciting than pose for their photographs.</p>

  <p>And in due course they die, and their estates are divided amongst their
  wholesome relatives, and that is the end of them.</p>

  <p>But this Savoy ballroom belongs to youth, gilded but not golden; wearing
  the uniform of affluence, but no more. Money doesn't worry the subaltern down
  for a short leave. He isn't giving the party, but he is the soul of it. He
  asks for nothing more than a pretty partner, a syncopated jig-tune, perfectly
  timed, and his. enjoyment is in ratio to his partner's dancing ability.</p>

  <p>He is young and good-looking, fresh-faced, bubbling over with energy. He
  has no money, and doesn't want much. He needs for the moment a perfectly
  topping time. Good wine is wasted on him. He can never remember the menu. He
  would as soon drink lemonade. He has not learnt to call things and people
  "divine." Mostly he talks about cars&mdash;fast, ugly, uncomfortable
  cars&mdash;but fast.</p>

  <p>He may not be in the Army or the Navy. Perhaps he is in the motorcar
  business, which has an irresistible fascination for youth. Or in an office.
  You know that he is "public school" from the moment that you hear him
  speak&mdash;it really does not matter whether he is soldiering or selling
  buttons.</p>

  <p>There is a waiter at the Savoy who is a great friend of mine; we have this
  bond of union, that we went to the same school, and he knows more about the
  idle rich than any man in London.</p>

  <p>"Is there anybody here who does nothing for a living?" I asked. He knew a
  man from the Argentine and another from France who had no occupation but
  dancing.</p>

  <p>"But English?"</p>

  <p>He took a careful survey of the room. It must have been an off night for
  the idle rich, since he could; only; distinguish one man.</p>

  <p>"And <i>he's</i> a member of Parliament!" he said, almost
  apologetically.</p>

  <p class="first">HE isn't a tramp. He very seldom leaves the West End and
  never goes out of London. He is very unwashed and wears two overcoats, and I
  have never seen him begging. Shuffling along by the edge of the pavement, his
  downcast eyes seeking a cigarette-end, he would be an object of pity, if
  compassion could overcome nausea.</p>

  <p>The women of his species you can find any afternoon or evening, sleeping
  in the doorway recesses of West End theatres. Why she chooses theatres nobody

  clothes and disinfectants; but they have gone back to The Life and the two
  overcoats and the gallery entrance of St. Martin's Lane.</p>

  <p>A lady friend of mine who had incited her husband to kill a former lover,
  and was tremendously well known in consequence, once told me that the
  spectacle of the Impossible People was a shame and a disgrace to England.</p>

  <p>"We wouldn't stand for it in New York," she said.</p>

  <p>So you see how badly we compare with New York, and even Chicago, which has
  two murders a day, but no Impossible People. Because they wouldn't stand for
  it.</p>

  <p>In warmish weather, when charitable well-to-do folks, their hearts glowing
  with loving kindness and wine, dash down to the Embankment and distribute
  largesse to the submerged, the Impossible People gravitate towards the
  Embankment. They occupy most of the available seats and huddle themselves up
  in odd corners, looking oh, so wretched, and they take their share of what is
  coming.</p>

  <p>In the winter they keep to the brighter, warmer spots, knowing that loving
  kindness doesn't often square with cold feet, and that slumming comes more
  natural on a warm, moonlit night in June than in the icy blasts of December,
  when a north-easter is blowing and horribly cold rain is liable to trickle
  down the necks of vicarious philanthropists.</p>

  <p>I dislike the Impossible People because they are like the small boys who
  are always getting in the way of the photographer who is snapping the genuine
  article.</p>

  <p>There is one called Old Frank, whom I have known for years. This frowsy
  man was old and dirty in 1910. He has slept out of doors ever since (except
  for a month he spent in Pentonville), and soap advertisements are meaningless
  to him There he is&mdash;a shuffling old body with his three waistcoats and
  cardigan jacket, alive and fit. There has been a war. Thousands of men have
  passed in their prime. Millionaires and princes, with all the resources of
  medicine and surgery at their command, have been gathered to their fathers.
  Old Frank, who sleeps in the oddest corners, and garners his meals in
  unbelievable places, is prime and hearty.</p>

  <p>I have only given him one penny in my life. He remembers the circumstance
  vividly. He also remembers all the air raids.</p>

  <p>"Frank, there is only one remedy for you,&mdash;and that is a lethal
  chamber," I told him when I met him a few nights ago.</p>

  <p>He was not offended.</p>

  <p>"There ain't many of us left now," he said, regretfully. It was as though
  he were speaking of a decaying industry&mdash;you might have imagined that he
  was a flint-knapper or something of the sort.</p>

  <p>He named about thirty impossible people, all males, and could, with an
  effort, have named a hundred.</p>

  <p>He was once a soldier, and got a wandering fit on him when quite a young
  man. He became a tramp in the more noble sense, but the country was too
  lonely, and farmers kept dogs and rural policemen were entirely unsympathetic
  In the country the Vagrancy Act is a real, vital thing. In London it is a
  curiosity. He "did" three weeks in Exeter Prison and three weeks in
  Gloucester, and so he came back to London, where the police are kind. He was
  not sorry for himself, but regretted the passing of two old friends of his,
  one of whom had been knocked down by a motor-omnibus a few months before.</p>

  <p>"These motors oughtn't to be allowed," he considered.</p>

  <p>Unlike his kind, who take an intensive interest in themselves, are
  casually concerned about their fellow-unfortunates, and are wholly oblivious
  of the phenomena of life that appear daily before their eyes, Old Prank is
  sensitive to economic conditions.</p>

  <p>"There's less regulars on the pavement," he said, "but there's more
  outsiders than any time I can remember. They come and go and don't stay long.
  Young fellers, some of 'em, out of work and not used to the road. Gentle
  chaps, clurks, and what not. Some of 'em had good positions,
  too&mdash;orficers in the army. They drift in an' drift, out."</p>

  <p>You can watch the drift if you spend a night at the "Morning Post"
  home&mdash; a place where wretchedness loses for a while some of its
  depressive quality. Here come the pieces that refuse to fit into the jigsaw
  puzzle called Economic Life. Some have lost all shape and belong to the waste
  section that go into the rag-bag. Some are only momentarily lost to place.
  Youngish men, rather bewildered, rather ashamed, by this glaring emphasis of
  their inadequacy.</p>

  <p>They don't exactly know how they got here It is easy to explain, but
  difficult to convince them that such an explanation is a true one.</p>

  <p>I wonder how many people realise the number of wrecks there are that are
  traceable to the coal strike of three years ago? Immediately after that
  strike I edited a hard-luck page for a weekly newspaper, and at least thirty
  per cent, of the men who confessed their ruin traced it directly to that
  strike. Small shopkeepers, like master men, found them.selves one day
  (figuratively) snug and comfortable; the next day they were waiting in a
  queue for admission to a Church Army institute or begging admission to the
  "Morning Post" home.</p>

  <p>Now you find plenty of small tradesmen; you find, too, officers and
  soldiers with a bitter recollection of gratuities ill-spent. Not
  squandered&mdash; just badly spent. They invested their all in business,
  which they knew nothing whatever about. Poultry farms and garages and things
  that seem easy.</p>

  <p>Chess figures carved from bones, as big as a man's fist, and said to date
  back to the tenth century, are now on show in the British Museum.</p>

  Reproduced from <i>The Evening Post</i> (New Zealand), February 12,
  1927</a></h3>

  <p class="first">NOTHING gives Bill a bigger laugh than newspaper articles on
  prison reform. The State started to reform Bill when, as a ragged little
  pickpocket of 12, they sent him to an institution for youthful delinquents. I
  don't know how long he was there, but he went in a clumsy, inept little
  thief, and came out as dexterous an expert as ever picked a pocket or dipped
  a bag.</p>

  <p>Then he became a burglar and a jewel thief (he got his introduction to the
  right kind of mentors when he was in Pentonville); and later he learnt from a
  friend in Dartmoor of the good pickings that could be had by a man of smart
  appearance who hangs around railway stations and picks up momentarily
  neglected suitcases. Bill has a poor opinion of humanity, and his one grim
  jest which never fails to tickle me is that when he meets a funeral he takes
  off his hat and says piously: "Thank Gawd he's going straight!"</p>

  <p>Alec is another burglar: a slim, refined man with an amazing vocabulary
  (he speaks with a very pleasant Scottish accent, and is invariably voluble
  and earnest). He is an office-breaker.</p>

  <p>Joe is known to the police as a ladder larcenist. Of late he has been
  dignified with a new title&mdash;they "call him a cat-burglar. But he is
  still a ladder larcenist, whose job of work it is to enter bedrooms whilst
  the family are at dinner, usually by means of a ladder, lock the door, and,
  clearing off all the available jewellery, make his escape, all within a
  period of ten minutes. The ladder larcenist who takes more than ten minutes
  at his job is regarded as a bungler.</p>

  <p>I don't know whether Bill has ever engaged in ladder larceny, but he
  confesses that at the moment he is too fat. We were talking the other day
  about the possibility of burgling my flat, the difficulty of climbing up into
  my study, which overlooks a busy street, and the almost impossibility of
  opening a safe of a well-known make, in which I keep, if, the truth be told,
  nothing more valuable than the duplicate copies of manuscripts that have gone
  to America, and have not yet been printed. Bill was amused.</p>

  <p>"No man of intelligence would dream of climbing up the front of your
  house," he said. "All he wants is a key blank"&mdash;(I have a patent lock on
  the front door)&mdash;"and I'll show you how he does it."</p>

  <p>He produced a key blank from his pocket, which he swore he kept only as a
  souvenir and not for business, blackened it with a match, inserted it in the
  lock of my door, turned it gently, and then, withdrawing it, showed me the
  marks that had been made on the blackened surface.</p>

  <p>"I could file that key to fit your door in a quarter of an hour," he said.
  "All I've got to do is to step into a telephone box, call you up, and if
  there is no reply&mdash;-which shows that the family are out&mdash;walk
  round, try the key, file it, and be inside your flat under half an hour. As
  to the safe&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>He said insulting things about the safe, and left me with the impression
  that a child of three could overcome that obstacle with a corkscrew.</p>

  <p>I don't know how many times Bill has been in prison. He has been flogged
  for bashing a "screw"; he has been birched for various offences; he has been
  in Dartmoor, in Portland, and Parkhurst, and dislikes them all, but finds
  nothing in the experience calculated to act as a certain deterrent to the
  criminally minded. I call him a burglar, but he isn't really a burglar, for
  he loathes night work and the danger attendant upon breaking into occupied
  premises. Of late years, he tells me, "fencing" has become a well-organised
  business. Mr. Fence is sitting in the saloon bar of a handsome establishment
  at Islington, when there enters, a respectable-looking man known to him.
  Possibly they drink together. After a while Mr. Fence and Mr., Burglar
  adjourn outside. Says the burglar: "I'm going to 'do' a fur store in Wardour
  street. I wish you'd come along, Mr. X, and price it for me."</p>

  <p>"Is it dead or alive?" asks the interested "fence," meaning thereby: "Is
  it a lock-up shop or is it one over which people are living?"</p>

  <p>"It is dead," explains the thief; and the next morning the fence drives
  down to Wardour street strolls into the shop, examines a few of the furs
  offered for sale, and makes a rapid and fairly accurate estimate of the value
  of the shop's contents. That afternoon he meets the burglar, or a friend of
  the burglar's, by appointment; there is a little bargaining, a little
  haggling, and eventually a sum is agreed upon. The contents of that
  unfortunate store have been sold before the burglary is committed. The place
  to which the furs are to be taken is decided upon, and nothing more is left
  than for the crime to be committed, the furs taken away and stored, for the
  thief to receive his price.</p>

  <p>Similarly, whilst your Rolls-Royce is outside your door, there may be a
  car thief and his receiver haggling over its price hours before it is
  "knocked off" and disappears from all human ken, later to find its way to the
  colonies or to India, the latter being a favourite market for stolen
  motor-cars. It may be some satisfaction to you to know that the
  Morris-Cowley, the pride of your house, which vanished mysteriously a year
  ago, is now the favourite vehicle, of a Babu clerk and his bright-eyed family
  somewhere around Lahore.</p>

  <p>Our burglars arc-considerably more attractive than, say, the American
  variety.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever carried a gun, Bill? I asked, and he was genuinely
  shocked.</p>

  <p>"Good God, no!" he said. "What do you want a gun for? If you want to
  commit murder, go out and commit it. If you want to be a burglar, be a
  burglar. No policeman is going to be afraid of a gun. You've either got to
  kill him or he'll get you. Besides, these men are doing their duty. When a
  lag says, 'I'd sooner be hung than go back to prison,' there's nothing to
  stop him hanging himself is there?" His own theory is that shootings are
  prevalent in America because the police carry pistols.</p>

  <p>"When you hear of mail vans being held up, or post offices, by people with
  revolvers, you can bet that the chaps who do the job are amachers."</p>

  <p>Individual burglary is not a thriving trade in these days. There are two
  or three little confederations responsible for most of the more startling
  robberies, and these, according to Bill, owe their immunity to their perfect
  organisation. They'll take, a year to plan a real big job, and very likely
  get one of their own people inside the premises six months before they bust
  the place. They have tools worth hundreds of pounds, and work to a
  time-table. Generally they're foreigners, who go around the Continent between
  busts."</p>

  <p>The day of the old burglar, with his dark lantern, his bit of candle, and
  his simple jemmy, has passed. This is the age of the specialist; and although
  there may be a sprinkle of old-timers, who are prepared to take the risk of a
  "bust" with little or no preliminary investigation, they are seldom
  successful.</p>

  <p>"It's just as hard to burgle a country house as it is to get into a bank
  nowadays," said Bill. "And, anyway, silver doesn't pay for stealing. Most of
  the big jobs you read about are done at country houses by somebody inside. An
  old lag gets a job as butler or chauffeur, and waits till he finds something
  worth taking before he skips. In fact, there are more of this kind of crime
  nowadays than actual burglaries."</p>

  <p>He tells me there is a class of "workman" who specialises in dressmakers'
  shops, and, curiously enough, not the great establishments, but the smaller,
  struggling fry.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't pay," he said, "but they're satisfied with a few pounds for a
  night's work, and the job's a pretty easy one if you know anything about the
  beats, when the police are likely to be around.</p>

  <p>"Generally speaking," summarised Bill a little despairingly, "the game's
  never been so bad as it is to-day. When I was a boy, almost every house had a
  box hidden somewhere, and you were pretty sure of finding money in it.
  Tradesmen especially. Nowadays people have banks and cheque books."</p>

  <p>A cheque book, by the way, is regarded by most burglars as a valuable
  acquisition. A man who specialises in the stealing of cheque books told me
  once that a packet of Bank of England "kites" (cheques) would always fetch
  £20 from a fence. He sells them to the members of the well-dressed mobs that
  haunt the West End, and these in turn, make big profits by inducing
  simple-minded tradesmen to cash big cheques after banking hours. But that is
  another graft. Bill is emphatic on only one point&mdash; that burglary is not
  what it used to be.</p>

  <p>Small boys without tummy pains are not quite natural. Especially in that
  month of the year when the orchard is a place of greenish apples spuriously
  rouged. But in November... and when passing under rapid review all that was
  of his dietary on the previous day without, detecting anything more ache-
  compelling than Vitamin A...</p>

  <p>It isn't right. So you ask for a history of this disagreeable pain that
  makes a small boy inclined to double up like a jack-knife.</p>

  <p>And, of course, he is drawlingly vague. Last year? Oh, yes, but really not
  bad; a sort of... you know.</p>

  <p>Once he remembered, when he was in Caux, just a funny sort of ache that
  went on and on. I remembered, too sitting on the edge of his bed, the
  temperature 20 below, and the heat turned off. And I lectured him on the
  gluttony of small boys, and the horrid things that happened to them when they
  eat marachino-nougat before going to bed.</p>

  <p>But now it is November. "Does that hurt?" If you press a little boy gently
  to the right of what is euphemistically called his "button," and he winces
  painfully, you call in your family doctor, and after he has asked a lot of
  uncomfortable questions and has done his little bit of pressing, he looks at
  you knowingly and says with diabolical cheerfulness:</p>

  <p>"Well, my boy, you know what that is?"</p>

  <p>And, of course, you do. And when you've adjourned with him to your study
  you ask the inevitable question: "Well, whom shall we get?" And he as
  inevitably replies: "Y-Z."</p>

  <p>You knew all the time he was going to say "Y-Z", but you ask just to make
  him testy. He only gets testy on two subjects&mdash;the suggestion that you
  shouldn't call in "Y-Z" and the unbusinesslike methods of nursing homes.</p>

  <p>All this happens if you are a wise lather or husband. If you're unwise you
  say, a little resentfully: "Can't this thing be cured without an
  operation?... I must think it over for a week."</p>

  <p>If, whilst he is thinking it over the patient dies, he says that the
  doctor "didn't understand the case," or (this is even more popular) "the
  doctor should have seen, this coming months ago."</p>

  <p>For myself, I said: "Y-Z, of course." And at nine Y-Z's handsome limousine
  came to a halt before my humble flat. Y-Z is rather young-looking, a
  leisurely and amusing teller of good stories. Fresh-complexioned,
  longish-nosed (you cannot be very clever if you have a small nose), something
  of an athlete, I should imagine. There is the small boy, rather amused, on
  the bed when Y-Z strolls in, hands in pockets. He is rather engaging, knows
  boys' talk backwards (which is a little more intelligent and purer than man's
  talk), strikes a very high note of confidence.</p>

  <p>Back he strolls to the study, hands in pockets...</p>

  <p>Doesn't seem very bad, but it ought to come out. Going abroad, are you?"
  He shakes his head at this. "It might be all right&mdash;but why sit on a
  bomb?" I agree. When? The doctor, a foreseeing man, as well as the greatest
  G.P. in London, has already booked a room. He confirms this by telephone.
  Y-Z, the surgeon produces his engagement book. It is alarmingly full. "Let
  him go in to-morrow; we'll do it on the next morning. What about ten
  o'clock?"</p>

  <p>The doctor thinks ten is a good time.</p>

  <p>A telephone inquiry. Dr. Z is doing one at ten. The great doctor grows a
  little choleric (he must sound terrible on the telephone). "Most
  unbusinesslike... I told you ten o 'clock."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet he didn't," says Y-Z <i>sotto voce</i>. "</p>

  <p>"...Well, eleven-thirty."</p>

  <p>"That will suit me," says Y-Z.</p>

  <p>It suits everybody. Even the small boy on the bed who is promised
  "treatment"&mdash;that wicked word "operation" is never used. (Next
  afternoon, as a treat, he goes to the cinema&mdash;both of the films have
  operations in them!).</p>

  <p>Have you ever sat in the: waiting-room of a nursing, home and seen the
  cars come up? The anaesthetist, in a little runabout, with his little black
  bag (anaesthetists aren't allowed to have Rolls-Royces), and then the doctor
  with his little black bag, and then the surgeon with his absurdly small
  equipment. Have you heard them foregather in the hall and talk about the
  weather, and that poor old soul who popped off last week?</p>

  <p>"She had a long innings," says somebody cheerfully.</p>

  <p>And then the wait&mdash;eternities until the brisk anaesthetist comes down
  looking awfully pleased with himself.</p>

  <p>Well, that's a relief. He wouldn't be smiling, or discussing outside the
  petrol-eating propensities of American cars with my chauffeur, if the small
  boy had died under the anaesthetic. He would be thinking up a good story for
  the Coroner. (You think things like that when you're in the waiting-room of a
  nursing home.)</p>

  <p>And now the surgeon comes in.</p>

  <p>"I had a bit of a shock."</p>

  <p>He explains in non-technical language the reason for the shock. If the
  operation had been delayed a month&mdash;a week. He spreads out his hands
  expressively. He is saying "Good-bye" to the small boy.</p>

  <p>Later that same small boy is on view propped up by a bed-
  rest&mdash;terribly white, with dark shadows under his big eyes. He is
  drowsy, a little sick, has a pain in his side which he cannot understand, is
  not interested in anything. In three days he will be eating boiled chicken,
  and between proud references to his lost appendix will be devouring the
  exciting stories of Mr. Percy Westerman at the rate of two books a day. That
  little job cost me a hundred guineas&mdash;one hundred guineas for the use of
  those sure, confident hands for a quarter of an hour. It is the cheapest
  service I know.</p>

  <p>Somebody else has the use of those hands to-day. Poor Mrs. Brown who is in
  the Something Hospital. She is literally a washerwoman, and has never seen a
  hundred guineas in her life and never will. Somebody gave her a "letter" to
  the hospital. She also has had queer pains, but the idea of an operation is
  dreadful. All her neighbours put the corner of their aprons to their mouths
  in horror at the thought "It's awful... with all them bits o' boys lookin' at
  you an' practisin' on you, maybe."</p>

  <p>The bits of boys will be looking on just as all young surgeons in the
  making look on, but it will be Y-Z in a white wrapper who will "do it." He
  will talk rather rapidly as he works&mdash;perhaps he will tell stories of
  great surgeons and what they have done; but he will be just as careful, just
  as expeditious, just as considerate as he was with the small boy. And if Sir
  X-0 (whose fee sometimes runs into four figures) is performing the operation
  he will give the washerwoman just as much intensive thought as he gave the
  Duchess when she was being treated in her West End nursing home.</p>

  <p>It would cost the washerwoman nothing.</p>

  <p>The people who pay big money to big surgeons make the least extravagant
  outlay of their lives. They are doing something for Mrs. Brown, too. That is
  the excellence of our system. What he did for Mrs. Brown he did also for her
  boy son in Flanders&mdash;maybe he learnt a lot of his trade there. He has a
  string of letters after his name which suggest military virtue. In queer old
  barns and chateaux, with shells bursting picturesquely and unpleasantly
  close...</p>

  <p>Modern surgery is the most wonderful phenomenon of the age. I say this
  having seen some of the old surgery. It is worth just what life is worth'
  Never be afraid to call in Mr. Y-Z or Sir X-O or Mr. Z-X. That is, if you
  want to live.</p>

  <p>You lose an awful lot of fun in England if you only talk to the people you
  meet in the club. Their very affluence has stripped them of romance and the
  glamour of great pasts. I am a teller of stories by profession, but I seldom
  take stories from real life because they are so improbable that literary
  critics say: "Well...! Really...!" and a writer who makes a literary critic
  angry ought to be well slapped.</p>

  <p>All the real stories, the big ones, are not contained between covers.
  Adventures...?</p>

  <p>There's a stout and sturdy young joiner who will come to your house and
  cover your walls with oak panelling that looks really old&mdash;worm-holes
  and knot-holes, and bits of moulding breaking off through extreme age, and
  all that sort of thing. He rides a motor-bike and was nearly killed a year
  ago somewhere in Kent, but he is all right now and is going to be married.
  Maybe he is married.</p>

  <p>A stout fellow, terribly tightly dressed, with a reddish, round face and
  good-looking.</p>

  <p>I got tired of talking about wormholes, so I ventured to express views
  about Stalin. He brightened.</p>

  <p>"I was with Denikin's army," he said staggeringly. "It was really awful.
  The Bolshies retreated on Moscow because they thought Denikin's crowd was led
  by British officers&mdash;they were Russki's really, in British officers'
  uniform. My feet were frozen and I was taken to the hospital, and then the
  Bolshies began their advance. We could hear the guns in the hospital. A
  Russian nurse used to come and sit on my mattress and, drawing her fingers
  across her pretty neck, used to say: 'Presently Russians come&mdash;' they
  cut your t'roat!' Cheerful, eh? A pal of mine got me out under fire. Laid me
  on a sledge and ran for it. What was my job? I don't know what I didn't do!
  Machine-gun instructor&mdash;everything!".</p>

  <p>Here was Denikin's army in London, N.W.! You would never know that unless
  you took the trouble to find out.</p>

  <p>A rather dour, middle-aged taxi driver brought me home one evening. In
  front of where he pulled up was a big American car. He looked at it
  critically and wondered if the back axle was O.K. in the new model.</p>

  <p>"Know it?" I asked. He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Last time I drove one was over the Khyber Pass," he said. "They're
  wonderful on hills."</p>

  <p>The chauffeur who was standing by the car had views. His driving was in
  Serbia. He was awarded a gold medal, but never got it.</p>

  <p>Khyber Pass and Monastir compared notes. They said horrible things about
  certain makes of cars. I sat on the running board and listened, I think my
  neighbours thought I was the worse for drink.</p>

  <p>There are two racing reporters&mdash;you can meet them at any meeting. One
  of these took convoys to the edge of the Afghan country, and knows quite a
  lot about the playful ways of hill rivers. The second man had an easier job.
  All he had to do was to teach young flying corps officers to jump out of
  balloons. He knows almost as much about parachutes as he does about Galopin'
  Blood. But these two are not really eligible for my category of commonplace
  people. Journalists are very uncommon people&mdash;especially racing
  journalists. My experience of life is that the best stories are those of the
  most (apparently) commonplace folk, and the worst are those of men whose
  lives you would imagine were packed with thrills. I once interviewed a
  hangman, and all that he said was: "Well, sir... it was like this..."</p>

  <p>He never really got interesting until he started to talk about chickens
  and advanced this brand-new theory about biology: That hens lay eggs and
  produce all cockerels if you put the nest under a green light. And that was a
  lie. Probably hens do that sort of thing for hangmen, but they don't do it
  for humble reporters.</p>

  <p>You could not walk through Covent Garden Market any morning without
  rubbing shoulders with incredible adventure. It comes to your door, if you
  can see.</p>

  <p>One night rather late there arrived at my flat a gentleman who talked with
  an accent&mdash;well as the good people of Walworth road speak. He was
  selling tickets for a concert on behalf of broken-down horse cabmen. His
  voice was loud and hearty. He was, he confessed with pride, of the people.
  And he was educated&mdash;at where do you think? I won't tell you the school
  but it has as proud a name as any in England; a great public school that has
  sent out splendid generals and statesmen.</p>

  <p>I didn't believe him till he began rattling out from memory long passages
  of Virgil. My Latin is negligible, but I knew enough to be staggered.</p>

  <p>"That's the kind of muck I had to learn," he complained bitterly. By the
  way, he is pretty well known in South London, but I know he will not object
  to my telling the story&mdash;he oven invited me to "put it in a book."</p>

  <p>His father, a self-made and uneducated man, amassed a fortune&mdash;I
  think he owned buses. When the father died intestate the fortune was thrown
  into Chancery. An unimaginative master decided that our hero and his brother
  should be educated. He only knew one school&mdash;the boys were sent
  there.</p>

  <p>"I hated it," said my friend. "Latin an' Greek an' God knows what! As soon
  as I came out and got hold of a bit of money I bought a pub in the ________
  road!"</p>

  <p>Would you say that was possible? It is not only possible, but it is a
  fact. A thoroughly honest, decent fellow, is this public school boy. But he
  hated the life &mdash;loathed his companions. Can't you see him sitting at
  prep., his mind hovering about "The Red Cow" of his dreams?</p>

  <p>There are some amazing people in London. Down Pimlico way a lady was
  pointed out to me. She lived in a shabby lodging, and, attired in carpet
  slippers and an old cap pinned to her brassy hair, she was carrying a beer
  jug to a nearby public house. To get, she said pleasantly, her morning
  ration. I happen to know that she made history&mdash;changed the succession
  of a great reigning house of Europe. It seems absurd, but it is a fact. The
  story cannot be told, but it is common property in Press circles.</p>

  <p>The truth is that in this country (and possibly in no other country) there
  are no commonplace people except to the superficial observer. If you can't
  see behind the eyes or get into the minds of folk and accept just what they
  present to you, features, figures, and manners, the world must be a dull
  place. And you miss a lot of drama. And some splendid pathos.</p>

  <p>There is a man working for me&mdash;an Irishman. A big, good-looking Handy
  Andy, and a splendid car driver and mechanic. It was his ambition to ride at
  Brooklands on a racer, and at last his chance came. A well-known driver was
  taking him in a race as a mechanic. On the morning of the race: &mdash; "I'm
  sorry, F&mdash;, I've just learnt that you are an Irishman."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"I can't take you. My brother was murdered in Ireland by Sinn Feiners, and
  I've sworn never to employ an Irishman."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," said F&mdash; quietly. He did not tell the car racer
  that his own father, an inspector of the R.I.C., had been shot down in cold
  blood in the streets of his native town.</p>

  Reproduced from <i>The Evening Post</i> (New Zealand), March 12,
  1927</a></h3>

  <p>A pretty little house on the Bury road, every wall or every room covered
  with paintings&mdash;there is a Greuze in my bedroom, and I sleep on a noble
  bed designed for Royalty.</p>

  <p>Raphael looks down upon me in the dining-room as I eat real Yorkshire
  pudding&mdash;the host comes from that county. And Yorkshire pudding served
  as a course and eaten solemnly&mdash;and what Yorkshire pudding! Not the
  custardy stuff that London cooks prepare; not the thin slither of yellow
  pastry that cracks down on your plate at the fashionable restaurant. But
  <b>Yorkshire</b> pudding.</p>

  <p>The host is a burly gentleman; the other guest is a dapper, shrewd man
  from France.</p>

  <p>"I saw that horse this morning&mdash;you' shouldn't let him run loose... I
  never saw a horse more improved, and if he has any luck they can't keep him
  out of the first three."</p>

  <p>He was talking of Asterus, who occupied that position in the
  Cambridgeshire. It was rather a depressing week for host, for the betting tax
  was due next Monday, and he was a professional backer of horses.</p>

  <p>A gambler? Not exactly&mdash;in the Monte Carlo sense.</p>

  <p>You see, racing, from the professional backer's point of view, is a
  business. You can reduce a field of thirty-seven runners to four or five, and
  can say nearly with certainty: "One of these five will win." You cannot sit
  at a table at Monte Carlo and be assured that, of the thirty-seven numbers,
  one of five will turn up. That is the difference between racing and gambling.
  If you take black and red and gamble on one or the other, there is nothing to
  prevent red and black coming up alternately; but if you match Coronach
  against a selling plater in twenty races, it is definitely certain, bar
  accidents, that Coronach will win every time.</p>

  <p>You can make mistakes, of course.</p>

  <p>Arthur (as I-will call him) climbed up to the stand as the horses were at
  the post.</p>

  <p>"Have you made a bet?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've got twenty-eight hundred pounds on Adam's Apple," he said, "and,
  having seen him go to the post, I think I've lost my money."</p>

  <p>Something had happened to Adam's Apple. He was beaten, and well beaten,
  and returned to the paddock with peculiar symptoms, to which the attention of
  the stewards was drawn.</p>

  <p>Arthur knew he was beaten before the field came to the dip.</p>

  <p>"I've lost," he said in a conversational tone, and asked me whether I had
  slept well on the previous night. There was no emotion, no hectic reviling of
  horse and jockey. He had lost&mdash;that was all. If he had won, he would
  still have asked me if I had slept well. He won a thousand on the last race,
  and finished the day losing £1300.</p>

  <p>"I have turned over as much as two millions in a year&mdash;my winnings on
  balance were not very considerable. If I had paid a tax of 2 per cent. I
  should have lost £20,000 on the year!"</p>

  <p>He goes to the South of France regularly, but the tables never see him.
  One of his friends complained that he had lost £5000 in six weeks. "You
  haven't," said Arthur promptly. Indignantly the friend produces his pass-
  book.</p>

  <p>"Still you haven't lost," said Arthur, and proved it.</p>

  <p>The man had been playing regularly, and from every coup the Casino had
  extracted its little tax. The friend sat down and worked out roughly how much
  the Casino authorities had taken&mdash;£8000. "You've won three
  thousand&mdash;congratulations! " said Arthur sardonically.</p>

  <p>That 2 per cent, tax has made betting impossible for him, and he argues
  that racing will be made impossible for the masses. The "same principles
  apply whether a man bets in shillings or thousands.</p>

  <p>"Kitty" is draining steadily. With every twenty-five bets the stake is
  absorbed to the State. Politically, the result will be interesting to see.
  For some reason racing folk are conservative in politics&mdash;even the
  smaller fry are Tories. My own view (which is entirely dispassionate) is that
  the Bets Tax will produce an enormous turnover of votes, and that it will be
  remembered against the party when the coal strike is forgotten.</p>

  <p>But that we shall see. It is certain that every bookmaker will be a
  nucleus of anti-Government propaganda, and that the rough machinery exists to
  spread that propaganda. This factor is not to be despised. A test canvass
  would, I think, produce results that would stagger the party managers. As to
  Arthur, he can afford to wait and "look on," but he is more favourably
  situated than some of the other "pros."</p>

  <p>"Quite a lot of people will go out of ownership in a year or so. Two
  thirds of owners can only afford to keep up a stable if they can
  bet&mdash;you can't keep horses on the money you win through stakes. If the
  tax continues, we may not feel the effect for three years."</p>

  <p>The professional backer lives a strenuous live. He is up in the morning
  (if he lives at Newmarket), watching the horses at exercise. He has to
  understand horses, and mostly he must be able to distinguish in the course of
  a race just what every animal is doing. His judgment is perfect. He will tell
  you two furlongs from home what horse will win, and when they finish by the
  post in a close finish he seldom is in error when he names the winner,
  however bad the angle may be.</p>

  <p>There was a race at Newmarket when three horses, widely separated seemed
  to have passed the judge in a line. He knew that I had backed one, which in
  my judgment was third. "Yours has won for a fiver!" he said, but I didn't
  bet. I knew that he must be right. And I was wise in my generation, for the
  horse I had backed had won by a head.</p>

  <p>Arthur seldom bets on handicaps&mdash;it must be a weight-for-age race or
  nothing.</p>

  <p>What does a man like that do with the money he wins? He took me in his car
  to a place beyond Dullingham, and introduced, me to his new stud farm. They
  were ploughing the far field, and bricklayers were already at work laying the
  first courses !of his new boxes. This untidy field was to hold three
  paddocks&mdash;that stretch of grass land was for the yearlings. His sire,
  the pride of his eyes, was coming here, and he was very confident about the
  future. "I put all my money back into racing side of racing. I have just sold
  my old stud farm&mdash;l think this is a better one." I spoke well of his
  stallion, one of the grandest looking horses i have ever seen at stud. "This
  is where the gambling comes in," he said. "That horse should have won the
  Stakes at Goodwood, but was left at the post. He could have won pulling up,
  and his fee at stud would have been somewhere in the region of ~8 guineas. As
  it is, I am giving subscriptions for nine guineas&mdash;it is the only way I
  can 'prove' him. He'll sire great horses, that is certain. Look at his legs!
  The hardest thing to breed out of a horse is bad legs, and yet breeders send
  their valuable mares quite gaily to broken-down animals and pay 198 guineas
  for the privilege." I watched the big tractors steaming away on the far
  field,and turning the dirty green into rich black earth, and seemed to be
  very far away from the precarious game. And yet it is all part of.it. All
  round were cottages occupied by families that lived on horse-racing, though
  they themselves may never have seen the colours on a horse. The ploughman and
  the tractor men, the hedgers, and bricklayers.</p>

  <p>A smart-looking man in gaiters came across the soon-to-be paddocks. "I've
  just been looking at that mare's pedigree, Mr. A&mdash;. She's got two close
  crosses to Galopin'..."</p>

  <p>The stud groom brings you nearer to the track. Yet he is not passionately
  interested in the actualities of racing.</p>

  <p>Driving back, Arthur indicated the points of interest in the landscape.
  "Captain Cuttle stands over there, and..." He named in rapid succession a
  dozen famous names. Newmarket again. The main street blocked with hackney
  carriages and char-a-bancs, and the pavements thronged with newspaper sellers
  and purveyors of race cards; all the world flocking up to the Heath, and the
  air vibrating with tips. And a little later: "I'll take you six hundred to
  four twice!" The tapes are up, and the huge field is on its way home.
  Thousands of race-glasses are levelled on the silken jackets. And then, as
  the field comes down Bushes Hill, a bookmaker airs his opinion. "I'll lay
  five hundred to two, Sea Girt!"</p>

  <p>"Take you!" One of Arthur's kind backs his judgment, and wins.</p>

  <p>Going home that evening: "There's a mare coming up at the December sales
  that ought to be bought&mdash;she hasn't foaled a winner, but I'm confident
  that she will. A friend of mine bought a mare, kept her for years and she
  never gave him a foal worth racing. The year he sold her she had a colt that
  won £12,000 in stakes..." A precarious game.</p>

  <p>Parsons..." One does not know very much about them. Some of them have nice
  houses in beautiful little country towns. Some go trudging through the slush
  and fog of London. All seem desperately short of money. One is awfully
  careful about what one says in their presence, and they marry you and all
  that sort of thing.</p>

  <p>An ill-paid profession, sometimes an annoying profession, for do they not
  occasionally refuse to bury Dissenters or even refuse burial at all in
  consecrated ground? And do they not some times figure in scandalous columns
  of Sunday news&mdash;an appropriate day for the exposition, of their
  weaknesses? Whereupon do we not raise our voices and say:</p>

  <p>"Ah! These parsons...!"</p>

  <p>Down Tidal Basin way on a rainy night last week they came and knocked up a
  parson. His parents live rather nobly in a Yorkshire mansion, and have cars
  and things. He lives meanly in a very small house, a thin, rather plain young
  man (he admits this joyfully), and be has to keep body to soul on a dietary a
  little better than you can get in a workhouse, but not so good as they serve
  at Dartmoor. He got out of his bed and went out into the night, and
  eventually was guided to a hovel where a man lay with the sweat of death upon
  his face and a great unrest in his heart. And he was there, in that frowsy
  room, until daylight came uncleanly through the panes, and the man went to
  his appointed end.</p>

  <p>He had to go back to his little church for Matins. Nobody else was in the
  church&mdash;few people came at that hour. At 11 o'clock he had to meet
  church officials about the heating of the little mission hall. He lunched
  expensively with Lady Somebody. He was rather bored, and would gladly have
  taken the value of it instead, but she was helping to raise some money for
  one of his funds. People who saw him lunching probably said:</p>

  <p>"These parsons! They do themselves jolly well."</p>

  <p>He had some old women to see in the afternoon; lonely old women who were
  not picturesquely starving, but were dying of dullness. They have enough to
  live on, but nobody speaks to them. They just sit and look out of the window
  at the backyard, or put a little coal on the fire, or make themselves a cup
  of tea. They are the living dead. The noisy tide of life sweeps past them but
  none of the noises is directed towards the sad old women and men who hobble
  from bed to fireplace, and from fireplace to window.</p>

  <p>"Bore me?" he chuckled. "Of course they bore me! They would have plenty of
  visitors if they were amusing. But it is worth being bored to see them
  brighten up at the sound of a human voice. They like their religion in its
  most formal shape&mdash;some of them shy when I tell them I am an
  Anglo-Catholic&mdash;they want to know what I think of the Pope! Poor, drab
  creatures&mdash;but you can find lots of flowers and beauty in their
  lives."</p>

  <p>Were they churchgoers? Frankly, he wasn't sure.</p>

  <p>"But what we're building on is the knowledge that the Church of Christ is
  not a friendly society which has no benefits except for its members. People
  come to me at all hours to ask me if I would visit their dying relatives. And
  I go. I've never seen them before nor heard of them. I have the shining
  example of the Jewish rabbi who, on the field of battle, gave absolution to a
  dying Catholic. A stout fellow, that&mdash;and inspired."</p>

  <p>Curiously enough, the old cadging class that hung like parasites to the
  robes of the Church have dropped off. The blanket and coat brigade that
  attended two services on Sunday, and had its material reward at intervals,
  seems to have shrunk to platoon size since the war.</p>

  <p>"The terrible thing about dying people is the anxiety of their friends to
  'humour' them.</p>

  <p>A great West End surgeon had told me the same thing in almost identical
  language a few days before. He said the most pathetic spectacle in the world
  is a dying man or woman who really wants something done which nobody will
  do.</p>

  <p>"Get me the documents that you'll find in the top right-hand drawer of my
  desk!"</p>

  <p>The well-meaning wife or husband tries to soothe the sufferer.</p>

  <p>"That will be all right&mdash;don't worry everything will be all
  right."</p>

  <p>The poor, exhausted creature has no strength to insist. Sometimes it is a
  bundle of letters to read which will add bitterness to a widow's sorrow. Once
  it was a book of dubious character.</p>

  <p>Nobody takes dying people seriously&mdash;which is dreadful.</p>

  <p>My Ritz-lunching parson has many callers at his little house. Girls in
  trouble&mdash;women whose furniture has been distrained&mdash;men who would
  like him to break bad news that they have not the courage to break...</p>

  <p>His church is not crowded on Sunday. Nor do his parishioners call him
  blessed as he passes by. They greet him with embarrassed grins; most of them
  think that he makes a fine living out of parsoning.</p>

  <p>"Otherwise," they argue, "why should he?"</p>

  <p>They have for him the same respect as they offer to the fire brigade; that
  is in many ways a perfect parallel.</p>

  <p>The Church has grown curiously since the war. Such trace of its
  development as may be found in statistics gives no real understanding of what
  has taken place. Men came back from France immensely advanced in their views
  of eternity. Death was a palpable fact; ordinarily a man might go through the
  best part of his life and never see the ludicrous thing that once held a
  soul. War changed that for millions. The phenomenon was a daily experience.
  It was the living which became curiosities. And what after? Here's a man in a
  white surplice who one thing; here's a man in a biretta who says different.
  Some men found temporary comfort and courage in one set of observances, some
  in another. I imagine that in the vast majority of cases the final settlement
  of this soul business was postponed with the contingency that, if the Reaper
  came m the meantime, they had effected a sort of short-term spiritual
  assurance.</p>

  <p>Certainly the god of war has a countenance more terrible than the god of
  peace.</p>

  <p>They came back in their millions, not to mope or mourn or pray, but to
  find relaxation and forgetfulness of the mad years that had gone. And such as
  retained any curiosity on the object learnt on inquiry that the civilian God
  was something of a stranger. It is absurd of course, but the God who is
  beseeched to bring rain for farmers bears no resemblance to the terrific God
  to whom hearts go out in an agony of supplication when red death is leering
  at your elbow.</p>

  <p>"People had to scrap their old conceptions and begin building again. And
  the Church is the gainer. I especially believe that the Anglo-Catholic Church
  has gained most."</p>

  <p>There is a stout evangelical section which is for "broadcasting" the
  Church, making wider the gap between the old Church and the new. They believe
  that Christian religion should be stripped of its fal-de-rals and its
  esotericism. Where the stripping shall stop, nobody knows.</p>

  <p>The passion for simplicity of service and observance would be
  understandable if the Christian religion were of itself entirely free from
  mysteries. But it isn't. If it is, then there is no religion. When your
  scientist and your philosopher have found a purely logical explanation for
  such phenomena as the Resurrection and Prayer, when even faith is reduced to
  a pathological term&mdash;when all the mysteries are mysteries no longer,
  what remains? You may go on informalising until there is nothing left. And
  the strange thing to me is that, even as the Socialist sneers at evening
  dress, yet wears a red tie, so those who are all for removing crosses from
  churches are sticklers for the formal. They must have pews of a certain shape
  and discomfort&mdash; they even close their eyes when they pray! Why? There
  is nothing more reprehensible in a genuflexion than in kneeling to pray. One
  act of adoration cannot be wrong and another right because different sets of
  muscles are employed in the process.</p>

  <p>"Prayer book revision?" My friend the priest shook his head. "I really
  don't know what will happen. They will leave me my altar..."</p>

  <p>He needs his altar very badly; In the early morning you will find him
  kneeling there as the church bell clangs unmusically. Always providing that
  he has not been called somewhere.</p>

  <p>"Doctor says mother can't live another hour, and father says would you
  come along an' say a piece?"</p>

  Was the last words he said,<br>

  To the points of their ri-fills.<br>
  The smoke cleared away&mdash;<br>
  Our young he'ro lay dead!</p><br>

  <p class="first">"GOOD GOD!" said I, shocked. "Haven't they forgotten that
  song?"</p>

  <p>"They don't forget nothing in the Army," said Ernest with pride.</p>

  <p>Here was I in a canteen&mdash;a sort of idealised canteen&mdash;and here
  was Private Somebody-or-other singing the song that brought tears to my
  youthful eyes way back in '94. Nothing has changed. The Army forgets
  nothing.</p>

  <p>Do you ever realise that there are no printed rules for hopscotch or
  rounders or tipcat, and no treatise on the art of spinning tops? The mystery
  of these noble practices is handed down from generation to generation by word
  of mouth. And nobody has ever laid down the rule that the favourite songs of
  the Army should be Irish revolutionary songs, and yet they have been for so
  long as I can remember. I suppose there is a certain plaintiveness about
  Irish songs which appeals to the sentimental soldier&mdash;for soldiers are
  still sentimental.</p>

  <p>No change. More money, a little more work, better feeding (in dining-
  halls instead of the barrack-rooms), but otherwise just the same, old
  Army&mdash;the Army of '14 and the Army of Wellington and Marlborough. Who
  told the soldier that Ypres was to be pronounced "Wipers"? The British Army
  has always called : Ypres "Wipers." Marlborough's soldiers did. I saw a
  letter the other day from one of Marlborough's officers. "The men speak cf
  the town as Wypirs," he wrote. In one respect, however, there has been a
  change for the worse. An old dummer with umpteen years' service says that
  beer is not what it was.</p>

  <p>But then they used to say the same thing when I was a soldier. There was
  an old Crimean veteran, Callaghan, of the Rifle Brigade, who could and did
  speak for hours on the subject of Brews. He was a teetotaller when I met him,
  having been driven to this distressing decision by the falling off in the
  quality of Army beer.</p>

  <p>The older men, the '14 veterans, will tell you, shaking their heads, that
  the Army isn't what it was. But then, the Army has never been what it was. In
  1893 I was told by an ancient barrack warden that when he was
  soldiering&mdash;it was soldiering.</p>

  <p>"The present generation" (I can hear his quavering voice now) "is midgets
  compared with the men who was soldiering when I was a recruit."</p>

  <p>And so on ad infinitum &mdash;down the ages will go that head-wagging. "In
  my time soldiering was soldiering!"</p>

  <p>A second-in-command major challenged the "no change" theory.</p>

  <p>"There is one difference&mdash;we don't get half as many 'drunks' as we
  did. In your time you'd probably have three drunks in the 'clink' every
  night&mdash;we very rarely get them. I think the standard is higher than it
  was before the war&mdash;physique and character. Certainly the Army of to-day
  as more technically perfect; the drill and training approximate nearer to the
  realities of war. We are building up a magnificent force."</p>

  <p>The Army really doesn't change, because it is recruited from an unchanging
  class&mdash;youthful working-class people. Men of better education, the kind
  that with luck and application have got a job pupil-teaching or bank
  clerking, can make good in the Army only if they are good mixers. Tommy still
  resents swank.</p>

  <p>Of one who gave himself airs because he imagined he was superior to his
  fellows, Ernest said:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"He struck pa with a roll of music and run away for a soldier!"</p>

  <p>I was awe-stricken. "Do they still say that?" I asked in a hushed
  voice.</p>

  <p>The Army doesn't change. As, for instance:</p>

  <p>"The worst thing about soldierin' is that people look down on you. When
  there's a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;war on," I finished, "they make a fuss of you, but now the war's
  over they treat you like dirt, and won't let their daughters go strolling
  with you down dark and draughty lanes."</p>

  <p>"You heard about it?" said Ernest, interested.</p>

  <p>"Thirty-three years ago," I told him.</p>

  <p>Private soldiers are very human and are pleasant to talk to; warrant
  officers terrify me because they have grievances which revolve in some
  mysterious fashion around the Royal Warrant for Pay and Promotion. And a
  warrant officer with a grievance is more fearful than measles...</p>

  <p>Here is the old square again, gravelled and uneven. And the old red
  barracks with their shining windows, and the faint blare of a bugle summoning
  orderly sergeants, and the little knot of left-footed recruits being
  initiated into certain mysteries.</p>

  <p>Gosh! How lovely and young it makes you feel to see three youthful
  military gentlemen pushing a hand-cart full of coal, under the eyes of a
  self-conscious lance-corporal, and to hear one wind-blown fragment of speech
  as they pass.</p>

  <p>"There ought to be a so-and-so coal mine outside every so-and-so married
  quarters!"</p>

  <p>In my days love and light refreshment were the curses of the Army. To-
  day, even as the guard-rooms have fewer occupants, so have the
  hospitals&mdash;in certain respects. We are much more intelligent about
  things to-day&mdash;broader, more humane, and we teach soldiers things that
  would never have been possible in the prudish 'nineties. Aldershot, as
  everybody knows, is the hub of the military universe (though Catterick is
  making a little hub of its own), and in or about Aldershot are all the
  mysteries and wonders which science has evolved for the destruction of
  possible enemies. The new soldier by rights should be a slim wan with a
  bulbous forehead, a little short-sighted and mathematically minded. He should
  approximate to those supermen whom it is the joy of Mr. Wells to describe
  when he is not engaged in particularising the nasty amours of self-made
  men.</p>

  <p>Think of all the material progress we have seen since the days of the
  Martini-Henry! The tanks and gas masks, the armour-plated aeroplanes and
  wireless, and the Lord knows what. But the spirit of progress has not touched
  the poor so-and-so infantry; they are just whore they were in the days of
  William the Conqueror.</p>

  <p>Ernest (who is something of a find) wrinkles his nose sneeringly at
  science.</p>

  <p>"I've heard all the muck about the next war&mdash;repeatin' rifles an'
  what-not. And gas and sick-smoke and aeroplanes that can wipe out Aldershot
  in three ticks. Death-rays&mdash;you ain't mentioned them! But when the war
  comes, what'll it be? A fatig' just the same as the last one! Workin' parties
  an' whizz-bangs, snipers, and cetera. 'Over the top and good luck, old boy!'
  I know!</p>

  <p>"They'll sit down an' work it out on paper&mdash;so many places to be
  wiped out with aeroplanes, so many miles of trenches to be took by tanks, and
  so on and so forth. An' when the places ain't wiped out and the trenches
  ain't took, they'll say, 'Shove in the Fif' Division, an' see what they can
  do.'<br></p>

  <p>"Moppin' up is war&mdash;not tanks an' aeroplanes&mdash;it's fillin' up
  the gaps that counts. I'm not sayin' anything against science, but I'll
  believe in it when the War Office takes away the soldiers' bayonets and
  scraps the bombin' school."</p>

  <p>In almost exactly these words did Ernest recapitulate his faith in the
  indispensable infantry.</p>

  <p>"That is about the silliest book I have ever read," said Diana.</p>

  <p>I took the slim volume from her hand and read it. And as I read, my hair
  stood up. It was the nastiest little book that has ever come my way, being
  the confession of a peculiarly unpleasant young lady who had the habit of
  going into the woods and taking off her clothes. And, of course, it was most
  "literary," all high-falutin', and on the loftiest plane. It has to be that,
  or the queer folk who like that kind of stuff would have no excuse for
  reading it.</p>

  <p>"But it is so well written," they plead.</p>

  <p>I put the book down.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of this kind of muck?"</p>

  <p>"I think it is silly," said Diana, "and it is not terribly well written.
  Anyway, who would do that sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>That was all. Nothing about the blatant indecency of it&mdash;its syrupy
  impurities. Diana is not so terribly modern that she stands out from her girl
  friends. They have all read the little book.</p>

  <p>("Please return it directly to the librarian," says the lady at the
  library, a little shocked.)</p>

  <p>There are stern fathers who, having seen that kind of literature in their
  daughter's hands, would grow tremendous and awful. They would talk about what
  their dear mothers would say if they were alive, and the effect on their dear
  grandmothers. But that is rather stupid.</p>

  <p>There was an age when girls were not supposed to have legs&mdash;only trim
  little ankles, and those only occasionally, when big masculine D-s produced
  faintness in gently-nurtured females. An age of artificiality that tolerated
  the nude in Renaissance art, but rather suggested that things had improved
  since then.</p>

  <p>This is an age of reality; emphatically more wholesome. Gone are the days
  of nasty ancient mysteries which were not mysteries at all, though everybody
  pretended they were. Truth is a great killer of diseased imaginations. There
  is an idea amongst quite nice people that the modern girl drinks too much,
  smokes too much, keeps abominable hours, and is rather heartless.</p>

  <p>"Which means,",said Diana, in relation to the last stricture; "that she
  isn't as sentimental as she was. I don't think we are&mdash;in fact, I'm
  sure. Naturally, I can't remember pre-war men, but I am certain that they
  weren't as sentimental as the young men of to-day. They slop! I know it's an
  ugly word, but they just slop. Women are being driven to heartlessness in
  self-defence."</p>

  <p>Later Diana was very frank on a matter which her mother would never have
  discussed with her father.</p>

  <p>"That's silly, too," she said when (very mildly) I pointed this out. "If a
  motor engine were human, I am sure it would never blush when it discussed its
  carburettor. I think the other generations of women must have had an awful
  time&mdash;they were never allowed to have anything but headaches. That is
  why they never had their appendices out&mdash;they weren't supposed to have
  'em! It was ladylike to die gracefully surrounded by your weeping relatives,
  but only the doctor and the intimate friends of your family were allowed to
  know that it was something to do with the tummy.</p>

  <p>"And the mysteries! Whispered in dark corners like a tribal
  secret&mdash;The Thing Unknown To Man! And think of the girls who went to
  their marriage with the idea that the doctor brought the baby in a big black
  bag&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stuff," said I.</p>

  <p>"Stuff," echoed Diana. "I know a girl who was brought up nicely. Her
  mother told her nothing&mdash;froze her to death when she asked. You know the
  sort of thing&mdash;'My dear, that is not the sort of thing one wishes to
  talk about.' A sort of inverted vanity."</p>

  <p>Now the modern girl knows. Is she worse or better for the knowledge? If
  she is worse, then society is in a rotten state, for these secret matters are
  discussed very frankly.</p>

  <p>And of course she is better. Prurience succumbs to the germicidal
  qualities of Stark Truth. You discover that if you are acquainted with any of
  the big girls' schools in the country. Behind the slang phrases employed to
  describe the indescribables of life is sheer sanity&mdash;which is Truth. It
  is good form to be flippant on subjects that would make the overworked and
  over-libelled grandmother turn in her grave; it is bad form to make such
  matters a subject of conversation.</p>

  <p>I was in a night club (so called) last Wednesday, and had a good look
  round for the cocktail-drinking. and modern young lady who is supposed to
  haunt these establishments. There were about two or three known to me, and
  they were drinking something innocuous. They had come in after a theatre, and
  were gone before 1 o'clock.</p>

  <p>"The average nice girl hasn't a look in at these places," said Diana,
  relentlessly. "You could comb all the night clubs in London any night and
  never find more than two dozen, and they would be with their parents or
  uncles or things. Young men haven't any money. Most of the women you see at
  the club are middle-aged, and if they're young and pretty and are always
  dancing with the same partner whenever you meet them, they are 'What'll I
  Do's.'"</p>

  <p>"What is a 'What'll I Do'?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know that brand of song?" asked Diana. "'The Broken Doll' and
  'What'll I Do' and 'You Made Me Love You'? They're all about girls who have
  lost their well-off dancing partners&mdash;poor dears!"</p>

  <p>There is an idea abroad that her growth to athletic excellence marks the
  complete emancipation of the modern girl.</p>

  <p>"That's silly&mdash;girls have always played tennis and hockey as long as
  I can remember. Golf isn't novel, either. People get foolish ideas about
  women's athleticism from seeing freakish ladies boxing and running.
  Everything that, has 'come over' girls in the past twenty years is to the
  good. Short skirts and open necks, shingles too. If men like long hair let
  'em grow it! Let it be their crowning glory. Women have never been so
  sensibly dressed as they are today&mdash;they are leading the dressmakers,
  for a change. In the old days a Paris dressmaker could ordain just what we
  had to wear. They've tried to get back their old supremacy and failed. Time
  and time again they have tried to bring the hem of the dress to the ground,
  and they haven't. Women have found their legs&mdash;literally!"</p>

  <p>The modern youth, whilst he grows properly indignant at the suggestion
  that he is a "slop," is quite satisfied with the modern girl. A blasé
  bachelor told me!</p>

  <p>"A boy can always tell her that he is broke, and it's nice in other ways.
  Girls are better pals than they ever were. They're easy to get on with, and
  you don't have to pretend. We've lost a lot of the pretty-pretty stuff that
  is so popular on the Continent&mdash;the bowings and scrapings and hand-
  kissing, but that stately business never meant anything. I congratulate
  myself that I had the sense to wait for this generation to come along."</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>There she goes&mdash;just ahead, of me!</p>

  <p>"At the wheel of somebody's car, her shingled hair blown all ways, the end
  of a golf bag sticking up out of the dickey. Beside her crouches a
  bare-headed boy in a University who winces every time she changes gear.
  Presently she turns abruptly to take a side turning. She doesn't put out her
  hand until she turns the wheel... Fortunately I have fierce brakes on my car.
  The modern girl is a rotten driver.</p>

  Reproduced from <i>The Evening Post</i> (New Zealand), April 9, 1927</a></h3>

  <p>The musher got his cab on the never-never system. He paid so much down and
  pays, so much for years and years. Too much for too long. The cab, looking at
  it with an honest eye, is worth something under £400&mdash;he has to pay
  nearly £900. Some men have paid more. It is a form of licensed brigandage
  which has been going on for years.</p>

  <p>Saddled with this horrible liability, the "musher" (by which name the
  small owner-driver of taxi-cabs is known) took to himself a working
  partner.</p>

  <p>Nobody asks the cab whether it likes the work day and night&mdash;it just
  does. Every morning and evening it is cleaned and the engine gets a bit of a
  rest.</p>

  <p>It is a hard sort of life; the reward is poor; it is often a struggle to
  keep a family and pay the installments. There are one or two cab builders who
  have played the game with the men. Most of these have only made their
  presence felt recently.</p>

  <p>I have owned some beautiful cars in my time-I've never had one that cost
  as much as the taxi which would have brought me home to-night but for an
  unfortunate journey to Belsize Park; just think of it&mdash;for another few
  hundred pounds you could buy a 1925 car, second-hand, but of the best make
  and in fine condition!</p>

  <p>"They talk! about taxi-men expecting tips&mdash;they couldn't live,
  without 'em! I've been out since 3 o'clock this afternoon, and I've not taken
  enough to pay for the juice I've used! I hand it over to my mate at 10
  o'clock. He takes the theatre and supper trade&mdash;as much as he can get of
  it. The theatre trade's a gamble, especially on wet nights. You don't get
  regular riders but three or four.people who use us instead of a bus.</p>

  <p>"I was on the rank for three hours the other, night, and when it came to
  my turn to; pick, up, I got an old gentleman who wanted to go from Haymarket
  to Pall-Mall. One shilling&mdash;no tip. Three hours' waiting, and me,
  dreaming of taking home a young swell and his lady-friend and going to
  Hampstead by the longest way&mdash;three times round the Outer Circle and up
  Avenue road."</p>

  <p>He kept a rough diary&mdash;a sort of day-book, for the satisfaction of
  his partner. Here was a busy and eventful day:</p>

  <p class="journal">8 a.m.&mdash;Great Central Hotel to Victoria. Three
  trunks. Tip. 6d<br>
  9.15&mdash;Victoria to Bayswater road. Tip 3d.<br>
  10.20&mdash;Paddington to Claridge's. Tip 1s. 3d.<br>
  11.30&mdash;Pall-Mall to Charing Gross Hospital (gentleman in a fit. No
  tip.)<br>
  2.l5&mdash;Queen Victoria street to New Kent road. Tip 3d.<br>
  4.30&mdash;Westminster Bridge road to Kennington Oval. Tip 4d.<br>
  6.0&mdash;House of Commons to Buckingham Palace. Tip 1s.</p>

  <p>"You see what happened; I was lumbered down to Kennington Oval just as I
  might have been picking up in the city. The House of Commons man? I don't
  know who he was. I've been lots of times to Buckingham Palace, and it's a
  funny, thing, but you always get a good tip. I suppose they're afraid the
  King will tick 'em off if they don't pay up. The most generous member of
  Parliament I've ever driven is &mdash;&mdash; (a great Labour leader), and
  the meanest is &mdash;&mdash; (another great Labour leader).</p>

  <p>Generally' speaking, the master man in the cab trade hasn't the best job.
  The drivers who work for the larger corporations know that their salary is
  assured, and the tips are so much extra. They haven't the bother of upkeep,
  insurance, garaging, and if they pay for the juice they use that is allowed
  for in adjusting the wages. Some men receive (with: a 'guaranteed' minimum) a
  proportion of their earnings as shown by the clock.</p>

  <p>One trial they are spared&mdash;the spectre of the day when the instalment
  becomes due.</p>

  <p>"I've seen mushers sell their furniture to keep up their payments. It is
  hardest in the winter, and just about September, when the regular riders are
  away. Do you know, I can always feel the effect when the Newmarket meetings
  are on? The regular riders are away. It's worse with the Doncaster St. Leger
  Meeting. People are beginning to go North. It's just that class of rider, a
  man with a car of his own, who makes all the difference between a good week
  and a bad one."</p>

  <p>This musher (an old hansom driver) swears that the days of the horse cab
  were royal compared with the present.</p>

  <p>"I'd ten thousand times rather drive a hansom than the best taxi! There
  are still one or two of the old crowd that stick to the dickey. One of 'em's
  got a bit of money, and he brings his hansom out day after day and makes it
  pay. People like to ride in hansoms for the novelty of it. But he can afford
  to take a chance; I can't."</p>

  <p>He has had his drama.</p>

  <p>"I've driven two murderers&mdash;one to Pentonville, one to
  Wandsworth&mdash;after they've been sentenced to death. And I drove
  &mdash;&mdash; when he came up to London for his appeal. When he got down at
  the Law Courts he said to me; 'I wish I was you!'</p>

  <p>"I can't, tell-you how many people I've driven to Brixton Prison for debt.
  I had a regular epidemic of them once. Almost the first job I had when I came
  out of the Army was to take to Brixton an officer I knew.</p>

  <p>"I haven't had many lunatics, but my mate has. One cut all the cushions on
  his way to Camberwell House, but the gentleman who came with him paid without
  questioning."</p>

  <p>(You must imagine this little interview going in in the middle of a busy
  West End street at 8 o'clock at night, with buses and cars rumbling past on
  either side and the mud of them producing strange patterns on my
  Burberry.)</p>

  <p>"Mushing is all right when the cab money is paid, and there's nothing to
  worry about tires and repairs&mdash;at least, I suppose so; I haven't got
  there yet. And it's all right if you've got regular riders. I've got one that
  I pick up every morning and bring to the City. He never goes home at the same
  time, so he's no use to me for the return journey. And I used to have a
  regular who came from Birmingham every Monday morning. I picked him up at
  Paddington and used to take him round various places and land him at
  Bloomsbury about 1 o'clock. He always stopped the cab at the same place and
  waited on the pavement after he'd paid me until I was out of sight. That's a
  bit in your line! I found out what it was all about when a private detective
  jumped on the running board one day after I'd dropped the old boy. He wanted
  me as a witness in a divorce case, but it never came to anything; and though
  I turned up at Paddington&mdash;always used to wait near the indicator board
  for him&mdash;I never saw my rider again."</p>

  <p>Apparently when you have been mushing or driving long enough, you develop
  an eighth sense and can foretell the value of riders as tipping propositions
  at a glance. My musher advanced the astonishing theory that narrow-headed
  people never gave more than threepence, and was emphatic on one
  point&mdash;fat men are invariably generous.</p>

  <p>"I've never know a fat man who gave me less than sixpence. Women I don't
  like at all. They've got no sense of what is right. Two out of every five
  give you the exact fare. But a fat woman has never let me down. Another
  thing: if a rider, before he gets in, gives you the exact address and stops
  to tell you the best and nearest way to get to a place, he's a certain
  threepenny touch&mdash;if that."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later a gentleman crossed the half road and signified my
  musher.</p>

  <p>Cab, sir? Yes, sir,"</p>

  <p>"Take me," said the passenger, "to Belsize Park&mdash;go by way of Bow
  street and Gower street."</p>

  <p>The musher cast one pathetic glance at me&mdash;it said "Threepence!" And
  looking at the passenger's head as he opened the door of the cab, I saw that
  it was narrow. Possibly not oven threepence.</p>

  <h3>Text taken from a copy the book at the Bodleian Library<br>
  (http://dbooks.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/books/PDFs/N10513283.pdf)</h3>

  <p class="first">THE curtains that cover the lower parts of the windows of
  No. 99, Something Crescent are white and stiff. A flat strip of polished
  brass conceals the rod that stretches them. There is a perennially green
  plant on a small table in the bow window, and if you are so rude as to look
  over the curtain you will see a polished table in the centre of the room, and
  books in a neat bookcase&mdash;not, as they used to be, disposed star-shape
  about the table.</p>

  <p>Though the cottage is a villa and has tiles for thatching, yet, like the
  home described by the emotional poet:</p>

  <p class="verse">"Everything within that house<br>
  Is wondrous neat and clean"</p>

  <p>The stair carpet has snowy treads; the stair rods gleam like a Grenadier's
  buckles; the kitchen, you may be sure, has a grate in which you could see
  your face&mdash;if you preferred that to the mirror in the hall stand.</p>

  <p>There is rather a nice fragrance&mdash;a sort of hot bread and lavender
  perfume. Outside the front door is a boot-scraper, which is no mere ornament;
  inside, a mat designed for use. When the children come in from school, Mrs. Z
  appears in the passage with the forbidding eye of a drill sergeant.</p>

  <p>"Rub your boots," she says mechanically&mdash;as mechanically as she
  brushes their hair when they go to school again. (A painfully brisk business,
  this hair-brushing by a third party.)</p>

  <p>She inspected them as they pass to the scullery... a rapid fire of
  admonition and instruction. All about soap and nail brushes and splashing
  water on the floor and the effect of careless washing on clean towels. Before
  the midday meal she says grace&mdash;one of those queer old customs still
  retained at Lord Mayors' banquets and in decent suburban homes.</p>

  <p>She really does wonders on four pounds a week. Of course, four pounds a
  week is a tremendous lot of money, but you must remember that she has to pay
  the rent out of that and the rates and buy her clothes and pay The Girl, and
  perform other amazing feats of financial jugglery.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, praise is due to Mr. Z.</p>

  <p>He has three pounds with which to get through the week, and out of that he
  pays his insurance, his fares, newspapers, lodge subscription, and of course
  he has to eat and drink and smoke. Oh, and he has to buy clothes. He's always
  well dressed. You might mistake him for a quite wealthy man. He served in the
  war, is so devout a Liberal that he can explain Mr. Lloyd George, is a
  churchman, can vamp on the piano with two fingers, and just now is flirting
  with spiritualism.</p>

  <p>In the spring and summer he potters about the garden, smoking a pipe and
  wearing pre-war trousers. He mows the lawn and digs up flower beds and wields
  an adroit hose on hot and rainless summer evenings. In the winter he and his
  wife attend lectures at a local culture trap, wherein are sometimes snared
  quite important literary personages. Sometimes culture has her moments off,
  and there is a programme of song and music, for there is considerable talent
  in the neighbourhood, and Mr. Z's eighteen-year-old daughter has framed in
  her bedroom a certificate of the Royal Academy of Music.</p>

  <p>"When she was only twelve, my boy," said Mr. Z&mdash;deeply content.</p>

  <p>"And ten months," says his wife. " Practically thirteen."</p>

  <p>"Twelve," says her husband firmly. Mr. Z has a full life. There are one or
  two tennis courts in the neighbourhood to which he has admission by right,
  but generally speaking the garden keeps him pretty well occupied in the
  summer months. In the winter he has his wireless set, and occasionally a
  couple of stalls for a play that isn't going too well come his way. Then does
  Mr. Z get into a dress suit and Mrs. Z wears her clever frock and a
  fascinator over her hair. And they always enjoy the play&mdash;unless, of
  course, it is one of those plays about the rights of wives to soul mates, and
  things like that.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know which way to look," says Mrs. Z. There are still women in
  England who don't know the way to look in the presence of dirt. And thank God
  for it! His Royal Academy of Music daughter rather worries Mr. Z. She's in
  business and of late has taken to putting it on thick. He wouldn't mind that,
  for he realises that, though his wife's face normally shines from honest
  soaping, most women put it on&mdash;but, of course, not thick. His R.A.M.
  daughter isn't content with powder; she uses lip-stick, and has been known to
  use it publicly.</p>

  <p>"You've put it on thick to-night, Dorothy," says Mr. Z severely.</p>

  <p>"I can't go out looking like a scarecrow," says Dorothy, glancing sideways
  in the mirror.</p>

  <p>"Your mother doesn't look like a scarecrow," says Mr. Z with ominous calm.
  If Dorothy is wise, she will leave the matter here.</p>

  <p>"I'll take a bit off," she says; goes upstairs and doesn't.</p>

  <p>The Z's have no use for fast women. The lady at 95 is more than fast.
  According to what her Girl told the Girl at 97, and what the Girl at 97
  passed across the wall to Mr. Z's Girl, Mrs. O is no better than she should
  be. There is even a doubt as to whether she is properly married to Mr. O. She
  may be seen in the garden quite late in the morning in a greenish kimono,
  smoking cigarettes. Unmistakable court bailiffs have called at her house and
  left papers.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Z shivers at the sight of her, and refers to her as "Slommicky." It
  is a strange word, which means, so far as I have been able to trace it,
  "obscenely untidy."</p>

  <p>The Girl is an institution in the Crescent. She is not exactly a cook and
  not exactly a housemaid. She helps Mrs. Z&mdash;and is thoroughly
  unsatisfactory. You can never trust her to do anything unless "you stand over
  her all the time." A terrifying picture.</p>

  <p>Few young ladies have the distinction of being The Girl for long. They
  come and they go. The servant problem is perpetual in the Crescent. Once a
  year the Z's go to the seaside&mdash;departing in a cab to the nearest
  station. They return at the end of a fortnight, their baggage garnished with
  wooden spades and buckets, their faces a deep mahogany brown. Mrs. Z's
  souvenir is a small bottle half full of lotion which alleviates the
  irritation of gnat bites.</p>

  <p>The boys will grow up and form little households of their own. There are
  some that grew a little too quickly and were mature in 1914. They went off
  naturally to France. Some came back and some didn't. In dozens of parlours,
  behind the aspidistras, are photographs and pitiable relics of nice-looking
  lads who are memories.</p>

  <p>The household goes on the same. Still the Mr. Z's catch the 9.15; still
  the younger children come in from school and are washed and fed. Still stands
  Mrs. Z, a little more worn, a little more faded, as voluble as ever,
  directing the ablutions. Mr. Z still walks to town when there is a big
  strike, and is the first to volunteer for Special Constabulary duty. And if
  there is another war, he will stand by the iron gate that separates his front
  garden from the road and wave farewell to the new generation on the way the
  Crescent folks have trod from generation to generation.</p>

  <p>The policeman stands aloof, watchful.</p>

  <p>"You will?"</p>

  <p>"I will!"</p>

  <p>"It'd take a man to punch me on the nose!"</p>

  <p>"Would it?".</p>

  <p>"Yes, it would!"</p>

  <p>A slight, more or less harmless scuffle, undignified perhaps, but
  painless, and the policeman moves silently from the shadows.</p>

  <p>"Now then, now then!!"</p>

  <p>His tone is not stern. It is rather amused. "Now, you chaps, hop off
  home," he counsels. Confronted by seventy-four inches of legal advice, one of
  the combatants grows explanatory.</p>

  <p>"This dirty dog called me..."</p>

  <p>The offender has cast reflections upon the complainant's parentage. The
  policeman grows philosophical and ambiguous.</p>

  <p>"There's many a true word spoken in jest," he says. "Now hop it, both of
  you."</p>

  <p>They hop it.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;they're too talkative to fight," said the officer, producing a
  handkerchief from his sleeve and blowing his nose loudly. "You seldom see
  street fights nowadays, and then only when chaps are tight. All the real
  fights are one-sided. A fellow calls at another fellow's house or meets him
  in a pub and gives him a punch, and that's the end of it. You have a lot of
  right on your side before you get up and ask for another. A fighting man told
  our inspector: "If a man insults you, knock him down; if he gets up to fight,
  run like hell!' and there's a lot in it. I've had trouble arresting
  scrappers, but nothing much. Women are different, but there's no danger now
  that they wear this new kind of hat."</p>

  <p>I thought he was joking, but he wasn't.</p>

  <p>"Hatpins," he said tersely. "I've seen a constable's face ripped open when
  tackling a struggling woman&mdash;an accident, of course. But down Lambeth
  way I've known women to use them for fighting."</p>

  <p>A policeman's life is in the main a very dull one. All the interesting
  work is in the hands of the C.I.D., and the chance of a constable figuring in
  a big case is as remote as his drawing a lottery prize.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, he gets more kicks than ha'pence.</p>

  <p>"I had a cat burglar on my beat a month ago, and naturally everybody
  wanted to know where I was. A cat burglar always works with a pal, and a
  policeman being as conspicuous as Big Ben, it's not hard for the look-out to
  see him coming. If I had my way I'd have half the police force doing night
  duty in plain clothes. In the old days it was necessary to have men about in
  uniforms so that people who wanted to find a policeman could see him, but
  nowadays, when almost every house has got a telephone, it is a simple matter
  to bring an officer to the spot. Besides, if you're in plain clothes it is
  pretty easy to detect anybody who is looking for a policeman&mdash;they go
  sort of wild."</p>

  <p>The worst hours of night duty are from three to five. Patrolling a quiet
  street, a policeman may break regulations and indulge himself in a quiet
  pipe.</p>

  <p>"It isn't safe. I've known men to be reported by the people whose property
  they are guarding."</p>

  <p>Two o'clock" in the morning, and a noiseless figure strolling through a
  quiet London square His electric lamp flashes on door and window; it searches
  areas and lingers on the area door. Sometimes he mounts steps and tries the
  door.</p>

  <p>Here is a window open at the bottom. He doesn't remember having seen that
  before. He goes up the steps and knocks thunderously on the door. Presently
  an upstairs window squeaks and a quavering voice demands explanation.</p>

  <p>"Your window is open."</p>

  <p>Presently the householder in dressing-gown and pyjamas opens the door and
  admits the policeman. He doesn't know why the window is open. The constable
  turns on the lights and examines the room. Maybe he will continue his
  investigations into the kitchen. Then a servant, drawn from her slumbers,
  remembers that she opened the window just before she went to bed and forgot
  to close it. If the householder is a nice man he slips half-a-crown into the
  hand of the constable. He is not allowed to accept tips, but, not being a
  superman, he takes it. I should. Perhaps he gets a drink&mdash;which is
  against regulations. Being human, he puts down the glass and wipes his lips
  before going forth to the inspection of more areas and doors and windows.</p>

  <p>Luck is with him to-night. At four o'clock he sees a brisk little man
  carrying a workman's basket who bids him a bright "Good morning" as he
  passes.</p>

  <p>"Good morning," says the constable politely.</p>

  <p>Observation and experience tell him that that kind of basket is carried by
  a certain type of man. For instance, carpenters are an autocratic race that
  do not go to work at four o'clock in the morning. A sewer man clumping along
  in thick boots and carrying a sack, he would let pass. But a shabby little
  man with a carpenter's bag&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Here&mdash;come here."</p>

  <p>The little man turns reluctantly. What have you got in that bag,
  governor?"</p>

  <p>"Tools&mdash;I got a job to do down in; Kent&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let's have a look."</p>

  <p>The little man can either stand on his dignity or drop the bag and run. If
  he is wise he takes a middle course.</p>

  <p>"It's a cop," he says fatalistically.</p>

  <p>The bag has a number of brass taps and portions of lead piping lifted from
  an empty house. Net value about 12s.</p>

  <p>Small thieves make this sort of thing pay. Sometimes they make quite a
  good haul, and one man once got away with a hundred pounds' worth of silver
  wall brackets. There is little risk, for no family is in residence, and a
  caretaker would be sufficient to keep the thief at bay.</p>

  <p>A red letter night this for a uniformed policeman. One hand clasped
  affectionately about the burglar's arm, the other carrying the bag, they walk
  to the police station.</p>

  <p>"I was on duty in. Wigmore street when I saw this man carrying a bag. I
  asked him what it contained, and he replied, 'It's a cop.' I then took him
  into custody."</p>

  <p>The police are credited, not only with a comprehensive knowledge of torts,
  but they are even supposed to be authorities on such matters as the laws of
  succession.</p>

  <p>I was with a policeman in the Edgware road one night, when a woman
  approached him.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, young man, (a favourite method of address), "but could you
  tell me the rights of this? My poor dear mother died last month, and my
  brother says the furniture's his, though I'm older than him. And his wife's
  come round to take the sofa from my house..."</p>

  <p>The policeman knew nothing about the laws of succession, but he knew that
  not even the rightful heir can pinch sofas. He walked round the corner and
  interviewed the brother.</p>

  <p>"If you think it's yours, go to the courts. You can't go taking people's
  sofas out of their houses. How do I know it's yours?".</p>

  <p>He had the rough law of it. But then, he has the rough law of everything.
  He knows what to do in all sorts of embarrassing circumstances. When he finds
  a lady, in the middle of the night walking along the pavement in her
  nightgown, he knows just where to take her, and knows that, even if she is
  freezing to death, he must, not take her by cab unless another constable
  accompanies him. He is a frequent visitor to hospitals and mortuaries, and
  recognises a homeless dog a hundred yards away. The child who is "lost" in
  the street gravitates towards him naturally. He appears as by magic whenever
  a crowd gathers, and he can handle the ugliest of these with perfect good
  humour, giving banter for banter. He never loses his temper; he'll go out of
  his way to inform the wife of a prisoner that her husband is inside and wants
  a bit of breakfast.</p>

  <p>Never in all the chequered history of Scotland Yard (and you have to read
  George Dilnot's new book on that institution to understand how chequered it
  has been) has the police force of the Metropolis been so efficient as it is
  to-day, or held a better type of man.</p>

  <p>"It's a hard job, and yet it's an easy job," said my policeman, hitching
  himself characteristically. "The work is tiring and monotonous, but you're
  dealing with English people, and there's nobody like 'em. A lady&mdash;an
  American lady&mdash;says to me the other day: 'Why don't you carry a pistol,
  the same as the police do in New York?' I says to her: 'Madam, the police
  don't carry pistols in this country because there's nobody here bad enough to
  shoot."</p>

  <p class="verse"
     style="margin-left:30%">The snow it fell down on a father and mother,<br>
  As up to the workhouse they helped one another.<br>
  The poor old man cried In a voice full of sorrow:<br>
  "Our children will learn of this come-down with horrow.<br>
  Young Harry's In Dartmoor; a seven he's doin',<br>
  And Alfred's in Hamwell&mdash;young wimmin his ruin.<br>
  In the Infirmary Jim's a bit silly.<br>
  And Maude has a business on Piccadilly."<br>
  The tears of the father they couldn't be hided.<br>

  Let's lay our old bones in the workhouse so cruel,<br>
  An' live till we're ninety on rate-payers' gruel."<br>
  &mdash;The Ballad of the Lump</p><br>

  <p>I met him on a country road, and I thought he was a tramp who had stolen a
  ready-made suit of clothes. His eye was a little wild and he walked
  unsteadily. He was sober enough, but he confessed that he had "fairly put it
  away" last night. Him and a Birmingham chap and a feller from Poplar.</p>

  <p>His profession?</p>

  <p>"Farmin'," he said without a blush.</p>

  <p>I will not arouse to resentment the humanitarian society or Red
  municipality whose experiment he is by putting down in cold print their style
  and title.</p>

  <p>All over the country are well-meaning but ill-balanced people who believe
  that farming is the natural and proper outlet for its unemployables. Back to
  the land is only the feeblest bleat of a slogan, but there are various
  associations that are plodding along the sticky path of illusion.</p>

  <p>"Farmin'&mdash;hard work! Diggin' an' ditchin'," said the victim. "Slave
  drivin'&mdash;a dog's life!"</p>

  <p>In fact, unpleasant. He by trade was a plumber. A plumber? Well, not
  exactly a plumber, a sort of plumber's mate. Anyway, he once worked for a
  plumber. Before that he was in the docks, and after that he had been a
  watchman on a road-mending job. Also his misguided relatives had once set him
  up in the fried fish and stewed eels business.</p>

  <p>"Eels never die till sunset," he said, zoologically. The business was a
  failure from some cause&mdash;he was rather vague about this&mdash;and then a
  man he knew started backing horses on a system. The system was good, but the
  horses refused to conform to it.</p>

  <p>"It's a pretty hard life farmin'. I don't know how these farm labourers
  stick it. No life, no cinema, nothin'! Just gettin' up in the mornin' an'
  workin' all day. Lord love a duck, what a life!"</p>

  <p>Possibly, I suggested, there were compensations&mdash;a healthy life for
  the children, a freedom from care, congenial employment in the open air.</p>

  <p>"A pal of mine went out to Canada," he went off at a tangent. "Took his
  wife and family. A nice chap, one of the best bird fanciers in Barkin'. But
  somebody put this silly idea in his head about Canada, and somebody else paid
  the money for the fare, an' he pops off. And where do you think they sent
  him. To a placed called &mdash;"</p>

  <p>I told him that he probably meant "Manitoba."</p>

  <p>"That's right&mdash;you've heard about it&mdash;Manitoba. They put him in
  the country in a wood house; had to get his water out of a well. No
  life&mdash;nothin'."</p>

  <p>"Life" is, of course, essential to the happiness of the townsman. It is
  made up of seeing people walk down the street, and the sound of motor-buses
  and trams, and the final <i>Star</i> with all the results. And a picture
  palace round the corner; "Soft Bodies" on Mon., Tues., Wed., and "She Sold
  Her Soul For Extras" on Thurs., Fri., Sat. Something innocuous. Something
  innocuous, with all the dirt in the title.</p>

  <p>"They couldn't stick it, so they came back. As Joe said: 'We've only got
  to live once&mdash;let's have a bit of Life!' Poor old Joe, he's in the lump
  now&mdash;him an' his missus and the three children&mdash;four, as a matter
  of fact, and one coming."</p>

  <p>"The Lump," I would explain, is the workhouse.</p>

  <p>"Lloyd George is behind all this. Didn't he say this was goin' to be a
  country fit for heroes? Is it? No."</p>

  <p>He was thirty-eight years of age, but he hadn't been to the war.</p>

  <p>"Let them that make the wars fight 'em," he said, but offered no
  explanation as to his escape. Indeed, he returned to the question of
  farming.</p>

  <p>"It's unhealthy; it stands to reason it must be&mdash;out of doors in all
  sorts of weather. Up before it's daylight, dodgin' here and dodgin' there.
  Lookin' after pigs, and what not. You're never done! It's not like plumbin'.
  There's your job, and when it's over it's over. But farmin' is blacklegs'
  work. You're no sooner finished mendin' a fence&mdash;which is
  carpentry&mdash;than you're shovellin' muck into a cart&mdash;which is
  transport. You take it from me, no man can be a farm labourer without
  blackleggin' on some other union."</p>

  <p>He had a wife and a number of children (he wasn't quite certain how many)
  in the care of the Guardians. He came from one of those generous
  municipalities that never spoil their own ship for a ha'porth of somebody
  else's tar.</p>

  <p>"I've been doin' this farmin' for nearly two months. The food's not
  bad&mdash;but the life! I'm blest if these country yokels didn't start
  complainin' to the police because a lot of our boys had a bit of a bean-feast
  the other night! They're not used to Life. There was no harm in it&mdash;a
  lot of us went down to the pub and had a bit of a sing-song. There was a sort
  of fight, but nothin' that was wrong, if you understand me. They don't expect
  us to go farmin' in this dead-and-alive hole and not try to enjoy ourselves
  when we can, do they?"</p>

  <p>On the science of farming he is something of an authority. Pigs interested
  him. I told him the story of the labourer explaining to a more obtuse friend
  the theory of transmigration of souls.</p>

  <p>"When you die, Fred, your soul goes into something else&mdash;maybe into a
  pig. And then I comes along one day and looks in the sty an' says: 'Bless my
  soul, there's old Fred! He ain't changed a bit!'"</p>

  <p>My farming acquaintance was not amused.</p>

  <p>"You ought to see the stuff they eat!"</p>

  <p>That is what he know about pigs. As to such matters as root-
  crops&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Mind you, I know a lot. about gardenin'. I used to go hoppin' regularly,
  so did my mother and missus. That's different. You all pull together
  there&mdash;even the kids do something. Mind you; I never did much because I
  hurt my hand&mdash;fell over a hop pole first day. But between us we used to
  make a good thing of it. This kind of farmin' is different&mdash;messin'
  about with carts an' horses an' spades. You go an' work' for a day in the
  fields, turnin' over earth... by dinner time you're fit to drop if the
  foreman's anywhere about. You can have a mike when he's away&mdash;but that
  man never thinks of goin' away. There's some talk of gettin' up a petition to
  the guardians about it. The proletariat are bein' put on. Slave-drivin' and
  nothin' else!"</p>

  <p>But (here he brightened) he was giving up farming. A gentleman he knew had
  written to him offering him a job.</p>

  <p>The gentleman in question sold unpatent medicines at street corners, and
  he wanted somebody to go round with him. As a matter of fact, our friend's
  retirement from agriculture was not entirely volitionary. There had been some
  trouble at the farm about illegal absences.</p>

  <p>"I ought to have been in last night, but me an' one of those clod-'oppers
  had a few drinks last night an' I slept at his house," he volunteered. "This
  old so-and-so in charge of the farm is bound to get saucy about it&mdash;but
  I've got me answer ready for him! The new job ain't much in the way of money,
  but thank Gawd I'll see a bit of life!"</p>

  <p>I left him at the entrance of the Farm Settlement and walked back to the
  village. I had intended interviewing the superintendent, and had come down
  for that purpose. Somehow it did not seem necessary now.</p>

  <p>About popular education...</p>

  <p>It is just on 40 years since I crossed the threshold of my Alma Mater, but
  the first visible changes are extraneous to the school. For example, the dust
  chute that was such a fascinating feature of the 'eighties has gone. The deep
  and smelly pit has been filled up. Houses and workshops have been built upon
  it. And the school seems absurdly small compared with what it was in my
  days.</p>

  <p>It is a reddish, yellowish building, consisting of three floors; the lower
  for the infants, the second for the boys, and, appropriately, the highest
  floor of all for the girls.</p>

  <p>The stairs seemed rather shallow-stepped. How often have I panted up them!
  It is when you get into the corridor that you begin to see the
  changes&mdash;the pictures, the little shrine that holds the book wherein are
  inscribed the names of the boys who served; the memorial for those who fell,
  with the poppy wreath beneath it.</p>

  <p>First of the revelations was a photograph of the swimming team, then a
  certain mystic chart inscribed with figures and baffling initials.</p>

  <p>"Each of these stands for a 'house,'" said the head, a gentleman who came
  recently and in some trepidation from North London to the vicinity of the Old
  Kent road, and has been agreeably surprised to find his new pupils "perfect
  little gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"Houses?" said I, staggered.</p>

  <p>"Oh,yes, we have 'houses.' Four nouses to a class; they had named after
  streets in the neighbourhood, and they make for competition."</p>

  <p>The houses are mythical, but it is a myth which spurs youthful energies to
  excellence.</p>

  <p>"The old 'standards' have disappeared; they are classes now, and the top
  is the first."</p>

  <p>I looked over the lowest class, small boys who had just come from the
  "infants." A sturdier lot of young Britons I have never seen here; and here
  is a matter which may well interest the anthropologist&mdash;forty years ago
  the children of the working classes were not good to look upon. I vividly
  remember one standard in which half the faces were dreadful to
  see&mdash;asymmetrical to a point of deformity. Now there was hardly a face
  that was not good-looking; I only saw two children (one a girl) who were
  short of normal. There isn't a school the Kingdom that could show a more
  wholesome-looking lot of children.</p>

  <p>"Things have changed considerably since your time," said the head. "A
  whole lot of unessential have been scrapped, and, of course, there is medical
  supervision of the children The most curious thing is the amount of
  rheumatism you find amongst children nowadays; possibly it was prevalent
  before, but nobody troubled to diagnose it,"</p>

  <p>The elementary school teacher is a remarkable person. When you realise the
  drab monotony of teaching year in and year out the same old things to the
  same vague little mind, you will imagine a condition of boredom which he or
  she cannot help communicating to the pupil. But the men and women I met were
  enthusiasts, and Reddins road is no exception; you find that condition
  everywhere. One master has devised a method of teaching history which,
  naturally, I think is perfect. Naturally because two years ago I wrote a
  series of little books with the same idea. He has invented a mythical family
  history which covers all the important periods of history. He writes these
  stories in his spare time.</p>

  <p>Another master directs the sport. This season their football team is
  unbeaten. Their swimming record is truly wonderful. I have an idea that one
  small lad is a coming champion.</p>

  <p>In another class-room&mdash;the top class:</p>

  <p>"Stand up, the prefects!"</p>

  <p>Prefects? Was I hearing aright? Oh, yes, they have the "pre"
  system&mdash;a smart lot of boys they are.</p>

  <p>"They are tremendously useful," said the head; "and from a disciplinary
  point of view invaluable. They have reduced the necessity for corporal
  punishment to a minimum."</p>

  <p>He brought down the captain of the football team&mdash;I think he is also
  senior prefect. Such a nice, gentle soul; one suspects that his people are
  passing through a pretty tough time in this period of general unemployment.
  This child of fourteen goes out to face the world at Christmas. He thinks he
  may get into an office, for he is good at figures. "And the best boy in the
  school," Norman Yabsley tells me. Too good for an errand boy&mdash;you need a
  little influence to get out of that rut.</p>

  <p>The girls' school on the upper floor was a revelation. The top class wears
  a uniform dress! They knit their own red jumpers and make the overalls in
  school. And in the enforced absence of the mistress one of the prefects will
  "take" the class, set its lessons, and expound the teaching. The senior
  prefect, a pretty child, who doesn't look big enough to wield the authority
  of a head girl but does, is thirteen.</p>

  <p>Net-ball and swimming are their great games. By the way, the boys have a
  wall-game (six-a-side), which they have played for years.</p>

  <p>"We are feeling now the beneficial effects of having the children of
  former pupils," said the head mistress. "The old board schools are the
  foundation of a new <i>esprit de corps</i>."</p>

  <p>All systems of education depend primarily upon the education of the
  parent&mdash;and the poorer parent is becoming educated. They know (what they
  did not know thirty or forty years ago) that compulsory education is not a
  piece of arbitrary oppression invented by an autocratic Government. I suspect
  that a great deal of mischief was done by the insistence of that word
  "compulsory." People used to go to a lot of trouble to hoodwink the
  attendance officer, and not even quarterly awards and annual prizes induced
  regular attendance. Now the rewards for all-round excellence are more
  important. There are scholarships to secondary schools; children may even win
  scholarships to the universities.</p>

  <p>The terrible handicap remains&mdash;age limit. When a child has passed
  through the top class and has reached the age of fourteen, he or she leaves
  school automatically to swell the forces of child labour. And at this age
  boys and girls are at a most receptive stage of their existence. They are
  learning because they want to learn. Their natural talents and leanings are
  becoming manifest. School is no longer a terror, but a jolly interesting
  place. There is nothing to prevent their going to secondary schools, but that
  means a definite break and, in some sense, beginning all over again. To the
  average parent release from school attendance is welcomed, because there is
  added a new wage-earner, with the consequent cure to their finances. The
  longer the child is at school the heavier the burden becomes. A boy or girl
  of fifteen is a much more expensive proposition than the child of a more
  tender age.</p>

  <p>People much more favourably placed heave a sigh of relief when term bills
  and college fees and tradesmen's accounts no longer come three times a year
  for settlement. With families subsisting on three pounds a week it is a much
  more vital matter.</p>

  <p>Out of school I gathered round me a group of small children and asked them
  what they thought about it all. Alas! They were looking forward to release
  from the daily tyranny of the school bell.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do when you leave school?"</p>

  <p>"Work," said the small boy promptly. "I'm going to drive a motor-car!" Any
  old motor-car so long as he drove it.</p>

  <p>There was a general agreement that to go through life driving motor-cars
  was an ideal occupation. In my day we elected for engine-driving. The trouble
  is that, however well-wishing you may be, it is impossible to help them
  towards a definite occupation.</p>

  <p>Those fatal four years between 14 and 18! It is the period of
  shiftlessness, the period wherein the van boys and the other shiftless jobs
  receive their recruits, and when all the good work of devoted masters and the
  contributions of groaning rate-payers are almost entirely dissipated.</p>

  Reproduced from <i>The Evening Post</i> (New Zealand), May 14, 1927</a></h3>

  <p>The newest addition to the nursery called loudly for attention. Nanny, who
  knows the exact urgency denoted by every inflection of squeal, hurried away.
  The squeal softened to a plaintive wail, presently ceased altogether.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful people&mdash;English nannies. Take yours. She's been handling
  babies for over thirty years; all sorts of babies&mdash;English, French,
  German, Argentine&mdash;and she's not sick to death of the job. She's watched
  'em grow up and out of control; she's nursed the babies of the babies she
  herself brought up, and she's just as ready to quarrel with the cook over the
  quality of the beef-juice as ever!"</p>

  <p>Not only that, but the properly constituted nanny is all for the style and
  dignity of babyhood.</p>

  <p>"You don't mind my saying so," she says in a hushed, pained voice, "but I
  thought the perambulator looked a little shabby in the park this morning. Of
  course it has had a lot of wear. But by the side of Eric's and Hyacinth's
  perambulator it looked... Well, I thought it looked shabby."</p>

  <p>Eric, I understand, is two years of age. He has an aristocratic father,
  with a title and a number of decorations. But to Nanny he has no existence.
  He is attached to Eric; a shadowy, imponderable quantity in the eternal
  background. Hyacinth has an important parent not unknown in the world of
  medicine. But the real entity, from Nanny's point of view, is this diminutive
  person, who lords or ladies it from a pram which is distinctly superior in
  appearance and quality to my pram.</p>

  <p>She lives everlastingly in a world entirely populated by babies. A
  policeman, to her is a person who holds up the traffic to allow babies to
  cross the road in safety. She never really took an interest in His Majesty
  the King until she learnt that somewhere were preserved the little shoes he
  wore and the robes in which he was christened. The weather is good or bad,
  not by any other standard than its suitability for infants, and shops are
  interesting or not interesting according to the enthusiasm their window
  displays will arouse in the bosom of a three-year-old baby with a passion for
  balloons.</p>

  <p>And if this young lady invents weird names for members of the household
  they are instantly adopted by Nanny. "Mummie" may be Mrs. Something-Somebody
  to all the world, but she is "Mummie" to the lady in the starched white
  cap.</p>

  <p>"No real nanny ever grows up&mdash;that is why they live to be ninety,"
  said the doctor. "They have dual minds. I know one nanny who speaks four
  languages fluently, and is intensely interested in the European situation,
  but her real life is centred in the nursery. She can talk to a baby of
  three&mdash;carry on a conversation for hours, and both parties can
  understand one another. Have you ever tried to talk intelligently to a baby
  for ten minutes? Try! You'll feel like a mental case at the end of five."</p>

  <p>On the question of clothes, Nanny is an autocrat. She is entitled to be,
  because she spends quite a lot of time turning them over and mending a rent
  here and a hole there, and washing them when the rest of the family are
  thinking of going to bed, and tying up little bundles of pants with blue
  ribbon She applies for new clothes at cunningly chosen moments, and urges the
  claim of her client in the tone one would employ with a hard-hearted uncle,
  supposing you were trying to borrow a fiver. The impression is conveyed, that
  it is only by an appeal to your wife's better nature that the new hat or the
  new coat can materialise.</p>

  <p>"I think she ought to have a woollen cap. Hyacinth has
  one&mdash;blue."</p>

  <p>Demands for wardrobe never go to the father. His donatory province is
  confined to the expensive <i>etceteras</i>.</p>

  <p>Nanny is a phenomenon belonging to the comfortable, class. She lives in
  prim squares, nice country houses, and the cosy suburbs. She is Her Royal
  Highness' and My Lady's prop and stay; she lifts a burden from Mrs.
  Bourgeoisie.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, her beginning was scientific. Hidden away in her box
  is the certificate awarded by some maternity hospital authorising her to act
  in critical circumstances. In one sense, though she would not like to be told
  this, she is the legitimate successor of the unqualified Mrs. Gamp, who was
  called out at all hours of the night to assist ladies in their more delicate
  duties.</p>

  <p>More potent than a captain's guard, she does a perpetual sentry-go about
  the cot. No chill draught may enter the protected zone; all admitted to the
  presence are carefully scrutinised. She will have no promiscuous kissing of
  infants&mdash;a measles epidemic drives her into complete isolation.</p>

  <p>"That was a nice little boy who called to-day&mdash;I suppose there is no
  sickness in the family?"</p>

  <p>She has a quick ear for rumours of epidemics, and demands (subtly and
  artfully) a clean bill of health from every nurse she meets in her daily
  perambulations, before she allows her client to get more closely acquainted
  with the young man who occupies the adjacent baby carriage. Fussy? Yes. That
  is her job. Hers is the one occupation of life in which falseness is a
  virtue.</p>

  <p>I was talking to a German diplomatist a long time ago. He could not be
  accused of being Anglophile, though he did go very violently in the other
  direction. He disliked the English on paradoxical grounds, since he traced
  Germany's downfall to William's obsessive hatred of this country, which
  influenced his policy. There were certain of our qualities he admired;
  certain of our types.</p>

  <p>"The English nanny is, of course, incomparable. I wonder she hasn't a
  literature of her own. We were all brought up by her, and she gave us
  something which has lasted all our lives. It isn't the school or the
  university, nor yet the codes we acquire at these places; it is the nanny who
  makes ladies and gentlemen, and as for the codes&mdash;well, we are
  acquainted with them before we ever see the gymnasium or cottage. You may
  think it is absurd, but none the less it is a fact that I do things or don't
  do them to this day because of my nanny's teaching!</p>

  <p>"And it isn't only in the commonplace intercourses of daily life that her
  influence is felt&mdash;the psychologist who cares to examine first causes
  will have no difficulty in tracing the reflection of his nanny in the acts
  and utterances of public men. I was rather an impetuous child, and she
  trained me to silence when I was in a fury to make rather unpleasant retorts.
  In a sense she shaped me for a diplomatic career. That may sound ridiculous,
  but I know how true it is."</p>

  <p>I have heard other men give the same testimony. The psychopathologist
  knows only too well the immense importance of those early influences. And
  exactly what are they? I confess that for a week after this conversation I
  played eavesdropper at the nursery door.</p>

  <p>"We musn't throw things on the floor, must we? Baby must be a little lady
  and eat her pudding nicely. I know a little girl who never speaks until her
  pudding is finished."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asks a voice.</p>

  <p>"Because she's such a little lady."</p>

  <p>Not exactly a training for a diplomatic career.</p>

  <p>Nanny's is an amazing life of self-sacrifice; a life of little heartaches
  as the children grow up and away from her. I never go to a great public
  school without seeing the shades of a thousand wistful nannies watching the
  boys at roll-call. Sandhurst is full of those gentle ghosts, and the
  universities&mdash;and even the great offices of State. I should rather like
  to have met Winston 's nanny. What stories she could tell!</p>

  <h3>Text taken from a copy of the book at the Bodleian Library<br>
  (http://dbooks.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/books/PDFs/N10513283.pdf)</h3>

  <p class="first">A VERY nice woman got out of the taxi. The driver lifted out
  her bag and rang the hospital bell, and the brown doors opened. I had just a
  glimpse of her, in her long ulster, and then a nurse came forward and, taking
  the little suitcase, went up the stairs before her. A woman on the verge of
  tears. Her first visit to Queen Charlotte's, and full of dread at the coming
  mystery.</p>

  <p>"Providing she fulfils requirements, a married mother may come here as
  often as she wishes," said an official. "The unmarried mother we can only
  take in once; not because we make any moral distinction between one and the
  other, but because, owing to our limited accommodation, we must make some
  sort of rule to keep our numbers down." Five or six babies a day are born at
  Queen Charlotte's, and very nearly as many outside the hospital attended by
  Queen Charlotte nurses.</p>

  <p>Half the art of producing healthy babies is the pre-natal work of the
  hospital, which is comparatively a new branch of medical activity. And the
  clinic at Queen Charlotte's is growing in popularity.</p>

  <p>There is an idea&mdash;and how it came into existence nobody seems to
  know&mdash;that Queen Charlotte's is a hospital that deals only with the
  unmarried mother; but in point of fact, only twenty in a hundred of its
  inmates are in that unfortunate position. That this place has been a godsend
  to hundreds and thousands of unhappy girls, you need not doubt. Women are
  admitted "by letter" or . . .</p>

  <p>Whilst I was taking tea with the medical officer in charge, the telephone
  bell rang and he answered it.</p>

  <p>". . . Yes, I think we have a bed."</p>

  <p>He put down the telephone and rang the house 'phone, and had a short
  conversation with Sister. There was a bed to be had at a pinch, but ". . . If
  you think she would be all right till the morning, it would be better. . . .
  All right, send her in to-night."</p>

  <p>He hung up the telephone.</p>

  <p>"We take in abnormal cases at any hour of the day or night," he said. "And
  by 'abnormal' I mean cases that a doctor cannot safely treat in the patient's
  own home. Ordinarily, we see the women first as out-patients, and if they
  express a desire to come into the hospital we give them a list of
  subscribers, any one of whom could give them a letter. If there is a letter
  available, it is never refused. Pay ? If they can, of course, we take fees,
  which vary. If they can't, we take them in for nothing. Ten days after the
  child is born, the mother is ready to go home."</p>

  <p>That seems a very short time, doesn't it? I wonder if you realise what
  happens in a poor patient's home? Women have been known to do housework the
  day after the baby has been born. And worse things happen than that.</p>

  <p>Just now Queen Charlotte's suffers, as all hospitals are suffering, from
  the financial depression. It costs a lot of money to add some three or four
  thousand new young citizens to the population of London every year. You may
  legitimately prey upon the fear of a possible contributor to a general
  hospital by reminding him that he may be in need of the benefits that
  hospital confers upon suffering humanity&mdash;but Queen Charlotte's hasn't
  the same appeal. A poor woman came into the hospital one day to interview the
  medical officer in charge. She looked at him dubiously for a moment, and then
  asked:</p>

  <p>"Are you the pregnant doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Thank God I am not!" was his hearty reply.</p>

  <p>Queen Charlotte's appeal, however, is universal. It reaches, or should
  reach, to the heart of every man and woman; and although subscribers, since
  they receive a number of letters each of which entitles some poor soul to
  admission, may perhaps be importuned for their good offices, nobody really
  objects to the bother of doing a suffering woman a good turn. The outdoor
  work isn't nice. I have heard from Queen Charlotte nurses stories that made
  my blood run cold. And you get an idea of some of the difficulties when you
  learn that nurses and doctors who go out on this kind of work usually carry
  spare pennies. Why? For the penny-in-the-slot gas meter, which sometimes
  fails at a critical moment.</p>

  <p>Into some queer places these nurses and doctors go. Four floors up narrow
  stairs. All the water has to be brought by hand from the back yard, Sometimes
  practically no preparation has been made for the coming of the little
  stranger, and clothing has to be extemporised. Happy indeed is the woman with
  a letter of admission. She is carefully watched for months, and her hour is
  made as smooth as science can devise.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, they come in tears sometimes," said a nurse, "but they go out
  happily enough with their babies. And they're terribly grateful for all that
  can be done for them." I asked the medical officer if any distinction is made
  between the married and the unmarried mother. He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Practically none. There is a mark on the chart by which I can tell, but
  the average person wouldn't notice it. Unless a girl tells the others in the
  ward that she is unmarried, nobody knows. In the old days the married and the
  unmarried were separated, but now we make no difference at all."</p>

  <p>Beside each mother's cot was a smaller one containing her tiny baby.
  Sometimes, if the baby is noisy, the cot is bodily transferred elsewhere, but
  the Queen Charlotte's babies are wonderfully well-behaved, and spend most of
  the early days of their lives sleeping off the effects of a full little
  tummy.</p>

  <p>The value of such an institution for congested districts of London is too
  apparent to need any emphasis. The pity is that there is not a Queen
  Charlotte's in every crowded working-class area. As it is, I believe that
  this hospital has one-tenth of all the beds available for maternity cases in
  London. Roughly, there is only one hospital bed for maternity cases to 10,000
  of the population of London.</p>

  <p>"The working woman, and the wife of the working man, has very naturally a
  horror of Poor Law institutions," said the medical officer; "and though this
  prejudice is of course absurd&mdash; for they are very well treated and have
  the best medical service&mdash;it is quite understandable that a woman,
  however poor she may be, shrinks from inflicting upon her unborn child the
  stigma of having been born in something which in their minds is barely
  distinguishable from the workhouse."</p>

  <p>The obstetric branch of medicine has made enormous strides even in the
  past decade. The old school which believed that pain was "natural "have taken
  a lot of convincing that certain legitimate help may be given to a woman in
  her hour.</p>

  <p>The living still remember the ghastly tenet that all must be sacrificed
  for the child: to-day the unwritten law is "the mother first." This does not
  mean that any less care is taken of the new-comer: he (or she) was never so
  well looked after.</p>

  <p>"Our nurses love babies&mdash;it would be an impossible life for them if
  they didn't! You would imagine, to see them handling the newest that has come
  to town, that it was all a delightful novelty to them."</p>

  <p>The baby takes the mother's name immediately. Mrs. Wallace's child (I use
  "Wallace" because some of the Joneses are getting rather tired of the liberty
  I take with their name) becomes automatically "Baby Wallace," and is so
  ticketed.</p>

  <p>The percentage of quick recoveries is very high&mdash;the cases that start
  and end badly are usually those remitted from outside&mdash;women who have
  never been near the clinic and are only sent in by their doctors when they
  have come perilously near to being casualties.</p>

  <p>As I passed down the stairs after a visit to one of the wards, there came,
  through a door out of which a nurse was passing, a loud and lusty little
  voice raised in passionate protest at the thing called Life.</p>

  <p>"Just born," said the medical officer with a smile.</p>

  <p>Five or six times a day that little squawk of annoyance comes faintly
  through the closed door of a ward; day in, day out, the total mounts up. Five
  or six mothers come apprehensively every day; five or six others go away with
  a small fluffy bundle and pride in their eyes. Year after year the total
  rises&mdash;think, you military men : two divisions of babies born in Queen
  Charlotte's since the war! And in the past twenty years as many as would fill
  the Wembley Stadium, occupying every seat, have been given to the world in
  the hands of Queen Charlotte's nurses.</p>

  Reproduced from <i>The Evening Post</i> (New Zealand), May 21, 1927</a></h3>

  <p>It occurred to me that sailoring had gone a bit out of fashion as the
  ideal future of small boys and melodramatists. Did not the Staff-sergeant, in
  writing and sketching out the cast of a small drama we were producing for the
  A.T.A., make this vital note:</p>

  <p>"Sailors, rollicking, one"?</p>

  <p>But the sailor, where is he? He has vanished from, our midst; he is so
  shadowy a figure that even the designers of Christmas almanacs hesitate to
  employ him as a model. No more does he appear with his oleographic smile,
  clasping to his bosom mothers, aged, one.</p>

  <p>We have a Royal Navy somewhere; occasionally we see a bluejacket passing
  through London on holiday leave. Why he does not appear in London by the
  battalion once a year and take over the Royal guard for one short month,
  nobody knows. It isn't because we don't like to see him, or that he isn't as
  picturesque as the Guardsman. One supposes that somewhere in Whitehall sits a
  permanent and snuffy official who cannot agree to the expense.</p>

  <p>But really, I am not writing about the Royal Navy, but of... well, just
  sailors.</p>

  <p>Fashions have changed in the past fifty years, and they who go down to the
  sea in ships nowadays wear almost anything except plus fours. The swagger
  liners may carry a few sailorish-looking men with caps and jumpers and bell-
  bottomed trousers complete, but no more than a toastmaster would go to the
  races in a scarlet coat would they appear in their off duty moments wearing
  the uniform of the sea. A passion for mufti is a curious complex in all who
  are expected to wear uniform. Have I not seen the respectable first officer
  of a coasting passenger steamer taking his watch on the bridge in a bowler
  hat and a golf jacket?</p>

  <p>So it is that no sooner is the ship's company paid off than vanishes the
  honest blue serge of the sea, and there enters a natty line in gents'
  suitings.</p>

  <p>But the sea remains the same, its wonder and its awe-compelling
  majesty.</p>

  <p>And the age-old talk of the sea...?</p>

  <p>I was down in a southern port the other day&mdash;a port not a thousand
  miles from Southampton. In fact, it was Southampton, and I loafed round with
  an eye for Sailors' Homes.</p>

  <p>Sailors' Homes, says the cynic, are dull places, designed to keep the
  sailor out of the nice, bright public houses. There are some which are run
  upon purely denominational lines, where, in return for a certain mechanical
  cheerfulness of greeting, you are expected to give a few moments' thought to
  your soul's salvation.</p>

  <p>And there are Sailors' Homes which are very cheerful places indeed, and
  which do not wind up the night with a service of praise and song.</p>

  <p>For this is a fact which must be painful to many&mdash;that no sailor will
  ever regard a place as being homelike unless he, can get a glass of good
  ale.</p>

  <p>Down in Southampton there is caravanserai where stewards meet; and a
  steward is a something between Lord Nelson and a maître d'hôtel, so that he
  may converse with you readily and. easily on the romance and magic of sea
  travel, and can switch, lightly to the relative merits of <i>sole au bonne
  femme</i> and <i>turbot au gratin</i>. These men talk of the world as though
  it were High street, Islington.</p>

  <p>"...I heard that song sung in Melbourne... No, it wasn't, it was up at old
  Dan's, in Colombo&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're wrong," said his friend. "It was the night you and me went ashore
  at Singapore&mdash;you remember; it was the night young Carter was took ill
  through eating chop suey."</p>

  <p>There was a deck hand present who remembered eating chop suey without any
  ill effects. He was ready to defend chop suey violently.</p>

  <p>Now, I am not interested in Chinese foods, but I had gone a long way out
  of my track because somebody had told me that if I went to this
  establishment&mdash;I refuse to call it a club&mdash;I should hear real sea
  talk. So to this licensed house I came and settled myself in an old Windsor
  chair, and waited till the talk shifted in the direction of adventure.</p>

  <p>"...her brother married old Tom's sister&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That makes him Poe's uncle," said a husky voice.</p>

  <p>But the tale of the seas would out&mdash;stories of storm-driven
  windjammers, their canvases blown to rags; of high green seas that came
  thundering over the foc's'le...</p>

  <p>"Now in Australia&mdash;" (Ah, here it was coming!)"-you have to show a
  rear light on your bicycle, or you're fined. There was a chap, a
  quartermaster of the <i>Mooltan</i>, who got pinched&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not Australia," protests somebody. "You're thinking of Tasmania. I knew a
  chap who bought three tickets in a Tasmanian sweepstake, and took the second
  and third prize. He settled down in Australia and married the daughter of one
  of the biggest bugs in Sydney."</p>

  <p>Somebody knew another man who had drawn a prize in a sweepstake&mdash;or
  was it a lottery?&mdash;and drank himself to death in a year. Everybody
  agreed that he ought to have put a bit by.</p>

  <p>Did anybody remember that White Star steward who came into half a million
  dollars and "did it in" racing?</p>

  <p>Everybody named him. He was one of the legendary heroes of the fleets. The
  end of the ruined steward was tragic. He had been found drowned in a pond; it
  was only two feet deep at its deepest part.</p>

  <p>"I've known a man to get drowned in six inches of water..."</p>

  <p>The conversation went naturally in the direction of George Joseph Smith,
  the infamous brides-in-the-bath expert. And from George Joseph Smith to
  hanging, and the advantages of electrocution was but a step.</p>

  <p>I spoke to a steward, a man who had travelled round the world more often
  than he could recall, who had served in the Union Castle, the P. and 0., the
  British Orient, the Cunard, the Canadian Pacific (in both oceans), the Royal
  Mail, and other lines which I cannot remember.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there's no doubt about it," he said, "sea life is the best life.
  It's healthy and open and free, as the song says... Storms? Well you get a
  bit of bad weather, especially in the Western Ocean round about October. And
  I've known it pretty bad in the Mediterranean and down in the Indian Ocean. I
  remember one day when 840 pieces of crockery were smashed! And talking of
  crockery, when I was in the old <i>Lucania</i>&mdash;and that goes back a few
  years&mdash;I made six trips across the Western Ocean, and we never had the
  fiddles off the table for a minute! We had to serve the soup in cups. One
  trip we never had more then eight people in the dining-room for breakfast,
  from the minute we left Sandy Hook till we went into the Mersey. Have you
  ever been in the Bight? That's the place for storms! It was so bad that our
  head steward cut down the dinner to three courses&mdash;soup, joint, and
  sweets. The ship didn't keep still enough to let the blancmanges set...!"</p>

  <p>Later that night I met a typical salt; a man who gave you the impression
  that locked up in his bosom were stories compared with which <i>Treasure
  Island</i> made rather dull reading. I spoke to him of the sea, its charms
  and magic...</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said thoughtfully, knocking out his pipe, and shaking his head.
  "You're right there, guvn'nor. And I the mysterious thing is why they don't
  hang them fellows that started the shipping strike in Australia! My boy was
  on a ship that called to coal, and them larrikins and hooligans got him off,
  and said if he went back to work they'd murder him! He'd no
  money&mdash;nothing! Had to work his passage home. And now he can't get a
  ship for love or money. Is that right&mdash;I ask you? He's one of the best
  sailors that ever stepped aboard a ship. I got a fretwork frame of his at
  home that might have been done by a artist. And sing...! He's got a voice
  like that what's-his-name, the Eyetalian man. Lor' bless my life, I had it on
  the tip of me tongue..."</p>

  <p>Before I left Southampton I would have given a fiver to hear somebody say
  "Yo-ho!" or "Heave he!" and any drunken sailor who had sung me a sea chanty I
  would have put beyond the want of beer for the rest of the year.</p>

  <p>It is a terrible bore being called at all. One opened the newspaper in the
  morning and looked at the Law Notices, hoping to find some such announcement
  as:</p>

  <p>"The special jurors called at 10 o'clock for Court No.VII. are discharged
  from further duty." But the man responsible had forgotten to put that in. So
  we attended at Court No.VII.&mdash;or was it VI?&mdash;hundreds of us.</p>

  <p>Nobody else was in Court except the Clerk and ourselves and a decrepit
  usher or two, and up in the gallery three or four mistaken young men who
  imagined they were in for a real spicy case.</p>

  <p>The Clerk drew little strips of card towards him and read out our names,
  and we answered them. Of those present he selected twelve. The remainder were
  told we should not be wanted until the afternoon.</p>

  <p>We weren't wanted that afternoon or the next morning. Somewhere around
  Wednesday my name was called and I entered the jury box with eight other
  gentlemen and three ladies. And then and there we called our Maker to witness
  that we would produce a verdict according to the evidence.</p>

  <p>It was rather like being in church&mdash;sort of hushy, and all the wood
  smelt queer, just, as it does in chapels; and the seats were harder than the
  average pew. For three days I sat and listened to a story of a motor-cyclist
  who passed on the wrong side of the road and was run down by a motor mechanic
  who was driving a small car. It was rather an interesting experience; the
  complete occupation and absorption of the mind in trivialities so minutely
  unimportant that one found oneself straining to comprehend them.</p>

  <p>It was obvious from the first that the motor-cyclist was right and the
  driver of the motor-car was wrong. Anybody with the brains of a chicken could
  see without the help of the magnificently coloured charts which were placed
  in the hands of the jury, that the motor-car driver hadn't a leg to stand
  upon. The evidence for the plaintiff was unshaken; though Mr. Norman Birkett,
  who combines the manner of an archbishop with the plausibility of a
  confidence man, did his best to shake it.</p>

  <p>And there on the Bench sat a learned Judge, rather slim, precise of
  speech, his face frozen to an expression of agonised patience; and here were
  we, twelve jury people, our foreman a German Jew, with very little knowledge
  of English, but a kindly and a pleasant man, and entirely on my side.</p>

  <p>And so we progressed through the days, until came the blessed moment when
  the Judge turned and looked in our direction, and became visibly aware of our
  existence. He seemed a little surprised to find us there at all, but when he
  had recovered from the shock he spoke to us, very gently, very precisely,
  about the road that led to Canterbury and the speed at which this car was
  travelling, and, that the motor-cycle was dawdling; and he told us how
  unreliable witnesses are, and how this man had contradicted that man, leaving
  to us the privilege of saying "Liar!" to either.</p>

  <p>He showed us on his plan the "X" marking the spot where the cyclist was
  found by the motor-car (or, according to the testimony of the defendant,
  where the motor-car, was found, by the cyclist), and he left it to us to
  decide&mdash;twelve intelligent British citizens, old enough to judge the
  rights and wrongs of the case&mdash;and we consulted together in hushed
  whispers, and everybody was of one opinion except me, namely, that we should
  retire.</p>

  <p>So retire we did through a mysterious panel in the wall which rather
  reminded me of Act II of <i>The Ringer</i>, and deep down into the dungeons
  of the Law Courts we filed, into a large bare room with a large bare table,
  and there we were left.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you think," said the first lady juror, "but these
  motor-cycles are a nuisance. Why, only the other day I was driving down to
  Alton to visit my sister, and just as we came out of the main road..."</p>

  <p>I looked at her in horror.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say you're going to give a verdict against the cyclist?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I?" She was defiant.</p>

  <p>The second lady juror came to the rescue.</p>

  <p>"I think we ought to give a verdict for the cyclist," she said. She was
  rather a large, comfortable woman with unstable teeth. "My point is
  this&mdash;the motor-car driver won't have to pay; this is one of those
  insurance cases. It's only the insurance company that will have to fork out.
  Look at the money they've got. I could tell you something about..."</p>

  <p>She mentioned an insurance company. But by now the argument was general,
  and it was impossible to hear her.</p>

  <p>From time to time the large chairman threw his weight into the scale.</p>

  <p>"Vell, vell, gentlemen!" he said in his bull voice. "Now I fink we ought
  to do somet'ing, eh!"</p>

  <p>"If you expect me," said a very tall juryman, in a ponderous manner, to
  give a verdict against that motor mechanic, you're going to sit here all
  night! I'm a motor mechanic meself, and I know just how they're put on! Now
  look at this diagram."</p>

  <p>It was outspread on the table, and he struck it with his fist.</p>

  <p>"There's the cyclist, coming from Margate, and there's the motor-car
  coming from Canterbury. If that cyclist had been in his place, wouldn't he
  have, been thrown over the hedge?"</p>

  <p>"Which hedge?" I asked, searching the plan vainly. There wasn't any hedge,
  but that didn't affect the argument.</p>

  <p>"Well, if there wasn't a hedge, he'd only have been thrown further. I say
  a verdict for the defendant!" He leaned back in his chair, triumphantly.</p>

  <p>He was, as I say, a tallish man with a profound manner. He had already
  half influenced the small man who had declared himself on my side.</p>

  <p>"Look here," said I hotly.</p>

  <p>"Vell, vell, gentlemen!" boomed the foreman, "Let's do somet'ing, eh!"</p>

  <p>Down came the usher to discover if we had agreed; Emphatically we had not
  agreed. He came again after half-an-hour's interval&mdash;we were less agreed
  than before.</p>

  <p>"This is how I feel," said the lady juror who hadn't spoken before. "If
  this cyclist was oh the wrong side of the road, how could he have been coming
  from Canterbury...?"</p>

  <p>Eleven urgent voices corrected her.</p>

  <p>"It was the motor-car that was coming from Canterbury, "the cyclist who
  was coming from Margate."</p>

  <p>She put on a pair of pince-nez and studied the plan. But her explanation
  that she bad been looking at the plan upside down seemed to me to be a little
  weak. She never told us what conclusions she had reached from, her error, but
  shrugging her shoulders, said contemptuously that some men were extremely
  thick-headed.</p>

  <p>We took, a vote. Everybody except me was wrong. (One of the lady jurors
  afterwards admitted that she thought we were voting on the suggestion she put
  forward&mdash;that we should ask for tea to be sent in.)</p>

  <p>Followed a furious argument between the eleven jurymen. I walked to the
  grimy window and looked out into a very bleak courtyard. When I came back I
  found that, the motor mechanic had lost adherents; a new vote showed seven
  for the plaintiff, five for the defendant. So far as I could observe,
  everybody except the motor mechanic and I changed sides twice. A third vote
  gave me eight adherents! But here we stuck.</p>

  <p>A third time came the usher... "Is there any chance of your agreeing?"</p>

  <p>We agreed on this; there was no chance. Back to the Court we filed. The
  Judge came in, looked at us sternly&mdash;I think it was scornfully&mdash;and
  asked if there was any possibility of our reaching an opinion, and we all
  said "No."</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. Evidently, he had dealt with people like us
  before.</p>

  <p>One of the ushers paid us a pound apiece for our services to the country,
  and for my part I cannot imagine a greater waste of money.</p>

  <p>The next morning I looked in the newspapers for an account. There was
  none, but under the heading "Law Notices" I saw one item which interested me
  immensely.</p>

  <p>"For Trial Without Jurors, X. v. Z."</p>

  <p>One of these days I'm going to see such a trial as this. I should like to
  see how justice is really administered.</p>

  <p>My Communist" friend sneers heavily at titles. The mention of those
  unblessed prefixes "Lord" and "Sir' does not arouse him to frenzy, but rather
  depresses him to a state of helpless despair.</p>

  <p>"Titles, comrade!" he wails.</p>

  <p>And yet, as I pointed out to him, there is no title quite so empty and
  meaningless as this same machine-made "comrade," of his.</p>

  <p>"One of these days," he says darkly, "there will only be 'comrades' and
  nothing else. The bourgeoisie..."</p>

  <p>"Shur-rup!" I said vulgarly.</p>

  <p>And yet, strangely enough, I really believe that unintentionally and
  unknowingly he spoke the truth. But I do not believe that we shall ford to
  the great comradeship through rivers of bourgeois blood. The very idea that
  we shall is ludicrously inconsistent. But, then, Communists are not the only
  inconsistent people.</p>

  <p>I know a man who never kills flies, because he hates the thought of taking
  life, and this man, being very badly bred, is rude to waiters and shop
  assistants and other people who would lose their jobs if they punched him on
  the nose.</p>

  <p>I know another man who is never rude to anybody except his social and
  financial equals. When a lorry driver takes the middle of the, road and,
  despite his frenzied honkings, will not take the near side and give his car
  the right of way, he passes, the churl, with a grin and a wave of his hat.
  And he says that, as he didn't go to the war, and in all probability the
  lorry driver did, he dare; not be offensive for fear he is insulting a man
  who went over the top in the cold light of dawn, whilst my friend was in bed
  in Maidenhead Thicket.</p>

  <p>He said he was once rude to a bricklayer, and that when he discovered
  afterwards, that this bricklayer had held at bay a Bulgarian battalion
  single-handed with a machine-gun he felt such a worm that he could not hold
  up his head until he had sought out the leisurely layer of bricks and had
  taken him up West. I believe they both got drunk together, which was very
  reprehensible conduct on the part of my friend, who is a Master of Arts of
  the University of Cambridge.</p>

  <p>"So," said he, "was Major Armstrong, and he was hanged"&mdash;which was
  inconsequential, and a little foolish.</p>

  <p>I find in this England a growing inclination towards loving-kindness and
  real comradeship. The classes of other days have merged one into the other,
  so that you are not sure where one ends and the other begins. And with this
  change certain definite bits of Old Englishness are crumbling and vanishing
  under our very eyes.</p>

  <p>One of these is patronage. The patron has almost vanished. He lingers in
  the prospectuses of charities and on the cards of certain race meetings; but,
  generally speaking, patronage is a dying industry, and that is all to the
  good.</p>

  <p>One no longer pats an honest workman on the back and says, "My good
  fellow, you are doing splendidly. I will, send your wife some blankets at
  Christmas." You forward him a laconic notification that his salary has been
  raised. And you only slap him on the back if you are prepared to be slapped
  on the back yourself.</p>

  <p>At the same, time, we must admit that, in Russia, where everybody is
  equal, there is no such thing as patronage either. If one comrade wants
  another to do a job of work, he says: "Go along and load that wagon,
  comrade," and, if he strikes, another comrade comes along with a rifle and
  bayonet and he is clapped into a friendly prison, where everybody is equally
  depressed. And perhaps some fine morning he is taken out to face a
  neighbourly firing squad, and that's the end of him. But he is never
  patronised, never made to feel that he is less than anybody else.</p>

  <p>This brand of friendliness and equality has been introduced into England
  but has not been as successful as it might have been if our people were also
  stupid folks, who have been accustomed to do as they were told, and were
  ready to go mad with delight because they were now bossed as comrades instead
  of serfs.</p>

  <p>The queer teachers of the new comrade cult are extremely interesting. They
  have always existed&mdash;they, always will exist. It is the job they do
  best. You have never met a violent friend of Russia who could get his living
  in any other way. I know scores&mdash;quite nice fellows&mdash;who have-
  worked their way up by dint of hard work to the position they now occupy.
  Think of the years they spent waiting their opportunities. The drab, little,
  unappreciative, often derisive audiences they haltingly addressed before they
  learnt the clichés that constitute their oratory. It meant work, a continuous
  course of study, for which they were ill-equipped. Think of it that
  way&mdash;it is their only job. Take Cook. (If you are a true comrade, you
  never call anybody "mister.") There is a lot in Cook to admire. For the past
  seven years he has been the hardest-worked man in England; his energy has
  been phenomenal,and if his speeches lacked grace they did not want in rough
  vigour.</p>

  <p>Now, suppose, with the best intentions in the world&mdash;shut your eyes
  and imagine that you are a great friend and admirer of his&mdash;that you
  wanted to give him a job. What?</p>

  <p>Obviously he hasn't the balance or foresight to run a successful business,
  as obviously he is a visionary who thinks in terms of destruction. You
  couldn't place him. He is a man of extraordinary gifts; as a revivalist his
  conversions would be sensationally numerous, but he is not a religious man,
  and somehow I can't imagine that he is a hypocrite. He is doing the job that
  he understands best&mdash;just as I am, just as you are. The mass spirit
  which moves him is admittedly coloured by his own personal wrongs, real or
  imaginary.</p>

  <p>He is unhappily situated. If he had been born in Russia, he would either
  have been as great a figure as&mdash;whoever is a great figure in that
  country, or he would have been shot out of hand. In this England neither real
  eminence nor martyrdom is possible.</p>

  <p>Cook has to have his share of the new tolerance; most of us are better
  stabilised than he. We can be tolerant with him even if he cannot be tolerant
  with us, and I feel that spirit working all the time as it has never worked
  before. There isn't a Tory that hasn't been sorry for the, miner&mdash;not
  one who has not marvelled at the dogged loyalty they have given their
  leaders. It was the loyalty that Englishmen gave their officers in battle,
  even though they might not be confident in the leading of the men they
  followed. English workmen are English soldiers out of uniform, a fact of
  which nobody must lose sight. It is absurd to condemn in a labour dispute
  qualities over which we grew ecstatic in the grim days of war.</p>

  <p>The British Army was the only army which did not mutiny in the dark days
  of war. The spirit that kept them true is the very spirit which makes
  revolution unthinkable. The very spirit, paradoxically enough, which
  exasperates you when it is expressed in terms of resistance to what is glibly
  labelled "capital."</p>

  <p>You can't have it both ways. There's a lot of give and take in big
  families; it is any odds that sooner or later one of the brothers is going to
  be annoyingly naughty. It is our first job to understand him, and if he sulks
  a bit not to "sulk back."</p>

  <p>I see so many people, I know so many grades of society, that I don't think
  it is possible that I can have got a wrong impression.</p>

  <p>There is a wonderful spirit of tolerance abroad in this country to-day. A
  great breaking-down of the artificial barriers that separated man from man;
  an intense desire on the part of those most fortunately placed to make life
  tolerable for their harder-living fellows. And I think this fellowship is
  working from the other end. Who knows? We may become comrades after all!</p>
